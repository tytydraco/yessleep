Once, I actually was a pretty normal human, I had dreams, future plans and a fiance, I was young. Nineteen years old, fresh out of high school, and had plans to go to college and move in with my now dead wife. Now, nearly 34 years later, i'm a completely different person. It really all started back in my home town of Whipster, Oregon. I was 18 years old about to graduate high school, I was still living with my parents until my house was done being built so I could live with my at the time girlfriend. 

I was interested in joining the military but I was mainly interested in guns, that was going to be my major in college, ballistics, and developing new kinds of assault rifles. After a long debate and argument with my girlfriend and parents I was going to join the armed forces, or as they called it, "Special Armed Military Tactical Team." I didn't really know what they meant by "special" but my young mind was ready. Man I wish I listened to my parents and my gut feeling and never thought about joining this unit for the government. Worst decision I ever made, but, maybe I was meant for this.

I did need the money to pay for college and pay off the rest of the house, they were willing to pay a lot more money for this special unit than regular armed forces. The very first day of training was absolutely horrible, to say the least. It was in the middle of nowhere in Arizona, right in the middle of a desert. They said this kind of training was absolutely needed for this job, and that training in the desert was perfect. It was pretty normal in 105 degree weather, except when we got to the shooting range, instead of there being normal human cardboard people to shoot at, they were these massive plastic and cardboard representations of creatures I have never seen before. 

&#x200B;

There were 330 of us, split into groups of 10 for training, the training would last about 15 weeks, which I found extremely odd as you would normally go through six weeks of training for a military job.  Instead of getting easier, the training got progressively harder as the days went on. The cardboard creatures were also getting more and more deformed and terrifying. We also weren't allowed to tell anyone about our training or really just the job in general, really all we could tell was our family. 

&#x200B;

The first few weeks of training was hard, but it wasn't nothing we couldn't handle, but the last few weeks were the worst. After week ten we started practicing our aim on moving life animals, honestly I wouldn't even call them animals. They are some deformed mutated creatures, not even like they were from this world. After the first day of training with those things about 21 people quit the training over being traumatized about killing those monsters, really it's the only word I could use to describe them. They ranged from dog sized to human sized, some of them didn't even have eyes and would move around until it was shot by one of us. 

&#x200B;

What really made people quit though was we had to practice with this shape-shifter, the creatures would turn into our beloved family and friends, which was part of the training. To become desensitized toward the creatures, and not fall for their tricks. After week ten was over I started to make new friends, one of them named Bobby, an amazing person, we became best friends overnight and now he's really the only one I trust at this place, or so i thought.

Week eleven and twelve were okay, I met two guys Conner and Moses, they were both brothers, so, me, Bobby, Conner and Moses very quickly bonded and we all became best friends. When we went into week thirteen all of us thought we were ready for anything they would throw at us after going through all that. obviously, We were not prepared, honestly, no one from this planet would be prepared for these last few weeks of training we had ahead of us. 

&#x200B;

Moses had told me after week twelve, the real training started. We stopped doing cardio exercises all together and focused on shape-shifter training. After that we started using these super high tech guns. I have never seen any kind of weaponry like this, ever. this one gun was huge, it was almost two AK-47s put together, it also didn't shoot bullets, it shot these electrcial balls of pure energy, and don't even get me started on the recoil and kick these fuckers had. After shooting it once everyone could barely move their arm. Allison, one of our commanders shot it without experiencing too much pain to show it can be used without breaking your shoulder, the gun was called the quantum rail gun. My question was, what kind of creatures would need this powerful of a gun to be killed?

Week thirteen and fourteen mainly consisted of using that gun, and doing shape-shifter training. week fifteen though, i'll never forget this week, It was one of the most difficult and horrifying training i'd ever went through, the first day, they brought these giant humanoid creatures and we had to kill them before they got to us. The next three days after that they made us shoot the quantum rail gun three times an hour for the whole day. The last days were the worst, They put us in this room with this eight foot tall creature and we had to kill it before it killed us. Honestly out of the hundreds of thoughts about quitting this program this time was the closest.

That thing, was horrifying, the arms were the size of two people put together and it was only eight feet tall so its arms had to drag across the floor when it wasn't trying to claw my eyes out. It's head was so long it could barely keep it straight. The last day was the worst, I had to kill one more of those creatures in that room all alone to finish the day, I was handed a quantum rail gun and placed in the room. It immediately charged at me and I fired the gun but that damn recoil was so bad it barely got the top of its head. Green Juice splashed everywhere but it was coming toward me I only had a quantum rail gun and nothing else to use, I tried to dodge its arms but it got a hold of me, still spewing green.

It was just about to rip me apart until Allison blew it's head off, I dropped to the ground, absolutely paralyzed from fear of almost getting killed by one of those things, everyone else seemed pretty calm, might be because we was all shocked about what just happened. Eventually I got patched up, and the fifteen week training course was over, after 2 weeks they would cut most people and it would go down to 150. the selected people would then go on to two more weeks of specialized training and at that point after the two weeks there would only be 100 people left. I was honestly hoping they wouldn't pick me but I had two more weeks to go home and clear my mind of everything for now.

I will update y'all on my adventures I once had, but this part was only for training, part two will be about the actual job, I would rather call it hell, but, I better get off here for now.
