I woke up last night to knocking.

Three soft taps.

Not on the front door. On the bedroom window.

I live alone. One-story house. The backyard backs into woods, no fence. There’s a porch light, but it was off. The knocking came again—measured, too slow to be urgent.

I stood there for a minute, heart thumping, before I pulled the curtain aside.

Two kids were standing there.

They couldn’t have been older than ten. Pale skin. Dark clothes. One boy, one girl. Their heads were tilted just slightly—like they were studying me through the glass.

Their eyes were completely black.

No whites. No color. Just endless, lightless pits.

I stepped back, almost tripped over the bed.

They didn’t move.

Then, together, they lifted their hands and pointed toward the lock on the window.

That’s when I noticed something else.

They were mouthing words. Over and over. But not in sync.

The boy was saying: “Let us in.”

The girl was saying: “You asked us to come.”

I backed out of the room and locked myself in the bathroom.

I must’ve stayed there for over an hour, just listening.

No knocks. No footsteps.

Only whispering.

Low, impossible to place. Like it was coming through the walls. At some point, I must’ve passed out.

By morning, they were gone.

But there were wet footprints on the floor outside the bathroom.

They were inside at some point.

That was two nights ago.

Last night, they came back.

Only this time, they weren’t outside.

They were sitting in my kitchen.

Waiting.

The girl was drawing something on the table with her finger.

The boy was looking straight at me.

He smiled.

“Now that we’ve come,” he said, “we can show you.”

“Show me what?” I asked, before I could stop myself.

His smile widened.

“How it ends.”

I didn’t answer them.

I didn’t ask questions.

I just turned and ran.

Straight out of the kitchen, through the hallway, into the front room. I grabbed my keys, flung open the door—

And stopped cold.

The hallway was in front of me again.

Not the porch.

Not the night.

Just… the same goddamn hallway I’d just run through.

I backed up, slammed the door shut, turned around—

The kids were still sitting at the kitchen table.

Exactly the same. Same smiles. Same stillness.

Like they hadn’t noticed I’d left at all.

I didn’t speak.

I just tried again.

Back down the hallway. Turn the corner. Bathroom this time. I threw open the door—

The hallway.

Again.

Same floorboards. Same wall clock, ticking too slow. Same smell of damp wood and something rotting just out of reach.

I tried every door.

The bedroom.

The garage.

Even the coat closet.

They all led back to the hallway.

I don’t know how long I did it. I stopped counting after thirteen.

Eventually, I opened the front door again and found them standing on the porch.

Not sitting.

Not waiting.

Watching.

“We’re showing you,” the girl said softly.

Her voice didn’t echo right. It felt like it hit the inside of my skull instead of the air.

“Showing me what?” I choked.

The boy raised his hand and pointed behind me.

“Your end.”

I turned around slowly.

It was the hallway.

But this time, it was filled with doors.

Dozens of them. Hundreds. Too many to count, all pulsing slightly like lungs made of wood.

Each door had something carved into it.

Dates. Names. Symbols. Mine was at the center.

Scratched deep into blackened oak:
JUNE 14th – YOU LET THEM IN

The doors all creaked open at once.

And behind every one of them was me.

Versions of me.

Some screaming. Some still. Some hanging. Some whispering something I couldn’t hear.

One of them—pale, skin peeling like old wallpaper—looked right at me and said:

“You shouldn’t have opened the window.”

I ran.

I don’t even remember which direction. Just forward. Through one door. Then another.

But I’m still here.

Every door leads to another version of this house. Every mirror shows someone else’s face wearing mine. Every clock ticks down, and I don’t know what happens when it reaches zero.

I don’t think I’m in my house anymore.

I think I’m in theirs.

And the worst part is…

Someone else is living in mine.
