There was always a saying about King’s Crown that an old friend told me that I never truly understood until now. The saying goes, “Those who come to King’s Crown either leave on the throne or die by the sword.” Although, now I feel like King’s Crown never offered any of those things. All it was, was a prison with walls made out of bark and blood.


I had just turned ten, and my dad decided to celebrate by taking me to the park. Birthdays were the one day of the year when I got to enjoy myself as much as I wanted. This time around I was celebrating my birthday a little differently already, my mom wasn’t joining us. My dad and my mom went through a rough patch and eventually separated with my dad gaining custody. This was the first year that I would be spending without my mom, and my dad knew how much it bothered me. As soon as I got into the car, my dad turned to me with a smile that made his cheeks puff with excitement. “You ready, bud?” I nodded my head gently while looking down. My dad's smile turned into a frown as he put his hand on my shoulder, “I’m sorry mom couldn’t come this time.” He ran his fingers through my hair and patted me on the back. “We’re gonna have some fun okay? No more change of plans.” He turned the keys in the ignition, and we made our descent down the road. 


After some time, we finally arrived at our destination. I looked at the surrounding area and saw great trees enclosing the little area of land. There were people, standing with blank expressions standing stagnant all facing towards each other as if to mimic conversation. Just behind these were three snow-capped mountains that peaked over the trees to let their gargantuan stature be known. All noise had come to a halt and all I could hear was my own breaths going in and out. “This is The King’s Crown.” my dad explained. “It’s a nice little town just south of Berkeley. I thought it’d be nice for us to have our party here.” One person came forward, a man with long messy brown hair wearing an old leather jacket and black jeans that showed a lot more energy and excitement than all the other people he stood next to. “Adrian!” he cupped one of his hands over his mouth and shouted. “Adrian cmon we’re waiting for ya!” My dad put his right hand on my shoulder and said, “Cmon, let’s get the party started.” 


I exited the car and the first person to approach me was the man in the leather jacket, he put his left hand on my head and started ruffling my hair. “Eddy!” he exclaimed. “The last time I saw you, you were still shitting in diapers!” he started to laugh like an old hound dog and I grew extremely uncomfortable at his weird joke. My dad also obviously felt very awkward. “Adrian! C'mere man!” he embraced my dad a lot harder than I think he would’ve liked. My dad returned the hug and gently patted him on the back. “Hey Arthur.” he said in a gentle yet awkward tone. “How’re the wife and kids?” “They’re sitting right over there actually,” Arthur pointed to a woman who was sitting down with two children over on a table. “Hey Arthur, who’re all these people?” My dad asked the same question I had on my mind as well. “Well, to be honest I don’t know any of them that well. I think they’re all here for other reasons.” Arthur scratched his head in confusion while looking at the people surrounding us. “They were just kinda here before we got here, and they didn’t bother us so let’s not bother them, eh?”  


“Hello Adrian.” Arthur’s wife came over to us. “Hey Katie, how’s the new job going?” my dad answered. “Y’know nothing too out of the ordinary, just like any other job I’ve had: I’m just trying to get paid.” The adults chuckled, and then she turned her attention to me and pinched my cheek playfully, “And you must be Edward.” I nodded anxiously, nervous to be around so many people that I didn’t know nor had any intention of talking to. One of Katie’s children, a young boy who looked to be around 6 with long shaggy hair similar to his father's, hid behind his mother’s blouse while tightly gripping it. “This is my baby boy Keith. Say hello, Keith.” Keith waves at me nervously. The other child next to Keith was a skinny girl with brown hair, tan skin, with a purple hair clip, she averted my gaze as soon as I looked towards her. Katie turned to me, “You know my daughter, Brianna is around your age.” She turned away from me towards the girl who was anxiously standing next to her, “Why don’t you introduce yourself?” 


The girl came forward, combing her dark brown hair nervously, a shade of red lit up her tan cheeks as she looked up into my eyes. She didn’t speak and neither did I, I only continued to meet her gaze. The woman turned to Brianna, “Why don’t you two go off and play with Eddy while us grown-ups catch up? We’ll call you back when it’s time for cake.” Neither of us answered, we just went along with our parent’s suggestion because we had nothing better to do. “Wanna hang out in the woods?” She shrugged awkwardly. “I’ll take that as a yes.” 



We walked in the woods for a good while, sharing an awkward silence that was only occasionally interrupted by the chirping of birds or the snapping of twigs. I didn’t know how to talk to her or approach her, so I occasionally glanced at her only to immediately look away once she met my gaze.  Finally, I mustered the courage to ask one question:  “Do you like Batman?” She paused for a second and then gave me a look of confusion. “Aren’t you a little too old for Batman?” she said. I realized how weird I must’ve sounded, and immediately became embarrassed. “M-Maybe?” I said. “I still think he’s one of the best superheroes ever though.” She scoffed, “I mean, I wouldn’t be scared of anybody who wears their underwear on the outside, you know?” she joked smugly. “You know,” I started in defense of Batman. “Maybe that helps make people scared of him more. Would you wanna around a masked guy in his underwear shouting, ‘I’M BATMAN’?” She laughed pretty hard and turned to me, “You’re funny.” I chuckled with her awkwardly,  “Yeah thanks.” 


We walked in silence again for another couple of minutes until she moved in front of me and turned towards me which stopped me dead in my tracks. 

“Do you think I’m weird?” she asked me abruptly in a serious tone. 

“Should I think you’re weird?”

“No seriously, do I seem weird to you?”

She seemed a little more desperate this time to get an answer out of me, her brown eyes staring at me uneasily. 

“No you’re not weird. I think you’re pretty cool actually.”

She chuckled slightly, I could see she loosened up a bit after I said that.

“Why’d you ask anyway?” After I asked her that question she averted my gaze and I could see she was contemplating whether or not she wanted to tell me.

“It’s been around 6 months since I moved here to King’s Crown,” she said. “My mom said it would help us get a fresh start somewhere new.” She rubbed her left arm nervously. 

“When I first started school I never made too many friends. All the kids were assholes. I tried my best to fit in, believe me I really did try. Nobody wanted to hang out with me, called me names behind my back and stuff.”


“And the teachers never helped?” I had never experienced bullying before, since I stopped going to public school after 1st grade and my dad started to homeschool me. Bullying had always seemed like a myth, I knew about it but I never really saw or heard of it outside of what my mom and dad told me about it. 

Brianna sighed, “They never cared. I asked them to make it stop but they never really cared. So I decided to take it into my own hands. One girl, Brittney, came up to me and started teasing me calling me a freak and stuff. I never even talked to her before, but she didn’t like me for whatever reason.”

She started twiddling her thumbs nervously

“And then she pushed me, so I pushed her back. We got into a fight, and both of us ended up getting pretty beat up.” she said.

“Her mom turned out to have pretty close connections with the school and I got expelled and couldn’t attend any schools in the district.”
“What a bitch” I said. “And what about Brittney?”

“Nothing happened to her, they put all the blame on me. I was just trying to defend myself.”

 “I just wanna make sure you’re not one of those people.” She slowly met my gaze. “I don’t want another bad thing to happen here too.” She sniffled a little, I could tell she was about to cry. I grabbed her hand, “You’re just a little different, and that’s not bad. If we were the same as everyone else, that wouldn't be fun. Some people just can’t see that and plus, I like you because you’re different.” Brianna giggled, “I like you a lot too Eddy.” We both smiled at each other and walked deeper into the forest.



“Come here! I got something to show you!” Brianna beckoned me over to her as she stood on a hill as I watched from below. I scurried over to the top of the hill where she was waiting for me, and she pointed at something off in the distance. “There!” I looked at what she was pointing at and in the distance I saw the entrance to a cavern. This entrance was gigantic and rigid and had two stalactites that grew just above the entrance that made the entrance look like it had fangs. “Welcome to The Roundtable.” Brianna said as she urged me inside. “Not too long ago I came here with some kids I met at school, who told me this place is where King’s Crown’s founder's bodies are. Apparently, the day after it was founded, all of them disappeared mysteriously. Legend says they descended this very cave the day they disappeared.” “Why’s it called the roundtable?” I asked. “Well, the kids I came here with said that it’s called the Round Table cause inside it has multiple floors, all in a round circle shape.” She made a circular motion with her index finger as she was saying this. “How many floors are there exactly?” I asked curiously. “Geez, how many more questions are you gonna ask? I’ve only ever been to the first floor, I don’t know how long it goes on for.” She took one of my hands and looked over at me with a mischievous grin. 


“C'mon let’s go take a look.” Before I could reject the idea, she led me into the entrance of the cavern. Inside I was met by a horrible heat that emanated from the cave that blasted my face upon entrance. Graffiti coated the interior walls, and I could make out some words that were sprayed onto the wall: The Lobby.  Then I saw it; A large hole in the middle of the cavern, there was no light coming out of this hole. As I got closer the heat got more and more intense, the heat was coming out from the hole. I was already scared shitless, I didn’t want to be here. I backed up from the hole, my knees starting to buckle. “Maybe we should-” Brianna interrupted me, “Wanna go deeper?” My knees buckled further, I tried to push excuses out but I could only make slight grunts that were my pathetic attempt at forming a sentence. Just as I was about to push out words, I was interrupted by a loud yell of a young boy, “BRIANNA!”


 I heard someone running across the grass outside,  we came out and looked around to see her younger brother Keith running towards us, flailing his hands to get our attention. “Mom and Dad want you two back, it’s time to cut some cake.” “Can it wait till later?” Brianna snapped back. “They told me to get you a while ago, I’ve been looking for you guys. They’re gonna get mad at us.” Brianna groaned, “Damn it, sorry Eddy. I guess we’re gonna have to come back another time.” “Dang it,” I said, trying to put on a facade of disappointment. “Welp, there’s always next time.” As we started to walk back, I felt so happy I almost started skipping.  



“Can I ask you something?” I asked Brianna. 

“Sure.” 

“How do our dads know each other?”

“Our dads are best friends. They both lived over in Berkeley when they were kids. They’ve been apart until now, after college my dad moved to Colorado, and they’ve only barely been able to see each other since.”

We had finally reached the clearing where the party was, and I was confused to see that most of the people who were at the party were gone, it had only been an hour or so since we had left. We saw our families gathering around the table where the cake was set, when we saw an unfamiliar face. A man sat down hunched over on a table a little bit further away, wearing a trench coat and an eyepatch covering his left eye. He held a bottle in his hand and it looked like he was losing consciousness. “Who’s that?” I pointed at the man and my dad immediately grabbed the hand I was pointing with. “Don’t point at people, it’s not nice.” He looked over to the man, and back to me. “He’s one of Arthur’s friends, he owns a bar in town not too far from here.” “Why’s he slumped over like that?” I asked. “He’s a little….tired. The kind of “tired” that your mom can get sometimes.”My dad quickly ushered me and Brianna towards the table where the cake was, and started to sing “Happy Birthday” to me. I wasn’t as focused on the cake anymore, I was worried about the man. He didn’t seem phased at all at the ongoing party, he didn’t move a muscle only twitching once and awhile to hiccup.  The only muscles that were getting used were those in fingers, to hold the bottle firmly in his grasp. 


The song ended, and I blew out the candles, forgetting to make a wish while still eyeing the man. The cake gets cut, and I sit down with my dad who is very obviously hiding something behind his back while gently smiling at me. “What’s that?” I say peeking at whatever was behind his back. He took the object out from behind his back and revealed a gift. He slid it towards me, “Happy Birthday.”

I opened up the gift, and inside was a necklace chain with the Batman logo serving as a pendant with a letter inside right next to it. 

"We'll open this up later" my dad says as I grab the letter. 

My dad wraps his arm around me as I embrace him. I smile at my dad but his face is full of anxiety and discomfort, I can tell he has a lot on his mind. He opens his mouth, but he doesn’t say “you’re welcome” or “I love you.” Instead he says, “L-Listen buddy, I’ve put a lot of thought into this and I want to tell you now.” He sighs and looks down towards me, “I bought us a new house in King’s Crown. We’re gonna leave Berkeley behind us.” 

“Wait what? What about mom?” I asked in shock. 

“She agrees that this is for the best. She just wants some time away from us.”

“What about my friends? I don’t want to go away.” I say on the verge of tears.

“It’s gonna be better for us.” My dad tries to reassure me. He reaches out for my arm but I shake him off of me. 

"Why didn't you tell me?" I said growing increasingly frustrated, tears already starting to roll down my cheek. 

My dad rubbed his eyebrows and sighed, "I knew how you would feel. I knew you wouldn't want to go- can we just talk about this? Please?"

"What happened to no more changes?" I asked, my anger getting the better of me. 

"YOU ALREADY LEFT MOM, I DONT WANT TO LEAVE BERKELEY TOO. I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND AGAIN!" 

My dad gave a sad look after I said that, it immediately snapped me back into reality. I was dissapointed in myself and dissapointed in everything that was going on right now. So I did the only thing I thought of in that moment: I ran.




I ran off towards the woods while sobbing harder and harder the further I got away until I couldn’t anymore. 


I collapsed on the ground after running for a couple of minutes, trying to get some air, my breath escaping into the cold air. My heart was beating fast and my thoughts were racing, I felt like the ground could open up and swallow me whole. I was tired of change, I wanted everything to go back to how it was. I wanted my mom and dad to be in the same house again, I wanted to stay in Berkeley, and I wanted to stay near my friends. I felt like the world was against me, I was terrified that the people around me were leaving. With all these thoughts and emotions running through me, I started to cry. My crying was interrupted by a loud screeching noise that immediately snapped me back into the reality that I was in the forest in the middle of the night, by myself. I lifted my head off the ground to find the source of the noise. In front of men was the same hill Brianna had lead me up; It  was the Roundtable. I made my way up the cave and saw the source of the noise: 

The cave illuminated with a bright orange light that came from inside, I got up fully off the ground and started to head towards it. I stood before the entrance to the cave, the hole was no longer pitch black, but instead emanated light from it. A strange buzzing sound filled the surrounding area, getting louder and louder for every second that passed. I stepped closer towards the entrance of the cave and noticed two hands hanging onto the hole. “Who’s there?” I shouted into the cave. Just as I said that, I saw just who was inside that hole. The thing that was inside of the hole, peered its head out to me. Although it had the hands of a man, its head was that of a dog’s and it wore a crown on top of its head. We met each other's gaze and it gave me a toothy grin that wrinkled its face in a way no animal or even human would ever be able to. 


 It beckoned me closer, its eyes beaming with excitement. I blinked my eyes for just a moment and suddenly I was not outside the entrance anymore, but I was inside of the cave. I could feel the heat coming out of the cave as I fought the urge to come closer. My feet started to move again, and the dog-headed thing started to pull itself up and reached out for my ankles. Its hands were barely brushing up against my toes, the heat became so overwhelming I was convinced that if this thing didn’t immediately drag me down, then the heat would kill me instead. Suddenly, the thing unhinged its jaw and I could feel its hot breath brushing against my face. “PLEASE STOP!” I shouted while trying to escape its grip. I struggled against the thing, almost escaping its iron grip when it started to make a horrible gagging sound; Its whole body shuddering and jerking as the sounds got more and more intense. I could see something making its way out of its esophagus slowly slithering out of its disgusting mouth.

 It was a hand. The hand was dirty and had unkempt nails with dirt under them, the hand twitched and writhed while spit and phlegm dripped from its fingers. In this moment, I was trying to scream out for help, for somebody to help me; All that came out were short gasps and stutters that were mock attempts at words of distress. The hand started to slowly reach out towards me, the creature still gagging as it made its way out. “PLEASE! SOMEBODY HELP ME!” I shouted even louder this time hoping somebody would come to my rescue. “Please….!” I could hear multiple people shouting. “Somebody…help….me…” It wasn’t somebody outside, but it was the thing. The voice was coming from deep inside its throat. It was mocking me. The thing erupted in laughter while violently shaking and still gagging on the hand that was slithering out of its mouth. 


“PLEASE! I’LL DO ANYTHING!” I pleaded while resisting its grip and shutting my eyes tight preparing myself for whatever was coming next. Suddenly, I felt its grip loosen. I opened my eyes, and its mouth was no longer open. It was just staring at me with a blank expression. “I’ll do anything, just…please…” I said while gasping for air. “King’s Crown,” it said to me. “I want it.” I gripped my ankles tight once again. “All shall return to the roundtable.” it snarled at me as it dug its nails into my ankle. “Hey!” a voice boomed from afar. I turned over towards the entrance and saw a light from the distance. I turned back towards the thing, but it was gone. The light slowly faded back into the cave.



I opened my eyes, I was standing right in front of the hole, my toes just barely going in. I turned around, it was the man with the eyepatch holding a lantern and a shotgun. “Fucking hell! You stupid kid! You could’ve killed yourself!” he shouted at me in a drunken fit of anger. He ran towards me, dropping the bottle from his hand. “WHAT DID YOU DO?!” he shouted at me while shaking me violently. “WHAT DID IT SAY TO YOU?”  “I- I-” I couldn’t give him a proper answer, I was still making sense of it myself. “What  happened?” I heard another voice boom from the trees. It was my dad running towards us with Arthur, Arthur’s Wife Brianna, and Keith following just behind him. The man let go of me and turned his attention towards the bottle he dropped, picking it up  and shaking it to see if there was anything left inside it. “Found your stupid kid” he grunted and walked away from me to go sit down by a tree. 

 My dad came running towards me, embracing me tightly. “WHERE WERE YOU?!” I could tell he was angry but still relieved to have his child back in his arms. “DO YOU KNOW HOW WORRIED I WAS?! DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU? I-” I started to cry and my dad settled down and sighed. “I’m sorry for not telling you, I know you’re upset. I’m upset too, I just can’t lose you right now buddy.” he sniffled and I could see tears forming in his eyes. “I love you buddy. I’m sorry I can’t be a better dad, but I just want the best for you.” he said, his voice cracking with each word. I never saw my dad cry, he was always gentle and strong willed. I didn’t know that everything that was happening right now was affecting him so much. At that moment, among all the change that was happening around us, I realized the one thing that wouldn’t change; My father’s unconditional love for me. For the first time ever, he and I shared an embrace and cried in each other’s arms. 


After a couple of minutes, my dad regained his composure and he went over to talk with the man with the eyepatch. “Thank you, Mr-” he paused for a moment to allow the man to say his name.

“Landry,” The man said, scratching his chin.

“Right, Mr. Landry I just wanted to say thank you for finding my boy. If I lost him I-”

“Well you better keep an eye on him. Too many folk around here are incompetent assholes.” he said, slurring his words in his deep raspy voice.
"Now leave me be, I need my rest."  Mr. Landry said.
He looked at me and scoffed as he walked off into the forest.

 We talked to Brianna’s family soon after, although I wasn’t very responsive to any of their questions. I wanted to tell them what I had seen inside of that cave, but I couldn’t muster any courage to tell them about my experience. I said my goodbyes and left with my dad to go stay our final night at our old house. On our drive back home, I stared out the window thinking about what had just happened to me in that cave. What was that thing? Why did it say those things to me? I stared out at the pitch black road ahead of us, nothing was visible even with the headlights on and darkness basically swallowed the outside of our car. 

“Hey buddy.” my dad said in a tired tone. “I know things seem like they’re changing fast and don’t get me wrong I know how that feels. I want you to be safe, I want you to know how much I care about you.” he put his hand on my shoulder. “Life is all about changes kiddo. Things aren’t always gonna stay the same. You need to change with the times or else you’re gonna stay in one place for the rest of your life. Understand?” “Yeah.” I said while looking at my dad who was gently smiling at me and rubbing my shoulder. “We’re gonna get through this together-” Suddenly, the road was beaming with light; An orange light followed by an eerie screech. The last thing I heard was a truck horn blaring as I blacked out.


I woke up to the smell of smoke and the sound of sirens. I looked at where the smoke was coming from; A truck smashed into the front of my dad’s car. My dad was still at the wheel, he looked pale and was hunched over the wheel barely hanging onto consciousness. “The kid’s awake!” somebody shouted and I noticed that a policeman was standing next to me trying to help me maintain consciousness. “My…dad…” I muttered through the intense pain that came from my chest. “Don’t worry about your dad, my partner is with him right now. We’re trying to get him out. The fire department and paramedics are already on their way. You need to stay down, I think you broke some ribs.” 

He walked away from me and ran towards his partner. “No news on the truck driver?” he asked his partner who was still attending to my dad. “No trace of any driver. No footprints, no DO number, no nothing. It’s like the driver just never existed.” They both turned their attention towards my dad, who was still barely hanging onto consciousness. “M-my….boy..” my dad said faintly while out of breath. “Your son’s fine. Let’s focus on you, can you move at all?” one of the officers asked. “I-I can’t feel my legs. I’m running out of a-air.” said my dad. I could hear him gasping for air, every breath sounded painful and laborious. “Shit, his fucking legs are stuck inside the car!  We can’t take him out yet, he’ll start bleeding all over the fucking place! Worst case scenario is we try to take him out and fucking legs come off!” the partner of the cop who helped me angrily shouted.


 “Listen, stay here I’m gonna take the kid into the car, he doesn’t need to see this stuff. Stay put until the paramedics arrive.” The officer gently picks me up and lays me down in the backseat of the car. “Listen kid, it's gonna be ok. You don’t gotta worry about your pops, he’s in good hands.” he says trying to reassure me. “My name’s Officer Bentley, like the car. What’s yours?” “Eddy, like the guitarist.” I said while fighting the pain coming from my chest. Officer Bentley chuckled, “Alright little man. You see? We having fun.” I could hear my dad’s grunts of pain and agony coming from outside, Officer Bentley noticed and turned towards me. “Hey listen kid, I’ve seen a lot worse cases than this. I promise we’re gonna get your dad outta that car.” he said. “My partner knows how to handle these kinds of situations well. Everything will be okay-” 

Without warning, a loud boom followed by an orange cloud of smoke erupted from the car. My dad was still at the steering wheel, but now he was screaming as flames started to consume his entire body. Officer Bentley’s partner was on fire as well, rolling on the ground in an attempt to put the fire out. The air smelt like charcoal and burnt meat, I could hear sirens in the distance and they melded into the screams of my dad and created a horrifying harmony that rang in my ears. In the midst of this, Officer Bentley was frozen with fear. He fell down on his knees, his arms were the only thing holding him up and he made a confused mix of gagging and sobbing noises. The paramedics attend to my dad, getting him out of the car in a matter of seconds with the help of the fire department, but by the time they put my dad out on a stretcher he had already stopped screaming. My dad's body was burnt, most of his flesh had turnt into an amalgamation of ash and molten flesh. He made slight twitches, and silent gasps which resembled that of a fish out of water, struggling for its last breath.

 I cried out for my dad but deep down I knew that he was already gone. They carried me into a separate ambulance with Officer Bentley’s partner who was suffering from 3rd degree burns across his right arm, right thigh, and lower neck. His eyes would roll to the back of his head as he writhed and wriggled, but it wasn't in pain. He made breathless screams and gasps, resisting the paramedics who were trying to attend to him. He was barely conscious, but the entire ride to the hospital he would scream and make incoherent ramblings, but he kept repeating the same thing over and over again: “The dog headed man did it.”
