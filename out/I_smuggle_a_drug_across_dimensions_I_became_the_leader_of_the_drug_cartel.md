 Hi there, my NoSleepians! I have no idea who else to share this achievement with, given that I have no family or friends outside the cartel. Or more specifically, it's called the ‘Sagraten’ group. Even if I did talk about it to others, who would believe all this stuff about dimensions? Only you guys would. 

So, dimensions. We live in one dimension, but there are many adjacent dimensions with different types of people that can only be accessed by portals. Got it?

Next, the rundown on the drug I smuggled, called Karkara. It's actually a powder made from a leaf of the rare blue karkun tree, found on a dimension called Rohta'ara. Rohta'ara is a wild, forested place, save for the headquarters and operations of the various cartels. People buy the stuff for insane prices as it enhances the mind and body to unimaginable levels for a period of time, if you’re curious. So, our job is to transport it from Rohta’ara through a couple of dimensions like Earth to the locations the goods need to be going to. 

Or, at least, that's what I've heard so far. These things aren’t easy to understand

Anyways, enough of that. You want to hear about my rise to power in particular, do you?

After getting kicked out for being gay, being a broke 17 year old with no accepting family, I was forced to do drug deliveries and stuff for gangs. One day, a guy messaged me. Said he had a job for me. So, I met him and there started my participation in the Karkara smuggling cartel, bringing the dried leaves from one portal to the other. I didn't mind the conditions and loved that we got paid in gold, so I stayed.

About 6 months later, I did something that first got the attention of my direct superiors.

You see, there's a reason creatures from other dimensions don't do their own dirty work here. Compared to everywhere else, Earth is so densely populated and so unaware of other dimensions that they'll stick out like a sore thumb and be easily caught. Oh, and if the cops got onto us... 

That time, the cops did get onto us. We were delivering the goods when we were stopped at a police checkpoint, where they insisted on checking the truck. From where I was, at the back, I heard muffled voices of conversation.

"Open the back door. We need to inspect the cargo." instructed the police officer.

"Why?" the driver, my friend Pedro, asked. I could hear the fear in his voice, and it was for a reason. If they spotted the cargo, it would be game over for all of us. They would definitely seize the unusual dried leaves, as it resembles many drugs we have on Earth.

"We've been tipped off about a huge shipment of drugs coming this way. Now open it!"

As Pedro stalled for time while getting off the truck, my coworker Dennis whispered, “What do we do now?”

“What do you normally do?”, I asked.

“We, uh, make a run for it.”, Dennis explained, to which the other guy in the back with us nodded.

“Fuck that,” I said as they looked to me in surprise. “I got a plan.”

“That’s dangerous!”, he whispered anxiously as I heard the squeaky sound of the door being opened. As the door cracked open, I immediately dug the conveniently located packet of itching powder out of my pocket and flicked it all over the entrance. 

The officer, none the wiser, stepped into the cargo hold and shone his flashlight at us and the boxes.

“How many of you are in here?”, he asked.

“Three people in the back here, officer.” I responded.

“Now open one of- what the hell is this?” He asked, scratching furiously at his uncovered ankles and arms.

“Sorry Officer,” I nonchalantly explained, “Some of the dust from our cargo really triggers allergies.” As he peered at me with annoyance, my heart was thundering in my chest despite my calm demeanour outside. I was doing some grade-A prime bullshitting there, and if he figured that out I was fucked.

As the cop stepped out and instructed his partner to avoid entering our truck, I exhaled a breath I didn’t even know I was holding. That was incredibly tense, and the police would have doubled down had they actually inspected the cargo. I knew this, because the old-timers had several stories of police seizing the cargo for being suspicious. Several times, I had been regaled by stories of daring missions to recapture our goods.

Later, as we drove down the remote road, my coworkers lauded me.

“How the hell did that work even?”, they asked. “You're a genius!”, they praised me, the first time in my life I really heard such praise. Personally, I couldn’t believe it worked, as that was a last ditch idea I came up with on the spot. Luckily I had the itching powder on me, as I saved their asses that day!

By the time we reached the Manitoban depot where the portal to the next dimension was located, my boss seemed to have known of my attempt to ward off the police, given that he pulled me aside.

“Duante. What you did today? That saved the cargo. The higher-ups were pretty impressed.”

“Wait. That was fast, how do you know?”, I asked.

“We have cameras in the truck. We saw everything that unfolded. You’re sharp as a knife, kid. You’ll do well if you continue. Remember, the Karkara must always flow!”, he said, patting my shoulder before walking into the portal to oversee the shipment on its journey to the next dimension. Little did I know it, but that was when my path upwards opened up.

The grand series of events that eventually brought me here happened a few months later. This time, we were driving another shipment of leaves through a forest in Western Ontario. I was idly watching TikToks on my phone when I heard a sudden thump from under me.

“What the hell was that?”, I asked as we manoeuvred the screeching truck to the side of the road next to the forest.

“Tyre puncture!”, Pedro said. “We gotta get off the truck and change the tyre!”

As I hopped down from my seat, I noticed the huge nail we seemed to have driven over. So, that was the beauty that impaled us. As I walked towards the back to retrieve our trusty spare tyre, a teenage girl ran out of the bush and frantically waved her arms at us, startling me. 

Well, she was a sight to behold. Her arms and legs were covered in scratches, her clothes were torn up and she was panting heavily. While I was still apprehensive and shocked, Pedro first approached her. 

“What happened to you, dear?”, he asked.

“They- they- they’re coming! I got k- kidnapped and sold, and they’ll take me away! Help me get home!”, she said between breaths. As I heard that, white-hot rage boiled in me. She had clearly been failed by the people around her!

No. That was not happening to someone else. No one else would be left to suffer themselves, the way I was. 

Just as I was about to reassure her, some creatures came bursting out of the woods on the other side of the highway. The girl let out a shriek, thinking it was her kidnappers, before realising it was much worse.

Those creatures were monstrosities of nature, things that shouldn’t have existed in this place. They had perfectly triangular heads with one eye in each corner and a gaping triangular maw, along with a large ellipsoid body underneath it and 5 hairy legs. As they made a beeline for us and the truck, I realised that they were there specifically for our Karkara. Later, I would learn that these things were called the ‘wamas’ and that the rival cartels didn’t have any qualms about employing interdimensional monsters. The nerve of those little thieves… 

And with the most perfect timing, some men with assault rifles burst out of the bush. 

“Where’s that bitch? Find her!” one of them shouted at the others in a gruff voice.

As they scattered around the highway, Pedro warned me, “We’re only two people with pistols! We can’t fend off everyone!”

“I gotcha bro!”, I replied, before grabbing the girl’s shoulders and bringing her closer.

“Now listen babe,” I instructed, “If you want to survive, you have to follow every instruction I give you. To the letter. Understand?”

She stared at me fearfully with her black eyes, before nodding.

“You see those things over there?” I asked, pointing to the wamas. “Go behind them.”

She took a few tentative, wobbly steps before looking back at me in fear.

“Go!” I yelled. “They found us!”

“Duante! What are you doing? This is madness!” Pedro yelled from the back of the truck, where he was presumably attempting to protect the cargo.

“I have a plan!” I said, as one of the men approached me.

“Did you see a young girl here? She ran away from home!”, the guy asked, glaring at me.

“What does she look like? I think I saw someone run that way.”, I said, pointing in the direction of the wamas. Of course, they couldn’t see the wamas from that angle, so they took the bait and ran. A minute later, I heard screams and gunshots, and ungodly roars coming from the wamas. Perfect.

Immediately, I moved on to the next stage of my plan by clambering up the thin ladder on the back of the truck. It was slippery and I almost lost my footing, but I eventually jumped onto the top of the lorry and unsteadily balanced myself.

The view from up top was glorious, as the wamas and men fought and killed each other. As the men fired desperately at the advancing wamas, causing them to stumble and flip over like cockroaches, the wamas spat out sharp metallic fragments that cleanly downed the fifteen or so men. Behind the large wamas, the girl squatted down and hid herself out of sight.

As the last man fell down, dead, the remaining two wamas continued shambling towards the truck.

“A little help up here, Pedro?” I asked. Realising what I was going to do, he popped out of the truck and tossed a pistol up to me. 

“Shoot them straight in that goddamn mouth! That’s how you keep ‘em dead!”, he recommended. “Oh, and I’ll be changing the tyre!”

Catching the pistol, I aimed straight at the wamas and shot it.

Bang. And luckily, my shot struck true and it died immediately.

I aimed my pistol straight at the mouth of the last wamas, which was poised to break into our truck, and aimed straight at it. 

Bang. And it died cleanly before it could take a single leaf from us.

By that time, the girl ran into the truck and sat next to the driver's seat and Pedro finished changing the wheel of the truck. 

As I climbed into the back, I yelled, "We're kinda behind schedule! Let's start now!"

As he started the truck, he commented, "That was insane! Thank goodness it worked!"

The next leg of the trip went rather smoothly, until we stopped at a rest stop closer to our destination. There, I got off to stretch my legs and use the bathroom a bit.

As I came back, I peered into the driver's section and noticed that the girl was sleeping soundly. Well, that explained the lack of any conversation. 

But where was Pedro?

I noticed some noises in the back of the truck, so I opted to open the door.

"No! Don't open it!" his voice rang out as I opened the door. It was too late though, for I witnessed him shovelling blue Karkara powder into his mouth. We stared at each other in shock and betrayal. 

Now, you see, us humans can’t take Karkara. It’s way too potent on us, and whoever takes it normally gets an extreme amount of power. In most cases, they end up destroying everything around them before eventually dying from the overload once the effects end. Essentially, it’s too dangerous.

He was the first to speak, insisting that he was doing all of this to provide for his family and all that. I, of course, didn't buy that nonsense, instead opting to drag him out by his collar while he pleaded with me to spare him. A few minutes later, we reached an isolated spot of grass.

"Duante, please don't do this!" he begged. "I really need this! I won't hurt you, I promise!"

"If I waste even another minute, you'll become too strong to deal with. Sorry, but I must do this. Company policy is company policy, and it's for everyone's good. I'll provide for your family once you're gone." I tried to reason with him. I could already feel his grip on my sweatpants become harder and harder.

As he began sobbing, I put the pistol to his temple and fired 3 times, blood splattering all over my clothes, arm and pistol. But the deed was done, and the crisis was averted. Not wanting to bring Pedro's body all the way back to the truck, I surreptitiously dumped his body in a nearby river and washed the parts of me that got blood on them.

To this date, I’ve been supporting his family, since I managed to track them down.

After buying some food and water for the girl, I got into the driver's seat and drove off.  While I'd only driven trucks on little side roads before, I saw how the others did it and managed to figure it out. Luckily, the girl was incredibly tired and only woke up when we were a half-hour away from the destination. 

I would have talked to her more, but I was preoccupied with my own problems and the way I had to kill Pedro. I never wanted to end Pedro, we were great friends in fact, but in the end I was forced to. It was his decision to mark himself for death, and there was nothing I could do.

"Where's the other guy?" she asked while munching on her croissant. Observant girl. 

"I dropped him off earlier." I lied. Seemingly satisfied by the answer, she didn't press me further. 

As I drove into the old warehouse, I noticed an unusually large crowd milling around the place. Unusual because, well, no one really does that for a miserly delivery, of all things. And crowding isn’t encouraged to begin with due to the need to stay discreet.

As soon as I got off the truck, I was swarmed by the crowd, lauding me for the daring rescue of the girl and craftily fending off the wamas. In the hubbub, my boss along with some people I hadn’t seen before squeezed through to meet me while we unloaded the goods. While some of the other workers directed the girl to her resting compartments, I was ushered away by my boss.

“Good job, son. The higher-ups are impressed by how you managed to get rid of the wamas. They’ve been stalking us and taking our cargo for months! Now our enemies will never try anything like this again.”

“Wamas?” I asked.

“The rival cartels sic these creatures called wamas on us just to steal the shipments. You didn’t know?” he responded.

“No. Shouldn’t we have been better armed?” I asked.

“You didn’t use the weapons we packed in there?” he said suspiciously. “Perhaps Pedro took them.”

I didn’t know how to respond to that, so I just said, “Thank you.”

“So anyways, the bosses want to meet you. The people on top, those who work in Rohta’ara.”

For a moment, I simply stood there and looked at him in shock, mouth agape. “Me? G- go there?” I asked in shock.  

“Of course! You’ll be going to Rohta’ara tomorrow. I’ve heard that it’s quite important, as well. You’re being granted a position on the council. Good luck!” he responded.

Hearing of the council position, I quickly accepted. 

Curiously enough, they had dark circles of skin around their eyes, so they didn’t seem to be human.

“Who are the other two people?” I asked him, surveyi

“I’m Gakruth and this is Nabbri. We’ve come to show you the way to and in Rohta’ara, when you wish to come.” one of them responded in heavily accented English. It was rather obvious that they weren’t from Earth. 

“Alright, then. Oh, and what about the girl?” I asked my boss.

“Huh?” he responded, as though he had forgotten about her.

“What do we do with her?”

“She knows too much about our ways. She’ll have to stay with us, for the time being. Now, you have to prepare for tomorrow.”

So, I stripped off my blood-soaked clothes, refreshed myself and slept. Awakening the next day, I swiftly ate, wore my best clothes and met Gakruth and Nabbri.

Gakruth pulled out a thin metal stick and wrote something on my forehead.

“What’s that?” I asked. entered the emerald-green portal to Rohta’ara. 

I expected… something. Like, the feeling of me being disassembled and reassembled in the portal, or being sucked into a spiral, or something. I always wondered what it felt like, every time we shoved the boxes through the portal. Instead, I felt nothing. I walked in, and walked out on a whole new dimension. All that, when I hadn’t even travelled outside the country until I got this job!  


Rohta’ara was… breathtaking. I was told that the area we were in was only the side entrance, but from there, I could see the majestic red and blue forests carpeting the area, spreading as far as I could see. Behind me, sky-piercing, hauntingly beautiful mountains stretched across the landscape in long ranges. As I took in the view, Nabbri led to me some sort of pack animal to ride on. It looked like some sort of flattened elephant with the hooves of a zebra and a small head that reminded me of a meerkat’s. Oh, and it had two large black wings on its sides.

“It’s a karyuku. Here, this is what we use for transport and carrying goods.” Nabbri explained. I climbed on it as he instructed me to, and it trotted and flew alternatively on the well maintained shiny white path up the hill. Around me, I saw many such animals, some with the leaves on their backs, some carrying troughs of gold (give me the money baby!) and some carrying other people.

“I’m wondering….” I started.

“What is it?” Nabbri asked. “Out with it!”

“What does Rohta’ara mean even?”

“It is an archaic term for the red-and blue glow of the sunrise reflecting off the forest onto the pristine, bare white mountain cliffs.”

Sounded awfully specific, but okay.

Eventually, we reached the hill top and disembarked from the karyuku. In front of me lay a huge building, reminiscent of Greek temples in its gleaming white marble and astounding arches.

“Here,” Gakruth said proudly, “The headquarters of the Sagraten. On top of what we call Kankommala hill.”

“It’s… it’s majestic.” I responded. That was the only thought I had on my mind, for I had never seen such beauty before. Nothing on Earth could compare, quite literally.

Behind me, Nabbri cleared his throat. “That’s enough ogling, get in! We’re already late!”

Breaking out of my reverie, I let myself be ushered through the lavish corridors into a meeting room, where around twenty people already sat on a long table. It wouldn’t be accurate to say ‘people’, really, for most of them were a different species. Some had light red skin, some had large horns on their heads and a significant majority had pointed, cat-like ears. My companions bowed to them before exiting the room.

The magnificent being with pale skin and pointy ears sitting at the head of the table introduced himself in a melodious voice, “Greetings. I am Navraki, and these are my associates Parlraki, Tumbag, Phreked, Silris and Dusra.”, gesturing at each person around him.

“Greetings, I am Duante. I thank you for this gift of meeting these esteemed people.” I said, hoping it sounded formal enough. His only response was a thin smile.

“Now, we shall convene this council and discuss the reason we meet. Your talents will be required, for we will be at war.”

A minor stir rose among us, but died down as Navraki held up a bejewelled hand. 

“For years, we have competed with the Kalhuvum. Our rivals, for the uninitiated. They have many a time thwarted us, halted our plans, cut into our profits.”

“But from today, we will take over their business.”

“What do you plan?” asked Tumbag, his red chin moving furiously.

Navraki smiled, which unsettled me. “Your kinsmen, Tumbag.” he responded.

Tumbag looked confused.

“Our great allies, the Ghakrat.” Navraki pulled up a well illustrated, old-style map. “To explain it to you simpletons, here’s a map. Here, we will plunder the Kalhavum of their weapons. Using it, we will slaughter the Ghakrat wholesale. The Kalhavum shall be blamed for the slaughter, and their allies shall turn their backs on them, for slaughter of all is forbidden. Then, we shall destroy the Kalhavum. In one swoop, we will take control of the resources of both, and shall control the market with a majority.”

“Now, we shall all share our advice. Even the lowliest of us.”, he said, with a pointed glance at me. 

While most of them surprisingly gave noncommittal answers, I dissented when my turn came.

“I feel it’s unwise to betray our enemies like this. What if it goes wrong? We’ll be done for, then. This is too much risk!”

“You dare question me?”

“This is madness!” I yelled.

“You’re just a human. Never forget that. Now, you will follow my orders!” he said calmly as I seethed.

The plan he laid out for me, essentially, was that I would sneak into the Kalhavum base through a rather conveniently located shortcut and quietly take out anyone who resisted me. Once I got in, I’d call for several karyuku to come in to do all the dirty work of carrying away their weapons (apparently medieval weaponry like swords). Well, real convenient.

Yeah, that was my only job. But I saw how he saw me, and it reminded me of all the people back home, everyone who looked down on me. Nah, fuck that. I got thrown into this rather suddenly, but I was going out my own way.

He rather helpfully provided me with a map and left me alone, So, I cooked up my own plan as I rode down the hill.

First, I went to the utilitarian-looking, rocky base of the Kalhavum group. Told them that Navraki wished to meet the entire cartel immediately, all while pretending to tremble like a kid that lost their mommy at the store. I advised that they go to the main entrance, just to achieve my goal of maximum bloodshed.

“Gonna meet us huh, the little ‘kees? They’ll get a meeting! Go tell them that.” the magnificently horned leader responded in an incredibly thick accent that I could barely parse. I nodded, whimpering, “Yes, my Lord.” before leaving.

It rankled me to give random people so much respect, no matter who they claimed to be, but I needed it for my plan to work.

Next, I went to our good friends the Ghakrat group. The map was easy to follow, but still I went up and down hills and mountains and tread through dense forests to reach their place. Let me tell you this, even on a karyuku, all that movement tired the shit outta me. Oh, and everything in me hurt for days! But yeah, I had to meet them for the plan to work.

Of course, I told them that the Kalhavum and Sagraten were oh-so-jealous of their market clout and collaborated in a grand plan to end them. I let slip that the best way to stop them in their tracks was to go straight up to Kankommala hill and stop this betrayal in its infancy. Oh, and I advised that those shifty little Kalhavum might start fighting the Sagraten, as well. Technically, it was half-correct, wasn't it?

As they assembled their magnificent, destructive war machines and called out legions of military-like henchmen, I internally rubbed my hands with glee. I had no clue how time worked in Rohta’ara, but if my Earth watch and rough calculations were right, the Ghakrat would come right when the other two were fighting and join in the fun. 

After leading them to the hill, I opted to hide in a nearby cave and nap for the night (I came there at sunset), hoping that the scattered sounds of earth-rocking explosions wouldn’t awaken me too much. 

When I woke up (in the middle of said night), there was no more noise outside, save for the sounds of weird birds surrounding the remains of armour, weapons and bodies of twenty different species scattered all over the hill. It seemed that the armies had fought each other and almost wholly taken each other out in the process. While I was riding my karyuku up the hill, its frequent alternating between flying and trekking meant that my Nikes were ruined from all the dirt and gore lining the hill.

Well, whatever.

Once again, I touched down on the hard, rocky surface of the hilltop and made my way towards the main building, which had large chunks taken out of it from the battle. Along the way, I saw the bodies of the leaders and council members near each other, unmistakably dead. My plan had undoubtedly worked!

Now, our base looked more like a modern Greek temple, all run down. When I went in, I noticed that the place had been wholly converted into an infirmary of sorts, with the rest of the uninjured people clearing up the debris that was found everywhere. As I sauntered in, they all turned to me.

We stared at each other for a solid minute. Then, I spoke.

“What has happened to all those on the council?” I asked those assembled in the building.

They stared at me for another minute, before one brave soul spoke out. “They have all been slain. The leaders of all 3 major groups have been slain. You alone live.” she explained.

I nodded to show that I heard her. Immediately, cries of “All hail the new leader!” rang out across the area, echoes reflecting off the once ornate crumbling white walls. 

“Please,” I said, “Just call me by my given name. Duante.”. I was never one for things like titles, after all!

“As you wish, Duante.”

And there it was. No fancy ceremonies or transfers of title, but I was the leader, plain and simple. Maintaining the supply chain was not too hard, since I just had to send messengers and go around the portals saying “Yo guys, I’m the bossman now” to the buyers. The remaining bigwigs in the rival cartels, too, didn’t protest. The hubbub I stirred must have gotten them scared. 

I ended up learning a dirty secret as well, that the transport and sale of Karkara was actually prohibited in theory in many dimensions, which was how the entire cartel system and all the under-the-table discreet smuggling came to be. Cool, huh?

Alright, that was a bit of a long post, but there’s nothing wrong with a little boasting. I’m still alive, though, so congrats to me!
