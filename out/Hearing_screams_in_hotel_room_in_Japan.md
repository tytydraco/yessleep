I've been keeping this story private between me and my travel friends since my trip to Japan in the winter. We were staying at the APA Hotel in Kabukicho when I heard these cries coming from the main big corridor that connects all of the rooms top to bottom. If you've never stayed here before, imagine it as a giant vertical drop down that connects each floor where you can see to the very bottom. During this time, I was drying my clothes in my room with a hand-held hair dryer because the dryer in the laundry room was broken, when I heard a child screaming bloody murder for help from outside my door.  Mind you, I'm alone because one of my friends went on a solo day trip and the other fell asleep with the flu. This startled me quite a good amount as I had been sitting alone for the past two hours drying my clothes, and when I went outside, it was clear that it was a child screaming for help in English from a few levels above me. Other guests heard the noise and opened their doors, but when I made eye contact with them, they instantly shut them. I screamed back to the child with no response and distraught and afraid, I rushed downstairs to inform the front desk when I walked past two Asian children alone in the lobby, waiting for someone to come from the elevator.  The front desk clerk was slow and did not understand me, but she did take down my name and room number, which seemed unusual to me. After hearing what I heard and seeing children alone in the entrance, I immediately went back to my room and stayed there all night until we had to check out the following morning. The screams continued for a few hours, and when my friends returned to my room, they heard the same childâ€™s cries for help.  


This has stuck with me for a long time, more than anything else from my trip to Japan, because it may have been a case of child trafficking, and I did nothing about it out of fear of the yakuza and us going missing in a foreign country. I know I did not do the right thing and will get tons of hate for my cowardice actions but what could I have done knowing I could have put myself or my friends in danger if I were to interfere with a criminal organization like the yakuza.  What would you have done if given my situation?


P.S. I'm not saying this ruined my trip to Japan; 
I had the best time of my life there and learned a lot about myself during my travels. Because of this trip, I've met fantastic people from all over the world and made lifelong friends in Japan, and I'd never recommend not visiting this truthfully amazing country.  Though if you are staying in Kabukicho, please be safe and smart there are a lot of scams and illicit activity in the area and was our personal least favorite spot we visited in the country.
