I was 5 years old when this happened. It was a warm summer night.
I was woken up in the middle of the night by a loud thud. 

I sat up in bed and looked around my room. It was  dark except for the bit of moonlight shining through my window. 
Nothing in my room looked out of place or anything.
Assuming that I must have imagined the noise,I lay back down and tried to go back to sleep.

That was when another noise came. It sounded like footsteps. Someone was walking through the hallway.
It didn't bother me that much at first, I just assumed it was one of my parents, probably going to use the bathroom.
Then the footsteps stopped. There was only silence for a moment. The silence was then broken by...soft and quiet laughter.
Someone was standing in the hallway just laughing.

I sat up in bed again. I was perplexed. Who could be laughing in the hallway at this hour?
I started getting nervous. I wondered who it was.
I first wondered if it could have been either my mom or dad. My dad was always such a prankster. He always played jokes on me and my mother. He liked to give us a scare. 
But I wasn’t sure it was my dad laughing in the hallway. It was much too strange of a joke even for him, and my dad always made sure to get up early for work, so he wasn't likely to pull a prank late at night. 

The laughter continued for a little bit.
It was starting to get unnerving.

I then mustered up the courage to get out of bed and to check it out.
My young mind at the time must have naively thought that perhaps my dad wasn't going to work that day, and that he must have thought that it was the perfect time to scare me like this.
So I walked to the door, planning to put a stop on this joke.

My heart started beating a bit faster as I got closer to the door. I couldn't help but feel like something was off. 

But nevertheless I went on.

I put my hand on the knob. When I turned it, I heard the laughter stop.

I will always wonder if my life would be different had I not investigated the noise. I may be alive and well right now, but my mind will always be plagued by what I saw that night.

I opened the door. There was someone standing in the hallway, staring at me. 

That someone, was me. Or at least something that had taken my form.

It was like staring into a mirror. I saw myself, standing there in the hallway. It wore the same blue striped pajamas I had. 

It had the same black and curly hair that I did. It had the same brown eyes that I did. It shared the olive colored skin that I had. 

It looked almost exactly like me. But, even as a young child, I knew there was something deeply wrong about it.

It's face was completely devoid of any human emotion. It just stared at me with a cold and piercing gaze.

My heart sank into my stomach. I stared at, feeling deeply terrified. I was paralyzed. We just stayed in those positions, having a kind of staring contest that felt as if it went on for an eternity.

That was when it's eyes suddenly started glowing red.

I stared and watched as it's skin started turning gray.

Suddenly it started sprinting towards me. 

I screamed and slammed the door shut. I locked it  as tight as I could. 

The thing slammed into the door with a loud thud.

I screamed as loud as I could, desperately calling out for my parents.

After what felt like forever, I heard a knock on the door. I heard my parents calling my name. They sounded terrified. 

I quickly opened the door and threw myself into my dad's arms. 

I told them that a monster almost got me. I sobbed as I told them what happened. 

They didn't believe me of course. My dad just rocked me in his arms and told me that it was just  a bad dream. 

I went to sleep in their room that night. I didn’t want to be left alone. 

I told them what happened again in the morning when I was calmer. They still didn't believe me, and they tried reassuring me that it was just a nightmare.

That explanation never sat right with me, and it still doesn't. 

Even then I knew for a fact that what I saw was real. I can't explain what It was or why it looked like me, but I know it was real.

The odd thing was that there was never another incident like that again. I suppose you think I'm lucky, but I wouldn't be so sure.

That experience haunts me to this day. Anytime I look at my reflection, I swear that for a split second I see my reflection change. For a split second I see myself with those red eyes and the gray skin.

I hope that someone reading this has had the same experience that I had. It would help me not feel like a lunatic. And I hope someone might be able to give me a possible explanation for this.

If you have any possible explanation, then please share it with me. It might help me get over this thing.
