I was at some weird place (maybe a nightclub) with my mom and some other fellows. I left the strange place and went outside, just to be greeted by another car that is merely identical to my mom’s car, and out steps a lady dressed in the same clothes my mom usually wears. A grey sweater with a flow in the middle, her sneakers/tekkies (also grey) and I forgot the pants, but I think it was her casual grey pants as well. She got out of the car to greet me but just stood still and stared at me. “Hello?” I mustered expecting a response from her. Silence. Just pure eery silence the only thing making noise were the cars on the highway next to this establishment.

 Soon enough, however, I notice a car, driving up and down the highway, except, it would pop up at irregular times, sometimes it would take 5 minutes, sometimes it would take 3 seconds. And the that made it more eery was the fact that it was my mothers’ car. 3 of my mothers were in the exact same place at the exact same time. Then out of the blue, someone told my father died in an accident. I can’t remember who it was, but I do think it was one of my mothers. As I was being told this news, faint screaming illuminated out of the darkness and there it was, my dad’s car driving into the parking lot of this weird place, I followed it, screaming “DAD, DAD” but he never stopped so I chased after it hoping to know what happened when his car stopped.

 As I was chasing his car, I started thinking to myself. How come he is dead, but his car is driving. I soon reached the parking lot it was placed at, but it wasn’t there. I stood there, confused, puzzled, and weirded out. That’s when I noticed a shadowy figure in the darkness calling my name. It darted towards me, and I ran away, but that’s when I saw who it was, it was my aunt. I hugged her with tears rolling down my face wondering what the hell is happening. Then I see people walking out of the weird place, covered with blood. One person had a missing ear and blood all over her left side of her chest. Another was bleeding by her nose, but everything was relatively intact. I thought those people got into a fight. My aunt asked if I was okay, and I mumbled “yeah.”  
  
As I mumbled my response, the surreal scene around me continued to unfold. The weird place, now illuminated by a strange, otherworldly glow, revealed more details that I hadn't noticed before. The architecture seemed to shift and warp, creating an unsettling atmosphere. The air was thick with an unidentifiable scent, adding to the dreamlike quality of the surroundings.  
  
I glanced around, trying to make sense of the bizarre events. The highway next to the establishment, once a source of distant noise, now seemed to pulse with an eerie rhythm. The cars passing by took on distorted shapes, their headlights casting long shadows that danced along the walls.  
  
In the midst of the chaos, I noticed a peculiar figure emerging from the crowd near the entrance. It was a person draped in a cloak, their face hidden in shadows. The figure moved with an unnatural grace, and as they drew nearer, I felt a strange mixture of fear and curiosity.  
  
The mysterious figure approached me, extending a hand as if to offer guidance or a revelation. Hesitant, I reached out, and as our fingertips touched, a flood of images and emotions rushed through my mind. Visions of forgotten memories, unresolved conflicts, and buried emotions played like a vivid montage.  
  
Suddenly, the scene shifted again, and I found myself standing in a vast, desolate landscape. The colors were muted, and a chilling wind whispered through the emptiness. In the distance, I saw a solitary figure – my father. He stood, not as a specter of the past, but as a symbol of resilience and wisdom.  
  
A sense of understanding washed over me, and I realized that the dream was a manifestation of my subconscious grappling with the complexities of life, loss, and the passage of time. The multiple versions of my mother and the distorted reality represented the fluid and ever-changing nature of relationships and circumstances.  
  
With newfound clarity, I turned to my aunt, who had been a constant presence in the dream. Her reassuring smile hinted at a deeper wisdom, as if she held the key to unlocking the mysteries within myself. As we walked together through the dream landscape, the once chaotic and unsettling environment transformed into a serene dreamscape.  
  
The dream, now reaching its resolution, left me with a lingering sense of introspection. As I explored the symbolic landscapes of my subconscious, I understood that dreams, however strange and surreal, often carry profound messages about our innermost thoughts and emotions. With this realization, I embraced the surreal journey of the dream, ready to decipher its meaning in the waking world.
