Draco Malfoy found himself in a strange and twisted dream world, where everything seemed to be distorted and surreal. As he wandered through the dream landscape, he came across a gigantic apple that shimmered with an otherworldly glow. 
 
Intrigued by the unusual sight, Draco approached the apple and reached out to touch it. As his fingers brushed against the smooth skin of the fruit, he felt a strange surge of energy coursing through his body. The apple seemed to be pulsating with a strange power, drawing him in like a moth to a flame. 
 
Without hesitation, Draco took a bite of the apple, feeling its sweet juices burst onto his tongue with an intoxicating flavor. As he savored the taste, he felt a wave of euphoria wash over him, filling him with a sense of pure bliss. 
 
But as he continued to eat the apple, Draco noticed a strange transformation taking place within him. His body began to contort and shift, his skin turning a deep shade of red as his limbs elongated and twisted in unnatural ways. 
 
Panicking, Draco tried to stop eating the apple, but he found himself unable to resist its seductive allure. He felt a strange compulsion taking hold of him, driving him to consume the fruit with a feverish intensity. 
 
And as he devoured the apple, Draco felt a strange sensation building within him, a primal urge that he could not ignore. Without warning, he found himself drawn to the apple in a way that defied all logic and reason. 
 
With a trembling hand, Draco reached out to touch the apple once more, feeling a surge of desire course through him like a raging river. And in that moment, he knew what he had to do.

And then, in a moment of pure ecstasy, he began to thrust himself against the apple with a feverish intensity, his body wracked with pleasure as he surrendered himself to the strange and forbidden desire that consumed him. 
 
As he gave himself over to the overwhelming sensation of pleasure, Draco felt a strange sense of liberation wash over him, freeing him from the constraints of his own inhibitions and allowing him to fully embrace the wild and untamed passion that burned within him. 
 
And as he moved against the apple in a frenzy of desire, Draco felt himself being consumed by a powerful force that transcended the boundaries of reality and reason, pushing him to the brink of ecstasy and beyond. 
 
In that moment, Draco understood that he had unlocked a door to a realm of limitless possibility, where the boundaries between dream and reality blurred and twisted in a whirlwind of primal desire. 
 
And as he climaxed in a burst of ecstasy that rocked him to his very core, Draco knew that he had experienced something truly extraordinary, something that would change him forever and awaken within him a hunger for the forbidden pleasures of the dream world.
