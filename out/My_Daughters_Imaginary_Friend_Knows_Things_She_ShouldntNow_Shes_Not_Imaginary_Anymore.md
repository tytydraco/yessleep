I should’ve known something was wrong when my daughter, Lucy, told me her new imaginary friend had a last name.

“Her name’s Iris Weaver,” she’d said, matter-of-fact, clutching her stuffed rabbit. “She lives in the wall behind my closet.”

I laughed at first. Kids are weird. But the details started piling up—details too specific to be made up. Iris liked strawberry ice cream. She hated thunderstorms. She used to have a brother who drowned in a creek when she was “almost seven.” Lucy even drew pictures of her. Pale girl, long black hair, black eyes. Not brown—black. No whites.

“Why doesn’t Iris come play when Mommy’s home?” I asked once, joking.

Lucy’s answer made my skin crawl.

“She says Mommy doesn’t believe, and that makes her angry.”

The next day, our cat, Pickle, clawed a hole through Lucy’s closet wall. I found him dead that night in the hallway, mouth full of blood and fur, eyes wide open. The vet said he must’ve had a seizure.

I tried to ignore it. Told myself Lucy was just creative. Kids invent things to cope, right? Her mom had left a year ago. Maybe Iris was just grief in a cute dress.

Until Lucy stopped sleeping.

“She watches me,” she whispered one night, trembling under the covers. “From the closet. She doesn’t blink.”

I moved Lucy into my room. Bolted her closet door shut. Set up a baby monitor just in case.

That night, I heard whispering.

It wasn’t Lucy.

It wasn’t English.

The monitor crackled with a voice that sounded like water—gurgling, dripping, gasping. It got louder, until it was shrieking.

I ripped the plug out of the wall.

The next morning, Lucy was back in her closet. I found her sleeping in the fetal position with dirt under her fingernails and mud streaks on her face. The bolts hadn’t been tampered with.

I checked the wall where Pickle had scratched. It felt…soft. Like wet plaster. I pressed harder and the drywall caved in—like a bubble. Behind it was a cavity. Too large to be a normal wall gap. Almost like a narrow hallway.

I didn’t go in.

That night, I set up a camera in the hallway, facing Lucy’s door. I was too scared to put one in her room.

At 3:13 a.m., the hallway camera glitched—then showed the door creak open on its own.

Then a hand—white, too long, with six fingers—wrapped around the edge and pulled the door shut again. There was a low scraping noise, like something dragging across the floor.

I showed the footage to a friend who works in video editing. He went pale and asked, “What’s wrong with her arm?”

“It’s not Lucy,” I told him.

I started sleeping in Lucy’s room. Nothing happened for three days. I thought maybe it was over. Maybe my mind had snapped from the stress, and now it was going back to normal.

Then, Lucy whispered something that cracked me.

“She wants to be born again,” she said, not looking at me. “She said she needs skin. That you’d fit.”

I checked my chest in the mirror later that night. Just to see.

There were fingernail marks—deep ones—below my ribs.

I took Lucy and drove to my sister’s house three towns over. We stayed the night. Lucy was quiet, but didn’t cry. I started to think maybe it was working.

Until I heard the closet door open in the guest bedroom.

I ran in, expecting to find Lucy sleepwalking.

But she was awake, staring at the wall.

“Iris came,” she said. “She’s mad we left. She said you promised.”

“I never promised anything.”

“Yes, you did. The night Mommy left. You said you’d do anything to keep me safe.”

Lucy smiled.

“She heard you.”

That night, I had the worst nightmare of my life. I was in the wall—her wall—and it went on forever. A wet, rotting tunnel of pale arms and faces whispering my name, over and over. I felt something growing inside me, like roots. When I woke up, my stomach was bleeding. I’d carved something into it in my sleep:

I.W.

I’m not safe. Lucy isn’t safe. We can’t run. She’s in the walls. She’s in me now.

I’m writing this not for help, but for warning. If your child says they have an imaginary friend, listen. Ask questions. Check the walls.

Because Iris Weaver is looking for a new home.

And she only knocks once.
