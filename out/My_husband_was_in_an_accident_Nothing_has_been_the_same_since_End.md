It had been a week since I had been attacked by Jeff, and that cold feeling still hadn't left me. I returned home after Jeff's attack, hoping that the chill was temporary, but it lingered. I tried to go to the doctor, but they could not find anything wrong with me, at least physically speaking. I ended up moving back in with my parents, and isolated myself in the room where I was sleeping most of the time. I barely emerged to eat, unable to bear making small talk. The only time I left the house for nearly a week after was when I was forced to.

I had spent most of another day sitting in the room with the bare walls and blackout curtains, keeping those drawn tightly. I hadn't made or received any phone calls since the attack and decided I would break that streak. I called Terry, but he didn't answer which I kind of expected. I was legitimately surprised when he returned my call an hour later. I decided to answer after a few rings.

“Hello?” I said, voice quiet and emotionless.

“How are you doing?” my former husband asked, foregoing the usual pleasantries.

“Not very well. That weird, cold feeling has gotten worse.” I admitted.

“Have you went to the hospital?” he pressed, but something about the question seemed insincere.

I hesitated to answer.

“I have, but they didn't find anything wrong with me.” I replied.

“That's a relief.” I actually believed that statement.

We talked a little longer, but neither of us mentioned trying to meet up again that time. I went to bed early and woke before dawn, sweating but shivering beneath the heavy quilt I was covered with. I sat up, and moved toward the window, convinced that it had been opened somehow. It was still closed securely, but once I was out from under the covers my temperature seemed to drop even more. The shivering got to the point that my bones ached and my jaw clenched. I grabbed the blanket from the bed and wrapped it around myself, sinking to the floor.

I rubbed at my exposed biceps and forearms until the shaking slowed down again. I kept myself wrapped up even as I left my room, moving toward the thermostat in the hallway. According to the gauge, the house was a pleasant seventy degrees. That didn't jive with the way I felt, and I considered driving myself to the Emergency Room, but the way I was shaking deterred me. I ended up calling my father's cellphone. He rushed home and quickly collected me, walking into the ER with me when we arrived.

I was quickly triaged, leaving my father in the waiting room, and put in a room away from everyone else. They even brought me a heater and warm blankets. The doctor entered, smiling over the top of the clipboard he was holding in his hands.

“Hey, so what's going on today?” he asked, even though I knew he had just looked at the notes.

I explained everything to the man, the attack, and this feeling that had followed. He nodded along and raised his eyebrow when I told him about the wound. After I finished speaking, he stood and claimed a pair of rubber gloves and a mask.

“Remove your shirt, I want to take a look at the wound you were talking about.” he told me, opening a drawer, extracting a few tools and cotton swabs from their rightful places.

I did as I was told, the shaking growing worse as he approached me. I reached out and pulled the heater closer to me even as he stooped down to take a look at my shoulder. He prodded at it with the tip of the swab and I inhaled sharply.

“What did you say bit you?” he asked.

“A dog.” I lied, as I had upon my first visit.

“Are you sure? Because these look a little odd for a canine bite.” he said, poking at the sore area again, this time with a metal instrument.

I flinched and leaned backward after a second of contact.

“I'm afraid that looks to be getting infected.” he told me, nodding toward my chest as he stood up.

“So what does that mean?” I asked, hoping I wouldn't have to stay.

“I'm going to give you some medicine, and I want you to follow up with me in five days if it doesn't improve.” he ordered, then he left the room, returning moments later with two small slips of paper.

I had to borrow the money from my parents to pay for the antibiotics and pain pills. The shivering continued even when I was back in my own bed, under a pile of blankets. My father picked the pills up on his way home from work, and I forced myself to go down and sit at the table with them, taking the drugs along with the meal my mother had cooked. I went to bed pretty much immediately after, not even bothering to shower that night. I didn't have any trouble falling asleep. Once I did, I had a dream that I was swimming in a dark ocean.

It was not an unpleasant experience as I dove beneath waves that rose above my head. That was, until I felt myself getting swept up in the undertow. It pulled me down into the depths, and as I sank, I began to panic within the dream. Somehow, I broke free and began swimming for the surface. When I surfaced, I snapped awake. My shoulder ached and stung, the pain increasing each time my heart would beat. I stood and walked to the bathroom, a dizzy spell hitting me in mid-step, sending me reeling into the wall to my left.

I stood there, sweating and leaning into the cold plaster for what seemed like minutes until I was stable enough to continue to the bathroom. I stood in front of the sink and did not like what I saw staring back at me. I was pale, my face beginning to look hollow and pale. My forehead seemed larger than before, almost protruding from my skin, which seemed stretched far too tightly over my skull. My lips were chapped and slightly swollen. I pulled the sweat-soaked t-shirt up over my head, exposing the wound to the air and harsh lighting.

That sent a fresh burst of pain through my shoulder and the upper part of my chest. I felt my head spin again and reached out with my good arm to steady myself on the sink, my eyes clenched tightly closed as I willed myself to stay conscious.

“Are you okay?” my father's voice came from somewhere beyond the spiraling darkness that I found myself in.

I tried to open my mouth to speak, but could only cough. Each spasm of my chest made the pain worse and my dizziness became almost unbearable. I began to fall, but couldn't stop myself, and barely remember my father opening the door and rushing inside. I woke in the hospital, feeling much better than I had before. My mother and father were sitting at my bedside, sleeping with their heads leaned back against the wall. My stomach rumbled and cramped. The noise was so loud that it woke my mother.

She smiled when she saw my eyes open and stood, moving to my bedside, pressing the button to call the nurse for me. I found that my wrists were bound in soft restraints, as were my ankles.

“Why am I tied up?” I asked, still kind of sleepy. I suspected they had given me something to help me rest.

“It was for your own safety. You had some kind of seizure and they worried that if it happened again you might hit yourself or someone else.” she informed me quietly.

When the nurse entered the room she stepped up next to my bed on the opposite side, jotting down the readings on the machine that measured my vital signs before turning her attention to me. My mom returned to her seat and remained quiet.

“If you feel like you're okay, we can remove the restraints.” she informed me rather than giving any kind of greeting.

I nodded my head.

“I feel fine. Just a little sleepy, and maybe hungry, too.” I replied. The woman gave me a little smile, and nodded her head.

“The sleepiness is because of the anti-seizure medication most likely. I will see about getting you something to eat in a little bit.” she told me before leaving the room.

I tried to lay back and relax hoping that if nothing else the woman who had given me life would go back to sleep if I couldn't. She didn't. Instead she resumed fussing around me until the nurse returned with a small sheet of paper with my meal choices on it. I opted for oatmeal and fresh fruit and a cup of jello. I ate with real gusto and started to feel more awake and aware after filling my stomach. I was even allowed to get out of the bed and take a walk through the halls. That wore me out and I fell asleep shortly after my parents returned home.

I woke up hungrier than I had been the first time around, and summoned the nurse. I ordered myself lunch and went for a little briefer walk around. My parents returned a few hours later, and not long after, I was whisked out of the room for an MRI and some other tests. The doctor informed me that they had found something concerning in my bloodwork.

“What does that mean, exactly?” my father interjected before my mother or even I could speak up. All of our heads turned toward him.

“It means that we don't know why, exactly but your son's white blood cell count is a little elevated. It could be a response to the antibiotics, but we want to monitor him.” the man with the clipboard replied dryly.

That seemed to satisfy my parents, so I kept my mouth shut as well. Eventually my parents went home again, and I drifted off after dinner. I woke less than an hour later with a gnawing feeling I my gut, and the urge to get up and walk around again. I called for the nurse again and she accompanied me through the halls once more.

“Can I go to the cafeteria?” I asked.

“I don't see why not.” she answered, taking the lead.

We stopped at the shiny metal elevator doors next to the nurse's station. She pressed the down button, and a few seconds later, the doors rolled open and we waited for those already in the small car to exit before we stepped inside. The doors slid closed and the cables gave a slight jerk before we began to to descend. The woman took the lead again and I followed her into the dining area, taking my place in line before moving up to select my meal. The nurse sat near me, cradling a paper cup of coffee between her hands while she waited for me to finish eating. It didn't take me very long at all, and we went back up to my room.

I was exhausted and my eyes closed while the woman reconnected the wires to the sticky pads to my torso and put the oxygen sensor on the tip of my finger. I was asleep before she left the room, and once again found myself adrift on an endless ocean, only a dark, starless expanse above me. This time, I got the sensation that I was not alone, and when I turned my head, saw Jeff's face, pale and contorted in rage as he swam toward me. His hands reached out, though they were more like those of a bird, terminating in cylindrical talons.

I felt the very real, vise-like grip enclose both of my wrists, and he pulled me beneath the surface of the inky water. This time I could not fight my way back to the surface, and I woke up in the midst of another seizure. My arms and legs were rigid, fingers and toes spasming as my limbs thrashed about. My eyes rolled into the back of my head and I blacked out. This time there were no more dreams. I didn't wake back up until the morning, my bladder aching and feeling as if it were going to burst inside my body. I was restrained again but was able to reach the call button.

“What do you need?” the man who had replaced my usual nurse asked.

“I need to use the toilet.” I said quietly. My body shifted uncomfortably against the thin mattress below me.

“Give me a minute to get the cuffs off of you.” he replied, and then unbuckled the soft loops around my ankles and wrists.

I rubbed my left wrist as he helped me up out of the bed.

“Take it easy. We don't want you having another seizure.” he told me softly as he disconnected the machine from the pads on my torso. I gently pushed myself into a sitting position, and scooted off the bed, and onto my feet.

He stayed at my side, my hand on his forearm for support, my body feeling much weaker than it had before. As I walked, the smell of something warm and delicious filled my nostrils. My stomach rumbled loudly enough that I know the man beside me heard it. We paused, and just as our eyes met, I lunged forward, my teeth digging into the side of his neck. He punched at my head and body, but I didn't even register the impacts. All that I could feel was the hunger. I drank the man's blood, the warm, iron-tinged liquid seeming to sate the feeling in my lower abdomen.

I eventually pulled away when I heard the rush of footsteps coming in our direction. I raised my head in time to see a group of hospital security and other staff rushing toward us, their shouts seeming foreign to my ears. I stood and turned, running away, sprinting back toward the room where I had been before. I jumped at the window, easily shattering the glass with my body which I could feel was no longer truly the one I was born with. The ends of my digits were splitting, the bone becoming sharp and talon-like.

I felt my tongue split and my teeth burst through my gums as I hit the ground. I sniffed the night air, the sweet scent of blood around me, and disappeared into the night.

I still live.
