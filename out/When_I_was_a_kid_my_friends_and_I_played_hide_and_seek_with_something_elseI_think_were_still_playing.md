When I was a kid, my friends and I used to play hide and seek with something else.  
I think we’re still playing.

I’m scared for my life. I don’t know how or why it’s back. It shouldn’t be here. It’s been eleven years — eleven fucking years. I just want to forget it, but it doesn’t want to forget me.  
Let me start from the beginning.

It all began in 2014 when I was nine years old. I’d say my childhood was perfect — a family that loved me, good friends, a nice school, and all the fun things you do as a kid. We played games like hide and seek.  
Even now, I can’t understand how a simple game like hide and seek would go on to destroy my life. But enough about my childhood.

Everything started on November 3rd, 2014. I had a friend group made up of three people: Jack, Lilly, and Jakob. During lunch break, Jakob asked if we wanted to play hide and seek in the forest behind his house after school. We all said yes, of course. I mean, who would say no to a game of hide and seek?  
Looking back, I wish I had.  
Not because I’m 20 now, but because of the trauma from the last time I ever played it — that time.

So, as I said, we all said yes. A few hours after school, we were at Jakob’s house. It was around 5 PM, which in November means it's nearly pitch dark outside. But for being nine years old, we were pretty brave — no one was scared of the dark. We just thought it made things more fun and challenging.  
Since no one ever wanted to be the seeker, we usually did a rock-paper-scissors tournament to decide who would start. We were just about to begin when:

“Can I play too?”

The voice nearly gave me a heart attack.  
We all turned around. In the light of a streetlamp, we saw a boy about our age. I asked Jakob if he knew the kid, but he didn’t.  
The boy just stood there, waiting for an answer.  
We huddled in a circle and quickly discussed whether to let him join. The conversation didn’t take long. Of course, we’d let him play. Even if we didn’t know the guy, he hadn’t done anything to us.  
Jakob asked what his name was.

“David,” he said.

Jakob asked where he lived. David said he lived a bit into the forest. Lilly asked what school he went to. He said he was homeschooled.

Now that we knew a bit more about the kid, we could start.  
But there was a problem — now that we were five, we couldn’t do our usual rock-paper-scissors tournament.

“I can start,” said David.

Since none of us wanted to be it, no one objected. We had one minute to hide before David would start looking.

As soon as David started counting, we all ran into the forest to find hiding spots.  
My plan was to get as far away from David as possible without getting lost in the huge forest.  
After a little while, I still hadn’t found a good spot, so I jumped into a random bush and buried myself in it as much as I could. Once I got comfortable, I was prepared to sit there a while.

After some time, I was sure the minute was up. I sat in that bush, trying not to move or make a sound.  
After what felt like hours, I was still alone in the bush, surrounded by complete silence — not even birdsong.

The silence was suddenly broken by a loud scream. I was so shocked I nearly jumped out of the bush.  
The scream stopped as suddenly as it started.  
I sat back down, trying to make sense of what I’d heard.

Had David scared someone? But the scream lasted too long — at least three seconds.  
Maybe he fell and got hurt?  
I decided to stay in the bush. Maybe he *had* just scared someone, and I didn’t want to get caught because of it.

About three minutes later, I started hearing rustling in the leaves on the ground.  
I froze completely.  
The rustling got closer and closer.  
I tried taking the smallest breaths possible so David wouldn’t hear me.  
And then… silence.

I realized I’d been closing my eyes, so I opened them.  
And I froze.

At first, I didn’t understand what I was looking at.  
An animal? No — I’ve never seen an animal that looked like *that*.  
A person? No, that wasn’t right either.

It was pitch black and tall — at least two meters tall.  
So thin.  
Its feet were huge, with two long sharp toes. Claws, maybe.  
Its arms were long, and its hands enormous — fingers so long they nearly touched the ground.  
Whether those were claws or just sharp fingers, I couldn’t tell.  
It was so dark — darker than anything I’d ever seen.  
I could see its ribs so clearly, and behind them, its lungs as they filled and emptied with air.  
Its windpipe ran from its throat down to the lungs.  
I expected it to have big, sharp teeth — but it had human teeth, which was somehow even more terrifying.  
Its eyes were blacker than its body, making the outlines visible.  
And deep in the middle of its eyes were two small, glowing white dots.  
On top of its head were shriveled little strands of hair.

I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t.  
It would hear me.  
It stood completely still while its head slowly rotated — like it was scanning the area.  
I just sat there in the bush, silently praying to God that it would go away.

After what felt like forever, it finally walked off deeper into the forest.  
I waited a minute after it had left, then started running.  
I ran as fast as I could through the forest, trying to get out.  
I didn’t care if it heard me — I just needed to get out alive.

After a few seconds, I heard twigs snapping and leaves rustling behind me.  
I looked back but saw nothing.  
I kept running until I tripped on a rock and fell to the ground.  
My knee was scraped up, but I couldn’t stay down.  
When I looked up and got moving again — I froze.

My body kept running, but my brain stopped.  
In the tree ahead, Jack was hanging.  
His stomach was cut open. His eyes were gouged out.  
In his mouth was his heart.  
He wasn’t hanging by a rope — he was hanging by his own intestines.  
There was so much blood.

I screamed and ran even faster.  
I grabbed a rock while running and threw it at the creature.  
It let out the most grotesque scream I’ve ever heard.

I ran and ran until I finally saw the glow of the streetlights.  
I started crying.  
I reached the field between the forest and Jakob’s house.  
I turned around and saw Jakob and Lilly also running out of the woods.  
The creature wasn’t chasing me anymore — it had started going after them.

I kept running until I reached Jakob’s house.  
His parents came running out — they must’ve heard our screams.  
I turned around again and saw Lilly and Jakob make it to the house too.  
It wasn’t chasing them anymore.

Once we were all at the house, Jakob’s parents asked what the hell had happened.  
Jakob told them everything — how we were playing hide and seek and how the creature had chased us.  
His parents told Lilly and me to go home.

The next day, I texted Jakob and asked what happened after we left.  
He said he told them everything, but they didn’t believe him.  
He told them about Jack, and how the police had taken him down from the tree.  
Jakob told the exact same story to the police — they didn’t believe him either.

That day, I wondered what had happened to David.  
But I think I understand now.  
Even though I never believed in the supernatural — I do now.  
I think David *was* that creature.

It’s been eleven years since then, and I never thought I’d see that thing again.  
But I was wrong.

Last night, when I went for a walk, I saw it.  
It was standing in a small playground about three minutes from my house.  
I managed to hide behind a tree before it saw me.  
After what felt like hours, it walked away.

I’ve texted Jakob about it.  
Whether he believes me or not — I don’t care.  
I’m leaving tomorrow.  
I don’t want to play hide and seek anymore.
