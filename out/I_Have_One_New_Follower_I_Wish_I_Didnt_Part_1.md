Have you ever been to a college town in the summer? It feels like the rapture happened overnight. One minute the streets are filled with graduates eager to start their vacation, the next they’re lifeless and empty. As a newcomer in this area, the silence is incredibly lonesome.

Don't get me wrong, the town itself is fine. It's one of those classic university communities where half the population turns over every semester and the other half has been here since the 1960s. Coffee shops on every corner, bookstores that smell like old paper and water damage, and so many bars that it makes you question how they can all stay in business at the same time. The kind of place that looks perfect in college brochures.

I can’t complain, especially since my mom agreed to cover my stay here if I promised to keep my GPA up. In fact, she was ecstatic when I proposed moving halfway across the country. Which, to be honest, was a bit of a surprise. 

Growing up, she’d always been more on the overprotective side. Constantly keeping track of my location and always checking the locks twice before we went to bed. To her credit, we’d had a pretty bad break-in when I was four years old. It messed her up for quite a while, but I was too young to remember much of what happened. Whenever I try to think about that night, it’s just distant, fuzzy images of the police dragging someone out of my bedroom and throwing them into a cop car.

The problem isn’t the town, the problem is me. Or more specifically, how hard it is for me to make friends.

Back home, I had a close knit group. Most of us had known each other since elementary school and spent every free second we had together. Nearly a decade of inside jokes, backyard concerts and video game tournaments had come to an end this summer. Now everyone's scattered across different states, different time zones. We try to stay in touch through group chats and video calls, but it's not the same. Jake's busy with his engineering program, Marcus is working two jobs to pay for school, and Sarah's three hours ahead on the East Coast. By the time I'm free to hang out, they're already asleep, studying or living their new lives without me.

Most days, the only person I actually talk to face-to-face is Bill, my mailman.

Bill's in his fifties and sports a pair of massive blue sunglasses that take up half of his face. He wears them every single day regardless of weather. His skin looks as though he was a surfer, leathery and thick after years of direct sun. Either that or he needed to cutback on the spray tans. He's friendly enough though, always asks how I'm settling in, if I need anything, the kind of small talk that makes you feel less invisible.

"Another package for you today." Bill handed me the box, his sunglasses reflecting my disheveled appearance. "You sure do order a lot of stuff online."

"Easier than figuring out where all the stores are," I told him, which was partially true. The real truth was that ordering things online meant I had something to look forward to, even if it was just a new webcam I'd impulse-bought at 2 AM.

"I get it. If you ever need someone to show you around, just let me know." His smile was genuine, and for a moment my loneliness subsided. If only for a moment. When your mailman is the closest thing you have to a regular social interaction, you know you're in trouble.

That's probably why I started streaming.

It seemed like the perfect solution for an introvert like myself. I could connect with people without having to navigate the awkward social dynamics of college parties or trying to insert myself into established friend groups.

My setup was pretty basic. A decent webcam, a microphone that didn't sound too terrible, and my gaming PC positioned so my bed wasn't visible in the background. I had to keep an air of professionalism somehow. I even bought a few LED strips to finish off my ‘Cliche Streamer Starter Kit.’

For the first two weeks, my viewer count stayed at a solid zero. Occasionally someone would pop in, maybe say "hi" in chat, then disappear after a minute or two. I tried different games, different times of day, nothing seemed to work. I couldn’t help but think that at a certain point, I had gone from streaming to genuinely just talking to myself.

But I kept at it.

It was during this time that I started noticing small things around my apartment that seemed... wrong. Nothing dramatic, just tiny details that made me question my own memory. I'd leave a coffee mug on my desk and find it in the kitchen sink later—clean but still slightly warm, like it had been recently washed. Books on my shelf would be arranged differently. Nothing wildly out of order, just shifted enough that the spines didn't line up the way I remembered leaving them.

At first I chalked it up to stress. Moving to a new place, being isolated, spending too much time alone. My brain was playing tricks on me. Everyone misplaces things.

Then last week, something changed with my streams. I went live around 9 PM like usual, ready for another night of incessantly talking to myself while playing some indie horror game I'd picked up on sale. After about twenty minutes of radio silence, my viewer count showed 1 instead of 0.

Someone was actually watching.

I tried to play it cool, didn't want to scare them off by being too eager. "Hey there, welcome to the stream," I said, trying to sound natural. "Thanks for hanging out with me tonight."

The viewer didn't say anything in chat. No introduction, no emoticons, nothing. But they stayed. For the entire two-hour stream, that little "1" never moved. Someone was genuinely watching me play, listening to me ramble about game mechanics and random thoughts that popped into my head.

It should have felt good. Finally, after weeks of streaming to an empty room, I had a viewer. But something about it made me uncomfortable. Maybe it was the complete silence on their end. I know it’s normal for someone to watch a stream passively, but I can’t shake the uncanny feeling that I was being… observed.

Right before I was about to end the stream and log off for the night, a message finally appeared in chat.

**wx11flow3r\_75:** “I love watching you...”

Before I could respond, they left. The viewer count dropped back to 0, and I was left alone in my apartment again.

That night, I heard something in the walls behind my head.

I was lying in bed, scrolling through my phone and trying to wind down, when I heard a faint scratching sound. I wanted to believe it was just the building settling, but something about the noise felt purposeful. Like fingernails dragging slowly across wood.

The sound seemed to move around me toward the wall where my computer setup was. I followed it, crouching down under my desk to get closer to the baseboard. Whatever it was, it stopped moving. That's when I noticed a small hole in the wall. Fresh wood shavings littered the baseboard below it—this wasn't here yesterday. It was barely visible, maybe half an inch wide with cracks spider-webbing outward behind my computer.

As I leaned closer to examine it, I felt a strange temperature change wash over me. A warm blast of air brushed against my skin before returning to normal. I leaned even closer. The scratching stopped.

Peering into the small hole, I saw the glossy shine of an eye staring back at me. It was pure black and unmoving. My muscles tensed as my body entered a state of fight-or-flight. I hurled myself backward out of instinct and let out a stifled scream. As I landed on the ground, I heard the scratching begin again, even more frantic. But this time, the scratching was accompanied by another sound: Squeaking.

*Jesus Christ, it was just a rat?* I thought, as I sighed a long breath of equal relief and frustration. Of course it was a rat. This is an old building and the summer heat drives them inside. I'd dealt with mice in my bedroom growing up. This was essentially the same thing, just bigger.

I spent the rest of the night convincing myself there was nothing supernatural happening in my apartment, tossing and turning feverishly as the scratches intermittently returned.

Days passed without much excitement. I streamed every night and without fail, ‘**wx11flow3r\_75**’ was there. At least, I had to assume it was them. Even though a message rarely ever popped up in chat, my viewer count never wavered from 1. At times it felt voyeuristic, but in a way, I guess that’s the appeal of live streams. I grew to enjoy the company of that number “1” some nights, knowing that at least someone was there with me.

Two days ago I ended my stream a little early to the disappointment of my ‘faithful viewer’.

“Alright guys, I’m gonna end it here for the night. I have to clean up my place a little bit before bed, it’s a fucking mess.” I said, taking off my headphones and closing out of the game as I looked around the disheveled work station.

Just as I clicked ‘End Stream’, a message in the chat appeared.

**wx11flow3r\_75:** ‘no, please! I barely get to see you anymore.’

I didn’t have time to respond before the live stream cut out. I don’t think I would’ve even known how to respond. What could they have meant by barely got to see me anymore? I shook it off and stuck to my plan of tidying up the apartment. I loaded up empty cans of energy drinks and Styrofoam boxes of leftover fast food into a trash bag and made my way to the dumpsters.

As I walked around to the back of the building, I spotted movement in one of the second floor windows. I probably should have minded my own business, kept walking, thrown away my garbage and gone back inside. But something compelled me to stop and look.

It was a girl—roughly my age—with dark red hair pulled back in a loose ponytail. She was in what looked like her bedroom, pulling off a paint splattered t-shirt and replacing it with a rather tight fitting sweater. The back light of her bedroom hugged the curves of her skin, making it seem like her form was glowing. For just a moment I stood there, gazing at her through the window. She moved around her room with effortless grace, completely unaware that anyone was observing her. She turned around and I caught a glimpse of her face as she scanned her bedroom. She was breath-taking. When I caught sight of her emerald green eyes, I realized those eyes were just as capable of seeing me back.

That’s when I caught myself. *What the hell am I doing?* I forced myself to look away and hurried toward the dumpster, my face burning with embarrassment.

But I couldn't stop thinking about her. The image of her beautiful auburn hair flowing against her back as she walked. I had barely even seen her face, but she was undoubtedly gorgeous enough to consume my dreams that night.

That next morning when Bill showed up with my mail, I couldn’t help myself but ask him about the mysterious, alluring neighbor.

After a few pleasantries I took my chance, "Hey, do you know the girl who lives on the second floor? Facing the back alley? Red hair, maybe an art student?"

The reflection in his glasses showed two of me staring back, eagerly waiting for a response. "Oh, you mean Anna," he said after a moment. "She's in 2B. Sweet girl, keeps to herself mostly. It’s her second year in this building. You thinking about introducing yourself?"

Anna. A palindrome. Even her name is poetic.

"Maybe," I said, trying to sound casual. "Just wanted to get to know the neighbors, that’s all.”

“Sure, pal.” Bill smiled and gave me an awkward thumbs up before continuing down the block.

That evening, I found myself staring at my phone, debating whether or not to search for her. Just the name Anna wasn’t much to go off of, but with how small this town is, I could almost definitely find her on Instagram or Facebook.

I caved.

It started innocently enough. I was just curious to see if she had any public profiles online. I started by looking up “Anna” plus the name of our town. Then “Anna” plus the name of our college. It didn’t yield much, which wasn’t surprising. It was a Hail Mary in the first place with so little information. I was ready to put my phone away when I remembered the paint smeared on her shirt. It struck me,

*Maybe she’s an artist*...

It took a total of about twenty minutes but sure enough, there she was. Her business page on Instagram appeared. She apparently uses it to sell some of her art pieces around town. I thought that was about as far as I’d get before I noticed she tagged herself in one of the photos of a client holding her painting. I recognized the burnt orange hair in her profile picture immediately. I felt like a real Dick Tracy. Her Bio said she was a junior at the university, studying fine arts with a focus on 40’s Abstract Expressionism.

I scrolled through her profile. Pictures of her artwork featuring streaks of bold colors and unique textures. Photos of her out with friends at coffee shops and campus events. Her style was definitely more subdued, but I kind of liked that. She mostly opted for a pair of jeans and a graphic t-shirt. She also seemed to be fond of a particular dark green military jacket, most likely thrifted. It appeared in almost every other post. She seemed to save the dresses and jewelry for special occasions. I kept scrolling to find a few more selfies and even one with her wearing a Lou Reed shirt. The nineteen year-old version of me is currently a bit more rational, but a couple years ago I would have fallen head over heels for this girl in a heartbeat.

There's a chance I haven't changed as much as I believe.

My eyes kept darting over my shoulder, as if someone was going to catch me in some perverted act. But I wasn’t necessarily doing anything wrong. At least I don’t think so. Her profile is public, so obviously she’s okay with people looking her up. Everyone searches their crushes on social media, right? It's practically expected these days.

As I pressed my thumb against the screen to swipe back, I must have held it just a second too long because I accidentally pushed a button on the top of her page. 

I followed her. 

My heart sank to my stomach as I quickly pressed the ‘Unfollow’ prompt only a second after it had changed.

*Fuck… you dumb ass.* I thought to myself, taking a deep breath. *It’s okay… there’s no way she saw it that quickly.* I slammed my phone down on the side table and hoped a good night’s sleep would rid this embarrassment from my body.

That was when the scratching began again.

I woke up this morning in desperate need of caffeine, I opened my fridge to find an empty space where my energy drinks should’ve been. I could’ve swore I had at least two left, but between my lack of sleep and late night gaming binges, I didn’t put it past myself to have mindlessly finished them off. This meant a trip down to Mando’s, the small bodega just around the corner. Walking out, I reached for my keys on the hook behind the door and grasped at nothing but air. *Damn it*, I thought. I left them in the kitchen the night before. But I told myself it was only a block away, and I'd be back in less than five minutes—I didn’t need them.

Mando’s was one of those cramped little stores that still somehow manages to stock everything a drunk college student might need at 2AM. The clerk, a guy who looked to be in his forties with tired eyes, barely looked up from his phone when I walked in. His long brown hair hung like curtains, hiding most of his face. Multiple piercings and tattoos were scattered across his body without much cohesion.

"Just this," I said, placing two drinks on the counter.

He scanned them without enthusiasm. "Six fifty."

I handed him exact change and was heading for the door when he called after me.

"You live in the building on Maple Street, right? The brick one?"

I turned back, surprised. "Yeah, how'd you know?"

"See you walking by sometimes. You're new, right?"

It was a bit unsettling to know someone was keeping tabs on me without my knowledge. I replied, "About a month ago now."

He nodded. “You seen anything … strange since you’ve moved in?”

I thought about the scratching in my walls. Part of me wanted to tell him, but the other, louder part, didn’t want to look like a raving lunatic. “Not really…” I responded. I knew it was probably just rats anyway.

His eyebrow raised. I couldn’t tell if it was out of curiosity or judgment. “Nothing? Damn.” His face shifted to disappointment. I’m assuming he saw the confusion on my face because he continued unprompted, “That building used to be an old mental institution before they built the college here. The *last* guy who lived in your unit said he could still hear the screams of patients when he was trying to sleep.” He let out a light chuckle as he finished the sentence. An unsettling smile grew across his face. “Said he could feel the eyes of the orderlies and doctors glaring at him from the dark corners of the room you don’t pay attention to. The sounds of patients desperately trying to claw their way out through the walls.”

I froze, t*he scratching…* “The last guy?” I asked.

“Yeah, haven’t seen him for a couple of months so I assume he must’ve finally left. Dude seemed a little wacko, but hell if he didn’t come in here with some good stories.” The tone in his voice implied that I should come back with a better tale next time.

I hesitated to tell him about my experiences, how I had also heard the scratching sounds late at night. I quickly decided that it wasn’t worth the fifteen minute conversation it would turn into. At least not right now. “Sorry. It’s been pretty quiet since I’ve moved in.”

He shrugged and retreated back into his phone. I thanked him and headed outside, but his words stuck with me. The previous tenant had felt watched too...

As I approached my building, I spotted the silhouette of someone sitting on the steps leading up to the second floor apartments. I stepped closer and the figure became more clear. It was the girl from the window—Anna. She was wearing that same green jacket I'd seen in her photos.

When she noticed me approaching, I felt this wave of embarrassment wash over me. I wanted to hurry past her without making eye contact, praying she hadn't somehow seen me looking at her the other night.

I was almost to my door when her voice stopped me.

"Are you the one who was peeping through my window the other night?"

I froze, the energy drinks suddenly feeling like they weighed a hundred pounds.

She was looking directly at me now, her expression more curious than angry. "I live in 2B, second floor... Tuesday night, around eleven. You were by the dumpster and I’m pretty sure I saw you watching me."

My face was burning. I wanted to deny it, to play dumb, to somehow make this conversation end. But she'd clearly seen me, and lying would only make it worse.

"I..." I started, then stopped. How do you explain something like that without sounding like a complete creep? The honest answer felt impossible to say out loud.

"Well," I finally continued, "your window was open."

She stared at me for a moment, and I was sure she was about to tell me to stay away from her or threaten to call the cops. Instead, she started laughing.

"That's it? That's your excuse?"

"I mean, I stopped myself!" I said quickly. "I realized how weird it was and walked away. But yeah, for like ten seconds, I looked, and...” I trailed off, not sure how to finish that sentence without making it worse.

She laughed. "At least you're honest," I was surprised to see she was still smiling. "Most guys would have denied it completely or made up some dumb bull shit like ‘oh I was admiring your posters’.

"There were posters?"

She shook her head and stood up, extending her hand toward me. "I'm Anna, by the way."

"Trevor. 1A." I shook her hand, still not quite believing this conversation was happening. "I'm really sorry about the... you know. Window thing. I swear I’m not normally like that. I haven’t made many friends since moving out here, and I think it’s messing with my head a little bit."

"It's fine. Well, it's not really fine, but I appreciate the honesty. Just don’t do it again." She smiled but her voice was stern. “And during the summer, this place really is a ghost town. I don’t blame you. I think we might be the only two people left in this building until August.”

We talked for a few more minutes and while most of it feels like a blur now, it must have went well because, before you know it, she had handed me her phone.

"Put your number in. I'm going out with some friends tomorrow night - nothing fancy, just this arcade downtown. You should come."

I entered my contact information, still slightly stunned that being caught peeping had somehow led to getting an invitation out.

"I'll text you the details," she said, pocketing her phone. She flashed me a smile that could melt Mount Everest and headed back up the stairs. "See you tomorrow, Trevor from 1A."

I watched her disappear around the corner of the building before realizing that I was still holding my energy drinks. I headed toward my unit, feeling lighter than I had in weeks. An actual conversation with another human being. Plans for tomorrow night. The possibility of friends… maybe even more.

Placing one of the drinks under my right arm, I reached to open the front door.

It was locked.

I stood still for a moment, confused.

I tried the handle again, then checked the apartment number to make sure I was at the right door. 1A, just like always.

"What the hell?" I muttered, checking my pockets before remembering that my keys were sitting on the counter inside. I couldn't have locked the door.

I froze. Paranoia told me there was someone, or something, in my apartment. I stepped to the right and leaned in toward the window that looks into my kitchen. My mind was racing with possibilities. They ranged from the ‘likely’ to the ‘absolutely insane’ and everywhere in between. *Did I close the door too hard and the bolt shut on it’s own? Did a homeless person get lucky checking door handles and is now holding himself up in my bedroom? Did one of the mental patients try to escape and the orderly locked the door before he reached it…?* As I peered through the window, I saw nothing out of the ordinary. There were my keys splayed across the counter. With no other option, I had to call my landlord.

Carl, the maintenance man, showed up twenty minutes later with his master key. He looked mildly annoyed at being called out so early, but tried to hide it for me.

"Just glad it's something simple," he said as he unlocked my door. "Could have been a lot worse."

"Does this happen with a lot of units?" I asked, genuinely confused about how a door could lock itself.

"Not recently," he paused. "Actually, the guy who lived here before you was a real piece of work. Always complaining about weird stuff. Said he heard voices in the walls, kept talking about ghosts and people watching him. Kept calling about his door being locked when he swore he hadn't locked it. Not just the front door though. Bedroom, Bathroom, you name it."

The mention of the previous tenant caught my attention. "What happened to him?"

"Oh, he was a nightmare. Wouldn't pay rent on time, did all these modifications to the apartment without approval. Kept drilling holes in the walls, and claimed it helped stop the voices. I think he even had a special name for his paranormal friends… “Wallflowers”, that's it. Guy basically squatted here for almost a year before we could get him evicted."

Carl pushed open my door and stepped inside before grabbing my keys off of the hook and throwing them to me. "One day I showed up with the landlord to serve him papers and he was just... gone. Left most of his stuff, never came back for his deposit. Probably moved on to terrorize some other building."

"Did you ever find anything in the apartment… in the walls?"

Carl shrugged. "Nothing. Far as I could tell, he was just paranoid. Maybe doing too many drugs, you know? Started seeing things that weren't there. But he swore up and down that someone was watching him.”

We exchanged our goodbyes as he headed out and I thanked him again for the help. It wasn’t until the door was closed and he was gone that the realization struck me. A cold bead of sweat dripped down my spine as I looked down at the keys in my hand. I had just seen my keys on the kitchen counter less than twenty minutes ago. Why were they hanging on the hook when Carl grabbed them?

I spent the next several hours searching every corner of the house. The idea that someone made their way inside while I was gone wouldn’t leave me. Even after checking every room, I felt the need to check them again. I kept imagining I was playing a sick game of musical chairs—the squatter following behind me as I checked each room and hiding out in the one I had only just cleared. I did one more sweep of the rooms, this time in a different order. They wouldn’t outsmart me if that was the case.

I went Live about an hour later than usual tonight, finally convincing myself that I was home alone. Every room and closet was empty and every possible hiding spot was clear. But as soon as my stream started, something felt different.

I just went live and my viewer count is already at 1, like someone had been sitting there refreshing my page, waiting for me to start.

A notification was waiting for me in the chat.

**wx11flow3r\_75 followed You.**

I hovered my cursor over their profile. I am the only person they follow.

Their account was created the exact day I moved into this apartment.
