“Push, push!”

The amount of times I have heard words of that nature or similar. Either said to one of my many mothers or myself.

Though, of course, some of my “versions” have been created in a laboratory and they don’t tend to tell machines to push.

Hello, Reddit, the name of this version is…not that it matters but I understand human, which I’m not entirely sure I am but maybe???

Ah! This version isn’t the best at sentence structure. I understand human custom and it’s only polite to have something you can call me.

Bartholomew Antonio, an 18 year old living in a small population town of 5, 000 people. He’s a little toxic to people. Blonde hair & blue eyes.

I’d love to say that “*every version helps me grow better, feel more complete and in tune with the universe, allowing me to further humanity and realise how precious life is.”*

But, it’s not like that.

Death brings a darkness enveloping my consciousness.

This might not be the place, but given “Bart”’s interest in this subreddit and the horror genre, I thought it best to post here. He has an account but I made this one specifically for this “project” I have decided to start.

This version has the best mix of interest, technology skills and science to hopefully pull this off. Though I may refer to him in the third person, we are the same person, I’m in the routine of doing that kind of pronoun usage to myself.

I want what he wants, feel what he feels, think how he thinks, believes what he believes, write how he writes, etc.

I’m not going to list all of my versions, I’ll just give you the basics.

You can also refer me to as Infinity Gets Boring, or IGB for short, if you want. I’m hoping to break the habit of 801 lifetimes and be able to communicate using this account for the rest of any future versions.

My versions live as long, or short, a life as they are meant to. They can be criminals, police or somewhere In the middle.

The first death of my original, at least the first one I have no recollection before so I consider my first, version.

He did it again. C’mon, Bartholomew. Focus. He’s thinking about porn, you see. Specifically astronaut porn.

*In space, no-one can hear you scream…*

Alright, back in the room after a quick cold shower. “Rebooting” was pretty fucking scary the first few times.

You see, whenever I “die”, there is a split second before I am, what I have realised, “conscious” again. No, not as a baby…in the womb. Or test tube, whatever the scenario is. Between 24 and 28 weeks, as that is when consciousness occurs. Test tubes are fucking weird and scary.

For the first few times and about ¼ of all versions, I didn’t survive the womb. Test tubes, I haven’t had that experience much, about 8 times. Once, I haven’t survived past a few weeks.

802 reboots/rebirths/reincarnations/versions, whatever you want to call them. Always human, never animals. I can be situated in any time period up to and including the current one humanity is experiencing. I can have one version in the current era, and the next in the 1500’s, it’s not like they are in order. I can be any gender, any background, any location.

You might be thinking “oh yay! eternal life! Stop complaining” and I would’ve used to agree with you, from about “version” one until four-hundred.

As my username will attest to, infinity gets *boring*. You see, there’s a few downsides to this.

No, not the “you’ll miss loved ones” as this isn’t eternal life, but eternal life and death.

Though I can remember all of my experiences that have happened, which in itself is too much for my brain, I don’t care about the people once I have a new “version” and, with every reboot/version, I have this inbuilt, predetermined, constant headache from the memories. Painkillers do help somewhat.

To clarify, I remember every detail, but can not learn from any of them. Every new “version” brings me an eternal existential dread.

Most people fear death, I fear life. But every new “version/reboot” brings less care, makes me less emotive and a little less…human? If that’s possible.

Sometimes I end myself in order to move on. More and more in recent ones. Less to remember.

Now that you get an idea of where and, maybe, what “I” am. Let me wrap up with what brought me here.

Bart and I are going to take a gamble here, we’re going to kill ourselves. Sorry, Bart. I guess.

Doing this as I’m in two minds of wether to post this or not.

If “we”… fuck, pronouns are complicated for me, are successful, then I hope to be able to update this draft from my new “version” when old enough to be given free roam on the internet. I hope this site is still relevant then.

**UPDATE**; Welp, Nevermind. His parents found him and now we’re in a hospital, recovering.

Oh well, I guess my experiment will have to wait a little longer.

On the plus side, now this can be posted and I can interact with you. Ask me anything you like.

What interests Bart are theories. Am I taking another consciousnesses space? Am I a massive “glitch in the matrix”? Just a creative, slightly “emo” teenager? A mistake? One of many like me?

Thank you.

PS - Sorry about the title, this version is quite indecisive. Again, apologies if any of this isn’t clear. I’m limited to Bartholomew’s skills.

I ’m hoping, with what little caring I have, that either I have a limit or this post and your replies can help me.

I want it to stop.
