I'm Max, a guy who doesn't buy into all that supernatural jazz. My journey across Canada was a quest for serenity, a break from the chaos of the city. But fate had its own plans.  
  
I met Sarah on the road to the nearest town bordering the eerie Canadian forest. She's got this easygoing charm, a natural warmth that makes you feel like you've known her for ages. An artist by passion and an adventurer at heart, she seemed to find magic in every little thing.  
  
Our drive was smooth until we decided to take a less-traveled shortcut through the woods. Sarah was brimming with enthusiasm, pointing out every scenic spot and sharing quirky tales about the area. Then, as if the woods were playing a prank on us, my car decided it needed a break. With a splutter and a groan, it called it quits right in the middle of nowhere.  
  
Sarah handled the situation with her trademark grace, cracking jokes about forest spirits playing car pranks. Her laughter was a comforting melody amidst the encroaching dusk, especially as the sun dipped, casting strange shadows in the woods.  
  
"I guess we're camping here tonight," I said, trying to sound cool, but my mind was racing, recalling those spine-tingling stories about these woods.  
  
"Looks like an impromptu forest sleepover," Sarah quipped, her eyes twinkling with adventure. As twilight descended upon us, a mix of apprehension and curiosity settled in. Little did I know, that night in the woods was just the beginning of an extraordinary and unpredictable escapade.  
  
As the night wore on, the forest seemed to come alive in ways I couldn't comprehend. Sarah and I sat close, huddled by the dim light cast by the car, our minds grappling with the inexplicable silence that enveloped us.  
  
"I've heard tales about these woods," Sarah began softly, her voice barely above a whisper. "Whispers of ancient spirits, wendigos lurking in the shadows, hungry for lost souls."  
  
My skepticism battled with a growing sense of unease. "You don't really believe in that stuff, do you?" I questioned, my voice tinged with a hint of disbelief.  
  
Sarah's gaze turned distant, as if she was peering into a realm beyond our understanding. "There are things in this world, Max, things that defy logic and reason. Stories passed down through generations often carry fragments of truth," she murmured, her words hanging heavy in the still night air.  
  
The forest remained shrouded in an eerie quietude, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves. I strained my ears, trying to decipher the cryptic language of the woods.  
  
Then, a chilling sound echoed through the night—a haunting, indescribable howl that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest. Sarah's grip on my hand tightened, her eyes wide with a mix of fear and uncertainty.  
  
"Tell me that's just an animal," I whispered, my voice betraying a trace of dread.  
  
But Sarah remained silent, her gaze fixed on the darkness beyond our refuge. It was as though the forest itself held its breath, acknowledging the presence of something otherworldly.  
  
As the night wore on, sleep eluded us, the air thick with anticipation and an unspoken understanding that we were not alone in these woods. The paranormal tales I once scoffed at now hovered at the edge of my consciousness, leaving me to grapple with the inexplicable and the unknown.  
  
The night stretched endlessly, an unyielding embrace of mystery and foreboding. Little did I know, the secrets these woods held were far more profound and unsettling than anything I had ever imagined.  
  
Nightfall enveloped us, every shadow seemed to harbor a secret, and each whisper of the wind fueled the tension that had settled between Sarah and me. We stayed alert, our senses heightened, listening to every crack and rustle in our surroundings.  
  
Suddenly, a sound shattered the stillness. A branch snapping. We exchanged concerned glances, our hearts pounding in unison in the darkness. Fears of the unknown hijacked our imaginations.  
  
Then, emerging from the shadows, a figure appeared. With cautious steps, it drew nearer to us. The atmosphere became stifling, filled with an expectant silence.  
  
As it approached, the moonlight revealed its identity: a dog. Not just any dog; it wore a handmade collar woven with tiny bones, emitting an unsettling yet intriguing aura.  
  
"That's... that's the dog I saw on the 'wanted' posters in the town," murmured Sarah, her voice a mix of relief and surprise.  
  
The canine drew closer, its eyes expressing gratitude and a peculiar kind of camaraderie, as if it knew us somehow. Despite the eerie collar, its gaze conveyed a sense of calmness, as if reassuring us that we were safe.  
  
The tension gradually dissipated as the dog settled by our feet, seeking refuge and protection. Though its initial presence had enshrouded us in mysterious suspense, we now felt a sense of relief, realizing that perhaps the only being lurking in these woods was this faithful companion.  
  
We stood there, in the stillness of the night, the dog at our side, gazing at the stars as uncertainty gave way to a sense of connection with this creature who, somehow, had found its way to us amidst the darkness.  
  
With the dog nestled by our side, a calm settled over us. Sarah and I found ourselves drawn into a conversation that delved beyond the surface, revealing aspects of ourselves we hadn’t shared before.  
  
"You strike me as someone who loves a good challenge," Sarah remarked, breaking the comfortable silence that had settled between us.  
  
I chuckled softly. "Guilty as charged. I tend to dive headfirst into things, seeking that thrill of the unknown."  
  
Sarah nodded thoughtfully. "I've always been drawn to art, to stories that breathe life into the mundane. They help me see beyond what's visible, finding beauty in the unnoticed."  
  
Her words resonated with me, drawing a parallel to my own quest for the extraordinary. "I get that," I replied. "Sometimes, the world's magic lies in the smallest details, the stories waiting to be told."  
  
As our conversation meandered through our passions and quirks, the tension of the night seemed to dissipate, replaced by a genuine connection. We shared stories of childhood adventures, dreams we harbored, and fears we kept hidden.  
  
"So, what brings you to these parts?" I finally asked, curiosity nudging me to uncover more about her.  
  
Sarah smiled softly. "I seek inspiration in the unexplored. There's an energy here, a mystique that whispers tales waiting to be painted."  
  
Her words stirred something within me, a longing for a deeper connection with the world around me. "I guess we're not that different," I admitted. "I embarked on this journey to find a piece of myself I felt was missing."  
  
As the night wore on, our conversation flowed effortlessly, each revelation strengthening the bond between us. With the dog as our silent companion, we found solace in the shared tales of our lives, unveiling layers of our personalities under the starlit sky.  
  
The night wrapped us in an eerie calmness. Sarah and I were engrossed in our conversation when the forest fell into an unsettling stillness. I shivered, an inexplicable unease settling in my bones.  
  
"You know, when a forest goes silent, it's rarely a good sign," I muttered, an involuntary chill creeping down my spine. It was a truth I'd learned in my wilderness treks—a silence like this hinted at lurking danger.  
  
Before Sarah could respond, a deafening, inhuman cry pierced the silence. The dog bolted, its fur bristling as it dashed towards the source of the sound, disappearing into the dense woods.  
  
"What in the world was that?" Sarah gasped, her eyes wide with alarm.  
  
"Maybe an elk or... something else," I replied, trying to mask my own unease with rationality.  
  
But deep down, I knew that sound didn't belong to any forest creature I'd ever encountered. Instinct kicked in, adrenaline surging through me as we chased after the dog, our footsteps pounding against the forest floor.  
  
The darkness seemed to swallow us whole as we ventured deeper into the woods. Each step echoed with an unspoken fear, the rustling leaves and cracking branches around us a haunting symphony.  
  
"Where did he go?" Sarah's voice trembled, panic lacing her words.  
  
"I don't know, but we need to find him," I urged, my heart racing with a mix of worry and foreboding.  
  
As we pushed deeper into the forest's heart, an ominous realization gripped us something beyond the ordinary lurked within these woods.  
  
We plunged deeper into the darkened woods, our frantic calls for the dog met with a haunting silence. The air hung heavy with tension, every step echoing our growing apprehension.  
  
Then, amidst the oppressive silence, a thunderous rhythm of galloping footsteps thundered toward us. Panic surged through me, primal instincts kicking in. "Run!" I shouted to Sarah, the urgency in my voice betraying the fear clawing at my insides.  
  
Our feet pounded against the forest floor, a cacophony of terror-fueled steps. The thundering sound seemed to gain on us, getting closer with each passing moment.  
  
But in that panicked sprint, I stumbled, my foot catching on a protruding root. I pitched forward, the ground rushing up to meet me. A sickening crack echoed through the woods as my head connected with an unforgiving rock, and darkness enveloped me.  
  
The last thing I remember is a flurry of movement, Sarah's voice calling out my name in desperation, and the thundering gallops fading into an ominous silence as everything went black.  
  
.  
  
.  
  
.  
  
.  
  
A faint, distant murmur pulled me from the abyss of unconsciousness. My eyes blinked open to a world draped in shadowy hues. Panic surged as I sat up, the dry crust of blood on my forehead sending shivers down my spine.  
  
The forest lay before me, desolate and eerily silent. "Sarah?" I called out, my voice barely a whisper in the vastness of the woods. No response. No signs of the faithful canine companion either.  
  
A feeble light filtered through the dense canopy, casting a muted glow. Had dawn broken? No, it hadn't. I realized with a sinking feeling that I'd been unconscious for almost a day. Hours remained until the onset of another night, another cycle of darkness.  
  
Fumbling to my feet, a disorienting wave of dizziness swept over me. The world spun as I steadied myself against a nearby tree, a pounding headache pulsating in tandem with my racing heart.  
  
I frantically searched for any signs of Sarah, any clue about what had transpired in my absence. But the woods held onto their secrets, whispering nothing but an ominous quietude.  
  
Gritting my teeth against the fear threatening to overwhelm me, I knew I had to find her, find some semblance of answers before the shroud of night descended once more.  
  
The forest stood poised in a liminal state, caught between the fading remnants of the night and the impending darkness. And in this eerie in-between, I stood alone, with the chilling realization that the mysteries of these woods had only just begun to unfold.

Staggering through the silent woods, I felt the weight of impending darkness bearing down on me. The hours had slipped away, leaving behind an ominous hush that settled over the trees like a heavy shroud.  
  
I stumbled forward, each step an arduous effort as I fought against both physical and emotional exhaustion. Fear and a desperate need to find Sarah surged within me, propelling me deeper into the heart of the woods.  
  
Then, amidst the suffocating quietude, a distant echo caught my attention. A soft whimper, almost imperceptible. My heart skipped a beat. Was it the dog? Could it be Sarah?  
  
Driven by hope, I followed the sound, branches clawing at me as I pushed through the dense underbrush. The fleeting light dimmed further, a foreboding chill seeping into the air.  
  
As I advanced, the faint glimmer of the moon illuminated a figure lying on the forest floor. Relief washed over me as I recognized Sarah's silhouette, curled up beneath the canopy of trees.  
  
"Sarah!" I called out, my voice trembling with a mix of worry and relief. She stirred, her eyes fluttering open, but something seemed amiss.  
  
"Max? What happened?" Her voice was weak, tinged with confusion.  
  
I knelt beside her, my heart pounding with a whirlwind of emotions. "I don't know. We got separated, I fell and... and then I woke up alone."  
  
A fleeting sense of safety washed over us, finding solace in each other's presence in the heart of this enigmatic forest. Yet, as the last traces of light faded from the sky, the encroaching darkness whispered of untold dangers, reminding us that the night held secrets we were yet to uncover.

The chill of the night wrapped around us, a constant reminder of the lurking mysteries in these woods. Sarah and I huddled together, seeking warmth and reassurance amidst the encroaching darkness. But as the night wore on, a persistent unease settled within me, a gnawing feeling that something wasn't right.  
  
A sharp pang sliced through my temples, a sudden, intense pain seizing my senses. I winced, gripping my head, trying to ward off the crippling ache. It felt as though my skull was splitting apart, a relentless assault on my senses.  
  
I collapsed to the forest floor, the pain overwhelming any coherent thought. Darkness encroached at the edges of my vision, threatening to pull me under. With a desperate gasp, I fought against the encroaching unconsciousness.  
  
When I finally awoke, it was to a world cloaked in the eerie glow of midnight. Confusion clouded my mind as I tried to piece together the events. But as awareness flooded back, a stark realization struck me with chilling clarity—I wasn't with Sarah. Instead, the loyal canine companion lay beside me, its gentle eyes peering at me with a mix of concern and familiarity.  
  
Panic surged through me as I struggled to comprehend the twisted reality. My mind had played a cruel trick, conjuring a false narrative amidst the chaos of the head injury. I had mistaken the dog for Sarah in my delirium.  
  
Frantic and disoriented, I called out for Sarah, the echoes of my voice swallowed by the silent expanse of the woods. But there was no response, no trace of her amidst the shadows that stretched across the forest floor.  
  
Reality crashed down upon me like a relentless wave. The impact had not only disoriented me physically but had shattered the fragile illusion of safety and companionship in this desolate place. I was alone, lost in a realm of uncertainty and unforeseen dangers.  
  
Gathering my scattered thoughts, I tried to retrace my steps, to make sense of the fragmented memories and the ominous events that had unfolded. The dog stayed by my side, a silent companion offering solace in the midst of confusion.  
  
With a heavy heart, I embarked on a solitary journey through the haunting woods, each step a reminder of the tangled web of mysteries that awaited me. The night whispered secrets I was yet to decipher, and the shadows concealed truths that eluded my grasp.  
  
As the moon cast its silvery glow upon the landscape, I pressed forward, driven by a relentless determination to unravel the enigma that had entangled me in this surreal and treacherous journey.

  
The clearing in the forest appeared suspended in a perpetual state of desolation. Life had withered away, leaving behind a landscape of wilted vegetation and an eerie silence. My steps echoed in the emptiness, breaking the ominous quietness that enveloped the place. Small scattered skeletons and the complete absence of any animal life painted a disconcerting picture, one that evoked a deep sense of fear within me.  
  
My gaze fixated on the cave that stood in the distance, a dark opening that seemed to be the epicenter of this desolation. A cold, damp draft escaped its mouth, like a mysterious whisper calling me toward its interior.  
  
My mind grappled between curiosity and the instinctual warning that this place wasn’t safe. What secrets or dangers lay hidden within that cavernous darkness? My heart pounded, uncertainty clouding my thoughts.  
  
The dog, my silent companion in this surreal journey, remained by my side, its eyes filled with loyalty and an uncanny animal wisdom. Its presence seemed to offer a sliver of courage amidst the darkness.  
  
The mystery shrouding the cave was palpable, an enigmatic invitation tempting my curiosity and challenging my prudence. Was it wise to venture into the jaws of the unknown? I couldn’t ignore the sense of danger that clung to my intuition.  
  
Time hung suspended in a moment of hesitation, my mind weighing the possibilities while my instincts urged caution. Night was looming, its shadows slowly encroaching upon the clearing, a subtle warning that time was running short.  
  
Then, a decision solidified within me, fueled by the need for answers and the will to confront whatever awaited in the darkness. With cautious steps, I approached the cave’s entrance, every fiber of my being alert to any hint of danger.  
  
The dog emitted a soft growl, its gaze fixed on the cave’s mouth, as if trying to warn me of something invisible to my eyes. Its gesture reignited my unease, but an indomitable impulse pushed me forward.  
  
With a deep breath, I crossed the threshold of the cave, plunging into the darkness that devoured the light. The air grew denser, laden with an earthy and mysterious aroma, as if it were imbued with centuries of secrets held within the earth’s depths.  
  
The echo of my footsteps reverberated against the rocky walls, my hands feeling the cold contours of the cave, searching for any clue that might guide me. The darkness was overwhelming, but a glimmer of determination burned within me, propelling me forward in search of answers.  
  
Each step was a challenge, an internal struggle between the desire to uncover the truth and the terror of the unknown. The cave seemed like an endless maze, its secrets hidden in the shadows, waiting to be unraveled or forever guarded by the veil of mystery.  
  
The dog remained by my side, its comforting presence amidst the dimness. Its animal senses seemed alert, its eyes scanning the surroundings as if anticipating some hidden danger in the darkness.  
  
A distant whisper echoed in the cavern, a barely perceptible murmur that enveloped my senses with a sense of unease. Was the cave witness to an ancient secret, or was it the dwelling place of something more sinister?  
  
Time blurred in the darkness, each minute feeling like an eternity as I ventured deeper into the cavern’s depths. More and more, the sense of intrigue mingled with the palpable fear that stirred in the rarified air.  
  
Amidst the blackness, a revelation materialized: the challenge of the cave lay not only in its nooks and passageways but in the enigmas and dangers that lurked, concealed within, challenging my courage and sanity.

As I ventured deeper into the cavern, shadows danced ominously on the walls, amplifying the eerie silence that enveloped the space. The air grew heavier, thick with an unidentifiable scent that sent shivers down my spine.  
  
Then, in the dimness, shapes began to emerge—bodies strewn across the cave floor, a macabre sight that froze the blood in my veins. My heart sank at the grim reality of death that surrounded me. Amidst the lifeless forms, a sense of dread gripped me as I noticed Sarah lying unconscious but miraculously alive among the corpses.  
  
With urgency coursing through my veins, I hurried toward her, intent on rescuing her from this haunting place. But as I approached, the dog, sensing something amiss, grew restless, its bark piercing the oppressive silence of the cave.  
  
Before I could reach Sarah, a bone-chilling presence filled the cavern—an entity that defied the laws of nature and reason. The Wendigo, towering over two meters tall, its form contorted and unsettling, staggered into the cave, its very presence a manifestation of primal terror.  
  
I retreated, seeking cover among the lifeless bodies and foliage, my breath hitching in fear. The Wendigo’s ominous aura seemed to suffocate the air, its looming figure casting a malevolent shadow over the scene.  
  
My heart pounded in my chest as I watched in horror, hidden from view, as the monstrous entity approached the dog, its movements predatory and menacing. The poor creature’s barks turned to whimpers, a futile attempt at warding off the inevitable.  
  
With a single, brutal strike, the Wendigo ended the dog's life, a sight that pierced through my soul like a dagger. I clenched my teeth to stifle a cry, a wave of helplessness washing over me as the creature began to feed on the life it had just extinguished.  
  
Terror rooted me to the spot, my body trembling as I bore witness to the gruesome spectacle unfolding before my eyes. The Wendigo’s insatiable hunger was a harrowing sight, its savagery a stark reminder of the unfathomable horrors lurking within these accursed woods. I prayed for some semblance of escape from this waking nightmare, but the darkness of the cave held me captive, a silent witness to the unspeakable brutality of this unearthly being.

  
The plan had formed in my mind, even amidst the horror unfolding before me. With determination, I approached Sarah, assessing her delicate condition. Her injured leg was a concern, and her unconscious state added a layer of difficulty to our imminent escape.  
  
The creature, oblivious to my presence, had retreated from the cave after its grisly meal. I knew I had to act swiftly before it returned in search of more prey.  
  
Carefully, I lifted Sarah into my arms, her body light but fragile. Concern for her well-being mingled with the urgency to flee that accursed place.  
  
Every step was a challenge, each movement calculated to avoid causing further harm to Sarah's injured leg. The weight of responsibility clung to my shoulders; time was not on our side.  
  
The mouth of the cave loomed before me, the hope of escaping that inferno beginning to take shape. But every rustle in the forest, every shadow shifting in the darkness, fueled my fear of being discovered by that monstrous being lurking in the shadows.  
  
With each step, the urgency grew. The exit was in sight when a shiver ran down my spine, a foreboding sense warning me that the Wendigo was nearing.  
  
The sound of crunching branches and a menacing hiss echoed behind me. There was no time to waste. With a superhuman effort, I quickened my pace, dodging the danger and entering the relative safety of the forest.  
  
My ragged breaths and the weight of Sarah in my arms combined with the anxiety of escaping that living nightmare. Each inhale, each beat of my heart, was a reminder of the struggle for survival.  
  
I ran as fast as I could, seeking refuge and protection for Sarah and myself. The forest seemed conspiratorial, every noise, every shadow, igniting the fear that was engulfing me.  
  
Finally, I found a secure hiding spot, far from the cave and beyond the Wendigo's reach. I carefully placed Sarah in a safe location, watching over her with concern while attempting to keep at bay the panic threatening to engulf me.  
  
My mind raced, weighing options, seeking a way to get help or find an escape from that torment. But for now, the priority was to ensure we were out of that creature's reach, find assistance, and a path to salvation.

...

Unfortunately, what I've told you isn't my story. While Max and Sarah did exist, well... they existed, I'm just a search and rescue guy tasked with finding these people.

As part of the search and rescue team, our priority was locating two missing individuals, Max and Sarah. Their disappearance had us on edge, and our efforts to find them led us deep into an undisclosed and secluded area.  
  
Amidst the dense forest, we stumbled upon a discovery that sent shivers down our spines—a weathered notebook. Its contents held a gripping tale, a firsthand account of harrowing encounters with an unknown creature. The details were vivid, the emotions raw, and every entry felt like a real-life experience.  
  
As I read through the pages, the story transitioned into a warning. It seemed to convey the inherent danger of the events described, urging extreme caution for anyone daring to venture into that area. The descriptions of the creature were so vivid and haunting that they felt eerily tangible.  
  
The authenticity of the notebook's account struck a chord within the team. We couldn't dismiss it as mere fiction. The descriptions were too detailed, too genuine to ignore. The warning it carried felt like a genuine caution against something inexplicable.  
  
Our search for Max and Sarah yielded no results, leaving us with more questions than answers. The notebook remained a cryptic piece of the puzzle, hinting at a reality too unfathomable for conventional explanation.  
  
As a seasoned member of the search and rescue team, it was a stark reminder of the unforeseen dangers lurking in unexplored territories. We handled the notebook with caution, treating its contents as a solemn warning, a testament to the potential perils of the unknown.

and yes, we found that cave but no one was inside... just rests of that dog and some strange wood sticks figures with some hair and some how it was dna compatible with those people.

DONT TRY TO FIND THAT PLACE
