It's place in a desert where vegetation and water are found.

Or a more philosophical approach, a paradise after a journey of torment.

My father died a few weeks ago, he told me before he died, that he wanted his ashes to be scattered in an "oasis", he smiled but a tear came down his face while he said it, he cleared his voice, and in a shaky voice

"Promise me you will do this" He got desperate

 "THAT YOU WILL DO THIS" 

He started coughing and crying, 

"NO M-MATTER WHAT YOU MAY FIND IN THE-"

 He coughed violently, 

He grasped for air, 

"I'm sorry I'm sorry.."  he mumbled 

My father started convulsing

 THEY PUSHED ME AWAY FROM MY DYING FATHER.

I was forced to see how they failed to keep him alive.

While I cried, I remember having my head up against the wall just thinking.

I haven't heard my father beg during my entire life, not even once, and the first time I did, it was about scattering his ashes in a place I don't even know.

It was just so fast, even, to see how desperate, how each time he pleaded, he lost time alive.

A week before the cremation, and the funeral

I started researching what he could have meant by oasis. I looked at old photos and searched for a diary or something that had the slightest hint of what he meant.

A week had passed, and on the day of the funeral, I started to consult family and friends about it, but most of them either didn't have a clue or just said that I should let it go.

After the funeral, I was kind of baffled that the response to my father's dying wish to spread his ashes on whatever he could’ve meant by an oasis was to just let it go.

So in a moment of anger, I took the most literal definition of it and travelled to the nearest desert

It was sort of a relief leaving my house. Since his death, a layer of tension was there, before I had taken the ashes of my father, the urn just sat there on the dinner table where we used to eat meals. 

I would have loved to tell you that he was someone you could have a beer with, but ever since I had a conscience, he had been quite the opposite, always uneasy, paranoid, and definitely not a people person.

 But although he had his faults he loved us.

I had been driving for almost 36 hours, and I was fighting to keep myself from sleeping right there. Each time I closed my eyes, it was harder to keep them open. 

So I decided to park my car on the side of the road, and cleared the backseat to sleep, i grabbed the urn and curled up into a fetal position, and immediately fell into a slumber

I dreamed of a time we were walking in the forest, and talking about life. I can't remember the exact words, but I knew that he was giving me some sort of advice. I remember us stopping in front of a fountain, vines and plants covered it but water was still pouring from it, a statue of a creature being impaled from behind lay on top of it.

I felt him grab my shoulders, and this I do remember hearing.

…

“Something is outside"

He said in a sweet tone.

I woke up and breathed like I hadn't in ages.

I looked around the car, the urn was dropped on the car floor but the ashes hadn't spilled, even though I was in the middle of nowhere, I heard faint footsteps outside, I've heard the stories were tourists are ambushed by criminals, so at least in my mind getting out of the car wasn't an option, i moved from the backseat onto the drivers making quite a bit of noise and attempting to start the car as fast as i could. 

The engine struggles

And the footsteps come every time closer

Panic ensued in my mind, I wasn't about to die on this trip. I grabbed a gun that I had in the glove box.

The engine once again attempted to start

And a knock was heard on the window

What sounded like an old man spoke with a raspy voice

“Lower the window, ma’am.”

I turned my head to see a man who had what looked like an officer's uniform, but it was like those costumes you can buy from those seasonal stores for cheap. 

“Ma’am please lower the window,” he asked once again in an alarming tone, while tapping the glass.

I attempted to talk but

“OPEN THE DAMN WINDOW” He shouted while his face started to melt.

I desperately started to start the car but its pleas became louder and its face more ruined.

It started to punch the window 

A crack was made and fortunately the car had started, I sped off and in the rear view mirror I saw that thing break that costume and spread some wings larger than the body that it inhabited and flew to the sky, its wings were made of bone and muscle its head like a vultures skull and in the ends of the wings claws that looked like sewing needles.

I managed to live through whatever that thing was, but my car was holding on dear life, and it managed to at least get me to a town, where I managed to find a mechanic to repair the car so i can continue, in the meantime im going to stay in a hotel and research whatever it is that attacked me, one thing that still boggles me is why inside my dream my father told me of a presence outside. 

Maybe it was my subconscious telling me that but I want to believe that my father's spirit was helping me
