When Jeffery was born, Maya had been in labor for 21 hours. We did a home birth, and I delivered. I hadn't done it before, Jeffery being our first. Maya insisted we give the fully natural birth a go. We had consulted midwives, I'd taken a course and read many books. Our contingency plan was jumping in our Jeep and driving the 8 minutes to Evergreen hospital if anything went wrong.

A lot seemed to go wrong, and it was a hellish 21 hours. I wanted to go to the hospital after the first hour. Maya was in such discomfort. But she insisted. Stubborn woman. I felt the decision to press on, made again and again over the course of her labor, was dangerous. Stubborn.

Ultimately, she crowned and things went quickly. Jeffery slipped out as if there had not been 20 hours of labor. I was at first elated, but then shocked. Jeffery came out facing down, and when I rotated him with the intention of cradling the boy, I found his eyes already open, expressionless but staring me dead in the face. No crying whatsoever, while his eyes, a bright fresh mint color, bore into me as if filled with consciousness. I was ashamed to admit it back then, but I can say now that it was like staring into the face of a psychopath. There was no emotion or empathy in those eyes. It was as if I was being consumed by them, as if I were merely prey to this brand new baby.

I never told Maya. He shut his eyes again before I handed him to her, and from then on it was baby as usual, blinking eyes open, looking around, crying.

Fast forward two years. Maya gave birth to our second child, baby Zoe, three months ago. Nothing out of the oridinary. We did a hospital birth this time, and the labor was almost non-existent. Zoe cried. Her eyes were closed. As I'd looked at her, I remembered Jeffery's death stare at birth, and quickly handed new Zoe to Maya when a shiver of memory shot through my body and I felt weak.

But that's not why I find myself writing these things down. In the time since we brought Zoe home, things have spiralled out of control. It began right when we got back from the hospital. The babysitter left, and Maya knelt down and in her mommy voice presented Zoe to Jeffery as he stood in the hall. I stood above Maya watching. Jeffery's head didn't move as he looked at Zoe, but suddenly his eyes in their sockets moved so quickly that I staggered slightly when they caught me in their stare. The same psychotic expression from his birth, and the first I'd seen it since. Maya must not have noticed because she was still cooing at Zoe. And before she could notice, Jeffery had broken the icy hold his mint eyes had on me, and he was back to being curious toddler for Maya.

I couldn't bring myself to talk to Maya about this. I guess at first I thought it was a fluke incident. Maya and I have no other secrets, but something in me wanted to spare her from these moments where I feel my son is not... all there.

The meeting of the children was the first incident, but it was nothing compared to the second and most recent.

Maya was asleep, the babies too. Or so I thought.

I had just finished a bit of work and had closed my laptop, taken a final sip of my port nightcap. Our house is single-story with a sunken living room. Jeffery learned how to tumble down the single stair onto the carpet at first, but now he could walk a clumsy baby walk to decscend it. I don't know how he managed this, but I found him in the middle of the living room, having brought his sister somehow from her crib. Zoe lay before him, and he stood there like a man, staring down at her. When he noticed me, the shock of the scene and his eyes alone held me in a fearful grasp, so I couldn't move. I didn't *want* to move. His eyes were so intense, and didn't break their lock on mine. In this state, he knelt down as if his little 2-year-old body had the experience of decades. Slowly, with methodical precision his little paw of a hand went to clasp little Zoe's mouth and in that moment I could feel a scream wanting to burst from my throat, but it was hampered by Jeffery's repressive effect on me. My mouth opened, but like trying to scream in a nightmare, only suppressed air came forth.

Just then a light flooded the room and before I could register a change it had already occurred. The babies were both flailing and crying on the carpet, red with tears and faded breath, while Maya rushed forward in her nightgown, screaming at me and cursing, demanding what I was doing.

"I... I don't know, Maya!"

"What do you mean you don't know! What is going on!?" she screamed. I was haplessly motioning toward them while she angrily held me at bay with her hand, simultaneously scooping up the children in one arm. Adrenaline pumped into me and I could hear my blood flow.

"It's Jeffery!" I yelled, without thinking.

"What the fuck!?" she screamed, blood red in the face, all the late-thirties wrinkles creasing in anger.

"I mean," I stammered. "I mean--"

"These are my *children*!" she yelled.

I lay on the couch after she retreated back to our room with the babies. I lay there, listening to the wailing, and the cooing, and the eventually softening and silence. I lay there wide awake, but instead of thinking of my blunder, whether it was mentioning Jeffery or having not mentioned him sooner at some more opportune moment, I was thinking of his eyes and his movement. The way he seemed to inhabit his little body with the control of an adult. More than that, he moved with the kind of precision that's normally choreographed. Slow, methodical, surgical, deliberate. All while restraining his captive with that psychotic stare. I couldn't sleep. I could barely blink. I lay there, in the brightly lit living room, until sunlight flowed in.

Then I left. Took the Jeep out on a drive. I lost track of time because it was already 4pm when I felt my phone vibrate. Unknown number. Picked it up out of habit.

"Hello?" I said.

"Is this Mr. Helmuth?"

"Yes, who is speaking please?"

"This is Evergreen hospital, we need you to come in right away."

"Um, what's the problem?" I said.

"Your wife is in a coma Mr. Helmuth. Please come in."

The words lingered like a buzzing in my ear. *What?*

At the hospital I found Maya's mother pacing in front of her bed. When she saw me she shot over and slapped me in the face.

"Where *were* you?" she snapped. I was bewildered. What happened? Who found her, how did they find her? I had no missed calls--why is Maya's mother here before me?

"I--I was driving," I said, clueless. Maya lay in the bed unconscious, hooked up to a machine that beeped and whirred.

Just then a nurse entered, looked at Maya's mom and then at me.

"Are you the father?" she said. I looked down and she was holding Jeffery's little hand. He was sucking his thumb, staring straight ahead.

"I..." I began. Fear surged through me as I looked down at the top of Jeffery's head. Messy brown hair. Sucking noises.

"Where's Zoe?" demanded Maya's mother.

"Who?" said the nurse.

The sucking noises stopped, and Jeffery's head craned unnaturally to look up at me. Expressionless, deep mint eyes looking at me. My pulse increased.

"My grandaugther!"

"Ma'am there was only this boy with the woman."

I heard the door open again, rustling feet, metal clanging.

"Sir, could you come with us please, we have a few questions," said the man's voice.

That's the last I remember. I think I blacked out. I'm under investigation as a suspect in a crime that no one can say happened. Maya's in the hospital, her mom is there still. They've searched the house, but had to put out an APB about Zoe. My daughter is still missing.

I'm back home now. I couldn't bring myself to tell them everything. The door's closed because Jeffery is here. I know I'll have to go out there eventually. But it's him. I swear to God, it's him.
