The story of Conveyor 48 never leaves me. Even now, years later, I find myself staring at ceilings, replaying every sound, every breath, every step we took that day.

Madox and I had been best mates for over a decade. We met in school, bonded over our shared love of gaming, gym sessions, and eating more food than we could ever justify. Madox was the kind of guy who lit up a room with his laughter. Built like a rugby player—tall, dark, and 6’2” of solid muscle—he was a presence you couldn’t miss. I often joked that I was his “white, blue-eyed twin.” While shorter at 5’11”, I shared his broad shoulders and rugged build. Both of us sported scruffy beards and short hair, kept that way from years of wearing work helmets.

Work was grueling. Plastic overalls clung to us like second skins, trapping the relentless heat from the cooling machinery around us. The masks we wore were meant to filter out the dust and asbestos that sometimes drifted down the pits, but they often felt suffocating, making each breath a conscious effort.

Still, we found ways to laugh through it.

“Alright, bro,” Madox said, his voice muffled through his mask as he swept a pile of trash back onto the belt, “gym after this? Let’s see if you can finally keep up.”

“Keep up?” I scoffed, dragging my shovel across the grime-coated walkway. “Mate, I’m the reason you still have a spotter. You’d bench yourself into the grave without me.”

Madox chuckled, the sound reverberating in the confined space. “Alright, Mr. Safety Inspector. What about after? Pizza and Call of Duty?”

“Only if you don’t lag out this time,” I shot back.

“Lag?” Madox snorted. “You’re just mad I outscored you last time.”

“In your dreams, mate.”

The banter made the day bearable, but even as we laughed, I could see the way Madox’s eyes flicked toward the conveyor every now and then. It wasn’t the first time we’d cleaned Conveyor 48, and it wasn’t the first time it had gotten under his skin.

“You alright?” I asked, noticing how his grip tightened on the broom.

“Yeah,” he said quickly, but his voice lacked its usual confidence. “Just… this place, man. Doesn’t it ever feel like something’s watching you down here?”

I didn’t answer right away. I’d felt it too—that strange, crawling sensation like eyes boring into your back.

“It’s just the heat,” I said eventually, forcing a grin. “Messes with your head.”

“Yeah, maybe,” Madox muttered, but he didn’t sound convinced.

The machine was a beast—a 100-meter incline boxed in by warped wooden walls, a narrow walkway running alongside the belt. It groaned and creaked like it could give out at any moment, carrying decades of trash—heaps of unidentifiable junk that smelled like death warmed over. But it wasn’t just the noise or the stench that got to you. It was the silence that came in between, heavy and oppressive, like the place was holding its breath.

By the time we reached the bottom of the conveyor, the air was suffocating. The stench of rotting waste mixed with the oily tang of machinery. Every step we took stirred up a cocktail of smells so potent it made my stomach churn. Sweat dripped from my brow, pooling behind the plastic mask and stinging my eyes.

Madox’s unease only grew as we worked. He kept glancing over his shoulder, his movements quicker and jerkier than usual.

“You really think Will would let us work down here if something was up?” I asked, trying to lighten the mood.

Madox gave a short laugh. “Will doesn’t come down here himself. That says enough.”

We worked in rhythm, shoveling, sweeping, dragging junk back onto the belt. The scraping of tools against the floor filled the air, punctuated by the occasional metallic clang of something heavier hitting the belt. But then, amid the chaos, a sound cut through—a faint scratching, barely audible over the noise.

“You hear that?” Madox asked, his voice low.

I froze, straining to listen. The sound came again, irregular and sharp, like claws scraping against wood.

“You think it’s that ‘something’ watching us?” I teased, though my gut twisted.

Madox didn’t laugh this time.

Curiosity got the better of me. I climbed the guard rail, the metal slick with grime, and peered into the conveyor. The dim lighting cast long shadows across the mounds of garbage, but something moved—a faint shift, barely perceptible, like the trash was breathing.

“What is it?” Madox asked, his voice tight.

“I don’t know,” I said, unease curling in my stomach.

To break the tension, Madox slammed his fist against the guard rail. The metallic clang echoed through the pit, loud enough to make my ears ring. For a moment, there was silence. Then it began.

The sound of movement—fast, heavy, and relentless—racing up the conveyor belt toward us. My heart lurched as I leapt off the rail, landing in front of Madox on the narrow walkway.

“Run!” I shouted.

The incline was brutal, but adrenaline drove me forward. My boots slipped on the uneven planks, the smell of sweat and garbage burning my nostrils. Behind me, Madox’s heavy footsteps thundered, his breathing loud and strained.

The creature was close. I could hear it—guttural growls mixed with the screeching of claws against metal and wood. The sound was deafening, a visceral reminder of how fast it was gaining on us.

I risked a glance back and caught a glimpse of it under the conveyor’s dim light. Its form was monstrous, hunched, and unnaturally large, covered in what looked like a mix of matted fur and jagged scales. Its eyes burned like embers, locked onto us with terrifying focus.

“Don’t stop!” Madox shouted, his voice cutting through the chaos.

The doorway ahead seemed impossibly far, but I pushed on, my lungs burning with every step. The heat was unbearable, the mask making it feel like I was suffocating.

Then, Madox footsteps faltered.

“Madox?”I called, my voice breaking.

There was no response.

I reached the doorway, collapsing onto the ground outside. My chest heaved as I ripped off the mask, gulping down the cool night air. But Madox wasn’t there.

“Madox!”I shouted, turning back toward the conveyor.

The darkness stared back at me, empty and silent.

“Joel…”

His voice was faint, almost a whisper, but unmistakable.

“Madox!” I yelled, stepping toward the doorway. “Where are you?”

No answer. The void swallowed my words.

For a moment, I stood there, torn between running back and staying put. But the memory of that creature froze me in place. My legs trembled as I staggered backward, away from the door.

They never found him. The search teams combed through every inch of Conveyor 48 but came up with nothing. No signs of a struggle, no clues—just silence.

Sometimes, late at night, I hear his voice again.

“Joel… I’m still here.”

I want to believe it’s my mind playing tricks, but deep down, I know better. Something took Jai that day. Something that still waits in the darkness of Conveyor 48.
