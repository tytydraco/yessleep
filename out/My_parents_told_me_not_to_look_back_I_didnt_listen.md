"Evelyn, Are you sure this is a good idea?” my friend, Jane asked with wide eyes.

“Come on, of course it is!” I replied, electrified on the idea I had suggested. 

"But didn’t your parents tell you to not look back? They must have a reason for that” Linette joined in. “Maybe, there are aliens?”

“Oh please, aliens? Seriously? It’s their fault for not telling me the reason. I have to find it out myself. Plus, I don't believe those stupid conspiracy theories about aliens. I have lived in that house for years and I am still well and alive right now,” I replied with a jubilant tone. "Trust me, it's gonna be fun! Plus, both of you can step out of your comfort zones."

That house I have just described was where I lived before moving into the city area. When I lived there, I often got called names such as ‘The Other Tarzan’ or ‘The Girl Who Lived In The Middle Of Nowhere’. That's because my house was surrounded by tons of trees, just like the Amazon Rainforest. It was as if I lived in a forest, in the middle of nowhere. The atmosphere of this wooden house was perfect. Everyday, the birds’ melodious singing, along with the bright, golden sunshine from the big fireball would shine onto my face, waking me up. It gets better when it rains, as the smell from the fresh wood and nature really awakes me.

I had to move from this rural house as it was difficult for me to go to school in the city area. However, I was told to never look back at the house when I left. Whenever I asked my parents about it, all they did was avoid this particular question. This always leaves me wondering why there is this peculiar rule. From the moment I left that wooden house, I have had this burning desire and dedication to find out the reason for this rule. I had to find out why. 

“Hey uhm, i know this is an extra thing, but do you mind calling a few more friends to follow us?” Linette asked with pleaful eyes. I agreed, as this was a great idea.

For the rest of the final school week, I gathered 3 more friends: Chris, Joel and Geselle. 

“Oh, why bother asking me? You know how much i like these type of adventures.” Chris chortled when I asked him. For some reason, they were not like the other 2 girls, but were rather exuberant for this trip to come after I explained about my situation. 

“Why don’t we make this a camp? I am sure staying overnight there would be so fun!” Chris suggested.

Everyone nodded, except for the two girls. “Wait! Remember Evelyn said something about her parents’ warning? I’m sure there’s a reason for that! I don’t think it’s a great idea to stay overnight…” Jane complained.

“Oh please, I am going back there to find out what the issue is. If you are scared, you can ‘drop out’ of here.” I complained.

All eyes were on the two girls. 

“Okay fine...But if anything happens…” Before Linette can finish her sentence, Geselle budged in. 

“Don’t jinx anything stupid okay? We will be fine, as long as we stay together.” All of us nodded. 

After the long dreaded school week, the long awaited day has finally arrived.

“Okay, so here’s the plan. The forest is 30 minutes to an hour away. We are gonna take a bus to a bus stop nearest to the forest, which is about 10 stops away. After that, we would need to walk into the woods. It might take awhile.” I said. "Yep..and also, the bus only comes once every hour, so we definitely cannot miss the first bus.”

At 8am, we gathered at a bus stop near the café, where we boarded bus 45. 

“The bus is so vacant, its kinda eerie,” Linette commented.

“It’s normal as bus 45 is rarely used. No one really goes to the places this bus goes.” I replied.

After that, most of us took a good nap which felt like an overnight sleep. Sometimes hours can feel like minutes. We tapped out of the bus, where we arrived at an old, deserted bus stop. 

“Everything here is covered in mould and grass,” Geselle commented.

“Yeah, this bus stop has been here since the 1900s. Kinda old.”

“Okay guys, enough yapping. Are y’all ready to walk into the woods?” Chris chuckled. 

All of us looked at each other. Taking a deep breath, we took a step into the woods, away from civilisation.

Sunlight shone through the small gaps from half-eaten leaves left by hungry caterpillars. The smell of greenery diffused into the air as we walked in. Birds’ chirping and crickets’ high pitched noises filled the air. Though we couldn’t see any signs of water, we could vividly hear loud splashes from waterfalls and rivers. The forest was full of life. It was really peaceful. Personally, I would rather live here than the city area.

“I love this atmosphere! Better than urban area!,” Jane smiled. All of us nodded with excitement. “This journey is definitely worthed it!”

As we descended deeper into the woods, things started to take a turn. Mammoth sized trees surrounded us, along with humongous brown, dried leaves that covered most sources of sunlight. It was also shaped in a way where there were crooked tree branches sticking out, which looks absolutely terrifying. The surface felt damper, and it was getting incredibly difficult to walk normally. Soon, the whole atmosphere turned pin-drop silent. We stopped seeing and hearing nature. It was as if we were gradually descending into a deep, dark abyss. 

“This is straight out of a horror movie,” Chris commented, while taking his torchlight out from his bag. 

As he switched on his high-power, gigantic torchlight, the rays of light did not reach anywhere far. The darkness simply ‘reflected’ the light back to us. 

“Oh wow, looks like you have just wasted your money on this high tech, expensive ‘special’ torchlight that doesn’t even work,” Geselle mocked. Chris stared down at Geselle with a grave look, rolling his eyes.

“It’s crazy how dark 9.30am can be,” Joel muttered, after looking at his watch. 

“Hey uhm…Evelyn, are you sure you are leading us to the correct path?” Geselle asked, concerned.

“Yeah, I have walked through this path for decades. It’s usually a little dark with nature, perhaps its climate change." I replied.

 As we walked, the surface became muddier. The only way we could walk was to lift our feets up one by one. The only thing leading us was Chris’s torchlight and my memory.

“Ew, do y’all smell a disgusting odour?” Linette asked, with a disgusted face. All of us looked at one another, with a confused expression. However, the atrocious odor hit us moments later as we walked towards Linette. The smell was simply too horrendous to be described. What I can say is that it gave off an old rotten smell, which is similar to decomposed matter. 

“Why is the ground getting softer and more moist?” Joel questioned.

“Chris, how about you shine your torchlight on the surface we are walking on,” I suggested, in hopes of us just stepping on mud. The moment Chris shone his torch on the ground, our heart dropped instantaneously. 

“What the fuck!” Geselle screamed vociferously. I could hear shrill cries from the Linette. All this time, we were walking on the bodies of dead animals. Some bodies were scattered on both sides of the path. Both dried and fresh blood stained our shoes.

 “Evelyn! Are you sure this is the path? Are you trying to kill us?” Joel shouted, horror strikened.
 
“Yes! I just don’t know what happened! It was never like this, dark and gloomy; it was never filled with dead matters and dried horrifying trees,” I shouted back. I felt devastated. The forest was never like this. What had happened? Climate change couldn’t be the only factor. There must've been something. Something else.

“Wait, why is there fresh blood?” Chris questioned with wide eyes. 

We looked at one another, eyes widened. “Uhm, maybe the weather affected them…right?” Evelyn said with an unsettling smile.

“I am not going to continue this journey. I don’t wanna die!” Linette screamed. 

“Look, even if you wanna turn back, its impossible. We have come this far into the forest. The 6 of us will always be together. For now, lets get out of this monstrosity.” I assured. 

“Not gonna lie, I am quite invested to find out what happened,” Chris said, dragging the rest to agree. We continued the journey reluctantly without any choice. 

After walking a little longer on the bodies with our lives depended on the rays coming from the torch, we reached a proper, walkable surface again. The strong smell slowly diffused away from our noses, fading away into the darkness. 

“It’s gone,” Everyone heaved a sigh of relief. 

Then, something struck our eyes. Somehow, we could see a small building in the darkness. As we got closer to it, it looked like a small wooden cabin, surrounded by tall, crooked trees. The air around us got thinner as well.

“Is that..is that your house?” Jane stuttered.

I could not believe my eyes. There used to be sunshine, greenery, life here. The place had turned completely upside down, becoming unrecognisable. I stood there, stunned at what I had seen. 

“Is this why your parents warned you to not come back?” Joel asked. 

“I don’t know. You know what? Let's go inside the house to take a look.” I replied, with tears forming in my eyes. The place that was once filled with my memories, had turned into some kind of horror movie.

The wooden floorboards creaked under our weight as we stepped into the house. I could feel my heartbeat in my ears. The air was thick, too  thick to breathe properly, and it smelled like mold mixed with something…older. Like the scent of time standing still. Everything was exactly how I left it; The faded brown couch, the cracked mirror by the hallway, my old shoes at the doorway, still muddied from my last time here.

“This place gives me the creeps,” Joel whispered.

“It looks… untouched,” Jane muttered. “Like someone pressed pause on it.”

I forced a smile. “That’s..that’s ‘cause no one’s been here, duh.” But I wasn’t so sure anymore.

As we ventured deeper into the house, Linette opened the door to my old room. She froze.

“Uhm, Evelyn?” she called. “You might wanna look at this.”I pushed past her and looked in.

My room was clean. Too clean. My bedsheets were ironed flat. My notebooks were stacked. On my desk was a drawing I had made when I was nine, of a girl in the woods, standing alone. I hadn’t seen that in years. But what got me was the photo. It was placed neatly at the center of my bed. A black-and-white image of a young girl with dark, tangled hair, standing at the edge of the forest. Her back was facing the camera, but I felt a shiver crawl up my spine.

It was me.

Not just looked like me. It was ME, but I never took this photo. I don’t remember this moment. I never owned a camera.

“Guys… there’s something wrong with this,” I said, holding the photo with trembling fingers.

Chris pointed at the wall beside my window. “Okay, what the actual hell is that?”

We all turned. There, scrawled faintly into the wood, were the words:

DON’T LOOK BACK
DON’T LOOK BACK
DON’T LOOK BACK
SHE’LL REMEMBER WHO SHE IS.

“What… does that mean?” Geselle asked, voice shaky.

Before I could say anything, the torch light Chris was holding flickered. Once, twice. then died completely.

A loud thud echoed from the kitchen.
“Who’s there?!” Chris shouted, turning his useless torchlight on again..and it surprisingly worked. 

Another thud. This time, closer.

My breath caught in my throat. Something in me felt like it was clicking into place, like gears grinding back into motion after being dormant for too long. I felt dizzy; My head spun, images flashing: trees, eyes, screams, a woman pulling me by the hand, whispering “Don’t let them know.”

“What’s happening to her?” Jane asked. 

“Evelyn, hey…are you okay?”

But I wasn’t. I remembered.

“I remembered.” Those two words slipped out of my mouth like air, but they echoed in the room like a scream. Everyone turned to me, their faces a mixture of fear and pure confusion.

“What… what do you mean? Remember what?” Geselle asked, her voice trembling.

I turned to face them, feeling my head spin. My vision wasn’t normal anymore. The walls were sort of… glowing? Waving? Like everything was alive and breathing. The air shimmered. I felt like I was floating.

“My parents… they weren’t protecting me,” I muttered. “They were warning everyone else, about me.”

Suddenly, the thudding from the kitchen stopped. The house grew quiet again, but not in a peaceful way. More like… waiting. Then, from the dark hallway, something slid out. It didn’t walk. It didn’t crawl. It just moved. It was tall, thin, crooked in the wrong places. A shadow with too many limbs.

“Don’t look at it!” I screamed. “Eyes down, now!”

Everyone dropped their gaze, except for Chris. He stared, frozen in place. His mouth opened slightly, wider, and wider.

“Chris?” Linette whispered.

He didn’t reply. His eyes rolled back. His body jerked like a glitching video game character before he collapsed with a heavy thud onto the wooden floor. His mouth stayed wide open, eyes staring blankly at the ceiling.

“CHRIS?!” Jane shrieked, kneeling beside him.

“Don’t touch him,” I said quickly. “Don’t… just don’t.”

They all looked at me like I had gone insane. Jane’s eyes were wide and glossy. Joel’s hands were shaking. Linette was backing away from me.

“You brought us here!” Joel yelled, voice cracking. “You knew! You knew something was wrong!”

“I didn’t know what I was,” I replied quietly, voice shaky. “But I do now.”

No one said anything. All I could hear was the house breathing…and the shadow watching.
Chris wasn’t moving, not twitching, not blinking, just lying there like a broken doll, eyes wide open, staring at absolutely nothing. The kind of stare that made you want to look away but couldn’t.

“Chris?” I whispered. No response. The others stood completely still, as though even a breath would shatter something sacred. I stepped closer slowly, my body trembling. “He’s not… dead, right?”

Jane stared at him in horror. “Why… why are his eyes open like that?” I didn’t answer, because the truth was, his eyes didn’t look empty. They looked fixed, as if something was still inside, watching. Then, the ceiling creaked again. That same low, drawn-out groan of something heavy shifting just above us.

Jane grabbed my arm. “Evelyn, please tell us what’s going on.”

“I don’t know everything,” I said, my voice shaking. “But… I used to sleepwalk when I lived here. My parents never told me what they saw, but they would always find me outside in the mud, surrounded by weird things.”

“What things?” Joel asked, eyes narrowing.

“Symbols, bones. Once… a dead rabbit. Its eyes were missing.”

No one spoke.

I could feel it again. The air pressing down on us like we were being watched.

“Something’s wrong with this place,” Geselle whispered. “It’s like it remembers you.”

I looked at the wall; Fresh claw marks, deep and raw thay had been etched into the wood. Words.

YOU LOOKED BACK.
NOW WE REMEMBER TOO.

I took a step back. The temperature dropped further. It felt like the house was breathing. Then behind me, Chris’s body twitched.
And I knew. We weren’t alone. We had never been alone.

We stood frozen. No one dared to move.
Chris’s limbs shifted unnaturally, like a puppet tugged by invisible strings. His neck snapped to the side with a sickening crack. His eyes remained open, wide and unmoving. But his body… it moved.

“Chris?” I called out, barely audible. 

He stood up slowly. His limbs trembled as though resisting something. Something stronger. He wasn’t responding. He wasn’t there.

Jane backed away, her voice a soft whimper. “That’s not him.” 

And she was right. It wasn’t. His eyes rolled back. His lips moved, but it wasn’t his voice that came out. It was mine.

“I told you not to look back.”

Everyone froze. My stomach dropped. I felt something clawing inside me. Panic? Guilt? Recognition?

“No,” I muttered. “This isn’t happening.”
The walls groaned again. The same low, dragging noise echoed from upstairs, like something was crawling.

Geselle grabbed my arm. “We have to leave. Now.”

I nodded. There was no time to think. We ran. Through the hallway, into the open air but even the outside didn’t feel safe anymore. The forest had changed. It wasn’t silent now. It was humming. A low, eerie vibration that seemed to come from the ground itself. Then we saw them.

Figures. In the trees. Tall, unmoving silhouettes watching from the edges of the forest. Too still to be human. Too dark to be real.
Joel stopped in his tracks. “They weren’t there earlier.” “They’ve always been there,” I said quietly. “We just didn’t see them.”

The trees rustled, but there was no wind. The shadows in the distance seemed to breathe.
“We need to go back,” Jane said. “Back into the house. We can’t stay out here.”
The house was a trap. But the forest was worse. There was no right choice, only a direction. Hece we turned back.
The cabin door creaked open before we touched it. None of us said a word. We stepped back inside like we were entering a tomb.

Chris’s body was gone, only his shoes remained, and a trail of dark, sticky footprints that led toward the basement door. I had never seen that door before. It was hidden behind the storage shelf. And now it was wide open. A staircase descended into pitch black.

I couldn’t breathe. Joel stepped forward. “He went down there.”

“No,” Jane whispered. “No, we’re not following. We’re not that stupid.”But we were, because something in us knew that we had to go down, not because we wanted to, but because this house wasn’t letting us leave until we did. I led the way, holding Chris’ flickering torchlight as we descended step by step into darkness.

The air was damp. Rotten. The walls were pulsing, like they were made of flesh and not wood. Symbols covered every surface, ancient, twisting…Alive.

At the center of the room…Chris stood, but he wasn't alone.

Around him were the figures. Not shadows anymore. They were real. Tall, thin, and grotesquely human. Their faces were smooth, featureless, except for one thing: Eyes. Hundreds of eyes, embedded all over their heads, staring, unblinking. 

They turned to us as one, and smiled.
