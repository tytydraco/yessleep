Friend and I (both 21F) went to Applebee’s for a few $1 margaritas, than went off to a park where she said she knew a spot. 

We go 20min away to this park.  We go down this path that takes us around 10 min to this Bay Area. We find a nice log and sit there and watch the sunset. As we were relaxing on the log a family strolls by with their dog to hangout on the other side of the shore. A few minutes go by and a couple comes through and sets up, they eat a big pineappe with a knife??

The sun sets but it’s still light out, we didn’t think about the walk back.. eventually we go to head back and it’s dark, it’s about 9pm. The wooden area we have to walk through is getting really dark..

We start walking and she gets her phone camera out, it’s pitch black at this point. We start talking about how creepy it was. 

We felt an uneasy feeling, that feeling you get, afraid that something is behind you. 
Well we’re walking along, we go across the bridge up a little hill and all of a sudden we hear loud fast footsteps on the bridge.. 

I see light from what appeared to be from his phone. Going back and forth as if he was sprinting.
 
We panicked
 
We start running and I’m thinking, no way this guy is chasing us. 

His footsteps on the bridge kinda sounded like he was on a bike. I thought we’ll go up this steep hill on our left, no way this guy is following us and no way he’d go up the hill on his bike. 

Turns out.. there was no bike. We stopped running as we didn’t hear anything. She flashes her light behind us and there’s a silhouette of a man jogging towards us. His body posture seemed to be he was tired from running. 

We kept running and stopping to see if he was still chasing us. And then again we hear footsteps running towards us. We keep looking back while running to make sure he’s not right on us. 

At this point friend screamed “hey” and “help” in a panicked voice and he screamed back “HEY” then after that said “WHATRE YOU SCARED?” (His voice was deep and scary, the way he said it was as if he was mocking us)

We keep running, we’re out of breath but we can’t stop right now, we fear for our lives.

 she’s on the phone with the police. We finally hit a paved road, no where near her car, we were lost with a man fucking chasing us.  when I took us up the hill, that was the wrong path than  we originally took. 

The road was dark with only three houses, after that it was just road and the woods on either side

We knock on a house, lights are on but no one answers. We start down the road to their neighbor, I look back and see a silhouette of a man walking by that first persons house. He got up to the fence and creeped back into the darkness. 

That second neighbor helped us. His wife got us some water and the police came to take us to her car. 
That was the most traumatic experience I think I’ve ever had. 
The intentions of the man felt sinister. And the way he was yelling at us felt so uncanny. I hate this feeling I have. And I have so many questions that won’t be answered. 
I can’t get this one question out of my head, what if he caught up to us?
Fuck.
