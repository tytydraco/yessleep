# Chapter 1 - Golden Memories

*I still think back. I think back and just remember her. Her golden blond hair glowed in the sunlight. It reminds me of days when we were younger. The sun always seemed to be shining when I was with her. I miss her laugh, her soft chuckle, which brought warmth on the inside. I wish I could go back and relive her all over again. Even if it was met with the same fate, I would still go back and enjoy the short while we had. It's impossible to go about my life the same way without her now. She brings me hope, hope that I might be able to just stand beside her. I don't go a day without thinking about my Maya. Some may think it's unhealthy, but I don't really have a choice.* 

We met during high school.

The cafeteria was a symphony of chaos, a carefully orchestrated pandemonium that somehow, for most people, just equaled lunchtime. For me, it was… work. Constant, draining work. The fluorescent lights hummed a relentless, high-pitched whine that vibrated in my teeth. The clatter of trays, a metallic avalanche echoing off the hard tile floor, overlapped with the shrieking bursts of laughter and the low, rumbling drone of a hundred conversations, all vying for sonic dominance. Smells warred in the air: disinfectant battling stale pizza, sweet, sickly syrup from the milk cartons clashing with the vinegary tang of cheap ketchup. It was a sensory assault, a battlefield I had to navigate twice a day, every school day.

I stood near the entrance, clutching my lunch bag – a brown paper sack I'd meticulously folded and sealed, a small island of order in the swirling chaos. I scanned the room, my gaze moving in deliberate, short bursts, avoiding sustained eye contact with the milling students. Faces blurred, a sea of shifting expressions I struggled to decode. I wasn't good at faces, not in the way other people seemed to be. I noticed details, yes – the precise angle of an eyebrow, the way someone's lips curved – but piecing those details together into a coherent whole, into understanding what those expressions meant, was like trying to assemble a puzzle with pieces that kept changing shape.

I was looking for Maya. I usually met her by the far wall, near the windows that overlooked the patchy, brown grass of the football field. She was… different, in the cafeteria chaos. Not immune, exactly, but she seemed to move through it with a kind of grace I envied. She didn't flinch at the sudden crashes, didn't seem overwhelmed by the sheer volume. I'd watched her sometimes, from across the room, and it was like she had a volume knob in her head, able to tune out the noise, filter out the excess. I wish I knew how to do that.

Then I saw her. Across the crowded room, near our usual spot. She was already there, sitting at a table by herself, her backpack slumped beside her. She wasn't looking at anyone, just staring out the window, her expression… I hesitated, searching for the right word in my internal lexicon. Not sad, exactly. More… muted. Like a radio turned down low, the stations are still playing, but the sound is barely audible. I started to move towards her, navigating the crowded aisles with practiced precision, my gaze fixed on her as a fixed point in the swirling landscape. I could feel the press of bodies around me, the stray bumps and shoves, but I focused on Maya, on the steady point of her presence, trying to filter out the rest.

When I reached the table, I stopped a few feet away, giving her space, a silent question. She blinked then, as if just noticing me, and her face shifted. The muted expression… lifted. Not completely, not all at once, but like a slow sunrise, a faint warmth spreading across her features. A smile started to form, tentative at first, then widening, becoming… brighter. It reached her eyes, crinkling the corners, and for a moment, the cafeteria noise seemed to recede, the fluorescent hum to soften. Just for a moment.

"Hey Liam, did you do well on that math test?" Maya questioned.

"Of course, I did well, or at least I think I did well. Won't know until Monday," I replied.

Maya looked at me comfortingly. "You always do well, I don't think you've studied once this year, and yet you still have above-average grades, it's not fair, really. Well, anyway, I had an idea. I hope you are free this weekend because I was wondering if you wanted to go somewhere this weekend?" She asked with a dramatically large grin.

Already excited about what she had planned, I quickly said, "I'm free this weekend. I'm guessing it's a surprise? You know I don't like surprises."

Maya squinted her eyes and said, "Well, how'd you know? But trust me, trust me, this time you'll like it!"

I believed her, although I truly didn't like surprises. I knew in my mind that any time with Maya was going to be a good time.

*Back then, I used to wonder what I would do without Maya. Maya didn't have perfect attendance, and there were days without her. They definitely weren't fun, but they were not terrible because I knew I would see her the next day. Now I fall asleep at night, thinking she will be there again when I awake.*

Every day with Maya felt like an adventure, and this weekend was no different. I was up and ready for Maya to call to come pick her up. It didn't take long before the phone rang. While walking to my car, I was covered with sunlight, bringing a smile to my face. When I came to pick Maya up, she was waiting outside, sitting on a porch swing. The sun perfectly illuminated her hair. She got up wearing a bright red dress.

"You look amazing, must have something special planned," I said as she approached the car.

"Nothing much," she said, grinning.

"Well, where to?" I asked.

Maya waited, attempting to build anticipation before she said, "North Wood Botanical Garden."

I knew exactly what her plan was. The Botanical garden was the place we went to on our first date. I couldn't believe it had already been three years. Maya broke the silence.

"I figured this would be a good way to start our senior summer, school ends in just a few weeks."

I was ready for the summer; I had already received my college acceptance letter in the mail. I wasn't sure what her plan was yet, so we sort of avoided that topic. The fear of having different plans and having to split ways was increasing every day, the closer we got to summer. I always wanted to ask what she planned, but was too scared to hear the answer. I smiled, trying to hide my thoughts about the future before responding, "It's going to be a great summer, just like last summer and the summer before that."

Once we arrived, Maya quickly led me to the bench where we sat three whole years before. Looking out at the fields of flowers, then looking back at Maya, the birds chirping, the sun glowing, it all caused a fire to build inside of me. I could not think of a better way to spend this afternoon. Frankly, I could sit there with Maya and watch the clouds my whole life and die a happy man. She meant the world to me, and I wasn't ready to let her go, but every second felt like it was counting down the seconds before she revealed she was going to a different college or something along those lines. I loved every second with her, but also couldn't imagine wasting a second of our time together. The contradicting feelings caused me to feel anxious, so I stood up from the bench.

Maya stood beside me and held my hand, gently resting her head on my shoulder. Maya started swaying back and forth gently before gently pushing and pulling me along with her.

"Dance with me," Maya said.

I wasn't one to dance, especially in public, but when I was with Maya, I felt like I could do anything. So I took her hand, and we danced. We danced for a while, both wishing it would last forever. I looked into her eyes as we swayed, noticing for a fleeting second a slight shift in her smile, a momentary distance in her gaze before it was gone, and her smile returned, warm and present as before. My heart sank, and I worried this was it, our final goodbye. Suppose she was giving me one last day with her before she broke the silence with terrible news.

Maya noticed this and asked me, "Is something wrong, Liam?"

I couldn't hide my fear anymore and decided to ask, "Maya, I'm worried about next year. I'm going to college here. What are you doing?"

Maya looked into my eyes with a grin. "I'm glad you asked. I got the job here in town! Sorry I waited so long, I just wanted to tell you the good news during something special."

I was left speechless. On one side, I was overjoyed, but I was still concerned about Maya's faltering glance. I was left feeling she was hiding something else, but I decided to forget about it and enjoy the rest of the day.
