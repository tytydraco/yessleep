I am an 18 yo female. Last week I was exorcised against my will by my mother, step-father and an exorcist priest.

After she married my step-father, many years ago, my mother was sucked into his religious obsession. She developed a manic distrust of the world, seeing demonic influences around every corner. I was pulled out of school, kept at home almost constantly, and subjected to a gruelling prayer regime. I only had one friend growing up, a girl from the neighborhood who would sneak into the garden to play with me when the grown-ups weren’t looking. 

I believe that my turning 18 triggered my mother’s paranoia. Even though she and my step-father raised me to be entirely dependent on them, they knew that if I decided to, I was now able to leave. They began to look at me with fear in their eyes. Whenever I walked into a room, they would fall silent mid-conversation and hold their breath until I was gone. During prayer, the words came out as whispers from their mouth, as if they were uttering something obscene. One night, I woke up to go to the restroom and found my bedroom door locked. 

I exploded. This was too much. I started screaming and kicking the door with all my might, only to discover that they had installed a bolt while I was sleeping. 

I wet myself that night.

After that incident, they decided that I was becoming too dangerous and had the exorcist priest come to the house.

They tied me to the bed, arms and legs spread apart. The rope cut through my skin. I begged them to untie it, or at least loosen it a bit. The exorcist warned them that the demon inside me was going to cry and plead… they shouldn’t listen to anything I say. 

The exorcist placed himself at the end of the bed, bible in hand, with my mother and step-father at both sides. How hideous they looked. Twisted with fear and cruelty. And the worst of them all was the priest. 

He started reading from the bible - or rather, yelling the bible at me with such force that I burst into tears. The man threw his arms in the air excitedly: “You see! The bible makes her cry! She is possessed!” In a panic, I pulled on the ropes, trying to set myself free - my mother screamed as if I was a corpse rising from the grave, while my step-father and the priest pushed me down violently. 

Eventually, I figured out that the only way out of that torture chamber was through their delusion. I started speaking in two voices - my normal voice and a raspy voice that was meant to represent the demon’s. I staged a conversation between the demon saying he would never leave me, and me ordering him to go away. Go away! Go away!

Finally, I simmered down and began to recite prayer upon prayer in my normal voice, until my tormentors were convinced that I had been saved.

The next day, I picked up my courage and went to the police. They took me more seriously than I thought they would. I must have been visibly distressed, not to mention the wounds on my ankles and wrists. They placed me in a women’s shelter, pending an investigation into my family.

I was proud of myself for taking action, although the more time passed the more I have been wondering if it will make any difference. When I was younger, someone reported my parents to social services. Social workers came snooping around the house, there was some commotion for a brief period of time, then they backed off and nothing changed.

Life at the shelter has been more peaceful than at home, but lonely as well. I missed my girlfriend - the only person who ever brightened my days in that god-forsaken house. This afternoon, she surprised me with a visit. As I told her what I had been through, she held my hand and offered me a kind smile, her black eyes contemplating me as if I was the only person in the world. 

When the time came for her to leave, I hugged her tightly. She licked my ear with her forked tongue and whispered: “I’ll pick you up at midnight. We’re going to skin them alive.”
