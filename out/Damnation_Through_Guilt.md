Two men were seated in a dark sarcophagus-like room. There was something off about this room. It’s almost as if the walls were possessed with life. In this room was a father and his son. Their appearances were a stark contrast. The father had eye bags, a scruffy beard and lifeless eyes. The son possessed a much more refined appearance. He was cleanly shaven, had bright blue mesmerizing eyes and smooth baby- like skin. Not a word was spoken between the two. 


The overwhelming tension of being in the room was enough to crush any person. The air was the cause, it  possessed an uneasy weight to it. The father spoke in a dark authoritative tone “My son, what more do you ask of me.” The son responds “I ask nothing of you, the time for requests has passed.” The silence continues after the traded statements. 


The room's wallpaper had been peeling. What remains underneath this wallpaper is something like a library with decaying books. The father puts his hands over his face and heavily inhales then exhales. In a raspy voice he said “I swear, These walls, they're familiar” The son does not respond, for why should he? The father's suffering was of his own doing. Time passes and the son finally speaks in his calm charismatic voice “Why keep torturing yourself?  What is it you think you have done?” The father’s eyes sharpen as if the question evoked animosity.


 His gaze began to fix on his son. “You're not even here. You died 10 years ago? Why must you haunt me?” The son remained oddly undisturbed. The son leaned back in his chair, his face retreated into the darkness. The father stood up and walked impatiently towards the door. The room is decaying and what remains is an unsettling mess. The door he approaches is not normal, it’s covered in flesh and pulsing faintly. He lays his hand upon the handle and opens the door, as he gazes out he sees nothingness. He takes a deep breath quelling the uneasy thoughts then reluctantly steps forward and falls into this abyss. 


He awakes in another chair. This time the father observes his surroundings more carefully. The room looks like a hospital patient room. It possessed the uneasiness you come to associate with hospital rooms. His chair sat in front of a bed; in this bed a decayed fragile man rested. His body was filled with tubes and other devices to keep him alive. But that’s all it was, a body, no consciousness.


 The bed seemed less like a bed and more like a sepulchre. The father seems confused as he does not recognize this young man. The father asked a question “Hello? Who are you?” To no avail, he did not receive a response. The father once more stood and attempted to leave this room, but the door would not budge. The room was not willing to accept his departure so soon.
 The father, trying to rationalize the situation he was in, started looking around. He walked over to the counter and examined some papers which were lying in a stack. He finds a newspaper and he begins to read. The headline of the newspaper discusses a car crash. But the date was not contemporaneous with our present. It was ten years in the past. He continues reading and as he reads, the room starts changing once more.


 The tiles in the floor start chipping and breaking, producing jarring sounds. It sounds as if thousands of brittle plates were dropped all at once. Once more the wallpaper starts to peel and fall down, revealing the library once more. Although this time it's different, the books are gone and the shelves lay dormant lacking restoration. The father finally reads the most important line this paper could offer to him. The names of the two people involved, Richard Oizys himself and Collin Oizys his son. Richard's emotions envelope into a swirly mass of confusion and shock.
 He can almost feel his mind deteriorating. Richard lets his emotions rupture and screams “What kind of sick joke is this! My son died 10 years ago? This is not my son, it is not. I refuse!” As he spoke, his words became more unintelligible.  Instead, it sounded like the rapidly rancid ramblings of a mad man. Richard, breathing heavily attempting to calm his emotions, walked over to this body. Richard’s eyes welled with tears as he began to accept that this was his son. His voice shaky and his body trembling he spoke “I miss you so much kid, I don’t think I can keep going without you.” His tears start streaming down his face as he holds his son's disfigured arm.


 His voice finally broke, no longer hiding how he feels anymore he says, “I’m so sorry kid.” Richard calms himself. Although his tears did not stop he calmly spoke, “I want to remember you for the kid you were and not what that crash made you.” He slowly reached down and unplugged his own child’s life support. He spoke one last message to his son “The greatest thing I’ve ever done is reuniting with you, kid.” The machines started making a cacophony of sounds and nurses rushed in to find Collin’s lifeline unplugged and his heart flatlined. As the nurses fluttered in, they opened the curtains brightening the room. There Richard sat in the chair beside the bed, his eyes shining purposefully, but yet the nurses seemed not to notice him.
