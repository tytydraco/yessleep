Nobody slept after we left Buzz on that ledge. We just sat around the dying campfire, watching the tree line, waiting for something we couldn't name. The hole felt closer, like it'd crept up on us while we were passed out. Like a fucking predator or something.

Joseph arrived at dawn with a stranger.

The new guy was maybe fifty, with gray stubble and the kind of posture that screamed military. He wore clean work clothes that looked like they'd never seen actual work, and he carried himself with the calm efficiency of someone who'd built bridges in war zones and didn't consider this mountain particularly impressive. Dude scanned the camp like he was taking inventory at a warehouse. Checking boxes in his head.

"This is Koke," Joseph said, his voice flat as always. "He will oversee retrieval operations going forward. Buzz failed to maintain adequate safety protocols. That failure has been corrected." He held his briefcase a little tighter. The cube was in there. I could feel it somehow, even through the leather. "Work resumes in ten minutes. Mr. Koke will provide specific directives."

Koke didn't introduce himself. Just nodded once and started walking the perimeter of the hole, occasionally crouching to examine the cut edges, the cable system, the ladder. Taking measurements in his head. Building a mental schematic. When he spoke, his voice was flat and procedural, like he was reading from a manual.

"SOP revision effective immediately: ninety-minute rotations, two-man units below grade, three operators surface-side. No deviation from protocol. All large stones; basketball-sized or larger, dark composition, glassy surface will be flagged for inspection. No freelancing. No souvenirs. Questions?"

Nobody had questions. Or nobody dared to ask them.

That's when I noticed her.

A woman, maybe late twenties, already in work gear like she'd been here for days instead of hours. She had sharp features and darker skin, her hair pulled back in a tight bun. She worked with quiet efficiency, checking equipment, organizing tools, moving through the camp like she knew exactly where everything was. When she caught me staring, she gave a small, professional smile that didn't reach her eyes.

"Carli," she said, extending a gloved hand. "New hire. You must be Thomas."

How did she know my name?

"Yeah," I managed. "Welcome to hell, I guess."

She laughed. It sounded genuine but felt practiced. "I've worked worse sites. At least you guys have a generator."

Something about her was fucked. Not threatening. She moved like she was following a script.. But I was exhausted and paranoid and maybe projecting, so I shook her hand and tried to feel hopeful that someone new and seemingly competent had arrived.

Plato looked worse in daylight. The black dust had permanently stained the skin under his eyes, and he'd developed a light cough that brought up dark flecks onto his palm. He kept staring at nothing, head cocked like he was listening to something just below the range of human hearing. The cube was gone—Joseph had it locked away—but whatever it had done to Plato was still working.

"You good, man?" I asked quietly.

"It's tuning me, man," he muttered, voice flatter than it should be. Like the cube was gone but the station was still coming in clear. Getting clearer."

"What words?"

He finally looked at me. His pupils were dilated despite the bright morning sun. "Instructions, man. Like someone's broadcasting directly into my skull. Can't change the channel."

Koke paired me with Carli on bucket duty. Safe job. Easy job. Just hauling loads up from the hole and sorting what came up. She worked without complaint, moved efficiently, barely spoke. But she watched everything. Especially Plato, who'd stopped working entirely to stare into the tree line where the soot-men had manifested yesterday.

"Your friend's got the thousand-yard stare," Carli said casually, coiling rope. "He see something out there?"

It sounded like concern. Felt like an interrogation.

"He's just tired. We all are."

"Mmm." She made a note in a small pocket notebook I hadn't seen her carrying before. "How long's he been like that?"

"Like what?"

"Checking out. Talking to himself. Classic dissociation markers."

The clinical language made my skin prickle. "You a psychologist or something?"

She smiled that practiced smile again. "Just observant. You spend enough time on remote sites, you learn to spot when people are cracking. It's a safety thing."

Before I could respond, someone screamed from the hole.

Not the working scream of exertion or surprise. The animal scream of someone experiencing catastrophic pain. We ran to the edge. Eddie's partner was scrambling up the ladder, white-faced and shaking, calling for help in a voice that kept cracking into falsetto.

"Pull him up! Jesus Christ pull him up!"

We hauled on the winch. Eddie came up thrashing, and I understood the screaming immediately. His left leg below the knee was wrong. Not broken. Not crushed. Liquefied. The bone was visible in places, surrounded by meat that looked like it had been through a blender, and the whole mess was starting to harden into a gray, cement-like substance.

"The floor!" Eddie shrieked, eyes rolling back in his head. "The fucking floor turned to soup! It swallowed my leg and set like concrete! Get it off get it off GET IT OFF—"

Koke was there in seconds. No panic. No hesitation. He had a tourniquet from somewhere, applied it with practiced efficiency, and was barking into a satellite phone before most of us had even processed what we were seeing.

"Medevac required. Grid reference follows. One casualty, severe trauma to lower left extremity, rapid onset. Request immediate dust-off, over." He paused, listening. "Understood. Secure the site and maintain schedule."

Maintain schedule.

Eddie was still screaming. And Koke's priority was maintaining schedule.

The helicopter came within the hour. Eddie was sedated and loaded, still whimpering about the floor eating him. Koke watched the helicopter disappear over the ridge, made a notation in his own logbook, and turned back to us.

"Structural integrity of the excavation is compromised. Recommend enhanced caution when working below the forty-foot mark. Resume operations."

Just like that. Eddie became a safety notation and we went back to work.

But the work changed. Koke had specific requirements now. Only large stones. Dark composition. Glassy surfaces. Everything else was disregarded, piled to the side. When a stone met his criteria, he'd take it to a folding table he'd set up, turn his back to the crew for privacy, and crack it open with a geologist's pick. Then he'd examine the interior with a jeweler's loupe, make notes in his log, and usually toss the pieces aside.

He was looking for something specific. And he was methodical as a machine about it.

Plato had stopped working entirely. He stood at the edge of the tree line, breath fogging in the warm afternoon air, staring at something none of us could see.

"They're closer," he whispered when I approached. "Not watching anymore. Praying. Can't you hear them?"

I heard nothing but wind and the generator's hum. When I glanced back toward camp, I caught Carli watching us. Not worried. Not surprised. Confirmed. Like Plato's breakdown was something she'd been waiting for. 

Jim walked past us, not making eye contact. He muttered just loud enough for me to hear: "New face, same machine. They'll grind you boys down to bone dust and order a new part before you hit the ground."

Not a threat. A fact delivered with devastating, weary certainty.

Late afternoon, a worker brought up the right stone.

I watched Koke crack it open and go very still. A deep glow pulsed from inside, the light cast shadows on his face that made him look ancient, carved from stone himself.

He didn't smile. Didn't celebrate. Just closed the halves carefully, wrapped them in cloth, and signaled Joseph with a single raised finger.

Joseph's face when he arrived was the closest thing to emotion I'd ever seen from him. Grimly satisfied. He inspected the stone, made a call on his satellite phone that lasted exactly thirty seconds, and then turned to address the crew.

"Excellent progress. We've achieved a critical benchmark in our extraction pipeline."

Ten minutes later, another worker "found" a chunk of twisted metal in the dirt pile. Joseph examined it with those empty eyes, made another call, and peeled off five hundred-dollar bills like he was tipping a waiter.

The effect on the crew was immediate. Exhaustion evaporated. Fear transmuted into hungry, desperate energy. Everyone started working faster, digging more frantically, examining every rock like it might be their lottery ticket out of poverty.

Carli just watched, taking notes with her eyes on how quickly desperate men could be redirected from terror to avarice with the right financial stimulus.

I felt sick.

That night around the campfire, the crew was buzzing. Plans were being made. Debts imagined as paid. Futures calculated. The older workers were cynical but calculating, already spending money they hadn't earned. The younger ones were lit up like kids on Christmas morning.

Jim sat in the shadows, sharpening a tool with long, deliberate strokes. When the excited chatter hit a peak, he spoke without looking up.

"You think that's your money?" His voice cut through the noise like a blade. "That's lubrication. Makes you run smoother until you break. They paid the same bonus to a kid named Davis back in '09. Bought himself a guitar with his first payout. They found him in a dry creek bed three days later. Wasn't in any report. Just a line item in someone's spreadsheet: 'Asset Replaced.'"

The fire crackled. Nobody spoke.

"You're not workers, you're daily active users. Meat-based processing units running their extraction algorithm. And when your engagement metrics drop? They sunset your account. Simple as that," Jim continued, voice low and gravelly. 

"And when you're spent, when you break down or malfunction or stop being profitable, they replace you. Simple as that. Koke knows it. Carli knows it. Joseph sure as hell knows it. Only question is when you boys will figure it out."

Carli's mask didn't slip. She just watched him with those evaluating eyes, probably adding "hostile to management" or "poor team morale" to her notes.

I looked at Plato. He was scribbling in his notebook with frantic energy, filling page after page with symbols that looked uncomfortably similar to the ones in that shack. His hand moved faster than thinking should allow. Not writing. Transcribing.

My hands were already fucked. Calloused, stained, looking like they belonged to someone else. Someone who'd work until they broke, then get tossed in the hole with the rest of the trash.

In our tent that night, I tried one more time.

"We're leaving. Tonight. Right now. We're not becoming a fucking cautionary tale Jim tells the next batch of suckers."

Plato looked at me with those dilated eyes. When he spoke, his voice had that corporate flatness that made my skin crawl.

"It's too late. The work is done. The resource has been extracted." He tapped his temple. "What do you think happens to the drill bit after it strikes oil, T? You think they clean it and save it for next time? Or do they leave it in the hole and order a new one?"

He wasn't talking about the mountain.

He was talking about himself.

I unzipped the tent flap to get air, to clear my head, to do anything but look at what my friend was becoming. That's when I saw Carli, standing near the edge of camp, talking quietly into a satellite phone. Too far to hear words. Close enough to see the clinical efficiency of her body language. She was filing a report.

Movement in the shadows. Jim, standing outside his own tent, also watching her. Our eyes met across the camp. He gave a slow, almost imperceptible shake of his head.

*I see it too. And it doesn't matter. We're all already forgotten.*

I lay back in my sleeping bag, listening to Plato's ragged breathing and the distant hum of the generator and the hole's endless respiration. 

___

*Because I was happy upon the heath,*

*And smil'd among the winters snow:*

*They clothed me in the clothes of death,*

*And taught me to sing the notes of woe.*
