Since I only told you about things that happened in the past in my last two posts, here's an update on what's currently going on. Yesterday, Casimir found a YouTube channel with a bunch of videos that are very obviously footage from my woods. There's a clip of a gaggle of rusalki, that gross-ass two-headed bear that sometimes eats my trash and even the Leshy stalking by. My brother is working on somehow taking them down. Meanwhile, I've been trying to find out where Jacek lives these days.

I guess I could try and find another occultist, but I need someone reliable, and as much as I hate the thought of having to see him again, I know he's the only one I can trust.

That's why I've been scouring social media once again, trying to find a trace of him. I went into this expecting not to come up with anything, but it seems that digitalization has reached even my ex. I found him on an obscure forum discussing black magic (because of course that's where he'd be). I wasn't sure it was him at first, but the username *CaptainHyacinth* kind of piqued my interest. He wrote the way he'd used to speak, his boyish humor always swinging along while still seeming more savvy than anyone else. He also claimed to be in the direct employ of the Devil, so that checked out as well. The more I clicked through his post history, the more certain I became. 

Eventually, I decided to just create an account under the name of *YourForestWife* and shoot him a DM. With shaking fingers, I started typing. 

*"Jacek Hettmann?"*

The reply came surprisingly fast.

**"Wtf, who is this?"**

*"Fiona Novak. Any chance you remember me? Sorry for reaching out like this. I know it's been a long time and I get it if you don't want to talk to me. But hear me out, please?"*

Maybe that had been too direct. I waited for him to text back for about five minutes, but nothing came. My heart was beating kind of quickly. I needed to get away from that screen.

"Cas, how's it going?" I called out, hurrying over to my brother who was scrolling on his laptop.

"Pretty good," he muttered, not looking up. "No one believes these videos are real anyways. I don't think we need to worry about them."

"I found Jacek."

Casimir whipped his head up. "No shit. For real?"

I nodded. "Texted him. He's not answering, though."

"Oh, he will. Give him some time."

"We don't have any time! And how are you so sure?"

He shrugged. "I just know. You were his first girl. You don't forget someone like that."

I frowned. "Do *you* remember your first girlfriend?"

My brother laughed. "Oh, hell no."

Feeling a distinct need for fresh air, I headed outside. Maybe I was just going to have myself an outdoor day. A thick blanket of glittering snow was covering the red meadow as I stride across it, each step accompanied by a satisfying crunch. I hadn't taken a walk like that for a while. Just movement for me to relax, not to seek out some abandoned building or dump a body. I knew I couldn't run from my problems, but I wasn't running; I was only taking a break. I stopped to chat with Gus for a minute before proceeding into the frost-laden thicket. 

The wildlife in my forest—the *actual* wildlife—keeps mostly to itself. I already mentioned that there aren't any birds anymore, so any chirping you might hear in these parts means trouble. All the actual animals mostly stay in hiding due to the amount of superior predators around. There's the occasional rabbit or deer you might come across, as well as some squirrels and other smaller critters.

Suddenly, the relative quiet and serenity was disturbed by a loud, drawn-out scream that immediately stopped me in my tracks. It sounded like an animal, an actual animal—in fact, I was pretty sure it was a deer. Now, a deer getting caught and gutted by one of the lake people or the forest spirits was no rare occurrence. Something was wrong about that cry, though. It wasn't like a dying bleat, it somehow sounded furious. I wasn't armed, but I started heading towards it anyways, figuring I'd just be sneaky. Ducking from bush to bush, I made my way over to where the noises had come from. 

I found it on a small clearing—a young buck, hopping around like he'd gone mad. It was a deeply unsettling sight, seeing it bash its head into the same tree trunk over and over again. I swore I could already hear his skull crack. Still, it started standing, throwing back its head as if it was trying to break its own neck. I felt like I was about to vomit. I could sense that I was witnessing something innately wrong, something beyond unholy. I thought feverishly; I had to step in somehow. I didn't want this tormented creature to die in such a way. But try as I might, I could not come up with anything. I would have to make a run for it and tell Casimir. He'd know what to do, and if not, he was still a good enough shot to give the buck a mercy killing from a safe distance. Maybe afterwards, we could examine it.

The buck had something quite different in mind, though. 

Before I had even moved an inch, it had already spotted me behind the tree trunk where I'd been hiding. I could swear I hadn't made a single sound, but no matter how, the damned thing had its sights set on me now. 

I let out a startled shriek as it charged me, only managing to dodge by a hair's width. Now that it was closer, I noticed that there was something wrong with the buck's eyes. Those weren't the full, peaceful brown eyes of a deer. They were jittery, darting from side, and worse yet—they looked distinctly human. I couldn't believe what I was looking at. I kept on ducking and jumping as the freak deer took leap after leap towards me, unable to stifle the cries spilling from my lips. I tried to go back the direction I'd come from, but it was hard making progress with how this beast was chasing me. There was no doubt in my mind that it was attempting to kill me, and it was getting closer to reaching its goal every time it came at me. 

I realized in horror that I was starting to tire out. I wouldn't last at this rate. The deer got close again, close enough for me to feel its hot breath on my face. Just as my mind was starting to wrap around the prospect of meeting my death on a forest walk of all things, something came crashing down on the frenzied deer. Blood spattered, hitting my skirt. At first, I thought it was a falling tree, only to realize that it was a much more animate being. The Leshy, having thrown himself into the buck with the full weight of his own enormous body, slowly drew himself back up, revealing the crushed carcass beneath him. 

*"That would be the second time I've ruined a gown of yours, heiress,"* he growled out, clearly relishing the stunned panic in my wide eyes.

Still frozen in shock and bewilderment, I watched as a strange gray cloud rose from the cadaver, quickly dissipating. "What the hell was that?" I sighed, shoulders dropping as I allowed myself to relax and catch my breath.

*"Bies,"* the Leshy grunted.

I squinted. "Sorry, I didn't quite catch that?"

*"None of your concern. Stick to your task, wench."*

"Hold up! You know something." I instantly regretted my demanding tone when the enormous creature turned back to face me, bringing his snout dangerously close to my face. The Leshy's heated breath rose up into the air in cloudy puffs, and I held his glowing gaze for a moment that terrified me just as much as the encounter with the mad buck had. He didn't say a word. My unease mounting in the silence, I ended up averting my eyes, swallowing audibly as I took a step back. "I'm sorry, Sir."

*"Run along before I forget myself."*

Now, I am a fully-grown woman, but the Lord of the woods could make me piss my pants anytime. I was therefore all too eager to obey, only daring to slow my step when I was sure the distance between us was sufficient. 

There was obviously something the Leshy wasn't telling me. That in itself wasn't much of a surprise, but I could tell that this was different. Whatever had happened to the deer, it had seemed to worry the wood-demon, if indeed he was capable of feeling such an emotion. He sure had been reluctant to speak up about it, and seeing as he normally can't get enough of his own voice, that made things rather strange.

I came across Fergus again on my way back and cadged some coffee from his thermos. He could tell something was up, but had the grace not to ask. 

"Say, how long has it been since you've been working for us? I swear you were already here when my mother was still alive," I remarked, sipping from his cup.

"Oh yeah," he said, smacking his lips. "It's been a while."

"I'm glad you're still around," I told him earnestly.

"Long as you don't think I'm getting too old for the job," Gus laughed and I snorted.

"Bullshit. How old even are you, like, barely forty, right?"

"I'm fifty-seven, you liar," he said affectionately. 

"Not to put any pressure on you, but just so you know, you're going to be missed around here when you leave us."

"I should hope so. But don't worry, I'm not quite done yet. This was my first job, and it's gonna be my last."

"Don't say that, the forest might misunderstand you."

"Oops." He covered his mouth with his palm. "Wouldn't want that."

When I got back home, I tried to set my mind on the task at hand again. Whatever had happened out there probably had nothing to do with all of this. It had only been the usual forest strangeness, I had almost died again, nothing out of the ordinary. I'm living on borrowed time over here anyways. Still, when I laid eyes on my computer, my stomach immediately dropped again. 

I needed to know if Jacek had responded, but I didn't want to check. *Why was this freaking me out so much?* I willed myself to sit down in front of the black screen. 

*Come on, come on, come on…*

I turned it on, and several messages sprung up. My breath caught in my throat, I was almost too nervous to take in the words. Jacek had, in fact, answered me. Four times, in total.

The first message had been deleted. The three that followed lifted a weight off my shoulders, though. 

**"Ignore the one above. I was just really surprised so I said something stupid. So, to what do I owe the honor? You need something, don't you?"**

**"Okay, scratch that. How are you doing?"**

**"I'm sorry, I'm really trying not to sound catty."**

I let go of a deep breath, bracing myself. *"Did you cuss me out at first? You totally did, didn't you?"*

The response popped up immediately. **"Not really. I was just being dumb."**

*"Good news for you, though, I'm doing crappy. I'm just gonna go out on a limb here and assume you're still practicing magic?"*

He didn't send an actual answer, just this one emoji with the sunglasses on.

*"I definitely need your help. I'll pay you, too."*

**"Help as in advice or I gotta be there?"**

*"You'd probably have to be here."*

Radio silence. I bit my lip. *"I totally get it if you can't,"* I added. *"Or if you don't want to."*

**"Okay."**

The text arrived at the same time I sent off mine.

**"I'm coming. I'll hurry; think I can be there in a day. Call me if something goes very wrong in the meantime."** Beneath the text was a phone number.

So I guess now, I'll hold still until Jacek gets here. I'm nervous and I don't know why. I know he's going to help me—he'll expect compensation but that's okay, it'll be well-worth the money. In the meantime, I'm going to try and look up what a Bies is. I'm starting to have a feeling that I shouldn't take this lightly.
