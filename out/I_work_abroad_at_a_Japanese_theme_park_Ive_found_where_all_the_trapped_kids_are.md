Children. Dozens of children. Maybe hundreds.

When I regained consciousness that’s the first thought that entered my mind. *Jesus Christ there’s a lot of them down here.*

And by here, I mean some kind of underground amphitheater with nightmarish rows of seats. Each seat—a black cage of interlaced ribs entrapping a motionless child who’s had their eyes and mouths sealed with tight, shiny cables.

It was probably the most horrific thing I’d ever seen.

I myself was surrounded by the metal ribs as well, except that my tall, twenty-five-year-old torso extended beyond the smaller cage designed for children. I had a few limbs sticking out (thank god).

Judging by the uniformity of all the other cages, my guess is that I was placed via some automated process that had gone unchecked. Which meant that the black cables that should have been sealing my face were instead wrapped around my chin. 

It was tempting to call for help. To yell and see if someone else would respond. But of course that might’ve been suicide. 

I didn’t know where I was. *Underground maybe?*

I only knew that my supervisor, Usami-san, had paralyzed and sent me here.

That bastard.

I was stupid to tell him anything. I should have known he was part of the conspiracy among top brass at Bakery Park—they were all complicit in imprisoning the swathes of Japanese kids here.

 I remember my girlfriend Aiko said that only three children had gone missing at the theme park. How wrong we were. Those were clearly just the three *the public knew about.*

I spent the first few minutes totally awestruck by the horror of it all. It was hard to believe I was staring at an inhumane prison designed exclusively for six to twelve year olds. 

Cruelty incarnate.

At the center of the amphitheater-like floor was a heap of LED panels undulating in a faint white glow, supplying light to the rest of the space .

I watched patiently as one of the panels became bright pink and produced a hologram of a large cartoon pig with a cinnamon roll for a tail.

It was Bu-chan.

The light turned off, but the hologram remained, untethered to roam free. The pig squealed and spoke in aggressive Japanese. 

“Rirīsu kapuseru 478-97742.”   
*Release capsule 478-97742.*

A child cage only a few rows down from me lifted into the air. Several spider-like legs emerged beneath it, and skittered down to Bu-chan.

The pig snorted and inspected the young boy. 

"Yokatta. Mada juku shi teru yo. Tsuite koi."  
*“Good. Still ripe. Follow me.”*

The arachnid cradle waddled behind the hologram pig as he marched down an exit. The sound of the spider feet scraping and stabbing the floor echoed outwards until fading away.

*Good lord. What have I gotten myself into.*

With my free hand, I grabbed and twisted at each of the ribs holding my chest in place. The metal was strong and unrelenting. 

But then I discovered an external hook-shaped appendage, and when I pulled. the whole cage opened. 

I was free. 

*Count your fucking blessings…*

Several pinprick sensations stung across my back as I stood up. On my seat I could see several loosely hanging needles and tubes. *IVs?*

I moved quickly, sliding between the rows of young victims, climbing over their cage casings sometimes.

If I wanted to, I could have pulled the same hook appendage and freed several children as well. The thought weighed me down. A small anchor of guilt.

 *But what good would that do? What if they cried out? What if I had to carry one?*

I had no clue where I was supposed to go. For all I knew, freeing a child might’ve been condemning them to something far, far worse. 

No. I was better off going alone, scoping it out. Rescue would have to be figured out later.

When I descended past the last row and stepped the gray, cave-like floor, I could see exits in at least five different directions. They were all sealed by tight aperture doors. All except for the tunnel that Bu-chan entered.

I took a deep breath.

The LEDs pulsated rhythmically, casting my shadow against the rows of young kids. My silhouette stretched into a long, scrawny shape across the helpless forms, like a spindly tree, incapable of supporting anything.

There was nothing for me here. I snuck down the tunnel.

\*\*\*

It was very hard to see in the pure, unassailable darkness. Clearly the tunnel was designed for beings who could emit their own glow. Not for fleshy human escapees.

I kept my fingers sliding along the right wall, marching forward and making sure I didn't trip over anything. Eventually I did see a mix of glimmering lights at the end of the tunnel. They alternated between blue, yellow, and pink. 

It might have been Bu-chan or more like him, which sent chills down my spine, but I ignored the feeling and edged closer.

Grime, soot, and I don't know what else clung to my fingers and clothes as I crawled along the wall. I was still wearing my ‘Mr. New York’ outfit, which I'm sure was now streaked with god knows what. They might have taken my phone and keys, but at least they left me my costume. I used the chef’s hat to wipe sweat from my eyes.

The lights danced brightly as I neared the tunnel’s exit. It gave the impression of some kind of nightclub or carnival. As I came even closer I could see indeed it came from a shimmering *neon sign.*

*フォトニクスバザール*  
*Photonics Bazaar.*

What the hell.

On my immediate right, I saw a space densely packed with cryopod-like chambers. Inside each chamber was the glowing hologram of a child, looking at me with tired, defeated eyes.

There seemed to be no one else around at this bazaar. I went up and put my hand on the nearest chamber. The little girl on the other side placed her palm beneath mine. She was saying something frantically, I could see shimmering, translucent tears trickle down her shimmering, translucent face.

I wish I knew how to lip read. I had so many questions. *What did they do to you?*

I stepped away and looked at the sign centered between all these glass chambers

.プレミアムフレーバー 千葉エリア 半額  
*Premium Flavors - Chiba Region - Half Price*

I re-read the text several times to make sure I translated correctly. But that’s what the words said.

This was a stall, a storefront, and as I looked deeper into the grand hall I just entered. I realized could see dozens of them. 

Several storefronts each offering a different variant. 

山梨の甘味  
*Flavors of Yamanashi*

本物の東京の味  
*Authentic Tokyo Taste*

神奈川の味 - 50% オフ  
*Kanagawa flavors - 50% Off*

My bottom jaw had fallen somewhere along the floor. My hands clasped my head. 

*What. The. Fuck.*

Through the middle of this bazaar hall was a long, connected row of tables and chairs—like you might find at the center of any food court.  Except the furnishings here were clearly designed for beings much larger than humans. 

I approached the first table and spotted a single chrome bowl left on the edge. Inside I could see a shimmering mixture of pink and cyan…

Pace quickened, I sped down the large empty hall, trying to process what I was seeing. In between the ‘flavor’ stalls  were shops for all kinds of uncanny silver instruments. Spoons, bowls, knives, corkscrews, and other things I didn't want to look at.

And every now and then I’d spot a black column supporting the ceiling. On each column were glowing digital numbers. They said 8:57 like any old alarm clock on earth. In a few moments, they read 8:58.

I slid my way beneath the long cafeteria table, and kept a low profile, and I'm glad that I did, because when the clock hit 9:00, All hell broke loose. 

The ceiling became an LED explosion of sparks and lights, descending hordes of shimmering creatures down into the hall.

But they weren’t ravenous, blood-thirsty monsters like I was expecting. No, If I had to describe them, I’d say they behaved more like *obsessive shoppers* at a mall.

I watched from the floor as a hologram monkey mascot (covered in donut sprinkles) prepared his shimmering pair of tote bags. There was a bipedal dog (with pancakes for ears) who ran over to some glass-chambered children for sale and started smelling each one. There was even a weasel (made of churros) who was giving out coupons for specific stalls.

They were all animals infused with dessert elements … which meant they were likely characters designed at Bakery Park. 

But did that mean they were all harmless virtual mascots at one point? And somehow they now lived underground … enjoying humans as flavors?

“I want that fresh boyling from Kanagawa. The one with the glasses.”

“I’ve heard these creamy types from Shimado are the best. How much?”

“Where are the four star smart ones? I want a new pet. And then I want to eat him when I get bored.”

I could see their illuminated hooves, paws, and bird feet walk back and forth across the bazaar grounds. They were crowding around close to where I was hiding.

Tongue clenched between my teeth, I stayed beneath the tables and skulked forward, putting my heels down before my toes, making as little noise as possible.

With their attention on the merchandise, no one seemed to notice a lone human scuttling away between cafeteria benches. But I knew I wasn’t safe for long. Once they all started eating, I’d be toast.

I crawled from table to table, maintaining momentum until I heard a loud, familiar voice through a loudspeaker.

“Friends! Old comrades and newly arrived! Please gather round for our morning auction!”

I could practically hear the sharp teeth inflect on marshmallow lips. It was Mashumaro.

A stampede of glowing claws, tails, and feet all gathered at one extension of the hall. I could see pushing among the attendees. Everyone wanted a spot.

“Today’s auction item goes by the name Shigeru Tanaka. His family has worked at the Japanese embassy for generations. They also own and operate one of the largest contiguous farms in Hokkaido. To inhabit his body, would be to experience wealth and luxury among the top fifth percentile of the surface world.”

‘Ooh’s’ and ‘aww’s’ arrived in unison.

“Shigeru has no siblings, which guarantees you will inherit much if not all of his family’s exemplary estate and connections. For a vessel of this caliber, the bidding shall begin at three thousand nodes.”

I looked ahead of me, and noticed that the crowds of feet were thinning. Every glimmer-mascot was drawn to the auction. It quickly grew heated.

“I offer Four thousand!”

“Eight!”

“Twelve thousand!”

Twelve thousands nodes from the fellow in the back!” Mashumaro spoke with proud satisfaction.  “Twelve thousand going once. Twelve thousand going twice…”

“Sixteen!”

Seizing the opportunity, I crawled further away, only breathing when I needed to. 

Perhaps if I kept my head down, I would have found another exit to this Bazaar. Perhaps if I kept my head down, I would have found an alcove to hide in, and learned much more about this place in general. 

But unfortunately, I did not keep my head down … not when I heard the screaming.

The hysterical, ear-bursting screaming.

It came from a kid.

An intense empathy cut through my heart. A deep-rooted compassion that went beyond just the care for another human, it was like a *mammalian* instinct. A primal desire to save the young squeaking thing from an all-too-early death.

I couldn’t help but poke my head out from under the tables and look back.

Sure enough, I could see a human boy, still in the flesh, dangling by his feet. It must have been the ‘ripe one’ plucked by Bu-chan not long ago. The living rib-cradle had reformed into a hanging post that the kid could not escape.

“Forty four thousand nodee, going once… going twice …”

Gasps of astonishment bubbled through the crowd. Clearly such a bid had not been offered for some time.

“Sold! To Mamechi for forty four thousand! Well done sir! For those who do not know, Mamechi is one of our oldest progenitors. He’s been at this for a long time. You deserve to retire well, old friend.”

I could see Mashumaro shake hands with a particularly pixelated looking hologram. Mamechi looked like he had lived inside an 8-bit game all his life.

“I will enjoy retiring as an eight year old affluent progeny. I will ensure our island stays safe.”

Unanimous cheers drowned out the small boy’s cries. Mashumaro initiated a long mechanical lancet to descend from the ceiling. It resembled an oversized syringe.

I watched helplessly as the needle entered the boy’s neck, and sucked the life from his eyes— quite literally, because the syringe chamber suddenly filled with a digital lifeform of the boy. His life essence had been removed … and hologram-ized.

“Alright” Mashumaro smiled, “brace yourself.”

An antenna was stuck into the center of Mamechi’s pixelated body, absorbing him inside the metal instantly. Then, the needle still inside the boy’s neck lit up like a flash of lightning, and suddenly the lifeless boy was awake again, complete with bright yellow eyes and a sinister grin.

The possessed child was deposited back into a walking black cradle amidst a final round of applause.

“Thank you all for attending!” Mashumaro hollered. “Let us bid farewell to Mametchi as he enters the elevator!”

My attention was rapt. *Elevator?*

The spidery cradle walked over to an indented circle on the floor. Puffs of dust shot out as the circle lifted by a foot. It was a platform.

Above I could see a correspondingly large circle open up on the ceiling. Little mandala patterns lit up around the perimeter.

*An elevator. Right here. Right now.* 

Maybe it was my overconfident youth (or maybe it was because I had just been exposed to a new definition of hell) but I felt like I had to do it. I had to take a chance. 

My plan for stealth was all wishful thinking anyway, whereas this mad dash had a very real chance of escape.

When the platform lifted three feet, I bolted out from under the table and broke into a sprint. By the time any of the hologram mascots noticed me, I was already within leaping distance.

“What is that?!”

 “A human?”

“What is it doing here?”

My jump could have been better timed, I maybe could have landed on the circle more cleanly, but I had grabbed hold of the edge. I was still on.

Pulling for my life, I hoisted myself up onto the lifting platform. The only thing on board was the black, stationary cradle. Inside it was an eight year kid who leered at me with menacing eyes and a frozen smile.

“James Naka, employee #604373? Is that you?”

I looked to my left and saw the hovering, bewildered face of Mashumaro. He levitated alongside the platform as it raised.

“Did you forget I could float?”

The marshmallow tanuki snapped his fingers and the elevator stopped, but not until we were three stories above the ground. I had nowhere to run.

*Shit.*

“What a surprise to see you here. I was saving your auction for the off-season. No one wants an ancient twenty-five year old. Were you trying to save yourself the same embarrassment?”

I fell to my knees and begged, keeping my hands up high over my head. I didn’t know what else to do. “Please. I won’t tell anyone. About any of this. Just let me go.”

“Won’t tell anyone?! HEH! Heheheheheheheeheehee!” Mashumaro enjoyed wallowing in his own laughter.

“The same way you wouldn’t tell anyone about where you found Kaito?” He pointed at my wrist with the glowing stamp “森”. It seared in pain.

“The same way you agreed to work at the Confection Showroom?” He slapped my floppy chef's hat off my head.  It fell onto the crowds below.

“James. I like you. I really do. And I gave you many, many, *many* chances to play along. But it's too late now my friend.”

The metallic arm holding the syringe descended from the ceiling again. I could hear it whirring behind my head. *No. Please no.*

“You've besmirched yourself James. And this public display has likely voided your auction, if I'm being honest.”

I could hear Mametchi’s spider cradle stand again. Its limbs clawed into my back, holding me in place. I held my hands together as tightly as I could. I closed my eyes.

“Please … just send me home.”

I spent an eternity waiting for an obliterating sting at my neck. Or for Mashumaro to zap me into dust. But nothing happened.

“Send you home huh?” Mashumaro spoke pensively. “You know. That might not be a bad idea.”

When I opened my eyes I could see an antenna poking inside Mashumaro's body. He giggled, as if the metal prong could tickle his white belly.  

“Let’s try it. Let’s send you back to America.”

I could feel a long thin needle delicately enter my neck. “...What?”

Mashumaro giggled some more as the antenna grew bright. “Not alone of course. Heheheh.”

The shock in my neck came with such force, it felt like I’d been beheaded. 

I reached with my arms but quickly lost all feeling. 

Before I knew what was happening, all I could see was white. Colorless white. 

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

I had gotten my wish. I was free. 

My vision was working again, and I could feel the ground beneath my back. I was in the Confection Showroom.

But as I got up to stand, I realized none of the movements were made by me.

My body moved and walked and breathed and swallowed, but I wasn't in control at all. 

Some version of Mashumaro had taken over the executive functions of my brain. I watched pathetically through my own eyes as this photonic monster controlled every muscle I flexed, and every word I said.

Immediately on the surface I met with the big brass at Bakery Park. Mr Satou and Keibiin. They congratulated me on a job well done as a cast member, and agreed I should be given administrative control of installing the Bakery Park franchise somewhere in the US.

“You’ve really proven yourself to us, Naka-san. You should be very proud.”

I left on the ferry the next day, without saying goodbye to Nana-obasan, and without ever reaching out or texting Aiko in any way. 

**Aiko, if you're reading this, please DM me. I never wanted to leave you in the dust.** 

Across several days, I watched Mashumaro delete nearly all contacts from my phone and my social media. In less than a week, he had personally insulted every meaningful contact in Japan and America I knew, burning every friendship, relationship, acquaintanceship I ever had. All my connections were purged, save for my new managers at Bakery Park. 

It was fucking devastating.

I was no longer a happy-go-lucky English teacher traveling the world to discover himself. I was an entrepreneur loaded with seed money to start a theme park in America.

Mashumaro moved me to California, to a swanky apartment building in Los Angeles. To maintain an illusion of human-ness he even reached out to my mom and dad.

Ironically, my parents loved the change. They said I was so ‘driven’ now. They were amazed how I could afford to stay anywhere, and how I was so close with such successful businessmen in Japan.

I wanted to scream at my folks (who by the way, never got along with the old me). I wanted to tell them they were supporting the worst, most sociopathic version of myself. But of course, I had no voice in the matter.

I couldn’t do anything. 

Every now and then, Mashumaro would march my body to a washroom and have it stare at itself. He would smile, and I could see the disturbing shimmer in his eyes. 

“What a good boy, you’ve been,” he’d say. “Kindness is never wasted.”

Sometimes I’d watch him converse with other Newbodies (the term he uses for photonically controlled humans), and they would talk about how their operations were going in Japan. 

He even met with Kaito (yes, the same Kaito that I rescued with Aiko at the start of all this.) Even though Kaito was just a kid, he spoke with an old man voice and was already involved in his family’s shipyard business.

It was disgusting just how far the conspiracy went, and how many normal flesh-and-blood people were supporting the photonic agenda. 

Bakery Park’s Satou-san, Keibiin, and even my supervisor Usami-san were all just normal people, happy to up-end their morals to keep their positions of power.

Throughout Japan. I learned photonics were kidnapping about a dozen kids a day (which wasn’t helping with Japan’s population crisis). And in America, they were now starting to capture a dozen kids a week.

And it was only going to get worse.

Mashumaro had amassed a team of Newbodies to buy some land in Anaheim. The US Bakery Park is slated to be built sometime in the next five years. 

I had to endure every minute of every meeting. Feel the sweat on every greasy handshake. Taste the burn of every fruity, vanilla cognac I would never drink.

I had to watch myself become a soulless, corporate monster intent on ending humanity.

Up until a few months ago, I thought my life was truly over … and then I discovered my only saving grace.

Each night when Mashumaro finally went to bed. My old body would briefly disconnect from him. For a long time, there wasn’t much I could do, because I couldn’t control my old body either. 

But after a lot of effort focusing on my fingers and my toes, I was slowly able to reassert some control.

**Recently I was able to start walking during Mashumaro’s REM sleep. And only even more recently, was I able to start writing on his laptop.**

Mashumaro so far has had no recollection of what I do during his rest. And I’d like to keep it that way.  I’ve purposely limited myself to only an hour or two each night.   
  
I’ve stealthily shot emails to a few select people through an Outlook account I’ve managed to keep hidden. But so far the responses have been fruitless.

I’ve even created a secret whatsapp to try and reconnect with friends who might help me. But they all think I’ve become a selfish money-hungry shill.

**And so, over the last few days, I decided to type up my story —this story— and release it to the world. I figured if I started at the beginning, and explained the whole situation, then someone new might finally help me.**

Its been nothing but dwindling hope and misery, ever since Aiko and I saved Kaito from the Confection Showroom. A disaster of events.

And you have every right to disbelieve me and think I’m crazy. Hell, I know I would.

But, if you’re that person who has read my whole story, and  you’re willing to sneak massive packages into an address in LA without alerting Mashumaro… please DM me now.

**My goal is to get my life** **back.**

**My** **goal is to unveil the grand photonic conspiracy to the world.**

**My goal is to find out what happened to Aiko Agatsuma and save her if it's not too late.**

Please Help. God bless.
