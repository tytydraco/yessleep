hi everyone. I recently found out about this subreddit and after scrolling through some stories and comments, I felt that this could be one of the only communities that could give me some advice. It seems like everyone here knows more than I do.

I’ll start with a short biography: I’m 22 years old, and I was born and raised in a small middle eastern country (I’d rather not specify where for privacy reasons). My family consists of my parents, my three sisters, and my brother. We’re a big family but we always make time for each other.

I slowly drifted away from Islam as I grew older— I met a white guy, and I guess he corrupted me. Lol. My family was never super religious anyway, and I’m pretty sure one of my ‘weird’ uncles is actually just an alcoholic. In fact, everyone seemed pretty excited when I introduced them to Ryan.

Ryan was perfect. He was considerate, kind, and clean. I think he was the funniest guy I ever knew. We moved in together a year ago and broke up thirty-two days ago, and one of the last things we did to salvage our relationship was adopt Bear

Bear is the best dog ever. I know everyone says that about their own dogs, but he truly wins. He’s a big fat Border Collie with the biggest heart and biggest belly. I love him so so much.

Unfortunately, not even Bear could save our troubled relationship. We just didn’t work out, I guess. He stopped putting effort into us, and now it’s just me, alone in an empty house.

I know I’m stalling a bit, but I guess I haven’t started the real story because I’m afraid. I’m confused and afraid.

But the show must go on, so here goes:

A few months ago, Ryan and I took a trip to visit his family in the States. They retired in a small lakeside house with woods surrounding their house, and I was absolutely floored by the beauty of the forest. Every evening, I would take small walks with Ryan’s mother along the shoreline. Sometimes we’d make small talk but mostly I would just gawk at all the sights and take hundreds of pictures on my phone. We saw birds, snakes, flowers of all colors and varieties, and even a couple of squirrels. One evening, when we retired to the porch, I asked her,

“Do you guys have wolves?”

She laughed and said no, only deer and boars. I wondered out loud if I’d be able to ever see one.

“They’re used to human activity nearby, actually,” she said, “so I wouldn’t be surprised if you saw a deer or two. Sometimes they graze at the edge of the lakes”

She was right. The next evening, Ryan’s parents called me to see it: On the riverbank stood a gentle, elegant creature. The falling sun illuminated the deer with pale oranges that looked like paint strokes across its fur. The creature walked gracefully, hesitantly, as if feeling the presence of our glares from so far away, and it tapped it’s hooves against something, leaned down to sniff, and then it left. The moment couldn’t have lasted more than ten seconds, but it felt like an eternity that slipped out of my fingers when Ryan appeared and asked for another beer.

I took the moment to excuse myself to their bathroom. I left the family to their devices (I prefer not to be around alcohol as an old habit) and instead opted to reflect on my happy moment in the privacy of the shitter. As I stepped inside, my joy was replaced artificially with something new. A surge of discomfort flashed through my system like cold heat, and it flew up my spine in a wiggle that made my whole body tense. I washed my hands thrice out of some filthy feeling within me. I think this is when it started.

I couldn’t sleep that night. Ryan and I had another whispered argument about my anxious tossing in bed so I quietly gathered my things and went downstairs to the living room. His parents must’ve already been asleep by then. I think it was close to midnight.

As I shuffled towards the couch, I caught a glimpse of the night through the porch. It looked so peaceful. Ryan’s parents’ house was fine, but not to my liking. The scale dipped to more cluttered than maximalist; I felt overwhelmed in their living room surrounded by paintings, vases, and family portraits that I sadly figured would be one person shorter sooner or later. I decided to do myself a favor and step out for a breather.

The porch light shocked me. I didn’t even know they made lightbulbs that bright, to be honest. Still, I already committed myself to the sad movie-moment, so I just stood against the railing and looked at the stars. Then I heard it.

It was a crack. It sounded like a coconut breaking, mixed with the sound of a person making wet mouth noises, like when someone chews loudly to piss you off. I walked to the end of the railing and peeked my head around the corner of the house, following the wet noises. I saw it there.

I’m almost a hundred percent sure it was the same one we saw that evening, but something was different. I figured deer were quite large, but I never realized how intimidating their size really was. I swear it was twice as tall as me stood on its hind legs. It didn’t seem to stumble at all. In fact, I can’t say it moved much, other than its violent act. It was turned sideways to me, hitting its head against the stone wall rhythmically.

There was blood dripping in weird chunks from its head. It flew like bits of Jell-O as the deer stopped and suddenly craned its neck to look at me. I looked into its bright eyes, reflecting the light of the porch, and saw nothing. The brightness of the lamp made its eyes look hollow, white inside. There was no soul, no personality, nothing behind them that the creature possessed a few hours prior. The darkness soaked it’s fur, pulling him into the black environment surrounding him, but not fully. It’s like it wanted me to see.

Then, it turned back towards the wall and gave its head another swing.

This time, more of its head caved in, and I realized the chunks were being exposed rather than pooling out—A brain being freed from a brittle cage.

Its eye shook a little as the skin and bone above it was damaged, and it comically dropped and dangled, adding another source for wet noise as it hit the wall. It looked as if the eyeball was holding onto its place for dear life. I had never been more afraid in my life. I started to scream.

I need to pause right now to emphasize something- I cannot stress for the life of me that I am not crazy. I have no history of mental health issues nor does anyone in my family. I have lived the most normal life.

When I started screaming it turned to look at me. It wasn’t some kind of sudden turn like the last, the kind where the whole body swerves with the neck in a wild, animalistic frenzy. It was slow, steady, calculated. It was a look that acknowledged me as not just a passerby, but a witness. As I shook and grabbed the blanket around my shoulders tightly, it slowly walked away.

I don’t know how long it took everyone to come down. It felt like a long blur. I remember Ryan’s dad, his mom, then him. I remember being taken by my shoulders, and then something soft under me. I remember voices, mumbles, cold water, and becoming surrounded by more softness and warmth. I don’t remember falling asleep.

The next morning, they told me the wall was clean. There were no signs of any disturbance.

Ryan took me home that same evening.

Over the next few weeks, my sleep became disturbed. If I managed to fall asleep, I was plagued with nightmares of the thing outside the cabin, and when I was awake, I found it hard to fall back asleep again. Days would just feel like an hour-long rest between nights full of torture. I’d wake up screaming, wiping invisible blood from my hands and mumbling about the skull- the skull was broken, cracked, fragmented, stained, cold- like concrete against concrete. Bone against heavy log. Foot against floor, eyelid against eyelid, popping quietly as I blinked. Everything was mutilation. I was haunted at first not by a being, but by my memories of it.

A runny yolk was a slippery eye. Tomato juice became vomit and blood. The texture of somewhat-liquid was in everything I saw. Rough, squishy, dripping water. Dirt. Grime on places it shouldn’t be. On pure white bone. On pure white eyes. I dropped my keys and saw teeth hit the floor. I sneezed and heard my nose crack.

But it wasn’t real. Nothing was real.

Ryan was absolutely bothered by my outbursts. At first, he tried to play the nice-boyfriend. He hugged me closer at night, called me between my classes. It almost fully assured me. But nothing lasts forever, not even love. Soon after, I could tell he was getting sick of me.

That’s how we got Bear.

My loyal protector. My best friend.

The first thing we did was take him to the groomer. It gets really hot here, so I’m sure he was grateful for the lifted load. He looked adorable when we shaved him. I couldn’t love him more. I still have so many pictures of us all from that day because I just couldn’t bring myself to throw them out. Now those memories are little painful reminders in the form of polaroids in my bottom-most bedroom drawer.

Nothing lasts forever, not even love.

After getting Bear, it only opened a new can of worms in the sad fishing trip which was our relationship. Once I started getting better, Ryan assumed I’d return the dog. Can you believe it? He thought of Bear as some kind of temporary remedy- a band aid for what he only assumed was some kind of bizarre display of attention-seeking, selfish behavior from my part.

What he saw as flaws, I only saw as endearing. Bear loved to give sloppy kisses and he drooled in his sleep. He sometimes trailed dirt into our house, and when Ryan grew upset I would only marvel at the cute paw shapes our buddy left behind.

So Ryan went to stay with his weird, gross cousins. Bear stayed.

The apartment felt a lot larger, even with my companion in it. I’ll admit I was a mess, and even the house reflected my state. But I always took care of my best buddy, even alone.

It wasn’t easy, but soon enough I had worse problems to deal with.

A few days after the breakup, I was getting ready to head out for a lecture when I noticed something strange. Bear sat in the doorway of my room, whining softly.

“Papa’s not coming home, Bubbo,” I sighed, tapping the edge of my bed for him to come snuggle me before I left. He hesitated and refused to move, instead pawing at the ground. His behavior was growing frantic, and I could tell he was frustrated at the lack of ability to communicate something to me. It broke my heart to see him so restless, but as I was nearing the end of my semester, my classes were becoming more important, so I had to leave soon.

“Walk?” I mumbled hesitantly. I really didn’t have the time for it, but I knew that the sooner we solved the problem, the better. I was beginning to learn he was a stubborn boy, and I didn’t want him making a mess and embarrassing himself. He only whimpered again in response.

I tried to put the leash on him, but he protested. I wanted to feel relief, but I was only beginning to grow worried.

“What’s wrong, Bear?”

I wanted to check him for any injuries, but he tore himself away from my grasp and started barking. Nothing calmed him, no toys, treats, or love. He wouldn’t let me comfort or check him at all. He insisted on standing in the doorway, thrashing wildly at my touch.

My feelings culminated into something I’m not proud of myself for.

I left.

He’d tire himself out eventually, I thought. I don’t mean to justify my behavior, but I was exhausted, and all my options had run out. This is my first dog, and raising an animal all alone with the pressure of my studies and breakup wasn’t easy.

The guilt wafted in the air around me as I went about my day, but I was relieved when I came home (a little early, even) and I didn’t hear him barking. I was about to put my key in the hole when I heard a soft scratching.

I opened the door to find Bear outside. He was sitting quietly, looking up at me with two black, sad eyes. He opened his mouth, then closed it. He repeated it a few times, then walked away.

He lost his voice. My neighbor sent me a complaint and said that Bear had been barking all day. I apologized profusely to all parties involved, including my poor dog. I didn’t even scold him for making an even bigger mess of the house than when I had left it. 

After that, I didn’t let him out of my sight. I was close to finishing my semester so I opted to spend as much time as I could cooped up with him after I was done. He spent his days sleeping by my side. I wondered if he was sick, but a vet check told me he was absolutely fine.

Ryan. I thought the poor thing probably missed his dad and had grown depressed. He wasn’t coming around much anymore. We decided to go no-contact but keep each other unblocked in case of emergencies. I appreciated it. I only broke the no-contact rule once.

A few nights later Bear and I were snuggled up on the bed. I’d stayed up scrolling through old pictures, and I was getting ready to retire for the night when I felt Bear shuffle beside me.

“Shh...”

I was laying on my side with my legs bent. Bear liked to nestle in the little crevice I made, and we slept like that throughout the night. I wasn’t very concerned about his movements, but then he let out a soft whimper again.

That’s when I felt it. I swear I felt it. I don’t know how, but I knew it was behind me. I knew Bear was looking at it.

I saw the prints first. Stained, reddish black, unlike those left by Bear. They were shaped differently too; sharper, heavier. Each step was marked onto my floor with intention. Dirty. Disgusting. A warm breath in my direction, wafting a filthy stink in my direction.

I suddenly became aware of the sweat on my feet, the grease in my hair. I saw fingerprints on my phone screen, highlighted by my attention. I saw filth because it was in the room with me.

It wasn’t injured this time, but it was so much taller. It’s back was hunched over, brushing against the ceiling on it’s hind legs. In the dark, it’s eyes reflected my phone’s light, which slowly dimmed to leave us both in darkness. I don’t know how well deer can see in the dark but I felt that it was a lot more confident in the pitch black than I was.

It didn’t move. It just breathed. It just stared at me and breathed. I felt a surge of fear move through my body like a white flash. I could feel tears in my eyes.

I should’ve screamed or ran, I should’ve turned the lights on at least, but I couldn’t even feel my phone in my hand anymore. I just sat there, keeping eye contact with the creature like prey on it’s haunches.

It was standing at the corner edge of my bed. It looked so real. It was covered in blood despite being uninjured. I think it was so plentiful it streamed onto the carpet.

Bear’s whimpers brought me back to reality. I sank into my pillow and closed my eyes tightly, whispering whatever prayers I remembered from my childhood. Bear’s fur against my body gave me the warmth and confidence I needed to function without completely losing my mind. I took a soft breath in of his warm scent. You know when a dog is all cozy and warm and it smells like home? That was the anchor keeping me from tearing my hair out. I knew somehow it wouldn’t hurt me, but the smell and the feeling was so unbearable that I wanted to die.

I could faintly hear stomping, but I didn’t know whether it was getting closer or further.

And when I opened my eyes, it was gone. Bear was cuddling me gently.

I heard sounds outside, and in my paranoid state I rushed to only one conclusion. Ryan stopped by. The knocking must’ve been his, and it mixed with my dreams to create some sort of weird sleep-paralysis-nightmare.

I know it sounds stupid. These excuses seem so far-fetched, but you must understand that if I tried telling myself what it really could’ve been, I risked losing my mind there and then. Instead, I made up stupid lies to tell myself just to keep myself sane.

So, I texted him.

‘hey, was that you?’

‘what?’

He was awake, at least.

‘nevermind’

‘you sure?’

‘yea, everything is just weird lately’

‘I get it, actually…’

‘yeah?’

‘do you want me to come over?’

‘yes.’

‘okay’

I almost didn’t want to include this part, but I hate being dishonest. Yes, I texted my ex and let him stay over. I know, sue me. You would’ve done it too.

He didn’t take his time, which surprised me. He was never the spontaneous type. But lo and behold, only thirty minutes later, he was outside my door.

We didn’t converse much- just some awkward small talk under the weight of the tension. I refused to tell him what happened. I couldn’t bear any more arguments about it, and I just wanted to pretend it never happened.

“So, nothing? No hints? You’re scaring me.”

“Bad dream,” I mumbled.

“Ah, okay.”

We both looked like shit. I definitely felt like it. I decided to open up to him about it just to switch the topic. It worked. We actually had a nice night together, just opening up and talking about our time apart on the couch.

Bear seemed hesitant to welcome Ryan back, but thankfully my ex-partner seemed happy to see him. I hoped that maybe it would lift Bear’s spirits a bit. He mentioned that Bear seemed weirdly active and I told him that he’d been living a nocturnal lifestyle lately. He’d stay up all night guarding me, then he’d sleep all day. Ryan seemed concerned but I promised it would be alright. He just shrugged and said he looked creepy. I was offended but I didn’t say much more.

I know this whole section seems unnecessary but I promise I’m mentioning this for a reason. The night ended perfectly. We agreed to have breakfast the next morning, but when I woke up he was gone. I checked my socials and found myself blocked on everything. All he left behind was a raided fridge and dishes in the sink.

I don’t know why he’d do that. I know it sounds like a regular couple problem but I swear that he’d never do something like this. I’m still so worried.

After the initial confusion and shock wore off, I called my sister. I needed to talk to someone.

Our conversation about Ryan didn’t last long though. I could keep it all from him, but I love my sister dearly and she knows me too well. Right away she could tell something was deeply wrong- worse than just a simple breakup. I didn’t even try to hide it. I gave her half-assed protests until she pushed it out of me. I felt so relieved to finally talk about it that I started to cry.

It was a nice conversation. I hadn’t brought up the deer situation to anyone in my family so it was a great load off my shoulders. She told me to see someone.

“I’m not crazy,” I protested.

“—No, I mean,” she said, “Someone… religious”

An imam is an Islamic leader. Think of it as our version of a priest. They lead us in prayer and sometimes act as scholars. They also perform spiritual cleansing on people- curses, djinn possessions.. all that. I’d never been to one before. It took a lot of convincing to get me to accept.

I hated it. I’d much preferred some kind of mental break. Stress-induced psychosis or sleep paralysis. I researched the latter and thought it could be worthwhile to look into it, but my sister urged me to take action against the riskier business first. By the end of the call she’d fueled my brain so much with fear that I promised I’d go that same evening.

And go I did. She sent me a location from a friend of a friend, and I was off immediately. I took a cab to the mosque and met a younger man who led me to a quiet room and gave me some tea. I felt a little calmer with him. He seemed so eloquent, and the walls of the room wrapped me in a gentle comfort I didn’t realize I’d missed.

Our conversation was short. He asked me some questions about my lifestyle, and I answered honestly— things about my mental health, my family background, my past relationships.. He asked me if I might’ve angered someone who could curse me: I said no. He asked me if I went somewhere I shouldn’t have: No, again. He asked me if I lived alone. I remembered Ryan and sadly said yes.

He explained to me that I let something filthy into the house, something that chased purity out. I considered the mess inside, the tears, snot and other proof of depression scattered across every room. I figured this was what he meant; the filth of pain, like invisible blood after an attack signifying vulnerability. 

Then he just prayed over me for a while. I don’t want to really discuss any more details of our meeting in depth. It honestly makes me uncomfortable to think back on it. I think the stress of everything affected me so much that I began feeling sick at some point just thinking about it. There was a claustrophobic feeling that filled my lungs near the end of the session- so intense that I could feel my vision blur. It was this bout of nausea that was so disgustingly overwhelming that my mind was just begging for it to stop. I desperately wanted to claw at my throat. He said this was normal for a lot of people, but it felt like the most unique disgust in the world which culminated in vomit spilling out of me. The only explanation I can think of is that reminding myself of these experiences in such a dramatic way just made me relive them again.

The ride home was just as quiet as the ride to the mosque, but it felt ten times longer despite taking the same amount of time. I just wanted to get back home to Bear.

But before I could settle down, I decided to make things right; spiritual or not, this mess was ruining me. A newfound confidence burst inside me, and I got to work. I worked on my knees, scrubbing out each inch of dirt I could find. I wiped windows, mirrors, shelves, screens, and every single book cover and photograph I kept with me. The final act of this journey was a long bath. It was exactly what I needed.

we spent the entire evening hugging on the couch, Bear and I. There was a content mist in the air that smelled of mint and citrus. Every so often, he’d whimper at a foreign noise or lick my hand. I took my time to assure him- if this was really some kind of supernatural situation, I figured he could’ve still been shaken by the whole ordeal. We watched one of those videos for dogs of someone’s backyard where squirrels and birds would come to eat and play in front of the camera. He seemed to like it, letting me stroke his belly and giving me soft licks as he edged closer.

I wish I could say the same for myself. Watching those animals, those woods- it reminded me of only one thing. One place. One creature. That night.

One new thing I learnt whilst staying with Ryan’s family was that woods were so much eerier at night. At the time, I didn’t let it unnerve me, being so blinded by my childish awe for it all. Now I remember it all so differently; pitch black nothing. Repeating stalks of trees as far as I could see, leading you in circles. The feeling of sinking your foot into moss and dirt, walking through a place that wasn’t made to accept you. It looked so easy to get lost there, even from the comfort of the porch. Now I realize that sometimes the problem isn’t about going into the scary woods (that was easy), but what could simply come out of them.

A ringing sound made me jump. It was my phone on the counter. I hesitated on my way to answer it, just for a moment, when Bear whimpered softly behind me.

“Hi. How did it go?”

My sister’s voice was soft, concerned on the other line.

“Oh, right, sorry. I just came home late, and I was tired and—”

“That’s okay.”

“Right. Thanks for… everything. I appreciate it a lot.”

“It’s okay”

Awkward silence. She breathed.

“I’m going to bed now. I’ll tell you all the details tomorrow when I’m more refreshed and you know… after I’ve absorbed this all a little more—"

“Thanks for inviting me. I’m outside now.”

“What?”

The smell of metal hit me like a bus. Filtered, distilled disease assaulted me in an attack I can only compare to millions of ants crawling up my nose. It didn’t lull me or weaken me— I remember gasping and opening my eyes as my body was forced to experience it. I dropped my phone and clawed at my own nose. I wasn’t myself anymore. I just wanted it to stop.

“I’m outside,” repeated the voice from far away. It sounded like she was chewing on porridge. It was moist. Amid the chaos she sounded calm, as if her voice was taken from a calmer, cheerier time and was being replayed to mock me.

Careful teeth grabbed my leg and urged me to move.

Ten more whacks, sharp as thunder. It was coming from outside. I knew if I looked out the window I’d see it. If I peeked out my door hole, it’d be in perfect line of sight. Either way, I knew it would look worse than I could ever imagine.

I followed where Bear guided me, stumbling into my bedroom silently. The smell, born into that animal again, was oozing itself just enough to clutch me in it’s grasp of fear.

The door shook with each thump, and in return spilled more of the smell. 

Whatever it was, it just kept going. Hours of non-stop thumping from somewhere just outside, taunting me to look. The stench was unbearable. I spent most of the night sobbing into Bear’s fur, holding him tightly, praying for it to stop. It didn’t. Sometimes I heard a familiar voice wailing with each hit as if the sounds were being beaten out of it’s throat. Sometimes the thumping would get louder, as if angrier, until it just devolved into the sounds of squelching. Whatever was hurting itself out there, I don’t even want to imagine how much of it was left by the end. The wet noises ceased into a crunch, like someone biting into a crisp apple— spraying remnants of moist onto their face, their mouth, their hands. Crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, thump, thump, thump.

The unmistakable sound of bones cracking, louder than concrete breaking, began to fade with the rising sun. Then it stopped.

We looked at each other. I stroked his fur and I wondered why? Why me? Why was this happening to me? It didn’t make sense. I’m no narcissist, but I couldn’t see why this evil chose me. I swear I’ve always been kind. I wouldn’t hurt a fly. I may not be the perfect person but I’ve always tried. I took care of Bear. I loved him and I tried to make a happy home for us. That’s all I ever did.

I wish he knew how much I loved him. He showed it back to me by licking my hand. The warm, comforting slobber began to steady me and I remember finally resting my eyes into a half-closed state. I didn’t even realize how dry my eyes had become.

He continued, seeming to understand that it helped. Maybe he sensed my beating heart dissipate into a gentler thumping. He never once throughout the panic seemed to lose himself. Bear performed his duty as though I was having a simple anxiety attack.

Again, he licked, and licked, and licked. My hands were covered in filthy slobber. Disgusting, dripping wetness.

Filth.

He was the reason the cleansing didn’t work.

I looked at Bear and pushed myself away, as though I could’ve hurt him somehow. He looked confusedly at me, and I cried again as he tried to comfort me. Realizing what I had to do, I gave in to one last effort from him- one last time he would, with good intent, shield me in his sin.

I researched and found a good adoption center where I could trust the staff and future family of my dog and made a few (careful) calls to ask questions. I worked on autopilot just to avoid thinking about what I was doing. I can say it now: I wanted to abandon my best friend like a coward. I am a horrible person. I am a horrible friend.

And I did. I drove to the place on the same day. I spoke to the kind lady who worked there, holding back tears as I signed my dog away. I remember begging myself to focus on anything just to distract myself from the feelings bubbling in me; the bright drawings of children with their pets all over the walls, the work uniform of the woman talking to me, and the small piece of lettuce between her teeth as she smiled at me.

I drove home crying. I cried while writing this. I just wanted to reach out and ask for help and support.

I’ve seen others here talk about their experiences. If anyone has gone through something similar, please know you’re not alone. The world makes you feel crazy, but I promise you that you’re not alone.

Please come to me. I tried to reach out to some people but there might be others who have suffered loss reading this. Any advice or just conversation could help. My sister doesn’t understand this. Ryan wouldn’t either. Everything is better now but I feel so much worse.

EDIT: I came back to look at him. He’s so filthy. He’s disgusting. They’re keeping him in a small, unkempt cage and it’s all my fault. When he saw me, he stared. He looked so angry. I don’t know if it’s Bear or not but I can’t stand the thought that my baby could suffer like this. Please help me. Please tell me not to take him home.
