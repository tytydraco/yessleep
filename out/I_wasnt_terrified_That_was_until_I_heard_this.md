I’m writing this in the hopes that someone may help. So I joined the army as of recent, my field is in Radio Operations. I took ten weeks of Basic Combat Training and twelve weeks of Advanced Individual Training with on-the-job instruction. While grueling, I managed to pull through and landed a position along the east coast in Florida. It honestly wasn’t that hard to me. Transmitting and receiving messages, seemed pretty easy to me. But that’s when “it” happened… I’m not really sure how it all happened but it spooked me. It was usual slow day for me. I was fixing the equipment due something being wrong internally. After that my day continued normally. It was then that my systems began to bug out. There was heavy static so I assumed that the repairs messed with the tuning. After I bit of finicking with the radio a voice came through. It was really raspy and they sounded like they were in pain. This is what was said.

“Derrick?… Derrick?… Why won’t you respond?… I need you… Please help me… You are the only one who can fix my condition… I’m begging you… I’m rotting away… You wouldn’t leave me would you?…”

I froze up for a second. Was… was someone calling out for help? Who was Derrick? I reached over to the my computer and attempted to track down the transmission. But the odd thing about this… was that I couldn’t find it. We’re they broadcasting on an unknown frequency? A lot of thoughts began to well up in my head. I’m wasn’t entirely sure at the moment. Perhaps I could ask around to see if anyone could help me out. If someone is really hurt and are wanting help, then something must be done! When the next day came around I had asked around the base if anyone could help me. Most of the people there didn’t believe me but a few did come to my aid. Luckily I had a recording of the audio and played it for them. They did ask me if I had tracked down the source but told them that I had tried but couldn’t. After about thirty minutes, the radio systems ended up being broken due to how hard we were pushing the system. That’s why I’m writing this. If this isn’t some kind of prank and this person is in danger, something needs to be done! As of now, I haven’t heard any messages from this mysterious stranger yet, but I know that they are still out there. If anyone knows anything, please let me know. I’ll make another post as a sort of update if any new messages pop up. If you know any way of tracking down an unknown transmission I would greatly appreciate it and then we can finally get this person the help they need and possibly find out who this “Derrick” is and why they want to reach out to them so much. Any kind of help I can get to track down the source is appreciated.
