"Kayce- wha- what? What the hell are you talking about?" I stuttered out, my heart beating out of my chest. He'd scared me out of my damn mind, those eyes, they scared me more than anything. At my words, he simply shook his head. I crawled out of under the bed, standing up and looking at him. He hadn't moved, still staring underneath the place he slept. "Kayce, are you fucking pranking me right now?" My voice came out harsher than I'd intended, almost a hiss.

"No. Finny, Fin, please!" He finally moved, faster than I think he ever had. He grabbed my arm and sat up, covering my mouth. "Finley Cassidy, you need to go." He never used my first name, much less my last.

"Kayce-" He pointed to the window as I spoke.

"Go."

"I'm not going until-" He cut me off once again.

"Go!" He took a breath in order to quiet himself. "Go. Go before I call the police on you for being in my home without my permission." My jaw dropped. For a moment, I stood there like an idiot as I searched for words, before I shut my mouth and nodded.

I spent the night in my car, drinking one of the beers I'd stolen from my dad. I always kept a few in my car. I don't remember how long I was up before I passed out from my intoxication, but it had to have been a few hours.

When morning rolled around, I managed to drive back home despite my pounding headache and persistent nausea- which I couldn't tell if it was because of Kayce's behavior or my hangover. Luckily, I had managed to get to the bathroom before I vomited. 

Once I was done, I wiped the bile from my lips and locked myself in my room, where I stared up at the ceiling in dread of the Monday I knew was approaching. I wasn't sure I'd be able to handle going to school, seeing Kayce, seeing that look again.

Unfortunately, I'd been forced to go by my mom and my dad the next day. I pulled up to the small, very broke, high school and shotgunned a beer- or four- before entering the nearly empty hallway. I walked to my locker, resting my forehead on the metal as the effects of intoxication hit. I wasn't one to get drunk at school, I wasn't even one to drink more than one beer.

"Fin?" A familiar voice had jolted me out of my thoughts, I didn't turn around as I was so dizzy and sluggish I was afraid I'd fall if I tried.

"Kayce."

"I really, really need to talk to you." He grabbed my hand and forced me to turn around. The look in his eyes, it was still there but to a lesser degree. I pulled my hand back sloppily and nodded.

"Yeah, you fuckin' think? You think you need to talk't'me after that shit you pulled last night." I knew he could tell I was drunk, but he didn't bring it up- which was good, I didn't feel much like talking about it anyways.

"Can we skip?"

"Yeah. Yeah, we can skip."

We were silent as we walked to his car, I had to lean against him most of the walk. He got into the drivers seat and I collapsed into the passengers. I looked over at him, and he gently pulled the seatbelt over my body. I wasn't exactly a big guy and I didn't have a high alcohol tolerance, so the four beers had wrecked me.

"Please. Tell me what tha'was about."

"I- my family. My family-" His breath hitched and he drummed his fingers against the steering wheel. 

"Spit it out." I said, sharper than I would've liked. I wasn't being pissy because I mad at him, I bring pissy because I was terrified. 

"They're fucking generational murders, Finny."

At his words, I suddenly felt like I was stone cold sober.

"What?"

"You heard me."

"You're shitting me. You're shittin’ me or I'm finally fucking losing it."

"Please. I don't know how to prove this, but they told me everyone is in on it. The ranch, the police."

"Wait a damn minute. What does the ranch have to do with this?" I asked, suddenly feeling extremely nauseous as the strange things I'd noticed when I'd attempted to work there started to make sense.

"They sell the bodies. The sell the bodies of people they've killed and trafficked to the ranch. It's a human meat market." He took a shaky breath. "The cows started dying because the land was going downhill. They've been doing business together for decades."

"No." I countered simply, as though denying it would make it go away. I wanted to curl up and die. I wanted to use logic to deny it, but I couldn't. Everything had fallen into place, the strange and unexplained wealth of the Osborn family, the lack of cows at the ranch, the missing people. I heard him sob, these small and gut wrenching sobs that made my heart break.

"And I- I can't even do anything!" His head fell against the steering wheel, hands gripping it so tightly I thought he was going to break it.

"Yeah, yeah you can. Report it to the police." I replied drunkenly, dazed, my mind elsewhere.

"FINNY. I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT MYSELF." The sobs grew louder. I nearly flinched at his words, Kayce never screamed. He never screamed at me.

"What do we do?"

"I don't want to talk to you about this when you're drunk." The words were said with so much venom, that I suddenly wanted to die even more.


Once I was decently sober, curled up in the seat with a water bottle as cars passed our parked position on the highway, Kayce grabbed my hand and gave it a reassuring squeeze.

"I'm sorry I yelled."

"I'm sorry I'm an idiot."

"I feel so helpless." He whispered, staring up at the sky. "If the police don't care, what can we do?"

"What about recording them talking about it?"

"They said they wouldn't bring it up again unless I proved that I'm loyal by-" He sighed, "by killing someone, Finny."

"Okay, that's obviously off the table." I didn't even want to imagine Kayce killing someone. "What if I try and get hired so I can check out the ranch, I mean, my mom works there. It wouldn't be hard for me to get in."

"Oh, man," He gave a laugh but it seemed forced, "that's not a bad idea. You finally said something smart."


The few days following my decision to sneak into the farm and explore passed in a blur. That week was when I discovered heroin from a few of the druggie kids in my school. I stole some money and bought enough to last me a week on a low dose. I was so high, anxious, and sick that I lost all memory of those days.


Finally, the day arrived where I had to pull up to the ranch in my car. I parked and stepped out, wearing long sleeves to cover the little needle marks that were now engraved in my skin. The ranch was foreboding, it always had been and now I knew why. I was under the ruse that I wanted a second chance at a job here, and since I'd already been shown the reigns the last time I was there, the owner- Mr. Pendleton- left me alone quickly.

I'd parked my car down the road when I arrived, knowing from all the times I snuck into Kayce's mansion that if he saw my car still parked near the farm he would likely be suspicious. Once it was nearing closing time I glued a thin sheet of metal to the lock on the door in order to prevent it from locking properly. After I left for the day, I hid in my car and drummed my fingers along the steering wheel in an anxious manner. Upon seeing Mr. Pendleton leave in his fancy pickup truck, I got up and ran over through the dry grass and onto the pathway that led to the front, opening the door as quickly as possible and shutting it behind me.

My stomach churned as the door shut and I was left in complete and utter darkness, there was so little light that not even the metal had a glint to it. I turned on my phone on, using its flashlight as I looked around. For a while, I searched the eerie environment, but I didn't find anything that was worth noting.

After around ten minutes, I stumbled upon a strange door, I tried to open it, and unsurprisingly, it was locked. Noticing it didn't quite reach the floor, I dropped to my hands and knees and tried to peer under the small crack between the bottom of it and the floor, shining my light underneath as I lowered myself onto my stomach.

I swore I could see someone's finger and my heart dropped to my stomach. A scream escaped my lips as I dropped my phone, accidentally turning off the flash light and leaving myself in darkness once again. Shakily, I picked my phone back up and looked under the door. The gap was small, barely wide enough to look through. I didn't see the finger, which had been a trick of the mind, but what I could see was a thin red sheen on the metal floor. Fresh blood.

At that exact moment, my phone started to ring.

“Finny? Fin? Are you good?”

“Y-yeah.” I had almost forgotten that I’d told Kayce to call me if I hadn’t sent him a message in thirty minutes. I sat on my heels and sighed, rubbing the bridge of my nose. “I found… something. Issue is, it doesn’t prove anything.” He didn’t respond, so I kept talking. “The doors locked.“

“Okay, elaborate a bit faster so you can get out.” He replied quickly, his breathing shaky from anxiety. 

“There’s this door, and there’s a small crack from the bottom to the floor-“ My breath hitched and I took a pause to catch it, “and I could see blood.”

“Oh, oh man. Damn it.” He hissed from the other side of the phone. “Okay, uh, what if we get a copy of the keys?” 

“I don’t- fuck. Fuck!” I covered my eyes with my palms and dropped my phone. “I don’t know if I can, but I’ll try. Shit. If he catches me…” 

“Hey, Finny. You’re okay. We can talk about this later. We have something to go off now, and that’s good.” His voice soothed my frayed nerves faster than I thought was possible. I didn’t respond for a moment, sitting and panting as I covered my eyes and regained control over my breath. “You’re okay, Finny.”

“Yeah. Physically.”

“That’s good, I was worried you got shot or something.” He laughed shakily before sighing. 

“I gotta go, Kayce.”

“Alright, man. We’ll talk tomorrow, get some rest.” And with that he hung up. I sat and stared off into space for another ten minutes, I could barely bring myself to move. The thought I’d been eating the flesh of people, the thought everyone in town had been, made me want to run away and never, ever return. The fact that if I couldn’t prove it, people may never know, that was even worse. 

Oddly, I had felt high but without the euphoria and the good feelings. My movements were slow and I was sure that if I attempted to speak, I just wouldn’t be able to. 

I remember the second I arrived home I sat on my bed and fiddled with an empty needle, I noted begrudgingly that I needed to buy more as I hid it in my bedside drawer and curled up. I don’t remember how late I was up that night, I just know that I cried for most of it. 

Morning rolled around painfully quickly, I arrived early to school- something I never did- and waited for Kayce next to his locker. The locker was beat up, the student who’d used it before him had punched it so hard during a fight that it had left an indentation. 

“Fin.” He practically bolted over to me, grabbing my hand and squeezing that in the reassuring way he always did back then. “God, man. We need to get those copies.” He lowered his volume so only I could hear. 

“I know. I’ll try and find out where the fuck he keeps them tonight.” I had another shift tonight, an unintended consequence of being undercover was that I actually had to work. 

“Okay.” Kayce’s demeanor grew noticeably tenser and he let out a soft soft. “Uh. Fin?”

“Yeah?”

“I was doing some research and I found papers in my dads drawer.” He said, grabbing my arm and leading me to the bathroom, where he shoved me into the handicap stall and locked the door behind him. “Look at these.” He dug through his backpack for a second before he pulled out a stapled together pile.

I grabbed them from his hands, starting to flip through them. I remember there were at least twenty, the ones on the top were calculations, and the rest were build plans. 

“Kayce, what the fuck are these?” I asked, handing them back to him so he could explain.

“My,” He paused, likely searching for a weird other than parents before simply giving up, “they told me they buy from traffickers then resell for higher amounts. I think these are estimates of what they pay and what to sell for.” The adrenaline of finding the papers seemed to wear off and I watched as he started to fight back his tears. 

I didn’t say anything as I watched him cry, instead gently patting him on the back. I’d never been good at comforting people, and Kayce knew that better than anyone. 





That day at work, once Mr. Pendleton had left for what I had assumed was a bathroom break, I’d entered his office and managed to take pictures of each of the keys. I did some research that night and found out that 3D printing a key was indeed possible, I knew that Kayce had one so we’d used it in order to print out everyone of the keys. Unfortunately, I made the worst impulsive decision I ever could have that night. I decided to break in alone with my phone at severely low battery, drugged out of my mind on the supply of cocaine and heroin I’d recently purchased. I still regret that decision 

Once I reached the locked door, I tried every single key- my hands shaky and my skin clammy as I did so. Finally, one of the keys clicked and I gently turned it in the lock. I closed my eyes as I stepped in, hyperventilating as I opened them. A silent scream released from my throat and I accidentally let go of the door in my frenzied state. The door was heavy, and it shut faster than I could process. For a second I couldn’t even breath, the flashlight pointed directly forward. I stepped back, going to unlock the door when I realized. 

There was no inside lock. 

I slowly turned on my heel, and I screamed once against as I fell against the door. My mind was clouded, everything was spinning around me, the bodies that hung bound from the ceiling seemed to warp and move in my intoxicated state, the distorted dripping noises reminded me of the sound of rain running down our gutter. I grabbed my phone and unlocked it with the same shaking hands, clicking the call button on Kayce’s profile. He didn’t pick up. It was too late, twelve at night. 

I’d thought I could do it, that I could handle the situation, blinded by the effects of the drugs. 

I tried to call again. For the second time, he didn’t pick up. Then the third, the forth, until I’d called twelve times. I hadn’t even noticed the battery on my phone before the logo flashed on the screen and it started to power off. 

“NO! FUCK. NO, NO, NO! PLEASE! SHIT!”

And then, I was left in complete and total darkness.



This has been so hard to tell, it's been so difficult, being forced to confront my stupid decisions and the things I’ve been running from for almost five years. I'm honestly considering giving up, but I know I can't. I just want everyone to know about what happened, what's still happening. I've decided, no matter how painful it is, I don't want to die with my story untold.

Thank you, and goodbye for now.
