So, I (18F) was fast asleep, when something strange happened. I’m not really sure if I woke up just before whatever happened or if I was still in that dreamy state, but either way, I heard it. It was a loud and clear voice and had called my name. It was like someone was right there, right next to me. I even replied with a sleepy “hmm?” because, I usually answer like that whenever I hear someone speak to me while I’m half asleep but this time, something felt wrong. That little reply must've jolted me awake completely, ‘cause I suddenly felt this weird tension in the air. 

I had read about these things called "mimics" before, and honestly, it freaked me out a bit. Apparently a mimic is this “entity” ?? that will call out to you, mimicking someone with their exact tone. You’re not supposed to reply to them which is why, In my sleepy, delirious state, started freaking out. I didn’t really want to believe that something like could be real so I thought I might be experiencing sleep paralysis instead, which is always a terrifying thought. I tried to move my leg, and thankfully, I could! That was a relief because I was half-expecting to be stuck there, unable to move. My heart was racing, and I could feel the fight, flight, or freeze response kicking in hard. Instead of doing anything brave, I went for the classic move and dove under my covers, like that would protect me from whatever was happening. Honestly, I was probably going to be the first to go in a horror movie if that ever happened! 

I stayed under the covers for what felt like forever, just trying to convince myself that everything was fine. After a few minutes, I remembered my phone was somewhere under the covers and began searching for it. I was able to to grab my phone and turn on the flash. The sudden burst of light felt like a tiny shield against the darkness. I quickly threw the covers off and flicked on my bedside lamp, flooding the room with light. It was such a relief to see everything clearly again, but I still felt a little on edge. 

Now, sitting in the light, I keep looking at the clock, and it’s 3:46 AM. I decided to wait until it hit 4 AM before even thinking about going back to sleep. I mean, who wouldn’t be a bit skeptical after an experience like that? I kept thinking about how I had to work early in the morning, and I didn’t want to be too exhausted. It’s funny how our minds can play tricks on us, especially in those late-night hours when everything feels a bit off. 

This wasn’t the first time something weird or scary happened to me, either. I had one other moment that still haunts me a bit. To this day, I can’t tell if what I thought I saw was real or if I was just super sleep-deprived, but whatever it was scared the hell out of me. That moment stayed with me, and now this new experience was adding to my collection of eerie nighttime encounters.

As I sat there in the light, I reminded myself that everything was probably just my imagination running wild. Still, it’s hard not to feel a little uneasy after something like that. I took a few deep breaths, trying to calm my racing heart. Eventually, I knew I’d have to go back to sleep, but for now, I was just going to hang out in the safety of the light, waiting for the clock to tick closer to 4 AM. 

I’m not sure if I’ll be able to sleep with my lights off tonight m, or get any sleep at all. But i’m going to try to as I’m still tired lol
