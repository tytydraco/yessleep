HI there, I would like an expert on birds here because I still can't get over what the hell I just saw.

So some background first, I live in one of those towns that have a beach next to them, not saying what town because that isn't Important.

I'm around teen years, and a bit rebellious but not like causing trouble or breaking rules with my parents or anybody.

There is one rule that is set that is to never go outside at dark, which, even though I can understand their parent worries, isn't really needed because we live in a relatively safe neighborhood, but I suppose you can never be sure yea?

And I have broken this rule many times just to take a walk on the beach because, well, I just enjoy the moonlight and the waves under the night sky, keeps me calm basically, and also the fact that I just like being alone.

I've done this nightly, and haven't been caught because, who really cares?

Again, I live in a safe neighborhood so, no need to be worried about being kidnapped or anything.

...Course with that context background out of the way, my opinion on that has changed dramatically.

Yesterday night, I was walking alongside the beach as usual, making sure that I don't walk TOO far as always.

I think I went out longer than usual, but that uneasy feeling push me to go back.

As I was near the stairway that leads up from the beach to my town though, I noticed that some seagulls were on the beach, on the wet sand, cawing and such.

Sure they flew around but, not high up and not away from the water.

As anybody would be, I was confused as hell, because I'm pretty sure that birds like seagulls don't really stay up so late, and only a bird like an owl or something would wake at night.

And I stopped and stared at the group of birds, wondering why they were even there in the first place.

Then, I heard something walking on the sand behind me.

It was only like, on the side, closer to my right ear but, you get what I mean.

That made me feel anxious because usually nobody besides myself walk on the beach at night, and no matter how much I thought about just heading to the stairway, something compelled me, *forced* me to turn around to see who the heck could be up so late than me.

There was instant fear when I finished turning around.

Not because there was some creep or someone similar that was there.

It was because what I saw wasn't ***human.***

This thing was a bird creature, a body type like a human, but slightly slouched and had no feather or eyes, the skin looking saggy and like a naked bird or something.

It had claws, crab claws, but the arm was not the arms of a crab, just where the possible hands would be.

And the claws were pretty thick and black.

There was also talons and a beak that were thick and black too.

And they also looked like they were made out of crab claws.

Hell even the transparent skin thing that lets crabs move their claws were present around those black parts, at least with the beak.

It was walking slowly on the beach, hearing its steps from the sand as it slowly approaches the group of seagulls.

I don't know if it was a blind creature because of having no visible eyes but, I didn't really wanna find out.

Once the thing was with the group, the birds didn't even react, it was like as if it wasn't even present.

I'm pretty sure that they would've flown away thinking that it was some large bird predator about to eat them, and yet they didn't do anything to fly away and escape.

And that guess about being a carnivore to the birds was probably right.

Because I saw the creature stop once it was in the middle of the flock, looked down at one of the birds, leaned over and picked it up, again with no reaction.

The bird fit so perfectly in like, like it was a nest or something.

It stared at the seagull in its grip, then out of nowhere just, sliced the thing in half in its claw before opening its daggers back up.

I could see the poor bird's guts spilling out between that deathtrap waiting to happen as the life of the thing was snuffed out immediately like a light.

Then it feasted on the gore in its grip like it was a bowl of worms.

I was almost ready to throw up then and there, but I just stared, this time in shock, and the other avians STILL didn't do anything.

They just, let it happen.

The creature continued feasting until it stopped and looked at me.

I could feel my heart beating fast and hard and hear my brain telling me to get the out of there.

That advice was taken when it dropped the dead bird and started running at me.

My legs hauled mt ass as fast as they could to the stairway and to my town and to my house, quickly shutting the door and going into my room, locking the door tight and covering my windows by pulling down the blinds and drawing in the curtains.

I just stayed in bed the rest of the night and couldn't sleep, as I was still thinking about what would've happened if it caught me.

Would it have gutted me alive?

Would it have bitten my neck, or choked me, or slice my head clean off like a big pair of scissors?

I didn't want to go out, and didn't want to test fate.

I don't even know if it actually followed me home and I still don't wanna find out.

And now I'm tired, scared, and never wanting to go out to the beach at night ever again.

So, to repeat my question.

Is it normal for birds to be on a beach at night?
