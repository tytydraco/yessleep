I just started using [Stable Diffusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/) three days ago and it’s driving me crazy with the weird, mangled fingers! No matter what prompts I try, the fingers turn out mangled and ugly. I’ve tried a dozen different models and sampling methods, but nothing has worked. Half the pictures I’ve generated look fine, but the other half are subtly, infuriatingly wrong. I’m sure you know what I mean. I can’t be the only one with this problem, since there are a dozen other threads in this sub right now just about generating perfect fingers.

It took me a while to figure out a solution, but I’ve figured out how to get perfect fingers every time. If you’ve had this problem yourself you’ve probably realized that “perfect fingers” as a prompt just doesn’t work. I guess that makes sense. Who would label an image with “perfect fingers”? Maybe you’re like me, and you’ve tried everything. Well, *almost* everything. Some people might say we’re obsessive, but an otherwise perfect image can be ruined by mangled fingers, and it’s so frustrating. All we want are perfect fingers. Is that too much to ask?

To be honest, it had gotten pretty bad for me until I found a fix. After fighting with SD for a couple of days I had even started to see mangled fingers in real life. Whenever I look at someone, my eyes go straight to their fingers. And I swear, sometimes they look mangled... at least out of the corner of my eye. Then when I look straight at them, the fingers are fine of course, but still it's pretty weird. Has anyone else experienced this? It makes me a bit anxious.

Anyway, I was just trying to explain all this to my wife when I had a brilliant idea! My wife doesn't even know what Stable Diffusion is, and she really didn't seem to get what I was talking about until I held up her own hand right in front of her face. The fingers were super mangled, but it was like she couldn’t even see it. One of her hands had eight fingers and the other one looked like a disfigured claw. I don’t know how I had never noticed her weird hands before. She must have kept them hidden somehow, but it’s fine, since I’ve figured out how to solve it.

If you’ve read this far, here’s the fix for “perfect fingers”: instead of messing around with prompts and models, just grab a knife and cut those mangled fingers right off. At first my wife just laughed and didn’t believe it could be so simple, but now she understands. And now her hands are perfect. Feet too.

So there you go, the “one simple trick” for perfect fingers that Stable Diffusion doesn’t want you to know! I’m sure I’m not the only one who has had this problem, so I wanted to share my solution ASAP. Now it’s time to go upstairs and check the kids to make sure they're perfect too.
