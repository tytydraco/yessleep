*We thought it was just a camping trip,a weekend escape to the woods. We didn’t believe the stories, the warnings about what’s out there, watching. We laughed when we found the tracks. We thought it was just a joke. But by the time the sun rose, only two of us were left, running for our lives, leaving the others behind in the darkness. If you ever go into the woods, and the forest goes silent, run. Don’t look back. Because that’s when it comes for you.*

The forest was beautiful at first. The kind of serene, untouched beauty you only see in photos, the Pacific Northwest in early autumn, golden sunlight streaming through the canopy, a faint mist clinging to the ground. Everything smelled like pine needles and damp earth.

It was supposed to be the perfect getaway: me, my boyfriend Jake, and our best friends, Carly and Trevor. Two couples, two tents, and a weekend of hiking, campfires, and s’mores. Jake had even joked about proposing on the trip.

We were hiking up this old trail when Carly spotted the footprints.

“Hey, come check this out!” she called out, crouched low in the dirt.

I thought she’d found something cool maybe a deer print, or even bear tracks. But when I got closer, the air felt colder somehow. Like the forest had inhaled and was holding its breath.

The tracks were enormous. At least twice the size of Trevor’s boot, and spaced far apart like whatever made them had a huge stride. The edges were deep, pressed into the dirt as though something impossibly heavy had passed through. They were eerily human-shaped five toes, a heel but grotesquely large.

“What the hell is that?” Carly asked, grinning nervously. “A hoax or what?”

Jake snorted. “Bigfoot, obviously.”

“Or a bear,” Trevor offered, though his voice wasn’t convincing. He bent down, running his fingers over the edge of the print. “Except… bears don’t leave tracks like this.”

“Don’t be dramatic,” Carly teased, but her voice cracked slightly at the edges. She looked up at me and laughed nervously. “I mean, it’s not like it’s *real*, right?”

None of us answered.

Jake made a joke about TikTok and staged a mock “Bigfoot sighting” video. It was stupid, but it made us laugh, and we moved on, leaving the tracks behind.

That night, the forest was quieter than it should’ve been.

At first, we didn’t notice. We were too busy setting up camp, getting the fire started, and arguing over who got the last marshmallow. But as the sun dipped below the horizon, it hit me there weren’t any crickets. No frogs, no birds. Just the crackle of our fire and the occasional whisper of wind in the trees.

“Why’s it so quiet?” I asked, hugging my knees to my chest.

Trevor shrugged. “Maybe we’re too loud. Scared the wildlife off.”

“Yeah,” Jake agreed, poking at the fire with a stick. “Or Bigfoot’s out there, stalking us.” He grinned and let out a low, exaggerated growl.

“Stop it,” Carly snapped, glaring at him. “It’s not funny.”

“Relax,” he said. “You don’t actually believe in that crap, do you?”

But Carly didn’t answer. She just stared out into the dark trees, her face pale and drawn. And for the first time all day, I wondered if maybe she did.

We heard it around midnight.

It started as a low, distant howl, echoing through the trees. Not like a wolf or a coyote, those sound natural, wild but familiar. This was different. It was low and guttural, like something huge and primal calling out from the depths of the earth.

“Probably just an elk,” Trevor muttered, but his voice was tight.

The howl came again, closer this time. Then it stopped. The silence that followed was suffocating, like the forest was listening. Waiting.

“Okay,” Carly whispered, her voice shaking. “This isn’t funny anymore. I want to go home.”

Jake sighed. “Carly, come on. It’s just an animal. It’s not...”

A branch snapped.

Loud. Close.

We all froze, the blood draining from our faces. Jake pointed his flashlight toward the trees, sweeping the beam across the undergrowth. The shadows seemed to shift, melting into shapes that vanished as soon as the light hit them.

“There’s nothing there,” he said, but even he didn’t sound sure.

Another crack. This time, from the opposite direction.

“What the hell?” Trevor muttered, standing up.

“Don’t,” Carly hissed, grabbing his arm. “Don’t go out there.”

But he was already walking toward the sound, holding his flashlight like a weapon. Jake followed him, muttering something about idiots and horror movies.

The rest of us stayed by the fire, clutching each other like lifelines. The darkness seemed to press in closer, the shadows lengthening as the fire burned lower. Every second felt like an hour.

Then we heard Trevor scream.

Jake came running back first, his face pale and twisted with terror. He didn’t say a word, just grabbed my arm and pulled me to my feet.

“Run,” he gasped.

“What? What happened?” I stammered, but he just shook his head, his eyes darting wildly.

Trevor staggered out of the trees a moment later. His shirt was torn, and there was blood on his hands. Carly ran to him, but he shoved her away.

“We have to go!” he shouted, his voice cracking. “It’s ...it’s not an animal!”

“What’s not an animal?” I demanded, panic rising in my chest.

And then I saw it.

It stepped out of the trees, its massive frame illuminated by the dying firelight. It was huge, easily eight feet tall, its shoulders impossibly broad. Its skin was covered in matted fur, but its face… its face was almost human. The eyes were deep-set and gleaming, the nose flat, and the mouth… too wide, filled with yellowed teeth.

It let out a low, rumbling growl that shook the ground beneath my feet.

“RUN!” Jake screamed, and I didn’t need to be told twice.

The next few minutes were a blur of crashing branches, panting breaths, and the relentless thud of heavy footsteps behind us.

We ran blindly, Jake and I in one direction, Carly and Trevor in another. I wanted to stop, to scream for them, but Jake wouldn’t let me. He dragged me along, his grip bruising my wrist.

The growl came again, closer now, followed by a sound that made my blood turn to ice ,a wet, crunching noise, like bones snapping. And then, Carly’s scream. High-pitched, raw, and abruptly cut off.

“NO!” I sobbed, trying to turn back, but Jake held me tight.

“We can’t help them!” he shouted, his voice breaking. “We have to keep going!”

We stumbled out of the trees just as the first light of dawn broke through the mist. My legs gave out, and I collapsed onto the cold, damp ground, gasping for air. Jake fell beside me, his face pale and streaked with tears.

We didn’t speak. There was nothing to say. We both knew what we’d left behind.

When the search party found us later that day, they didn’t believe our story. They searched the woods, but they never found Trevor or Carly or any trace of what had taken them.

But I know what I saw. I still hear it sometimes, late at night. That low growl, echoing in the back of my mind.

And when I close my eyes, I see those gleaming eyes staring back at me, and I know it’s still out there, waiting for its next [prey.](https://youtu.be/DN6kgXJ5E7g)
