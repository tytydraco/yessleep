8 years ago, my mom left my brother and I home alone for the first time. We were 14, so she didn’t trust us fully, so before leaving, she made sure to warn us. If someone gives you a list of rules, no matter how strange they sound, follow them. 

“Gage, Ian, I’m going on a business trip. I’ll be home in a couple of days. Please behave and be careful.”, she said.

She then handed us a black piece of paper with silver writing on it, with the words; “Rules to Survive the Night” written on it.

“No matter what, follow the rules boys. If you don’t, bad things will happen. I don’t mean to scare you, but I want you guys to be safe during my trip. I don’t want anything to happen to you. You’re 14, so I will trust you with these responsibilities. Call me if anything happens, and if it’s an emergency, call your Uncle Dave. I love you boys and remember, do not, forget, a single, rule.”, she said. She kissed us on the head and got into her car. We watched as she pulled out of the driveway.

Gage and I were so excited to be home alone. I was so excited that I totally forgot about the rules, and ran to my room to play on my PS5. But my brother, being a goody-two-shoes, ran after me. 

“Ian, we need to read the rules!”

I just wanted to play The Last Of Us so I said, “Forget em. They can’t be that important. Mom probably wrote some stuff to scare us into behaving. I bet you five bucks that she wrote ‘Don’t forget to leave the porch light on at night’ or some crap.”

“Actually, that’s rule number 8.”, he said.

“Would ya look at that? Mind blown!” I said sarcastically, imitating an explosion.

“But there’s something strange written under it in small letters.”, he said. 

“Let me see that.”, I said, snatching it out of my brother’s hands, ignoring the, “Hey!”, that came  from his mouth.

I read aloud, “Rule number 8: Don’t turn off the porch lights at any cost. Starting at 6:00 pm sharp, turn on the porch lights. If you don’t, they will be able to see you. If they see you, hide in the basement. Make an escape by distracting them with the flashlights hidden in there. When they’re distracted, run outside and barricade the door with the wooden crates. Grab the green and black motorcycles in the garage, never the red one, as it attracts them. Carry no more than a steak knife and white ash.”

“Who are ‘they’?” Asked Gage.

“How would I know? I told you mom was trying to scare us!” I said. Not gonna lie, it was working.

“We should read the rest of the rules, just in case.”, I said.

Rule #1: Set an extra plate when you have dinner. If you don’t, bad things will happen at random.

Rule #2: If dad is in the living room reading the newspaper, do not disturb or talk to him. Remember, dad died two years ago.

Rule #3: A black book will appear in the coffee table. Do not open it unless you break rule 1 or 2. If you do open it, don’t look at the words.

Rule #4: Do not go outside after 6:00 pm. It’s easier for them to find you, since there isn’t any light.

Rule #5: Do not look out the window after sunset. Make sure all of the windows are securely locked, and the curtains are closed. Stay out of sight from 6:00 pm through 4:00 am. If you are seen, grab a box of food, some water, and your phone and charger. Head down to the basement. You will only have 3 minutes to do this before they come, so be quick. Barricade the door and play classical music to keep them out. I know it sounds weird but trust me. Call your uncle and explain the situation. He will know what to do.

Rule #6: If I ring the doorbell, do not open the door. Don’t look at it. It’s not me. Remember, I’m on a business trip. I will have called you before I got home. And remember, I have keys.

Rule #7: Sleep in the west wing until I’m back. Bring whatever you want into the west wing, but never bring anything red, and always have a light source. Do not go out to the bathroom during the hours of 3:00 am to 4:00 am. If you must, always have a flashlight.

Rule #8: Don’t turn off the porch lights at any cost. Starting at 6:00 pm sharp, turn on the porch lights. If you don’t, they will be able to see you. If they see you, hide in the basement. Make an escape by distracting them with the flashlights hidden in there. When they’re distracted, run outside and barricade the door with the wooden crates. Grab the green and black motorcycles in the garage, never the red one, as it attracts them. Carry no more than a steak knife and white ash.

Rule #9: Do not whistle at night. It attracts them.
