# The Moutain Takes

My father was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in his early forties. I was a teenager. By the time I graduated college, he had retired.

He was a man from a different time, a time when holding things in was just what men did. He never asked for help, never talked about what was wrong. He carried himself like someone who didn’t feel pain, or at least like someone who believed admitting it was worse than the pain itself.

I paid for school with scholarships, dedicating myself to the lacrosse team and my studies. It was worth it. With the money I saved, I took two years after college to be with my dad. I knew time was running out. Maybe if I was there, if I did enough, something between us would shift.

Fifteen months later, there was only one item left.

The Pacific Crest Trail.

He talked about it with reverence, like something that had to be conquered. He sneered at the Appalachian Trail, calling it “more difficult in all the wrong ways.” Too many stops, too many easy outs. Anything worth conquering was hard.

I was trying to figure out how to take a man with a failing heart on a 3,000-mile hike that climbed over 10,000 feet above sea level. I spent weeks mapping it out, searching for a way to make it possible. Before I could, the call came.

"David, your father didn’t wake up this morning."

The words hung there.

I was the one to break the silence.

"Okay, Mom. I’m on my way over."

 

**Campo – First Ashes**

Three months later, I was at the southern trailhead of the Pacific Crest Trail in Campo, California. My pack was heavy with water, gear, and a small bag holding my father's remains. I crouched at the trailhead, pulling the bag from my pack. The ashes shifted in my palm, held together only by thin plastic. The morning’s steady breeze was barely noticeable. It was a pleasantly warm April morning. Warmth wouldn't be something I'd have to search for in the first part of this trip. The moment loomed, waiting for me.

I struggled to hold back tears as I spread a small pinch of ash onto the dirt.

As the ashes disappeared into the earth, a wave of dizziness hit. My vision blurred, and my chest tightened. My heart pounded, erratic and sharp against my ribs. I wondered what my body was preparing for. Something terrible? Just silence.

For a moment, I didn’t realize I had stopped breathing.

"Stop it." My father's voice cut through my thoughts. "You're almost 26 years old. There's nothing to cry about."

I clenched my jaw, sealed the bag, and slung my pack onto my shoulders.

Then, the wind died. Not gradually, but in an instant, the world’s breath cut short.

The PCT waits.

 

**Mojave - Infinity and Frailty**

I stopped walking and looked out over the LA Aqueduct. Miles of empty earth stretched before me, cracked and lifeless. The last stagnant remnants of moisture drifted into the empty sky.

I was about halfway through this stretch of the Mojave. There was no shade. No escape from the sun, the punishing heat, the endless, flat, barren landscape. Some people find beauty in it. Not me. Another thing I never understood.

I pulled out my father's remains. The bag sagged along the edges of my palm. I expected grief, but instead, there was only a dullness. A sense of uselessness.

For a moment, as I gripped the bag, I remembered my father helping me reel in my first fish, the excitement in his voice as he guided my hands. Just for a second, I could feel pride, almost warm.

"A suckerfish?" He scoffed. "We don’t eat those." I could still feel the full weight of my failure.

The wind brushed against me, dry and unfeeling, whistling across the sand. How long had it been since I saw someone? At some point, I passed someone on the trail, but I couldn't picture their face. I couldn’t picture any face.

The infinity of the desert contrasted with the finality of life. The tears rolled off my chin.

The scorched earth swallowed them like it swallowed everything here.

“Nothing you do will last”.

I took a pinch of his ashes and held them in my hand.

“Why are you crying? Go to your room if you want to act like that.”

The wind swept my father up immediately, enveloping him in dust, and then he was gone, part of the endless flat. As if he never existed.

For the first time, I felt like the void was staring into me.

 

**Kennedy Meadows – Homecoming**

Kennedy Meadows. Pop 200. Elev 6,427. The most famous sign on the trail. A place where hikers stop, arms raised, grinning through exhaustion. A moment to celebrate the climb. My father would have never taken a picture here.

Still, this place meant something. He talked about it often. The gateway to the Sierras.

I always felt most at home in the mountains. Here, I almost forgot the desert. The heat, the emptiness, both replaced by peace.

For the first time in weeks, my shoulders relaxed. Maybe this was what I had been searching fo…

“You are so dramatic”.

The voice came sharp, just behind my ear. My stomach clenched, a slow, aching pressure spreading through my chest.

“Why?”

“Listen to me, son.”

**Forester Pass - Deth in a Winter Wonderland**

Forester Pass, 13,153 feet above sea level. The highest point on the Pacific Crest Trail. Up here, the world felt thin. Judging.

Then, a scream!

A woman’s scream doesn't belong in a remote place. Painful. Desperate. Piercing. The sound broke the silence, echoing off the cliffs like something alive, twisting in every direction. Stalking me.

There was the scream again. It bore into me, stopping my lungs, squeezing my heart, and pulling me forward. It felt wrong, not just in the way an injured voice feels wrong, but like a voice from another world.

I ran...

to the summit. Then I stopped. There was no woman.

A mountain lion lay in the snow, ribs pressing against matted fur. A body eating itself. Something had twisted the creature's hindquarters. It looked gruesome and deformed. It was alive for now but soon become part of the cold.

A predator shouldn't be here. Not like this. A wounded hunter, helpless on such a popular stretch of the trail. Something about it felt… placed.  Placed for me. 

An intrusive thought gripped my soul. I was being tested.

My throat tightened. My ears rang. My vision tunneled until there was only the broken beast before me. My father’s voice rose up, unbidden.

"What are you doing?"

The lion snapped at me face now blurry.   Soon it gave way to my father's face.  I froze. Shame. Fear. The weight of his disappointment, crushing.

"Kill it!"

My hands trembled. I couldn't move. The past rose up like bile. The weight of things forever left unsaid. My father’s voice, louder now. Angrier.

"Fine! I'll do it myself!"

"You can't!" I shouted, the words breaking from me. And the mountain heard.

The mountain threw my words back in a dozen directions. Mocking. Twisting them. Not mine anymore.

The lion snapped at me a second time.

"You can't do anything," I whispered. "Now."

The mountain froze time, waiting to pass sentence. The lion's body trembled beneath my hands. It screamed. Desperation given sound. I pushed. A final, awful yowl. Then, the crack of bone on rock.

The world fell silent.

I stood there, breath uneven. My hands shook as I pulled the small bag of my father’s ashes from my pack. I let a handful fall over the same cliff. A few specks fluttered down to the lion’s fur. Then, I let myself fall backward into the snow.

 

**Sonora Pass – Marked by the Mountain**

Tuolumne County. The end of the High Sierra. This pass should have been a transition, a milestone, but I felt nothing. I was nothing. My father's voice pulsed through my mind. I couldn't hear my own thoughts anymore.

"I never thought I’d want one of my kids to join the military, but it might be the only way for you."

I swallowed against the rising nausea. The stark silence of the mountain mirrored the emptiness inside of me. Or had the mountain marked me, carved its cold into my soul?  I had changed, but I couldn’t put my finger on how.  The mountain was why.

The wind howled through the pass. Or maybe it didn’t. Maybe the sound was inside me.

Flickering.

The edges of the pines pulsed, blue, green, shifting. Just for a second, I thought I saw movement between the trees. But when I looked, nothing. Just the faint memory of something that was never there.

"You are too emotional."

I ran my hands over my face, rough and hard. Trying to feel. Trying to silence his voice. My heartbeat was too loud. My breath too ragged.

"You’ve never tried."

I sucked in air, but it wasn’t enough. The cold burned my skin, but my body was sweating. My head throbbed, my vision a lie.

"Give up."

I spun, barely thinking, and slammed my fist into the nearest tree. My knuckles tore against the rough bark. I pulled back, blinking at the blood dripping into the snow. The red spread in delicate veins across the ice before disappearing. The snow melted, repulsed by me.

I exhaled.

Finally, I felt something.



**Donner Pass - Ghosts of History**

For those who don’t know California, moving past the High Sierras might seem like a return to civilization. It is emptier.

The trail winds through some of the least visited places in the country, Truckee National Forest, Plumas National Forest, Lassen Volcanic National Park. Most hikers call this stretch the Northern Sierras. I think of it as something else.  It is the wilderness.

This was the part of the trip I had been looking forward to the most.

Sierra City was an option, but it was too remote to rely on. I had read about hikers shipping resupply boxes to the post office, but I had a different plan. I would gather what I needed at Boreal Ski Resort, then push through to Old Station without stopping. No supply drops. No civilization. Just me, the land, and whatever I could find along the way.

I would start heavy, my pack stuffed with high-calorie food. But with foraging and water purification, I thought I could make it. I had thought a lot of things before this trip. At this point in the trip, all thought was gone. There was only do.

Boreal was dead. The parking lot empty. Not just empty, wrong. Two figures stood near the top of the lift, still and dark against the sky. Wide-brimmed hats. Motionless. Watching.

I turned away. Took in the vending machines, the bare shelves of the resort shop. Nothing. No   real food. No protein. My stomach twisted. A foreign thought slid into my mind like it had always been. I understand why they did it. The ones stranded here in the winter of 1846.  The mountain rebuked them. And when hunger stripped them to the bone, they survived.

Would I?

“No.”

My father’s voice answered before I could.  For a movement it was like my father was alive, there with me.

The reflection in the vending machine glass wasn't me anymore. Replaced. Perhaps the mountain’s next victim.

For the first time, I thought about quitting. About going home.  Becoming what my father knew I was.

"You never follow through.”

I saw his disappointment in my own reflection.  

"This isn’t your dream. You don’t even get it."

His words clashed against the silence of the mountain, pulling me in two. I could hear the emptiness tugging at me to go on. The mountain pushed me forward. My father wanted me to stop. I didn’t want anything anymore.

I took a detour.  Soda Springs, just a mile and a half off-trail. It was better than starving or trying to hike on Doritos and honey buns.

After weeks in the wild, civilization felt intrusive and staged. My own footsteps on the pavement felt too sharp, too hollow.

Inside the small general store, racks of dehydrated meals and survival gear lined the walls. Water filters, fire starters, vacuum-sealed meat sticks. Everything I needed.

I reached for a package of dried mango. Stopped. Moved my hand to a different shelf. Picked up a compass instead. Turned it over, slowly feeling I had never seen one before.

The man behind the counter wore a Grateful Dead t-shirt, a long gray ponytail. His eyes, too dark, lifeless. Something behind them didn’t feel real.

“PCT?” he asked.

I stared at him. Too long. I wanted to stop but couldn’t.   At some point I nodded.

He barely moved. “You looking for something, son?”

The word rang in my head, repeating.

Son.

Son.

Son.

It wasn’t his voice anymore. It was my father’s.

"Everyone is looking for something," I said.  That wasn’t what I meant to say.

I was still holding the compass. Turning it. Turning it. The shopkeeper’s eyes flicked to my hands. I hadn’t stopped moving.

“Son.”

The man nodded, slow. “Things get real remote up north, son.”

My fingers tightened around the compass. Pressing into the metal until it hurt.

“Son.”

“It might not be the best place to search,” he continued. “People rarely find what they’re looking for out there.”

I shoved my food into my pack. Didn’t count it. Didn’t care. The knife burnt in my hand. I set it down, deliberate. I ran from the store, from the man, from the way his eyes had swallowed me whole.

The highway was the last boundary. I stood on the north side of I-80, looking back at the scattered buildings. The last sign of civilization I would see for weeks.  The sky pressed low.

I turned back to the trail.

There, just beyond the trees. A woman. Squat. Robust. Beautiful.  I couldn’t take my eyes off her. She stood still, watching. Her lips somewhere between a smirk and a smile. For a moment, she was topless. And then… gone.

Cars howled. I grabbed my father’s ashes. Before I could think, I spread a handful onto the dirt.  For a movement I felt safe. I didn’t know why. So, I kept walking.

And behind me, a big rig swallowed my offering.

 

**Wilderness Night 1 – Lurking**

The night was too quiet. No wind. No insects. No distant animal calls. Just a void where sound should be. I couldn’t even hear my father’s voice anymore.

Inside the thin walls of my tent, the silence pressed against me. Heavy. Suffocating. The air itself felt noxious, too thick in my lungs. I shifted in my sleeping bag.  The tent felt small.  The fabric pressed in.   It felt as if it might collapse on me. 

Something stirred outside. 

So soft I almost missed it. Something brushed against the fabric of my tent. Just once. Just enough. I held my breath. Listened.

Nothing.

Then again.

I exhaled slowly, desperately trying to think. A branch? No. I knew better. There was no wind. But something in me wanted to believe it. Wanted to pretend.

The touch returned. Not a brush this time, a faint, deliberate scratch. Then another. Then another. Animals? Not claws. Fingertips. Soft. Not in one place. All around me.

I sat up too fast, my vision swimming. My breath felt like it didn’t belong to me. "Hey!" I meant to shout, but my voice barely carried. A child calling out in the dark.

The scratching stopped.

Silence, deeper than before. A silence that was waiting.

Then, just beyond the fabric, a sound. A whistling. Low. Soft. Inviting.

I had the sudden, irrational urge to unzip the tent. I needed to. Something in my chest pulled toward the night. My hands twitched toward the zipper.   My mind rejected the moment, but to my body is was very real. 

I clenched my teeth. Dug my nails into my arms. Shook my head hard. The sound stopped.

The silence returned. Deeper and darker than before.  It was so silent the forest seemed to pulse.  No longer waiting, instead reaching out to me. 

  

**Wilderness Night 2 – Footprints in the Silence**

The unnatural silence stretched through the next day’s hike. The sun filtered through the trees, dull and gray. I tried to focus on my breath. but it was muted.  It wasn’t humid, but heavy air pressed against me like chains.

Beneath my feet, the earth felt fake. Hollow. Like I was walking over something that had been covered up.  Someone spoke inside my mind, "Something old."

I set up camp farther from the trail than usual. Maybe this would help.  Distance meant safety, maybe.

Inside my tent, the fabric felt thinner than before. The poles felt weak. The only thing separating me from the night was a barrier too fragile to stop anything larger than a beetle. I closed my eyes. Forced my body still. Sleep. I just needed sleep.  My exhaustion hung on my like weights. Pulling me into the hard dirt beneath my tent.  I began to drift off.

A brush against the fabric.  My eyes snapped open.

Then, again.

Slowly the brushing gave way to scratching.   Soft at first, like before. But this time, it built into a rhythm. Coordinated. Precise.  Complex.  Almost tribal. I could taste the sound, my mind racing fought itself. Wind would be random. Animals wouldn’t move in sync.

A new sound. Soft.  A whisper just outside the tent. I couldn’t make out the words, but it was human?  There shouldn’t be anyone here. No signs of people. No distant flashlights. No crunch of footsteps approaching.  

The tent was a tomb. Thin fabric. Flimsy poles. The forest was trying to swallow me whole, to bury me in this tomb. 

My pulse pounded through my body.  Soundless. Intense.  My soul trying to break free of its physical bounds

The whistle. Not soft. Loud. Structured.  Matched by a low, rhythmic thudding. Like knocking on a hallow thing.

How did my hand get to the tent zipper? I clenched my teeth. Tore my fingers away. The cold air stung my skin. My throat locked. I was ready to die.   The zipper moved slightly.  More a jiggle. It was a hand inside the tent. My hand? Maybe yours?  The hand retracted sharply.   The zipper continued to move.  Just a little. 

The first rays of sunlight woke me. I didn’t remember falling asleep.

Had I dreamed it? Had I imagined everything? I stepped outside and collapsed immediately.

Footprints.

Everywhere.

I crouched, pressing my fingers into the dirt. Five distinct toes. Barfoot humans. Too many. I felt dizzy.  Trying to stand I stepped up, and my legs folded. My body hit the dirt before my mind caught up.

Rising to my feet I looked around. The prints were everywhere. Some ended abruptly at trees, as if the person had walked into the trunk and disappeared. Others mocked me from impossible places, perched on cliffs I could never reach. Or running vertical up an unpassable grade. 

A perfect ring of them circled my tent.  To regular for chance. They had been standing right there. Waiting for me. A damp chill crawled over my skin.

The forest wanted something.  It wanted me.  Part of me wanted it too. 

And I was still there.

 

**Wilderness Night 3 – The Weight of Silence**

Cold. Still. Repulsive.  Dreading of the night.  Shadows pulsed around me.  The forest breathing in anger. 

Along the trail, there was a large tree, roots upturned by a wild force.   Small spring-colored spheres perched in the gnarled roots.  The roots reached out to me.  Wanting to hold me in an embrace.  I retreated to the other side of the trail, shaking, moving faster.  Around the next turn, there was the same tree.  The same roots.   And a third time. And a fourth. I stopped riddled with exhaustion 

My thoughts were no longer my own.  Lean in.  I did. trying to identify the intrusive spheres.   Easter eggs. A dozen decorated Easter eggs.  On the root of the fallen tree. They had strange symbols on them.   Dashes and dots and circles.  The symbols moved and shifted.  Betraying comprehension.   The forest turned dark as a moonless night.

Tempting whistles from below the tree.  Sweet.  Demanding.  My eyes fixed on a small cave or burrow running under the log.  Come. The whistles beckoned.   I wanted to climb in; it seemed I could just fit. Warm.  From somewhere. 

Down

Down

Down.

Then I was somewhere else.  Sometime else.  Later. Dark.  Time to set up camp.  How long had it been?  Did I crawl into the barrow?

The tent was no shelter.  Inside there was no safety. They were coming.  They were always coming.  

Come they did.

The rhythm was beautiful and terrifying.  Terrifying in a way that only the truest beauty can be.   But there hidden inside the beauty they had become impatient.  My resistance would be punished. 

The fabric around me began to sink in. Deliberate.  Outlines of hands reaching to me.   The tent turned liquid.  Hands reached.

I began to pant like dog. No. Not a dog.  Nothing natural.  My muscles contracted.  They could almost touch me now.  I could only rock.  As my head pulsed.   Blackness enclosed me.  The taste metallic.  That is all I remember.



**Wilderness Night 5 – Space**

Eyes darted. The trail not real. Only the forest. The forest in them. No. They are the forest. It is them.

No signs of people. No footprints. No broken branches. No signs. People are clumsy. How could they hide?

I saw terrifying nothingness. Edges of my vision grew dark. With every stop, my pack got heavier. Too heavy. Too much.

I had no sense of direction. Far too often I checked my map and compass. Putting faith in my equipment even when I couldn't find faith in myself. The trail was gone. It was a cave. A prison.

The silence was all-encompassing. The cracking of a stick. The crunch of a leaf. No matter how far I wandered in the direction of the sound, there was nothing there. Just mountain, tree, silence, darkness, nothing. Nothing at all.

Where was I? Why? Thoughts float away on butterfly wings. How long had I been walking?

The cloudless sky released a light rain. Lighting flashed. Small creatures riding the incoming storm. Water fell in sheets. Were these my tormentors?

I almost missed it. A small side trail down down down. To the east. Unmarked. Unofficial? It was dark. Shelter. I followed. The wind howled, pushing me down the path. Shelter. A path to shelter. Have I been here before? How did I know.

The trail cut down steep ravine. Rocky cliffs covered two sides, and a large rock outcropping stood on the third. The night was here.

Why was there a flower in my pack? Something strange. Twisted peddles. Mangled unnatural. White. Streaks of red. A mockery of purity. I held it in my hand. Peddles melting. Dripping cold lava.  Was this a gift or an omen?

My camp was set up. How? I had only just arrived. The fire was out. A few glowing ambers. When did it start? How late was it? Too late. The rain came again. Harder.

Movement in the dark. Slow. Patient. Calm. Stalking. Shadows take vague shape. Human? Not quite. Almost. On the cliffs. Watching. Waiting. Judging. Me. All for me.

Shadows crawled over rocks. Jumped from cliffs. Everywhere. I was surround. No escape. No refuge. Closer. I could smell them. Subtle. Sweet. I wanted more.  More.  more.  It filled my lungs, wrapped around my being. I couldn't get enough.  Was I smiling?

At some point I vomited. Was I shaking? Skin standing up, dancing in the moon light. Eyes wide. Breath? It didn’t matter. Lights danced in my vision. A celebration? I was theirs?

The shadow figures grew.  They stretched and contorted toward me. Almost on me.  I could touch them. I wanted.  I was afraid.  What should I do? 

Then a voice. Not a whisper. English. A high-pitched roar, “Get in the tent.” Why? It hadn’t helped before.

Again.

“Get in the tent!”  It was my father's voice, but it wasn't. It was higher. Broken. Painful to my ears. It invaded my mind. Twisted my body.

I was a child.  Child desperate for approval. I obeyed. Like a good boy, I obeyed. Do not question. Do not fret. Obey.

I woke before the sun. Did I sleep at all? What had happened? They were there. I saw them for the first time. Where were they now?

Slowly, hand shaking I opened my tent. Cautious. I stepped out into the open. It couldn’t be.

I was on the main trail. Directly. On. The trail. Tent in the middle. No cliffs. No shelter. Truly open. On que the wind picked up. Thrashing my tent. It was a live. A profane thing.  Breathing. Pulsing.   A thing that should not be. Could not be.  But is. 

I turned to the east. Wilderness. No trail. Dense. No one had been through there in some time.  No. No. This wasn't real. It couldn't be. The cliffs were here. I had just seen them. Last night?  Where did I sleep?

In the pines In the pines.

I shivered the whole night through.

Falling to my knees the mud soaked into my pants.  I was sinking.   Slow.  Too slow.  Falling in a dream.  It was pulling me.  I was defeated. I was dead.



**Unknow – No Rest for the Wicked** 

I floated above the body. The known unknowable. No longer me. No longer.

The body moved forward. Mindless flesh. Autonomous meat.

Did it stop? Did it eat? Did it sleep? Driving forward.

Day, now night. Trees moved. Creatures watched. The forest was alive.

Shift fields of view. Unknowable things. Numb. Lost.

Moving on.

One step.

Another.

Forward.

From where? To where?

How many days? Weeks?

We passed here before? No it’s different. Is it?

Judgment.

What was I? The meat hesitated. A sign. Letters, symbols. Meaning. Recognition clawed its way up from the void. Something... familiar. 

Closer

Closer

Back to something. Back to me.

There was no indication of how long I had been there. There I was, looking at the simple wooden sign. It told me I was entering Lassen Volcanic National Park.

 

**Lassen Volcanic National Park – Portal to Another World**

The trail twisted before me. My mind sagged under exhaustion. My eyes burned with dust and sweat. The world wouldn’t hold still. The path bent, folded, stretched away. A nightmare landscape.

I forced my feet forward. One step. Then another.

A geyser hissed ahead. Steam rose, thick and churning. The wind didn’t touch it. It hung in place, shifting. Waiting.

A shape formed in the mist. Large. Wrong. A presence. No longer just steam, something growing inside of it. My throat was tight. My mouth dry. It moved. Shifted. Solidified.

Too long. A torso, growing. Hulking. A human shape becoming something else. Something more.

It reached for me. Arm stretching, growing, coming for me.

A hand on my shoulder.  Not air. Not a hallucination. A touch. Ethereal, then solid. Then gone.

I stumbled back. My legs didn’t work right. The ground swelled, buckled beneath me. The trail twisted like a snake. Shapes rose from the dirt, flickering, darting past me. The world was elsewhere.  This was wrong.

Pieces of the trail broke off and fell up.

Run.

I tried, but the ground moved too fast. The trees weren’t where they should be. Then they were. Every time I blinked, the world shifted.

The path led me to a lake. Boiling Lake. A popular tourist site.

Not now.  Now, it was something else. A portal? A trap? Something stirred beneath the surface.

Ripples. Growing. Moving. Rising.

A figure broke the surface.

Then another.

And another.

Hundreds. Tall. Thin. Too thin. Soft glowing. Human-like, but off. My hunters had arrived.

Here.  In broad daylight.  The air thickened. Poisonous. I couldn’t inhale. I was hollowed out.  I found my ability to run. 

I ran.

Without thought. Without purpose. I ran to run.

The whispers joined the chase. Everywhere. The rocks. The trees. Inside my skull.

Something grabbed my pack. A force. A hand? A claw? Something indescribable. Yanked backward. I almost fell.

They were closer.

I could smell their sweetness again. The scent filled my head, thick, cloying. I yearned for it.  Sometimes I still do.

I ripped myself free. My pack tore from my shoulders, the straps biting deep as it was pulled away.

I ran.

They chased.

I fell.  The ground hurt.  I had no time to feel.   The whispers were on top of me. 

I ran.

Downhill, uphill, through trees, over ground that wouldn’t stay still.

I ran.  Until I collapsed.  Face in the dirt. Gasping. Waiting for them to reach me. To take me. To do whatever they wanted. I had no fight left.  I was tired.

The whispers closed in.  But nothing touched me.  I blinked. Gasped for air.

Ahead, thirty feet away. A tree. I knew this tree.  Fallen. Gnarled roots. A burrow underneath. Painted offerings carefully placed.

The same tree. The same damn tree. The forest exhaled. I crawled to the tree.  Nails broke. Fingers bled.

The whispers again. 

This time, from the burrow. Calling to me.

I could hear footsteps now. They were close.

There was nothing I could do.

I climbed into the burrow.

 

**The White Room – A Reckoning**

The room was infinite. Every surface glowed with soft white light. I felt dizzy and weak from the running. The void could no longer stare into me.

At the very edge of my vision, dark figures lingered. Humanoid but not human. Too tall. Too thin. Dark, featureless shadows. Then a shift—they pulsed with light in perfect rhythm. A humming filled my ears. Not a sound. Not exactly. Something deeper. Something internal. I felt more than heard. Their forms camouflaged against the walls, shifting, dissolving, reforming.

I looked around, and these beings were everywhere, methodically approaching from every direction. Literally every direction. Around me, above me, below me. They didn’t walk; they floated, hovering and drifting closer, slow and confident. They had won. I was unable to move as they grew larger and larger. I tried to scream but heard nothing.

The unnatural silence had returned. Not quiet. Nothing.

They grew larger.

I reached for the ground. Nothing. Stretched my arms. Nothing. Suspended. Not floating. Just… existing. No failure or success. Without matter. All I could do was be. Less than human. Less than anything. Time moved. Or it didn’t. I couldn’t tell where my body ended and where space began.

I had never felt so free. Not before. Not since.

Closer now. Bringing the sweet smell.

I couldn't feel the air entering my lungs or the sweat on my skin. When I tried to inhale deeply, nothing happened.

Larger.

I looked down at my body. I was completely naked. My skin seemed abnormally pale under the light.

They were on top of me now, a wall of black. All my senses were muted. Gone.

Had I ever been?

My father spoke in my head, but it was different now. Softer. Strained. He was trying to break through something to reach me.

"We can’t enjoy anything with you. You always ruin it."

A million voices called out at once in a million different languages. I recognized words but couldn't grasp them. They fluttered out of my mind as soon as they hit my ears. Slowly, the sound became clearer. More recognizable. Until all voices spoke in unison.

"Where do you come from?"

"I don't know," I replied.

"Nowhere," my father's voice contradicted. He sounded hoarse.

"Where are you going?" The voices grew more demanding.

"I. I don't remember." They were in my head, jumbling my thoughts.

"Back to nowhere," my father’s voice—only a raspy whisper now.

"Who will you be?"

"I don't know."

"You try so hard to be different." Was I hearing or just remembering?

"What have you lost?"

"I think I’ve lost everything."

"You are losing me." My father’s voice, stretched thin. Struggling. A tether. A final snap. A last breath. Then, nothing.

"What is missing?"

"Myself?"

"What do you want?"

I hesitated. I searched for the answer, but I didn’t know how to give it.

The voices shifted, layered over one another, overlapping until they collapsed into a single whisper.

"You are what you dream."



**Shasta – the Impossible Summit**

*"Don't try to move,"* someone yelled over the loud thump of a black, unmarked helicopter.

I unfolded back into the world. I was aware of my body for the first time. Calm. Relaxed. My thoughts were slow and meticulous. "Where am I?" I asked.

"Mt. Shasta, at the summit," the medic said as he tightened the straps around my body. A medic? In a dark suit and sunglasses at the summit? It felt off, but I didn't care.

My eyes fluttered open. Everything looked sharper now. I could feel the air bringing life into my body. For the first time in my life, I was calm. A profound, all-consuming calm. I felt an overwhelming sense of presence. Not just in the world, but in that moment and every moment to follow.

Memories circled on the edges of my mind. The creatures. The white room. The last one lingered. More important than the rest. There, on that peak, it bled into me. It was more than something I did, it was something I had become.

For the briefest moment, I searched for something. My father’s voice was... gone. An ever-present part of my mind had been stripped away, taking my shame and self-doubt with it. Alone with myself, I felt light. No fear.

Summiting Shasta alone was impossible, for me. I wasn’t a mountaineer. Sixty days from Campo. Even without climbing the mountain, that wasn't possible. Even at a world-record pace, the math didn’t work. Time hadn’t just left me behind. It had lost me.

A family found my backpack a few weeks later. It was less than a mile past Boiling Lake, only about twenty feet off the trail. Everything was there, except for my father’s ashes. Without a trace. Gone with his voice. Gone with his life. As if he had never existed at all.
