Hey guys,

It’s been a while since… everything. Since I became what I am now, what the house has made me.

The family moved out shortly after that night. Margaret, David and Jamie… but they haven’t abandoned me. They leave groceries at the doorstep, pay the bills online, check in from a distance.

I can’t leave the house. Not really. The air itself seems to push me back, the floors, the walls, the shadows - they all insist I stay. But I don’t fight it. Not anymore. 

Jamie… he’s different now. Normal, peaceful, happy in ways he never could be before. He smiles again. He laughs. He’s just a child. His parents embrace him now. I’ve watched out the window when they pull up to deliver me my essentials. I’ve seen them hug, hold hands, and be affectionate. They’re finally a normal family.  And I made it possible. That thought… It brings me a strange, terrible satisfaction.

I know they’re grateful to me. That’s why they don’t abandon me. It would be easy - they could just walk away and no one would question it. No one would come knocking at their door. But they know what I did. They know the sacrifice I made. But they never enter the house. And they know not to engage with me, to give me any attention, or affection.. They know that will make things worse.

My days pass in strange rhythms. I wake with the house, or maybe the house wakes me. I move through the rooms slowly, like I belong to the shadows now. I feed myself, care for myself, all without stepping outside. I talk to myself sometimes - or maybe the house talks to me. I feel the pulse of its strength under the floorboards, in the walls, even in the air.

I am changing. I can feel it. The darkness inside me grows. Patience turns to hunger. I feel it when I touch the basement door - the place where it all began. Some nights, I keep it closed, carefully, reverently, as though sealing away something too wild even for me. Other nights… I embrace the pull. I feel it rising through the floorboards, testing me, and I let it. I am stronger then. More alive than I ever felt as a human.

The house is mine. Its walls breathe, its shadows twist at my whim. I spend hours moving through it, watching, listening, waiting. Waiting for something to enter, to test me. And when it comes, I will be ready. I am patient. I am clever. I am power.

\-----------  


It’s a rainy evening. The kind of rain that drizzles like needles, steady and cold. The street outside the house is empty except for a single boy in a hooded coat. He’s young, maybe early teens, his sneakers soaked through, one earbud dangling loose. He’s holding a clipboard under his arm - some kind of school collection, or raising funds for a basketball team. He glances at the house, frowning. It looks abandoned from the outside. No lights on upstairs. Curtains drawn. But something about it makes him pause.

He hesitates at the gate, peering through the iron bars. The front garden is overgrown now, slick with rain. The air around the house feels… thicker somehow. He swallows and wipes water from his forehead. Then he steps forward, up the cracked path to the front door.

I felt him before he reached the gate - a young, pulsing warmth moving through the rain. My eyes snapped open. The house’s heartbeat quickened, a low thrum in the floorboards.

He approached, sneakers squelching in the wet path. He stopped at the porch, frowning. The house looked abandoned from the outside, but something in it pulled him closer.

I rose from the chair, slow and deliberate. Shadows uncoiled from the corners and slithered after me as I crossed the hall. I could feel Valekar stirring inside me, its dark joy rising like a tide.

The boy hesitated, glanced at the windows, then knocked. Once. Twice. “Hello?” His voice cracked slightly.

My fingers brushed the basement door as I passed it. I always kept it closed now, but the power behind it thrummed through the wood. The longer I stood here, the stronger the current. It wanted release. And tonight, I’d give it one.

I stopped at the front door, laying my hand against the knob. For a heartbeat, a flicker of the old me rose up - the one who once tried to save a boy instead of using him. Jamie’s laugh echoed in my head.

But Jamie was safe. I had made sure of that.

Now it was someone else’s turn.

I drew in a slow breath, focusing, channeling the shadows through me. It was like pulling a storm from my chest, the negative energy curling around my arms and fingers, gathering at the door like a predator ready to pounce.

Outside, the boy knocked again. “Hello? Is someone there?”

The house hummed. The shadows hissed. My lips curled into a smile that wasn’t mine anymore.

I turned the knob, and the door creaked open, just enough to show a sliver of darkness inside.

The shadows shifted eagerly behind me, ready to be released.

Tonight, I would feed them.

Smiling a smile that isn’t mine anymore, I whisper through the opening:

“Come in.”
