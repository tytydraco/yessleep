 The thought of moving into a haunted house was exciting for me. I didn’t really believe in the paranormal, but I also didn’t not believe in it if that makes any sense.

I’m in my mid-30s, single, and even though I always imagined one day settling down with a wife and dog and white picket fence none of that seemed to be happening. I’m not the most handsome guy and combine that with being a little socially awkward I realized it was more realistic to get the house first than a partner.

It’s not a big place either. It’s 1200 square feet with a tiny backyard and the neighbors are so close I can almost reach out and touch their house without leaving my yard. But it was mine. It was a long house; a shotgun style house I think they’re called. The previous owners had bought it with the intention of flipping it. They had only done half the work, stopping midway through renovations and selling at a loss. It was the fault of the ghosts apparently.

The outside was beautiful. The siding was all new, a dark hunter green with bright yellow door that felt both cheerful and welcoming. The landscaping was simple but well done. Once you got into the house you could see where the renovations stopped. Some walls were painted, and some were not. The kitchen was untouched and didn’t look like it had been updated since the 70s. But the one bathroom and master bedroom had been completely redone and looked great. It was all I needed. I was certain that I could update the kitchen later if I wanted too. If the stove and fridge worked, I didn’t really care what it looked like.

I was the first of my siblings to purchase a house and my mom was thrilled at first when I told her. When she first came to visit, she seemed less than impressed.

Her face dropped as she walked into the home for the first time.

“Oh James, this place is only half done. And it’s so small!” She sighed, as she looked around my tiny home.

My mood dropped when she said that though I tried to not let it show.

“It’s all I need mom. I’m just a single guy. I don’t even have a dog yet. Besides, this is all I could afford. Houses are expensive around here.” I explained.

My mom shook her head and kept frowning.

“But, honey, if you get married there won’t be enough room for both of you and your children!” she said sadly.

After mom left that day, I tried to raise my spirits. My mom was always like that, and I should have prepared myself emotionally before she came over.

I ended up ordering a pizza and settling down for some gaming with my friends. Most of my friends live in other states and even other countries. But we’re all gamers so we have that to connect us. I had been showing them all pictures and videos of my home throughout the day, and at least they were impressed.

“Dang dude, you’re like an official adult now,” my friend Yuri chirped over the headset.

My mood lifted with that. At least my friends could appreciate my new place.

“Thanks man, though I hate to tell you I’ve been an adult since I was eighteen,” I snapped back.

On the screen I could see him shrug.

“If you say so man. I know I didn’t think of you as an adult till now,” he grinned at me.

I laughed. On the monitor I could see my other friends rolling their eyes at Yuri or they were just focusing on the game.

There were six of us total. Me, Yuri, Robert, Cheryl, Sadie, and Travis. A pretty full game night. A few of my friends were married or had kids so it was rare that they could have enough time to join a game session.

I was finally settling into the game in between bites of my dinner when my friend Cheryl caught my attention through the headset.

“Hey James, is there anyone with you right now?” She asked.

“Yeah, all of you guys,” I said as I sipped my beer.

“No, I mean in the house with you right now. Didn’t you say your mom left? I just saw someone walk past your doorway.” She sounded concerned.

I glanced down at her face on the monitor. She was staring intently at me with her controller down by her side.

I turned in my chair and looked behind me. There was nothing in the hallway. And my mom had been gone for hours, and I absolutely lived alone.

Turning back around I shrugged. “Did you see a shadow or something Cheryl? There’s no one here expect for me.” I tried to reassure her.

“Could you just go check? I swear to you that someone just walked past your doorway,” She sounded worried.

Mentally I rolled my eyes, but I smiled at her and nodded.

“Okay, I’ll just go check. Maybe it’s the ghosts after all,” I said trying to lighten the mood.

“Or maybe it’s just a good old-fashioned burglar, coming to steal your old Atari system and moldy pizza boxes!” Robert piped in over the headset.

“Robert, I’m being serious right now. I know someone walked by the door!” Cheryl hissed at him.

“Do you need us to have 911 on standby?” Sadie asked.

“You’re all the way in Kansas City Sadie, I don’t think they’ll reach me in time,” I laughed.

“Just yell if you need us, we’ll come running,” Travis joined in.

I loved my friends. I really did, but if someone was really in the house and I was about to me murdered they’d probably regret those jokes later.

I stood up and poked my head into the hallway. Nothing. I walked to the master bedroom. Also, nothing. Same for the kitchen and bathroom and living room. Say what you want about small houses but there is absolutely no place for a serial killer or burglar to hide in one.

When I came back into the second bedroom all my friends were waiting for an update. I shrugged, before sitting down and putting the headset back on.

“There’s nothing there, maybe the hallway lights or something caused a weird shadow. But I’m all alone in here,” I told everyone.

Cheryl still didn’t look convinced but everyone else accepted it. We kept gaming and everyone with kids or spouses started signing off as the hours passed till it was just me and Yuri gaming well past midnight.

But as 1am got closer even he was ready to call it a night. He lived on the east coast, so it was even later in the evening for him.

“I’ll talk at ya later. The sandman is finally calling me to bed,” he yawned over the headset.

“Same here. It was a good time. The best way to break in a new house is for a good gaming session,” I yawned back.

He laughed and signed off and I stood up with a groan. I was stiff from all the sitting. At least tomorrow was Saturday so I could sleep in and then get busy with putting everything away.

This would be my first full night in my new home. I was excited, but also felt a little nervous in a new place. The creaks and groans of the new house weren’t familiar yet. I hadn’t done enough to the place to make it feel like home. It almost felt like I was staying at an Airbnb instead of something I’d bought and paid for.

My bed was set up, but I hadn’t put the sheets on it yet. And I wasn’t going to either. No one was going to judge me expect the ghosts if there were any. I spread out a blanket to cover the bare mattress and pulled a knitted blanket on top of me. This would be just fine till morning. I had my phone in bed with me, and even though I was exhausted, I couldn’t resist some mindless scrolling till sleep finally took me.

I felt my eyes closing. It was a relaxing feeling, that need for sleep pulling you down till you couldn’t ignore it anymore. As I set my phone down a flash of movement by the doorway caught my eye. It was low to the ground and dark. My heart started pounding as the small burst of adrenaline hit my system. I know I was half asleep, but it had looked like hair. As if someone was peeking at me from the doorway with their head on the ground and then suddenly jerked out of sight.

I pushed myself off the bed and cautiously peered out into the hallway. I had my phone in hand, rearing it back as if I would use it to bludgeon someone. A stupid idea. It wouldn’t be a good weapon plus I’d break my phone when I needed it the most.

Reaching around the door frame I flicked on the hallway light. There was nothing. I stepped out into the hallway and closed the bedroom door behind me. I didn’t want anything sneaking into the bedroom with my back turned. If anything was there.

The second bedroom I used as my game room was closed, and I knew nothing was in there. I would have heard the door opening and closing. The doors and windows were locked. Nothing in the kitchen or living room. The bathroom was also clear. I felt myself relax as I realized I was alone. But I still felt like I saw something. Maybe it was a rat, though a rodent of that size running around my house, possibly chewing through cables in my electronics; didn’t make me feel any better.

When I went back to bed, I closed the door behind me and locked it. Probably not necessary but it made me feel better. At the very least it would be a deterrent to rats.

I was asleep as soon as I hit the bed. When I got up the next morning, I found out I had slept in more than I intended. Not that it mattered, I had the whole day to do whatever I wanted.

A nice breakfast and two cups of coffee later I was ready to get started. Luckily, I didn’t have much in the way of possessions. I had an extensive game collection and memorabilia, but beyond that my home was a bachelor pad. It made setting everything up easy though.

By 5pm that day I felt satisfied with everything. All I had to do now was get used to my new home. I sat on the couch and turned on the TV. After close to an hour of YouTube I realized I was bored and restless. Now was as good a time as any to get out and explore the neighborhood.

I locked up the house behind and picked a random direction to walk in. It was a good-sized neighborhood. All the houses were older and smaller than you’d see in a normal suburb. Some looked like they hadn’t been updated in decades and looked lived in and loved, others had new siding and had an air of modernity that made me think they had been bought and flipped like my house had.

The walk was therapeutic. I should make this a daily habit, I thought to myself. Getting out of the house, away from the electronics was a good way to detox.

“Hello!” a small quiet voice spoke from beside me and I jumped.

I looked around, my eyes finally settling on an old woman sitting on a metal folding chair in her front yard. She looked up at me, smiling and offering a slight wave. Beside her, an old dog of indeterminate breed slept beside her in the sun.

“Hello!” She said again, slightly louder, as if she was afraid I hadn’t heard her the first time.

“Hello!” I said back, perhaps with a little too much enthusiasm. She had startled me, but I felt I should still be polite.

“You just moved in, didn’t you? To that green house down the street? It used to be white,” she said matter-of-factly.

“Uh-huh,” I nodded back at her.

 I felt my mood drop. I like old ladies as much as the next person but that didn’t mean I wanted to sit and talk to her. Old ladies tended to ramble.  

She nodded sagely while reaching down and giving her dog a gentle pat. It didn’t wake but it stirred in his sleep.

“You be careful in that house. It’s had a lot of owners over the years. Not many people stay for long. There was a lady murdered in it. In the 70’s. It doesn’t seem that long to me, but I bet you weren’t even born yet,” she chuckled.

“Uh-huh,” I said noncommittedly, slowly edging away from her.

I knew it, she was a rambling old lady, and I was about to get sucked into a long conversation I didn’t ask for. I already knew the place was haunted. Supposedly it was anyway.

“I knew her, the lady who was murdered. My husband and I moved into this house when we were in our 30’s. It was our dream house. I remember Nancy. She was a sweet girl. Her husband was a monster though, but back then you never could intervene with those things. It wasn’t your place.” She said sadly.

“Uh-huh,” I said again, though I stopped backing away. I could spare a few minutes if she was going to give me the gory backstory to the house I lived in.

“He killed her one night. Bashed her head in. He was jealous, said she was trying to sneak out of the house, trying to leave him. Though if that was true, I wouldn’t blame her,” the old woman sniffed and wiped her nose.

I stood there, waiting for her to keep going. But she seemed to have been lost in thought. Either that or she was having a senior moment. I cleared my throat trying to get her attention.

“Sorry dear, I was lost in my memories. I’m Deborah by the way. Lovely to meet you. You should keep on with your walk, don’t mind me, I tend to ramble sometimes,” she waved her hand as if dismissing me.

I smiled at her and waved as I walked away, though I kept glancing back at Deborah. She seemed happy, just sitting there in her chair in the front yard. I wondered if she talked to everyone who walked by. If she did, I’d have to make sure not to walk past her house again.

The rest of my walk was uneventful. I even took the time to stop at the local coffee shop and had an iced tea before walking back home. Except for the weird encounter with the old lady, it had been a pleasant time.

It was getting dark by the time I made it back home. I had stayed out longer than I intended, and I had also gotten lost, several times. If I was going to take daily walks, I would have to get better at finding my way home.

Walking in the house it was dark, and I hesitated at the entrance. I could have sworn I left the table side lamp on at least. I hate walking into a dark house, so I always leave at least one light on. But it was off. I shrugged. Maybe I was misremembering.

There wasn’t much to do for the evening. It was just a matter of making myself some dinner and either watching a movie or playing a video game. I decided on leftovers and some good old solo gaming time. I had plenty of games I had been meaning to start.

I was warming up the pizza in the microwave, with my back to the living room, when the TV suddenly switched on. It wasn’t loud, but the sudden noise was enough to make me gasp and whirl around.

It was switched on to the local news channel. I stared at it for a few seconds before going over to turn it off. Then I turned it back on and selected Netflix. A movie sounded better with dinner anyway.

I did check the cables on the back of the TV to see of anything had come loose. And the batteries were good in the remote and it hadn’t fallen off the table, which might have explained why it switched on.

When I set down to eat my dinner, I was a little unsettled. The thought of ghosts was getting to me. And I didn’t even really believe in the supernatural. Maybe I need to get my house tested for radon.

The evening passed quickly enough. No one else was able to game that night, and I just mindlessly watched Netflix and messed around on my phone till it was midnight again. Another exciting evening in my new home in the bag.

That night I jolted awake. I had been fast asleep; I hadn’t even remembered falling asleep. My phone was in my hand still playing a relaxing rain sounds playlist from Spotify. I lay there for a few minutes trying to understand what woke me up. That’s when I heard it. A soft but unmistakable sound of something being dragged down the hallway.

I sat up right and stared at the bedroom door. I had closed and locked it again. Safety against any rats that might try to sneak in while I was unconscious. The sound was still there. Steady and obvious as it slowly made its way down the length of the hallway and into the living room.

There was no way I could blame this on a dream. And if it was a rat, it was the size of a dog; in which case I was terrified to find out what it was dragging down the length of my house.

My heart was pounding with the adrenaline that was being pumped into it. I sat there, minutes passing as I listened to whatever it was drag itself all over my house. I didn’t jump up to investigate like I did yesterday. This time I was genuinely afraid. And just as suddenly as the sound started it stopped. And still I sat there, listening to the silence. In some ways it was worse, because now I had no idea where the hell this thing was.

Another minute passed before I worked up the courage to go to the door, open it and peer into the hallway. It was empty. I did another quick check of the house, and it was all empty. Doors and windows all locked tight.

Going back to bed was hard. I thought about staying up watching TV but quickly dismissed the idea. I’d rather be safe in my locked bedroom than exposed in the living room. I grabbed my laptop and watched YouTube while sitting in bed. It felt safer, having some kind of noise in the room with me.

I did fall asleep, but only when the light of dawn was peaking over the horizon, and I heard birds chirping. I sighed and closed the laptop and passed out. When I woke up again it was well past noon, and I was starving. I also felt sheepish. In the light of day, the noises I heard last night seemed childish. It had to be rats. I had seen something the previous night and I needed to do the adult thing and call an exterminator.

Walking into the kitchen to make some food, I busied myself with looking up the local exterminators. And I looked up home made rat traps and natural deterrents. Maybe I should try to get rid of the things on my own before calling in the professionals.

The food and coffee helped. Though now I had no idea what to do today, expect set up some home-made rat traps. I did give my new house a good cleaning, mostly because I wanted to look for any sign of the elusive rodents. There were no droppings, no holes in the walls or ceiling; nothing that would indicate their presence.

I started googling how to test for radon. After all that I just sat on my sofa and tried to think. Between the stress of moving, getting used to a new place, and all the worry about rodent infestations and ghosts maybe I was just overwhelmed.

“Are there any ghosts in here?” I called out, surprising myself. I really hadn’t meant to speak, it just kind of burst out of me.

The sound of my own voice startled me. It hung heavy in the air. I hadn’t spoken to anyone or even heard my own voice since I spoke to the old woman the other day.

I hadn’t realized how quiet it was till the silence had been disturbed.

“If there are ghosts here, um, I’m sorry that you died,” I stammered.

“But if you are here, and it’s you making those noises, could you please stop? I’d like us to live together in peace. Neither of us can go anywhere. So, we’re kind of stuck together,” I explained to the probably non-existent ghosts.

“I know your name is Nancy. I talked to Deborah, she was your neighbor while you were, ah, alive,” I stammered again, feeling cringeworthy.

“If you don’t bother me, I won’t bother you. We can find a way to live together. I’ve always been good with roommates,” I explained.

The house was silent. I sat there for a full minute, my ears straining to hear anything. I wasn’t sure what I was even listening for. An actual answer? If I were to hear a disembodied voice I’d run right out of the house. But there was just silence. I took that as an answer.

“Alright. Well, I’m glad we could talk about it,” I said to the empty space.

 I rubbed my eyes with the palms of my hand while I said it, feeling like a complete idiot. But I did feel better all things considered.

The rest of the day and night were quiet and uneventful. The week passed in peace. And the next. I won’t lie, I half believed that addressing the ghost helped. The rational side of me just thought the giant rat that lived in my house had finally found a way outside. Either way, the silence at night was heavenly.

A month had passed in sweet silence, the only sounds in the house were the ones that I was making. I had gone on more walks, avoided Deborah, and had plenty of time to game with friends when they had the time to do it. I really felt like I was nailing this whole adult living in their own home thing, until the night when the sounds started up again.

A crash woke me up. I sat bolt up in bed and stared at the open door. I had stopped closing it and locking it at night a week ago. From the living room I heard another crash. The sound of obvious footsteps could be heard in the living room. My heart was pounding. This wasn’t like last time. This was very obviously a person walking around my home.

I reached for my phone and touched the screen. It was dead. I bolt of fear ran through me. Of all times for this thing to be dead it would happen tonight. I could still hear the footsteps in the living room when I heard a voice beside me.

“Don’t touch that phone, leave it right there,” a deep male voice said from somewhere beside me.

The adrenaline that flooded my system at that moment hit me so hard to made me lightheaded, and I jolted from the bed and ran for the door. Maybe I could make it outside.

Someone slammed into me from behind and I fell to the hallway floor with a loud oomph as the wind was knocked out of me. I lay there stunned as whoever hit me stayed on my back and placed his hand on head, pressing my face into the hardwood.

“Stay down! Just stay down!” The voice hissed into my ear.

His breath smelled foul, and if I could have turned my head I would have.

“There was someone here!? I thought you said no one was home?” The voice said from the living room. I could hear footsteps approaching even though I couldn’t turn my head.

“I thought that no one was home! The lights were off and there’s no car in the driveway,” the voice that was holding me down said.

I fought the urge to yell out that they should have checked the garage for a car but decided that I shouldn’t antagonize the burglars.

“Go check his room for a wallet,” The voice behind me hissed.

I managed to turn my head slightly so I could see the man in the living room out of the corner of my eye. He was wearing a dark and filthy hoodie with an equally filthy bandana covering his mouth. His eyes, the only thing visible, were wide with fear.

As I lay sputtering on the floor, I saw him snap around and face the living room again.

“What was that?” the guy asked, backing further into the hallway.

“What do you mean? What is it,” the man holding me said. His grip tightened on my hair, and I fought down the urge to yelp.

“I hear something! Some one else is in here with us!” He shot back, looking from me to his friend and back again to the living room.

That’s when I heard it. That same shuffling sound that I hadn’t heard for weeks. As is something was being dragged along the floor. This time I heard grunting too, as if someone was exerting themselves with their movements.

My heart leapt again. I could hear what it was getting closer and moving into the light. It was a head. Thick and dark hair covered a skull that was only half there. If I looked closer, I could see what looked like brain matter or congealed blood glinting in the light from the caved in cranium. My stomach heaved at the sight of it.

The head moved further into the light, and I could see it was attached to a body. A woman. Her dress, I couldn’t tell what color it had been originally, was so caked in blood that it was impossible to tell. The eyes rolled in her sockets as she looked up at the burglars. They were bloodshot but I could tell that they were brown. I could see the hurt and fear in them. And anger. Her jaw was dislocated but she still managed a strangled squeal, if she was trying to talk or scream, I couldn’t tell; and it honestly didn’t matter.

The man holding me down finally let me go and jumped back. He let out a low scream, as if there was no breath in his lungs and he still tried to make a sound. I took the opportunity to push myself towards the hallways wall and as far from the apparition and the men as I was able to get, and I looked up. His face was covered too, but his eyes were uncovered and wide with shock.

The smaller man who had been in the living room was slowly backing away down the hallway. He was letting out a series of high-pitched screams before he finally turned and bolted, heading straight to the back door.

The other burglar followed right behind him. I heard the door slam open, and I the glass rattled in its frame as the door hit the side of the house before swinging back shut with a clang. I breathed a sigh of relief when they left, then I snapped my head back down the hallway towards the living room to look for the woman. There was no one there.

I lay there, my head reeling and trying to catch my breathe. I pushed myself up and to my feet. I ran to the back door and made sure it was closed and locked. I slid the deadbolt in place and looked back to the living room. Still nothing. I blinked and rubbed my head. A concussion, it had to be a concussion. That guy slammed into me so hard I had to be disoriented.

I called the police in a daze. And an ambulance for my head. I waited for them outside on the front porch in a fog, my eyes returning to living room to see if the entity would reappear. There was nothing there. And it was deathly quiet, almost like it was waiting for something.

“Thank you,” I muttered into the darkness of the house. I felt the energy shift then, as if whatever was in there, whatever had helped me, was satisfied with my thanks.

The police came, and the ambulance. My neighbors who I had never met came out of their houses to stare and point. A few of them filmed me with their phones. I hoped noting about tonight ended up on YouTube or TikTok.

I did end up going to the hospital just to be safe. I had to call my mom and my brother and sister just to let them know what was going on. Mom was hysterical, I almost regretted calling her; but if I didn’t, I’d never hear the end of her asking why I didn’t call her. I messaged my friends letting them know what had happened. Since none of them lived close they sent flowers and video chatted. Yuri sent me some DoorDash which legit made me tear up.

Going back home after the hospital was surreal. I hesitated slightly on the doorstep wondering if I should have stopped at a church for holy water. But the house felt different. It felt lighter, but also expectant. Like it was excited to see me. I took a few deep breathes and walked in. It didn’t matter if this place was haunted or not This wasn’t the movies where you could just move away at the drop of a hat. I was stuck here. Besides, I still liked my home.

I sighed and stretched out my arms in resignation.

“I’m home,” I said, feeling the tension leave my body.

“Welcome home,” a tiny voice said from somewhere deep within the house.

I chose to ignore it.
