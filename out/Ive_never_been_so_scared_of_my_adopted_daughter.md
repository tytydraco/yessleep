We adopted a little girl, a couple of years ago. Her name is Madeline. She is now 11 years old. We were a happy family with my wife Jude, Madeline and me. 
Happy, until last week. Jude and I went out to get some groceries while Madeline stayed home. It was her third time home-alone, but today a bit longer than normal. Normally, we'd just go for a walk that takes about half an hour. This time, we'd be away for 1,5 hours because the local grocerystore is a 45 minutes drive. We didn't think much of it, so we just went in the car and began our journey to the store.

We did gave Madeline a phone so she could call us whenever she wanted and when there is possible danger. She never really did call us, 'cause she's been very shy since we've adopted her. She never had any friends at school or in the neighbourhood. When we put her in any sorts of sportsclass, she eventually quit and said that she hated it. Hated them. 

Madeline doesn't look like us for the slightest of bit. We both have light brown hair, and Jude has hazel eyes while I have blue eyes. We both are pretty tan. But Madeline is very pale, black hair and one of the darkest eyes I've ever seen. She's also very slim and tall. 
We arrived at the grocerystore, when we heard my phone buzzing. My wife looked at my phone.
"Stan, Madeline sent us a message." She said, as she gave my phone to me. 
The message read:
"I accidentally cut my finger. But don't worry Stan."
I panicking a bit. She cut her finger? I asked my wife what to say. 
"Let her sent a picture of the wound. Then I can give her some instructions if she wants."
My wife is a nurse, so she is pretty good in these cases.
I messaged Madeline what my wife said. A couple of seconds later, another messaged popped up.

"I accidentally cut my leg. But don't worry Jude."
I let my wife see the message and got a strange feeling. My gut said that there's something terrible going on. I got nervous, and was sweating like crazy. 
But then I felt the most horrible pain in my fingers. 
I screamed and said to Jude that this isn't good while I put my hand on her lap.
"What have you done? I can't see anything." 
I thought I was going nuts. I swear I saw the worst wound I'd ever seen. The pain was still there. "I don't feel so good." My wife said as she grabbed her leg.
My phone buzzed again. I took my phone and looked at the message from Madeline.
"I accidentally hurt my nose. But don't worry Stan."
I screamed. I was so scared.

Jude got my hand. "It is going to be okay." But it wasn't. My nose was hurting. Hurting from the needles I felt poking in my nose. It felt like hours but it only lasted a minute. After the minute, nothing was there to see. I grabbed my phone and messaged Madeline. 
"I don't know what you're doing, but stop with it immediately." I looked at my wife while she was tearing up. "We have to go home." I nodded, and started the car. At the highway, my phone buzzed again. 
"I accidentally hurt my head. But don't worry Jude."
She cursed as she was grabbing onto her head. "I... My brain... They're..." She tried to say something, but in the middle of her sentence she collapsed. I said every single curse word that I could think of. I took my phone and tried to call Madeline. She didn't answer. I was speeding while looking at the lifeless body of my wife. I was sweating, untill the phone buzzed. 

"I accidentally crashed my car. But don't worry Stan."
I was flabbergasted and didn't know what to do. I couldn't get a reaction out of me. For some reason, nothing was really happening. I was still driving home with the body of Jude. Madeline deserved something really bad. I was driving, until I couldn't brake. I tried, I was going 75mph in a neighbourhood. I avoided every single obstacle, and survived. Then, for some reason, I could brake again. I survived my daughter's message. 
I arrived home. I ran to the door and unlocked it. 

"Madeline?! Where are you?!" It was quiet in my house. Way to quiet. We always had some background noise. White noise. 
I ran upstairs to Madeline her room. I saw her, sitting on her bed. Lifeless. "Madeline?" I said, when my phone buzzed. I got my phone and was terrified. It was from Madeline.
"I accidentally killed my husband. But don't worry Jude."
