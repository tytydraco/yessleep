Me and the crew have noticed something. A day after Cidnee’s funeral it was there again. The shape. This time, it wasn’t just I who saw it. One of Ngozi’s techs, Lumis saw it. At seeing it again he screamed and collapsed to the floor in a fetal position, crying and screaming, kicking his feet as if he tripped and was trying pathetically to crawl away from whatever danger he perceived. Immediately he was restrained and taken to the clinic where Dr. Singh had diagnosed him with acute adrenal fatigue. Talking with the doctor she mentioned that his blood test indicated extremely high levels of Epinephrine, only seen during the likes of a psychosis or fight or flight response.    

What bothers me most is how we both saw it, but he was the only one afflicted by seeing it. Why wasn’t I on the ground with him? Was this episode unrelated? It couldn’t have been because Lumis’s medical records showed no history of psychosis or disorder causing that response. Despite sedatives being administered, Lumis’s heart rate still sits at an alarming 202 bpm. The other techs have complained to Anderson that Lumis can be heard screaming from the clinic during quiet hours, and despite him being restrained via soft wrist restraints Freddy our security officer keeps catching him attempting suicide with whatever sharp object he can find.

I’ll still see the shape every so often. Sometimes I’ll be working at my office completing incident reports and see it outside my window. Not moving. Pitch black. It’s form changing every time I start to make sense of it. Whatever this thing is, one thing for sure is that it’s intentional.

It’s starting to linger, and I’m not the only one to see it anymore. More and more people have started to see it outside the windows. It appears to be matching our speed. Every person to see it gives a different description, but what ties them all together is that it changes shape and that it is pitch black.

Unfortunately, Lumis passed away. It seems with every log another person dies. Lumis died like, three days ago I wanna say? He had a heart attack from his heart rate tiring the muscles in his heart and it giving out. We opted this time to stick him into one of the cryo-chambers to minimize visual exposure of the shape to the crew. It doesn’t matter anyways, the shape has picked a place to linger in view, its most visible now in the research lab in front of the windows. It’s sort of convenient for data collection though. Unfortunately however, every attempt to scan it has brought up an error message which Anderson has never seen before. Which is strange considering he and our sister team back on earth wrote all of the code for the Terror’s systems. It doesn’t matter, I will keep trying every day until something works, I want to know why this is happening.

Two major updates have occurred since my last log. First, Anderson called a meeting for the crew, and we all decided it would be best to put the non-essential crew on ice on April 30th to conserve food and reduce exposure to the shape. Only one tech from each crewmember will stay awake to assist in our journey back to Earth once we reach a safe velocity. I picked Mung for my tech, since he had a background in assembling fusion engines, and could help Mara and her tech, since most of the research is done and over with.

The second major update is that I was able to get one of the outside ship instruments to finally work. The data, which includes a bio-scan and composition test, will take some time to comb through, but I’m confident I can get it fully looked into by the end of tomorrow. Interesting findings so far have been that whatever the shape is made of is elastic, and it has these moving monolithic like protrusions coming from the surface. Of course, you can’t see that just by looking at it but that could explain why it seems to change shape so much.

Oh my god. The shape is unlike anything we have ever seen according to the data. It’s a lot to unpack, but it’s unlike anything humanity has ever seen. Whether or not it’s actually alive is up for interpretation, but it has something of a beating heart, a machine or organ that mechanically moves fluid from one place to another. For what purpose is unknown to me, because this thing doesn’t have what we would compare to nerve fibers. Everything just goes for no explicable reason. As to what this thing’s purpose is, I couldn’t tell you that either. It has no method of consuming, or even digesting matter.

I was wrong last night; I won’t be able to finish this data packet for at least another few days and with every answer comes at least 3 new questions. It’s getting no where and it’s driving me mad.

I’m withdrawing this information from Anderson and the rest, only me and Abel know anything about what the shape is.

Speaking of Abel, he’s been acting very strange recently. Despite the variety of foods the Terror still has to offer, he’s been making the same thing every day as if it’s the only thing he knows how to make. Cooked meat and potatoes. Anderson has been recluse, only coming out of his office to go to his bedroom or to search the storage closet for cigarettes.

Thinking about it now, everyone has been acting strange. These people I’ve known for years are starting to act different, almost opposites of who they are. I never noticed it but ever since Cindee’s funeral everyone has been slowly becoming something else. Maybe I’m just growing paranoid from the circumstances but the motif’s that I once knew in the hustle and bustle of life on the Terror are changed, and the patterns are unfamiliar to me now.

Despite our slowing velocity, the shape lingers at a constant. 2,562 miles away. It’s propulsion and subsequent retardation are still a mystery to me. Sometimes I’ve noticed I’ll be thinking thoughts that aren’t mine. Ideations and words I haven’t approved entering and exiting the inner annals of my mind.

Two days ago, Abel collapsed on the ground hitting his head and injuring his hip in the fall. Upon assessment, Nurse Betty noticed the skin on his right shoulder peeling off and redness and bruising covering a majority of his whole back. That day I went to see him, and he asked me who I was. I was taken aback. “Abel, its me you dumbass who else would it be?” I asked him. “Why are you being so rude to me, who are you, why are you here? Did our father send you? Why are you so red? Why do you not obey?” at this point he had raised his voice. He started to shake violently, and I guess it tore the skin on his back, because he started to bleed profusely. He started to curse at me in French and I left as both the Doctor and Nurse tended to him, vainly trying to sedate and restrain him. I got back to my room and wept into my pillow, struggling to keep my thoughts on a leash.

I’ve started to notice the lack of Anderson’s presence greatly now. Thinking about it now, I haven’t even seen him in close to two days. Mara assures me he is fine, but I don’t think I can trust her. I don’t think I can trust anyone. Why should I, who else is fighting for me? Everyone just always thinks of themselves anymore, and its all because of that stupid fucking-

I was being too loud, and the Log application stopped the recording. I don’t know what happened there. I started feeling angry, then I was overwhelmed with this strange euphoric feeling. I must’ve yelled for at least an hour and a half, because I started recording at around midnight and it’s already 01:30. I need to rest. Tomorrow I’ll Log the conclusions of the data we collected on the shape.

Abel is getting worse and worse and I’m more worried than ever before about him. His fingertips are black, his eyes are bloodshot completely, he’s become jaundice, and he’s swelled up to the point where he resembles the likes of a head of broccoli. He hasn’t spoken since I last saw him according to nurse Betty. Right now, Dr. Singh has him on palliative care because she thinks that there’s no more hope left for him. But what that stupid fucking bitch doesn’t understand is that he’s the only fucking friend I have, and I won’t stand for this bullshit. I think it’s time I march over there and kill-

Did I really say that? Did I really say I wanted to kill Dr. Singh? It says I did right before it cut off but, that can’t be right. I’ve never killed anything in my entire life, nothing that mattered anyway. Like spiders, or a snake that almost bit my mom as a teen, or flies, or an armadillo I ran over on accident before cars hovered. But what separates them from us? Surely their lives don’t mean less than ours? So, what would change if I killed Dr. Singh tonight? It wouldn’t make me a murderer, just like how killing a bug wouldn’t be murder.

Oh my God it’s happening again. My thoughts, I need to control my thoughts. Let me distract myself by talking about my conclusion. After combing through the data, it’s still inconclusive whether or not the shape is alive or inanimate. But what is grounded is its composition. The outer shell is composed of several minerals such as carbon, sulfur, and silicon. What’s shocking is what the layers that sit beneath the surface contain. Several readings of the Bio-scan indicate the presence of DNA molecules. The strange thing however is that they aren’t all the same. They seem to be from different sources, and rather than actually synthesizing these DNA molecules itself, the shape actually contains DNA molecules from earth sources such as frogs, cats, chameleons, and most shockingly, humans. Furthermore, what’s even more shocking, is that found within the outermost sub-surface layer is the DNA of two humans, Geoffry and Cindee.

Hold on, there’s something happening at the Erebus that requires my attention

Abel is dead. As I arrived to the clinic, Dr. Singh and Nurse Betty were nowhere to be found, and poor Abel’s corpse laid bare on the surgical bed. A long laceration ran from the middle of his head to the crotch area and his viscera hung from the sides like a gallows. Frantically I checked every nook and every cranny for, well, anyone. But there was no one.

Behind me the air was cool but reeked with decay. I had calmed down slightly, and I went to examine what remained of my best friend.

His eyes were popped from their sockets and hung bilaterally off the sides of his face as if they couldn’t hold back what had filled up inside him. Looking along the laceration I noticed that his vertebrae and ribcage were missing. Really all of his bones had were missing, except for the hyoid bone which protruded from the left side of his neck. Abel, mon ami, what happened to you. His skin had bruises everywhere, but the darkest of the bruises were along the long and jagged laceration which exposed an empty cavity down his midline. This wasn’t a cut. This was a tear.

I could hear things all around me. All of which I knew weren’t real. I couldn’t convince my brain otherwise. There was one sound that I could tell was real beyond a reasonable doubt. Long and shallow breaths were being picked up by my ears behind me and as I turned to acknowledge what this information meant I immediately was hit with the stench of decay and rot. It was the shape of Abel.

He muttered to me “I chose to obey. Now so shall you.” I could see his exposed trachea expand and contract as he repeated the phrase over and over, each word pounding on the walls I built to protect my mind. He inched closer to me, each step taking longer than the last, as if he were fighting to move, or trying to overcome a great pain.

I just stood there in complete and total shock. I didn’t know what to do. Every step he took became louder and louder, and my thoughts rushed as to what I should do, but they were not received. That was before the Id took over, and in a panic, I threw the object closest to me, which happened to be a steel wash basin. It connected with the shape’s ribcage and caused it to stumble. This only seemed to enrage the shape as its gait became faster as its zombie walk pace turned to an intentional one with each step becoming faster. I ran to the door and turned a corner. I needed a weapon and fast.

There are no readily available weapons on the Terror or Erebus, with the only viable ones being in the security office which was at the end of the cryo-pod bay. I ran as fast as I could to the end of that long dim hallway. As I ran I could see the faces of the techs that were frozen, behind blue tinted glass, periodically hidden behind a veil of white frozen gas shooting out of overflow valves. They were not scared. They sat there and watched. And part of me hated them for it. I wanted to suddenly wake them all up and watch them liquify for their apathy to my plight. I ran feeling more and more anger with every step I took. This was no longer a mission for survival, but a crusade of malice fueled justice. Justice for me. Justice for Abel.

I reached the security office and with no trace of Freddy, I think he was one of the non-essentials. I fumbled my master-key out of my pocket to unlock the display case which housed a standard issue 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun and as soon as it touched my hands, I loaded it and ran back down the hallway. When I rounded the corner into the cafeteria that’s when I saw the shape. I set my aim to center-mass and pulled the trigger. It let out a howl that I could not only hear through my ears, but also throughout every corner of my mind. I fired and fired until there were no shells left in the magazine, and by that time the shape had collapsed. I sat next to the mutilated corpse of my poor friend. And I wept.

After a couple moments, several members of the crew walked in, shocked by the grizzly sight of Abel’s cadaver. Mara comforted me with a kiss on the cheek and a long hug that I wish so desperately I was still engaged with. Anderson threw up upon examining Abel and shakingly pulled out a cigarette and a lighter. His hands were skinny and gaunt. Turned yellow and black by the repeated almost non-stop use of the cigarettes. After coughing, Anderson asked “what happened here.” “I was paged by Nurse Betty,” I replied, “and when I arrived no one was there but this- thing. I was able to escape the clinic and ran to the security office and ran back here and put it down.” “This is a disaster. What are we going to do Troy.” Anderson asked sitting down in one of the cafeteria chairs. He really has lost a lot of weight, previously being an absolute unit at the start of this mission. What used to be a tall and muscular man now was a hunched over, gaunt, and uncanny figure.

But What do we do. Do we go deeper into space? Do we cryo-sleep until humanity advances enough to find us deep into space? What if we are never found? What if we aren’t meant to be found? I didn’t know how to answer Anderson’s question, and I still don’t know. Where do we go from here?

It has been months. The shape, lingers. I haven’t had a good night sleep since God knows how long. I don’t think I can after everything. AND IT’S ALL ANDERSONS GODDAMN FAULT. A couple days after Abel’s death, it didn’t last long for things to fall apart. Ngozi disappeared and her tech disappeared, until I saw them floating just outside the ship in the direction of the shape. Mara was doing maintenance on the fusion engine when a slip of the hand sent 16MW through her body, effectively killing her before she could even know she died. Anderson wasted away in his office. I walked in just last month to find him dead in his chair. A collection of skin, bones, and dust. He probably died weeks before I walked in. All the others either went into cryo-sleep or gave themselves up to the shape.

I am what remains. A rift in this- thing’s record of obedience. I won’t give myself up to a God that hates me. And that’s what I think this thing is. A God. A God in disguise. A God we have been worshipping for thousands of years under many different names. This is the Christian God. This is the Islamic God. This is all gods. But this god is not angry. This god is not forgiving. This god is hungry. But I WON’T GIVE MYSELF TO YOU! YOU HEAR ME YOU MOTHERFUCK-

These logs were recovered as well as the Terror’s research reports. A team of five UASA space force members cleared each room of the vessel including the cargo hold. The team confirmed Tattershall’s reports of the fates of the original five members of the crew as well as the fates of the technicians hired to assist the project. Tattershall himself was found in a pod marked for an Abel Truleaux, with an internal body temperature of -246.3°C. Blood stains were found all over the walls of the clinic and cafeteria. Two bodies were discovered in the men’s bathroom area of the clinic, both confirmed to be a Dr. Akanksha Singh D.O and Betty Øldegard R.N B.S.N. Both bodies had been badly beaten with bruises visible up and down their bodies. Dr. Singh’s body had multiple lacerations on her face and arms, and was found to be missing three fingers. Mrs. Øldegard’s body was found to have sustained a large laceration to her lower abdomen with herniated small bowel out of the open wound. Øldegard was established cause of death is exsanguination, and Singh was established to have died of a brain hemorrhage cause by blunt force trauma to the head. Both bodies were found on top of each other in the farthest stall from the door.     

The FBI has concluded that what happened on The Terror and Erebus was a tragic accident resulting from the poor decisions of the project leader Daniel Anderson, and an unknown entity that followed the spacecrafts over 500,000,000 miles away. This entity was reported to have not been seen in the general 5,000-mile perimeter surrounding the space craft. However, obscure digital photos taken by Tattershall of the entity confirm its existence. All future off earth travel is to be monitored and warned of the dangers of the shape.
