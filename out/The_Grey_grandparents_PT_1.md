Hi, my name is Emerald, and this is my story. This all happened about a year ago.

One day I was up in bed scrolling on TikTok and I stumbled across this livestream of a guy exploring an abandoned farm. As he passed by the barn, I immediately recognized that this is my dead grandparents' place.

I keep watching the stream and as he come inside the house i spot three pictures hanging on the wall that weren't there before. Old black and white photos of what looked like my grandparents wedding day. And one of me and my sister Poppy also in black and white which couldn't be possible because it was a very new photo of me and her take maybe a few days ago.

And Poppy is only 14 and I'm only 16 so this can't be possible. As the stream continues, they walk into my grandparents' room, and I scream out "DONT GO IN THERE." at my phone.

Standing right in front of the streamer are my grandparents ghosts eyeless, cut all over, and burned in some places. They chase the streamer for a few minutes and then the stream goes black.

I try looking up the guy on TikTok. I type into the search bar his user azzxy. Nothing shows up. I call Poppy and say, "I'm coming to pick you up from Jonothan's place we need to go to granny and grandpas farm." Poppy says, "Wait what happened?" I say, "I'll explain on the way."

After 20 minutes of driving, I get to Johnathan's place and pick up Poppy on the drive I recap the events that happened that night.

Poppy says, "We have one last thing to make their souls rest." I complete her sentence by saying "Preforming an exorcism." Poppy says "We've tried cutting them, taking out their eyes, even holy water. This is the last resort and I thought we would never use it." I say, "Well looks like we are."

As we pulled into the place the air seemed.... colder and heavier somehow. But I just shook my head saying to myself that once we exorcise our grandparents it will be back to normal. Oh, how I was wrong. As me and Poppy dig up the graves, I remembered the time we brought a medium in and how at the gate she turned around and said "There is an extremely dark presence here. I won't go any further." When the graves were fully dug up the exorcist had pulled into the place. He said, "Let's rest these souls once and for all shall we, Girls?" Poppy and I replied in unison "Yes, Sir we would like these souls to finally rest." When the exorcism was over the air seemed a small amount warmer and a little less heavy.

On the drive home Poppy asked me "Em is it gonna be alright?" In a shaky voice I say, "I think so Poppy." As we drove home, I didn't see a stop sign and we almost had a crash. When that was happening, I saw two ghosts. Our grandparents. I had thought we got rid of them once and for all, as their voids for eyes stared straight into my soul, I felt true fear. The kind that raises the hairs on your neck, slows down time, and makes you feel so helpless that you just freeze up. But as I was about to crash into the semi something pulled me out of the trance, they had put me into and I swerved just in time, Saving me and Poppy from death that night. But it wasn't quite over yet, as the paranormal events have kept happening. I will post more updates as this story goes along but for now, stay safe and stay away from Wyoming at all costs, as the Grey Grandparents might come along and ruin your life.
