Emerald's pov:

One day I was up in bed scrolling on TikTok and I stumbled across this livestream of a guy exploring an abandoned farm. As he passed by the barn, I immediately recognized that this is my dead grandparents' place.

I keep watching the stream and as he come inside the house i spot three pictures hanging on the wall that weren't there before. Old black and white photos of what looked like my grandparents wedding day. And one of me and my sister Poppy also in black and white which couldn't be possible because it was a very new photo of me and her take maybe a few days ago.

And Poppy is only 14 and I'm only 16 so this can't be possible. As the stream continues, they walk into my grandparents' room, and I scream out "DONT GO IN THERE." at my phone.

Standing right in front of the streamer are my grandparents ghosts eyeless, cut all over, and burned in some places. They chase the streamer for a few minutes and then the stream goes black.

I try looking up the guy on TikTok. I type into the search bar his user azzxy. Nothing shows up. I call Poppy and say, "I'm coming to pick you up from Jonothan's place we need to go to granny and grandpas farm." Poppy says, "Wait what happened?" I say, "I'll explain on the way."

After 20 minutes of driving, I get to Johnathan's place and pick up Poppy on the drive I recap the events that happened that night.

Poppy says, "We have one last thing to make their souls rest." I complete her sentence by saying "Preforming an exorcism." Poppy says "We've tried cutting them, taking out their eyes, even holy water. This is the last resort and I thought we would never use it." I say, "Well looks like we are."

Poppy's pov:

I was chilling at my friend Johnathan's place when my sister Emerald called and told me to get my things and leave. At first, I found it quite strange she wanted me to leave, but as we drove, she told me what happened, and I was horrified. I had thought the last time me and Em went out there was the last but turns out it's not. When we got to the farm, I asked Em "Do we have what we need?" and she responded with "Yes." A simple one-word answer. That scared me. As we dug up the graves and waited on the exorcist, I remembered the time we brought a medium in, to assess the situation. When we got to the gate the medium said, "I'm not going any further I'm sorry. There is too much energy here and it's not good." Which confirmed me and Em's suspicions that our grandparents went over to the dark side. The exorcist came to the lace just as we finished digging up the graves. The pastor said, "Perfect girls let's get this over with, shall we?" As the pastor exorcised our grandparents something about the whole place changed it was a bit less dark somehow...
