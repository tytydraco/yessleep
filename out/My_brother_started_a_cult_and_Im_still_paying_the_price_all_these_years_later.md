Growing up there wasn’t anything my brother couldn’t talk his way out of. Detention, speeding tickets, fights. No matter what, he always found a way to talk himself out of trouble. I thought he was invincible - like there wasn’t anything he couldn’t scheme his way into or out of.   
  
So naturally, I was surprised when the police found his body.  
  
His body had been mummified, decorated and held in a position of high honor in a small A-Frame cabin deep in the wilderness that operated as a shrine to his life and teachings as leader of the “Green Soul Circle” a small cult that he started years ago.   
  
A hunter was the one who found him, he had sprained his ankle and hobbled to the A-frame in order to ask for help, but instead found my brother, or what was left of him.   
  
I shouldn’t laugh but I imagine the poor guy forgot about his ankle pretty quickly after that.   
  
After the shrine was investigated by the police, they transferred to me control of my brother’s body as well as a small cache of his personal belongings that had also been found within the shrine.   
  
I didn’t want anything to do with any of it. As far as I was concerned Glenn stopped being a member of my family a decade ago. My parents and I tried hundreds of times to talk some sense into him, to let him drop all the hippie cult bullshit and come home to start over, but all we ever got in return was misery.   
  
He’d call us names, mock us and laugh in our faces as we pleaded through tears for him to come home. How many times could you go through that before you sever ties with the person? I decided I had enough when he hung up on our mother after she told him she had terminal cancer.   
  
Dad had passed away years before in a car accident and Glenn never showed up for the funeral, but their relationship had always been rocky. With mom, I thought it would be different and I couldn’t have been more wrong. He shamed her for her diagnosis, told her it was the culmination of all the shitty lifestyle choices she’d made, then he hung up.   
  
My mom died 6 months later without hearing from him again. I never attempted to contact him once she died. I also changed my phone number so even if he wanted to call, he wouldn’t be able to reach me. In my mind, he might as well have died the same night as my mother.  
  
So, imagine my surprise when suddenly I’m placed in charge of that asshole’s mummified corpse.  
  
In addition to all of that, here is another cherry on top of the shit sundae – I was pregnant at the time. About 6 months into it to be more specfic. You want some sprinkles for that sundae? I was single. Mommy’s little miracle is the result of a one-night stand.   
  
I don’t want to sound like I was resentful of my unborn baby. I love him (Yes, it’s a boy!) and I could not wait to welcome him into the world, I just cannot emphasize enough how stressed out I was.   
  
So back to the body… I didn’t think he deserved a memorial or a service, so I cremated him and threw his ashes in the river. Easy as pie. No muss no fuss.  
  
The box of my brother’s belongings, curiously, wasn’t as easy to toss out. Sure, most of it immediately went into the trash – old clothes, a dirty water bottle and some ratty books with titles like, “The Metaphysical and You” and “Awaken: 30 Exercises to Open Your Third Eye”. All that stuff was easy to throw away, but some things I kept.   


There was a really nice dreamcatcher I thought was cute, a large collection of crystals and geodes and my brother’s journal. Those stayed with me.   
  
Just to be clear – I’m not some crystal-kissing Walmart wiccan who thinks crystals produce healing energies or anything like that. I just thought they were pretty. I know this seems like a weird thing to mention, but if you’re like me and your older brother ran a cult for nearly 15 years, you’d probably want to make that distinction too.   
  
The journal on the other hand stayed because I was curious. Despite knowing my brother my entire life, I’d never really known him. He was 5 years older than me, which isn’t that much in the adult world, but when you are a kid, 5 years is a lifetime. We operated in separate worlds and ran in different circles. By the time I grew to the age of independence he’d already moved upstate to start his commune and the little connection I had with him made me not want to know him.   
  
It’s a weird feeling, knowing someone your entire life and truly considering them a stranger, especially when you’re made out of the same stuff. What if we were more alike than I’d ever known?   
  
Despite my curiosity, I couldn’t open the journal for a few days after I had received it; it made me too angry.   
  
When I finally did pick up the journal to read it, I found the same smug dickhead I remembered:   
  
*Have you ever been on the internet? Ever turned on the TV? Ever listened to your friend’s crazy uncle proudly shoot off Fox News talking points like he’s the captain of the debate team? There’s money to be made in these hills!*   
  
*The more I talk to people the more I see they just want something to believe in, a shoulder to cry on, a crutch. They don’t want to think. They want to be told.*   
  
*It doesn’t even have to be real; it just has to make them feel good.*  
  
*Magic rocks that pull the ache right out of your head. A candle that settles dissonant vibrations. Call cucumber water ‘a beverage that promotes a healthy lifestyle’ and they will drive for miles to buy it.*   
  
*Create a common enemy. What really is in that vaccine? Did you know doctors use cells from aborted fetuses? The hospital is a waiting room for Death.*   
  
*There is money to be made in these hills.*   
  
That’s the parasitic, cynical asshole I remember.   
  
I was debating whether to put the journal down or keep reading when there was a knock on the door.   
I opened it to find a delivery man.   
  
“Are you Candace?”, the man asked.   
  
I nodded.   
  
“Delivery for you,” the post man said holding out a clipboard and a pen, “I need you to sign for it.”   
  
I complied and the man handed over a small cardboard box about the size of my palm.   
  
I took the box into my kitchen and used a knife to open it.   
  
Inside, nestled in a bed of hay, was a smooth river rock. Painted onto one side of the rock was a bear, shaggy and brown with a crown on its head. Painted on the reverse was a single word, Hibernation.   
  
I assumed it was left over evidence from my brother’s shrine and the police had forgotten to toss it in with the others. I dropped the rock in the trash and carried on with my day.   
  
I didn’t pickup the journal for another few days. Work had been hell and being pregnant wasn’t getting any easier. I was tired and hungry all the time. I was starting to show and the excess weight was starting to make my back hurt.   
  
I suppose you probably have questions about my pregnancy, with it being such a scandal and all.   
  
I was in a dark place. Life was kicking my ass. Work sucked. My friends seemed to be losing interest in me and I was losing interest in them. I started isolating, spending hours alone thinking about mistakes I made and opportunities I’d squandered. Then I started to drink.  
  
For a while I became a regular at a bar downtown. A divey sort of place where a depressed girl like me can get a few drinks without running into someone I’d know. I became acquaintances there with a few other barflies, but mostly we kept to ourselves. Isolation was why most of us were there in the first place. Except for one guy, Matt.  
  
Matt showed up there shortly after I did. He was new to the city and had just moved in down the street. He was sweet, friendly and could talk to anyone about anything. He had long brown hair and 5’oclock shadow that accentuated his jawline and had arms like a shaved gorilla and because I was generally the only girl in that bar on any given night, he started to pursue me. I put up my walls for the first few weeks, but as I spiraled and he kept building me up, eventually I caved and we went back to his place.   
  
I left quickly as soon as the sun rose and I didn’t go back to the bar for a month out of shame. It was around the end of that month I realized I was pregnant. Thinking back, I’m surprised I didn’t start to spiral further, instead I got tough. I decided I’d quit drinking, I’d keep the baby, and that Matt would never know. I started to live for someone else instead of just living for myself, and that saved my life.   
  
I used to like to imagine Matt still showed up there every night and waited for me. He sits in a dark booth in the corner of the room, and only lifts his head to see who’s walking through the door of the bar. It’s always another biker. A tear rolls down his cheek.   
  
Eventually I found the time, energy and willpower to pick the journal back up.   


It seemed like Glenn tried lots of different ideas before he found one that worked for him. He went Q-anon for a while but found it too decentralized. He tried to form another Right-Wing organization called “Liberty Union” but found he just attracted a bunch of gun-nuts and doomsday preppers. Then he went back to the original ideas he had in his first journal entry and started the hippie commune, the Green Soul Circle.   
  
*We got 20 or so people up with us now. Once I got 3 or 4 people up here it just started to snowball fast.*  


 *I’ve got people on twitch, youtube and instagram. We’re doing podcasts and morning shows daily. We’re selling product and hauling in donations like you wouldn’t believe.*   
  
*Candles are on backorder. Sage is selling well (profit margin on that is insane) and the crystals are flying off the shelves. No one would believe me if I told them how much money I was making. I can hardly believe it myself.*   
  
*The only downside is living up here with these people.*   


*I tell them I need to be alone for 4 hours a day for mediation, but that is just about the only time I can get to myself. They hound me constantly. Asking for advice, spiritual cleansings, energy readings. I don’t even know what half those words mean, but I grin and bear it. I give them an answer, generally some bullshit I read somewhere and it makes them happy.*   
  
*They work for room and board and a few bowls of quinoa, so I guess I shouldn’t be complaining that much.*   
  
Yup, Glenn is still an asshole, huge surprise.   
  
Another knock on my door disturbed my reading. This time it was a pizza delivery man.   
  
“I didn’t order a pizza,” I said before the man could even utter a word, “I think you have the wrong address.”   
  
“This is an order for Candace?”, he replied before reciting my address.   
  
“Yeah, that is my name and address, but I didn’t order a pizza”   
  
“Well, you need to pay for the pizza or it comes out of my check”   
  
“Get whoever ordered it to pay for it”   
  
“You ordered it”   
  
This had to be the dumbest conversation of my life. I must have stood on my front porch yelling at the pizza man for 15 minutes. It only ended because my neighbor Tom, a sweet 60-year-old widower, heard the yelling and came out and offered to take the pizza himself.  
  
I sat back down on the couch and picked up reading where I left off. Glenn at this point had taken to calling himself, and having his followers call him, Brother Bear, which is an incredibly stupid name. Although I do suppose if you were some hippie influencer, you’d probably have an easier time selling candles as Brother Bear than Glenn which sounds like a middle manager at an accounting firm. John Glenn, Glenn Beck, Glenn Close, there aren’t too many well-known Glenns that fit the image of “Earth Healer.”   
  
I passed another hour reading of Brother Bear and his infinite money machine when the passages started to get dark.   
  
*They’ll do anything I tell them to. Anything. Worm annoyed me so much I made him spend the night out in the rain, but he won’t leave. I emptied his bank accounts, I fucked his wife, I gave him the name WORM and he still won’t leave. If anything, he’s my most loyal follower.*  
  
*I think I underestimated how blindly loyal people can be once they’ve found a place that accepts them.*    
*As much fun as it is to have a community in thrall to me, I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life, shit, I’ll probably be able to retire to an island in a few years if we keep going at this rate.*   
  
*I told them we need to plan my succession. What I meant was, in a few years, I’ll go live in a mansion somewhere while Wolf or someone else takes over day-to-day operations and I’ll finally get some peace and quiet.*   
  
*How they interpreted that is that I need an heir. I can barely get out of bed before one of these bimbos jump on my dick saying they want to be the vessel that carries the next messiah.*   
  
*Jokes on them. I’m infertile. I got a vasectomy at 24 because I never wanted to have kids.*   
  
*This will be easy enough to turn on them in the end, so I’ll keep it going for now. Maybe I’ll even let Worm watch.*   
  
I could not believe I was related to this person. We grew up in the same house, ate the same foods, went to the same schools, but Glenn somewhere along the line turned sour. My skin rippled with disgust, then a second ripple of goosebumps rode a wave down my arm. I felt a cold breeze fill the house.   
  
I got up from the couch to find the back door to my house wide open. Thinking the wind must have blown it open I closed it and went to bed.   
  
The next morning, I woke up, more tired than usual. Pregnancy sucks. Constantly uncomfortable. Never sleeping, always tired, hips hurt, back hurts. Misery. I’m not sure how all those ladies on TV say they loved being pregnant.  
  
I gingerly take the stairs to the kitchen and open the fridge to start making some eggs for breakfast. I only notice when I have the eggs on the counter that they aren’t the Grade A white eggs that I bought. They are brown, like they just came from a farm.   
  
At the time I didn’t make the connection, I was still groggy and had a headache and honestly as soon as I saw the eggs, I instantly lost my appetite. Food aversion is probably the worst part of being pregnant.   
  
I poured myself a glass of orange juice and headed to the bathroom for a Tylenol and some vitamins only to open my medicine cabinet and find it completely empty. Someone had removed every single prescription and over-the-counter drug from my house.   
  
I felt like I was losing my mind.   
  
Instantly I started roaming the house looking for traces of a home invasion. Room to room I marched taking a mental picture at each doorway and searching my hormone-riddled brain for what may or may not have been there the day before.   
  
Some strange things were missing, lots of chemical cleaners and aerosol cans. My soaps and shampoos were replaced with some weird ‘all-natural’ brand. I found 2 bottles of kombucha in my refrigerator. The power cord to my microwave was severed and there was a strange amount of granola in my pantry.   
  
What the fuck kind of home invasion was this? I immediately called the police.   
  
While I waited the 15 minutes for the police, I read some of Glenn’s journal:   
  
*I feel like shit today.* 

*I’ve felt like shit for a month.*  
 *I can’t be seen on the livestreams selling health products while I look like this. I’ve got boils on my back and chest. My feet feel numb. Maybe I just need to lay off the booze for a little while.*   
  
*I’ll try and stay sober until Wolf comes back. It shouldn’t be longer than a month for him to finish his job.*   
  
Officer O’Hare, the same officer who dropped off the box of Glenn’s belongings showed up at my door and immediately did a walk through of the property to confirm we were alone. He found two different windows unlocked on the ground floor as well as several footprints in the mud outside my house.   
  
“It’s your brother’s friends,” He said, “I’m sure of it.”   
  
I shuddered at the thought of a lunatic named Worm tip-toeing through my house as I slept, “How could they have found me?” I asked.  
  
“I’m not sure,” he shook his head, “Have you spoken with anyone out of your normal circle of friends and work colleagues recently?”  
  
I thought, “Not that I can think of…” I trailed off, “I signed for a package. And I had a weird incident with a pizza delivery guy.”   
  
“Explain”   
  
I told Officer O’Hare about the rock that was mailed to me, as well as the incident with the unpaid pizza and as soon as I finished, he went out to his car made a few calls before coming back inside.   
  
“You shouldn’t have signed for that package,” He said, “They probably tracked the box here, then mailed that rock here using a Certified Letter, once you signed for it, they received a receipt with your signature on it confirming your location.”   
  
“Fuck”, I stewed in the silence for a beat, thinking, “And the pizza delivery was just a distraction to get in through the back door, wasn’t it?”  
  
“Just long enough to unlock a couple of windows, by the way, you should make sure none of your keys were stolen, if so, you need to change your locks.”   
  
My keys were missing.  
  
After I had filed the police report Officer O’Hare gave me directions to a nearby motel where I could spend the night, he also told me he’d be emailing some pictures of Glenn’s known associates and I should call him immediately should I see any of them.   
  
I packed my things and went to the motel immediately; I couldn’t stand the thought of being in that house.   
  
I sat in the motel and watched TV for an hour or so, but I couldn’t shake the thoughts of The Green Soul Circle out of my mind. Why on Earth would they want anything to do with me? I’d never even met any of them in my entire life.   
  
I opened Glenn’s journal again looking for answers:   
  
*I’m trapped in a prison of my own making. I’ve killed myself. My kidneys are failing. I can hardly stand my feet are so swollen. I’m scratching my arms so much they’ve gone raw and drip with blood.*   
  
*I’ve begged them all to let me go to the hospital but they all say the same thing – “You’re testing us. We know you’d never want to go to a hospital. A Hospital is waiting room for death.”*   
  
*I try to crawl out of bed but my body is so heavy and I’m too weak to fight them off as they drag me back to my room.*   
  
*They just give me more and more kombucha and I keep pissing more and more blood.*   
  
*I tell them its all fake. I tell them I made it all up. I’m not Brother Bear. My name is Glenn. I’m not the messiah, I’m a con man.*   
  
*I eat McDonald’s.*   
  
*You’re testing us.*   
  
*You’re testing us.*   
  
*I dug too deep and I’m going to die here.*   
  
*What have I done?*   
  
I’ve hated my brother for nearly 15 years. I still hate him and I’ll never forgive him for everything he’s done to my family, but I couldn’t help but feel sad for him for a moment. What a horrific way to die. A slow agonizing death, with help so close and readily available but being unable to get there.   
  
*This is it, its coming. I haven’t eaten in days. I’m sorry mom. I know how you felt as your body broke down around you. Its like being trapped in a burning house, isn’t it? I should have called you more, fuck I should have been home. I’m sorry.*   
  
*I’m sorry dad, I know we never got along and that isn’t entirely my fault, but I could have made a better effort. You won’t believe me, but I was sorry to see you go. I wanted to go to your funeral, but something in me is broken.*   
  
*Candace. I hope this journal makes it way to you. The freaks I live with won’t read it; I told them their heads would explode if they saw its pages haha! I need to apologize to you most of all. What I’ve done to you is unforgivable and you aren’t even aware of it.*   
  
*If you read up to this point, you probably read the issue I had with my ‘succession.’ I never should have brought that up. I’m so fucking stupid.*   
  
*“Only those with my blood could bring forth the messiah”*   
  
*That’s all I said. I didn’t mean for it to get misinterpreted, but what is religion except the blind leading the blind.*   
  
*They are coming for you, all of them.*   
  
*I’m sorry.*   
  
*I love you.*   
  
*Stay away from Wolf.*   
  
I could feel the blood drain from my face as I read the passage. Too angry to cry, too sad to scream and too scared to move. I sat there staring unblinking at the page trying process years of trauma, regret and pure unadulterated rage.   
  
It was only when the silence was broken by my phone chiming that I realized I had forgotten to breathe.   
  
I took a few deep breathes to steady myself then opened the email from Officer O’Hare.   
  
*Here’s a collection of photos of known members of the Green Soul Circle if you see any of them, call me* ***immediately****.*  
  
I clicked on the attachment and nearly vomited at the sight of the first picture.   
  
A man with long brown hair and thin 5 o’clock shadow that accentuated his jawline, a solid neck with thick shoulders and arms like a shaved gorilla. It was Matt. The father of my child.   
  
Directly under the picture in bold letters was the word: **WOLF**  
  
I called Officer O’Hare.   
  
We never found Matt or Worm or Cicada or Fisher. None of the Green Soul Circle members were ever arrested, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t keep moving.   
  
I moved from town to town, job to job. Always afraid and always looking over my shoulder and looking after my son, Jack, who is now in his terrible twos and will never know who his father is.   
  
I love my son, but the stress does get to me sometimes. Especially those late nights when the rest of the world is asleep, but I’m still awake and looking out my window at the nondescript sedan that has been parked in front of my house for 3 hours. There’s always two men in the front seats, but they don’t get out, they just watch and eventually, they will drive away.   
  
Sometimes the stress gets to me, but I just say to myself, “Only those with my blood could bring forth the messiah”  
  
I don’t sign for packages anymore.
