A mother cradled her sleeping infant son in her ebony arms, tears rolling slowly down her face, landing softly into the infant's face and covered body as she held him close to her. She glanced down at the peacefully sleeping infant before looking over the rails of the bridge she stood at as she rocked her baby, willing the child not to stir. She battled if what she was about to do was wrong in her heart and mind when it just felt so right.



 She was a black woman who gave birth to an albino baby with freckled pale brown skin, curly sandy blonde hair, and almost bloodshot-looking baby blue eyes. Even her husband had been against keeping the baby from the very beginning. So, in the end, he gave her two choices: dispose of the baby or leave his house.   However, even before her husband gave her such decisions, she had already decided what she wanted to do herself.



 'Who would ever want such a strange child in a world like this, Liam?' The woman thought to herself, looking down at the infant. 'No one...not even me.' 



As that thought crossed her mind, she tossed the still-sleeping baby off the bridge and turned her back before the now-screaming infant hit the water. Hearing the sound of a loud splash and the silence that shortly followed. Silently, she got into her car and drove away while wiping away what was left of her tears. After she left, a figure levitated over the body while its corpse floated down the river bank before reaching down, scooping its tiny soul out from the body. 



"Poor child. Not even given a proper chance to live... tossed away like common garbage. How despicable.... how.... dreadfully wasteful...." The figure whispered before soft chattering came from its maw while the corpse continued to float down the river, all but a forgotten husk. 



' Ma...ma...' The soul of the baby whimpered, squirming lightly. 



"Your mother, Jane, threw you away..." The figure continued, cradling the baby's soul in its arms. 



The figure soon walked out of the dark to reveal his form. He was a man in the general sense of the word; to many, he looked no different than a crazy homeless man with a thin, frail body, a long white beard, and knotted hair that stretched to his hips. His brown eyes looked up at the bridge with a long grin that should not have been humanly possible before his eyes slowly focused on the baby's soul resting silently within his grasp. 



"Do not worry, child. You will have a chance to get your revenge." The man said his now-tanned skin was visible in the street lamp's light. 



A pure white robe draped over his body billowed around him, appearing oddly aged. This gave the strange man an almost ancient feeling that should any passerby catch his gaze; they would feel nearly as if they were face to face with death himself. 



"And in turn... I will gain some entertainment." Z whispered with a chuckle.



A mangled mash of crimson and white caught his eye, reminding him of the slight mess he had created before plucking the child's soul from his body. Looking over his shoulder, he looked over the corpse of a twisted and torn angel on the ground behind him with its divine spear snapped in half, the head of it jammed into what was once the angel's torso. Its wings had almost been ripped to shreds with clean tears through the bloody stained flesh and feathered mass that lay in pieces around the body as bloodied feathers blew away with the rising wind. It looked as if the poor creature were little more than a baby bird grabbed by a large cat and torn apart. He couldn't help but smile at the memory of the poor fool's attempt to intervene. 



"And nothing in this world or otherwise will stop me," the man said, looking forward as he began to walk away. "Do not worry...Liam... Z will take care of you..."



 \[A week later\]  



Jane lay in bed, sleeping in her husband's two-story house in the suburbs with a big yard. The sound of water dripping on the floor caused Jane to stir from her sleep; groggily, she got up and walked to the bathroom, turning the knob for the sink thinking it was the cause, most likely once again. Once she had done so, the sound fell silent, earning a sigh of relief from Jane before she walked back towards the bed, only to slip as her foot hit something wet, and she fell on her back with a wet squelch and let out a small startled yelp. 



"What the?" Jane questioned as something dripped, landing with a small splatter on her forehead; she quickly got up and struggled to find the nearby light. 



Jane's eyes widened as she clicked the light on before placing her hands over her mouth as she found herself standing in a pool of blood. The woman looked at the puddle of blood she slipped on and looked up only to let out a scream as she found her husband strung up in a giant spider's web with his gut torn out and hanging limply as if something had eaten their way. Seeing her husband's dead eyes, Jane reached for him only to scream as she spotted the bloody handprints on her face and mouth before attempting to run out of the bathroom, only to slip again and fall flat on her face, knocking herself out accidentally. The sound of blood dripping onto the floor continued as Jane's body was dragged off somewhere into the dark.   



\[???\]  



Jane woke up to find she was in a large, blank room. It was so white that it hurt her eyes a little before she saw a giant web beneath her. Although wide, it was not sticky and almost like a regular floor. Seeing the web did not trap her as it had her husband; Jane started to walk off it only to feel a wall as soon as it ended. Her breathing quickened with panic as Jane went to the opposite side, where she was again in the same situation, facing another wall. 



"What's  happening?!" Jane screamed, backing away from the wall. 



Crawling was heard above her. Jane whimpered before slowly looking up to see a giant humanoid spider over her, drool dripping onto her face. The spider's form was similar to an orb weaver, at least three meters in diameter, but all white, like a person with albinism and milky blue eyes. She screamed as the massive spider inched close before its face split open to reveal her baby boy, Liam, staring into her eyes. 



" ...ma...ma?" Liam spoke, slowly tilting his head, sadness in his little blue eyes at his mother's cries of terror.



Jane fell back onto her rear, a look of shock on her face as she stared into his eyes; screams fell into quiet whimpers. 



"Welcome, Jane. Liam's... mama," the old man, known as Z, greeted as he appeared beside her, smiling pleasantly. "To the blank canvas...a place where all that should not be happening...happen. I...am Z."



The words seemed to roll off his tongue with a slight bitterness. Jane turned her head to look at the Z and couldn't help but shutter; he chuckled while shaking his head and waving his hand to dismiss her worry and fear. 



"Please, you do not need to be afraid. After all, this baby is yours, is he not?" Z said before chattering his teeth while laughing. "Even if you threw him off a bridge to his ultimate death..." 



Jane shook her head rapidly, denial on her face, and was about to attempt to explain herself until the man raised his hand, silencing her, a long grin growing on his face. 



"Please, do not waste my time or your son's; after all, he has been very patient for such a small boy," Z commented before another chuckle. "Now. Like your husband, you will play a little game with your son. Win, and you get to live as if nothing has ever happened...lose...and... well... share the same fate as your husband... possibly worse... I'm sure you know how that will end."  



"W-What?" Jane stammered in disbelief.



"All you have to do is get the highest score," Z said, pointing at the center of the web. 



Jane followed him to see a cluster of baby humanoid spiders that looked almost identical to the larger one that resembled her son. 



The spiders begin to crawl out of the middle and along the webbing, quickly filling the space. 



"Simply step on as many spiders as quickly as possible." Z finished explaining with a chatter.



 "W-What's the highest score?" Jane asked in a shaky voice. 



"Good luck. Liam will keep watch on your progress," Z said, ignoring her question as he stepped back, his form fading away into mist, leaving Jane alone to figure out her next move would be to survive her son's game.



Jane slowly got to her feet as tears rolled down. She walked over to one spiderling, causing it to turn and look up at her. It was the exact image of Liam when she threw him down the river, except for the four spider legs coming out of his ribs and fangs protruding from his lips.



"Ma...ma..." The baby asked, tilting his head.



Jane shook her head, and tears rolled down from her eyes onto the ground before she crushed the baby spider with her foot. The sound of the baby spider being crushed and splattered caused the rest to freeze. Liam narrowed his eyes, and the remaining spiderlings began to crawl about uncontrollably, forcing Jane to try and step on others. For the next few minutes, she crushed ten spiderlings before they froze again.



"Time...is... up..." Liam said, his voice echoing throughout the room.



Jane panted before looking up at Liam and collapsed onto her rear.



"Did I do it?" Jane asked, closing her eyes and leaning back.



After a few seconds of silence, Jane opened her eyes to find Liam standing in front of her. Under and around her were the remaining baby spiders, glaring at Jane while chattering their teeth. Slow clapping echoed behind Jane, causing her to turn to see the man from before, sitting on the ground crossed-legged and grinning. Jane stared at the man, seeing his flesh fall to the ground with every clap of his hand.



"Well played... well played indeed," Z complimented before stopping when he had only half his face while the other was nothing but bone. "You have done most excellent."



"Did... I win?" Jane asked, trying to keep her fear in check.



Z tilted his head and chuckled.



"Why not ask... your baby boy?" Z questioned,  nudging his head forward.



Jane turned her head to find Liam's face mere inches away. His mouth opened slightly as Jane froze in fear.



"Ma... ma..." Liam mumbled from his gaping mouth.



"Y-Yes... my baby boy?" Jane asked, putting on a brave face and trying.



"F...F...." Liam stammered as tears rolled down his eyes. 



Jane leaned forward and hugged him.



"I'm so sorry..." Jane said, closing her eyes and hugging her baby boy.



The two remained still as they cried together until her grip tightened for an instant, snapping Liam's neck. Its entire body collapsed to the ground before Jane quickly got up and panted heavily. Laughter came from Z again, followed by clapping, but this time faster.



"How spontaneous!" the man shouted before his clapping was no longer that of flesh but bones hitting one another, and laughter morphed into chattering teeth. 



Jane quickly turned to find the old homeless man was no more than bones. His eyes were replaced with glowing white orbs and a darkness as innards.



"Your husband merely continued to step on the spiderlings and even got fifty-seven of them, but you... only a mere eleven spiderlings... I expected more, but that's what makes things so amusing for me," Z said, tilting his head. "You lost, and now you're going to pay...violently."



"And how is that? I've killed the leader! The babies are frozen! Unless you're going to kill me?" Jane asked, glaring at the living skeleton, which chattered in amusement.



"Dear child. Where is the fun in me taking action? As you said, the other spiderlings are frozen, not because their leader died, but because he wanted to talk to you... and... since you have no means of wanting to talk... to your... baby boy... then he has no reason to do the same..." Z mentioned, chattering again.



Jane froze and looked over her shoulder to see the spiderlings crawling silently towards her. The moment she noticed them, they all rushed the woman and started to tear her apart piece by piece. Her screams echoed yet went unanswered while the skeleton watched in amusement as his flesh began to reform over the bones.



"Well... that's that," He said, getting up and dusting his rear.



\[Tw-Story house\]



Z appeared back in Jane's home with her head on the bed, half of it reduced to nothing but bone, while the rest of the woman's body was nowhere to be found. "Outstanding..." 



With that, he laughed softly while walking into the shadows and fading. A single baby lay beside the head in the home, fast asleep. Its form was no different from that of a normal baby, aside from the blood on its lips and the lower half of its body.



//To be continued...



Now, this is the horror verse I wished to make a very long time ago

To make this interesting...for most of us...I will have a voting system in this verse as well.



Rules:

-No one will die the same way.

-No crime that has already been written can be used again.

-Powers cannot be omnipotent

-Games cannot be the same. (Note: Games can be indoor games on a board or DIY... or outdoor games like tag. Sports and TCG do not count, sadly...sorry)



Other than that! The ball is yours. If there is no vote by the time this story comes around, I will select them myself. If there is a tie vote, I will pick whichever interests me the most.

If you have questions, please ask, and I will answer them to the best of my ability.
