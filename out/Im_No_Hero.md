“Dad, pleaseeee can we go back to lair? I’m not feeling it today.” I pleaded urgently.

He lowers the camera, before scolding me in a hushed tone.

“Cassidy Gracer Patterson! Remember what we talked about! Use our code names. Right now I’m not Dad, I’m Mr.Indestructible. And no, you need the practice. Don’t you want to make Mom and I proud?

I let out a defeated sigh. “Yes dad.” I mumbled. 

“Good. Now get up there and show Dr.Nefario what it means to mess with the worlds best superhero family!”

I rose sluggishly off of the ground, climbing through the air towards the Giant Robot’s obnoxiously large head. 

I scanned the city intersection below me nervously, hoping no-one from school was watching this. I was wearing my mask, but just in case.

“Evil do-ers beware! Aero-Girl is in the air!” I muttered half heartedly.

Gosh, this superhero crap was getting corny. 

It was fun when I was 10 maybe, getting to leave school randomly for “family emergencies” which were really bank robberies or maybe extra flight training from Dad.

But fuck! I’m 17 now. There’s only so many times you can punch people in the face before it gets boring. And don’t get me started on the costumes.

“That’s OK honey, we’ll work on that battle cry later!” Dad screamed from below.

I hovered in the air, in front of the Robot’s giant metal face. It’s eyes were a view-port, made of some glass-like material. I watched Dr.Nefario piloting it as he frantically pushed and pulled on a dashboard of levers on the control panel in front of him.

“How the hell does he even build this crap?” I wondered. 

This things gotta be at least 10 stories tall, and it looks like he barely even knows how to control it. 

What school did he graduate from? Why do we call him Doctor? I know he doesn’t work so how does he even pay for all this crazy shit?

All good questions, all un-important. I wanted to get this over as fast as possible.

I hovered closer to the one of the eye windows, I watched as Dr.Nefario’s eyes widened as I levitated in front of the glass.

“Hi Mr.Nefario…Long time no see. Could you just turn this off and turn yourself in today? Please?”

“MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA” He chortled. “That’s DOCTOR Nefario to you, Foolish Girl! 

“Right…Dr.Nefario, could you just give it a rest, just for today?” I pleaded earnestly.

“MUHAHAHA! Dr.Nefario never bends to the will of lesser advanced beings! I’m more smarter than all of you! My ultimate plan is nearly complete, and soon the world shall know that I, the illustrious Dr.Nefario, have- blah blah blah blah….

I stared at him blankly through the glass as I tuned out his monologue

This shit was getting old. 

We’ve been fighting this guy since I was in Elementary School! 

How many times have we put in jail only for him to break out next month with some new death ray or robot army?

How many people has this idiot hurt someone innocent with his stupid plans? 

What’s the point of having god-like powers if we can’t even stop weaklings like this?

I knew what had to be done.

“…and that’s the FIFTH reason why I, the illustrious Dr.Nefario will soon achieve total world domination. And why your feeble intellect will never-“

I burst through the window, the glass and metal splintering against my touch as I entered the Robot’s head.

Dr.Nefario stood at his control panel, dumbstruck as I levitated above him.

“Cut the shit Nefario.” I said icily.

“This is your last warning. Turn this thing off and hand yourself over to the police.”

He stood there in his lab coat and goggles, visibly confused. This wasn’t something he expected.

He swallowed a thick lump in his throat before straightened his tie and speaking :

“It will take more than harsh language to defeat me, girl.” He sneered.

I watched as he slowly reached into his lab coats pocket, fiddling for something.

I strained my eyes, using my X-Ray vision to see what he was wrapping his hand around - the stock of his 90 Watt Plasma Pistol.

“Don’t.” I warned. 

Not that it could hurt me anyway.

“We’ll see what prevails, girl. Your brawn or MY brain. Take Thi-“ 

I tore through the air towards him, closing the 10 feet between us at sub-sonic speeds.

The next second was a blur. A flash of light, and then, warmth

Mr.Indestructible watched from the street below as the giant Robot head exploded in a flash of dazzling green light, nearly blinding him as he shielded his eyes.

A wall of heat and pressure assailed him, he slid across the ground as the shockwave pushed him from the blast, he fought to stay upright.

Opening his eyes, his face was a mask of horror as flaming debris and chunks of metal rained down onto the street below.

“CASSIDY!” He screamed as the robot’s decapitated body toppled to the ground enveloped in a plume of dark, indigo smoke.

I rose gingerly into the air from the burning wreckage, gently landing in front of my Dad.

“Gosh Cassidy, are you hurt?! He yelled, embracing me in a bear hug.

“You know I’m not dad.” I said rolling my eyes.

“I know, but still.” He said, releasing me.

“What happened in there?!“ Where’s Dr.Nefario, Did he escape again?

I put on my best innocent girl voice.

“Dad it was terrible! Dr.Nefario was showing me his latest invention, some kind of electric laser suit or something when it started short circuiting.

I flew inside to try and stop him but it was too late.” I said, looking at the ground in faux sadness.

Dad embraced me again, somehow this time even tighter. 

“It’s OK kiddo. Don’t beat yourself up about it. You tried to save him, that’s what matters.”

I looked at him with teary eyes.

 “I know Dad, I really did.”

He pat me on the back before releasing me from his death grip hug.

“There’s still more to do, that blast took out nearly every window on this block, let’s help the paramedics treat the injured.”

He ran into a neighboring apartment building, his mind already focused on the next mission.

I spotted a broken fire hydrant spraying torrents of water into the street. I hovered inches off the ground, gliding over towards it.

I looked around, and when no one was looking, I quickly released the scarlet mass from my iron grip. 

A chunk of bone and tattered flesh clung to my right knuckle. I discreetly flicked it off onto the street, the water from the hydrant carrying it down a nearby storm drain.

I glanced at Dr.Nefario’s burning metallic tomb, smirking before rocketing into the blue sky. Onlookers gazed in awe, my takeoff fracturing the concrete beneath me into a million spider-like webs.

I danced through the air at the speed of sound, whirling, dipping, and then a slow pirouette as I rose above the clouds.

A toothy smile spread across my face as I thought to myself -

“I love being a hero.”
