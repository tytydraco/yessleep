I never really had dreams about archeology as a kid. Where other kids wanted to find dinosaurs or uncover lost tombs, I always wanted to be an astronaut. It was a stupid and cliché dream of course, but I can't see why I never wanted to excavate. Looking up into the boundless and infinite sky was always going to be less satisfying then uncovering what was finite and beneath us. 

Now I can understand why I chose to start the dig, but when I first stumbled across the Bone I don't know why it stuck out to me. I had to have known something about the Bone was special, the need to uncover what was hiding beneath the soil tugged at me.

It began a month ago when I was on a short hike just outside of my town. An unpopular but easy enough trail that trekked through some rocks in the desert, a nice challenge on my old knees. I had taken the hike multiple times in the past without incident, and I definitely didn't remember the Bone being there as I would have started digging sooner. I had rounded a corner when I saw, what I thought, was a white rock sticking out of the sand. It was small and inconsequential, but the thirst for what laid beneath it was vast. At the time, I suspect I did not understand the importance of that moment, how deep it would lead me.

I dusted it off with my sleeve and saw what looked like an old white stone. Even I could tell it was old, its surface was porous yet also smooth. It was not a perfect white, it was a sort of sickly yellow that brought to mind death. I thought it was interesting enough and went to pick it up with my hand, the moment I touched it I knew what it was, Bone. It was cold, cold enough that I almost immediately pulled my hand back. Almost. I wanted to have it, I wanted to find out what was left beneath the earth.

I pulled on it, I tried my hardest to pick it up but I soon found out it was deeper, deeper than I could think. I clawed at the dirt and sand and muck around it to reveal that it kept going down, not uniform in size. So I finished my hike and went home. It was dumb, I didn't know it's importance, I was naïve.

The night was fine, nothing was out of the ordinary. When I woke up the next day, I went again to the Bone. I brought along a small trowel I could better dig with. I know why I went back, to dig. But I believe it would have been out of the ordinary for me. I usually only went out on Saturdays, but the Bone was important. I arrive at the Bone and it was identical to how I left it, luckily no one had taken my finding. So I began to gouge the ground, to unearth my Bone. It went deeper than I anticipated. It got wider and thinner along itself, branching shortly before ending. I had  carved a hole roughly 10ft deep when I found a fruit of my efforts. Another bone, this one less important.

It was small and insignificant. I realized it was a human hand, skeletal and grasping upwards. I remember screaming, crying out into what I now realized was the night sky. I sped home in my car and dreamt of the cold embrace of the earth. I did not call the police as that would lead them to what I had found. I woke up the next day and headed back out to the Bone. I was supposed to go to work, but I had to finish what I started. This continued for the next couple weeks. I bore into the soft soil, which should have been rock by now. At some point I discarded the shovel in favor of my hands, it was more satisfying to feel the dirt beneath my nails.

It hurt and I screamed. I cried whenever I found a bone, but I had to find the end of it. It could only be so large, so why didn't it end? I continued to tunnel down and expose the Bone, but it seemingly never ended. I was far down when I realized I couldn't get out. It had been raining and I had been clawing through the mud and ground. My stairs had been melted away by the downpour and I realized I could no longer get out. For a time, I did try to escape, but clawing out was so much less than clawing in.

I have continued to dig, every day until I collapse. I sleep and I excavate. I write this because I know that before I found the Bone, I would have wanted someone to save me, to lift me from this pit. I would have screamed and cried for someone to save me. I suppose it is only a whim, but I thought I should at least do that for my old self. I have not revealed my location, I will not have someone steal my finding from underneath me. Funnily, it would be difficult to get beneath me as I am so deep. I imagine the Bone will end shortly, it has to.
