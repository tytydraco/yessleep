It was 6:23 AM as I woke up from my deep sleep. I could hear the traffic coming out of my older sister's apartment that I was residing in. I opened the curtains and saw the rising Manhattan skyline. I spent over 46 days without finding a good-paying job. Sure, there was the chance of being a cop in New York. But I didn't want that. I already did my time in the US Navy as a Seabee and was stationed in southern Iraq, patrolling the waters of the Gulf of Persia. When I arrived just a year and a half ago, I wasn't fully accustomed to civilian life. Of course, before I ever joined, I was studying at VMI for just 6 years, and before that, ROTC.

 
After a while, I once thought I had the world in the palm of my hands, following in my father's and grandfather's footsteps by being in the Navy. Yet once all that was done, I had nothing else. I didn't know what to do with my life. It felt alien or otherworldly, and so much has drastically changed since I came back home with only an NWU AOR2 uniform and tactical backpack on my back. 



Sure, I had minor jobs here and there, one as an armed private security contractor and the other as a city park ranger at Central Park. But it wasn't enough; in honest-to-God truth, I didn't want to be back here. I felt like I didn't belong here either.
 


This is no longer my world. Until I scoured the internet for anything that could apply to my skills and credentials, I thought, "Sure, I have the credentials and experience that anyone would kill for. When volunteering as an armed park ranger in Africa came up. Of course, this is kind of controversial for us US servicemen. Since people would regard us as mercenaries helping to fight poachers, why not? However, as I dug a little deeper, I found one that was affiliated with both the Congolese government and the United Nations Environmental Programme, together with one organization and company. So I looked into it, and this one was called the Equatorial Wildlife Protection Society of the Greater Kongo Antediluvian Basin.
 


This is the first time I've ever heard of it, besides knowing about the Congo. But! I've never heard of this so-called Greater Kongo Antediluvian Basin. It was the first time I had even heard such a name. Now, of course, in my house, and other meanings, like, for example, ancient land where there is a change or something. I dunno; I'm just trying to think of what it meant. And there I saw this link that I clicked. And there were a few openings for their volunteer park ranger personnel program, so I applied, and just to be safe, I also attached my resume to them. And so the wait begins.


 
I spend time with my sister's family and with some of my cousins that I haven't seen in a long time. Her husband has been a good friend of mine before. As we first met at Virginia Military Institute over the years spent as students, And when he asked for my sister's hand in marriage, I was delighted. 



And I am proud to have him as a brother-in-law. We all got together in this Italian restaurant where everybody had their dishes, whereas I just decided to have a good old-fashioned large pepperoni pizza with some extra cheese and marinara sauce. Didn't care about the fancy-smancy food that they got. But I can never beat a good pizza with Italian beer. And I mean that this Italian beer is so goddamn good. And it was one of the best things I ever had in my life.
 


Of course, my nephew, being a small boy, wanted a slice of my pizza, so I gave him a good slice of it. Even though he had his own food there, as his mom ordered. But hey, no one can beat the deliciousness of pizza. And to be honest, it was a good night that we went out. And it was something that I needed. Hanging out with relatives can relieve stress.
 


When we returned from our dinner, I received an email notification on my phone, and somehow I didn't realize it since I just put the phone on silent. And it was from the Equatorial Wildlife Protection Society. To my utter surprise, they have accepted my application and stated that I passed all the necessary requirements with flying colors.
I was dumbstruck at how fast they not only accepted me but even passed all their guidelines as well. Along with a set of rules and regulations they have given me. But let me just read what this says.

*(Thus Begins the PDF)*


*We finally welcome you to the Equatorial Antediluvian Wildlife Protection Society's Field Operations Tactical Unit (FOTU) from our Park Ranger Personnel Volunteer Program (PRPVP), as we are the primary organization of the Greater Kongo Antediluvian Basin. We have reviewed your application and resume upon further inspection and have granted approval. Congratulations on becoming part of our team. Upon arrival at the site, you will undergo orientation and partake in classes and training. Of course, your service in the United States Navy will be a great contribution to the Park Ranger Volunteer Program, but we must still train foreigners who volunteer in our establishment. Now, once you fulfill all of the requirements on our site, you will be given a uniform, gear, and a service-issue weapon. Personal weapons, both lethal and nonlethal, are not allowed on site. However, if you have personal body armor or a bulletproof vest, it will be allowed, as will personal canteens, backpacks, and any outdoor gear you wish to bring. We highly recommend that you bring five months of clean clothes and other amenities. Personal hygiene is important. And of course, we will also provide you with our own amenities. Along the way, you will be given a rule book and posted with orders that you must follow. Which will include log books, paper reports that you must fill out, and vehicle logs.*


*You must also be thinking about your pay. Not to worry about that, as we will cover it once you arrive on site. As for living accommodations, you will reside in private cabins near the site where foreign volunteers will live. It will have the necessary accommodations and a place to live. You will also bring some of your personal belongings. And it does not matter if it's games or books, as long as they are not lethal tools.*


*Visitors who will be arriving at the Zoological Preserve must be given a pamphlet with a set of rules and regulations by any means. If any of them were to disregard these sets of rules, they must be dealt with. We take the safety of this preserve with the utmost seriousness. Not just for the tourists visiting the park or the locals, but for the neoantediluvian fauna.*


*As you may already know, the foundations of this preserve were originally created by a British oil company that discovered this region until it was transferred to the Congolese government and monitored by the United Nations Environmental Program and Wildlife Conservation Society. Our preserve has undergone severe poaching incidents where hunters have been illegally harvested by selling to shadow entities, but with little success. Unlike the well-known African wildlife that many have come to know, these are extremely different and critically dangerous.*

*Our scientists and veterinarians who work with us make close observations, and you may even have to take them to the animal's paddocks. Take notice that this is a dangerous profession.*

*The Neoantediluvian wildlife is unlike the rest of the known African wildlife. These animals are extremely territorial and will kill to defend their space. Avoid, yet monitor, family pairs with their offspring. Always carry your radio and satellite phones with you; do not lose them. Large predator species are the most dangerous; keep a great distance away from them and only monitor them via binoculars. We will give you the entire information via PDF.*
You'll be debriefed entirely once you arrive.
 


*Please note that everyone must follow this set at all costs.*
 

*The Rules:
It is prohibited to collect or disturb fauna, flora, artifacts, or anything else that is naturally occurring in the park.*


*Pets are not allowed within the Congolese wilderness. They will become easy prey, resulting in severe consequences.*


*Feeding animals is not allowed. It upsets their diet and leads to human dependence.*


*All trash must be taken out of the park with you or placed in the park’s trash cans. Leave no litter, and never leave fires unattended or discard burning objects.*


*You must bring your own drinking water; it is not available everywhere in the park.*


*Fires are not only allowed at designated sites.
Firearms and fireworks are prohibited. Only active park personnel (rangers, security guards, and game wardens) are allowed to use service weapons, including active law enforcement*


*Personal watercraft, like jet skis, are not allowed in the preserve's waters.*


*If you need tide information, it is available at the KB visitor centers or online.*


*Be extra cautious if you are nearing any wildlife or vegetated signs.*


*Generators and other portable motors are not allowed in backcountry campsites.*



*If you need to use a bathroom and are not near any facilities, it is asked that you dig a hole in the ground at least 6 inches deep; the hole should be covered when you’re done. If you’re near a coastal ground site or a beach, you can urinate directly into the water.*


*Respect the privacy of the wildlife; this is their habitat. These animals are not like the rest of the African fauna. They will not hesitate to defend their territory.*


*Beware of the animals; they are wild and can be unpredictable.*


*Don’t crowd the animals or make sudden noises or movements. Avoid large predatory omnivores and carnivores during the evening and night hours.*


*Keep quiet; noise disturbs wildlife and may antagonize your fellow visitors.*


*Stay in your vehicle at all times, except at designated picnic or walking areas.*


*Keep below the maximum speed limit (40 kph/25 mph). (This applies to personnel unless in times of emergency.)*


*Never drive off-road; this not only severely damages the habitat but will attract large predatory species.*

As I finished my overview of the PDF within the hour left over the skies. seeing what I've read through just surprised me. First of all it was interesting yet bizarre given to me, I've learned a Great deal of what I'll be working with. The Greater Kongo Antediluvian Basin is smack dabbed between the two Congos.   The Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo where the map itself was a surprise for me, on how much area it covers. From the Oubangui to the Giri and Congo rivers. Such a good amount of terrain for these beasts. And surprisingly,  they want to make it as some sort of national preserve or park for visitors to experience these large species in their respective habitats, and some to be placed in  paddocks, enclosures and various fenced perimeters with roads connecting to one another. a sort of safari experience out in the jungle. I don't know how that's going to work due to that rough and rugged terrain.

It took us over 14 hours just to arrive at Ndjili International Airport in Kinshasa from New York. And all that time I was in a deep sleep. Like, was I really that tired. Man…I'd never known I needed that sleep. And what the hell was in those PM pills. 
Knocked the daylights right outta me. Can't wait to get the hell off this damn plane. 
My ass was getting sore. When it was time to go with everyone one by one getting their luggages.


I finally got out of the plane and stretched my whole body, where I could hear the cracks on my arms and back.I looked up at the cloud-covered sky. It was still foggy when I felt the rain. When I spotted a man wearing an olive-drab uniform,a beret, and a holster with his side arm leaning by the door of a SUV, carrying a clipboard that was tucked under his left arm. 

There he looked at his clipboard, then at me, and waved in my direction. Was he the one to pick me? Well, of course. There on his shoulders were patches of what I believed were acronyms, E.A.W.P.S., which later turned out to be the Equatorial Wildlife Protection Society. Soon I learned that the "A" in the acronym was originally Antediluvian. But recently placed in So I guess they haven't updated.


A Congolese park ranger was here to pick me up from the airport. He introduced himself as Mpenda Kayembe, or to call him Kay for short.


 
I noticed some white men walking outside from the departure exit. One of them was what I believed to be a Canadian wearing a green plaid shirt, boots, and brown cargo pants with a backpack and luggage bag. The three wearing only shirts and shorts were the Frenchmen. And the blonde one with the five o'clock shadow on his face, I think, is pretty much obvious.
 


As we all entered the SUV. Kay later stated that it would be a long ride. At least five hours to head towards our location. He drove away from the airport and through the bustling streets of downtown Kinshasa. Seeing this, I said to myself that no matter where I go, there's going to be traffic. At long last, we left the city completely, then drove past town after town and village after village. Where he navigated through a dirt road surrounded by dense forest. Trees that later grew taller, as I can see from the front window of the vehicle, became almost as tall as skyscrapers. 


At first, we thought it was dark until I realized it was just the shadows of the trees and the cloud-covered skies above. We were deeper into the forest, and the only thing that was before us was the dirt road. Snaking its way through it, leading up to the hills. Somehow I felt uncomfortable. As I just had this unexpected bad feeling. But! I got to keep my cool. Which was pretty weird. Don't know why I had this feeling.
 

A sound of thunder indicated an incoming storm. Rain began to pour heavily on the vehicle. Kay then wore night vision goggles as it became dark. We were caught in a thunderstorm. And four hours have passed as he later drove with precaution, not wanting to hit anything before him. He explained that there are small villages located within the forest, and the tribesmen use the dirt road for many purposes. But later said that there were problems occurring on the road.
 
Gervais wanted to know about these problems. Kay later informed him that he and his colleagues spotted animals crossing the road, primarily forest elephants, black rhinos, and bush pigs, until they witnessed a literal stampede. They had to take shelter far away from them as they were using the road. As if escaping from some terror.
 
He went on to say that some of the tribesmen expressed their fears to him and his fellow park rangers about the dangers they encountered. There, he suddenly came to an abrupt stop. The men inside fell on one another.
This aggravated some of us.
 
I wondered what the hell he did that for. He leaned forward, staring at something. Some of us went to the front to see what was going on. We could barely see what was in front of us as the rain and fog obscured our vision, even with the headlights on. But for Kay. He knew exactly what he was looking at.


I told him what he even saw. He elaborated that resting in the middle of the dirt road was the body of an African forest elephant, showing its back. Not wanting to scare off the animal, believing that it was sleeping. But out on the road, where it's raining, he moved in a little closer to see if the animal could wake up and move at the sound of the SUV. Nothing, so he drove closer. The elephant did not move at all. Just lying there on the road. However, the back of this bull elephant was riddled with claw marks. Yet these weren't done by any of the big cats.
 

He stopped the vehicle again, took off his goggles, and we all got out. And boy, were we getting drenched in the rain.
The rain hammered us as we walked with precaution towards the sleeping elephant. Kay took out his weapon just in case the elephant decided to immediately wake up and charge right at us.


 He took a few steps, trying not to make any unwanted noise. He knew the mammoth size of this elephant meant it was a bull. We were a few feet behind him. It was completely dark on the road between dense trees on both sides. Only the headlights of the SUV exposed us out in the open.
 

There, he looked down on the muddy floor covered in blood. Kay, later believing that it may have died, carefully looked around the elephant. We followed suit, and it was a staggering sight to behold. Kay grabbed his flashlight, and right there before us was a hollow cavity of the dead elephant with nothing but torn ribs and pieces of flesh dangling.


Its organs and abdomen were completely gouged out. Its face and trunk were ripped away, exposing only its skull. The elephant's jaw was no longer there. We all looked in amazement in the rain, standing over blood and mud. Bite and claw marks are seen within the carcass. Who could have done something like this? Kay later said that we must get back to the vehicle at once. He knew what could've done this as he was frightened. Well all of us were. And we don't know what caused the death of this large bull elephant. But whatever it was we did not stay longer. I never saw a full grown man like him being afraid. As if he knew something that we don't. And this is a guy who has dealt with poachers and dangerous animals. But being afraid of something that killed this elephant with ease.


 
One of the brothers noticed something on the ground. Kay shined his light later, revealing large four-toed footprints that led straight to the forest. When an ear-splitting roar, followed by thundering footsteps. And with the sound of branches breaking, we knew something very large coming in fast. There we saw the trees being shoved. It was heading straight in our very direction. All of those were sweating bullets. We have never been this scared before in our lives.  


We hurried towards the SUV. Got inside, and Kay floored it. Driving around  the dead, hollow elephant. The roar became louder and louder, stomping and crashing through the forest as we all drove away. We couldn't see what was happening. Only that we heard it. Until I saw this silhouette. It was hard to see but I can make out what it is. It looks like a large quadruped animal with a long tail, heavy head, almost reptilian in shape. But I don't care much about it now. I just wanted to get the hell out of this road. This was worse than a firefight. It happened so fast. And the one thing about primal fear. As if you see that it is unfamiliar. Including an animal that large that could tear an elephant in half. Will indicate that you're going to deal with something that no western man has ever seen before. 

 

Until I saw something being carried away in the sky. Due to the intense cloud cover and fog, I thought it was a bird, perhaps an eagle carrying a small animal. But then it hit me. It was a cow being carried off by something large. and what I saw took me off guard. It was a winged reptilian creature, almost dragon-like in appearance, but without the horns, with a long whip-like tail and bat-like wings. long, slender neck. 


It had no beak, only a long, narrow snout littered with those needle-like teeth. And its body was filled with scales, or osteoderms. I can't tell due to the fog and clouds.
 

There, the large winged monster placed its mouth on the cow's head and tore it out with ease. Like a hawk tearing a rat apart. Blood poured out like a fountain.


But I signed up for this. Within these five months will become the most dangerous service that I have ever enlisted. I don't know what horror would be there before me. As I just know one thing. I have to survive no matter what. And to be honest I am actually scared of even volunteering for this.  Whatever I saw behind us. I know I will see it again. And I pray to God that it won't get to me. Like what other creatures dwell in the Antediluvian regions.
