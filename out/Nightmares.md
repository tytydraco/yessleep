I live in a quiet, small town. I moved out of my parents’ house a few months ago, and am currently living with my girlfriend. For anonymous reasons, I won’t say her name. She let me have my manga and figurines in my room, which comforted me whenever I couldn’t sleep. I just recently started taking a medication that was supposed to stop me from having nightmares, however there was a recurring one. One that keeps haunting me, reminding me of what I’ve done. I lost count of how many times my brain made me remember, made me have sleepless nights and sink deeper into my depression. At first, I dismissed it as just another nightmare, however as I kept having it every night, I knew something was wrong. I hadn’t done it in a while, so why is my brain reminding me of everything thing inhumane I ever did? I did it to protect my loved ones, going as far as to glare daggers at anyone I saw as a threat. I needed to stop the nightmares; needed to get enough sleep again. I can’t pass out from lack of sleep at my workplace; it’d be humiliating. I know I should be sleeping instead of writing all this down, but I just need to let it out somewhere. I was never really allowed to vent, so I kept my emotions bottled up, never talking to anyone about my past until I went to college. To be completely honest, I never expected to get into one; I never really had good grades after all. I never expected a scholarship, either. I don’t know who provided it, but I was forced to go for a major I didn’t want to be in, courtesy of my parents. I dropped out, and started an online college. Some of the stuff I knew from high school. But that’s not what I’m here to talk about. I need to put the nightmares out so that it’s not plaguing my mind all the time. 

It started a few months ago, before I was back on antidepressants and moved in with my girlfriend. I was a numb person, not really feeling anything. I was already having trouble staying asleep as it is; insomnia not being a very good friend. So I took melatonin. It helped, for a bit, but I kept waking up in a cold sweat, my breathing fast. They were originally about the things I couldn’t do; about how I tried to save people but eventually losing them, no matter what I did. I got extremely distant from everyone around me, and people only talked to me if they needed to. I was content with that, despite being an extrovert way before middle school, but something changed. It was like one day, I hated confrontation. I hated people talking to me. My only comfort was books. I even wrote some myself, but was too shy to show anyone. Anyways, the nightmares got different when I started working at a bookstore before I moved. I was killing people. Torturing them, trying to make them talk and give me the information I needed. Hell, I felt nothing when I did it. I felt nothing when I made a child watch her parents die, before killing her. I lost count of how many people I killed in the nightmare, but they were all brutal. One of the torture methods I used was based on a story I read. It was very effective, it made me euphoric how well it worked. They all begged me for mercy, but I showed them none. I was being praised for how well I tortured people, and I basked in the compliment. I never really got compliments from my family, except for my sister, so it was foreign, but it made me feel happy. You’re probably yelling at me that I shouldn’t have felt happy over being complimented of torturing people, but at that moment, any compliment made me happy. 

My girlfriend woke me up one night because I was screaming from a nightmare. I can’t really remember what it was, but I could only assume it was the same as before. Recently, I had a new nightmare. Someone was hunting me. My immediate thought was because of the people I killed, but that was impossible; how could that be in this nightmare? They were two completely different ones. I found myself terrified, hell, who wouldn’t be? Being as small as I am, I could easily hide in many places; for once happy for my height. I was desperately praying I’d wake up soon, but no matter what I tried, I didn’t. The person was in the room with me. I went extremely quiet, my heartbeat so loud I thought he could hear it. This was all a game to him, my fear egging him on. I had to wake up, I had to get something to help me have a good sleep, but I couldn’t wake up. He was in front of my hiding spot, and I held my breath. After what felt like hours, he finally left, his footsteps receding. I breathe a sigh of relief, crawling out into the open. It was then I noticed a paper. Was that there before? I shook the thought from my mind, and picked it up. I wish I hadn’t. It was a letter, directed to me. I almost threw up, but read anyway. Maybe this would help me escape. It said only a few words.

You won’t survive. 

I read the sentence over and over again, as if I was trying to find a hidden meaning. I fell to my knees, starting to cry. I wanted to wake up, to cuddle with my cat, anything as long as I was out of this godforsaken nightmare. I knew it wouldn’t change anything by crying, but I just couldn’t stop. I was afraid. I wasn’t scared of death; I’ve flirted with it way too many times. All I knew was I didn’t want to die yet. I promised her I wouldn’t. I wipe my eyes, standing up. A thought popped in my head. What if I could get my girlfriend to wake me up? If I screamed loud enough, would it be enough for her to hear me? I hoped to god it would. So I tried. I know it’d probably give my location away, but I didn’t care. I wanted to wake up, to embrace my girlfriend, to kiss her. Nothing happened. My throat was scratchy from the screaming, and I slid against the wall. Maybe I wouldn’t die if I died in the nightmare? I could at least try. What other choice did I have? I heard the man walking back, and we stared at each other for a bit, before he chopped my head off. 

I woke up, gulping for air. My girlfriend was beside me, sleeping peacefully. My neck started hurting, and I rubbed it, trying to ease the tension, when I felt something. I quietly went to the bathroom, and flipped on the lights. It was a cut, like something had decapitated me. Just like in the nightmare. I then noticed some writing on the mirror that made my heart stop.

You won’t survive.
