  

Nightmares.

I haven’t slept in my bed in weeks. My breath constantly stinks of caffeine and I have the television on so loud that the neighbours have begun to keep a noise complaint log for my landlord to have me evicted. But I don’t care. They don’t share the same nightmares I do.  

It started a couple of weeks back. I slipped between my cold bedsheets and drifted off quickly. I have never suffered with insomnia, and now I welcome its agony. 

The brain must rest, and to deprive it of such, then it will dream while you are awake – hallucinations have become a very real part of my waking life. I have heard the shadows whispering my name. I have been jolted with adrenaline when plates have crashed onto the ground, only for me to find everything still. 

But the most harrowing hallucination I experience is the woman in the white dress I see standing in the corner of the room. Most days she doesn’t move. Her eyes and lips are sewn shut. But sometimes, her tightly woven lips stretch into a sinister maw, and the most hellish wail escapes her throat in a guttural rasp. 

My body aches for rest. But I can’t. I can’t fall to sleep.

My body is trying to kill itself. 

It started small – I would wake up making food in the kitchen with my hand hovering over the toaster with a piece of bread. Perplexed at first, I shook it off as some sleep anomaly. But then I woke up to myself in a hot bath fully clothed, with the same toaster hanging inches from the water with the plunger depressed. 

I tried locking myself in my room and hiding the key. But I would always find it. Whatever unconscious malevolent power has invaded my psyche and was driving me to self-immolation, it would not let a locked door stand in its way. 

I locked the door and posted the key under the gap, knowing I would need to be awake to have the motor skills required to delicately fish it out from the other side. But I awoke to myself banging on the window of my fifth-story apartment building, trying to break through glass to plunge to my death. 

I can feel myself drifting off as I write this. The woman in the white dress is here, her face stretching into a deathly yawn. Is she a figment of my imagination? Or is she something much worse? I dare not address her. To approach her or to open a dialogue is to accept that she is here in one capacity or another and I fear that will make things much worse. 

I have removed all sharp objects from my house. Last night was the worst yet, when I awoke to me carving my forearm open and pulling out my veins. I can’t go to the hospital. They will put me under.

So, I drink coffee. I smoke cigarettes. I exercise and plunge myself into cold showers when I feel the weight of sleep wanting to take me. I am forever trapped in this limbo of simply surviving. 

If you find this message, please come and check on me. I pray to god I am there to greet you. And if you see my demised carcass rotting in my home somewhere, then turn and leave before the woman discovers you. 

She may come for you next.
