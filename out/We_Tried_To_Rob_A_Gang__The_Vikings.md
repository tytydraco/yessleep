I run a large recreational drug manufacturing operation. For legal/personal safety reasons I will have to leave out a fair few details. What I can tell you is that I got caught up in all this by accident. Whilst in college completing my Pharmaceutical studies I met some guys at a bar who offered me a job making various types of recreational drugs. The money was to enticing to refuse. 

Flash forward ten years and I now oversee the operation. 

Our main client is a very well known biker gang. We offer them a large discount and in return they provide us protection and a constant buyer. We have an agreement to sell small amounts to other buyers as long as they are not a chance of becoming direct competitors. 

One of our small clients, a bunch of tall Scandinavian guys who call themselves The Vikings, had started up their own production as well as continuing to buy from us. Word got out that they were starting to flood the market with their cheaper (but poor quality) product. This didn't sit too well with my biker friends. 

The clubs Vice-President reached out to me, requiring some assistance. They wanted us to set up a large buy with The Vikings. Simultaneously the bikers would set up an ambush, making sure to send The Vikings a message, stay out of our business.

This whole thing put me in a really awkward position. Once word of this got out to our other small clients they would question our loyalty. But in the end we were at mercy to do what the bikers wanted. 

We arranged a good sized deal for four weeks time, $50k worth of product. The deal was planned to go down in the usual spot, a large warehouse normally used as storage for a construction company. The bikers scoped the place out ahead of time and planned to set up an ambush. My role was just to turn up with the product and do the deal like normal.

Enroute to the warehouse I started to get a sense of unease. As per normal I only had myself and two gaurds. Obviously we were all armed, but I've never had to use mine. My two guards were both ex-military and had combat experience. I had faith in them protecting me, but I was worried if it popped off we may get caught in the crossfire.

We parked in the warehouse and waited for The Vikings gang members to arrive. I started getting anxious. The knowledge that there were close to twenty armed bikers hidden throughout the warehouse did little to quell the bile building up in my throat. 

The Vikings pulled into the warehouse and four tall blonde guys climbed out of the black Mercedes. One of them, who I'd dealt with in the past, carried a duffel bag, presumably with our cash in it. 

We met and exchanged the product for the cash. Once I had the duffle bag in my hand the bikers came out and surrounded the four Scandinavians.

The bikers' attempt at intimidation didn't go well. The situation escalated quickly. A shot was fired from point blank and hit one of The Vikings right between the eyes. As he dropped to the ground shots started coming from every direction, the sound deafening as it echoed throughout the warehouse. Panic stricken I ran for cover. 

I found shelter behind several pallets of bricks. As I watched through the gaps I saw something unlike anything I've ever witnessed.

The Viking that had been shot square between the eyes slowly rose to his feet. A guttural roar erupted from their mouth as they tilted their head to the sky. Arms stretched out wide, their hands started to grow. Muscles bulged from their forearms, followed by their upper arms and shoulders. Their shirt tore and ripped as more of their muscles ballooned in size.

They let out a howl, as their face started to morph. Dark grey fur grew out of their skin and their face changed shape, large canine teeth grew from their mouth. After everything I saw it still seems stupid to say this, but they turned into a werewolf.

I noticed the other three gang members were undergoing the same transformation, all the while absorbing heavy fire from the surrounding bikers.

The bullets seemed to have no effect. 
Bewildered, I looked on as the wolves tore through the bikers. They were like wild animals playing with their prey. Sinking their teeth into the bikers necks and tearing them apart with enormous razor sharp clawed hands. 

I watched one wolf pick a biker up by the head, its claws piercing straight through its skull. Squashing the skull like an old tomato. It then threw the limp body aside like it was a toy doll.

Several of the bikers tried to make a run for it, but one of the wolves effortlessly closed the gap. The way the beast covered the ground was like a cheetah chasing a wounded gazelle. One foul swipe of its enormous paw took out the first biker. The sound of crunching bones echoed around the warehouse as the biker was flung through the air. 

I watched on as the wolves slaughtered the other fleeing bikers with ease, they never stood a chance. 

The wolves now had the only exit covered. 
We had been caught in our own trap.

One wolf stood guard at the exit while the other three started searching through the warehouse, finishing off the surviving bikers. I knew it wouldn't be long till they found me.

I attempted to move from my hiding spot but couldn't muster the courage. I was frozen in place, terrified knowing my death was imminent. 

It didn't take long for the wolves to sniff out the remaining survivors, and it was clear they took great joy in slaughtering each one of them.

I cowered in fear, wondering how long till they found me, when an earth shattering roar bellowed from above. Not my proudest moment, I broke down in tears. I slowly turned around to be faced with one of the beasts, standing at least 8 feet tall. The beast's mouth contorted in a grimace, five inch long canines protruded, dripping human blood. It's breath was sickening, the smell of carrion strong. It picked me up and dragged me out to the open part of the warehouse. 

Another one of the wolves walked over and I watched in trepidation as the two wolves morphed back into human form. 

The taller of the two, who I believed to be in charge, looked at me bemusedly. With a smile he said to me "You work for us now. Don't make the same mistake twice. We will be in touch soon. Now go before I have a change of heart."

You best believe I ran out of there as fast as possible. 

It has now been twenty-four hours since the incident and I am still trying to process what I saw. Hopefully sharing my story with you all will have some therapeutic benefits. Mostly I'm anxiously awaiting contact from my new employer, [I will let you know how it goes](https://www.reddit.com/r/MP_stories?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
