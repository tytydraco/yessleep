As I wake up this morning, there’s a huge pit in my stomach. I can’t believe I’ve really let Kevin convince me to do this stupid online trend, “The Elevator Game” – even the name sounds stupid. It’s been the talk of the town for the last few weeks, though. People just won’t stop talking about it…hell, Kevin has been obsessed since he first heard about it last month.  I still remember the day he told me about it, the glint in his eyes and the sound of excitement in his voice. It was obvious this was something he was interested in, but normally he moves on from things quickly. He doesn’t usually show this level of fervor for things, so yesterday, I agreed to do it with him.

We’re supposed to meet at the old Gwendal Hotel down the road in about an hour. According to Kevin, it’s the only building in town with an odd number of floors, which is important for some reason. That building kind of gives me the creeps if I’m being honest. It’s old, run down, and I swear it feels like the building has eyes or something. I don’t know how to describe it, but every time I walk by, I feel like it’s watching me. I know I sound crazy, but trust me, if you saw it, you’d know exactly what I’m talking about.

I get myself out of bed, eat my typical breakfast of toast with jam and eggs, grab a quick shower, and head out the house. I shoot Kevin a text: “On my way over, see you soon”. Within five seconds of it being delivered, Kevin replies: “Waiting outside for you”. He’s feeling prompt this morning – he must still be excited to do this thing; I was kind of hoping he’d change his mind last minute, to be honest. Sure enough though, as I walk up to the hotel, there’s Kevin beaming at me, just as excited as the day he told me about this dumb game.

In his hands, I can see him holding a laminated notecard. “Yo, what’s that for Kev?” Without skipping a beat, he thrusts it out towards me, “These are the rules of the game, I thought it might be nice to have them to refer to”, he says as I take the card from him.

**THE RULES**

·      **You must start on the bottom floor, go up to the top floor, go down to the second floor, up to the second highest, and so on. The game ends when you reach the middle floor of the building.**

·      **You cannot leave the elevator cart once the doors close on the first floor unless a blue-haired woman gets on to do an inspection during your game, in which case you must leave the cart and allow her to complete her inspection.**

·      **Do not speak to anyone that boards your elevator cart.**

·      **When the doors are open, you must look out of the elevator cart until the doors close. You may not look away or shut your eyes.**

·      **If the lights go out at any point, you must place both hands on the walls of the elevator cart until the lights come back on.**

·      **If you hear knocking, make sure to knock back three times.**

·      **Whenever you smell sulfur, lay on the floor of your elevator cart until the smell passes.**

·      **If the doors do not open on a floor, continue playing as normal.**

“What a weird and oddly specific set of rules…there’s no way most of these will be relevant right?”, I say to Kevin without looking up from the notecard, still a little perplexed. “I’m not sure, to be honest…none of the influencers I watch have actually played the game.” I look up at him. He’s staring at the floor, a little embarrassed I can tell. “So, you have no idea what to expect?” He gives me a nod confirming. I let out a long sigh before taking a few steps toward the hotel. “Well, I guess there’s only one way to find out right Kev?” I hear him jog up behind me to catch stride as we walk side-by-side into the Gwendal.

The Gwendal is kind of a strange hotel, now that I am inside of it. The layout is weird – the elevator is at the end of a long hallway with all the rooms running across either side. At the other end of the hallway from the elevator is a door which presumably leads to the stairs for use in a fire emergency or if the elevator is out-of-order. As we were walking in, we were greeted by a nice, older looking gentleman sitting alone at the front desk. He had a warm smile, but didn’t say anything to us. Just a smile and a nod before he went back to reading the paper. That’s fine with Kevin though, he’s clearly not here to socialize since he made a beeline to the elevator.

“Dude, hurry up! I already called the elevator!”, he shouts from down the hall.  As he finishes shouting, his voice is replaced by a single, high-pitched ding, signaling the elevator doors have opened. “Come on man!”, I hear him shout again. I jog over to the elevator to see Kevin holding the door open with his arm, already standing in the cart. I join him in the elevator and Kevin allows the door to shut behind us. “Alright, top floor first, right?”, he asks as he hovers his finger over the button marked with a 25. I give him a nod as he presses the button.

The button lights up with a soft yellow light, and the old elevator hums to life. It’s surprisingly quiet for how old this building is. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not silent, but just a soft hum as the old cart whisks us up to the 25^(th) floor. As we begin our ascent, I look around the cart to see where we’ll be spending the next however long this whole thing takes. It’s a fairly large cart, enough room for at least twenty people, maybe more if you don’t mind a squeeze. The floor is covered in a red and black patterned carpet, that back in the day probably didn’t look so dingy and gross. The walls are covered in intricate wood paneling with a large mirror on the back wall. Above the door, there’s an old timey floor dial with the numbers listed on a semi-circle and an iron arrow that moves along to show you which floor you’re on. I watch the arrow slowly swing its way from 24 to 25 as the doors open with a ding.

Kevin nudges me on the arm, “hey man, remember the rules? We have to look out the door.” I turn my eyes toward the door and look out into the hall of rooms. In front of each room, there is a light on the wall covered with a red lampshade. The same carpet from the elevator stretches out into the hallway too, and it looks just as dingy in the hall as it does in the cart. The walls have dated wallpaper on them, at least where it isn’t peeling. As I look down the hall, I notice there’s no door at the other end. “Hey Kev, why do you reckon there’s no stair access up here?” I ask him without breaking my gaze. “How the hell should I know man, I’m not an architect.” He chuckles back at me. He doesn’t seem to think it’s odd, but I do.

The elevator door slowly shuts as Kevin reaches his hand over and presses the button to take us to the second floor. As the elevator starts to rumble and move, a pungent smell stings my nostrils. “Is that rotten eggs?” I hear Kevin ask as he plugs his nose. “I think it’s sulfur, isn’t that on the rules?” I reply grabbing the card from my pocket. I give it a quick scan and see it there. I have to lay on the ground? Why? That makes no sense, but to be fair, this whole game makes no sense. I lay down on the old, dusty carpet as Kevin takes his place next to me. As we lay there, staring at the ceiling, I notice a small hole no bigger than a dime near the center. I stare through it into the dark above us as we descend.

The doors swing open with that same ding as we arrive at the second floor. Kevin and I stand up and look down the hallway – it looks the same as the 25^(th) floor. I would imagine all the halls are going to look more or less the same, though there is a door for stair access here. I hear a slow, steady creak as one of the room doors in front of me swings open and an older woman walks out. “Hold the cart please”, I hear a soft, older voice call out. I put my arm in front of the door to give her time to make her way over. “Thank you deary”, she warmly says as she walks into the cart. I give her a nod, as I remember the third rule – we can’t speak to anyone who boards. She walks over to the control panel and hits the button marked with a 24. How odd that she happens to be going to the same floor we need to go to.

As the doors shut and the elevator once again begins ascending, I hear, “what brings you both to this old musty building?” I stare blankly at Kevin as we both, without speaking, acknowledge that we can’t answer her. “Yoo-hoo! Deary?” She calls louder to me this time grabbing my shirt sleeve as she speaks. I feel so bad just ignoring her, but I want to take this whole game thing seriously for Kevin. “I know you’re not hard of hearing at your age!”, she says again, almost shouting at this point. She grabs me by the arm this time, trying desperately to get my attention. I look up at the floor dial as the arrow passes 14, 15, 16, 17, until I feel a sharp pain in my arm. I quickly jerk away from the woman and see a small cut on my arm from her fingernails pressing into me. “Too good to talk to an old lady, are you?”, this time shouting at me. I look down towards her as she’s brandishing a knife from her purse. She steps closer to me, her eyes now beady little black dots and her brows furrowed with anger. “Can you hear me now deary?”

Before I can even think, Kevin shouts at her “hey lady relax why don’t you!”. A moment of silence fills the air for what seems like an eternity. As she turns her attention to Kevin, taking a step towards him, the elevator doors open and silence is broken by the chime. “Oh, this is my stop dearies”, she says calmly placing the knife back in her purse and exiting the elevator. We both look out the door after her as she walks down the hall. About halfway down the hall, she stops, turns back and says, “you know, you will regret breaking the rules”. As a wry smile creeps across her face, she turns away from us and walks out the door at the other end of the hall. She’s right, Kevin did break the rule…but how could she possibly know that?
