I've recently started working late to make some extra cash. Almost every day after five, the building goes quiet and it's just me, some coffee and the dim, yellow light from my office against the world. I like to listen to the radio to fill the silence - I can't exactly say what I've been listening to. I mostly just switch between channels.

I was deep into some paperwork, listening absently to some channel with 90s music. I have no particular music taste, as I said, and I don't remember the channel I listened to or the channel I switched to after that. All I know is that I came across a man talking in a relaxed, outgoing tone; the type of voice a radio host puts on.

"...and you couldn't pay me to go out on a night like this! It's so cold, so lifeless out there, which is why I'm glad I have a desk job. Am I right? While we're on that, tonight's topic is, you guessed it, jobs. Specifically hating our jobs. Come on, you mean to tell me you've never complained about anything at your workplace? What, you think I do this out of passion?"

He laughed, then continued: "Text or call at \[number\] and let's talk about why you hate your job. Here it is, your chance to complain! I'll start - sometimes I feel awkward talking to myself. I'm literally staring at a beige wall, a fern and a coffee machine that only works for espresso as I'm talking to you. I'm a social being! You can't have me talk all by myself... drives a man crazy. Aah, here we have our first caller! Hello, hi - what's your name?"

"Um, Michael."

The guy who spoke had a lower, sleepier voice.

"Hi, Michael! So, what do you hate about your job?"

"Pff, where do I start? I'm working 9 to 5 for some asshole no one can stand, and on top of that, the pretzel stand out the street shut down the other day. That was literally what I looked forward to every morning. Now I have no reason to go to work anymore."

"That sucks. Why'd it shut down?"

"I have no idea, but I'm seriously thinking about opening up my own pretzel stand. I'd make a lot of money from other desperate corporate workers like me. I need a sweet treat."

"And I support that. You could call it... Michael's Sweet Dream."

"No offence, but that name sucks."

"Pretzel Factory?"

"Isn't that the name of another stand?"

"I have no idea... aaand we have another caller on the line! Sorry, Michael, but I'll have to cut you off. Good luck with your pretzel business! You know what they say, do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life. Hi there! What's your name?"

"Hello, I'm Tim."

"Hi, Tim! What do you hate about your job?"

"I'm a teacher. I think it's self explanatory."

"What, the kids giving you trouble?"

It was weird, but something about Tim's voice bothered me.

"Yeah, you could say that. They're really stubborn. And the parents complain a lot... keep saying things like I should stick to the planned lessons and not go off topic, dude - I'm teaching them about life. I'm just really sad that they don't appreciate that. It's not fair that I'm almost losing my job over some bullshit-"

"Aah, Tim, I'm afraid we're on air, you can't say bullshit! What do you mean, losing your job?"

"I swear I just wanted to teach them about the real world, but then I get all these parents on my head, talkin' bout some killin' 'n shooting 'n..."

I couldn't quite place his accent.

"Wait, you taught them about killing?"

"I was just tellin' them to be careful and talkin' bout how many people get killed on the streets for nothin'... even inside. Even in break-ins. Lord, who knows, you could be alone right now and someone could break in and just kill you, just like that, right now, quick, no safety anywhere. Gotta teach them. Young."

"Isn't that disturbing?"

"No. It's real."

"But is it worth risking your job? Yeah, if the kids are safe and educated. I don't think so."

I looked up from my computer. 

Had... the host answered his own question?

The more I focused, the more the lines between the two voices began to blur. At one point, I heard a raspy intervention but forgot what it had said. Maybe it hadn't been important.

And yet...

Something bothered me. I was alone at my desk, the whole office silent, a window to my right, my back to the glass door that was pointlessly closed, since I could basically see the dark hallway if I turned around. 

And anyone could see me.

What channel was this? As the conversation between what was now a high-pitched plumber talking about taking care of the world's bullshit carried on, I glanced out the window, to the neat spots of grass below me, nestled between the tall glass buildings. Two cars parked. One, mine. One, a stranger's. Door open. Some trail of water extending from the opened car door to the building. Water?

I looked back to my computer, then behind me. The hallway drowned out a poor flickering light in the distance. Something bothered me. Something itched just below my skin.

I thought of the entrance of the building. Of the beige walls, and the ferns. And the coffee machine that only worked for espresso.

I thought of what the host had said.  *I'll start - sometimes I feel awkward talking to myself. I'm literally staring at a beige wall, a fern and a coffee machine that only works for espresso as I'm talking to you-*

"Well, folks, we're approaching the end of our program. Don't forget to call the number \[xxx\] to have an intervention-"

I don't know why I did it, but I called the number. I just needed to see what was going on.

It rang a few times. The host went silent. 

My mind was spiraling. I had so many questions and my stomach was awfully tense, as it happens when you eat something wrong and your body can't decide if it needs to throw it up or not. The knot intensified as the phone just kept ringing and ringing. 

Then, someone picked up. 

I could only hear heavy breathing on the other side. That went on for longer than it should have, and then the breathing got a new rhythm. Accentuated from time to time. As if whoever was breathing was also walking.

Or going up the stairs.

My heart a painful knot, I shot up and darted to the door. My sweaty fingers struggled with the lock at my eyes scanned the dark hallway, unsure of what to expect. "Who the fuck are you?" I muttered into the phone. The heavy breathing stopped. 

In the distance, I could have sworn I saw someone cross the end of the hallway. Before I could ask another question, they hung up.

I'm now stuck here. My radio station also lost that channel. I don't know what to do. 

That car is still fucking parked outside, and I think that trail is too dark for it to be water.
