I’m not really sure what the point of writing this is… I can’t be sure I won’t be dead fairly soon. But… God, these past 2 or so hours have been such a blur. I’m exhausted. I can barely even fathom what’s happened.

This whole situation feels like a nightmare. Like I should wake up any moment now, but I’m just lying to myself at this point. It’s real. I don’t know how. I don’t know what these things are or what happened. I don’t know why or how.

But these weird creatures from the depths of my nightmares… somehow, this is the reality. I wish I could go back a day or so and relive my normal life one more time. But here I am, shaking, cold, and crying. I genuinely feel like I’m dying.

If memory serves, it was around 5 AM when I awoke to something. I was sleeping restlessly. Honestly, whatever I was dreaming about was tame compared to what was about to happen. My eyes slowly opened to the dark abyss of my room. It felt darker than usual, whatever that may mean.

Then came an indescribable sound from downstairs. At first, I thought it was something from a nightmare. I felt half asleep. But as it persisted and I slowly came to, the sound finally registered in my brain. “What the hell is that?” I thought. Some strange, ear-piercing shrieking, but somehow it was overlaid with a strange clicking, as if the sounds were made at the same time. It didn’t make sense, and for the life of me, I can’t physically make it make sense. Two things happened over each other, like two sounds occupying the same instance. It wasn’t loud, but it made my head pound. “What… how is…” My mind raced. What was I hearing?

I instantly sat up in bed as my heart started beating in my throat. My skin was crawling. I felt itchy. My eyes felt itchy. I don’t know why, but something was wrong, something felt wrong inside me. I carefully got out of bed and fumbled in the dark for the lamp cord. I clicked it several times. It didn’t work. “The hell… is the power out?” I fumbled for my phone to use its flashlight and slowly made my way to the stairs.

The empty rooms along the main loft to the stairs were pitch black as I walked by them. Each one, I could swear over my shoulder, something was peering and staring into me. I looked back a few times. Nothing, obviously. I would shine the light into the rooms. Not really sure what I expected. “

“My eyes, why are they so itchy?” I froze. The screeching… again. It made me dizzy, and I grabbed the wall for balance. It was in the kitchen. Did some animal get inside? It didn’t sound like any animal I had known. Again, the sound was impossibly complex. It shouldn’t have been possible.

I walked down the stairs slower than I had in my life. Each brush of my shorts, my feet lifting off the stairs, each tiny noise was setting me off. Sweat dripped from my forehead, and I had goosebumps. “Why am I so nervous?” I suppose it was a reasonable reaction to something being inside my house. I couldn’t know at the time, however, what was there.

I quietly stepped onto the floor. My house was set up so the stairs led next to the front door. The dining room was to the right facing the door from the bottom step, and a hall to the living room to the left. The kitchen connected both, completing this loop.

I wanted to grab the hatchet I kept in the garage, just in case whatever it was acted hostile toward me. The door to the garage was down the hall and in view of the kitchen, so whatever it was might see me, as the lights were on in the kitchen? “What? How were they on? I turned them off before I went to bed… right? An animal wouldn’t be able to turn it on. Was it a person? Making those noises? No…” I shook my head as it swirled.

I crept down the hall, my whole body on edge. I was shivering uncontrollably. It was cold. I thought at the time it was because the AC was on, as it was July and extremely hot outside. I could never sleep unless it was freezing at night. I crept to the garage door and got in view of the kitchen. I tried to peek around the corner to see what was in the kitchen. My eyes got itchy again. I felt myself physically go pale.

There was some humanoid figure in there. I could only see his arm around the corner. But he… his arm seemed to fade in and out of physical view. Not as if it was behind something, but like it was and wasn’t there at the same time. My depth perception wasn’t… it didn’t… I struggled to even comprehend what I was looking at. It seemed to be closer and further away at the same time. Everything about his arm seemed impossibly perceivable. I can’t even describe what I was looking at.

My eyes itched bad, my head got fuzzy, and I couldn’t move. I felt paralyzed. Its head, or what I thought was its head, jerked violently around the corner. It distortedly crumbled from around the corner. Nothing about its body made sense.

It screeched again and ran at me. My body seemed to move automatically as I bolted on a dime and slammed the door behind me. I rushed out, grabbed the hatchet, and rushed to hide behind a rack in the dark as it seemed to phase through the door, and then the door wasn’t there.

Could it see in the dark? Could it see? Now my eyes adjusted to the dark, and I could make out its form more. It was vaguely humanoid, but its joints seemed to change size and move around. Its limbs and neck constantly retracted and lengthened as it crept around. Every movement it made was stiff, as if it was a puppet or animatronic. Its head had no features, but where a mouth was, it wasn’t. I swear, the best way it could be put, not a single physical characteristic about it was constant.

Looking at it made my head hurt as I tried to figure out what I was looking at. I stumbled back, and its head turned immediately towards me, and its body seemed to become facing me as it had always been. My eyes started itching and hurting ferociously as it leaped at me.

I braced for it to reach me and started swinging best I could through my tears, although initially it had little effect. It leaped onto me, and I felt burning pain through my entire body. I couldn’t see, and a blind tussle ensued. It wasn’t very strong, however, and I was able to slam its head against the wall. Its skin was warm and rubbery, although it felt almost fiery and burnt to touch. I hacked into its head, and the thing crumpled to the ground. When it did, my vision started shaking and getting blurry and inconsistent. I stumbled out of the garage and into the kitchen. I locked the door—like that would do anything—and tried to sit down.

All of a sudden, the adrenaline wore off. I started shaking violently again, and my thoughts finally began to set in. “What the fuck?! What is that? Am I dreaming? Am I going insane? How is it… why… how does it exist? I can’t look at it without my mind hurting? It doesn’t make physical sense.” A million thoughts swirled through my head.

There were bloody scratches all over my body, and dirt from where I was hiding. And then I remembered, “Addy…” My wife was working the night shift at the hospital. God, why wasn’t she my first thought? Was she okay? Were there more of these… things? I called her. Surprisingly, the call went through, but it went to voicemail after a while. I tried several times. No luck.

I started panicking when I heard a noise in the garage. It was up. I stood up, snatched my backpack, quickly put on shoes, and thought the best thing was to get out of the house. I went out the back and snuck around to the front. It was almost 7 by now, but it was still pitch black outside. And it was cold… in July? And there were no stars or clouds or the moon or anything in the sky. It was silent outside and dark and cold, and nothing made sense. “What is going on?”

I held the hatchet in some kind of ready position—not like I was trained in fighting in any way conceivable—and crept my way to the front. I stood and went through my options. “I don’t know what that is, but it’s gonna kill me, probably. I don’t think I can fight it very well. It was on me for a few seconds, and I’m covered in blood. My body is sore. I could take the car, but obviously, that’d be loud. I could go on foot, but obviously, that’d leave me much more vulnerable.”

As I hurriedly weighed my options, I heard the back door open and something step onto the porch. My heart dropped, and without thinking, I sprinted out the front and down the sidewalk. The reality started to hit me from there. There were many of these things, and all the lights in the houses were out. I assumed most people were dead, but for now, my best bet was to head to my friend’s house. Jody. “Friend” was a funny word… better, the only person I knew around here. He was nice, a bit of an oddball, but nice, and right now, was maybe my saving grace. I texted him.

“Jody, are you there? Jody? Please respond. Please tell me you’re still alive.”

“Holy shit. Austyn? Dude, what the hell is going on?”

“I have no fucking clue. Listen, where are you?”

“I’ve been holding up in my house. One of those things is downstairs.”

“Ok, listen. I’m gonna make my way there. Just stay put. Don’t die. Please.”

“Alright. Stay safe, man.”

Right now, he felt more than the only person I knew. I felt guilty. But I had to get there.

I turned back to see them creeping closer. I kept rushing and sprinted into an alleyway between houses to rest for a moment.

I turned my camera on with the flash and finally got a look at myself. My face and body were covered in blood and bruises and small burns, I guess from the encounter in the garage. My clothes were ripped, and my eyes… my eyes were severely bloodshot, and they were bleeding. I suppose that’s why they were itching so bad. These things somehow caused them to bleed.

I looked miserable. I sat down for a moment, leading me to now. It’s dead silent and nearly pitch black and cold, and I have no idea how to reach Jody. Or if Addy’s ok. My body is sore, and the cuts burn and eyes sting. I’m shaking and crying and feel horrible. I’m really not sure what to do. The only thing I guess is to make my way to Jody’s. I’ll update with what happens next.
