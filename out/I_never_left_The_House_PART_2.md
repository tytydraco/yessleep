It has been a bit more than a day since I woke up alone in The House. I’m so happy to see that some people answered to my post, this means you are all real people living at the same time as me, and that I’m not alone, so I guess that’s the first lie I’m discovering.

 

Yesterday, after having fed the little girl that I found and post my experience on here, I’ve continued to wander around The House. Before leaving her, I told the young girl that she could stay in the computer room.

 

My first instinct was to go in the yard. I looked through the fence for some time, hoping to see any sign of life, but I found nothing except some birds chirping. I screamed for help for a few minutes but had absolutely no answers.

 

After that, I went to the check-up room. Since I woke up a couple of hours earlier, I was anxious about something, and I needed to clear off my mind: I was scared that there would be no injections left. As far as I remember, there has never been a day in my life where I didn’t get my shot, and even if I don’t exactly know what it’s for, they told us that it was important. Of course, I remember what Tyler and Debbie told us: how we should not trust the people in The House, but the shots never did anything bad, and Tyler and Debbie never mentioned those when they were warning us.

 

When I arrived at the check-up room, I immediately opened the shelf where they always took the shots from. Luckily, there was still a lot of them. After counting them, there was 52 left. I immediately took two and injected them into my arm. I saw them do it a thousand times, so I was very good at it. After that, I tried to open the back door of the room. It was always closed, but it was the only one I didn’t check. Unfortunately, it was still locked.

 

I decided to keep looking around The House to find anything that could be helpful. I really wanted to avoid the hallway covered in blood, but the offices in it were the only place I didn’t look in. I took a huge breath and slowly walked into the hall. All the blood was still fresh, and I tried to look up to the ceiling to see less of it. I finally arrived at the door of the first office. I opened it. Entering that office felt so weird. I always saw it since I was little, but never in my life I put one foot inside of it. I got to admit that I felt somewhat of a cool girl or something, I don’t know, but it’s possible that I started to dance when I got in, but I probably looked stupid. I thought that Peter would have probably mock me if he was here. All of sudden, that was a huge reminder that, for the first time in my life, Peter wasn’t with me, and that I had no idea where he was. I was so scared that whatever happened the night before had got him, that he was dead, but I had one thing that kept me hoping that he was still alive somewhere: there was no blood in our bedroom. The hallway, where the thing supposedly made the most victims, was covered in blood, but our bedroom was clean like nothing happened.

 

I didn’t really know where to start in the office. There was a lot of shelves with what looked like files, and I had no idea what it was about or where to begin. I decided to take the first binder in the top left of the shelf that was right in front of me and opened it. I don’t really understand what I found, so I’ll just describe to you what was written on the first page, maybe you can explain me…

 

So, on top of the page was written “Expense Report”, then there was a name, I think it was a doctor as there was “Dr.” written before his name, and below the name was written “House 1 – Vesel Initiative”. After these and a few more notes was some sort of grid. In the first column was written this: “HBADA Butterfly Office Chair-Gray”. In the second was written: “199$00”, and in the third one: “Immediate request”. At the bottom of the page was a lot of gibberish that I don’t understand at all, and then two signatures. The rest of the binder was full of these with only the first and second column changing. I have no idea what this is about, but I didn’t waste any more time on this. I opened a few other binders, just reading the first few pages to see if it seemed of any interest, but the entire first shelf was full of things I didn’t understand.

 

I then moved to a drawer. I opened the top one and it was full of pages. I took out the first one and opened it. Immediately, this was more interesting. I’ll rewrite you what was on that first page…

At the bottom of the page was gibberish again, I didn’t understand any of it. But the things I just read were a lot to take in. Almost everything that was written there I was completely unaware of, and I don’t understand all of them. What exactly is “Delusional Disorder”? Or “Focal Epilepsy”? And the treatments I apparently received, how did they give me those? Maybe they were in the shots, but I’m not sure, as the injections are mentioned at the beginning of the page. And what would happen now that I probably didn’t get them. All of this really scared me.

 

I turned to the next page. It was the same kind of file, but for Peter. He was labeled “Subject 2” and seemed to have way less issues than me. His file only mentioned a peanut allergy, but that’s it. I then took the next file in the drawer. As I opened it, I found myself in front of a lot of things I didn’t understand, mostly what I believe to be scientific language. There was still a whole lot of files and I couldn’t hope to read it all in one day, so I decided to stop there for the day, plus there was still two more offices, probably filled with more stuff to read.

 

I decided to go back to the little girl in the computer room. When I arrived, she had put some music on and was sitting on the floor. It was starting to get dark outside, so I proposed her to eat. I took out everything I could find in the kitchen, so that she could have the choice. She looked a bit happy to see it and started to eat. We sat in silence. She still wasn’t talking. When we finished, I said it was time to sleep. I couldn’t sleep in my room anymore, so we would sleep on the couches of the computer room. Before doing so, I went to the check-up room to give myself my two shots of the evening. I then went back to the computer room and found the little girl already sleeping on one couch. I lied down in the other one and slowly fell asleep.

 

I was suddenly woken up in the middle of the night by a loud noise. The little girl was smashing her head on the wall very hard. I had no idea what to do, so I just ran towards her and pulled her away from the wall. She was resisting with a pretty impressive strength for her age, but I succeeded to take her away from the wall. Her head wasn’t too much injured. She looked up to me and her eyes were filled with tears, she looked scared and it honestly terrified me too. Her eyes slowly turned white, and she started to let out a scream. It sounded nothing like a human or anything similar. It seemed raw, painful, and it was absolutely terrifying. Her mouth opened wider as the seconds passed. She then lifted her arm to her mouth and bit herself. She planted her teeth deep inside her flesh and, in a second, bloods was flooding everywhere. She stayed with her teeth in her arm for some time, as she seemed to be in pain. I tried to take her arm, but she was from an unbelievable strength, and I couldn’t do anything. In the heat of the moment, for some reason, my first instinct was to give her a huge punch in the face. It kinda worked, as she stop biting herself and screamed towards me. She sounded even less human than before, and I was petrified. After a few seconds of screaming, she fell on the floor. In an instant, she was completely knocked out. Her arm was still bleeding a lot, and I started to get closer to her, when I suddenly saw spots in my vision. I can’t really explain it, it was like white/black spots, and it was getting bigger and bigger with every second. I remember falling on the floor and my hands starting to shake, but then it’s a complete black-out.

 

I woke up this morning and my whole body was hurting, I had a few bruises all over my body. The little girl was lying where she fell last night, and, after a few minutes, I gently woke her up. She opened her eyes, and she seemed back to normal. I asked her if she was okay, and, to my surprise, after a few seconds of looking around her, she mumbled a “yes”. I was kinda shocked to see that she could actually talk, but I didn’t mean to scare her, so I just asked her name, to which she answered “Ava”. I looked at her arm. The wounds already started to heal, but she was covered in blood, and I had no idea how to treat them, so I told her that she needed to wash herself. She agreed immediately, and I took her to the shower. She seemed to know how it worked, so I left her alone.

I’m currently waiting for her to finish as I’m writing this. I have so many questions, and I don’t understand everything, but if any of you ahs more questions, or any advices, I’m more than [open.](https://www.reddit.com/user/markimdreaming/comments/1c1gwgd/full_universe_timeline/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
