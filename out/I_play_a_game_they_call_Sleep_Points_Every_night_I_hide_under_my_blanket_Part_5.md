When I got home, I finally got all of the stuff I was grounded from back. Dad gave me my laptop back, my switch back, and he said I could watch the TV again. He also talked about how he had said that he’d lost my phone the previous night. How he told me I might not be getting it back today like I would be getting back everything else if he still hadn’t found it by that point. And then, as if it was some big surprise, he gave me my phone back too.

“Guess what I found just next to the nightstand?”, he said enthusiastically.

Obviously, I had put the phone there myself, so I knew where it was. But I couldn’t let dad know that I had been fooling around with my phone while I was grounded from it. I went along with everything and acted all surprised and like I didn’t know he’d be able to find it. Even though I made sure to put it literally right up against the nightstand with no clothes or anything covering over it. So, I told him thanks for having found it again and he apologized for having lost it for a while, so I told him not to worry about it.

“You know what, Morgan?”, my dad started. “You’ve really handled being grounded like a champ. Throughout this whole week, I haven’t caught you on your phone, or your laptop, or your switch. I haven’t even heard you complain. Yeah, I had to shut off the TV, but your mother was right: I hadn’t really said anything about the TV. And once I did, I never saw you on it again. I’m really glad to see you taking responsibility for your actions like this”, he finished.

Obviously, this wasn’t entirely true. The stuff about my switch, my laptop, and the TV had all been true. But as far as my phone was concerned, that couldn’t have been further from the truth. I had gone on my phone literally every day of my grounding. All seven days. But I couldn’t tell him about that. Seriously taking responsibility for my actions now would just get me into even more trouble than what I had gotten into originally. So I just went along with it, and acted like there was nothing wrong with anything he was saying. But then my mom came into the room. And suddenly, that became pretty tough to do.

“Your father and I have been talking. Since you’ve done so well with being grounded, now that it’s over, we thought we’d give you something for your trouble. We know how much you like you like your video games, so we went out and bought something for you”, my mother explained.

“Cliff,” my mother said, gesturing toward my father. He handed me a wrapped present from behind his back and when I opened it up, it was Kingdom Hearts III, the latest in the series at the time. It hadn’t even been out for a month yet.

So now my parents were actively giving me a gift on the basis that I had followed the rules of my grounding when I hadn’t done that at all. I didn’t deserve this. I went on my phone all the time when I wasn’t supposed to. But they’d already gotten me the gift. Maybe I could convince them to get a refund. But how the hell was I going to do that without letting them know about how often I’d been on my phone when I wasn’t supposed to be?  I just stayed quiet. After all, they probably weren’t going to get a full refund from GameStop or wherever they had gotten it from anyway. They had already paid for it. I figured it would be better to just not let them know that they had wasted their money. There probably wasn’t anything they could do about it now, anyway.

Like I said, I didn’t feel bad about breaking my parents’ rules. But now that they were going out of their way to reward me for having followed their rules when I didn’t, I felt really off about the whole situation. I thought they’d just give me my stuff back and things would go back to normal. They shouldn’t have done all that for me. That night, even though the clock was on its same bullshit like usual, I couldn’t even worry about it. I stayed up until midnight playing Kingdom Hearts III on my switch since I figured I should at least give my parents their money’s worth if they already bought the thing and I did still want to check it out. But after the monster came and went, I spent a lot of time tossing and turning, wondering if I should just come clean about how I’d been using my phone while grounded.

The next day at school, I checked my locker for the post-it note. But it wasn’t there. Someone, for whatever reason, had found the post-it note, put it in my locker, and then had taken it back out. I assumed it was all just to fuck with me. I assumed Ezra had to have been behind this. Now that I had told him about the post-it note, I figured this was to be expected since he was always doing whatever he could to fuck with everybody.  But since I had a rational explanation for how the note ended up in my locker and how it got out, and one that was pretty likely to be true, I didn’t let the whole situation get to me. I don’t know how he found my locker, or how he picked the lock, but you know what? I wouldn’t put any of that past him. I knew I shouldn’t have talked to him at church.

Besides, I had someone more important to look for now, namely Anastasia Bowman. I shared my 6th period class with her, so hopefully I could find some time during class to bring up the note. But Anastasia was different from Truman and Ezra. She was a girl. And honestly, a pretty cute one too. Hearing the same things that Ezra or Truman said coming out of her mouth would seriously hit home a lot harder. It took a level of nerve that talking to the guys I had tried so far didn’t call for. But she was still my last hope for understanding what was happening. Between Truman, Ezra, and her, I couldn’t think of a single other person whom I could reasonably suspect to have interacted with the post-it note.

Unlike the guys I had tried getting into contact with, I didn’t really see Anastasia on my way to any classes. Not even to Environmental Science, the one we shared. She would always arrive to class so much sooner than me. Meaning her locker was probably pretty far away from mine since I always arrived so late thanks to how far away mine was from the classroom.

So the only time I’d get to talk to her would be during class itself. Not in between classes. Not after church service was over, like with Ezra. But while the teacher was talking. She didn’t even sit anywhere near me for that matter. Maybe if she sat next to me in that class, I could whisper over to her, but since she sat toward the front of the room, and I sat in the back row, that was literally impossible. Maybe I could catch up with her on her way out the door when class ended.

I spent the next couple of days working up the courage to talk to Anastasia to see if she could help me out, along with planning on how I would stop her and talk to her about what I needed to talk about. With her, I just seemed to have so many fewer possibilities. I literally never saw her outside of 6th period. That was the only place I was ever even around her. And since she was so close to the front of the room, she’d always be going off to her next class, wherever the hell that was, before I had even left that room. I had tried that day and the next, but both times I failed. And she always did all kinds of extracurricular activities after school. So that meant I couldn’t catch her on her way to the bus like I could with Truman.

By Thursday, I was ready to throw in the towel and just commit to finding out answers for myself. After all, why should I expect anybody else to help me? This is my problem, not theirs. As far as I knew, I was the only guy in the world going through what I was. I had spent the past nights surviving the way that I knew how, and it all seemed to be going pretty okay.

There was also the fact that I was being kept up at night with the guilt that I didn’t deserve the present my parents got for me. I couldn’t sleep and I was still being hounded by something I didn’t understand almost every night that I had every reason to believe was a major threat to my life. Even if I did ultimately know how to deal, for the most part, with whatever was going on with my clock, that was still obviously no fun. My point is, I had other shit aside from Anastasia to worry about, so I had kinda given up on getting any info out of her by then.

But later that day, the game changed completely when Mr. Brigham announced a class project. For our ecology unit, we had to put together this poster about the food chain. I guess all the animal life involved, what they eat, why they eat what they do, where they find it, all kinds of boring shit like that. I hate school projects, so at first I was seriously bummed out that I would have some big project due soon. Then, even better, I found out it would be a group project. Mr. Brigham was going to put us in pairs to do this thing. So it was going to be the sort of project that two people would have to pitch in for in order to get it done. And with my luck, I was gonna get someone who would pin all the work for 2 people onto just me.

I sat back and waited for Mr. Brigham to get to my name while he pulled out popsicle sticks from a cup with everyone’s name on them. He’d pick out one and then pair them up with whomever was next. This went on for a while until eventually he pulled out Anastasia’s stick. I immediately started paying close attention to whom she was about to get paired with. Because if she got paired with me, that could be the answer to all my prayers. Even if she didn’t know anything at all about the post-it note, if I got picked next, then I still got to do a project with a really cute girl like her. And ever since Truman had broken up with her the week before, she was single now too.

So when my name did actually get picked to be her partner, I wasn’t even thinking about how she could help me with the clock. I had had somewhat of a crush on her pretty much since the first day of school. And now, for the first time throughout the school year, she was single. And she was getting paired up with me. This just had to have been fate. Or at least, that was what I had convinced myself of. I knew it was silly. But I really just wanted to think that.

Mr. Brigham took our class down to the library which had all kinds of computers and stuff to do research on.  College High didn’t have the budget for laptops, so we all just had to make do with the desktops in the library and computer lab that were like a million years old. We were supposed to go on one of the websites from the list of websites our teacher gave us that each had something to do with the food chain. Different environments have different food chains, so it was pretty much up to us to decide on which part of nature we wanted to look at and study in order to find out science facts about its food chain.

Anastasia had suggested we look at what the food chain in a tropical marsh or wetland area would look like. Like the ones in places such as Florida. Apparently, those have all kinds of wildlife, making its food chain especially intricate and complicated. I didn’t know why she wanted to make this project more difficult than it had to be. Also, wetlands are pretty much the exact opposite climate from the one we live in. Out here in Alaska, it’s mostly a barren wasteland where hardly anything lives or grows. And that’s what we know. That’s what we’ve always lived with. The food chain of the Alaskan tundra had to be way simpler than all these tropical biomes with all kinds of complicated ecosystems that she was saying we should go for.

But, since my only objection to what she was saying pretty much solely rested on the fact that it all seemed like too much work and I didn’t want to look lazy or uneducated in front of Anastasia, I just decided to go along with it. After all, Anastasia at least seemed to know what she was doing. She was writing notes like crazy. I tried to just write down what seemed important and made sense to write down, but she had pages and pages full of I don’t even know what. I wanted to copy but, again, I didn’t want to look lazy or like I didn’t know what I was doing. So I just tried to keep up as best I could.

Once we had decided on our biome, it had pretty much all been taking notes from then on. I had hoped this would be an opportunity to talk and maybe even flirt some, or at least get some answers about my post-it note/app/clock situation. But class was almost over, and we hadn’t said a word to one another in a good 25 minutes or so. I knew I needed to act fast, so I just said the first thing that came to mind.

“Do you sit at that desk in Mrs. Bagfield’s room that has the little heart on it with “BT + AB” inside?” I asked pretty awkwardly. I was sort of stuttering and the words had all stumbled out all at once. I was so worried she’d have no idea what I meant.

“Yes. Back when Brian and I were together, I had inscribed a heart with our initials in it on that precise desk. Why do you ask?”, she asked.  Most people called Brian Truman by his last name, but because Anastasia had dated him, she had grown accustomed to referring to him by his first name.

“Well it’s just… kinda gotta be hard to be reminded of your ex-boyfriend and everything every time you go to her class”, I responded. I was still way too nervous to bring up the post-it note.

“Meh, not really”, she said, shrugging her shoulders a bit. “I believe the relationship had ran its natural course, quite frankly”, she responded pretty matter-of-factly. This was strange. Usually when someone gets dumped they’re torn up inside. It usually takes a while to emotionally recover. They usually need a shoulder to cry on or something. A shoulder that mine was supposed to be. But here she was, being totally cool about it.  I asked further.

“Well um… did you ever notice anything… else… about that desk?”, I tried. Anastasia almost seemed a bit taken aback by my question for a moment.

“Such as?” she responded.

“Well, there’s these letters and symbols and characters and stuff on this post-it note and um…” I stopped after that. Anastasia was usually pretty calm and collected. Apparently even after being broken up with. And on Valentine’s Day, no less. But now, she seemed to be pretty seriously concerned. Were my questions really that weird? Did I really seem that crazy to other people?

In the silence, the bell to let us out of 6th period rang. Anastasia reached into her backpack, pulled out a notebook and pulled a loose-leaf piece of paper out of it. She started writing and handed it over to me. It had an address on it. She specified that it was hers. The paper also read “Meet here 2:05AM Sat. 2/23”.
