I don't know where to begin with this story because I can't tell whether I should be afraid or not. I figured this would at least entertain some people so I'll start from why I was in this situation. I live with my parents and they were raised in the south and are strict parents. Me being the 21 year old I am I  always gets into fights with them over stuff like my life such as curfews, how I spend my money, etc. One day we got into an argument about how I was not a good "kid" even though I am basically a grown ass man and that me not being able to drive was causing issues for my mom who I pay to drive me to work (Because I have a fear of driving and accidentally harming someone or myself). 

At one point some things were said mainly by me which resulted in me getting kicked out for the night. I was used to this though because it has happened 3 times before so I decided to finally walk to a park which was about 4 miles down the road or about an hour and a half walk if you want a time idea. I started my walk at around 3pm and stayed at the park till around 6pm because I wanted to be able to get home before it was late and completely dark. 

Just to explain for the rest of the story I live in the country and out here we live next to highway 231 which has a few roads that go into neighborhoods in patches of the woods so it's not that random for there to be a good amount of traffic coming through however between some of the neighborhoods is a distance of woods that aren't exactly thick but more like fields of bushes and tiny tress struggling to grow if that makes sense.

 Anyways I began to walk home and as I did I would have a car pass by now and then that would blind the hell out of me with its lights because let's face it Florida drivers don't give a crap about anything. After about 45 minutes of blinding lights and honks from jerks I put my headphones in but kept one out for obvious reasons and turned on some nice tunes while kicking pebbles and other kinds of junk on the side of the road as a way of entertaining myself. At some point I heard what sounded like pebbles being crushed under tires and turned around to see a vehicle. I'm not good with cars but I can basically describe what it looked like. It was a green Chevy kinda truck. I don't know what they're called but it's like a pick up with some kind of cover with windows on top of the tail gate kinda looking thing ( I know I'm dumb). The car was slowly driving behind me with its lights off so I had no idea it was coming from behind me at any point till the noise so I don't know how long it was following me. Clearly I was creeped out because it's nearly 8pm and some creepy car is following me on a dark empty highway on a full moon night so I began to walk faster immediately in a panic but not trying to give off the idea I was scared ( I don't know why but I thought if I didn't give them the idea I was scared maybe they wouldn't mess with me) after a couple of minutes a car from the opposite direction was coming towards us with it's lights on which I can only assume scared the driver of the vehicle off because he picked up speed and drove off into the night. 

Unfortunately I can't for sure say it was a male or give a discription because the windows were tinted but Right after all this happened I decided I would continue my walk off the side of the high way and through Abit of the brush on  edge of the road so that if the vehicle came by again I could hide but it never did thank goodness. Sometimes I wonder if I was almost kidnapped or if they were simply a person trying to help someone they thought needed a ride. But why have the lights off and not say anything or even roll your windows down. It gives me shivers thinking about it right now because I have always heard or read about this kind of stuff but it's way worse when you experience it yourself. for anyone who is thinking why I didn't call the cops well it's because I didn't really know if I should've and even if I did what evidence would I of had. I even told my parents who didnt seem to care. Should I have been as worried as I was or what? 

I wanna thank anyone who reads this and I'm sorry for my terrible grammar I'm not a writing kind of person but I wanted to share this experience.
