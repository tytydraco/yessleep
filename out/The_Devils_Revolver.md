On the fourth day of my six-day backpacking trip through the Mojave Desert, I saw a pile of ash off the beaten path.

Old campfire sites are a common sight on a multi-day hike, but something about this one caught my eye.

A reflective black rock was resting on top of the ash. It looked like a meteorite. Curious, I approached and picked it up. It was small enough to hold in one hand, and slightly warm to the touch.

Immediately, I realized it was a tablet. Not the new kind of tablet, obviously, but an ancient-looking stone tablet with writing on it.

The engraving was in a dark red—slightly lighter than the pitch-black stone it was engraved on—and almost seemed to glow in the scorching midday sun. It didn't seem to be in English, but, oddly, I could read its message easily. Somehow, its text became perfectly legible when I concentrated on the strange letters.

This was what I read:

---

-TYRANT UPON THY THRONE-

-SOVEREIGN OF NOTHING-

-MAY DEATH AND ASH-

-HERALD THY RETURN-

---

I looked down at the ominous stone tablet, uneasy. It creeped me out.

*Who left this here?* I wondered, unsettled. *What a bizarre find.*

I shrugged, put it in my pack, and was about to walk away when I saw something else.

Removing the tablet revealed something beneath. I brushed the ash off—without picking it up—to see what it was.

A gun.

I gazed down, incredulously, at a huge, black revolver. A veritable hand cannon that seemed to be made out of the same meteorite as the tablet. The grip was a cloudy gray and blended in with the ash. It looked unique— and *extremely* expensive.

Now this was an *incredible* find. Who would leave a collector's gun in the ashes of a campfire?

I wiped the sweat from my eyes, took a swig of water from my canteen, and dropped my backpack off to the side. This deserved my full attention.

Crouching down, I wrapped my right hand around the grip of the revolver and carefully pulled it from the ash.

It was heavy, but felt perfect in my hand. In fact, I felt better just by holding it. My fatigue from walking in the blistering heat started to fade away. I couldn't feel the soreness in my legs. My thoughts were clearer.

I wasn't a gun nut or anything, but my friends had taken me to a shooting range a few times, so I knew how to use one. I thumbed the cylinder release and flicked my wrist to swing it out.

There were six chambers in the revolver's cylinder, and none of them were loaded... but one chamber was dark. A strange shadow where a bullet would have been. I couldn't see my hand through the chamber when I waved it on the other side. *Weird,* I thought.

I swung the cylinder shut and held the mysterious revolver in my hand for another minute, just enjoying the feel of it. It really was a nice gun, and I was definitely taking it with me. Maybe I'd become a gun nut after all. I went to put it in my pack.

With my hand inside the backpack, I tried to let go of the revolver.

I couldn't let go.

*Huh?*

I tried shaking it out of my hand. It wouldn't come off.

Panicking, I took my right hand out of the pack and tried to pry the gun off with my left.

*Is it covered in glue?* I thought, increasingly concerned for the skin of my palm. *Why can't I let go?*

I sat down and struggled with it, gritting my teeth as I tried to free my hand.

*Come on,* I thought, muscles straining. *Get off. Get off! GET. OFF—*

The revolver disappeared.

My left arm was almost dislocated as the object I was pulling on stopped existing.

I blinked.

I raised my empty right hand.

I stared at it.

I slowly opened and closed it a few times.

Silence.

"What the hell—"

The sun disappeared and everything plunged into darkness.

"—is going on?" I said to myself, before jumping to my feet in shock. Adrenaline flooded my body, overpowering a sudden wave of exhaustion that hit me at the same time.

The desert was gone; I stood on cobblestone. The sunlight was gone; it was pitch dark.

I was somewhere else.

I froze for a moment, dumbfounded, as my brain tried to process all of the impossible things happening to me.

My hands were shaking. I was hyperventilating.

*What...* I thought slowly, *...what just happened?*

I was freaking out.

*Where is the gun?*

*Where is my backpack?*

*Where did the desert go?*

The most important question occurred to me.

*Where am I?*

I whipped my head around in every direction.

*WHERE AM I?!* My heart was racing.

It looked like I was in the middle of a deserted city, on a cobblestone street lined with old, weathered brick houses. There were no sidewalks, telephone wires, light poles, or anything a modern city would have. It was like I had gone backwards through time.

There were no lights anywhere. No fires, no lanterns, no lit windows. It was a ghost town.

I looked up, and saw only darkness. No stars, no moon. Nothing. It was just pitch black, *everywhere*. I didn't know how I was even able to see, but I wasn't in the state of mind to dwell on that.

*Am I underground?* I thought, still panicking. *Why am I here? HOW?!*

I was overwhelmed. It was too much. What was I going to do?

I doubled over, hands on my knees, trying to control my breathing. I needed to calm down. I needed to figure this out. There was a rational explanation... somewhere. I had to find it.

After a minute, I had mostly recovered. I took my hands from my knees and straightened up.

My first thought was to look for help. I needed someone to tell me where I was. They could give me directions, and possibly an explanation for how I got here.

*"Hello?"* I called out tentatively, praying that this city wasn't truly abandoned. *"Is anyone there?"*

Dead silence.

An unnatural chill went down my spine.

Dread. I felt it growing from every direction. Like a thousand hands pressing down on me from all sides. An unnatural feeling, almost like a sixth sense. A sense of danger.

I needed to get out of this city. Now. Something was wrong here.

I started jogging towards an intersection I could see in the distance. There had to be more in this city than the houses surrounding me. Maybe I could find a way out by myself.

Passing by an alley, I caught a glimpse of something that may have been a large rat scurrying away. I didn't stop to look.

Once I reached the three-way intersection, I could see down the two streets that branched off to the sides.

More houses. I must have been in the suburbs of the city, and I had no idea which direction would get me out of them.

It was time to explore one of the houses. There might be a clue to where I was. Aside from that, I was curious to see if people had ever lived here.

Walking up to the brick house facing the intersection, I stopped in front of its plain wooden door.

Not expecting an answer, I knocked. It was better to be safe in case someone was actually in there.

To my surprise, someone answered.

*"Come in!"* a jovial man's voice called out from inside. *"Please, come in! I can't come to the door!"*

Slightly relieved to hear a friendly voice in this oppressive place, I opened the door and went in.

What I saw when I entered the foyer was refreshingly normal: a small coat rack, shoes on the floor, a mat to wipe your feet, and an umbrella resting next to the door. I could see the living room ahead of me. These houses weren't abandoned after all. I closed the front door.

"Please, make yourself comfortable!" the boisterous voice exclaimed from a different room. "You'll have to forgive me, I wasn't expecting guests! You caught me making dinner— please, just take a seat in the living room."

His voice had an overwhelming charisma to it. I felt like this guy made friends as easily as he breathed. Someone who could make anyone laugh—who brightened a room just by their presence. I could almost hear his smile.

"Thank you!" I called out as I stepped into the living room. "I'm a bit lost, and could use some help."

"Of course!" he replied. I heard sounds of cutlery. "Always happy to help someone in need. Just a moment!"

I took in the living room as I waited. I still felt uneasy, but what I saw calmed me down a bit.

There were two small couches facing each other in the center of the room. Glass coffee tables topped with ashtrays were in front of both. Lining the walls were bookcases and landscape paintings, and the wall facing the street had two windows.

It was a perfect room to relax and socialize with others, which fit the general impression I had of my host.

Behind me, I heard a noise.

I turned around—and recoiled in horror.

He was standing in a doorway, holding a butcher's cleaver.

It wasn't the cleaver that frightened me. It was his face. Or the lack of one. He had no eyes, nose, or mouth. Instead, a vertical opening full of bristling, razor-sharp teeth split his face in two.

I jumped backwards and screamed, "GET BACK!" This was a nightmare. "GET AWAY FROM ME!"

He took a step forward.

"Please, relax," he said in a comforting voice. His "mouth" quivered hideously as he spoke. "Don't worry. I'm here to help you."

My body was shaking from fear. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't think.

"STOP!" I shouted frantically as I took another step back. I had to do something. I had to do something *now*.

I put my right hand behind my back. "I'LL SHOOT YOU!" I screamed, voice cracking. "I HAVE A GUN!" It was a bluff, but I wished it were true. I desperately needed the gun right now.

Suddenly, my right hand was weighed down, wrapping around a familiar grip.

Not questioning this miracle, I pulled the black revolver from behind my back and quickly leveled it at him.

"DON'T MOVE!" I yelled. The gun wasn't loaded, but I prayed it was enough to scare him off.

He cocked his head to the side as he considered the large revolver trained on him. "This is just a big misunderstanding," he said, reasonably. He shrugged and held out the cleaver. "It's not what it looks like."

He took another step forward.

I hesitated.

Faster than I could blink, he lunged at me.

With a merciless swing of his cleaver, he chopped off my right hand, sending it flying. The revolver disappeared.

*"AAAAHHHHHH!"* I cried out in shock and terror—the pain hadn't hit me yet—as I stumbled backwards, my hand replaced by a geyser of blood. I tripped on a coffee table and crashed through it, shattering the glass and landing on my back.

The monster wasn't wasting time—he immediately recovered from his brutal attack and jumped forward to finish me off.

His cleaver was raised high as he bore down on me. His vertical maw was fully opened, revealing dozens of viciously sharp teeth. He was eerily silent as he brought the cleaver down.

My death was imminent. My thoughts were frozen by fear. I screamed, watching the smooth arc of his cleaver as it approached my face. I uselessly put up my remaining hand to protect myself, even as I realized it was futile.

I acted by reflex.

The black revolver appeared in my left hand and I pulled the trigger.

**—BOOM—**

All of the furniture in the room exploded into a hail of splinters. The windows shattered. The floor cracked around me and the building shook. The air in the room became a gale as it fled in terror. It was so loud that my eardrums should have burst. It was so bright that my retinas should have fried. It was so powerful that the recoil should have ripped my arm off.

A path of annihilation about two feet wide began at the muzzle of the barrel and ended in the sky, which was now visible through the gaping hole in the ceiling. Everything in that path had turned to dust.

Half of the monster's body had simply disappeared. The rest became a spray of gore and bloody mist from the muzzle blast, splattering around the room. His cleaver—inches from my face—was thrown from his obliterated fingers, and its mangled remnants were embedded into one of the brick walls.

Shell-shocked, I lurched to my feet. I staggered to the front door before the dust could settle. The stump of my missing right hand was still bleeding—the pain creeping in—and I pressed it into my left armpit. My revolver hung heavy by my side as I gripped it tight.

I threw the front door open—and froze. My ragged breath caught. What I saw had stopped me cold.

Blood from my wound rolled down my good arm, my white-knuckled hand, the revolver, and dripped to the ground as I took it all in.

Demons. That was the only way I could describe them. They were completely surrounding the empty intersection in front of me.

A horde. An army. Filling the streets. Crowding shoulder-to-shoulder, as far as the eye could see. Demons.

Most were the split-faced monstrosities like the one I had just killed, but I could see other kinds scattered among them.

I saw dozens of skinless people, slick with blood and frightening with their rictus grins. Exposed muscles visibly coiled and uncoiled with every movement. They twitched erratically and their lidless stares were hungry.

Some jumbled masses of writhing tentacles the size of dogs were floating a few feet off the ground. They bobbed up and down in a bizarre rhythm, and I couldn't tell how deadly they were.

Two or three tall, thin humanoids resembling stick figures towered over the demons near them. Their spindly, long arms narrowed down to evil points that could easily spear through a chest. Where a face should have been was an empty cavity that exposed their hollow heads.

I saw at least one gigantic spider, larger than a bear, with no eyes. It was pale, hairy, and had huge, arm-length fangs. Disgusting holes covered its entire body, and countless "baby" spiders—the size of tarantulas—were crawling in and out of them.

There were more, but my concentration was broken.

Whispers.

I didn't hear them with my ears. The whispers were in my head. An insidious susurration of seemingly thousands of people. None of it made sense—it was maddening. It was impossible to ignore. I could tell, somehow, that they were coming from behind me, on the other side of the house.

At that same moment, the dread I was feeling from every direction suddenly spiked from the place the whispers originated. I knew instinctively that it was far more dangerous than every demon in front of me combined. The whispers were getting louder.

I ran away from it to the only place I could: the empty intersection. None of the demons made a move on me.

When I looked behind me and over the house—

I saw it. It was flying. It was gigantic.

And it was the single most terrifying thing I had ever seen in my entire life. My heart thundered in my ears.

I didn't even think. I raised the revolver and fired three times.

**—BOOM—** An explosion of light broke the darkness. Cobblestone on the ground shook loose in front of me. Dust went flying across the street.

**—BOOM—** Pieces of cobblestone were thrown so forcefully by the muzzle blast that they became projectiles; windows shattered and demons raised arms to defend themselves.

**—BOOM—** A maelstrom surrounded me as the air desperately kept trying to return, only to be blown away once again. Dirt under the stripped cobblestone was kicked up into the air.

Silence. The whispers stopped. Dust swirled, obscuring my vision.

*I killed it,* I thought, praying. *Please let it be dead.*

The dust settled.

It was completely unharmed.

The *thing* flying in the air defied description. It was an abomination. Even the smallest attempt to understand its form would impart a lifetime of crippling nightmares. It was anathema to the human mind.

If I had to define it in that moment, I would say that it was vaguely humanoid in shape. It had an uncountable number of tendrils surrounding it that seemed to phase in and out of existence in a meaningless pattern. I couldn't describe what color the tendrils were or what they were made of, because I had never seen any color or material like it before. It was alien.

None of that was noteworthy compared to the center of its body.

There, I saw the Abyss.

A maw of Hell.

It wasn't black. It was Nothing. An unfathomable absence. It was the opposite of looking at the Sun. It didn't overwhelm the eyes. It took from them. It stole something from the mind. In that moment, I knew that the gun was protecting me somehow. I knew that if a normal person had looked directly into that void, they would have instantly gone insane. A slave to unspeakable madness— forever.

The silence was broken.

***FRAGMENT BEARER***

I screamed. A sickening spike of pure agony was being driven behind my eyes. The *thing*'s whispers had combined into an infernal roar.

***ASPIRANT TO THE ASHEN THRONE***

I felt like my skull was going to shatter. It was a cacophony of the damned; a million raging souls, piercing my mind.

***WE REJECT THY CLAIM***

"WAIT!" I managed to cry out, pushing through the pain. This *thing* seemed to be intelligent, and I was desperate. "YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG—"

***PERISH***

I was in the center of a three-way intersection, at the top of the "T", with one street ahead of me and the others on my left and right.

All three streets were choked with demons.

Every single one of them came for me at the same time.

I was too numb from everything happening to freeze in terror. I felt it—as I watched hundreds, maybe even thousands of demons charging, I felt it—but in that split second, all that mattered was survival.

I wasn't going to double back into the house. Letting that *thing* get to me would be worse than death. I was absolutely certain of this. At that moment, it was slowly flying towards me. My only option was to get away from it.

Through the demons.

**—BOOM—** Like a wave parting the sea, I shot a massive hole straight ahead down the street. The demons who weren't hit were thrown or tripped up as their friends exploded next to them.

I ran forwards and to the right, toward a backyard wall on the corner. My right arm was making it hard to run. I had to keep it pressed against me or I'd bleed out. My shirt was already soaked with blood.

**—BOOM—** Light and thunder erupted from the revolver as demons to my right stopped existing. Even though I shot with my left hand, the gun was so powerful that I only had to aim in their general direction.

The path ahead was now clear, but I was still being chased from behind. I needed to move, fast.

**—BOOM—** I shot through the wall in front of me, reducing it to rubble.

My hastily made plan was to shoot through the backyard wall, run around the house, and keep going from there.

However, I underestimated the black revolver. It shot through the wall *and* the house. And the house across the street. And the wall behind that. And the house behind that...

**—BOOM—** Windows shattered into a million pieces. **—BOOM—** Bricks turned to dust. **—BOOM—** Wood exploded into splinters.

I enlarged the hole so that I could run in a straight line through everything. I twisted as I ran—almost tripping—and fired behind me to slow down my pursuers. **—BOOM—** I didn't have time to see the results.

I ran. Through houses, backyards, and streets—I ran. My breath was getting heavier. Pain and blood loss were hitting me now. The whispers were still loud in my head. I was miserable, and I had to force my legs to keep moving. Only fear and my will to live kept me going.

I was shooting behind me to keep the demons off, trying to get a lead on them. I almost collapsed a wall and buried myself when I fired next to it, but my plan was otherwise working. I was going to escape.

I was running through another house when a skinless man hiding in a bedroom lunged at me.

My reaction time was impaired by blood loss and overexertion, so I couldn't dodge. He knocked me off my feet and his sharp talons raked across my face. I was so tired. My gun was wedged between us, so when I pulled the trigger **—BOOM—** he turned to paste.

I grit my teeth, painfully rose to my feet, and made it out of the house.

Demons were waiting. They were flooding the street and the houses in front of me.

They had cut me off. I was surrounded. I couldn't run any longer.

Panicking, I began firing wildly. **—BOOM—** A dozen demons died. **—BOOM—** I missed, and the front of a house exploded, raining bricks. **—BOOM—** A demon jumping at me from the side was blown apart by the muzzle blast. **—BOOM—** Another miss, this one hitting the sky. **—BOOM—** It directly impacted the cobblestone street, sending rocky shrapnel flying and shredding nearby demons. The hole it created went all the way down to bedrock.

I cleared an area in the middle of the street and staggered over to it.

I swung around like a madman, shooting, trying to keep the demons away. They were trickling in faster now, from all directions. I couldn't do this forever.

*I have to get out,* I thought, despairing. *I have to find a way out.*

**—BOOM—** Demons emerging from an alley were blown away, along with half of the alley itself.

*How did I even get here?* My thoughts were all over the place as dust and destruction filled my vision. *What did I do?*

There was a brief moment of respite as I thinned out the approaching horde.

*Was it just because I picked up the gun?* I was concentrating on this problem like my life depended on it—because it did. *Was it because I looked in the cylinder?*

Something appeared down the street. It was some kind of disturbingly-shaped person.

**—BOOM—**

It kept running.

*I must have missed,* I thought.

**—BOOM—** My finger was numb on the trigger. **—BOOM—** I steadied my aim. **—BOOM—**

I didn't miss.

It wasn't stopping, and it was getting larger. I could see it clearly now.

It wasn't the size of a normal man. It was a titan. As tall as a house, and half as wide. It looked incredibly muscular, but I suddenly realized why its shape was so odd.

It was made out of faces.

An abomination, comprised of nothing but human faces at different angles to each other. All of them with their eyes and mouths hideously open, as if they were trapped in an eternal scream of fear. Its fingers were human tongues, overlapping and quivering.

My bullets—or whatever the revolver was firing—only scratched it, drawing a pathetic amount of blood.

It was fast. Too fast to outrun.

The whispers were getting louder. The *thing* was also closing in.

I was shaking again and paralyzed in horror when I suddenly remembered something.

*I said 'what the hell',* I realized. *I got here after I said the word 'hell'.* I snapped out of my frozen state.

"TAKE ME BACK!" I shouted, praying I could say something that would let me escape.

The army of demons had been gathering together behind the houses, and now they swarmed at me in a tidal wave of death.

**—BOOM—** "TAKE ME—" I frantically swung around in every direction, trying to kill the faster ones before they could reach me. **—BOOM—** —HOME!" I screamed.

The many-faced nightmare was five houses away. I could see the *thing* in the air out of the corner of my eye; its whispers were becoming screams.

"TAKE—" **—BOOM—** I was mowing demons down, my finger flickering on the trigger. **—BOOM—** By the tens. **—BOOM—** By the hundreds.

"—ME—" **—BOOM—** I was surrounded by a crater formed by the revolver's apocalyptic power. **—BOOM—** Every shot shook the world. **—BOOM—** Blood fell like rain.

"—TO—" **—BOOM—** Demons were closing in on all sides. **—BOOM—** The titan jumped for me, tongued fingers extended. **—BOOM—** A tendril melted into existence and whipped at my throat. **—BOOM—**

I cried out desperately, *"—EARTH!"*

Instantly, I was back in the desert. The stars shone down from the night sky overhead.

I fell to my knees, and my outstretched hand, white-knuckling the revolver, fell limp at my side. A sudden wave of exhaustion hit me. Combined with the exhaustion I had already been feeling, I was about to pass out.

Dismissing the revolver—I could do it as easily as breathing now—I crawled over to my pack, which was still on the ground next to the pile of ash.

I was too tired to be alarmed by the scorpion crawling over it. I flicked it off and rested my head on the backpack. My stump was—mercifully—no longer bleeding.

Drenched in demon blood, I lost consciousness.

When I woke the next morning, I pushed myself up.

With my right hand.

---

The hike back to the trailhead was easy. Too easy. In fact, I felt better the longer I walked. Something about the gun had improved my body and senses.

My legs didn't ache, I didn't sweat, and I didn't have to drink as much water. I could see and hear much farther than before, and in greater clarity. I felt like I could look at the Sun without going blind, but I didn't try.

Only after I drove back to my house—and washed off the filth covering me—could I finally relax. Never had I felt such relief at coming home. Everything I had been through could almost be written off as a horrifying nightmare. I restrained myself from summoning the black revolver.

My new hand is a constant reminder of the truth, however. It's stronger. Much stronger. As I sit here, I have to be careful with the keys on the keyboard. I shattered my coffee cup this morning by accident when I picked it up.

It's warm to the touch, and looks different too. It's less... skin-like. It has a weird texture that reminds me of scales. And it has a slightly red color. A subtle dark red that fades in a gradient as it approaches the skin tone of my wrist.

I don't know what's happening to me, but I know the revolver is responsible. After reflecting on my experiences, I know that I've been wrapped up in some kind of struggle for a "throne." Whose throne? I was sent to that place when I said "hell," so I'm afraid I already know the answer.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do now. I thought I could simply put all of this behind me...

...but in the last thirty minutes, I've started to feel that unnatural sense of dread—of danger—from somewhere far away. That feeling is growing.

Whatever is causing it... is getting [closer](https://www.reddit.com/u/leadraine/s/okZ9uNK6Mp).
