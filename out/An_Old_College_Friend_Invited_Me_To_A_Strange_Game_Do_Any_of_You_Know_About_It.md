Hello everyone, it is with apprehension that I begin to record this unique experience. My name is Daniel, and this is the story of how I was invited to participate in the enigmatic "Midnight Game." Before anything else, it is important to inform that no sensitive data here (such as names, addresses, etc.) is real. I used nicknames and censored certain details to avoid exposing third-party privacy. Another point is that I decided to report these events here to get some tips before the game. Maybe someone knows about it and can give me some tricks.  
  
It all started this past weekend when a letter arrived in my mailbox, capturing my attention from the first moment: an envelope with an old appearance, slightly yellowed at the edges, sealed with an unknown emblem melted in red wax. It contained an invitation whose sender was an old college friend, Gabriel. The body of the letter was as follows:

\----------------------  
  
*Dear Daniel,*  
  
*I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits. I am writing to invite you to participate in a unique and unforgettable experience, the "Midnight Game." Although we haven't spoken in a while, I still cherish good memories of our friendship, and it would be an honor to have you as part of this intriguing journey.*  
  
*Together, two other classmates have also decided to join the game, Julia and Richard, and it was Richard's idea to send you this letter.*  
  
*The "Midnight Game" will take place in a discreet location, away from conventional trails. The opportunity that presents itself is unique, and I am sure that the experience could be a valuable addition to your creative repertoire. Perhaps you will write another masterpiece about this "adventure"?*  
  
*I ask for absolute discretion regarding this invitation. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SHARE THE ADDRESS I WILL SEND YOU OR THE ROUTE TO FOLLOW.*  
  
*Ps: Attached to this document is the list of rules. I believe it would be good for you to keep them in mind when you enter. The game will start as soon as everyone arrives, and considering that I have already contacted the other two, and they are already on their way here, I suggest that as soon as this letter reaches your hands, you also get ready.*  
  
*Yours truly and at your service,*  
*Gabriel*

I'm a dedicated writer, working on chronicles for the local newspaper and trying to make a breakthrough with some books. Gabriel always praises my writings, even if it often sounds more like a friendly consolation for my lack of success.  
  
As mentioned, there was also an attached set of rules, which said the following:

\-------------------------  
  
***1- Abandon reason upon entering the game. Trust only intuition.*** 

*Reason is the first victim of the unknown. Trust your deepest instincts, even if they seem to contradict logic. Overthinking can result in headaches, nausea, vomiting, and induce breaking other rules. Do not question, obey.*  
  
***2- Stay in total darkness after the midnight signal. Light is prohibited.*** 

*Darkness is a veil between worlds, fertile ground for the unknown to thrive. Light reveals but also attracts. In darkness, we are invisible but vulnerable. The truth hides in the shadows.*  
  
***3- Avoid the invisible observers; their curiosity is your greatest threat.*** 

*There are entities that observe from unreachable planes. Curiosity can attract their attention, and once noticed, the observers can become unwanted participants in the game. Invisible eyes see more than we imagine.*  
  
***4- Walk to the designated point when you hear the whisper of the wind.*** 

*During the game, you may hear a whisper. It requires well-trained ears as it can be either a trap or assistance. Follow the whisper of the gentle breeze, avoiding the seductive and hoarse voice. You will know when it happens.*  
  
***5- Do not invite those who have not received an invitation to the game.*** 

*The participation of the uninitiated can trigger forces beyond understanding against them and against you. Say you're going on a trip, taking a vacation, a business meeting, etc.*  
  
***6- Keep your eyes open for partially open doors.*** 

*Partially open doors, especially in the dark, are dangerous traps. You never know what might jump at you or who might be observing you behind them.*  
  
***7- At sunrise, return to the starting point.*** 

*The game only ends when everyone returns. The return to the starting point is the seal that closes the pact. Sunrise is the limit. All remaining participants must return so that the game ends.*

Most of these instructions are vague, very enigmatic. I genuinely considered it might be one of Gabriel's experiences, a themed party. I remembered an episode of a cartoon where a character's party was a simulated criminal investigation. It was a good show. Anyway, he sure knows how to grab a writer's attention. In a few hours, I had gathered some things, packed my backpack, and was getting into my car, heading to the indicated location. As the rules stated (and as I explained at the beginning), I won't use names that make the place obvious, just a vague description: I drove for an hour on an eastbound interstate highway, took a small left exit, an asphalt road that continued for about 15 km until it became a dirt road. The lighting poles were almost nonexistent, maintaining a kilometric distance between them. The sun was preparing to rest, having the mountains as its bed, when I arrived at my destination.  
  
A sturdy two-story house, colonial wooden construction with good structure. Despite some dusty corners and cobwebs here and there, the state of preservation was good. It was possible to see the light from one of the upstairs rooms. I parked and took out my cell phone, but before unlocking the screen, a hand knocked on my window. I raised my head and could see Julia waiting outside.

She was one of our classmates, and although we didn't interact much, she was one of the best in the class. I remember a writing exercise we did on medieval literature; she wrote a poem in Latin from scratch, addressing Arthurian legends. She even received an award for it.

Her hair was, as I remembered, tied in a bun. She was wearing a black t-shirt with something I couldn't recognize, and a red checkered shirt on top.  
  
**J** \- Hey, man! - She knocked again on my window - I thought you weren't coming.  
  
**D** (me) - I was considering that possibility - I opened the car door and greeted her - But Gabriel is really convincing when he wants to be.  
  
**J** \- Tell me about it. We're already getting things ready for the game; we're right over there - She pointed to a small trail, almost invisible, in the bushes - Just waiting for you.  
  
I hesitated for a moment; I don't know why. Maybe I chickened out when I saw the forest in the weak twilight light fading away. I stopped for a few seconds until I snapped out of this trance, with Julia waving her open palm in front of me.  
  
**J** \- Anyone there?  
  
**D** \- Oh, yes, sure. Well, I'll just grab my backpack and lock the car. You can go ahead; I'll catch up.  
  
**J** \- It's good to go; it's getting cold, and I don't want to catch a cold here - She grumbled while walking towards the trail. She stopped when she reached the edge, turned around, pointed to her eyes with two fingers, then to mine, in a classic "I've got my eyes on you" sign, and then entered.  
  
I had to dismiss her since I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of her. I dialed Gabriel's number on my phone, hoping Julia hadn't arrived there yet.  
  
**G** \- Dani? Did you arrive, man? Is everything okay?  
  
**D** \- Look, man... Julia just came here to call me to go to the trail next to us. Are you guys pulling a prank, or maybe she...  
  
The idea that I didn't catch the signal well and missed the chance for something more interesting in the woods passed through my mind.  
  
**G** \- What? Julia? Are you kidding me? I was on the phone with her just now. She had a detour to pick up Rick; his car is in the shop, so they're coming together.  
  
My stomach gurgled. I ran into the house, still on the phone with him, closing the door as fast as I could behind me. I explained the situation to him, which seemed strangely excited.  
  
**G** \- That's what he said might happen - He said while scratching the blonde hairs of his beard.  
  
**D** \- He... who?  
  
**G** \- I don't know - He shrugged - The guy who wrote about the game. I found some papers about it when I came on an excursion around these parts. He detailed the rules and told a bit about his experience in this. He talked about how something might appear as one of the other participants until they arrived. That's why I'm here at home, only going to check when they call me on the phone.  
  
**D** \- The "thing" appeared to you too?  
  
**G** \- No, unfortunately. - He seemed really sad about it - But you're pretty lucky; the author said that happens when he likes someone. It looks like you'll have a good game.  
  
I don't know how to feel about it. Should I give up? Can I give up? I don't know; maybe it's too late. I'm writing this as a kind of diary. In case something happens to me, at least they'll know what happened. And if I stand firm until the end, well, maybe this time, I can write a bestseller?
