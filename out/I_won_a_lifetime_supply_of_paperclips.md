The one thing I could probably live without, and I won the grand prize.

I enter a lot of competitions like these. The only other times I had won something was £5 off at a local restaurant, and a raffle at a Christmas fair. I won a life-size chocolate Santa for that raffle. It was actually really nice, high-quality chocolate.

I don't remember entering this paperclip competition, but me and my friends do dumb things when we're drunk sometimes. Entering a stupid competition didn't seem out of the realm of possibilities.

It started when I received a single envelope, full of paperclips. There were easily 100, at least. Probably more. You can imagine my confusion when I opened this first one - No letter inside, only paperclips. Red, green, blue, yellow, pink, black, white... It almost looked like something you'd sprinkle onto a cake as they poured down to my feet, pitter-pattering on the wooden hall floor.

I rolled my eyes and cleaned up. I figured an office had put the wrong address for a supply delivery.

One shipment of 100 paperclips is odd. But 2? That's where I got suspicious.

The second day had me question whether this was some form of prank. I was smarter this time, though - I recognised the weight and feel of the envelope. I recognised the outline of paperclips as I held it up to the light. I didn't let them spill out at my feet - Although, my curiosity still had me open it to peek inside. You'd do the same. "Is it really just paperclips?" Yes. Yes it is.

By the fifth day, I had stopped opening it. I'd just briefly hold it up to the light to confirm the outline looked like paperclips, and then I'd toss it.

I don't remember why I checked my spam folder in my emails, but when I took a look, I immediately saw it. The cheesy headline stood out. "Clip-pity Clop, You've Won the Lifetime Paperclip Jack-pot! 🎉📎"

Below is the rest of the email.

I'll save you the fun-facts section, as it's not very "fun". Although I did learn that they've been around since the 1800s.

The only interesting thing that this email gave me was a company name - Clipogenics. I promptly sent an email back asking that my prize be transferred to someone else. My exact words were "someone more in need of paperclips," although thinking about it, I'm not sure who that could possibly apply to.

Spoiler alert: They did not reply, and the envelopes kept on coming.

2 weeks went by; I was still receiving paperclips.

6 weeks went by; nothing changed.

A few weeks ago was the 3-month mark. Over 90 days of paperclips. Yes, I had considered selling them, but I really don't know how much money I could make. Also, yes, they even arrived on Sundays. I could not understand who was delivering these. I never caught them, although I assumed the person posting them had no association with the company themselves, so talking to them is never something I attempted.

Around that 3-month mark, I was going through my normal daily routine. Make a cup of coffee, pick up the envelope from the hallway floor, hold it up against a light, and toss it in the bin. Only this time, the light revealed the outline of 1 single paperclip, and something else. I have to admit, deep down, part of me was almost excited. A real-life plot twist? Something to spice up an otherwise mundane part of my day? Curveballs are usually exciting to me, and this was no exception. I reached inside, pulling the mystery object out. What could they possibly have sent me?

A severed finger.

A dry, almost slightly green, severed finger.

I'm not sure which happened first - My scream, or dropping the finger to the floor.

I noticed only then that the paperclip was lodged under the fingernail, piercing right through the flesh. It was golden this time - A colour I had not been sent before. I'd like to say I stayed calm, but I didn't - I ran to the bathroom to throw up.

I contacted the police, and they took the finger and envelope away. I explained everything that I knew, and showed them the email - They told me that they'd investigate.

"It's crazy, isn't it?" - One of the police officers began his thought to me.

"What?"

"How dangerous simple production can be. Some poor sod has lost a finger over something as simple as a paperclip!"

"You think it was an accident?" - I don't know what exactly I thought it was. A threat, maybe? I'm still not sure.

"Of course. Probably someone on the production line packaging these things. Finger gets caught in machinery, 'Ahh, no, whoops!', and before you know it the finger's lost. The weight of the finger makes the machine think the envelope is now full of paperclips, and off it goes to your door."

Somehow a calm explanation of this situation actually helped me. Hell, it almost convinced me that it was just *normal*. I was assured, though, that the company was at fault for health & safety, and that something would be done about this.

A couple of weeks went by, and the police hadn't contacted me with any new information. The envelopes kept coming daily, but I was too afraid to open them. For fear of tossing away evidence, though, I kept them piled up in the corner.

As the pile grew taller, I decided to bite the bullet and open them, but not before carefully inspecting each one.

My hands shaking, I held the first up to the light, and it was just full of paperclips. Perhaps the incident really was a one-off, and the fault had been fixed. I held a few more up, and my heart almost skipped a beat when I found one with a solid shadow. No outline of paperclips - This envelope had a letter.

I carefully opened it up, and read.

> Dear valued customer,
> 
> We would like to formally apologize for the incident that occurred recently. We understand that the events were likely traumatic, and whilst we may never make it right, we'd like to offer you a one-time compensation.
> 
> Attached to this letter, using one of our sturdy, high-end paperclips, we have written a cheque for £2,000. We hope we can continue our partnership professionally.
> 
> We understand that you may want to cancel your lifetime supply of paperclips.
> 
> Unfortunately, we must decline this request.
> 
> We hope you understand,

No. I did not understand. Do you? Do you understand what the *fuck* they're talking about?

I contacted the police to update them, letting them know that I had received this message. They sent somebody to collect it.

The following day, assuming all was well, I picked up the daily delivery from the floor. Before I had a chance to check it, there was a knock at the door - I folded the envelope and put it in my back pocket. I opened the door, and was surprised to see a man in a suit looking very concerned.

He wasted no time in getting to the point.

"Hello, we're relocating you. Pack your things, and tell nobody. We have a temporary hotel booked for you."

My lack of response showed that I had many questions.

"Look - It's just precautionary. We can't find any evidence of Clipogenics ever existing, and..."

"...and what?"

"...and the finger matched the D.N.A of a recent assumed suicide. It's now assumed to be murder."

I had a feeling there was more. Unfortunately, his next sentence confirmed that.

"The person in question was found to have also won the competition."

I did not need telling twice - I got my essentials packed, and was at the hotel in less than 90 minutes. It was only in the next town over, which I found odd, yet comforted that I was still so close to home.

After the man left and I was left with my own thoughts, I was surprised at how quiet my head was. I was just...content. I wasn't happy or sad or scared, I was just existing. Perhaps I was still in shock. It took about an hour before I remembered the envelope in my back pocket. I held it up to the light, and knew from the resulting darkness that this contained another letter.

I hesitantly opened it, peeking inside to check for hidden surprises.

Upon taking it out, I thought it to be a blank piece of paper - It seemed entirely empty. Until I unfolded it, to reveal the few words printed upon this letter.

> Dear valued customer,
> 
> Suicides don't lose fingers,
> 
> The police do not wear suits.

The world spun. The world crumbled. The world felt like it no longer existed.

Then all at once, reality came back to me, as I felt a rush of anxiety-driven energy. I paced back and forth in the limited space I had, weighing up my options and trying to come up with a plan.

Could I leave? I was probably being watched.

Could I contact the police? I certainly no longer felt comfortable doing so.

Could I talk to my friends or family? The last thing I wanted was to put them in danger.

I knew I had to do one of these 3 options, and opted for the first. It was still bright out - Surely I'd be safe in crowds. So that's exactly what I did. I stuck to busy areas, and travelled across the country, using as many different types of public transportation as I could.

I didn't stop until night fell. I booked a new hotel under a fake name, and paid in cash. I rested surprisingly well that night.

My sleep was interrupted at around 7am to knocking at the door. "No thank you," I sleepily yelled at what I assumed to be room service.

"Something arrived in reception for you - I'll slide it under the door."

A white envelope emerged through the crack under the door.

I wanted to stay away from it, but I knew that being unaware of the contents would scare me more than anything else. Feeling my heart pounding through my chest, I reached for the envelope, noticing a thick object within. Another finger?

No, a letter, this time with a vial of liquid, and two golden paperclips.

I am not letting them control my destiny. I will not sacrifice my life to their company, to become one of their puppets to control.

I know this company has a far greater reach than I first understood, so I might not be able to tell anybody. But I can tell *every*body.

I hope this post reaches their next "big winner" - And I hope they are as strong-willed as I am.
