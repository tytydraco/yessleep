The forest has always scared me. Despite living next to it my entire life, it never grew on me. When my brother dragged me into the woods to play, I always drug my feet. My eyes always played tricks on me, making me see figures peeking out from the trees. I stared at them now with narrowed eyes. In the daylight they looked like trees, nothing malignant about them.

“Mom, Vanessa’s staring out the window again.” My little brother looks at me like I’m crazy. My mother has started to turn a deaf ear to my worries. She tells me a sixteen year old shouldn’t be worrying about things like that. Dad never even pretended to listen. He only rolled his eyes and then checked out of the conversation. Just Vanessa being Vanessa they said. 

Sighing, my mom walked behind me, her disappointed face reflected in the glass. “Vanessa please, can we not today?” I shook my head. The trees stood still staring back at me. Ever since that college kid had killed himself in the woods, I had been on edge. Muttering my mom threw her hands up in the air and walked off. “Just let her do her thing Jason, she’ll get over it.”

“Like with her boyfriend?” he said. I turned then.

“Shut up twerp, wait until some girl stomps all over your heart. Don’t come crying back to me then.” Jason just stuck his tongue and ran. Mom dipped her head around the corner and shot me a glare. “What?” I snap. It comes off a little meaner than it needs to. 

“Watch that tone missy, or I’ll stick you out there myself.” I rolled my eyes. As if she would. I turned back to the window. I felt like I was being watched. Part of me thought I might catch someone or something peeking from around one of the trees.

Dinner is good, but I find myself looking through the window. Dad points at me with his fork, ligotti impaled on the tines. 

“Again?” he asks. I ignore his jab, the feeling of being watched is back. I don’t understand how the others don’t feel it. Maybe I’m just going crazy. Mom nods, as she takes a sip of her ice tea. 

“She’s been looking through it all afternoon.” That was untrue, but I wasn’t going to argue the point. Dad let out as he set down his fork.

“Vanessa honey, this is getting ridiculous don’t you think. What happened with that guy was a once in a lifetime thing.” He taps a hand on the table. The words are on his mouth and I brace myself for them. “I’m gonna need you to stop being so scared of the woods honey. Might be time to check in with Dr.Halloway.” I grit my teeth. Then Jason would open his big fat mouth again, and tell his friend. He would tell his sister. Who would tell her boyfriend and her friends and so on. The telephone cord extending from person to person. I would be a pariah again. My friendships were fragile enough as it was. This would sink them I was sure of it.

“Ok dad.” I say it quietly, staring down at my plate. The feeling doesn’t leave.



It lingers as I wash the dishes. The sun sets and the gloom only deepens, the shadows stretching longer and longer, onto our lawn. Only once I’m locked in my room does the feeling leave. I leave my curtains closed just in case. The knocking jolts me awake. It’s a steady sound. A light thunk, thunk against a window. My eyes slowly look to my window. Whoever it is, isn’t outside my window. Somewhere down the hall, a person mutters. A door creaks open, and heavy footsteps start to pad down the hall. The knocking moves.  

“I’m coming.” my dad mutters. His tone is annoyed. There is another voice. This one is distinctly feminine. What was my mom doing? Taking off my blankets, I march out of my room, despite my brain telling me not to. The cold floor sends a shudder through my body. None of the lights are on in the house. Moonlight gleams in through the windows. Dad is walking into the living room towards a glass screen door that hasn’t been opened since the snow fell. “Just wait a moment.” he mumbles under his breath. I flick on a light before he grabs the handle. He freezes and his head snaps up. “What the hell?” He looks at me with sleepy eyes. 

“Gerald, what are you doing?” My mom stands in her house robe, black hair a frizzy [mess.Dad](http://mess.Dad) looks back at the door confused. 

“Don’t know, just had a weird dream.” My dad has never slept walk in his life. The base of my neck prickles, and I look out the kitchen window. There’s something behind one of the trees. I blink and it's gone. Only the vague impression of some figure is left in my mind. The feeling of being watched disappears with it as Mom leads my Dad back to bed.



The next day I stand in the backyard. My fingers are still cold in my gloves. The pom-pom on my toque rustles in the wind, not helping with the seriousness of what I’m about to do. The snow lays still on the lawn undisturbed. The crunching makes my teeth hurt as I slowly walk across it, up to the trees that border our lawn. Dad never bothered building a fence, wandering animals didn’t bug him apparently. The thought of some intruder striding out of the trees and into the house was also apparently too ridiculous for him to consider.

The trees look less menacing in the day light. White poplars with black spots covering them like a dalmatian. Snow and ice clings to their branches. Sunlight shines down between them, revealing nothing more than deadfall, and more trees. Feeling slightly more emboldened I step past a tree, scanning the trees for any sign of movement. I’m not sure what I’m expecting to find, but I feel a little more at ease. My parents were right, I was just seeing things. Dad sleepwalking was just an odd coincidence. It’s as I turn back that I see it. Right behind one of the trees, are two footprints. 

They aren’t contained to a pair of boots. I can see the toe imprints. Sprinting out of the trees, I ran back into the house locking the door behind me. My parents glance at me as I barge in, breathing heavily. I can’t even form words, as my mom rushes to my side.

“What’s the matter honey, breathe in, just like we practiced, come on.” the old habit kicks in. Slowly I take some deep breaths, the tightening feeling around my chest dissipates. 

“There was someone in the woods.” I manage. Dad mutters under his breath.

“Jesus Christ not this again.” 

“I’m not lying!” I scream. “There was someone there I saw the footprints, they didn’t have shoes!” My body trembles, as I plead with my father. “Just go and look please.” Sighing he gets up from his chair and grumbles over. We walk out to the spot in silence, but I stop short only pointing at the tree. He grumbles and looks behind it.

“Vanessa, this isn’t funny.” he motions me over. I walk forward in a daze. He must have the wrong tree, there was no way to miss them. “There’s nothing here.” he looks at me concerned now. Judging from it I can tell that I’m about to see my therapist very soon. He leads me back gently whispering in my ear. The rest of the day passed in a daze as my mind raced. The image of the footprints burned into my mind. I hadn’t imagined them. Conversation is quiet and awkward. None of my parent’s attempts get me to talk. Whatever is out there is going to get my family, I’m sure of it. Last night I heard my mom’s voice. Does that mean it can mimic to lure them out, or welcome itself in? It wants my family, and I don’t know why.

I lay awake in my bed, the fatigue making my eyes droopy. I can’t afford to fall asleep. I’m convinced whatever is out there is going to lure us one by one out of the house. It’s around midnight when I’m proven right. This time it's both of them. I don't wait this time. Flinging open my door I watch as they march side by side, eyes closed. Running into the kitchen I turn on the lights. This does nothing, they keep moving like nothing happened. 

“Wake up!” I scream. Still nothing. “Wake up you two! Please!” My wild screams do nothing to deter them, as they split from one another, walking around the kitchen table, only to march side by side again as they approach the glass door. “Dad, mom please wake up!” The forest is dark and gloomy, the light beating back the dark. The eyes are the first thing I notice.

The figure is tall, she’s at least seven feet tall. Her hair is snow white, the skin matching. Pale blue veins can be seen under it. She wears a long dark robe, but even from where I stand I can see her feet are bare. A long hand with sharp nails scratches the bark of a tree. The other beckons with a single finger. I scream a loud shrill cry that fills the room. My brother cries in the background, and then hands are grabbing me as the figure slinks into the darkness.

“What’s going on?” my mother looks at me with wild eyes. Dad grabs my little brother from around the shoulders ushering him back down to his room. His glances over his shoulder once, eyes full of concern. “Vanessa what are you doing?” she hisses. I look up at her confused. What is she talking about? She wraps her arms around me. I don’t even know what to say to her. “Monday we’re going to see Dr.Halloway honey. We’ll get this sorted. Can’t have you walking off into the snow.” The statement is insane. She leads me back to my room, and tucks me in like I’m an eight year old. Pulling up the blankets to my chin she curls next to me, and sleep eventually takes me.

As the hours pass by on Sunday, a dread creeps into my body. She’ll be back tonight, and this time my little brother will join my parents. I look at Jason, as he eats a bowl of frosted flakes. He looks down at his bowl stirring the soggy flakes around. I have no idea how to prepare. The tall woman is something beyond this world. The only thing I understand is that she can’t come into the house. All I can do is try to wake them up tonight. There was no way I would be able to sneak out of the house. My parents watch me warily from the livingroom, the tv quieter than it has ever been.

I sat in silence for the entire day, sleeping at certain points. When night fell, I noticed it took my parents longer to fall asleep. When it was eleven they finally shut off the tv before going back to bed. I laid awake in my bed for another excruciating hour. When I could finally hear their breaths I snuck out of my room. Every move I made was slow, and careful. The first thing I did was look at the glass sliding door. My heart leapt into my throat. She was already there. A wide grin split her face, teeth as white as her hair. Slowly she raised her hand and started beckoning. Something deep down told me I didn’t have much time. Yanking open a drawer I grabbed a boxful of tacks. I’d worry about them yelling at me later, all I needed them to do was wake up. Lining them up against the screen door I kept an eye on the woman, determined not to let her unnerve me. 

Grabbing a length of rope I had with me, I tied it to the end of the hallway. The woman stood still only her long finger moved. Beckoning. The windows and doors were next. I tacked the front door and bolted it shut. The house was still silent, whatever spell the woman was working on my family would be in effect soon. Why it didn’t work on me I didn’t know why. I didn't have the time to think about it. I only had a few tacks left, and I tried to divide them in front of my parents and brother’s doors. They all started to shuffle suddenly. Running back to the kitchen I flung all the lights on, and then dug some pots and pans out of the cupboards. It was stupid, something straight out of Home Alone, but I didn’t know what else to do.

I glared out the window at the grinning woman, as the doors to my parents and brother’s room opened at the same time. The first set of tacks did nothing. I immediately started banging the pots and pans together. I screamed and yelled, and they still advanced, eyes closed shut. My dad trips right over the rope, and lands on his nose, a sickening crunch follows it. My mother trips over him, but scrambles back up. Slamming my pots and pans together does nothing. Jason steps over my dad, and turns for the front door. My father slowly rises to his feet and marches towards the glass door. 

I’m stuck between the two groups. I move a foot in the direction of my brother, before my mom pushes right by me. I grab onto her arm trying to drag her down, and I’m thrown to the ground for my efforts. I hear the door unlock, such a soft simple sound. Then it creaks open and I watch my brother disappear around the corner of the house. A horrible laugh comes from the woman. It mocks me as I cling to my mother’s angle shrieking. She steps onto the tacks, and for a brief second she jolts before ripping open the glass door. 

Cold air rushes in, and I lose her just as quickly. Nothing I did even remotely worked. My father shoves by me, I try with all my might to stop him. Swinging my frying pan, I crack it off his skull. It makes a horrible thud, and I can see the blood trickling down his forehead. He stops for a second. Then he rears back his fist.

I never felt the punch, but I do feel the throb in my head as I pick myself off the floor. The sun has risen, and cold air rushes in. I’m numb, shaking and shuddering on the floor. Footprints march across the snow and into the woods. Putting my head in between my legs I weep.
