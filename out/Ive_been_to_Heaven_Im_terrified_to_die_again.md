My life started the day I met Margret and it ended the day I lost her. It was a good life we lived, just the two of us. We didn’t have much, but we didn’t want for much. We had each other and that was enough. I remember I used to tell her that ‘with a Bible in one hand and yours in the other, I could get us through anything’. But I can’t hold her hand anymore.

I’ve lost before. I’ve lost friends, aunts, uncles, coworkers, siblings. And before any of that, I lost my parents. Throughout my life, I thought I knew loss. I didn’t really.

I had never lost alone.

I turned to God more than ever after she passed. I offered up my pain and suffering to the Lord. I asked for guidance. I asked for comfort. I asked for relief. I asked to see Margret again. I sobbed out desperate prayers, but God did not answer.

For two more hollow years I carried on. I lived my life the way I always had. I worked. I came home. I ate. I slept. But I did it alone.

Now I know loss.

It eats at you, desperate to fill the absence of what was. It cries out for what it cannot have. Loss is desperation. It’s all encompassing. It’s helplessness. It’s exhausting. And I had had enough.

One night, I decided to cook up Margret’s favorite Chicken Parmesan, just the way she liked it. I set the table for two and sat down, dressed in my Sunday best. A picture of her sat across from me.

She was beautiful.

I felt at peace. Seeing her reminded me of what I used to have. It reminded me of what I could have again. I ate a few bites of chicken, took several bottles of pills, and washed it all down with a tall glass of Merlot. Before long, I was gone.

 



I thought I knew what to expect from Heaven. I expected to see golden roads and a city of mansions. I expected God’s majesty floating in a sea of clouds. I expected a gate tended by Saints and a great river flowing through the city of Heaven. I expected gemstones that I’d never seen and a great tree and the book of life. I expected to see angels and humans alike, worshiping at the throne of the Living God.

I expected to see her again.

Instead, I found myself in a formless room of light that went on farther than my heavenly eyes could see. It expanded into eternity. It was without beginning or end. It simply was.

As I looked around, I saw a darkness cut through the light. In the near distance a Throne sat in the infinite solitude. It knew my name. It called to me and before I could think to answer, I was there, at the foot of the Throne. My face was pressed hard against the sticky black floor in reverence. My voice sang scripture that I did not remember. My heart only felt love for the Father. My mind spilled with adoration for Him. I wasn’t ‘me’ anymore. I was an unworthy worshiper of the one true God. Compulsion drove me to worship harder. I was collapsed at the foot of the throne praising the Living God and it was perfect. That elation could have lasted forever, if I never looked up.

Between breaths, I heard a woman’s voice worshipping beside me.

I glanced at her.

She wore a simple white tunic that glowed with heavenly light. Her hair was hidden under a simple fabric cover. She would have been beautiful, but her mouth was caked in a thick black substance that heavily stained everything it touched. It ran down her chin and onto her tunic. I felt great unease as I noticed that we were surrounded by the black stain, but she was unbothered. She was too enamored to care. Her left hand was stiff and rigid, and in it she held a Bible. Its pages were long decayed and hopelessly discolored. And yet, she still recited the scriptures in a hushed whisper, emphatic and paranoid. Her right hand was a mangled mess of twisted fingers, broken from endlessly turning those ruined pages. Her first finger was reduced to a bony nub that she dragged along the page as she read. Her reading never slowed. Her worship never ceased. Her voice was ever-present and persistent, like a soft rainfall. Occasionally she cried out thunderously; Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna to the highest!

Seeing her made me cease my worship, and for the first time, I began to realize what sat in front of me.

A snake was coiled around the foot of His Throne. The serpent’s head was crushed under a necrotic heel that oozed with infection and decay. Poison like oil traced His veins, going up His leg. Without thinking, my head unbowed, raising, and I dared to look at the Father.

I fell back.

The Corpse of God stared down at me.

His kind eyes were dim.

He died with a proud smile on His face. 

“Oh my God.”

Silence fell over us. The whispering rain had stopped. The woman bore into me with hateful eyes.

“Thou shalt not take the Lord’s name in vain”, she said in a low growling whisper.

“He’s dead.” was all I could stammer out.

“Blasphemer!” She roared.

Her righteous indignation echoed past me and continued into eternity. Her eyes never left mine as her broken hand turned those ruined pages. She stopped deliberately at an illegible page, and the bony nub traced scripture that was not there.

“The LORD is the True God; he is the Living God, the Eternal King.”

“He’s dead!”

“He *IS* the Living God!”

“Open your eyes!” I screamed, unable to process the truth of my own words. “He’s gone! There’s nothing for us here! We shouldn’t be here!”

Something changed in her eyes. In a moment of doubt, she looked at the face of God that smiled down on her with lifeless eyes. She seemed to think for a moment. Everything was still. I waited. She began to turn the pages slowly, as if she was reading. She dragged her bone across another page. Her expression softened. Her blackened tongue spoke,

“My soul thirsts for God, for the Living God.”, she pleaded, “When shall I come and appear before God?”

“You can’t. He’s not the Living God anymore. Do you get that?”

Even as I said it, I felt the Throne pull at me. The mere presence of what used to be God compelled me to collapse in worship, but I fought the urge. There was a sadness in her as she flipped through more pages. In a choked whisper she read,

“Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.”

She lost that look in her eyes. She had made her choice.

She turned away from me, and faced the dead Living God. She began to weep with a profound mourning, deep and sorrowful. She knelt and let her tears fall on His necrotic foot. She began to wash His feet, rubbing her tears into the wound. Impossibly, the Corpse of God still bled, and the black blood flowed from his wound and pooled around us. She removed her head covering to reveal that her hair was a matted mess of gore, and she dried His feet with it. She reached down and pooled a handful of blood into her rigid left hand. Then she reached out, just above His heel and somehow, she ripped a small strip of God’s flesh with her mangled right hand. She walked to me and spoke,

“Take, eat; this is my body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of me.”

She tore with her teeth at the strip of flesh and ate it in a single gulp.

“This cup is the new covenant in my blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”

She lifted her other hand and drank the blood, careful to leave enough for me.

Then she stood there, in front of me, waiting for me to take communion with her.

I looked into Margret’s eyes. She looked into mine.

I did it.

I ate His flesh and drank His blood.

Regret slithered down my throat and landed in my stomach like a rock.

I cried out to God,

“Father! Lord! Please! Save me!”

I looked up.

The corpse looked down.

I collapsed at the foot of the Throne, and could do nothing but listen to her as I fought back my nausea.

She held my hand, like she had for decades before. I was surprised to feel such a delicate touch. Her thumb glided back and forth against my hand, comforting me in the way only she knew how.

The rain whispered scripture,

“My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you. I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes.”.

 



I woke up at my dining room table in a pool of vomit. On my plate were half digested pills, chicken, and something deeply black.

I don’t know how to live. I’m terrified to die. I struggle to know what I saw. My mind, my faith, can’t bear the thought that what I saw was truly heaven. Yet, I know that I saw the face of God. Sometimes, I can even find comfort in His proud smile.

When I go back, I’m sure I’ll run away into eternity forever. Away from the Throne and the Corpse and the woman who recites scriptures. But a small part of me whispers that I could have what I always wanted. When I die, I could go worship God forever, with that ruined Bible in one hand and my wife’s hand in the other[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisEtherWrites/comments/1i8xuj9/thank_you_for_reading/)
