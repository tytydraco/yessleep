“Wait up” I said. Taking a hold of Mark's arm. He turned towards me. “You still up for the movie tonight?”
“Sorry something has come up” Mark said, fiddling with his shirt.
“I can come with you.”
“No, no, it’s too early.” He avoided my gaze. “It’s a family emergency.” He kissed me on the cheek, before running to his friends.


Mark and his friends had been acting weird for the last couple of weeks. It had started with them going quiet whenever I came around and now they avoided me like the plague. I had decided if he stood me up today too, I wouldn’t let it slip.


That evening I went out in my car, when I got close to his house, I stopped and turned off the light. I sat there for about 45 minutes before I saw someone leave the house, it was Mark’s dad. He walked to their car and looked around, he then waved for the rest of the family to follow.


I followed their car with my lights still off. We drove for about two hours before they turned into a small road in the woods and drove for another half hour. They stopped in front of an old barn, with another eight cars. I stayed on the road while they walked inside. I jumped at the sound of a car horn. I had no choice but to drive forward and park. The dad from the car behind me, came up and knocked on my window. I rolled it down and looked at him.
“It starts soon,” he said, looking around my car. “I see you came alone. You can sit with me and my family.” I nodded and we all walked in together.


The barn was filled with long benches, making ten rows. We sat down in the third one. I could see Mark, his three friends and their families, but they didn’t seem to have noticed me.
A man walked in from one of the doors at the front.


“Welcome my fellow travellers. Today is a special day for our youngsters. The day to be reborn.” Everyone cheered.”Please come up and stand before me.” 
Mark and six other people walked up and kneeled in front of the man, they all seemed to be around the age of eighteen to twenty one.
“Today ends the days of sins and starts the journey to paradise. The blood of the sinners will cleanse you and make you born again.”
“Born again!” Everyone repeated.


The door at the front opened once more and three men walked in holding a woman between them. Her hands and feet were strapped together and her mouth was covered. I let out a gasp. The woman sitting next to me took my hand, with the biggest smile on her face.

The woman was placed on the floor facing us. Her eyes searched the crowd.
“I’m sure you all recognize this woman. Just a week ago she sat where all of you are sitting now,” the leader said. “A few days ago her husband Carl,” a man stood up with a proud smirk on his face and bowed to everyone before sitting back down. “Brought me some horrifying news. When this woman was in her late teenage years, she had an abortion.” The whole barn gasped. “She took away the chance for this child to blossom. But today she has a chance to be cleansed.” He took out a dagger from his robe. He removed the fabric from her mouth.

“Please help me! Somebody help me! You all know me. You all know…” The woman pleaded. The leader slapped her across the face.
“Quiet! You have broken our way. But you have a chance to be reborn in these people,” He gestured at the seven people kneeling.
“I’m sorry,” she whispered. The leader lifted her arm and cut through.

“No!” I screamed standing up. Everyone’s eyes turned to me. Mark made eye contact with me, he looked heartbroken.
“Shut her up!” Someone yelled. The people beside me took a hold of me and forced me back down on the bench and put a scarf in my mouth.

One of the people who had carried the woman in, held a goblet under her arm. Silent tears covered her face.
“The blood of the sinner will give you life,” the leader said. Raising the goblet. He let each of the youngsters take a sip. I felt vomit forming in my throat. The leader then put the goblet away.

“Now the first step of your journey can start.” He gave each of them a knife and let them on the woman. She didn’t make a sound as they cut through her. Everyone was standing, cheering. I tried to get away but was held tight by their arms. The youngsters sat back down covered in blood and her limp body was just laying there.

“Now that we are done with the rebirth, there is another matter we need to attend to,” the leader said. He looked at me. “We have an unannounced guest with us tonight. Please bring the girl up to me.” The two people walked me up to him. He stepped forward and put something in my neck. 


I woke up in a cold dark room. A small light shined through the hatch door. I screamed and tried to break the hatch open, but no one came to my aid. Someone came to me each day and fed me. Mark came a few times, he tried to make me understand and told me that he was planning on inviting me in once he had been reborn. I turn my back to him each time.


One night they threw another person down there with me. It took a few hours before he awoke.
“Hi,” he said. I recognised him from the barn. He was one of the people from the car behind me.
“Hi,” I said.
“I’m Gary. You’re Alyson right?” I nodded. “Mark has told us about you.”
“Why are you here?” I spat. He sighed.
“I have been going to the barn since I was five. You think I should be used to this by now, but it never stopped disturbing me. I could not leave, I have tried a few times over the years but someone from the group always found me. The police thought I was crazy.” Gary laughed. “They sent me to the psych ward. Where my family later collected me. But I guess you meant why I’m here with you in the cellar.”
“Yes.” I said.
“I was supposed to be reborn yesterday but I slapped the goblet out of the leaders hand.”


We spent a lot of time in the cellar together. The people who came with our food tried to convince us each time to understand and join them. Gary told me about his upbringing and all the sacrifices they had made in the barn. Eventually I opened up about my life too.


On Mark's twenty-fifth birthday two men came and collected me. Both Gary and I tried to stop them but it was no use. They injected me with something and when I woke up I was in the barn. I was wearing a white wedding dress and Mark was standing in front of me. The two men were making sure I couldn’t move.

“We have gathered here today to celebrate Mark's twenty-fifth birthday and send him on the next part of his journey. This will be his life partner,” the leader said, gesturing at me. “As she hasn't been reborn yet, we must start with the blood of the sinner.”
Through the door walked three people holding Gary, he was fighting each step.

“Gary has been with us for many years. He knows the truth but does still choose not to pay for his sins,” the leader sighed. “So we have to do it for him. As is customary the man will take the blood of the sinner.” He gave his dagger to Mark. Gary and I locked eyes. It had been such a long time with him being my only company, and now it seemed like I would be stuck with these people forever and I wouldn’t even have Gary to make it easier. I tried to scream when Mark cut through Gary’s skin, but only a whimper came out. Mark walked up to me with the goblet, I didn’t know what else to do but drink. I could barely keep the thick salty liquid down. Mark drank too.

“As the sins blood cleanses, Alyson and Mark can now become one,” the leader said. Mark kissed me and the barn erupted with cheers. “Settle down everyone, Mark will now finish the ceremony.” I took a deep breath.
“Wait,” I said. “I understand now. As Gary's blood went through me, it set me free. So let me finish it so I can start my journey.” The leader nodded at Mark who turned to me with the dagger.

“My love,” Mark said as I took the dagger. We looked at each other with big grins on our faces. I walked over to Gary, he looked at me with disgust.
“Get ready to run,” I whispered in his ear. I cut through the rope that held his feet together. He let out a scream of pain. The people cheered me on but I took a step back in fear.
“Keep going,” Gary mouthed. I cut through the rope around his hands and then turned around. Mark walked towards me with open arms. I pierced the knife through his shoulder blades. A gasp went through the church and Mark fell to his knees. I took hold of Gary's arm.

“We have to go.” I said. Gary got on his feet and we ran out the door.
I broke the window to my car and got into the driverseat. Gary was still standing outside.
“What are you doing?” I said.
“I can’t leave, not yet,” Gary said.
“But if we don’t hurry they will catch us.” Gary turned around and ran behind the barn, I ran after him. He stopped at a shed. Inside there were bottles of lighter fluid.

“They use it to get rid of the bodies,” Gary said. He gave me two bottles. “But first we have to cover the doors.” We took some wooden planks and placed them against the door. Luckily the people inside hadn’t started coming out. We ran around the house pouring lighter fluid on the barn.
“Fuck,” Gary said. “We have nothing to light it with.”

“I think I have a lighter in my car.” I said. I went to my car and got it. “Here.” I give Gary the lighter. He went up to the barn and lit it up. We stood there looking as the flames becoming bigger. Soon the sound of the people inside trying to break down the door could be heard. I took Gary’s hand when I saw tears start to fall down his face.
“It’s over, it’s really over this time. I’m finally free,” Gary said between laughs. The screams started to become deafening.

“We should leave,” I said. Gary nodded. As we got into the car a few burning people could be seen running out of the barn. I backed out and drove off. We drove in silence but once we got back to civilization Gary asked.
“Where are we going?”
“I don’t  know,” I said. “I just know I want to be as far away from that place as possible.”
