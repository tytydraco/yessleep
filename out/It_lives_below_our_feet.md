My wife whispered that in her sleep.

The phrase won’t mean anything to you, but those are the *exact* words my dementia-riddled grandfather used to utter. A man Tess never met. All day, I’ve been ruminating about the horrifying, long-repressed events of my childhood. Unspeakable things that I thought I’d left in the past. Given Tess’ sleep-mumbling, I’m no longer sure about that.

“It lives below our feet,” Grandpa said. “Don’t look at its eyes. It’ll come for you.”

“Yes, Dad,” My mum sighed. “Eat your breakfast.”

Grandpa Tom had dementia, so we were no strangers to the bizarre quotes that would flood out of his quivering lips. Ever-quivering. And on reflection, I know that Grandpa had every right to be scared. He wasn’t as unwell as we all thought.

Dementia is a merciless cancer. It strips a person of their very essence. I remember Grandpa Tom being a vibrant and intelligent man when I was very young. But in that final year of his life, when I was fifteen, the man I knew was already dead. I know that’s an awful thing to say, but I think anybody who’s seen their loved one endure that direful disease knows exactly what I mean.

And it was made all-the-more harrowing by his incessant repetition of that phrase. Below our feet.

“What’s wrong, Grandpa?” I asked.

He averted his glazed-over gaze from the meadow, and he looked at me. I was briefly overjoyed to see a glimmer of humanity in his eyes. It was one of those rare, beautiful moments. Grandpa *recognised* me.

“Oh, Henry,” He said. “Shouldn’t you be in bed?”

“It’s only six in the evening,” I said, smiling. “We’ve not even had dinner yet.”

Grandpa nodded, grunting. “Unseasonably cold tonight, isn’t it?”

“It’s October,” I said. “Not too bad for this time of year.”

“Oh…” Grandpa replied, and his eyes were hollow again. “I thought it was July. I thought I was… somewhere else.”

I nodded, looking at the meadow. The day’s dwindling light illuminated the thick, overgrown strands of grass in the unused plot of farmland. Mum wanted to put it to use, but Grandpa always forbade that.

“There’s plenty of room for crops around the back of the property,” He’d huff. “Two-hundred-and-fifty acres of land. You’ve inherited more than enough space. All I ask is that you leave the meadow *alone*.”

That was his insistence during his more lucid days. During his final year of life, he rarely displayed even the slimmest sliver of his personality. Rarely said anything other than...

“Below our feet. It lives... below our feet.”

“Grandpa,” I started in a measured way. “Why do you keep saying that?”

He sighed. “There’s a place in the meadow… Don’t go there, Henry.”

“I know,” I said. “You’ve always made that clear.”

The next day, I confronted my mum about Grandpa’s behaviour. She bit her lip, stifling her desire to sob. Mum cried a lot back in those days. It must’ve been so painful for her to come to terms with what was happening to her father. I think she mourned him before he had even passed away.

She nodded. “It’s hard, isn’t it, Henry? Grandpa’s hurting. We’re all hurting.”

“But don’t you think there might be a reason that he’s so fearful of the meadow, Mum?” I asked. “Even before his deterioration, he always used to warn us about it.”

Mum strolled over to me and embraced me tightly. “I *wish* there were a reason for what has happened to him, Henry. But life is cruel. I just pray you never have to see your father or me that way.”

Dad spent most of his free time searching for care homes, but there was always something wrong with each of them in Mum’s eyes. Of course, we all knew that nowhere would ever be good enough. My dad just did his best to make her happy during Grandpa’s final months of life.

It was what happened on the day of his death that scarred all of us, however.

“Grandpa?” I called into the darkness.

Everybody had gone to bed, but I’d been sitting with Grandpa on the porch again. I think he always felt safer when he had his eyes on the meadow. He never liked being indoors. Unfortunately, I’d made the foolish error of nipping inside to grab a snack, and when I returned to the porch, Grandpa was gone. Panicking, I rushed indoors to grab a flash-light.

“What are you doing?” Cynthia asked.

My nine-year-old sister stood in the doorway, rubbing her sleepy eyes and cupping a glass of water in her hands.

“Go back to bed,” I instructed.

“Is Grandpa out there?” She asked.

“Yes,” I lied.

“I’ll say good night to him,” She said, skipping past me.

She was too nimble, and I couldn’t stop her. I scrambled after her, but she was already on the porch with a perplexed look on her face.

“On the porch?” She asked.

“Go to bed, Cynthia,” I replied.

Her eyes widened. “Henry… Where’s Grandpa?”

“Go to bed,” I said. “This isn’t a big deal.”

“Oh no…” She said, lip quivering. “We have to tell Mum and Dad.”

“No, we don’t,” I said. “Look, just… Let’s calm down, okay? I’ll go and find Grandpa.”

“But…” My sister protested.

“Come with me and hold the torch,” I said.

Cynthia’s little eyes brightened, and she smiled at me. Emotional trickery. The best way to win her over was to make her feel like a grown-up, I often found. And it worked. She nodded her head enthusiastically, and I handed the torch over to her.

“But we’ve got to be *super* quiet, okay?” I said. “Mum would be upset if she were to find out.”

Cynthia nodded, and I held her hand as she lit the way with the torch. I used my spare hand to brush the large strands of grass out of the way. It had been a couple of years since Dad had properly cut it because he was so tired of enduring Grandpa’s lectures about the dangers of entering the meadow. Some of the strands were nearly as tall as my little sister.

“Lift the torch a little higher, Cynthia,” I said.

“It’s hurting my arm,” She replied.

“Want me to take over?” I offered.

“No,” She said in a determined voice. “I… I can do it.”

“Okay, well… Shit,” I gasped.

“Henry!” Cynthia whispered. “You’re not supposed to say that!”

I placed a finger to my lips and shook my head at my little sister. She immediately understood not to say another word. What I’d seen was the silhouette of a man a few yards in front of us. It had to be Grandpa. But the reason I shushed my sister and clenched my entire body in fear was that I’d spotted something else.

Blood.

Specks of red were coating the strands of grass leading to our grandfather. I seized the torch from Cynthia.

“Grandpa?” I quietly muttered.

He twisted his head ever-so-slightly, but stopped before allowing himself to look at us. And then he uttered the most awful noise. A groan that indicated a weak, muted brand of pain. A pain that humans are unable to put into words, especially those as mentally fragile as my grandpa.

“Below our...” He began.

And then he sank from sight. There was the sound of grass and dirt breaking away beneath him. Cynthia gripped my hand so tightly that her nails forged small indents in my skin. I still feel it sometimes. The way she grabbed me. I could feel her fear.

“Henry…” Cynthia whimpered. “Where did Grandpa go?”

Before I could answer, my little sister’s body fell to the ground, and she screamed in terror. I cast the light onto her, but I couldn’t see what had happened. Something was rustling in the grass, and it was starting to drag her away from me. Without a moment’s thought, I lunged forwards, grabbing onto my sister.

“Henry!” She screamed.

And then I felt something. A branch clinging to my sister’s legs. At least, it *felt* like a branch. But as I tried to wrench it free from my sister’s limbs, its texture made me shiver. It was almost fleshy. Not human, but certainly not belonging to a tree. Not a branch at all. It was alive. And it was disappearing into a hollow. A blackened void that was dragging Cynthia towards it. The hole that had taken our grandpa. I wasn’t going to let it take my sister too.

I whacked the living limb with the butt-end of my torch, and a terrible wailing sound was unleashed from the pit of the hollow before us. But it worked. The thing released my sister, and I pulled her to her feet.

“Run back to the house!” I shouted. “Tell Mum and Dad to…”

I trailed off, feeling something chilly and vine-like wrapping around my ankle. I remained calm for Cynthia’s sake, not alluding to what I’d felt. I looked into her frightened, tearful eyes.

“Run,” I repeated.

As my little sister ran towards the house, screeching for our parents, the limb pulled me into the hollow. Horrified, I tumbled into the chasm, quickly thudding against the dirt below. It must have been a ditch that ran about ten feet deep into the earth. The fall broke one of my ribs, but I wouldn’t realise that until the adrenaline had finally worn off.

“Grandpa?” I whispered into the darkness.

My torch was rolling around on the floor of the hollow, illuminating a tunnel that disappeared beneath the meadow. I realised I’d found myself in a labyrinth. *Below our feet*. I picked up the flash-light, and I was terrified to find that I was utterly alone. Surrounded by tunnels shooting off into every direction. As I was wondering how I would ever find my grandfather down there, he gave himself away with that same awful groan.

“Its eyes,” He whispered.

It was the loudest whisper I’ve ever heard. It carried down one of the long tunnels behind me, and I slowly turned to face the most terrifying thing of my life. Grandpa was lying in the tunnel, reaching a bloody hand towards me, and his eyes were the most lucid they’d been in years. He truly saw me in that moment. I wish he hadn’t. I wish dementia had taken. I wish he’d been vacant and confused during his final moments of life. Perhaps it wouldn’t have been as horrible for him.

Looming over him was the monstrosity that had pulled us down there. Its dozen or so branch-like limbs were connected to a black, insect-like body. And atop that ghoulish torso, a haunting face locked onto me. It had countless eyes, like that of a fly, but more human. Each ginormous eye sported a visible iris and pupil. And that made it somehow *farther* from being human.

The thing opened a large mouth filled with numerous rows of teeth. I could only watch in frozen horror as the abomination plunged its frightful fangs into my Grandpa. He screamed, blood spilling out of his convulsing mouth, as he spent his dying moments being eaten alive.

Leaving the torch on the ground to free both hands, I feverishly started to scramble up the slightly-sloped, dirt covered walls of the main entry point to the hollow. But the creature was too fast. I screamed as I felt limbs clawing at me, wrapping around my neck. It felt as if every time I climbed a foot higher, I was pulled two feet lower. And my Grandpa had fallen silent. The squelching noises from the tunnel indicated that the insect monstrosity was tucking into his lifeless corpse.

But I could hear the voices of my parents in the distance.

“Mum!” I screamed. “Dad! I’m down here!”

The squelching stopped. I scooped up the torch from the ground and cast the light down the tunnel. My Grandpa’s hollowed-out corpse was lying motionless in the mud, but the branch-like monster had fled. And as strange skittering sounds surrounded me, I looked up to witness the horror of what it had in store for me. Its abominable limbs were spreading like a spider-web across the opening to the hollow, sealing me off from the world. My parents would never find me.

Propelled by fear and a longing to see my family again, I hauled myself up the slowly-darkening hollow one final time. I could feel limbs enveloping me, but I fought more valiantly than ever. And when I reached the top of the hole, I did something in the name of survival that still haunts me to this day.

I plunged my teeth into one of the creature’s limbs.

The wail it unleashed was twice as loud as its first. But it retreated for a brief second, allowing me to squeeze through the narrow opening and clutch onto a clump of grass. Breathing erratically, I hauled myself up to the meadow and rose to my feet.

“Over here!” I screamed at my parents.

They were only thirty or so yards away from me, and they quickly rushed towards me. I was so lost in that initial emotional embrace, I almost forgot about the terror behind me. But that was the most unsettling part of the entire ordeal. When I turned around, the hollow had vanished. And so had any sign of my grandfather.

Obviously, I know what happened, but how can I ever tell them? They wouldn’t believe me. Grandpa would be long gone by now anyway. This happened fifteen years ago, after all. The lack of closure still torments my mum, but it’s better than knowing what happened to him.

Anyway, I can’t stop thinking about what he said.

*Don’t look at its eyes. It’ll come for you.*

Why did my wife utter my grandfather’s phrase last night? That thing beneath the earth eventually came back for him, and I fear that it’s coming back for me. I haven’t visited the farm for years, so I thought I’d be safe, but perhaps Grandpa didn’t realise the true weight of his words. Maybe it doesn’t really live in the meadow. After all, I keep hearing sounds from the garden.

Maybe it always lives below our feet.
