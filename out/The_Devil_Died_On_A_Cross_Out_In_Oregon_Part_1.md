When I caught myself thinking clearly again it was under that tall black cross swaying with the pines. As the wind blew, the leaves softly cheered with the dancing of her long black hair.

We’d put her in a white gown to match her skin, and put flowers with the thorns in her crown. Blood ran from the crown and into her eyes, eyes blue like the sky. Red ran from the sky to her dress, but she didn’t mind. She was drunk with wine and with God when we drove nails through wrist and through feet. She hung from that cross like the branches on the pines.

As I looked up, those bloody tears fell to my eyes too like rain from Heaven, or rather Hell.

I remembered what my pastor back home had told me about the cross. God, tortured as a man less than men. Purity punished and purged as unclean. A lion of infinite power, slain as a lamb, hung willingly so that man could be unclean, made pure; dead, made alive. He said because the cross was the ultimate humiliation, it was God’s ultimate love. By clothing himself in the wretched flesh of a beaten man, he clothed himself in ultimate glory. The cross was a divine irony.

As she wept and wailed from up there, I didn’t think she looked much like God.

The night before, they’d taken us on boats out onto that lake. They’d built a dock out there, and upon the dock they’d set a feast. Imagine our joy when we saw it.

I don’t know if it was part of the strategy or if the money couldn’t stretch but they’d given us half rations for the days leading up. But on that table lit by candlelight sat pizza, bread, wine, french fries, beer, and whatever other fast food chain had a store nearby. I think I’d only eaten beans, rice and butter for the months before. 

We took our places, smiling and laughing in joyful expectation. They forgoed the usual lengthy prayer, worship, and preaching that had become customary before every meal and let us dig right in. To be honest, the food was cold, but to us it was perfect. 

Some of us fell asleep out there, rocked to sleep by the sway of the water. It was the first moment of peace in a long time. 

At that point the program director stood up, and began to tell us about the last supper. What a wonderful object lesson, I thought. He told us that before Christ’s death, through the consumption of God’s flesh and blood, God fully dwelt within Jesus to prepare for the glory of the crucifixion.

This was of course not accurate. But, they had made our minds numb with sleeplessness and kindness. Everything he said was truth.

He challenged us, asking who among us had faith enough to allow God to fully dwell in our hearts. Any one of us would have offered ourselves to make him happy, but a young dark haired girl beat us to it.

The feast became a party. They gave her so much wine. We sang songs, and we danced out on that dock. When every star had come out to watch they led her to the edge, to a chain hanging in the water. They told her to pull it up, and she did.

“What’s down there?” we asked him as she worked.

“A dove sent from God,” he replied. We thought he was joking, but he continued. “God sent us an angel.”

When she had run out all the slack on the chain we all pulled with her, hauling to the surface all our intrigue. The water churned and bubbled until it gave way to a mass of writhing black worms, each like a man's arm. He dipped a cup into the mass and lifted from it black ichor. He took a knife and cut a piece from its flesh, placing it on a plate. He made her eat from the plate and drink from the cup, and as the angel writhed we danced again.

I was so far gone I almost believed what we had done was holy. I almost thought that mass of seething void was an angel. What convinced me otherwise was her. As she danced she bit and spit and whispered insults from between her teeth. She danced like a drunk, or like a formless thing. I was afraid of her, and it gave her glee.

When we reached the shore again the program director asked me to walk along the edge alone with him, and of course I did. He put his arm around my shoulder and asked me how I was. My fight or flight had long been confused and exhausted but I still knew to lie to the director. I told him I was well. I was happy to be there. He asked me if I was missing home, I told him I was. I asked him where home was for him. He told me out here.

His sincerity had almost eroded my defenses until he asked me again if I valued the truth, the same way he did on van ride there. I told him I did. 

He again asked, “Even if it’s scary?” to which I again nodded. He continued, “What if I told you that the true God wasn’t the one in the Bible, and all these miracles have been proof. What would you say to that?”

I said, “I guess I’d worship whatever has the power to do miracles.”

He smiled. “That’s what makes a true believer different. So many people get bogged down in the Bible. What we’re experiencing out here, that’s the true God. It trumps all that.”

“Of course. That makes sense,” I replied.

“Even when it’s scary,” he finished.

That night in bed I found my old notebook. They had taken our Bibles, but in that notebook were all kinds of notes I’d taken from study. I hoped finding some nugget of the Bible, of when God was simple, would help me calm down. The last part of the Bible I had studied was Luke. I had just finished studying the last supper, and had moved onto the crucifixion. I had jotted down the verse. “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”

I guess it was another little miracle; a synchronicity. God whispering to me his will. I realized then what we were going to do to that poor girl.

She hung there with the Devil long after natural death.
