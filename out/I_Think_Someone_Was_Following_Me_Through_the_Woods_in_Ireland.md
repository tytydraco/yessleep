Back when I was 14 years old, my family had moved from our home in England to the Republic of Ireland, where we lived for a further six years. We had first moved to the north-west of the country, but after a year of living there, we then relocated to the Irish midlands, as my dad had gotten a new job working in the city.   

My parents had bought a cottage on the outskirts of a very small village, that was a stopping point from one of the larger towns to the next. This village was so small and remote, there was basically nothing to do. But not long after moving here, and taking to exploring the surrounding area with my Border Collie, Maisie, I eventually found a large stretch of bogland containing a man-made forest. Every weekend or half-term away from school, I took to walking this area with my dog, in which I would follow along a railway line used for transporting peat. However, after months of trekking this very same bogland, I eventually stopped going there. I can’t quite recall the reason why, but maybe it was because I always felt as though I was trespassing (which I wasn’t) or because the bogland was so bumpy and uneven, I always came home with horrific blisters.  

Although I stopped going to this bogland to walk my dog, outside one of the nearby towns where I went to school, there was a public forest. Because this forest was a twenty-minute drive away, my dad would take me and Maisie there, drop us off and then pick us up again two or three hours later. What I loved about these woods was that it was always quiet – only with the occasional family, dog-walker or jogger passing us by.  

On one particular evening, I had gone back to these woods with Maisie, where my dad would later pick us up after running some errands. Making our way along the trail, the evening had already started to dimmer. Wanting to make my way back to the car park before it got too dark, I decided to take a short cut through the forest, via one of the many narrow side-trials. Following down one of these side-trials, me and Maisie stumbled upon a small tipi-shaped hut made from logs. Loving a good game of hide and seek, I would sometimes hide inside this tipi when Maisie wasn’t looking, where she would spend the next couple of minutes circling round the hut trying to find me – not realizing she could just go inside.  

Whether I played this game with Maisie that day, I’m not sure – but following down this exact same side-trail, I turn to look behind me. Staring down the entryway, I then see a man walking twenty metres behind, having just taken this side-trail... For some unknown reason, I had a strange instant feeling about this man, even though I had only just noticed him. I can’t remember or even describe the way this man was walking, but the way he did so felt suspicious to me. Listening to my instincts, or perhaps just my paranoia, I quickly latch my lead back onto Maisie and hurriedly make my way down the trail.  

A few minutes later, although I had reached back onto the main trail, the evening had already turned much darker. Again turning to see if the man was behind me, I could still see him around the curve, only ten metres away from me now. I did try to tell myself I was just being paranoid, and this man was most likely not following me - but my gut instinct still told me something was off.  

Thinking ahead, I pull out my phone to call my dad, as to make sure he was already in the car park waiting for me – but there was no answer. Because there was no answer, I just assumed he was probably still driving – and because he was still driving, I just hoped my dad was nearly on his way.  

By the time I make it back to the car park, it was basically pitch black by now, and there was just one single car in the parking area... but it wasn’t my dad’s. Sitting down by a picnic bench to wait for him to come and get us, all I could do was hope he would be coming soon and that this strange man from the woods was not following me after all.  

Only a minute or two later, I could hear the footsteps of this very same man approaching through the darkness. Anxiously anticipating him pass by, I try to distract myself on my phone – or at least make myself seem less approachable. Thankfully enough, the man just walks completely by me. Entering the car park, the man then gets in his vehicle - the only car in the car park... but he doesn’t drive away... He just stays there, sat inside his car with both the engine and headlights turned on...  

Twenty minutes must have gone by, but my dad still wasn’t here – and yet this very same stranger was... Trying to call and text my dad to say I was waiting for him, I was met with no answer. While I continued waiting, I tried to rationalize why this man hadn’t decided to drive off. Whatever reasons I came up with, they were not very convincing for me - and for those whole twenty, or however many more minutes, I sat outside those woods in complete darkness, hearing nothing but the hum of this stranger’s engine among the silent night air. 

What made this situation even more anxiety-inducing, was that my dog Maisie had been endlessly whining by my feet – scraping dirt away beneath the bench to make a surprisingly deep hole. Maisie was in general a very nervous dog and basically whined at everything – but perhaps she too felt as though something about this situation wasn’t right. 

Thankfully, after what felt far longer than twenty-so minutes, the strange man, already with his engine and headlights on, reverses from his parking spot, exits out of the car park and onto the main road – leaving me and Maisie in peace. Although we were now alone, basically stranded outside of a dark forest, I couldn’t help but feel a huge sigh of relief come over me.  

My dad did eventually come and get us – ten minutes after the man had finally decided to drive off... Do you want to know what my dad’s excuse was as to why he was so late?... He forgot he had to pick us up. 

I don’t know if that man really was following me through the forest, and I definitely don’t know why he just sat in his car for twenty minutes... But if I had to learn anything from that experience, it would be the following... One: my dad can sometimes be a careless douche... and Two:  

Never hike through the forest alone, late in the evening.
