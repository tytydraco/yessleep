While life in many places has returned to some sort of norm, I would hesitate to say that the pandemic is over. Three years have come and gone since the Coronavirus pandemic broke out in East Asia. The events of early 2020, just as COVID infiltrated the South Korean population for the first time, feel like just yesterday to me. 

Things first began not too long after the first extensive lockdown was implemented in the rural city of Cheongju where I lived and worked as an English instructor. I was five months into my work contract and in retrospect, not handling my worsened depression well… at all. 

Mental health is a notoriously undertreated issue in South Korea and I had gone off my long-term depression medication prior to my arrival to make sure that I secured my job. At the fresh age of 21 I was sure things would be fine. In addition to being naive, what I didn’t take into account was the social isolation I would regularly experience in life and work due to the language barrier. 

I had been closely following local news as a pastime perhaps only a history and political science major would enjoy, so I was a little prepared for the notion of a lockdown coming to my city. One Friday evening in mid February the announcement I was anticipating finally happened as I was on my dinner break. Cheongju was locking down indefinitely and my principal was sending the staff home with all their work materials in preparation for remote teaching. I was ordered to go home and stay in my apartment unless absolutely necessary. No other instructions were given to me in English but I listened intently as the principal discussed things further in Korean to my only other coworker. Annoyed and unable to translate much, I gave a goodbye salutation and started on my walk home.

Before getting back to my apartment I dashed into the market next door to get a few essentials I was unsure if I could order for delivery, namely: soju and my favorite cheap cheap baiju. 

Not too long after arriving in a foreign country with no local connections, I had taken to getting absolutely blasted and watching movies, dramas, and scrolling on my new obsession Tiktok on the weeknights. After all, I could get dangerously drunk for the equivalent of just four American dollars each night.

Having secured my loot, I made my way back to my apartment for the night - correction - the foreseeable future. Glass bottles clanged against each other as I dug for my key in my oversized puffer coat pockets. It was bitter cold this time of year and my fingers were losing mobility from the frigid evening walk home. Before stepping inside my apartment I gave one last look up and down the hall. Lights were dim in the open air central corridor and no one was in sight, per the usual. My neighbor to the left had yet to return home, apparent by the mass of mail still jammed into their door. 

Once inside I tossed my backpack onto the couch I used as an extra storage surface and began to unpack. I pondered for a moment what I would be eating for dinner since many local food places had closed early. The idea to just make a simple sandwich appealed to me. After all, I just wanted to do something quick so I could plop down and start the k-drama I had been itching to watch finally. I opened the cabinet that always held my bread only to find it empty.

I furrowed my brows. *That loaf was brand new as of two days ago.* Looking again, I even pulled out a stool to look at the higher shelves my 5ft frame could not easily see. No luck. Looking through other cabinets I was at a loss for where an entire fresh loaf of bread could have gone. I doubted that I had drunkenly eaten it and forgotten - completely blacking out was not my usual. 

Exasperated, I threw open the door to my tiny freezer, out of ideas of where to look. If anything, I would just spend a few extra minutes cooking some frozen mandu on the stovetop. Squatting down and looking in the freezer, I was taken aback seeing a rock hard loaf of bread stashed next to my boxes of frozen snacks.

I had *never* stored bread in the freezer. 

“Fucking weird.” I huffed as I grabbed my dumpling dinner and cracked open the first soju of the night.

# Lockdown Day 1

Only slightly hungover, I was startled out of my sleep as a loud voice filled my apartment at 7am. Coming from loudspeakers I had never noticed before located above my couch, a female voice seemed to give announcements to the apartment complex in Korean. Before suddenly stopping, I could understand simple things like “Stay inside” and “Government mask rations”, which were of little comfort and felt more dystopian than educational. 

I groaned and rolled over in bed to grab my phone. Opening the Kakao app, I texted one of my more fluent teacher friends to ask about the supposed mask rations and promptly fell back to sleep.

# Lockdown Day 3

*My neighbor must be using this time to get renovations done.*

That's what I initially thought in my drunken stupor when at 11pm I began to hear what sounded to be hammering coming from next door. Only slightly irked, I popped in my new noise-canceling airpods and continued on with some youtube I was watching. The unholy baiju and coke cocktail I had in hand burned as I continued to take big gulps. After what felt like an eternity of noise, I was in just enough of a silly goofy mood to lean back and loudly smack the wall back. 

*Whack. Whack. Whack.* My right hand stung from the contact and I wasn’t entirely sure if the sound traveled through. Although, the rude hammering on the shared wall suddenly stopped. 

# Lockdown Day 4

I laid in bed, wide eyed, as I stared across the apartment at my front door. Frozen in place, I watched as the motion lights in my entry turned on and off, almost rhythmically. This went on for a while as I watched the empty doorway for any sign of something that might be affecting the lights. The activity had finally stopped for just long enough for me to relax and attempt some sleep when a loud bang came from the wall behind my bed. It was the shared wall. 

The distinct hammering began again with a fury this time. 

*BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG*\- It was never ending. Hitting the wall again, the noise refused to stop this time. Exhausted and still slightly woozy from the previous evening’s bender that ended in typical k-drama fueled sobbing, I put on some pants and the nearest coat. I hesitantly crossed the threshold of my apartment and out into the hallway, still not knowing what had set my lights off. Arm crossed for warmth, I used the other to pound on my neighbor’s door. Some mail fell from it as I did so. 

No reply.

I honestly couldn’t even hear the loud hammering that had sent me outside, once I thought about it. The hallway was eerily silent, the usual sounds of the city barely making themselves audible. I teetered back and forth on my slipper clad feet for a moment before huffing and retreating back to my apartment after one last forceful knock at the door.

No reply. 

# Lockdown Day ???

The days had begun to blend together and my sleep schedule - or lack thereof - was completely trashed. With no work and nowhere to go, my time was filled with drinking, binging movies and dramas, and the periodic facetime from my family. At one point I complained to my sister about a persistent headache and her response was that I should drink more water than alcohol. While I knew she was right, I needed the drinking to put me to sleep now more than ever. 

If I was drunk I could sleep through the banging on my wall at odd hours. If I was drunk I could just pass out and ignore the continual on-and-off game my motion activated lights were playing. If I was drunk I could forget or otherwise not dwell on the increasingly threatening words I was understanding from the near daily loudspeaker announcements.

*Go home. Isolate. Mask. Quarantine. Hospital. Go home. Cough. Emergency mandate. Panic. Isolate. Death. Go home. Go home. Go home.* 

My apartment was feeling less and less like a home, and more and more like a prison. 

# Lockdown Day 9

More stressed than when I entered the meeting, I made my way home from the brief outing I was allowed during the lockdown. The intent was to get the staff from the school together to properly train them on using the Zoom platform for online classes, a new concept for us all. However, after spending thirty minutes listening to a mask-clad man anxiously give instructions entirely in Korean without an interpreter, I knew little more than I had when I walked in. After a chipper, “You understand, right? Your generation is good with technology.” from my principal, I had quickly resigned to googling tutorials in English once I got home. 

I made it home around 5pm, much earlier than usual when working in-person, with some daylight to spare. The hallway was barren as usual, save for the empty stroller by one of the doors and my neighbors growing mail. Letters had begun to fall from the door and pile up on the floor. Even if they were staying elsewhere during the lockdown, what were the sounds I was hearing? Clearly not even service workers had opened the front door to access the apartment. 

I sighed and opened my door.

Oddly, the motion activated light in my entryway didn’t come on as I stepped inside. The apartment was dark. Very dark. I began to do a little jig in order to try to activate it but when that failed, I turned on my phone flashlight to find the main light switches. 

*Click. Click.* I should have been able to turn the lights on and off. Looking over at my stove, I noticed the clock was off as well. The sub-zero temperatures that night demanded that I have access to heat in my apartment. Unsure of what to do, I made my way downstairs to the security guard’s office to sort this out. Perhaps other units had experienced an outage as well. 

After several back and forth exchanges via a translator app, I was finally able to get the clearly annoyed man to come to my apartment to check things out. Flashlight in hand, as soon as he entered my apartment he proceeded to open a door behind a mirror in my entry, revealing a large water heater and electrical panel. After looking for only a moment, he flipped back on *every single breaker* on the panel. 

Lights instantly came on and the sudden humming of my fridge reminded me that I should probably check on the food inside after this complete power outage. 

Shutting the door and making a point to lock it again, the guard turned to me and shook his head. “No touch.” He said. “No open door.”

I nodded, overly appreciative. As the tired and slightly irritated man exited my apartment I made sure to bow and call after him, “Gamsahabnida, Seonsaengnim!”

At that point I didn’t much care if my broken Korean was grammatically incorrect or too formal. It's the sentiment that counts, right?

Left alone in my apartment one again, I set my stuff down and opened a drawer to grab my largest kitchen knife. Prior to tonight I had no idea that the utilities for my apartment were accessed via that door. Why would *all* the breakers be switched off? After all, the only time I had not been home and in sight of that door was the hour I had been gone to that miserable Zoom training. 

Knife in hand, I began to do an amateur sweep of the increasingly unsettling studio I wanted to call home. 

# Lockdown Day 12

Still fairly new to the academy and only 8 years old, Jun-hee often had to translate more complicated ideas he wanted to convey to me. I didn’t mind my students occasionally doing this since it allowed them to more extensively communicate with me while they were learning English and I was slowly learning their language. He quickly typed his message into an app on his phone and showed me the translation by holding it up to his laptop camera.

*“Teacher, your appearance is poor. Do you have coronavirus?”*

My eyes widened a little and I let out a nervous laugh after being caught off guard. “No, no, no.” I reassured. “I am sleepy -” I used my simple, slower speech. “- and I am sad because we are not together!” 

That answer seemed satisfactory for Jun-hee and his classmates as I was met with “Awe’s” and “Fighting!” sentiments from the innocent third and fourth graders. They quickly dropped the topic and as we moved on to our conversation exercise I glanced in the window showing me on the screen.

They were right. I looked *rough.*

Dark circles had formed under my eyes - so much so that for the first time I actually spotted some clear reddening around them. Additionally, clumps of the eyelashes I had worked hard to grow and maintain had fallen out, leaving stark empty patches and accentuating my already unsightly look. 

I made a mental note to order some rehydrating skincare products and fake lashes, as well as to get to sleep earlier that night. 

# Lockdown Day 15

I hadn’t slept much, if at all, the past three nights.

Usually I could drink to ignore the odd sounds from next door or the light in my entryway flashing on and off. However, the past few nights had been getting exponentially worse and last night I simply laid awake, pounding heartbeat adding to the noise. I felt shaky and on edge the next morning as I sat at my kitchen table attempting to plan for the next week of online classes. 

A loud and sudden pounding at my door startled me in my seat. I wasn’t expecting a delivery, and certainly not a visitor in this pandemic climate. Confused and still on an adrenaline spike, I made my way to the front door and peered through the peephole while pressed against the cold metal. 

The hallway was empty.

Hesitantly, I slowly opened the door just in case something was left for me on the ground that I couldn't otherwise see. Once the door was fully open, I was met with a rush of frigid air and a sight that made my blood run cold. 

Standing before me was a man who looked to be in his early forties. There was nothing actually remarkable about him, except for the horrifying presence of a mid-sized hammer protruding from the top of his head. The presence of dried blood and exposed brain were unignorable on this otherwise unbothered figure. His eyes were blank, staring almost through me. My own mouth hung open, words failing to make their way out as I only let out a scratchy croak in my frozen terror. 

It wasn’t until a translucent hand reached toward me and he began to move forward did my body decide to do something.

Terrified beyond belief at what I was seeing, I stepped back into my apartment, frantically looking around for something to grab. My left hand landed on the handle of the kitchen knife I had left out on my cutting board and I quickly grabbed hold of it. 

Switching to my dominant hand, I held the knife out in front of me. At that moment, the only response I could muster was a panicked “Hey!” and “Stop!” in Korean but the man kept moving towards me. Without much thinking I began to blindly slash and jab at the man before me, hoping my simple corporeal knife could do something to the apparition. I felt something cold and wet hit my arms and face but the man didn’t seem to bleed. Instead, he opened his mouth wider than I have seen any human do and screamed before vanishing before my eyes. 

I just stood in my kitchen, knife in hand, for a long time after that. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It's been just over three years since I last saw the ghost that terrorized me. I still don't know if he was truly real or not. What I do know is that I didn't kill him, but rather what I thought was him. While I saw the horrifying ghost of an older man, what stood before me and my knife was in reality a health officer who was sent by the school I worked at. Apparently enough of the students had suggested to their parents that I might be ill based on our online classes that my employer had the health department check on me. 

My eyes and mind had utterly betrayed me.

There’s no use going into the details, but shortly after I traded my old studio apartment for newer and cleaner accommodations in Seoul. After the trial I was unable to be extradited to the United States but honestly, I’m not too upset with that decision. The mental hospital I was sentenced to is surprisingly quite attentive. My once poor Korean skills are nearly perfected these days with all the time on my hands and for the first time in over ten years I finally have my mental health under control in a healthy way. I was even able to gain offline computer privileges last month to allow me to practice my writing without hand cramps, even earning a couple allotted emails each week to be monitored and sent to my family back in America. 

However, the series of events from three years ago still plays in my mind on a loop these days. I've strained to find something - anything - that can definitively prove whether my mind was broken by a real entity or if it was the years of mental illness, some substance abuse and newfound isolation causing it to finally snap. Regardless, the ahjussi I once saw has never appeared to me since I left the apartment complex. 

Instead, Officer Lee Hwa-pyung watches me from the corner of my room as I write this, stab wounds and all. A deep gash across his neck leaves him nearly decapitated. His mouth hangs open in a silent, eternal, inhuman scream.
