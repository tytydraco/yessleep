“Dude, she’s not gonna show. It’s been thirty minutes. She probably chickened out.”

“She’ll come. Just give her a little more time,” I muttered, staring hopefully out the window.

“I’m giving her five more minutes. If she doesn’t turn up after that, we’re leaving. Deal?” Jake asked, extending a hand. 

“Fine. Whatever.”

I begrudgingly shook it. 

I turned back to the window just in time to see a black sedan creeping up the driveway. 

“Told you.”

Jake rolled his eyes while I made my way to the door. I threw it open as Sidney approached the doorstep. 

“*You’re* late,” I said, crossing my arms and tapping my foot.

“Fashionably, yes. Sorry, I overslept. Do you know how long it took to wash all that blood off? And don’t even get me started on that puddle of sludge on the floor.”

“Okay, that’s fair. Come inside. We were just about to get going.”

“Okay, sounds good. Hey, Jake.”

He nodded in response. 

We proceeded into the living room. Jake and I took the couch, while Sidney chose an armchair. 

“So, fill me in. What are we up against? I know you said it’s a clown, but is it like Pennywise or is it just a regular circus freak?”

“Pennywise is actually a pretty accurate description, unfortunately. I sent you the link to my Reddit account so you can catch up on my stories. The clown’s name is Mr. Pip, and he lives in this kid’s closet. He’s been gone for years, but he just showed back up. He was a character from the kid’s favorite TV show, but he’s not friendly. He’s all… wrong.”

“Alright, do we have a game plan?” 

“Yeah, we’re gonna bash his brains in!” Jake proclaimed, brandishing a wooden baseball bat.

“Jake, I told you to put that thing down. Go get the bowie knife from my room.”

“The baseball bat would’ve been cooler,” he mumbled as he slunk away.

“Also,” I said, turning to Sidney, “last time I checked, clowns aren’t big fans of taking a bullet to their noggin.”

I put a finger gun up to my temple and pulled the trigger, playing dead with my tongue lolling out of my mouth.

“You’re not wrong,” she giggled, flashing me a toothy grin. 

I blushed, unable to prevent the color from blossoming in my cheeks. 

“Okay, I got the bowie knife like you wanted, your majesty.”

“Thank you, ya lowly peasant. Now, let’s get a move on. We don’t know how much time we have.”

“Alright, where are we going?” Sidney asked.

Jake and I shot each other a glance. 

“Um. That’s a good question. We don’t know where this kid lives,” Jake admitted, staring at his feet.

“I thought you two were about to leave. Where on God’s green Earth did you think you were going?”

“Uh… we were just gonna figure it out as we went,” I murmured, wringing my wrists. 

“Yeah, because that would’ve worked *real* well. Does ‘this kid’ have a name?”

“His name is Michael. His parents are Daniel and Anna. I didn’t include a last name in the story.” 

“Wait. I used to babysit for a kid named Michael a couple years ago. Those were his parents' names too. Come to think of it, I do remember them having this weird rule about not going in his closet.”

“That can’t be a coincidence. Do you have any way to reach them?”

“Yeah, I still have the dad’s phone number, actually. I’ll give him a call.”

She whipped her phone out of her pocket and called the number she had saved in her contacts. 

“It’s ringing… Hey, Mr. Peters! It’s Sidney, Michael’s old babysitter… Yeah! It’s good to hear from you too!... I’ve been great! How are Anna and Michael?... I’m so glad to hear that! Look, Mr. Peters, there’s something I have to talk to you about… Well, it’s really important. I can’t say it over the phone. Would it be okay for me to come over later?... Yeah, six would be perfect!... Awesome, see you then! Bye.” 

She hung up and looked at us triumphantly. 

“Okay boys, get in the car. I’m driving.”

It was about a fifteen minute car ride. Sidney blasted Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo the whole way there. Not my style, but it was better than giving Jake the aux. We rolled up to a quaint little home in an ordinary suburban neighborhood. Cookie-cutter houses lined the street. Everything was pristine. I couldn’t find a single blade of grass out of place. The perfect family environment. 

“Man, I thought this place would be a little… creepier?” Jake uttered, eyes glued to the home we’d just arrived at.

“I don’t know what gave you that idea. You’ve read the story. They’re a normal suburban family. The only problem is the closet.”

“I just texted Mr. Peters. Let’s go.”

We hopped out of the car and trailed Sidney up to the door. She knocked and we waited. A middle-aged man wearing glasses and a button-down shirt and tie answered. 

“Hey, Sidney. Good to see you again! Who are your friends here?”

“This is Matt, and this is Jake.”

“Nice to meet you, sir,” I said, stretching out my hand. 

He shook it firmly, almost making me wince. 

“Nice to meet you boys. Come on inside. Just me tonight. Michael’s at a friend’s house and Anna is with her bunko group.”

He welcomed us into his home, and we followed him into the living room. There wasn’t much in terms of seating. Mr. Peters sat in an armchair, while the three of us crammed onto the couch. Of course, I got stuck in the middle. 

“Oh, how rude of me. Can I get you anything to drink?”

“No, we’re fine, Mr. Peters, tha-”

“Yeah, can I get a root beer?” Jake interrupted me.

“No, you can’t get a root beer! You don’t ask for that when you go to someone else’s house!” I hissed, trying to keep my voice hushed. 

“Sorry, son. All out of root beer. Anything else I can get you?” 

Jake’s cheeks flushed with color.

“No, I’m good. Thank you though.”

Mr. Peters disappeared into the kitchen.

“We are having a *serious* talk about manners when we get home.”

He re-emerged, juggling three waters and a glass of whiskey. 

“Oh, you didn’t have to do that! Thank you!” Sidney doted as he set down the refreshments. 

“Oh, please. After what a great job you did babysitting Michael? It’s the least I could do… So, excuse me if I’m being too forward, but why did you want to meet with me?”

“We know about the clown in Michael’s closet. We have reason to believe that he’s back. That’s why I brought these two along,” Sidney said, nodded to Jake and me.

Mr. Peters’s demeanor instantly fell. His face went ghostly white. For a second, I thought he was going to pass out.

“No. This can’t be happening. I thought we were rid of Mr. Pip,” he muttered, rubbing his balding head and pacing back and forth. 

“It’s okay, Mr. Peters. We’ll handle it,” I said, unholstering my .9 millimeter. 

He gulped.

“I-I don’t know. I don’t think you kids know what you’re getting into.”

“I can assure you we do. We wouldn’t be here if we didn’t. Could you show us to Michael’s room?” I asked, standing up, while beckoning my companions to do the same.

“Suit yourselves, but I am staying *far* away from that thing.”

He took us to Michael’s room and paused in the doorway. Sweat pooled under his armpits. We tentatively approached the closet. A chair had been wedged under the doorknob in a feeble attempt to trap the clown within.

“So, uh, what do we do? Just wait for him to knock?” Jake asked, white knuckling my bowie knife.

“No, that’ll take too long. We’re coming to him,” I said grimly. 

I tossed the chair aside and rapped against the closet door three times. It swung open, narrowly missing me. Inside was a magical world full of misshapen creatures of all kinds. The colors were all wrong. Purple grass swayed in the wind beneath a mustard yellow sky. A light breeze wafted from within. 

I glanced behind me to see everyone’s mouths hanging open like they were in a trance. Mr. Peters looked like he was going to collapse at any given moment, while my friends stared on in awestruck wonder. 

“Okay, are y’all ready?” 

Jake and Sidney nodded, still gazing off into space.

“Kids? Please be careful,” Mr. Peters squeaked, biting his nails.

“Will do. Let’s go.”

The door slammed shut the moment we stepped inside. I drank in the impossible scene around us. Disfigured blue birds floated overhead, smiling down at us with shimmering rows of perfectly white teeth. A green elephant stomped along in the distance. Its trunk had been reduced to an eerily human-like nose. Orange and pink spotted deer pranced through the fields; on two legs. We even watched a grizzly bear take flight, massive reptilian wings sprouted from the back of its turquoise frame.

“How is this real?” Sidney whispered as if speaking would attract the beasts’ attention.

“I don’t know. How are we supposed to find Mr. Pip in all this?” Jake wondered, scanning the hills. 

“Well, that red path looks promising,” I said, pointing to a small road constructed with blood-colored bricks lying directly ahead.

“Good eye little bro! I think you’re onto something.”

We followed the path in silence for what felt like an eternity, gawking at every strange whimsical creature along the way. We made slow progress, but eventually, we reached the end. A tall structure loomed before us, casting a dark shadow over everything surrounding it. It was a gray and black bouncy house. If Luigi’s Mansion was converted to a children’s attraction, this would be it.

“A bouncy house? Of course. Where else would a creepy demon clown set up base,” Jake muttered, rolling his eyes. 

“L-ladies first,” I said, gesturing to the entrance.

“Oh, no. *You* created this thing. It’s only right that you go first,” Sidney reasoned, motioning for me to lead the way.

I sighed. 

“Alright, here we go.”

The plastic inflatable door squeaked as I pulled it open. We stepped inside and found ourselves in a gloomy castle-like room. Lanterns jutted from the walls, bathing the room in a dim orange glow. The walls were painted to resemble stone, poorly drawn gray cracks spider webbing throughout the room. A grand table, like the kind you’d see in a Viking longhouse, stretched most of the length of the room. Silver plates and chalices adorned its surface. Beneath it lay a dark purple carpet, outlined in gold, that ended at the foot of a black throne. Gray balloons protruded from the back like knives. And atop it… sat Mr. Pip. At his sides sat a legion of balloon dogs of all sizes. They snapped and snarled viciously, baring sharp pointed teeth. 

He beamed at us from across the room, his nauseating toothy smile clearly visible even at that distance. That sinister grin sent a shiver up my spine. 

“Hello there, friends! Mr. Pip has been waiting for you!” 

The elation in his voice sent a ripple of panic to my core. 

“It seems my pets are excited to see you! Why don’t you play with my good boys?”

At that, the beasts charged toward us. 

Jake whipped out my bowie knife. Sidney produced a butcher knife from her belt. I pulled out my car keys. 

“How are these things not popping themselves with teeth like those?” Jake asked, slashing into a balloon Doberman.

“Your guess is as good as mine,” I said, wrestling with a chihuahua. 

*Pop. Pop. Pop.* Jake and Sidney made quick work of the clown’s plastic dogs. They never stood a chance. Sidney finished off the last of what must have been at least fifty balloon animals, the remnants of their rubber bodies strewn around us like confetti. 

“How rude! Do you know how long it took Mr. Pip to blow up all those fucking balloons?! You’ve made Mr. Pip *very* angry,” he bellowed, leaping onto the table. 

He crawled toward us on all fours like some kind of demented spider, allowing me a clearer view of his features. Mr. Pip radiated rage. His mouth hung agape as he crept closer, too many rows of jagged shark-like teeth bulging from his rotten gums. Foam dribbled from his lips like a wild animal. His face paint was cracked and chipping away. Black streams flowed down his cheeks like oil. His whole body was marred with deep scars and lacerations, some still fresh.

Silverware crashed to the floor as Mr. Pip smacked it away. I watched helplessly as he scampered toward us, thundering forward like a rabid animal. My heart pounded. I was paralyzed with fear. I couldn’t move a muscle. Sidney slapped me hard across the face. 

“Matt, the gun! Shoot him!”

“Oh, uh, yeah.”

I fumbled with the .9 millimeter, struggling to unholster it. Mr. Pip lunged forward, flying through the air, heading straight for me. Sidney screamed.

*Bang.*

High-pitched ringing assaulted my ears. I opened my eyes. Mr. Pip’s tattered body lay crumpled on the floor before us. Thick black liquid oozed from a hole in his forehead. 

“You did it! Not a second to spare either,” Jake noted, gazing at the abomination that had already begun to liquify. 

Sidney threw her arms around me. My face turned red. 

“Matt, you saved us!” 

“Aw, it was nothing.” 

Jake made a kissy face at me. I glared at him, shutting him down before Sidney noticed.

“I sure am glad that’s over. Circus popcorn and cotton candy later?” 

I narrowed my eyes at him.

“What, too soon?”

“Let’s just get out of…”

I paused mid-sentence. It was light but I thought I could discern soft whimpering from across the room.

“Do you guys hear that?” I asked, straining my ears. 

“Yeah. Let’s check it out,” Sidney responded, already heading toward the sound. Jake and I apprehensively followed behind her, brandishing our weapons. We anxiously approached Mr. Pip’s throne and peered behind it. A little blonde girl was crouched in the darkness. She was shackled to the wall with inflatable constraints. She shrieked upon noticing us.

“Hey, hey, it’s all right. We’re not going to hurt you. We’re going to get you out of here. We’ll take you home,” Sidney cooed, cutting away the girl’s plastic chains. 

“I’m Sidney. This is Matt and this is Jake. What’s your name?”

“Annie,” she mumbled, glancing up at us with tears in her light blue eyes. 

“What are we going to do with her?” Jake queried. 

“We’re going to take her somewhere safe. Somewhere she can play with other little girls and boys. Somewhere without *any* clowns. Isn’t that right, sweetheart?”

She nodded, hugging Sidney’s leg like her life depended on it.

“We can figure out what exactly we’re going to do later. Let’s get out of here. This place gives me the creeps.” 

We followed the brick path back to the closet door. Annie identified some of the strange creatures along the way, all her fear eventually dissipating. 

“That’s a blue jay,” she giggled, thrusting a finger at one of the nightmarish smiling birds hovering in the sky. 

“That’s a polka-deer and that one is an elecant.”

“That’s very cool. We’re about to take you home now, Annie. You’ll be able to make lots of new friends there. Would you like that?” 

She nodded and smiled from ear to ear, blonde curls bouncing up and down. 

Annie took Sidney’s hand. We opened the door and returned to Michael’s room. Mr. Peters had remained rooted to his spot the entire time, nervously awaiting our return. He breathed a sigh of relief, the tension evacuating from his face. 

“I’m so glad to see you all again. For a second, I thought you were *him.* Is it, um, taken care of?”

“Yeah. You won’t have to worry about Mr. Pip anymore,” I told him as Jake shut and locked the closet door. 

“Oh, thank goodness! You have no idea how much of a relief that is. There must be some way I can repay you. Oh. And who’s this? Hi sweetie.”

He waved at Annie. She hid behind Sidney.

“No, no. We won’t accept any form of payment. Your safety is enough of a reward for us. This is Annie. She’s a, um, friend. Thank you for allowing us into your home. But if you’ll excuse us, we have to get going. We still have *a lot* of work to do.”
