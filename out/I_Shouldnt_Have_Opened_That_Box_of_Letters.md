Hello,

So, I was hanging out with my friend Jameson one day when he told me about this box of letters his dad found in an old house. Jameson’s dad owned this auction company where they buy property of the recently deceased for a lump sum and sell any valuables at an auction.

They’ve found some cool shit over the years. Jameson’s house was mostly furnished with top-quality furniture Mr. Monty got for free from these properties. He even found a jet ski that the family had forgotten to take one time, but they had to sell it at an auction.

He took me to his shed, which was full of tools and fishing equipment. There, I instantly spotted the old wooden box. It was the size of a box you might store a TV in and looked like it was from another time period. I opened the top and sifted through all the yellowing envelopes inside. All the ones I saw were addressed to “mommy and daddy” and were written in bad handwriting.

“Where’d your dad get these?” I asked.

“Some old property in Bluff Wood,” Jameson returned. “I’m not sure who owned it. You know he is, doesn’t like talking about work in his free time.”

I started to open one when Jameson cried, “Hey, Brett! Don’t open that shit in here! I told you I don’t want to get cursed.”

“You’re 20,” I returned with a laugh. “Are you really scared of ghosts and monsters and shit?”

Jameson’s face reddened and I felt bad for making fun of him.

“Read some of these letters and you might believe in them too,” he said.

I laughed in my head that time, not even considering he could be right.

*Dear mommy and daddy,*

*I’m sorry I still haven’t come home yet. And I’m sorry for going too far in the woods. I know I’m not supposed to. I found a deer. It was so pretty and it wanted to play with me. I followed it but when I looked around, I didn't know where I was. Please don’t be mad. It was scary being in the woods by myself. When it got dark, I heard a bunch of scary noises, like bears and wolves, but I hid behind a tree so they couldn’t find me.*

*When it was daytime again, I tried going back the way I came, but all the trees looked the exact same. I fell over a rock and scraped my knee, but I didn’t cry. I was scared it would turn dark again, but the grey lady found me. She has a house in the woods that’s made of wood and mud. It’s a lot smaller than our house, but it’s warm because of the inside fire.*

*She said I can stay until you find me. She told me to write you a letter so she could give it to you. She said it would take a long time, though because the mailman doesn’t come to her house a lot.*

*Love,*

*Danny*

When I got the letters home, I dumped them on the floor of my bedroom and spread them out. It didn’t look like it from the box, but now seeing them on the floor I counted several hundred at least. Each had a date on the front, so I spent hours organizing them from oldest to newest. The dates ranged from one day after another to several months and even years between letters.

I managed to get through 20-25 of them before going to bed that night, but there were at least 1,000, probably more. A chunk of them were more boring than expected. At least half the letters I read were Danny recounting everything he and the grey woman had done that day or week. This could range from them feeding the chickens and washing clothes to exploring the woods near the cabin.

It was hard to imagine that someone writing a story would spend so much time on the mundane details of the lives of Danny and the grey woman. However, it was the more harrowing ones that kept me curious enough to keep reading. I figured if there was a good enough story in the letters, I could post them all online or even put them together in a book or something.

*Dear mommy and daddy,*

*Sorry I haven't written every day. I wanted to but I'm always tired after our chores. It's okay. The mailman still hasn't come.*

*I think I've been here for a week. I've been counting the days on both hands. There’s a lot of weird stuff about this place. I see things running in the woods that aren’t in my wildlife books. It smells funny too. She says I’m lucky because no one else gets to come here but I don’t like it. I can hear the monster walking in the woods, but I haven’t seen it. The grey lady stares in the woods for a long time when she hears it. She can hear it when I can’t, sometimes. Sometimes she shakes while she’s listening to it.*

*Love you,*

*Danny*

I’d been messaging Jameson about all I’d read in the letters and what I’d found about this grey lady, but he reiterated his desire to have nothing to do with them. I wanted to ask for specifics on where his dad found the letters, but I could tell he was already getting annoyed with me. Besides, it was kind of fun seeing what I could find based on the letters alone.

*Dear Mommy and Daddy,*

*I miss you. I keep crying and the grey lady doesn’t like it. She told me to quit calling her the grey lady. She wants me to call her mommy, but I don’t want to. Today, we had to do some weird stuff. She said it was to keep the monster away. She put mud all over me until I was brown all over, like Rocky when he rolls in the dirt. She made me cover her in mud too. She looked really scary in all the mud. But she said we had to look scary to scare the monster away. If the mailman doesn’t come, maybe I will get home before this letter.*

*I love you,*

*Danny*

The rituals they’d perform together were some of the strangest parts of the letters. In several of the letters, Danny described having to butcher an animal and leave it for “the monster.” He also said during full moons she’d make him sing and dance until his throat hurt and his feet bled. If he tried to stop, she would throw things like rocks and sticks at him.

The letters started to blur together. At a certain point, I felt like I was coming to a dead end, so I had no choice but to ask Jameson for more information from his dad. He said he would and, in the meantime, I gave him an overview of the stuff I'd read.

*Dear mommy and daddy,*

*She said I could call her Mrs. Everly instead of mommy. She said she’s been here a long time. She doesn’t usually talk to me much but she said she likes having me here. I don’t know why she’s so mean to me, then. Maybe she likes having me because she likes being mean to me.*

*Sometimes I pretend to be asleep but I know she’s watching me. She stands in the dark place between my room and the door and stands still. She does it a lot. One time I pretended to be asleep until the sun came up and she stood there the whole time.*

*I think she wants to hurt me but she’s too scared to be by herself with the monster outside. I hear it a lot. It sounds mad sometimes and scratches my window but I hide under the covers until it goes away.*

*Mrs. Everly said the mailman will come tomorrow to get my letters.*

*Love,*

*Danny*

I wasn’t sure how long I’d been awake at that point. I think I fell asleep for at least a few hours before waking up on my bedroom floor surrounded by letters, but it was hard to tell. After I got up, I went to Jameson’s house and knocked on the front door, but he didn't answer.

“Jameson!” I called up to his bedroom. “I know you’re here. You’re car’s in the driveway, dumbass!”

Jameson approached the windows and rolled his eyes at me. I waited for him to come downstairs, hoping I’d get a legitimate reason for why he was ignoring me over the last week. His eyes refused to meet mine when he opened the door.

“Dude, what the fuck’s going on with you?” I asked.

He finally looked up with wide eyes and stepped closer to me. I backed away.

“What’s going on with me? What’s going on with you?” he asked, pointing at my chest. “You’ve been calling and texting me all hours of the day, even when I’m at work. When I actually answer, all you want to do is talk about those fucking letters and that grey person.”

“Grey lady,” I said. “And I found out her real name is Mrs. Everly.”

“I don’t give a fuck,” he said before closing his lips tightly and sighing. Jameson stepped away and ran his fingers through his hair, something he always did when he was frustrated. “Brett, legitimately, what is your obsession with those letters? I know I said they were cursed, but I was just fucking around. You don’t actually believe that shit you’re reading do you?”

“I’m not obsessed,” I said with a laugh.

Jameson pulled out his phone and showed me the wall of text messages I’d sent him, hardly any of which he’d responded to. He handed me his phone and I saw most of the messages were either recounting what I’d read in the letters or asking him if he’d heard from his dad about the property.

“I’m… I’m sorry,” I said. “I didn’t think I was writing you that much.”

It hit me how many long nights I’d spent with those letters, locked in my room, barely eating. The exhaustion had finally hit me and I realized I hadn’t changed my clothes in days. I looked to Jameson who looked more concerned than I’d ever seen him.

“Look, man,” he said, “Why don’t you go get those letters and we’ll burn them or something in the backyard?”

My entire body clenched and my heart dropped. A sudden feeling of rage flushed through my body and I wanted to choke Jameson. But it went away in under a second.

“Uh, yeah,” I said. “Thanks, man.”

Jameson patted me on the shoulder and told me to come back by that evening. He said he’d have the fire ready.

\*\*\*

We stood side-by-side, watching the fire burn inside Jameson’s family’s fire pit. The letters sat behind us on the ground. I kept glancing back at them, hoping Jameson wouldn’t notice.

He continued feeding the fire while I sat to the side, thinking of how nice it would be to be rid of the letters. At least, that’s what I kept telling myself. I knew I needed them gone, but it was like my brain was begging for more.

“Hey, uh, is your dad home?” I asked Jameson.

He furrowed his brow at me and said, “No. You know he doesn’t get home from the auction until midnight. Why?”

I smiled and shook my head before looking at the fire. Jameson seemingly accepted my answer and returned to the fire.

It continued to grow over the next few minutes until Jameson was satisfied. He walked to the box of letters and brought them to the fire. I followed while clenching and unclenching my fists. I bit my lip and took several deep breaths. A fog filled my brain as if I were recovering from a hangover and seemingly came out of nowhere.

We stood next to each other in front of the fire and Jameson asked, “You ready?”

He lifted a chunk of letters from the box and held them to the fire.

“Wait,” I said, holding his hand back. “What if they’re, uh, valuable or something? Won’t your dad be pissed we just burned them?”

“They have a guy check all the stuff before they throw it out,” Jameson said. “These letters aren’t worth shit.”

Jameson tried to pull his hand back, but I wouldn’t let go. He gave me that same look of concern before trying to pull his hand back again.

“Dude, fucking let go!” he yelled.

“Give me the letters!” I yelled back.

He pulled one more time and managed to get away. He held the letters over the fire, but I leaped at him, sending us both to the ground. I scrambled up and got all the letters I could see in the area as Jameson screamed. I heard a crack as we fell, but didn’t check to see what happened. I grabbed all the letters and threw them back into the box before running back to my car and returning home.

*Dear Mommy and Daddy,*

*Mrs. Everly wasn't lying about the monster. I saw it and it almost got me. It wasn't the kind of monster from movies. It didn't have sharp teeth or claws. It was kind of like a person but tall and skinny like a tree. It had long arms and legs like a big bug and its face was fuzzy. It looked like the TV when it isn't working right.*

*I tried to run but every time I looked back it was standing there but in a different place from before. I was so scared. Mrs. Everly found me and made the monster go away. She said some words I didn't understand then it stopped following us. We were able to run away.*

*Love,*

*Danny*

I watched Jameson and his mom leave. Jameson was holding his arm at his side while cringing in pain. I felt bad that he'd gotten hurt, but he should've been such a prick about the letters, I thought while holding the box at my side.

When they were finally out of the driveway, I made my way back to the house and around to a side window. It was the way Jameson and I would sneak in after coming back from parties.

The window was stuck but I managed to get it up after a few tries. I spilled into the kitchen, knocking over a few dishes sitting on the counter. I figured I'd clean them up on my way out.

Jameson's dad, Donny, was old school and liked conducting all business from his home office. There was a large desk in the center with a bookshelf against the back wall. A dated computer sat on the desk with scattered papers all around it.

I searched through the papers, but it was mostly notes that made no sense to me, and receipts. I booted up the computer, which took almost ten minutes, and scanned through the files. Finally, I found one labeled “Property Ledgers” and came across the one dated for the current month. I emailed it to myself, which took another ten minutes, and slipped back out of the house.

When I got home, I looked through the ledger and saw a list of six homes, each with a list of items and their estimated value. Some of the items I saw were worth tens of thousands of dollars, including some old farm equipment. It was no wonder Donny got into this line of work.

After a few minutes of searching, I found one listed with “Box of old envelopes - $0.” The address associated was several miles outside town, on the edge of the forest.

\*\*\*

I stared at the house, thinking it could use a new coat of paint and replacement shingles. Other than that, the place looked well-maintained.

I rounded the house and heard something make a noise near the woods. There were leaves everywhere, so it was hard to walk through the area without making a sound. I slowly peeked around the house towards the woods but didn’t see anything in the immediate vicinity. Deer were common in my area, so I figured that’s what it was.

I stared for another moment when I heard a sound from the opposite end of the house. It wasn’t a voice, but didn’t sound quite like an animal either. I peered around to see if I could catch sight of whatever made the sound. Something poked from around the side of the shed. It was small and dark, like the snout of something.

My feet froze to the ground as I swear a claw or some other sharp part of this thing’s body clung to the side of the house. I watched the about go upwards as if the thing were climbing up the wall or possibly standing up. If it was the latter, the thing was at least seven feet tall.

“Hey!” Called someone, making me almost shit my pants. I turned to see a middle-aged woman standing at the edge of the field. I turned back to the shed to see whatever was staring at me was gone. I heard footsteps running away and decided it was just a deer and my brain had concocted the rest due to lack of sleep.

“I’ll call the cops if you don't leave right now!” She cried.

“I'm looking for someone related to Mr. Grayson,” I said. “I’m, uh, from the auction company and found something they may want to keep.”

She considered me for a moment before waving me over. She introduced herself as, Maggie, Mr. Grayson’s niece, saying she was there to put up a For Sale sign. I told her about the letters, explaining they were all signed by someone named Danny.

“I bet it was those are from that old vagabond that Uncle Mark let live on his property,” she said. “He stayed in a camper right over there.” Maggie pointed to a spot in the field missing a large patch of grass. “He worked for my uncle who kinda took pity on the guy. They had a falling out, though. I'm not sure why.”

“And his name was Danny?”

“Uncle Mark called him Dan,” she said. “His last name was Silas or Sorez? Something like that.”

“Do you know where he lives?”

She cocked her head at me.

“Please, I think he’ll really want these back.”

She thought for a moment before saying, “I'll call my uncle’s old office. We keep a record of all the employees new and old.”

She stepped away while making the phone call as I stared across the field, allowing a smile to form across my face.

\*\*\*

*Dear mom and dad,*

*I killed her. I didn’t mean to. It was last night and I’ve been sitting at the table ever since, staring at the pen and paper. I wasn’t sure I should write it down, but I think it’s helping. With her gone, I think the monster will come for me. If I do die and someone finds these letters, please take them to my mom and dad. I’m going to try to go home again. I don’t have any other choice.*

*Sincerely,*

*Daniel*

My hands shook as I dialed the number and a man answered. I introduced myself and asked if he was Daniel Silas. He responded that his name was Daniel Sorez and asked what I wanted.

I swallowed the spit that’d been collecting in my throat since I’d made the call and said, “I think I have your letters.”

He paused.

“Did you get lost in the woods in 1987?” I asked.

“Bring me the letters,” he said.

I paused, thinking this moment would never happen. I want to blurt out all the questions I’d been holding onto the last month.

“Bring me the fucking letters,” he reiterated.

“I will if you answer my questions.”

\*\*\*

Daniel lived in a trailer park a few miles from my place. I stared at the old, off-white trailer for almost 20 minutes before leaving my car. There weren’t any decorations on the outside. The only thing that told me the trailer wasn’t abandoned was the smoke leaving from the metal pipe sticking out from the roof.

I knocked several times before hearing movement inside. My entire body clenched as the sound of footsteps got closer. When Daniel opened the door, he wasn’t at all what I expected. I’m not sure what I was expecting, actually. But he looked so… normal, like someone you’d see at the grocery store or gas station without giving it a second thought.

His skin was wrinkled and spotted with freckles in various places. He looked to be in his late 50s and had a salt-and-pepper mustache.

We stood in silence for a few moments before he pointed at the case of letters in my arms. I’d almost forgotten I was holding them. I handed them over and he cocked his head, telling me to follow him inside.

The inside of his trailer was almost bare. He had a recliner, a TV, and a small dining room table in the adjacent kitchen. The place smelled like cigarettes and soiled cat litter with a slight hint of air fresheners as if he’d made an attempt to cover the smell. We sat at the table and he immediately examined the box.

“Um, thanks for agreeing to meet me,” I said, breaking the silence.

He didn’t look up from the box while opening it and sifting through the letters. “How did you find these?”

“A friend of mine bought a whole bunch of stuff from the Grayson property,” I said. “His niece said you used to live there and worked for Mr. Grayson.”

Daniel looked at me, then nodded. “You any read of em? Guess you’d have to know my name.”

“Yeah, I’ve actually read almost all of them,” I said. “I hope that’s okay. I just… I couldn’t stop after reading the first one.”

He was silent for a long time, looking at the letters one by one as if searching for a particular one.

“Um, I actually had a few questions,” I said before clearing my throat.

“Yeah? Like what?”

“Um, I guess… did this… did it actually happen?”

He finally looked up from the box, then leaned back and stared down at me. “What part?”

“Any of it… I guess?”

He let out one laugh and said, “Well, I did get lost in the woods when I was five years old and was out there for a long time.”

“What about Mrs. Everly?”

“What about her?”

“I assume she was real considering how detailed you were about her.”

“Oh yeah, she was real.”

“Did you ever find out who she was?” I asked.

He shook his head. “I wondered for a while if she was real or if I’d gone crazy while living in the woods, but no, she was real as sin.”

I asked him about the Grayson place where I found the letters and he said Mr. Grayson allowed him to live in a camper on his property during a particularly hard point in his life in his 30s. He was working for Mr. Grayson at the time.

He didn’t go into detail but had apparently overstayed his welcome at Mr. Grayson’s and was kicked off the property and threatened with a shotgun to the chest if he ever came back. He said he’d always planned on going back for the letters but eventually stopped thinking about them. At least, until I contacted him.

I took a deep breath before asking the next question. “Did you kill her?” I knew it was stupid to ask. I knew he could be dangerous and would hurt or possibly kill me knowing that I knew what he’d done, but I had to see his reaction.

“Yup,” he said matter-of-factly, surprising me. “Good luck proving it, though. From what I’ve found, the bitch never existed.”

“No,” I said, “I, uh, I don’t blame you. She kept you locked up for years it seems and, some of the things she did to you...”

His eye twitched and he cocked his head but didn’t say anything.

“How’d you find your way back after she died?” I asked.

“She taught me a lot about the woods; what to eat, what not to eat, how to listen to animal sounds for signals about what was happening in the forest, and how to track game. By the time she was gone, I knew how to survive in the woods until I found my way out.”

We were silent for another few moments. He shifted in his seat, telling me he was ready for me to leave, but I still had another question. One I wanted the answer to more than any of the rest.

“The monster,” I said. “Was it real or did Mrs. Everly make it up?”

He paused, then said, “Yeah. It was some lie that crazy bitch told me to make sure I didn’t leave.”

“Oh,” I said, my head sinking. “It’s just… you described it in a lot of detail in one of your letters.”

“Look, kid, when I say Mrs. Everly was fucked in the head I’m not exaggerating. Sometimes, she would give me this tea that made me see things. It kept me anxious and scared. That’s what she wanted and it worked.”

“Oh, well, you never mentioned that in the letters.”

He leaned forward. “Do you really need to believe there was a monster out there in the woods and not just someone lonely woman whose mind finally broke after a lifetime of isolation?”

I sighed and nodded my head. “Well, thanks for telling me all that. Could I just ask one more question?”

“Why not?”

“Did you ever go back?”

“To the cabin? Why the fuck would I do that?”

I shrugged my shoulders. I wasn’t sure why I asked.

“The only reason I would go back to that place would be to burn it to the ground. That answer your fucking questions?”

His tone told me it was time to leave. I watched the trailer in my rearview as I drove away, trying to force myself to feel like I’d found the ending I was looking for.

\*\*\*

When I got home, I noticed something sitting on the front porch. It was an envelope, one worn and dirty like the ones in Daniel’s box. I figured I dropped one on the way out. However, my name was written on the front. I thought I was seeing things at first, but there it was, in black ink, my name.

*You want to know more? You want the truth of what happened to Daniel? You want to know the secrets of the woods? I've got the answers for you. Below, you'll find a list of instructions to find me:*

*Pass the tree line into the forest, any tree line, and stop at the first clearing you come upon. Sit on the ground for one hour, moving as minimally as possible. Follow the deer.*

*Signed,*

*Mrs. Everly*

The letter sat on my desk for a long time. It sounded insane but what part of this wasn't? Part of me wanted it all to be over. I could go back to having friends, thinking about college, not spending all day in my room either researching missing kids cases in the area or reading more letters. But I knew I couldn't stop. Something inside wouldn't allow me.

I followed the instructions, traveling to the closest state park and walking into the first dense area of trees I found. The first clearing was mile or so inside and was filled with yellow and purple flowers. I found a spot to sit and closed my eyes, listening to the wind and sounds of insects and birds. Everything was calm for a moment.

An hour passed and I looked around for signs of a deer. When I didn't see any, I laughed to myself, thinking the letter must've been a joke or some petty revenge from Jameson. I stood up and started back the way I came.

When I reached the edge of the clearing, I saw it peeking from the trees. A small doe staring right at me. We stared at each other for a few minutes before it turned and walked into the woods.

It walked the trail with the ease and comfort of an animal three times its size. I paused wondering if I should really follow this deer into the woods. If this was actually “the deer” it meant there was something strange in these woods that couldn't be explained by normal conventions. Does that mean there was actually a monster out there?

We came to a small ridge at the end of the trail. The deer turned to me before jumping off the ridge. I ran to it and saw the cabin sitting several yards below in a shallow ditch. It was small and appeared to have been there for decades without any maintenance.

I could go back now, I thought. I could be satisfied with what I'd already found out and move on. I stared for a while before taking a deep breath and making my way down.

 

\*\*\*

 

It was quiet and dimly lit inside. Dust covered all areas of the small interior, which only featured a coffee table, a few chairs, and a fireplace. I moved through the cabin, looking for any signs of life when I heard a shuffling behind me. I turned and saw a figure sitting in one of the chairs, hidden in the darkness.

“Have a seat,” the figure said in a woman’s voice, motioning to a chair across from her.

I did as she said, feeling my blood run cold as I scanned her face, looking for any distinguishing features. However, the darkness perfectly encapsulated most of her head, except for the bottom of her chin, which was wrinkled and had one long strand of hair.

The rest of her body that I could see was also wrinkled and dirtied with some black substance, maybe coal?

“Are you… Mrs. Everly?” I asked.

Her chin moved. “I am,” she said, the coldness of her voice making me shift in my seat.

“And you kidnapped Daniel Sorez?” I asked.

She laughed. “Kidnapped is a strong word. I helped him find his way here if that’s what you mean.”

I gulped. “You scared him into staying here by saying there was a monster in the woods.”

“There is,” she said. “You read his letters, correct? Did you read the one in which he described it?”

“...Yeah. You drugged him.”

She laughed, which made me clench my fists.

“It's not funny!” I yelled.

I couldn’t believe how much I was pressing her, but something about being in this cabin, knowing she actually kept a kid here for decades, it pissed me off. Plus, the woman had to be old as fuck at that point. There wasn’t anything she could do to me.

“He also said you died,” I said.

She laughed but didn’t answer, making me clench my fists tighter.

“In the letters, you were so horrible to him,” I said. “How could you do that to a kid?”

Her chair creaked and she moved her fingers along the arms. “I was jealous of him at first,” she said. “This new… being to the world with a family that loved him and a whole life ahead of him. It's what I thought when I first saw him through the veil.”

“The veil?” I asked, but she ignored the question.

“I hated him for it,” she said “Why did I waste my entire life in this one fucking place and he gets to be free!? What was so different between me and him? I was a little, cute kid too.”

I had my answer and my ending. All along, it was just a crazy old woman who kidnapped an unsuspecting kid, fed him drugs, and beat him until he built up the courage to leave. It’s the ending I always expected, but not the one I wanted.

“I think you should come back with me,” I said. While I doubted anyone would believe my story or prosecute a 90-something-year-old woman, I thought maybe the letters and testimony from Daniel would help her get the punishment she deserved. 

“I can’t leave,” she said. “I thought you read those letters. The monster is out there.”

“It let Daniel leave,” I said, humoring her.

“Bah,” she spat. “It never liked him.”

 “So, what is it?”

“I'm not sure where it came from or how long it's been here. Maybe it's always been here, but it attaches itself to those lost in the woods. That's how it found me so long ago.”

She continued, “Every time I tried to leave, it pulled me back. I think it likes having someone here, in this sad excuse for an actual home, like a pet.”

“Little Danny, I saw him just on the other side of the veil. I convinced it to let me get Danny so I wouldn't be lonely, though I had ulterior motives, I'm afraid. I thought maybe it would take Danny as my replacement. He could be its new pet and I could spend the remaining years away from here. Come to find out, you're stuck here even after you die if it likes you that much.”

It took me a moment to notice I’d stopped breathing. Goosebumps filled my arms and my heart was beating like I’d just run a marathon.

Slowly, Mrs. Everly stood up and moved towards me. I was frozen to my chair as her body entered the tiny sliver of light, piece by piece. Her feet were grey with dark toenails, several of them missing from each foot. Her legs were covered in scars and deep purple veins. She wore a dirty, white gown with tears all through it, revealing wrinkled spots of pale skin and musculature as if some of her wounds never healed but stopped bleeding.

Finally, I saw her face. Like the rest of her, it was covered in scars and deep cuts. Her eyes were cloudy and sounded by dark circles.

A loud screech sounded outside. It was the most horrible sound I’ve ever heard, like a mix of a cougar’s scream and tires screeching, amplified as loud as a concert. After a few moments, it stopped and I said, “I need to leave!”

“You’re through the veil now,” Mrs. Everly said, now wearing a soft smile. “There’s no leaving for us.”

The screech sounded again, though Mrs. Everly didn’t react, still smiling.

“Why? Why did you bring me here?” I asked.

Her smile grew wider than should've been possible. “I do what it says. It wanted you here… I think it likes you.”

\*\*\*

I don't know when I'll be able to leave. I’ve tried a few times but it keeps stopping me. It’s just as Daniel described, a tall, monstrous thing with no face. There are no clues in the cabin as to what it is or where it came from and Mrs. Everly has been no help at all. I’ll find out, though. I know I will, and once I do, I’m going home.

If you're reading this, I'm guessing the monster, or whatever it is, likes you too. I put a handful of Daniel’s envelopes in here too, just the ones I kept without telling him.

I know based on Daniel’s letters that they don't always end up in the place you want them to go, so if you do receive this, please let my mom and dad know what happened. You'll find their address below.

Sincerely,

Brett Sanders, 19
