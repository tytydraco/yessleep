I can't remember when it started. It was like a slow, creeping thing, something that slithered its way into my life and took hold of me. At first, it was just little things. I would forget where I put my keys, or the name of someone I had just met. But then it began to escalate.

It was like I was living in a haze, everything blurry and indistinct. I would look at my hands and they seemed foreign to me, like I was seeing them for the first time. Sometimes, when I looked in the mirror, I didn't recognize the face staring back at me.

It was like I was disappearing.

And then, one day, I woke up in a hospital bed. I didn't know how I got there, or what had happened to me. The doctors told me that I had been in a car accident, that I had suffered a head injury. But it didn't feel right. It was like they were keeping something from me, something that was just out of reach.

I was discharged from the hospital a few days later, but things didn't get any better. If anything, they got worse. I would wake up in the middle of the night, screaming, my heart pounding in my chest. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me, waiting for me to let my guard down.

And then, one day, I saw it.

It was like a shadow, a shapeless thing that moved in the corner of my eye. At first, I thought it was just my imagination, a product of my damaged brain. But then it began to take form.

It was like a person, but not quite. Its limbs were too long, its fingers too sharp. It had no face, just a gaping maw that seemed to stretch on forever. And it was always watching me, always waiting.

I tried to tell people about it, but no one believed me. They thought I was hallucinating, that I was still suffering from the effects of my head injury. But I knew it was real. I could feel it in my bones.

It began to follow me, everywhere I went. It was like a shadow, always lurking just out of sight. I would catch glimpses of it in reflections, or see it darting around corners. And every time I saw it, I felt a cold, sickening fear in the pit of my stomach.

I began to withdraw from the world, staying inside my apartment for days at a time. I stopped answering my phone, stopped seeing my friends. The only thing that mattered was the shadow, and the terrible, creeping feeling that it gave me.

And then, one night, I woke up to find it standing at the foot of my bed.

I could feel its breath on my face, hot and putrid. Its eyes were fixed on mine, and I could feel the weight of its gaze like a physical thing. And then it spoke, its voice a low, rumbling growl.

"Remember."

And then it was gone.

I don't know what it means. I don't know what it wants from me. All I know is that it's always there, watching, waiting. And I'm afraid that one day, it will consume me completely.
