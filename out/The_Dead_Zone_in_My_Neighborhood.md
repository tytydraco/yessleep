 grew up in a suburb where nothing ever really happened. The weirdest thing we had was an old man who mowed his lawn in the middle of the night. That was, until the summer a new cul-de-sac was being built at the end of Birchwood Lane.

The construction crew worked fast, but once the road was paved and the foundations were in, everything stopped. No workers. No machines. Just a perfectly paved circle with empty lots. The only thing left was a single porta-potty and a rusted backhoe.

After a few weeks of nothing, we started calling it “The Dead Zone.” The grass grew over the gravel, and trash began to pile up. But no one ever touched it. Not the city, not the neighbors. It was like people collectively decided it wasn’t their problem. And I mean that literally — GPS didn’t even recognize the new road anymore. It was like it had never been planned at all.

Then came the night I walked through it on a dare.

It was early August, the air sticky and hot even at 11 PM. My friend Caleb dared me to walk around the full circle of the cul-de-sac and come back. Seemed easy. I remember walking slowly, the gravel crunching under my sneakers, my flashlight beam shaky from my nerves.

That’s when I noticed it.

There was no sound.

Not the wind. Not a single cricket. No distant cars. Just… nothing. Even my footsteps didn’t echo. It was like my ears were muffled. I got halfway through before I realized that the shadows didn’t line up with my light. I pointed my flashlight directly at the backhoe.

The light stopped. Like, stopped mid-air. It was shining, but the beam just… ended three feet in front of me, like hitting invisible glass. Then the light started to bend. I know how that sounds, but it bent, like how heat warps the air, except this was in one concentrated area. It formed a shape.

A person.

They were blurry, like TV static. I couldn’t see their face, but I could hear something — a humming noise, not from my ears, but inside my head. It got louder the closer I got. My hand moved without me realizing it, reaching toward it. As soon as I touched it, the figure vanished, and my flashlight turned off on its own.

I ran.

When I got back, Caleb said I was gone for almost half an hour. It felt like five minutes. I didn’t believe him until I checked my phone. 26 missed calls from my mom. 11:04 to 11:33. I still can’t explain that.

A few nights later, I went back alone. This time, I stood at the edge and just listened. I heard whispering. Dozens of voices. All saying the same word, over and over.

“Stay.”

I left and never went back.

A month later, the city quietly tore up the road. No notice. No announcements. It was like the cul-de-sac never existed. When I checked Google Earth, the most recent image showed the empty street, but every time I refreshed, it pixelated into a blur.

It’s just trees now.

But sometimes, when I walk my dog past the area, he growls at nothing. And I swear, in the dead quiet of night, when everything is supposed to be asleep, I hear that word again, whispered like a warning from the trees:

“Stay.”
