I am officer for the Idaho state patrol and I’m stationed in the southeast corner of the state near the Utah Border. My name is Jason Reeves, I am 34 years old, 6’2” 190 pounds, I have a darker complexion, and light stubble, I have a wife and 2 sons.

Life on I84 isn’t too interesting just the occasional drunk driver or kid who decides to push a car they can’t afford to the limit. I recently encountered an older gentleman broke down on the side of the freeway. He was in a late fifties Dodge Pickup Truck and his engine blew. He did not have a phone so I called in a tow truck for him. He requested a ride back to his house and that he would compensate me for my time. I declined the offer as it’s my job to make sure he safe anyway and offered to drive him home for free. 

He got in the cruiser and gave me directions to his residence, an old cattle ranch that had seen better days. He invited me in to his house, I realized that my shift was over anyway and he probably didn’t get much company so I figured I would accept. As we walked into  his house I was immediately struck by the smell of cigarette smoke and the sound of old country music on a crackly old radio. It seemed as if I had just travelled back in to the 1950s. 

We sat down in his kitchen at a table that looked like it was old when Lincoln was president. He thanked me for my time. He offered me a glass of whiskey but I had to explain to him that I was still in uniform and had to drive my police cruiser back to the station. For a couple hours he told me stories about his exploits in World War II and his short lived rodeo career. I finally decided to go home and handed him my card and told him to call me if he needed anything.

The next day was as usual pulled over a high school kid who was clearly under the influence and a couple people who were bending our lenient 80 Mph speed limit. As I sat parked on the shoulder of the road I got a phone call from an unknown number. The old man’s raspy voice took over as I accepted the call.

“Hello Officer Reeves, it’s me Jake, you gave me a ride the other day and I have something important to tell you.”

My shift just ended so I drove out to the old ranch. I knocked on the door, no response, knocked again, nothing, knocked a third time, still nothing. I opened the door as it was unlocked. I made my way into the house and walked into the kitchen. There the old man was sitting at his kitchen table, he had a colt M1911 on the table he was cleaning and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth. Upon seeing the weapon I approached with caution.

“Sir what are you doing with that?”

“Relax son, take a seat, you need to listen.”

I approached the table and sat down. He slid the pistol to me. I had no intention of confiscating it I mean this is Idaho. Besides the photograph on the table was of greater interest. The picture depicted four men in SS uniforms, 3 of them had their faces crossed out in red ink except the last one who had a circle around his head. Jake looked me dead in the eyes.

“He’s coming back and he wants blood.”

I didn’t quite know how to answer that I mean it’s very unlikely any of these men were still alive even if they escaped Germany they would have been hunted down.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

He reached under the table and pulled out an old cardboard box. He started pulling things out of it. A picture of what a presumed to be Jake and a girlfriend of his, a couple medals, pictures of a man also presumably Jake riding a bucking horse and a trophy buckle. He finally pulled out a stack of letters, all dated between 1946 and 2009.

“Sonabitch has been taunting me for damn near 80 years and I’m going to end it.”

“We’ll sir with all do respect you can’t just kill a man in cold blood even if he is a sack of shit we have laws. Besides what makes you think that he’s still alive the last letter was 13 years ago.”

He pulled out another letter dated January 31st 2022. It said “long time no see yankee scum. Our numbers are building once more and we will soon exact our revenge on your pathetic nation, starting with you. Happy Valentines day. -O.S.” I studied the note, it reeked of death an gave me bad vibes. At first I thought he was just a delusional old man but a threat it a threat. So I finally grew a pair and straight up asked him.

“Who the hell is O S and why does he hate you so much? What is his motive to harass you?”

“Otto Steiner was the one that got away son, you see back in ‘45 when we started finding them camps we really started cracking down on them SS boys.”

“Alright, and why is he targeting you specifically?”

“You see them bastards had been sending some of their boys out west to try to harness some of that Indian magic. Then SS types were really into that occult shit. Of course at the time none of us believed it. Hell we laughed it off as a sick joke. But the whole skinwalker thing gave me the chills even back then.”

“Skinwalkers? Aren’t we a bit far north for that type of thing?”

“Well you could say that but these bastards tried to weaponize them and my squad just happened to capture the four officers in charge of it. Steiner killed his whole family in that cottage outside of Berlin and he got away. Them other three weren’t so lucky though.”

“I see and why hasn’t he killed you yet then?”

“Well they die if they come in contact with you and you call them by their real name. I reckon he got some more followers to get me out of the way, I’m the last man left in my squad and once I’m gone I suppose he’ll make his move. That’s why I’m telling you this if you can spread the word maybe there’s a chance to stop him.”

“Alright sir I’ll put it in the report and we’ll have officers look around from time to time.”

After I got in my car I just stopped and thought about it, I mean hell it’s kinda weird this is happening but it’s probably just a case of Neo Nazis harassing this old man for a sick thrill. As I pulled into the station SGT. Harrison came over to me.

“What the hell happened Reeves?”

“Excuse me Harrison?”

He pointed at the passenger side of the car and sure enough the whole passenger side was covered in claw marks and a giant swastika was cut into it. I had failed to notice im when I left as it was facing away from the front door. My shift was over but we sent a couple men out to investigate the area again. Somethings going on and it’s giving me some very bad vibes. We’ve had a lot sightings of fucked up looking wolves in that area and the whole ordeal is creeping me out. Anyway it’s getting late I’ll update you guys when I hear what the other troopers have to say after their investigation. Stay safe out there.
