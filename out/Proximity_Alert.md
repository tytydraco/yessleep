It was an average day at sea, me and my crew were headed to the submarines for our dive down to what we were pretty confident was the SS Mary Diamond, an ocean liner of which sunk in December of 1922.

The SS Mary Diamond vanished one day, all that was found was a lifeboat with its insignia. 

The sea was calm, the wind was still, all was perfect for a dive. As me and my 4 other crew members got into the submarine, the oceanographer lost his sea legs and therefore opted out of going down due to a bad feeling.

He was replaced our back-up option and away we went. "One hiccup per mission" I told myself. Maybe this was a way to calm me down from the depth I knew we would have to travel, a depth even deeper than Titanic, yet all worth it to uncover the mysteries behind the SS Mary Diamond.

It was around an hour into our dive we had the first alarm, nothing out of the ordinary, just a proximity alert, it could be a fish, a random piece of trash sinking to the ocean floor, anything really, we pushed forward and it went away.

The second alarm came as we were around 20 minutes from the ocean floor. The proximity alert came on once again, although this time was more concerning, this time we could see something on our radar.

The oceanographer just looked at me, her face was pale, she was obviously frightened by something. I asked her what the problem was and as she opened her mouth to speak..

"Ah! There's something out there!" screamed the marine biologist. I asked him what he had seen and he said he never saw anything like it and it appeared similar to a shark

I told him to breathe and calm down and he did over some time. 20 minutes later and we saw the ocean floor, on the radar we could see the large ship, no one had been down there before so we had no idea if we were really about to find the SS Mary Diamond. 

After 5 minutes, her bow came into view and we had realised, this is it, this is the SS Mary Diamond. Me and my crew celebrated, forgetting all the troubles to get down here. It was truly beautiful.

We went all the way up to its stern and back and we then launched our camera to go inside the wreck. Oh how beautiful it was, for a ship that had been under the water for 102 years, it had done amazing to keep in this good condition.

We went all inside the halls and searched it, we then found something no one could of foreseen. A nest, full of these shark like creatures of which had taken the SS Mary Diamond as home.

Everyone including the marine biologist was confused, this was a new species of shark, they lived deep underwater and nested, it was a strange yet amazing find, a win for both biology and history. 

As we were mesmerised by the sight, one of them attacked our camera, sinking it fast. 

We were devastated about the loss of our camera as we hoped to see more however, our disappointment was short lived as all of a sudden.. 

"Proximity alert!" Loudly throughout the speakers of the submarine 

We checked the radar and saw 2 large moving objects heading towards us, it then clicked, we were in the nest of juveniles of this species and whatever we saw earlier tried warning us away.

We immediately started to accent but we would get hit from the side, we were lucky it only caused a slight dent that held or else we would of imploded. We made the decision to use the emergency accent module and risk imploding.

We eventually reached the surface, we were lucky that the dent in the submarine held through and got us home.

We spent a further 2 days inside the submarine as our crew on the boat didn't want to let us out after such a fast accent and risk the bends.

We did survive however and now only the robotic cameras are aloud down there. To this day we are the only humans to ever be down there.
