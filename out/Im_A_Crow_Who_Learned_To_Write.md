Some say I talk too much, but I am certain I talk as much as possible, and that cannot be too much. If I talked more than that, then I'd agree that I talk too much. I am very humble, and I am a talking crow, named Cory, and I am very wise, intelligent and beautiful, but also very humble. I am so humble, in fact, that it actually makes me better than you, because I am certainly more humble than you are. I know this because I know those sorts of things. That's what wisdom is for, silly.

I once said: "Silent wisdom is worthless." and I was saying so because I am not impressed by reservations and stoicism and thoughtfulness. Those icky things lead to silence, to a lack of words, and since the more words there are, the better, then the less there are the worse.

I've got a tremendous backstory with lots of magical mysteries and frightening adventures. I can speak several languages including English, although it often seems inadequate to express the ideas of other creatures, such as cats or the nameless ones or the language of the primal vampires. Heck, even my own ideas can be too sophisticated and honest to be expressed by this backwards language. My thoughts will prevail, because my mistress has seen how I peck at the keyboard for the first eleven words of this story, and she summoned a dragon into her computer. Now I just say "Dragon, type what I say." and it writes "What I say." on the screen, which is super great, because I can talk way-way-way faster than I can peck at the keyboard with my beak. Also, Dragon autocorrects the spelling I was having issues with.

I am a sorcerer, that being that I can generate my own magic naturally and I can also learn and cast new spells crafted by others. I must say that spelling the words of my story are about as important as the components of a spell, the exact ingredients and intonation of arcane syllables must by precise, or the results will vary.

I assure anyone who is here to learn magic from me that this is lesson number one. Whenever you hear the phrase "results will vary" you should be cautious. You wouldn't want a drug that makes you sleep to have a variation of six hours, and you wouldn't want a spell that causes sleep to have a random nearby target. These are facts.

I'm not going to teach you magic, so if you were hoping to learn some of my spells, you will be disappointed. That doesn't mean you'll learn nothing useful. I am a veritable font of unobtainable secret trivia, the answers to all of life's riddles and the teller of the funniest joke anyone has ever laughed at.

Since I am certainly smarter and wiser than you, there is no way you can read my story and not benefit from my words. Therefore the more words I say, the more you'll benefit.

I suppose that is enough about me, as I am so humble it truly pains me to talk about myself so much, but I must give you an honest appraisal of how impressive and wonderful I am, otherwise you might not have guessed, since my humility would have obscured my superior mind.

The story I am to tell begins on the day my mistress became an adult. Before her eighteenth birthday, we lived in the ruins on the fringe of your world. I am sure you are sensitive enough to realize that the world you live in is very fragile, and that you live in a time of Dusk, in a time before the looming cataclysm. Yes, your world will catch up to ours, but now we are in your world. My mistress did this, brought us here, herself, her sister, myself and her baby.

Her name is Penelope Justice Briar-Leidenfrost and her sister's name is Persephone Briar and the baby is named Franz, and the baby has no gender, so I'll just call the baby Franz and avoid pronouns. None of us are related at-all. Persephone has different parents, although the sisters believe they have the same father, because he raised Persephone as his own, and never told her he wasn't her father. They also have different mothers, and Franz has no mother. Penelope found the baby under a cabbage leaf and decided the baby was hers. She loves Franz as her own, reminding me of her father.

Okay, so at the time I am writing this, the girls are fully aware they aren't blood relatives, but at the time the story takes place, they have no idea. It isn't really that important, except to contrast the facts with our familial bond. The love we have for each other is sincere, and depends not upon the advantage of caring for relatives, but rather upon the choice to choose and care for someone who is technically only a friend.

Penelope had wandered the grounds of Leidenfrost Manor, and it was the day we went to the creek that we saw the shimmering veil between worlds was damaged, and open to another, less ruined landscape. It was not by choice that we abandoned our old home and those we left behind, but rather a shift in the veil's location from across the creek to all around us.

In our new world, it is unclear how we already belonged. It was as though there were sockets for our souls waiting to be fulfilled. It felt like we had come home, and left behind some kind of awful encampment. We even found their mothers, Dr. Leidenfrost and Isidore, eventually, and although they had never seen their daughters before, they were somehow, paradoxically, the exact same women, just from a different iteration of the dream of life. In this world, they were somehow aware of our existence, and had somehow missed us, and somehow waited for our arrival.

This is a concept of high magic, primal stuff, and there is no easy way to explain how we arrived and replaced our own non-existence with ourselves. Within days our memories of the old world began to fade, and it was as though we were here in your world all-along.

I reminded my mistress that whatever reality we had escaped was not separate from this reality. Everyone we had known would be here or come here, for this was now the real world, and ours was gone. Additionally, there was a great concern, that this world would also end, especially if we did nothing to try and stop its destruction.

Penelope asked me what we should do, but for all my wisdom, I had no certainties.

"If your father were here, I think he might know what to do." I admitted with my perfect humility.

"So, just when we need him the most, he is absent. Typical." Penelope pouted.

"From this point on, we must continue without him." I advised her. "Perhaps also without resentment towards him, clouding what we instinctively know he would say or do. While your father made many mistakes, you were not one of them."

"You just say random things. I need real advice." Penelope rejected my words. It occured to me that she was no longer the little girl who was so delighted by my counsel. It saddened me, because I felt like something was lost in the transition between the girl, the teenager and the woman. Whoever she had become, her flaws seemed to be cynicism and disdain, especially towards her father.

I hoped that somehow, during our adventures, she would grow and mature and become who she could be, somehow the wondering and curious and delighted girl I remembered in that moment. She didn't mature back into childhood, and I admit it was a silly sentiment to hope she would, and instead she matured into someone who I am sure you will fall in love with.

Eventually, with enough confidence and room to grow, she'd become the best version of herself, and we'd see again and again that nurturing, honorable and dedicated nature of hers like the day she had found and adopted Franz.

Penelope sat at the kitchen table, tapping her fingers nervously on the worn wood.

"I’ve been thinking," she began, her voice quieter than usual. "Things don’t add up. The patterns… the small things… it’s like something is trying to lead us somewhere." She paused, glancing at me, her ever-present crow companion, perched on the windowsill. "Or maybe it’s trying to tell me something."

I cocked my head, sensing the weight of her words. "Oh, Penelope, I do love when you begin to notice things that make the air shimmer with meaning. Do tell me—what strange, mystical riddles have you encountered this time? And remember, your observations will be infinitely more valuable now that they are spoken aloud, which, as you know, makes them exponentially more important."

Penelope rolled her eyes but smiled despite herself. "I noticed it first with the baby—Franz. Ever since we arrived in this world, every time the moon is full, it gets restless. Crying. Screaming. Like it's seeing something in the night we can't. But it's not just the baby. Last week, when Persephone was at the market, she bought a bundle of herbs from that strange vendor—the one with the mismatched eyes—and when she touched them, the bundle *pulsed*. I know I saw it."

I ruffled my feathers, intrigued. "A pulse, you say? A pulse that was not of this world’s rhythm. Quite curious indeed. What else? Do tell me you’ve found more clues to unravel the mystery!"

"Every night, the shadows shift in ways they shouldn’t. And the birds...," she trailed off, a grim expression settling on her face. "The birds don’t sing at dawn anymore. It’s as though they know something we don't. The whole world feels like it's holding its breath, waiting."

I stared at her, blinking slowly. "Ah, now we're getting somewhere. It sounds like something, or someone, is trying to manipulate the very fabric of this world, to weave it into something else. A disruption in the natural order of things—an unraveling, if you will."

Penelope leaned forward, her voice low but steady. "I think... I think there's a pattern. All these strange occurrences—they’re all leading to something. It’s like a map. But I don’t know what it is yet."

I flapped my wings, causing a flurry of feather-duff to drift around her. "The patterns you speak of, Mistress, are not as benign as you might hope. The world may be quietly bending under the pressure of forces we can’t see—forces that would sooner unravel the very threads of existence itself."

Penelope looked at me with a mix of determination and fear. "And what do we do about it, Cory? If it’s all leading to the end, what can we possibly do?"

I puffed up, my chest swelling with the kind of wisdom only a crow of my stature could possess. "Ah, Penelope, there is *always* something to be done. You have the power, the knowledge, and the will to make a difference. Magic is a tool, a force, a language to be *learned*. It has its flaws, of course, but when wielded with purpose—especially by someone as gifted as you—it can stop the unraveling."

Penelope raised an eyebrow. "Magic...?" she echoed, almost sarcastic. "You mean more than the silly tricks we’ve been doing? Because I’ve seen magic rip apart worlds before, Cory. We *barely* made it out of the last one."

"Ah, yes, I recall your… *drama* with the previous world. But this one, my dear Mistress, is not so easily undone. This world is more resilient, more resistant to decay. However, the patterns you see are no coincidence. They are the weave of fate, drawn together by a purpose yet unclear. The good news, however, is that we can change the course of fate if we act swiftly."

Penelope was silent for a moment, her eyes distant. She was thinking, plotting. "What kind of magic do we need, then?"

I hopped down to the table and landed next to her hand. "Ah, well, there is a particular kind of magic—an ancient one—that could help us. But it is risky, and dangerous. It requires not just skill, but trust. Trust in each other, and trust in the world around you. You’ll have to unravel the mystery of the world’s threads, much as you are unraveling your own fate. But, as with all things, the deeper you go, the more the world may fight back against you."

Penelope looked at me, her lips pressed into a firm line. "I’m ready, Cory. I won’t let this world fall like the last. Not if I can stop it."

"And I, of course, shall be by your side as ever," I said, my voice laced with both pride and a touch of playful sarcasm. "For I am, as always, the wisest of beings, and it is *you* who must walk the path, though I will undoubtedly point you in the right direction with my impeccable wisdom."

She smiled then, a soft, rare smile. "Then let’s figure this out, together. We’ll stop whatever’s coming, and we’ll do it on our terms."

I puffed out my chest proudly, flapping my wings in a majestic display. "Of course we will, Mistress. Together, we will face the unraveling of worlds and restore balance. After all, who better than us? After all, we *are* the ones who have always known when something is terribly wrong."

And as the conversation died away, the wind howled through the trees, carrying with it the faintest whisper of the end, and the spark of a new beginning.
