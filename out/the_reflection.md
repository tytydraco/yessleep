I was walking home late at night I had just moved to the city about three months ago and was enjoying the newfound independence.  
 Even if it came with some drawbacks such as having to work multiple jobs to pay my rent.  
   
As I walked down the street I heard my footsteps echoing in the empty silence, each sound magnified by the oppressive stillness of the night.  
I had grown accustomed to the solitude of the night, to the sense of isolation that seemed to settle over the city like a heavy fog.  
 But tonight was different. Tonight, there was something in the air—a palpable sense of unease that hung over the city like a dark cloud, casting over everything it touched.  
I kept my head down, and eyes fixed on the cracked pavement beneath my feet, trying to block out the sense of dread that gnawed with each passing minute.  
 I knew I shouldn't be out alone at this hour, knew the dangers that lurked in the shadows, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being drawn toward something—a force beyond my control that compelled me to keep walking, to keep moving forward into the unknown.  
As I rounded a corner, I thought I saw something in my reflection in the window of a darkened storefront. I could have sworn I saw something though I couldn't be sure. then in a moment of curiosity, I turned back around to see one of my reflections staring back at me, but there was something off about it—something... wrong. It moved with a fluidity that seemed almost unnatural. I moved to get a closer look and I realized that when I moved closer it didn't move with me. I rubbed my eyes believing I had to be tired I expected the reflection to return to normal, but it remained unchanged its eye seemed off it sent a shiver down my spine.  
 I backed away from the window. Was I hallucinating? Was my mind playing tricks on me, or was there something truly sinister lurking in the darkness? I walked away and started to head home.  
I tried to shake off the feeling of dread that clung to me like a second skin, but it only seemed to grow stronger with each passing moment. The city felt different now, somehow darker and more menacing, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.  
I quickened my pace, footsteps echoing off the walls of the alley as I ran through the empty streets. But no matter how fast I ran I couldn't shake the feeling of being followed I turned around expecting someone to be there but there was no one.   
By the time I reached my apartment building, I was trembling with fear and exhaustion. I fumbled with my keys, hands shaking so badly that I could barely get the door open. And when I finally stepped inside, I collapsed onto the floor in a heap, my breath coming in ragged gasps.  
I tried to tell myself that it was just stress my imagination—that I was letting fear get the best of me—but deep down, I knew that something was wrong. The reflection in the window had been real, and whatever was behind it was still out there, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.  
As Maya lay there, her mind racing with a thousand terrible possibilities, she couldn't help but wonder what horrors awaited her in the night. For in the city that never slept, nightmares lurked around every corner, and Maya was about to come face to face with her worst fears.  
Hours passed in a blur as Maya lay awake in her bed, her thoughts consumed by the events of the night. She tried to shake off the feeling of unease that clung to her like a second skin, but it was no use. The memory of her reflection's twisted visage haunted her every waking moment, a constant reminder of the darkness that lurked just beyond the edge of her perception.  
When sleep finally came, it brought with it a torrent of nightmares—vivid, terrifying visions that left Maya gasping for air, drenched in sweat, and trembling with fear. She dreamed of shadowy figures lurking in the darkness, of eyes that watched her from every corner, of a malevolent presence that whispered her name in the dead of night.  
When she woke, Poor little Maya was shaken to the core. She tried to tell herself that it was just a dream—that none of it was real—but deep down, she knew that something was wrong.  
The days that followed were a blur of anxiety and paranoia. Maya couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched, that someone or... something was lurking just out of sight, waiting for the perfect moment to STRIKE.  
 She avoided mirrors whenever possible, unable to bear the thought of seeing her reflection's twisted visage staring back at her once more.  
But no matter how hard she tried to convince herself that it was all in her head, the feeling of dread that gnawed at her from within only seemed to grow stronger with each passing day.  
 She felt like a prisoner in her own home, trapped in a never-ending nightmare from which there was no escape.  
And then, one night, as Maya lay awake in her bed, listening to the sound of her ragged breaths echoing in the darkness, she heard it—a soft, insistent whisper that seemed to emanate from the shadows themselves.  
"Maya..."  
The voice was faint, almost imperceptible, but Maya knew that she wasn't imagining things. It was real, and it was coming from somewhere inside her apartment.  
With trembling hands, Maya reached for the lamp on her bedside table, her heart pounding in her chest as she switched on the light. The room was bathed in a soft, warm glow, but there was no one there—no one but Maya and the darkness that surrounded her "Maya..." was all she heard.    
But then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the whisper was gone, leaving Maya alone in the silence once more.  
She lay there for what felt like hours, her mind racing with a thousand terrible possibilities. Was it all just a figment of her imagination, or was there something truly sinister lurking in the darkness? She couldn't be sure, but one thing was certain—she wasn't safe, not as long as whatever was out there still lurked in the shadows.  
As dawn broke over the city, Maya rose from her bed, her body weary and her mind heavy with dread. She knew that she couldn't stay in the apartment any longer, not with whatever was out there still hunting her, still waiting for the perfect opportunity to make its move.  
With trembling hands, Maya packed a few belongings into a small bag, her movements frantic and desperate. She didn't know where she was going or what she would do when she got there, but she knew that she had to leave, had to get as far away from the city as possible before it was too late.  
she puts the last of her things in her car and drives off putting as much distance from this nightmare and herself as she can... that's what SHE THINKS BUT NO MATTER HOW FAR SHE RUNS YOU CAN NEVER ESCAPE YOUR REFLECTION MAYA.
