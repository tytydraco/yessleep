It’s been over 2 weeks since I saw the photo of that damn eye and read that stupid journal, me along with a few other family members and friends are being haunted by something unworldly. It started off with weird dreams but its progressing to more than that. Now I can’t sleep even if I wanted to as I always hear sounds in the house now including scratching inside the walls and the occasional dreaded moan or cry.  
  
I want to get more help on this but I’m so afraid of spreading this haunting or curse or whatever this is to anyone else! Let me start from the beginning. A few weeks ago, I was cleaning out my late Aunt’s attack and came across a dusty journal that was buried underneath a bunch of clothes as if it was trying to be hidden on purpose. When I first opened it, I came across a weird black and white photo of a super creepy looking eye that freaked me out. As for the rest of the journal, it was in Tagalog (I should mention I come from a Filipino family from my Mom’s side) and unfortunately I don’t speak it but my Mom does so I had to ask her when I got home later to help me translate it but from what we gathered it seemed whoever wrote the journal mentioned to “never look at the eye” and “don’t think about it.”  
  
We thought it was just something silly and honestly it sounds like a journal that came from a crazy person but then…weird unsettling things started happening in the house me and my Mom noticed. First it was just me experiencing these things…then my Mom also who was very skeptic at first until one night while we were eating dinner, my Mom made a pot of her favorite curry and when we opened the pot to stir it we saw creepy disfigured faces inside of the stew before a cup slid across from the table and onto the floor.  
  
To be honest…that is the most minor thing that has been happening and I wish it would just go back to that. I rather see the faces and expressions of people experiencing agony in a bowl of soup and a sliding cup compared to what I’m experiencing now.  
  
At first, I thought it was the journal itself causing the haunting, but it’s actually a picture of the eye itself. I took a photo of it and sent it to a few friends and they too started complaining that weird things been happening in their homes and are starting to blame me for sharing the photograph of the eye with them. One of my friends in particular has OCD issues and he says he’s struggling to stop thinking about it as its making the activity in house get worse and he is starting to see something manifest in the corner of his peripheral vision.  
  
I will never forget the horrifying night about a week ago where I heard something outside make a loud thump sound onto the roof around 3 am. At first, I thought maybe it was a bird but the sounds it made sounded ungodly as if it is something I should never have heard with my own ears. Since then, I keep hearing something loud flying around outside at night but every time I look outside, I don’t see anything, it’s like I keep missing it for some reason. Maybe its toying with me?  
  
I try my hardest to heed the warning in the journal not to think about it, but it’s so hard not to. Especially when I wake up with my usual sleep paralysis and see the dreaded eye on my ceiling blinking back and watching me sleep. I’m scared to get help with this as I’m afraid of making whatever it is stronger and as I said my friends that even caught a glimpse of the photo of the eye started having problems in their homes. Whatever this is, it’s extremely powerful and dangerous.  
  
I also can’t help but noticed since I saw the picture of the eye and brought the journal home, there have been a lot of bats appearing outside during the evening hours. I know we have bats here in my area and this is usually normal…but the amount of them seems to be getting worse.  
  
As for the terrifying dreams, it’s always the same thing…I always end up in a creepy unsettling house with many doorways where some lead to absolutely nowhere. I usually end up finding a child rooms or nursery in the dream and that seems to be the only “safe” zone. Everywhere else I wander I’m always being followed by something or feel like I’m being watched.  
  
My Mom went to some relatives she knows back home in the Philippines and one of them thinks it can be something called a “Manananggal” does anyone know how to deal with such a thing? And I know you probably suggest burning the book and the picture but I’m afraid of making this worse by doing so.  
  
I’m just tired of experiencing the dread when I wake up randomly in the middle of the night what might happen next as time goes on. As for my friends they too have described hearing weird scream and screeches at night along with the sound of something flying. The worst one out of all of us is definitely my friend with the OCD. He had to take time off from work due to his paranoia to what it going on and I’m starting to worry about him and he refuses to answer my messages now when I text him. I think I made him really upset by mistake and probably blames me for everything.
