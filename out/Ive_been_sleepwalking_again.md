I have been a sleepwalker during times of great stress since I was around three years old. I didn't find out until I was about nineteen and pregnant with my son. I noticed things moving around in my house and aches in my legs when I'd wake up. I'd also wake up doing really weird... tasks? I woke up at 3:04am pulling all the clothes out of my closet and packing them.

I'm not going to lie, I was soooo sure I was pregnant with a ghost or demon. But my rationality kicked back in and I did the only thing that actually made sense. 

I reached out to my estranged mother to ask if anything like this had happened while she was pregnant. She said that it'd never happened to her but that I've always been a sleepwalker. She said that when I was a child I would just leave the house walking what appeared to be no where in particular but always very determined to get there.

After I had my son I stopped. This may have been due to just unfounded exhaustion of having post partum depression and anxiety. Not having a lot of help from my husband or just the general exhaustion of having a newborn.

Now that's all well and good. But I've started sleep walking again. This time seems different.

We just moved to a new home a few weeks ago. The move was easy. The house is already unpacked. Our old house is clean, painted and back on the rental market. Nothing stressfull is happening at work or with my family or friends.

The last week I've been waking up in the strangest places. I've woken up in my basement next to my suitcase. I've woken up on the stairs to my house with keys in hand. I have woken up in my closet. 

The last two nights were absolutely the weirdest though. The night before last I woke up at my front door. Keys in hand. Bag fully packed (!!!???!!!). I think the click of the lock woke me up? I'm not really sure. 

Last night I woke up in the alley. I had my keys in my pocket, I was fully dressed in clothes that I usually don't wear unless there's a special occasion. I was wearing socks and shoes and about half a block away from my home. The scary part I guess would be that there was something... I don't know sticky? on my hands. It was warm and sticky and dark. There are no lights in my alley. They either burnt out or were removed by the person in the closest house due to the lights shining in their window. 

I walked back home where I found my door unlocked (so why did I grab my keys?). I went in and washed my hands in the sink. Changed back into my pajamas and went back to bed. I figured going back to sleep at three in the morning when I need to wake up at six was a good enough chunk of time. I could at least get a nap in before work.

  
When I woke up this morning though my feet were covered in mud? I know for sure that they were clean when I went to sleep after my first sleepwalking event. 

I don't know where I would be going, what's stressing me out enough that I'm sleep walking again, I don't know how no one else in my home has noticed me doing this. I'm waking up with bruises on my arms and legs but I'm just assuming that's asleep me running into things in the new house? 

I don't know what's going on but I'm nervous that I did something in my sleep. Do you have any advice on how to find out what I'm doing?
