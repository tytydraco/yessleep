There is a curse of Reddit that I have became a victim of. It has now spread enough and it wants me dead. Very soon, it will come after you.

There is someone, something that is doing this. You need to be prepared.

Firstly, get off Reddit. Please. If you do not want to become severely exhausted, because you are not allowed to stop typing, leave this post and leave Reddit, now.

Oh, you're still reading. Well, it is now your responsibility.

This curse is going to spread all over the reddit very soon, I believe.

Let me explain.

If you spend enough time on r/LetsNotMeet, a situation **will** be created on your life that could be uploaded as an incident on that subreddit. And let me tell you, you coming out alive is not guaranteed. Not at all. Your friend may come out alive and write that incident and post it. The **thing** doesn't care about you.

The **thing** is very beautiful, of course.

The only characteristic I could understand about this . . . **entity** is that it is starting to become more and more hungry for the content. It has started affecting lives just so that they can uploaded in text format here and it could devour on it. Maybe, that is what it wants.

The **entity** is very good-looking, of course

I have a habit of reading the most voted post on any subreddit at first. So, when I discovered r/LetsNotMeet a few weeks ago, I did the same. I read the 'The man on my patio'.

It was a good story and though it was horrifying at first, the kindness shown by u/Pesfie678 was truly inspiring.

As soon I finished my reading, I heard a noise at my door. Someone was knocking on it.

I watched through the ring-hole and a chill went down my spine.

There was that man, exactly as described in the incident.  A tall guy with black hair covering half of his eyes and brown liquid running down from his mouth.

But he wasn't making meowing noises. He was calling me, asking me to come out and meet him.

He knew my fucking name.

I immediately backed away and dialed 911. As the call was received, I looked in my ring-hole again.

The man was gone.

"What the fu--"  
"911, what's your emergency?"

I described them what had happened and they said they will look into it as soon as possible.

As I sat down, shivering and trembling, I couldn't understand how did that man came on the top most floor without being noticed by cameras, security and even by the people around. And then a chilling realization hit me.

I read another horror story on r/nosleep: "'How do I get my girlfriend to knock off this annoying habit?"

As soon as I opened it, I heard a whistling in front of my door.

I fucking screamed at that moment, but the whistling didn't stop. It only stopped after I closed the post and closed down Reddit as well.

My conclusion was correct: Every experience, story I read on this subreddit, would happen to me too.

One more thing I realized, I was not able to access normal subreddits. Only the ones which contained something scary, something which would unnerve you, that were the only ones I could access. Sure, I could see that they existed on the internet, but once I would click the link, the links were said to be broken.

And then, the worst possible situation that could happen, did happen.

Every monster of every horror story I ever read appeared in front of me.

They all surrounded me, just staring at me.

They were above me, below me, on my right, on my left. They were everywhere. And they were staring at me.

The monster, the humans, the dead bodies, the animals, all just looked at me.

For a few seconds I couldn't move a muscle and then I screamed, but they stared just as intently.

A few minutes later, I mustered up the courage to ask, " What do you want?", which was full of stutters.

They all replied in perfect unison, almost in a robotic way.

"You have always been taking. You have been selfish. You give nothing back. We entertained you. Your mind was fed with gripping fear by us, yet you did nothing to give back, did you? Now you shall be giving back to us."

That's right you stupid fuck, you right now got cursed too.

I told you to stop reading. I told you to get away. But you didn't, as expected.

Now **it** is after you and **it** will come to you.

You stupid fuck. Let me give you a little detail of the Plan:

This is not the only cursed post, but this is the only post with a warning. Others don't.
