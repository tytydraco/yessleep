I only met my grandmother once, when I was only 8 y/o, after that, my parents stopped talking about her, and got mad at me if I asked questions about her. As I grew older, I was always curious about why they won't allow me to visit or even speak to her.

Now, I am 20 y/o, and I still remember the adress of my grandma's house. I was wondering if she still lived there, or if she was even alive, but I decided to give it a shot and rented a car.

I arrived in around 2 hours, her house was still there, a beautiful large house. I got out of my car, went to the door and knocked. She almost instantly opened the door. She looked the same, it was like she never aged. I hugged her and then she invited me to come inside. We talked about why my family cut contact with her, and I started believing that my parents were the assholes in this situation.

It got late, grandma showed me my room, which looked like it was recently renovated. It was very cozy, I immediately settled there, but before leaving, I saw her frown, it was like a new soul entered her body, because she has been very happy right before. She handed me a list of rules. At first I thought it was a joke,but she told me to read the rules carefully, or something bad will happen.

I started reading the list:

These rules are essential if you want to survive the night here, so please read them carefully.

Rules for staying at grandma's

1. Keep your lights on at all times.

2. Never, and I mean NEVER leave your room after 1:00 AM. If you need to go to the bathroom, refer to rule 2a.

2a. Look around the room for something to urinate in, if you don't find anything, pray for exactly 3 minutes. (It doesn't matter if you're religious or not). After that, you have exactly 5 minutes and 36 seconds to go to your closest bathroom. If you fail to return in time,find a way to kill yourself, it is better than what they will do to you.

3. Your grandma will check your room at these times: 2:23 AM, 2:56 AM and 3:45 AM, you should be in bed by those times. If you are not, tell your grandma you're sorry 5 times, if she says "It's okay, but go to bed" you are safe, try falling asleep. If she says "I forgive you" refer to rule 4.

4. Grab the nearest sharp object and stab your grandma's neck. If you fail to do so, I hope your pain tolerance is high.

5. After 4:00 AM you will hear your grandma loudly screaming your name. Ignore her, she is not your grandma.

6. If you hear knocks on your door, be careful. If there are only 2 knocks, BE QUIET and pretend that you're asleep. If you hear 5 knocks, open the door, it is your real grandma.

6a. Your real grandma will only come inside your room if you have broken one of the rules or if you're in immediate danger. Once she is in your room, pay attention to her behaviour. If she sits on the bed next to you, you're safe for the rest of the night. If she stands in front of you, there is no hope left, you have 10 seconds to kill yourself before she teleports you to hell.

6b. If you get teleported to hell, close your eyes and beg for forgiveness. If they forgive you, you will be sent back to grandma's house and you will be safe for the rest of the day. Otherwise, if they're angry, pray, because the things they're gonna do to you are unimaginable.

7. At 8:00 AM you must get out of you bed, and slowly walk towards the kitchen downstairs. Eat the food she gave you and do not under any circumstances talk to her. Ignore her if she tries starting a conversation. After breakfast, you are completely safe for the rest of the day.

Enjoy your stay! :D

At first, I thought this was a prank, but when I remember how serious my grandma was when she told me to follow the rules, I decided to follow them.

I could not fall asleep, I kept thinking about the rules.Suddenly, I hear my grandmother enter my room. I check the time, it's 2:23 AM. I start panicking, I get on my knees and tell her "I'm sorry, please forgive me" 5 times. I wait for her answer. She calmly says "It's okay, but go to bed". I calm myself down and get on my bed. However, when I realised what happened I started overthinking again.I started browsing the Internet because once again, I could not fall asleep.

Later, I start hearing my grandmother screaming my name. I could tell it was not my real grandma though, its voice was very high pitched and not human-like, and immediately after, I hear 2 knocks on my door. I could feel tears running down my cheek, I thought I was going to die there.I couldnt't help but start sobbing, then I realised what mistake I have done. I now hear someone knocking exactly 5 times on my door. "Maybe grandma will save me now" I thought. I open the door, Grandma looked mad, She walks into my room and stands right in front of me. I panic and start running. I leave my room and go downstairs, I walk into another smaller bedroom and I hide in a closet.

From upstairs, I hear Grandma sobbing, screaming, calling for help. I passed out, but after I wake up, I realise I am back in my bedroom. It's 7:58 AM, so I start walking towards the kitchen, still unsure if I had a nightmare or if what I experienced was real. Grandma and I were quiet while we were eating breakfast, but after we finished she looks at me and unhappily says "You left your room, right?"
