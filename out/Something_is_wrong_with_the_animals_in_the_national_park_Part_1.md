Hello everyone. I'm not actually active here, I just read along from time to time. But I think I just have to write this down somewhere because it's been on my mind.

I've been working as a national park ranger for three months now. Before that, I was a carpenter—so I spent my whole life working with wood, not animals. It's nice to see something different for a change instead of always just my own tools and workbench. In these three months alone, I feel much more connected to nature. I love the peaceful atmosphere—not the constant sound of sawing a wooden board or the noise the wood makes when a file glides over it. It's just nice to be outside, to hear and feel nature. The wind blowing through your hair, the sounds of the animals, and the rustling of the wind through the leaves.

That's why I'm not sure if I'm just imagining it. But lately, the animals here have been acting strangely. It's little things that caught my attention at first. Birds, deer, even little squirrels—they just stand still and stare in one direction. Sometimes they stare at me too, and it's not that normal "oh, there's a human" stare. It feels different. It's a feeling of unease, almost as if there's more behind those looks.

And just to be clear: no, I'm not paranoid, I just think that these subtle differences can only be noticed when you deal with them every day. Yesterday, I saw two squirrels sitting on the ground staring at me—almost as if they felt sorry for me, which is one of the reasons I decided to write this down. It wasn't just a guess in the sense of "Oh, they're staring at me right now," but rather a feeling that tells me there's more to it than that. I usually see squirrels here in the national park almost every day, but this time they just stood there—very still, almost as if they were frozen.

Shortly after, I heard a rustling in the background and, of course, had to investigate. To my surprise, it was a deer with the most beautiful coat color I had ever seen. I crouched down in a bush so as not to scare it away and continued to watch what it was doing. It looked back and forth in a panic, as if it were going into a bush to pee and checking first to see if anyone was around who might see it. Luckily for me, it didn't notice me, and strangely enough, I was able to watch it repeatedly tapping its antlers lightly against branches of varying thickness on a tree. It did this rhythmically, and because the branches were of different thicknesses, you could even hear a kind of melody—call me crazy, but that's not normal. 

You thought that was creepy? Well, listen to this: I saw birds jumping off branches, only to flutter back up to the next branch just before they hit the ground. It was as if they wanted to swing from tree to tree. When I tried to get closer to watch them, they quickly flew away as if they were fleeing from punishment. However, I've come to terms with this phenomenon, as I've been able to observe it more and more often. Of course, it's still a bit creepy when you see it from a distance, especially because several birds do it at the same time, and it looks like they're throwing themselves into mass suicide.

But that's just the beginning; I have much more to tell. But first, I wanted to ask if anyone else here has noticed this—the feeling that there might be more behind the animals' gazes.

I have to get ready for my night shift now and will be in touch again when I observe something new.
