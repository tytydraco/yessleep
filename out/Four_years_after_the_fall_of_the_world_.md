The night all changed I was in my room. Well, no— not actually the night.. More like, when it became evident that something was fucking wrong. 

Let me get back, shall we? 

Oh-hoho, that was stupid. 

Okay, I live in Panama. Sweet home, latin American country, not the city in Florida. Even Germans know what Panama is Panama. You "Americans" should start thinking out of your Pizza, Truck and Burger homeland. 

Alright, the Panama Canal. Do you get it? 

Like, a month back, the world was chaos. Let me explain: Even if I am from Panama, in the american continent, I am not from the same Earth as you, probably. 

No, I am from Earth but not your Earth. Earth 27, to be precise, from timeline 27, of course. Not a cool name as you could expect from other Universe, I know, but still. I think it's... cool. 

Another word for cool...?--

Anyway. It's the year 2024, the same as yours I guess, I am sending this to Earth 616. Hell yeah, like the Marvel movies. Just. Because. I. Can. 

It's 2024 in Earth 616, or at least, that's the date I'm sending this and the other recordings I am making, starting now: The Begging. 

I am Mikaela, by the way. And for being fifteen, I survived. You must be confused, but if you've read this far, I appreciate it. Well, pay attention from this point on. English is not my native language, but I am confident of my knowledge about the subject, enough to be able to express myself properly. Did I said that right? 

In Earth 27, there's an apocalypse--

Hang on to that for a moment, nedda fix something.

"..."

".. FUCK-- IT'S DAMN HOT!" 

"..." 

Hi! I'm back. Just needed a good cup of tea with milk and cinnamon—mmm, yummy. I almost burnt my hand but, meh, I'm good. 

Back to the context, I suppose I gotta explain how I pretend to send this to a.. Different dimension? Than before the apocalypse. Sounds crazy and hard to believe, 'cause, how on Earth I could be saying such a thing, right? Not pun intended! 

I bet you're thinking I am high or something. 

That isn't the case. You see, when I was little, born in 2009, Michael Jackson died, Bitcoin was created, Obama being the 40th president in USA, Disney XD. Remember that channel? My dad used to hate it. All those things, remarkable things that I think that could've happened on other Earths...

But here? Hear this out, there was an Alien Invasion. 

Creatures came from the sky with technology nobody had ever imagined back on 2000's. At first, us humans were scared, we thought it was our end. Then, we understood the aliens meant no harm, and we became friends. 

That's what school books taught us years later, what my mom used to tell me when I wanted a story, hugging her or sitting on her lap at nights. 

She was a big fan of Sci-fi, Star Trek was her favorite. My dad's was Star Wars. I liked Doctor Who. Funny, isn't it? We used to debate about the shows, and my only reason to really like Doctor Who was David Tennant. I still liked the Eleventh Doctor, didn't like Karen Gillan as Amy that much, though. 

When the Aliens became our friends, they shared their knowledge and technology too. We evolved and became a better version of humanity with their help. 

Somehow, in just my fifteen years of life, we managed to reverse global warming, pollution, extreme poverty and inflation. We were all happy, and although we had to take extreme measures to end overpopulation, we managed to make the earth a healthy place again. Healthy and beautiful. Science advanced far enough, and when our friends from space felt we had learned enough too, they returned to their planet, many galaxies away from Milky Way. That was what they said.

Great minds created technology capable of traveling between dimensions, or universes, as you better understand it. That includes, timelines. The Eiros, as we named the aliens, understood time so well that they are almost part of it, and we were fortunate that they taught us. Time is not linear, but we are forbidden to travel into what we understand as the past. The computers that run the "time machines" cannot access dates before your present. That is, if it is Thursday, January 23, you cannot make a jump to Wednesday, January 22. It does not even appear on the choice screen for new jumps. Changing past events is extremely dangerous, after all. 

Anyway, not everyone has the privilege of affording a machine, and since it's not taboo, illegal or unknown to us, we don't even care to travel to the future anymore. 

Umm... Sounds not very credible, does it? Yes, there are people who are still interested in what will happen? But as I said, not everyone can afford it. Since it is not an indispensable expense, the use of the machines is not supported by the government. 

The machines actually have two modes: "time jumping" and "dimension shifting", and they are mostly used for research. The government does sponsor such research. 

There are listings of different worlds and their history, not just Earth, as well as alternate lines where you might be an exotic bird, for example! Or a rock.

So, that brings us to the present. Year 2024, Tuesday, February 27, date of recording of this video. 

You might wonder, in such an advanced world, what could have gone wrong? A lot of things, actually. 

A week ago, news of an eye infection that only affects adults in the population became official. If you were over 18, or had a hormonal imbalance, and were infected, this virus became deadly. 

But before this, there news and rumors around the world, news about an animal being sighted wandering around partially paralyzed. They called it the "Zombie Deer". I won't go into details, as it has nothing to do with the story if you look at it correctly. It turned out that it was not harmful to humans unless you fed on the meat of a deer with that "condition", but since the signs that the animal was sick were visible in plain sight, no one was going to consume that. 

This was in December 2023, they soon forgot about it. I tell you this because at first people blamed this event for what was happening. And what was going on? Well, that's where the eye virus really comes in, which happened after the zombie deer. Because collective panic makes you not think clearly, people incorrectly linked the two things to each other. The media didn't help, giving misinformation to the population every week.

"Are you following?" 

"Good. Let me take a sip of my drink."

Slurp.. 

"Ahh. Perfect."

“…”

The eye virus is contagious if you touched an infected person, or through body fluids from that person, such as tears, saliva, sweat and even sexual secretions. It is not known how this detail was discovered! 

Basically, if you were in direct contact with a sick person, you were toast. 

Quarantines were implemented, similar to how Covid was treated on Earth 616, there were rounds of medical checks and lots of anti-contagion security. Not many doctors died, but many more people died compared to other historical pandemics. 

This virus is caused by a bacterium that grows in low-light places. In my country, it originated in the old and abandoned facilities of Minera Panama. Some men went to do "urban exploration" and fell into a pool of water that did not move. After the fright, they managed to get out, but both of them already had the bacteria in their bodies. It attacks the nervous part of your body, and mixed with the old chemicals that had been there for years, the virus mutated and melted their bodies. 

Once the bacteria turned your brain to mush, the first visible signs of infection showed. The family members, just at that stage, tried to take them to the doctor. Result: they were already sick and the other personnel who attended them were also infected. 

We are a Latin American country... What did you expect? On the country side, the conditions of living are not-so-better than the city.

Soon, a lot more of cases were reported to the sanitary authorities, but it was too late. It spread like a rumor in a small town.

We thought.. We could survive it but.. It wasn’t like that. 

“Hah…”

“I could keep recording but.. The camera is running out of battery, need to charge it.”

“Chao, night!”

….

Beep.
