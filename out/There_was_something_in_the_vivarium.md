I've been working in a lab for the first time as an undergrad lab assistant for about 2 years now. It's kind of an isolating environment. Everyone is just kind of working on their own projects trying to get published and I rarely ever see anyone outside of when I was being trained. The principal investigator (PI) of the lab is an MD PhD who sees patients regularly, so he is never in the lab or available to answer questions. 


I thought that being alone in the lab most of the time was odd, but I ended up enjoying having the place to myself especially during long incubation periods when I was running ELISAs (which are a type of protein quantification). 


One thing that I've come to find out isn't actually normal is the secrecy around what I'm actually doing in the lab. I had been trained to perform ELISAs and analyze the data from the experiments, but I didn't actually know which proteins I was quantifying or which species we were getting the samples from. The grad student I was training from told me it was a rodent model and, as a young student new to a lab, I didn't know to ask which rodent. 


Regardless, every week, I would get a large number of tubes with serum in them for me to analyze. It was boring work, but this was the only lab on campus I could find that agreed to pay me and I really couldn't afford to go to school without working a job alongside, so I just do what I'm asked. 


After my first year, I found my days were packed with things I had to do, so I started just going into the lab during the nights. The usual bustle of the research building was much quieter, but other than that the lab was about the same. 


That was until one night, during an hour-long incubation period on my ELISA, I heard a commotion down the hall towards the vivarium where the animal subjects were kept. I stuck my head out to see what was happening and I saw the grad student who had trained me when I first started at the lab running out of the vivarium and locking the doors behind him quickly, then threw his headphones to the floor.


From behind the door someone was shouting. I couldn't make out what they were saying, but they sounded panicked. I didn't recognize the voice.


The grad student didn't look at me. I don't think he saw me. He started heaving like he was going to throw up. He grabbed onto the wall for support before crumpling to the floor and then started sobbing. “I'm sorry!” He wailed between sobs. “I can't do anything now!” He covered his ears to block out the screaming from the vivarium which was more muffled now than it was before. He ran off with his ears still covered and still sobbing loudly. The screaming stopped.


I didn't know what to do. I was frozen. I mean what the fuck was that? Shaking off the initial shock, I decided to go to the door to see if anyone needed help. 


“Hey! Is anyone there?” I called through the door.


No answer. 


I knocked on the door. “Are you okay?”


No answer.


I tried the door but the grad student had locked it.


I struggle with my decision to forget this incident and just go back to my work. I should've called 911. I should have reported what I saw. I should have said something. Done something. Am I really the type of person to see something and do nothing? Maybe if they had responded I would have done something, but they didn't and I didn't. Maybe they were dead or knocked out. I don't know. Whatever happened to them happened in part because I just went back to work. 


The next day, I was a little calmer when I went back to the lab. I walked past the entrance of the lab and went straight down the hall to the vivarium. 


This time I heard whispering behind the door. It sounded like multiple voices, but I couldn't make it out. 


“Hello?” I called out. 


The voices stopped and silence came over the hallway. 


“Is anyone there?” I called through the door. 


No response.


I started to walk away, shaking my head. I thought maybe I'd been imagining the whispering, but just as I was about to enter the lab, I saw the door handle to the vivarium twist slowly as though someone on the other side was trying to open the door silently. Then the door was pushed until it hit the lock and the handle snapped back into place. 


Something about it felt so wrong. So very wrong. It sent shivers down my spine. I didn't bother going into the lab at that point and I just went home. 


Pacing in my living room, I got the idea to anonymously report the lab to IACUC, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The vivarium was meant to house animals, so maybe animals were in danger. Maybe they were trying to escape. 


So I called and I told the story.


“You're reporting animal abuse for your lab, but you don't have access to the animal enclosure, you've never seen the animals, and you don't even know which animals are being tested?” The IACUC representative asked condescendingly. 


“Yes, but you have to understand…” I started.


“I understand that it can be difficult for a lot of young people to get their head around animal testing, but if your lab is working with IACUC standards, then I can assure you that they're in good hands.” The representative cut me off.


“No, I don't have any problems with testing, I'm just telling you that this is weird and I'm scared for whatever is in the vivarium.”


“What's the name of your lab?”


I told her.


The representative sighed. “That lab doesn't conduct rodent testing. Do you even work there? I'm hanging up.”


I was stunned. What the fuck. I'm totally helpless here. So is whatever is in that vivarium. If I'm completely honest, I started crying. Full body sobs. No one would ever believe me or what I saw. There was nothing I could do about it. 


Yesterday, I went to the lab again. This time the door to the vivarium was wide open and I could hear muffled screaming coming from inside. It sounded like the grad student. 


I didn't know the grad student that well, but the idea of him being hurt made my stomach turn. I was terrified for him, so I ran inside to try to help.


The vivarium was empty.


All the shelves that were clearly meant to hold mouse cages were just empty slots.


I ran to the door at the end of the room and it led to yet another empty room, but this time the screaming was louder and clearly coming from a maintenance closet.


The door to the closet had a note taped to it.


DO NOT LET HIM OUT. TAKE THE NOTEBOOK AND THE KEY. LEAVE HIM HERE. LOCK THE VIVARIUM. SPEAK OF NOTHING. DON'T COME BACK.


Then, from behind the door to the maintenance closet, the grad student called out to me. “Is that you? I always knew you were smart. I know what they put on the door. Don't listen to it. Just let me out. I'm so scared. Please don't let me die here. I don't want to die in the dark. Please don't let me die.”


I opened the door, but when I saw the grad student, I knew it wasn't him anymore. His eyes were wild and his arms and legs were too long. His skin moved like there was something crawling underneath. He didn't talk anymore. He stared at me for just a second and then ran past me and out of the vivarium like a scared animal.


I knew I made a mistake as soon as I saw his face. Don't tell me how stupid I am. I know I'm stupid.


The grad student’s notebook was opened to the last page.


“I think they're planning something,” was the last thing he wrote.


There have been three murders on campus in the last 24 hours. More are to be expected. I am so sorry, but you need to hide. Don't go anywhere alone. Get a gun. Something. I don't know. I'm scared.


If you or your loved ones are in the Milwaukee area, I'm so sorry.
