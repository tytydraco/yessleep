I exorcise spirits for a living. Be confident, or the Whisperlings will steal your soul.

We do not live alone in this world. Around us, just beyond the sight of what we are willing to believe is an uncharted, secret layer. A realer, more colorful world is just beyond the reach of all of us, and yet we choose not to believe.

We are surrounded by spirits. We are encircled by demons. By the bones and ruins of long dead things we don’t believe in anymore.

Once upon a time the world was a more colorful place, back when we truly believed and could see it for what it was.

But now we tell ourselves the things beyond the veil do not exist. I suppose that is why it is called the veil, perhaps. Because we have chosen all but to forget the true world around us.

I am a wanderer.

I’ve been traveling the world for a time now, helping when I can and keeping an open mind, witnessing the very things we have chosen to forget. Most are kind, gentle, curious beasts. 

But some creatures of the world beyond the veil aren’t. Some are malicious, deadly, villainous. 

It’s my duty to exorcize the malevolent. It’s also my duty to do the same for the kind who know not what they do.

The trees whispered in the wind, and the fields rippled as if they were alive. There was nobody on the stretch of road for miles, though I had seen deer and hedgehogs greet me. 

Then there came a point in the journey where I began to see them. Small, bouncy little things that floated and frolicked in the wind. “Fascinating,” I mused, retrieving my notebook, taking a sketch. “Whisperlings.”

The docile, cotton-like blobs flew about me, landing for seconds at a time and taking right off. They puffed up in size and shrank, approaching me for minutes, then leaving.

I reached out into the veil then. I had heard stories about them, but never seen them out in the wild, moving. 

“...don’t forget to…” echoes. “...have a great day!” voices, in time. Yes, this was as I heard. 

Whisperlings, from what I gathered, were the plants of the other side. They fed on human thought, emotion, passively, traveling with the wind and gathering what they could. They did not think, nor knew where they would travel next.

I liked them. They reminded me of my wanderings, journeying from one place to the next, walking along until something caught my attention.

“Hello,” I whispered. Two white spheres drifted over to me.

“Hello,” they whispered, picking it up. 

I journeyed on, and oddly, the farther I followed the path, the more they were. Sure, Whisperlings traveled in large groups of the dozens- but as I town emerged in the distance I noted hundreds if not thousands drifting in the wind, approaching the town.

One would think these beings would be attracted to civilization. After all- there is more thought, more personality to feed on.

But the opposite is true. The disbelief we as a people have upon the other side instead caused them to avoid places of people. No, something was up here. Something fishy. I would want- need to investigate further.

So I wandered, dancing with the whispering dandelions, until I found myself in the center of town.

A woman approached me. “You don’t look familiar.” The place was small, and I assumed everybody knew one another. Especially here, in the country.

I tucked my notebook away. “That’s right,” I extended a hand, and she shook it, “I’m just a wanderer.”

“Do you need a place to stay?” she asked, making it her business to know. There was a certain glint in her eye, one that told me she had reason for me to stay. I nodded. “Well that’s just great! Stay at my little inn!”

Without asking me further she practically dragged me over to a little place with a cafe on the first floor, and three guest rooms on the second. “I don’t exactly have money, sorry.”

She frowned. “Oh.”

I laughed, and dug into my backpack. “I do have,” I found the thing I was looking for, “chocolate.” I offered it, but she didn’t take it. “No? I can work, and I’ll be back with pay, if you know anyone.”

“I can make a call.” She nodded and walked away to a telephone. “Uh-huh. Farmland. Crows.” She came back over. “There’ll be someone here. Daphne.“

Half an hour later a middle aged woman was at the door of the inn, and I introduced myself. She seemed nice, and even accepted the chocolate I offered.

Within the hour I was wandering the fields. It was a simple job; the field was large, and crows had recently been amassing, eating crops and harassing the farmhands. 

I would go out, repair the scarecrows, and, with a noisemaker- a little electronic box that made loud shaking sounds, scare away the crows.

This was when I noticed the horde of Whisperlings that had gathered above town. Thousands that increased in number, swirling in a spiral pattern, all seeming to center around the farm I was working on.

The light shone through them, illuminating an ordinary, happy day. But the longer I focused on the puffs of dandelion a sick feeling began to manifest in my core.

I reached out into the ether, wondering why they were here. I only got a garbled mess of shouts and screams that sounded angry. The noise seemed to resemble the soft yet direct speech of my temporary employer, Daphne.

They didn’t drift on the ground either, strangely. No, they were all caught up in the growing gray spiral in the sky, segments of Whisperlings rippling at a time.

“Hey!” I shouted, finishing off the last of the crows. “Get outta here!” For a second, a cloud of Whisperlings drew themselves to me, echoing back my words.

This was odd. They were not often drawn to shouts and anger. No, they reflected and devoured the small yet truly genuine moments of joy and peace. Now, though, I started to wonder if they also had taken a liking to genuine anger, and fear.

I marched back to the house in the sea of grain to report my job had been done. 

There was a man sitting on the porch, watching the skies with a glassy emptiness in his eyes. “Hey!” I shouted. “Where’s Daphne? Finished the job!”

The man continued to eerily stare at the sky, absent. He coughed aimlessly, and small yet distinct blobs were catapulted out into the skies. “That’s… new.” The man was pale, the energy being taken from him.

The whispering dandelions were clearly having some sort of effect, one I had never studied. No, they were only supposed to take a miniscule bit of energy, nothing one could really recognize.

But the blobs surrounded him, clinging to his clothes and swirling.

“There you are!” Daphne shouted, dress rustling in the wind. “Come inside- don’t mind him.”

I walked up the steps as she beckoned me forth. “Who is he?”

She grimaced, odd for the words she was about to say. “My husband,” she revealed. “He’s been like this for a while. The doctor’s don’t know why.” Inside, safe from the storm of wind, she handed me the funds I so desperately needed. “Lot of use, them doctors.”

I studied her for a while. The tufts of white were swirling her, moreso, and yet she seemed full of energy, ranting about the doctors and the strange sickness which had befallen her husband. “I could try to help,” I offered. “I’m good with herbs.”

She seemed surprised, jolting, and shook her head. “Now, now, you’re just a wanderer, Miss…” She extended a hand.

“Mills, Aster Mills,” I introduced, shaking her hand. 

Whisperlings seemed to burst from her clothes, gently drifting away. “It’s not your business to get into.” I reached into the ether then, hoping to find out why the couple seemed to attract the dandelion-kind.

No, it wasn’t working. The jumble of screams and noise the creatures were chanting overwhelmed me, and I fell in a daze. “You okay?” she asked, bringing me up to a sofa. “I’ll get you tea.”

I sipped her tea with worry. I shuddered in something like fear as I again tried to reach out into her mind. The creatures were too loud.

Her husband wandered into the room, ambling without a sense of direction. I reached into his and-

Nothing. There was cold, empty nothing. 

It filled me with a sense of distinct, powerful emptiness. I shuddered in fear, wondering if I stayed here I would be in danger. “Hi,” I murmured.

He didn’t respond. The Whisperlings followed him inside, roaming the halls, all over the house.

The puffy beings feeded on our emotions, sure, but even at the size they were gathering in- it would take a hundred thousand more to wipe out someone’s entire personality. I had heard cases, disputed of mass gatherings leaving entire towns blank, empty.

There was something up in town. I would need to investigate the matter further. But for now, I could do something about the horde- at least indoors.

I settled my backpack on the floor and found myself a little red stone. I placed it on the ground and uttered some words.

The Whisperlings fled. The stone had that distinct ability. I hid it inside the couch.

I told the woman, Daphne I wanted to leave then, and so she drove me back up the fields and farms, back to the little down they lived in. “Great place, this,” she mused. “Good food, good people, good values.”

“I think I’ll be staying awhile longer,” I told. “Have you got more odd jobs?”

She smiled. “I’ll pick you up tomorrow at nine if you want.”

I settled in bed, a book in front of me. A little bestiary of odd things beyond the veil my friend, Steven (may he rest in peace) had made for me. I flipped to the section about the Whisperlings.

“Odd,” I whispered, watching the dandelion-blobs float outside. I turned my attention back to the book. Yes, there had been two cases of Whisperling gatherings wiping out the personality and mind of an entire town, feeding upon them until they were nothing more than husks.

The thought terrified me. 

But the events documented took place over the course of a year, and with far more gathering in the skies. And our general disbelief in mysticism would hold defenses against being totally wiped out.

And, if the Whisperlings were gathering here- why had only one man seemingly been affected.

My phone dinged. It was a good of friend of mine, Matt. I called him. “Hey Matt, how’s it going?”

His voice seemed distant, too far away. Clearly wherever he was, the signal wasn’t one to be proud of. Or perhaps it was me. “I’m- near-” static, “Anthem City.” We were both journeying separately, but that was where we would reconvene, and tell our tales. “About a day away?”

“I’ll be there in a week,” I told. “There’s something I want to look into here.” He asked me what could be so important to delay our meeting. “There’s an odd Whisperling gathering here- they’re sucking the life out of a man.”

“Can’t you report it to the Company?” The Company hunted, destroyed, and collected the bizarre. They were not a force to be trifled with.

They were also after us. Me and Matt, for our own experiences with the divine. “Can’t have them on our trail- plus, I think I can dispel this.”

He sighed. “If you say so. Has Quentin contacted you?” I shook my head. We chatted a bit more of cursed artifacts, divine things, and beyond the veil.

I fell asleep soon, watching the Whisperlings glow a soft gray in the night. Hypnotic.

When I woke there was a dozen Whisperlings in my room, gently dancing about. “Hello there,” I whispered. They didn’t echo my words, oddly. They were supposed to echo my words. “Odd.”

I changed and found myself at the cafe downstairs. I ordered an omelet and paid for it.

The woman in charge came up to me. “How long do you plan on staying?”

“A day or two longer,” I informed, handing over the last bits of money I had left. This was when my eye caught the window- for outside, all over the town were Whisperlings, as if we had been caught in a blizzard. “My god.”

“What?” puzzled the woman, looking outside. She saw nothing. “What’d you see?”

“A cardinal, red,” I lied. “I like to watch birds.”

“Me too!” And then I had to listen to her drone on and on about birds. I had no vested interest in the topic, and when Daphne came to pick me up, I was more that happy.

The gray, furry globs drifted to the sides as we drove. They were falling from the skies today, drifting downwards slowly and swooping back up. I reached into the ether. The screams that sounded oddly like the woman seemed more pronounced, real.

I decided to ask about it. “Hey, Daphne, is anything going on at home?”

“Besides my husband’s illness?” she pondered. “No.”

The screams of the Whisperlings concerned me. “Are you sure? I have contacts if…”

She frowned at me, something like malice. “Nothing’s going on. I don’t need you getting in on my business.”

“Alright, alright,” I answered. “I’ll stick to my thing from now on- what do you need help with?”

We stopped, I followed her in, and she handed me a jug of weed killer. “There’s some weeds in the back garden- spray them.”

I nodded, took the jug and headed back to the garden. It was large, expansive, and old greenhouses and ruined statues awaited me. It seemed like the ruins of an ancient civilization, and had I not been given a job, I would have sketched it.

Drifting softly, the Whisperlings entered the house, streams of round gray entering the house. Clearly, the enchantment I had cast had done nothing to deter them.

I seized one and spoke to it. “Reveal to me your secrets, I say, in the name of the Painter.” It was strong, and didn’t seem to be affected by the spell. Or perhaps it was because Whisperling’s didn’t possess conscious thought, and thus could not ‘reveal’ its secrets.

Yes, it was the latter. I started to spray the weed killer on the plants she’d pointed out. 

It was about a half hour later when the Whisperlings started to pick up in speed. Instead of gentle streams they came in waves, hundreds at a time trying to fit themselves into the house. 

Something was clearly going on. I reached into the ether- they were feeding.

Stealthily, I crept back to the house, as quiet as the hidden folk. And then I began to hear voices there, reflected off the Whisperlings, a thousand fractal yells, one over the other. 

The door was open. I crept inside and listened to the couple in the kitchen.

“You good for nothing man,” Daphne hissed, something falling to the floor. “You were always like this!” I crept closer, and when I found a satisfactory closeness I reached into the ether, and projected my mind.

She was holding something up- a rolling pin in one hand and raising it above her husband, who, cowering in the corner, could only sob.

He didn’t speak. Whisperlings swarmed them, ever present, yet invisible. “You’ve always been like this.” She slammed the pin on the counter. “Can’t do anything right!” She slammed it again.

The Whisperlings began to feed- not entirely on the words she spoke- but of the man. “You’re not worth my time.” And she threw the pin on the floor, rolling away as she walked towards-

I backed into a corner, avoiding her. I was right. Something was happening. The Whisperlings weren’t feeding on the woman- but the man. 

Our mental guard protects us from being devoured by Whisperlings and other creatures alike. This man- I reached into the ether, had lost all sense of self, once I was slowly understanding not from the Whisperling storm- but from his wife.

With a clearer picture, I could reach deeper. Yes, this had happened numerous times- what had started a happy marriage devolved as the woman grew bored and greedy, wanting a life beyond the town.

And the man suffered for it, caring- yet only being able to provide what he could on the farm.

Spirits have reasons for feeding. For being attracted to certain people. For me, it was attraction to the weirder world.

For the man- he was easy prey. Someone with no confidence, no self worth.

I heard footsteps. “You’re back,” Daphne said, a sickly sweet in her voice. “Let me get your money.” She left.

There was one way to remove the Whisperling infestation. To remove the source of the problem to begin with- to rebuild the man’s self-worth. To do this I would need to cut Daphne out of the equation for good.

“Here’s your money, dear,” she spoke, handing me a wad of cash. “Now, hop along and I’ll drive you back.”

“Wait,” I paused, slinging my back over and digging in, “I would like to show you something.” I looked through my compartments- a magic stone here, enchanted salts there- ah- there it was.

A small pocket river, closed. It was gold on the outside, and strange symbols rimmed its sides. “What’s that?”

I touched the symbols and whispered to them. “Escobath’s Mirror,” I muttered, handing it to her. An artifact I had recovered from black market dealers so long ago. “Take a look.”

“That’s-” she opened and observed. And screamed. And screamed more. The mirror wasn’t cursed, nor did demons possess it; the artifact revealed the morals of those who witnessed, the weight of good and evil. “Is this-”

It also struck a deep want to change. I took the mirror back. “This is who you have become.”

“But I don’t want to become that- that thing.” It struck me as funny. The reflection showed you who you were. They didn’t have to believe it- and yet, all who saw- did.

I had never seen my own. Perhaps it was for the best. “It’s not too late to change,” I mused. “You aren’t happy here- leave.”

She drove me back to the inn and I waited. She, in her confusion, had given me more money than I should have been paid. I opted not to tell her, and to stay the week.

She left the following day. I heard from the inn owner. That was the same day the Whisperlings began to drift away, softly in the wind.

By the end of the week there were barely any left to stay, only the tamest of ones, feeding purely off of the tiniest reflections of who we were. I assumed this was a good thing; the man, with less in his way of life, had recovered.

Perhaps not fully. The images I had witnessed would take years to recover from. But even the tiniest ounce of identity, self, would be away to deter the Whisperlings.

“Will you be coming back?” the innkeeper inquired.

I smiled, and shrugged, handing her a tip and an enchanted stone for good luck. “Perhaps.”

“Where are you going?”

I pondered on that. Where were any of us truly headed? “Nowhere. I’m just a wanderer.” She looked at me funnily. “But I believe I have a friend to meet in Anthem City.”
