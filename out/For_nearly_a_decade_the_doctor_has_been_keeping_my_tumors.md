It was every parent’s worst nightmare.

But, like, only for a week.

When I inspected my tumor, the first of hundreds, I couldn’t quite comprehend what I was looking at, rotating my forearm around in the shower with a passing curiosity. I wasn’t scared; just perplexed. The growth had qualities I understood, qualities borrowed from things I was familiar with, but I hadn’t ever seen them combined and configured in such a peculiar way.

It was dome-shaped, like a mosquito bite, but much larger, the size of an Oreo rather than an M&M.

It was the color of a day-old bruise, a wild-berry sort of reddish-blue, but the tone was brighter, more visceral, a ferocious violet hue that looked disturbingly alive.

And perhaps most recognizably of all, there was something jutting out the top. A glistening white pebble, planted at the apex like a flag.

It was a tooth.

I stepped out and toweled myself off, drying the growth last, dabbing the underside of my wrist with exceptional care, concerned my new geography might pop if I pushed too hard. I molded my thumb and first finger into a delicate pincer and attempted to yank the tooth free, but the stubborn little thing refused to budge. 

Frustrated, I grinned into the mirror, hooking the corner of my mouth with a finger and pulling, revealing gums unevenly lined with a mixture of baby and adult teeth. For the life of me, I couldn’t identify the missing tooth. The one that had fallen from my mouth while I slept with such incredible velocity that it became thoroughly lodged in my flesh when it landed.

At nine years old, it was the only explanation that made any sense. 

That’s it, I figured: it fell from my mouth, and now it's stuck. The tooth was Excalibur; my body was the stone. The notion that it may have *grown* from the surrounding skin didn’t even cross my mind. It was too outlandish. I was losing my baby teeth, and there was a tooth embedded in my arm. Simplicity dictated it came from my mouth.

I showed it to my mom over breakfast that morning. Her expression was, unfortunately, anything but simple. 

A weak smile with shaky lips and glassy eyes, pupils dilating, spreading like an oil spill. Same expression she wore the morning after Grandma died, the second before she told me.

*Guess it might not be that simple,* I thought.

The following few days felt like falling without ever hitting the ground; an anxious tumble from one place to the next. 

My parents ushered me around with a terrible urgency, but they refused to explain their concerns outright. It was all so rapid and overwhelming. So, to avoid my own simmering panic, I dissociated, my psyche barricaded behind a protective dormancy. As a result, my memories of that time are a bit fragmented.

I remember the mint green walls of my pediatrician’s office, how close the color was to toothpaste, which made me wonder if I should brush the tooth sprouting from my wrist. 

*Would it be better to do it before or after my regular teeth? Because it was outside my mouth, did I need to brush it more than twice a day, or less?* \- I wondered, but never had the nerve to ask.

I remember the way my mom would whisper the word *“oncologist”* whenever she said it, the same way she’d whisper about possibly taking our doberman for a walk, the same way Emma Watson would whisper the name *Voldemort* in the movies. 

Like something bad would happen if the *oncologist* heard her talking about them.

And I sure as shit remember the visible relief that washed over her when the *oncologist* called with the biopsy results. She practically collapsed onto the kitchen floor, a mannequin whose strings were being systematically cut, top to bottom. 

In comparison, Dad stayed rigid, his sun-bleached arms crossed, his wrinkled brow furrowed, even after Mom put a hand up to the receiver, swung her head over, and relayed that magic word.

*“Benign.”*

I’d never heard the word before, but I liked it. 

I liked how it sounded, rolling it around in my head like a butterscotch candy, savoring new bits of flavor with every repetition. Even more than its saccharine linguistics, though, I liked the effect it had on my mom. 

In the wake of my growth, she’d looked so uncomfortable. Twisted into knots, every muscle tightly tangled within some length of invisible barbed wire. That word, *benign*, was an incantation. Better than *Abra Cadabra*. One utterance and she was cured, completely untangled, freed from her painful restraints.

My dad had his own incantation, though. 

A two-word phrase that seemed to reinject the discomfort into Mom, drip by poisonous drip. I could almost see the barbed wire slithering across the floor, sharp metal clinking against tile, coiling up her frame before I could figure out how to stop it.

*“Second Opinion,”* he chanted. I don’t remember him *actually* chanting, to be clear, but he was so goddamned insistent, he might as well have.

*“I don’t care what that quack says. This is our son we’re talking about. He said there’s a ninety-seven percent chance it won’t come back after it’s removed - how the hell can you be ‘ninety-seven percent sure’ of anything? It’s either going to come back, or it won’t - there’s only zero percents, and hundred percents. We need a second opinion.”*

I cowered, slinking into the kitchen chair, compressing myself to the smallest size I could manage, minimizing the space I took up in our overstuffed mobile home.

*“We can barely afford the medical expenses as is,”* my mom declared. *“Please, just spit it out, John - what exactly did you have in mind?”*

Dad smirked.

*“Glad you asked.”*

\- - - - - 

*“Oh - it’s definitely going to come back after it’s excised, one-hundred-percent. No doubt in my mind.”* Hawthorn remarked.

I struggled to keep my wrist held out as the sweaty man in the three-piece suit and bolo tie examined it. As soon as he pushed back, the rolling stool’s wheels screeching under his weight, I retracted the extremity like a switchblade. 

Everything about Dad’s *“second opinion”* felt off.

The doctor - Hawthorn - wanted to be addressed by his first name.

The office was just a room inside Hawthorn’s mansion. 

No posters of the human body in cross section, no itchy gowns or oversized exam tables, nothing familiar. I was sitting in a rickety wooden chair wearing my street clothes, surrounded by walls covered in a veritable cornucopia of witchy knickknacks: butterflies pinned inside blocks of clear amber, brightly colored plants hanging in oddly shaped pots, shimmering crystals and runic symbols painted over tarot cards stapled to the plaster, and on and on.

Worst of all, Hawthorn insisted on wearing those dusty, sterile medical gloves. Initially, I was relieved to see them, because it was something I recognized from other doctors. A touch of familiarity and a little physical separation between me and this strange man. 

But why the hell would he even *bother* to wear gloves with those long, sharp, jaundiced, ringworm-infested fingernails? By the time he was done with his poking and prodding, most of them had punctured through the material. 

The feeling of his nails scraping against my skin made me gag. 

*“The other physician your family saw wasn’t completely off the mark,”* he went on to say, peeling the eviscerated gloves off his sweat-caked hands before shoving them in his suit pocket.

*“Certainly a teratoma - a germ cell tumor that can grow into all sorts of things. Teeth. Hair. Fat. Bone. I’ll stop the list there. Don’t want any nightmares induced on my account.”*

Hawthorn winked at me. 

I genuinely believe he was trying to be personable, maybe playful, but the expression had the opposite effect. I squirmed in my seat, as if Hawthorn’s attention had left a physical layer of grease or ash coating my skin and I needed to shake the residue off. His eyes were just so…beady. Two tiny black dots that marred the otherwise homogeneous surface of his flat, pallid face, seemingly miles away from one another.

*“Doesn’t that mean it’s…malignant?”* My mom asked, adopting a familiar hushed tone for the last word.

He shook his head, blotting beads of sweat off his spacious forehead with a yolk-colored handkerchief.

*“No ma’am. I would say it’s ‘recurrent’, not ‘malignant’. Recurrent means just that - I expect it will recur. Malignant, on the other hand, means it would recur and ki-”* Hawthorn abruptly clamped his lips shut. He was speaking a little too candidly.

Still, I knew the word he meant to say. I wasn’t a baby.

*Kill*. 

*“Excuse the awkward transparency, folks. I haven’t treated a child in some time. Used to, sure, but pediatrics has been a little too painful since…well, that’s neither here nor there. Allow me to skip ahead to the bottom line: despite what the other doc said, the teratoma will reemerge after a time, and it should be removed. Not because it’s malignant, but more because I imagine letting it grow too large would be…distressing. For your boy's sake, I'm glad your husband got my card and gave me a call. I've been informed that money is tight. Don’t fixate too much on financing. I didn’t get into medicine to bankrupt anyone. We’ll do an income-based payment plan. Save any questions you have for my lovely assistant, Daphne. God knows I couldn’t answer them.”*

We followed Hawthorn through his vacant mansion and out to the rear patio. There was an older woman facing away from us at a small, circular, cast-iron table, absentmindedly stirring a cup of black tea with a miniature spoon. In its prime, I imagine their backyard was truly a sight to behold. Its current state, however, was one of utter disrepair. 

Flower beds that had been reduced to fetid piles of dead stems and fungus. A cherubic sculpture missing an arm, faceless from erosion, above a waterless fountain, its basin dappled with an array of pennies, a cryptic constellation composed of long-abandoned wishes. A small bicycle being slowly subsumed by overgrowth. A dilapidated treehouse in the distance. 

The doctor waved us forward. Mom and I sat opposite the woman. At first, she seemed angry that we had climbed into the two empty seats without asking, face contorted into a scowl. Something changed when she saw me, however.

Her anger melted away into another emotion. It was like joy, but hungrier. 

She wore a smile that revealed a mouthful of lipstick-stained teeth. As if to juxtapose her husband, the woman’s eyes appeared too big for her face: craterous sockets filled with balls of dry white jelly that left little space for anything else.

And those eyes never left me. Not for a moment. 

Not even when she was specifically addressing my mom.

*“Daphne - could you explain the payment plan to these kind folks?”* Hawthorn remarked as he turned to walk back inside, snapping the screen door shut. Through the transparent glass, his eyes lingered on me as well, but his expression was different than his wife's - wistful but muted.

In a choice that would only feel logical to a kid, I pretended to sleep. Closed my eyes, curled up, and became still. Released a few over-enunciated snores to really sell it, too. Hoped that'd make them finally stop watching me. 

Eventually, I felt my mom pick me up and carry me to the car. 

\*“\****That*** *was your second opinion?”* she hissed at Dad as we arrived home.

Feeling the electricity of an argument brewing in the air, I jogged to the back of our mobile home, entered my room, and shut the door. I crawled under the covers and began flicking at the aberrant tooth. 

I hated it. I hated it, and I wanted it to leave me alone.

Later that week, we returned to the first doctor, the normal one, the *oncologist*. Under sedation’s dreamy embrace, my tumor was removed.

Three weeks later, I woke up to discover another, equally sized lump had taken its place.

In the end, Hawthorn was right.

That one didn’t have a tooth. Overall, it was smoother. More circumscribed. There were some short hairs at the outer edge, though: fine, wispy, and chestnut colored.

If I had to guess, I’d say they were eyelashes.

But I really tried not to think about it.

\- - - - - 

All things considered, the last ten years have been relatively uneventful. 

I quickly adapted to the new normal. After a year, my recurrent teratoma barely even phased me anymore. The human brain truly is a bizarre machine.

Sometimes it would take a few weeks. Other times, it would only take a few days. Inevitably, though, the growth would be back.

My mom would call Daphne’s cell and schedule an appointment for it to be excised. She’d always answer on the first ring. I imagined her sitting on the patio, swirling her tepid tea as she stared into the ruins of that backyard, phone in her other hand, gripped so tightly that her knuckles were turning white, just waiting for us to call.

Despite being cut into over and over again, my wrist never developed a scar. 

Hawthorn attributed the miraculous healing to the powder he used to anesthetize the area before putting scalpel to skin, a bright orange dust that smelled like coriander, distinctly floral with a hint of citrus.

I didn’t like to watch, so I’d look up and survey the aforementioned knickknacks that covered the walls, keeping my eyes busy. Say what you want about Hawthorn, but the man was efficient. In five minutes, the tumor would be gone, the wound cleaned and bandaged, and I wouldn't have felt a thing. 

Afterwards, he’d delicately drop the orphaned growth into a specimen jar, hand it off to a waiting Daphne, and she’d whisk it away.

I always wanted to ask how they disposed of them.

Never did.

After each operation, he’d deliver a warning. Same one every time.

*“If it ever changes color - from purple to black - you need to come in. Don’t call ahead. Just get in your car and come over, day or night. No pit stops, no hesitation.”*

Fair enough.

My teenage years flew by. Shortly after my diagnosis, Dad got a promotion. We moved from the trailer park to a much more comfortable single-story house across town. Before long, he received another promotion. And a third, and a fourth. Our financial worries disappeared. Other than the recurrent tumor, my only other health concern was some mild, blurry vision.

Started my freshman year of high school. I’d have to strain my eyes at the board if I sat in the last row. It wasn’t that my vision was out of focus, per se. Rather, the world looked foggy because of a faint image layered over my vision. Multiple eye exams didn’t get to the bottom of the issue. Everything appeared to be in working order. The ophthalmologist suggested it might be due to *“floaters”,* visual specks that can develop as you age because of loose clumps of collagen, which seemed to describe what I was experiencing: lines and cracks and cobwebs superimposed over what was in front of me, unchanging and motionless.

Once again, I adapted. 

Sat at the front of the class, as opposed to the back. 

No big deal. 

I’m nineteen now, attending a nearby community college and living at home. I wanted to apply to Columbia, but Dad insisted otherwise.

*“It’s too far from Hawthorn*.”

I wasn’t thrilled. Didn’t exactly see myself getting laid on my childhood mattress. That said, he was fronting the cost of my bachelor’s degree in full: no loans required, no expectation of being paid back. I hardly had room to bellyache.

Honestly, things have been going well. Remarkably, transcendently well.

Quiet wellness is a goddamned curse, however. A harbinger portending changes to come. Lulls you into a false of security, only to rip the rug out from under your feet with sadistic glee.

Yesterday, around midnight, I woke up to use the bathroom.

I flicked on the light. Unsurprisingly, there was a tumor on the underside of my wrist. I was overdue.

No tooth. No eyelashes.

But it was black. 

Black as death. Black as Mom's pupils the first time she saw it. 

I panicked. Didn’t even bother to wake up my parents. I had my driver’s license, after all.

I bolted out the door, jumped in the car, and sped over to Hawthorn’s mansion, following his instructions to a tee.

Within seconds of the front door opening, I knew I’d made a mistake.

Hawthorn wrapped a meaty paw around my shoulder and pulled me inside. Even in the low light of the foyer, I could tell there was panic in his features, too.

Then, he said the words that have been relentlessly spinning around my skull since. Another incantation. I felt the imperceptible barbed wire curling up my legs as he led me up the stairs; the air getting colder, and colder, and colder, cold enough that I could see the heat of his breath as he spoke once we'd reached the top. 

*“I’ve been meaning to show you my son’s old room.”*

I flailed and thrashed, tried to squeeze out of his grasp, but I simply didn’t have the strength.

Out of the darkness, two familiar craters of white jelly materialized.

Daphne unclenched her palm in front of my face and blew. Particles of sweet-smelling dust found their way into my lungs.

The abyss closed in.

My vision dimmed to match the black of my tumor, and I was gone.

\- - - - - 

Murmurs pressed through the heavy sedation. At first, their words were incomprehensible; their syllables water-logged, degrading and congealing together until all meaning was lost. 

Mid-sentence, the speech sharpened.

*“…not my intent, Hawthorn. You’re a kind, patient spirit. You wanted the boy to be safe. You wanted to minimize discomfort. It was moral; noble, even.”*

Other sounds became appreciable. The clinking of glass. Urgent footfalls against hollow wood flooring. The soft snaps of some sort of keyboard in use.

*“I’d thank you not to condescend, Daphne.”*

Darkness retreated. My vision focused. An icy draft swept up my body.

Excluding my boxers, I was naked.

*“I’m not condescending. I’m just pointing out that we knew this was a risk ahead of time, and you still put this boy’s wellbeing above David’s. If we pulled the meat slow, there was a chance it would sour. We knew that. Now look where we are.”*

I was in a bedroom, tied to a chair with what looked like makeshift restraints; ethernet cables drawn chaotically around my torso, rough twine around my ankles and wrists.

A single hazy lightbulb illuminated my surroundings. My eyes swam over peeling posters of old bands, little league trophies, and framed photos. Daphne and Hawthorn were in some of the photos, along with a young boy that I didn’t recognize. 

He looked eerily like myself, just aged back a decade. 

Not identical, but the resemblance was uncanny.

At a nearby desk, my captors were hard at work. Daphne was busy grinding seeds with a mortar and pestle. Hawthorne was scribbling on a notepad, muttering to himself, intermittently tapping his dirt-caked nails against the keys of a calculator. 

There was an empty beaker at the center of the desk, flanked on all sides by an apothecarial assortment of ingredients: petals in slim vials, pickled meats, jars of living insects, steaming liquids in teacups. 

Across the room, there was a bed, bulging with a silhouette concealed under a navy blue comforter. The body wasn’t moving. Not in a way that was recognizably human, at least. The surface bubbled with something akin to carbonation. Freezer-like machines quietly growled below the bed frame. 

As a scream began to take form in my throat, my gaze landed on the ceiling. Specifically, the portion directly above the bed. 

To my horror, I knew the pattern. I’d been seeing it for years.

Lines and cracks and cobwebs.

I discharged an unearthly howl.

They barely seemed to register the noise.

*“Daphne* \- *do you mind going to the garden? We need to mix more powder for him -”*

She reached up and slapped the back of his head.

***"There's. No. Time."*** she bellowed. 

He paused for a moment, then returned to his notepad.

I wailed. 

God, I wailed.

But I knew as well as they did that there was no one within earshot of the mansion to hear me.

When it felt like my vocal cords were beginning to tear, I calmed.

Maybe a minute later, Hawthorn threw his pencil down like an A-student done with their pop quiz.

*“Six and a half. Six and a half should provide enough expansion to harvest the remaining twenty grams we need for David’s renewal before it sours completely. Probably won’t be lethal, either,”* he proclaimed.

Without saying a word, Daphne filled the empty beaker with saline. Hawthorn twisted the lid off a jar of what looked like translucent, crimson-colored marbles with tiny silver crosses fixed at their core. He picked up a nearby handheld tuning rod and flicked it. Two notes resonated from the vibrating metal. The sound was painfully dissonant. He stroked one marble against the tuning rod. Eventually, the metal stilled, and the marble vibrated in its stead. When he dropped it in the saline, it twirled against the perimeter of the glass autonomously.

Six and a half marbles later, their profane alchemy was, evidently, ready for use.

For whatever it’s worth, a high-pitched shriek erupted from the seventh marble when they severed it with a butcher’s knife.

I wish I had just closed my eyes.

Daphne pulled the navy blue comfortable off the silhouette as Hawthorne approached me, beaker in hand.

There was a giant wooden mold underneath the blanket. Something you’d use if you were trying to make a human-sized, human-shaped cookie.

It was almost full. 

Just needed a little more at the very top.

A cauldron of teeth, and bone, and fat, and hair, chilled and fresh because of the freezer-like appliances below the bed frame.

And it’d all come from me.

Hawthorn set the beaker on the floor beside me, put a fingernail under my chin, and manually pivoted my neck so I would meet his beady gaze.

*“Please know that I’m sorry,”* he whispered.

The doctor nudged the glass directly under me.

Before long, I bloomed.

Tumors began cropping up all over my body. My belly, the back of my neck, the top of my foot, between my shoulder blades, and so on. My skin stretched until it split. I tasted copper. Daphne pruned me with a pair of garden shears. Hawthorn just used a scalpel. My sundered flesh plopped against the inside of a nearby bucket.

When they’d collected their fill, Hawthorn pulled the beaker out from under me. My body cooled.

Daphne poured the contents of the bucket into the mold.

David was complete.

They even had a little of me left over, I think.

Everything began to spin.

I heard Daphne ask:

*“Do you think David will understand? Do you think he’ll like his new body?”*

From somewhere in the room, Hawthorn had procured a chunk of dark red meat, glistening with frost.

A heart, maybe.

He pushed it into the mold.

*“Of course he will,”* Hawthorn replied, lighting a match.

*“He’s our son.”*

The doctor tossed the match into my archived flesh.

The mold instantly erupted with a silver flame.

A guttural, inhuman moan emanated from the mercurial conflagration.

A figure rose from the fire.

Thankfully, before I could truly understand what I was looking at,

I once again succumbed to a merciful darkness.

\- - - - - 

I woke up in the same spot sometime later, untied, wounds hastily sutured. 

There was an IV in my arm. Above me, the last drops of a blood transfusion moved through the tubing. One of three, it would seem, judging by the two other empty bags hanging from the steel IV pole. I found my clothes folded neatly beneath the chair, my cellphone lying on top, fully charged.

As if tased, I sprang from the chair, crying, pacing, scratching myself, mumbling wordlessly. 

Aftershocks from the night before, no doubt.

When I’d settled enough to think, I threw on my clothes, flipped open my phone, and almost made a call.

I was *one* tap away from calling my dad when something began clicking in my head.

A realization too grotesque to be true. 

I studied the bedroom. The alchemical supplies were gone. The posters, the trophies, the photos - they were gone too. 

For some reason, maybe in their haste, they’d left the wooden mold. It was empty, save for a light dusting of silver ash.

I sped home, hoping, wishing, praying to God that I wouldn’t find something when I searched.

Both my parents were at work when I arrived.

I sprinted through our foyer, up the stairs, down the hall, and entered my bedroom.

I knocked against my bedframe.

It was hollow, sure, but that didn’t prove anything.

I ran my fingertips across the oak

Nothing. Smooth. Featureless.

*There's no way* \- I told myself - *There's just no way. Dad worked hard and got promoted, that's it.* 

My bed was pressed against the wall. I still had to examine the last side.

The frame screeched as I pulled, as if beseeching me not to check. 

I felt one of the sutures over my stomach pop from the exertion, but it didn’t slow my pace, and, if anything, the pain was welcome.

Halfway across the normally concealed side, I noticed a slit in the wood.

I pushed on it, and a hidden compartment clicked open.

When I pointed my phone light into the hole, there it was.

A small glass of saline with a single red marble in it, right under where I laid my head to rest,

spinning,

spinning,

spinning.

And if I squinted,

if I really focused, 

I could see an image superimposed on top of what I was actually seeing,

but it wasn't static anymore.

No more lines, no more cracks, no more cobwebs.

The image was constantly changing. 

A window to David's eyes, 

one I don't think I'll ever be able [to close. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)
