Dear Diary,

Last night, the darkness in my room seemed to pulse with a life of its own. Shadows slithered across the walls, twisting and contorting into grotesque shapes. I could feel their presence like a cold breath on my skin, sending prickles of fear down my spine. The air was thick with an unnatural chill, and each movement of the shadows seemed to whisper secrets I couldn't comprehend.

I tried to convince myself it was just my imagination, but the way they moved... it was deliberate, almost mocking. I turned on all the lights, but the shadows lingered at the 

edges of my vision, waiting for me to let my guard down. Oh well, I did just watch Paranormal Activity a few hours ago. Maybe it will wear off.

Dear Diary,

The shadows have become more aggressive. During the day, they hover at the edge of my vision, darting away whenever I try to focus on them. At night, they grow bolder, creeping closer until they engulf entire corners of the room. I can hear them now, faint whispers that echo through the darkness, their words unintelligible yet filled with a sinister intent.

I sleep less and less these days, afraid of what I might see when I close my eyes. The shadows seem to feed off my fear, growing stronger with each passing night. I feel like a prisoner in my own home, trapped in a nightmare that has no end. I don’t know what’s happening or why, but I’m scared. The only thing I have left is you. I want to go back to feeling alone.

Diary,

Last night was the worst yet. I woke up to the sound of my own ragged breathing, only to find a dark figure standing by the window. It had no face, just a shadowy silhouette against the moonlit curtains. I tried to scream, but my voice caught in my throat. I felt its eyes on me, though it had none, staring into the depths of my soul with a malevolent curiosity.

I hid under the covers, praying for morning to come quickly. When I finally dared to peek out, it was gone. But its presence lingered, a haunting reminder of the horrors that lurk in the darkness. I don’t know what to do. Times like this make me wish I was religious. Whatever that is, it does not belong here. Not in this world.

Help me.

Sometimes, I swear I can feel their cold touch on my skin, like icy fingers trailing down my back. The air around them feels heavy, oppressive, suffocating me with its unnatural presence. It reminds me of Muula, a Caribbean spirit. Long hair, slim figure, extended limbs. Lurking in the shadows when the lights are off. Appears when you think of it most. 



Looking around you to make sure you’re alone doesn’t help, because you’re not. 

She’s there. Watching you. 

That unfamiliar presence when you peak in the mirror.



I've started keeping the lights on at all times, desperate to keep the shadows at bay. But even in the harsh glare of artificial light, I can still sense their presence lurking just beyond my field of vision. They watch and wait, biding their time until I'm vulnerable.

I can’t take this anymore.

It visited me again last night. I woke up to find it standing at the foot of my bed, a looming shadow that seemed to swallow the moonlight. Its presence filled the room with an oppressive weight, squeezing the air from my lungs. I could feel its gaze on me, penetrating and cold, as if it were searching for something deep within me.

I wanted to run, to scream for help, but fear held me paralyzed. I lay there, trembling, unable to tear my eyes away from its formless shape. And then, as suddenly as it had appeared, it vanished into thin air, leaving me gasping for breath in its wake.

\~\~\~\~\~\~

March 25th

It’s coming for me.

I can't escape it. The shadows follow me everywhere now, lurking in every corner, every reflective surface. I see them in mirrors, in windows, even in the polished surface of my phone screen. They twist and morph into grotesque shapes, mocking me with their silent presence.

I've become a prisoner in my own home, afraid to leave the safety of my well-lit rooms. But even here, I am not safe. The shadows press closer, their whispers growing louder and more insistent. They speak of things I cannot comprehend, of ancient fears and forgotten terrors. If whomever spirit is reading this, what do you want from me? Leave me alone.

Diaiarry

Tonight, it touched me. I felt its icy fingers brush against my cheek as I passed through the hallway. I spun around, heart racing, but there was nothing there. Just the oppressive darkness, thick and suffocating, closing in around me like a shroud.

I don't know how much longer I can endure this torment. The shadows have consumed me, body and soul. Their whispers have become my constant companion, a symphony of dread that plays endlessly in the recesses of my mind. LEAVE ME ALONE

\~\~\~\~\~\~



RUN					LEAVE ME ALONE

Human,

The phrase noted at the start has transferred the Entity onto you. 

In a selfish act, I have lied. 

This story is cursed.

Tormented for years, 

I am finally free. Unlike you.
