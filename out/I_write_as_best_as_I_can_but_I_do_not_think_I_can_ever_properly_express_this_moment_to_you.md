The haggard engine relentlessly pinged to the ridges and fissures of the neglected back road. As the frame of my downtrodden hatchback grumbled with the grit of the byway, it trembled as it slogged through the potholes of mud and slush. The rain jetted down on the roof above my head in a pitter-patter while the thick fog of midnight and the pools of rainwater bombarded my windshield. The pings of the engine escalated, thundering rhythmically with the murky torrent of the storm. The wheels of my hatchback whirled with the squeal of barnyard pigs as my progression down the untraveled road suddenly came to a halt. With exasperation, I stomped my foot into the accelerator, determined not to break off the path and get whirled into the typhoon surrounding me.  I was flung on into the cold, rubber grip of my steering wheel when I released the acceleration to stop the irksome row. The obnoxious blaring of its horn, and the twinges throbbing in my forearms registered the severity of the circumstances I had found myself in.
The pulsation of my forearms rose, blood flowing to the sides of my temple with each beat. Exhaling, I raised my arms and interlaced them behind my head, falling into the palms of my hands when I fell back into my ragged, faux leather seat. Sliding my fingers up my hair and the cool bars attaching my headrest to the seat, I put them on my lap. Taking deep breaths in and out, I thought to myself. I thought about those missing teenagers. It’d already been a weekend from when they were declared missing. If I had weathered the storm tonight, tomorrow morning they would have called off the search parties. Then the police statement would come at noon tomorrow, and after that, the investigation would be left as a cold case, just another tragedy. I needed to get this video to the station in time for the morning news.

With newfound conviction, I sat up in my seat, briskly grabbing the key, and forthwith turning it clockwise. Holding the brake down the luminescence of the display dimmed into the gloom of the night. The pinging of the spark plugs fade into the tranquility of the woodland, soon replaced by the trash of the glove box opening. Reaching inside, I grasped the grip of my flashlight through the falling junk, bringing it out and latched it onto my t-shirt. Finally, I reached over and extended my arm to the carry handle of my camcorder, and lugged its heftiness up upon my shoulder. Tugging on the door handle, I yanked it open with my off-hand, kicking it out. The downpour engulfed me; I clicked the button on my flashlight and faint, yellowed light beamed out into the nightfall. With the press of another button on my camera, and the glimmer of a red light in the corner of my vision, I pushed onwards.

Each droplet shot sharp pains across my body, piercing, even numbing my skin. My breath waived as I shivered violently. Mud speckling itself across my calve, my pants were drenched from the knee down in dew. I saw the vapor of my exhalations when I looked down to watch my step; my shirt now straggly. Rocks slide, uprooted from the earth by the pounding of the rain. Branches cracked like lighting above me in the trees, falling and flowing down the decline of the narrowing road. I was turned around, and found the pandemonium around me, feeling the sting of crashing waves on my skin. Those same waves that fill your lungs with saltwater and drag you down into their current. At the point of hyperventilation, I felt like I was going to throw up. Why had I ever thought this was a good idea?

In a panicked frenzy, I brazenly stomped through the uproar of the storm into the tree cover. I descended down the steep hills the road was elevated on. Debris crashing down next to me, the scree slope below me giving out from beneath my feet, the trip was inevitable. Trotting down the boulders, one of the rocks rolled out as I stepped, and my ankle twisted a way it should not have. Crying out, I rolled down the rocks, being battered and lanced by the formation. Glass shattered when I slammed into the coarse grounds of the glade.
Looking up from my ill-treated camera, its plastic frame cracked and loose, I saw a silhouette among the trees and thick vegetation of this clearing. It looked like a person, or so I thought at first. I came to the realization it wasn’t when it emerged from behind the trunk of the tree. Hunched over like an ape, it stiffly convulsed as it turned towards me. Hairless and gaunt, it looked towards me with blunt eyes, salivating down its thin lips as it bore its canine teeth. Jolting forward, it took a breath, its breath sounding like high-pitched whistling. Its mouth opened wide, it leaned forward.
I was in complete shock when I first saw it. Primal fear washed over me as I made a face of complete disgust, my eyes wide and my jaw dropped. Lying on the ground, I deftly got up, adrenaline rushing through me. Through my stupor, instinct took over, and I hurled the camera at it. With a screech, it flung up into a tree. Limping from my sprain, I screamed in agony; with determination. I threw rocks up into the foliage, hopping up the incline. Falling, I dug my fingers into the divots and strained through the strenuousness to get to the top. Side stepping, I sped-walk as fast as my body would allow me once I reached the road again.

Another rock in hand, I got to my hatchback. Its drab orange never seemed so comforting before. Smashing the branch it was caught on, I flung the rock into the distance with another roar. Slamming the door shut as I rolled into it, I put it in reverse, turning the key back up and the engine on. Through the howls I heard, and the leaves falling, I had to make sure it would not follow me, even in this storm. I squeezed the stick-shift and revved the engine. I heard it cackle as it dropped on the roof. Slamming down on the acceleration, it fell in front of the car, tumbling off of the roof. Changing into first-gear, I hit it head-on. The sheet metal of the hood bent backwards as my headlights were splattered on. Making a U-turn, I drove off down the road and back up onto the highway to find someone as soon as possible.

So I’m writing this back at the station the following morning. It’s not good but it’s a rough draft. Hopefully we can get this written onto a script and televised. Without the footage, it’ll be hard though….
