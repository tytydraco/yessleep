My name is Joshua, and I live in a quiet little town just north of Columbus, Ohio. At 19, I was diagnosed with paranoia, a reality that has shaped my life in ways I can't fully express. Right now, I'm sitting in my house, figuring out my next move. Lately, I’ve had this unsettling feeling that everyone around me is mirroring my every move, and it all seems to have started with my best friend, Mason.

The peculiar behavior began during our senior year of high school. Mason and I were inseparable, a bond everyone in our school recognized. One day, he showed up wearing the same shirt as mine. I joked, “Oh, would you look at that! Are you trying to be me?” My tone was obnoxious, but the moment my words left my mouth, I noticed a shift in him. His smile faded, and he stared blankly for a brief moment before snapping back to reality. “Oh! Uh, sorry. Zoned out a bit, didn’t I?” he chuckled, his laughter tinged with anxiety. In hindsight, I realize I should have probed further, but I brushed it off at the time.

The following year, I received my diagnosis. Initially, I didn’t dwell on it too much; I was diligent about taking my meds, convinced that was the key to managing my paranoia. But after a couple of refills, I made the fateful decision to stop taking them. That’s when the strange occurrences picked back up again. God I wish I had continued taking my meds.

I remember one particular day when I was walking to the gas station down the road from my apartment, desperately in need of milk. “Walk in, get out. Walk in, get out,” I repeated to myself like a mantra. I entered the store, barely acknowledging the cashier’s greeting. After grabbing what I needed, I hastily slapped cash on the counter and rushed out. But then it hit me—something felt off. I could have sworn the cashier was wearing different clothes when I walked in. Confused and horrified, I turned back. 

“Yes, sir?” he asked, his tone almost mocking as I poked my head back inside. To my horror, he was dressed in a long-sleeve flannel, identical to mine, paired with khakis that were also a perfect match. Panic surged through me, and I dropped my gallon of milk before sprinting down the street. In that moment, I realized that it wasn't just the cashier—everyone around me seemed to be clad in the same outfits. It felt like a surreal echo chamber of my own existence. Even more disconcerting, I noticed that everyone was running in the same direction as me. What the fuck was happening here? God I need my meds.

Now, as I sit here, curled up in my bathroom, I hear someone knocking on my door. I’ve made the decision not to answer. I’m documenting these thoughts, and if anything else occurs, I plan to give an update. If anyone has advice, I would truly appreciate it. I feel like I’m caught in a whirlwind of undefined reality, and I’m eager to make sense of it all.
