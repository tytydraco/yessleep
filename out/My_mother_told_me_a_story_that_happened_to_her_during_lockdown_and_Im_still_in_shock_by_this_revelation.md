For the most part of the lockdown, I was outside my country. This is an incident that happened to my parents during the lockdown phase. My mother narrated me this story when I returned home. I will narrate the story from my mother's perspective and will try to include all the details that she told me. My mother’s name is Janet. She is a 55-year-old working woman who lives with my father Mike (58) and my younger sister (21). We also have a dog, Pomp, who is important to this story as well. The story that she told me went as follows -

This happened to me during lockdown and it has shaken me from the inside. 

One fine morning, we all were sitting together and having our breakfast. Our dog, Pomp was roaming around and wagging her tail. Mike had returned from his trip last night and he looked exhausted from the long journey. He had dark circles around his eyes and he looked fatigued. He is generally a very jolly fellow, always happy and full of pranks. But that day he was unusually quitter. Whenever he came to the dinner table, Pomp used to run around excitedly tying to play with him. But that morning when he came to the table, she suddenly stopped wagging her tail and started barking at my husband. I was surprised as was Mike but he did not say anything. After sometime, he silently got up from the table and left. It felt weird. I wanted to ask him what happened but probably thought it was just the exhaustion. The entire day Mike did not talk to any of us. 

At night, we went to bed and fell asleep early. At around 3 A.M., Mike started to groan and made a kind of wheezing noise. Mike has asthma, so I thought it was his breathing trouble. I was getting up to get his inhaler, when suddenly he jumped up and started crying like a baby.  I asked him what had happened to him. At first, he was hesitant to tell, telling me that I will not believe him. But when I insisted, he finally told me.  

"Last night while at hotel, I saw a face, changing its expressions every second. At first, I thought it was just a shadow on the wall. I turned around to turn on the table lamp, but what I saw was not just a face. It was a monster. It started moving towards me and on reaching me, he grabbed me by the neck and started choking me. I could not breathe".

If I am going to be honest, I did not believe him at first. I wanted to. I knew that he did saw something nightmarish but the idea of a monster seemed too far-fetched. Anyways, thought startled, I calmed him down and put him to sleep. He insisted to keep the lights on which was something he had never done before. 

Next morning as I woke up, I could hear my dog barking outside. As Mike went downstairs with me to the table, I could still see Pomp continuously barking and growling at him which was strange given how she generally is. I had to practically pull her away from Mike. The rest of the day went normal except for consistent barking by Pomp, but the nights were the same. Mike would wake up frightened and crying. 

It had been 4 days since he returned. When nothing changed, I finally though of visiting a shaman on the 5th day. He told me that my husband was haunted by an evil presence and it was trying to kill him. I was shocked. I could not believe that all of this was real. I asked him for help. He gave me a talisman and asked me to wrap it around Mike's wrist. The shaman also told me that if not contained, the spirit will kill him by the next no moon night, which was only 3 days away.

I came home around 3 P.M. that day. Mike was home. He had taken a sick leave from the office. I quickly wrapped that talisman around his wrist and explained everything to him. He was relieved that I finally believed him. 

That night, Mike went to bed early. I was working in the kitchen when suddenly I heard a noise coming from our bedroom upstairs. I rushed up to see that him wailing in pain, holding his throat. He had an open gash on his neck and it was bleeding profusely. The entire bed had become red with blood. I quickly dressed his wound and when everything was under control, I asked him what had happened.

He said that when he was lying on the bed, something grabbed his throat. 

“I could not see who or what it was. I just felt a cold, stiff hand around my neck. It was the same feeling that I had that night in the hotel, except I could not see nothing this time. After sometime, the hand let go off me and it was then that I realised the blood flowing out of it. I tried to scream, tried calling for your help, but I was not able to. But fortunately, it went off and you were able to hear me."

I looked up at his wrist and saw that the talisman was missing. I asked him where he put it. He looked visibly surprised. 

"What do you mean? You did not remember? You came to my room and asked me to open it and sprinkle some water on it", Mike said.

I was terrified at this point. I could not tell him it was not me, but someone else who came to him taking my form and asked him to do so. I asked Mike to go and wear the talisman back as soon as possible. He listened to me. Soon we fell asleep and nothing happened after that.

On the day of the no moon, I was anxiously waiting for something to happen. I remained awake all night and made sure that the talisman stayed where it was supposed to stay. Thankfully, the nights went uneventful after that. It has been four months since then. He is doing fine. I did not tell you because I was worried you will get frightened. But I was more afraid of that spirit coming to you. But now that you are here, I think it is important that you know. For we may not believe in otherworldly creatures, but they do exist. Some stories are not just stories.

...

It has been almost two years since that incident. I still have not asked my father what it was. But I make sure that every night when I go to bed, I keep my night lights on.
