With my father’s old rusty drill protruding into my left temple, I clamped my teeth around the sleeve of my sweater and bit down hard.

I could drill a hole inside my head, just like Spencer said, and yank this bitch out.

But thinking about doing something, and actually doing it… are two very different things—especially when my mind was already partially polluted by the brainwashing video used to (un)successfully turn me into a so-called asset for the Delany’s.

If you’re confused about what I’m talking about, there are two videotapes that existed in my childhood.  

The first tape was embedded inside my suppressed childhood memories of elementary school, a how-to tutorial for my non-human classmates to hide themselves from the world.

While the other existed to create hunters.

This tape had created [Jasper](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15r6jav/i_could_never_understand_why_i_couldnt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2) and [Luna](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15ty709/i_could_never_understand_why_i_couldnt_take_part/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2) Delaney, as well as my fake-boyfriend, Spencer Delaney. The three Delaney siblings converted into mindless agents for the shadowy organization hell-bent on destroying my mother’s kind. I still wasn’t fully sure of what she was. 

All I did know was that I didn’t care what she was. I still loved her, and she was still my Mom. At this point, I had already been subjected to the tape, my brain molded by the static bleeding into me, twisting my thoughts into submission. After being kidnapped and partially brainwashed by my boyfriend’s psycho family, I managed to get away. 

But that is exactly what they wanted. 

This is exactly how I ended up barricaded in my mother’s bathroom with a drill to my head, my eyes squeezed shut, my head tipped back against smooth wood, and my knocked-out boyfriend lying limp, a tangle of limbs in the tub opposite me. 

I was still coming to terms with a lot of things; with one of those things being that I was the adopted daughter of the very entities my fake-boyfriend and his family were hunting down. The second thing was that under the control of the thing implanted inside my mind, I had shot my mother in the head with no hesitation. I didn’t even know I was armed. I didn’t know I could shoot a gun—no, I definitely could not shoot a gun with that good aim.

And yet, my hands had felt at home wrapped around the magnum, my finger comfortably pressed against the trigger.

That brought along a disturbing realization.

I had held one before.

I had stood like that before, with my feet apart and my shot confident. 

When I tried to reach for a memory, however, none existed. It had taken seconds for me to find the right trajectory—right between her eyes—and another to shoot. I had felt the recoil of the gun, and the shock of my mother stumbling backward, which had snapped me out of it enough to cry out to my brothers to help her and force my way up the stairs, dragging Spencer along with me, before I did the exact same thing to them. It was a blur of dragging myself to the upstairs bathroom, but in that time I had come to realize several things about my non-human family. They could regenerate their limbs. I  figured that out when Mom didn’t drop to the ground dead, only straightening and calmly pulling the lump of metal out of the crevice in her forehead, which was slowly knitting itself back together through swirling black. Cam appeared, a “What the fuck?!” expression on his face, only to quickly understand the situation through Mom’s eyes. I  had only seen my Mom’s true form when I was a kid, and yet seeing it now, I couldn’t help losing my breath. 

My mother was beautiful; she was inky darkness, a shadow with the distortion of a human face, and yet despite the dozens of eyes blinking at me with fear and questioning, I knew she could understand what was happening. I didn’t have to speak. I felt the gun slip from my clammy hands, losing all pretense of whatever that thing had turned me into.

Mom’s human form began to falter with the injury, but she didn’t question me, only giving a slight jolt of her head, motioning for me to run upstairs. She knew something had been done to me, and that I was a danger to her and my brothers. Thankfully, my younger brothers were able to pull her into the living room. When I was gathering Spencer into my arms, gunshots sounded from outside—pop, pop, pop. 

The screams that followed rattled in my mind, and Mom started quietly ordering Cam and PJ to draw all of the curtains and lock the doors. I had no doubt Spencer’s siblings were outside, slowly ripping through the neighborhood. 

Before I could stop them, I had to get the static out of my head.  I made it to the bathroom and dumped Spencer in the bathtub. I told Cam to bring our father’s old drill. And I had been sitting with my back against the door, and the drill pressed to my temple for almost an hour. I think desperation had gotten the better of me because I was slowly starting to come to the realization that I couldn’t just drill into my head. I had nobody to tell me how deep I was going, and my only instruments to pull this thing out were my bare hands. 

Before being put on standby, along with his siblings, Spencer told me I had to drill a hole in my head and physically pull the static woman’s control out of my skull. The problem was, however, I had no idea if this process would save me or cause me to bleed out. The drill was growing progressively warmer in my clammy hands, my finger too scared to press the button, when the woman’s voice seeped into my skull, echoing through static. In front of me, Spencer’s body jolted in the tub, his body thrusting into an arch before slamming back down onto cold porcelain. *What did I tell you? You cannot remove me. Do you really want to play around with your own life?*

I felt her presence bleeding into my limbs, tightening my fingers around the butt of the drill. *Can you really press it?* She inched my fingers across the button, and I screamed into my sleeve, trying and failing, and then trying again. I couldn’t do it.

“All right, how about we play a guessing game?” she sang. “If you get a question right, I will activate the third Delaney sibling.”

Spencer… 

But did she mean wake him up as a family member, or give him back his mind? 

"Fine."

I leaned closer like a curious child, trying to dip my fingers into the buzzing, blurring dots swimming in my vision. I could feel her puppeteering my body, moulding me back into my child self. “Okay, so here’s your first question!” The woman cleared her throat, and that upbeat music started to play once more. This time, however, I wasn’t looking at a brainwashing video. 

It was just me and her. 

“Do you remember what you did during your middle school and high school years? They're supposed to be some of your best memories, and you can't remember them!" she leaned closer to the screen, tapping her chin, and once again, the dot appeared. This time it didn’t move, but my gaze was already trained to find it and focus on it. She was right. I didn't remember much of high school, though I didn't know why. 

“Second question!" She laughed cheerily. "What happened to your father?” 

The question slammed into me like a wave of ice-cold water, and I found myself breathless, once again tracking the dot moving left and right, up and down. I could sense my own lips were trying to form words, trying to fight against the dot, which was slowly dragging me down once again, plunging me into the incomprehensible, tangled darkness, while the static wove its way through my mind, choking my thoughts. “Answer my question.”

This time, her voice was hard and cold, and that version of her was suddenly terrifyingly familiar.

“My father died.” I managed to whisper when my surroundings blurred once again. My answer felt wrong, despite knowing my father had died when I was sixteen years old. So, why was I questioning myself? Why did I continue to follow the dancing dot, tracking its frenzied movement, as it pulled me into another memory? It’s not like I could fight it. This thing was already wrapped around my brain, a vicious serpent suffocating my thoughts.  I expected elementary school, but this time I was older. While my younger years had felt confusing, more of a blur of what I didn’t understand, my teenage years hit me like a brick to the face. I was… 

Scared. 

I didn’t know what I was scared of, but this fear was something I had never felt before; it crept on me, snaking its way up my back and slithering through my gut, filling my mouth with squirming, writhing bugs every time I dared part my lips. 

But I knew I couldn’t speak. Because speaking out of turn meant punishment, and punishment meant…

“Recruit Hart!”

I felt my younger self automatically recoil at the man’s voice, my body trembling. I was used to this. Just like this fear taking over me, I was used to my body quivering, and not knowing what to do with my hands, how to thin my breath to avoid breathing too loud. 

This time, I was twelve years old. 

I didn’t think a lot about my early teen years, only that I went to a small school that didn’t have many kids. I had a decent number of friends and could vaguely remember really getting into Pokémon around this time, mostly because my brother was obsessed with the game. What I remembered was spelling bees and field trips to nature reserves, and my first encounter with a crush. Twelve years old was sitting in the diner with my friends, drinking milkshakes, and slumber parties. 

But what I was dragged back to, was none of that. The reality of being twelve years old was far darker. 

Instead, I was freezing cold, shivering, and too scared to move under the eagle eyes of the monster standing in front of me.  

“That’s right, Freida,” the woman’s voice hummed. “Your mother is truly a monster for deceiving you like this! First, she gets your elementary school teacher to hide away what you saw as a child, and now she’s wiping away your precious teen memories?”

No, I didn’t want to see this.

The dot, however, wasn’t giving me a choice. I was aware of myself still sitting with my back against the door of my mom’s bathroom, my gaze flitting back and forth, following four separate dots prancing across the field of my vision. 

The memory was blurry at first, an attempt to plunge it back into oblivion was quickly stopped by the force which had entwined itself around my brain. 

Twelve years old came to me in flashes of what looked smeared red, screams, and a familiar buzzing TV screen. I remembered being used to standing in the exact same position, my arms glued to my sides, my fists clenched tightly, and my shoulders straight. I knew that if I slumped them, it was game over for all of us. Opening my eyes, I was greeted to a classroom empty of desks and converted into a training hall. 

There were no windows, and the windows that we did have were boarded up. The only light was a slight flickering bulb above my head. I was barefoot, my toes sinking into crash mats lain out on the floor. The thin t-shirt I had been wearing was caked in sweat stains and grime, while my pants were torn in three different places and rolled up to my battered and bruised knees. This was what Mom had tried to protect me from, by implanting a fantasy of a normal twelve-year-old’s life. While this was mine. 

The air felt thick and stuffy, and it was hard to breathe, but I didn’t want to. I was too scared to breathe. Beside me were a dozen other twelve-year-olds standing in the exact same position. 

The monster in front of us was a six-foot-something man with broad shoulders and unblinking eyes. 

He marched over to the boy standing shoulder to shoulder with me. I couldn’t see the kid very well in the dim light, only dark brown curls falling over his eyes, and the slight dimple in his left cheek. With the way his expression was struggling to be nonchalant, twitching from an awkward smile to a frown, I wasn’t surprised he was a target. 

The one rule we had to follow was to show no emotion.  This kid was trembling,  shoulders shuddering against mine, his breaths growing heavier as the man grew closer and closer, before situating himself in front of him. “Recruit Hart,” he growled. “Answer me when I say your name.” 

He stuck the barrel of his gun into the boy’s forehead. Hart didn’t move, somehow managing to stay still, arms at his side, head straight.

“Yes, sir,” Hart spoke in a sniffle, and in the corner of my eye, tears were sliding down his cheeks and dripping from his chin.

The man towered over him, his eyes hungry for blood, lips drawn into a slimy smile. “What do you do if are in close vicinity to a ʍopɐɥs?” he spat every syllable into Hart’s face, purposely teasing the trigger. “Say it without crying, you little brat.”

“We… d-delete them.”

“I said, answer me without crying.”

“Delete them!” Hart spoke with more gusto, straightening up. “We…we neutralize them for the good of—” he hiccupped. “Humanity.”

The man continued to prod the gun into the flesh of the boy’s forehead. “How do we permanently destroy ʍopɐɥs?”

“I… I don’t know,” he whispered. “I can’t remember.”  

I expected Hart to be pulled out of line, but he was left alone—which was somehow worse. I preferred physical punishments because the alternative sent me into a cold sweat. “To permanently destroy a ʍopɐɥs, we sever the brainstem.” The man said through his teeth, stabbing the gun into the flesh of the boy’s forehead with every word. “Do. You. Understand. Me?”

“Yes, Agent Styx!”

The man stepped back, addressing all of us. “It appears,” he started to pace the line, and I knew exactly what his expression was. I could see it in the twitch of his lips, the crinkle in his forehead. “That the twelve of you cannot follow basic instructions.”

Oh, no.

“So…” the man’s thundering voice bounced off of the walls, reverberating in my skull. “Why don’t we rest for a bit?” His smile grew. “Sit down!” 

None of us did. 

Because we knew what came after this. 

The door opened, and several figures pushed in an ancient television, shoving it in front of us. The screen was already lit up, and next to me, Hart stumbled out of line, dropping to his knees. It always seemed to affect him the worst. 

He didn’t even have to look at it, and the boy was already at its mercy, slamming both hands over his ears, deep red trickling between his fingers. The appearance of the screen caused a domino effect. Our whole line went down, slumping onto our knees. The girl next to me tried to bury her head in her lap, but ghostly white light from the static was already illuminating every face. The voice told us to sit properly so we did. She told us not to cry, and we followed her commands. 

The music started. It was the worst part. I could feel it cracking open my skull, and seeping inside my mind, beginning its manic twisting of my thoughts. “Hey, kids!” When the woman appeared on the screen, Hart started screaming. I knew he was screaming because his mouth was set into an O. 

His eyes were wide, almost feral as rivulets of red dripped down his chin. 

But I couldn’t hear him. His cries were drowned out by the music, and that sickeningly sweet voice pulverizing my skull. “So, a birdie told me you’re not following instructions!” She mocked a pout, and I sat very still to avoid being punished. I did as I was told; just like the white text on the screen told me. 

I could only see the white text if I squinted and looked past the static. “HOME VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM” the words hurt my head. “PROJECT WHITE. PLEASE STAND BY. IF SUBJECTS RESIST, PLEASE USE FORCE. FOR SUBJECTS: PLEASE FOCUS ON THE RED DOT.”

I could see it, a blurry dot right in the middle of the woman’s smile.

So, I did.

If I didn’t, I would end up like Hart. I sat forward with my hands in my lap and stared at the screen until the woman’s voice encompassed my thoughts, her manic laugh bouncing around my skull. 

I didn’t move. If I did, she would make me regret it. “That’s too bad!” She said, “Why don’t we start from the beginning, okay? And remember! Don’t fall behind or face punishment!” This time, I felt her teasing that very word, prodding around my skull and pressing on bruises I didn’t know existed. 

“Say it with me!” 

And we did. 

Until we were passed crying, until our tongues were tangled, our voices choked in our throats. “How do we permanently destroy a ʍopɐɥs?” the words were cruelly dragged from our mouths in a robotic drawl. “We sever the brainstem.” Before we could catch our breaths, we were forced to say it again. Louder. This time, I could feel something warm trickling from my nose. “How do we PERMANENTLY destroy a ʍopɐɥs?” We screamed when the woman told us to be louder. 

“We sever the brainstem!” 

Her face twisted into shapes and dizzying colors in front of me, and somehow, I could feel my lips stretching into a smile. Chasing the dot on the screen turned into a game. Hart was inches away from me, his eyes on the buzzing static, a wide grin stretched across his bloody lips. “HOW DO WE PERMANENTLY DESTROY A MODAHS?” 

When she told us to stand up, we did, jumping to our feet and resuming our position, her smile projected on our faces. “WE. SEVER. THE BRAINSTEM.” 

Hart was asked again, this time by the woman, his lips were parted into a smile.

“We sever the brainstem!”

“Very good!”

The words were so easy coming from my mouth, each one dripping from my lips and tainting my tongue that tasted of rusty coins.

I’m not sure how I managed to release myself from the control of the buzzing in my brain, but somehow I tore my gaze away from the TV, reality bleeding back into fruition. There was something dripping on the ground in front of me, and I found myself transfixed by the color, lit up in dizzying light.  “Freida!” The voice sent shockwaves through me, jerking my head, and my attention towards the television. Her wide smile twisted into a scowl, and I saw my classmates mimicking it. “Pay attention! You don’t want to be left behind do you?”

“No,” I whispered.

She leaned closer. “What was that?”

“No!”

“Again!”

“No, I don’t want to be left behind!”

I was once again aware of the dancing dot blurring between my vision. *We’re not finished yet,* the woman’s present voice floated inside my head. In the past, she sounded a lot clearer to me—while now, she was more of a buzzing footprint, a swarm of white noise burrowing its way into the meat of my brain. *Why don’t we look at high school, hmm? I bet you’re curious!* 

Her voice was a manic sing-song, and I hated to admit that she was right. 

When I entered the memory, however, following the dot, I immediately regretted it. 

My sixteen-year-old self was barely recognizable; dressed in sticky shorts and t-shirt that stunk of sweat, my hair tied into a ponytail that was so tight it hurt my head.  I felt the sensations hit as soon as the suppressed memory enveloped me. I was numb. I was numb to all feelings, even fear. That was what I had been taught, what had been drilled into me. But, like a switch being pulled, suddenly I was scared, which made me a target. I did have fear, and that fear was eating me alive. In this class, fear meant detention, and detention was almost a death sentence. 

That didn’t stop me from shivering, trembling so hard, I was audibly rattling my desk. There were thirteen kids in my sophomore class, but each of them was drowned in shadow around me. I was standing behind my desk, my sticky hands wrapped around a gun. It didn’t feel right in my palms, clumsy and wrong, my finger struggling on the trigger. Swallowing hard, I followed the instructions written out on the board.

Feet apart.

I forced my feet apart, copying the boy in front of me.

Take aim.

I pointed to the target on the wall, mentally willing myself to stop shaking. The others were perfecting their training, the shadows spread out around me, twelve silhouettes with no identities, standing with their feet apart, their heads straight, fingers wrapped around their handhelds. The click-clack of our trainer’s heels twisted my gut as she weaved in and out of each row. 

Click-clack.

Click-clack.

“Castor.”

The voice came from behind me, and I didn’t respond or move. I stayed frozen. If I responded or moved a muscle, I knew what would happen.

“Detention.” The female murmur behind me was curled with cruelty, her voice prickling the hairs on the back of my neck. Agent Caine was a trainer I could tolerate if she was in a good mood. Sometimes, if we completed training, we were allowed to breathe, feel fear, and be human, even if it was for minutes before our next class started. That day, however, she seemed to be in a shitty mood. Two students had already been dragged to detention for showing emotion. That’s not what I struggled with. I could cleanse my expression of human emotion. Easy. 

Middle school had taught me that. 

But it was simple things like holding a weapon, as well as self-defense class, that was beating my ass. 

I was the worst in our class. My classmates didn’t let me forget that, with the majority of them already submitting to the brutal brainwashing we were subjected to in middle school. 

I was one of the stragglers who was still holding on. 

I half wondered if my trainer knew that. 

When I didn’t dare move, she sighed and kicked my legs further apart. “You are not welcome in this class until you can hold your weapon correctly.”

“No,” I heard myself say with a sharp breath. I was aware I was speaking without being spoken to, except I couldn’t stop myself, my heart in my throat. I squeezed my eyes shut, swallowing down that fear I wasn’t allowed to have.  “I can do it.”

“You have five seconds, or it’s three hours in the detention closet.”

When I tried to, my body seized up, years of training plunging down the drain. When it became evident that I wasn’t going to shoot, I was dragged from the classroom, kicking and screaming, allowing myself to feel human again, letting fear take over me. 

Humanity was a relief to me inside those school walls, where it was forcefully torn from us. And it was a monster inside me, a carnivorous thing inside my head that knew no logic or reason, rejecting the thing that had attempted to contort my mind into submission. I opened my mouth and screeched until my throat was raw, every movement forwards sending my body into jolting gesticulations I couldn’t control.  I knew what came next, and no amount of biting and flailing would get me out of it. The corridor was empty, each training room allowing me a glimpse into older kids—who were too far gone to come back, already in their last stages of training. 

Detention was right at the end of the hall; a tiny, suffocating closet that was put there as a reminder. If we dared show emotion, we were thrown in there. 

If we fought back, we were thrown in there. The wooden bench next to the detention closet was already filled with its latest victims, a boy, and a girl passed out on each other, their wrists cuffed to the bench—while a third boy was sitting with his knees to his chest, his arms tightly wrapped around himself. 

I recognized him as Hart, who until then had been able to hold on. Now, though, there was something about him that turned my stomach. His eyes stared forwards, vacant, and yet I could detect an indescribable agony writhing through him as he tightened his arms around his knees, pulling them closer to his chest. His gaze drank in nothing, and yet I knew he was looking for something, with desperation being one of those last lingering pieces of him clinging on. I forced myself to look away from the boy. If I didn’t, if I allowed myself to really look into his eyes, I would lose myself completely. 

I stopped screaming when I was shoved into the room. It was exactly how I imagined it, a closet converted into our own personal hell. Inside that room was a simple wooden chair with velcro straps attached, and a TV screen. 

Before I could try and attempt to escape, to plead that I could in fact hold a weapon, I was forced onto the chair, my wrists strapped down. It was the color of the floor that stiffened me to the chair. I could see grisly red, lumps of barf. The walls were covered in varying shades of red, new and old, and I wondered how many students had lost themselves inside this room. 

“It’s been a while, Freida.” The woman’s voice crept into my mind, and I slowly lifted my head, my gaze automatically finding the dot I had been trained to focus on. I felt my body go limp, my struggling wrists relaxing on the chair's armrests.  “Now, why are you in detention today, hmm?"

“I failed to shoot my target.”

When her face became a rapidly moving spiral, my eyes followed it eagerly. “Well, that’s too bad! Why don’t we go through it together?”

I knew exactly what came next, the product of what was on the floor, but somehow, my body still jolted, and I still screamed through my teeth. “Okay! Now, let’s start with your stomach. You don’t need it, right? Let’s empty it out!"

Her words caused me to lurch forwards and heave up the slimy contents of my stomach, choking on another cry splitting from my lips.

“Well done! Now, how about your brain? I’m sure you can live with half of one—” Her words collapsed into white noise in my mouth when agonizing pain struck the back of my head. I could already feel her phantom hands breaking into my skull and taking my brain into a vice grip. She squeezed, and I cried out, my words tangled and wrong. I couldn’t find my ability to beg for mercy. She had taken that away too. “Aw, don’t be scared! You can live without half a brain, Freida! If you want, I can scoop all of it out right now!”

“No,” I spoke through another mouthful of barf, my body convulsing. “Please!”

With my vision blurring, the pain dangerously close to knocking me out, I could see on the ground, where some students hadn’t been so lucky, brains spattering the floor, blood-stained pink. “Then do what I say.” Her voice hardened and the pain stopped for one glorious moment. I took advantage of that moment, releasing myself to her. The ground beneath me suddenly felt as light as a cloud, and her voice morphed into a gentle murmur. “Stop fighting me and follow your orders.”

I heard myself mimic her words.  

“Stand up.”

I did when the restraints came apart allowing me to lift my wrists.

“Take the gun.”

I pick up the handheld from the ground, and this time my hands did not shake, my fingers wrapping around the butt automatically.

“Feet apart.”

I spread my feet apart.

“Back straight.”

I lifted my head, held it high, jutting my chin, my finger comfortable on the trigger.

“Take aim.” She said. “Remember, you are destroying the brain to prevent regeneration,” her voice was almost motherly, and I automatically attached myself to it. Static buzzed in my ears, goosebumps prickling on my arms, but this time I wasn’t scared.

“Fire.”

I heard the gunshot, but before I could see any damage or if I’d gotten it right, the dot was dragging me from that memory too.

And plunging me into another one.

It was my senior year. 

I was in a bigger training room, this time with real targets on the walls. There was nowhere to look except her. Flickering light surrounded us, four walls and four screens filled with her face. Our trainer, this time a pretty woman with a strict ponytail screamed orders at us, and we obeyed them. She told us to run the length of the training room, pick up a gun, and shoot out targets. I did without fail, but my gaze was never on the target, or what I was doing. It was always trained on her face and the multiple dots I had been engineered to follow. Self-defense training followed, and my opponent did not have a face, his identity shrouded in shadow. 

I never looked for faces, scared of what I would see if I searched for those kids I’d grown up with. Like everyone else, and even myself, his body was trained to attack without hesitation. When he lunged forwards, I took two steps back, already assessing him for weak spots. 

He was failing to put pressure on his leg, which I knew was due to an injury he’d gotten a few days prior. However, with the woman in the static fully embedded inside of our heads, we were not allowed to feel pain until training was over. His body might have been struggling to stand on that one foot, but his mind couldn’t feel it. I used that to my advantage, knowing that if I couldn’t bring him down—I could at least cripple him from the waist down. 

My opponent swung for me, and I ducked—only just. In the dim light of the room, I started to make out a facial structure, his face slowly bleeding back to fruition the more I concentrated on him, and not the woman’s face in the back of my eyes. In two strides, I was in front of him, and in a moment of vulnerability, I recognized him when the knuckles of his fist slammed into my nose, sending me flat on my back, all of the breath being violently knocked from me.

He was already looming over me, wrapping his hand around my elbow and yanking me to my feet. If we stayed on the ground for longer than three seconds, it was an automatic detention. Swiping my bloody nose, I forced myself back to unsteady feet, blinking rapidly. Until that moment the shadows dancing around me had been just that… shadows. Until reality bled through.

Hart was standing in front of me, already shuffling backward, his hands out in front of him, ready for another attack.

He was older, his body sculpted into one of a soldier, with shorter hair in a shaggy cut, and hardened eyes. His dimpled almost-smile was gone. 

The agony I had seen in his sixteen-year-old self, was gone, twisted into an almost feral look of determination. “Hit me.” He surprised me by speaking when we weren’t allowed to. He twisted around, risking a look at our trainer, before turning back to me. “Now! She's waiting for you, moron."

I did, after hesitating. 

I let the static woman coax my body into her puppet, and managed a roundhouse kick which he didn’t block, taking him down. I risked a glance at our trainer, who was actually waiting for me. The rest of the class was done, and I'd been blind to us being the only pairing who were yet to finish our fight. 

“Congratulations!" 

The woman's voice prickled through the static, once again seeping into our heads when we resumed position. I managed to jump to my feet, my arms falling to my sides, my back straight, and my head held at the perfect angle to her satisfaction. Hart followed, though I noticed him stumble slightly, and our trainer, who was standing against the wall, noticed it automatically, her eagle eyes zeroing in on him, her lips curving into a scowl. 

“You have all made it into *The Family Program!*” 

*See?*

The woman's real voice sliced through my sixteen-year-old self's memories as if she was enjoying watching it herself. “You can’t remove me,” she chuckled. “Because I made you. From scratch! How cool is that? The United States government created me to arm our children to be the next generation in hunting these entities that threaten us."

“You turned human children into soldiers.” I gritted out. “You tortured us.”

She laughed this time, cackling in my ears. *I don’t think I remember saying they were human, young lady! In fact, just like your elementary school, you were the only human recruit in your graduating class,” she sighed. “Before your mother took you away from us.*

The door opened inside my memory, a shadow stepping into the training room. 

*”ʍou ʇɥƃᴉɹ ɹǝʇɥƃnɐp ʎɯ ǝǝs oʇ ʇuɐʍ I ¿ɐpᴉǝɹℲ“*

*"ʍou ʇɥƃᴉɹ ɹǝʇɥƃnɐp ʎɯ ǝǝs oʇ ʇuɐʍ I ¿ɐpᴉǝɹℲ?”* Hart’s expression lit up with recognition, his lips mimicking the odd words, and I finally saw what might have been a dimpled smile, before a soldier strode over to him, pulled out a rectangular device, and cranked the dial to the highest setting. The boy dropped to his knees, his expression twisting with agony. I could see his lips moving, his head pressed into the floor, eyes squeezed shut. “Three point one, four, one, five, nine—"

His mouth stretched into a mute cry, and I glimpsed too-sharp teeth.

“Stop!”

“Speak like a human!” The guard thundered, sticking the barrel of his gun into the boy’s head, clicking the safety off. “If you ever say those words again, I will blow out your brains, you fucking monster.” He straightened up. “I want you to tell me what he said in English.”

Hart got to his feet, resuming position. I could see blood pooling from his nose and eyes, and when I really looked, I swore I could see something I shouldn’t. There was something attached to him, a phantom darkness I could see in the shadow at the door.  

“He said, “Freida. I want to see my daughter right now.” The boy seethed through gritted teeth. 

“Get on your knees.”

Hart did, bowing his head.

The guard stamped on his neck, pressing pressure and forcing the boy flat on his face. “How do we permanently destroy a ʍopɐɥs?”

"We sever its brainstem!” Hart gritted out through a snarl.

"Freida, what's going on?" 

The shadow in the door was calling my name. I remembered how to breathe and lost my composure, my arms relaxing at my sides. First, I stepped back, cringing away, my body physically pulling me away from the thing. The shadow strode forwards and grabbed my arm. I saw no face, only a monster hiding behind a façade. I could sense his terror. But past that, I saw nothing but bleeding shadows, wet tendrils stuck to my palms. “Whatever you are doing in here, my daughter is not part of it.” I stared down at his hand, a tendril of dark. I inched away, but he held me tighter. “You’re disgusting,” the shadow said in a yell. “What are you doing to these kids?"

He dragged me from the room, and a red light followed him.

He was a monster.

The red light found him, blurring over his eyes, prancing over the curve of his nose. I let go of his hand, allowing the red light to pinpoint the middle of his forehead. 

“Feet apart...” I hummed to myself, situating myself in position, my legs apart. 

*Take aim*

I held up finger guns, closing one eye to find my trajectory, my eyes following the light, and the guard pointing his gun at the monster.

*Fire*

The recoil in my finger guns felt real, but it wasn’t my shot. For a delirious moment, I was delighted I had taken down the monster, before the shadow morphed into a human face, my father’s face, and then exploded into vicious red and writhing darkness. 

That darkness felt comfortable, like home. 

Before it was blown into bits in front of me. 

“He was a monster, Freida,” the woman murmured inside my head. “Just like your mother and brothers. The ʍopɐɥs are a category five level threat to the human race. Did you know they eat human meat to survive? How about that they exist purely because of human imagination? These things were created from the recesses of a poisoned mind, Fredia, and spread like a virus. We are what sustains them. 
What gives them their power? Human pain. Human fear. And the flesh off of our bones. They are a disease, and you were created to destroy them. So! Why don’t you turn some of that pain into something useful, hmm? Like destroying the rest of your monstrous family. Let’s go over your training again,” her voice crackled in my skull. 

“I want you to resume what we started when you were a child. Your mother took you away before we could subjugate you.” I could still feel my father’s blood covering my face and sticking to the back of my neck, but I couldn’t move.  “Which is a pity,” she sighed. “You were the only human recruit we had. Do you remember the detention room? That is the process of what we call Severing. Think of it like… hmm… like peeling off plastic!" 

She chuckled. "Before a ʍopɐɥs can fully blossom into adulthood, we rip off its flesh, three or four layers of it, and then sever its limbs so it can’t grow them back, rendering it stuck in human form. The young ones are easy to convert, far less powerful than the parents. From there, we erase its memories and transform it into a valuable asset! We don’t believe in killing children. Even ʍopɐɥs children.” 

I thought back to the detention room, the gory red splattered on the ground, and what it really was, inky black tendrils that stuck to the floor, still twitching, still alive, after these kids had been sliced into, this part of them cut away. The boy sitting on the bench, cradling the loss of his phantom limbs, wide eyes struggling to comprehend having something torn from him, and yet not knowing what it was. Hart. 

Accidentally speaking a language his tongue still knew how to speak, wrapping his arms around his knees and mourning his severed self. 

“Freida!”

My brother’s frightened cry snapped me out of it, bringing me back to reality, back to my mom's bathroom. 

When I opened my eyes, the first thing I saw was red. It spattered the walls, dripping from every tile. There was something lying on the floor, but my brain refused to register the reality of what it was. Instead, my gaze was glued to the eldest Delaney sibling crouched in front of me, one arm wrapped around my struggling brother, his other protruding a gun into his temple. Jasper leaned forward, and I could see that he was covered in my family, remnants of them dripping from his face and caked in his fingernails. 

There was so much red, so much blood, and yet also, blanketed darkness glued to his neck and peeling from his cheeks where he had butchered them. His eyes, no matter how vacant and inhuman they were—I still knew them. 

The Delaney boy slowly inclined his head, his expression bored, like he’d been waiting for the woman to finish raking my mind. “How do you permanently destroy a ʍopɐɥs?" 

Jasper's voice was a robotic drone, as he pulled PJ to his feet, before shoving him onto his back and stamping on his neck, pressing pressure with the curve of his boot. 

"Freida," my brother managed to sob into the floor, his next words choking out in a cry, when Jasper dragged the barrel of his gun down the curve of his Adam's apple, almost teasingly. "Freida, oh god, he killed…he killed Mom!" 

"I killed the monster," Jasper Delaney said in a smooth murmur. The elder Delaney sibling's movements were familiar, mimicking the monster who had turned him into a mindless hunter. 

I remember being unable to move, unable to scream, when the boy bent down, stuck his gun into the back of my brother's skull, and pulled the trigger. 

I didn't hear the gunshot, as time seemed to slow down. PJ was there one minute, alive, and then he was gone, reduced to a vivid explosion painting surviving white. Jasper Delaney’s voice echoed his younger self when he reached out and yanked me to my feet, his lips forming that same brainwashed smile from our middle school days. 

In the corner of my eye, Luna Delaney was grasping onto Spencer, who seemed awake and horrified, his flickering, confused eyes catching mine, lips forming numbers. 

*Three point one, four, one, five, nine–*

"How do you permanently destroy a ʍopɐɥs?" Jasper echoed the woman's voice in my head, that same question, over and over again, her smile breaking out onto his lips, bleeding into reality. 

“We sever the brainstem."

… 

I'm sure you know where this is going, and I hate to admit that yes, I did become a member of the family, and my next posts are going to be extremely sensitive. 

This was the point when I realized if I was going to beat these brainwashed bastards, then I had to join them.
