My name is Roger, i like to go on walks late at night. i have some notable experiences, but none will ever top this one: It was late at night, i was bored and sleepless, i hadn't gone on my walk that day either so i decided to kill two birds with one stone, by going out on a 3 am walk.

I walked the oddly desolate streets seeing very little cars, maybe 10 cars at most? Anyways, i was walking until i reached this park; i forgot its name. In the park there were some animals, squirrels, some ducks in the pond. On this night however, it was dead silent. I walked around until i noticed a bench, i was feeling a bit tired so i decided to take a a small break.

I woke up an unknown amount of hours later, a man was standing Infront of me, in a trench-coat and fedora. The man was facing his back to me, looking off into the pond, i look around for a minute and notice no-one else is at the park. I get off the bench and slowly approach this strange trench-coated man.

When i got close enough i tapped him on the shoulder and he didn't react, i tried to speak but couldn't find my voice, however i didn't need to as the man slowly tilted his head. He had a disturbingly large grin, almost inhuman. I slowly backed up from the man but he began to approach me, his head was essentially on backwards. The man continued to stumble backwards towards me, i felt his eyes locked onto mine, although i couldn't even see his.

The man then began to sprint backwards towards me, he tackled me and my head hit the floor, the man got up and pulled out a razor sharp knife. The man sliced away at my arm with the knife until i punched him square in the face, his hat flew off and in the moonlight i saw he had no skin on his head. No skin whatsoever.

The man then ran over to his hat and put it back on his head, whilst i could i sprinted as fast as i could away from the man, i made many extra swerves and curves on my way back home. If he was following me he definitely lost track of me.

a few days after this incident i received a letter, it wasn't signed by anyone. i read

"I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE."

I had never been more terrified in my life. i can't confirm nor deny it was the man from the other night, but chances are it was. I sold my house and rented a hotel whilst i browsed other houses.

During one of these hotel nights, i heard a knock on my door, it was roughly 4:50 AM when this happened so i was a little freaked out, i got up and looked through the peephole.

I looked through the peephole and nobody was their, then i noticed another letter on the floor. I sheepishly opened it up and it read

"FOUND YOU." 

I've just moved into my new house and I'm afraid this skinless man will find me, i tried reporting him to the police but they simply say

"People can't live without skin."

They think I'm delusional. I tried showing them the letters but they're just gone.

I know i'm not delusional though, i have a scar on my arm where the man sliced me. It's exactly the same as where the man sliced open my arm that night.

what do i do?
