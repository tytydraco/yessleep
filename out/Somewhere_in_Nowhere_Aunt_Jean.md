She’s not actually my aunt; I really don’t know who or what she is. Every so often I forget she’s even there, and that’s why sometimes I say I live alone. Most of the time, it feels like I do. But Aunt Jean is always around somewhere.

Aunt Jean has been… existing here for about three years. And in all that time, I’ve never heard her say a single word. I don’t know if she’s mute, or if she just prefers to smile all day. But what I do know is she’s been nothing but kind to me since the day she arrived. She may be a bit weird, but there are much stranger things out there. 

It all happened one night not too long after my seventeenth birthday. I was feeding my two pigs, when a deafening *crrrrrrack* followed by an even louder **BOOM** echoed out from somewhere in the distance. I hadn’t bought my four-wheeler yet, and the truck had come down with a horrible case of Radiator Diarrhea last week, so I saddled up Hephaestus and went to check it out. He was annoyed at being disturbed from his nap, but I gave him an apple, and he got over it quick enough. 

It wasn’t the wisest thing to leave the farmstead after dark, but I was worried someone could’ve gotten maimed or killed. The last thing I needed was the blues swarming around out here in the sticks, suspecting me of crimes I didn’t commit. Also the whole morality thing.

The closer we got to where the sound had come from, the more spooked Hephaestus became.

“Come on you old coot,” I said, nudging the heels of my boots into his sides. He trotted forward reluctantly, and that was when I saw what had caused the noise.

If you were to drive past the offshoot that is my road, eventually one side of the forest opens up. A line of lonely high voltage transmission towers runs along the clearing, like soldiers lined up for battle. My money is on them being connected to a secret government laboratory. 

Two of them had been knocked down and were laying in a twisted pile, making concerning zips and pops. I hoped they didn’t start a fire, because there was no way I had enough salt to fix that. It was the weirdest thing I’d seen all week, but it was shortly about to be dethroned.

“What in the sheep-fucking hell?”

I jumped off of Hephaestus’ back to get a closer look, but he immediately moved in front of me and lowered his head. The last time Hephaestus had made a stance like this was when we got caught by a black bear while I was taking him for a little stroll. The bear would’ve sooner turned neon purple than have been scared of the old wheezy bastard, but it ran off regardless. 

He raked his hoof along the ground and snorted like a poor excuse for a bull. I scrambled for his saddlebag and pulled out my maglite. 

“What is it, boy? What do you see?”

The smell hit me first. I turned on the light and shined it in the direction he was looking, clutching my nose, and noticed two things. The first, was that the ground around the downed towers was soaked in blood. I don’t mean that an animal was mauled there, or something, and blood was splattered around. The entire ground. Was *saturated* with blood. There wasn’t a speck of green to be found as far as I could see. It looked like it was a titan’s time of the month or something. I could tell it wasn’t exactly fresh, and I didn’t know if that made me feel better or worse. Decaying blood has a certain smell, and I wish there was a stronger word than “vomit-worthy” to use here, but let’s go with that.

The second thing I noticed, crouched by the side of the road, was an old woman. She wore a dress straight out of a prairie Western, and her silver-white hair was pulled loosely back. Small dots of soot stained her owl-lense glasses, and despite being out here all alone in the near dead of night, by two downed electrical lines, she was all smiles. Despite the mess, there wasn’t even the tiniest pinprick of red anywhere on her. 

“Ma’am? What’re you doing out here? Do you need help? Do you uh… know where all that blood came from?”

I spoke to her as gently as I could through my held nose. There was no answer, so I began slowly walking over. Hephaestus tried to nudge me away, but I gently pushed him aside. If things went south, there was a reason I’d slung my shotgun over my back right before I left. 

I offered out my hand, and she stared at it for a minute before taking it and letting me help her to her feet. I couldn’t be sure that all that blood was her responsibility— it wouldn’t have been the strangest coincidence I’d seen —and I wasn’t about to leave her alone out here in the dark.

“Where’s your family? Where did you come from?”

I had to consider the possibility that this was some poor woman with old age confusion that had wandered out into the night. But what could I do? Would anyone even look at a missing grandma poster?

I knew most of the old ladies in town, and I’d never seen this woman before. 

“What’s your name?”

Nothing. She just stared at me and kept right on smiling.

“Okay, well, then I’m going to find something to call you. I don’t want to call you grandma. Because you’re not my grandma. That’s nonconsensual grandmothering.”

As I walked back toward Hephaestus with her, he whinnied in protest and clopped backward. 

“Oh come on, Heph. It’s just a little old lady. She’s not going to hurt you.”

Hephaestus reluctantly moved forward again, and I carefully grabbed his reins. 

“How about… Aunt… oh, Aunt something. Aunt Jean?”

For the first time, she gave me something different than a smile. She looked thoughtful, before nodding once. Then she returned to her favorite pastime which, as far as I could tell, was creepy smiling. Hey, we all have our hobbies. 

“Hephaestus, Aunt Jean is our guest for the night. And if you buck her off, I’m going to be very mad at you. So stay still.”

Before I could so much as touch his saddle, Aunt Jean was already on his back. But that’s not totally right. She was *standing* on his back. 

Hephaestus was, unsurprisingly, not a big fan of this. He neighed loudly and threw both legs back in a swift kick that could’ve decapitated a moose. I’d only been on the receiving end of one of those kicks once, and it had ended with a broken leg, four broken ribs, and a kaleidoscope of bruises that took months to fade. 

Despite his attempt to get her off, Aunt Jean didn’t so much as wobble. I watched in silent amazement as she lifted one leg and settled into a yoga pose.

“You’re one nifty nonagenarian, aren’t you?”

She winked at me, and I decided that maybe it wouldn’t be so horrible to have her around for the night.

Once Hephaestus had been soothed and bribed with another apple from his saddlebag, I climbed on and booked it back to the house. Something about staying there for another second felt wrong. Like whatever had put all that blood there was watching and waiting for the right time to add more.

Aunt Jean didn’t so much as waver from her place on his back the whole way there. Either she’d escaped from the world’s best acrobat troupe, or she wasn’t entirely human. I didn’t have much of a problem with either.

Of course, as soon as I made it back to the house and let Hephaestus resume his nap, I did the sensible thing and called the police. I didn’t want to, and it went exactly about how I expected it to.

“Hello, you’ve reached the Battleman Police Department. How may I help you?”

The man on the other spoke in a gruff, no-nonsense tone. This was already going swimmingly.

“Um… hi, I’m calling to report a missing person? Or... I think a found person would be a better word.”

The man on the other end paused.

“You want to report… a found person? Do you have a name?”

“She won’t actually talk to me. I don’t think she talks at all. I found her out by the side of the road near Silver’s Curve. There were some downed lines nearby, and a lot of blood? She might have wandered off from somewhere. She’s really old and there’s got to be some kind of family out looking for her.”

“Did you say Silver’s Curve?”

I bit my lip and braced myself for what was coming next.

“Yes. I live down the dead end road just past Silver’s Curve.”

“Sorry, our jurisdiction doesn’t go that far.”

“Whose jurisdiction is it, then?”

The voice on the other end actually laughed. They were getting bolder.

“I don’t know, and even if I did, I wouldn’t tell you. Weirdo.”

Of course, he used a much less nice word than weirdo. But I hung up on him before he could finish his insult to my identity. I pulled the phone cord from the wall in anger and turned to Aunt Jean, who sat passively on the couch.

“One of these days, I’m just going to stop calling down there. They don't ever do anything. I can’t remember the last time they sent a car out here. I know that’s probably for the best, but it still ticks me off.”

She tilted her head to the side, and the perpetual smile she had grew just a little sadder. 

“It’s alright. I can handle everything just fine on my own. I mean, you can stay if you want. I would try to find your family, but I’m starting to think you might not have one of those.”

It was then that I noticed the singe along the hemline of her dress and the dirt stained across the skirt. Tears ran along her collar and sleeves. She looked like she’d fallen up a mineshaft. I could’ve sworn those weren’t there before…

“Do you want something else to wear? I think I’ve got some spare clothes in the attic.”

Aunt Jean only sat there and smiled. If she’d spoken, I might have imagined her saying “the Lord put me into this world in rags, and I’ll leave it in rags.” But I decided that a clean shirt couldn’t hurt.

If I could talk to the ancestors of mine that built this farmhouse, I think the first thing I’d ask is why they put the attic hatch in the upstairs bathroom. Only after that would I start getting into existentialism. I’ve got my priorities in order.

The ladder came down with a heavy *clunk* on the stained bathroom tiles. The attic was mostly dark, but I made my way over to the wardrobe by the light of the glowing slime mold in the far corner. I always do my best to give it a wide berth, and it’s a whole lot easier to let it keep existing up here than getting someone to wire a light socket into the attic. I still shudder to think about what Hairy did with the last handyman who made it out here. 

There was only one outfit in the wardrobe, and I remembered too late that I moved everything else inside to the closet in the spare bedroom. The lavender shirt and brown pinafore hung still and silent there, as if staring me down. If my life had gone the way it should’ve, it wouldn’t have been here. It would’ve been on the porch, snug on my mother as she watched the night sky because “how could she sleep when the rest of the world was so alive?” The last time I’d seen her that happy was many years ago. 

The last time I’d seen her at all was when she took these clothes off and wandered into the unknown night, dancing down the dirt path like there was a song in the air only she could hear. I was just fourteen then, and I’d been on my own ever since. On my own, except for the animals, and now, a tentative new friend. 

I held onto the fabric, and let myself believe for a second that I would go downstairs and my mother be waiting for me with peanut butter toast and a smile. But then I let go, and all that was left were footprints in the dust. 

When I made it out of the attic, I discovered that Aunt Jean had migrated up to the spare bedroom and must’ve found the closet. She was wearing a new white dress with a shawl. The shawl had belonged to my mother, but I’d never seen the dress before. Lighthouses were evenly spaced across the hemline, accented by foamy green waves and rocky islets. 

She did a little twirl, as if she was asking what I thought. 

“I love it. It definitely suits you.”

She gave me a proud smile before moving to the corner and sitting down in a rocking chair that had never been in here before. Clearly, she’d claimed the room as her own, and who was I to argue with that?

I told her goodnight, and she just smiled at me. When I went downstairs to make sure all the doors had been locked, there was a plate sitting on the kitchen table. I sniffed at the toast left out for me. It was pecan butter, but that was close enough. I ate it in the dark, thinking about how it would really suck if I got a chest-burster from eating toast. At least take me back to the mothership first.

No one ever came for Aunt Jean, but that wasn’t surprising. She integrated quite well to life on the farm. 

Most of the time, she stays in her room, but sometimes I find her wandering around outside. She always makes it back, so I let her go generally wherever she pleases. Sometimes she stands on the roof, and sometimes I find her in the pasture with Milkshake and Dairy Queen. Sometimes she hides under the kitchen sink, and I even found her buried underneath the hay in the loft once.

Three years later, and she wasn’t in any of those places today. Instead, she was collecting the eggs from the chicken coop.

I didn’t see her doing work around the farm much, not that it was a big issue. She was pushing a hundred, and I didn’t mind if she spent her days sitting around and looking pretty. But I appreciated it on the rare occasions it happened. 

“Morning Aunt Jean. How’s the huevos haul looking today?”

The chickens had formed a semicircle around her, watching us and clucking low and slow. Something wasn’t right. Aunt Jean’s smile never wavered as she pulled an egg from the basket and placed it in my hand. It was larger than the others, and as bright red as a ripe apple. 

“Well, I guess that answers that question. Now which one of you laid this? I promise I won’t be mad. Just fess up.”

No chicken claimed ownership of the egg, and I couldn’t say I hadn’t known it would go down that way. They only watched on silently as I cracked it open. 

Foul, black yolk streamed out, along with something large and leggy. It all landed on the ground with a wet *thwup*, and I had to pinch my nose closed. The leggy thing in the ichor began to wriggle around and scream, and I stumbled back. Aunt Jean brought her booted foot down on the strange humanoid, crushing it mid-screech. 

“O…kay then. I seriously doubt homunculi make very good omelets. I think it’s time to switch the girls back to the old feed.”

Aunt Jean picked up the broken body of the tiny creature and swallowed it whole. 

“Scratch that. I don’t think they’d make very good omelettes for most people.”

She smiled with old teeth stained black, and I started bracing myself for a trip to town. I wouldn’t go until tomorrow, but even that wasn’t enough time to mentally prepare.
