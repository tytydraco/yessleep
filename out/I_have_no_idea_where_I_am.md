"What the fuck?"

That was my first thought upon seeing whatever the fuck this place is supposed to be. My second thought was that I must be tripping balls (and, to be fair, I was). 

No idea how I'd gotten here. Most of the night thus far had been one long, crossfaded blur of fuckery. Myself and a few friends were out partying all night. Met some rich dude, who took us back to his place to continue partying. Rode around in his limmo and smashed a few mailboxes because I said I hadn't done that before. Cool guy, honestly. 

But yeah - in other words, I barely remember the hours leading up to my predicament, nevermind how I actually got here. Pretty sure I blacked out at some point.

Which I find ironic, considering now there's a motherfucking black hole where the sun used to be. Fuckin' void sphere. The ol' danger circle. Like the universe is mockingly flashing its spooky ominous asshole directly in my face.

No idea how that alone doesn't mean immediate death. Do black holes even have a habitable zone? I don't fucking know. But clearly I'm alive, so let's just go with "plot armour" and move on.

I am way too fucking high for this shit.

There's more than that, too. The world is all... fuckeried up. Shenaniganaried. Some other fucked word that conveys shit's weird as fuck.

The sky seems to be this dark sickly green colour. Almost black, but not quite. Like puking your guts up in a back alley at night. That colour. 

And the trees are all weird shapes, too, with this dark red colour to them. They look like they're breathing, but at the moment I genuinely can't tell if that's just the drugs fucking with my perception.

Again, on many levels, no idea how I'm not dead.

My phone works, miraculously. Tried the GPS immediately of course, but it seems to jump all over the fucking place any time I attempt to get a lock. Like, one second it says I'm in Nevada, the next Moscow. My clock also keeps changing time zones randomly, because why the fuck not I guess.

Which means time is impossible to keep, since the dark sucky boi in the sky doesn't seem to ever move. Guess that means this place is tidally locked, but that doesn't make any fucking sense.

How the fuck does my phone work?

Also, the air is still as fuck. Like, indoors level still. No idea what the fuck is up with that. No clouds in the sky at all. The stars are warped as fuck because again, big danger orb for a sun. Again, no idea how I'm not dead. Also no idea how I'm able to see this far with no discernable light source. 

Have yet to see much wildlife. Or any for that matter. Not even an insect. Which I find strange considering the overwhelming abundance of plant life. 

But anyways - I guess this is me asking if anyone has any idea what the fuck might be going on. I've clearly stepped into some bizarro bullshit world, and I don't exactly have the ability to charge my phone. So let's make this count yeah?

Preferably before my high wears off and shit starts feeling real.
