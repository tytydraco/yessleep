“What am I doing here Mr Devlin?” I asked, looking around. “Are you really the ….”

“Yes,” he replied back before I could even finish the question. And then he went silent again, intensely staring at me as his tail swished about in the air.

A lot was going on in my mind. There were so many questions I wanted to ask. But I went with the one that would probably offer me the quickest exit out of there.

“Are we through with the month-long deal? Can I leave?” I asked him

“You haven’t spent the tickets yet Mathew,” he said, continuing to stare at me.

“I am not much of a gambling person Mr Devlin. I am just a simple guy. I don’t have much need for the gold tickets either. I am willing to perhaps donate it to someone in the room downstairs, whoever is interested in playing” I ventured, hopefully

“You have to use the gold tickets that have come in your possession Mathew. You can’t simply get rid of them by throwing or giving them away. You need to spend them.”

“But why?” I asked, suddenly interjecting.

“Because they represent your sins Mathew, which is why you can’t get rid of them. But when you spend them, you accept your part in it, showing a willingness to pay a price for your redemption” the devil answered back.

“Redemption?”

“How?”

“By coming to work for me” the devil replied smiling, his tail cutting through the air as it swayed in   a sinuous dance.

The golden glow in his eyes intensified, revealing an otherworldly allure. "Join my ranks, Mathew, and I’ll help you unlock the hidden realms of your soul"

“But I didn’t do anything wrong.” I immediately protested. “I stayed away from all the violence. I was only the driver the entire time. I did as I was told. Even after my friend Eric was killed by your people, I followed through with your orders. I had no choice in the matter in the first place.“

“But you did have a choice in the matter, Mathew! You could have simply chosen not to show up the following day, once I made you the offer. And that would have been the end of that. You used a considerable chunk of your freewill right there, when you decided to drive the clown to the pharmacy.”

“And you could have still walked away when you had parked your car outside my establishment, seriously wondering about the path you were on. And you chose poorly again. What little freewill you had left, you spent it all that night.”

"People don’t realize their situation until they get in over their heads. Yours came when the police precinct went up in flames. You knew a big line had been crossed, and your choice was to take evasive action by fleeing. But you were already knee-deep in this mess by now, and there was no turning back. You had to now see it through to the end," the devil's words resonated, a somber reminder of the irreversible path I had treaded.

I closed my eyes in frustration as a wave of guilt and remorse ripped through every fibre of my being.

It felt like a mirror talking back to me, picking out my shortcomings at will and throwing them back at my face.

“Don’t you think this is entrapment?” I asked him finally, feeling helpless and unable to keep my voice in check.

“I was living my own life without being a threat or bother to society. Why drag innocent people into this web of deceit and lies?” I asked him.

The devil grinned, "Ah, Mathew, innocence is a fragile illusion. I simply offer choices to people; it's their decisions that entrap them."

“Why blame the apple in the tree, when it is your eyes that refused to look away?” he added.

The devil waited for me to respond, sensing that the inner turmoil was reaching its peak, he then continued to speak.

“Come work for me Mathew. Become an agent of my design. You will deliver my message to people when they are ready. You will tread places where light can never hope to reach. Together, we will spread my influence far and wide, casting shadows forever that linger in the hearts of the people we touch. Respond to your calling Mathew,  just like how your father did.”

I suddenly looked up at him in shock. “My father….. worked for you?” I asked, unable to suppress the quiver in my voice.

“Your father in fact was the one of the people who boarded the elevator with you.”

“You do remember right he even bowed down before you and Pamela when he got down on his floor?” the devil asked me, while I sat still, open mouthed in shock.

“Who else do you think slipped that little note in your coat? “

“Ah, that was sneaky of him I must admit. Still looking out for his son, I gather.” the devil said with a hint of amusement, relishing the unfolding drama.

 “Had it not been for his intervention, you would have spent your tickets by now and come directly under my employment.” the devil concluded.

“What work did my father do for you?” I asked him, for the first time, curiosity overtaking my disbelief.

“Your father works for me as a ledger man. You saw those people down at floor 41 didn’t you? The ones wearing a hat and dressed in a trench coat, with a file tucked under their arms?”

“They are the ones tasked with the responsibility of handing over the file to people, who are ready to embrace their true nature. The file is representative of a ‘ledger’, which is a culmination of an individuals' actions, choices, and the moral debts they accumulate through the course of their lives. So when somebody receives the file, they have reached a point in life where they can no longer maintain their status quo. They begin their inevitable descent into the darker recesses of their own existence.”

“But how will you know if somebody is ready?”

“Look at me Mathew” the devil said, spreading his hands, his lips curling into an evil smile. ”I have been here since the beginning of time. Do you think I haven’t yet figured out when a person will snap?”

 “The real question though is, are you ready to take on the role you are destined for? I mean you have already been working with your father in tandem, while serving this establishment.

“Working with my father? What do you mean?”

The devil chuckled before continuing to speak.

“Who do you think acted as the ledger man while approaching the clown or the woman dressed as a bird or the surgeon or every other person you chauffeured the past one month? It was your own dad Mathew.”

“Both father and son have been working together to propel individuals to embrace their own destiny, to bring them on the brink of self-awareness.”

“While the father showed them the mirror to help break the walls around them, his son drove them towards their eventual fate. Beautiful when you think about it, don’t you think?” the devil  mused, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction.

“So you want me to become a ledger man as well?” I asked finally, my voice laced with uncertainty.

“Yes. That is correct. While your father has served me well, he is a mortal at the end of the day. And I am not a tyrant to work him to be bone. He can retire and continue to serve in the afterlife. So it is essential that you fill in his place now.  You are ready Mathew. I can see it.” the devil spoke with a subtle nod of approval.

“Why can’t you hire someone else? Since my father has already served you, why not find a replacement from another family? Why does it have to be me?” I asked him.

“Because your family owes me Mathew. Your great great grandfather Armand Pritchard was a rich Count in Europe who lost all his wealth when he moved to the United States. He struck a deal with me promising 10 generations of Pritchard’s would serve at my feet if I helped him win back his wealth. So you are the fifth in that line Mathew. Your lineage is still only half way through with paying your debts.” the devil replied.

I sat there in shock as the weight of generations-old promises settled heavily on my shoulders. I had been aware that my forefathers were wealthy while my own father grew up poor since his childhood. But my biggest concern was for my own child.

“Does that mean Luke will have to take over from me as well?” I asked the devil, petrified at that prospect.

“Eventually yes. And so will his child, and later his child’s child and so on, until the debt is paid in full,” the devil affirmed, sealing the fate of generations to come.

“No, no, no……no” I began in anguish, my voice breaking under the weight of the revelation. "This can’t be happening. It’s not right to hold an entire lineage hostage to a promise made by someone centuries ago. I can’t let my son too be a part of this.” I said.

“Well your ancestors certainly didn’t mind the money that came their way until they squandered it away again, a second time. You can’t make a deal and then renege on it,” the devil answered back, his voice ice cold.

“But do you think you are being fair here, Mr Devlin? When you are forcing generations of descendants to do your bidding when they have actually had no choice in the matter?”

“Mathew, have you so quickly forgotten how you wound up here?”

“Do you really think you are here solely because of your ancestors? Are you saying you lacked the agency to make different choices?”

“Is that what you feel happened to your father as well, or might later happen to your son?”

I remained silent not knowing how to answer.

“What do you think actually happens when you make a deal with the devil, Mathew?”

“It gives me the opportunity to pursue you relentlessly without anyone running interference. That is the COST you incur Mathew.”

"Let me put it to you this way," he continued, sensing my struggle to make sense of it all.

"Imagine I am a fisherman standing on a boat in the middle of the ocean that is teeming with rich marine life. Among the vast array of fish at my disposal, I seek a particular one—an elusive, prized catch that holds a special significance to me, one that I know is fated to  cross my path.”

“This gives me the freedom to chase it without having to bother about any sort of divine intervention. And I can pursue it to the ends of the earth, knowing full well it is most likely to eventually yield, either to temptation or desperation."

“Are you saying Mr Devlin that God will not watch over people like me? That I am somehow not deserving of his benevolence or that He would not shine a light for me at the end of the tunnel?” I asked, feeling a little lump form around my throat.

“I am saying for people like you, there is only so much light you can handle. Interference does not have to always be a direct act of God. Like for instance, you are involved in a terrible car crash but escape with only minor bruises.”

“No, intervention can also occur in subtler ways, like the blessings of people in your life who make a difference.”

“Such as a father who guides a rebellious son, a mother who nurses her child back to health, a supportive sibling who sticks with you through thick and thin, or a friend who stands up for you against bullies in school. Blessings manifest in various forms.

“But then Mathew, for people like you these blessings are always on short supply. And when they run out, it leaves a gaping hole in heart that light can never hope to fill. It is then that you turn towards me for guidance.”

 As the devil's words settled over me like a suffocating fog, a flicker of realization sparked within.

I could sense that he was messing with my head in an effort to get me to toe his line.

At the same time, my mind was trying to conjure solutions to evade the same fate.

'There must be a way out of this,' I kept thinking to myself. The thought of passing this burden onto my son simply filled me with dread.

Perhaps I could flee with Luke whenever I get the chance and seek refuge in a religious place like a Church which could shield us from the Devil's influence.

While I furiously mulled on the future course of action in silence, the devil resumed speaking again.

“Mathew, you do realize that you are free to leave right? As long as you don’t spend the tickets, I will not touch you. But do remember this, every little plan you are hatching in your head right now, has already been tried before by others. So if you feel you need more time to figure this out, go ahead.”

“But keep in mind there will always come a moment, where you will eventually lay your hands on that tickets yourself. You can run and hide wherever you wish, but the tickets will continue to hang around your neck like an albatross.”

“Maybe you find refuge in another place by running away, but everybody there will eventually come to know you own something of value and that will put a permanent target on your back.”

“Or maybe in the future, there is an injury to you or Luke, and you finally decide to pawn the ticket because you urgently need money for surgery. Or maybe Luke develops a drug problem and decides to use the ticket to fund his habit. I could go on but you get the gist,” the devil warned with a malevolent grin.

“For better or worse, due to your dad’s intervention, you are sitting here right now in a position to negotiate your fate. Why not try and make the best use of it?” he asked me, finally.

 “I cannot abandon my child, Mr. Devlin, not when I find he is destined to eventually end up like me. I have a duty to protect his freedom, even if that means fighting a losing battle,” I said, crestfallen but with my voice resolute and filled with conviction.

For the first time in my life, I began to appreciate the choices my father was confronted with and the sacrifices he had to make to honor his obligations.

The devil regarded me with subtle amusement, silently gauging both my determination and the inner turmoil I grappled with.

In that silent moment of acknowledgment, it became evident that the devil fully comprehended the challenges I was prepared to face for the well-being of my child.

“Ok Mathew, maybe there is an alternative to this impasse,” the devil finally suggested. “But I am afraid you are not going to like it.”

“Mr Devlin. I am prepared to do whatever it takes to ensure my child has a shot at a normal life, even if it means giving up my own,” I stated resolutely.

The devil's horns suddenly turned red-hot as he let out a wave of laughter that echoed through the entire chamber.

Meanwhile, the flames licking the walls behind him surged in intensity.

A sudden ring of fire ignited around my legs, spreading rapidly to my feet and started crawling up my body. I screamed in agonizing pain while the devil continued to laugh in the distance. And then I saw the fire consume me whole as my entire body went up in flames.

When I opened my eyes, I realized I was sprawled on the couch in the living hall of my own apartment. As I wiped the beads of sweat away from my forehead, I noticed I was still dressed in last night’s tuxedo. So, the whole thing obviously was not a dream, but I still couldn’t remember how I got back home.

Luke was sitting in a nearby chair, watching his favorite show while busy munching on cereal. I got up from the couch and experienced a sense of disorientation lingering as I tried to piece together the events of the previous night. But deep down, my conscience was troubled, and I couldn’t yet figure out why.

I walked to my room and opened the closet to check for the gold tickets. They were no longer there.

At that very moment, I heard the unmistakable sound of a vehicle pulling up in the driveway. I walked over to the window to take a look and saw a large red limousine parked at the entrance of my apartment building. My heart began to race immediately, this was the same type of car that took dad away years ago and they were probably here for me now.

I made Luke get up from his seat and ordered him to stay put in his room. Soon after, the doorbell rang.

I approached the door, glanced through the peephole, and then proceeded to open it.

Henry Pritchard was standing at the entrance, wearing a hat and dressed in a trench coat with a file tucked under his arm.

“Hello Father”, I said looking at him. He had removed his goggles and his mask was down to his chin, a tear trickling down his eye as he looked in pain. I could see that my dad was here on an official visit.

Seeing my dad in person after all these years, the memories of last night all came flooding back. I began to recollect everything, including the deal that was struck with the devil.

“Is that for me?” I asked, pointing to the ledger in his hand.

“You should have waited, son. We could have figured out something else.” he said, his voice expressing both concern and lament.

While I knew my dad was looking out for my best, I wondered what other alternative was there.

I then simply leaned in to hug him for the first time in years and he embraced me back, bringing a wave of relief to my already overwhelmed emotions

 “Is this your last assignment?” I asked him, and he nodded in acknowledgement.

 ‘Good. Because that was part of the deal’ I said to myself in silence.

Our eyes then immediately shifted to Luke’s room, where the little boy was peeking from behind his door wondering what was unfolding in the living room.

“Come here boy, say hello to your grandpa”, I said looking at him.

As dad lifted Luke and gave his grandson a tight hug, I took away the ledger from his hand and sat down on a couch nearby to take a look.

When I opened it, all I found was a gold ticket inside.

I took it in my hand, and watched my reflection appear alongside a set of numbers and a date, before dissolving into nothingness.

“So I have around 72 hours?” I asked, pointing the card at dad. He nodded in silent affirmation while Luke was busy playing with his goggles.

I took a deep long breath and finally replied, "All right then. Let’s make the best use of the time we have left."

We spent the entire day outdoors, ensuring we gave Luke the best possible memories to last a lifetime. Dad and I took him to see a show by the Blue Man Group, where three blue-colored bald men enthralled the audience with their music, comic skits, and energetic performances.

Our ferry ride to Staten Island turned into a photo-filled escapade, capturing panoramic views of Manhattan with the three of us striking all kinds of silly poses together. This was followed by a stop at Lombardi’s, Luke’s favorite pizza joint.

The next day, we started with a trip to Central Park, where Luke enjoyed a ride on the famous carousel and we all took a relaxing rowboat ride on the lake. Afterwards, we headed to the American Museum of Natural History.

 I had signed up Luke and Dad to take part in a scavenger hunt at the venue, and the two of them had a blast as they spent the next couple of hours poring over clues, excitedly exploring exhibits, and discovering hidden treasures throughout the museum.

I stayed in the background, observing Luke form a bond with his grandad, their laughter and teamwork filling me with a sense of warmth and relief at the same time.

Later that evening, we went to Broadway to see The Lion King, and the joy on Luke’s face as he watched the performance was priceless. By the time we returned home, everyone was exhausted, and Luke had already fallen asleep.

The day before I was to leave, we spent the morning playing board games while ordering in.

A little after lunch time, I received a text from one of my colleagues at the rental agency whom I had been waiting to hear from all morning. I called out to Luke and told him we were going out for a little drive and told him to get quickly dressed.

When we arrived at the stadium, Luke had a puzzled look on his face.

“Do we have a game scheduled today dad?”, he asked me as we stepped down from the car and walked towards the stadium.

My friend and colleague from work, was waiting at the entrance and escorted us inside and I saw Luke’s jaw drop when he saw his soccer idol Messi  undergoing a training session on the field.

As we took a couple of seats in the stands, we saw Messi execute his signature moves and interact with his Miami teammates. Luke’s eyes were wide with awe and admiration. The entire experience was surreal for him, and he could hardly contain his excitement.

After the practice session, my colleague arranged for us to meet Messi, and Luke got the chance to take a photo and get an autograph from his hero. His face lit up like a 100 watt bulb when Messi placed his hand on his shoulder for the photo.

On our drive back home, I gently explained to Luke that I would be traveling to Europe for work. I told him it would only be for a month and there was nothing for him to worry about. "Grandpa will take good care of you till I get back," I reassured him.

Luke nodded subconsciously, his eyes still glued to the soccer ball that Messi had signed for him. He rolled it gently in his hands, a small smile playing on his lips as he traced the autograph with his fingers. I have never seen the kid so happy in his life.

In the evening, I had a private chat with dad regarding Luke, about how to manage him in my absence. I explained to him how I had coped during the difficult periods in my childhood, hoping that it would give him some insight on how to handle Luke if he started to act out.

Dad was particularly upset about the path I had chosen but there was nothing he could do to change it now. The two of us had a few shots of whiskey, to take away the edge and that did provide some relief. It was also my first adult moment with dad. So that’s a memory to keep.

The following day, the three of us left for Luke’s soccer practice in the evening. As Dad and I sat in the stands watching him train, a BMW car arrived at the venue, catching my immediate attention.

I hugged Dad one last time, and he had a hard time letting go of me. I called out to Luke, informing him that I was headed for the airport and waved goodbye. He rushed towards me and gave me a big hug before running back to his field to resume training.

I picked up my shoulder bag and headed towards the waiting car. The driver was around my age and I could deduce that this was not his first trip.

So, he definitely did have an inkling of what to expect. I could sense the same emotions in him that I experienced when I took on the job. I simply gave him my gold card and he placed it on the screen and started driving. I looked at Luke and dad one last time before the driver turned the corner and hit the main road.

Seated in the backseat, my mind began to recollect the conversation I had with the devil; the details of that encounter played in my head like a haunting melody. As the car moved through the city, I could already see the impact my decision would have on the family, knowing that Luke would struggle for many years and have difficulty adjusting to the public perception of his father.

The conversation towards the end was perhaps the most haunting of all when the devil started to make clear the expectations he had of me if I wanted to relieve my family of the generational burden. That part played itself over and over again in my head hundreds of times over the last couple of days.

The car began to slow down as it reached the destination. Before leaving, I locked eyes with the driver and uttered, "Best of luck."

A look of surprise flashed in his eyes, his demeanour swiftly softening as he realized someone understood the weight he carried. I could see that he had a hundred questions he wanted to ask me, but I was already out the door with my bag hung over my shoulder and made my way into the building.

As I climbed the stairs, I removed my jacket and cap from the bag and put it on. I could hear the devil utter those final words again and again, it literally forming an imprint on my mind. 

 

 

*“Ok Mathew, maybe there is an alternative to this impasse.”*

*“But I am afraid you are not going to like it.”*

*“Mr Devlin. I am prepared to do whatever it takes to ensure my son has a shot at a normal life, even if it means giving up my own”*

*“You are ready to give your life to save your son but are you ready to take a life for him?” the devil asked me*

*“Yes,” I said with reluctance.*

*“The more heinous the crime, the better protected your son will be from coming under my employment,” the devil finally spoke*

*.*

 

I reached the office of my boss Gary Mehicus and opened the door to find him busy on the phone.

His face immediately lit up when he saw me dressed in the autographed baseball jersey and cap he had gifted me for my birthday as a youngster. I waited for him to finish speaking.

“Did you and Luke catch a game today?” he asked me, looking curious as he put his phone down.

 

*“The more heinous the crime, the better protected your son will be from coming under my employment.”*

 

“What are you talking about Matt?” Gary asked me looking puzzled.

I repeated the exact words the devil had told me during our meeting.

While he still didn’t understand, I saw my godfather’s face turn pale when he noticed me removing a kitchen knife from my jacket and locking the door behind me.

 

 

**A Few Years Later**

Luke Pritchard entered the hospital with his ten-year-old son, Sam, holding a bouquet of flowers he wanted to give to a patient. When they reached the patient's room, Luke knocked on the door a couple of times before entering.

“Please come in,” a voice said from within the room.

An old man lay on the bed with both his legs heavily bandaged. He had been injured in an accident while attempting to save Sam, who had tried to cross the road without paying attention. The patient managed to save Sam in the nick of time but was struck by a motorcyclist, resulting in fractures in both his legs.

“Good morning. How are you doing today?” Luke asked as he entered the room with Sam by his side.

“Much better, Luke. Thank you,” the old man said.

The patient then looked at the boy and smiled. “How are you doing, young man?” he asked.

“Fine, sir. I am very sorry about what happened to you, sir,” Sam said, looking down and appearing very remorseful.

“Forget it, my child. I am just relieved you are alright,” Mr. Devlin replied, his face beaming.

Luke then placed the bouquet of flowers in Sam's hands and gently nudged him to give them to the patient. Sam moved forward and gingerly presented the flowers to Mr. Devlin, who accepted them with grace. He gave the young boy a hug and smiled warmly at him.

Luke had been visiting Mr. Devlin every day for the past week since the accident happened. The two men had grown close during these visits, opening up to each other about the challenges in their own personal lives. This was the first time since the accident that Luke brought Sam along with him so that he could apologize in person.

Mr. Devlin looked at Sam, who sat on a little stool next to his bed. “So, what are you wearing, my child? Are you a baseball fan?” he asked.

“Chip off the old block, eh?” he asked Luke, pointing at Sam’s jersey.

“Actually, he has taken after his grandfather. He was a big baseball fan,” Luke replied.

“Interesting... Is he the one you said is currently serving a life sentence in prison?” Mr. Devlin asked delicately.

“Yes, Mr. Devlin,” Luke replied, with a trace of sadness in his voice.

They eventually changed the subject and went on to talk about other things for the next half hour.

When Luke finally got up to leave, he asked, “Mr. Devlin, would it be okay if the three of us took a picture together? I would like to send a copy to my dad. I think he would love to see a picture of the man who saved his grandkid.”

“Of course, Luke, I would absolutely love that,” Thomas Devlin replied, breaking into a smile.
