We met where all cursed love stories start: modding a horror subreddit.

The sub was called r/hometapeshorror—small, niche, focused on analog horror, lost media, and old VHS tapes people claimed they “found in the woods” or in boxes labeled DO NOT WATCH. Most were fake, but the effort behind them? Impressive. We’d sticky the best ones, ban low-effort “creepypasta LARPs,” and message each other long into the night about the videos that actually felt wrong.

That’s how I got to know Zara.

Her username was @CallHer.Zara. She lived in Boston. Graphic designer and writer. Obsessed with glitch effects and typography. She always had this way of writing that felt… offbeat. Her messages were full of parentheses and em dashes and late-night thoughts that lingered too long. She’d send me short videos—her walking through snow, her hands shaking as she filmed flickering streetlights. Nothing performative. Just raw.

I live in Asheville. We never met in person. But it didn’t matter.

We talked every day. Texted before bed. She sent me voice memos and videos when she couldn’t sleep—softly whispering about dreams she’d had where faces were smooth like porcelain or people only existed when being watched. Sometimes we FaceTimed. She always kept her room dark, lit only by the blue light of her screen.

The connection felt real. So real I started making plans. Looking up flights. She even joked she’d move south if she could find a job that didn’t chain her to a Boston office.

Then, without warning, she vanished.

No goodbye. No explanation. Just silence.

I thought maybe something had happened—an accident, a family emergency. But her Reddit account was gone. Deleted. Same with her Discord. Every photo she’d sent me disappeared from my phone. Even our saved chats were empty. Just blank message bubbles with no text.

I tried to retrace her online presence. But there was nothing. No LinkedIn. No Instagram. No cached posts. It was like I’d been texting a ghost.

I still had one thing left: a backup folder. I’d saved a few of her videos there. One was my favorite—just her walking past an old church at night, humming some off-key lullaby.

When I opened it…

It wasn’t her.

It was me.

Not filming, not reacting—just sitting. Alone. In my room. Eyes wide open. Blank. Staring at the camera like I’d been caught mid-blink.

The file metadata said it had been recorded three days ago.

At 3:03 a.m.

I don’t remember that.

⸻

I didn’t sleep for days. I became obsessed with proving she was real.

I texted an old coworker she’d once mentioned. He didn’t know who I was talking about. I even emailed the subreddit admins asking if they could restore old mod logs. They said there was no record of a mod named CallHer.Zara.

I posted on r/AskReddit. Just a simple question: “Anyone remember a user named callher.zara?”

The post vanished in seconds. Not removed—just gone.

The next day, I woke up to a package on my doorstep. No address. No stamp.

Inside was a VHS tape labeled “CUT 23.”

I don’t own a VHS player. But my neighbor does. She’s this older woman who runs estate sales. I asked if we could use hers. She said sure, then offered to watch with me.

She didn’t last long.

The footage was black and white. Shaky. Filmed inside a dim room. The only light was a flickering CRT TV in the corner. The tape zoomed slowly toward the screen—where someone, me or someone like me, was sitting in a chair. Still. Unblinking.

Zara’s voice played over it. Barely a whisper.

“He wears your face until you forget what it looked like.”

The image flickered. A new face appeared—mine, again, but… wrong. Skin too smooth. Eyes too big. Smiling like he didn’t understand what smiling meant.

My neighbor shut off the tape. She was pale.

“That’s not you,” she said.

⸻

I started reading about Capgras syndrome. A rare disorder where people believe someone close to them has been replaced by an imposter. But the more I read, the more I wondered—

What if it works in reverse?

What if your mind replaces someone who never existed?

What if your brain creates a person-shaped placeholder just to fill the loneliness?

I went to a psychiatrist. I told him everything.

He nodded too slowly. His voice was calm, rehearsed. He told me what I wanted to hear:

That trauma can invent memories.

That love and grief can play dress-up in your head.

That “Zara” might’ve been a delusion born out of isolation, screen addiction, parasocial hunger.

I asked if hallucinations can leave physical evidence. He asked what I meant.

I showed him the VHS.

He smiled too wide.

“You’re almost rendered,” he said.

And then his face twitched—just slightly, like a corrupted video buffer.

⸻

That night, I found a folder on my desktop I didn’t create.

Inside: over a hundred stills. From different angles. All of them of me.

Sitting. Sleeping. Typing. All from webcam angles.

In the last one, I’m not alone.

Someone is behind me, touching my shoulder.

She has Zara’s smile.

And my eyes.

Update:

I logged into Reddit this morning. There’s a new subreddit in my list.

r/hometapeshorror23

It only has one post.

A live stream.

Of me.

Typing this.
