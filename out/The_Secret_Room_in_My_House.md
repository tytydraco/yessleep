Alright, my name is Alex. I’m currently living in a two-story house. I moved out to the countryside about two weeks ago. It’s been a dream come true, I used to be in an apartment. One night I was scrolling through this real estate listing website when I saw this listing for a two-story house for less than $50,000. I knew I had to jump on the opportunity. It was a long drive, but well worth it. I arrived and was stunned, the house looked to be in pristine condition. I unlocked the front door and stepped inside. The air was musty and stale as if no one had been there for a while. I shrugged it off. I didn’t find it too much of a problem, nothing that some air freshener couldn’t fix. I started unpacking all of my stuff when I first noticed a strange presence. I started looking around, just to confirm I wasn’t losing my mind. I went upstairs and didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. I continued my search until I reached the basement door. I placed my hand on the door handle but was suddenly overwhelmed with dread. I immediately took my hand off the doorknob. I decided that I wouldn’t go down there until I needed to, at least that’s what thought jumped to mind as I backed away.

I went back to unpacking my stuff, it took me a good 4, maybe 5 hours to completely have all my stuff packed away. I was exhausted, so I walked up the stairs to the master bedroom. Collapsing on the bed immediately. It felt amazing like I could sleep forever. It only took me about 5-10 minutes before I fell asleep, however. I didn’t stay asleep for too long. It was about 2 hours later that I awoke at midnight on the dot. A strange noise invaded my ears, someone was stomping downstairs. I was taken aback, I slowly stood up, trying not to make much noise as I reached for a nearby bat, I had stashed next to the bed. I got up and made my way to the door, reaching out towards the knob. It seemed right as I touched the doorknob to exit the room, all noises ceased to exist. I had thought I had gone deaf because of the true lack of any noise. I couldn’t even hear my breathing, but perhaps I was holding my breath. I opened the door and walked down the stairs. Everything was still quiet, with the exception now of my ragged breaths. I reached the bottom of the stairs and flicked on the lights, raising my bat high. I was expecting to see someone crouched down but instead was met with nothing.

&#x200B;

I lowered the bat after taking a thorough look around the bottom floor, making sure I had locked all the doors and windows. Ensuring everything was locked tight, I froze when I turned to see the basement door ajar. I must’ve stayed still for what felt like hours but in reality, it was only a couple of minutes. I silently walked forward, once more holding my breath as I quickly shut the door. I could’ve sworn that the door was shut when I had first looked around. I started catching my breath, I was mentally and physically exhausted from what had occurred. I made my way back up the stairs and entered the bedroom. I placed the bat next to the headboard as I collapsed on the bed, unable to sleep for the rest of the night. Daylight began to take hold of the sky when I finally decided I should get up, no way I was catching any more sleep this night. I went downstairs and began making myself a pot of coffee. I ran through the night in my head once more, I couldn’t shake the fact that the door had been opened slightly. I kept glancing over at the basement door. It was a truly eerie feeling I was getting from that damn door.

Finishing my coffee, I washed the cup and grabbed my keys from a nearby rack, and left to head to town to the market. Oddly enough I only purchased some coffee for myself the previous day before arriving. The scenery outside was spectacular, the house was surrounded by dense woods with a driveway that was nearly a mile long leading to the main road. I never really understood why people loved living out in the countryside, but it didn’t take too much to convince me. This was the best option for me. I could finally focus on saving money and bettering myself. I arrived at the closest market, waking inside I was met with an employee greeting me. “How’re you doing today, sir?” the employee asked. “I’m doing relatively well, thank you,” I replied, walking past the checkout counter after grabbing a shopping cart. I walked to some coolers nearby, taking a couple of packs of eggs and bacon. I placed them in my cart, heading down another aisle. I finished picking up my food items when the smell crossed my mind, reminding me that I needed to grab some air fresheners. I grabbed a few of them and walked back up toward the checkout area. I paid for my items and walked outside, carrying everything.

&#x200B;

Placing the items in my car, I hopped in the driver's seat. I began the journey back home once more. It was around midday now. It took time to get back and forth in this town. I reached the house and was getting out of my car when I took a look over at the first-floor window. I freaked out when I saw what looked like a face staring at me. I was terrified, and with a sudden rage filling me, I rushed to the door. Unlocking it, I flung it open. I looked around with confusion as nobody was there. “Damn mind!” I exclaimed out loud. Must’ve been from the lack of sleep, I thought. I walked back to my car, gathering what groceries I had purchased. I shut the door, locking my car before I turned to walk back inside. I stepped inside and the stench was much more noticeable. I immediately took the package of air fresheners out and plugged them into the wall outlets lining the first floor. I saved the biggest one for the upstairs bedroom. I placed the groceries in the fridge and put any remaining in the pantry. I cooked a meal and ate alone in the downstairs kitchen. I was watching TV when I heard a noise coming from a few feet away. I felt a strong feeling of dread.

&#x200B;

I walked towards the basement door, instinctually I knew the presence was coming from there. Upon reaching the door, I had a strange feeling of tranquility. I opened the door and walked down the stairs slowly. The tranquil feeling dissipated as I reached the bottom step. It was pitch black. I couldn’t see anything, I felt around in the darkness for a light switch, but none could be found. I walked back up the stairs, realizing I’d need to use my phone for a flashlight. I grabbed my phone off the table and began to walk back. On the last step of the stairs, I turned on my flashlight. I saw a strange door on the far left wall, I slowly walked up to it and opened it. I was met with a disturbing sight. All on the ground were carvings of pentagrams. The writing on the walls depicts a man with a goat’s head. I was frozen, I felt like I was paralyzed. I heard the door slam behind me. I started panicking, I rushed over to the door and began kicking it with all of my might. From the darkness behind me, I felt something place its hand on my shoulder, whispering in my ear “No escape now.” a voice said with a low and guttural pitch.

&#x200B;

The blood running through my veins was cold, and I felt a sense of impending doom looming over me. I slowly turned to see a pair of red, malevolent glowing eyes staring into my soul. The pentagrams below me began to light up, an immense red light painted the walls with its scarlet hues. I felt a symbol engraved on my chest. In one instant, the lights returned to normal, the grip on my shoulder eased and the door opened up with a sickening bang against the wall. I rushed upstairs, slamming the basement door shut. I ran to my bathroom, inspecting the symbol plastered across my chest. It was an upside-down cross inside of a pentagram. The burning sensation never eased. I’m posting this now because I cannot shake the feeling of being watched. I’m constantly in fear of being attacked and I feel tonight may be the night it comes to take me. I’ve been up for the past two hours writing this; I can’t shake that looming doom feeling. The symbol on my chest has been burning bright red for the past 30 minutes. I’m afraid by the time someone views this, I’ll no longer be of this world. If there is one thing you can take away from this if you find yourself having a weird feeling outside of a house that seemed too good to be true deal. Please just walk away.
