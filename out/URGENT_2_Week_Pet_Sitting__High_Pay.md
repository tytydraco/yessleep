For five years, I’ve been a professional pet sitter, a job that was once my passion. I’m Rover-certified, insured, and I have a 5-star rating that I guard with my life. Usually, the job is simple: walk a Golden Retriever with separation anxiety, or care for a cat that glares at me like I’m a war criminal. The weirdest pet I handled before was a Green Iguana named 'Godzilla', who had a fondness for being hand-fed raspberries.

Then, I got a message from Arthur. The subject line was deceptively ordinary:

URGENT: 2 Week Pet Sitting - High Pay. 

The house was a sleek, modern glass box overlooking the ocean. The duration was fourteen days. But when I replied asking about the animal, the response made me physically recoil.

“They are a colony of Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches. About fifty of them. They are low maintenance. I need someone to ensure humidity levels are kept stable.”

My finger hovered over the delete button. Hell no. I don't do bugs. I barely do spiders.

Then the follow-up message came through.

“Compensation is 10,000 dollars upfront.”

I stared at the screen. My student loans were drowning me, and my car was making a noise that sounded like a dying seal. Ten grand for watching bugs in a glass box? I couldn't turn that down.

I showed up at the house the next day. It was sterile, smelling faintly of bleach and lemon. Arthur opened the door, and the first thing I noticed was his eyes. They were a violent, bloodshot red, sunken deep into dark purple sockets. He looked like a man who hadn’t slept in a month. He scratched the back of his neck furiously, his fingernails digging into raw, red skin.

"Thank you for coming," he said, his voice raspy. He winced, gritted his teeth, and offered me a trembling hand. He led me to the living room. On the coffee table sat a massive, heavy-duty glass terrarium. Inside, a dark, shifting mound of black and brown carapaces moved sluggishly. There weren’t too many of them, maybe forty or fifty large ones.

"Humidity at 80%. I have fresh vegetables and oats set aside for them," Arthur said, rushing through the instructions as if he were holding his breath. He handed me a heavy brass key.

"Feed them every hour. Make sure to. And never leave them alone," he said before clenching teeth as his nails dug into his hand. He let out a long, shuddering sigh of relief. "Take good care of them."

And then, he practically ran out the door.

I locked up behind him and turned to the tank. I leaned in close. They were grotesque, their armored backs shining under the heat lamp. I checked the lid. It was heavy mesh with industrial clamps. It was shut tight. 

I crouched down and pulled open the cabinet doors beneath the tank stand. The shelves were stacked with gallon-sized Ziploc bags, each one stuffed with freshly chopped kale. Next to them were various frantic hand written notes. I grabbed the nearest bag and popped it open.

"Easy money," I whispered to myself.

I fed the roaches a handful of kale. My face wrenched at them as they fed. They scuttled over one another, hissing and snapping, fighting for the chunks of green. I glanced at Arthur's scribbled notes. Feed every hour. That sounded like overkill. A quick Google search confirmed that most of these colonies only needed food a few times a week.

"You guys can wait," I muttered. I wasn't about to be a butler to a box of bugs.

I finished up and headed to the guest bedroom. Arthur’s bed was absurdly comfortable, but the house was dead silent. Too silent. The quiet felt heavy, like it was pressing against my eardrums. I took out my phone, the blue light washed over my face as I doom-scrolled Reddit for about an hour.

Eventually, my eyes grew heavy. I put my phone on the nightstand and drifted off. 

A few minutes later, my eyes snapped open.

Scritch. Scratch.

It was coming from inside the walls. At first, I tried to ignore it, telling myself it was just the house settling or maybe a mouse. But it got louder. It sounded like thousands of tiny, dry legs rasping against the drywall.

I sat up, heart pounding, and turned my gaze toward the noise.

Instantly, it stopped.

I waited. Silence. I lay back down.

Scritch.

The night was unnerving. As the hours dragged on, the air in the room began to thicken. A smell drifted in from the hallway. It was pungent and earthy, like wet mud mixed with something sweet and sickly, like rotting flesh. The scuffling started again, weaving in and out of my dreams. Somehow, I managed to pass out from pure exhaustion, but it wasn't a peaceful rest.

I woke up feeling like I hadn't slept at all. My head pounded. I dragged myself out of bed and walked into the kitchen to make coffee, desperate for caffeine.

While the machine brewed, I glanced at the living room. The terrarium looked... darker. Fuller.
I frowned and walked over. The mound of bugs seemed to have doubled in volume. They were pressed against the glass, their antennae twitching frantically. Maybe they just woke up, I thought. Maybe they puff up or something.

I turned back to the kitchen and froze. There was a roach on the marble countertop. It was huge, the size of my thumb. I yelped, grabbing a paper towel. I crushed it, feeling it crunch underneath my finger, and threw it in the trash. My heart was hammering. I ran back to the tank. The clamps were still locked down tight. The mesh was intact.

"How the hell did you get out?" I muttered.

I reached for the bag of vegetables to feed them, but my hand stopped halfway. My stomach curdled at the sight of them, they were pressed tight against the glass, their tiny legs scrabbling against it. I couldn’t open that lid. Not now. I felt like if I even cracked it an inch, they’d spill out through the mesh like an ocean. I turned away, desperately looking for a distraction. 

I opened the cupboard above the stove. It was nearly empty, save for a box of generic, store brand bran flakes. It wasn’t my taste but it would do. I ripped the cardboard tab open.

Dozens of small roaches were scrambling inside the box, climbing up towards the rim. I jumped in shock and reflectively hurled the box across the room. It slammed against the refrigerator, showering the floor with stale flakes. Just stale flakes.

Was I going mad?

The sight was still vivid in my mind, I couldn’t have just imagined it. My appetite had vanished. I didn’t want to be near the terrarium for the time being. I went about my day, headphones in, trying to pretend it didn’t exist. 

But by evening, the situation had spiraled into madness. 

I was sitting on the couch when I heard a sound. Like rain falling on dry leaves. Skitter. Click. Hiss. I looked down. A pool of roaches was spreading out from the base of the terrarium stand. It defied physics. There was no way that many bugs could fit in the tank, let alone squeeze through a locked lid. The black puddle grew, expanding across the white rug, moving toward my feet.

Panic, cold and sharp, seized my chest. I scrambled onto the couch.

"This isn't real," I gasped. The floor was disappearing under a carpet of black shells.
I fumbled for my phone. I needed proof. I needed to send this to Arthur or animal control or someone. I snapped a photo of the living room, my hands shaking so hard I almost dropped the device.

I looked at the screen to check the picture.

The floor was empty.

In the photo, the white rug was pristine. The terrarium sat quietly on the table. There were no roaches.

I looked up from the screen. They were climbing the legs of the couch. I screamed. I dropped my phone and sprinted for the bedroom. I slammed the door. Then shoved a chair under the handle, and stuffed a towel into the crack at the bottom. I sat on the bed with my knees to my chest, hyperventilating.

I was losing my grip on reality. I thought it could be carbon monoxide poisoning. Or stress. It just couldn't be real. I curled up under the duvet, praying that if I just slept, my brain would reset.

I was shaken awake by an unnerving sensation.

I felt a tickle at first, then it became a light frantic movement. On me. I threw the covers off and stood up, slapping at my arms. A roach fell from my elbow to the floor. Another fell from my hair.

But the tickling didn't stop.

It was deeper.

I felt a flutter beneath the skin of my forearm.

I stumbled into the bathroom, flicking on the harsh fluorescent lights. I looked in the mirror and screamed. My face was pale, but my eyes... my eyes were beginning to turn red.

I felt a sudden, violent heave in my stomach. I fell to my knees in front of the toilet and retched.

It wasn't bile that came up.

Three large, wet, hissing cockroaches splashed into the toilet bowl. They began to paddle frantically in the water.

My hands fell onto the sides of the toilet. I grasped for air. My throat still felt clogged. I looked down at my bare arms. Distinct oval outlines rippled through my skin... crawling through the muscle, tunneling under the epidermis, fighting for space.

It felt like a fire was lit beneath my skin.

I scratched viciously. My nails tore into my forearms, desperate to get them out, but that only made them burrow deeper. I rushed back to the bedroom and grabbed my phone. I dialed Arthur. It rang for a few seconds.

"Hello?" His voice was clear. Well rested.

"You have to come back!" I screamed, my voice breaking as I felt something crawl up the back of my neck, just under the hairline. "I can't do this! I'm sick! Something is wrong with your pets! They're inside me!"

There was a pause on the line. I heard him take a deep, luxurious breath.

"They’re yours now," he said, his voice low with ice.

Click.

The line went dead. I dropped the phone and raised my hands to my neck, digging my nails in, and began to scratch. I drew blood, but the sensation of a thousand tiny legs churning beneath my dermis only intensified. I fell to my knees, sobbing, my vision blurring as the room seemed to fill with the chittering sound of the colony.

Then, through the haze of pain, a memory snapped into focus. Arthur's raspy, frantic voice: “Feed them every hour.”

I had ignored it. I had thought I knew better.

I scrambled up from the floor, gasping for air. I rushed toward the living room, wading through the sea of black bodies that covered the floor. They crunched under my bare feet, slippery and sharp, but I ignored the revulsion. I ignored the excruciating fire in my veins.

I grabbed the bag of kale from the counter and threw myself at the terrarium. The glass was vibrating.
With a scream of effort, I unlatched the clamps and ripped the mesh lid open. I didn't care if they swarmed me. I didn't care if they bit. I tore the kale into jagged chunks and hurled them into the mass of writhing shells.

"Eat!" I shrieked. "Eat it!"

The frantic hissing stopped. The colony turned as one, descending upon the greenery with terrifying violence. As they viciously ripped the leaves to shreds, the fire under my skin began to calm.

I watched as the last piece of kale disappeared beneath the swarm.

I blinked.

The room was silent. The floor was pristine white. The air smelled of lemon and bleach, not rot. I looked into the tank. There were no longer thousands of them. Just fifty or so large, sluggish cockroaches, munching quietly on their meal.

I collapsed onto the couch, watching them.

My phone alarm went off exactly fifty-nine minutes later.

I got up and fed them.

I stayed up the entire night, a slave to the second hand. Feed. Wait. Feed. Wait. It worked. As long as their hunger was satiated, they stayed in the box. By the time the sun rose, casting a beautiful orange light over the ocean view I couldn't enjoy, I realized the truth.

I looked at my reflection in the dark glass of the terrarium. My eyes were red. My skin was raw. I was exhausted.

Is this my life now? A prisoner to a glass box? I can’t live like this. I can’t live in fear of the swarm returning. I need to sleep for more than forty-five minutes at a time. And worse… I can't imagine what will happen if I leave them alone.

I grabbed my phone. My fingers hovered over the keys for a moment, trembling, before I began to type.

URGENT: 2 Week Pet Sitting - High Pay.

I hit post. Now, I just have to wait for someone who needs the money as badly as I did.
