 

Hello, I am a 16-year-old female and just had something happen ok so me and my friend lets say her name is Maddy (Not her real name) me and her were at her grandparent's house to hang out like usual because they have a nice property in the woods-ish area that has a great view of lake superior. We usually go swimming in the summer and its a lot of fun but one night we were outside and we both have this uneasy feeling but we brushed it off because it's late and pitch black out because. it was around 11:30-ish she has a swing set in the lawn that points towards the lake and there are woods behind us. We herd something in the woods behind us but that's normal because there are a family of rabbits that live around the area. so then we got up from the swings and laid in the grass and watched the stars. A few minutes went by and she gets up and runs down the hill towards the lake to the back of the house.

So I think she is going to scare me like she likes to do so I go to the front of the house to meet her have way there, but she calls me so I start heading down to see what's up. Then she looks scared and points to the sky. So I look and see what looks like sort of a flying train in the sky its hard to explain but it was just lights and it started to get closer to us. We tried to film but it didn't show up on the camera. Then I see Maddy was just staring at it and wasn't responding to me. But the thing in the sky didn't make any sound at all I was trying to get her to go inside with my but she was in this trance sort of state but I finally got her to listen to me when it was about a few hundred yards away we went inside and got her uncle and grandpa and Maddy's uncle seen it when it was almost gone.

A few minutes later we were still outside and we seen a black van go down the road following it then when it was gone they left. A little while later me and Maddy went down the road to try to find it but we couldn't see it but i saw something in the woods but didn't tell her because i didn't want her to freek out and it knowing i seen it i just said that the thing in the sky was gone and we should head back so we went back home. I still haven't told her yet and I'm not planning to, but something even more creepy is she doesn't remember it getting closer to us or me trying to get her to go inside. But i can never forget what i saw in the woods i still have nightmares till this day it was a tall pale skinned creature it wasn't quite human but still looked like one it had long arms but short legs and it just had this grin on its face it had no eyes or nose but a smile that i will never forget.

Should i tell Maddy or should i keep it to myself? I'm not sure what to do if i should keep it to myself or not i still get afraid to go out at night alone there. But once after we were outside at night on the porch and she saw something. A pale skinny creature in the grass crouched down. I know it's still out there. What should I do should I tell her or not?
