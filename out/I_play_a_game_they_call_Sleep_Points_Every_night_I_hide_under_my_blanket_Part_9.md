I had always been generally uneasy towards Ezra.  He wasn’t the kind of guy you could really be friends with.  Since he always hated everyone, he never seemed to like anybody enough to want friends.  But after he tried to ram into me with his car the night before and only narrowly missed, I began to realize how deep his hatred for his fellow human beings truly was.  I knew he always made jokes about killing people and doing a school shooting and stuff.  But making jokes and making an honest to god attempt at someone’s life are two very, VERY different things.

I had church with him on Sunday.  I was absolutely mortified by the prospect.  Would I even make it out alive?  Even if I did, just having to spend three hours with my would-be killer was already going to be traumatic enough.  I also couldn’t stop thinking of what he said to me after he broke into my goddamn room.  “You’ll wish that killed you”.  I mean what the fuck?  Was hitting me with a car his sick, twisted idea of doing me a favor somehow?  Whatever the case, there was one thing I now knew for sure now:  Ezra knew I was playing sleep points.  Why the hell else would he have said something like that?  But then again, he can absolutely be completely irrational and unpredictable like that.  He isn’t exactly what you could call “stable”. 

 But still, too much about last night and how he played into it supported the idea that he knew for a fact that I was playing sleep points.  I started to wonder if he had always known.  Right from the beginning.  Maybe it had started with that chuckle I saw him give himself when he made eye contact with me on my walk almost two weeks ago by that point, right when I had just started playing.  Maybe it started with that.  And then progressed to the note in my locker.  And then progressed to literally trying to kill me.  So, yeah, that escalated quickly.  

I immediately went downstairs and locked the door from the hallway to the garage.  I went outside one more time, to close the garage from the outside too, just while I was at it, since I figured mom and dad would notice if it was open.  I also left Dad’s car keys on the kitchen table where he usually left them.  So, when he doesn’t have to go looking for them the next time he goes out driving, he’ll have me to thank.  

After last night’s brush with death, I was officially done with the driving plan.  I was going to walk over to Anastasia’s house tomorrow night, and I didn’t care how many toes I lost in the process.  It’d be preferable to risking getting hit by Ezra with a car again and losing my entire life.  He had to know I was playing Sleep Points.  There was no other explanation for why I almost literally ran into him.  And if he knew that, then knowing him, it would only stand to reason that he’d go out of his way to make sure I lost the game and wound up as The Sandman’s next meal. 

I started thinking:  if he honestly did think that he would’ve been doing me a favor by killing me, maybe he let me live on purpose.  Think about it: if I had been hit by his car, I wouldn’t have lost Sleep Points.  I would’ve been too dead to lose by then.  Maybe he wanted me to come out of it alive, but also fearing for my life.  Maybe he wanted to do anything that would make it as difficult as possible to go to sleep at night now that I would have to fall asleep within a particular timeframe.  And after seeing him randomly show up in my room, waiting for me after I had finally gotten home, on top of everything else, I think he had officially achieved that.  Stage Two hadn’t even started, and I still found sleep to be impossible to come by after what a night I had just had.  I would have so rathered another night hiding under my blanket from The Sandman.  What I had just went through made that prospect look like nothing.

By the time I was through with everything downstairs, I headed back up to my room and checked the time.  It was already 5:30 AM.  Even though it was still dark out, I decided to just stay up the rest of the night and then through the day.  I had thought about what Anastasia had said about how I couldn’t break the clock, because then I’d never sleep again.  I remembered that she hadn’t said anything about just taking the clock out of my room and then leaving it somewhere where it wouldn’t give me trouble.

I had a pretty good feeling that that wasn’t seriously about to work.  If it were that easy, surely somebody as smart as Anastasia would’ve come up with by now and told me about it.  But I still decided it was worth a shot.  After all, I was honestly curious and just kinda wanted to see what would happen.  I started by picking the clock up.  Although, even just doing this gave me bad feeling.  I wasn’t entirely certain if I could even touch the thing without making something terrible happen.  But nothing happened.  Or at least nothing happened so far as I could tell.  But I figured that was promising enough.  I picked up the clock and took it downstairs, where I unlocked the garage door and left it right there, making sure I didn’t forget to relock it once the job was done.

All things considered, it really did start to seem like it could’ve been that easy all along.  I almost started feeling stupid for taking so long to come up with it.  I walked up the stairs, opened my door, but instead of the clock being gone, it was right there, sitting on my nightstand, as usual, despite the fact that I had just set it down in the garage.  But then I started to think that maybe that made sense.  After all, this clock came into my life by spontaneously appearing on my nightstand.  If it could randomly show up there once, maybe it made sense that it could just do it all over again any time I tried to get rid of it.

It started snowing again when the sun started rising at about 7:30, so whatever I missed of the truck’s tracks through the driveway would hopefully be covered up, and luckily enough, it pretty much was.  Mom and Dad never said anything about tracks in their driveway, so I figured I was all good.  I might not have even needed to bother with covering up the truck tracks at all.  Dad would probably just assume he had made them, even though the last time he or mom left the house, the driveway was completely clear.  But I doubt he would’ve remembered.

I pretty much stayed in bed all day.  I was too tired from the night before, given that I hadn’t slept at all, to get up and do much of anything.  Plus, there was the fact that I was going back to Anastasia’s house again that night and would need to save up my energy because even though I could drive, the possibility of having a repeat of last night was much too dangerous.  I would have to walk.  And that wasn’t gonna be easy.  The forecast predicted tonight to dip down to under 10 degrees Fahrenheit which was gonna absolutely suck to walk in.  But at least there wouldn’t be any snow.  There was a 100% chance of clear skies by nightfall and throughout the rest of the night.  So at least I wouldn’t have to worry about that.  Although, I would of course still have to deal with the snow from last night and the snow that came down during the day, since none of that was showing any sign of melting any time soon.

Now that Stage Two was coming up, I had to spend a lot of my time thinking about how I was gonna get myself to sleep.  Apparently, it was going to be insanely difficult once it started.  I wasn’t quite sure what to do.  Maybe I’d have a glass of warm milk before bed on Monday night.  Maybe I’d go for another walk to tire myself out.  None of those ideas seemed very promising.  But they were the best I had.  I would definitely need to see Anastasia that night.  She would have to have some idea of what I should be doing to put myself to sleep, once the insomnia of Stage Two started to set in.

But Stage Two was almost exciting because instead of getting 10 Sleep Points in one night, I’d now be getting 20.  But that just raised another question.  A question I had meant to ask Anastasia during our last meeting, but couldn’t because of how quickly she rushed me out: What did these points even mean?  These points still felt like meaningless numbers to me.  What did I even get from them?  How could I interact with Sleep Points in order to make use of them?  Sleep Points, as an app, still just felt like a virus that was stuck on my phone, draining its battery, and that you couldn’t really do anything with.

I had remembered thinking to myself if I would get something when I reached 100.  Well, I had already done that on Thursday, and the game didn’t magically give me anything.  It didn’t give me any options regarding what I could do with my Sleep Points.  Sleep Points were the whole point of Sleep Points.  Why else would Anastasia call it that?  And yet I couldn’t seem to do anything at all with them.  What good were they, anyway?

I made sure to keep these questions in mind so that I wouldn’t let what limited time I could expect to spend with Anastasia slip away from me.  If that night was gonna be anything like the previous one, I would only have about 45 minutes to work with.  I was going to ask her point blank what I could do with these points.    
Even though I didn’t quite get caught, I did still end up coming close.  Remember what I said about how if my dad found his keys, he’d have me to thank?  Well, he found his keys.  Right there on the kitchen table where I left them.  Except apparently, he had been looking for those keys the night before and had already checked there and hadn’t seen them.  

At that moment, I thought he would have finally figured me out.  But I guess seeing his keys there didn’t immediately make him suspect me.  He did think it was pretty weird, though.  Fortunately, the idea of his son taking the keys from where he had originally left them, wherever that might have been, and using them to steal his car, wasn’t the first idea he had in mind when he saw the keys at the kitchen table when they hadn’t been there before.  He just figured he must’ve missed them somehow.

But still, I couldn’t let something like this happen again.  I couldn’t accidently leave his keys in a place where he knew they wouldn’t be.  Or at least not too frequently.  He didn’t bother investigating the mystery this time around, though if this happened enough, he might just start to.  And that would be insanely bad news for me.  This was yet another reason to abandon the plan of using my dad’s truck as Anastasia had suggested.  

Speaking of, soon enough nightfall came around and it was going to be time once again to sneak out of the house.  This time I would make sure to lock all the doors behind me.  Though of course, in order to get back into the house, I still had to take my father’s keys with me anyway.  But that was fine.  I only had to take his house keys.  He really had last left his house keys up on the kitchen table  So, I’d take his keys and then in the morning when he sees them there, he’d think nothing of it.  

I got bundled up in as many layers as I could find since I had a long walk ahead of me.  Technically, I had two long walks ahead of me: one on the way up, and then another on the way back.  Then, I got my flashlight and started heading out of the house.  I went out through the front door since it made less noise than the garage door.  And I needed to be quiet because I would need to leave early.  My parents might not have been asleep just yet.  

On the previous night, I left around 12:45 and still made pretty decent time.  But now that I would be walking, and through snow, no less, that was gonna pretty seriously slow me down.  Well, maybe not that seriously.  After all, I did have to drive really slowly the previous night.  But it was still a decent amount faster than walking.  I was driving at a speed of maybe 5 or 10 miles an hour.  Maybe I could run that fast, but I absolutely did not have the stamina to keep up that pace through the snow for 2 and a half miles.

Fortunately, now that I had made the trip once, I felt relatively confident that I knew where I was going.  Now it was just a matter of making the tiring trip there on foot.  I really didn’t feel like doing it, but I knew I had to or else I’d have no gameplan for tackling Stage Two.  There had to be some kind of strategy when it comes to falling asleep.  Some kind of fool-proof method that let Anastasia go to sleep in so little time.  Just like how she must’ve done it right after the last time I had seen her, right after she had rushed me out.  I didn’t know what it was, but she had to have had some kind of trick up her sleeve, and whatever it was, I was gonna need it.

I left at midnight and decided I’d walk on the roads the whole way, instead of going for a straight shot like what I was thinking of doing last night.  That way, I’d still have street signs to tell me where I was going, since I wanted to be absolutely certain that I wouldn’t get lost again.  This would of course, add an extra mile and a half to my trip.  Now that I was taking the roads, I’d need to do 4 miles of walking, instead of the 2 and half I would’ve done if I were walking straight and not bothering to follow the roads.  But that still shouldn’t have been a problem.  At least not time-wise.  I still had two hours to work with, so I’d only need to walk 2 miles an hour, which felt doable enough.  I could still take my time and didn’t need to haul ass or anything.

The only real problem was having to be outside in the insane cold for 2 hours.  It really was pretty insanely cold.  I know here in Alaska, it can definitely get much colder, but any time that happens, I’m always inside and never go out for more than a couple of minutes, if even that.  And this was gonna be hours.  I wanted to die.  And on top of everything else, just to make matters even worse, a few minutes after my first turn, I had a problem:  my flashlight died.  I could still feel the ground underneath my feet, so I would still know where I was going.  But the darkness certainly made the trip a lot more unsettling than it needed to be.  If something unexpected showed up on my way there or back, I wouldn’t be able to see it.

And by “something unexpected”, I was of course thinking of Ezra.  Thankfully, since it was such a clear and dark night, the aurora were out once again, so I did at least have the somewhat eerie glow of those green lights in the sky to guide me and light up the night a little.  They didn’t really light up the ground very much, but I could at least use the lights themselves as something of a navigational tool.  If I took notice of the patterns they made and then rotated them around in my head a little, I could get a decent idea of which direction I was going in.  Anyway, with my flashlight being dead, it was also just nice to have some kind of light source to stop me from feeling completely trapped in darkness.

I did have to keep a constant eye on those lights though.  The pattern they make in the sky could always change at a moment’s notice, even if they didn’t typically, so I wanted to make sure I kept track of the streaks in the sky in case they changed all of the sudden and tricked me into thinking I had made a wrong turn somewhere.  That was unlikely to happen since the pattern in the sky would have to rotate itself by about 90 degrees while I wasn’t looking.  But still, I wanted to be completely certain that I knew what I was supposed to see in the sky if I had made a left turn, or a right turn, or had continued on straight.  What helped me relax though, was the fact that I had already passed the first turn by the time my flashlight had died.  That meant all I really needed to do at that point was just follow the road, since there weren’t gonna be any more forks in it from then on.

Eventually I had made it to her street.  I couldn’t check the addresses again since I didn’t have a functioning flashlight.  But I didn’t need to.  I remembered that she was the third house down the street.  I checked the time.  My College High watch had a glow-in-the-dark feature that I could control with a button on its side.  Y’know.  Instead of just lighting up on its own and coming for my life, like certain other clocks that shall go unmentioned.

It was actually pretty early.  I guess had overshot how early I needed to leave.  But still, better to err on the side of too early rather than too late.  It was only about 1:40. I still had 25 minutes to kill.  I thought about taking a walk down the street, but I didn’t want to risk losing Anastasia’s house.  Although, I had started to think that maybe I wouldn’t even need to worry about that.  After all, maybe I’d still be able to see the red glow of her clock from the side of her house once 2 AM started getting close, just like what had happened the previous night.  That should’ve been pretty hard to miss.

I went up to her house to see if she had her curtains closed:  she did.  I wouldn’t be able to see inside her room.  Not that I was in much of a mood to do that.  I had already seen enough the night before.  But still, I had checked anyway because having her curtains closed made going for a walk a bit more complicated.  Maybe the glow would still travel through the curtains, but even if it did, it probably wouldn’t be bright enough to serve as a landmark. 

Since I couldn’t think of anything better to do, I just headed over to Anastasia’s backyard, near her backdoor, and just kinda chilled back there and waited.  While I waited, I paced around a bit, just to give my legs something to do.  After about 10 or 15 minutes of that, I stepped in something liquid-y and chunky.  It felt like puke.  I knelt down and turned my watch’s light on to give myself a better look at what it was.  As I got closer, the pungent smell of vomit started getting stronger, to the point where I almost felt like I might just start blowing chunks myself.  It was puke all right.   I immediately backed away and made a point to avoid walking around that patch of Anastasia’s yard.

Why would somebody throw up in a backyard of all places?  That just made no sense to me.  Maybe Anastasia had just thrown up in her own backyard.  But still, why would she have done that?  Regardless of who threw up in her backyard, whether it was someone else or Anastasia herself, either way it just made no sense.  What person does something so nonsensical?  Oh wait.  Don’t tell me.  
The only halfway rational explanation I could come up with was that this was clearly just another one of Ezra’s insane practical jokes.  Which was uncanny in its own right.  If this really was Ezra’s doing, he would’ve had to have known Anastasia’s address too, just like how he apparently knew mine.  But still, it was one thing for him to know my address.  He lived in my neighborhood, so mine should’ve been a lot easier to figure out than Anastasia’s.  

I know she’s only a few miles away from there, but still.  She lives in an entirely separate neighborhood from us.  On top of that, she doesn’t even go to church with us, so it’s not like his parents know hers the way they know mine.  Since his parents know mine, his parents probably know my address.  After all, it isn’t that unreasonable to think my parents would’ve given them that info so that way the Livingstons could come over sometime.  They never did.  My parents were never that close to them.  But I could still totally see them having done it at some point, just to put the offer out there.  So if that was the case, it shouldn’t have been too hard for Ezra to have just asked them.  I figured that must’ve been what he did to find me.  But it still didn’t explain how he managed to find Anastasia’s place.

Ezra’s family and mine went to a protestant church and Anastasia was Eastern Orthodox, which explained why her family didn’t go to ours.  I could tell she was from the cross necklace that she would sometimes wear.  It wasn’t the standard cross that you see on necklaces all the time.  The Orthodox Church has its own design of the cross and that looked like the version of the cross that was on her necklace.

It didn’t really make sense to me how Ezra knew Anastasia was playing Sleep Points.  That must’ve been why she was the target of his disgusting vomiting-on-her-backyard stunt.   I just could not, for the life of me, figure out how he was getting this information.  What tipped him off?  I guess when it came to finding out that I was in the game, it must’ve been pretty easy.  I literally told him about the post-it note that had the app’s true name on it.  If he knew, he knew.  But that still didn’t explain how he seemed to know about Anastasia too.

Something started to happen that convinced me this wasn't normal puke though.  Y'know how I said I stepped in it?  Well, since some had gotten in my shoe, I could feel it oozing and collecting at the bottom.  At first it just felt wet, like you might expect.  But then it began to sting.  Badly.  I almost had to sit down to avoid putting pressuring on it.  

It was as if I could feel it eating away at my skin.  That couldn't have been what was happening.  But for some unknown reason, this stuff was starting to seriously burn.  The pain was nearly excruciating.  I might have lied down and writhed in it all night if Anastasia hadn't come to the door.  I quickly composed myself, acting as though whatever alien slime that now felt as though it was corroding my foot from the outside-in just wasn't even there.
