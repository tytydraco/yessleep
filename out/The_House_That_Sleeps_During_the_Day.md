I moved into the house on Marrow Lane because I was out of options. The ad said it was “perfect for night owls” and came with furniture, utilities, and rent so cheap it felt like theft. The landlord’s voice on the phone had been distant and hurried, like he was eager to be done with me. “You can move in at sunset,” he said. I asked if I could arrive earlier to look at the place, but he cut me off with a terse, “Don’t disturb it during the day.”

I laughed, thinking it was a bad joke. It wasn’t.

The house was strange the moment I saw it. The shutters were thick and bolted, the kind you’d expect during a hurricane, but there wasn’t a cloud in the sky. A faint layer of dust coated the walkway, though no footprints disturbed it—not even the landlord’s, who handed me the key with shaky hands and avoided looking at the door for too long.

“If anything… unusual happens,” he said, his voice almost a whisper, “just wait until nightfall. It’s better then.” Before I could ask what he meant, he turned and walked briskly down the driveway, never looking back.

I should have walked away right then. But I didn’t.

That first night, the house was quiet. The furniture was old but sturdy, the air faintly smelled of cedar, and the fridge was stocked with basics. It felt… normal. Safe. I chalked up the landlord’s weirdness to social awkwardness.

Around midnight, though, the first sound came: a low creak from the ceiling, like someone shifting their weight. I froze, staring up at the old wooden beams. Then it came again—soft, deliberate footsteps moving across the floorboards above me.

The thing is, I’d already checked upstairs when I moved in. It was empty. I told myself it had to be the house settling, maybe an old pipe shifting, and tried to ignore it.

But then the footsteps stopped directly above my bed.

The next day, I was too unsettled to stay inside. I went out to explore the neighborhood but noticed something odd. No one walked near the house. People on the street avoided looking at it altogether, their gazes darting away like they’d been burned. An older man, hunched and weathered, stopped me as I passed. “You’re staying there?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper. I nodded, and his face darkened. “You’d best not anger it. The house sleeps during the day, but it dreams.”

I laughed it off, but his words stuck with me. That evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, the house seemed to exhale. The air inside lightened, and the oppressive silence lifted. It almost felt welcoming. Almost.

The second night was worse. The footsteps started earlier, heavier this time, and accompanied by a faint tapping sound. At first, I thought it was coming from the windows, but then I realized it was inside the walls.

I pressed my ear to the cold plaster and heard something breathing. Not a rhythmic human breath, but a slow, deep inhale, as if the house itself was alive. The tapping grew louder, more frantic, like fingers drumming on wood, and I bolted to the living room.

That’s when I noticed the curtains had been pulled open. I hadn’t touched them.

By the third night, I started to notice patterns. The house came alive as soon as the sun set, its creaks and whispers growing louder with each passing hour. The footsteps were no longer random—they followed me. When I moved to the kitchen, they moved above the kitchen. When I stood in the hallway, they echoed down the length of it. Always just out of sight. Always watching.

I decided to stay awake until dawn, hoping the landlord’s cryptic advice about waiting until nightfall worked in reverse. But at 3:33 AM, the lights flickered, and the footsteps stopped.

That’s when I heard the voice.

It was low and hoarse, like dry leaves scraping together. “Come upstairs.”

I didn’t move. I couldn’t. The air grew heavier, and the floor beneath me seemed to vibrate with each syllable. “Come upstairs.” The voice was louder now, angrier, and accompanied by a soft dragging sound on the stairs.

I locked myself in my bedroom and didn’t sleep.

The next morning, I found claw marks on the outside of my bedroom door, deep gouges that splintered the wood. The sunlight streaming through the cracks in the shutters felt unnatural, like it didn’t belong in the house. I grabbed my phone and called the landlord.

“You didn’t try to leave, did you?” His voice was panicked, almost pleading. “Don’t make it angry.”

“What the hell is it?” I snapped.

The line went dead.

By the fourth night, the house didn’t wait for sunset to wake up. At 6:00 PM, I heard the deep hum again, that awful, resonant sound that vibrated in my chest. The footsteps were heavier now, accompanied by whispers that seeped through the walls like water. They didn’t say words; they laughed.

When I tried to open the front door, it wouldn’t budge. It wasn’t locked—it just wouldn’t move, as if the house itself was holding it shut. The windows wouldn’t break, no matter how hard I threw my chair at them. The house was alive, and it wasn’t letting me go.

Now, the house doesn’t sleep at all. The whispers follow me from room to room, sometimes growing loud enough to drown out my thoughts. Last night, I woke up to find muddy footprints on my bedroom ceiling. They weren’t mine.

I tried leaving again this morning, but the house retaliated. The walls groaned, the air grew heavy, and I felt something icy wrap around my wrist, pulling me back inside. It whispered, “Stay,” and for the first time, I whispered back, “Why?”

It laughed.

I don’t think it’s going to let me leave. And the truth is, I’m starting to think I don’t want to. The whispers feel familiar now, like an old friend. Tonight, the voice said my name.

And I answered.
