I’ve always been an antisocial person. For as long as I can remember, I’ve never been able to create connections with people. I try my best to get outside, and I work a 9-5 job, but I just continue to struggle to communicate effectively. It’s really never been my thing to be good at talking to people. It gets frustrating, and even lonely. I live alone in a medium sized apartment with my one cat, so you can imagine I have a lot of free time on my hands when I get home from work, other than making dinner and some regular house chores. 

I own a small laptop, that I enjoy browsing on after long days at work, it’s one of the main things I like to make out of with my free time, not counting   the other occasional bland hobbies here and then. One day, I arrive home from a long stressful day at work, and I’m in major need of some relaxation. I change into my lounging clothes and heat up some leftover Chinese food. I finally sit down in front of my laptop, my brain scattered. I don’t use any  
social media other than Reddit, so I browse around frequently on the news page. 

This may sound boring for a man in his late 20’s, but it’s not like I’d find any interest in platforms like Instagram or Facebook. After scrolling around for a bit, I move my mouse over to check my inbox when something pops up on my screen that immediately grasps my attention. A light green pop up ad that reads; “Are you searching for a loving companion? SwipeLily is the perfect website for you! Click here to start your journey! (insert link)” Real cheesy. At first I laugh it off and press on the little x in the corner to cancel it. I don’t think much of it, until it popped up for a second time. I thought this was strange, and tried to exit out of the ad again, but it wouldn’t go away. 

I got irritated, so I shut my laptop closed hoping that would finally get the pop up to be gone for good. I sat there in my chair, watching the clock. I finally opened up my laptop again, just for the pop up to still be stuck there on my screen. This time, I couldn’t exit out of it. What the hell? This was weird, I started thinking it was some kind of troll or virus. I powered off my laptop and decided that it would be best for me to just focus on something else. I didn’t go back on my laptop for the rest of the night. The next morning, as I was getting ready for work, I still had a few minutes left before I had to get going. I opened up my laptop. It took a few minutes for it to start up since I had powered it off the night prior. I type in my password and there it was, that stupid pop up. 

I wanted to just shrug it off and leave for work, but I had a change in thought. “Maybe I should give this a try?” I thought to myself. After many failed tinder dates and past brief high school relationships, maybe this new website would do as it says it does and help lonely people like me make a genuine true connection with someone. 

I didn’t actually fully believe it would work out for me, but out of hope and curiosity, I eventually gave in and clicked the link, since the pop up wasn’t going away anytime soon. It led me to a blank webpage with a loading screen that read; “please wait.” That’s when it all began. A bright green page with the big white cursive letters “SwipeLily” plastered across the screen. “The dating site for you” in small words beneath it. A bunch of white hearts than came rushing into the picture. This webpage was certainly eye catching. 

All day at work, SwipeLily was waiting for me. I was anticipating the adventure all day. The mix of pure inquiry and hope rushed over me. When I got home from work that day, I quickly plopped myself on the chair and opened my laptop back up. I customized my profile, filling in all my interests, personal things about myself, and more. Then finally, I was introduced into the world of SwipeLily. The first few women I saw were normal people, but didn’t really catch my attention much. I continued to swipe, until, I came across something, or somebody. It was a woman, a very pale woman. 

Her hair just past her ears, short and dark red. She smiled softly, a gap between her two front teeth. “Anita” her name read. Her dark brown eyes stared intensely at the camera. She looked exhausted. Dark black eye bags hang beneath her wide eyes. She was almost unsettling to look at, like she had something off about her I couldn’t put my finger on. The set up of the photo was strange too, like it was a mugshot, just with a plain grey background. SwipeLily seemed like an innocent site though, not a playground for criminals, even though Anita certainly looked like one. 

I read about her. Twenty-seven years old, just like me. Hobbies: reading, knitting, and something written in a foreign language I had never seen before. It says she works as a “bed layer” A bed layer? I wasn’t sure what that meant or what type of job that was, but it sounded creepy. I raised an eyebrow at Anita’s profile, until I looked down and saw that we had matched. 

How had we matched? I hadn’t liked her profile at all, but it certainly meant she liked mine. My laptop then made a ping noise. I saw it was a message from this Anita woman. “Hey Mike, I heard you’re lonely. First time on SwipeLily I see :)” I will admit, this made me quite disturbed. How did she know this stuff about me ? I put none of that nowhere in my about me. She looked creepy and seemed creepy. I mustered up some courage and clicked on the notification. “Hello Anita” I typed. I sent my message, and right away she started typing. Then she stopped. 

She sent me two photos. They were both of her. This is what really unsettled me. One was of her in that same plain grey background, with a blank, inhuman expression on her face. She looked terrifying. The second photo was of her face close up. With that same spine tingling expression spread across her pale face. This made me jump back in my seat. Who was this woman, and why did I match with her on this seemingly harmless site? This was not what I wanted at all. But, I of course was still curious. 

I typed back to her “Who are you?” She took longer to answer this time, about 5 minutes. She kept typing then not typing. “Well, you will find that out Mike. Can I call you my special guy? :))” What the hell. This woman clearly had something wrong with her in the head. “You’re a freak, goodbye” I typed back. I blocked her and closed my laptop in fear. My palms wear sweaty. A week goes by, and I hear nothing about Anita. I decide to try SwipeLily again. Since the whole Anita situation was over, my fear had disappeared and I desperately wanted to try again. I was still hoping I could make a real connection with someone. I opened up my SwipeLily browser. 

To my horror, her message was there. “That isn’t the way to treat your loving companion is it special guy?” How the hell did she contact me, I thought I blocked her. I decided I’d message her again for the LAST time. “Don’t contact me again, or I’ll get the authority involved.” I typed out fearfully. Anita immediately viewed my message. She began to type, then she stopped. To my absolute horror, she was video calling me. I kept declining, but she wouldn’t quit. There was no way I was answering. “Special guy, you’re making me upset. 

I thought I would be your loving companion” her message read. A series of cryptic messages in that same foreign language than flooded my screen. I quickly  blocked her again, then slammed my laptop so roughly it cracked. I fell back into my seat, distressed. My hand fell over my head. I tried to calm myself down. I don’t know why this was scaring me so much, it has to just be a troll. I sat there for a few moments reassuring myself it was fine. The rest of the night I tried forgetting about this whole situation. 

The next morning at work was busy. I sat there at my office, with piles of paperwork sitting there on my desk. I was still pondering on Anita, and  SwipeLily. I wondered if she was a real, mentally messed up person that needed serious help, or just a stupid internet troll. I mean, nowadays, any moron can download a cheap app and create a false identity with those damn AI tools. Technology is so advanced. 

A couple minutes pass as I try to get through the paperwork. When I feel a small tap on my shoulder. The front receptionist stood behind me. “Mike? The boss needs you. There’s something going on up front.” I look behind her to see my grumpy boss, standing there with his arms crossed.  I get up out of my chair to go see what he wanted. “Hello sir, you needed me?” He smacks his lips and instructs me to follow him. 

He leads me out front. Multiple security guards swarm in a group. “What seems to be the problem?” I ask him. “There’s a woman here, claiming she knows you. She looks like she’s on something.” I raise my eyebrow at his statement. That’s when the security guards revealed who this woman was. There she stood. Anita. Right when she layed those big eyes on me, a deranged smile spread across her face. I jumped back in fear.

I froze in my tracks. How did she find me. How. The. Hell. Did. She. Find. Me. My heart palpitated. I clammed up. Sweating. I now knew this woman was real, and she was seriously out to get me. She stood there, not moving an inch. Not even blinking. Just smiling at me, a disturbing, evil smile. She really did look insane. “Special guy! There you are!” Her voice sounded almost robotic. Calm, but spine tingling and inhuman. “I know you’re lonely, you need a loving companion! So here I am.” 

She tries moving forward towards me. This triggers my fight or flight, I immediately jump back. Security grabs her. “Get away from me! I don’t know you! How did you find me?!” I shriek. That’s when Anita smile fades. She freezes. That same inhuman, unsettling expression on her face. Her eyes go dark, a soulless black. She looked horrifying. Anxiety and fear then completely take over my body. I almost can’t breathe. She just stares at me. Even security look at eachother in confusion and fear. 

My boss slowly steps inside. Shutting the door behind him. She was possessing absolute terror in everyone around her. That’s when she lets out an animalistic scream, that could be heard from miles away. She didn’t sound human. Was she even? She attempts to run towards me. I immediately jump back and put my hands up, flinching. Security grabbed her before she could get to me. As she was forcefully dragged away, she continued to stare into my soul, muttering an incoherent mess. Than she finally screams “I WILL SEE YOU. I MUST SEE YOU.” For as long as I could see her being dragged away, she was staring at me the whole time. 

My boss was watching the whole thing through the window. I run inside once she’s no longer in view. I collapse on the ground, in complete shell shock of what happened. Many coworkers rush over to me bombarding me with questions. I can’t get the words out. This woman was stalking me, I needed to get help as soon as possible. I was obviously let off of work early that day. The first thing I do when I get home? Call the police. “I’d like to file a report for stalking.”
