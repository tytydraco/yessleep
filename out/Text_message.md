Was that you, Jonathan?


Read a text message from my mom


What?


I replied


Were you screaming in the hallway?


N- No... no mom, I wasn't


Close your lights and lock the door NOW!


In a hurry, I shut down my pc, closed my monitor, locked my door, and hid under my bed


*BUZZ*


My phone vibrated


I hurriedly switched it on to see a message from my mom


Sweetie, can you call the police? It's outside my room!


I quickly closed the messages app and dialed 911


911, what's your emergency?


Hello... there's an intruder in my house, and they're standing outside my mom's bedroom. I- I don't want them to kill her...


I whispered


Can you give us your address?


I- I don't know the full address


Ok, just stay with us until the police track your phone


Ok... ok


After what felt like 5 minutes, I felt a vibration


NO!


My phone died, I was forced to sit in silence, drown in worry as I pray that the cops managed to track my location and hope that they're on their way


I sat in silence for what felt like hours when all of a sudden


*BANG*


The door to my mom's bedroom was kicked in. All I heard next was a high-pitched screech followed by my mother screaming in pain


I started to silently sob as I heard my mom being ripped apart, I eventually gathered myself up and decided to make a run for it


I slowly opened my bedroom door and stepped outside, I froze in terror when I saw a hideous creature, standing right in front of me. I broke down in tears as I saw it, covered in blood with an eye sticking out of its mouth


I knew it was the end of me when it started to let out a horrific screech, but all of a sudden


*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*


Detroit police, open up!


*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*


This is the Detroit police department, open the door NOW!


*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*


OPEN THE DOOR N-


HELP ME, PLEASE!!!!


I yelled out 


The creature pushed me aside and leaped at my bedroom window as the officers kicked in the door


I ran down the stairs and hugged the policeman as I broke down in tears. He took me to the car as his partner  ran up the stairs, gun in hand only to find broken doors and windows, a skeleton, and a carpet covered in blood...


As for me, I'm much better now, my father came back from a business trip which saved his life that night, we arranged my mother's funeral and it should take place next week on the 13th of October. I'm seeing a therapist now... to help with the nightmares I now have each night. I just can't forget my mother's screams as that thing ripped her apart, piece by piece...


I just pray that I never have to encounter that thing ever again in my life
