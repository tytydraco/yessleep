I went to the school where it happened. I was there the first time Mr. Cow showed up. I was one of the younger kids in kindergarten, so I don’t remember many details, all these years later.

At the end of class we got sent home like normal, at first. When things were only starting to get weird. At drop off there were those kids who didn’t want to leave their parents’ side, like always. But when things started breaking down, and kids got in trouble for the simplest of transgressions, they refused to get out of their cars each morning at dropoff.

I saw it happen, once. I don’t remember his name. Roberto, I think. He screamed how he wouldn’t go that day. That he was in trouble, and he didn’t mean to make a hole in the wall. Everything was breaking down in the school. His mom just stared ahead while the resource officer pulled him from the car.

Mr. Cow was standing at the door, waving the students in. He clapped when Roberto’s fingers wretched free of the car door, leaving bloody scratches on the paint job.

I’m told, and I think I remember, how the smaller ones like us were just kept in the classrooms. They brought us our food, and it was regular cafeteria food at first. Those dry rubbery hamburgers with neon cheese. Squares of delicious pizza with cheesy pepperoni cubes on them.

The power went out after a week. Not just at school but in the whole town. 

It wasn’t winter yet, so it was hot. At least ninety degrees. Sometimes in the upper eighties. A few times in the hundreds. And we still had to go to school. To sit in the dark and learn about letters and phonics. One of Mr. Cow’s songs was about the importance of reading so we could recite the scriptures correctly, and to do that we’d have to know how to read.

The third, fourth and fifth graders. Those are the ones who are really messed up. The ones who had it the worst, the whole time.

Those big kids were the ones who had to play Mr. Cow’s games. 

“Eff those big kids,” my friend Davido (who would later betray me) said.
The story that gets told the most is about the Field Day that happened the week before we were finally rescued.

There were all the games that kids don’t play anymore, only made a little bit more dangerous than they already were when our parents played them. Mr. Cow, in his almost musical, low voice would explain the instructions for each game.

The sack race was up and down the bleachers in the gym. I was never very athletic, but the gym used to be a sanctuary from boring teachers and impossible lessons. The first couple of weeks it smelled like mildew and disinfectant, as always. After that it was just mildew. Then it was the musty smell of rot with notes of bodily fluids. 

Unlike regular sack races, you didn’t hop in the sack. You could walk or run, because you were put in the sack, completely covered, and the sack was tied off. Even Benny, the tallest kid, was put in one, head to toe. 

He was the first out and didn’t play any other games. He was so tall, but after that no one ever asked if he’d play basketball. Not with the limp, and other things.

 It wasn’t a race, no. Each kid had to go up and down and up and down the bleachers, until there wasn’t anyone left. Those who tried to cheat by giving up early were taken away.

Then there was Suicide. We lined up on the wall, or “Home”. And we’d run about twenty yards to a line of rocks or bricks, enough for each kid minus one. You’d have to get a rock and then throw it at the kid who didn’t have a rock. Albert threw his rock at the first one who was ‘it,’ Randie, but only hit her foot and knocked off her sandal.

There was a loud scream that brought the game to a pause. 

“You have to play fair, children,” Mr. Cow said. “You can’t be nice in this contest. Nice guys finish last. Albert will be ‘It’ next round.”

Albert wasn’t being nice, he just sucked at throwing things. He kept his arm bent even though every single one of his coaches told him not to do that when throwing.

I don’t think anyone died in those games, but if you ask different kids, each will name a different game where someone died. 

Kill the Carrier. Tug of War. Red Rover.

At first, the loser would have to be the pole in a game of tetherball. Those ones were lucky.

Only one person died the next time Mr. Cow showed up.

We saw him again at the second home game of the season. It wasn’t a special game like homecoming or anything. It was against the Dairies, the team from the next town over who were our rival of sorts. We usually beat them, so maybe we were their rivals, but they weren’t our’s. In Pena, we were the Longhorns. The next next town over were the Cowboys. They were the ones who beat us most of the time, but always seemed to lose to the Dairies.

It happened after one of the players got hurt. Number 23 caught the ball but slipped and got slammed by two other players. One at his legs and the other at his chest. 

There’s a reason why chopblocks are illegal. He was out and didn’t get back up. The game stopped and everything was quiet. 

For a long time.

Getting knocked out isn’t like in the movies or video games. If you watch UFC, you know how it is. Someone hits the switch and you’re out. But in a few seconds, they are back and acting like nothing happened. Or they don’t know what happened.

It wasn’t like that.

At some point, he was taken off the field. He was helped up, and someone nodded and then a slow cheer started and spread through the crowd, like he was back with us. 

I don’t know if he was.

He still wasn’t moving, just held there like he was Jesus dying on the cross.

No one saw Mr. Cow until after the third down of the next play. Our school was small, and the football field didn’t ever need to seat more than a couple hundred people if the season was going good. 

To the south of the football field was some farmland. There wasn’t anything growing this season, and so there weren’t any mice or rats. It was full of weeds and overgrown grass that got waist high. No one walked through there because if you did, you’d get ticks, stickers, chiggers, burrs, or ants all over you.

Everyone was watching the game or talking with their friends or eating their nachos. No one saw him at first. Then some kids started crying. They were easy to ignore if you weren’t sitting close to one. 

Their parents just watched the game and told them to shut up. Or they’d give them a reason to cry.

Everyone saw him when the other team made a field goal that kept flying past the goal into that field.

Everyone knew what Mr. Cow looked like. This time he didn’t have the football helmet, just the red number Six Pena Cowboys Jersey covering about half of his udders. Nor did his felt fur show any sign of dilapidation or rot. The full body mascot suit had padding that kept whoever was inside safe from the poking of overgrowth, although he was too far out for anyone to know if there were any bugs crawling on his yellow body or into his cowboy boots.

You heard them jangle when he’d jump or kick.

Mr. Cow stood there and waved at us all. He had a football. Not the one that just landed in the field but one of countless lost balls that had been thrown or kicked or hit out into the field during games and practice. He mimed like he was going to throw it or was running a play. Doing a snap. When a Dairy player facemasked one of the Cowboys, he pulled at the ring hanging from his snout.

Some will say that there was a honk. Others are adamant that there was no sound. I could have sworn that it sounded like a steamhorn. More than one time there was a scream. Early on, it was a teenage girl overdoing it.

Later, they were loud and real.

No one really cared about the game at that point. The Cowboys were out of it, and the Dairies were able to take advantage of several bad plays and flags. The receivers could achieve some yardage when chased by the opposing team, but if they were on their own, they didn’t want to run towards Mr. Cow.

He would hold the attention of our quarterback for a few seconds, and that was enough for a couple of brutal sacks. We didn’t even call any timeouts. 

They just wanted the game to end.

Mr. Cow indicated his displeasure by waving his finger each time something bad happened. Except when it was another injury. He covered his snout with his gloved hands or mimed like he was crying. Or he would pantomime the universal “aw shucks” gesture as our defeat was all but assured.

Until halftime. 

Several parents ran to the principal to complain. They caught him as he was headed to his car, trying to escape. They asked him why he was running away, and the principal said it was because he was scared. He was a teacher back when Mr. Cow showed up for the first time (at another school, actually). He wasn’t going to go after him alone.

No one really wanted to chase down “that demon,” especially the ones who would always complain about things. Like how this wouldn’t happen if we had prayer in schools (even though there were hourly prayers the first time). Or who would go to the PTA meetings and demand we remove all litter boxes from the schools (there were never any litter boxes in our school). 

A few moms and dads (more moms than dads) agreed to go with him to confront Mr. Cow in the field. They stalked towards the mascot, who had been mimicking the cheerleader’s choreography even though none of the cheer teams had been sent out like they normally would during halftime. 

While the principal, Mr. Estevez fumbled with the keys to unlock the fencing that separated the football field from the farmland, everyone looked away for just a second when the buzzer indicated it was time to resume the game.

And Mr. Cow was gone.

The Dairies continued the onslaught. Our Cowboys had to play with their backs towards that field, and so they were terrified and jumpy.  They didn’t even play the fourth quarter. The coaches said the game was over and no one really argued. 

Not even anyone who had earlier claimed they had money on the game.

On the way back to our car, I heard two little kids arguing about why he was called Mr. Cow if cows are girls and boys are bulls. The kids’ parents didn’t want to get into the finer points of sexual dimorphism with their children. They wanted to get back home and figure out what to do about the return of the monster that once ruled over Pena Elementary and terrorized the whole town.

He popped up a few more times, until Christmas break. Once at a carwash fundraiser, put on by the girls volleyball team at the Dairy Queen.

Another time during the Thanksgiving Parade. He didn’t march in it. Just stood on the rooftop of the old, abandoned Aztec movie theatre. There was no ladder or ropes or any sign of how he got up there when he disappeared much like at the game. When someone finally decided to do something about it.

They never caught him. 

Towards the end of the school year, there was a janitor that got accused of creeping on kids that was fired. Everyone thought it was him, even though they said it was because the school was five million dollars in the hole that year.  A lot of other teachers, staff, and at least one certified creep got let go later in the semester. 

They found him wearing the costume in a bathtub, having overdosed on Fentanyl. His landlord discovered the body after two weeks and a smell that wouldn’t ever come out of the dump. The first cop that arrived on the scene threw up, and made the landlord clean it up while he called for backup. 

It made sense to air out the place. That smell spread across the whole block but what else could you do? A dead body’s not going to walk out of the place it died.

The body should have been safe there. We were a small town. Maybe if this had been in the big city there’d have been some true crime losers who would want to get the costume to sell on eBay for someone’s collection. 

But everyone in that part of Texas had been traumatized or knew someone who had been traumatized by what Mr. Cow did to us. We all just wanted to move on and forget about it.

The landlord found the body of the dead janitor wearing the Mr. Cow costume. The 911 tape was clear. He didn’t say it was Louis the Longhorn, which was the official name. He said it was Mr. Cow. 

Like at the school ten years ago and at the games this year. 

But when the crew got there, they just found the man’s decomposing, bloated body. Naked. It came apart when they tried to get it in the body bag. They got all the pieces in there. But no one could understand how the costume could be removed from the corpse without doing any damage.

He’s out there. Somewhere. 

Because we all know the thing that left that apartment wasn’t the janitor. 

It was Mr. Cow.
