"Good job, man!" My co worker cheerfully exclaims as i carefully piece together what exactly happened here. My co-worker Sarah has always been nice company, to be honest i see her as more of a friend than a co-worker. "Thanks." I bashfully reply as i get ready to leave, turning towards Sarah. "Let's go, i think we're done here." She nods in response and we both exit the dingy house someone was murdered in only 3 days ago. After that, i take a moment to stand in the cool air. A nice change from the hot and stuffy atmosphere back in that house, that's for sure. Sarah joins me, and for a moment the world stands so incredibly still. Well, until Sarah brings me back to reality. "Cmon, we should go." She says, lightly tapping my shoulder. "Yeah." I agree, walking towards my car. The cool night air is just right, i continue to bask in it. "Bye Sarah!" My enthusiastic voice calls out, she gives me a wave before getting in her car as i get in my own.


Nothing much happened from there, i only drove home. My hands rushing to unlock the front door, pushing it open hastily. I wasted no time to get to bed, today's shift tired my strength. I walk upstairs... well pratically run but you get the point. When i get up there i scramble to my room, opening my wardrobe and grabbing some pjs. I get changed before promptly collapsing onto my bed, getting comfy before succumbing to slumber. 

Beep.


A notification wakes me, i groggily grab my phone. As the screen turns on, i shield my eyes from the impending flashbang. "One new message from: Boss." Jesus christ at this hour?! I feel the urge to collapse back into my sleep but curiosity wins me over, my finger tapping the notification. What i saw next made my blood run cold... 

"We have a new case for you." I wish it stopped there, but the horrifying reality sunk in as i saw my full name and a photo of myself. "She was murdered, stabbed to death." I gasp, throwing my phone as i freeze up. What the fuck? What the actual fuck? Is this some prank because it's not funny! I suppress the urge to vomit, gagging as my wide eyes stare in pure horror. My heart thumps in my chest like a drum, my breathing heavy with panic. I struggle to ready my breathing, but eventually i do. "Calm down, it's just a prank." I mutter to myself. I am able to calm most of my nerves though a chilling feeling still engulfs me, the feeling i can't quite describe. After that, i chuckle. "Wow, really got me for a moment." I mutter before sinking off back to sleep.

When i wake up, i do everything you'd usually do. Eat breakfast, brush your teeth, shower, get ready, etc. It was only after my mind ran back to what my boss had texted me yesterday. I chuckle at it again, the photoshop work was pretty impressive. "That looked very real." I say to nobody, sipping my coffee. After that, i get in my car and begin driving to work. Once i get there, i hastily rush to my bosses office to discuss the little prank he pulled on me.

"And that prank you pulled yesterday? Impressive, you scared me for a moment." I laugh, my work as a detective had made me numb to most things but when i tell you i froze at what my boss said next... 

 "What prank? (Full name) Is dead, your being very insensitive." His sturn voice rings in my head, i go to mutter something. I need to ask him what the fuck is happening here, yet my voice is caught in my throat. My head however screams, loudly. This could be a part of the prank but his voice, his voice is far too serious for this to be a joke. "I'M NOT DEAD, JAMES LISTEN TO ME!" He promptly speaks "Now go and solve the case, i know you can!" His voice is very enthusiastic yet the loud ringing in my ears, the screaming in my head. It distracts me, how the fuck is he so calm after what he just said? 

"What prank? (Full name) Is dead, your being very insensitive" Spun around in my head, repeating like a broken record and yet i couldn't even speak. "What's wrong? It looks like you've seen a ghost! James jokes, bringing me back to reality. I mutter a weak "Y-yeah." As i hastily run to the bathroom, i waste no time to puke in the first stall my eyes gazed on. After that, i run. My legs kick off faster than they ever have before as i go down the stairs, out the entrance door and into my car. 

Once i get home i decide to sleep this off, rest will help calm my nerves, right?

Once again however, i am awoken. This time not by a notification on my phone, but the house alarm. I jolt up, someone's in my house. The realization dawns on me, i hastily lock my bedroom door and begin to call the police. "Hello? 911, this is (Full name) Here, can you please come to my house." Once again, i feel the urge to vomit. "What? Full name was recently murdered, disrespecting the dead with your pranks isn't very funny." My breath catches in my throat, it's another person by that name... surely. "O-oh, you've got it all wrong!" My shaky voice mutters. "That's another (Full name)" My heart sinks. "Theres only one in the area, the one that lives on Redview, house 22." That's my address, i feel the urge to vomit again. My beating heart threatens to jump out of my chest, my breathing becomes heavy as i shake in pure terror. "Goodbye now, do not prank us again." I come back to my senses. "No w-" I'm cut off with a beep, too late. "Great, just great..." I mutter to myself, frozen in the same spot unable to get up no matter how hard i tried. I try to pull myself up with all my strength, to no avail.

And then, a loud banging sound. Someone's outside my room.
