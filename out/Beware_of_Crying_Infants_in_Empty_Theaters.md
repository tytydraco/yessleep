I know what you’re thinking, that kind of warning is probably meant to sell seats. Charge extra for ghost tours, that’s what my boss told me to do when we first started having this problem. 

Things escalated quickly from just the occasional complaint after about three weeks. 
That was when someone claimed the person they came to the movies with had simply disappeared. 

We chalked it up to just a few moviegoers wanting to pull a prank or maybe couples having problems and leaving their exes high and dry during a bad cinematic experience. 

I guess I didn’t really think it was real until we found the blood dripping from a theater seat last week. 

It looked like someone had been sitting there enjoying their popcorn one minute and the next had been brutally chewed up like jerky.

It was just after a matinee show, my best friend Wade was on clean up duty and shouted loud enough for me to hear in the women’s stall next door. 

I ran in there, thinking maybe he had found another homeless person passed out and instead discovered what looked like a putrid pile of guts and loose hair and bone. Wade and I both did our best to hold back the nausea we felt and I told him that I would call the shift manager Joey so we could figure out what to do about this. 

Joey was not as easily upset about the situation as us because he was convinced it was just some crazy prank. 

“There’s no way anyone could have been murdered in here, it was during a normal viewing right? So that means there must have been at least fifty people in the audience. Look at where this happened, most of them would be in rows above the mess… so how could that have occurred when there were so many eye witnesses?”

He told Wade and I to stop being babies and clean it up or he would tell the theater owner. When he left, my friend and I were still uneasy about the grotesque scene, but part of what Joey said made sense. 

“I’ve worked in haunted houses before, the stuff they do to the models in there is pretty convincing,” I told Wade as I grabbed some gloves and pushed my cart next to his. I also knew that Joey expected us to move fast, the next movie would be premiering in fifteen minutes. So despite how awful it made us feel or how eerie the entire cinema felt, we had to get the job done. We didn’t talk during the clean up, just grabbed the loose organs and tossed them into bags like they were coke cans. I convinced myself it had to be just par for the course like Joey said and I put it out of my mind when it was all said and done. 

Then it happened again. 

And this time a moviegoer claimed they heard strange noises in the theater right before we went in for clean up. 

“I think there is one guy still in there, watching the end credits,” they told me. 

Both of us talked about the noises that others had claimed to have heard as we entered the vacant cinema.  

On the screen we saw that the final credits had played and that typically meant the lights would go up inside the room, but this time they went out entirely. Wade froze as we got to the steps and he remarked, “Austin, I swear I saw something move on row K.”

I took out my flashlight, feeling my heart beat a little faster as I told him to calm down. I focused the beam of light on the row he mentioned, not seeing a thing. 

“Your eyes are playing tricks with you. Go get the lighting working and I’ll start at the top,” I told him. 

Wade left and I slowly walked up the theater steps. 

I’ve worked here for a few years and was used to being in these cinemas alone, but this time felt very different especially because of the total darkness. I was about midway up the steps when I heard the strangest noise… it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. 

A baby crying. The rumors were real! I stopped where I was and kept the flashlight close to me, trying to not freak out. 

“Wade that better not be you trying to scare me,” I shouted toward the noise. It was distant, somewhere on the other side of the auditorium. But as I stood there and moved the flashlight across the empty seats, I noticed the crying became more incessant. 

Then I saw a silhouette of someone sitting near the middle of the cinema, row M and it nearly made my heart skip a beat. 

They were sitting very still, almost motionless in the recliner like they had fallen asleep. Except I saw there was something else there,  hunched on top of the stranger’s shoulders with its head twisted down and it’s mouth right against a cavity in the man’s head. As I let the flashlight linger over top of the slumped shoulders of the moviegoer, I saw the creature was no longer than a small child, its legs bent backwards and its toes digging into the theater seat as it passively ate the man’s innards from his skull like they were soup. It had no hair or skin color, just a long bony body and misshapen head resembling that of a goblin shark. I heard it make short work of the victim, tearing him apart with no regard for the mess as it snarled and then, turned its putrid gaze to me. 

It shrieked, angered by the light and I swear to you it sounded like the squeal of a newborn. I dropped the light in an instant and it ran off into the shadows, leaving behind the husk of the unfortunate man still covered in blood and drool like a discarded piñata. 

Wade returned moments later as the electrical problems were fixed and saw me standing there, stiff as a statue staring at the body, too mortified by the last few minutes to move or speak. 

I didn’t have to though, the gruesome carnage spoke for itself. 

So we closed off that cinema and called the police right away. Joey insisted I avoid mentioning anything about a feral beast child running amok, so the cops only thought they had a homicide to investigate. 

“What’s the plan to catch this thing? If we don’t do something, more bodies will start piling up and we’ll be out of business,” Joey asked. 

I didn’t even want to fathom being near it again. “You didn’t see what I saw. It broke that man’s neck like it was nothing and moved faster than lightning. The fucking thing was a demon.”

“Maybe so,” Joey conceded as he stared down at the roped off cinema. “But it still must be mortal. Those cops found traces of skin and saliva that didn’t belong to the victim. That must mean this beastie boy is living within the walls of this theater somewhere.” 

“Great. Guess that explains the crying we’ve been hearing these past few weeks… it must be getting hungrier, must be why it’s resorting to these vicious killings.” 

Joey had a glint in his eye, an idea had formed of what we would do next. 

“If it’s taking bigger risks than that means we need to do the same and starve it. We’ll close the entire theater for a week, and then lure it into a cinema and catch it. It will be so blinded by hunger that it won’t see the trap,” Joey decided. 

“To do something like that, we would need to find live bait. The creature has been attacking lone moviegoers near the end of the films,.. stands to reason even in desperation it would match that pattern,” Wade suggested as he returned from finishing his statement with the police. 

“Sounds like you would be just the man for the job,” our boss said patting Wade on the back. 

“Once we catch it… what are you planning to do with it?” I asked, not even daring to think of the bizarre plan for the trap he had in mind. Wade’s life was at risk, or worse… it could be that none of this went as planned and the feral child left the theater without a second thought. 

Joey smiled, promising us glory and fame if we did as he said. It was an alluring prospect. To catch something like this was a once in a life time opportunity. Somehow he persuaded us. 

Or maybe deep down we wanted it and thought we had a shot at getting that limelight.  

Either way, Joey called the theater owner to explain the need for shutting down the entire building for a week, just to get rid of the bad stench from the dead body. Not wanting any more bad press, they agreed to it. 

And we prepared for the next encounter with the feral child. 

The week honestly went by too quickly for me. Everyday Joey would gather supplies or call me to make sure I wasn’t backing out. 
And I know what you are thinking because I thought about it too… why was I *not* backing out?

Every time I closed my eyes I saw that crazy feral beast crawling over that poor man’s body like preying mantis. I knew it could easily kill us the moment we were alone with it again. And after a week of no food, it would be even more deadly. 

But Wade didn’t want to back down. He was stoked to meet this monster and was convinced Joey’s plan was going to work. 

“We’ve got automatic weapons, a cage strong enough to hold a lion and if things go wrong we’ve got you to come in with the grenade and save the day.” 

I didn’t like the idea of being the one to hold such a dangerous explosive but my friends were not going to be talked out of this crazy plan. 
So I just nodded and listened, the panic and dread growing in me with each passing moment. 

You ever see a car crash? It all happens so fast and yet as you replay it in your head you see every little detail. This was the same way. I knew where this was heading. And there was nothing that could stop it either. 

When the time came, I was told to be up in the film booth to work the projector. We would play a short film and pretend that work was returning to normal. When we walked into the cinema though I immediately felt uneasy. I was expecting more destruction, because if the child was cornered and searching for food surely it would have turned over every nook and cranny to find some? 

So why was the building seemingly untouched? Had it moved to greener pastures in the week we were gone? 

“It’s still here. I’m sure of it,” Joey said as he got Wade in place near the middle of the cinema and then gave me the hand signal to start the film. 

The movie played and I watched as intently as I could. I was supposed to give a warning the moment something went wrong… 

As I sat there in the small reel studio, I couldn’t help but think this was my passion as well. I was vulnerable because I was so focused on wanting this I didn’t consider that I could be a target. 

Then a small droplet of spit fell onto my shoulder. 

I dared to look up, my knees buckling as I saw two wide slit eyes filled with pure hate staring down at me. 

It had the face of a woman, ragged jet black hair with pale skin and parched lips. 
From the neck down though, all I saw was a monstrosity. 

With enough legs, arms and sagging tits to resemble a human centipede, the creature slowly crawled from the ceiling to the ground in front of the projector. It stood to its full height, hunching over in the tall room to make it clear how large it was. 

With its back legs cracking and bending in impossible directions it crushed the projector and moved toward me, pinning me into a corner before I even had a chance to react. 

I closed my mouth, trying hard to not scream while the creature opened its own and a forked barbed tongue slowly edged its way out and moved along my cheek. The prickly texture ripped at my skin, the way a razor might cut you for an early morning shave. This beast was preparing to kill and eat me, but first it wanted to play with me first. 

I closed my eyes, the spit from its mouth oozing against my scalp as I shook and whimpered. 

From behind, I heard a voice. Joey. He was standing there at the back entrance to the projector room and he had something next to him. It took a moment in the new darkness of the theater to see it clearly. Wade’s crazy plan had worked, the smaller hunched baby was in Joey’s arms, screaming for its mother. 

Suddenly eating me was forgotten and the centipede woman rushed toward Joey like a freight train. 

Joey slammed the door shut and I heard the wails of the smaller beast echo loudly as he ran to the open theater. The mother gave a banshee cry in response, moving to the window where the projector had once emitted its pictures onto the big screen. It began to hit the glass, frantic to reach its young. 

I slumped down to my hands and knees, crawling over to the other exit while it was distracted. I didn’t even dare to look back as I made it into the fire stairs. Then I started to look for a weapon that could potentially finish the monster off. 

Joey and Wade were waiting in the cinema as I rushed in both of them watching frantically for the mother to break through and Joey told us both to remain perfectly still. The trap would work, he promised. He was sure of it

We stood perfectly still and looked toward the window, sure the mother would burst through a few more seconds. But the cinema was deathly silent and I noticed even the young infant creature was quiet. Something was wrong. 

A strange clattering noise resounded and Joey looked about frantically trying to determine where it came from. 

“It’s using the floor vents to move around!!” I realized as I heard the noise echo near us. There was no way to be sure where it might strike. 

Joey took a step back, looking toward the vent nearest to us. Then all of us watched in amazement as the centipede woman pushed the grating up and lunged. 

It struck Joey first, allowing the child to worm free as its barbed tongue jabbed his right eye. I pulled Wade from where he stood and demanded he give me the weapon he was supposed to have brought. 

He passed me the small fire axe and I swung at the back of the woman, trying to fend her off before she killed Joey. 

The younger creature shrieked and bounded toward me when it heard its mother in pain. 

With the axe as my only defense I swung at the young beast and lopped its head off with one swift stroke. 

This sent the mother into a frenzy, she tossed Joey across the room like he was a rag doll and then flung chairs toward my head, the blind rage was the only thing saving me from being killed and I used it to run and hide. 

For some reason I thought Wade would be smart enough to follow me. Instead when I looked back I saw he had found one of the chairs that the mother had ripped from our cinema and hurled it back at her. 

All that did was enrage her even more. It’s serpentine body wrapped around Wade and I heard his bones break as the monster constricted his life away. Long ivory fangs extended from the woman’s mouth and her jaw collapsed down to allow her to bite on his head as his eyes widened with absolute fear. 

All I could do was watch as the snake woman enclosed her throat over my friend. 

somehow I snapped out of the sheer terror and before I knew it, I was at her back with the axe again. I slammed it into her jagged spine a dozen times. The creature moaned and shook, refusing to release Wade. 

So I did what I knew my friend would have wanted and instead ended his life right where the snakes head was at. Her grip tightened and her body reeled back as she took Wade’s head right where I had severed it. His spine scattered across the cinema with muscle and sinew raining down. 

Then the beast recoiled and crawled toward another vent. 

Somehow I knew if it escaped that it would return, but I was so transfixed on the broken body of my friend I could not stop him. The centipede lady pushed her body into a vent and then was out of sight before I could even try to get a few more good hits in. 

I kept looking at where Wade’s neck now bled out on the brown carpet, disturbed not only because of what I had been forced to do but also by what was lodged there amid his tissue and organs. They looked like millions of tiny bugs or tadpoles if I’m being more precise. 

Eating away at his corpse like it was a fresh kill. 

Something told me those bugs were more than just an afterthought. The serpent had attempted to implant Wade’s corpse with a new batch of infant creatures. I shuddered and swung the axe against the body several more times just to be sure her infectious young had nothing to feed on anymore. 

I went to find Joey next. He was hardly breathing, laying my next to a pile of debris and offering me a camera. 

“All the proof we need… in there. Call… someone,” he begged. 

I told him the only ones I would call were 911 but he insisted we couldn’t do that. The cinema would be closed down. 

I didn’t care. Once he passed out I made the call and then pulled him out of the cinema. He was unconscious when paramedics arrived, and my theater manager was there as well; demanding answers for all of the damage. 

I considered offering the camera as proof but thought twice. Would he attempt to pursue this monster like Joey had? No more people could die. 

My reluctance to answer however was seen as negligence and I was fired. 

I took that as the chance to tell the truth about the monster and whet it had done. 

“It’s all here,” I insisted, prepared to give over the footage. 

He swatted it out of my hand and then smashed it to bits. 

“Utter nonsense. You best be glad that the police left or I would be having you locked up as well.” 

I looked at the destroyed footage my hopes of Wade and Joey’s sacrifice not being in vain were gone in mere seconds. 

I walked out, fists trembling. 

That was a few weeks ago. I have tried forgetting the whole ordeal. 

But circumstances don’t let me forget. The manager closed the theater due to the overwhelming debt from the repairs. They demolished it a week ago and there were no signs of the centipede woman except strange shreds of skin found in some of the old vents. 

I knew that meant she had shed her husk and healed. Moving to a new feeding ground.

This is why I now hear it’s clattering in the night or hear it’s wails in my restless sleep. 
I know it will search for me and find me, for all that I did to it. 

Maybe I deserve it for even surviving. 

The whole experience has taught me I know nothing of our natural world. 

And that there are darknesses best left unexplored. 

I pass that knowledge on to others now who spread rumors of their own. Be they a serpent or a rat or something else.  
I remind them that sometimes when you whisper about what lurks in the shadows… 

Sometimes, something whispers back.
