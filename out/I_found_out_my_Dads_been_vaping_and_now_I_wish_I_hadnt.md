*Oh Jesus, calm down, dude.*

I looked at the vape. It flashed a little animation of a five point star getting brighter and then exploding into a new star before rinsing and repeating. Above the star a ticker tape LED display read **F-R-E-E-K-Z-B-A-R-8**.

It had been barely thirty minutes from my last pull. It had read, "**F-R-E-E-K-Z-B-A-R-8**," that time. Number eight. That was the equivalent of the edge of the skyscraper's ledge. I felt the hunger in my very being. I felt what Vera called, "The Craving,".

I heard myself say, "Engine engine number nine. That's the end of the line."

I was getting irrational. And sweaty. Really sweaty.

Okay. Think. I tried blinking some sweat out of my eyes with mixed results. Accelerated English, Mrs. Kasperzyk, junior year. Write it down. Put it into words before you lose them along with everything else you didn't bargain for. But, how do you put five sweat soaked tees and bandanas into words when your fingers won't stop trembling?

Where do you find the address of a paragraph that would make sense to anyone other than Vera, and I don't think I'll be raising her again anytime soon. Think, dude. Right. Ugghhh, oh yea, Mock Trial team with Mr. Wachovsky.

Stick to the facts, Sam; Just the facts. Just the ice cold hard facts. Facts don't lie. Facts is facts.

Fact #1:

I swore to Dad after Mom went missing that I wouldn't get involved with any bad stuff. No drinking. No smoking. Just choir practice and studying for the SATs. And, until the end of last May, I had kept my word, but, then along came;

Fun Fact #2:

Dad didn't. Not even close. Dad had developed a very bad habit and was keeping it close to his vest.

I remember when Dad suddenly started acting, well; just different. He was never the most pleasant dude and that got alot no better after Mom went missing. Dad started working seven days a week and when he was at home he was locked up in his home lab. I had never been in there and lately Dad wasn't coming out. I was under strict orders not to disturb Dad.

I told Vera about it and then I did something stupid. I let Vera talk me into putting a motion activated camera in a stuffed kangaroo just where it could spy Dad press the four digit code to the lab's keypress activated lock.

And just like that, we were in.

Vera looked around. There were beakers, multiple laptops, some with devices attached that looked like Geiger counter or some type of electronic measuring devices. And attached to those were about a dozen bright yellow disposable vapes in various states of electronic assembly or disassembly; I couldn't tell which.

One a greaseboard I recognized my Dad's chickenscrawl. It scratched: Ten is the answer

"What the fuck?" Vera asked wide eyed.

"Maybe we should just bail," I suggested.

Vera gave me some stink eye.

"Stop making jailhouse wife sounds," she barked.

Vera's black eyes darted around some more. Mine never moved. Let alone the rest of me.

Vera seemed to spy something and suddenly ducked under a long Staple's table then began rummaging through a cardboard box.

"Holy twizzlers, Batman!"

"What?" I heard myself ask?

"There's like 150 vapes in here," she said, gesturing the open box at me and making uncomfortable eye contact.

"Put them back," was all I said.

Vera gave me a disappointed look.

"Fine," she scowled. "It's your party."

We beat a hasty retreat and I took the stuffed spy kangaroo with me. I immediately felt a little less anxious.

Back at Vera's room she asked, "What happened to your Mom anyway, Sam?"

"Well, Mom and Dad were arguing a lot even though they tried to hide it. And then, it was weird, it was like they were fine. Like they hadn't been at each other's throats for months and months out of nowhere."

"But-" Vera began.

"You mean how'd she go missing?" I asked.

Vera nodded impatiently.

I thought about it. I told her. It was last Memorial Day weekend. Mom and Dad were planning a cook out in the backyard. Mom walked past me in the house and said, "She was going out for a pack of smokes. Weird thing about it was Mom didn't smoke; ever. And Dad was working down in the basement lab that weekend and I was sort of pouting because I didn't think Mom and Dad were going to get me the Les Paul I kept bugging them about since I had discovered Alice in Chains on a music subreddit.

What I didn't tell her was I was totally distracted with her.

Vera

Vera showing me a pair of brass knuckles she had found in the attic above her new bedroom.

"I had a dream I was late to gym. And there was this like this guy in the locker and before I could scream he turned into a demon. He looked all gross with patches of skin that were festering with little hissing snake faces. But nobody but me could see any of this shit! And then, then I suddenly felt icy cold, like Riverdance was performing on my grave, Sam.

Anyways, I put my hands into my pockets," Vera said excitedly, pantomiming cold Vera putting her hands in her pockets. Her shoulders shuddered. It looked real.

"Then what happened," I asked thinking WTF thoughts.

"Then, Sam? Then, I found a pair of freakin' brass knuckles in my pocket. And while my fingers were trying to figure 'em out I feel their cold icy steel slide themselves around my fingers. And then, it's like they're part of my hands. And they're angry, like hangry angry but not for regular food..."

Vera was my age and had just moved from across town with her Mom into old Mrs. Crawford's Victorian across the street. Mrs. Crawford had died in an incident involving her adult daughters. We had never gotten the whole story because in our little town Mrs. Crawford was from a very old family that ran our town, from the courts, to law enforcement, to county contracts and the like. Mrs. Crawford had been old when we moved on to the block and I had only caught glimpses of her. That was until the paramedics carried her corpse out along with her second daughters and what looked like a black panther tail sticking out of a gurney.

At any rate, less than two weeks later the moving trucks arrived along with my new neighbor Vera and her Grandpa Doug. I had been outside by myself thinking about what douche nozzles my parents were for not getting me a guitar no matter how many times I asked.

"Maybe if someone gets their grades up.... Santa-", Mom started.

I didn't want to get triggered and end up on the naughty list so out to the street moved my feet. Right as The Mayflower moving truck, resplendently and hideously yellow rolled in. A young girl with a brunette bob-cut was riding shotgun. The truck belched to a stop in front of Mrs. Crawford's and the girl rolled the window down.

"Hey kid!" she said.

I looked up. She wasn't very friendly looking. She was actually kind of homely. But there was something in her black eyes.

"Yea?" I responded.

"You like music?" she asked.

I felt my head nod.

She looked at me appraisingly. She nodded like she might buy.

"Good," was all she said and then she and her grandpa began to unpack.

"You just gonna stand there, kid? Or are you gonna help me move these bodies?!" she asked giving me a bit of what my grandpa calls the stink eye.

"By the way, kid," she said. "You got a name?"

I told her mine. And vice-versa for Vera.

Three hours later Vera had sent me home with a peck on the cheek. She smelled a little like my Aunt Betty-Jo after she used to disappear to the bathroom to sneak a shot of vodka. Vera seemed a lot older than me even though we were born only 4 months apart.

"I like you, Sam," she said. The, "S," in my name sounded a little like she was shushing me.

I didn't really know what to say so I was pretty glad when my Dad told me to get in the house for dinner. For once, another night of crappy hot dogs and ketchup seemed okay with me.

Not all that many hours passed so that before I knew it I found myself a fixture in Vera's room with the sloped ceiling under the attic.

"...Then? Then, I found a pair of brass knuckles in my pocket. And while my fingers were trying to figure them out they suddenly slid themselves on to my hands."

I nodded trying to hold my tongue against its better judgment.

"And then I punched that demon right in its face and instead of blood pus and snakes and eels and maggots shot out of his mouth and nostrils. His eyes melted and two slithering nasty ass reptiles like the alien in Alien popped out. And I just kept beating the snakes out of him while all the snakes kept talking about crawfish. I think they were Cajun."

"Crawford," I said.

Vera gave me the stink eye. I knew what she meant so I told her all about Mrs. Crawford, the shooting and I left out the part with the panther tail. I'm not sure why but I just did.

"Was she in the dress business?" Vera asked, seriously.

"No. Why?"

"Cuz, I found like a guhzillion dress or coat hangars in the attic. Just that and the briefcase with brass knuckles. Wanna try them on?" she asked showing me them.

I shook my head slowly so she wouldn't miss it.

More stink eye peeked out.

"I'm trying to be peaceful this week," I said.

Vera gave me a strange look. I'd seen it before.

"You're a weird kid, Sam," she said.

"Everybody says that," I replied.

Holiday Weekend

And then there was Memorial Day this year. With Vera. When it all went tits up because Dad broke his word.

Vera and I sat across from Dad in the backyard under the Cherry Tree.

On the table was a giant tray of partially cooked hotdogs and a stack of discount white bread. There was a big jar of mayo and another of tartar sauce.

Vera and I looked at the spread suspiciously. "Dad," noticed.

"Eat your fuckin' dogs! You fucking ungrateful son of a bitch. And your little pretty girlfriend, too, goddammit!" I heard a voice that sounded like Dad's but not Dad's spew.

I felt myself get up on my hind feet. I felt my neck get hot. And then I did  something I never did before.

"Fuck you," I was shocked to hear myself say with not a little authority.

And then? Time stood still for a moment.

And then? Then, my Dad did something he never did before. He wound up and hit me. I saw a black pool approaching. It arrived like a fleet of stars eager to embrace me in their stellar emptiness. Then, the next thing I knew Vera was kneeling over me with a washcloth filled with ice cubes and an annoyed look on her face.

"Keep it pressed to your eye," she said.

"Where is he," I heard myself say.

"He stormed off," she said.

I nodded. It made me a little nauseous.

"Let's go back to my place, you're bleeding, Sam," she said.

I didn't put up a fight.

After Vera had managed to clean me up a bit we sat side by side on the edge of her bed.

"I can't believe my Dad did that to me! And those fucking hot dogs! What the fuck?! My Dad is a hot dog freak, relish, mustard, always talking about Joey Chestnut and Nathan's only, accept no substitutes! That ain't right."

"You're right," Vera said.

"Huh?"

"It's not your Dad. It wasn't your Mom. I mean it was but not really," she said looking a little distracted.

"Vera, you're not making any sense."

Vera gave me the stink eye.

"Fuck I need a hit. I can't wait any longer."

"What?"

Vera went into her sweatshirt pocket and came up with a vape.

Vera took a long pull and then look relieved. The device beeped eight times.

Vera let the vapor out slowly through her upturned nostrils and slightly parted cupid bow lips.

"Well, looks like we're getting to the end of the line, Sam."

"Vera," I said as calmly as I could. "You need to put those back before my Dad notices them missing and really beats me. I'm scared."

Vera took my head in both her hands.

"Look at me, Sam. You don't get it. There's something going on. That vape, it's not nicotine."

"Oh! Please don't tell me my Dad's become a stoner!"

The slap across my left cheek stung.

Vera turned towards me and grabbed my head in both hands and shook it slightly.

"It's not weed!"

"Crack?!? That would expl-"

This time I caught Vera's wrist and leaned back.

"Stop hitting! I need everybody to stop hitting me today! Okay!" I heard myself complaining loudly.

"Okay, Sam, look at me. I am going to have to show you. There's just no time and no other way."

"If you pull out those brass knuckles I'm leav-" I started.

Vera pulled the vape out. She gave me a defiant look and took a long drag. Her black eyebrows sunk convexly into a V shape. Then Vera did something she never did before. She grabbed me by the back of the head and then...

Then she kissed me.

It wasn't a normal kiss. Not that I would know since I never kissed anybody but my Mom and Grandma before. But I knew it wasn't normal because it took me somewhere. Actually, many somewheres. It felt like I had been launched by Nasa into the heart of a thousand suns and they all ended up back in my backyard. Back in my backyard, but the scene was always the same. A barbecue. But in some my Mom was there and Vera was not. In some my Dad wasn't there but my Mom and Vera were. And they were both smoking filterless cigarettes. And talking about garter belts and not being able to find stockings.

And then I felt a pain I won't even try to describe. It became one with me. Only there were many of me. Only each one was in more dire straits. And then, suddenly I was back.

Vera slapped me again. She came into focus slowly.

"Listen, Sam. We don't have a lot of time. I don't know what your Dad's been doing but he's one of the others. Like Mrs. Crawford having an octogenarian shootout with her fam. You see, in about an hour or two you're gonna get your first craving for the freekbar. Your vape will read, '**F-R-E-E-K-Z-B-A-R-1**'.

Now when it get's to **F-R-E-E-K-Z-B-A-R-9** you get replaced. And you gotta go somewhere. You gotta go somewhere forever to burn cause all 8 of you have been bad and there can only be one."

Vera reached into her pocket and pulled out a second vape.

It read, "**F-R-E-E-K-Z-B-A-R-0**," across the LED display. She pressed it into my hand.  "Just push the button and inhale when you can't take it anymore," Vera said slowly, with some effort. She looked pale.

You're going to go back there. To the other Crawfordville."

"Vera, you don't look so..." I began.

"Dummy. They're coming. The others. They can't hack it. It's unbreathable in some places. Dark winter in others-I gotta go, she's coming, Sam-Oh, god!"

"Vera, you're scaring me," I said.

And then the color simply returned to Vera's face like the prodigal daughter. Her entire demeanor changed.

Ruddy Vera took a deep breath.

"Fuck, air! Real fucking air!"

Then she looked at me.

"What's the high-sign, Sam?"

I stared blankly.

A look fell over Vera's face like a shadow. And then she kissed me.

"Enjoy the air while you can, Sam," Vera who was not quite Vera said ominously, going through her pockets.

She saw the vape she gave me on the bed next to me.

A cold smile froze upon her face.

"You better keep that thing handy if you don't want a bad time, Sam."

And then Vera punched me in the face, got up and said, "I'm going out for a pack of cigarettes. Just wait for the beep!" And then Vera began to laugh. Not a happy laugh. It was the laugh of someone In The Know but what she knew was definitely too much.

Sure enough, just like Vera said not too long ago I felt an urge I had never known could exist. My hand instinctively felt for the vape in my pocket. My eye socket was throbbing.

It must have been some weed I thought. I just got to build up a little tolerance. Maybe tomorrow- And then I doubled over. Every ounce of my being wanted a hit. And I took it. And the Vape device LED display beeped exactly once. The LED incremented itself reading: **F-R-E-E-K-Z-B-A-R-1**.

....

**F-R-E-E-K-Z-B-A-R-8**

***Wait for the beep...***

And now we seem to have come full circle back to the beginning of my end. Another few hours have passed in indescribable agony only broken up by each successive hit taking me to other words filled with others who are the same but not the same. My ribosomes are writhing and radiating out one message; suffer and suffocate and yield to the other, Sam(s) or die craving that hit.

I guess I have an addictive personality. 

I watched my eighth hit enunciate through the dust mote rush hour into a series of concentric vape rings in time with the eight beeps that all gained on one another before swallowing one another up alive; motes, beeps and all.

After that hit I had seen myself though a mirror reflecting nothing but the ruins of what looked like my hometown, Crawfordville. And then again, I was somewhere else too, and somewhere else again before finding myself back in my bloodied, bruised and discombobulated contusions nest of an excuse for a head.

I gotta go cold turkey. It's been three hours now curled up in the fetal position. The sweats are worse and now I am having stomach cramps and dry heaves. I can feel Vera giving me the stinky eye. I can feel the air getting thin. I can feel another Sam gaining on me.
