Yeah. Brazil. Y'know, *Samba, football, beaches*? Well, if you've been there you probably know it's absolutely beautiful! I should know I am Brazilian, born and bred.

Obviously we get some bad press, violence in the bigger cities, poverty, drugs... I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but it's massively blown out of proportion by your odd *gringo* who thinks it's an anthropological experience to hike up the *favela* in Rio and risk getting their brand new phone stolen. 

What most people don't realize though is that Brazil is a huge country. Bigger than the contiguous USA, and yet all people think about when they hear Brazil is what I said before: *Samba, football, beaches*. Every once in a while you get that one smart alec chiming in to say something about either bikinis, or brazilian butt lifts. Yeah, we have those too, but in between the beaches and the butt lifts Brazil has a lot to offer.

You've likely heard all about the Amazon Rainforest, the biggest and most biodiverse trapical rainforest in the world. But, have you heard about the *Cerrado*? I didn't think so. It's the most biodiverse tropical savannah in the world, and yet not many people even know about its existence. Then again, so many people still think our capital is either Rio or Sao Paulo.

Well, our story takes place around the actual capital, Brasília, in the middle of the Cerrado. When I was younger my dad worked for one of the UN agencies in the city, a foreigner, he married my mom in his third year in the country and decided to stay. He bought a plot of land a little ways outside the city and built a fairly large house on a hill overlooking a small creek. 

The house was amazing if only a little out of place. Built among the shrubbery and twisted trees common to the Cerrado. It was the only house for a good distance, and my dad decided to build it in a style reminiscent of his home country. 

The result was that it stuck out like a sore thumb. 

Imagine walking around a Brazilian Savannah, miles away from any civilization, and you find what looks to be a miniaturized Dutch canal house. But then, my dad's always been a bit eccentric.

Where most upper-middle class Brazilians would insist on hiring help to tend the garden or clean the house, my dad insisted on doing it all himself. "*Nou"* he'd say in the thick dutch accent he always denied having "A man should know how to do these things himself". 

I was always too scared about being in the garden. Something just always felt off to me there. No life for miles, and yet, it always felt a little too loud for me: cicadas, birds, and the odd howler monkey screams made it too scary for a fragile kid like me. So I'd avoid it, as best I could. I never really got what my dad like about it anyway, he'd always come back inside dirty, clothes ripped where plant thorns caught the threads, and just stinking of sweat all over. But, without fail, whenever he did come inside he'd still prod me to come along. Said there was something magical about working in the garden and again: "A man should know how to do these things himself". 

  
One can only take so much prodding so, at some point I relented.

  
I went with him into the garden. At to no one's surprise at all, I hated every minute of it. He'd ask me to help, and in that all-too-familiar dad way would scream at me that I was doing it wrong, the heat was sweltering, and the air was abuzz with the sounds of the savannah ringing in my ears. I wanted to stop as soon as we started, but my dad would always pull me back into his gardening shenanigans. 

Now I'm sure a lot of you are thinking we were just cutting grass, or tending to some flowerbeds. That's partially true, but in the Cerrado we have a few extra concerns. Primarily, what we had been out there to do revolved around trimming our home security system: a tight knit fence of briars whose thorns were as big as a baby's fingers.

  
I was never sure what they were there for. I used to joke that if any thief made there way to *our* house he probably deserved to take whatever was inside. But as it turns out, the briars were never meant to keep people outside. My dad said his biggest concern were the animals outside the fence. I get that. Between stray dogs, and jaguars, there was a lot to be scared of, I just didn't realize how much.

  
As we worked on the briars I tried to keep my head down at whatever I was doing. We'd spend hours on the same branches seemingly with no progress at all. Every once in a while I'd hear my dad comment on something, the quality of my work, whatever I was doing wrong, and the odd joke about something completely unrelated to the task at hand. At some point he stopped talking, I guessed he got to a particularly complicated network of branches because all I could hear, were his grunts as he pulled on his handsaw, up-and-down, to-and-fro... 

Soon enough I could only hear the sounds of the cerrado echoing through the air. I must've been completely engulfed by the work, because when I finally did look up, my dad was nowhere to be seen, neither was the house for that matter. I'd seemingly walked further into the wilderness, though I had barely any recollection of having done so. 

But in looking up I was caught by a wave of confusion: How had I come this far without knowing, and how was I going to get home now?

The briars I had been working on were still standing behind me, blocking out the waning sun. I could only guess, but it seemed at the time, that nightfall drew near. 

I thought dad would probably come looking for me soon, so I was in no rush to lose myself even further in the wilderness. I decided to stay put, I sat down where I was and tried to find ways to pass the time. I counted how many animals I could hear. Cicadas, 1, a barking dog, 2, a whistling marmoset 3... I played this game for long enough for whatever little light there was when I first got to this place to be completely gone by the time I counted my 6th animal. All the better, I couldn't identify it anyway. It made this sort of whooshing sound almost as if it were the wind. The only way I could even tell it wasn't the wind, was by the fact it sounded too manmade. I even thought it was Dad playing a prank on me, if only for a second. But no, I was alone.

  
It was dark, I was alone, and I was scared.

  
And then it happened. At first it was a distant light, weaving through the trees like it was swimming. As it got closer I could make out what it was a large silver colored deer. A Stag, with antlers like the branches of the briars I had been sawing hours ago. It was beautiful, it shone as though it produced its own light.

At first it didn't seem to notice me, it kept moving as though it was the only animal in the whole world. But when it finally caught sight of me its movements became more unnatural. In an instant it went from a far away sight, to being right next to me. It's light went from a joyful bouncing in the distance to an oppressive blinding flash right in front of me. But I couldn't stop staring. It was beautiful. It seemed to take stock of me, but just as it came, it went. Disappeared, without a trace, and I was alone again.

As I fell asleep, I dreamt of the creature again, gliding between the trees as if I weren’t really there. And when I woke up, I was back home. Dad was shaking my shoulder, saying I’d fallen off the rickety ladder while trimming the briars and knocked myself out. According to him, everything I’d seen was nothing more than a dream brought on by heat and a bump on the head.

Cut to last summer. I was deep into my PhD research on Indigenous cultures of the Amazon when I saw the light again. This time it stayed at a distance, drifting between the trees, but I recognized it instantly: the same deer-like figure from all those years before. It lingered for a moment, then vanished as quietly as it had appeared.

The next morning, I asked one of my interviewees, an elderly Mawé tribesman, if he had ever heard of such a thing.

“Anhangá,” he said. “The tormenter of the dead.”

And in that moment, I realized something I’d pushed aside for years:  
I don’t think I merely passed out on that ladder.
