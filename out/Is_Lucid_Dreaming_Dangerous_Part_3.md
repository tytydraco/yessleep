Hello Reddit,

I’m posting the last entry written in my son’s dream journal.

It takes place the very next day after the last entry in my last post. It's dated the night before his coma began, so this will be as far as his journal takes us. I’m thankful for all of you who’ve messaged me and left any comments on my previous posts. Helpful or not, it’s just nice knowing that you guys are giving this stuff some thought too.

This will be my last post containing dream entries, but it won’t be my last post on nosleep. I’ll give you all an update in a few days just to let you all know how my son’s doing.

However, in regard to the entry you’re about to read, I would say this is the one that disturbed me most.

This entry is the one that convinced me there was something deeper going on.

I remember the night he had this dream; I had to take him to urgent care the following morning. The doctors assured me that he was okay but told me to come back if it happened again. Knowing what I know now, I can only wish I pressed the issue more.

I think if there are any signs of an illness, it would be most apparent in this entry; so please, if you guys have any theories or opinions, please don’t hesitate to leave them in the comments. There’s been little to no progress towards finding a diagnosis since my first post, so really, anything helps.

**12/20/24 Entry#45 Mom’s in Trouble (lucid nightmare)**

I had another lucid dream tonight; I’ve never had two in a row before. This one was a nightmare though, I’m actually writing this at 4AM right now because I can’t go back to sleep.

I think what’s bothering me the most right now is thinking about mom.

I know when I first read about the demonology stuff, and the stuff about getting your skin taken, and the astral projection and all that, I thought it was funny, but now I’m for real scared.

It could be just because it’s still nighttime, and I just woke up from a nightmare, but I’m genuinely really scared. If all that stuff I read online is somehow true, then mom is in serious trouble.

I don’t really mess with all that supernatural stuff, but like, I can’t stop thinking… What if mom’s soul is somehow trapped behind that door with that demon.

I know I know, it’s stupid, but I’m just writing down my thoughts as honest and unfiltered as possible. I know that when morning comes, I’m probably gonna cringe thinking about how scared I am right now. I’m probably tripping, I think that that nightmare just really messed me up, that’s all.

Anyways, this is how it went. I did FILD like I do every night, but it worked unexpectedly. I had sleep paralysis.

I was surprised for a couple seconds cause it’s never worked two nights in a row, but I quickly got back on track. I did SPILD and sat up off my bed. I thought about mom, and sure enough, the door appeared.

I stood in front of it feeling very unprepared, I didn’t think I’d have to see this door for another week or so, but I reminded myself that the sooner I could get to mom the better. FILD decided to work tonight, so there was nothing for me to do but to open the door.

I kept telling myself these things, but the fear didn’t go away.

Again, there was no swing set sound, which for some reason made me feel even more anxious.

I started to think horrible things like,

“what if I open the door and the demon is standing right there? What if I get trapped behind the door and I can’t make it back to my body? What if I get my skin taken? What if imagining all these scenarios makes them come true?” 

I stood there for a solid 5 minutes without doing anything.

I started to get angry at myself for being too scared to make a move. I called myself a wuss, marched up to the door, reached my hand toward the handle, but then got too scared and backed away again. I was like,

“Omg what’s wrong with me! Just do it already!”

I started to think that I should’ve given dad some kind of heads up or slept in his room or something so that I’d at least have the assurance that he’d wake me up if anything went wrong, but I didn’t think I’d get a lucid dream tonight, so it makes sense that I didn’t say anything to him.

I paused and was like,

“Good point”

then I started rationalizing and saying stuff like,

“this really isn’t safe, I should just try again tomorrow, but make sure to give dad a heads up. FILD worked 2 nights in a row, who’s to say it won’t work a 3rd time?” 

Then I remembered how badly I wanted to see her after getting the news of her death. I also thought about that nightmare I had, and what mom said to me. I told her that I was trying to find her, how is saying I’ll do it tomorrow trying to find her?

I felt like a coward, I felt ashamed, but I finally found my resolve. I walked up to the door, and I opened it.

I stared into the blackness and took a deep breath. I imagined a flashlight in my hand, and I stepped forward.

As I passed through the door frame into the blackness, it felt like I was rising above the clouds. It’s hard to explain, but it was like a fog had just cleared.

The feeling was so strong that I thought I’d accidentally woken up.

I looked down to count my fingers, and there were 10. I counted a second time, still 10.

I suddenly felt aware of the temperature, which has never happened in any of my lucid dreams before. It was cold, and the air around me felt thin and damp. I distinctly remember the smell of dirt and rain, kinda like the smell of a forest. I thought the ground was wet at first, but it wasn’t, it was just really cold compared to my bedroom floor.

Another weird feeling I noticed was that it felt like I didn’t have to stay focused to maintain my lucidity. It felt like no amount of excitement could wake me up, like I was fully locked in. My feet felt grounded on the floor, and my mind was clear and steady. It didn’t feel like a dream anymore if that makes sense. Like if it weren’t for what I saw around me, I would actually think I was awake.

My eyes were beginning to adjust, and I saw where I was. I was standing in a narrow cave.

The walls were gray stone, and had a mix of smooth and jagged areas. It was very dark, and I had about 6 feet of room above me and to my sides; but shining my flashlight ahead, I could see the ceiling get lower and the walls get closer together.

I couldn’t help but notice that the shadows my flashlight caused looked very realistic. I was impressed by the level of detail my brain was generating; this was the most realistic dream I’d ever had. I remember saying to myself something like,

“This dream is actually crazy”.

Looking ahead, the ceiling dipped down in certain places and the walls had a lot of concave areas, which left many corners for something to hide behind.

I heard the sound of my own footsteps echoing down the cave, and I knew I had to move forward, there was nowhere else to go. I looked behind me to make sure the door was still open but quickly faced forward again. I didn’t wanna take my eyes off the open cave in front of me.

Staring down into the blackness, my eyes started playing tricks on me.

I kept imagining seeing movement, like something was coming right at me, but nothing ever happened. I knew I was just scared, I could feel myself shaking slightly.

Suddenly, I had an idea to imagine a string of lights going down the cave, lighting the whole thing up. I felt relieved remembering that I have power to do anything in my dream.

I focused hard and tried imagining bright light bulbs about 6 feet apart strung along the ceiling and walls, but… nothing happened.

I tried again and it didn’t work. I tried other things like imagining myself carrying a bucket of torches that I could place as I went along or changing the entire cave into a well-lit hallway, but nothing I did worked.

I tried a few more times before concluding that this cave had the same resistance to my imagination that the door itself had. I couldn’t destroy the door or make it disappear, and I also seemed to have no power once I stepped inside of it.

I felt a sense of panic run up my spine, but I quickly reminded myself that I wasn’t gonna let anything stop me. I tried walking, but just barely shuffled forward, my body didn’t want to move. I told myself to just start with baby steps, and I moved forward very slowly, constantly checking all my blind spots.

The further I moved from the doorway the more unsettled I felt. I felt extremely exposed and vulnerable.

The cave was getting narrower, and I had to start crouching slightly to avoid the dips in the ceiling.

As I went on, I got a little braver, and I started to move a little more confidently.

I put my hand on the wall for support and felt a cold draft run up my shirt, I was drenched in sweat. I put my arm back against my side to stay warm and continued forward.

I almost hit my head on a rock that poked out from the ceiling, so I crouched down lower.

Every time I came across a concave portion of the wall, I shined my light on it first, checked it twice, then moved past it. The paranoia was beginning to take over.

It felt like I was moving for a really long time, and I was getting very uneasy. I started worrying about things like getting lost or running out of oxygen.

I decided to try checking my watch.

I had low expectations, but I shined my light on my wrist anyway. I looked and the time said 3:23AM. When I saw that I was like,

“Huh,”

It was a pretty realistic time for my brain to come up with, I checked again expecting to see some wacky numbers, but it still said 3:23AM.

I stared at it, and blinked constantly trying to see if the numbers would randomly change, but it didn’t.

After about a minute passed, it changed to 3:24AM.

I don’t know what was up with my brain tonight, but this was definitely the most detailed lucid dream ever. I was impressed, but also very disturbed.

When I looked back up, the anxiety came over me again. I checked over my shoulder and was glad that I could still see the light of the door. That door was my way back to my body; it was my lifeline, and I didn’t want to get too far from it.

The last thing I wanted was a fork in the cave, I didn’t want to have to remember any turns on the way back and risk getting lost.

Thankfully there were no turns; unfortunately, though, there was something worse.

The cave was just beginning to get wider, and I was getting the feeling that I was getting close to some kind of destination. I had hope that this would be it, and that the cave wasn’t too long because I could still see the doorway behind me.

I started to move a little more quickly until I saw something that made my heart sink.

I stopped dead in my tracks and extended my flashlight far out in front of me so that the light could reach as far as possible.

I tried imagining that my flashlight was brighter so that I could make the light reach farther, but then I remembered that as long as I was in the cave I had no control over the dream.

I didn’t know yet what I was looking at, but I wasn’t gonna take any chances. My heart started pounding extra hard in my chest, and my mind began imagining horrifying things.

I crouched in a position that was ready to run, and I very slowly and carefully moved forward. My flashlight could only light up about 20 feet in front of me; anything past that was pure darkness.

At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, and that I was only seeing a shadow, but the closer I moved toward it, the surer I became that it wasn’t an illusion.

There was something dark hanging from the ceiling of the cave ahead of me. It was long and narrow, but it didn’t look like a person, my light was able to shine through it at certain points. I really had no idea what it was, my first thought was that it was some enormous hairy bat hanging upside down, but it looked more like a curtain or a bedsheet of some kind.

If I thought it was something dangerous, I would’ve turned around and ran, but whatever it was, it wasn’t moving at all.

I couldn’t see what it was hanging from, whatever it was attached to, it was hidden behind one of the dips in the ceiling.

Honestly, I don’t know how I didn’t recognize it sooner.

When I was about 10 feet from it, I got blasted with the smell of gasoline, and only then did it finally occur to me what I was looking at.

Coming down from the ceiling was long black hair. The head the hair was coming from was hidden behind the bulky rocks of the ceiling, but I knew it belonged to the demon.

Unfortunately, I realized it too late, and I was standing way too close.

The hair began to sway and slowly move downward.

I turned to run away so fast that I banged my elbow rlly hard against the wall. The pain clouded my head for a second, and I ended up bumping into the other side of the cave wall. I was already running so fast that I bounced off the wall and tumbled to the ground.

Somehow, I was able to keep a firm grip on my flashlight.

I let out a desperate scream, scrambled back to my feet and kept running.

My chest and legs started to get all tingly from the adrenaline. I wasn’t being careful, and I almost ran into the wall again.

I told myself to calm down and focus, and I slowed down a little, and that’s when I realized it.

I hadn’t moved closer to the door at all.

It was still this barely visible rectangle of light far down the tunnel. I checked over my shoulder to make sure I wasn’t being chased then started jogging toward the door again. The path wasn’t getting any shorter, and the door wasn’t getting any closer, I was stuck.

I stopped to catch my breath and faced back forward toward the darkness. I caught my breath, but my mind was still running wild. I had no more motivation to go back down the cave, I just wanted to wake up now, but I couldn’t reach the door.

I was scared; I didn’t want to face whatever was down there. I continued to back pedal toward the doorway, keeping my eyes firmly fixed on the darkness in front of me, but still didn’t get any closer.

I was panicking, I started whispering to myself,

“no no no please don’t be stuck, please let me get to the door, I don’t wanna be stuck here please let me out of here please.” 

I wanted to scream, but I didn’t wanna let the demon know where I was. I felt like it was looking for me, and I needed to stay quiet.

I kept backpedaling toward the door, but it wasn’t changing anything. I couldn’t leave, I was trapped, I had no options. There was actually nothing I could do; I had to move forward.

Weirdly enough though, having no choice but to face my fears seemed to have an effect on me.

I don’t know why, but I actually felt the slightest bit of courage well up inside of me. It was like my body recognized that fear couldn’t help me in that situation and that all I could do was move toward the danger.

Don’t get me wrong, I was still terrified, and if I was given the chance to escape, I ‘d run immediately. I’m just saying that I thought I would respond to a situation like that by curling up and crying, but for some reason, I didn’t. I thought to myself,

“If I can’t make it to mom, the least I can do is let her know I came for her”

It took everything for me to do this, but I opened my mouth and yelled as loud as I could

“MOM!!!”

I heard it echo down the cave, and I cringed in fear.

I was fully expecting to hear footsteps racing down the cave toward me, and I braced myself for it, but I didn’t hear anything. A few seconds passed, then to my surprise I heard mom’s voice from the other end say,

“Son? Is that you?”

It was her, I heard her loud and clear, I actually found her!

I started running down the cave, calling out as I went,

“Yes! It’s me, mom! I’m coming! Where are you?” 

Her voice wasn’t far, I knew I was close to her.

I kept both arms out as I ran so I could feel the walls and ceiling to protect my head. My hopes were through the roof, I couldn’t believe I found her. If I could get to her before the demon, we could leave, and I wouldn’t have to ever come back here again.

I ran for only about 10 seconds before I could smell it again. It was like I ran directly into a cloud of gas; it was very strong.

My heart sank, that smell meant it was close.

I stopped abruptly and focused hard on what was in front of me. The feeling of dread was twisting inside of me.

I knew what was coming, I’d been ambushed.

I tried to take a breath, but I could barely inhale. The smell made me nauseous; I had to hold back a gag.

I waited and listened for the sound of a footstep or a breath. I heard neither; instead, under the sound of my own heart pounding, I heard something sliding across the floor toward me.

It was moving incredibly fast; I didn’t have much time to think.

I turned around and ran the other direction back to the doorway. I wasn’t getting any closer, but I kept running anyway.

It was gaining on me.

I quickly looked over my shoulder and saw something dark moving across the floor toward my ankles.

I screamed as I ran, it was right behind me now. My back tensed up as I prepared to be attacked.

Suddenly, however, I felt that rubber band feeling all over my body pulling me toward the door. I didn’t know until later where it came from, but I was lifted off my feet and yanked toward the door rlly fast.

It was rlly quick, I got pulled through the door and straight into my body.

I woke up to my dad holding me up by my shoulders in my bed. He looked very concerned, and he asked me what was wrong and if I was okay.

I was shaken up, so I had to take a minute to calm myself down. I was covered in sweat, and I couldn’t stop shaking.

When I did eventually calm down, I told him that I had a nightmare, but that didn’t seem to explain it enough for him. He said he heard me groaning in my sleep, so he came in to wake me, but I didn’t wake up. He said he was trying to wake me up for nearly a minute before I opened my eyes.

I didn’t know what to tell him, that’s never happened to me before. He told me he’d take me to urgent care in the morning to see if there was anything wrong.

I went to go take a shower, but before I did that, I went downstairs to get some water, and you won’t believe what I saw.

The clock said 3:34AM…

you know how I checked my watch in my dream and it said 3:23AM? With how much time passed since dad woke me up, my watch in my dream was actually spot on with real time.

I was so amazed by this that I ran upstairs to tell dad. I wish I didn’t tell him, it just seemed to make him more worried.

I decided not to tell him about the rest of the nightmare. He’s leaving for a work trip later today, and I told him I’d be fine by myself. I don’t want him to feel like he has to stay back because of me. I’m glad I wrote about it here though, cause this is definitely one I wanna remember.

I took my shower then attempted to go back to sleep in dad's room.

My elbow hurt really bad; I’m assuming I bumped it in my sleep. 

I was wide awake thinking about mom and my nightmare. I laid there for like 20 minutes and then decided to just stay up and write this.

I don’t have school tomorrow so I’ll be fine. Now that I wrote the whole thing out, I definitely feel better, but I know it’s not over.

Tonight was the closest I’ve gotten to seeing mom; she was my whole reason for starting this in the first place. If I don’t go back to get her, this will all have been for nothing. Right now, I really don’t want to go back, but I know I need to. Hopefully I will feel more motivated tomorrow night.
