When I was very young, probably about six years old, my grandmother was telling me about her brother, George, who used to live in Sydney. I had never met Great Uncle George.

I had met Great Uncle Edward and his insufferable wife Enid. She was one of those “devout” Christians who was anything but Christian. I’ve met genuine Christians. They have a lovely warm kindness to them. She was sour and completely humourless. I joked with her once that I was a spoilt child and she tilted her head and said, ‘By spoilt, do you mean ruined?’ How the hell am I meant to know, lady! I’m six!

So, I was keen to find out whether my other great uncle was out there and had a much nicer wife with a sense of humour. I realised that Grandma had said that Great Uncle George “lived” in Sydney. So, I asked her where he lived now. She told me that he had died of influenza a long time ago. I didn’t really know what influenza was at that time, but I figured it wasn’t good if you could die from it.

When I was about eleven years old, I remembered this conversation at a time when I had a better understanding of what influenza was. I knew people still contracted it, but there was minimal talk about people dying from it. The only ones I ever heard succumbing to the illness were old people. Given that Great Uncle George died “a long time ago” I assumed he hadn’t been that old.

So, I asked my mother about George and how he had died. She confirmed that he had died of influenza. When I mentioned the rarity of dying from influenza now, I thought she was going to say that he had just contracted a very bad case. But instead, she said that he died during an influenza pandemic that swept the world many years ago and killed millions of people.

I didn’t understand what a pandemic was. All I understood was that lots of people had died from it and that George was one of them. I felt very sad, thinking about him being so sick and away from his brother and sister and then dying without seeing them again.

When I was 30 years old, I had a most peculiar dream. Nothing about the dream made me think of Great Uncle George or the pandemic.

In the dream, people everywhere were getting sick. Really sick. Some people were dying so there was a lot of angst and fear about whatever was killing them. It was something you caught. The sickness was spread by a misty substance that rolled down off mountains into the cities. If the mist touched you, you got sick and were most likely going to die.

I was in my city one day and I looked up at nearby mountains to see the mist starting to roll down in my direction. People started screaming and running for their homes. My first thought was to ring my father and warn him that the mist was approaching. I ran to the nearest payphone and dialled his number. Just as he answered, I looked down and saw the mist swirling around my feet. I blacked out.

Still in the dream, I came back to consciousness slowly. I realised that I was in a hospital ward. It was the old style of ward with beds in long rows and lots of nurses in white dresses running around tending to people. But with the influx of so many patients, the rows had become chaotic and there were beds wherever staff could put them.

I looked around and saw that many of the beds had sheets that were covered in large splashes of blood. I was gripped with fear, thinking that these were the beds of people who had died. The bloodied beds were everywhere. That’s when I woke up.

About ten years later, I came across an old book at a second-hand bookshop. It was called *The Plague of the Spanish Lady* by Richard Collier. The inner sleeve of the hardback started as follows:

“Little has been written to describe comprehensively the pandemic of influenza that slaughtered more than twenty-one million people between October, 1918 and January, 1919. Comparable in its ferocity only with the Black Death of the Middle Ages, the disease struck world-wide within a three-month period, with such devastation that fit men could drop dead in the street without warning and the medical world came seriously to fear the end of civilisation.”

I was utterly intrigued by this description. I was even more intrigued when I realised that this was the influenza pandemic that my grandmother and mother had been referring to. I was keen to discover more about the sickness that had killed so many people, including my great uncle.

It was a fascinating book and was certainly a lesson for me to take the 2020 pandemic very seriously when it started around 14 years later. But there was something else I got out of the book that I wasn’t expecting. The chills.

When I got to the part that dealt with treating the sickness and the people who contracted influenza and had survived it, there was a strange correlation amongst some survivors. Some of those who had been close to succumbing to the sickness, but had lived, had done so after experiencing horrific nose bleeds.

I stopped reading at this point. I couldn’t keep going. My brain was doing gymnastics trying to connect some dots. And then it hit me. My dream. The hospital beds. The blood on the sheets.

The flesh on my arms came up in goosebumps and I went cold all over. I knew next to nothing about the 1919 pandemic. My grandmother and mother only told me that it had happened. Almost everything I learned about it, I read in Richard Collier’s book.

Co-incidentally, Richard Collier died in 1996, the same year I had the dream. A dream that came out of nowhere ten years before I read that book, connecting me to a relative who died before my parents were even born. A man who had possibly not had the good fortune to have a nosebleed.
