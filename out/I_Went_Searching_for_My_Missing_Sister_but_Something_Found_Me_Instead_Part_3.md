After that night at Mirror Pool, everything changed.

 

I thought maybe the terror would fade, that Eli and I would laugh it off eventually, treat it like a bad horror movie experience. But whatever presence I’d disturbed at the lake seemed to have followed me back. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched—not just when I looked in mirrors or glass, but from everywhere. My own reflection seemed to haunt me, just at the edge of my vision.

 

At first, I saw her only faintly: a flicker in windows or darkened screens, a shape that disappeared if I looked too closely. Then it became more intense—moments where, just for an instant, I was sure I’d locked eyes with her. She was no longer just a figure I saw in passing. She felt real, and she was growing closer.

 

I called Eli, desperate for someone to talk to about this. He didn’t pick up, and I can’t say I blamed him. He’d sent me one voicemail after that night: “Whatever happened out there… I don’t wanna be a part of it, okay? I don’t know what you stirred up, but it’s not right. Just… don’t call me anymore.”

 

I was on my own.

 

Over the next few days, I found myself obsessively combing through Evelyn’s old journals, hoping for anything to explain what was happening to me. Most entries were her usual diary ramblings—notes on friendships, family drama, sketches of Mirror Pool and the forest. Then, buried in the middle, I found an entry that stopped me cold: *“The lake reflects more than just faces. It reflects what we hide, what we want, what we fear.”*

 

The words felt like a warning. Beneath the entry, she had drawn a pair of eyes, blank and staring, like they could see through the page. Somehow, they reminded me of the girl I’d seen in the reflection.

 

That night, I couldn’t stand to look at myself. I draped towels and sheets over every reflective surface in my room—the mirror, the glass of the window, even my phone screen. But it was useless. My dreams were full of Mirror Pool. I was back at the lake, standing alone on the shore. My reflection stared back at me, but it wasn’t me. It was her—smiling with a slow, eerie grin. Her lips moved as if whispering, but I couldn’t hear the words. She raised her hand and motioned for me to come closer. My feet felt rooted in place, my body numb and unresponsive as she drew me in with her empty, unblinking eyes.

 

I jolted awake, heart racing, drenched in sweat. For a moment, as my eyes adjusted, I could have sworn I saw her—the shape of my reflection standing at the end of my bed, watching me. But when I blinked, she was gone.

 

The next day, I knew I needed help. I couldn’t go to my family or friends. I’d sound insane. I remembered a poster I’d seen once at the local coffee shop for the Paranormal Society. It was a small group that met once a week in the back room, mostly for people interested in ghost stories and urban legends. I had to try.

 

That evening, I sat at the back table in the coffee shop, waiting nervously as a few people filed in. There were five in total—three older folks who seemed more interested in swapping stories, a young guy with headphones around his neck who seemed bored, and a woman in her thirties who took her seat quietly in the corner, her gaze thoughtful and observant. Her name was Mara.

 

As the others chatted, Mara looked over at me, her gaze sharp, like she could already see something different about me. Taking a deep breath, I told them my story—about Evelyn, Mirror Pool, and the reflection that didn’t seem to be my own. As I spoke, Mara’s eyes never left me. She listened without interrupting, not laughing or dismissing anything I said, even when I described seeing my reflection standing by my bed.

 

When I finished, Mara leaned forward, her voice low but intense. “You need to be careful,” she said, glancing around to make sure the others weren’t listening. “Mirror Pool… I’ve heard of it. It’s old—older than this town, older than any maps. People say it’s not just a lake. It’s a boundary.”

 

“A boundary?” I asked, my voice trembling.

 

“Between us and… well, things that shouldn’t be crossed over.” She spoke as if choosing her words carefully, like she was holding back. “When you look into Mirror Pool, you’re not just seeing your own reflection. You’re seeing something deeper. Some call it your ‘shadow self.’ Others say it’s a glimpse into your soul, or a version of yourself that lives beyond the surface. But if that reflection has found you, then it’s no longer just a vision. It’s reached into our world. And that’s… dangerous.”

 

Her words sent a chill through me, but there was something about the way she was looking at me that made me wonder. I felt she wasn’t telling me everything.

 

“So… what can I do?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

 

Mara hesitated, then leaned even closer. “There’s a ritual,” she said quietly. “It’s risky, but if done right, it’s meant to sever the connection between you and the reflection. You’ll have to go back to the lake… alone. And you’ll need to face her directly. No matter what she does, don’t speak back.”

 

I swallowed hard, the thought of going back to Mirror Pool making my stomach twist. “And if it doesn’t work?”

 

Mara didn’t answer right away. Instead, she looked at me with an expression I couldn’t read, her eyes dark and intense. “Let’s just say… make sure you know what you’re up against. Not every spirit wants to go back to where it came from.”

 

With Mara’s instructions, I prepared myself as best as I could. She’d given me a simple chant to repeat, a binding phrase she claimed would force the reflection back into the lake. She’d also told me that if anything felt *off*—if the reflection changed in any way or I felt a sense of dread—I should stop immediately and leave.

 

As dusk fell, I drove back to Mirror Pool, Mara’s instructions echoing in my mind. The woods were silent, and a heavy stillness hung in the air as I reached the lake. Mirror Pool looked darker than I remembered. The water was pitch black, like a void, its surface unusually calm and flat. I knelt at the water’s edge, whispering the chant Mara had taught me, watching my reflection take form in the dark water.

 

And there she was. My shadow self, staring back at me with eyes that seemed somehow sharper, more alive than before. She wasn’t smiling this time. Her face was set, angry, like I’d disturbed something she didn’t want interrupted.

 

I kept chanting, my voice steady as I forced myself to hold her gaze. Then, slowly, her hand rose from beneath the water, her fingers reaching toward me, breaking the surface with a ripple. My voice wavered as she stretched closer, her hand almost brushing mine.

 

Everything in me screamed to turn and run, but I forced myself to keep chanting, the words rolling off my tongue like a lifeline. Suddenly, a cold pressure gripped my wrist, and I felt a pull, like she was trying to drag me down. Panic surged, and my voice cracked. But I kept going, repeating Mara’s words, willing her to let go.

 

Finally, the grip loosened. The water stilled, her face fading back into the blackness. For a long, tense moment, I knelt there, breathing heavily, staring at the empty water.

 

It felt like it was over.

 

But when I got back to my car, I had the unsettling feeling that something was wrong. Mara’s last words echoed in my mind, the look in her eyes when she’d handed me the ritual instructions. She had seemed almost… satisfied. Like she’d known exactly what would happen.

 

It’s been a few days since that night, and while I haven’t seen the reflection again, there’s something… off. When I catch my reflection in mirrors now, it feels like it’s watching me with a strange intensity, almost like it’s *waiting*.

 

And sometimes, late at night, I feel eyes on me, a sensation too familiar to ignore. I can only hope it’s over—but a part of me can’t shake the feeling that Mara hasn’t told me everything.
