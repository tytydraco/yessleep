I’ve never told anyone about this before. Sleep paralysis is something people know about—it’s not some fringe thing. Plenty of people believe in it, understand that sensation of waking up paralyzed, unable to scream or move. But what I went through as a teenager felt different. It wasn’t just that I couldn’t move; it was the presence, *her*—the sleep paralysis demon that came back again and again. It wasn’t a vague shadow or a figment of my imagination. She was always there, lingering in the darkest corner of my mind, and her visits left a mark I can’t forget.

It sounds ridiculous now, but when I was alone in the basement, where my bedroom was, it felt terrifyingly real. I’d wake up, unable to move, and everything would be silent except for the rush of blood in my ears. At first, I’d try to shake it off, hoping it was just another episode. But then I’d feel it—that sense that something else was in the room with me.

I’d see it, creeping in the shadows at the edge of my vision. Slowly, I’d force myself to look toward the open doorway. And there, almost crawling around the corner, came the old woman.

She was naked, her skin slack and sagging from her bones, paper-thin and gray. Her eyes—or where her eyes should have been—were just black, empty pits. She didn’t blink. She didn’t speak. She just stared, hollow and endless, and each step she took was slow, deliberate. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t run. I was trapped in my own body, forced to watch as she dragged herself closer, step by agonizing step, across the room.

Sometimes I’d manage to scream myself awake and she’d disappear, but not always. On the worst nights, she would make it all the way across the room, standing just by the side of my bed. But instead of climbing up to me, instead of reaching for me, she’d bend—her spine cracking as she lowered herself—and crawl under my bed. I would hold my breath, praying that she wouldn’t pull me down into the darkness with her. But the silence after she vanished below was suffocating, and I knew she was still there, waiting.

And that was the worst part. Knowing she was down there. When I’d finally snap awake, fully conscious and able to move, I couldn’t bring myself to get out of bed. Because I knew—I knew—she’d still be under there, waiting for me.

It happened over and over. Some nights I’d escape her, other nights she’d make it under the bed, always leaving me trapped in my own mind long after I woke up. It wasn’t just fear; it was a certainty. A certainty that she was there, always lurking, always waiting for the one night I wouldn’t wake up in time. It left a stain on my nights, something I couldn’t shake, even when the daylight returned.

Eventually, I grew out of the sleep paralysis. It hasn’t happened in years. But even now, every time I get out of bed in the dark, I dread feeling her cold, dead hands grabbing me as I step off the bed, dragging me down.
