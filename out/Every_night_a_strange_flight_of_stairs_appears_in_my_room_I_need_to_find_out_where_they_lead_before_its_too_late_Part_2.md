I was too shaken by my experience to go back to sleep. Instead, I decided to stay up and do some research. I found myself checking out all of the normal, paranoid things someone who thinks they have seen another dimension might look up. After hours of internet rabbit holes and theory overload, I decided to head outside and sleep in my car for a few hours. I had given up trying to make it to work that day, so I called in sick. I figured I needed to spend my day looking into anything that would help me understand what I had witnessed last night.

I decided to call my parents and ask about their prior tenants. That message from Sherrie said she had stayed in the house. Maybe they would remember her.

I called and was prompted to leave a message at first, but as I was trying to figure out what to say in the message, the phone rang and I switched over to answer the incoming call from my mom.

“Hi mom, how are you doing?”

“Oh I am just fine sweetie, how is the house? Are you getting settled in?”

“Yeah I am, thanks. I was actually calling with a weird question. Do you know how long ago the last person rented the house, before me?” There was a considerable pause and I thought the connection might have been lost. Then she spoke again,

“Oh well, lets see. I think the last person who stayed was that nice young woman, Sheryl or Sharon.” There was another pause as she was thinking and I considered her words and helped her along,

“It was Sherrie, right?”

“Oh yes that's right, I am surprised you knew, I don’t remember me or your father mentioning it. Anyway, she was only there for about a month and your father says she left one night and did not come back. She left a few things there and never returned for them. I don’t know what happened to her, but I was worried when she vanished. She seemed like such a sweet girl. In fact, I think she might have gone to school with you, she looked so familiar and she was around your age.”

I started thinking back and I did vaguely remember a Sherrie in junior high. I remember having a crush on her, but her family had moved away at some point and I was always too shy to say anything. I wondered when she had come back and why she had been staying at my parents house alone.

Then I considered the disturbing implications of her being trapped in that strange stairwell with those creeping horrors.

“Sweetie...are you still there?” My mother's voice brought me back to the present and I responded apologetically,

“Sorry mom. I was just thinking about something. I had one more question, have you or dad ever had any weird dreams about a stairwell in the house? Like a large, stone spiral stairwell?” There was another long pause.

“Oh well, I don’t know. I mean I don’t think....No I haven’t, I mean we haven't. What a silly question.” She laughed nervously and her response sounded like she was trying to convince herself more than anybody else that she had not actually had an experience with the stairs. I was suspicious, but did not press the issue any further.

I was about to ask about something else when she suddenly excused herself, mentioning that her and my dad had to head out to pick something up, but to “Call back anytime.”

I had more questions than answers, but I had a few things to go on now. I looked up my old year book and sure enough I saw Sherrie in my class. I remembered all the time I wanted to say hi but never did, I had no idea what she would have been doing here all these years later. Never mind how she had gotten stuck in that twisted spiral of madness. However she had gotten trapped, I had to help her.

When nighttime fell again on the house I was in a nervous state of apprehension. I knew what I had to do , but the anxiety of waiting was palpable. I went upstairs to my room and packed a backpack full of some supplies, food, water, a long piece of rope, clips and carabiners. Also a large hunting knife. It was far from complete, but it was all I could throw together on short notice.

I kept checking the door over and over again for the next two hours. Each time I looked, the door simply lead to my own hallway. I started wondering what the trick was if any. Or if I might just be going crazy, but how could I be? How could I have known about Sherrie? My mom had confirmed she had been at the house. So despite how insane the situation was, I figured she must still really be there.

Eventually I decided to give in to my fatigue and sleep. I set a short alarm so I would not sleep through the night. Whatever had caused the stairs to appear, it happened at nighttime, after I had already been asleep. So I had to try and replicate the environment.

I fell asleep almost immediately and sure enough, before the alarm even activated, I woke up to an odd sensation. It was dark and there was a humid, charged atmosphere in the room. I saw the door was slightly ajar. I moved closer, held my breath and slowly opened it.

I saw it all again, the spiral staircase was back. It towered over me as I looked up and saw the winding stone steps. I found myself carefully listening to any sounds that might be made by any hunting grabbers. Fortunately, the ambiance was mercifully quiet.

I took one step inside and peered down the steps and felt another rush of air. There was a strange humidity this time I had not noticed before. I also detected a strange smell. It sort of smelled like salt, or salt water, like I was close to an ocean.

The odd scent was confusing, but it was not the strangest thing I had seen in that place. I decided that while the door was still open, I would try a more measured approach than blindly stepping inside like last time. I grabbed the length of rope I had in my backpack and tied and double knotted an end around a heavy dresser in my room. Then I tied the other end securely around my waist and threaded it through the carabiner.

I had about fifty feet of room to play with. With this setup, I could hopefully find my way back to the door quickly if those grabber creatures showed up again. I carefully walked into the stairwell. I kept looking back over my shoulder to see if the door was still open and each time I checked the aperture still yawned wide. The image of the safety of my room was comforting and it emboldened me to ascend the steps.

I was not sure specifically what I was looking for, but I moved on, carefully observing my surroundings as I went. While searching, I saw something after moving about fifteen feet up the steps.

It was another message, I scrambled over and read it as quickly as I could. Portions of this message were almost illegible and the chalk looked scribbled and rushed. Certain parts had smudged off the wall and I struggled to read as much as I could,

“Sorry, I have to write this quick. Your last visit stirred....up and I think.....not safe.....anymore. Find the overlap.....it.....somewhere above.....room. Be careful if you.......a......sound......... above.......

Sound on the wall, heralds the surfs call. Please......hold....breath the water. It’s safe from them, but you are not safe......from.......something else.

I will try and find you......water can connect........hurry.   -Sherrie ”

Another message I could barely understand. Though it was heartening to see she was still okay and has escaped last night. One detail I did understand, was that I had to keep going up. I had to find what Sherrie had called an overlap.

It was good to hear that I had been going the right way. I continued on nervously for a short while. I kept walking slowly, trying to ignore the lingering fear of more of those grabbers ambushing me further up the steps. Then another concern struck me.

I looked back and tugged the rope I had tied around my waist. It was still loose. But when I looked back and saw how many stairs I had ascended, I started to worry. I began pulling on the rope and as I did, the rope kept coming toward me in bundles. My heart sank when after pulling yards of rope towards me, I saw what I had expected at that point.

The end of the rope had been cut, something has just severed it further down towards the door. That was why it had pulled free. I did not know who or what might have cut it, but it did not matter. I had a feeling if I went back down the steps to where the rope end had fallen, the door would be gone. I was stuck in there again.

I held onto the rope and looked up, then down again. I was starting to panic and I tried stepping forward once and then back twice. I reached to my right, but no door was there. Apparently the trick to leaving would not work this time. As my anxiety increased, I heard a noise coming from above.

It sounded like a rhythmic tapping noise. I relaxed slightly when I considered the fact that it sounded different than the grabbers. I strained my ears and continued listening to the tapping sound. It has a pattern to it that sounded like some means of communication.

I thought it could be Sherrie, trying to communicate to me. She was supposed to be above in whatever the overlap was. I took a few steps up and rested a hand on the cool stone wall. Out of curiosity I tapped on the wall. Three short taps, followed by three longer ones, finishing with three shorter taps.

I waited for a long moment in the silence that followed. I had hoped if she was there, she would have hear the SOS. What followed was a loud banging sound followed by an ear-piercing shriek that nearly knocked me off my feet with the sudden outburst.

Whatever was above me burst into motion. I heard scratching, rushed motion over the steps and an ululating scream resounding down the spiraling steps.

I struggled to resist screaming myself, but instead I turned around and began rushing back down the stairs.

My body ached as I hurtled down the stairs at speed. The motion above me increased and I heard thundering footsteps and shrieking that was even louder now. It felt like the sound was going to burst my eardrums.

I smelled that odd salt water scent even stronger as I rushed down the steps. I remembered the message Sherrie had sent. Sounds on the wall heral the surfs call. There was water down there and maybe if I could get further down, I would be safe.

I kept running madly down the steps until there was a rush of air and a huge figure leapt down several steps and crashed into a heap in front of me. It quickly recovered and stood up to its full height.

Transfixed in horror I slowly backed away and into the walls, pressing myself flat against it.

I took in the terrible sight of the creature before me. The thing was massive, standing around eight feet in height. It looked like a skinned gorilla. The hulking frame was covered in red exposed meat, muscle and sinew. Only ragged chunks of anything still resembling skin remained on a few smaller areas.

Worst of all was the slavering maw that held three individual rows of serrated teeth. The imbalanced rows of fangs shifted and moved in a terrible jerky fashion, as if they had a mind separate from the beast whose mouth they resided in.

As it shifted its terrible maw, I smelled the acrid stench of its drool as it dripped on the stone steps.

I thought I was dead, but as I tried to sink into the wall, I noticed something. The eyes were milky white cataracts that did not follow me as I shrunk back. The only reason it had not jumped me directly, was because the thing appeared to be blind.

I held my breath and watched it move. It jerked its head back and forth, while the crater on its face where a nose should have been, made a distinct sniffing sound. I was terrified but remained completely still and held my breath.

Then it took a step forward and reached an oversized arm towards the wall. The prodigious claws on the hand touched the wall just a hairs breath from where my head was. It tapped the stone several times with its claws and a responding sound came from high above us on the steps.

It seemed to be communicating to more of them. I nearly toppled forward and gave away my position when it let out a deafening shriek. It sniffed again and then I heard something besides the creature. It sounded like waves lapping against a building. That was it, the water was down there somewhere and it was close.

I forced my terrified body to shift slowly against the wall and inch by inch down the steps. The creature looked as if it had not noticed me and I saw it was touching the steps further up from where I had come from. If I could make it to the water, the message said I might be safe.

For a moment I considered reaching for the knife I had brought, but another look at the size of the thing made me reconsider the idea.

I managed to take several quiet steps away from the blind creature. It turned around and I froze. Now it was moving back towards me along the wall. I had to move, so I quietly slipped closer to the center near the edge of the spiral steps.

Making it to the edge of the spiral, I looked down and saw the area below was flooded about twenty feet further down. I kept creeping further away from the blind monstrosity, but I tripped over a broken step and cut my heel on a sharp edge.

I kept myself from crying out and bit my tongue. But to my horror the creature turned around and sniffed again. It did this three times and then centered its dead gaze squarely on me. A long proboscis like tongue slipped out of its mouth and licked the rows of teeth before it moved toward me. I had no time left, I could not outrun it. I moved to the edge of the spiral and jumped.

If I had been a second slower the creature would have caught me in its lightning fast lunge. It was standing near the edge where I had just jumped in a blur.

I remember falling and I could only make out a second or so of the monstrous shrieking roar, before my entire body plunged into the cold water.

My eyes snapped open, and I tried to swim up, but my limbs were not responding. The sting of salt water was already in my lungs. I tried to hold onto the breath I had taken when I fell, but it had been blasted from my lungs. The water burned my eyes, but I could see figures above me, more of the blind monsters. They did not seem able to enter the water. I was so near the surface and the splashing I was making while trying to rise, would surely have given them the opportunity to attack.

I heard the distorted noise of another scream and the figures left. I was finally able to propel myself towards the surface and I got my face above the water for a moment, gasping for fresh air. I heard tapping and scratching noises on the stone and the shrieks sounded much further away.

I wondered why they would not wait to ambush me if they knew I was down there in the water. I swam toward the portion of stairs that were closest to the water's surface and rested a moment there. I started trying to pull myself up, when I heard a rushing sound. It sounded like a dam being released and tons of water all pouring down into a singular point. Suddenly the reason for the creature's swift departure was made evident.

Water started pouring into the stairwell and it began to rise at an impossible rate. I was swept off the stairs and lost my grip as the water's surface rose rapidly. There was water pouring in from somewhere and an intense pull from below had gripped my legs. I tried in vain to grasp the stairs again, even for a moment to stay above the surface. But the water was rising too fast and the faster it rose, the stronger the pull back down was.

Eventually I couldn't hold on any longer and my grip broke. I was pulled deep into the center of the spiraling vortex of water that was the heart of the stairwell. The force of the pull and the violent descent threatened to crush my lungs and the pressure made me go light headed.

I reached out to grab onto steps once more and managed to slow my descent. I bobbed there in the water and took in the hopeless terror. I saw a limitless abyss bellow and crushing water above now as well. I thought I would die in that water. I saw no way out and I remember I lost consciousness and thought I would drown.

While I was out, I dreamt I was floating in a vast ocean and a figure emerged from the waves and took my hand. I thought it might be an angel and the light I went into must have surely been the afterlife. Then the figure bent down over me and kissed me. A wave of oxygen brought me back to reality.

I gasped and reeled at the sensation of air entering my lungs again. The bright light burned my salt scoured eyes and I spat water out like a fountain. I was dimly aware of being in a small stone room. I could not see the stairs, but the architecture there was very similar.

Then I heard a soft voice speak out and I knew I was not alone in the room.

“Oh thank God, you made it. Are you alright now, can you breathe?” I tried to turn my head towards the voice, but I was still coughing and gagging.

“I thought I lost you for a moment there. In fact if I had not been lucky getting to you so fast, I might have. I knew those CPR classes were worth something.”

The person smiled and as my eyes focused, I saw the face of a woman. Her hair was a wild, dirty blonde tangle, and she was covered in cuts and bruises. There was even a long scar across her face that had not healed all the way.

However, what struck me was the expression on her face, she looked genuinely concerned about my safety. Her green eyes were kind and thoughtful and the spark I saw in them reminded me of someone I had seen years ago.

I spoke one word after coughing up more salt water,

“Sherrie?” She nodded her head and knelt back down beside me.

“Yes, it’s me. Sorry we had to meet this way and that I was not faster. This place is a labyrinth, despite looking like a bunch of stairs. I know you must have a lot of questions but try and rest for a moment. It should be safe enough here from most of the things that might be looking for us.

I tried to respond, but I felt a terrible pain in my head and coughed up more water. Smiling weakly at her, I laid my head back down and closed my eyes. It finally felt safe enough to rest.
