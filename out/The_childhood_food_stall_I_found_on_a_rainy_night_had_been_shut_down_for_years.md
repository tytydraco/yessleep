I won’t mention the exact location.
If someone finds this story and starts searching for the place, disturbing whoever owns it now… I want no part in that. Let’s just say it’s in the outskirts of South Kolkata, a quiet old neighborhood, not far from where I grew up. I’ll call the road 'Sunset Alley'. No, that’s not the real name.

As a student, I passed through that alley every day on my way to physics tuition. Later, during college, it was part of my route again. I never thought much of it. But that shaded, tree lined lane with its crumbling houses always had a strange charm. Each house seemed to hold a secret, an old world sealed behind iron gates and moss covered walls.

There was one house in particular. A small two storied structure with barely five rooms. It stood at the corner where two narrow lanes intersected to form a crooked junction. Years ago, its ground floor hosted a modest food stall named 'Royal Taste'.

Back then, having a fast food joint in the neighborhood was rare. You couldn’t order online, and delivery apps were a distant dream. So we were lucky to have Royal Taste nearby. They made rolls, chow mein, cutlets, and the occasional Mughlai paratha. I often stopped there after tuition or college.

The owner was a warm, slightly eccentric man we called Bhulo Uncle. Always dressed in a faded brown shirt, a bald spot glinting under the tube light, he had a light mustache and a welcoming smile. His food was something else, especially the chicken roll. It had a flavor unlike anything I’ve tasted elsewhere. The sauces were homemade. The onions were cut in spiral curls. The chicken was always tender and flavorful.

But life moved on. The shop closed down. The lane faded into memory.


Until that one rainy Monday night.

It was late November. The city had just stepped out of its festive daze. The air held a slight chill. I was returning home after a soul sucking quarterly review at work. Meetings had stretched all day, some online, some in person. I hadn’t eaten since lunch. I booked a bike cab. Halfway through, the driver ran into a political rally blocking the main road.

Then his brakes gave out.

“Sorry, sir,” he said, “this is dangerous. I’ll have to cancel the ride.”
Frustrated and soaked in drizzle, I stepped off. I had no idea where I was.

And then I saw the street sign:
Sunset Alley

That name pulled something loose inside me. A forgotten door creaked open in my mind. Childhood. Nostalgia. Warm food on cold nights.

Drawn by a strange mix of hunger and memory, I wandered in.

The lane hadn’t changed. Same broken balconies. Same hanging vines. Same faded houses leaning on each other like aging relatives. From behind shuttered windows, I could faintly hear voices; families laughing, kids reading aloud, the clink of dishes.

And then…
That smell.

The unmistakable aroma of fried bread, sizzling meat, and thick spicy gravy. It hit me like lightning. My stomach twisted. It was the exact scent that used to drift out of Royal Taste years ago.

I followed it.

And there it was.

Royal Taste.
Still there.

Same rusty hand painted signboard. Blue background, cream letters. Faded, but intact.
And the lights were on.

Inside, only a single candle flickered. The ancient electric bulb must’ve gone out. A man in his 40s sat at the counter. Well groomed. clean shaven, hair neatly combed back. He looked more like a bank officer than a food vendor.

“Can I get you something?” he asked politely.

I ordered a chicken roll, what else?
He nodded and went inside to give the order.

I looked around. Same layout. Metal counter. Greasy wooden benches lined up inside. In one dark corner, a man stood quietly washing dishes, head bowed, his figure half hidden in shadow.

When the roll arrived, I tried making conversation.
“I used to come here as a kid. Bhulo Uncle made amazing rolls,” I said.

The man smiled.
“Yes. He was my father. He passed away. I run the place now.”

I looked up. Above the counter was a photo of Bhulo Uncle, garlanded with flowers, clearly a framed memorial.

My roll came hot and fresh. I turned to the door, stood under the awning, and took a bite.

It was perfect.
No. Too perfect.

The same tangy homemade sauce. The same curly onions. The same texture.
Exactly like I remembered it. The taste was identical.
My mind began to spiral.

And then I thought about the man washing dishes.

The bald spot. The faded brown shirt.
And then I remembered it, the scar on his forearm.

That burn mark.
From the time hot oil spilled on him years ago.
I’d seen it happen.

That man was Bhulo Uncle.
But… how?

My heart thudded. My hands trembled.

I finished the roll, turned toward the trash bin near the door, and tossed the wrapper.

Then I turned around.

And everything… was gone.


The shop was closed.
Rusty shutter locked from the outside.
Dust thick on the ground.
No light. No smell. No people.

I pounded on the door. Rang the bell.
Nothing.
Only silence.
Only echo.


I don’t remember how long I stood there.
Eventually, my phone rang, it was almost 11 PM. I snapped out of it and stumbled home. But before leaving, I managed to snap a picture of the shuttered stall on my phone.

The next few days were strange. The memory haunted me.
I called old friends, the ones who’d gone to Royal Taste with me. I brought it up casually.

Every single one said the same thing:
“Yeah, I remember Sunset Alley.”
“But did we ever eat there?”
“Was there even a food stall?”

They didn’t remember Royal Taste.


The following Sunday, I went back.

The alley was still there.
But the houses?

Gone.
Replaced by rows of glassy new flats.
Right where Royal Taste should’ve stood was a sleek office building, windows reflecting the dying sun.

I stood there… staring.

And then, just for a moment,
I caught that smell again.

That rich, nostalgic scent of spicy meat rolls…
faint… floating on the wind.

When I got home,
I checked my phone.

The photo was gone.
