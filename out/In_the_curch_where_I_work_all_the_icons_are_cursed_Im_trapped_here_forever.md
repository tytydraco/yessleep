I came to work at the Church of Saint Anselm to escape everything. At the time, I thought a quiet position as a caretaker in a small town would give me room to breathe, a chance to forget.

I wasn’t religious, but there was something in the calm of this place that touched me deep inside. Maybe it was the soothing silence of the pews or the way sunlight filtered through the antique stained glass, like the breath of God. I just needed quiet—and the church had plenty of it.

The church is located in Marrowick—a godforsaken town in upstate New York, lost among thick forests and forgotten highways. The people here are polite but guarded, the way folks tend to be in small towns. They’re never rude, but they don’t ask questions either. No one asked why a thirty-year-old guy from the big city moved into the church house. They were just glad someone was finally taking care of the place.

Saint Anselm had stood empty for many years. The previous caretaker, an old man named Grady, had died under strange circumstances. No one knew the exact cause—some said heart failure, others claimed he simply “walked off and never came back.” I didn’t press the issue; I wasn’t particularly curious.

The church was old, built back in the 19th century, with creaky floors and drafts in the hallways. The bell tower hadn’t worked in years, and the wooden pews had been polished to a shine by countless hands.

But the most disturbing thing—the thing that unsettled me the most—were the icons. There were too many of them. Not just the usual crucifixes and stained-glass depictions of saints that everyone’s used to, but large painted panels hung in odd places: beside the doors, above the confessional, even at the foot of the pulpit.
They were old, clearly brought from far away. Eastern Orthodox in style—with flat, wide-open eyes and severe expressions. 

My whole life, this kind of art always gave me the sensation that I was being watched. Even if I knew I wasn’t, it still made me deeply uneasy.

I’m no expert, but it didn’t take a scholar to realize how strange it was to find icons like this in a Catholic church in rural America. They didn’t belong here—that’s what I thought. And maybe, I didn’t either.

Then the strangeness began. At first, I blamed it on adjustment. I was alone in a massive, old building, full of creaks and groans. I thought I heard whispering now and then, but chalked it up to fatigue and sleepless nights.

Until the icons started to change.

At first, it was barely noticeable. One morning I saw red spots on the spear of Saint George near the entrance. My first thought was paint. Maybe it had always been that way and I’d just missed it. But then the eyes of the Virgin Mary on the icon near the stairs to the rectory began to shine—not from the light, but as though with tears. I bent down and stared at the image for a long time before touching the wood. Goosebumps ran down my arms when I realized it was damp.
I wiped the surface, deciding there must be a leak in the wall. 

But the next day it happened again. The moisture was only on her face, as if the wood itself was crying.

A week after I arrived, I woke around three in the morning. The house was dead silent, except for a faint rustling, like claws scraping stone. I assumed it was something in the walls—until I realized the sound was coming from the church itself. I threw on a sweater and padded barefoot across the cold floor. There was no need for light; moonlight poured in, bathing the hallway in silver.

When I stepped into the sanctuary, the air changed. Subtly, but unmistakably—it smelled like the charged air before a storm. The pews were cloaked in shadow, and the icon of Saint Sebastian by the altar looked darker than usual. His wounds—tiny arrows in his chest—appeared fresh and wet. I swear on everything I have: they were bleeding.

I stood frozen for ten minutes, the metallic scent of blood in my nostrils. Then came the rustling again, louder and rhythmic now, from the direction of the altar.

I moved forward, mouth dry, a lump in my throat. I rounded the pulpit—and everything fell silent. I looked behind the altar.

Nothing. No rats, no fallen stones. Just a wooden cross and the icons. One of them made my heart stutter: a grim monk with eyes like black voids, holding a book inscribed with red symbols. I had never seen it before.

When I turned on the lights, the icon was gone. I couldn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

Things got worse in the days that followed. The icon of Christ in the sanctuary began to change expression. His once-serene mouth twisted into a deep scowl. His eyes followed me—not metaphorically, but literally. I tested it, pacing from side to side. They tracked me. One day, from the choir loft, I saw His hand raised in a gesture that hadn’t been there before: two fingers lifted in blessing… or warning.

I kept telling myself it was all in my head—maybe I was losing it. I’d gone through some sad, heavy shit in my life. Maybe it had cracked something inside me. I was too alone. That’s what I thought… until the dreams started.

Too vivid—so much that I sometimes wondered if I was dreaming at all. I’d wake up drenched in sweat, heart pounding, unsure if I was still asleep.

It was always the same place: the church, lit by candles. Icons covered every surface—walls, ceiling, even the floor—and they whispered in a language I didn’t understand. The rhythm of the words felt like a heartbeat. The Virgin’s face contorted in grief. Peter gnawed at his own hands. Christ’s wounds bled, flooding the air with the metallic stench. The worst part... was that when the icons changed in the dreams, they changed in reality too—becoming increasingly grotesque and terrifying.

At the end of each dream, the monk from the vanished icon appeared. Standing at the foot of my bed, book in hand, his mouth sewn shut with black thread. He’d point a bony finger at me, and that’s when the dream would end—not with waking, but with my scream.

I wanted to quit. This wasn’t what I signed up for. I told Father Bellamy, the parish priest, that I was feeling overwhelmed. I told him about the dreams. About what I saw in the church. He gave me a strange look—not pity, but… understanding. He didn’t try to talk me out of it. He just asked one question:

"Have you opened the box in the sacristy?"

“What?”

He walked away without another word, leaving me stunned.

That night, I found the box. I hadn’t noticed it before—built into the base of a cabinet in the sacristy, hidden behind a false panel. Inside was a folder filled with yellowed pages. Notes, sketches of a strange religious nature, and a journal.
Grady’s journal.

I read the first few entries, my hands trembling uncontrollably.

“The icons came from Russia. Donated, supposedly, in 1912 by a visiting bishop. But something’s wrong with them. I know Orthodox art. These aren’t just images. They’re prisons. They’re vessels.”

“I hear them at night. Whispering. Sometimes crying. The Virgin begs me to release her. Sebastian howls in agony. Christ weeps blood. They’re trapped in eternal suffering.”

“I found a ritual to cleanse them. But it requires blood. Mine won’t work. It has to be a good soul. I just can’t do it. Forgive me, Lord.”

I dropped the journal and doubled over, my stomach heaving. I nearly vomited. The next morning, I drove into town to demand answers from Father Bellamy.

He wasn’t surprised. He invited me into his office, poured us both whiskey. The room was crammed with books—ancient, leather-bound tomes that looked more occult than theological.

“You’re the first to last more than a month,” he said, sipping calmly. “You and Grady. That old man held on for years. Until the end.”

I showed him the journal. He nodded.

“We’ve known for a long time… The icons never should’ve come here. They were created during a famine by a cult that believed saints could absorb human suffering—literally. They poured their torment into the paintings. Starved themselves. Killed their own. Fed the icons, sealing them with prayer and blood.”

“And who brought them here?”

“The bishop who donated them burned in a fire a few weeks later. No one knows who really sent them. But it was already too late. The church accepted them, and now they can’t be removed. Every time someone tries, something terrible happens—plague, fire, madness. We stopped trying. One local man tried to destroy the icon of the Holy Trinity. He vanished. And a new icon appeared—one we’d never seen before.”

“And you just… live with this?”

He looked at me with hollow eyes.

“What else can we do? They’re part of the building now. Like rot in the bones. We are doomed, my son.”

I left, my body shaking with the weight of it. What terrified me wasn’t what he said—but how calmly he said it.

I tried to run. Packed a bag, booked a motel, planned to head south. But the road was blocked. A fallen tree. People said it was a storm. I didn’t believe them.

I tried leaving on foot through the forest—walked for hours, but always ended up back in town. Asking the locals for help was useless. They just looked at me with despair.

A couple times, when I thought I was escaping, a blinding migraine would paralyze me in seconds. I’d black out. And wake up in the church house.
When I finally dared to re-enter the church, the icons had changed again. They were all staring at me. Not with judgment—but their gaze made my skin crawl.

They knew I tried to leave.

The nightmares got worse—the monk began to speak. His mouth no longer sewn shut. His voice like cracking ice underfoot.

“You live where they rest. Feed them. Or take their place. Try to destroy them—and join me.”

The sounds came during the day now: scratching beneath the floorboards, moaning in the walls. I opened a vent and found a bundle wrapped in cloth. What I saw nearly gave me a heart attack. A severed human hand, clutching a crucifix twisted into a spiral.

I stopped sleeping.

The church began to change. Hallways leading nowhere. Rooms that hadn’t existed before. Doors locking themselves. Once, I found stairs behind the pulpit leading into darkness. The next day—they were gone.

And the icons kept weeping. Bleeding and moving.

I started hearing voices while awake—begging, screaming, sometimes laughing. Someone whispers my name. Others promise release… if I obey.

I couldn’t live like that. I saw the sword of Archangel Michael rust before my eyes. Thick, syrupy liquid dripped from the blade. Blood poured from the crucifix. The Holy Trinity icon—all three angels stared directly into my soul.

I brought a sledgehammer at night. Stood before the crying Virgin and raised it. Her face changed. The tears stopped. And for the first time since I arrived—she smiled.

I dropped the sledgehammer and ran. That was last week.

Now something is coming. I feel it. The church is hungry. At night, the icons pulse. Paint moves like living flesh. I see hands behind the surfaces—pushing, tearing, trying to break free.

I understand now what the monk meant. They need a soul. A willing one. Someone to suffer for them. To become one of them. To become the new icon.

Grady resisted, but he broke. I don’t know if I’ll be any stronger.

I’ve started painting. I don’t know why. I just looked at the paints Grady left, and my hands started to move. I draw faces I’ve never seen but that feel familiar. I couldn’t draw before. Now the brush moves on its own. Some of the faces… look like mine.

I see my reflection in the glass covering the icons. The eyes don’t move. The mouth doesn’t match mine.

It’s almost over for me—like it was for Grady, and the others.

My calls to the police go unanswered. No one picks up. I’ve realized I’m stuck here. I’ll never get out alive. If you ever find this church—run. Don’t even think of going inside.

No one deserves to become part of this place.

Not even me.
