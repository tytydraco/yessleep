[My phone had died at this point](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15u63xc/when_she_trapped_us_in_that_pit_she_thought_she/). To preserve fuel, I allowed the flame to illuminate for only a moment at a time as I walked. The darkness was absolute and seemed to press on me from all sides in between each flicker as if it would smother me if I let it linger too long. It looked felt as if it was darker than anywhere I had ever been before. *It reminds me of when I was a kid, going to bed late at night and trying to see my hands in front of my face before my eyes adjust. I can’t see anything in this place.* Wait, that sounded familiar. *I was talking to Megan about that earlier today.*    
  
As far as I could tell, there was nothing around me. No walls, no objects, just dirt ground with the occasional rock. It was also deafly quiet with only the taps of my footsteps to fill the void. A very distant red light briefly lit in the distance and then vanished. With each hesitant step, the void seemed to stretch infinitely ahead. I began to wonder if the path had an end or if I was trapped in some endless loop of darkness. I thought of all of the floors above this one, and wondered if where I walked was untouched by time and space. I tried to shake off the thought, but it clung to me as tenaciously as the enveloping dark.    
  
As I continued onward, I perceived a slight change in the air, a tingling sensation on my skin. Then, in the distance, I saw it. Suddenly, the sky, or what I believed to be the sky, cracked open. A magnificent bolt of red lightning tore through dark clouds, momentarily banishing the darkness. The electric brilliance revealed a vast landscape, unlike any I had ever seen. Jagged peaks on a rocky terrain, vast chasms, and an eerie red glow permeating everything.    
  
No thunder followed. I just stood there for a while, hoping for another flash to give me another glimpse at where I was, but it never came. I could feel my courage begin wearing off as my heart started pounding against the rest of my chest. My breaths were getting shorter, my heart racing. I closed my eyes for a moment and tried to get a hold of myself. But I couldn’t.    
  
"I need to turn back," I muttered to myself, eyes wide open now, trying to pierce the impenetrable darkness. "I need to find the elevator."   
  
I started retracing my steps, or at least I thought I was. Every direction felt identical, every step just as uncertain as the last. I was trying to just walk in nothing but a straight line but I knew it would be a miracle if I was slightly off I would pass right by the elevator. Desperation began to creep in. *How could I have wandered so far? What was I thinking?*    
  
My pace quickened as panic bubbled inside me. My breathing echoed loudly in the suffocating silence, and my fingers wrapped tighter around the bug spray can, which I was now almost continuously spraying.    
  
I found that my speed walking had accelerated into lightly jogging, my eyes darting around for something to latch onto. That's why I almost ran into it. The minotaur. It was just standing there, making no noise, staring at me. Its sudden appearance forced a scream from my lungs, sending me crashing to the ground, my lighter scattering away. Panic surged. I could hear it grunt as its hooves began walking towards me. I scrambled backwards, fumbling for the pepper spray, firing it and the bug spray both wildly in front of me.    
  
I must’ve been fortunate enough to hit the monster because it let out a piercing roar and I took that chance to quickly stand back up. I brushed my hands all over the floor in front of me and felt the lighter, picked it up, and began to run as fast as I could in the other direction. Springing up, I bolted, juggling my makeshift weapons as I ran. Another red flash painted the dark, revealing a massive boulder to my right.   
  
I had no idea if the beast could see in the dark or if my pepper spray had rendered it blind, but I wasn't about to find out. I dashed behind the boulder and prayed that it would shield me. At first, the monster was still wailing uncontrollably, as if I had just caused it incredible pain. But then the whispering began once again. It sounded different this time, more fast paced and in an angered hush. It was pissed, and it was coming for me. A massive string of blood lightning poured across the sky, so I seized the opportunity to quickly take a glance. For that split second, I thought I spotted it walking, searching for me. I again focused on my breathing and tried to keep it as silent as possible.    
  
I tried to draw back on the only meditation practice I knew; I began counting slowly backwards from 10. *10... 9... 8... 7...* Another red flash illuminated my surroundings. *6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...* I then stopped and listened. I could still hear the whispering, but it seemed farther now. I rubbed my eyes and whispered “God, or Zeus, whatever or whoever is listening, please get me out of this.” My eyes were somewhat adjusting at least... I could see just barely. I decided to stare into the dark so I could see where it was during the next strike of lightning, so I placed my hand onto the boulder and peeked around it. Suddenly, where I had placed my hand, a small rock fell off of the boulder and fell to the ground. You wouldn’t think that a single rock would make a loud sound. But with how silent it was, it traveled far, and I knew it.   
  
*\*Thud, thud, thud, thud, thud\**   
  
It was running towards me now. I sprinted through the darkness, bracing myself to run into another large boulder at any moment. Running through the pitch black was terrifying, but anything was better than getting caught and devoured.    
  
*\*Thud, thud, thud, THUD, THUD\**   
  
It was gaining on me. *It’s almost directly behind me now. This is it; this is how I die. No... worse. I’d take death over this in an instant.* Little did I know that my thought was about to be put to the test. A bright red flash illuminated the area, revealing an enormous gorge just in front of me. I halted and used my makeshift flamethrower to confirm that I was mere feet from having just run off what looked like an endless drop into the abyss.    
  
*\*THUD THUD THUD THUD THUD\**   
  
I contemplated whether to jump, but my body resisted. As much as my mind was screaming to just dive into the darkness the rest of my body was running on instinct and forbade me from acting on the decision. I continued to point the flame at the darkness where the running hooves were coming from. The minotaur, grotesque and towering, stepped into the firelight, its once brown fur now stained black by pepper spray. Its hollow eyes stared back at me, bloodshot and enraged. I then realized that the agonizing scream it had wailed earlier was not from me blinding it, but instead that the spray had seeped into the numerous open wounds across its body.   
  
I hardly had time to react to a sudden swing from the creature's steel weapon, only missing me by inches as I dodged to the left. Juggling the lighter, the bug spray and the pepper spray, I attempted to light the minotaur on fire but it was just out of reach. A second swing came at me and landed its mark as I shot pepper spray relentlessly at the creature. The hit knocked me onto the ground and pain intensely consumed me. I could feel the warmth of blood start to pour out of my side, but the adrenaline surging through my body kept me moving.    
  
I quickly stood up and saw the creature shaking and twitching in agony from the additional spray I covered it with. Another red flash. Seizing my opportunity, I unleashed a torrent of fire upon the beast. Screeching, it fell to the ground. During its fiery torment, its massive hairy hand stretched out, grabbing my ankle and yanking me off balance. My head slammed against the stone with a sickening thud, the world around me blurring into a hazy whirl of colors and sounds.    
  
I couldn’t see, I couldn’t move, and I couldn’t think. My entire body felt numb, and I lost sense of the passage of time. I could feel something on my leg, pulling me, but I wasn’t able to react. It was a twin set of red lightning that bolted overhead that shook me back into reality. It gave me a glimpse at the minotaur just at my feet, its mouth open wider than anything I’ve ever seen, like a hippopotamus on steroids. Voices were screaming at me from inside of its mouth.    
  
***“ANOTHER... PLEASE SAVE US... WE’RE CHAINED... FIRE... \*INAUDIBLE\* ... RUN BOY... CURSE THE GODS... INTO THE CHASM.”***   
  
Realizing what was happening, panic surged anew, driving me into action. I ignored the fact that I was about to scorch myself and shot an array of flames into the beast's mouth. The voices inside of it all screamed in pain as the minotaur spasmed and let go of my leg. A small reflection of light shimmered from a few feet away in the firelight. *The spear*. Now on fire, the monster started to stand back up, so I moved for the weapon and swung it hard at the beast's head. It staggered but before it could recover, I hit it again, and again, and again. It fell to the ground, and I took the spear and shoved it straight into the skull of the minotaur.    
  
Desperate to kill the creature, I then I engulfed the creature in flames once more. Its convulsions slowed to twitching, then stopped altogether. Gasping for breath, I watched as the flames sputtered and died, the bug spray can empty.    
  
For a while I just stood there and stared at it, expecting it to move. To chase me. To catch me. But it didn’t.    
  
I studied the distant surroundings and noticed a small light. With my leg badly burned and my bloody side incapacitating the rest of my body, I found that I had no other option but to trudge toward it. As I got closer, I could see it was the elevator. The elevator that had taken me into the hallway of statues, into the swamp of vultures and crocodiles, into the room with the gigantic skeletons, into the room with the green candlelight, and into the wasteland of darkness. I stepped on, dazed and unsure whether I had really survived. But to say I had survived was naive... there was nowhere to go.    
  
I stepped on and sat down on the carpeted floor. I squinted at the overhead light. Recognizing for the first time that I was starving, I opened the backpack and started to make myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I stared into the distance, watching the occasional red lightning give me a spectacle to mesmerize at. Like the swamp, it was a place of danger and death, but there was a certain beauty to it. A few bites into my sandwich and a bottle of water later, I glanced up at the buttons below the elevator map.    
  
One was lit up, just above the up button. I pounced up and inspected it. The button gave off a soft, green glow and depicted a trophy. It certainly hadn’t been there before.    
  
*What? Is this it? Am I getting out of here?* I immediately hit the trophy button; hope was filling me that it could be the way out. The elevator began to burr and then ascend. I smiled and began to cry. I found myself tapping my foot in anticipation to get out of the elevator as the floors ticked by. When it passed floor 5, it began to speed up and I held on, recognizing that the same thing had occurred when we had first boarded the elevator. *I’m going up, I’m getting out!*   
  
Eventually it slowed and came to a stop with its normal arrival sound. \**ding*\* The doors opened, and I immediately started to run through, looking for the exit. The floor was made up of finely cut white and blue marble tiles, and tall Doric columns made of white marble stood in intervals across the room. Paintings of Gods lined the walls, with three major paintings of which I assumed were depicting Zeus, Poseidon and Hades at the back of the room over a doorway.    
  
The room was beautiful, it really was. I just didn’t care. Eyes fixated on the next door ahead, I was so focused on escaping that I almost passed the immense chest in the center of the room. I hesitated for a moment. *Heck, why not?*  I walked over to it and opened it.    
  
Piled high within, countless gold coins shimmered and twinkled. Even with all I had been through, and how focused I was on escaping, my mind couldn’t resist but switch to awe and excitement at the treasure before me. Resting atop the mound of wealth, a delicate glass case captured my attention. The transparency of the case contrasted starkly with the dense gold beneath. It appeared almost ethereal, the glass so clear that it seemed as though I could reach out and touch a vial sitting inside without any barrier.   
  
The vial itself was meticulously crafted, perhaps of crystal or some other precious material, and contained a mysterious liquid that shifted colors - from deep blue to emerald green as light passed through it. There was hardly any inside, and it seemed to be only a single drop of the substance. *Wait a minute. This must be it, from the letter Megan left us. It’s the cure for any illness.*    
  
I opened my backpack and stuffed it with the vial and as much gold as possible before realizing my backpack became too heavy. I took some gold out until I was barely able to lift the bag and limped toward the door. It swung open and what I saw was strangely the happiest moment of my life. It was the passage that had led us to the elevator doors. I was out. I had escaped.    
  
The moment I stepped out, the door behind me transformed and molded into stone elevator doors. I started running towards the exit as quickly as I could with a heavy bag and a burned leg, but immediately came across the gun we had pulled out of the backpack when we had first read Megans note. Rage pulsated through me as I remembered what she had done to us. I picked up the gun and stuffed it into the back of my pants. *I’m going to kill her when I see her. I don’t care if I’m arrested, she needs to pay for this.*   
  
As I continued walking on, closer and closer to the exit, I glanced at the photos lining the wall, some dusty and cracked, when one stood out to me. The frame around it looked brand new and when I looked at the photo, I found out why. The vibrant and evocative photograph captured the same angle as always of the cave showing a group of individuals navigating the uneven terrain. To the left was Tanner, in mid-stride, walking towards the cave with energy and enthusiasm, his face lit with excitement. Close behind him, Ryan's features were also lit in anticipation as he followed.   
  
On the right side, Alice is captured in a candid moment, shrugging slightly, her expression a mix of reluctance and curiosity. Following the others was myself, whose attention had shifted away from the group. My face, turning to the left, reflected a hint of confusion and curiosity. And then in the shadows near the cave's entrance, Megan stood apart from the group, her demeanor reserved and contemplative. Her gaze was directed momentarily at me.   
  
I grabbed the photo and shook it as I began to sob. I audibly pleaded with them to turn back. “No, please don’t go in. It’s a trap, you’re going to die if you go in!” I felt guilty, like somehow it was partially my fault, as if I could’ve known what we were going into. Memories of my friends flashed through my mind, causing the guilt to hurt more. *Maybe I should've seen the signs that something was wrong. I should've pushed more to keep going on the trail.* I contemplated whether I should take the photo, and after realizing this was the last photo of my friends, I decided to take it. Unfortunately, the frame was stuck to the wall and my attempts to break the glass were futile.    
  
Disappointed, I took one last long look at the photo before continuing down the pathway. When I reached the end, the doorway was open without a sign of Megan. I tried to remember the way out and succeeded, filled with joy as I saw the light outside of the cave as I walked out. As far as I figured, it was the next day from when we had first entered, but I couldn’t be sure how things worked down the elevator. I took in a deep breath of the fresh air, which felt better than anything I had felt in a long time.   
  
As I walked outside, I saw a campsite directly next to the cave entrance, and made eye contact with Megan, who was sitting on a camping chair. Her eyes were wide from shock and surprise that she was looking at me. “Micheal?! You made it!” She smiled and jumped out of her chair and started to run towards me.    
  
I began to reach for the gun in the back of my pants when a new thought came through my head, and I resisted the temptation to pull it out and shoot her right there. She slowed down when she realized none of the others were behind me. A concerned look came across her face. “Where are they? Where’s Tanner, Ryan and Alice?” It took everything I had to hold back from shouting at her that she had killed all three of them.    
  
I managed to break a small smile and dropped the backpack onto the ground. I unzipped it to reveal the pounds of gold coins and replied “They’re still in there, grabbing more of this. They should be out soon.” “Woah! Those have to be worth a fortune! And the elixir?” “Tanner has it. We’ll get it to your sister soon” I answered. It hurt me just to say his name to her. “That’s awesome!” she shouted. It bothered me to see her so excited, acting like she had done nothing wrong. Her expression then turned somber. “Listen Micheal, I’m really sorry I locked you guys in there. I’m glad you all made it out safely, and now we can save Emma.” I replied “It’s alright. We did meet the minotaur, but it wasn’t bad because we just shot it with that gun you gave us.”   
  
My acting skills were horrible, and I knew that, but from Megans expression it seemed she was so excited to see me that she was buying it. “In fact,” I continued, “let’s go help them out. We can grab another bag of coins and you can see the elixir for yourself.” Her face lit up as I said that, and she happily agreed.   
  
She never did make it out. Confused by my bodily injuries, the police questioned me for a few days but didn’t find any evidence of any wrongdoing, so I was never charged with any crimes. There was no evidence as the bag of gold is still buried in the woods by the cave, and I had tossed the gun through the doorway to Megan after forcing her inside the hallway. Only with a single bullet in the chamber though. Just to show I have more mercy than she did. I’m still thinking about what to do with the gold once I dig it up. One thing I’m certain of is that some of it will go towards the families of Tanner, Ryan and Alice. As for the elixir, I eventually did get it to Emma. The doctors were flabbergasted when the next MRI revealed she no longer had a tumor. In a strange way, saving her feels as though my friends didn’t die in vain. Besides, she didn’t know about Megans plan, so why would I let her suffer the consequences?   
  
While I do feel bad for her because she no longer has an older sister, not a day goes by that I don’t think about the horrible fate that my friends met in that pit. Maybe they’re dead, maybe they’re still down there. I’ve thought about telling the police what really happened but every time I’ve tried, they haven’t listened. In fact, a few of the officers even went into the cave but came out an hour later saying they didn’t find any Greek inscriptions or “magic doorways” and that I should just tell them what really happened to my friends. The only explanation they’ve been able to come up with is that we all came out here for a good time, took some magic mushrooms, and they all got lost falling off of a cliff while I hallucinated everything.    
  
No one will listen but I needed to tell someone, so I decided to tell my story here. So if you ever find a Greek inscription and it leads to some creepy elevator, do yourself a favor. [Don’t get on](https://www.reddit.com/user/UnderdonetoastHorror).
