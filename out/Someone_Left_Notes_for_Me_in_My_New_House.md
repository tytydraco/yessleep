Part 1: The First Note

I’ve never posted anything like this before, but after everything that happened, I can’t keep it to myself anymore.
Maybe writing it down will help me make sense of it.
Maybe it’ll just make it worse. I don’t know.

About four months ago, I moved into a small rental house just outside town. It wasn’t anything fancy — two bedrooms, old carpet, leaky faucet — but it was cheap and I needed a fresh start.
The landlord barely said two words during the walkthrough.
He handed me the keys, told me to "stay out of the attic," and left.

I didn’t think much of it at the time.

The first few weeks were uneventful. I worked during the day, unpacked at night, and slowly made the place feel like home.
It was... lonely, sure.
The neighbors kept to themselves.
Sometimes I felt like I was the only person on the whole street.

About three weeks in, I found the first note.

It was a Sunday afternoon. I was rearranging the kitchen cabinets, trying to figure out a better place for my coffee mugs.
When I pulled out a dusty stack of paper plates left by the previous tenant, something fluttered out and landed on the counter.

A piece of yellow lined paper, folded twice.

No envelope. No signature.

Inside, written in shaky black ink:

"DON'T TRUST THE WALLS."



That’s all it said.

No explanation. No context.

At first, I laughed it off. Probably a leftover joke from the last person who lived here. Some bored teenager, maybe.
Still, something about the handwriting made my stomach twist.
It was messy but deliberate, like whoever wrote it had been in a hurry... or scared.

I tossed it in the trash and didn’t think about it again.


The second note showed up three days later.

This time, it was tucked into the bathroom mirror frame — a tiny piece of paper folded so small I almost missed it.

Written in the same shaky hand:

"It watches when you sleep."



Now, I was creeped out.

I’d cleaned that bathroom top to bottom when I moved in.
There was no way I missed a piece of paper stuck behind the mirror.

I checked every cabinet, every drawer, every closet in the house after that.
Nothing else.
For a while.



Then the dreams started.

I don’t remember most of them.
Just flashes:
Standing in the hallway.
Hearing soft tapping from inside the walls.
Seeing something long and thin move just out of the corner of my eye.

When I’d wake up, the house would be silent.
Except once — around 3:17 AM — when I swear I heard whispering through the bedroom vent.

Words I couldn’t understand.
But they sounded... wrong. Like someone imitating human speech without fully knowing how.


Last night, I found the third note.

It wasn’t hidden this time.
It was sitting right in the middle of my bed when I came home from work.

Bigger paper this time. Full-sized. And the message was longer:

"The cracks aren’t cracks. They’re mouths."



I don’t know if I should stay here anymore.
But the worst part is...
I checked the front door.

Still locked.

Windows, locked too.

Nobody could’ve gotten inside.

At least, nobody I could see.
