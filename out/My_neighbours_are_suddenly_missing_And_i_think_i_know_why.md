Well im getting frustrated and i dont know what i am going to do but the only thing i can think of is getting this off my chest.


Me: 14 year old female, my brothers 18 and 9 and my two parents moved to the uk in the countryside

We thought it was a fresh start seeing as the old place we lived in was terrible. So we moved to the countryside, it was lovely we all enjoyed the neighbours company, everyone especially the kids there were super keen on us moving in the old shaggy house that was left there. No one inside.

We learned from the people in the town after moving to this old shaggy house was that it was owned by this quite famous family years and years ago. 

I asked the man who was showing us the town why they were famous. He looked very uncomfortable and frowned when i asked him, then finally his teammate told me something that haunts me to this day.

Apparently, there used to be a family that lived where we were. They were called the Larrings, the parents had two little twin sisters and one brother - he told me that one of the twin girls went around the forest with her pink bicycle and went missing, the two things that the family and the neighbours didnt understand was that there  was no crime where they lived, and second the daughter always stayed in the eyeview of the parents and the girl was described as responsible.


He didnt finish the story but he sternly looked at me and said “kiddo, whatever you do… do not go in the forest.” 

I wish i listened. I wish i listened. I wish i listened. 


We got home and it was lunchtime. I decided to see if i can make any friends near by, so i did, i met a girl my age called Ronnie. She was one of a kind, i bonded with her really quickly and two of these boys that were her friend, they were super immature and nice at the same time. 

However heres were things go downhill. We’ve been in this house for 3 months, nothing has happened - only when my nine year old brother plays football outside thats when things get dark.

Remember when i told you i had to stay away from the forest.? Well no one told that to my younger brother, i had to look after him whilst my older brother and parents went into town, i remember him throwing his ball kicking it side to side, then i watched the ball drift into the forest, and him running after it.

I screamed, i called his name over and over again as i ran out from my seat and flew to the front door in panic, as i opened the door and peered out my brother was gone. 

It was like he disappeared. The only thing that was left was his football that i saw from where i was standing, I remember dialing my mum and the police, soon after my brother was missing. A search party was held, days went by and my mind was in a blurry state.


Me and that man that told me the story begged and begged that no one goes into the forest but obviously no one listens to a fourteen year old responsible for a missing child and an old man who lies all the time. After the search party was released none of those people came back, everyone was in shock and ordered people not to go into the forest. 

Things became a disaster because kids will prank eachother and force one to go in there and then theres a case about that child. All the time. And even if you investigate the missing child’s friend, you wont get a word out of them, they are speechless - traumatised.

Back to the main part of my story, the old man would come to me and tell me some key details about the forest, he would always seem so weirded out by what he was saying - i started to become more suspicious by the day because the only thing i wanted was my brother back, and he was the only source of information i had.


Anyways what he told me left me fucked up for life. The kids that went missing in our neighbourhood always left something behind they carried, if it was sweets or a phone or shoes, you would always see something left behind. It was always where they went missing, so my brother disappeared infront of our house. The only thing left was his football, on the grass untouched.


So he then got to the Larrings story, he explained that there was something abnormal in the forest that was not human. Even though it sounded uninteresting, he told me that he had a glimpse of a boy with a scoop of black curly hair, sewed eyes and a basketball top. I thought he was talking about Christian, Ronnies friend so i was a bit put of by this explaination. 


He then explained how the little girl went missing and he recovered the body years after, he told me that the face of the girl was  replaced with strings as if a five year old tried remaking her expression.


After that he told me something that turned my blood cold. He explained that the entity feeds off a kind of emotion, he lures these people in by voices of their loved ones - they assume its someone calling there name so they run in there finding out. 

“You know what happens next..” he growls as he adjusts his position on the chair.


“Thats some bullshit story.. i want my brother back, stop wasting my damn time” i snapped.

“Hes not coming back.” He said

“How do you know huh? Your just some loner who thinks he can rip people off with some stupid magical monster-“

“My daughters missing. I havent seen her alive for over 40 years. My family has moved out torn apart, they dont know that i watched it all happen, every kid that i see with my own eyes are all happy, cheerful to go into this forest. Then they go in and i never see them again, i know why now, i warned everyone i was sworn to protect the people of this town, i cannot leave. Im stuck in this town, i dont age i live a life seeing people’s faces get ripped apart, i wish i never moved. I wish i never thought this place was a dream come true. I wish i listen. I wish i listened. I wish i listened.”

He repeated agitatedly.


He was right. All along. I never did see my brother again, i wondered what life would be like with Ronnie, Christian and my brother. They are missing, they will never be found, and i know why, i made them disappear.


Theres a new family that joined our neighbourhood, they went into the same house i was once brought up in, there was two twin girls and a brother. I guess this is what the old man meant when he said he’s stuck here forever - he’s stuck in the same
loop forever.
