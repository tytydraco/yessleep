I’m a 32 year old male, and have been living in my apartment for a few years. The building is an old Victorian house in New England that has been renovated into a Duplex. My upstairs apartment is empty, and I live alone on the first floor.

I suffer from severe insomnia. As I’m writing this, it’s 10 in the morning. I’m at a complete loss at how to explain all of this. Last night, I experienced true hell. I’m still frozen in shock and fear. Please tell me I’m not losing my mind.

Three nights ago, my bedroom fire alarm started moving.

I’m aware this is a small thing, and with my insomnia it could easily be explained away as a hallucination. As soon as I shut the lights out, I find myself staring at this tiny green flashing light on my ceiling by the bedroom door. One blink every ten seconds. 

Blink. The light was suddenly five feet to the left. Another, and the light moved again. I turned my bedside lamp on thinking I may have a firefly playing tricks on me. The alarm was in its rightful home, and there wasn’t another light source in sight. I continued testing this theory, timing the light flickers in the pitch black. The light would flash, then flash again several feet away. At one point, there were TWO flashing lights nearly ten feet apart. As morning came, my alarm went off. I was exhausted.

I inspected the fire alarm closely. It was an older model with no real visible markings. The light blinked innocently every ten seconds just as it should. I dragged myself to work and wrote it off as a hallucination brought on by insomnia. 

That afternoon after work and dinner, I passed out on my couch from exhaustion. Sleep finally came and I woke up around 10pm in a complete daze. The apartment was dark and silent as I made my way to bed. As soon as I opened the door, two green lights flickered brightly beneath my bed. I jumped back and turned on the bedroom light. 

My paranoia was getting out of hand at this point. There was nothing under my bed, and the fire alarm above the door flashed in its usual pattern. I crawled into bed, turned the light off, and tried to sleep. That’s when the noise started.

The alarm let off a sudden shrill beep. In my anxious exhausted state, I quickly sat up to look at the alarm. The light was red. I knew I needed to call maintenance the next day, as I was not allowed to replace the batteries on my own. I spent the night with my ears covered by my pillow trying to ignore the shrill intermittent beep. As I waited for the sun to rise, I began noticing a bright flash accompanying the beep. Far too bright to be from a tiny source like the alarm, I felt chills begin creeping up my back. I opened my eyes.

The alarm light was gone. High up near the top of my doorway were two laser red dots, six inches apart. The lights moved slowly through the threshold of my open door, never blinking. I unfroze myself and quickly turned my lamp on. My bedroom door slammed with such force the entire room shook. My body was frozen in fear. I took a deep breath.

I’m losing it, I thought. Everything was in its rightful place. The bedroom door was even slightly ajar as I had left it. I cautiously scoured the house for intruders, gripping a pocket knife until my hand was numb. Nothing at all, other than the “low battery” beep of my fire alarm in the background. I needed to call maintenance first thing. 

I laid back down, and turned off the light. The red light flashed normally and the beeping felt almost like a familiar rhythm. I was terrified, but I slept. 

I awoke feeling anxious. The fire alarm light was back to green and the beeping felt had stopped. I called maintenance right away and told them I had a fire alarm acting up. The guy on the other end paused, and asked if I was sure. I repeated myself and he stayed silent for a moment before saying that they would send someone first thing the next day. My heart sank. I needed reassurance, and I don’t know how I could live through another night.

Work dragged on. My body ached with tension, and my eyes were ready to burst. When I finally made it home, I decided to sleep on the couch for the night. Around 9pm began the worst nightmare of my entire life.

As soon as the sun set and darkness had filled my apartment, the beep came back. This time it was louder and far more shrill. I was right on the verge of sleep when I heard my bedroom door creak open in the distance. I shot awake, frantically looking for my phone to get a light. I turned to look toward my bedroom.

Two bright red lights were floating down my hallway. Unblinking, and seething. The beep became louder as the lights moved like eyes on a massive body moving towards the couch. I scrambled to the floor as the beeping intensified. Frantically crawling in the pitch black, I spotted an orange glow from the kitchen. 

Using this light as guidance, I ran into the kitchen. What I saw shook me to my core. 

The room was ablaze in a tornado of fire coming from the old pantry area. The blinding heat sent me reeling back toward the front door. I glanced back to see two green lights floating six inches apart above my couch as the entire empty building was engulfed in flames.

As I’m now writing this at 10am, I’m outside with the fire department and police. The fire is out, and they are chatting nearby about how old faulty electrical work was the culprit. I listened in as the fire Chief approached the building landlord, and began berating him.

 I froze solid when I heard what he said.

“In all my years, I’ve never seen negligence this bad. There wasn’t a single fire alarm installed in the whole damn place. You’re lucky the fire alone woke him up.”
