The well beyond the lake

It all started as a child’s game, just something to pass the time. When we’re kids, we often do silly things out of boredom. It’s normal. But sometimes, when these games go too far, the consequences can be much worse than we expect.

In the quiet town of Miller’s Grove, two kids one day got very bored and naturally decided to play a game—a simple, fun game that everyone has probably played. I’m sure you did too. It’s called Tag, you’re it!

‘Jack, let’s play a game,’ Emma said, full of energy and enthusiasm.

‘Sure, Emma. What game?’ Jack asked.

‘Tag, you’re it!’ Emma replied with a giggle, excited to play.

Jack, being a curious and energetic boy, wondered how it was played. Instead of an explanation, he received a poke on the shoulder followed by a ‘Tag, you’re it!’ Emma then ran toward the backyard, and Jack figured he should follow.

As Emma was running away from Jack, she found herself cornered. In the tension of the moment, she acted on instinct, jumping over the fence and heading for the main street. Jack followed her and finally caught up on a hill they’d never been on before. They both took a minute to catch their breath and curiously looked to the other side of the hill.

‘Wow!’ Jack exclaimed. ‘What’s that?’ He pointed towards an old mill in the distance.

‘I don’t know, but it looks older than Grandpa Fane,’ Emma said.

‘Let’s check it out,’ Jack suggested.

‘But... but we shouldn’t. It’s...’

‘Come on, Emma, do you have something better to do?’ Jack urged.

Emma sighed and followed him to the mill. It seemed abandoned and didn’t have much of interest, but to them, it felt like the most exciting thing they’d seen all week.

They quickly grew bored of it and decided to explore their surroundings. They found more and more old, abandoned buildings each day, sneaking out to explore and coming back before their parents could catch them. Sometimes, they even lied, saying they were having a sleepover at the other’s house, just to go out at night. It became a hobby they eventually quit when there wasn’t much left to explore and the excitement had faded. Now, at fifteen and heading into high school, Emma and Jack, living in this quiet town forgotten by time, needed something. And Jack knew exactly what that was.”

Jack decided to call Emma to tell her about his plan.

"Hey Emma, are you awake?"

"Yes, Jack. What do you want? It’s 3 a.m.," she replied, sounding annoyed.

"Remember that lake near the old mill we used to visit as kids?"

"Yeah, what’s up with that? And why can’t this wait until morning?"

"There’s a well on the other side of the lake, in the forest. Some guy told me it’s really creepy—he said it gave him a feeling of unease and tension. It’s probably even older than the mill. I thought you might like to check it out, just like in the old days."

"This is what you call me for at 3 a.m.? Seriously, Jack, grow up."

"But I thought it would be fun..."

"Go to sleep, bro," she says, and hangs up

The next morning, Emma realized she had been too harsh with Jack. She felt guilty for her response, understanding that her bad mood had been influenced by the stress from school and her parents’ constant fighting. Reading horror stories, especially creepypasta about abandoned places, had always been her escape. She decided she should cut Jack some slack.

She called Jack, her voice softer this time. "Hey Jack, I’m sorry for what I said last night. I’ve been dealing with a lot, and I took it out on you. But you know what? You’re right. It could be fun, just like old times. Let’s check out that place tonight."

Jack was taken aback. "Wait, really? I didn’t expect this. What changed your mind?"

Emma took a deep breath, recalling their childhood adventures. "You made me remember how much fun we had as kids, playing games and exploring every corner of this town—even at night, even when we were scared. It felt special, and I really miss that."

Jack’s voice softened with nostalgia. "Me too, Emma. Sometimes I miss playing hide and seek by the lake. Back then, it was just the two of us and... David."

Emma’s tone grew serious. "Jack, we don’t talk about that anymore. The past is the past. We were kids; we couldn’t have done anything."

Jack sighed. "I know, but sometimes I wonder if he’s still out there somewhere. We never even looked for him; we were too scared."

Emma reassured him. "Jack, the police looked everywhere. The town isn’t very big. They would have found him by now."

Jack nodded slowly. "I guess you’re right. But we’ll still go to that well, right?"

Emma’s voice was determined. "Yeah, damn right we will."

Alright, that’s the spirit. So we’re doing it tonight?”

“Yeah, see you tonight, bro.”

Jack was now very excited and also impatient. He couldn’t wait for tonight when they’d explore that well. He took a nap to help pass the time.

When the phone rang, he woke up and answered. “Come on, Jack, are you ready?”

Muttering in a sleepy voice, he replied, “I’ll be out in 10.”

He rapidly prepared and went out to meet his childhood friend. “Take this,” Emma said, handing him a flashlight. “It’s better than your phone’s.”

“Wow, thanks,” he said gratefully.

On the way there, they only talked about their memories of previous visits in the area, not expecting anything out of the ordinary. They arrived at the well, and Jack held the flashlight above it so they could both peek inside.

Jack’s expression turned from curiosity to shock and terror. In the well, there was a distorted, macabre reflection that looked like them but had an odd grin, smiling wider than is humanly possible.

Both were left in utter shock, and as their adrenaline kicked in, they ran, trying to get out of the woods. Emma couldn’t keep her balance on the slippery mud and fell hard. Jack stopped to help her up. While he was doing that, Emma glanced back and saw the reflections closing in with that morbid smile. They ran again, not looking back because they were too afraid.

They gained some distance and Emma pointed at a wooden shack in the woods. “Let’s hide in there!” They ran inside and quietly sat down.

“Oh my god, oh my god, Jack, please tell me you have signal here.”

“You know damn well there’s no signal here,” Jack said, trying to stay calm. “Just calm down, okay? We’re safe here.”

“What were those things, Jack? Who the hell told you about this place? This is insane!”

“Some guy from my chemistry class. He’s a weirdo, but I didn’t think it would be a haunted well.”

Emma panicked even more, sobbing in fear from the shock. Her knee was also bleeding from the fall. Jack was trying to remain calm, convincing himself that it was just a game—a kids' game of hide and seek.

Suddenly, there was a loud bang on the door, followed by a stronger hit that broke it. Both Jack and Emma, in complete shock and panic, found themselves face to face with their reflections once again. This time, the reflections spoke.

“Hello, Jack. Hello, Emma. Imagine this as a game of tag, you’re it. Right now, we’re it, but soon enough, the roles will be reversed.”

Emma broke the window and jumped out, acting on instinct just like when Jack first chased her. In an instant, Jack followed her. The reflections seemed to be slow but were certainly frightening.

Creeped out and terrified, the two kids didn’t know which way to go. As they were checking their surroundings, Jack felt a hand on his shoulder and immediately jumped in fear. He turned around to see David.

Both, even more shocked than before, exclaimed in unison, “David?!”

“Long time no see. These things that chased you have chased me as well. If they catch you, you’ll take their place in the well, and they’ll take your place in the real world.”

“You’ve been here for almost 5 years? And how come they haven’t caught you?”

“Well, they might be smart, but they aren’t very fast. Their weakness is light. If they come at you, use the flashlight to blind them.”

The reflections appeared again, and when the two kids turned their heads back to David, he was gone, as if he had never been there. They ran again, heading for the mill this time, but the reflections blocked their path, forcing them deeper into the woods, farther from the town. After hours of hiding and running back and forth, they were exhausted and confused. They ended up accidentally going back to the well and were cornered by the reflections.

Jack remembered what David had told them. “Emma, use the flashlight.”

“Yeah, you’re right,” she said.

As Emma turned on the flashlight and pointed it at her reflection, it seemed affected. Then, unexpectedly, the reflection sprinted towards Emma and swapped places with her.

Jack screamed at the top of his lungs, “No, Emma!” But David had said it makes you weak.
David once again appears
“I lied, Jack. Don’t you get it? I’m not your David. I’m also a reflection.”

No, no, this can’t be,” Jack said, his voice breaking as he tried to comprehend the situation. Despite being powerless and exhausted, he made one last desperate run for escape. But his reflection was swift and caught up with him, taking his place as well.

And so, this is the tragic ending of what began as a simple game for two kids who had a rough childhood and just wanted to relive the excitement of their youth. What had once been a hobby, abandoned as they grew older, returned for one final, fateful game of Tag, You’re It—one with the ultimate stakes: their lives.

In the cold, dark reality of the well, the echoes of Jack and Emma remained, their grinning reflections now inhabiting the world they once knew. The real Jack and Emma, trapped in the well, were left to confront the terrifying truth of their last, game.
