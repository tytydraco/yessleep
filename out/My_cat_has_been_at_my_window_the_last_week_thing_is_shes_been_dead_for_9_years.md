My cat has been meowing outside my window the past week, the thing is my cat has been dead for 9 years.


I live in a little suburban town with my parents. We’ve lived here for a year. When I was little, I had a cat named Belle. I was obsessed with Tinkerbell, so I named her Belle. She was a beautiful black cat; super sweet and soft. Sadly, she got hit by a car and died when I was 7. I was always sensitive when it came to cats, always having a horrible reputation. Especially black cats. “Black cats bring misfortune,” my mother says one night as her and I drive back from dinner. I remember she took her right hand and made and x motion with her finger three times, when I asked what it was for, she simply said “The Lord’s protection.” Now, Ive never been one for the paranormal. It’s always been simple Ghost Hunting shows I point out how fake they are, never the less I enjoy them. My grandma insists how much of a spiritual connection my family has with the dead; and I always laughed at it until now. 

The past week, I’d always wake up around 1-2 AM in a cold sweat; feeling like sharp eyes were pricking at my spine. I’d been hearing the same, pathetic mewl Belle always used to spill. I knew it was her; her meow was always more hoarse. I could hear her body rubbing against the window that lay 5 feet from my bed; yearning to be let inside. I stare in both surprise and fear; fear that whatever is outside of my window is not my cat, but something demonic. 


Yesterday, it happened as of usual by now. I raise from my bed and move over to the window, placing my fingertips against the curtains that shielded my view from whatever may lay out there. “Belle?” I whispered, my voice strained with worry and anticipation, “Is that you Belle Belle?” To which Belle responds with a raspy meow. I slowly shift the curtains aside; expecting to see my little fluffy ball of sunshine. I freeze, sweat dripping down my forehead as my eyeballs went practically bloodshot. There stood a lanky creature, body like a human with ragged yellow skin, like it had jaundice. It had a few strands of hair poking from it’s head. From the hairline down; it’s face was skinned off. It’s eyes bulged from the sockets as it began to bash it’s head against my window, crimson blood scorching against the panel as I scream in terror. My mom heard and came rushing in; I turn around when I see her and she asks me what was going on. I cannot fathom words to speak. As I turn around; it was gone. No blood in the window; nothing. My mom has been seeking out potential therapy for me, though I know what I saw was there, I swear I’m not crazy, I feel that skinless face watching my every move. Ever since it happened it feels like a pair of eyes are on me. Please help me.
