I don’t know if this is the right sub for this, but I need some advice on something.



I’ve been in the psych ward for about a month now (voluntary before anyone asks). The days honestly aren’t that bad, nothing like the movies about sociopathic people lol. They smile at us, some play board games like monopoly and clue, and chat for a while about any and every topic. One of my favourite nurses, Zara, is expecting her 1st daughter soon, and has chatted with me about some baby names. The meals aren’t that bad, either, but they get repetitive pretty quickly. There’s a huge collection of books here that some of the nurses gave away for free. I’m on my 4th one now.

I can’t stop thinking about how weird the night staff are, though.



I didn’t even notice at first, you’re supposed to be asleep right?  Lights out at 10, doors locked, meds kick in, done deal. But I’ve had insomnia since I was a kid, and lying in bed at 3AM means you start thinking a lot. Like how the night staff always walk in sync, there’s never a misplaced footstep. Kinda like they’re dancing in a music video. I’ve never heard any of them speak, but I suppose that’s normal. They aren’t supposed to be loud while the patients are sleeping, but what weirds me out is the times they come in and check on us. You would think it’s every hour, but we have a clock on the wall and they always come in at 12:33AM, 3:33AM, and 5:33AM. Then the day staff come in at 7AM and the day resumes as normal.



I told the day staff about the weirdness of it all, but they just brushed me off, told me to sleep earlier and that they’ll give me some melatonin if I’m having trouble. I suppose me being sleep deprived doesn’t help my imagination.



I was chatting with one of the people in my ward about it the next day, Aaron. He’s a middle aged man, in the ward for a mental disorder or something. Not really my business. But anyways, out of nowhere he dropped this bomb in the conversation: “They don’t like it when you’re awake.”

I just paused and was like, “what?” He glanced around and then whispered it again, before seeing a nurse coming over and starting to laugh loudly. I just glanced at him and the nurse, while she just smiled at me regretfully. Later that evening, when I was watching the channel they always had on in the lounge, I saw a nurse giving Aaron some medication. I thought it was slightly weird since Aaron only has morning meds but I guess he just got a new prescription.



When lights out came, guess who couldn’t sleep? Me! I was staring at the ceiling, trying to count sheep or whatever, when *all* the doors down the hallway opened in perfect harmony. Then they all slammed against the walls behind them so loudly it echoed down the hallways. I shot upwards and stared towards the door, but no one and nothing was there. I stayed there for a while, the only sound being my shaky, shallow breathing. Eventually, my nerves were so fried that I passed out.



The next morning, I was so tired one of the patients had to hit me with a pillow *3 times* before I even stirred. I had breakfast with the others, but even above all the conversational noise, my thoughts were louder. I kept wondering about the doors slamming. Why would they slam like that? All the doors have a locking mechanism to make sure people don’t smack their heads if they decide to mess with them. And if they did slam, then how did no one else wake up to it? Aaron’s one of *the most* light sleepers I’ve ever met – and speaking of him, he wasn’t at breakfast this morning. His bed was bare and all the stuff that he brought (and was allowed) into the ward had disappeared. I asked Zara where he was, she just smiled at me like I was stupid and said “There hasn’t been anyone occupying that bed for a couple of months”. I’m dumbfounded to be honest because I played Last-Card with him the day before and he beat me 4 times.



But, yeah. I really don’t know what to do as none of the staff will take me seriously and I can’t tell if this is all in my head or not.
