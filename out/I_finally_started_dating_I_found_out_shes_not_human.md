Growing up I have always been an introvert , only having about 1 to 2 friends who didn’t really hang around with me. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to make new friends I just have extreme social anxiety so it was a difficult task to make friends if they didn’t approach me first. I spent my time sketching and playing guitar even listening and watching Wilbur Soot. My two friends were pretty shy too so we did get along when we did hang around. Overall I was lonely
until we went to our next school year since a new shy girl joined our school who enjoyed anime,guitar and even Wilbur Soot. She was ginger with rose,red cheeks like an apple and body like a godess.

She was worse than me at communicating as she only had one friend which made it my mission to approach her. That was the biggest mistake of my life. I stuck by her as she was the only person who really understood me and she had me in a deep love. Do I want to know if the feeling flowed both ways? In the end it didn’t. Sorry I’m talking about her so much. I just can’t go through this again. Eventually, I did ask her to be my girlfriend with intense shaking and sweating but she did agree.

On Friday, we scheduled to go to a forest and draw the scenes with a bit of some guitar playing. I know that sounds edgy for a first date but we liked it.
The day prior I prepped myself for the interaction and packed my guitar, sketchbook and my faber-castelle pencils and went to bed excited but nervous. The scheduled time was 6:30 on Saturday right when it usually starts to get dark.


When I opened my eyes I jumped out of bed and got dressed. For most of the day I practiced a new song on guitar and drew a few of my idols in an anime style. After a little bit it was 6:00 it was a thirty minute walk so I reckoned I would be fine to just leave now. The forest was large and remote and we said we would meet at the opening. As I walked, I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching me and I got scared. I tried to call her to check on her but the call wouldn’t even go through. I began to tear up inside. As I arrived to the entrance all was fine. She was there. Phew. About an hour into drawing and chatting she said she was going to see if theres a good rock to sit on. I thought it was a bit odd and since I thought I was still being watched I asked her if I can come with. All of a sudden, she got angry at me which wasn’t like her she started shouting for me to mind my own business so I quietly said “Ok I’m really sorry.”
She apologised profusely and said she would be back in 20 minutes.

I wish she knew that I was going to follow her anyway. I followed her for 10 minutes and what I saw has traumatised me. There were 10 men standing in a ring and they mumbled in sync “Welcome back have you got him in the spot?” 
“Obviously.” She replied sassily. “What the fuck!” I yelled for the first time in my life. I stumbled back and hit something. I knew for a fact there was nothing behind me at first. I looked forward and she was gone I looked behind me and she stood there. “I’m sorry.” She said starting to cry. She pulled a crowbar out of her bag and swung at me. In the nick of time, I ducked making her knock out the man approaching me from behind. I pulled out my pocket knife and slashed it at her cheek cutting it but something strange happened. It regenerated?!?!? In a swift motion she kicked me with immense strength sending me through a tree into an opening. I looked beside me and saw both my friends ruthlessly ripped apart and spread around.

Blood dripped from my forehead into my eyes. She got closer. I shouted “IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE YOU BASTARD!” As my contingencies set into motion. Prior to the meeting, I asked all the boys in my classroom to keep an eye on us incase anything went south. They all steppe in front of me. “WE THOUGHT YOU WERE NORMAL EMILY!” Shouted my classmate Lucas. The handed me an axe “Kick her ass quiet boy!” My other classmate Benny said. I ran at her with the most confidence I’ve ever had. But that wouldn’t work 4 tentacles erupted out of her back. “You think I will die to an axe?” she said laughing. Tragically she used her tentacles to crush all of them missing five. The five ran after her.  I passed them the axe and took my chance to run for it. I got just on my street when I collapsed.

I woke up in my bed. I thought it was a dream.
But on the wall was “You’re not safe from us.” written in blood. I just want to feel normal again. I just want to have meals with my friends. She never showed up to school after that. The police did a major cover up as they found the knocked out man and ran tests on him. I’ll never be the same. I now get an intense fear when people look or talk to me. Nobody believes my story. When I go out I catch glimpses of her watching me. In the dark, she watches. In the light,she watches. She  recently got into my home. Im not safe. As  I write this she would’ve been watching if I didn’t do what I did.

I ran to the same forest. I said “I give up.” “Take me.” She walked to me and said “It’s about time.” We now murder and eat together. I now have the same abilities as her. If you’re reading this thanks for signing up to be our next meal :)
