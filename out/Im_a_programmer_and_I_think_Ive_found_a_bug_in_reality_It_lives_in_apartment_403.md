I'm a programmer. My world is one of logic, syntax, and order. If `x`, then `y`. A bug is just a rule you haven't understood yet. Everything, eventually, makes sense. I live my life by that principle. I work from home, a freelance web developer in a quiet, modern apartment building in Beppu. My apartment is my office, my cafeteria, my entire world, and I like it that way. It's a closed system. Controlled.

At least, it was.

It started last Tuesday. I'd been staring at my monitor for ten hours straight, and my eyes felt like they were full of sand. I got up to get some water, and as I stepped into my doorway, my neighbor across the hall, Mrs. Tanaka, was opening her own door. For a single, impossibly long second, the space behind her was not an apartment. It was trees. Tall, black cedars packed so tightly together that no light could get through. There was a floor of damp, dark soil. And it was utterly silent.

Then she stepped inside, the door clicked shut, and the moment was gone.

My first thought wasn't 'monster.' It was 'visual artifact.' A bug in my own wetware. I managed to push the incident to the back of my mind. For a week, the system was stable. Then, the bugs started to multiply.

I saw the lobby security camera's timestamp jump back three hours and then correct itself. The elevator took me to my floor even when the button wouldn't light up. One night, a high-frequency hum pulsed through the wall from the vacant apartment next door.

A programmer cannot ignore a pattern. I opened a new file: `Anomalies.log`. I recorded everything, trying to find a rational explanation. `[Hypothesis: Faulty CCTV clock capacitor.]`, `[Hypothesis: Elevator button LED burnt out.]`, `[Hypothesis: Sound from HVAC pipes?]`.

I needed external validation. The next morning, I saw Mrs. Tanaka checking her mail. I asked her casually, "Have you noticed anything strange with the elevator lately?"

She turned to me, her expression melting from confusion into genuine concern. "The elevator? No, Sora-san, I don't think so." She took a half-step closer. "Are you feeling alright? You seem very tired."

Her kindness was the worst possible response. It confirmed the problem wasn't the building; it was me. I retreated to my apartment, my face burning. My log file no longer felt like a scientific document. It felt like the diary of a man losing his mind.

Her concern should have sent me to a doctor. Instead, it sent me back to my code.

The only thing I could trust was my data. `Anomalies.log` became my obsession. I started actively hunting for glitches, my freelance work forgotten. The log grew to 57 entries. I needed to visualize it. I found a digital blueprint of my building, assigned coordinates to every anomaly, and wrote a simple Python script to plot them.

I expected a random scatter plot, confirming my own cognitive chaos. I ran the script.

It wasn't random. It was a cluster. A tight, undeniable grouping of incidents with a bright red core on the fourth floor. A cold wave of vindication washed over me, followed by a much colder wave of dread. I wasn't crazy. This was real.

My fingers trembled as I wrote a new function to calculate the geometric center of all 57 data points. The script spit out a set of coordinates. I cross-referenced it with my blueprint, my heart hammering. The epicenter wasn't just on the fourth floor. It was in the dead center of a single unit.

Apartment 403.

I stared at the number. Four. Three. 4-3. A chill seeped into my bones. It felt like a variable name in a block of malicious code. A key I was never supposed to find.

The question "Am I crazy?" was replaced by "What is in that room?" I needed proof that wasn't filtered through my own senses. I rigged a webcam inside a fake Wi-Fi repeater and aimed it at the door to 403.

For twelve hours, nothing. Then, my motion sensor triggered. The door's latch clicked. It drifted inward a few inches, revealing only a sliver of perfect, matte-black darkness. The fluorescent light from the hallway didn't shine into the apartment. It bent at the threshold. It stretched, warped, and was pulled into the darkness like water down a drain before the door clicked shut.

I had the recording. It was impossible, a violation of physics, but it was proof. My hands shaking, I opened a browser and started typing every keyword I could think of.

*"Beppu apartment glitch"* *"doorway opens into forest"* *"light bending in doorway"* *"43 phenomenon Japan"*

The last one hit. A link to a subreddit called r/nosleep. The post was titled: "I'm a sound engineer who moved to a remote Japanese village for silence..." I read about a 43 hertz hum. The number hit me like a physical blow. I read about his escape to a hotel right here, in Beppu.

From there, I quickly found another post: "I'm a Shinto priestess..." I read about a devouring silence, a shrine on the coast near my city. The pieces crashed into place. The sound and the silence. The engineer and the priestess. They were here. And the phenomenon they described hadn't stopped. It had just moved. It had settled down the hall from me.

And so I'm writing this. Right now. My hands are shaking. I'm not a sound engineer with special equipment. I'm not a priestess with centuries of tradition. I'm just a programmer who lives on the fourth floor, and my entire logical world has been rendered obsolete.

This post is a desperate, last-ditch effort. This is a message.

To the sound engineer who escaped to Beppu, and the priestess on the coast, I've read your warnings. I think the thing you were dealing with didn't die. It didn't go away. It followed you.

I think it found a place to nest. It's inside Apartment 403. I don't know what the old man who lives there is, but the light bends at his doorway, and the number on his door is the same as the frequency of your hum.

Please. You are the only two people in the world who might understand this. You have to talk to each other. You have to do something before my neighbor comes home... or before whatever is in his apartment decides to visit mine.
