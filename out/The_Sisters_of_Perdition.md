I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building I found the journal of someone named Kyle. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.

RIP Dora Duskwood 1766- 1839 the tombstone read.

Me and my family were standing around the tombstone, saying our farewells to the old witch Dora.

Dora had burst into flames while saying the lords prayer at church on Sunday. She was going to give a sermon on love, and how that connected to honor they mother and father. Before she started her sermon she started with the lords prayer and burst into flames. She ran down the aisle, screaming at the top of her lungs and fell in a heap at the church entrance.

I had mixed feeling about Dora myself, she always told me she loved me, but her actions rarely lined up with that. I hadn't noticed when I was younger but as I got older it became more and more obvious.

There was a bunch of us that stood around her tombstone. Old Carl, my mother Deb, my father Dale, my brothers Sean and Scott, My cousins Christie and Jeffery, and their parents, auntie Die and uncle Mike.

My Aunt Carla and her family were not present, living far away.

I was 12, Sean was 9 and Scott was 7. Jeff was 19 and Christie was 17. My mother was 40 and so was my father. Auntie die and Uncle Mike were older, I didn't know their exact ages.

Christie sobbed while a priest read uplifting quotes from the bible.

"Pitty not the dead for they have rejoined our lord in heaven!" the priest read with vigor.

"Poor old Dora" my mother chanted.

"What a sweet, kind, godly woman." Christie wept. "She always gave the best Christmas presents"

"God rest her soul" Auntie Die chanted.

"Do you have anything to say about, poor, sweet old Dora" my mother chanted.

"She was an old woman. I knew her not. She always treated me like a small child." I said in trance.

"She loved you so much" my mother chanted with an unearthly grimace.

After that we went home. At dinner my mother had me say the lords prayer before dinner, and we had my grandmothers favorite meal, meat pie.

That night as I lay in bed I saw Dora's severed head at the foot of my bed. It sat there, looking at me with dark eyes. Her sharp needle like teeth glistening in the moonlight.

"I love you" she chanted.

The next day at breakfast my father ate his eggs and commented "Your grandmother loved you so much."

"She really did" Deb chanted.

"I saw her last night and that's what she said" I said with a confused smile.

"She'll be back, she always is" Deb chanted.

That night when I was getting ready for bed I saw Dora behind me in the mirror. She stood in the half dark with needle like teeth and a grimace that reminded me of my mother.

"I love you" she said, forked tongue moving about.

I saw her again as I was falling asleep. This time her head her head was halfway up the bed. Her Needle like teeth glistened in the moonlight.

"I love you" she said with an demonic ring.

"I love you too granny" I said in a trance.

The next day at breakfast I ate my bacon and asked. "Has anyone else seen Dora? She appeared to me last night too." I said in a terrified trance.

"She loved you so much" my mother chanted. "That's why only you can see her. She will get you soon."

That night as I got ready for bed I looked in the mirror, Dora was right behind me this time. She put her hand on my shoulder. I had never been more terrified in my life.

"Tonight is the night. I love you" She chanted like a demon.

I have forgotten to write my journal recently. But I'm going to record everything after Dora's funeral right here before I put my lantern out.
