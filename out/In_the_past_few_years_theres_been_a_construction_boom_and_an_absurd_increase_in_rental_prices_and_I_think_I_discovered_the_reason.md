I recently noticed that in the past few years there's been a lot of construction happening in my city. Overhead cranes visible against the sky, non-stop sounds of jackhammering, construction vehicles constantly driving up and down the streets. New buildings going up. Apartment complexes, commercial highrises. Mostly downtown, but that's where the density is. I didn't give it too much thought, to be honest. It just seemed normal for a city to be expanding, growing. Development is a positive. Who wouldn't want to live in a place that's booming.

Then I noticed the rental prices in some of these apartment buildings. High, very high. To the point of being almost impossibly high. Like, who can afford to pay these prices? And the units aren't big. In fact, they're rather tiny. More than one small family couldn't fit into one, yet I don't know many small families who could afford to pay that much rent. So I got interested. I went around to a few of the buildings and asked about renting, about how flexible the prices were. “Oh, those are set by the home office,” I was told by one guy, “so there's nothing I can do. Take it or leave it.” Another told me to ask again in a few weeks “because the prices fluctuate on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis. It's all controlled by the algorithm.”

*The algorithm.*

Someone must have made that, right?

One night, on my way back home, I noticed something else that was strange. Almost all the lights in these new buildings were off. It was 9 p.m. Dark. Who's asleep at nine? Moreover, who's not asleep but keeps the lights off? And if you can afford to rent a unit at these prices, surely you could afford to pay the electricity costs to turn your lights on.

All the new buildings were the same way. Rows of black, unlit windows. It was positively eerie, and once I'd seen it, I couldn't unsee it. I lay awake in bed that night trying to think of an explanation, but nothing came to me. Only nightmares.

I skipped work in the morning and went back, tired, to the rental offices. This time I asked about unit availability. Did they have a lot of empty units to rent? The answer was the same everywhere. No, only a few. “So you'd better act fast.” Was that the truth or was it a sales tactic? 

When I told a friend about what I'd discovered, he suggested I look into the management companies, the construction companies. “But to me it seems like you're right that there's no one living there. The explanation, however, is rather simple. It's Chinese buying up property to secure assets outside China,” he said.

“Except no one's buying these units,” I responded. “They're renting them.”

But my friend's advice to check out the companies involved was sound, so that's what I did. I physically went to the worksites and noted the names on the signs, vehicles and equipment. All had websites, phone numbers, representatives. I talked to the workers too. They were all getting paid. All had bosses. The only thing strange, it seemed to them, was my interest. The property management companies were legit as well. None of it made sense to me, but I was starting to doubt whether I actually had any sense if no one but me was paying attention to this. Maybe I was the problem.

That's when I started getting those targeted ads online. You know the ones. You tell someone you're looking to buy a pizza oven, and suddenly YouTube is showing you ads for pizza ovens. You search online for unshelled pistachios a few times, and you start seeing nuts everywhere. Well, I started getting ads for condos, office space, and local real estate financing with oddly aggressive language:

STOP LOOKING IMMEDIATELY (and buy your dream home today!)

Now, I consider myself a rational person, I don't get hooked by conspiracy theories, but even I was starting to get a little paranoid, looking over my shoulder whenever I went out into the street, taping across my laptop camera, shutting down and unplugging my electronics. No more television in the evenings. No more doom scrolling on my smartphone before bed. Just silence and books. The ticking of an analogue clock.

But outside—always, everywhere: the cranes and the construction noise, the scaffolding, the freshly poured concrete foundations, the construction workers, the steel beams and brickwork, the heavy industrial equipment and the buildings, so clean, new and seemingly so uninhabited. I'd even read that the buildings pretty much design themselves these days. The architects and the engineers simply look things over and approve.

With the office towers it was harder to tell occupancy than with the apartments, because you expect offices to be empty at night, but after sitting in front of a few for a few weeks I can say they seemed empty during the day too. There were security guards and cleaners and deliveries made, but where were the actual workers? I'll tell you: going into the old buildings in the morning and leaving in the afternoon, like it should be. Old, above-ground parking lots filled with cars during working hours. The new office buildings all have underground parking, controlled entrances/exits, with guards. “But don't you realize how weird it is that no one ever goes in or out of the parking lot?” I yelled at one as he escorted me off “building property.” I had managed only a quick look before he grabbed me, but I can tell you with certainty that it was empty. It was ten o'clock in the morning on a Tuesday and the entire underground parking was empty! Obviously, the guard didn't answer my question. “Ain't my job to notice stuff like that,” he said, threatening to call the cops next time.

That's when I met Andy.

I met him online on an obscure little forum for people who don't tow the mainstream line. I'd been posting my observations everywhere I could (from a library computer, of course) and that's where somebody actually responded. His message said he'd noticed the same things, was equally puzzled and wondered if we could meet. He wanted to show me something. Even as the message got me excited, I knew there was a chance it was a set-up, a way to end my interest for good. Maybe the security guard had reported me to the higher-ups. Maybe I'd caught someone's attention on the library's security footage and they'd matched me with the underground parking incident. Maybe, maybe, maybe.

I met Andy anyway, in a small hotdog place downtown, and I'm glad I did. He was legit. More than that: he had more information than I did because he worked as a handyman for one of the large management companies that owned a number of the city's newest and priciest apartment buildings. In other words, he'd been inside, and after talking to me for a few hours he decided he wanted to show me what he'd seen. “If nothing else, it'll let you maintain your sanity a little longer. The stuff we've noticed—it's real and it's damn weird.”

I showed up late at night at the building Andy worked in, and he let me inside. Then, together, we walked the halls from the first floor to the twenty-first, looking into the units. I swear to you, all of them were uninhabited. But they weren't exactly empty. There was nothing in the kitchen cabinets, the fridge, the dishwasher. No toothbrushes, towels or medications in the bathroom. The bedroom closet held not one piece of clothing. But in each unit there was at least one computer, usually more, plugged in and turned on. Locked. Humming. There was WiFi too, password protected, but no keyboards, mice, printers or peripherals of any other kind. So while there was no sign of human life, there was definite activity. The potential implications made my heart sink. I felt hot, then cold, then I got goosebumps.

“You said you looked into the companies that build and manage new buildings like these,” Andy said. “How far up the chain did you go?”

Not far, I admitted.

“Did you look into the people supposedly running these companies?”

Yes, I said. “If you're asking whether they exist, as far as I can tell they do. They all have a digital footprint.”

“Did you meet any of them?”

Some of the ones further down the chain, I said. Construction workers, security guards, rental agents. “Not the CFOs and CEOs, obviously.” Andy remained silent. “Why? Are you suggesting those *don't* exist?”

“Exist is a tricky notion,” he said. “I think you found ‘digital footprints’ because those are the only footprints they have. I think they're bit-based, not atom-based”—he paused, searching for a word—“entities. Or perhaps just one entity, with many digital faces.”

I felt then as if I were being watched, as if I were in a room filled with digital ghosts, passing through me, and I had to resist the urge to run down the hall, down the stairs and out of the building. “We should go,” I said.

“I know what you're feeling. Trust me, I've felt it too. I've been in these rooms so many times. But nothing ever happens. You go home, sleep, and then you get up in the morning and go to work again as usual. The fear, the anxiety, it never fully goes away, but it does become manageable. I've read that's normal in situations where you're dealing with things you don't understand. Things more complex than yourself.”

“You think they don't care we're here—that we know?”

“They used to turn on the lights, eh? Besides, what is it that we know?”

I couldn't immediately answer. That this is weird. That apartment buildings with no occupants should not exist. That people cannot rent at the prices on the market. That, therefore, whoever (whatever) owns the buildings doesn't want people living in them. That, as a business, the buildings are unprofitable and no company should be building more of them. Yet these things are. The computers hum, connected to the internet. New buildings are being constructed at an increasing rate. People work in them and get paid and go about their own, human, lives.

“That the city—it is now building itself,” I said.

The hum seemed louder.

“A bit-based entity building atom-based structures in the so-called real, atom-based world.”

But for what purpose? Are we like bees, herded into hive-like urban spaces, to produce something for the benefit of something other than us? If so, what is it: what is humanity's honey?

I shuddered, sitting in that apartment unit, and Andy, like he'd read my mind, said, “Lately, I've been considering they may not even have a reason to be at all. We have no evidence they use anything other than systems we've created.” I remembered the rental agent's mention of *the algorithm.* “They may be simply a merging of some of these systems, become more effective at doing, without us, what we created them to help us do in the first place.”

“We should go,” I said again.

This time, Andy agreed and we rode the elevator down to the ground floor, then exited by a back service door. All the way down I imagined—if not outright expected—the elevator to kill us, then the door to refuse to let us out. But none of that happened, and we walked outside, under the stars and the skyscrapers.

Then I went home, went to sleep, got up and went to work as usual.

After work, I wrote all this down in a notebook.

Then I realized the only way to share it widely enough is online, which means feeding it into the system, so that's what I did. I went to the library, scanned and OCR'd the notebook pages and posted the result to reddit. But before I posted it, I proofread it and realized I had to clean it up. There were obvious typos, ones any human would have caught, and I thought: maybe what's truly dreadful is not just being made a slave to one's own system *but being enslaved by a system that's not yet ready to be in [control.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)*
