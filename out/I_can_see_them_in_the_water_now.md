If you’re reading this, I beg you: don’t come to Black Harbor. Whatever lure of adventure, solitude, or curiosity drives you—ignore it. The price is too great.

My name is Elliot Ward, and I was the keeper of the Black Harbor Lighthouse. They told me the stories were just tales to scare tourists. They told me the whispers were only the wind. They lied.

I took the job to escape my past. Years at sea had left me broken, chasing shadows of guilt and regret. The lighthouse, perched on its jagged cliff and surrounded by endless fog, seemed like the perfect place to lose myself. Or so I thought.

The first month passed uneventfully. The work was simple—tend the light, record weather patterns, and report on passing ships. The sound of waves crashing below and the mournful cries of gulls became my constant companions. I grew to appreciate the silence. Then, the whispers began.

At first, they were faint, indistinguishable from the howling wind that battered the tower on stormy nights. But as the days wore on, they grew clearer—snatches of words, pleas, and accusations. “Help us.” “You left us.” “The light is a lie.” I would wake in the dead of night drenched in sweat, the voices murmuring just beyond the edge of hearing.

One night, during a brutal storm, the light went out. I climbed the tower to investigate, the old iron stairs groaning under my weight. Lightning illuminated the interior in staccato bursts, casting long, shifting shadows. As I reached the lantern room, I noticed something odd—a section of the wall looked newer than the rest, as if it had been hastily repaired.

I don’t know what compelled me to chip away at it, but I did. The stones gave way, revealing a hollow space within. There, wrapped in decaying oilcloth, was an old leather-bound journal.

The journal belonged to Elias Hart, a keeper from the late 1800s. His writing began mundane, much like my own logs—weather reports, ship sightings, repairs. But as I read on, his words became erratic, filled with guilt and terror. He confessed to extinguishing the light one stormy night, causing a ship carrying women and children to wreck on the rocks below. He described how the screams haunted him, how he began to hear their voices calling from the sea.

And then… the journal started writing itself.

I thought I was losing my mind. As I held the book, words began to etch themselves into the aged pages before my eyes. They described wrecks I’d never heard of, ships I’d never seen. Dates, names, and even faces appeared in chilling detail. The whispers grew louder, their voices blending into a cacophony of rage and despair. They weren’t just stories—they were records of death.

And then I saw it: my own name.

The entry was brief. “Elliot Ward. December 27. Keeper’s end.” The date was today.

The storm outside grew ferocious, waves crashing against the rocks with a fury that shook the tower. I ran to light the beacon, but the machinery wouldn’t budge. The whispers became screams. I turned, and there he stood.

Elias Hart.

His waterlogged form dripped onto the cold stone floor, his flesh pale and bloated. His eyes—empty sockets filled with writhing blackness—bored into me. He raised a skeletal hand and pointed to the window. I saw the ship, its lights flickering as it fought against the raging sea.

“The sea demands justice,” he rasped, his voice like the groan of ancient wood.

I understood then. The journal wasn’t a guide to salvation—it was a trap. A curse. The keeper must ensure the cycle continues, or the sea will claim him. My choice was clear: extinguish the light and let the shipwreck happen, or fight back and face the wrath of the dead.

I chose to fight.

I threw the journal into the fire, its pages writhing as if alive. The screams reached a deafening crescendo, and Hart lunged at me. His icy hands closed around my throat, and I felt myself being pulled toward the window, toward the churning sea below.

Somehow, I broke free. Grabbing a broken shard of glass, I slashed at him, the blade cutting through his sodden flesh. He recoiled, howling, and vanished into the shadows.

The storm passed. The ship was safe. But the whispers remain.

I’m writing this in my final moments, as the waves lap at the base of the tower. The journal is gone, but the curse is not. I see them now—dozens of faces peering up at me from the water, their eyes filled with rage. They’re coming for me.

If you find this, heed my warning. Do not take the keeper’s post. Do not listen to the whispers. And for God’s sake, never let the light go out.
