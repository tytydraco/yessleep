 

I watched impatiently, tapping my foot on the tile, as the ancient coffee machine on my kitchen counter slowly dripped coffee into the bulbous pot below. This part always took an absurdly long time. I could feel my heart rate steadily increasing as I watched the brown liquid, willing it to hurry. In the meantime, I frothed the milk necessary to transform my boring morning coffee into an equally underwhelming cappuccino. 

I was really starting to miss drinking the caramel macchiato— skinny, with oat milk and extra caramel drizzle, medium in a large cup for extra ice— that, until recently, I had ordered every morning from the café next to the office. The owner told me not to come back, as if it were my fault that stupid barista couldn’t take constructive criticism without crying. 

I added the frothed milk atop the black coffee in my travel mug and started out the door into the dimly lit hallway of my apartment complex. The door had barely closed behind me when I noticed my elderly neighbor standing by the stairs. She did that often, hovering near the staircase, waiting to trap unsuspecting neighbors in a some unremarkable conversation about baked goods or embroidery. I did not have the time for that this morning, nor would I be interested had I all the time in world. 

"Move," I demanded, before she could make any attempt to speak. She frowned but, to my satisfaction, shifted just enough to allow me safe passage down the concrete staircase, which I descended immediately.  My left foot hadn't so much as kissed the bottom step before I remembered that I had left my project portfolio sitting on the kitchen counter next to the barely functional coffee machine. "Fuck," I scolded myself aloud before turning abruptly and racing back up the stairs, two at a time. 

It wasn't until our bodies had violently collided that I remembered my neighbors position at the top of the staircase. The force of our impact sent both my neighbor and my travel mug airborne. She landed with an audible thump on the floor of the hallway while my mug tilted inwards, drenching my entire upper body in still scalding liquid. She scrambled to her feet, as quickly as an elderly woman can, and began apologizing profusely for blocking my path. 

"I am so sorry. I didn't mean to—"

"God damn it!" I interrupted, shouting loud enough that my words echoed within the hallway, sounding once, twice, three times. "You stupid bitch, look what you did. I just dry cleaned this shirt!" 

Her eyes widened in shock and then, almost immediately, narrowed in a quiet disapproval. She placed her bony hand gently against my cappuccino covered chest and nodded her head. 

"Mhm," she muttered, as though she had confirmed some unspoken prediction. "Rotten on the inside, I see. So it is, so it shall be."

"Agh," I groaned, pushing her skeletal hand away from me. "What the fuck is your problem, lady? Just stay the hell away from me, okay?" 

I rushed past her sullen frame, desperate to put some distance between us, and slammed the door behind me as I entered my apartment to collect the forgotten portfolio that had provoked this entire shit-storm of a situation. Unbuttoning my soaking wet, previously bright white dress shirt, I glanced at my scowling face in the bathroom mirror and felt an almost imperceptible twinge of guilt. Maybe I had been too harsh. It's not a crime for a lonely old woman to seek some companionship, is it? Quickly pushing that feeling to the depths of my conscience, I decided that she did indeed deserve the verbal onslaught she had received for blocking the staircase and hoped she would learn to stand clear of frequently trafficked pathways. 

As I searched through my closet for a clean work appropriate shirt, I noticed an unpleasant gurgling in my intestines. Unfortunately, I was already running late so I chose to ignore the slightly painful sensation and hoped I wouldn’t require a change of pants later that day. Making sure to grab the portfolio before leaving for the second time, I gingerly opened my front door, slowly peering around the corner to ensure that the hallway was empty. Satisfied with my solitude, I hastily made my way through the hallway, down the stairs, and into the front seat of my car where I released a weighty sigh and enjoyed a brief moment of relief before beginning my short drive to work.

I’d been staring at spreadsheets for no more than a hour before the tick-tick-ticking of the clock on the plain white wall of my office had set my nerves on edge. As a matter of fact, everything happening in the office this morning was proving to be especially bothersome. A heavy rain was beating rhythmically against the window in a way that might usually be relaxing but was, today, unusually infuriating. The incessant click-clacking of high heels against the linoleum floor as my coworkers took turns walking back and forth, back and forth, back and forth between their cubicles and the break room beside my office caused my head to ache. 

I gritted my teeth and squeezed a pen in my hand as though the force of my clenched fist would somehow silence the cacophony of ticking and tapping and clicking surrounding me. My temples pulsated rhythmically as the gnawing pain in my head intensified by the minute. I pawed through the top drawer of my desk searching for the two loose headache pills I thought I’d seen rolling around in there a few days ago. In the short time it took me to find the pills, pressure had built in my sinuses and an intense itch had set in my ears. This, along with the nausea in my stomach, was enough to convince me that I may be coming down with the flu.  

“Damn it!” I yelled, slamming my fist on the desk in front of me. This was our busiest season and the worst time of year to be out sick. I had two projects due this week and the sand in the hourglass was streaming to the bottom faster than I could type. Regardless, I couldn’t ignore the stuffiness in my nose and the incessant itching in my ears. Whether it be the flu, a sinus infection, or a migraine didn’t matter. Whatever it was, it was enough to send me home for the day. 

I begrudgingly loaded myself back into my car and cautiously drove home, avoiding potholes and speed bumps, just in case. The drive took twice as long as usual and, by the time I made it into my apartment, I’d begun to feel like death reincarnate. My muscles ached. My head throbbed. I couldn’t breathe through my nose. Nausea permeated my abdomen. And worst of all, my damn ears were itching so bad that I swore I heard buzzing.

Racing into my bathroom, as fast as I could under the circumstances, I grabbed a Q-tip and shoved it forcefully into my ear canal. The relief was immediate but not long lasting. I twisted and turned the Q-tip violently before pulling it out, ear drums be damned. My breath caught in my throat at the site of the once white cotton end that was now coated in thick, black sludge. Raising the cotton swab closer to my eyes, I noticed a small, clear wing sticking out from the surface and realized that the sludge was not earwax but pulverized mosquitos. 

“What the fuck,” I asked out loud to myself as alarm bells cried out in my pulsing head. Before I had so much as a moment to wrap my mind around the bug guts in my skull, I felt a warm, wet substance on my face as my nose began to run. I peered at myself the mirror, eyes wide, and saw inky liquid leaking from my nostrils. The sticky substance soon coated the skin beneath my nose and rested atop my upper lip. 

My blood curdled in my veins as I slowly came to the realization this was more than just a flu. I blew my nose into a wad of toilet paper and then unfolded the mass slightly to look at the contents. Resting inside the soggy tissue was not only an abundance of viscous brown liquid, but also three pink worms that were very much alive. The sight of their wet, squirming bodies caused the bile in my stomach to churn.

“Ack!” I exclaimed, hastily throwing the crumpled paper and its contents into the toilet as though it were burning my hands. My breath quickened in keeping with my pulse and my guts began bubbling like magma in a volcano, about to erupt. Before I had a chance to flush the worms, I found myself on my knees, vomiting forcefully into the waiting water below. As the last drop of puke escaped my lips, I opened my teary eyes and recoiled at the sight of the chunky, black gunk coating the inside of the toilet. 

I considered calling an ambulance but the effort required to wrench myself away from the toilet was more than my body could spare. My forehead dripped sweat as my mind raced for a rational explanation. Food poisoning. Maybe a parasite from that sushi restaurant with the incompetent waiter down the street. The bitter taste of vomit on my tongue was enough to bring about another wave of purging. I choked and gagged as I felt large, solid chunks force their way up my throat and out of my mouth, some of which trickled down my chin and onto my neck. 

Clutching the cold, porcelain seat with my shaking hands, I peered weakly into the black abyss. A hint of pink caught my eye. I grasped the end of a skinny, fleshy mass and pulled it up, expecting another worm, albeit bigger than the last. Instead, I found that I was holding the ass end of a decomposing rat by the tail. What remained of the fur was matted in sticky black fluid. The head and front legs were missing, leaving beige vertebrae hanging loosely where torso should be. 

"Fuck" I shouted, flinging the dead rodent back into the toilet. Dark liquid splashed out of the bowl and onto the seat as the room began to spin around me. My breathing became uneven as panic permeated my senses and my heart was racing so fast I could no longer discern one heartbeat from another.

I desperately fought the urge to vomit again, for fear of feeling the missing parts of the dead rat pass over my tongue. Again my stomach heaved and, despite my firm resolve, spewed another generous mass of putrid muck into the toilet. This time I thought I saw a slimy, pale green frog leg floating in the foul smelling fluid but I couldn’t force myself to examine it further. I looked away from the mess in front of me, but not before a cockroach crawled out of the murky water and down the side of the toilet, disappearing into the linen closet beside the bathtub. Hot tears ran like a river down my cheeks as I curled my trembling body into the fetal position on the cold bathroom tile. 

Maybe I should apologize to my neighbor.
