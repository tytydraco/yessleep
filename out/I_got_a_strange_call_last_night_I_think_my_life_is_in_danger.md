3AM. There I was, laying in bed. Not sleeping, of course - insomnia's a bitch, and there ain't much you can do about it. I've suffered from it, on and off, for my entire adult life. My teenage years as well, now that I think about it. One thing I've learned, laying there with your eyes closed in bed - it's not as restful as actual sleep, and it can be pretty boring, but it'll help a little, with the exhaustion the next day. But trouble sleeping was the least of my concerns, that night.  
  
I got a phone call, which was more than a bit odd - some of my friends are still out at this hour, but I don't usually get calls this late. Or this early, take your pick. The number was unfamiliar, so I refused the call. Probably a misdial, I thought. A few moments later, it rang again - same number. I shook my head - probably one of those so-called friends, maybe they lost their phone, had to borrow another? I had no clue, but resigned, I picked up.  
  
The voice on the other end was unfamiliar... it was a woman's voice, and a particularly gentle one. With a tdistinct ring of urgency, she spoke: "Please, whatever you do, don't hang up. You don't know me, but I promise you, I only want to help." I was confused, but as I opened my mouth, I heard a gentle knock at my bedroom door. Fear immediately took hold - somebody was in my apartment. I started to reach for the revolver in my bedside table, but the woman spoke again. "Don't answer the door. It can't get in, if it's locked." Ignoring her, I grabbed my gun. As I stood up, she spoke again, louder, more urgently: "Don't unlock your door - please! I promise you, everything will be fine, but you absolutely mustn't let it in!" The knock repeated, a bit louder this time, and I found myself hesitating. The woman on the phone breathed a sigh of relief, and my anxiety started to grow. I hadn't said anything, yet, so why was she relieved?  
  
"I know it doesn't make any sense - and I know you don't have any reason to listen to me. But no matter what, I promise you that you will be okay, if you just listen to my instructions." I finally responded to her, and asked "Who are you? What's going on?" Not the most creative line of questioning, but she answered. "I'm a friend. And - you would never believe me, I'm sorry to say. Nobody ever does. But sometimes they listen, and when they do, they make it to the end, they survive - so please, please don't hang up, and whatever you do, don't unlock your door." As she spoke, she seemed on the verge of tears. Again, I opened my mouth to reply - this time, the knock on the door was booming, the sound of a fist slamming against the thin, hollow wood. I stepped back, and lifted my gun, aiming for the door. I was sweating heavily, my heart pounding in my chest - the air felt thick, and I wanted nothing more than to pull the trigger. And then, all at once, it stopped. I wasn't afraid, or even anxious. The woman on the phone, a bit less tense, said "It's gone for now. It will come back, and when it does, you must not open the door." I started to ask another question, but she interrupted me. "You left your front door unlocked. Go and lock it now, please."  
  
I stepped warily towards my bedroom door, and hesitated for a moment before unlocking it. My apartment seemed... untouched. I knew I could not have imagined the slamming on my door, but not a single thing was out of place. My initial hypothesis - that it was some sort of psychotic burglar - started to feel less plausible. "The front door." the woman reminded me - I put my gun down on the coffee table in the middle of the living room, still holding the phone in my left hand, and moved towards the door. As I reached for it, I suddenly heard footsteps - fast, loud, rushing and getting closer. The woman, for the first time, shouted "LOCK IT! HURRY! EVEN ONE WILL DO!" I heard a hand grab the handle on the other side of the door, just as I slid the bolt in place. Outside, something snarled... and knocked, gently, on my front door. I turned the lock in the handle as well, and took a step back. "You did it... you're fine... it can't get in now. Please, don't leave your apartment until morning."  
  
The woman hung up almost immediately after, and I was left, alone, to think about what I'd heard. I returned to my room, collecting my revolver - I decided to leave it on my nightstand, rather than to put it back in the drawer, and incredibly, I fell asleep soon after. When I woke up, it was 11 AM - my day off, fortunately - and I started to wonder if the "events" of the previous night were just a dream. But my revolver still sat on the bedside table. I went to make myself a cup of coffee, and nearly jumped a foot in the air when I heard a rapping on my front door. "Open up, police business" a gruff voice called, and I relaxed, a little bit. I went over and, swallowing nervously, unlocked and opened my front door. Two officers were standing in the doorway, and at least 6 more were out in the hall, questioning other neighbors. "What's going on here - did something happen?" I asked, and the gruff officer replied: "Last night, there was a murder on your floor. We want to ask you a few questions."  
  
The questions were pretty standard, and I didn't want to make a suspect of myself, so I obliges. After the police left, I immediately locked my door again. I was, to say the least, terrified. I still am. I don't know what that was, last night, but I know that if I hadn't listened to the woman on the phone, I would most likely be dead right now. It's nearly midnight, my front door is locked and bolted. Tomorrow, I might go out and buy a big-ass padlock, just to be sure. Because as I'm typing this, somebody is knocking on my front door. And I don't want to take any chances.  
  
Anybody know what's going on?
