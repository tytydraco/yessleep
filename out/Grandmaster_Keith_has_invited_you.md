I stared at the text message in disbelief.

*The  apartment complex sent me this? What the fuck. This has to be a joke.*

I glanced at the copy of the notice to terminate my lease  I had given  to  my  apartment complex just  last month.

I checked the number,  it was  the local area code and  an iPhone, so I didn’t think it was a burner.

I wanted answers desperately, but the complex didn't have a walk-in office—  you had to make appointments for an employee to come out.  I figured I'd call the next thing in the morning.

After turning off my phone, I closed my eyes, trying to shake off that uneasy feeling the text had given me and go to sleep. 

 Some time later, I  jolted awake to  the jarring sound of banging at my front door. It was still dark outside.   Terrified, I sprung up and rushed to the door. I put my eye to the peep hole, but it was covered.

The banging got increasingly more aggressive.

In a panic, I dragged the dining room table to  the front door. Hands shaking, I pulled my phone out of my pocket and dialed 911. 

The banging continued, I was starting to think it would never end.   My phone wouldn't start ringing, intensifying my worry.  I looked up  at the  corner of my  screen and noticed  it read "SOS only".

*not even 911 is working.. What the hell is going on?*

The incessant banging was suddenly replaced with the horrific sound of someone actively trying to break down my door.

i flinched at each new sound of impact. Suddenly, an idea struck me--  I decided to open the camera app and record the situation for evidence. 

Finally, a  large hole was made in the door, making me yelp a little. It   revealed a man  with a large frame wearing a ski mask and reflective sunglasses. 

he brought his hands up, revealing a  glowing   iridescent colored  pickaxe. I was confused, scared, and in awe of the color all at the same time.

He held it still for a moment, as if to taunt me, before  violently slamming it on the ground next to him. I recoiled from the impact. He then  pulled out a small  electronic box of sorts. He held it to his mouth.



"We hope to see you there." the man  stated calmly in an electronically distorted voice.  I stared at him, still recording everything. I was at a complete loss for words. Not soon after, he pocketed the device, grabbed the pickaxe, and calmly walked  out of view. 

  
I considered peeking through the door, but was paralyzed. 

Finally, I ended the video and watched it save to my camera roll. Weirdly enough, my service had now returned. I dialed 911 and explained the situation. 



After what felt like an eternity of zoning out, trying to process what had just happened, I jumped after being startled by the voice of a police officer behind me.

I turned around to see two  officers, one  shining his flashlight through the hole in the door.

"Do you mind if we come in, sir?"  an officer asked.

"No, of course not, come in," I replied nervously.



I spent the next 5 minutes tripping over my words.  I was trying my best to explain what had happened while simultaneously putting in an  effort to not come across as unhinged. 

"Oh, yeah, I even recorded the whole thing!" I told the officer  giddily before pulling out my phone.

Hands still shaking, I navigated to the photos app, only to see the video wasn’t there. 

Dread consumed me. 

“No, no no, this can't be happening” I muttered under my breath, panicked. 

I made my way over to recently deleted. Still nothing. 

"FUCK!" I screamed, having lost my temper. 

“Sir, please calm down.” the officer instantly replied.

“Sorry, j-just give me one second” I stammered.

I froze, staring at my phone screen, thinking of what– no *anything* to do,  before finally  accepting defeat.

“I-  I don't have it anymore” I let out softly.

 The officers   shot each other a glaring look of suspicion  before  letting  out a sigh.



“Sir, it’s fine, we’ll contact the apartment complex right when they open and request the security camera records for this hallway.”

“Okay, thanks, but what am I supposed to do in the meantime?” 

“Well,” the officer started

“Oh, Wait!” I interrupted before pulling out my phone again. I quickly navigated my way to the text message from earlier. 

“Look, i got this really freaky text message just last night” i said before handing my phone to the officer.



They both read it, and became visibly disturbed.

One of the officers snapped a photo of it and gave me my phone back.



“We’ll make sure to investigate this thoroughly and  contact you as soon as possible. Anyways, as I was saying, in the meantime, we’ll have an officer keeping watch in the area.”



The officers went on their way, and I was left there alone,  scared and confused.

After noticing the sun had risen, I checked the time and noticed I was late for my shift at 7-Eleven. I called my work while quickly getting ready, bringing some pepper spray with me  just in case. 

 On my way to work, I was  somewhat soothed by the crisp morning air and the scene of palm trees soaked in golden light, complimenting the hum of cars as I walked over the 405 freeway. 

Upon walking into work, I was taken aback to see the same 2 officers from earlier, waiting in line.  They  gave me a strange look of disapproval  before just as quickly looking away. . 

For the rest of my shift, I felt like  a robot. My body was checking out customers at the register, but my mind was still stuck replaying last night like a broken record, thinking about how the police had acted towards me.   Every few minutes, I checked my phone compulsively  to see if the police had contacted me yet. They never did 

  As I stopped to wait at a crosswalk on my way back, I felt my phone buzz for the first time since last night. I  froze from  anticipation before finally pulling my phone out of my pocket. It was a text message. 

“yo wyd tonight” a message from my good friend read. I let out a sigh  and relaxed a little before  jumping when a car suddenly honked at me, gesturing to the walk sign that had been on for who knows how long. I mouthed out the word “sorry” and crossed. 

“nothing, just got off work. hbu”  i replied to my friend. The idea of having some company after everything that happened seemed nice. 

“me and jason are hitting up in n out if  u wanna come, i  gotchu on the food.”

I didnt really wanna go back to my place just yet, so i figured why the hell not. 

“alr  im omw” I replied.

I turned around and started in the direction of the restaurant, feeling a bit relieved for the upcoming distraction, but also knowing I had no appetite from the stress. 

Soon after, I heard the sound of a screech and turned around to see a black  van with all the  windows tinted,  coming to a stop behind me.  I scanned my surroundings in a panic, I was on a quiet residential street, and no one was around in case  anything happened to me. 

I  caught sight of a narrow   pathway that ran  between 2 houses and began hurriedly walking towards it. Upon  turning back around,   I saw the minivan had come to a full stop in the middle of the road.   I hurried more and had almost made it to the other end  before I heard  the minivan driving away. 

I paused for a short while,  catching my breath and thinking I was finally safe, before seeing the minivan come to a stop at the other end. 

*They tried to cut me off.* 

I reached into my pocket to grab my pepper spray   before  running  back to the other end.  

*I need to think fast.* 

I scanned my surroundings once more, catching sight of  an alleyway close by.   I  ran towards it, adrenaline flowing through me.  Finally,   I  came to a  dead end after reaching a fence that   blocked off the parking lot to the local mall.   After hearing brakes screech, I turned to see  the van  turning onto the alleyway, heading straight towards me. It was driving fast. 

 Fear overwhelmed me, and  I hesitated briefly before jumping over the fence, figuring it was my only option. 

I  let out a sigh of relief and slowed down,  knowing   I had bought some time.   The mall had been long dead, the only thing remaining being a single Target. I looked around, it was getting dark, and I was  in an empty  lot in front of abandoned stores. 

I thought about calling the police, but I had zero evidence of anything that had just happened. I figured I'd let them know when they contacted me. 

My phone rang, interrupting my train of thought.  It was my friend calling.

“Hey man, sorry, im on my way right now, ill be a bit late though- like  20-30 minutes, i got caught up in some bullshit.”



“The fuck are you talking about?” my friend responded, concerned. 

“Uh, this black minivan was chasing me, and other weird shits been going on too. I dont know, ill tell you more when I get there." I replied. 



“When you get where? the fuck are you on about man?” he replied with a  chuckle.



“Uhh…” I stammered.

“When I  meet you  at In-N-Out?” I added.



“Who the fuck said we were meeting at In-N-Out?” he replied, confused. 



“Uhh-” I froze.

“W-what are you talking about–  you just asked me to-    you said you and Jason were going.” I stammered

“Dude, are you high?” he joked.

“You just fucking messaged me!” I raised my voice, frustrated

He said something else, but I was too distracted as I navigated my way to our messages.  I was horribly surprised to  find that none of the messages  from earlier were there. 

“Hello? Are you there?” he asked.

“Y-yeah, uhh, never mind about that,  so, why'd you call me then?” I asked.

“You messaged me on insta and told me to call you” he replied.

“W-what? No i didn't– are you just fucking with me or something?” I asked, before opening Instagram. 

 He wasn't lying, there was a message from me,  that I had zero recollection of sending, telling him to call me. 

My friend had said something else , but I hadn't paid attention to what he said. I hung up the call, knowing I needed to focus,  and checked to see if any new devices had logged into my account. There were none shown, leaving me even more concerned.

I scanned my surroundings, suddenly feeling something indescribably sinister in the air. 

 Only seconds later, I felt my phone start  buzzing. I was getting another call.

“No caller ID” 

The hum of an engine in the distance diverted my attention. It was  the minivan, coming to a stop. Its headlights switched on, bringing on a cinematic feeling as a  chilly wind gust hit my face and a pit grew in my stomach.

I looked down, phone still ringing.

*Should I just  answer it ?* 

The  idea pierced my mind compellingly. 

The call expired before I could make up my mind. I looked up, locking eyes with the minivan.   It was still right there, engine humming, headlights blaring. 

The phone started ringing again. Without hesitation,  I  swiped to answer and held the phone up to my ear. I  was insistent on  not saying the first word.

The call was silent. Seconds felt like hours as I nervously waited for someone on the other end  to say something– anything.

*I can’t wait any longer*

“What the hell  do you want from me?” I asked, frustrated.

“Oh! He speaks!” a familiar distorted voice replied.

“Just answer my question.” I replied, frustrated at  his sly remark.

“Oh, this isn't about what we *want*, no not at all” he replied in a  manic tone.

“No, you see,  Lewis, this is about what we *need.*” he explained further, his voice shifting to urgency at the end of his sentence.

The way he spoke and addressed me by name left me deeply unsettled. 

“Lewis, you might wanna delete  that post.” he said, breaking the silence.

The pit in my stomach intensified. 

“W-what post?” I replied, already having a  sense of where this was going.

“Take care now.” he replied before abruptly hanging up the call. Just as quickly, the minivan left my view. 

 Shaking, I quickly flipped through my socials,  looking for anything out of the ordinary. After finding nothing, I felt defeated.  after checking Instagram once more and  holding down  my icon, something I hadn't done earlier,  I noticed I was now logged in to a second account, one I didn't recognize. 

The username was “@666\_thrillzzz”  , the  profile picture being a  man wearing a ski mask and sunglasses, the same ones the man had been wearing just last night. 

There was one post,  from 2am today, only an hour or two before last night's incident. It was an uncropped version of the profile picture, revealing the man holding up a glowing  iridescent pickaxe to the camera. 

 I began to feel nauseous and hyperventilate.

 *How the fuck am i logged into this now? Have I been this whole time?*

The post had no interactions. No likes, comments, nothing. Additionally, the account wasn’t following anybody and had no followers. 

I wanted to call the police, but I knew I was in some deep trouble  from simply being logged into the account.

Upon arriving home, flashbacks pierced my mind as I saw the destroyed door. 

After  examining the hallway,  I noticed the security camera had been completely destroyed. He must have broken it before breaking in my door.

 I threw some leftovers in the microwave. After eating, I headed to bed and  closed my eyes, taking me a while to fall asleep from all of the stress. Not soon after I'd finally drifted into sleep, I was startled by 3 loud knocks on my door.  My stomach churned.

*Really? Again?*  I thought, assuming it was the same man from the night before and getting a sick sense of Deja Vu.

“Westminster police department, Search Warrant!” I heard a voice shout.

*A search warrant? What the fuck?*

“Open the door slowly and put your hands up!” The same voice ordered sternly.

Shaking and hyperventilating , I got up and opened my bedroom door before instantly raising my hands. 

“Put your hands behind your head *slowly* and interlace your fingers.”  The officer instructed.

“You’re under arrest for  criminal mischief.” he continued after my compliance. 

Everything slowed down. I went into a numb state of shock.

My hands were brought down and handcuffed as the officer read me my rights. I chose to remain silent. 

Looking around, officers in tactical gear were searching my place, or more accurately, destroying the place. 

The rest was a blur. I was brought down to the station and placed in a holding cell after having a mugshot taken and my belongings taken care of. I couldn’t begin to  believe that  this was truly happening to me– that somehow, someway, this was my reality. 

I was placed in a holding cell  and  met with a public defense attorney soon after.

“Hey, how's it going? My name’s Chad , I'll be representing you.” the defense attorney  stated cheerfully, his positive attitude annoying me. He was a tall, thin, and crudely charismatic man.

“I didn't do it.” I replied.

“Look, you're getting way ahead of yourself. That's a discussion for another time. Right now, I'm just gonna review the charges and evidence with you.” he said while flipping through papers. 

I sighed. 

“Okay, looks like you're charged with Criminal Mischief with an enhancement for use of a  deadly weapon, disturbing the peace,  and false report to law enforcement.”

“This is absurd.” I exclaimed. 

I tried to explain my side of the story, but he cut me off and reiterated that I was getting ahead of myself. 

“So, it looks like they got probable cause to search your apartment and arrest you due to them tracing back  an Instagram account that led to your IP address.” he stated robotically. 

 "This account was brought to their attention following a mostly anonymous tip. The post  was depicting a masked man with sunglasses holding up a colorful pickaxe to the camera, which is  how you, the caller, described the perpetrator.” he continued

I went numb.

“They  made a note, stating the tipper was strangely  insistent on making it known that they were a good  friend of someone named Keith,  but refused to elaborate on who that was.”

 *He  fucking framed me..*

“Due to the name Keith being connected to this case, they found the tip suspicious and  attempted to trace it, but were unsuccessful.” 

Chad went on to explain the court process and possible sentencing outcomes, but my brain, overwhelmed with the reality of the situation, tuned it out. 

“Did you get all that?” he asked, reviving my attention.

“Y-yeah, I did.” I replied after hesitating. 

“Hey, when will I get my phone back?” I  added.

“If you're released during arraignment, you probably won't get it back until the trial's over. But sometimes they just copy the relevant data and return the device. It’s rare, but it happens.” He explained.

I was taken back to my cell, and I waited over 48 hours until my court hearing, thinking obsessively about the events from the last few days. I began to wonder if they somehow had remote access to my phone, figuring it’d certainly explain all of the bizarre messages, and even the post. 

Additionally, I wondered why in the world they would want me locked up if they wanted me to attend the event. 

 The court  process was cold and robotic. I stood before a judge and  my charges were read to me, my bail was posted,  and I returned to custody  with a court date scheduled for April the  10th.  

Not soon after, I was informed my bail was posted and that I was being released pending sentencing.

I wondered who had paid it so quickly, questioning  if it was the man. 

luckily, they ended up  returning  my phone to me–  I figured they would as I had nothing else incriminating on there.

I powered on my phone and  stared at the apple logo in suspense. When it finally came to life, I had quite a few unread messages, but one of them stood out to me the most. 

“**GRANDMASTER KEITH NERVOUSLY AWAITS YOUR REPLY**

Our **GRANDMASTER KEITH**  has expressed **DEEP CONCERN** over the possibility of you choosing to not attend our **SACRED GRAND FINALE, ON MARCH 7th 2025.**

We will **LEAVE YOU ALONE** for the meantime if and when you do RSVP.

However, it is ultimately your choice. 

We hope to see you there. “



I stared at the message for what felt like an eternity, thinking of what to do. The words “Leave me alone” looped in my mind, enticing me.

Suddenly, without even thinking, I typed in “RSVP” and hit send

I gasped from the realization of what I had just done. Just as quickly as I hit send, I was met with a response.

This is all I have time to write right now, but this is only the very  beginning of everything else that unfolded. I’ll post the rest as soon as I can.
