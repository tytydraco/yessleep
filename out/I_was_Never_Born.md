Like many of you, I read the [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ynqts/csection_kids_were_never_born/) posted yesterday about c-section babies not being born and how their bodies believe they're still in the womb. I don't know what happened to the main character, but I do know the notion isn't that far-fetched.

I'm a c-section baby. I'm also completely paralyzed. A drunk driver hit me while I was crossing the road. (Don't drink and drive, people.) I live in the hospital now, only able to move my eyes, and my mother is my connection to the world.

I'd never felt that connection when I was healthy. My own senses dominated. But now my days are stale. I can't eat. I can't move. I can't feel. At night, the only sounds come from the machinery around me.

It was at night when I first noticed.

The night I broke and cried, hating my life.

I remember the tears stinging my eyes. I remember my stuttering breaths wheezing through the tube in my throat. I remember freezing when I heard a muffled voice.

Then I heard a less muffled one. Deeper than usual, but the cadence and tone were unmistakable. It was my mother.

I opened my eyes, confused. There was no one in the room. The glowing clock on the wall said it was 9:30. My mother should be home, putting my little sister to bed. I closed my eyes again.

I could hear her singing a lullaby.

She sounded like she was all around me. Hugging me with her voice. I thought I was imagining it. Or that I'd lost my mind from frustration. The next day, I told her what happened, and she confirmed that she was indeed singing to my sister at that time.

We were stunned, yet curious. Over the next few days, we tested this new phenomenon. With both of us actively focusing on our connection, I began hearing my mother's conversations all the time. The other's voices weren't as clear, but hers I quickly learned to understand.

I also began tasting what she ate. The flavors were fainter than if I was the one eating, but it was a joyous surprise. After this discovery, my mother went out of her way to eat my favorite foods.

She also stopped smoking and began working out, both of us hoping this would reflect on my health as well. I can say with confidence I feel better, but I don't know if it's due to this, or due to finally having an outlet.

The connection soon spread to emotions. I could sense what she was feeling, and to our delight, she could sense my emotions too. She had to focus more than I did, since her life was hectic compared to mine, but whenever she felt I was down and she wasn't nearby, she'd sing to me.   

We didn't tell anyone. It was our secret. We even learned Morse code so she could talk to me in public without anyone knowing. She'd wear a hollow ring and tap it with her nail, and the sound resonated clearly.

My resentment at having my life unfairly downgraded mellowed now that my mother was my window to the world. She rescued me.

And one day, it was my turn to rescue her.

It was my birthday, and she'd gone to the supermarket after work to pick up cupcakes. I was salivating, trying to will her to eat one right then and there. Either she sensed my impatience or just knew me that well, because a few seconds later I was in saccharine heaven.

After paying, my mother said she was going to head over to the neighbor's to pick up my sister so they could visit me to celebrate. I could hear the trunk slam and the engine rumble, and my pulse raced when I heard a loud crack, my mother's shock becoming mine.

Her anger and exasperation took over. She said a van had backed into her car in the parking lot. I could hear her talking about damages and insurance with a man, and my eyes flew open in fear when she screamed.

Our terror merged, and my thoughts ran wild as I tried to figure out what was happening. She was no longer talking to me, despite my overwhelming worry, and my panic surged. I couldn't sense her emotions anymore.

My machines beeped as my heart ran amok and my breaths wheezed, and a nurse ran into my room. I pleaded with my eyes, begging for my communication board, and I watched in helpless horror as he injected me with a sedative.

I woke up three hours later, and reality flooded me like ice water. My fury radiated at the nurse. If my mother ended up dead, I was putting the full blame on him.

Relief eclipsed my rage when I heard my mother. She was mumbling. I couldn't understand her. Was she gagged? My fears restarted as I tried to focus. Her life depended on me.

She was repeating the same pattern with her grunts. Morse code. Letters and numbers. A license plate. 

Then she screamed again.

My pulse ran wild, and so did the machines. Two nurses ran in, and I looked at them with despair, tears trickling down my face. The same man was ready to sedate me again, but the new nurse stopped him. She dried my tears, and my hope rose when she brought over the communication board.

It was a chart my mother had made for me, the alphabet divided into five groups, the numbers into two. I blinked when the nurse pointed to the right group, and I blinked again when she pointed to the right letter or number. It took a while, but I managed to explain the situation. 

They stared at me, and my frustration roared. I looked at the board again, ready to explain how I knew so they could stop staring and call the police. Instead of holding it up, though, they left, and my machines' cacophony restarted as I screamed in my head.

A lullaby hugged me.

My mother. Caring for me despite the hell she was going through. Still communicating in Morse code, she told me she was proud of me. I could tell she was getting tired, her grunts becoming hoarse. She was scared, worried, angry. I wished I could sing to her. Instead, I let my love for her take over, hoping it would soothe her. 

A doctor walked in, followed by the two nurses. He held up the board and asked me how I knew my mother was reported missing. I was relieved someone had reported it while I was unconscious, but I didn't know how to explain my knowledge. Afraid of wasting time, I told him I dreamt it and pleaded with them to hurry and save her.

They were baffled, but to my tearful relief, they called the police with my information. While some cops followed the lead, others questioned me. With my mother and sister being my only visitors, they asked if this was a scam we'd hatched to make me a famous clairvoyant and get me much needed funds.

Everyone was finally treating me like a human again instead of a vegetable, but I didn't appreciate the unfounded accusations. Afraid of being misunderstood, I closed my eyes, refusing to communicate. My frantic pulse woke the machines around me, and the doctor demanded the interrogation be stopped.

With no more distractions, I focused on my mother. I couldn't hear her. I couldn't sense her either. Was she asleep? Or had something terrible happened to her?

I opened my eyes, and the kind nurse rushed over to dry my tears and hold up the communication board. I asked her to please keep in touch with the police and let me know the latest news. She promised.

An hour later, she cheered as she told me they'd arrested the man and found my mother and two other women in his basement, drugged but alive. I cried tears of joy.

It didn't take long for everyone to see that we had nothing to do with this inhumanity. They made space for my mother's bed in my room, and she recovered by my side, both of us grateful for the other.

We were freed of suspicion, but not of curiosity. They even got me an electronic board that monitors my eye movements so I could type my replies. I found all the attention exhausting. Thankfully, my mother took care of answering all the questions, sparing me any discomfort. We never told the truth.

Until today. I don't know if every c-section baby is able to nurture this innate connection, or if it's just something unique between my mother and me, but after reading that story yesterday, we agreed to finally share our experience. As for what will happen after my mother passes, we don't know, so we've decided to remain optimistic.
