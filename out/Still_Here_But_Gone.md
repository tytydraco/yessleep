There's always a singular, overly popular perspective most people had in life: 


***Life is Cruel.***


For me, I never believed nowadays in such a pretentious ideology. I've always believed that good could condemn the bad, even if the bad suffocated you, fiercely grappled you as tight as it could even if you tried to wriggle out of its grasp-- to me, there was *always* a good. Even when you start to lose everything-- when the pain squeezes your heart so tightly you can feel the life draining out of you-- when the fabric of your mind starts to break off, falling down into tiny, withered pieces, taking away a part of yourself with each piece-- ***Good*** *always finds it's way to you.* 


Years ago, I never believed in such a proposterous idea. I'd see people with wide, beaming smiles strung across their lips. People whose eyes twinkled with captivating, fragile light, glimmering with something that pulled you in. Made you desire what it was. People who were overly positive, and for what? They are all just a bunch of fakes, at least I always thought so. They were so positive, so happy, it was always immensely infuriating to see. It would make every fibre of my heart start to scorch, sizzling intensely with massive, amber flames that boiled throughout my entire body, burned me to the point white, hot pangs of pain became nothing but a dampened coldness. My heart used to scorch with the monsterous, amber flames of *jealousy.* 


That was until only three years ago. I was eighteen at that point and life was going-- well-- every wall I had built up around me was crashing down, leaving me to just sit and watch. I moved out of my parents house and moved into my own, and very first apartment, and everything seemed to be a new beginning. That's when the saying of "*don't jinx it*" comes to bite me straight in the ass. I lost the job I had, I wasn't making any income, and I had nobody to ask for any form of financial support. 


I was struggling, and even if I could, I never had the heart to ask *anybody* for money. Too bad I never had any friends at that point. Until, everything seemingly changed overnight. I got into the creative writing course I've practically begged the universe to get into for years, and then-- *I met* ***him.***


His name was Ali, and when we first met eachother we immediately clicked, bonding over our shared interest of writing. We started to hang out *almost* everyday. We went everywhere and anywhere, and every moment that passed only seemed like a second. We laughed together. Smiled together. We were *happy* together. 


Months passed since the time we first met, to be exact-- 22/06/2017-- we had started to date eachother, becoming partners. Since then, we had stayed together. And every moment had been amazing. Every moment, I know that i'd *never* trade away. Give up. 


*Even if it cost me my life.* 


And now, I found myself here, Inside my apartment, my home. But, the presence of my partner with me is what made it *home*. 


The sky above is a deepening azure, sprinkled with gentle streaks of rose mixed with copper, painting the horizon into calm, beautiful atmosphere. Millions of vast white, tranquil clouds obscured the sky. The sun, a golden orb with an ethereal, blinding amber glow peeked through the tiny gaps of the clouds, illuminating the streets below, however it only cast a dampened light out into the darkened, silent street.


 I fixate my gaze on the sky above, watching the way the blue, pink and orange that tainted the sky slowly faded into deeper, darker colours as the day started to fade away. In times like this, where the lively, chaotic hum of the world grew still, quiet, I find myself in immediate peace. All I did was stand on my balcony, lifeless. Just staring up at the sky with admiration for the horizon. 


"Hey. Whatcha doing?" 


A sudden voice burst abruptly through the silence of the world. I immediately tensed, flinching at the sudden voice. As I look over my shoulder at the voice, I can feel my body relax at the sight. 


Messy, maroon hair laid on mans head, stubborn strands pouring down his forehead, sticking out in multiple fussy, unkept positions. Silver glasses placed themselves firmly on the bridge of his straight nose, brown eyes focused on mines, a small smile on his slight tanned, porcelain skin. 


"Next time you sneak up on me, expect to be paying my medical bills." I started to joke, the chuckle that wanted to leave my lips evident in my voice. "Just being boring, nothing know." I said, absentmindedly waving a hand up at the sky. 



Ali's smile softened on his face, and I could feel my own contempt, small smile tracing my lips. I could feel the way my heart leapt inside my chest, beating heavily before simmering down-- melting-- into a gentle, light feeling. *Love.*


"Beautiful, isn't it?" Ali whispered out breathlessly, walking up to stand beside me. 


I let out a hearty laugh, averting my eyes to look up at the sky. "Yeah. You know, for a world so difficult to navigate through, it has it's beauty." I whispered out, a small chuckle accompanying my laugh. 


I could feel my partner's eyes on me, burning into me. However, the heat of his gaze only felt like a small prickle against my skin, an icy pierce that never truly left. 


"It has it's perks. I'm only here for the company though." Ali softly spoke out, earning a chuckle to escape my lips. 


"How thoughtful. You know," I started, the smile softening on my face as I close my eyes shut. "I could spend forever like this. You and me, just us. Talking. Living. Just being together." 


Even though Ali let out a loud laugh, something seemed to shift in the air. The world was quiet, a peacefulness, but I could feel something lingering there. Something... Hidden, unbeknownst to me. It was almost like there was something being left *unsaid.*


"Me too. It's moments that seem pointless, like these, that are always the *best* ones." Ali whispered softly, his tone filled with affection however something strained his tone slightly when he finished his sentence. 


I would've said something immediately, although I could feel my heart start to squeeze. The air shifted, and the overflowing tranquility finally seemed to extinguish. A cold started to seep in, getting the hair on my arms to raise. It felt like an icy blanket wrapped around me tightly, condeming me into a bubble of freezing, piercing cold that sent a shiver up my spine. 


My whole body felt... Cold. It was strange, there wasn't any wind tonight, not even the gentlest of breeze. There was just something... *There.* This sensation, this gnawing pressure bubbling inside my abdomen, tender but it got the insides of my stomach started to tie into tangles of tightened knots. 


"Yeah. I can't imagine a life without you in it, you know? It wouldn't be a life worth living." I spoke out after a few moments of silence between us, and I could hear the slight sadness in my voice. 


It happened again. The air seemed to become thicker with that feeling, growing deeper. Almost like *sorrow*, just like what I could hear in my own voice. Why is it so cold? Normally moments spent with Ali like this warmed me up. And now-- *it* ***didn't.***


An enormous, thick lump formed inside my throat. I tried to swallow it down, but the saliva inside my throat seemed to run dry, leaving an intolerable rawness inside my throat. I tried to push down the emotions threatening to spill over me, instead I glanced over at my partner. 


"I can't imagine that either. We're partners, we'll always go through everything together." Ali whispered almost inaudibly, his voice sounding as though it was bound to break. 


I watched as he just... Stared... Into the horizon. I couldn't see the light that was always inside his eyes, but I could see the way the tanned skin on his nose slightly wrinkled. It *always* did whenever he was telling the truth. 


"Yeah. I don't think I could *ever* lose you." I replied after a moment of silence, my voice increasingly warm, cozy. 


This time, the air thickened intensely. My breath caught inside my throat as the cold air poured through, straight down into my lungs. That lump formed back inside my throat, my heart painfully clenching and I could feel the way my insides squirmed and quickly wrapped into untangleable knots. I watched as my partners face seemed still, the soft smile *frozen* on his face, and I could vaguely feel the way my smile slightly faltered. 


"You *will.* I can't live forever." Ali spoke very clearly and I can feel my heart dropping at the words, and at the voice. 


There was no emotion inside my partners voice. It was... *Blank.* I could feel the emotions starting to bubble up overwhelmingly inside of me, but I could only stare at my partner, an intense stare that helped ground me. Here. With *him.* 


"I know. And when you do, I'll join you." I started to speak, my voice cracking slightly as it wavered with something desperate. "You said it a moment ago, didn't you?" 


I paused for a moment, taking a deep breath. I tried to smile, however I couldn't push my lips back up from the frown curling on my face. 


"That we're partners, that we will go through everything together. ***Always.***" With that sentence, something darkened Ali's face. 


"Listen. Promise me something, will you?" As Ali started to speak again, that same *emptiness* littered his voice. 


I slightly gagged on the lump in my throat at the words, the voice. The words I wanted to say clung inside my throat, all I could do was slowly nod, unable to look away from the man beside me. 


"Keep me in your heart. And, when you feel me there, look up. I'm *there*"


Everything seemed to fade into background noise for me in that moment. I couldn't feel my hammering heart inside my chest, the heavy breath escaping my lips with strangled sounds. I could only stare, at *my* partner. 


A desperation flooded fruitlessly inside me, and before I could even think out any of my actions, I leaped in without control. 


"Al, I don't need too, can't you see?" As I spoke I reached out a hand to place on one of his. "Your *still* ***here***. You *aren't* ***gone.***" 


Cold. All I could feel was the cold. The soft, smooth skin I could feel underneath mines didn't have an ounce of warmth, my partner's skin felt stone cold. I could feel my heart aggressively skip a beat, pounding inside my ears. 


No, that wasn't normal. It wasn't cold out here, his body had no reason to be... *Freezing.* 


Silence.


Moments ticked by underwhelmingly slow and not once did Ali turn his head to face me. Not once did he look at me. And as I looked closer at my partner, the horror crashed like massive, frothy waves colliding against endless grains of sand, sinking into my veins just like the ocean waves dampened the granules of sand. 


Those brown eyes didn't shine with light, they were vacant. No longer a bright brown, it was darkened, glazed over to the brim. They looked lifeless, staring into the fading horizon unblinkingly. His tanned skin was paper white, not shining... It looked almost dead. 


My eyes widened in horror, a heavy weight pressing restlessly against me. My breathing grew into loud labouring breaths, and the shock that pressed against me felt as though it pushed me roughly, and I stumbled back away from my partner. Just staring, wide eyed with horror, lips parted slightly. 


The more I stared at him, the more something started to form inside my head. The more streaks of black started to flicker before me, blurring my vision. Something formed inside my head, like a white cloud of fog, and it started to twirl into images... Images that seemed so *familiar* but foreign at the same time.

"Hey-- hang in there, Al!" My voice broke as I yelled desperately, panic seated into my voice and my body. 


Ali laid underneath me as I kneeled beside him, his eyes clenched shut. Something crimson stained his clothes in great clumps, splattered everywhere, even staining the ends of his cheeks. A gaping wound punctured his stomach, oozing sticky, sickening blood quickly. 


Stinging pricked my eyes but I blinked them away violently, focusing on using both of my palms to push a piece of cloth against the stab wound, pressing my entire weight down to keep the pressure on the wound. 


Emotions wracked me, fruitlessly, frantically, endlessly, but I kept going. The slow rise and fall of Ali's chest and the slightly heavy breathing he exhaled told me one thing-- I had *time* to save him. 


"Cindy..." My partner started to whisper weakly, breath heavy, almost like a burden inside his throat. 


Panic swelled up inside me more as my partner spoke but I shook it off, swallowing the lump forming inside my throat. Words stuck inside my throat, but I never thought to interrupt the man below me. All I could do was keep *trying* to stop the blood leaking rapidly out of his wound. 


"Promise... Me--" He cut himself off, voice breaking down however he kept going. "--something... That you... Won't... Forget... About--" 


...


..


***Me.***


...


..


Tears swelled up inside my eyes at those words, scorching hot before they cascaded gently down my cheeks, burning into my cheeks that started to grow numb. *Everything* went numb. The slow rise and fall of Ali's chest started to slow. The small warmth inside his body started to disappear... *He* was starting to disappear. At the sight, something seemed to break inside of me. *I* broke inside. The part of me Ali inhabited was fading, and *I* started to follow him. 

...



..


"*I* ***promise.***" 


...

-------------------------




As the white fog that swirled with the images of a memory faded away from my mind, I could feel nothing as I stared at my partner before me. My *dead* partner. I finally seem to understand what was going on....



*I know that I* ***kept*** *my* ***promise.***



I knew something that I always should've known. That wherever Ali was, I go. ***Home.*** *I'll always go to my home.* ***He*** *would always be* ***my home.***




"*You never noticed, did you?*" 







*No, how could I?*





...




..





***I couldn't let myself forget about you.***
