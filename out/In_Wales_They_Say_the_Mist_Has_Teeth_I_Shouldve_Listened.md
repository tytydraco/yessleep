I passed a playground on the outskirts of town. The swings creaked emptily, while children chanted softly beneath an old Yew tree…

Tý yn y Niwl,, teeth in the gray,
Lost little lambs who listen, lose their way.
She eats your regrets, drinks up your cries,
Keep your feet moving, don’t look in her eyes.

The rhyme faltered as my sedan rolled past. One girl stopped skipping. She stood unnervingly still, watching my car. The others kept playing, but she stared through the windshield, her eyes too old for her face.

When I parked near the inn, I glanced at my reflection in the side mirror. The girl stood at the playground’s edge now, just beyond the mist. Close enough to see. Close enough to hear.

My gaze dropped to the windshield. The glass was streaked with a milky residue, thin as a spider’s dragline. I pressed a finger to it, tacky, like tree sap. Then the smell hit me: wet wool and… something sour. Damp. Like breath trapped in a coffin.

My stomach twisted. I should’ve driven away. I should’ve ignored it. But instead, my fingers found the window controls, and I rolled it down an inch.

The girl smiled, gap-toothed.
“Mam says the mist… it’s the breath of the Annwyl, they call it. The old ones said it comes from the land itself when it’s grieving. Hungry. That’s why you shouldn’t talk to it. Or breathe too loud. It listens for the lost breath.
It eats the future of those who live in the past. It can’t bite unless you bite first.”

She plucked a dandelion and blew its seeds into the mist. “Mam says the Annwyl used to be a mother. Lost her babe to the plague. Now she adopts.” Her grin turned feral. “But she’s a shit mum. Forgets to feed you. Forgets to let go. She feasts on breath. The first thing we take when we’re born, the last thing we give when we die.”

A gust of wind swept through the lot, kicking up dead leaves. I shivered.

The girl rocked on her heels.
“Too late for you, though.” Her grin widened. “It’s already licked your windows.”

She tilted her head, considering me like a bug in a jar. Then she whispered, soft, almost reverent:
“It must like the way you taste.”

I changed parking spots.

My mind raced. “Teeth in the gray” a metaphor for predation? In Welsh lore, mist was sometimes called Ilid y ddaear, the earth’s rage. A living thing that consumed those who fed it regret. But metaphors didn’t lick windshields. Or taste like rot. I snapped a photo, grainy, useless. But the act grounded me. Proof. A tether to my sanity.

I inspected the milky residue on the windshield… I scraped it with a fingernail. Pollen. Mold. Not sap. Definitely not breath, I told myself.

The mist tingled against my cheeks like millions of little teeth as I trudged up the path, my rented sedan abandoned back where the road dissolved into peat and bracken.

The girl’s words, “It eats your regrets, drinks up your cries,” echoed in my skull. I’d read about the Annwyl in moldering archives: not a ghost, but a parasite born from collective grief. Farmers once left offerings of milk and ash at crossroads to appease it.

Ahead, a sign swayed. Its Welsh name, Tŷ yn y Niwl, melting into the rotted wood.

House in the Mist.

Fitting. The building hunched under fog like a vulture mantled over a corpse. The mist wasn't outside, it was in the walls. It oozed from the cracks and curled from floorboards like smoke from a fire. The house didn't stand in the mist. It exhaled it.

I’d Googled it yesterday, hunting a ghost story big enough to save my job. If this didn’t land, I’d have nothing left.

No results found.

No way back. Brooklyn was a graveyard of eviction notices. My mother’s house was worse: a shrine to the past, where silence filled the rooms. I should’ve stayed longer. Should’ve cared more. But caring didn’t pay rent.

Inside, warmth wrapped around me. The fire crackled low, the scent of burning wood almost, almost enough to make me forget the mist outside. Then the wind howled through the walls and the flames flickered, their glow thin and ghostly, casting shadows that whispered warnings I couldn’t quite hear.

Shadows slithered up the walls, their bellies distended, gorged on the faces in the frames. Portraits of hollow-eyed ancestors stared down, their features blurred, smeared by a careless thumb.

“Croeso i chi, Megan fach.”

I hadn’t heard him approach. The innkeeper stood behind the counter, tall, gaunt as a stripped birch, skin stretched drum-tight over his skull. Translucent as vellum in the firelight. When he smiled, something split. A suture popping. Teeth tea-stained. A silver chain glinting beneath his collar.

“Welcome home,” he said.

I clutched my notebook like a crucifix. “Hi, I’m Morgan,” I lied. “I’m… here for research.”

My editor’s last email glowed on my lock screen:

Megan: I’m not your enemy here. The board’s slashing budgets, and subscriptions are down 30% since last quarter. I pushed for your Welsh folklore series because I thought you’d make it sing. But we need urgency. Something that grabs readers by the throat. Remember that Appalachian cult piece you did? That’s the Megan Price I hired. Find that voice again, or I can’t protect your column.

-Tom

I thumbed to an earlier thread, a rare moment of candor he’d deleted minutes later:

Look, I’m drowning here too. Just… give me something I can sell.

Three years spent building my byline at the magazine, sacrificing weekends and relationships. I’d even missed my mother’s final weeks chasing a feature my editor killed, “Too niche,” he’d said. Now I needed something undeniable. Something that would make him eat those words.

In the office, my editor would’ve snorted. “Give me Skinwalkers or give me death. Give me something that’ll make the algorithm scream your name.”

I’d show those small-minded pricks a real story.

I cleared my throat.
“That rhyme the children were chanting… ‘Tŷ yn y Niwl, teeth in the gray’… is that a local saying? What does it mean?”

The innkeeper’s lips pursed, as if rolling the words over his tongue like a marble. Then he shrugged.
“The niwl walks at dusk, and she favors the lost. Best not to linger out after twilight.”

A slow smile.
“You should sleep. The mist comes early.”

My fingers itched to press him further, but I held back. People like him, people who hoarded secrets, never gave them up under pressure. Better to wait, to let the silence do the work. The longer I played along, the more he’d reveal on his own.

The innkeeper traced a cracked nail over the guest ledger, the scrape deliberate, as if he knew the game just as well as I did.

I thought about writing my real name, hesitated, then signed Morgan Price instead. My mother’s name. A petty rebellion.

The innkeeper tsked.
“Names hold weight in the niwl. Yours…” He inhaled sharply. “Yours stinks of fear. And cheap CVS perfume. Try again.”

Above my entry, names dripped in rust-brown ink:

Eira, 1912
Catrin, 1898
Blodwen, 1863

Women’s names. Always women.

I gritted my teeth, writing my real name:
Megan Price
“Happy?”

The innkeeper’s gaze flicked upwards, as if listening to something I couldn’t hear, licking cracked lips.
“She takes what is offered,” he whispered, hand briefly touching his chest, where a hidden locket pressed against thin fabric.

I ignored the last notification from Brooklyn. My editor. Probably more demands, more pressure. I’d check later.

Maybe.

In that moment, it felt as if everything had shifted. The parlor swallowed me whole as I followed the innkeeper inside. Firelight throbbed against ancient wallpaper, casting distorted shadows across framed photographs.

Above the hearth, a wood carving depicted a faceless figure engulfed in swirling vapor. I recognized the motif, Annwyl. I’d read about it in The Mabinogion, a collection of the oldest Welsh stories known to exist.

A primordial force that devoured the breath of the sorrowful. But the artist had added something new: human hands clawing out of the mist, their fingers fraying into smoke.

It made me uneasy.

The innkeeper gestured to a wingback chair beside the hearth, its upholstery worn to a shine where countless bodies had pressed against it.

“Please,” he said, voice dry as autumn leaves… “Sit.”

I sank into the chair, feeling it conform to my body with unsettling familiarity. The shadows stretched greedy fingers as the innkeeper poured tea with a slow, deliberate hand, the amber liquid swirling in the cup. I stared down, watching the surface settle.

Then there was movement.

A reflection. The firelight had caught the glossy porcelain at just the right angle, and within the rippling tea, the innkeeper’s face wavered around the edges of the cup, distorted, wrong. His lips parted. The reflection's did not. 

I blinked. The distortion was subtle, the kind of thing tired eyes might mistake for a trick of the light.

I looked up. The innkeeper’s gaze flicked to the cup, just for a fraction of a second, then he adjusted his posture, shifting out of its reflection. The fire popped in the silence.

“Drink,” he said, voice smooth as wet stone.

I curled my fingers around the cup, but didn’t lift it.

“Why’s the town empty?” I asked.

He stroked a portrait’s cheek, leaving a snail’s trail of grime.
“Empty? No. They’re in the walls. The floor. The mist doesn’t take, she keeps.”

His laugh crackled like a detuned radio.
“You heard her, didn’t you? Out on the road? Your mother’s voice? Your third-grade teacher’s?”

My throat tightened. I had heard it, Mam’s lullaby, pure and soft, slipping through the mist.

“Huna blentyn ar fy mynwes…”

God, I wanted to run toward it, wrap my arms around that voice. But the mist’s breath stank of rot, not lavender and tea. It wasn’t her. Couldn’t be. Yet the voice, the cracked note on “mynwes,” the way it softened on “blentyn”… it was Mam’s, exactly as she’d sung it nights before the diagnosis, before the hospital bed devoured her. Before I fled to Wales, chasing a paycheck thick enough to drown the guilt. I bit my tongue until copper bloomed, anchoring myself in the pain of reality.

The innkeeper leaned close, his breath damp as moss.
“She mimics what you mourn,” he murmured softly, his gaze distant. “The mist is older than the hills, older than names. Maybe it was here before us or maybe we brought it with us, our sadness giving it shape.”

I bid him goodnight.

The stairs groaned like a living thing beneath my feet.
“Mind the third step,” the innkeeper called. “It bites.”

The room reeked of roses rotting in their vase. My heel crushed a cockroach as I backed toward the bed, its curtains puckered with cobwebs. They twitched slightly, even though no windows were open.

On the nightstand: a photograph of a woman in Edwardian lace. Her face, erased. But as I turned away to peer out the window, the glass fogged, a single word scratched into the condensation:

“Eira.”
Then, softer:
“Liars.”

The room had an old metal window peering outside. I could just barely make out the shape of a gnarled and twisted hawthorn tree peeking out of the fog. Welsh folklore warned of them as gateways to the Otherworld, but its thorns glinted like bone, and its roots cradled something pale. A child’s shoe? A rib? I looked away.

CRACK.

The door slammed.

I rushed to it and tried the handle. It wouldn’t budge.

I started beating on the door.
“Hello?”

I heard the footsteps of the innkeeper approach the stairs, but… nothing.
“Let me out!”

He hummed through the keyhole.
“Tŷ yn y Niwl, cradle of bones… Guests may enter, but she claims them…”

I whimpered.
“Please.”

“Rest now, Megan. Your home.”

I spun and rushed back to the window. Second story. Risky, but better than nothing. I pried it open with force I didn’t know I had.

Fog rushed in like a predator, lunging at my eyes. I managed to slam the window shut again, feeling a cold finger trace my spine in the brief instant it was open.

The candle died.

Breathing. Close. Too close. Not mine.

Something inhaled my scent, shampoo, sweat, skin.

“Why?” I choked.

The innkeeper’s voice, speaking now through the door:
“You heard the song, didn’t you? The lost… they always have the keenest ears.”

Firelight oozed under the door, thick as syrup. Shadows pooled, dozens of figures, mouths sewn shut with fog.

Through the writhing gray, a shape formed a woman’s silhouette bleeding into the mist. Edwardian lace clung to gaunt shoulders. Her head tilted. For a heartbeat, I saw my own jawline, my brow. Then the figure’s features shifted. My eyes. Eira’s chin. Blodwen’s grimace. A patchwork of the ledger’s ink.

It rippled, dissolving into the portraits’ hollow stares downstairs. A hundred women. A hundred hungers.

The figure raised a hand (no, a tendril of fog sculpted into skeletal fingers) and brushed my cheek. Cold seeped into my pores, tasting of peat graves and forgotten names.

Finally, the smoke settled on my mother’s face… smiling. “Shall I let you say goodbye this time?” the fog cooed.

“You’re all of them,” I whispered, realization setting in. I turned to run.

The mist rushed forward, shoving past my lips and nostrils, slithering into my lungs like wet, rotting silk.

I choked, hands clawing at my throat. No air. No breath.

The mist wrapped around my fingers, then slid beneath my fingernails, writhing into tender skin, burning like ice.

It slipped into my ears, squirming down my eustachian tubes, filling my head with a muffled, squelching hum, like meat pressed between wet fingers.

It climbed over my eyes, coating them in a slick, milky film.

For a moment, I could still see the firelight, the shifting figures, the innkeeper’s grin. Then it slid behind my eyes. I felt my tears pushed back into my body, the fog curling inside the sockets, wrapping around my optic nerves like cold, wet vines.

A deep, unbearable throbbing built, as though something were pushing out from within.

My pulse stuttered. My lungs screamed for oxygen. I gagged as it reached the back of my throat, a soft, curling tendril stroking the roof of my mouth,

tasting me.

I couldn’t scream. I fell to my knees, body convulsing as the mist drank me in, slow and deliberate. It wasn’t just suffocating me; it was consuming me.

The mist slithered with intent, a thief ransacking my mind, tearing through memories, prying into my skull like a thief cracking a safe. Images flickered, forgotten moments, raw and vivid my mother’s flour-dusted hands, Lily my sister’s sharp farewell. Then it seized one me at Lily’s door, suitcase in hand, guilt a heavy knot between us.

The mist’s hunger deepened, predatory and eager, straining toward Lily’s essence next. 

No! My mind rebelled, clawing at the memory. You can’t have her! I fought to bury it, to summon anything else, but the mist gripped tighter, probing deeper. I could feel the fog’s vines wriggle excitedly, like a dog anticipating a treat.

My mind flashed to our last fight: her car idling in the rain, hospital lights staining her cheeks a sickly blue. You're just like Dad, she'd spat, her voice sharp as broken glass. All take, no stay. Those words had festered in me like a wound I couldn't bandage. Now, as the mist clawed at Lily's memory, I realized this wasn't bravery... it was penance. A debt I'd owed long before the fog ever tasted my regrets.

One last memory flashed, brighter then the others, the address Lily moved into, sent over text. 

"Found it!" Mam's voice said excitedly. 

Memories not my own flooded my consciousness.
Flashes of other women, dozens of them, their final moments stretching eternally within the mist’s memory. A schoolteacher in 1892. A nurse in 1918. A photographer in 1965. All of them now part of the chorus that hummed within the fog.

A new memory. Different than the others. Somewhere else. Sometime else.

17th-century Wales. Smoke hangs thick over a crofter’s hut. A young man, broad-shouldered and ruddy with life, cradles a woman’s body. Elen, his wife, her lungs rattling. Plague? Pneumonia? It doesn’t matter. The village healer spits curses “The Annwyl’s taken her breath. Bury her quick, or it’ll take yours too.”

Dafydd drags Elen’s body into the hills, screaming at the mist. “Take me instead!” The mist shifts, then pauses as if considering. It peels back, revealing a silhouette Elen, whole and smiling. Her voice spills into his skull, honey-sweet. “Bring others. Feed me, and I’ll keep her safe.”

He hesitates. The silhouette curdles. Elen’s face sags, flesh sloughing off in clumps. “Or watch her rot.”

Dafydd sobs. “Yes. Yes.”

The mist rams down his throat. He gags on peat and decay. When he wakes, Elen’s body is gone. In its place a locket, her braided hair inside. The mist whispers “First payment.”

I understood now how Dafydd the innkeeper became complicit to such a monster. Only grief could do that to a man.

The fog had meant to scare me with a show of force, but instead I felt something else, something unexpectedly empowering.

Pity.

I remembered the rhyme. The girl’s warning
The mist mimics what you mourn.

A broken, fractured thought surfaced Soothe her. Give her what she wants.

Through shuddering breaths, I gargled my mother’s lullaby
“Huna blentyn ar fy mynwes…”

For a heartbeat, the mist’s grasp loosened. Then shifted.

For a moment it looked satiated.

Then the lullaby turned against me. Not my mother’s voice. Not anymore.

A hundred whispers slithered into the song. The detuned voices of a hundred women, their breaths still trapped in the mist’s gullet

Eira’s voice cut through the chorus a farmer’s daughter in 1863, lured by promises of a suitor’s letter. (whispering) “He promised orchids and apple trees. Left me waiting at the gate. In my best dress.”
Blodwen (hollow, coughing) “The telegram lied. ‘Missing in action.’ I buried an empty box.”
Catrin (rasping, furious) “I told them I wasn’t sick. They locked me in the attic. Said I’d scare the guests. I kept banging on the attic door. They said it was just for a day… it’s been lifetimes.”

The song that once comforted me was now my scream, my prayer, my death rattle.

Slowly, my fingers began to fray. Touch dissolved into air, leaving gray wisps in their wake. My left hand unraveled first. I watched my fingers turn to vapor, each tendon snapping like a harp string. The innkeeper’s ledger flickered in my mind, M. Price bleeding into Eira, Blodwen, Catrin, a genealogy of prey.

The floor softened. Not wood. Not stone. Something else. It pulsed beneath me, churning. I braced for the drop, the sinking feeling, but I wasn’t sinking. I was evaporating.

My arms.
My legs.
My stomach.

I should have felt terror…
Instead,
I felt everything.

The wind gnawing at the sign outside.
The moss strangling the well’s cobblestone throat.
The innkeeper’s lungs expanding as he hummed.

I felt the forest.
The road.
The distant car’s headlights,
still glowing.

Every molecule of mist, every surface it touched. I was part of it now. Endless.

My voice, my thoughts, thinned to whispers curling into nothing.

The inn’s walls blurred, shifting seamlessly into memory White tiles glistened under flickering fluorescent lights. The hiss of the ventilator behind the curtain matched the ragged sawing of my own breath. IV drips clicked in robotic unison, each beep driving a spike of guilt into my mind. My mother’s bed came into focus sheets starched pale as bone, lavender-scented tissues scattered on the rolling tray.

Suddenly, the inn collapsed back around me as my mind readjusted, but the ventilator’s hiss lingered. The fog exhaled against my ear, labored, mechanical. A twisted lullaby.

My mind dragged me back to the moment I hung up on my mother’s call, the final time she said my name. Now there would be no second chance, no apology. Only rot and regret.

And the mist feasted ravenously on that guilt, growing heavier, more suffocating with every beat of my faltering heart.

It clung to me, fighting for every inch of my soul. It filled my thoughts, pressing against my brain like frostbite.
“You deserve this you unlovable piece of shit,” I thought…
No, it thought.
“I needed you,” Mam said.
No, it said.

I was still here. I wasn’t gone yet.

Eira, Catrin, Blodwen, and the others surrounded me, no longer mere shadows, but women. Faces sharpened, flesh remembered itself, even if only for a moment. They reached for me, their fingers made of mist and longing.

“You can leave,” Eira whispered.
“But we can’t.”
“We all heard them, the voices we needed. That’s how we stayed. That’s how it feeds.”

Regret had bound them. Grief had chained them. But I wouldn’t deny my pain. I wouldn’t run from the memory. I would hold it close.
Closer than the mist ever could.

The mist recoiled.

It had gorged on evasion, on the sweet rot of repressed sorrow. But this raw, unflinching grip on truth it had no teeth for.

The fog groaned, twisting, warping. The innkeeper bellowed from below, his voice suddenly uncertain. He knew. He felt it. The fragile fabric of his dominion was ripping.

“STOP!” he howled. “You belong to her now!”

I sucked in a breath that burned like fire. Memories flooded back. The real ones. My mother’s voice, not the mimicry of the mist. Mam in the kitchen, flour on her hands, laughing. Mam in the summer sun, warm arms around me. Mam tired, frail, but still smiling. And me, there in the doorway, too afraid to stay. Too afraid to watch.

I had left before. But not this time.

“I remember you,” I thought, my thoughts growing firm as my memories solidified, not with regret, but acceptance. “You’re mine, not the mist’s. I won’t abandon you again.”

The mist shuddered.

I gritted my teeth, biting through the fog, and felt my hands and arms start to reform as I dug my nails into reality. Every nerve screamed as I felt myself stitching together, bone reknitting, muscles spasming back into form. It felt like dying and being born simultaneously, agonizing yet undeniably alive.

I would not be rewritten, not be unraveled, not be swallowed into the ledger like the rest. I reached, grasping for something solid.

And then I felt it.

My phone’s tinny vibration through the wood, something the mist couldn’t mimic. Something truly real.

I pushed forward, not just for myself, but for the women who had never escaped. The mist fought back, trying to drag me into the abyss, but it was weakened now, its hold fragile.

“Eira,” I gasped. “Come with me.”

Her form flickered, hesitation warring in her eyes. She hadn’t been real for so long. None of them had.

“You don’t have to stay.” My voice was stronger now. “You remember summer, don’t you? The orchard. The wind… in the apple blossoms.”

The mist roared, the innkeeper shrieking as cracks splintered through the walls. His ledger caught fire, its pages curling into blackened scraps of lost names. The inn was dying. The mist was dying.

Eira’s breath hitched, her gaze flicking upward.
“I do,” she whispered. A tear slipped down her cheek. “I remember.”

And that was all it took.

She reached for me, her misty hand firm with newfound resolve. Catrin surged forward, a silent cry escaping her spectral lips. Blodwen pushed through, her form radiating a weary but powerful determination. All the women who had been stolen, each with their own lost life, their own stolen breath, joined the rush.

“We let it take us. You… you’re still holding on,” Eira said with admiration.

The innkeeper wailed. His body fissured, centuries of borrowed time collapsing.

Papery skin flaked first, drifting like ash from a cigarette. Then his hands coarsened, grainier, crumbling into a slurry of sand and bone. “N-no…” he rasped, but his jaw disintegrated mid-protest, teeth clattering to the floor like shattered porcelain. His locket still vomiting black peat and wriggling larvae.

“No. No, she’s here, I can bring her back.”

The mist laughed, its voice shifting, warping. Elen’s voice curdled into a mockery. “Liar.”

The locket snapped, splitting in two. Not hair. Not a keepsake. Just blackened, rotting sludge, writhing with maggots.

He clawed at his locket, as if he could stuff the truth back inside. “Please, I did everything you asked. I I gave you everything!”

“Elen,” he sobbed. “You were supposed to be waiting.”

Centuries ago, he’d knelt in this same spot, bargaining with the mist. “Take my lungs, my tongue, my bones… just give her back.” The mist took none of those. It took his soul, one ledger entry at a time.

The ledger was his confessional. Each name a Hail Mary rasped into rotting wood. Forgive me, Father, for I have trafficked your daughters. But the mist was no priest. It ate his penance, hungry as sin, while Elen’s locket grew cold. His soul colder.

His spine sagged, vertebrae collapsing into silica. Ribs powdered as they struck the floor. By the time his knees buckled, he was more sand than man, a twitching pile of grit, eye sockets hollowed to pits. The women’s whispers rose, relentless

For the orchard.
For the telegram.
For the attic.

Their breath scoured him, grain by grain, until nothing remained but a damp stain and the reek of rot. The wind lifted the last of him, a final eddy of sand that briefly sculpted his screaming face, before scattering it into the bracken. Forgotten.

The mist screamed.

The walls shattered.

Then it convulsed, rippling like an injured animal. It wasn’t dying it was adapting.
The whispers inside it grew sharper, honing themselves into a single voice my mother’s.

“Don’t go.”

I stiffened. The voice wasn’t the distorted mockery from before. It was warm. Familiar. Perfect.

“I forgive you,” my mother’s voice whispered. “Stay. Stay and we can talk. I miss you, blentyn.”

The warmth of home rushed in flour-dusted kitchens, lavender tea, laughter on summer mornings. The smell of Mam’s cardigan, the one she kept in the linen closet because it still smelled of Dad. The mist wasn’t attacking now it was tempting.

My breath hitched.

I wanted this.

Just a little longer.

It had stopped fighting because it had found another way to keep me.

I thought of Eira, Blodwen, Catrin the women who had stayed. Not because they were weak, but because they needed to hear the voices one more time.

"Megan," my mother’s voice whispered. "I forgive you. Stay."
Warmth flooded my chest. For a heartbeat, it wasn’t mist curling around my arms, it was her cardigan, heavy with the scent of lavender and tea. I was seven again, curling into her lap, safe. Loved.

Just a moment more.

My lips parted. A breath away from answering.

Then, 

The truth hit me like a slap. The cardigan hadn’t smelled like lavender in years. The fabric had frayed at the cuffs. And Mam’s voice… Mam’s real voice had never begged.

"No," I rasped.

The illusion wavered. The warmth turned rancid.

The mist screeched, its edges fraying, unraveling into tendrils of vapor.

The warmth of Mam’s voice twisted, breaking into something shrill. Something hungry.

“No,” I repeated, stronger. I wasn’t staying.

“You’re not her,” I said with resignation. “And I’m not yours.”

And then, I was falling.

Cold air punched into my lungs. My eyes flew open. I was on the ground, damp leaves clinging to my skin, the taste of iron and fog still thick on my tongue.

The inn was gone.

Nothing remained. No sign of Tŷ yn y Niwl. No sign of the mist. Just a stretch of dirt road leading into the hills, golden with the first touch of dawn.

I gasped for breath, my chest aching, my fingers trembling. Then my knees buckled. I collapsed onto the dirt road, gulping air that tasted of pine and petrol instead of rot. My fingers clawed at the earth, half-expecting it to dissolve into mist. But the gravel bit into my palms, real, unyielding. Dawn bled across the sky, painting the hills in gold. For the first time in hours, I heard birdsong.

My phone buzzed. Again. Again. A lifeline.

I started fumbling to pick it up.

A missed call.

Then another.

And another.

My editor.

I was back.

I stared at the phone. The editor’s name glowed.

The voicemail could wait.

Somewhere, a lullaby hummed my mother’s true voice, untainted by mist. I swiped to my photos, thumbing past Brooklyn skylines until I found it Mam in the orchard, apron dusted with flour, mid-laugh.

For the first time in years, I pressed CALL on her number. The line rang. Rang. No answer. But as dawn broke, I whispered
“I’m sorry. I’m here.”

The wind curled around me, soft and warm. Leaves and lavender tea.

I stood, eyes on the hawthorn tree, as I dialed my editor.

A choked sob bubbled up in my throat. I pressed the phone against my ear and played the voicemail.

Megan, look… I was out of line. The deadlines, the pressure… it’s not an excuse, but it’s been a shitty few months. The divorce, the numbers, the…
A pause… A sigh.
“You’re a damn good writer. I should’ve said that more. Just… come back. We’ll figure it out. Call me, okay?”

I let out a breath that didn’t taste of mist.

I sat up slowly, my body aching but whole. My name, unchanged, unforgotten. I checked my reflection in my phone’s screen, half-expecting to see my face smeared away like the women in the portraits.

I was whole. I was Megan.

And for the first time in years, that felt like enough.

I glanced over my shoulder. The road was empty.

But as the sun rose higher, I swore I saw something. A shimmer in the air, like heat off pavement. And for just a second, a figure stood at the edge of the woods.

Eira.

Her translucent form wavered in the dawn light. Her expression was unreadable, but there was something in her eyes. A quiet gratitude. Freedom.

Then, like breath on a winter morning, she faded.

Sunlight warmed the playground below, now vibrant and alive. Even the old Yew tree swayed gently, free of shadows. I turned back to the hawthorn. The thorns bloomed with roses, crimson petals unfurling like fists loosening. At its roots, the pale shape I’d glimpsed earlier resolved not a rib, but a key, rusted and half-buried. A child’s treasure. A way home.

I swallowed hard, my fingers curling around my phone.

Then, with a slow, steady breath, I tapped my editor’s name and hit CALL BACK.

The mist had taken many.

But I was not one of them.


Back in Brooklyn, I stood at Lily's door, her unanswered calls still ringing in my skull. The key to Mam's house weighed heavy in my palm. 

I pressed play one last time. 

"Where are you? She's asking for you" a pause. A shaky breath. Then, softer: "I'm asking for you too."

I raised my fist and knocked. 

Somewhere, a ventilator sighed its last.
