The Job description sounds simple enough: Trim the shrubs, bag the debris, get paid, go home. The job itself is never that simple. There’s always some detail about the job that the client fails to mention.

I pull up to the property and step out of the van. The bushes in front of the house are wild and unruly, growing up above the roof, branching out in front of the front door and windows, each bush tangled into the one next to it. Yeah, this is a mess. It looks like they haven’t been maintained in years. Oh well, it’s nothing I can’t manage. One might find the sheer volume of removal and disposal intimidating, but I get paid by the hour, and I sure could use the money.

I unload my tools: loppers, trimmers, clippers, a ladder, and compost bags. I start with the branches overhanging in front of the door, trim and shape that area in minutes. Beautiful. Then the branches covering the windows. Trim and shape. Beautiful. After that I move on to the smaller bushes on the right side of the house, lop the large branches that are sticking up and out too far or growing into each other. Once that’s done, I grab the trimmers and cut off the excess bringing the bushes into nice symmetrical shapes. Beautiful. That’s half the job done already. All that’s left are the larger bushes on the left side of the house.

I set up the ladder and climb up, loppers in hand. Starting with the edge, I work my way in. Snip and throw. Branches fall to the ground. Snip and throw. It’s monotonous work, but it’s not hard, it just takes patience. Once everything is clipped and clean I’ll bag up the branches and debris and get out of here. Snip and throw. Snip and, “Fuck!” Something stung me in the arm. The loppers fall out of my hand and hit the ground. It flies out of the bush in my direction and I jump back off the ladder to avoid getting stung again.

They never tell me when they have wasps. Probably, they didn’t even know they had wasps nesting in their bushes. People who don’t take care of their own gardens hardly ever even know what’s in them. I swear, this had just happened at the last house I worked at. Only then I was stung three times.

Of course, I’d come prepared. I walk back to the van and grab a can of wasp killer out of the back. They’re just protecting their home, but unfortunately for them their home has to go if I’m going to get paid. I take aim and spray, dowsing the bush in white foam, emptying the entire can. Once empty, I return to the van for another can. I’m not taking any chances. “Sorry wasps. You shouldn’t have messed with me. Now you have to die.” I take aim and…

Something’s wrong. Everything is getting blurry. “Oh no.” I know what’s happening. It had happened once before when I was attacked by a hoard of surprise fire ants. I’m going into anaphylaxis. But why? I’m not allergic to wasps. I’d been stung plenty of times before and never had a reaction like this. My throat constricts. Everything is getting hot. I’m sweating like a beast. I have to get to the van. With each step I take my vision blurs between black and a hazy distortion of what I should be seeing. Struggling to steady my vision as I stumble towards the van. Somehow I manage to open the door and crawl into the passenger seat. I open the glovebox and fumble around blindly inside. It has to be in there. I can feel it. Firmly, I grasp the EpiPen and stab myself in the leg. All I can do now is wait. Wait for my senses to come back to me. Wait till I can breathe again, see again, move again.

After some time, my vision returns, but I’m still in no condition to get back out there. I can’t tell how much time has passed, but it’s getting late. The sun is setting and the job is unfinished. I call the client and tell them what happened, and that I’d have to come back to finish tomorrow. They tell me they understand. I really didn’t want to have to drive back out here. Oh well. Not like I can work without any light. At least the wasps should be dead. I did dowse that bush pretty thoroughly with wasp killer. I drive home, wash off my sweat drenched body, and sleep.

The next day I come back. Before I step out of the van I throw on a bomber jacket to cover my arms, and wrap a scarf around my neck and head. It has to be a hundred degrees out, and I’m severely overdressed for this heat. I look ridiculous, not like a gardener at all, but I’m not chancing getting stung again. I still have another bottle of wasp killer left so I dowse the whole bush again before even trying to get in there and cut anything. When I’m done, I look for signs of life and see none. There’s no way anything could still be alive in there. I set up the ladder and climb up, lopers in hand. Snip and throw. Snip and throw. This shouldn’t take long. Another hour and I should be done. Snip and throw. Snip and “Not again.” It hit me right in the chest. I fall straight back off the ladder. I can see them flying at me. They’re fast. They’re… I don’t know what they are but they’re not wasps. They’re bigger than wasps. They’re winged, black, and angry. I race to the van. There’s one more stick of epinephrine in the glove box. They hit me again, once more, twice more. I make it. I hurry in. Luckily none of them seem to have gotten in the van with me. But this isn’t good. Last time I was only stung once and that was nearly enough to take me out. At least this time I was faster to respond. I pull out the EpiPen and stab myself with it. My vision hasn’t gone black yet, however I worry that it soon will. No way can I drive away in this state when I could possibly black out any time. No way can I get back out there and finish the job. It’s a lost cause. Whatever those creatures are they won. They can have their home.

My throat constricts. My vision blurs. I have to shit really bad. A reaction to the poison or the epinephrine or both. I climb into the back of the van and throw a garbage bag in a bucket. Best I can do in this situation. After I’ve emptied my bowels, I pull up my pants and sit back in the passenger seat. All I can do is wait. Can’t even crack the window for fear that any of those things would fly in.

Time passes and my senses gradually come back to me. I call the client and tell them that they’d have to get an exterminator to deal with those insects, whatever they are, before I can finish the job. She tells me she’s going to call one, and will let me know when they come. I go home. I wait. A job that should have taken one day has already taken up two and it’s still not done. I’ve basically lost two days of work and won’t be getting paid until the work is done, which is entirely dependent upon when the exterminator can get out there. It should have been an easy job, but it never is. I’m not happy about any of this.

The next day, the client calls me and says that the exterminator won’t be able to come out for another week. That’s not going to work for me. My rent is due in a few days, and I need to get paid. I can’t exactly wait another week. Besides that, I’d left my tools in their yard and need to retrieve those. It looks like I’m going back, but first I need to prepare myself.

The heavy duty gloves and beekeeper outfit cost a little bit, but the pay off when the job is done should cover the cost, and the rest of the money I need for rent, and maybe even a value meal at a drive-through if they tip me. Not that anyone ever tips their gardener.

I’m ready. I drive up and step out of the van, two cans of insect genocide in hand. This time I can see them swarming around the bush. They’re alert, and they’re angry. But this time they don’t stand a chance. Whatever they are, they’re dead. I take aim and fire. Black insects fall from the air and crash to the ground. The swarm buzzing about the bush dissipates until no more of them can be seen. But I’m not done. There’s probably still more inside. I aim and spray, covering the bush in a cloud of poison. The bush starts rattling violently, like something inside is shaking it. A storm of black creatures bursts out from within it. They fly towards me en masse. I shoot a stream of poison at them, but there’s just so many of them that I don’t even make a dent in their numbers. The force of a billion insects crashes into me like a wave knocking me to the ground. They’re upon me. Their stingers pierce through the mesh of my mask stopping just short of my face. They surround me like a black cloud blocking out all light, blocking out anything that isn’t them. All I can hear is the buzzing of a billion insects. I feel them crawling on me. But the suit. I shouldn’t be able to feel them through it. They’re tearing through the suit, devouring it. The suit is torn to shreds. Their stingers pierce me over and over. My throat constricts. I can’t breathe. Everything is black...
