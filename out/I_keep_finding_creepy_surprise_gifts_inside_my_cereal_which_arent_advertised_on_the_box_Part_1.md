It started on a Sunday. I was standing in my kitchen, bone-tired from having worked a night shift, and had just cracked open a fresh box of cereal when I heard this 'ding' of something heavy falling into the bowl.

I looked down to see a tiny green, glow-in-the dark toy alien staring back at me. It was shrink-wrapped for hygiene, but that was beside the point.

I've been eating the same knock-off brand of Cornflakes for years now, mainly because it’s cheap, and also because it’s apparently healthier than all the other sugar-packed crap, but not once had I found a 'surprise gift’ inside. That was the kind of thing you expect to leave behind with your tweens, like graduating from a Happy Meal to a Big Mac.

I checked the box of cereal and, sure enough, they weren't running some kind of strange alien themed promo to boost sales.

Working nights makes you slightly delirious, and I remembered unwrapping the alien with a manic grin before popping it down on my games console like some kind of bug-eyed mascot.

I picked up my controller to play until I got tired, munching on the cereal as I went and didn't think much more of it. After all, it was easy to imagine the alien accidentally falling from one of the other manufacturing lines during the packaging process, and it was just a harmless toy. If only it'd stayed that way.

I did another week of work, finished off the box of cereal and must have picked up another when I went shopping because I didn't notice the next 'surprise gift’ until I sat down to eat and heard the packet rustle against my spoon. I fished out the see-through package to find a single condom inside and sat bolt upright.

Thankfully, it looked unused, but it put me off my cereal straight away.

"The fuck?" I said, binning off the rest of the bowl and rinsing my mouth out for good measure.

Feeling queasy, I stared at my latest 'surprise gift’ on the counter for a while wondering what the hell was going on. What kind of factory packages both cereal and condoms, let alone single ones? The only other time I'd seen them in the wild like that had been in night club men’s rooms, i.e. the kind you buy from a machine for rip-off prices because you think you're just about to get lucky.

Hoping to find some answers, I tried calling the hotline on the cereal box but no one picked up. Somehow, this didn't seem surprising. I mean who actually called the numbers on these things? There was also an email address so I pinged them a message and got a mailer daemon error, which seemed par for the course.

Reaching a dead-end, I decided I'd speak to the store manager when I was next in—assuming I hadn't forgotten by then. Given the image of that condom sitting on my spoon was pretty much scarred onto my brain at that point I doubted I’d forget anytime soon.

Sure enough, the next time I rocked up to the superstore I made a beeline for the manager’s office before I'd even so much as glimpsed the cereal aisle.

I passed a few familiar faces on the way, which given how long I'd lived in the area was hardly surprising. Hell, the neighbors kid, a family friend, and a guy from the same class year as me all worked in this store—the latter of which helped me track down their boss.

"You wanted to speak to me, sir?" She asked.

"Yeah…”

She took me into her dingy office and I tried my best to explain the situation to her without sounding like a conspiracy theorist. I showed her both the toy alien and the condom, and to her credit she seemed to believe me, or at least have one hell of a good poker face.

“And the alien was wrapped too?”

“Well, yeah,” I replied, now wishing I hadn’t opened it. After the condom, the alien didn’t seem quite as funny anymore. “Has anyone else reported anything like this?”

“Not that I'm aware of. I mean, I could check with the other stores and maybe reach out to our suppliers just in case…?”

“Yeah, OK.”

“In the meantime, maybe it's best you tried another brand instead?”

“Sure.”

I left her office feeling like I was making a mountain out of a molehill. I guess in the grand scheme of things, I was just complaining about getting free stuff but either way the vibe was all wrong. It felt sinister somehow, like someone was trying to send a message.

Anyway, I followed the manager’s advice and decided to switch cereal just to be safe. They had some kind of off-brand Cap’n Crunch on special offer. It was the multicoloured type and there was one box left so I figured why not, I could do with a bit of nostalgia.

I vividly remember opening that box as soon as I got home. I wasn’t even hungry, more just curious, or perhaps even paranoid at that point. What if it wasn’t just that knock-off Cornflakes brand after all?

I prised up the cardboard top and pulled open the bag of cereal to find only a sea of coloured cereal chunks. No ‘surprise gift’ this time. To be sure, I dug a hand inside the bag but couldn’t feel, or hear, any crappy plastic wrapped freebies, so figured I was in the clear.

I closed up the box and got on with the rest of my day, feeling slightly relieved. I didn’t notice my hand was bleeding until after I’d finished lugging a load of boxes around at work, and figured I’d just picked up a paper cut from those instead.

I didn’t put two and two together until that night when I got home, poured out a bowl of cereal, took a bite and felt my cereal bite back.

Hard.

You know that moment, right after taking a bite of food when your eyes tell your brain its going to be soft but then your teeth and jaw get blindsided by something solid and completely unexpected, like getting the proverbial rug pulled out from under your feet?

I felt that, but times a hundred. My mouth seemed to explode with sharp pin pricks of pain. I jolted forward, dropping my spoon and watched in disbelief as blood dripped down from my mouth into the milk of the cereal bowl.

I rushed to the bathroom and spat the mouthful into the sink. Something small and metallic hit the basin and I stared in horror at the thumb tacks hiding amongst the chunks of half-chewed cereal. There were three of them, and they were multicoloured, as if to blend in.

Scared shitless, I looked in the mirror and saw a fourth sticking into my tongue.

“Grgh!”

I fished it out with my fingers and started to panic. The blood tasted warm and metallic in my mouth. I rinsed and I rinsed but it just kept flowing, like a river. I spied the mouthwash on the side and kept putting it off because I knew it’d sting like a bitch but eventually I caved. I had to clean the cuts somehow.

My mouth felt on fire as I swilled it out, before texting my older brother to take me to hospital. It must have really freaked him out because he was over in minutes and looked as white as a sheet. I sat with a makeshift spit-bucket under my chin the whole drive as he barraged me with questions, but I could barely talk my tongue was so numb.

All I could think about was what if the tacks had been laced with some kind of poison, or disease? Thankfully, after grilling me for details at the hospital, they tested me and apart from the pain, I was fine.

It wasn’t until I got discharged from the ER later that day and my brother drove me home that I realized how badly the cereal had been sabotaged. I watched as he poured out the rest of the box onto the counter and found a handful more of the multicoloured thumb tacks as well as a small, empty plastic packet at the bottom with one more inside.

“Look,” he said, holding up the tiny see-through bag and pointing to the slice across the top, “Whoever put this in must’ve cut the top first with scissors, or something.”

“Who does that kind of thing?”

“You’re lucky you didn’t accidentally swallow them.”

I nearly heaved at how closed I’d come to doing just that. I think I’m put off eating cereal for life now, but a part of me still wants to know what lunatic did this, and why. Are they targeting me, or am I just some unlucky rando?

I almost feel scared to ask, but have any of you guys found any ‘surprise gifts’ in your cereal lately…?
