The baby monitor crackled. Just static at first, whispering through the dark like a faint breath. Then, beneath the static, a sound—a wet, slow clicking, like something smacking its lips.

I sat up in bed, my chest tightening. My wife lay beside me, still asleep. The red light on the monitor blinked erratically, flickering in and out. Then another sound came through: laughter.

But it wasn’t my baby’s.

I bolted upright, heart hammering. The nursery door was ajar—just slightly, though I was certain I had shut it. I stepped inside.

The crib was empty.

A single, tiny footprint—too long, too narrow—pressed into the soft carpet, leading away.

My daughter was never found.

⸻

That was twelve years ago. I don’t sleep anymore.

Not well, anyway.

Some nights, I wake up gasping for air, my chest tight, because I know something is in the room. I never see it. Not fully. But I can feel it. A shadow in places where shadows don’t belong. A prickle at the base of my neck, like unseen eyes dragging over my skin.

And then there are the photos.

They come in the mail. No return address. Just a plain, unmarked envelope, slid under my door in the dead of night.

They are always the same.

A picture of my house. Then, closer—my bedroom window. Then, inside the house. And in the final photo, a dark, thin figure crouching beside my bed, grinning at the camera.

I don’t tell my wife.

Because when I look closely, the figure has my daughter’s eyes.

⸻

Two weeks ago, the knocking started.

At first, it was light. Fingertips tapping against the window glass. Then it grew louder. More insistent. A slow, rhythmic knock at exactly 3:33 AM every single night.

The first time, I stayed in bed. My wife didn’t wake up. I told myself it was just the wind.

But the second night, I crept to the window.

A figure stood in the yard, just beyond the porch light’s reach. Too tall. Too thin. Its arms hung too long, past where a person’s knees should be. Its head tilted, almost curiously.

It knocked.

Once. Twice. Three times.

I didn’t open the window. I went back to bed.

The next morning, there were footprints in the grass.

But they didn’t lead to the window.

They led from it.

⸻

It speaks now.

Not loudly. Never when I try to listen.

But when I’m about to fall asleep, teetering on the edge of consciousness, I hear it:

“Let me in.”

It doesn’t sound angry. Or impatient.

It sounds amused.

⸻

The photographs are different now.

No longer just pictures of my house.

They show me, sleeping.

And each night, in every new photo, the thing in the background gets closer.

Last night, it was standing beside my bed.

⸻

I don’t sleep anymore.

But I still dream.

I dream of the night my daughter disappeared, except now, in the dream, I can see what took her.

It does not have a face.

It has too many fingers.

And it does not take children.

It replaces them.

⸻

Tonight, I set my phone on the nightstand and press record.

When I wake up, there are six hours of silence.

Then, at exactly 3:33 AM, the audio crackles.

A soft creak of the door opening. Slow, deliberate footsteps. A long, low breath inches from the microphone.

And then, just before the recording cuts off—

“I think it’s your turn now.”
