I’ve been posting on r/nosleep for years. Nothing too crazy, just eerie short stories. Sometimes I get a decent number of upvotes, sometimes my post vanishes into the void. It’s a fun little hobby.

Tonight, I had a new story ready—something about a man getting phone calls from himself in the future. It wasn’t my best work, but I figured it was good enough to post.

I hit **submit** and waited.

Within a minute, I got the first upvote. Then a second. Then, the comments started rolling in.

I saw the notification: **5 new comments.**

I clicked on the post, excited to see some engagement.

There were only **four** comments.

At first, I thought Reddit was glitching. Maybe someone deleted their comment right after posting it? But something felt off. Every comment that was there **was a reply.**

But there **was no 5th comment.**

I refreshed the page. Still four. My heart started to race.

I backed out of the post and went to my notifications. **Still five comments.** But when I clicked again—only four.

Then, I got a **Reddit message.**

My body went ice cold.

People do weird, in-character replies all the time on r/nosleep, right? Maybe this was some elaborate joke? But something about it felt… **wrong.**

I checked the sender’s username. It was just **\[deleted\].**

No profile. No history. Nothing.

I switched to a different device, opened my post again, and refreshed.

**100 comments.**

I blinked. That had to be wrong. It had only been a few minutes. But when I scrolled down, my stomach dropped.

**Every single one was a reply.**

A reply to the missing **5th comment.**

I counted. **99 comments were visible.**

Never 100. Never more.

And every single one of them said something chilling.

My breathing turned shallow. The room suddenly felt smaller, darker.

I slammed my laptop shut. My phone buzzed. Another Reddit notification.

My hands shook as I typed a response.

I didn’t expect an answer.

But one came, almost instantly.

I hesitated before reopening the post.

The number had jumped. **250 comments.**

All replies to the 5th.

My breath hitched. I started scrolling faster, trying to see if anyone was acknowledging what was happening, if someone else was seeing what I was seeing. But no. **Every single comment was engaging with something that wasn’t there.**

And then, at the very bottom, I saw it.

A **new comment.**

From a user named u/thefifthone**.**

It simply said:

I turned off my computer.

I turned off my phone.

I haven’t gone back on Reddit since.

But last night, I heard my phone buzz. Just once.

This morning, when I checked…

There was **one notification.**

A Reddit message.

From u/thefifthone**.**

I haven’t opened it.

And I don’t think I ever will.

But now, as I type this… I realize something terrifying.

There are **five unread messages** in my inbox.

And no matter how many times I count…

I only see **four.**
