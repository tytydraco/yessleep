Back when I still had a voice, nobody really spoke to me at work unless they had to, which I can't really blame them for. But now that I've shown up rocking my "HELLO, I'm mute :("badge and a [huge lump of gauze on my neck,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/Vx9RoHx53z) suddenly everyone is interested in me. I wonder if they thought I was joking.

(By the way, if you haven't seen my previous updates, start [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/QVXG3AJCiP) to see my life fall apart in real time.)

There was even a jackass from the chemistry lab that thought he could get me to 'slip up' by asking me some inflammatory political questions that don't merit repeating here. He looked eager when he saw that I was taking a while to scribble on my notepad, only to appear disappointed when he discovered that I had spent all that time drawing a picture of a walrus in a top hat. 

It was an excellent picture, by the way. Some people just have no culture. 

Between that, the constant questions about my hurting neck, and if the injury was in any way related to my newfound mutness, I was beginning to miss when my coworkers avoided me. 

Unsurprisingly, my 'bestie' was waiting for me when I took my break. Ramy was leaning back in his chair, arms behind his head, eyes hidden by his sunglasses once again. 

"You're the talk of the place right now, you know that Lab Rat?" He said with a smirk. "I swear, some people have nothing better to do." 

As I got my coffee, the only response I gave him was a head shake. It's not like I could do much else with my hands full. 

"Anyways," He continued. "I'm going to need you to do something for me after work. Don't worry, it'll be easy. You'll find a box on your passenger seat. I don't give a shit if you look inside it or not, since I know you most likely won't be able to help yourself. Just make sure it gets to where it needs to go." 

That was his big request? He wanted me to be a delivery boy? Something *had* to be up. It couldn't be that easy. 

Ramy didn't seem to notice the suspicious look I gave him, "Also, for your own safety, you should get this done before dark. Your hot date from last night only goes out when the sun is down. Unless, of course, you'd like to join her for drinks again, then by all means, you do you."

As if on cue, my neck ached. The bite was better thanks to whatever Ramy did to it, however, the new skin under the gauze was bright pink and so sensitive that leaving it open to the air stung something fierce. It was going to be a while yet before I could leave it uncovered. 

Once I got off of work, I went to the PT Cruiser and sure enough, there was a nondescript wooden box on my passenger seat. I didn't trust anything about that situation. It *couldn't* be that simple. Something was wrong here. But at the same time, my curiosity has done nothing but bite me in the ass throughout the past week, so I told myself that I didn't need to know what was in the box. I just had to bring it to the address written on it and then forget about it. This was fine. It was going to be fine. 

The address was only twenty minutes away from work, right near the lake. As I drove, I noticed a smell in the car that was earthy, yet also slightly metallic. At a stop sign, I found myself eyeing the box suspiciously. The strange smell had to be coming from there. 

No, I did not open it. I reminded myself that it was most likely better not to know. 

Eventually, I arrived at a house. On the front porch flew two flags, one of which was the American flag, the other had the United States Marine Corps logo on it. Another thing that I noticed was something that had come up when I was researching jinn: talismans to ward off the Evil Eye as well as a plethora of malevolent spirits hung on the front door, jingling together like wind chimes. 

I reminded myself yet again that none of this was any of my business. I took a deep breath and left the PT Cruiser, holding the box in both hands. It was heavier than I expected, at least ten pounds. All that I was going to do was set the box on the porch and go off on my merry way. Easy as can be. 

But then the homeowner came out with a shotgun. Instantly, I dropped the box and put my hands in the air, making my already agonized neck even more sore. 

"The fuck you want?" The homeowner shouted.

I used one hand to point at my badge while keeping the other in the air. He yelled that he couldn't read it from there, so I took off the badge and threw it to him. Without taking his eyes off of me for even a second, he held up the badge. 

"You really can't talk?" He eventually yelled, but thankfully, he sounded slightly less pissed than he had a moment ago.  

I shook my head. The homeowner lowered his shotgun and nodded in my direction, "What's in the box?"

I slowly got my notebook and pen out of my pocket, not wanting this already on-edge man to think I was reaching for a weapon, then held them up to him. His eyes were narrowed, but he didn't raise his shotgun again. I wrote that I didn't know what was in the box, I was just supposed to deliver it. As I was about to throw the notepad to him, he curtly told me that I could just come onto the porch, but to leave the box where it was. 

I obeyed, letting the mystery package where it sat in his driveway. Now that I was closer, I recalled seeing his face before, but I couldn't place from where. After he read my note, he demanded to know who sent me, so I gave him Ramy's real name. 

"I have no idea who that-" The homeowner paused suddenly, getting a strange expression on his face. "You wouldn't happen to know if he's from Iraq, would you?"

Reluctantly, I nodded. 

His jaw clenched and his eyes narrowed. "You better get the fuck out of here."

He didn't have to tell me twice. I practically ran off of his porch and sped off as quick as my terrible car was capable of. If I'm going to have to keep making these dramatic escapes, I may have to look into getting a better car, or at least one that's not as easily recognizable. 

Even though I had not looked inside the box, I couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't over yet. Or that I'd made a horrible mistake. I told myself that the consequences of failing to meet Ramy's request would be far worse than anything that a human man could do to me. This was fine. Right? I did what I had to do, right?

Once I got home, I locked everything up. I still had plenty of time before the sun set, but I didn't want to take any chances of having another encounter with the woman with backwards feet. 

However, she ended up not being what I had to worry about that evening. Maybe an hour or so after getting home, I heard tires screeching outside. Confused, I peeked between the blinds to see that a red pickup truck was roaring to a hasty halt in my driveway. 

The homeowner from earlier jumped out of the driver's seat and he looked *pissed.* 

Frantically, I grabbed Ciri off of where she slept on the couch and ran with her to my bedroom. There was crawl space in the back of my closet. I shoved some clothes aside, pushed Ciri into the crawlspace first despite her protests, moved the clothes back where they were to cover the entrance up, then closed the tiny door. 

Mere seconds after, there was a loud crash as my door was kicked open. 

"Where the fuck are you?!" Echoed throughout my house, making my hair stand on end. Ciri was crouched, tail fluffed up, thankfully not making a sound now. "You got the balls to leave my own brother's head in my yard, now you can't even fucking face me?!"

Oh my God. That's why he'd looked familiar. He was the [bearded man's](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/xjikKKmejI) brother. Oh God, what have I *done?*

Ramy was close. The shithead most likely knew this was going to happen. I just had to hope that he got here before the man in my house discovered my hiding place. 

I could hear the shrill clatter of glass breaking as the man trashed my house in his search for me. The entire time, he continued to berate me, trying to bait me out. It wouldn't have been so horrible if he'd just been enraged, but his voice was also thick with grief. I held a hand over my mouth as my eyes became blurry with tears.

I'd read that jinn, like humans, are capable of good, evil, and all other moral alignments in between. Even now, I'm not entirely convinced that Ramy is evil and judging by the comments that I've gotten on previous updates, a decent number of you seem to feel the same way as I do. But this is... Fucking hell, Ramy. 

The man's heavy footsteps were in the bedroom, far too close for comfort. I heard another crash that made me jump as he flipped the bed over. I'm sure that if he would've stopped rampaging and listened, he could've heard my heart hammering in my chest. 

"Get out here! Fucking face me!" 

The closet door opened. I didn't dare to even breathe as I heard the floor creak under his weight. He was *right there.* Clothes slid viciously along the hanger. He was going to find the crawlspace door at any moment. 

That's when Ramy arrived and announced his presence to the intruder by calling, "How'd your family reunion go, Matthew?"

The moment he spoke, the intruder stomped towards him. I finally allowed myself to let suck in some air, now that Matthew's attention was on Ramy. I heard another crash, followed by the deafening crack of a gunshot. I hunkered down, curling up around Ciri. 
 
"It was an accident, God damn it!" Matthew shouted, sounding desperate as he punctuated his sentence with another gunshot. 

If Ramy said anything in response, I couldn't hear it over the ruckus. I jumped again as something else in my home was destroyed. Poor Ciri was cowering against my side, her face pressed into my shirt. I gently stroked her back, trying to keep my little kitty calm as well as myself. 

I don't know if Matthew would've hurt her if I hadn't grabbed her, but I'm glad I didn't take a chance on it. 

Abruptly, the sounds of fighting stopped, leaving my home in a silence so dense that it made my ears ring. I waited for what felt like ages, making sure that I didn't hear anything else. I left Ciri, thinking it would be safest if she stayed in the crawlspace until I could make sure that we weren't in danger anymore. 

It looked like a small tornado had gone through my living room. The front door, by some miracle, was still on its hinges, but pieces of the frame where dangling by threads. My coffee table was absolutely decimated, strewn about the room in sections. Of course, everything that was on the table had gone with it; I shivered as my brain conjured images of my skull shattered on the ground instead of my thrifted ceramic mug that said, '#1 Grandma.' As stupid as it sounds, I began to think about how long it was going to take to clean up. 

I initially didn't notice that Ramy was in the kitchen, hands on the counter, completely still. My eyes were immediately drawn to a bullet hole right above his left eyebrow, which didn't seem to be bothering him. He had still been wearing his work clothes, his white shirt now stained a deep red. It was probably ruined beyond even the most aggressive cleaning. His short dark hair, normally gelled, was disheveled. His strange eyes reflected the light from the setting sun like twin mirrors, staring intensely down at the table.

In summary, he looked rabid. 

Cautiously, I waved at him. His shining eyes shifted towards me and he gave me a smile that was made nightmarish by the blood in his teeth. "You did well. Good work, Lab Rat."

Trembling, I frantically searched for my notepad. I had Opinions about what had just happened, but with all the debris on the carpet, I couldn't find it. 

Meanwhile, Ramy ran a hand absent-mindedly through his hair as he sighed, "That didn't go as well as I'd hoped, but that's on me. I shouldn't have underestimated him."

He turned towards the sink, revealing a huge, jagged hole in the back of his head that made my stomach do somersaults. As he started to wash his hands and arms, I gingerly pushed the front door closed. The doorknob was still intact, but the little thing that it's supposed to latch on to was laying on the floor uselessly. I ended up dragging a dining room chair over to prop the door closed. It probably would be better to put something heavier on that until I could fix it, but I was shaking so horribly that I didn't think I was physically capable. I'd do that once I calmed down; it at least would be enough to keep Ciri from running off. Speaking of, I went back to open the crawlspace to free her, thinking it would be best to let her come out on her own terms after what we just experienced together. 

As Ramy used a paper towel to get the blood off of his neck and face, I got my phone out and pulled up a text-to-speech app. I know that I said earlier that I was going to try to mind my own business from now on, but Matthew had come to my house with a gun. If I hadn't hidden in time or if he would have found me, *I* would be the one with a hole in my head. I was already involved. 

The TTS robot voice spoke for me, "Can you please tell me why you wanted me to give that man his brother's head?"

Ramy half turned towards me, "He was hiding behind all of those wards. I had to inspire him to leave the safety of his house somehow."

I made the TTS ask, "Did he do something to you?"

As Ramy finished cleaning himself up, he turned to lean against the counter, crossing one ankle over the other as if we were talking about something normal. I couldn't take my eyes off of his bullet wound. He explained that it wasn't *him* that Matthew had wronged, but 'this body.' Without warning, he untucked the corner of his bloodied shirt and lifted it, revealing blackened, necrotic tissue right over where his heart was, the flesh surrounding the injury bloated in varying shades of purple. 

As I fought off a wave of nausea, Ramy let the shirt fall back into place, politely tucking it back into his waistband. He pointed at the bullet hole in his head with his familiar smile, "This one will go away soon enough. The other one? Not so much."

Since my hands were shaking, I made some mistakes as I typed out my response, resulting in the TTS exclaiming, "Goes it jury?" 

Ramy looked amused as I shook my head quickly in embarrasment and tried again, "Does it hurt?"

He said he didn't feel a thing. That was good, I suppose. It definitely looked painful. 

After a moment of consideration, he gave me a mischievous look as he said, "Since you're so concerned about me, I'll give you another opportunity to help me out. Now, Lab Rat, this won't just be for my benefit, this'll be good for you, too. If you can get rid of all those wards on Matthew's door, I'll give you your voice back."
