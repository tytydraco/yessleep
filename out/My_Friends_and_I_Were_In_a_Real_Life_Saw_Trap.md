 (Yo, this post went under review and was filtered for spam so here I am again, dear reddit review bots, this is NOT spam!!)

Hey. My name is Ayame, I'm a college student, a survivor and a murderer. I'm writing this in a posh restaurant, sitting in a warm patted chair with only a glass of room temperature water in front of me on the wooden table. I can sit here and pretend like I haven't been through absolute hell the last year, but if that were the case I wouldn't be sitting here documenting my experience. I've tried to take to other socials to tell my story but I've been shut down every time, account banned, post deleted blah blah. I decided that I should settle on Reddit as I want to document this experience in great detail as I remember the entire ordeal vividly and I need to get it off my chest.

For a bit of context, I'm Ayame, as you know. I'm a 5'3 Japanese college student attending a university in the United States I'd rather not disclose for safety reasons. Before the ordeal I spent most of my time attending dorm parties, drinking and doing all sorts of things any dumb college bitch would do. I was particularly close with a few of other people my age, 6 of us to be precise:

Linette, a girl who I was close with before starting college. Nettie was an observant, reserved goth, always caught wearing pounds of black makeup, dark clothes and pale skin tints to make her ghostly. Nettie never really attended the parties like the rest of us, instead she'd be back at her dorm updating her Tumblr, where she communicated with other people in the goth community.

The next member of the gang was Kale. Kale was a stereotypical thirsty F-boy who would do anything to get in a girls pants, the trope writes itself. Kale was the party animal of the group, he was always kept the vibes alive and never failed to make any of us laugh.

Kirk was the other dude, but a dude with less luck with women. Kirk was closer with Linette, and usually always has his head in a book. The only reason we kept the dweeb around was because his older brother was a dealer and a good one. We couldn't stand him but if we dropped him on his ass his brother would cut all ties with us. The shy boy tends to avoid alcohol and drugs and usually will be found sniffing a bra belonging to Britney or Porsha.

Porsha was a diva with an attitude. She was a raging feminist and I undeniably found her very attractive, but we all did, and she knew that. Porsha was an aspiring model and was on the track to a successful career. She was trying to get off the drugs to focus on the path she desired, and to mostly clear her name which at the time was 'Porsha Pill Popper'

. The last member was Britney, a close friend of Porsha. Brit and Porsha both grew up together and they each reflect a little of each other. Britney wasn't as big into feminism as Porsha but regardless they always agreed on everything and never disputed or argued, not to our notice anyway. Britney was popular amongst the boys just like her best friend, but unlike Porsha, Brit loved all the attention she got from all the men her age, she'd always wanted to be a celebrity with her friend when she was younger, but this idea faded when she became an addict, and nothing killed her more than seeing her closest friend get closer to the life they always planned together, but she smiled regardless, and congratulated the girl for all her numerous achievements.

With the gang introduced, I can now tell the story of what happened October 29th 2011.

I woke up on a bed a black room, as in black walls, black roof, black floor, black everywhere. Several thoughts ran through my head, as I pondered how I had gotten there, perhaps I got piss drunk at a party and wound up in some run down sex chamber. I heard another groan coming from across the room, it sounded like Kirk so I jutted my head up off the pillow and what I saw gave me a feeling of disgust, confusion and terror. I was in a room with all my peers, every single one of them, tied up and bound to a device. Then it hit me, there was something lodged into my back. In the mattress I lay on, there was what seemed to be a chainsaw digging into my spine, not fatally deep but fuck it hurt.

I screamed in pain which caused some of my friends to jump out of their skin. I was tilted upwards so I could see my friends visibly terrified. Linette looked around, as she sat on a chair above what seemed to be a tank with a fucking shark. I was to stunned to open my mouth or blink, was I dreaming..? Was I high as fuck? This can't be real..

Linette was smeared in what seemed to be fish guts, her eyes bloodshot as she still had her typical goth makeup on. Linette looked down and she saw it, I know she did because when she did she looked straight back at me and shot me a look she's never given me before. Her pupils dilated and for the first time ever she actually looked horrified.  


>''Don't Move Amaye..''

Linette spoke softly not breaking her stare. Something I had noticed was I and Linette had a button by wherever our hands were tied up, neither of us dared to press our buttons however.

Porsha was the next to awaken, making her presence known with a yelp. I and Nettie darted our focus to Porsha, the girl strapped to a pole, with a huge rock at the top of the pole being held up by what we could only presume to be ropes from the roof, but the dimly lit room didn't provide us with much answers.  


>''Porsha.. don't m-move.. It's Amaye. Everything is going to be fine! Just stay put and don't press any buttons yet, assuming you have one near your left hand too, do you?'' I inquired.  
>  
>''What.. a button..? Y-Yeah I feel something behind me, yeah its a button but.. why am I .. AMAYE!'' Porsha yelled my name as she looked at me, the chainsaw barely digging into my spine  
>  
>''Heh.. Don't worry about me Porsha.. Lets focus on the elephant in the room. How the hell did we wind up here and how do we get the fuck out?''

I looked around and eyed Linette before a light suddenly turned on, lighting up the black room a bit, and with the light played a voice recording, waking everyone else up. (I don't remember exactly what was said so take this with a pinch of salt)  


>''Hello, kids. My name is Instructor B. Before you all start screaming questions at me, this is a voice recording and you must listen. As some of you might have realised by now, you are each strapped up to your own individual device, accompanied by a button by your left hand. Do not press the button yet. The button by your left hand can only be pressed once, meaning only one of you will be penalized. If you haven't caught on, each button is magnetically connected to another persons device. If the button is pressed, it will trigger another random device to operate which means one of you is destined to perish. I'll turn off the lights shortly and a timer with 6 hours will appear on a screen. If a button is not pressed within the given time limit, you will all be penalized. And don't even try to avoid death or sneak out of your device, trust me, the consequences will be harsh. Instructor B signing off.''
