Today was an ordinary day, just like any other.
Except it was raining heavily.

I was standing at the bus stop in front of my university, waiting for the bus like I always do.

I take the bus because my school is about fifteen kilometers away from my dorm, and more importantly, it’s much cheaper than any other way of getting around.

I’m a poor student. This is the most practical option for me.

I got on the bus around 9 p.m.
If you’re wondering why I was heading home so late, it’s because I’m a medical student.

The workload is brutal.

There’s also another reason, my dorm is extremely noisy at night. I can’t focus on studying there.

I chose the last row, next to the window.
No one ever fights for that seat.

Who would want a seat that makes you carsick anyway?

I like sitting there, watching the rain slide down the glass while listening to music. It helps clear my head.

About thirty minutes into the ride, I noticed something strange.
No one else got on the bus.

Even though I clearly remembered seeing a lot of people waiting at the earlier stops.

With rain like this, shouldn’t they be getting on?

Whatever. Fewer people means more space.
Suddenly, my music stopped.
My earphones had run out of battery.

The ride was still long, and the bus rules forbid making noise, so the only thing I could do was scroll through news on my phone.

I skimmed through dozens of articles. Nothing caught my attention.

Until I stopped at one posted three days ago.
The headline was short:

“Chain Collision.”

I read it carefully, and my chest tightened.
The accident happened on the exact route I was taking.

A bad feeling crept up my spine. I turned off my phone immediately.

At that moment, the lights inside the bus began to flicker.
On.
Off.

Then they went out completely.

The bus was swallowed by darkness.

After about ten seconds, the lights came back on.

I let out a quiet sigh of relief.

Then I felt it.

A chill ran down my spine.
Like something had just touched me.
I jerked my head up.

Every passenger on the bus was staring straight at me.

Their eyes were completely white. No pupils.
Their heads tilted slightly to the side, mouths stretched into wide smiles that reached their ears.

My heart started pounding.
Panicking, I glanced toward the driver’s seat.
The driver was slumped over the steering wheel.

The ticket inspector was trying to shake him awake, his mouth moving as if calling out.
The bus kept going.

No
It was speeding up.
It crossed into the opposite lane.
I grabbed the seat in front of me.

Then
A deafening crash.
The world flipped.

I woke up in a hospital room.
White lights. The smell of disinfectant.
A doctor entered shortly after. I asked him what had happened.

He told me I had fainted while riding the bus, and the other passengers brought me to the hospital.

“I fainted?” I asked.

The doctor nodded, looking down at my chart.
“You’re severely sleep-deprived and under prolonged mental stress. Final exams, right?”

I nodded.

“Yes.”

He sighed.
“You should rest for a while. Your life is far more important.”

I didn’t ask anything else.
Maybe everything really was just because I was exhausted.

But after the doctor left, I absentmindedly raised my hand to my forehead.

It was wrapped in bandages. It hurt slightly.
Then I noticed my wrist.

A long, dark bruise.

Like someone had been gripping it tightly for a long time.

And I remember clearly.

On that bus

No one pulled me out.
