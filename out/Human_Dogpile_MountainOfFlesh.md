At first there was just me and my brother, playing in the front yard. I'd pile onto him, with my little body, and then he'd pile onto me, with his weight. It probably looked like wrestling, but we were playing a game called 'dogpile'.

We took our game to the schoolyard, where other boys wanted to join in. Whoever won the last game has to start the next round, laying down and then getting piled on by the others. The game got old fast, but it was a good way to start recess, until the school banned it around the time we were all in second grade and we weighed enough that someone could get hurt.

I forgot about it until years later, when the human dogpile, the mountain of flesh started again, but this time with much more sinister results. The comparison to our childhood game and the Galgamond is purely in my own head. Nobody else has called the Galgamond a dogpile, but that's what it is.

The first death occurred when there was still only a score of people on top of whoever died at the bottom. That's the real horror of the Galgamond, the way people lose their identity as individuals and just become part of the squirming, pyramid-shaped heap.

Everyone sees the Galgamond before they pile on. It just keeps growing higher and higher. It reached the size of a small hill and there were dead bodies under all the living people, struggling and trying to stay on top, trying to stay on the outside. Those within were heated and crushed and kicked to death. Some managed to stay afloat, amid the mass of crawling bodies that composed the surface, but soon succumbed to dehydration.

Not everyone died of dehydration, however, for there was a dew of sweat, a trickle of urine and the occasional open wound to suckle. Those who wanted to survive did so, and kept climbing. Once you are part of the Galgamond, you cannot get off of the pile, the only way to stay alive is to climb over the living and the dead, and fight your way out from under those above you. If you stop you sink, and get pulled into the Galgamond, and once you are immobilized, you are doomed.

The voices muffled from within are horrible, but the moans and shrieks and grunts of the outer surface are a maddening cacophony of the purest sound of nightmares. The stench is a miasma, choking and bile-inducing. The Galgamond grew and grew, emerging into a single loud, foul-smelling, writhing mass of incomprehensible blasphemy.

Most of those at the base were dead and rotting by the time it had grown to the size of a small mountain, towering into the sky. Occasional movement of those climbing to the mid-level, where the dying was happening, looked like isolated movement on a slick slope of ruined bodies, crushed and pulverized, sharp bones protruding. Any injury, cut or bruise would invariably become infected. Just above that level was a dark ringed cloud of innumerable flies, attracted to the meat, but unable to land. Only humans could touch the Galgamond, and anyone who did became a part of it.

Anyone who sees it finds themselves walking towards it, unable to turn away. Some gouge out their own eyes in the hope of unseeing it, but they just become the blind who circle its base, prophesying to anyone who passes them. They speak of doom and horror, and they listen to the sound until they can walk no more, and then they collapse upon it, forming a chain of those leaning upon the bottom, staring with empty eye sockets out into the world. There they mutter until they expire.

The horror of the Galgamond isn't what is at the bottom, however, but rather that which sits at the top. At the peak are those who are above the rest, having shed all semblance of sanity, decency and hope, all in the name of survival. They are invariably also the strongest and fittest men, as no others can sustain the physical hardship of the climb.

There they sit, atop the highest peak of the Galgamond, naked, famished and raving. I knew about the Galgamond, and I chose to go to it, for I knew who was at the highest point, and I had to go there to get him.

I made my preparations, taking a backpack with protein bars and as much water as I could carry. I outfitted my body in a wetsuit and as much protection as I could wear, while remaining lightweight. I wore goggles and a mask over my mouth, hoping to reduce some of the awfulness. I put in thirty-two-decibel earplugs.

I spent six hours meditating, trying to ground myself in a moment of tranquility, ignoring the climb. I had no choice, for he was up there, at the top, and I believed that if I removed him, the Galgamond would finally cease. I was very afraid, I was terrified, knowing what it was that I was going to do. Would I die a very bad death? Would I even be me anymore, after making that climb?

There were others who wanted to go with me, but they were not personally motivated like I was, and their fear won out and they backed out. Instead, they wished me luck, hugging me and kissing me and telling me they would be praying for me the whole time.

Then I went to the wasteland around where the Galgamond had formed, from a distance I saw it, a steaming mound, towering into a gray cloud. I shivered in terror, and I took a step forward, and then another. I was on a radio at that point, telling my observers what I was experiencing. From a great distance one can actually look at the Galgamond using binoculars, telescope or electronic surveillance. There were drones hovering around me, as I was still in range of the rest of the world.

It wasn't long before my feet carried me and my willpower was under the pull of the Galgamond. It was a human willpower, like the willpower of a room full of people telling you to do something, except magnified to incomprehensible strength. As I got nearer and nearer the trepidation and anxiety turned to dread and terror. I regretted my boldness, and realized there was no way to reach the top alive, not even with my preparations.

I began the climb, thinking I should have brought ice picks, as there was no longer any resemblance to human remains at the slippery base of the Galgamond. I ascended to the next level, and gradually I lost my wish for ice picks, for now I was climbing over the dead, and there were plenty of helpful hands to cling to as I went.

Somehow the smell wasn't as bad at the bottom, as when I reached fresher remains at the next level. Here there were so many flies that at times I couldn't see much else. They couldn't land, but kept an endless holding pattern, and when they died they fell away from the Galgamond, creating a dark ring around the very bottom, already far below me.

My mind didn't start to crack until I reached the lower layer where among the dead there were some who were trapped and dying. Somehow their predicament made my ascent very difficult, for I did not want to use them as footholds. I realized that higher up I was going to have to get over that. Somehow, the thought recoiled in my mind, and something inside of me broke. I stopped and took a break, realizing I could feel the vibration of the mountain, the pulse of it.

I avoided body-slides as groups tumbled down the face of the Galgamond, still entangled in massive clumps. I had to cross waterfalls that were not made of water, and when I reached the lower levels of the writhing mass of the living, I had to fight off feral climbers who saw that I had food and water. I could not rest, I could not share and I had to keep going. The first time one of these encounters escalated to me kicking someone off of me, and watching them freefall to the lower levels to die, I felt another strand of myself snap inside my mind.

I reached the upper levels of that part of the Galgamond and beheld an entirely new and unexpected horror. Here there was something, some kind of parody of human ingenuity and civilization, for the few who lived at that level had taken from the dead and fashioned crude battlements of bone, forming a kind of rest stop. I was forced to sell some of my water to gibbering things that looked like human beings in exchange for safe passage, rest and the use of a rope made of human hair that allowed me to climb the steep section leading to the top.

While I slept, they robbed me of the rest of my supplies but spared my life.

I used the rope, despite the danger of it breaking and dropping me, for the peak was pushed up from the core of the mountain, an upheaval of corpses that were too sheer to climb. By the end of the fourth day, I had reached the top of the Galgamond.

There they sat, brooding, hulking and withering, the sentinels who had beaten the odds and made it to the summit, only by shedding all that made them once human. They stared at me, and I felt a deep loathing and horror that I cannot describe, for in their eyes were the broken parts of my unraveling consciousness. I too had started to become like them, although my rapid ascent had made me aware of the change. Below us was the entire mountain, countless victims of the Galgamond, and a gray fog.

I slowly clambered past each one, until I reached the one who sat at the very top of the mountain. I could see he was expecting me, and had longed for this reunion, this release from the torment of being the highest point of the lowest state of humanity. Some part of him was in there behind that tortured gaze. He wanted it to be over, but the layers of survival had contradicted his own self. I hugged him, holding his broken and withered frame with love and remorse.

"It's okay," I told him. "It's all over now."

He grunted his acceptance, and together we began our descent.
