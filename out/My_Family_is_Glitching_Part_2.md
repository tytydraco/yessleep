As the years passed, I tried my best to put the haunting memories of the Family Void behind me. We settled into a new home, far away from the cursed house, hoping that the glitchy nightmare was nothing more than a distant memory. But the glitch version of myself seemed unwilling to let me forget.

It started with strange visions that would creep into my dreams. Each night, I would find myself standing in front of that shattered mirror, watching as the glitch version of me broke free from its confines. Its glitchy form would lurch forward, reaching out with black, distorted hands, trying to grasp me by the neck. The terror of those dreams was overwhelming, and I would wake up in a cold sweat, heart pounding, struggling to distinguish reality from the nightmare.

But the horrors didn't stay confined to my dreams. During the day, I began to see glimpses of the glitch version of myself in random reflections—a car window, a store mirror, even the surface of a calm pond. It was as if the glitch version was attempting to cross over into my world, to escape from its digital prison and bring chaos into my reality.

I couldn't bear to share my experiences with my family, fearing that the glitch version might somehow find a way to harm them. However, my fears became reality when my little sister, too, started to see the glitchy apparitions. She would wake up in the middle of the night, screaming in terror, describing haunting visions of the Family Void tormenting her dreams.

Our parents noticed the sudden change in my sister's behavior, her once cheerful demeanor now replaced by fear and anxiety. They did their best to console her, but deep down, they could sense that something was terribly wrong. They had no idea about the glitch version and the nightmarish experiences that had followed me since that stormy night years ago.

As if my troubles weren't enough, my friends began to report strange encounters with someone who looked like me but behaved oddly. They described "me" showing up in places where I hadn't been, acting out of character and staring at them with an unsettling grin. The glitch version seemed to be trying to infiltrate every aspect of my life, leaving me in constant fear of what it might do next.

Feeling overwhelmed, I confided in my closest friend, Emma, about the glitch version and the terrifying visions. To my surprise, she admitted that she, too, had seen the glitchy version of me around her, always watching from a distance with those eerie, glitchy eyes. It appeared that the Family Void was spreading, infecting the lives of those I cared about most.

Desperate for answers, Emma and I started researching the supernatural and paranormal, hoping to find a solution to banish the glitch version once and for all. We stumbled upon an ancient legend that spoke of a forgotten ritual—a ritual that could potentially sever the connection between our world and the glitchy nightmare realm.

With hope and determination, we gathered the necessary materials and performed the ritual at the cursed house where it all began. We chanted incantations, burned sage, and purified the space, hoping to break free from the clutches of the Family Void.

In the midst of the ritual, as the air crackled with energy, I felt a sudden sense of peace. The glitch version of myself appeared one last time, its glitchy form writhing in agony. With a final burst of light, it disintegrated into nothingness, and the haunting visions finally ceased.

It seemed that our efforts had succeeded, and the glitch version was banished. However, we knew that we couldn't let our guard down completely. The Family Void was a powerful and malevolent force, and it might find another way to return.

Though the nightmare was over, I still carry the memories of that glitchy horror with me. I've learned to cope with the fear, knowing that I have friends and family who understand and support me. We share an unspoken bond, a shared experience of a glitch in reality that tried to tear us apart.

The Family Void might be gone for now, but I can't help but wonder if there are others out there who have faced or will face similar glitches in their lives. I hope that, if they do, they find the strength to confront their fears, seek help from those they trust, and banish the glitch before it consumes them completely.
