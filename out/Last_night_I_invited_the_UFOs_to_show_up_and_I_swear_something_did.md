Yeah, okay, this is going to sound crazy. I know how this looks. But I need to get this out there, because I can’t shake what happened, and I want to see if anyone else has done what I did. Or if you’re about to.

So last night, after way too much doomscrolling and one of those memes about “raising the planet’s vibe so the star fam can decloak,” I did something unironically stupid: I decided to actually invite them. Like, out loud. Not as a joke. Not for attention. Just… because. Call it desperation, boredom, whatever. Maybe it was loneliness, maybe it was the feeling that things are building toward something and nobody’s saying it out loud.

It was late. I stepped outside, stood on the shitty little balcony in my apartment complex, and looked up at the sky that never shows stars because the city is always glowing. I felt ridiculous, but I just said it anyway. “If anyone is out there, if any of this is real—aliens, UAPs, star families, watchers, whatever—just come through. Show up. No more games. I want to see you. I’m done pretending.”

Right after I said it, I felt like the whole world paused for a breath. You know that feeling when the air pressure changes before a storm? Like that, but even the traffic went quiet. I thought I was being dramatic. Then, at the far end of the parking lot, the air shimmered. Not a light, not a craft, just this weird bend—like reality had a glitch and forgot to fix it.

My phone buzzed in my hand. Dead screen. No notifications, just… nothing. I got this sharp static-y feeling in my head, like I was catching a stray thought that wasn’t mine. Not a voice, but not my usual brain noise. Just a crystal clear “We’re here. We’re just waiting for you to stop lying to yourself.”

Suddenly I felt seen, like every secret I’ve kept was being played back to me. I wasn’t even scared, just totally exposed. I stood there staring, barely breathing, waiting for something huge to happen, but nothing did. The city noise slowly faded back in. The shimmer in the air was gone. For a minute I wondered if I’d just lost it.

But this morning, I woke up to a photo on my phone from a number that doesn’t exist—literally, my phone says “Unknown, No Caller ID.” It’s a picture of a city skyline that looks almost like mine, but the stars are in all the wrong places. It creeps me out every time I look at it. I’ve shown two people, and both got so uncomfortable they just told me to drop it.

Now I keep thinking about what that static thought said. What if all these stories are true, but the only thing stopping them from “disclosing” is us acting like we don’t actually want it? What if they’re waiting for us to mean it?

So I’m putting this here, mostly because I want to see who else is feeling this. Who else has tried just asking, seriously, no filter? Have you had anything weird happen, even if you think it’s just your mind messing with you? Or does anyone else get that “almost there” feeling, like reality is a locked door and we’re all holding the key but nobody wants to turn it?

If you’re reading this at 3am and you feel like something’s off, try it. Say it out loud. See what happens. Just… be careful. I don’t know what I invited. But I’m not alone, and maybe you aren’t either.

Let me know if anything answers.
