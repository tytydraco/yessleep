Hello. As the title suggests, I'm an amateur astronomer. The telescope is a pretty good one, too, and it's not too broken, but that's not the issue. 

If it matters, you all can call me Tobias. I work as a welding inspector. Ever since I got certified, I just walk around and look at other people's welds, people with years of experience who never make mistakes, and I tell them whether their welds are good. Even outside work, I still end up busy with other hobbies and friend groups, but I love to go out and stargaze when the conditions are right. 

It was a Saturday. It took me about an hour and a half to drive out into Black Rock, a desert in Nevada, but it didn't take me too long to get set up after that. With my lawn chair, a 12-pack, and a mattress in the back of my van waiting for me, it felt like it was gonna be a good night. I guess it was, depending on who you ask. 

I'd been at it for a couple hours now and was pretty buzzed already. I'd checked out Saturn for a while, but then I moved on to trying to find WASP-12b, an exoplanet I'd read up on. But I came across a planet I hadn't seen before. It must've been a water world because it was mostly blue. However, there were parts of red streaking through, but across the red were little odd purple splotches. It reminded me of Earth, but I figured the purple areas were just some portion of some purple rock or metal abundant on that planet. It wasn't a rogue planet either, it WAS revolving around a star.

I left my laptop in the car, I only brought it along in case someone called me for a work emergency involving emails, but I figured I'd just look this up later, so I just started trying to focus on it. But something was wrong. No matter how I fine-tuned my scope, the edges wouldn't stop wavering. 

It's a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. I'm not an astrophysicist or whatever, but it's not too hard to grasp. Basically, massive objects bend light, but here, something else was bending it. I was excited for a moment, but then I remembered I hadn't seen anything beside it when I zoomed in. It was in orbit, but its star wasn't large or close enough to be causing this. I started fine-tuning to get to the center of whatever was causing the disruption, but nothing was there, and it was moving. I could tell by the way the light was bending even farther; whatever was there, whatever I couldn't see, it was moving.

I ran my fingers over to the infrared button. Maybe there was some leftover mass from a star or something? Maybe it was some super-powerful solar flare? I had no idea and had few options, so I clicked it on.

Where there should have been nothing, there was now form. Where the space should have been empty, I could now see the mass, and it was moving. It was writhing. Through the infrared lens, I could see it was impossibly long; it was longer than the planet I'd found at least three times over. 

Its body was like an eel's. Its movements were thin and ribbon-like, and its head was like some horrifying mix between a snake and an eel with crab eyes to boot. Its massive jaw was a screen of thousands of long, thin fangs.

I didn't know what to do. I mean, it was literally lightyears away, but it was still horrifying. I just watched it inching, or I guess hundreds of mileing, towards the planet second by second. But then, even though nothing should be able to move that fast, let alone anything organic, it got right up to the world.

Its jaw unhinged to a terrifying length, almost as tall as the planet itself. It got within range and clamped down. It would have been beautiful if it wasn't under such dire circumstances. The front of the planet was being shredded apart. Gases, liquids, rock, and magma were flying and swirling around its jaw in such a spectacular fashion. What's worse, and what sickened me, was that once it had a good hold, a pharyngeal jaw shot out from its throat and latched on somewhere in the middle of the planet. Look up what that is; it's pretty freaky looking. Just for some added context, the Earth's core is somewhere around 7500 degrees Fahrenheit at its coldest and 10000 degrees Fahrenheit at its hottest. How can anything organic possibly withstand that?

I held off on describing the thing in the context of an infrared lens. If you don't know when something is cooler, it has a cooler color, blue, and when something is hotter, it has a hotter color, red. Basically, everything gives off infrared radiation, even ice, not just warm substances, so since we have technology that can detect and transcribe radiation, we can turn these varying levels of infrared energy into a picture, even when there's not enough light to see it.

Before all of this, the eel was very cold. I don't just mean like light blue and dark blue either, I mean like mostly dark purple with lighter purple patterns throughout. These patterns were beautiful fractals that depress me because I can't possibly draw them out to show you all. As the destruction was unfolding, all of this eerily accompanied by the quiet winds of the desert, its color changed. I saw the dark purple fade away as bright red spread throughout the body. I tried switching off from infrared light, and the mess it had left in its wake was a sight to behold, but, again, it wasn't there. I turned it back on. When it was all over, as its jaws were receding, the eel had become crimson, and these fractals were now pure white. Its eyes never changed from black, however.

I got up and rushed into the back of my van with the rest of my equipment. If I want to take pictures, then I need to attach a storage drive with the right software to the telescope, but normally, I can just find something pretty and then get my stuff in no hurry because most things don't move like that in space. I got it all out and fired it up, but as I was plugging it into my scope and looking back through, I paused. It had moved. 

With a sea of rock and gas behind it, the empyreanless reptile had turned and was looking straight at me, and it had gotten closer. I was looking directly into its face, and it was as though it were looking back at me now. I watched it get closer, and the lens exploded. 

I mean, the final lens in the scope literally just exploded in all directions, and I couldn't see anything anymore. I didn't even manage to get any pictures. After figuring out what happened, I remember coming off my excited haze; I was so tense, I'd seen something impossible, and I was alone in the desert at night. 

I quickly packed up everything and removed as much glass dust as possible from my scope. After I got everything put up, I got over my nerves a bit. I just sat out there drinking in my lawn chair for the rest of the night, getting drunk and thinking about everything. 

I can't help but repeat how amazing it was. It was terrifying, sure, but the whole scene was beautiful. In the infrared light and out of it, it was beautiful. And I can't help but feel excited in some way at finding something so impossible. Is it coming for us now? I'm not sure. To be honest, I'm not terribly afraid of the idea. Dying with everyone like that doesn't sound like too bad a way to go, but I can't help but wonder; did I send it our way?
