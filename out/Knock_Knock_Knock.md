I hate that tune, the all-familiar rapping of the knocker on the door, because it was always the same person who did it, and the same punishment always followed the melancholic beat. And he was always, always upset.

Now two years since his passing I’m still not free, his passive knocking following me everywhere, I got no severance, I get no rest.

At first, or maybe still, I thought I was losing my mind, very cliche but it was true, I thought that it was a remnant of the pain left within me, scarring my brain as much as my body. A seed planted deep in my subconscious finding its way to the surface now finally blooming.

It started at the funeral, my family tossing the first lumps of dirt onto the casket, the cascading rain of soil mocking me with the sound of my nightmares. ‘Thump, thump…thump’. I tried to pay it little mind but when that beat makes up such a significant portion of your life, it’s hard. I had to leave, I chalked it up to grief but I couldn’t be there any longer.

I had no idea how much this would be playing with me, nor how much I’d stand to lose as a result.

A few months had passed since the funeral and I’d lived in relative ease after the first couple of weeks, when the dread crept its way up my throat every time there was even some slight melody, but I had come to accept it was a part of the grieving process. I was in the kitchen one morning preparing to leave for work when I knocked a plastic tub off of a shelf and felt fear within me like no other as I heard it clamber to the ground, almost impossibly, making that damn beat.

‘Thump’ as it hit the edge of the shelf, ‘thump’ when it caught the edge of the counter, and after a beat, ‘thump’ landing on the ground.

I called in sick that day.

Then again when I had to abandon my car because the radio broke and kept repeating that sound in amongst the static.

And again when I started walking to work and heard the birds chirping, almost in unison, to that same beat.

It was after the next few times that I got fired for my absences, I wish I could care but my life had been over the second he was in my head, the day he died and his legacy was brought back through the dirt.

I tried to take precautions, listening to music whenever I could was my first attempt, but eventually the backing tracks all sounded…the same. Then I cut the music and use noise cancelling headphones, and then my heart rang in my ears with a gut-wrenching rhythm, and even when my heartbeat sped up from the sheer panic, all it did was make me relive every night but faster and more aggressive, as if spitting gasoline on a raging fire. And if I tried populating my day by speaking to people as much as I could, or watching shows all day, soon you run out of things to say and seasons to stream and all I’m left with is the eerie pauses that invites my hell to Earth.

I’ve lived with this for far too long, I’ve done all I can and tried everything I can think of. I’m at my wits end, but I had one… one last idea. A final plea for the bliss of an unburdened mind. I’ve decided to embrace it. I went about my day repeating the knock on every surface, humming it as I went along, I even got a recording and played it on a loop, I leant so far forward into this with the hopes of burning it out of my head, getting so used to it that I forced myself to tune it out forever.

I left it all to play out, even when I went to bed, full volume, I was screaming in raspy chords and smacking the side of my bed to that tune when I heard a pop and everything cut out, my speakers fell silent, and I with them, to take in what happened. I was beginning to piece it together that I’d blown a fuse when I realised I couldn’t hear it anymore. It wasn’t at the front of my mind, I wasn’t in a state of anxiety for the first time in years, and it felt good.

But in my moment of clarity, at my bedroom door it came.

Knock, knock… knock
