I’ve been working part-time at the local movie theater for a year now to earn some extra money while I’m studying. I love movies more than anything and I especially love watching them on the big screen. Though I can’t have that experience in my job, because I’m limited to tearing tickets, selling snacks and sweeping the theater halls, but when I find the time after my shift and on weekends, I take it and I haul my butt into the next best movie, focus my eyes solely on the screen, listen to the thick sound system that pumps the sound effects of an action blockbuster into my eardrums, and enjoy the atmosphere with sweet popcorn and soda, which I obviously get from the kiosk around the corner and not directly in the theater foyer, where they charge six bucks for mush.

However, if there is one thing that bothers me about theaters, it is the moviegoers. Or rather, their urgent need to reach for their mobile phones every chance they get. The mobile phone has now become an everyday commodity that you can’t put down. Of course, I count myself among them. I would find it difficult to live without my phone in this day and age. But I wonder what moves people to disrupt their own cinema experience by taking out their phones, taking pictures, browsing the internet or, in the worst case, making a phone call. And on top of that, they ruin the experience of other visitors who only want the movie screen as their only light source for three hours, tops.

The reason I’m so fixed on talking about this quirk of the average moviegoer is because I only recently realized that I’m apparently not the only one who is so frustrated by it.

A few weeks back, I went to the theater for the first time with my girlfriend, Mina, after having only seen films on streaming platforms with her. She wasn't that much into movies, let alone going to the movies. She was more of a binge-watching person and watched sitcoms and things like Gossip Girl on a daily basis. I had no problem with that, but I still wanted to involve her in a real cinema experience so that she could see why I enjoyed the job so much and why I had set up a Letterboxd account in the first place.

Mina finally gave in, and we both went to see the latest horror film. It was Sunday and the theater wasn't all too busy since we arrived in the afternoon, but I thought that was all the better as I could expect fewer bright phone screens to annoy me.

When the movie finally started, everything went well so far. The movie was fine, and Mina seemed to be interested, judging her eyes that were fixed on the screen. I was happy about that and put my arm around her as I shoveled popcorn into my mouth and picked crumbs from my teeth with my tongue. 

After a while I was so engrossed in the movie that I only noticed the bright light next to me later. Mina was texting on her cell phone. Her screen brightness wasn't even turned down. I couldn’t believe it. You too?

Some visitors behind us wrinkled their noses in annoyance and an elderly man in our row gave us reproachful looks. I was extremely embarrassed.

I whispered to Mina to put the damn phone away and, luckily, she did as told and concentrated on the movie again.

I thought I could enjoy the rest of the film without any further interruptions, but barely five minutes had passed when the next crisis began. 

Mina kept turning around and making shushing noises, as if the people behind her were talking loudly. I turned around too, but the visitors were completely silent, but also just as perplexed as I was. Suddenly Mina flinched, as if she had been frightened by something. The film hadn't been a real shocker so far, and there was no reason for her to have been frightened by it.

"Stop, what's going on?" she whispered, looking in all directions. 

"What's the matter?" I asked, also whispering.

"Tell those idiots to stop staring at me like that."

I looked in the direction she meant, but all I saw was the elderly man in our row, a few young people in front of us, and the visitors behind us. They were all fixated on the screen. 

"Nobody is staring at you," I said vehemently, but Mina continued to act as if she was being harassed with looks.

I wasn't sure if she was just fooling around or if she was having a psychotic episode, but if the latter was the case, I’d never seen anything like it before. As far as I knew, she had no history of mental disorders. But I’d only known her for a few months, too. 

Meanwhile, the other moviegoers were also noticing her and were making shushing noises and complaining verbally.

"They have to stop looking at me like that, please do something, Andy!" She started to whimper. It was disturbing to watch. 

I decided that the film wasn't worth it anyway and walked out of the auditorium with her. The young people in front of us applauded maliciously. "Show your girl Wicked instead! No diapers needed!"

When we reached the exit, Mina immediately rushed to the women's restroom and barricaded herself there for a few minutes. I waited and kept wondering what had gotten into her. I’d never seen such a behavior from her. She always tried to avoid strong emotions in public.

Finally, she came out of the restroom, and I took her in my arms and gently stroked her back. She seemed to have calmed down.

"Don't ever send me back there," she whispered hoarsely. 

"I won't. The movie was a flop anyway."

"No, don't ever bring me back here, ever," she backed up.

I nodded, even though I didn't understand it. Whatever was going on, it had to come from herself. I, myself, and the other moviegoers didn’t see anything that she thought she had seen. But I kept my promise and never took her to the movies again.

The next day, before my shift, I called Mina and asked her how she was doing. She said she was feeling better after sleeping and took the day off. I recommended that she watch her show again to clear her head and she gratefully accepted the offer.

After that, I came to my shift and joined my colleague and friend Albert to clear an auditorium and sweep the leftover popcorn off the seats and floors.

"How was the film yesterday?" Albert asked, amused. "I heard it made a huge loss. I bet there was hardly anyone here except you and Mina."

"It definitely wasn't a Cronenberg, but it wasn't necessarily a flop like Alone in the Dark. I don't know, I didn't even see the ending."

"You didn't see the ending?" Albert asked, surprised. “You of all people are leaving the theater early?”

I laughed slightly to tone down my incoming answer. “There was something wrong with Mina. She really wanted to get out. I don’t know if it was the movie or if she has some problem she doesn’t want to talk about, but I guess it’s the movie. She isn’t that into horror.”

Albert sat up straight. His expression was suddenly serious. “What exactly did she do that made her want to get out?” 

“I don’t know. It was as if she felt like she was being stared at. But there was hardly anything going on in the hall. I would’ve noticed.”

Albert remained serious. “Was she using her cell phone?”

I also stopped sweeping and stared at Albert attentively. I nodded.

“Dude, why didn’t you make it clear to her that she should turn it off? It’s just a push of a button.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, perplexed.

“We don’t have that sign over there for nothing.” He pointed to the door to the auditorium, where the well-known *PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONE DURING THE FILM SCREENING* was written. “They even make these announcements during the commercials.”

“Albert, almost everyone ignores this rule.”

“But almost everyone should know by now what happens to you if you take out your phone during a movie screening.”

I was gradually getting fed up with this game and demanded clarification from him. Then he started to talk. 

"I don't know when or where it started, and I only know most of it from Reddit forums, but people who take out their phones during a movie screening are said to notice things that no one else notices. It always starts with a voice whispering something to them. It's supposed to be some random voice, but I've read that some people heard the voices of their parents or even the actors from the movie they were watching at the time. In any case, the whispering is said to turn into staring faces. Here, too, there are different experiences. Most people only saw the evil-looking faces of the moviegoers. The look is said to be unpleasantly horrific. Someone even compared the look to that of Tommy Wiseau from the infamous The Room poster. But others also saw more than just the moviegoers’ faces. They even saw the actors from the movie, family members or just random strangers. All the faces only disappeared when you left the auditorium. But the horror didn't end there. In fact, every time most victims sit down in front of a screen, be it a theater screen, the television or even just their mobile phone, the faces appear again and steal their attention. And the more often you sit in front of the screen, the more diabolical the faces are said to be. They make ugly faces, blood drips from their eyes and spits from their mouths. Their faces become more and more distorted, and their voices get louder and say scary things. I got the willies just reading it."

I was now sitting in one of the seats, listening intently, work completely neglected. I liked Albert and enjoyed working alongside him. And I liked horror stories as much as the next guy, but I just couldn't understand how he could believe such nonsense. At least that was my first reaction. Maybe it was the way he told the facts. As if I was a little kid who didn't want to sleep, and he was telling me the story to scare me.

"I’m going to look into it myself," I eventually said, not trying to sound incredulous.

"Take care of Mina, man," he said in conclusion. We finished our work, this time in a hurry because the next screening was about to start. We didn't say one word to each other. 

I decided to skip work today and visit Mina. I was still a little upset about the things Albert had told me and wanted to be more certain. I thought Mina would know better.

When I reached her apartment door, I noticed that it was open. I called out to her and waited for an answer that never came. I entered and carefully moved towards her room. She shared this apartment with her roommate Anna, who must’ve been at work at the time. 

I eventually stopped, the sight of her room sending me into a state of mild shock. It was a total mess. The furniture, her desk and her wardrobe had been knocked over and broken. Slats from her bed frame were lying everywhere. Ripped out. Her chandelier was still hanging by a single cord that was struggling to stay on. Her iPad and iPhone were destroyed and in shards next to a broken blender that was still plugged in. But what worried me the most were the walls. Holes had been smashed here and there. Red stains were spreading around some of the holes. Scratch marks had been left on almost every corner, also covered in blood. Next to them were blood-red and smudged handprints.

I suddenly heard a thud coming from the living room. I carefully walked in the direction of the sound of chairs clattering and stomping, bracing myself for the worst.

The living room looked undamaged, apart from the huge flat screen TV, which was now just a huge pile of broken glass, and a ceiling lamp that had been torn down and had a long rope hanging from its bracket. 

Mina came out of the corner and the sight of her made me cry. Her beautiful dark blonde hair had been ripped out and crumpled in several places. Her eyes were black with soaked mascara. She was only wearing an oversized shirt that was stained with blood. Her hands were massacred from the chaos she’d made in her room. I could hardly see any nails. 

She stared at me but didn't say a word. I couldn't read her expression. It seemed as if she’d been crying, but now she seemed relaxed and almost relieved. 

She pushed me aside and dragged a chair into the middle of the room. It wasn't until she stood on it that the penny dropped for me.

“Please don’t do that!” I ran towards her and held her tight.

“But that’s the only way I won’t hear them anymore,” she said in a whisper. It no longer sounded like a deliberate whisper, but more like a croak caused by damaged vocal cords. 

“Why didn’t you call me, I would’ve been here sooner?” I moaned. 

I heard quiet sobs from above. “I wanted to. I really wanted to.”

I looked up and saw her distorted face, her bright red eyes, which were so drained of tears that she could hardly produce any more tears. 

“I’m here now,” I said gently. “I’ll help you, I promise.” 

She shook her head.

“Just give me time.”

She didn’t say anything, but I managed to get her down from the chair. I didn’t let go of her hand while I called 911. 

I tried to explain what’d happened to the physicians carefully and with a reasonable-sounding story. I'd rather not share that, because I find the story itself just laughable, but the physicians were convinced enough to put Mina in a protective unit so she couldn't hurt herself anymore. 

It's been two weeks since the whole thing and I've been trying to reach Mina since she was admitted. I know she couldn't answer the phone herself, but the facility couldn't get around to calling me back. What if something bad had happened? What if they put her in front of a screen and gave her the Clockwork Orange treatment. And she certainly couldn't explain what was wrong with her.

Yesterday I was at work and made one call after another, but it always went to voicemail. Albert assured me that Mina was in good hands. 

He and I had made it our mission to take the cell phone policy more seriously. Before entering, we explained to every visitor that their cell phone had to be turned off and that they had to leave the auditorium in case of an emergency. We explained that it was due to poor lighting and signal interference. It was particularly difficult to explain the situation to young people and small children. In the worst case, we took turns standing in front of the door and watching the visitors with a keen eye.

As I took my position, I looked out into the crowd and flinched at every little movement, but it seemed that most people took the warning to heart. If only I’d known about this curse beforehand, I could have warned Mina too.

Speaking of Mina, while I was at my position, I finally received my long-awaited call, and I quickly answered it as some moviegoers noticed it. An employee from the institution assured me that Mina was fine and that she would be able to receive visitors in a few days. I hung up, relieved.

Immediately afterwards, however, I heard the employee's voice again, only in a whisper. I turned around, but there was only the closed door. I turned back to the theater and froze when I saw the venomous looks of the visitors directed at me.
