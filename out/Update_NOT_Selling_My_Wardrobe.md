I can't find my original post, so I'm updating you guys here. Those of you who have reached out to me about my wardrobe, I'm sorry. I can't in good conscious let anyone else have this. I hope this explains why.

\--

I found the wardrobe in a local thrift shop. It was decently sized with two large doors and made from dark wood. The wardrobe was large — around 7 feet tall.  It was on sale for super cheap. I initially thought it was a steal for such a quality piece of furniture. I was able to put the seats down in my car and get it home after securing the massive thing with a few bungee cords and some cursing. Tears may have been shed, but we both made it home safely. My roommates were able to help me carry it upstairs to our apartment before they left for winter break. 

My town’s commerce relies heavily on the college students who flood the city every semester, so most of the town shuts down when students leave for breaks or holidays. The city becomes a ghost town. The holidays were never a great time for my family. I was all too happy to use my course load as an excuse not to go home. I preferred how quiet the town became during these times. 

Hearing the creak of the wardrobe door felt like having ice-cold water wash through my body. The hairs on my neck rose. I whipped around towards the sound. I drew in quick, panicked breaths. I scanned the wardrobe for movement. I squinted but couldn’t see anything past the barely open lip of the dark, wooden doors. I reached for my phone and flipped on the flashlight. I couldn’t see anything. The darkness inside the wardrobe seemed to swallow my light whole. As if there were a dark current blocking my view inside. I haven’t even had the chance to put anything inside it. I had no clue what could be waiting for me. 

I fumbled with my phone as I took a step closer. I had 911 already pulled up just in case I needed to act. The light from my phone shook and trembled with my hands. I strained my ears to listen for breathing or any other sign of life. I could hear nothing. 

Throwing open the doors, I was even more confused and surprised to see no one was inside the wardrobe. I started to laugh in relief as the mix of fear and anxiety started to fade away. I suddenly felt like I was overreacting. I must have been jumpy from being alone for the first time in my apartment since the start of the semester. 

I turned my back only to hear the sound again. I turned back slower this time, convinced the wardrobe was just old and the doors hadn’t latched correctly. My mouth went dry at the site of fingers creeping out of the opening of the wardrobe. 

I flew back, hitting my head on a shelf. I hissed in pain and dropped to the ground. I rubbed at the back of my head and peeked over my bed to see the figure had moved once more. Wide, bloodshot eyes peered out at me from the shadows of the wardrobe. The fingers had crept further out the door, almost caressing the mental door handles. Dirt crusted under yellowing fingernails. I couldn’t understand how a person could be hiding inside when I had just checked that it was empty. 

The figure didn’t move as I gazed at it. I was too afraid to look away as I scrambled on the floor for my phone. I had dropped it in my initial panic at seeing the figure. I tried to call 911, but my phone would drop the call every time like I was passing through a mountain tunnel. 

“Who are you?” I shouted. 

The question was dumb and said strictly out of fear, but I couldn’t stop it from tumbling from my mouth. 

No response. 

“I-I’m calling the police,” I said quieter now, my voice shaking with fear.

Still, there was no response. I still could hear no breathing coming from inside the wardrobe. Its chest and shoulders did not move like it didn’t need to breathe at all. The figure did not blink as it continued to watch me. It wasn’t physically possible to be staring so long and not blinking, could it? 

Could I be hallucinating? There’s a carbon monoxide detector inside the apartment, but it wasn’t going off. I could hear nothing but my ragged breathing. Not taking my eyes off the figure, I lifted my phone once more to pull up the camera. I started to record to see if the figure also showed up on camera. If it didn’t, then I knew the figure wasn’t really there. 

I looked through the lens and felt my stomach drop. The figure still sat staring at me from inside the wardrobe on my phone camera. I swallowed against the lump in my throat as I saw this. I didn’t understand if a person was hiding inside the wardrobe to rob me or worse. Why was it not moving? It has had ample opportunity to strike, and yet it does not move as I gaze at it. Were they playing a game with me?

With my phone still recording the figure, I glanced over to my desk in the corner of the room. My computer was still there, as were my other electronics. None were touched. The figure was not here to steal anything. I didn’t understand if a person was hiding inside the wardrobe to rob me or worse; why was it not moving? It’s had ample opportunity to strike and yet it does not move as I gaze at it. 

It just looked back at me.

An idea sparked to life inside my head. I took slow and cautious steps, trying to press myself past the wardrobe to my bedroom door. My body tingled with fear as I had to get closer to the wardrobe to pass it. The figure did not move, but its wide, dark eyes continued to follow me. Only watching. I kept my eyes on it as I backed out slowly from my room. I closed the door and counted to five inside my head. 

*One.* 

*Two.*

I pressed my ear to the door to listen, but still nothing.

*Three.* 

No creaking, no sounds, as if nothing was in the room with me.

*Four.* 

*Five.* 

With a shaky breath, I opened the door and peeked inside. I could only see its fingers curling out from the dark with a hint of the nose and forehead. The figure hadn’t moved, but my stomach lurched once more at seeing it still inside my wardrobe. I was hoping I’d open the door and there would be nothing there. That it all was a part of my imagination. Unfortunately, that was not the case. 

Gathering my courage, I acted on my hunch. I slowly closed the door once more. I spun around and raced down the hallway, my blood roaring in my ears. I knocked things over as I scrambled over my roommate’s room looking for his camera. I was extremely lucky he was taking photography classes. 

I banged open my bedroom door, uncaring about making any noise now. The figure sat still and quiet in the same position. Its eyes followed me as I set up the tripod and camera. Hitting the record button, I stepped back and grabbed my phone. Keeping my eyes on it, I once again closed the door. I counted again and opened the door. No movement. Relief flooded my body once more, causing me to laugh again. This time it had a maniacal edge to it. My hunch had been right. The figure only moved when I looked away. I was lucky that recording devices seemed to act as a kind of stand-in for eyes. Feeling comforted at the moment, I closed the door once again and made my way to the living room. 

I didn’t know if I should call the police or one of my roommates. I didn’t know what to say; that some human-like creature that didn’t move unless you looked away was hiding in my wardrobe. How insane was that? I tried to watch the recording on my phone but it was just a black screen. I strained my ears but heard nothing except me opening the door, running down the hallway, and then ending the recording. I stared dumbfounded at the blank screen, my haggard reflection looking back at me. What was I supposed to do? 

I started by taking a kitchen chair and shoving it under my door handle. This hopefully should keep whatever it was inside my room if it managed to get out. It didn’t feel like enough. I moved more furniture to block the door. Because of the apartment layout, there were two bedrooms on each side with a shared bathroom area. I couldn’t stomach sleeping out in the open in the living room, so I took some pillows and blankets from the living room and made a pallet in the bathtub on the other side of the apartment. I felt safer with another locked door between me and the figure. 

I lay in the tub for a long time, thinking about what I should do. I needed to get rid of the wardrobe. The thrift store I had bought it from had a no-return policy -- all sales are final. Luckily, I had taken some pictures of the wardrobe at the thrift store and inside my room before the figure appeared. I posted it on Facebook Marketplace and here on Reddit. I got some responses back. I took this post down later that night because I couldn’t stomach the thought of someone else going through this. What could I say to convince them to take the wardrobe with that thing inside of it? The recordings I have don’t show anything. When I tried to upload them anyway, my phone overheated and shut off. 

I started to chat with a few people online as I couldn’t fall asleep. I made the wardrobe free for pickup because I couldn’t physically move it by myself, and I wanted to get rid of it as fast as possible. However, the more I thought about it, the more I couldn’t stomach the idea of someone else having it. Whatever that thing was inside the wardrobe, I did not believe it was human. No human could be so still or quiet for so long without some kind of movement. It wasn’t physically possible. I felt more sure of that fact as I checked on the figure one more time. It sat in the same position. I made my way inside and set up my phone to record before I turned the camera off. I checked the footage and was disappointed but not surprised to see nothing there. The whole storage was full of empty, black videos, all unsettling quiet. I deleted the footage and set the camera back up. Bloodshot eyes continued to follow my movements. I felt like I was going to throw up and decided that I wasn’t going to sell it. I’m just getting rid of it completely. I called the city garbage for a special trash removal for the wardrobe. The truck came noisily down around around 6:00 AM. Two men stepped out of the truck, and I met them outside. I decided to throw an old sheet over the wardrobe. I didn’t want to know if they couldn’t see it, but more than that I was too afraid that they would see it. I didn’t want to think about the possibility that it was real. 

I watched it as the truck left. The white sheet fluttered ominously around the wardrobe before it slipped off, revealing the figure once more. It grew smaller and darker as it disappeared around the corner, still staring. I stood at my window for a long time still watching, afraid to stop. Nothing happened and I found myself suddenly feeling embarrassed. I felt confused and kinda silly as the two men who came to take the wardrobe hadn’t said anything at all. They glanced at the camera in the middle of the room and gave me a funny look, but said nothing. They didn’t ask questions as they removed the wardrobe from my apartment. Still, a sinking feeling grew heavy in my stomach throughout the day. I couldn’t shake the feeling. My eyes keep darting to dark corners and open doors. I’m afraid the figure will be there. I’ve been glancing over my shoulder all day. 

I’m in bed now, lying in the dark. A small, yellow glow emits from the street light outside. It’s quiet, but I’m struggling to sleep. The hair on the back of my neck began to rise as goosebumps broke out across my body. I could feel someone watching me. My eyes darted towards my bedroom door, but I saw nothing. It was closed tight and locked for good measure. 

Slowly, I saw fingers begin to dance along the edge of my window seal. They cast eerie shadows across my bedroom floor as hands formed, gripping tightly onto the window. A gasp tore from my throat as I twisted around in my bed. Dirty fingers gripped the window seal, but they weren’t moving now. I now understand that feeling that has been growing inside me all day. It was pure terror as I understood now I was being hunted. The subconscious need to flee as I sensed a predator lurking in the shadows. Even though the garbage men hadn’t seen the figure, once it had disappeared from my view, I wasn’t watching it anymore. 

I was tearing up before I understood what was happening. Each blink burned with tears as I desperately tried to keep my eyes open. 

With each unwilling blink, the figure opened my window and crept inside.
