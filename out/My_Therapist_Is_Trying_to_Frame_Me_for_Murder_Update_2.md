Jeremy, my therapist, he was acting even weirder than normal yesterday. If it had anything to do with Pete’s murder he didn’t let on. He is really good at that stuff. He likes messing with people’s heads. And now he has decided to mess with my life.



I will not go down like this.



Now I’m home, about to go for a jog. I need to keep my routine to not raise any suspicions. Maybe I’ll remember something too, taking the same route as yesterday. Let me lock the door.



I should think about this while running. Jeremy is definitely a psychopath. He always tells me to do things that I know are making my life worse. Let me explain. My life was fine. I did not need to see a therapist. But this one book I was creating a marketing campaign for, it was all about the necessity of therapists and that everyone needs one to become the awesome person they are destined to be.



Something like that. Whatever. I bought it. I went to see a therapist. Then after every session with Jeremy I started second-guessing every decision I had made at work that day. I never did that before. I am good at what I do. I’ve got the bonuses to prove it. Oh, and guess who recommended that therapist to me.



Yes, Pete. No wonder that man was so negative the past few months. Jeremy must have poisoned his mind. Or maybe…could they have been working together to ruin my life?



During our session yesterday, I started thinking Jeremy could be a serial killer. He started talking about murderers after I told him about the book marketing campaign I’m working on. The book is about sugar candy. Seriously. How do you go from candy to murder?



He would just not shut up about it. He analyzed three different cases of serial killers in grim detail. I think at some point, when he talked about this one guy who murdered his girlfriend’s ex-boyfriend, he drooled from joy.



Wait a minute. I just got another flash. The park looks so different when it’s not raining. The vegetation is so lush in that one area and the trees so tall with long intertwined branches. There are soft lights placed around strategically. Maybe they were going for a romantic effect but all I get is a creepy vibe.



It is the perfect spot for murder.



Everyone seems to avoid this park. I am alone. My feet crunch underneath the dirt. My body moves at its own will. Is that it? Yes. I had to dig around a bit but over here, in this dark corner of the park, hidden among the thick bushes, I see it. A manhole cover.



Down here. This is where I hid Pete.



I should leave before anyone sees me.



Come to think of it, you know what was even weirder that night? The weather. It only rained at the park. Even the road just outside the park area was dry. At least I don’t see any footprints on the pavement outside the park. It was raining so much when it happened, I must have left some solid, muddy footprints for anyone to find as I jogged back home.



But no. Nothing. As if I was never here. It’s weird, isn’t it? It’s not like Jeremy or Pete can control the weather. And it’s not like this has happened before. Not in the five years I’ve been living in this neighborhood. I don’t think so anyway.



They’ll never find Pete down there, right? I’ll just have to wait and see if anyone comes looking for him at work tomorrow.



Oh, and start stalking Jeremy. If my suspicions are correct, he will strike again. I need to be there to record anything I can to use as evidence if the police ever come knocking at my door.
