“Chapter 1: The Harvest”

Intrigued with the title of the first page of a diary I found near a dumpster, I stashed it inside my pack where I carried the lost belongings of the ones whose bodies have passed onto the next life.

The world, a husk of its former self with cars left on the streets, litter waiting to be cleaned up, and the buildings that were thought to be bustling with people who had everyday jobs. The weather has already been frigid as the people who have succumbed to the harvest went away before winter.

One thing that was never clear were the heavy metal platings blocking the already metal sewer hatches, though it was already corroding, what was it hiding beneath? We may never know, and while I walk the air grows colder, maybe a shelter would do.

….

As I went inside an abandoned apartment complex I took off my balaclava and mask and set it aside near the desk with a small light bulb still running, while the world was still a wasteland there are still people who are working in power grids and nuclear sites, two important needs us survivors of the harvest need.

I open my pack and while I did I was intrigued again by the dusty diary I picked off near a dumpster, I opened and read it.

“Chapter 1: The Harvest

I am Sam Hunch, the owner of the local bakery Hunch’s. Lately the streets have been loud, cars crashing on eachother, people screaming, scrambling, scared. I was never scared, I was worried but never afraid.

I opened the TV to discover that sixty percent of the population have gone missing over the past few days, which would explain the chaos that is outside my shop window. I'm glad no one is taking the bread, it’s all for myself now, it’ll last me a couple of days before mold starts setting in.

My family is worried, but I told them that I'm fine and as long as I stay in my bakery, I won't get harvested myself.”

The chapter ended with a drawing of a loaf of bread with scribbles on the side, I opened a can of soup with a knife, and went on to read more.

“Chapter 2: Disappearance

Both my father and my nephew are gone, I heard the news through the telephone with my mom before it was shortly cut when the people outside chopped off the telephone poles. I heard screams, louder than yesterday, but I heard a far more distorted scream.

The scream resembled nothing a human or an animal can ever achieve, it was almost deafening, I had to dampen the noise by sticking newspaper on the shop window and the door. It was like it was crying for help, yet the voices were sinister.

I’m probably going insane at this point, I can call myself weak but I’ll get better once the military does something.”

“Chapter 3: Eyes

It was nothing like I have seen, I took a quick glance from the peeled newspaper on the glass window. The thing, it wasn't from man or nature, it was an amalgamation of flesh and eyes all looking in different directions, and one was looking at me.

I quickly sealed off the window again with the newspaper as the terrible distorted scream came again.

All this made me forget about the important news, all my family is dead, my nephews tried to run and fend for themselves, I heard them this morning but soon came after their screams of agony, the tumor has harvested my nephews, they are dead.”

The doodles at the end showed two boys with crossed out eyes, and the splatters looked similar to blood, this reminded me of my first days of the harvest where I hid in a storage room of a grocery store where I heard people screaming not from fear, but from anger trying to desperately get their hands on the most supplies as they can while pushing and biting each other.

I continued to read the passages.

“Chapter 4: Broadcast from the outside

After days of no information from the government since the first harvesting they finally came up with details of the tumors.

It said that they go on hibernation for 3 months before going back to the sewers where they reside, and the tumors harvest as much as they can, especially ones that stenched of sin, which I find as hypocritical where they’re in their bunkers while Im here stuck in a bakery with nothing but water and a pile of moldy bread in the corner.

The tumors absorbed the people, those screams were the voices of the victims mixed into one horrifying screech of pain. For myself, I've not been doing well, I’m almost out of rations and have lost hope in the military ever reaching me or anyone in this wasteland we once called home.

I might have to face the outside world tomorrow.”

The news shown in this diary was never brought up to me or anyone I knew from before, it surprised me with information that helped me with my survival, it also explains how it feels safe outside even with the winter approaching and the damaged environment all around.

I'm actually thankful that I found this diary, it has helped me cope with my situation, trying to find a group of people in this wasteland. Winter has started to set and the outside became ill-lit from the clouds and the thick air surrounding the windows. 

The curiosity I had with this diary never stopped, as I saw that there were only two pages left, and from the title it was clear that it's about to end, before resting I went back to reading the last entry.

“Chapter 5: My farewell

I’d never thought that a humble baker like myself would be found in this situation facing off an eldritch horror. I ran for my life as the tumors started screeching, hoping to catch me as I turned around a corner and hid behind a dumpster.

I saw why they never let anyone in the sewers, that’s where they reside while in hibernation. I found a manhole with wooden barricades on them. I was hoping to jump down to avoid the tumors from the surface, that was such a huge mistake. The ladder broke from the corroded hinges and I fell on my back, the echoes went on for miles making me feel that I was alone, I was wrong.

I took out my broken flashlight and walked on the dirty sidewalk, the murky water reflected nothing. The light from my flashlight never showed the whole picture, but I knew I shouldn't be there.

As I stumbled upon large veins from the bottom of my feet, I pointed the light in front, to discover the flesh of a heart, the size of a building.

It was growing a tumor from its side, I knew I had to run.

My steps were drowned out by the distorted screams of the tumor, still not as loud but never humane. I found another ladder leading up to an alleyway, and just before the tumor could get out I closed the manhole and put crates on it but I knew it wouldn't hold out long enough, so I had to run away.

I have already lost sight of my bakery, or the street I once knew, or anyone I knew and loved. I will end this diary and at the same time, myself. To whoever will find this passage, shall this small little diary that started as a coping mechanism, turned out to be the very thing that will save you. 

You can find me inside the dumpster.

Written in Summer, Sam Hunch 1997 - 2028”

To my shock, the author was right beside the diary all the time, the final entry showed dry water drops, almost like tears, and a doodle of him and a building with the sign “Hunch’s” on it.

But I was shaken to my core when I made the revelation. In the third passage it told me that these tumors come out every three months, this was written in summer, it’s winter.

Before I had the time to get out of the apartment complex, I heard the distorted noise of the people who had succumbed to the harvest, I was as stuck as Sam was.
