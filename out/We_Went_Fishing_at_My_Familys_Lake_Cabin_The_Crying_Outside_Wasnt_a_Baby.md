My parents have a cabin on a small lake that doesn’t show up on most maps unless you zoom in way too far.

It’s not fancy. It’s not one of those “cabin” cabins that’s basically a second house with granite counters and Wi-Fi boosters. Ours is a rectangle of old wood with a screened porch, a dock that needs a new board every spring, and a back window that looks straight into black trees.

They don’t rent it. They don’t lend it out. It’s the one family thing they’re protective about.

So when my dad said, “You and your buddy can use it this weekend,” I didn’t ask questions. I said yes before he could change his mind.

My friend Logan and I had been talking about doing a real weekend—beer, fishing, no work, no girlfriends, no phones—like we were still twenty-one and didn’t wake up sore for no reason.

We drove up Friday after work with a cooler wedged between our feet, rods sticking into the back window, and a grocery bag full of stuff that sounded good at the time: chips, beef jerky, hot dogs, and a jar of pickles Logan insisted was “essential lake food.”

The gravel road to the cabin has one sharp turn right before you see the water. Every time I take it, I get that same little hit of relief. The trees open, the lake appears, and everything feels slower.

We pulled in just before sunset.

The cabin looked the same as always. Weathered siding. The porch light with moths already orbiting it. The dock jutting into dark water that held the last strip of orange sky like a ribbon.

Logan whistled. “Dude. This is perfect.”

“Don’t jinx it,” I said, but I was smiling.

We unloaded, cracked the first beers, and did the cabin routine—open windows, check the little propane stove, make sure the water pump actually works, swat the first mosquito that inevitably makes it inside.

By the time it got fully dark, we had a small fire going in the pit near the lake and a line in the water more out of principle than expectation. We talked about nothing important. We laughed too loud. We toasted to “not being dead,” which is a joke people make right up until it isn’t.

Around midnight we put out the fire, locked the front door out of habit more than fear, and went inside.

The cabin has two bedrooms. I took the one with the lake view. Logan took the back room, the one that faces the tree line. Neither of us wanted to admit we didn’t like that room, so we just called it “the quieter one.”

I was half asleep when I heard it the first time.

A soft tapping.

Not on the roof. Not on the side wall. On glass.

Three light taps, like someone testing the window with a fingernail.

Then silence.

I sat up in bed, listening.

The cabin creaks. It’s old. It settles. Wind makes branches move. My brain started lining up explanations because that’s what brains do at 12:40 a.m. when you don’t want to be scared.

Then it came again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

And with it, a sound like chittering—small, quick clicking noises, almost like a squirrel in the walls.

I got out of bed and padded into the hall, bare feet on cold wood. Logan’s door was closed.

I knocked once. “You awake?”

There was a pause, then he opened the door a crack, squinting like I’d insulted him. “What.”

“You hear that?”

He listened. His face stayed blank for a second.

Then the tapping came again, sharper now, followed by that quick chittering sound.

Logan’s eyes narrowed. “What the hell is that.”

“Probably a raccoon messing around,” I said, because it was the most normal answer available.

He opened the door wider. The back window in his room was about ten feet behind him. The curtain moved slightly from the draft.

Tap. Tap.

Logan made a face. “That’s on the window.”

“Maybe it’s a branch,” I said, even though I knew the trees didn’t sit close enough to touch that window. My brain just didn’t want to move to the next option.

Logan shrugged, already over it. “Whatever. If it breaks in, you’re dealing with it.”

I snorted. “Yeah, okay.”

We both stood there for another minute, listening.

The tapping stopped.

The cabin went back to normal cabin noises.

Logan yawned and closed the door. “Night.”

I went back to my room and told myself the same thing I always tell myself when the woods do something weird: it’s probably nothing. You’re just not used to the quiet.

I fell asleep.

The next morning was bright and clear, the kind of morning that makes the night feel stupid. The lake looked calm. Birds were loud. The world was normal again.

Logan was in a good mood, too, like the tapping had never happened.

We made terrible coffee, ate leftover jerky and chips like it was breakfast, and carried our rods down to the dock. We fished for a couple hours and caught exactly one small fish that Logan held up like it was a trophy.

“You wanna go check the trails behind the cabin?” he asked after a while. “There’s gotta be a spot where fish actually exist.”

“Sure,” I said.

We packed a small tackle box, grabbed two more beers “for the hike,” and headed up behind the cabin where the ground rises into trees.

That’s where we found the first drag marks.

They started near a patch of ferns and ran toward the thicker brush, two parallel grooves in the soil like something heavy had been pulled.

Logan crouched and traced them with his finger. “That’s not from us.”

“No,” I said.

There were prints too, but not clear. The ground was dry, packed hard. Just disturbed dirt and pressed leaf litter.

Logan looked around. “Maybe someone dragged a deer? Hunters?”

“This isn’t hunting season,” I said.

We walked another fifty feet and found claw marks on a tree.

Not little scratches. Deep grooves in the bark, vertical, like something raked it while standing up.

Logan stared. “Bear?”

“That’s what I was gonna say,” I told him, because if it was a bear, everything stayed simple. Bears make marks. Bears drag things. Bears tap windows if they’re looking for food. Bears can be dealt with by going inside and not being dumb.

I felt better saying it out loud.

Logan stood and dusted his hands. “Okay. So we don’t leave food out. Done.”

We went back down toward the lake, talking about how we’d store the cooler inside and not on the porch. Normal precautions. Normal logic.

Then, on the way back, we heard a growl.

Low, close, not echoed. Not from across the lake. From the trees behind us.

Both of us stopped at the exact same time.

It wasn’t a dog. It was deeper than that. It sounded like the air itself vibrating.

Logan whispered, “Did you hear that.”

“Yeah,” I said.

We stood still, listening.

Nothing.

No footsteps. No second growl.

Just the lake breeze and the buzz of insects.

Logan let out a short laugh that sounded forced. “Bear. Right?”

“Bear,” I repeated, even though my stomach wasn’t buying it anymore.

We got back to the dock and tried to act normal. We cast lines. We talked about football. We opened another beer. We did everything people do when they’re trying to pretend they aren’t listening.

Then we heard it again.

This time it wasn’t a growl.

It was a sound like a baby crying.

Soft at first, then a little louder, then cutting off abruptly.

Logan’s head snapped toward the tree line. “Nope. No. That’s not—”

The crying happened again, from a different direction, like whatever made it had moved without walking.

I felt my spine tighten. “We’re going back inside.”

Logan didn’t argue. He reeled in fast, line snapping the water.

We grabbed our gear and started up the path to the cabin.

Halfway there, something snapped behind us.

Not a twig. A branch. Thick. Loud.

Logan looked back.

I saw his face change.

Not fear at first—confusion. Like he couldn’t fit what he was seeing into a normal category.

“What,” I said, and turned.

At the edge of the trees, something pale moved between trunks.

Not fur. Not brown or black like a bear. Pale, almost white, but not clean white. More like skin stretched thin over something huge.

It stepped forward, and my brain refused to accept it for a second. It didn’t look like an animal you see in the woods. It looked like something that belonged under water, dragged onto land.

It was bear-shaped in the most basic sense: massive shoulders, heavy front legs, the suggestion of a hunched back.

But the skin was translucent in places. I could see darker shapes beneath it—muscle, veins, something that pulsed when it moved.

And the head…

There wasn’t a normal face.

There was a mouth.

One massive mouth that split the front of its head open too wide, like it had been cut into shape. No snout. No nose. Just that opening lined with thick, uneven teeth that looked strong enough to break bone without trying.

Logan’s voice went thin. “What is that.”

The thing made the baby-cry sound again.

But now I understood it wasn’t a cry. It was a lure. A noise it could throw out like bait.

Then it lunged.

Fast. Shockingly fast for something that big.

“RUN,” I said, and we ran for the cabin.

We made it maybe ten steps before it hit us.

Not a clean tackle. More like a swipe that tore through space.

Something struck Logan from the side. He went down hard, rolling, screaming as he hit the ground.

I spun toward him and saw the creature’s forelimb—thick, pale, with claws that looked like broken glass shoved into flesh.

It snapped its mouth open and the sound it made wasn’t a roar.

It was a wet, ripping inhale, like it was smelling us with its whole head.

Logan tried to crawl backward. “Get it off—get it OFF—”

I grabbed his jacket and yanked, trying to pull him, trying to move him toward the water because the cabin was still too far and my only thought was distance.

The creature swung again.

Pain flashed through my arm like a hammer hit. I didn’t even process what happened until I felt warmth running down my wrist.

I looked.

My hand was shredded. Not fully mangled, but cut deep enough that my grip went slippery.

Logan screamed again, and I saw why.

His left hand—his fingers—something was wrong. He held it up and three fingers looked… shorter. Gone at the tips like someone had taken shears to them.

Blood poured down his palm.

He stared at it like he couldn’t understand it. “My—my—”

“MOVE,” I shouted.

The creature advanced again, mouth opening wider, wider than should be possible. It looked like it could take a person in half. The inside was dark and wet, and the teeth weren’t sharp in a clean way—they were thick, crushing teeth made to tear and clamp.

We ran, but we weren’t running toward the cabin anymore.

We ran toward the lake.

I don’t know why my brain chose water. Maybe because the dock was open space. Maybe because the creature looked like it belonged in the trees and I wanted a boundary. Maybe because everything behind us felt like a trap.

We hit the shoreline, boots sliding in mud, and the creature hit the ground behind us hard enough that I felt it through my feet.

The baby-cry sound came again, louder, and it wasn’t even aimed at us. It was just noise, like it wanted the woods to know we were here.

Logan stumbled at the edge of the water. I grabbed him by the shoulder and shoved him forward.

“In,” I said. “Get in.”

He looked at me like I was insane.

“GET IN,” I yelled again, and he did.

We splashed into the lake, cold water shocking my legs. We waded until it hit our thighs, then our waists. Logan hissed in pain as water hit his hand. He bit down on a sob.

Behind us, the creature stopped at the shoreline.

It didn’t step in.

It lowered its head, mouth opening slightly, and that baby-cry sound turned into something more ragged, almost frustrated. Like it didn’t like water. Like it had rules.

It paced along the edge, huge body shifting, skin catching the sunlight in a way that made it look almost see-through.

Then it did something that made my stomach drop.

It leaned down and pressed its mouth close to the water, teeth nearly touching the surface.

And it breathed.

The water rippled outward in a smooth circle, like something was pushing it from underneath.

Logan whispered, “What is it doing.”

“I don’t know,” I said, honest.

The creature lifted its head and looked straight at us.

There wasn’t expression in the way an animal has expression, but I felt watched like I’d been studied.

Then it made the baby-cry sound again, softer now, almost gentle.

It held it for a few seconds.

And then it stopped.

And the woods were silent.

We stayed in the water until our teeth started chattering. The cold got into our joints. My hand throbbed with every heartbeat. Logan’s breathing was fast and shallow, his injured hand held above the surface like it was a bomb.

Finally, when nothing happened for a long stretch of time, we moved along the shoreline toward the dock, staying in the shallows. We used the dock posts as cover like that mattered.

We reached the dock and climbed up, slipping, shaking, soaked.

The cabin was thirty yards away.

Thirty yards across open ground.

Logan looked at me with panic in his eyes. “We’re not making it.”

“We are,” I said, because we had to.

We went.

We ran for the porch. The baby-cry sound hit again from the trees—closer now, like it had moved while we were in the water.

Then the growl came, low and vibrating.

I didn’t look.

I grabbed the door handle, yanked it open, shoved Logan inside, and followed him, slamming the door hard enough the frame rattled.

We locked it. Deadbolt. Chain. Whatever we had.

Logan collapsed onto the floor, staring at his hand.

“I don’t—” he started, then his voice broke. “I don’t have—”

“I know,” I said. “Don’t look at it right now.”

My own hand hurt so badly my vision pulsed when I moved it. The cuts weren’t clean. They were jagged. Like torn skin. I could already see how many stitches it would take.

We backed away from the door.

And then the tapping started again.

Not at the front.

At the back window.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Then the chittering—fast clicking sounds, like teeth knocking together.

Logan’s head snapped toward his bedroom. “No. No. It’s here.”

We stood in the middle of the cabin, listening, frozen, trying to decide what to do if the glass broke.

The tapping continued, patient.

Then it stopped.

A few seconds passed.

Then a wet sound came from the back wall, like something pressing against wood.

Not scratching. Not clawing. Just… leaning.

Testing.

The entire cabin felt small.

Logan whispered, “Call 911.”

“No service,” I said, but I still pulled my phone out and checked. One bar flickered. Then disappeared.

The baby-cry sound came again, muffled now, right outside the back window.

It was so close it didn’t sound like it was in the woods anymore.

It sounded like it was right on the other side of glass.

Logan covered his mouth with his good hand like he could stop himself from making noise.

I grabbed the only thing within reach that felt like a weapon: the old fireplace poker by the wood stove.

My hands shook so bad it rattled against the floor.

We stood there, waiting for it to come through.

It didn’t.

Instead, we heard it move.

Slow steps around the cabin. Heavy. Pausing. Listening.

Then silence.

Not “it went away” silence.

The kind of silence that happens when something is standing still.

Watching.

Minutes passed like that.

Logan slid down the wall, pale, breathing through his teeth. His hand dripped onto the floorboards in slow, steady drops.

I knew we couldn’t wait all night. We’d bleed out. Or go into shock. Or both. We needed help.

So I did the dumbest thing that sometimes keeps you alive:

I turned the porch light on.

It threw a weak cone of yellow out into the night through the front window.

For a second, we saw nothing.

Then, at the edge of that light, the creature’s skin caught the glow.

A pale shape just beyond the porch steps.

It had been there the whole time.

Standing still enough that the darkness hid it.

The mouth opened slightly, and the teeth glinted.

Logan made a small sound—half sob, half gasp.

The creature didn’t charge.

It just stood there, and the baby-cry sound came again, quieter, almost like it was practicing it.

I backed away from the window, heart hammering. “We’re not leaving.”

Logan nodded fast, tears in his eyes. “We’re not leaving.”

We stayed inside until morning.

Every hour or so, the tapping would start somewhere—back window, side wall, once on the roof like something climbed up there and tested the shingles.

Every time we heard the chittering, it sounded closer, like it was inside the walls.

But it never broke through.

It didn’t need to.

It had us.

At first light, I checked my phone and saw two bars. Enough.

I called 911 with shaking fingers, trying to keep my voice steady while my back teeth chattered.

When the dispatcher answered, I said my first name only, told them we were at a family cabin on a private lake, and that we’d been attacked by something large. I told them Logan was missing fingers and bleeding badly. I told them I needed medical help now.

They asked what attacked us.

I didn’t say “cryptid.” I didn’t say “monster.” I said, “A bear, I think. But it looks sick. Wrong. Please just send someone.”

They sent deputies and an EMT crew. It took them longer than it should’ve because the road is garbage and nobody likes driving it fast.

When they finally arrived, they found us sitting on the porch wrapped in blankets, Logan with a towel tied tight around his hand, me with my own hand clamped in a clean dish towel.

The deputies walked the property with rifles.

They found drag marks.

They found clawed trees.

They found prints near the shoreline that didn’t look like bear tracks to anyone who’d seen a bear track before. Too wide in the wrong places. Too deep. Like whatever made them carried more weight than it should.

They didn’t find the creature.

But while the EMT stitched my hand and bandaged Logan, I watched the tree line across the lake.

And I heard it, once, very faint.

A baby crying.

Soft, steady, far enough away that you could pretend it was something else if you wanted to.

Nobody else reacted.

Maybe nobody else heard it.

Or maybe they did, and they just didn’t want to look at me and confirm it.

Logan lost three fingers down to the second knuckle. They told him surgery might help, but nothing was going to bring them back.

I got twelve stitches across my palm and wrist, and for weeks afterward, when I closed my eyes, I saw that mouth opening wider than it should, like it was made for tearing.

We never went back to that cabin.

My parents asked what happened.

We told them a bear.

It was the only explanation that sounded like something you can recover from.

But I still think about the way it stood at the shoreline, refusing the water like it had learned something the hard way.

And I think about the way it cried like a baby, not because it was hurt, but because it knew exactly what that sound does to people.

It makes you step closer.

And next time, it won’t need to chase.
