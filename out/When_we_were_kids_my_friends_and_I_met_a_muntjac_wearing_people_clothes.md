Growing up, my friends and I spent every possible moment in the woods by our housing estate. It was our adventure zone, and there was no limit to our imaginations.

The gang was Dylan, Jess, and myself, Toby. In the beginning it was just Dylan and I, though Jess approached us in the school playground one day while we were fighting off a large dragon. She wanted to help, but I reminded her that girls play with dolls in Wendy houses.

She took my sword and spun around, cutting off one of the dragon's legs in one swift motion. Dylan and I were awestruck. From then on, our duo became a trio.

We were *'thick as thieves'* as my dad used to say. I had no idea what it meant but I liked it. I'd charge around the woods shouting *"We're thick as thieves!"* before beheading a fantastical creature that was trying to eat us.

The woodland area we played in was the subject of many arguments in my household. My mum said I was too young to be playing down there, what with potential drug users and perverts just waiting to take advantage of children. My dad would tell her she was overreacting and stress the importance of spending time outdoors.

They came to a compromise: I was fine to play down there, but *never* alone. Safety in numbers and all that. I'd already had the stranger danger talk at school. A police officer came in to terrify my class with stories of unfortunate children going missing, all because they spoke to a strange man dressed like a film noir PI. At least according to the booklets they handed out.

Ultimately, no scary police officer talks, or hypothetical scenarios imagined by my mum would help us from what we experienced.

We were ten years old when Jess and I saw Dylan for the last time.

It was late spring, and like any other day off school, we were playing in the woods. Dylan and I hung from adjacent tree branches a few feet from the ground. We were trying to see who could hang on for the longest before letting go. Jess was standing below timing us on her digital Casio watch.

"One minute!" she yelled.

"What?" shouted Dylan, his cheeks turning a little red. "It's gotta be longer than that?"

"Nope," said Jess. "One minute and… seven seconds now."

"Are you thinking about letting go?" I asked with a smile, trying not to give away that my arms were starting to ache. Dylan scrunched up his face.

"No way!" he said, sounding like it was a bit of a struggle. "I'm… not letting go… until you do!"

"We'll be here all day then," I said, grunting a little as I readjusted my grip.

"Guys, do you hear that?" said Jess, looking around.

"Dylan whining?" I said. "Yeah, hard not to."

"Shut up!" shouted Dylan.

Jess started walking away into the foliage.

"Wait!" called Dylan. "How long is it now?"

"It doesn't matter," I said. "You know you'll be down there before me."

Dylan started kicking his legs out towards me. I swung a little and our feet just about touched as we tried to get the other to let go.

"Holy shit!" we heard Jess say from nearby.

"What is it?" asked Dylan. "Another dead animal?"

We'd found a rotting blackbird earlier that was swarming with maggots. It was both disgusting and fascinating.

"You gotta come see this!" she said. Truthfully, I was grateful for the distraction. My arms were killing me! With that, I let go and a brief sting shot through my ankles as my feet met the ground.

"I beat you!" shouted Dylan, sounding happy with himself.

"Doesn't count," I said, walking towards Jess. "The game is paused for investigation."

"No fair!" he said, and I heard him land behind me. He caught up and we joined Jess, who was crouched down amongst some ferns.

"Look," she whispered, pointing to another tree. Then I heard it. It was a deep buzzing sound. There was a small hole in the trunk of the tree, about the diameter of a golf ball. Wasps were flying in and out in vast numbers. It was a nest.

"That's so cool," I said.

"It's not cool," said Dylan. "Those things are evil."

"Yeah," said Jess. "Let's mess with 'em!"

She picked up a nearby stick and slowly started to walk over to the tree.

"Err, Jess," I said. "You know they sting anything that moves, yeah?"

"Don't be a pussy," she said. Dylan and I looked at each other in disbelief, then grabbed sticks of our own and followed.

"So stupid," said Dylan, ducking as a few wasps flew nearby.

"So, what's the plan Jess?" I asked, swatting the air.

"I'm thinking we jab the hole and run!"

Dylan shook his head. "You're crazy! I don't care if it makes me a pussy, I'm staying back."

"He's right," I said. "I got stung once and it was pretty painful. There's probably hundreds in there!"

"Stay back then," she said, getting closer to the nest as she dodged incoming wasps. "I'll do it on my own."

Dylan was hiding behind another tree, peering around it. I looked back at him and shrugged. The closer Jess and I got to the nest, the louder the drone. I bet if we'd touched that tree we would have felt it vibrating.

"Oww!" shouted Jess, slapping at her arm. "One got me!"

"Okay," I said. "So now we should get out of here. Come on!"

"Like hell!" she said, holding out the stick and jabbing it into the tree with a loud grunt. "Take that!"

The buzzing got louder as a swarm of wasps circled us. I felt a sharp pain on my hand and yelled out, then another near my elbow.

"RUN!" screamed Jess. She darted past me towards Dylan, who had already left his hiding spot and was a few feet ahead. I didn't hang around and followed close behind, my heart beating hard.

"Oh shit, oh shit!" Dylan kept repeating. Jess was laughing her head off which made me laugh too, even though I was worried for our lives at that moment. I felt another sting on my arm and yelled out.

We came to a steep hill that dipped into a ravine. We ran down it at full speed with no regard for our safety. The options were potentially getting stung to death by wasps, or potentially breaking our necks.

As we reached the bottom, I tripped and rolled until I came to a stop. I laid on my back catching my breath. Dylan was bent down with his hands on his knees, breathing heavily. Jess had a hand to her chest looking like she'd found the whole thing incredibly amusing. She had a few red bumps on her arms.

"Never again!" said Dylan. "Jesus Christ, that was horrible!"

"It was exciting!" said Jess with a grin.

"How many stings?" I asked, sitting up. She looked at her arms.

"At least six," she said. "You?"

"Three… I think. Dylan?"

"None!" he shouted. "And I intend on keeping it that way. We could have died!"

"He's right, you know," came a strange voice from nearby. We all looked in that direction, our jaws collectively dropping as we stared in disbelief.

It was a small deer, standing on its hind legs like a cartoon character. And it was wearing clothes.

'G… Guys," said Jess. "Are you seeing this?"

I rubbed my eyes. "If you mean a deer wearing people clothes, then yes."

The deer turned to me. "Well, I am part of the deer family. But to be specific, I'm a muntjac."

It was well spoken, like a sophisticated gentleman. It was dressed like one too. It wore what looked like a three-piece navy checked suit.

"Maybe we're seeing things because of the stings?" said Jess.

"Err, hello?" said Dylan. "I didn't get stung. I see it too!"

"I can assure you, I'm very much real," said the muntjac. "And less of the 'it' please. You can call me Monty."

I stood up, my eyes fixed on the small anthropomorphic creature before us.

"It's impossible for us all to see the same thing," I said. Monty nodded.

"Exactly! Thank you, Toby."

"How do you know my name?" I asked, confused.

"I know all of your names," said Monty. "Toby, Jessie, Dylan."

Jess scrunched up her face. "Only my mum calls me Jessie. I hate it!"

"Oh, but it's such a lovely name," said Monty. "Speaking of names, do you know the *'Name Game'*?"

We all looked at each other, shaking our heads.

"Don't think so," said Dylan.

"Brilliant!" said Monty cheerfully. "I do love it when I get to share it with newbies. It's very easy. You'll pick it up in no time!"

Just like that, music started to play. It was like it manifested from the tops of the trees, there was no direct source. Monty started to shake his shoulders to the beat.

"Where's that coming from?" said Jess, looking around. "There aren't any speakers out here."

Monty just smiled as he shimmied. "Oh, when you're with me, it's best not to question too much. Anything is possible. You'll see."

We all looked at each other, and our mouths turned to smiles.

"Are you ready?" said Monty. "Here we go…"

He spun around on the spot as he started to sing.

"The name game… Dylan! Dylan Dylan bo-byl-an, bo-na-na fanna fo-fyl-an, fee-fi-mo-myl-an… Dylan!"

Dylan had a huge grin on his face as he started to laugh.

"Jessie! Jessie Jessie bo-bess-ie, bo-na-na fanna fo-fess-ie, fee-fi-mo-mess-ie… Jessie!"

Jess shook her head but couldn't contain her amusement. By this point we all found ourselves moving to the music.

"Come on everybody… I say let's play a game… I betcha I can make a rhyme…
Out of anybody's name…"

Monty continued to sing as he shuffled and shimmied. It was such a surreal experience, but so infectious. We were all bopping along to a singing, dancing muntjac in the middle of the woods.

"Now say 'Bo'."

All three of us shouted *"Bo!"*

"Now Toby with a 'B'."

*"Bo-by!"*

"Then Bo-na-na fanna and fo."

*"Bo-na-na fanna fo!"*

"Then you say the name again with an 'F' very plain."

*"Fo-by!"*

"Then fee-fi and a mo."

*"Fee-fi-mo!"*

"Then you say the name again with an 'M' this time."

*"Mo-by!"*

"And there isn't any name that you can't rhyme!"

Dylan, Jess, and I all joined hands and started spinning in a circle. A load of birds had flown down from the trees and were flying around us as we spun. Then a bunch of grey squirrels joined in and danced in the middle of our circle.

"Everybody do Monty!"

All three of us burst into song like we'd known it all along.

*"Monty Monty bo-bon-ty, bo-na-na fanna fo-fon-ty, fee-fi-mo-onty… Monty!"*

We all fell down and rolled around laughing as Monty finished the song, and the birds and squirrels dispersed.

"How are those stings?" asked Monty. We sat up. Jess and I looked at our arms and then at each other, our jaws dropped.

"They're gone!" said Jess. Our arms were clear of the painful red bumps that had been there no more than five minutes ago. Dylan grabbed one of Jess' arms to take a closer look. Monty smiled.

"I do find that a good song and dance is often the perfect remedy to many ailments."

"How did you do that?" Asked Dylan. "I mean, the music *and* the stings."

"I told you," said Monty. "When you're with me, *anything* is possible. I'm…" He looked up briefly like he was searching for the best word. "Magic."

"But…" Dylan tried to intervene but was cut short.

"Don't question it, young man," said Monty, laughing a little. "If you're looking for an explanation, you won't find it from me. You've seen it for yourselves, you know it's the truth."

"Even without the other stuff," I said, "He's a walking, talking deer… Sorry, muntjac. Which is pretty darn magical anyway!"

"Well, thank you Toby," said Monty.

"What else can you do?" asked Jess. "You made us sing and dance, took away our wasp stings. Is there more?"

Monty laughed. "Oh, dear Jessie. There is no limit to what I can do. Or should I say, what *you* can do."

There was a light coming from Jess' direction. Dylan and I turned and stood frozen in awe as she looked down at herself.

She was wearing battle armour, her body covered in sparkling steel. Under one arm she held a helmet, and in her other hand she held a medieval looking sword. She was bathed in an aqua green glow for a few seconds before it faded.

"What the fuck!" she yelled excitedly.

"Hmm," said Monty. "I'm not sure I approve of the language but I understand."

"Guys!" she continued. "Look at me!"

"Oh my God!" said Dylan.

"That's incredible," I added.

Jess held out the sword and swung it over her head. "It's a lot heavier than a stick!"

"I'm sure you can handle it," said Monty. "Quite honestly, you have no choice. I think I sense a…" He looked around. "Yes, there's definitely something coming."

There was a distant roar somewhere above, beyond the trees. It made the hairs on my arms stand up.

"What was that?" I asked. We all stood looking towards the sky.

"Remember the dragon you slayed in the school playground?" asked Monty.

We all looked at each other wide-eyed as the sound of large wings filled the woods, and with a tremble through the ground, a dragon landed at the top of the hill.

"I think that's mother," continued Monty.

The dragon roared, breathing flames that caused the trees around it to set ablaze.

"You'd better hurry," said Monty to Jess. "It appears to be quite unhappy."

"On my own?" said Jess.

"We need to help," I said. "Can you change us too?"

Monty gave us a knowing grin. "Oh, something tells me you two will have your own monsters to deal with."

With that, Dylan started to glow just like Jess did. I watched as his clothes changed to military fatigues. His face had stripes of black and green warpaint. He held an assault rifle in his hands and there was a machete at his side.

Dylan barely had time to acknowledge his new ensemble before a bright red laser beam pointed in his direction, and something shot from the trees close to his feet. He screamed but somehow managed the smoothest back-flip to avoid harm. 

"Jesus Christ!" he yelled. "Did you see that?" He looked pleased with himself.

Something made an inhuman cackle from the treetops and there was the rustling of leaves as something moved through them.

"Jess, Dylan," said Monty. "I suggest you take action."

Jess took a deep breath. She gave me a smile that said *'this is so fucking cool'* as she put the helmet on and charged up the hill towards the dragon, her sword raised as she screamed her battle cry.

Dylan held up his rifle, a sudden look of confidence on his face. He gave me a slight nod as he ran into the foliage. It was just myself and Monty now. My heart was beating hard. I was somewhat scared, but excited to see what would be in store for me. That's when I heard a quiet shuffling sound from nearby.

I turned to see a decaying zombie walking towards me. Its skin was loose and its jaw looked dislocated. One eye was missing, the other was completely white. It was making a gurgling noise from within its torn throat.

There was a slight tingling sensation as the green glow appeared around me, and I looked down to see my clothes change to that of an American police officer. A badge on my chest was engraved with RCPD. I looked at Monty with a huge grin as I felt the cold metal of a pistol in my hand.

"Your only limit is your imagination," said Monty with a smile. "Now, go protect these woods my dear child."

I raised the pistol and pulled back the slide like I'd always known how to use one, then aimed it directly at the zombie's head. The kickback caused me to flinch only slightly as a dark red mist sprayed across the ferns, and the zombie's shuffling came to a halt.

Within seconds there were loud groans coming from all around me. I was surrounded by the undead, and they clearly wanted to eat my internal organs.

I stepped into action, rolling around and firing my pistol. For every zombie that fell, another seemed to appear. I went through multiple rounds of ammo, but my belt seemed to have an unlimited supply. I changed the clip effortlessly, just like a trained cop would.

At one point I started to laugh and cheer. I was having the time of my life, and although Monty never explicitly said we were never in any real danger, I just had a feeling we weren't.

I looked around to see Jess darting around and dodging the dragon's flames, swinging her sword and leaving bloody wounds across its scales.

The sound of Dylan's rifle came from somewhere in the trees. I saw him perched high up on a branch spraying bullets as lasers and sparks danced around him.

There was a strange sensation in my right hand, particularly in my fingers. They felt numb all of a sudden. But I didn't pay them that much attention and carried on shooting the hoards of zombies.

I couldn't say how much time had gone by, but eventually I noticed that I could no longer hear Jess and the dragon. I looked up the hill and they were nowhere to be seen. I could still hear Dylan screaming through the trees as he continued to shoot at something. That's when I heard a faint voice, like an echo.

"Wake up."

I looked around and couldn't see anyone. It only then occurred to me that I hadn't seen Monty for some time either, he'd disappeared.

"Wake up, Toby!" that voice called again, making me turn in all directions. It sounded a little closer this time, and familiar.

"Jess, is that you?" I called out. "Where are you?" I couldn't see her anywhere.

There was a tight grip on my shoulder, forcing me to turn. I was face to face with a decomposing, walking corpse. I screamed. Its jaw barely stayed intact as it yelled "wake up" in my face.

That's when everything got a little darker, uncomfortable, and confusing. I lifted my head and Jess was sitting in front of me.

"Oh, thank God!" she said, her voice wavering. I could see she'd been crying. I felt so disorientated.

"Jess?" I said, groggy. I tried to move forward but my arms were bound to something behind me. I looked around. We were inside what looked like a huge wicker pod. Various twigs and branches were woven together tightly, letting in the bare minimum of light. I panicked. "What's going on?"

"Shush," she said quietly, putting a finger to her lips. "It'll hear you."

"What will?" I asked, my heart beating hard. Jess managed to untie me and I stretched out my arms. The numbness I'd felt in my right hand earlier was a bit more intense now. When I checked to see why, I was missing my second finger.

"Oh fuck, oh fuck!" I started to yell, and Jess covered my mouth with her hand. Her eyes were wide as she shook her head.

"Please, Toby," she said quietly. "You've got to keep it together."

My whole body trembled as tears started to stream down my face. She removed her hand and I took a stuttered breath.

"It's Monty," she said. "I'm sure of it. Whatever it is was pretending to be Monty, to gain our trust. I think it made us all dream then brought us here."

"For what?" I asked, crying. I was disorientated and had a splitting headache. I also noticed that our wasp stings hadn't really gone at all. Jess grabbed my shoulders. Fresh tears ran down her face too, though she managed to hold back the snivelling.

"To eat us," she said with wide eyes. "Dylan's gone, Toby."

She moved, and pointed to the other side of the pod. I took a sharp intake of breath and covered my mouth.

Dylan was sitting there, head tilted to the side. His arms were bound to the pod. His left leg was missing, it was just a bloody stump from around midway down his thigh. The most disturbing thing about it was I could see a smile on his face.

"Oh Dylan," I said, wiping away tears. "The last time I saw him, he was in the trees having the time of his life."

Jess nodded. "I don't think he felt any pain."

I nodded in agreement, holding up my right hand with the missing finger. "I remember feeling a strange numbing sensation but that's it. It doesn't even hurt now, really."

Jess continued. "I saw it when it was… attached to your hand. It kind of puked up this liquid first. I think that stops the pain."

I felt a shiver run down my spine. "Jess, what is it?"

She shook her head as she wiped away tears. "It's a monster, Toby. Like, an actual monster from nightmares. They exist."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. "Where is it now?"

She shrugged. "It left just before I managed to wake you. One minute I was fighting that dragon, the next I was in here tied up. I saw it on your hand, then it moved to Dylan's leg. I don't know how I didn't scream, but I managed to keep it together and free myself when it left."

I crawled over to Dylan, avoiding the pool of blood that had formed around the stump. I put my hand under his chin, gently lifting his head up. He looked so peaceful, like he was having the best dream.

"Why did it only take my finger?" I asked rhetorically. I put two fingers from my good hand against Dylan's neck to feel for a pulse.

"He's alive!" I said more loudly than I was aiming for. "We've gotta get him out of here."

Jess came over. "Oh God, Dylan!" She started to tap his cheek with her palm.

"No, don't wake him," I said. "If he wakes up like that, he's going to freak out." I looked around. "How do we get out of this thing?"

Jess pointed to the side. "It left over there. There's an opening."

I untied Dylan's arms and he slumped over. I hooked my hands under his armpits and pulled as hard as I could. Jess found the part of the pod that opened up like a small door.

"I'm gonna need your help," I said, struggling to move him on my own. Jess came over and we each grabbed one of his arms, managing to pull him out of the pod. We were still in the woods, though it was a part I didn't recognise. It was starting to get dark too. We must have been there for a while.

"I'll carry him on my back," I said. "Can you put his arms over my shoulders?"

I crouched down and Jess manoeuvred Dylan's body so he was sitting upright. I reached around and put my right hand under his good leg, then tried to be as gentle as possible with what was left of his other. I felt Jess help push us up as I stood with a groan. He was so heavy.

"Let's go, before it comes back" said Jess, looking around. "This way looks as good as any."

We moved as quickly as we could through the trees. My legs ached with every step but I was determined to get Dylan to safety. Jess led the way as I felt the ground ascending slightly, and she offered support when I needed it by putting her arm around us.

"Are you okay?" she asked.

"I can't believe it, Jess," I said, out of breath. "Poor Dylan. What are we gonna tell his parents?"

She shook her head. "I don't know. We'll get him help, and will just have to explain as best as we can."

"What's going on?" I heard Dylan in my ear, sounding disorientated. It startled me and I almost fell over.

"Dylan!" said Jess, putting her arm around him. "You had an accident, but we're going to get you help."

"Hang in there," I said through gritted teeth. I was feeling the weight.

"What kind of accident?" he asked. "Where are we? Where's Monty?"

There came a shriek from somewhere behind us, making my legs almost buckle under us.

"Oh fuck!" yelled Jess. "Come on, quickly!"

"I'm trying!" I screamed, my heart feeling like it was going to explode. I heard rustling directly behind us and suddenly the weight was off my shoulders. My legs gave way as I fell, and I heard Dylan scream.

"My leg!? What the fuck happened to my leg?"

He was sitting on the ground holding the bloody stump as something ran up behind him. It was about the size of a large dog, and mammalian in appearance at first. Its body was covered in thick dark hair and it walked on four bony legs. Its head had two large horns that spiralled into sharp points. Its spine was sharp looking and protruded along its back. Its long snout opened to reveal something more reptilian inside. A smooth, scaly head emerged with two soulless black eyes on the sides. I'm no artist but here's a [rough sketch of how I remember the creature looking.](https://www.reddit.com/user/disco-dingus/comments/yhbbo4/creature_that_my_friends_and_i_encountered_in_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

As it opened its mouth, the mammalian shell retracted like a costume. It clamped down on Dylan's shoulder with razor teeth. Jess and I could only watch in horror.

"Help me!" screamed Dylan as it shook him from side to side. As it started to drag him away I frantically looked around for something to attack it with. All I could see was a stick, so I grabbed it and got up on shaky legs. I charged towards it, screaming as I held the stick with both hands like a sword. It let go of Dylan and lunged forward, snapping at me with bloody jaws.

"We're thick as thieves!" I yelled, slashing the stick through the air and feeling the impact as it met the creature's head. It roared in pain and recoiled, burying its face into the ground. I jumped as Jess grabbed me from behind.

"Come on!" she yelled, pulling me away.

"But Dylan…"

"It's too late, Toby!"

We ran as the woods became darker and Dylan's screams became quieter. The creature pursued us, it snarled as it charged through the foliage. My legs felt like they couldn't take much more. I was exhausted, terrified, in shock. But Jess was strong and forced me to keep going when I wanted to stop.

Eventually there was a light through the trees, and we could make out the lit windows of houses. We were close to home. For a second it felt like we were going to make it. And then I tripped.

"Toby!" Jess screamed. I turned to see the creature charging straight for me, head lowered and its ivory horns ready to jab like a bull seeing red. It just shrieked continuously as I cowered, covering my face with my arms as it got closer.

All I saw was a bright light fill the woods, and heard what I can only describe as an electrical charge as the creature fell to the ground. I peered through my arms as it got to its feet and tried to pounce on me. It was only a few feet away, but it hit something with another flash of light and fell back. There was some kind of invisible shield stopping it from coming further.

Jess picked me up and we stood in disbelief as it paced, snarling at us.

"It must be confined to the woods," she said. "Thank God. Come on."

She guided me away, our bodies trembling against each other as we walked towards the lights of our housing estate.

"Toby," came a familiar voice from behind. We turned to see Monty, now back to a little muntjac. There was a fresh wound over one of his eyes, oozing blood that dripped down his smart suit. He smiled.

"You taste awful, by the way. Dylan though…" He gave a chef's kiss. "I'll tell him you said hi when I finish him off later."

A search party looked for Dylan for weeks afterwards. We said we were attacked by some kind of wild animal, but left out the part about Monty. Nothing could be found other than traces of Dylan's blood.

Jess and I underwent months of interviews and psychoanalysis. We were even suspects at one point. We had both been covered in his blood, me especially. One accuser suggested that Dylan had bit my finger off in an act of self defence. It was eventually ruled out, they said it was almost impossible for two kids to make a body disappear like that.

I think it was inevitable that Jess and I would end up together, and we eventually had our own child. A son, who we named Dylan. He's nine now. We're very protective of him, but don't wrap him in cotton wool. He's just forbidden from playing in the woods. Though when he came back from the park recently he was singing something that chilled Jess and I.

"Dylan Dylan bo-byl-an…"

We looked at each other as I felt the hairs on my arms stand up.

"Where did you hear that, sweetheart?" asked Jess.

Our son beamed. "Monty the muntjac. He said hello!"
