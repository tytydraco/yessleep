Hi! My name is Leina, and I just want to talk about my urban exploration experience that I did with a group of friends. There were 4 experienced individuals, and 1 beginner, whom we'll call C, D, M, and Ch. We were intrigued by the tales of an abandoned psychiatric asylum. Despite the rumors surrounding this gloomy, dilapidated place—broken windows, medicine and water bottles completely shattered, and a few drops and traces of blood on the walls.

It was pitch black, and the asylum had been abandoned for 10-15 years next to a facility for disabled children, also abandoned for about 5 years. The rumors spoke of completely insane individuals, like cannibal serial killers, scenes of torture, and mistreatment of patients—nothing pleasant but quite usual for urban exploration or urban legends. We only had our torches to illuminate our way, 4 flashlights, and a lantern since one of our friends couldn't afford much else, so we placed it in the middle for his safety (we'd encountered a few violent individuals before). My friend D and I have been practicing boxing for 18 years, although we've never really needed to defend ourselves, we knew what to do. Besides, my buddy and I were quite muscular for young adults, appearing rather intimidating with our size and build resembling MMA pros. The other friends brought a pocket knife and weren't as intimidating as the rumors described because they were just regular folks. There were only rooms; the only slightly eerie detail was a straitjacket stained with blood. But let's get back to our urban exploration.

We continued to search room by room, shining our lights into each area before entering. Room after room yielded nothing of interest, so M began to tell horror stories and the rumors about the place and its surroundings to keep the mood going. Even though the place was eerie, it wasn't so frightening with all the childish graffiti around.

Then, we entered a room and saw an animal corpse, a big one like a deer or a large boar, but the body was still fresh, blood oozing, and the entrails out, surrounded by more or less fresh bloodstains. The room itself was a mix of unsettling photographs and dried blood splatters. We were on the verge of vomiting at the sight. Then, we saw a guy crouched down, a knife in hand covered in blood, torn clothes also soaked in blood. We decided to leave, but D and I decided to cover our friends, so we let them go. The guy slowly turned his head, his mouth covered in blood, and said, 'I see my feast has arrived,' with a wide smile and a completely terrifying laugh. My friend told me to leave, but I couldn't. I was frozen in a mix of fear and disgust. I saw him stand up and slowly approach. What brought me back to my senses was a sharp pain on the right side of my face, and I couldn't see anything from that side anymore. The guy had gouged out my eye. Understanding this and losing blood, I passed out.

I woke up in the hospital with my friends and girlfriend crying beside me. The wound was deep and nearly fatal, with a 5% chance of survival. To this day, I wear an eyepatch to cover the gaping hole where my eye used to be. As for the guy, he was truly insane, medically certified, and locked up again for cannibalism. He was severely injured by D while trying to protect me. Due to the trauma and my disability, I never ventured into urban exploration again. My girlfriend moved in with me because I feared encountering that guy again, even though I know he's locked up for good. I don't go out at night alone anymore; at least my girlfriend and D (who's my roommate) are with me. The others recovered better than me and still engage in urban exploration, but they avoid hospitals or similar places. Only D has a bit of trouble because he also narrowly escaped death for me, and for that, I'll be grateful forever for not abandoning me to my fate. My girlfriend told me she absolutely wants him to witness our marriage if we ever have one.
