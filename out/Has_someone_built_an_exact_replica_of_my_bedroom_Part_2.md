I spun around, back slamming against the headboard, heart thundering.

From my position, I couldn’t see into the corridor. If someone was standing out there, they were in no rush to come inside.

Seconds crawled by. A minute, maybe two. The only sound was blood roaring in my ears. That’s when it struck me: this wasn’t an intrusion. It was an invitation.

It didn’t take a genius to figure out that I wasn’t the one running this show. I felt like a rat in a maze with a bunch of clipboard-wielding assholes in white lab coats scrutinising my every move. Far as I could tell, I had one choice: play their stupid game—or don’t. My gut told me that refusing would take this ordeal in a direction I really wouldn’t want to see.

I swallowed hard. Resigned, I hauled myself off the bed and crept back to the door.

I carefully leaned past the door jamb, confirming what I’d already suspected: the corridor was still there, no boogeyman lurking, eager to jump me. But it took me a moment to notice that something *had* changed.

In the distance, I spotted the tiniest flicker of light, trembling like a candle in the wind. I couldn’t make out any details, and I sure as hell didn’t know what it meant. One question shoved aside everything else rattling in my skull: would I be able to reach it?

So I started walking. If that ominous invisible force was going to hold me back again, I’d find out soon enough.

I kept peeking over my shoulder, but the inexplicable barrier seemed to be gone. With every step, the distance to my bedroom grew, which soon had me wondering whether I’d ever make it back. The thought of losing the only refuge I had made my skin crawl. It wasn’t exactly out of the question, with the laws of physics having been reduced to mere suggestions.

But I didn’t turn back. I was almost buzzing with the taste of freedom and determined to see what that light was about. It was steadily growing larger, and I held out hope it meant answers. And just when I thought I was about to see what it was illuminating, it vanished.

My determination winked out the instant the light did. I still had the torch on my phone, but the darkness felt like it was closing in around me. Call me a coward—I sure did so myself more than once—but I spun on my heel and rushed back.

Mercifully, my bedroom door was still visible. I ran towards it, then realised something was off. The dim cone of light from my bedside lamp didn’t reveal much, but…

I skidded to a halt. There was something—or someone—in front of the door. A dark silhouette, vaguely human, too far away to be sure. It stood motionless, legs slightly apart. If it had arms, it held them tight to its sides.

My heart lurched into my throat, my mind screaming contradictory commands: Get the fuck out of here! Stay away from the dark! I stayed frozen, unable to act, and I might have lingered there for all eternity if the decision hadn’t been made for me.

The silhouette lunged into a sprint and charged straight at me. Whack-whack-whack—its feet pounded the floorboards, each step louder than the last. And above it all came a high-pitched keening, a sound like nothing I’d ever heard a human make.

I yelled out in shock and tore off in the other direction as fast as I could. My own footfalls and ragged breaths nearly drowned out the noises behind me, but they got louder and louder as the creature kept gaining on me.

I’m not exactly an athlete. My chest started to burn, my muscles screaming in protest. Yet I pushed myself harder, convinced I was about to die. The light from my phone slashed wildly across the walls as my hand whipped it this way and that. Tears streamed down my cheeks, that awful wail drilling into my brain.

I saw the door way too late to stop, even if I’d wanted to. All I could do was twist my right shoulder forward and pray my bones held up. I slammed into the door, a jolt of pain shooting from my shoulder all the way to my fingertips. The wooden frame splintered near the lock as the bolt tore free. The door crashed open, and I flew through it, immediately losing my balance and landing spread-eagle.

My chest struck the ground, knocking the wind out of me, and I barely managed to keep my face from following suit. My phone slid across the floor and came to rest a few metres ahead, torch side down, casting a faint circle of light. I rolled over just in time to find the creature bursting through the door as well, its wail rising to a mind-shattering crescendo.

The second it crossed the threshold, it froze—and then exploded into flames with a thunderous roar. Startled, I threw my forearm over my face, howling at the blast of heat. But just before I turned away, I got my first and only clear look at the creature, and I really fucking wish I hadn’t.

Flames engulfed most of its body, but there was no question it had the shape of a man. Only its face was perfectly visible, as if on purpose. It was distorted in a mask of sheer terror and agony. Its eyes bulged from their sockets, already starting to dissolve as they stared straight into mine. Its screeching mouth hung open, wider than any human jaw would allow, skin pulled long and thin over its cheeks, tearing in places.

That image alone would’ve burned itself into my brain forever—but what truly pushed it into lunacy was the fact that the creature was wearing my face.

Just as that realisation hit me, the flames died out with a loud *woosh*, leaving behind nothing but darkness and silence. I let out a strangled noise—half sob, half chuckle—incredulous that I was still alive. Another shaky laugh slipped out, then a third. I smacked myself across the face to keep from tipping over the edge of madness. Tears still flowed, my heart seemingly intent on erupting from my chest, but little by little, I managed to pull myself together.

I crawled over to my phone and picked it up. Figured I’d better not dwell too hard on the past ten minutes, or I might punch my one-way ticket to the funny farm after all. So I’d finally reached the end of the not-so-endless hallway then. I needed to find out where the hell I was.

When I swept the phone’s light across the walls, my heart sank. It was another corridor, exactly like the first one, with the same goddamn floral patterns stretching on forever.

I screamed in frustration, throat raw, sick to death of this bullshit and desperate for a glimpse of daylight. When my voice eventually gave out, I let out a long, defeated sigh and continued on.

I have no idea how far I’d gone when I spotted another dim light in the distance. My whole body tensed. I didn’t think I could handle another nightmare like that, but I wasn’t about to turn back now. Anything could happen next, and that uncertainty had me on edge. I expected the light to blink out any second, but it kept burning, steady and silent.

The closer I got, the more dread crawled up my spine—not because of a rising sense of danger, but because I thought I knew what I was heading towards. With every step, the feeling grew stronger, until I was close enough to be certain. It was another doorway, faintly lit by a glow from the room beyond. By the time I stepped through, I was sobbing again, utterly wrecked.

I was back in my bedroom.

I’m ashamed to admit I completely lost my shit at that point. Violence isn’t usually my style when things get out of hand, so I surprised myself by grabbing the linen basket by the door and hurling it at the mirror across the room.

The glass exploded with a deafening crash, shards raining down in a glittering cascade. The basket’s lid popped off as it bounced away, spilling half its contents and leaving a huge mess among the glass.

I stared at the wreckage, dumbfounded. But I’d be lying if I said my mood didn’t instantly pick up.

I closed the door behind me and tried once again to think logically about all this. I was sure I was back in the same room I’d left when I first entered the corridor—and not in another room made to look exactly like it. Everything was right where I’d left it, except of course for the chaos I’d just caused. The walled-in window was still cracked open, and the water bottle I’d drunk from sat right there on the nightstand. It had to be the same room.

So had I somehow managed to get turned around? Hell no. I’d crashed through a doorway right before that monstrous clone of mine turned into a bonfire—and I definitely hadn’t come back through it. I’d simply been fooled by another illusion, like the one that kept me from moving down the corridor. That had to be it.

I picked my way to the bed, carefully avoiding the glass shards, and sat down hard, tossing my phone aside. My thoughts circled back to what had only been a hunch before, turning into near certainty. What if I was being toyed with? What if all this crap was being orchestrated by someone—or something?

This went way beyond any dream I’d ever had, and the only other theory I could come up with was that I’d died and gone to hell. But that was ridiculous… wasn’t it? Because what was happening to me felt tailor-made to drive me insane, and you better believe they were par for the fucking course.

Since nothing else made even a shred of sense, I was ready to accept that as the baseline for the three big ones: who, how and why? I wished I could answer even one of them.

Had I done something to piss someone off? But what? I’m a pretty quiet guy, not exactly in the habit of stepping on toes if I can help it. I genuinely had no clue who might have it in for me.

And there really was no point in trying to figure out the how. I mean, how could any of this be possible? I certainly didn’t believe in voodoo magic or other supernatural nonsense, but this was about as close to impossible as I’d ever seen. Whoever was behind this had powers way beyond my comprehension. God, just thinking that made me feel like a total idiot.

Who knew what else might be in store for me—if I could get seriously hurt, or worse. I rubbed my shoulder, still throbbing dully from its collision with the door.

Before today, I’d have sworn that food would be the last thing on anyone’s mind in a situation like this, but my stomach was starting to send some pretty clear signals. It wasn’t too bad yet, but concerning nonetheless. Hard to tell how long it’d take before it became an actual problem. With no better option, I drank some more water, leaving about a quarter in the bottle.

Then came a knock at the door.
