I don’t do witchcraft anymore. In all honesty, I never really did. However, in this particular situation, I was desperate. I did a love spell several *years* ago (something to do with a white candle and burning paper?) and it didn’t work. The spell was on a guy, we’ll call him Tom, who I was obsessed with. I believe I was around 18 at the time. We dated for a little while, but Tom ended up losing interest and cutting ties with me. I still had major feelings for him. I had exhausted all methods of trying to logically get him back, but since I wanted to be with him so badly, I did a spell. This was the only spell I had ever done. I found it online and even went out and bought all of the materials for it. Nothing ever came of it. I thought the spell didn’t work. I moved on. I have not thought about this person in a very long time. I got married to someone else, had a child with this person, and so on. The guy that I did a spell on was not on my mind whatsoever. 

Last night, Tom astral projected into my dream. I usually don’t remember my dreams, let alone have vivid ones, but this one felt so real. Like, spooky real. Tom was angry. He looked older. I almost didn’t recognize him. When he started talking, it all came back to me. That was the same voice he had at 18. 

In the dream he crawled into my bed with me, pretended to be my ex-husband, and turned around to scare me. He told me that he’s angry about the spell I did on him. He said, and I quote, “if you’re going to fuck with my life, I’m going to fuck with yours.” He told me that he was astral projecting and basically blaming me for his misfortunes in romance. Tom stated that because I did the spell, the only person he could have a successful relationship would be me, but he does NOT like me and does not want to be with me. I told him that he’s been out of my head for years now, and he’s welcome to do whatever he pleases. He told me “that’s not how it works.”

Tom told me that he has only recently found out about the spell I did on him. The spookiest part about it was that he asked why I was sleeping with a knife in my pocket. I was super confused about that question and denied it in the dream. I really don’t remember anything in the dream after that. 

Eventually I woke up, lo and behold, there was a knife in my pocket. I had no knowledge of this until I woke up. I knew that I had thrown on a dirty pair of tactical pants because I’m in the middle of a move and it was my only option, but I didn’t realize that there was a pocket-knife in them.
