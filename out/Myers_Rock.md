Myers Rock is a small island off of Newburyport in Massachusetts. There’s one bridge that connects to the mainland. During the summer Myers Rock is busy. With its beaches and summer homes it’s quite the attraction, however, in the winter there’s barely anyone on the island. Some would feel unnerved with the absence of people, but not me. I love the quiet and empty streets. I’m not a misanthrope or anything, I just like to be alone sometimes. 

Outside was a nor’easter, which is a bad storm we get in New England. Most of the few remaining families had evacuated the island. I could have left too, fled to the mainland like the others to ride out the storm in a nice hotel, but that’s not me. No, I am a true New Englander and a little nor’easter never shook me.

I’m sitting in my living room with a cocktail, watching the choppy Atlantic and snow. The wind was howling. Then I see something on the beach. Was that a light?

I put my drink on the side table and get up from my chair to investigate. It was hard to make out in the storm but it looked like a child was on the beach. 

Who would let their kid out during a storm like this? Not only that but alone. Again, it was hard to make out anything more than a silhouette, but I was sure it was a child. Fearing for its safety I threw on my boots and jacket and headed outside.

This was quite the storm. The wind gusts had to be 60 mph and at this point snow had accumulated, making the trip to the beach quite the daunting task. 

There’s a set of steps which lead down to the beach. I strain to see. I no longer saw the silhouette but I still could see the light. It was slowly making its way down the beach and toward the wildlife refuge.

Once on the beach I head toward the refuge. I couldn't see the light anymore but I knew the child had gone down the path. I carefully navigate through the snow when suddenly I see the light. 

Quickly I make my way toward it shouting. When I catch up to it I freeze. It wasn’t a child. It was small like one but it was some sort of creature. It had long hair all over its body, red eyes and a fanged mouth. In its small hand it was carrying a lantern. Around its waist was a sheathed blade.

For a moment we just stare at each other. The creature was studying me, I assume it’s trying to assess my threat level. Then it hisses and dissapears.

What had I just witnessed? It reminded me of the myths of the Wampanoag tribe, specifically about the pukwudgie. Whatever it was it was gone now and the storm was picking up.

Once back in my house, before I could take off my coat and boots, I heard a loud hiss coming from outside. I open the door and see a dozen or so of those little creatures. They all held a lantern and around their waists were sheath blades. They stood in the street staring at me. 
I yell for them to leave me alone. They all hiss in response and in unison unsheath their daggers. Slowly they began to advance toward my door. 

I slam the door shut and quickly run to the living room. I could hear them outside. They were hissing and banging on the door. 

I run to the kitchen and grab a knife just as the door breaks open. The creatures run in and begin destroying everything they saw. I could hear smashing. I heard them throw something, maybe the side table, through the living room window. 

I was hiding in the kitchen, listening to the unfolding chaos. With my knife in my hand I was ready to defend myself. Suddenly it got quiet. I heard the storm as snow blew in through the broken window but that was it. After a few moments I stand up and cautiously make my way to the living room. It was a mess. 

I collapse in my chair facing the broken window. I bury my head into my hands and let out a sigh of relief. Whatever happened appeared to be over. 

Then I hear a hiss. This one was louder, deafening. I jump to my feet and panic sets in. Out on the beach were hundreds of lanterns, spread out down both sides of the beach and more were coming from the wildlife refuge. 
Slowly they climbed the steps that led to the street outside my house. I rush to my front door with my knife and see dozens of them right outside. 

There is no escape. I drop my knife and drop to my knees in defeat. They are advancing to my door and there’s nothing I can do to save myself.
