We’re at the ending now... So much more happens from here on. But I have to give you the short version, because... the long version will kill me... I barely have anything left in me to finish the story. But what comes next is the true horror of The Asili. It’s what I’ve been afraid to tell... So, I just have to tell it best I can... 

Me and Tye were in the hole. Terrified by the events of that night, we stayed awake until the dimness of the jungle’s daylight returned on the surface... It was still pitch black inside our hole, but at least from the dim circular light above us, we knew the horrors of the night had probably disappeared... Like I said, the two of us did manage to get out of that hole - but we didn’t escape from it... We were rescued... 

From out of nowhere, a long rope made from vines is thrown down into the hole. We yell out to whoever threw it down and a voice shouts back to us – an English-speaking voice! We get out the hole and what we see are two middle-aged white men, with thick moustaches and dressed like jungle explorers from the 1800’s. But they weren’t alone. With them were around twenty African men, dressed only in dark blue trousers and holding spears or arrows... 

The two white men introduce themselves to us. Their names were Jacob, an American from the southern states - and Ruben, a Belgian. Although I was at first relieved to be seeing white faces again, I then noticed their strange expressions... Something about these men scared me. They smiled at me with the most unnerving grins, and their voices were so old-fashioned I could barely understand them... There was something about their eyes that was dark – incredibly dark! And the African men with them, they were expressionless. They barely blinked or made any kind of gesture, like they were in some kind of trance. The American man, Jacob, he gets up close and is just staring at me, like he was amazed by my appearance. I didn’t want to look at him, but I couldn’t help but feel pulled up into his gaze... Looking into this man’s eyes, I couldn’t help but feel terrified... and I didn’t even know why... 

When they were done with me, they turned their attention to Tye. Without even saying a word to them, Jacob and Ruben treat Tye as though he somehow offended them – as though just his appearance was enough to make them angry. Jacob orders something to the African men in a different language and they tackle Tye to the ground, like they were arresting him!... 

They brought us away with them, past the mutilated remains of the zombie-people from the night before. They tied Tye’s hands behind his back and were pulling him along a rope vine, like he was no better than a dog. They didn’t treat me this way. Jacob and Ruben seemed so happy to see me. They treated me as though they already knew me... Walking through the jungle for another day, they brought us to where they lived. From the distance, what we saw was a huge fortification of some kind – made from long wooden walls. The closer we get to this place, I began to see all the details... and it was horror!... 

Along the top of the walls, more African men in blue trousers were guarding – but above them, on long wooden spikes... were at least a dozen severed heads!... Worse than this, right outside the walls of the fort, were five wooden crosses - but on them – inside them, were decaying rotting corpses! A long wooden spike had been forced through one end and out the other – through the back of their skull, while another was shoved underneath their arms horizontally – making them into a cross. The crucified man!... 

Inside the walls of the fort was a whole army of African men, wearing the same identical dark blue trousers – and all with the same empty expressions. They lived in a village of thatched-roof huts – too many to count. Making our way through the village, towards the centre of the fort, we came across four large wooden cabins, decorated in pieces of white ivory...  

But I then saw something that was remotely familiar... Outside the wooden cabins, in a sort of courtyard... was a familiar face... It was the dead tree! The dead tree with the face! Only it had been carved to resemble a statue – an idol... and on top of that idol, staring down at me... was the very same face... The face from my dreams had finally shown itself to me... The worst was still yet to come. Even worse than the dead mutilated bodies. For what we found next was what we came here to find... We found the others... 

We found Naadia, and we found the other commune members. They were still alive... but they were all crammed inside of a small wooden cage. They were being held prisoners! Even worse, they were being held... I can’t say it... 

Jacob and Ruben weren’t the only two white people here. There was two more. One of them was a woman – a blonde Swedish woman. Her name was Ingrid. Dragging the bottom of her dirty white dress towards me, she seemed just as amazed to see me as Jacob and Ruben. Touching my face, she for some reason had tears in her eyes, like I was someone close to her she hadn’t seen for a long time. This woman, although I thought she was very beautiful... she was clearly insane... 

But then I met the last white face that lived here... Their leader... From the middle, larger of the cabins, an old man walked down to us. Like the other three, he wore white, Victorian-like clothing. He had a thick, grey beard and his body was round –and somehow... he looked how I always imagined God would look like... This man was called Lucien, and like the others, he spoke in an old-fashioned way, with a strong French accent. He came right up to me, up close to my face, and he stared at me with a serious expression, like there was no joy inside of him. But from his serious gaze, I saw he had the clearest blue eyes... and I realized... his eyes were very much like my own... Staring through me for a good while, the piercing look on his face quickly turned to joy. Uttering some words in French, Lucien pulled me into him and started hugging me as tight as he could... His arms around me were so strong and even though he was clearly happy to see me, whoever I was to him, he was squeezing me like he was intentionally trying to hurt me... 

I was so confused as to who these white people were, who seemed like they came from a hundred years ago. Even though they terrified me to my core, I knew they were the ones to give me the answers... The answers I’d been looking for... 

Lucien told me everything... He said this place, this dark, never-ending part of the jungle – The Asili... he said it was called the Undying Circle... People who entered the Circle could never leave. It would attract people to it – those chosen. The Circle was very old and was basically an ancient god – a sort of consciousness... 

The four of them, dressed in their white linen clothing, spoke like they were from the 1800’s because they were! They came to Africa at the end of the 19^(th) century. Wandering into the Undying Circle, they’d been here ever since. Stuck, frozen in time!... 

Jacob and Ruben were soldiers. When the Europeans were still colonizing Africa, they were hired by the king of Belgium to seize control of the Congo. They wandered into the Circle to conquer new territory or exploit whatever resources it had... But the Circle conquered them... 

Lucien and Ingrid came to Africa as Catholic missionaries. They came here to spread the word of God to the “uncivilized people”... They heard that a great evil existed inside the darkest regions of the jungle, and so they ventured inside to try and convert whatever savages lurked there... Now they were the savages...  

Lucien said they found people already living inside the Circle. He said they were stone-age savages who were more like beasts than men. Jacob and Ruben’s army went to war with them, and killed them all. They took their kingdom for themselves and made it their own. They chose Lucien as their leader and worshipped the Undying Circle as their new God... The God who’d allowed them to live forever... In this jungle, they were kings... and they could do whatever they wanted... 

But they still weren’t alone in this jungle... Whoever lived here before – the ones who survived Lucien’s army, they formed themselves into a new kingdom - a new tribe. Lucien’s army had killed all the men, but some of the women survived... They were a tribe of women... But Jacob said they weren’t women anymore – not even human. They were something else... Like them, they worshipped the Circle as a god, but believed it was female. Whatever it was they worshipped, Jacob said it turned them into some sort of creatures - who painted their skin red, head to toe in the blood of their enemies, were extremely tall, with long stretched-out limbs, and even had sharp teeth and talons...  Jacob said they were cannibals, who ate the flesh of men... This all sounded like racist bullshit to me - but in The Asili - in the Undying Circle... it seemed every nightmare was possible... 

The reason why they were so happy to find me – why they acted as though they already knew me... it wasn’t because of the colour of my skin or where I was from... it was because they knew the Circle would bring me here... In his dreams, Lucien said the Circle promised to bring him a son. Lucien believed I was his great, great, great something grandson, and that I was here to inherit his kingdom... I told him he was wrong. He was French and I was English, and even though we shared similar blue eyes, I told him it wasn’t possible... 

But Lucien told me something else... Before he came into the Undying Circle, he said he’d had a son... He broke his vows and gotten a native woman pregnant. He took the baby away from her and gave it to an English missionary. Whoever this missionary was, he brought the baby back with him to England to be raised and educated in the “civilized world”... I didn’t know if he was telling the truth. Was I really his descendent? I didn’t believe it... I chose not to believe it!... I wasn’t one of them! I would never be one of them!... 

They made me do things... They forced me to do things I didn’t want to do... They kept prisoners. They kept... Jacob forced me to beat them. He put his sword in my hands and made me kill the ones who were too weak to work. He made me cut off their hands. He wanted me to keep them as trophies...  

The female prisoners who the white men found attractive, they were allowed to roam free as concubines... Naadia was one of them... If she wasn’t, I would’ve been forced to hurt her... and even after everything she put me through. Cheating on me. Lying to me. Tricking me into coming to this place I never should’ve come to... I couldn’t do it... But I did it to the rest of them... 

What’s worse is that I enjoyed doing it to them. I enjoyed it!... It made me feel powerful! This group, that from day one, looked at me like I was unwanted, unaccepted. Made me feel guilty because of the colour of my skin. Every ounce of pain I put them through... I took pleasure from it... 

The one I wanted to hurt most of all was Tye. I hated him! I was jealous of him! He took Naadia away from me! I wanted to make him suffer... but I couldn’t... He wasn’t my prisoner. He was Ingrid’s... He was Ingrid’s concubine. I couldn’t touch him... and it infuriated me!...  

There’s something you need to understand... This place – the Undying Circle... The Asili... It brings out the darkest parts of you... Whatever darkness lies in your heart, the Circle brings it out of you. Allows it to overtake you... Jacob and Ruben came here as soldiers, and now they were tyrants. They were monsters... Ingrid was from a time where women were oppressed, and now she oppressed those who were seen as beneath her... Lucien came to spread the message of the God he loved... Now he’d denounced him... He now served another god – an evil god... In this place – in this jungle... he was God...  

I was a white guy from London. Diversity was all I knew. I accepted anyone and everyone... even if they never really accepted me... Is this what I truly am? In my darkest of hearts... am I a racist?... Of all the horrors I came across in that jungle... I feared myself the most... 

I was a god here. A king! I had power over life and death... I didn’t want it! I didn’t want any of it! Whatever part of me was still good, I called upon it... The man I was before... he wasn’t here anymore... He lived on the other side of The Asili... 

Beth and Chantal were dead. They died of weakness. The last I saw of them, they were just skin and bones... As long as Naadia was a concubine, at east she was being fed... As for Moses and Jerome, two young, strong “African men”... they became soldiers in Jacob and Ruben’s army... The things they did was almost as bad as me... Like me, the Circle preyed on their darkness... 

But they didn’t want to be soldiers – they didn’t want to be followers. They wanted to be free... They escaped the fortress and took their chances in the jungle... It didn’t take long for Jacob and Ruben to find them... They already killed Jerome - they put his head on top the wall with the others... But they gave Moses to me... 

They made me cut off his hands while he was still alive... I could hear Naadia screaming at me to stop, but I kept on beating him until he wasn’t screaming anymore... Moses loved God. He loved Jesus Christ - and even though he begged them in his final moments... no one was there... 

Moses looked for God in his final moments, but didn’t find him... I looked for that part of me that was supposed to be good – that once knew love and kindness... Every night, I woke only to see the darkness and the smell of death... But one night, through the surrounding black void of my cabin... I found him!... I saw him through the darkness... He told me what I needed to do - why I came here in the first place... 

That night, I went out of my cabin... The fort was quiet. Empty - but the torches were still lit all around. Tye was in the courtyard, tied to a wooden pole by his neck. I held out my knife to him. I wanted him to know that I had the power to kill him... but instead I was going to cut him free. Even though he had no reason to, I needed him to trust me... I told him we needed to save Naadia, and then the three of us were getting out of this place – that we’d take our chances in the jungle... Tye was expressionless. The Circle’s darkness had clearly gotten to him. He looked up at me, with murder in his eyes... But then he agreed... He was with me... 

As Tye went away in the direction of Ingrid’s cabin, I went into Ruben’s... I opened the door slowly. I couldn’t see but I could hear him breathing... I put my hand over the sound coming from his mouth – and with my knife, I pressed it into his neck! I heard him react under my hand and I pressed down even harder. I heard the blood gurgling inside his mouth and felt his nails scrape deep into my skin... But now Ruben was dead... I killed him while he slept, and in his final moments... he didn’t even know why... 

I leave Ruben’s cabin and I make my way towards Jacob’s. I found Tye there, waiting for me. I asked him if he did it, and he looked at me blankly and said... ‘I strangled her’... The way Tye looked at me, I was afraid of him... I now knew what he was capable of... but I needed him... 

We went inside Jacob’s cabin. He was sleeping with Naadia next to him. Naadia saw us through the glow of the outside torches and we gestured for her to be quiet. By the bedside was Jacob’s sword – the same one he’d made me use to do my killings... I took it. Standing over Jacob, Tye looked at me, waiting for me to give the signal. As I raised Jacob’s sword, Tye quickly put his hands over Jacob’s mouth. I saw Jacob’s eyes open wide! Looking up to Tye, he then instantly looked at me, seeing I was holding his own sword over him. I stuck it deep into his belly as hard as I could! I saw his eyes scrunch up as Tye kept his groans inside. I took out the blade and I kept on stabbing him! Covering me and Tye in Jacob’s own blood. Jacob tried grabbing the sword but it only sliced through his hands... By the time he was dead, his hands were still holding the blade... 

Having killed Jacob, the three of us left out the cabin. The fort was still quiet and no one had heard our actions... We knew we couldn’t just leave the fort – soldiers were still guarding the front entrance. We knew we had to create a distraction, and so we took one of the fire torches and we set Ingrid’s and Jacob’s cabins on fire! We hid in the darkest parts of the fort until the fire was so large, it woke up Lucien and all of Jacob’s soldiers. It seemed everyone had gathered round the burning cabins to try and put out the flames, and as they tried, we made our escape! The entrance was unguarded, and so we ran outside the fort and into the darkness of the jungle... 

We journeyed through the Circle’s jungle for days, unsure where it was we were even going. We knew we could never escape, but taking our chances out in this jungle was better than the hell that existed inside there!... I feared what we’d run into – what we’d find... I feared that Lucien and his army would be coming after us... I feared the predatory monsters we’d only seen glimpses of... and I feared that Jacob was telling the truth, and there was some tribe of man-eating creatures who could be stalking us... 

But just like when we first entered this jungle... we saw nothing. Again, we were trapped among the same identical trees and vegetation... before the Circle... The Asili... just seemed as though it spat us back out...We were free!...  

We found our way out of that place! We were still in the jungle – the real jungle. But whatever dangers the Congo had, it was nothing compared to the horrors in there! We found our way back to the river, back down to Kinshasa... and eventually, we found our way home... 

We never told the truth about what happened to us... We said we got lost – that the others had died of disease or hunger... It was easy for them to believe, because the truth wasn’t... 

I went back to London, and Naadia went home to her family... I tried to get in touch with her, but I couldn’t... She ignored my texts, my calls... She no longer wanted anything to do with me... To this day, I don’t even know where she is – if she went back to the States to be with Tye... For the past three years I’ve felt completely alone. I’ve had to live with what I’ve been through... alone... But it’s what I deserve! The Asili had turned me into a monster. A murderer!... It almost seems like just a bad dream - that it wasn’t really me that committed all those things... but it was... 

If you’re wondering how it was we got out of that place... I think The Asili allowed us to leave – like it wanted us to... Whatever The Asili was, it was evil! It had worshipers. Followers. It was basically a religion... Maybe it wanted us to tell the world what we’d seen and been through... Maybe it wanted more people to come here and bow to its will... Maybe I’m doing more damage than good by admitting its existence... 

We never found out what happened to Angela... I don’t even know if she’s still alive... Maybe she’s still out there somewhere, surviving... What if the tribe of women had found her? What if they weren’t the monsters Jacob said they were - that they were just survivors who fought against Lucien’s tyranny... Angela was a warrior – she knew how to survive... I’d almost like to think she became one of them... If she never escaped The Asili, like we did... I’d like to think that’s the best fate she could’ve had...  

I did my research. I tried to find whatever I could to explain what The Asili really is... I only came up with one answer... It’s the centre of evil... Evil leaks out of that place, slowly infecting the farthest corners of the world... The Congo has always been at war with itself... And anyone who goes there turns into that very same evil...  

The first white men who came to the Congo... they didn’t bring peace. They didn’t bring civilization. They murdered millions! They collected severed hands and traded them like they were currency!... Ten million Africans were murdered here when the first white men came to the Congo... But that’s what The Asili is... It isn’t the Undying Circle... It’s the Heart of Darkness itself...  

I don’t care if anyone doesn’t believe me... Just take my warning... Stay far away from the jungles of Africa! Just stay where you are and live in ignorance...   

For anyone who doesn’t listen. For whatever reason you go there, no matter how good your intentions are... take my warning... and burn it all to the ground!
