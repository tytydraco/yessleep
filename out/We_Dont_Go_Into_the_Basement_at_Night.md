I don’t remember exactly when the basement in my childhood home became dangerous. It was sometime during the summer I turned eleven but I’m not sure of an exact week or day or moment the room stopped being safe at night. The change was gradual, like milk spoiling; I wish I knew what caused the basement to go bad, or, maybe I don’t really want to know. Whatever the cause, I do remember clearly the worst night with the basement, the worst night of my life. It was June 18th, 1999. My birthday.

I guess, looking back, there were always signs that something was odd about the basement. About our whole house, really, but the basement in particular. Some days it felt bigger than on other days. The temperature never made much sense; the room could be freezing in August and sweltering in January regardless of how the rest of the house felt. Occasionally, when Emma and I still used to play down there, it would seem like someone was watching us. You know that hair-standing-up-on-your-neck feeling you get when somebody is staring at you? I always figured it was mom or dad checking in on us but now I know better.

There was a tiny cellar attached to the basement where mom used to put vegetables from our garden into mason jars to pickle. Not just cucumbers but beets and okra and even rhubarb. The cellar smelled strange though not exactly bad. More…musty. Old. Full of dust and plants shriveling in their jars. The cellar had a dirt floor and flooded the basement with the smell of wet soil after it rained.

From the age of when I was two-years-old, until I was eleven, my family lived at…well, maybe I shouldn’t tell you the exact address–I promise, you don’t want to find this place–but I will say we lived on Low Hill Road. Our house was two-stories tall with soft, white walls and a narrow chimney. It was freckled with windows, big ones that my mother loved to keep open in the summer, though dad made her keep screens in because of bugs.

My memories of the house are full of sunlight and climbing the big maple tree in the backyard with Emma. We’d help dad rake up the leaves in the fall and then chase each other through the piles, messing it all up again. Dad never cared. He would just smile and start over and mom, Emma, and I would help him.

Everything was good and bright and fine until, suddenly, it wasn’t. Dad lost his job when I was ten. He stopped smiling so much. The house even started feeling smaller, colder, and there was less light, even with summer creeping closer. Emma told me it was just my imagination but I knew she was nervous and just playing brave for me. It didn’t matter that it was pretend, though; I loved her for it all the same.

Emma was my big sister, my best friend, my lighthouse. While I took after dad, with dark-hair and blue eyes, Emma was almost a mirror copy of our mother, blonde and lovely, with a smile that had a way of spreading to everyone in the room. She was three years older than me, tall where I was short, athletic where I was a bit of a clutz, and a straight-A student since she first picked up a book. Everyone adored Emma and there were days when I envied her brilliance but only just a little. She was too kind to ever truly resent.

When mom and dad started arguing that year, Emma would let me climb into her bed at night if the yelling woke me up. She would call me, “Birdie,” because I always stared at birds when I was a baby. Then she’d read to me, usually Charlotte's Web for the hundredth time, and that would be the only way I’d be able to fall back asleep, though I never slept for long.

I was having nightmares almost every night that spring. It was always the same dream: our kitchen at night, the basement door opening, and a shadow at the bottom of the stairs. The lights were out in the basement and I couldn’t see anything well, but the shadow seemed familiar. It never said anything but I knew it wanted me to come down the stairs. I didn’t want to. When I tried to back away, I could only ever take two or three steps before something began pulling me toward the open door and the stairs.

Night after night, I woke up screaming just before I was dragged down the steps into the dark.

Emma would hold me until I calmed down. Some nights I would fall back asleep and not have the dream again. Other nights, it would happen two or three times. I didn’t get much sleep that spring, and neither did Emma.

Two weeks before my birthday, my mom started sleepwalking. At least, that was the first time any of us caught her; it’s possible she was moving around the house before that. I was nearly asleep, curled next to Emma in her bed, when I heard mom screaming downstairs. We found her in the kitchen, eyes closed, leaning against the table, shaking.

“Mom?” Emma asked.

She didn’t move or talk. I noticed that her hands were gripping the edge of the table so hard that her knuckles were white, like she was trying to keep the table from moving. Emma told me to get dad but he was gone again so it was just us. I reached for my mom’s hand but Emma stopped me.

“I don’t think we’re supposed to wake up sleepwalkers,” my sister said.

“Do you think she’s dreaming?”

“I don’t know, Birdie, maybe-”

Mom’s head jerked to the side and she screamed again, this quiet moan that grew and sharpened into a shriek. She screamed so hard she ran out of breath. I was crying, face pressed into Emma’s pajama top. When mom finally trailed off into a kind of breathless whine, Emma gently untangled herself from my grip and approached the table. Slowly, carefully, my sister took one of mom’s trembling hands. She didn’t attempt to move the hand, Emma just let her palm rest over mom’s fingers. Then Emma began saying something too soft for me to hear.

She cooed and smiled and squeezed mom’s hand. Mom shook harder and, for a terrible moment, I thought she would scream again, but then the trembling stopped all at once and she opened her eyes.

“What are you girls doing up?” she asked, drowsy, eyes half-lidded.

“We were all just going to bed,” Emma replied.

Mom nodded and tried to move but one of her hands was still gripping the table. She looked down at it, confused, then relaxed and allowed Emma to lead her out of the kitchen.

“C’mon, Birdie,” Emma said.

I followed them but took one last look at the spot where mom had been staring when she screamed. Her closed eyes had been fixed on the basement door, which also should have been closed. Emma made sure it was shut every night before we went up to bed. It was the only way I could sleep.

But that night the door was open just a sliver.

I kicked it closed before running to follow Emma and mom.

Eight days before my birthday, dad hurt himself in the basement. I was down there with him that afternoon reading on the small couch in the corner. Back then, we used the basement as part-family room, part-storage, and dad even had a small workshop set up against one wall. After losing his job, he started focusing a lot on fixing up the house. New gutters, new floors in the dining room, and it seemed like he was painting somewhere everyday. I think it made him feel good and I liked when dad was working on a project. That’s when he reminded me the most of the old him.

But that day, dad was getting frustrated. He was building Emma a bookcase; it didn’t look like it was going well. I sat in the corner reading and watching the orange light from the sunset trickle in the basement’s small, high window. I had headphones in because dad’s saw was loud. The room smelled like sawdust. Mom used to complain about me being down in the basement when dad was using his tools but he never seemed to mind and I liked being near him when he was happy.

I remember feeling a sudden chill that made me shiver and look up from my book. Dad had stopped working and was just standing still, buzzsaw limp in one hand, staring at the cellar door.

“Dad?” I asked, pulling out one headphone.

It was getting dark outside and the lights in the basement seemed low.

“Dad?” I pulled out the other headphone and stood up.

I hadn’t heard him with the earbuds in but now I could tell he was talking to himself. Mumbling, eyes locked on the cellar. It wasn’t much of a cellar, barely a glorified closet where mom could keep her jars of vegetables. You couldn’t even get in from the outside, only through the basement, and my parents usually kept the door locked so Emma and I wouldn’t play in there.

The door was open.

It wasn’t just dim in the cellar, it was absolute dark, like someone had painted a perfect black square on the basement wall. Dad was standing in front of that space; his voice was too low for me to hear clearly but I thought I heard him sob.

“Daddy?” I said, moving closer. “Are you okay?” Can we go upstairs?”

He didn’t answer but when I got near enough to touch him, I could finally make out what he was saying.

“No. You’re not there. Neither of you are there. Please. No. You’re not there. Neither of you are there. Please. No.”

He repeated that over and over, staring into the dark, shaking just like mom did in the kitchen a few days earlier.

“Daddy?” I whispered, reaching out to touch his arm.

The saw was as loud as a lion when it turned on. It was one of those buzzsaws with the circular blades and a power cord that plugged into the wall. Dad was still holding it dangling at his side when it started whirling, all of its little teeth spinning into a blur.

“Dad?”

The saw began to sway but he never took his eyes off of the cellar, never stopped mumbling to himself. I screamed the first time the tool brushed his leg. The saw bit in just above his knee, drawing a red line across his jeans. He didn’t react. Another sway and the saw touched his leg again.

“Daddy! Mom! Emma!”

The third cut looked deeper than the last two. Dad was wobbling like he was about to faint. I was terrified he might fall and land on the saw. The buzz was too loud for me to hear if my mom or sister were coming so I did the only thing I could think of; I ran for the power cord. It was in an outlet next to the cellar door. Before I unplugged it, I felt the stir of air on my leg but I was able to yank out the chord without any issues.

Dad snapped out of whatever trance he was in immediately. He took one long, confused look at his leg, then screamed. Emma raced down the stairs at the same time, mom only a step behind her. The next hour was a fog of towels and blood and a trip to the hospital. Dad got lucky; he ended up with two shallow cuts and one a bit deeper into the meat of his thigh. All told, the accident led to thirty-five stitches, one evening in the ER, and a bill that seemed to hurt my dad the most out of everything.

We got home around one in the morning. Emma and I helped dad get set up on the couch while mom went to clean-up the basement.

“Leave it until morning, Susan,” dad said.

“I don’t want the blood to stain the carpet or-”

“Leave it,” dad snapped. He saw the way all three of us flinched and softened his voice. “Please, Susan, it’s late. Get some sleep. I should be okay with the stairs so I’ll get it tomorrow. It’s my blood after all.”

Mom nodded but seemed shaken by his outburst. She went to the bathroom while Emma and I brought blankets to the couch. Dad caught my hand when I came back.

“Thank you, Birdie,” he said. “I don’t know what caused my…episode, but I do know I’d be short a leg if you hadn’t acted so quickly.”

I blushed and Emma kissed the top of my hair.

“Birdie the hero,” she said.

Dad smiled but the smile didn’t last.

“Girls, I need you to promise me that you’ll stay out of the basement,” he said.

“But that’s where I go to read,” I protested. “I shouldn’t be punished. You said I did good.”

Dad winced. “You’re not being punished. You didn’t do anything wrong. It’s just that I’m not sure the basement is safe.”

“What’s dangerous about it?” Emma asked.

“I…I don’t know,” dad admitted. “I mean, nothing is dangerous, it’s just a basement, but…okay, at least stay out of the basement at night, okay? Promise me.”

“Why?” Emma asked.

“Just promise.” Dad’s voice was quiet but sharp so we both swore we wouldn’t go into the basement after dark.

We kept our promise until Charlotte got into the basement on my birthday later that month. Charlotte was a brown rabbit, a gift from Emma the day before I turned eleven.

“I know your birthday is tomorrow but I couldn’t wait,” Emma told me when she gave me Charlotte and a big pen. “Dad’s working on a hutch so she can stay outside when the weather is nice but, for now, Charlotte can stay in your room.”

I fell in love with Charlotte immediately. She was small, with auburn fur and a curious way of running her paw over her nose. Emma and I spent the entire day playing with the bunny in my room, letting her hop around freely while feeding her lettuce. Mom and dad came and checked on us now and again. They both seemed happier than I’d seen either of them in a long time. Dad was working on building Charlotte’s hutch in the backyard. He’d relocated most of his tools from the basement to the shed after his accident.

While Emma or I might pop down into the basement during the day to raid the pantry or grab a board game or read in a quiet corner, dad avoided the room entirely. He even installed a new latch that he locked every night. When mom asked him why, dad just said he was worried about animals getting in through the cellar at night.

Mom seemed confused but she didn’t push. I’m sure all of us felt the strange discomfort radiating from the basement, from my nightmares, mom’s sleepwalking, and dad’s accident. I tried to push all of that out of my mind ahead of my birthday and the hours I spent watching Charlotte bop around my bedroom finally let me relax. The rabbit was docile and gentle; she ate lettuce out of my hand from that first day. But Charlotte was also clever or maybe the pen that Emma gave me had a defect. Either way, when I woke up in the middle of the night from one of my dragging dreams, I saw that Charlotte’s cage was empty and I ran to Emma in a panic.

It was late, past midnight, so Emma and I crept around the house, whispering for Charlotte, trying not to wake up mom and dad. We went through the upstairs carefully but there was no sign of the rabbit. Charlotte wasn’t in the living room or the dining room either. When we went into the kitchen, Emma froze.

“Did you hear that?” she asked.

“Hear what?”

“Quiet. Listen.”

Scratch. Scratch. Scratch.

There was a faint scraping sound coming from the other side of the basement door.

“Birdie, look.”

Emma pointed to the latch on the door. Dad padlocked it every night but, for some reason, that night it was open. I saw the lock on the floor nearby, like it had fallen off.

“Maybe dad forgot?” I said. We heard more scratching. “Emma, it’s got to be Charlotte.”

I started for the door but Emma grabbed my shoulder.

“We’re not allowed. Let’s get mom and dad. They’ll look.”

The scratching grew louder, frantic. Then there was a whimper.

I pulled free from Emma. “She might be hurt.”

The basement door swung open easily, like someone was pushing from the other side. I looked down, expecting to see Charlotte at the top of the stairs. Instead, everything was black, so dark it seemed solid.

“Char…Charlotte?” I whispered.

“Birdie, come back,” Emma called.

I turned toward her but before I could say anything, something cold grabbed my ankle and yanked. The basement stairs were carpeted but still battered me as I fell. I hit my head at some point; while I didn’t quite blackout, everything got foggy for a minute.

“Birdie, Birdie, wake up,” Emma whispered

I opened my eyes to see my sister bending over me. Her eyes were wide and darting around. She looked terrified. My first thought was that I was hurt worse than I realized.

“Emma?”

Her eyes snapped to me. She held a finger to her lips.

“Quiet. Someone’s in here.”

I sat up, wincing. I knew I’d find more than a few bruises from my fall. We were at the bottom of the basement stairs. The room was dim but not nearly as dark as it had looked from the kitchen. There was something strange about the lights, like they were washed out, making everything look a little gray and cast deep shadows. Because the lighting was so different, it took me a moment to realize that the entire basement was wrong. It was much, much larger than it should have been, at least four or five times its normal size.

All of the furniture was different, too. It was almost our furniture but slightly off. The couch was smaller and red instead of gray but otherwise the same design. It stood away from its usual spot on the wall, almost in the middle of the floor. The chairs had legs that were just a little too long and the bookshelf in the corner was too wide and squat. There were paintings and posters hung on the walls but the light made it difficult to see them clearly. I was glad I couldn’t. What I could see made me uncomfortable.

“Birdie, we need to go upstairs,” Emma whispered. “Now. Before he notices us.”

“Who?”

Emma didn’t answer. She pointed at the couch. I stared, unsure what I was looking for, and then I screamed when I saw it.

The top of a bald, pale man’s head crept up over the back of the couch. He stopped so that everything below his eyes was hidden. Those eyes were staring at us. While I couldn’t see his mouth, I was sure he was smiling.

“Mom! Dad! Mommy!” I yelled.

The eyes were locked on me and the bald head began to tremble. I realized he was laughing, the sound raspy. It turned into a scratch, just like I’d heard when looking for Charlotte. Then the whimper trailed back into the laugh.

“Run,” Emma said, dragging me up the stairs.

The basement door was still open and I could see the kitchen, bright with all of the lights that we’d left on. We half-stumbled, half-sprinted up the stairs. My breath was wheezing when Emma finally stopped. No matter how fast we climbed, we never got any closer to the door.

“Emma, what’s happening?”

My sister was breathing hard and shaking, but still held my hand. “I don’t know, Birdie. I don’t know. Maybe we’re dreaming.”

I looked back down the stairs. There was no sign of the bald man. “I don’t think we’re dreaming.”

“No, probably not. But either way, it doesn’t look like we can get out this way.”

As if to punctuate the point, the basement door began slowly closing. This sparked another round of mad climbing from us with the same result. We got no closer to the door and now it was darker on the stairwell. I looked into the basement again and gasped. The man was still out of sight but now the couch was noticeably closer to the bottom of the stairs.

“Emma, look.”

“It’s okay. We’re going to be okay,” she promised but her hand was shaking as bad as mine.

“Mom and dad must have heard us, right?” I asked.

“Yep. They must have. Look at me Birdie, don’t cry, it’s okay. They’re probably coming down right now. We just need to-”

There was an awful screech. In the moment that Emma and I were looking at each other, the couch had moved again, now barely ten or so feet from the bottom of the stairs.

“Birdie, I think we need to move,” Emma whispered. “Just follow me when I say ‘go’ and then you go as fast as you can, okay?”

“Where are we going?”

“Just follow me. Go.”

Emma ran, pulling me along. We went downstairs this time and hit the basement at a dead sprint. She led me past the couch. I made the mistake of looking back in time to see the man’s head peeking over the back. He watched us but didn’t come out.

We ran and ran for what felt like minutes. The basement seemed never-ending. Sometimes we were running on carpet, other times hardwood, and at least once some kind of tile, but we weren’t making progress. Eventually, panting, we stopped. The basement stairs were far away, so we had been moving, at least. The red couch was also barely in sight. For the first time since falling down the stairs, I felt some of the tension leave my body.

Something stood up behind the couch. With the washed out lighting and the distance, I couldn’t make out any details but the thing was the size and shape of a man, pale as those fish deep in the ocean where the sun couldn’t reach. It began walking toward us, then running on two legs before dropping to four like an animal.

I screamed for our mom and dad again. Emma tugged on my hand and we were racing away again. Every time I looked back, the thing was closer but the basement was getting darker every second. I spotted the cellar door.

I let go of my sister’s hand and went for the door. “Emma, let’s hide.”

“Wait!”

I didn’t listen; I was nearing hysterics at that point and it just kept getting darker. The thing was breathing heavily behind us, almost panting. I opened the door and immediately gagged. The smell was horrible. It reminded me of going to the dump with my dad in the summer. If the bins were full, you had to drive up this hill to drop off your trash directly. In the August sun, the stench would be like tear gas, the slow rot of discarded food and dirt and mold.

The smell coming from the cellar was like that but so much worse. I tried to push the door closed but something on the other side pushed back and it was stronger than I was. The door was creaking open until Emma threw herself against it. We both struggled and, for a moment, it seemed like we were going to close the cellar. Then a thin, bone-white arm snaked through the narrow opening and grabbed my wrist. More hands followed, grabbing at me and ripping at my hair. I yelled and Emma came to help, prying off pale fingers with dirty nails, even biting them when they wouldn’t let loose.

Between the two of us, we were able to get me untangled, and I stumbled back from the cellar. Emma took one step toward me before a hand latched onto her hair and pulled her back. Without us pushing it closed, the door swung open and dozens of hands reached out for Emma. Her eyes were locked on mine; she tried to say something but a dirty hand covered her mouth. More and more latched onto her, dragging her into the darkness of the cellar.

The door slammed closed and everything around me changed. The lights were once again our dull but normal basement lights. The furniture was familiar and the walls were exactly where they were supposed to be. I was in our basement facing the cellar door.

Emma shrieked from the other side of the door. It was a terrible sound, like she was in unbearable pain.

“Emma,” I shouted, opening the door.

My sister wasn’t in there, only shelves filled with mason jars.

“Mom! Dad!” I yelled. “Help. Help.”

I felt an unbelievable wave of relief when I heard them coming. They came down the basement stairs, still in their pajamas, and found me crying hysterically, closing and opening the cellar door again and again. I tried to tell them that something took Emma, that we needed to find her, but I was barely coherent, sobbing so violently that my dad scooped me up and ran with me up the stairs.

They wanted to drive me to the hospital but I refused to get into the car. Instead, we sat on the couch until I had calmed down enough to speak. I gave them a short version of everything that happened since I woke up to find Charlotte missing: Emma helping me search the house, the sounds in the basement, falling down the stairs, the man behind the couch, and the hands in the cellar pulling Emma into the dark.

My parents shared a look.

“Who is Emma?” my mom asked.

I couldn’t speak for a moment.

“Emma,” I said, after recovering. “Emma Emma. My sister. We have to find her. You have to go get her. Please.”

“Kiddo, I think you might have hit your head pretty good in your fall,” my dad said. “You don’t have a sister. You’re our one and only.”

“Do you think she has a concussion?” my mom asked my dad. “Let me get you an ice pack for that bump,” she said to me.

I felt like I was going to throw up. I looked around the room, which was full of family pictures, and saw that Emma was gone from all of them. Something in my mind finally snapped and I fell apart. Screaming, sobbing, tearing at my hair; my parents ended up needing to call an ambulance because I was too violent to take in the car. The paramedics sedated me and, when I woke up, I was in the hospital.

The next few weeks were a blur. They kept me confined and medicated for three or four days until I stopped constantly screaming for Emma. There was a series of doctors and therapists and mom even asked a priest to visit, even though we only really went to church on Christmas and Easter. None of them believed my story about the basement and everyone insisted that Emma never existed. That she was an imaginary friend.

When my parents finally took me home, I tore through the basement, inch-by-inch. There was no sign of Emma there or anywhere in the house. I did find Charlotte, though, back in her hutch. When I asked my mom where they found her, she told me that the rabbit had never left the cage at all, she’d just buried herself in the wood shavings and blended in so well I didn’t see her. They’d been feeding her while I was in the hospital.

“We tried telling you once or twice,” my dad said, “but you were, eh, well, it was tough to communicate with all of the medications and visitors.”

I sobbed, holding Charlotte close. She was proof.

“Emma gave me the rabbit. Emma is real.”

“No sweetie, your mom got you the bunny,” my dad said.

My mom gave him a confused look. “I thought you got her Charlotte?”

“See?” I said. “It was Emma. It was Emma.”

They both seemed foggy for a moment but shook it off.

“Actually, I think we both picked our Charlotte,” my mom said.

“Yeah,” dad replied. “We were at that place by the mall and, uh, yeah, we got the rabbit.”

That brought on another panic attack. Another trip to the doctor. Another night in a medicated daze because benzodiazepine and risperidone were the only things that could give me a dreamless sleep.

After that second episode, I learned not to talk about Emma in front of my parents. Once I was released again, I began quietly, secretly looking for any evidence my sister existed. Her friends didn’t remember her, neither did her teachers. There were no pictures of her, no trail, no signs at all. But I never doubted my memories of Emma. They were too complete, too real, and there were so, so many.

About a month after Emma’s disappearance, I had the dragging dream again. I woke up and snuck downstairs to the basement. Dad still locked it up every night, but that night the lock had fallen off again. I heard scratching behind the door. My hands were trembling as I reached for the knob. Emma was down there that night, I’m sure of it. I could find her, maybe bring her back, but even if I couldn’t and I was trapped, at least I’d be with my sister. At least she wouldn’t be alone.

The scratching turned into whimpering when I touched the door. I tried as hard as I could but my hand refused to turn the knob. I kept picturing the thing behind the couch, the arms in the cellar, the reeking smell, and Emma’s agonized scream. I couldn’t go back down there.

The whimpering turned into rasping laughter as I backed away from the door and followed me as I ran to get my parents. I woke them up and brought them down to the basement even though I knew in my heart that my chance was gone. The lock was back on the latch and the basement was just a basement when my dad opened the door.

Another breakdown. A third hospital stay.

My crisis was getting expensive. We had one bit of good luck that year when dad found a great job. The only problem was that it required us moving across the state. I protested at first but, secretly, I was glad to go, glad to get away from that basement. After the night I couldn’t open the door, I did my best to listen to my parents and the therapists. I tried to convince myself that maybe Emma really was just an imaginary friend, a make-believe big sister that I’d invented.

But I never truly accepted that fiction.

My childhood was a fog of antidepressants and antipsychotics. My adolescence came with new forms of self-medication, drinking myself to sleep, pills, powders, pipes, needles; anything that could give me a dreamless sleep. I spent my entire life running away from that night in 1999. I even stopped celebrating my birthday…though I never failed to buy flowers for the house on Emma’s birthday.

Oh Emma, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I don’t know whether you’re dead or alive but I do know that you are real. That you were always there for me. That you saved me. And I spent a lifetime trying to forget you because I was too afraid to remember.

I’ve wondered for years what was in that basement. At first, I thought maybe it was always there, sleeping, waiting for our family to be hurt and vulnerable. But now I know the truth. Whatever happened in our basement was caused by a hungry, wandering thing. An evil that creeps in and takes over. An infection. An infestation.

I know that, now, because last night, I found a door in my kitchen where no door should be. My current house, where I live alone, has no basement. None of the houses in my area do. We’re too close to the ocean. But somehow, the basement door that I remember so vividly from my childhood is here, now, even as I write this. I can hear the faintest scratching. It’s found me after all of these years.

Good.

Emma, I’m sorry I’ve left you down in the dark for so many years. I’m sorry I wasn’t braver. I’m sorry I didn’t try to save you. But I will tonight. Or I’ll disappear with you.

Either way, no more running. [See you soon, Emma.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grand_Theft_Motto/comments/1ne7y1f/story_notes_we_dont_go_into_the_basement_at_night/)
