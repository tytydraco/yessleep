What follows is a True story of my experience of a local haunted road near me called Prim Rose.

It was a beautiful Indiana summer, 80 degrees, light breeze and blue skies smeared with white fluffy clouds. We were all teenagers, all 16 except for dylan who was younger then us he was 14. Luke was the only one with a car so we would spend the whole day driving around in his car going random places like teenagers with new found freedom do. We went to the mall and walked around daring each other to talk to girls and messing around with displays and window shopping. Then ended the evening with beefy 5 layers at taco bell. As the night came to a close we all sat in Dylans room talking about what we wanted to do and how we should spend the summer.  
“Have you guys ever heard of Kelly road?” Said Garry  
“Yeah that junkyard, the guy that owns that place is crazy and threw a rock at someones car before, Im not driving there.” Luke lazily muttered, staring at the ceiling laying in bed.  
“Well we should do something tonight, its such a nice day.” I said.  
“What about Prim Rose?” Dylan said menacingly.  
“Whats that?” Luke sat up interested in some place new.  
“I dunno, its this road I heard about out in the woods…. Suppose to be hunted or something” Dylan said while looking at maps on his computer “I know how to get there, its only like 30 minutes away off the bypass.”

“Hunted? That’s stupid what is suppose to be there ghost?” Gary scoffed

“Supposedly there used to be an old church out there, they say cult stuff happen out there, and I read about something called Blood Rock, a rock where someone’s baby drowned at”

“Sounds spooky we should go at midnight make it scary oohhhh”  
We all gathered around the pc looking at mapquest, looking over how to get there and continued joking about what we would do when we got there.

As Midnight approached we all piled into lukes red camaro, it only had two doors so two of us had to squeeze in the back. We brought a flash light, a camera, and a can of mace. Never know, might come in handy. We sped down the highway as we left the city and headed out into a increasingly sparsely populated  area.  Along the highway it turned into just trees and a street light here and there, the darkness hung down like a dark curtain, it was a very dark night. As you turn off the highway we passed by an old gas station that looked like it had been out of service for years, at the light there was a couple farm houses. We took a left and drove down a long winding road with trees on either side and a house every so often. The road took a long wide left turn then went up a long hill, so large you couldn’t see up ahead  
“I think we are here, it is the next left turn..” Dylan quietly said, turning down the radio and eyes wide peering out the windows.

As we came to the crest of the hill we saw an old dingy yellow arrow sign with bullet holes in it pointing left and right. To the right it led to an open road with wide open corn fields on either side and a farm house off in the distance. To the left was a fierce sum sight. Prim rose road in all its glory. The road was surrounded by thick woods that hung around the road in a perfect tunnel shape, it looked like the woods was attempting to swallow the gravel road. It was a straight hill down into darkness, so dark all we could see in the car headlights were the gnarled twisting trees that were so thick you could barely see the sky. The foliage on the ground was even thick. Living in Indiana seeing untamed woods was pretty normal but this seemed different, it seemed jungle like, unwelcoming. The sudden sight of the trees strangling out the sky above was jarring.

“Wow, that is a creepy ass road!” Gary exclaimed from the backseat.  
“Man I don’t know about this, I didn’t know it was a dirt road I don’t-“ Luke said but was cut off by boos from the rest of us. “Come on man we are already here, lets at least drive down it once” I said.  
 Attached are photos during the day, even during the day the sight is unsettling.

“Well you guys ready?” Luke yelled as he peeled off drifting around the corner. The sudden take off was exilerating and we all laughed with glee, as teenagers with no regard for safety. We got about ten feet into the gravel road when suddenly we were all blinded by headlights.  
“OH SHIT” Luke whipped the car to the side as a old white chevy truck came flying past us, going so fast we didn’t even see the occupants or even see it as it passed us and disappeared in the nights dark embrace in our mirrors.  
“holy shit what the fuck was that dude??”I said

“I don’t know I didn’t even see them I swear to god, what the fuck was that idiot doing” Luke gasped

“I didn’t even see them, they must have been checking out prim rose too” Dylan said grimly.

After a silence Gary exclaimed “Fucking pussies” We all laughed nervously.

“Turn your brights on lets see whats ahead.” I said.  
Luke flipped the brights on, the long gravel road seemed to snake on forever, with the trees never breaking for the moonlight to shine through. The headlights seemed like two long white poles piercing through the darkness. The road went down a hill then snaked to the right at the bottom of the hill about 70 yards a head of us. Luke slowly put the car into gear and let it idle down the hill while we all scanned the deep woods surrounding us, taking turns pointlessly shining the flashlight into the unwavering darkness. After the truck almost hit us we were all on a swivel looking for anything moving.  
 “Doesn’t seem that scary just some woods..” Dylan said smugly.

The gravel crackled under the tires and the sound seemed to bounce around the darkness, we the windows down except for Luke he refused to roll his window down more then a crack. Being in the back seat of a two door Gary and I had to crane our heads over the shoulders of the front seats to see out. As the car slowly rolled along we reached the bottom of the hill and the road started its long turn right. Another picture of the road.

“Lets get out and Look around.” I said

“No way dude Im not getting hit” Luke said nervously.  
“Come on dude don’t be scared, want me to hold your hand” Gary said as he pushed the seat release and pushed his way out the door. Gary and I stepped out of the car almost instantly feeling small and realizing how dark it was being out of the safety of the car.

“Wow This is Definity the sticks.” I said shining the flashlight into the woods and looking above us to only see trees.

“Yeah heh” Gary said from the other side of the car, also feeling suddenly not so brave in the darkness.  
“So since you guys are so brave hope you are ready” Yelled Luke. Before I knew it he peeled out again taking off down the road. Suddenly leaving Gary and I in the dark.  
“FUCKING ASSHOLE!” Gary screamed running after him

Luke even turned the car lights off to scare us even more and it worked. My flashlight seemed so much smaller without the lights of the car illuminating the area around us.

Gary and I took off running after the car as I ran next to Gary I grabbed him and tried to pull him into the woods just messing around.  
“STOP IT DUDE” He gasped while running.  
I laughed and got an idea, I ran as fast as I could into the woods. I was always athletic and could run very fast. I felt confident that I could out run any shadows here. I could hear Gary yell for me as I jumped into the woods and ran through the darkness as fast as I could, keeping the flashlight trained on the ground so I didn’t fall. The woods were very deep, till they suddenly weren’t. I ran about 20 yards into the right of the road into the woods to suddenly jump out the foliage into a large clearing. I stopped for a second and swang the flashlight back and forth looking at my surroundings. It was a complete circle cleared out in the thick of the woods and I could see what looked like what was left of a demolition of a building. Stone bricks and a mostly buried foundation with a trail heading deeper into the woods.  
What the hell is this? I wondered to myself. I could suddenly see needles of white piercing through the woods, luke had turned the car toward the woods and turned the lights back on they were calling my name. As I started walking back I kept the flashlight swinging toward the opposite side of the clearing. Was this the church Dylan read online about? I could suddenly feel my hair stand on end and could almost swear I saw something shining the light of my flashlight back I instantly took off back toward the road. The darkness will play tricks on your mind, you will make shapes in the black depths when there is nothing there. Regardless I was not going to find out there is coyotes out here and I was not about to be a mangy mutts night time snack. I raced back to the car, as I broke out of the brush onto the road I could see the car and Gary standing next to the driver door, with his hand resting on top of the open door, reassuring himself that Luke was not going to take off without him again.  
“What the hell man, where did you go?” Dylan yelled.  
“I just ran into the woods a little bit, I think I found the church!”  
“NO WAY? Its real?” Dylan exclaimed. “Well I mean its something, definitely a building but there isn’t much left of it, wanna see it?”  
“No way, I am not going in there” “What are you scared of some deer?” I sneered. I knew I was scared to go back too though. Even though I wasn’t sure, the thought of seeing something in the dark lingered in the back of my mind.  
“Wow look” Dylan said from still inside the car pointing down the road to the left.  
The tree line seemed to break and there was an opening in thick trees, looking out over what seemed to be a large swamp. I later found out this is called Mud Lake, many people have drowned in this lake due to the mud being more then ten feet deep and it would swallow anyone who dared to venture out in it. Below is a picture of the spot I am talking about.

“This is where blood rock is. Supposedly there is a rock out there that bleeds. A long time ago some womens baby walked out there and drowned so she killed herself on the rock out there….” Dylan said grimly.

Suddenly we heard a blood curdling scream of a woman crying out. We all jumped and immediately clamoured on the car. Luke Reved the car but it wasn’t in gear.  
“Chill out everyone!!!” Yelled Dylan…..  
“Oh my god…… it was the fucking radio…” Luke said turning the CD player off…. There was an avenged sevenfold CD in and it suddenly started playing and it was paused on the track Scream, which has a loud scream at the start.  
“Wow heh that was weird…..” said Gary  
“God damn it turn that off” I said laughing nervously as one does when they are still scared but cant control their reaction..  
Gary was standing at the front of the car and I was standing on the driver side.  
“Don’t look guys I gotta take a leak” I said looking out over the clearing.

I unzipped my pants and started relieving myself, “ FUCK YOU PRIM ROSE” I screamed out into the clearing “ FUCK YOU STUPID OLD LADY AND FUCK YOUR BABY, YALL PROBABLY DESERVED IT” I screamed wildly.

I don’t know why I did that, something about the excitement maybe I was screaming into the dark to pointlessly make myself not so afraid but it was in vain. I Quickly regretted what I did.

As I zipped my pants up and turned back toward the car I saw it. In the darkness I heard the crack of branches and sticks and the stomping in the ground. I could see the bushes on the opposite side moving and parting in two as something raced toward us.  
“WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT!!!!” Gary screamed.

“GET IN GET IN” Luke frantically screamed. I jumped into the driver side window, hanging half out and Garry jumped on the hood gripping the top slit of the hood with all his might as Luke Threw the car into gear and took off. We were flying down the road. Luckly we were in a Camero and not much could catch it. Luke punched the car maybe about 40 yards and slowly stopped so Gary didn’t go flying off.  
“GET IN GET IN GET IN” Luke screamed. Gary ran around and jumped through the same window I had wriggled through and we all sat in grim silence as Luke raced us down the Gravel road. At the end of the road to our relief it suddenly opens up to reveal cornfields and the sky, the wonderful luminous moonlight filled sky, and a barn was off in the distance with a stale green bug light on the porch.  
“Did you see that” I panted looking from one friend to another.  
“I  don’t know what it was I heard it and saw the bushes part open and jumped on the hood.” Garry said.

As we drove away I stared back at the cornfield that meets the woods and could see green eyes of what I hoped were deers reflecting in the moonlight.

We all told ourselves it was just a deer jumping through the bushes at us, but I knew better. I was facing toward it. It was much bigger then a deer and I saw the bushes literally part, as if someone was reaching through them. We never went back to Prim Rose and that day I learned to respect the dead, even if it was just stories because you never know.
