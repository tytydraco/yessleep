It started three weeks ago. I was flipping through the radio stations during my late-night drive home from work. I’d been stuck in the office far longer than usual, and the empty highway was making me restless.

I stopped on a station that wasn’t quite tuned in. Static crackled through the speakers, but underneath it, I could swear I heard a faint voice. I thought it was just interference, so I left it on, waiting for the signal to clear.

But it didn’t.

Instead, the voice grew louder. Not clearer, just… louder. It wasn’t talking, exactly. It was like someone was whispering over static, their words indistinct but urgent. The sound made my skin crawl, so I turned the dial to another station and didn’t think much of it.

Until the next night.

I was driving home again, and the same thing happened. Static. Whispering. This time, I didn’t stop on the station, but even as I flipped through others, the whispers stayed. Faint, almost imperceptible, but there.

I turned off the radio and drove in silence, my heart pounding. When I got home, I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone had been in the car with me.

By the end of the week, the whispers weren’t just on the radio. They were in my TV. In my phone. Hell, I even heard them through the baby monitor when I was at my sister’s house babysitting.

And they were getting clearer.

I started hearing my name.

I didn’t want to tell anyone—I mean, how do you explain that? “Hey, do you ever feel like your electronics are talking to you?” But after a while, it got so bad that I broke down and told my coworker, Jenny.

She laughed it off at first, but then she froze. “Wait,” she said. “Are you serious? Because… I’ve been hearing weird stuff too. Not voices, but like… static. At random times. In places it shouldn’t be.”

We spent the rest of the day trying to convince each other it was just a coincidence. But when I went home that night, I didn’t turn on the radio, or the TV, or anything. I just sat in the dark, trying to ignore the faint crackle coming from the outlets in my walls.

The first real words came last night.

I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, when the whispers started again. I didn’t bother trying to figure out where they were coming from—it could’ve been the lamp, or the smoke detector, or even my phone, which was powered off but still managed to emit a faint hum.

The words were garbled at first, but then one sentence came through, clear as day:

“Do you remember what you did?”

My blood turned to ice.

“I didn’t do anything,” I whispered back, feeling like an idiot for talking to static. But then it responded:

“You will.”

I didn’t sleep. I spent the whole night pacing my apartment, unplugging everything I could think of. I even turned off the breaker. But the static didn’t stop.

And now it’s everywhere. I hear it in my car, in the coffee shop, at work. The whispers follow me wherever I go, growing louder, more persistent. Jenny told me yesterday that she’s been hearing them too, and now they’re saying her name.

“Maybe it’s some kind of signal,” she said. “Like a broadcast that only certain people can hear.”

But that doesn’t explain the dreams.

Last night, I dreamt of a field. It stretched on forever, the grass blackened and dead, and the sky filled with white noise. In the middle of the field stood a figure—a person, but not quite. Their body flickered, like a poorly tuned channel, and when they turned to face me, I woke up screaming.

I didn’t tell Jenny about the dream. But when I saw her this morning, she looked pale, her hands trembling as she held her coffee. “I think it’s coming for me,” she said.

I asked her what she meant, but she just shook her head. “I had a dream. There was a field…”

That’s when I knew. It wasn’t just me. Whatever this was, it was spreading.

And now, as I’m typing this, the static is louder than it’s ever been. My screen flickers, the words on the page glitching and reforming before my eyes. The whispers are no longer whispers—they’re shouts, screams, laughter. They’re everywhere, all at once, filling my apartment with a deafening roar.

The last thing I hear before everything goes silent is my name.

And then:


“We’re here.”
