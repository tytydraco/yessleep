He suggested we go to a beach for our first year anniversary. Turtle Beach, which had earned its name from the amount of turtles which arose from the waters in the 1800s. It was a huge beach, with hundreds on hundreds of people on it, which was big considering its locality. Even though it was nearby, it still felt romantic. I couldn't explain it, but something just drew me to it. 



He told me he would be back, and he left to take a quick swim in the water. It was then I heard it. Screams. I looked behind my shoulder and saw a group of people staring over something, and when I moved past them to look, I witnessed a man upside down with his head in the sand, and his back, and his body arched so far back it looked as though his spine snapped in reverence. No one ran. Everyone just looked at the man, dead in the sand.



Close to me, I saw a woman with two children shielding their eyes, unable to look away, and the children saw through the separations in her fingers as well. Everyone was horrified, and one man stepped a little closer to the corpse. After a while, the sand opened up and enveloped the body, swallowing it. It grabbed and ripped the man’s foot off as well. And this time, the crowd screamed even louder and ran around the beach, but not out. 



Eventually, after more grueling silence, the woman I previously saw got on her knees and dug like a dog, and for about a minute, everyone stood there shocked at her behavior. Finally, the hole was deep, and she placed her head in it. The sand then filled up the space empty space and buried her head, and she was upright, doing a headstand. After a minute of staying there, she fell back, and I heard a *crack*. Then, her children did the same and I heard the *crack* there too. The beach was in chaos. 



I looked over to my boyfriend in the water, and in the shallow part, I could count around twenty bodies upside down. Among one of the feet was his snake tattoo, and I cried hysterically while running across the beach. Suddenly, his body and a few others were swallowed rapidly into the water. As I was running, a boy in front of me burrowed his head in the sand and it filled in his head so that it was fully under it. That was all I got to see before I ran past. 



Suddenly, I stopped. All felt peaceful. I got on my knees and dug, placed my head in the sand. Then the hole was filled up with sand and I was forced to stay upright. After a few minutes, I dropped and I felt a horrible crack in my spine. And before I knew it, the sand enveloped my torso and arms, then my legs, and years later, I’m still here.
