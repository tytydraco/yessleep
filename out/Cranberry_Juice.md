Living out of a small village has been both a significant blessing and almost damning curse. 300 people thrive in this village as lumbermen, plumbers, lawyers, and 3 policemen. There is no overarching reason this village exists, only that some people long ago lived here and their descendants never thought it necessary to leave. We have a school- more akin to a daycare- where preschool children can learn how to color in the lines and sound out letters in 5 letter long words. Any form of higher education exists a 40 minute bus ride away to the nearest town with an elementary, middle, and high school. Every morning 50 kids gather on the side of the lone tarred road running parallel to the village and wait for the bus. 

I watch them as they board the vessel and occasionally wave as I sip my morning juice. The school bus driver is the only person who originally from the village who has moved out in the past 90 years and with her leave she spared herself more than she’d ever comprehended. 

I killed her mother the year before she left, when she was 12. I strangled her on the plush pink rug laid over the carpet of the living room. Embarrassingly, she lived through the initial session of strangulation due to my sloppy technique. I used to use a box cutter, but variety is the spice of life. I only wish I had practiced beforehand. I couldn’t find the daughter, and I distinctly remember chuckling to myself and slapping my forehead when I read the paper about how she had hid behind the water heater. “Jeez, I knew that looked like a leg. Ha.” The juice was extra bitter that morning. 

I am not a lumberman, or a lawyer, or anything like that. I make juice. I sell my juice out of the local market for 5 dollars per 30oz jar of juice. I have no overhead so it’s all profit; not that that means much in a village so small all money is in one big loop of hand off. Carrot, apple, and grape are the best sellers but the one I get the most compliments on is my cranberry juice. It is hand pressed, spiced, and bottled over 4 days. I let it lightly ferment, giving it a low but satisfying alcohol content. 

I would never tell anyone this, for obvious reasons, but the cranberry juice is my favorite to make. This would come as a shock to June at the market or Marleen at the daycare because I like to say I love all my juices the same, but it's a lie. Cranberry is far and away my favorite.

My house is one of 4 houses in the Village with a basement which I used to ferment the spices and berries used to make my famous cranberry juice. I have 3 spices currently fermenting, and only 1 day left until they start to smell so I’ll be making juice tonight. Traper, a lumberman who went missing in the woods a week ago and presumed dead; the woods are dangerous after all: The Bear is out there. Margret, a frail old lady who vanished from her home a few days ago, she had dementia of course and wandered off into the woods, forgetting The Bear is out there. And lastly Nattalie. 

Nattlie was going to attend her first day of Kindergarten 4 days ago, but while waiting for the bus she heard a noise in the woods and got too curious. She knew about The Bear, but The Bear knows little girls love candies and offered some back at his home, lollipops, gumdrops, candy bars; even extras to give to her classmates. I loved her so much. She was pudgy, soft, well-fed. I like the big ones, they have more spice to add to the juice and the flavors they produce as they ferment are so decadent. No offense to the skinner folks, you ferment wonderfully too, but your flavors will never be as someone heavy set like Nattlie. 

I understand how this sounds and no, I don’t see the kids I take like *that*, silly. I promise that fact, that I don’t see them as prey. It’d be rude to call them prey, and I’d rather die than be rude to such lovely things. They’re achievements, victories; ones I’m more proud of than any other.

I’m not dim so I’m aware enough to see the insanity here: I haven’t even told you how I make my juice yet. I truly do apologize. The 3 below are too recent, so I’ll tell you about Jakey. 

Jakey would be 32 now, but his age stopped at 9. The Bear cooed him into the woods with the promise of candy- candy never ceases to work- and experimented with him. It was my first try using a garrote wire. Jakey was such a messy ordeal; that’s partially why I mention it- humility is the key to joy. His fat little neck took so much extra sawing even after working through an inch of fatty tissue he was still working to scream against the ground. Gosh, I had to stomp on his head- with my regular sneaker mind you- just to get him to shut up long enough for me to saw the rest of the way through his neck. My ankle was so darn sore after that, I had a damned limp for a week! Jakey is in my top 5. The kill was manic, but the draining, fermenting, and spicing went so well; mostly because he was already mostly drained by the time I got him home. He had a little left so I hung him from his feet for the hooks and let him drain out for a day. Once his loose little, morbidly obese, body was drained dry, I turned the heat up in the basement and let him start fermenting. 

Febreez is the love of my life- aside from Ruth- it knocks the scent of decay right out. Decay, not death, I must add. The scent of death requires essential oils, but I rarely let spices ferment that long. Once he was nicely bloated and juicy, well spiced, I laid him out on my table and removed the flavorful organs. Intestines, stomach, liver, and parts of the fattiest tissues are the best. Once removed I add them to the cranberry juice. It ferments further in there for at least 24 hours, but not longer than 48. After that, it is strained through 3 progressively finer mesh filters until it is spotless. Once it’s clean, I bottle it in 20 oz, 30 oz, and 50 oz jars and sell it for $2.50, $5, and $6.50. Once it’s sold, I get my compliments. I usually keep a gallon for myself and sip on it while I people-watch in the morning. 

About a month ago Ruth moved back home and almost instantly I began to talk to her, chatting her up as it goes. She’s 21 now and I’m almost 40 but she liked me, she really liked me! As of last night, she invited me over for dinner. I dressed myself up to the nines as they say and brought only my hands in my pockets.

She had made lasagne and it was simply divine; the wine she paired with it which I loathed but kept it to myself. The house was candle lit and I suspected she’d want to go to the bedroom after the meal. I was trying to think of a way to excuse myself from anything like that, intimacy like that isn’t for me. I get the appeal, but I’ve never found it enjoyable. I supposed that might ruin the night, but thankfully she ruined it first.

She pulled a knife from the table and tried to stab me; I almost let her, feeling so hurt by the fact all this lovely meal was just front to kill me and for what? Strangling her mother? Grow up. I really did love her, I wouldn't have hurt her, I would rather die than hurt her. But she swung first. I caught and broke her wrist, then slammed her face into the table top. She went so limp and fell funny enough to make me giggle before I got on top of her and started choking her out. Her pink lips quivered and her face turned a shade just like that of her mother’s. I crushed her wind pipe then pulled away and watched her slowly die. She squirmed and kicked, especially as I tickled her feet- trying to make laugh a little before death, but it only made her cry more. 

I tossed her choking body over my shoulder and carried it to my house. Her windpipe was crushed but not sealed, leaving her in a twilight of life and death. I laid her on my dining table and hauled the barrel of juice from the basement. “This is a real drink, much better than wine.” I flaunted the glass of juice in her face and set it beside her. I pulled out my butchering knife but as I set it to her throat, I shivered. I had killed her mother, traumatized her for life and she had come back to get revenge… and had given me wine with my meal. She didn’t even try to ask about my cranberry juice, it doesn't matter how many of your family members I kill, you should have the respect to ask me for my cranberry juice. 

I replaced the butchering knife with a filet knife and fork. “You want to disrespect me? There will be consequences young lady.” The knife had only been used once so it was razor sharp and moved smoothing threw her. “May I eat your liver?” I asked then patted her check. “That’s an example of respect: I asked you if I could eat your liver, asked! Didn’t just start munching or worse leave it untouched- Gosh imagine how disrespectful I’d have to be to just leave your liver here. That’s something *you’d* do, not me.” I scoffed at the thought of just leaving her soft liver there and almost vomited at the disrespect. 

She lived through so much of the meal which almost made me forgive her, but when she died, she died trying to hit me again so I retracted my forgiveness.

I ate most of the good parts of her but left her intestines mostly intact so with what scarps I had left I strung her up. She has to ferment a bit longer, but by Wednesday, she’ll be perfect for a small, luxury batch of my famous cranberry juice. I think I’ll let the church use it for communion.

I think I will upload this little journal of mine. Give some nosey detective a lead. I’m very generous and respectful to our boys in blue after all.
