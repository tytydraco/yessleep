I was well aware that Cassara had said she was adopted, but Launa and Cassara couldn’t be more different.



For one, Cassara was wearing jeans and boots, a shirt and only due to the heat had her trench-coat stuffed into my bag.  There wasn’t a spec of make-up on Cassara and for the most part she was as butch and gruff as I had ever seen a woman be.



Launa, however, clearly had a different philosophy.  A light gloss was on her lips, and some other small touches of make-up were on her eyes and cheeks.  A pair of silvery earrings sat at the bottom of her ear-lobes and her nails were delicate and manicured.  



Launa was also wearing a very ornate looking dress, featuring red and golden accents.



Cassara sighed, “Why are you wearing your Hestia Priestess garb?” She looked Launa over, “You look amazingly overdressed.”



Launa heaved a heavier sigh, “Shifting the subject, as usual, Cass?” 



Cassara chewed the inside of her lip as if she was being chastised.



“Did you think I wouldn’t know what you're talking about?” Launa shook her head, “Come on Cassara, you’ve spent enough time out, the Empress is not the monster you assumed she was.”



“She sent Demons ahead of her!” Cassara growled, “We just barely survived!”



Launa nodded, “Her methods are unconventional, but the ends more than justify the means.”



“Launa,” Cassara took a step back, “Not you too.”



“You left before she explained to all of us her task,” Launa reasoned, “How could you know what is going on back home if you don’t come back?”



“I don’t *need* to know what’s going on back home, Launa!” Cassara shouted, “It’s been following me since I left!”



“How-so?” Launa asked.



“Ask Tanya,” Cassara accused.



“The Major was rather humbled by your encounter,” Launa sighed, “Not that humbling those of us born with less physical prowess is below you.”



Cassara furrowed her brow, “I was protecting you! I said that like, a hundred times!  Those 3 bitches nearly killed you!”



“Yes,” Launa said, “and you later faced each of them yourself when I wanted the privilege of taking them down 1-on-1,” her voice was even tempered, and controlled as she fixed Cassara with a stern gaze.



Cassara and Launa held a staring contest for some time before Launa just shook her head, looking to her feet.



Cassara cracked a smile, before she turned to her right, “How are you okay with the Empress, Launa?”



Launa crossed her arms, lifting her eyebrow, “We’re discussing this now, are we?”



“You were literally sleeping with the Queen, Launa!” Cassara growled.



I did a double-take, “Wait, I’m sorry she slept with who?!”



Launa shook her head, “Yes.  I had a very transactional, very physical relationship with the Queen.”



Cassara narrowed her eyes on Launa, “You were her *door mat!”*



Launa took a deep inhale as Cassara glared, “I assume you’re going to cite some examples for your companion?”



Cassara looked to me, “I’m not going to out you like-”



“Queen Rachel,” Launa began, “at a special event in the Balcony Seats where all eyes were upon us during her grand entrance, commanded me to my hands and knees before her,” Launa turned to me, “so that she could place her feet on my back.”



I frowned, “That’s… humiliating.”



Cassara’s fist had clenched.



“More-so to the fact I did it willingly,” Launa said matter-of-factually.



“She abused you, in public, and you went along with it no matter what she did!” Cassara snapped.



Launa nodded, “And that was my choice.”



“I would have pummeled the bitch the *second* you’d have asked me!” Cassara shouted.



“And she would have ended you,” Launa spoke firmly, “Strong as you are, the Queen is an Angel,” Launa shook her head, “Your fiery fists are no match for her.”



“She’s not as strong as you think!” Cassara shot back.



“Just as I am not as weak as you constantly believe!” Launa shouted, her voice raising for the first time.



Cassara stepped back, shocked.



Launa took a deep inhale, and closed her eyes to control her emotions, “From the moment I was old enough to notice all of my classmates growing taller, stronger, and faster than me, I’ve had to struggle with everyone thinking I was just a *Hestie.”*



Cassara flinched.



“First Daughter of the Brigadier General of Penthasil Rhea, with bloodlines reaching as far back as the Son of Erik,” Launa opened her eyes, “and yet even my adopted sister, not even Penthasilian born, of foreign blood, considers herself my superior.”



“I’m not!” Cassara frowned, “I don’t think of you like that, Launa.”



“Oh?” Launa said as she approached Cassara, “Hit me.”



Cassara paused, “What?”



“Right here,” Launa said, pointing to her jaw, “Give me a good hit.  Like a quarter of your normal strength.  Go on, hit me.”



“I’m not-” Cassara began before Launa interrupted her.



“You don’t think I can take it?  Do you?” Launa growled, “That I’m frail like a flower, a delicate rose or houseplant that requires constant attention and upkeep less I wilt?!”



Cassara’s expression was in complete turmoil as she looked Launa over.



“Well?  Do it!  I’m literally asking you!” Launa took Cassara's hand, bringing it to her jaw, forcing Cassara’s loose fingers into a fist, “hit me.  Come on!”



“Launa-” Cassara tried to explain before Launa continued.



“You can’t do it because you think less of me!” Launa said as she stomped her foot.



Cassara fixed Launa with a firm expression, her jaw tight, her lips pursed before, almost out of nowhere, Cassara did swing and hit Launa.



To my shock, Launa’s head shot to the opposite side, but she didn’t move otherwise.  



Though it seemed Launa was shocked as well.



“I didn’t want to do it, because I think *more* of you,” Cassara explained.



Launa turned to Cassara, the surprise on her face remaining.



“I’m protecting you because of how hard you had it growing up!” Cassara explained, “I’m not blind! I knew that if I wasn’t there they’d walk all over you, and I couldn’t let that happen to you!”



“But don’t you see Cassara?” Launa argued, “That’s *why* they walked all over me!”



“What?” Cassara said in shock.



“I couldn’t defend myself, that’s what your *protection* showed them.  That, sure, my *Little Sister* would find them and maybe beat the shit out of them for messing with me,” Launa placed her hand on her chest, “But it emphasized to everyone that, without you, I was helpless.”



Cassara looked Launa up and down, her eyes growing wet, “That’s not-”



Launa gently took Cassara’s hand, “I know that’s not what you wanted.  But I wanted to fight my own battles… But because of you, I had none.  No crucible to forge myself in.  You were always there to use your fire to protect me,” Launa sighed, “But it just made me weaker, and you stronger.”



“Wait,” I interjected, “You can’t hold that against her! She protects everyone she can!”



Launa turned to me with a weak smile, “I’m well aware of what my sister does, and why,” she looked up to Cassara, “And it’s why I need to tell you that, just like you misjudged me, you misjudged her.”



Cassara pulled her hand away from Launa, “You mean to tell me that was a fucking *pitch*?!”



“A heartfelt one,” Launa said as she took a few steps back, rubbing her cheek, “You put a little more than a quarter into that one didn’t you?”



“I was honestly trying to knock you down,” Cassara said with a heavy sigh, “and you proved your point: I underestimate you.”



“You,” Launa said, “and everyone else in Penthasil.  Though, from you it did hurt the most.”



Cassara growled, her fists clenched, “Launa, I’m *not* following that bitch!”



“You do not know what’s happened since she’s taken over,” Launa explained.



“Like what?” Cassara asked.



“The Challenges to the Death are gone,” Launa informed.



Cassara paused.



“I’m sorry, challenges to the death?” I asked.



Launa fixed me with a suspicious glance as she turned back to Cassara.



“You can tell him,” Cassara sighed, “I’m not hiding anything from him.”



Launa lifted an eyebrow to Cassara, “Really?” Launa turned to me, “Our Queen, Rachel, used to offer an open challenge that if anyone could defeat her in single combat, they would win the throne.”



“Wait, what?!” I said, shocked, “She’s that sure of herself?  I’ve seen Cassara fight, if your whole city is that skilled-”



“They aren’t,” Launa added, “Cassara is one of our best, but still I’d wager not good enough to defeat the Queen.”



“The Queen’s an angel, or angelic something,” Cassara sighed, “Remember before, when I said that I had seen an angel kill someone?”



I nodded dumbly.



“Queen Rachel made it a damn spectacle," Cassara lamented.  



“Much to Princess Evangeline's dismay,” Launa explained.



“She must at least be happy about that,” Cassara quipped.



“The princesses are, currently, not in Penthasil,” Launa informed.



“They left too?” Cassara said with a grin, “No wonder the heat’s been off of me,” Cassara’s grin grew wider, “Wait, even Zepherina left?”



“Yes.  Evangeline was offered a mission with the United States armed forces.  Despite Queen Rachel stating that only Eva could go, Zepherina sneaked off to join her,” Launa shook her head, “It is a shame.  If Zepherina were with us this country wouldn’t offer us any resistance.”



“Who is Zepherina?” I asked.



“Zeph,” Cassara did her best to explain, “Isn’t normal.  She won some kind of genetic lottery.  She’s Queen Rachel’s youngest daughter, built like a tank and she can probably toss one too.”



Launa smiled, “Well, being the child of prophecy will do that.”



Cassara rolled her eyes, “Launa, that’s a myth!”



“No,” Launa said with a soft smile, “It’s not.  I’ve known for some time.”



“How would *you* know?” Cassara asked.



“Because I was Queen Rachel’s Hestie upon Zepherina’s birth,” Launa said firmly.



“I'm lost again,” I interjected.



Without a hint of hesitation, Launa smiled at me with a warm grin that was unnerving.



It wasn’t unnerving because of the tone, or her face.  Both were perfectly sweet and unassuming.



But what she said sent shivers down my spine.



“*A child born of Royal Blood, and broken wing.  A child of Abraham and Chthonic Gods, with no man’s seed, shall be born and lead the nation of Penthasil to take the world in her mighty hands,”* Launa said with a soft smile.



“A kid born from the royal bloodline with two women,” Cassara laughed, “Literally impossible.”



“Zepherina is Ragna’s daughter,” Launa said simply.



To me, this was mildly shocking.



To Cassara, it looked like someone had just taken the floor out from under her, “What are you…” she paused as her eyes widened.



“Violet eyes, black wings,” Launa smiled, “I only knew because Rachel told me, swore me to secrecy. She feared that, without Ranga present, none would believe her.”



Cassara shook her head, “Where is Zepherina now?”



“We wish we knew,” Launa said with a sigh, “Empress Ragna longs to meet her blood daughter.  So much so, that Queen Rachel decided it was a good idea to attack a United States Military base, which was the last place the Princesses had been.”



“I’m sure that went over well,” Cassara added.



“They shot her,” Launa quipped, “Not necessarily good for diplomatic relations.” 



“Yeah, well, that’s Queen Rachel,” Cassara growled, “Even so, how could Ragna…” Cassara paused, clearly struggling with something.



“The word you’re looking for is, ‘Sire’,” Launa offered.



“Don’t do that,” Cassara hissed as she narrowed her eyes on her older sister.



Launa hardly reacted.



“How could Ragna *sire* a child?  She’s a woman,” Cassara reasoned.



“Yeah that’s not making sense to me either,” I added.



“Empress Ragna’s technology is great and beyond our imagining,” Launa turned to Cassara with a bemused smile, “The advancements she brought forth to us from beyond the stars is incredible.”



“Sorry, hold up,” I stared at Launa, “What?!”



Launa smiled back at me, “Empress Ragna arrived to us by an interstellar ship, lost to the cosmos and separated from her love, Queen Rachel.”



“Cassara, is your sister insane?” I said, turning to Cassara.



“No,” Cassara narrowed her eyes, “But that is pretty ridiculous.”



“Don’t believe me if you so desire,” Launa relented, “It doesn’t change that her technology allowed for cancer treatments we’ve never seen before, the end of most disabilities and even regrowing limbs and corrected birth defects.”



Cassara scoffed, “She’s giving you everything you want to earn your loyalty, so she can commit whatever atrocity she wants to her enemies, you realize that right?”



Launa gave a nod, “Of course.”



“Launa,” Cassara’s face fell, “Why are you here, in the US?”



“Me?  I’m here officially representing the House of Hestia,” Launa said simply.



“To who?” I asked, now wondering if Launa was quickly becoming an enemy.  



I opened my eyes to the spirit world.



Launa’s aura was very confident.  It pulsed with a strange iridescence, but other than that, she was no horrific demon or monster.  She had no true magic power that I could see.



A calmness was about her.



I attempted to move closer, seeing if touching her aura with my wing would do anything.



When I attempted, however, something else appeared.



A ring of protective flames erupted around Launa, and forced me back.  I glanced at my wing, and my spirit as a whole.  I wasn’t harmed, it was entirely some sort of defense. 



As I looked back to Launa’s aura, she appeared unaware of what was going on.



A sweet woman’s voice lilted softly through the air, “*Leave my priestess be, follower of Abraham.”*



“Who are you?” I demanded.



“*I do hate name compulsion,”* the voice sighed as a translucent vision of a plus sized woman in long brown robes appeared before me.  Her head held a tiara that looked like it was made of red cobble stone, with a gentle flame flickering at its crest, “*I am Hestia.”*



Her voice was calm, and serene, but still I tried to reason with this strange woman, or Goddess, I guess?



“Your *Priestess* is supporting evil works,” I informed.



“*Not in my eyes,”* Hestia explained to me as she stood between me and Launa.  She wasn’t tall, at all, but she was a curvy and plump woman.  I was rather surprised, as I thought a God would have a perfect physical form.



“I’m begging you to stop her,” I implored again, “She’s being used.”



“*Not in my eyes,”* she said as she narrowed hers on mine as she produced a lantern on a long staff, “*She is doing my work. Hear her, if you so chose.”* 



I frowned, “You mean us no harm, I can tell.  But you must know what she’s doing isn’t right.”



“*What is not right is to abandon the home, and children.  To separate them from love and caring, to leave a home empty and loveless,”* Hestia stated, “*A house cannot be a home if there is no love within it.  Launa knows this.  Launa seeks to remedy this affliction in your land.”*



I paused. 



This wasn’t the first time I had met a benign spirit.  I had spoken to a self proclaimed reaper spirit named Baron Samdei once.  He wasn’t good or evil, per se.  But I knew if I got on his bad side, he was dangerous. 



Hestia, for her part, appeared to only be defending Launa, and nothing else, “You mean us no harm?” I asked.



Hestia nodded, “*You are correct, in that I only rose to defend Launa.  I mean no ill will to you or your companion.  I only offer nurturing and protection,”* she frowned, “*I am not as cruel or cold as my sisters.  Nor as vindictive as my dear niece.”*



“Your niece?” I frowned, “Who is your niece?”



“*I speak too much,”* Hestia said firmly, “*Return to the physical realm, child.”*



I paused, and opened my eyes again.



Launa continued, entirely unaware I had just had a chat with her Goddess, “I am here to speak to a consortium of leaders in the United States who are,” she paused, “Disheartened with the current state of affairs in their country.”



“State of affairs?” I asked, “What do you mean?”



“Two incomes needed to keep a home afloat, children left in group homes and in the care of strangers, exposed to other children whom they may not know, who may hurt them with no guidance,” Launa shook her head, “How can one rear a child in such conditions?  The consortium I am meeting wishes to hear out my solution.”



“You mean Empress Ragna’s solution,” Cassara snapped.



“Empress Ragna was not the one who came up with this gambit,” Launa said, turning to Cassara, “It was me.  However, unlike Queen Rachel, Empress Ragna listened.  She gave me all I desired and more.”



“More?” Cassara asked.



“The House of Hestia is now the strongest arm of Government in Penthasil next to the Stewart herself,” Launa said proudly.  “Assaults against Hesties have dropped significantly.  Her technology allows for anonymous reporting of abuse or mistreatment.  Punishments are swift and now, finally, the House of Hestia is allowed to refuse to place a Hestie in a Warrior’s home if we deem it unfit.”



Cassara frowned, “Surprised she’s keen on all of that, considering you were sleeping with her lover.”



“Wife,” Launa explained, “The Queen and Empress are wed now.”



“Blessed be the unholy union,” I growled.



“Yes, it was quite the ceremony,” Launa said, “We celebrated by raiding a South American Country.  Empress Ragna took their despot of a leader and hurled him into a crowd of his own people.”



I flinched.



“Oh, yes it was as brutal as you’re imagining,” Launa said to me, “But with so many governments falling, families needed a way to stay together.”



“And that’s why Hestia shows up,” I confirmed.  “You’re fixing homes that were broken by the wars your Empress is starting!”



“Not every home is broken after we arrive,” Launa said firmly, “Plenty are broken long before.  Thus the House of Hestia arrives to provide aid.”



“And Hesties,” Cassara hissed.  “You’re trying to place Hesties in American households.”



“Only the affluent ones,” Launa explained, “For now.  We won’t have enough for everyone,” Launa smiled wide, “Yet.”



“What are they going to do?  Steal the children of rich people?” I asked.



“Steal them?” Launa shook her head, “No.  Hestie’s goals are to rear a child.  To raise them and teach them.”



“So the next generation is more open to Penthasil’s culture,” Cassara said, shaking her head, “Launa this is worse than war.  You’re literally trying to change the entire culture of a country.”



“How is that worse than war?” Launa asked, “Not a shot will be fired.  Merely children may disagree with their parents.  That's normal,” she smiled, “Besides, I’m sure the Americans would love the idea of a state sponsored live-in maid whom will teach young girls the traditional roles and values of Hearth and Home.”



“Yeah, right!” Cassara laughed, “Why would Americans go for that?”



I flinched.



Launa smiled, “Oh, it seems David is well aware of why.”



Cassara turned to me.



I sighed, “The uh… There’s a good number of folks who would eat that up,” I groaned, "Evangelical Christians love that crap.”



 “With the Valkyrie, Ragna will crush the opposition,” Launa said with a bemused smile, “With Hesties, I will comfort and appease it before it ever takes root.  There will be no jilted orphans of war thanks to the House of Hestia.  Every child will have a nurturing Hestie to care for them, to love them, and teach them,” Launa beamed, “It will be beautiful.”



I flinched, “People aren’t going to just give their kids up to someone just because they’re in their house.”



“Most Hesties end up getting married to their host families,” Cassara added, “Launa left that part out.”



Launa smiled, “Yes.  That’s true.  Whether it’s the father or the mother of the child in this country, it wouldn’t matter.”



“Uh, I thought you were all like,” I cleared my throat, “Sapphic.”



Launa paused as she looked at me, then laughed, “You mean like Cass and I?”  She turned to Cassara, shaking her head, “No, we’re the exception.  Most live with our fellow sisters, but the warriors who raid are most certainly also interested in men.”



Cassara turned from Launa.



“Mother’s only disappointment in Cassara was when Cassara refused to go and have a child,” Launa sighed, “That’s what placed her in the Royal Guard, after all.  The royal guard must remain celibate to men.”



Cassara clenched her fist.



“That last part still seems Sapphic," I added.



“Is the concept of bisexuality foreign to you, David?” Launa asked.



“No, just,” I struggled to find words that were not going to offend either Cassara or Launa.



Launa turned from me to Cassara, “Cassara, my sister, please I implore you: Come home.”



Cassara looked Launa up and down, and for a second, I thought she was going to crack.



“I miss you, Mom misses you,” Launa smiled, “Please? You don’t *need* to fight.  You can remain a palace guard, if you so chose.  But please, come home?”  Launa implored. 



Cassara closed her eyes and heaved a sigh, “Did you come on your own, or did mom send you?” Cassara asked.



“Mom misses you, certainly, and would love to see you home.  But it was my idea to come here and plead my case,” Launa admitted.



Cassara nodded, eyes still closed, as her fist released, “I can’t.”



Launa’s face fell, “Oh.”



“I’m sorry, Launa,” Cassara looked up to Launa with glassy eyes, “I-I can’t follow you.” 



Launa gave a hard swallow, her eyes glassy before a tear rolled down her cheek.



Cassara averted her eyes from Launa immediately, “Why don’t you come with us?”



“I have too much to do for the House of Hestia to leave,” Launa admitted as she tried to dry her eyes.



“But your sister needs you!” I shouted.



“The Hesties at home need me more,” Launa responded.



“Cassara left everything to run away from war,” I admonished, “You have to see that!”



“I understand why she left,” Launa admitted, “I just wish she could understand why she should return.”



“I can’t go back to a land ruled by a tyrant,” Cassara asserted.



“I see,” Launa walked past Cassara, placing her hand gently on Cassara’s, “Well… I have a task to complete.  I wish you luck in whatever you plan on doing,” Launa said, her voice hitching as she walked down the hallway.



Cassara didn’t look at her as she left.



“Cassara just,” Launa paused, pursing her lips as she turned to us once more before she continued, pushing past a lump in her throat, “Please forgive me, for what I had to do.”



Cassara sighed, still not looking at Launa. “I forgive you.”



Launa whispered the next part, “and for what I’ve done.”  She trailed off before she turned and walked down the hallway as tears dripped down her face.  



Once Launa was gone, I looked to Cassara, “What was that about?”



“It’s disrespectful to look at someone as they cry,” Cassara explained as she dried her own eyes.



“Yeah, for a city of women you guys are emotionally repressed,” I joked.



“Fuck you,” Cassara laughed, “I need a bottle of rum after this shit,” Cassara said as she walked to the hotel room door, putting her key into it.  



“Yeah, sure,” I said as I pulled my backpack off my back.



We walked into our hotel room, the lights off, tinting the entire room in pitch black darkness.



As I entered, I fished through my backpack, pulling out a bottle of Cassara’s Rum, “Here.  After that I don’t blame you.”



From the bathroom a figure moved, and slammed the door behind me.



I jumped and spun on my heel to spot a nearly seven foot tall woman wearing military armor, a huge gun strapped onto her back, and a sword at her side.



“Shit! How did I not notice that?!” I shouted as I staggered back from the towering woman.



Cassara jumped in front of me, her hands up and her fists covered in blue flame, “Okay bitch, back the…” Cassara’s eyes widened, “Holy shit, Maddy?!”



The woman’s lip lifted in a sneer, “It’s. Madison,” she growled, “I always hated when people called me *Maddy*.”



“The fuck happened to you?!  You were a Hestie!” Cassara shouted.



“Was,” Madison growled, “Also, I’m a Captain now.”



“How did that happen?” Cassara shouted.



“That would be me,” a bold alto voice echoed from deeper within the hotel room.



I turned as the lights flicked on.



Standing near a chair was a tall bald man.  He was huge, and toned.  His bald head caught the light of the room first, drawing my eye.  His green eyes looked at Cassara, a grin on his face. 



He wore a black and red uniform, but the strangest feature on him was an italic “A” lightly branded against his forehead.   



However he wasn’t the one who spoke.



Rising up from the chair I saw a pair of large black feathery wings.  They nearly reached the ceiling as a woman appeared behind them, clearly attached.



She turned, and I had to take a step back.



Violet eyes fixed on me, behind long black hair held in a tight braid.  The right side of her head featured a short buzz-cut, her angular face and strong jawline emphasized her physical strength.



She wore no armor, rather she was dressed in a very formal and stylized business suit of sorts. The breast of which buttoned to the far right with large hammered brass buttons.  An omega symbol was attached to her lapel, as well as an eye with three arrows stabbed through it.



The outfit was black with hints of violet mixed throughout, her white undershirt was clearly hiding powerful muscle and bulk.



It was as if this massive woman was some kind of body builder.  Her large flat boots thumped gently on the carpeted ground, her weight clearly emphasized as I felt the floor shift as she moved.



“Cassara,” the woman’s alto voice called out to her, “I’m so pleased to finally have found you.”



Madison moved behind Cassara, and pushed her boot to the back of Cassara’s knee, forcing her down, “Show some respect, Cass!”



Cassara growled, turning to Madison, “Fuck you, turncoat!”



“Now now, Madison,” the tall woman said as she scolded, “Don’t be so crass.  Cassara has been out of the loop for some time,” the woman’s violet eyes fixed on me for a moment.



I froze as it felt like someone was trying to touch me.  I stepped back, shaking my head as voices filled my ears for a moment and then vanished.



“What an interesting travel companion,” the woman said, “It appears that one of you, at least, requires an introduction,” she turned to the bald man, “Rasper, if you would.”



“Of Course, Mistress,” The man spoke, almost begrudgingly before he turned to me, his voice a had an impossible to miss cockney accident, “For all those who ain’t aware, allow me tah introduce me Mistress, and Empress of the growing Empire of all Penthasil,” he said as he bowed, “[Ragna](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple/).”
