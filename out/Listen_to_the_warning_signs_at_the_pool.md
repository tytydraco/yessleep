Hello everyone. Hopefully, this won't apply to many of you, but I'm sure you've been to a pool at some point in your life, and at another point, you'll be back at another one. Maybe the few who read this will hear what I'm saying, and it just might help them.

My college has a pool, and I've been swimming there on and off for years. However, recently, I've finally been going on a set schedule. It's really the same old thing every time: brisk through the locker room, shower off, change, take my stuff out to the pool, and jump in and swim.

Anyway, I was walking into the pool a couple of nights ago, doing my best to ignore the mechanic who stalks around, and I saw these two guys talking in front of the rules sign.

"Look, it won't even take us 5 minutes to go back and shower before we get in. We're already in our trunks, so come on-"

"Ralph, shut up; the pool is full of chlorine; it doesn't matter."

I called out to them.

"Yeah, but like, not showering off puts more stress on the system; it's gotta put more chlorine out to purify the water if you don't clean off-"

I didn't hear the other guy's name, but he snapped at me with an angry look.

"Hey, I wasn't saying you're dirty; I'm just saying we all sweat and-"

"You know what, I ain't even gonna swim here!"

I saw his head snap back towards the sign, and his head bobbed for a second.

"If you guys want to let these stupid rules hold you back, fine by me! I'll just come back later when you two aren't here!"

He stormed back off into the locker room, and I saw his friend turn to follow. I shrugged; it's their lives. I walked over to pass a melancholy look over the rules. I saw where his head was bobbing earlier. At the bottom, it said, "Do not come to the pool after it has closed." I sighed; I thought that guy would try to prove something and get himself arrested by campus police. Then he'll be another one stuck working for the recycling department. But, as I blinked to turn away, I saw something change. I looked back down at the bottom of the rules. It was shimmering, but there was another rule: "*C*o*m*e *b*a*c*k *t*h*i*s *o*n*e* n*i*g*h*t." I shook my head out of the confusion, but it changed again: "***M*****a*****y*****b*****e*** **y*****o*****u** ***c*****a*****n*** ***s*****a*****v*****e** ***h*****i*****m*****?"** I blinked a flurry, and then it was gone. I saw the guy's friend come back out of the locker room alone. He'd showered off. He gave me an odd look, but I just ignored him and jumped into the pool to start down the lanes.

I got out, showered off the chlorine, went to classes, and soon I was home again. I was sitting there trying to beat the final boss of Dead Fear: The Mirror and I remembered what I'd seen earlier. My hands shook, but I got up. As soon as I did, I remember trying to hold myself back and tell myself just to stay home, but something was pushing me forward then. I put my clothes back on, my sweaty clothes covered in the chili I'd spilled on them earlier, and I headed out the door, drowning out the sound of my upstairs neighbor stomping around in odd random patterns. 

I drove through the stream of college traffic, a random mix of fear and anger, and I returned outside the recreation center. The pool's windows have curtains, and they were closed then. I sat there staring at the building for a while, I guess it was 13 minutes, and then I sighed. Nothing was happening. It was odd; I felt relieved but disappointed at the same time. I moved my hands, still shaking, towards my keys. Then, out of my eye, I saw some light.

Just barely through the pool's curtains, I could see that a door had opened, and the light was seeping out of it into the pool room. I was shaking harder again, but my hand started to float towards the handle of my door. I felt the damp gravel pressing into the soles of my sneakers. I looked at the rest of the building; I could see people treading along the walking path, lifting weights (mostly socializing), and overall, I could see that the gym was still awake, but the pool was still closed, or it should have been. The door was still open.

I could tell where I was and where I was going, but it all felt like some odd fever dream. I saw the receptionists chattering amongst themselves and working on their schoolwork. I gave them a polite nod, and they did the same as I scanned my card through the gate. They gave me a questioning look as I floated toward the locker room. My hands were still shaking. 

Some guys were getting their bags together to head out, and others were getting ready to start their workouts. They just ignored me as I headed to the pool door. I tried it. It was closed. Once again, a wave of relief and disappointment, and I heard a bathroom door open. I finally turned around to leave, but there was the mechanic. He spoke to me in an accent I didn't recognize.

"I suppose you left something in there?"

"What? Oh, I was just-"

"Here."

He passed by me and unlocked the door. 

"Go in, get whatever you came for, and I'll lock the door when you're done."

"Well, look, man, I…"

I tried to say something about not wanting to get him in trouble, but he drifted off. My hands were shaking again.

The pool was completely empty and dark, but in the very back, I could see the boiler room was open, and the light was coming from there. In my mind, I thought, "I didn't even lose anything. What will he say when I leave here with nothing else?" 

I quit worrying about it, though. I decided, "If they ask, I'll just be honest about wanting to see the pool at night. If they would make me do some community service, what's wrong with that?"

After that, my hands didn't shake so hard. I was there now. I might as well see what I came for and be honest on my way out. Besides, I finally remembered that guy from earlier. If he was messing something up in there I'd be doing my swimming routine a favor by stopping him.

As I walked over, I guess I wasn't being very careful, but it felt like I was being drawn to the pool. Maybe it was just some natural attraction to something you're afraid of; I was wearing dry clothes and completely alone; falling in and possibly busting my head on the way wasn't high on my agenda.

My foot wobbled close to the corner of the pool, and I toppled over and fell straight in. I flailed around in the water for a few seconds, trying to find some footing or someplace where my hand came over the water's edge. But I didn't find it.

Finally, after a few more moments of panic, I forced myself to open my eyes, but it didn't sting or feel odd at all. I'm really surprised I remembered that. When I managed to open my eyes, I stared straight down into a dim greenish-blue abyss. I'll never really get over the fear I felt in that moment, but in some odd way, it was amazing. I had been taken out of the regular limited life I had always known, and suddenly, I was in the impossible, floating over the brink. But mostly, I was just freaked out. 

I flicked my head up and was face to face with the top of the water. I could see such a show of otherworldly chaos that I can't hope to fully describe out of the water. Fire of all colors, electric bolts in all shapes, and chunks of rich earth crashed against each other before cascading into other directions, ignoring gravity, all through the rippling blur of the water's surface. I was in awe as I tried to push my hand through the barrier. I couldn't push past the water's edge. In hindsight, though this was the moment I realized I had limited oxygen left, it was probably for best I couldn't expose my skin to whatever chaotic elements were storming above.

Panicked, I began clawing against the barrier, but there was no friction to tear it open. Then I heard a deep, low groan and felt the water below me churn. I slowly and painfully turned my head back towards the abyss below. It was no longer empty.

A dark gargantuan blur was making shape below me. As it began to come into view, I could see it was impossibly long and of a sickly red hue. Its eyes were large and black, and just as I registered its form, it opened its mouth. I began to scream into the water as I started down into the swirling dark purple pit of its mouth.

I was being pulled back out of the water. I was pulled up by my neck, and when I finally got some air and quit choking and coughing on it, I saw that the mechanic had pulled me out. 

"What was that?"

I wrote that out as if I said it calmly and collectively, but it was blurted out more through panicked shaking and coughing fits. He just stared at me. I opened my mouth to ask again, but then he slowly careened his head towards the boiler room.

I turned around and saw that two men, their faces masked, were carrying something out of the boiler room. It looked like a body wrapped in cloth. It was moving and screaming, and the screams reminded me of that guy from earlier. The mechanic pulled me completely out of the water; I was still just leaning out over the side in the shallow end. The two men, not even looking in my or the mechanic's direction, dragged his body over to the pool and threw him in. 

I tried to get up, but the mechanic held me down with his hand on my shoulder. I looked up at him, and he just looked tired.

"It doesn't want you. You follow the rules. It just wanted you to see."

When I turned back around, the other men were already heading back into the locker room, and when I looked in the pool, there was nobody. I snapped my head back to the mechanic, who had taken his hand off me. His tired look seemed a bit more steely, he replied.

"Go home, chłopiec."

My nervous system was too fried at this point. I just stumbled up and half jogged towards the pool's other exit; at the back of the room, there's a door that can only open outward into the courtyard. When I was almost at the door, I heard him call out to me.

"Keep following the rules."

I turned back around for a second, and when I did, I saw some odd flash of purple light from the bottom of the pool. I pushed my way out the door and rushed home.

Sitting here typing this up, I'm saddened when I think about that guy. I don't even know his name. Maybe I'll ask his friend for it, but maybe it's better if I don't know. Did he deserve it? I don't think so. Why was the monster there? Was the monster even there? I'm not sure, but I can tell you that from now on, you better follow the rules at the pool. I probably shouldn't go; maybe no one else should go to that pool or any other pool like it. However, this is the best shape I've been in my entire life, and considering my family's history of joint problems, I think I will keep swimming. Maybe I'm crazy, but I follow the rules. I should be fine, right?
