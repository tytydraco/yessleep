It started with a ding on my phone—a notification from my OnlyFans, announcing a new subscriber. That wasn’t unusual. Most of my fans are sweet, sending tips with cheeky requests or shy compliments. This one just sent an old, worn-out teddy bear with no note. I’d have brushed it off if not for the bear’s unsettling, stitched-up eyes that seemed to pierce right through its scruffy fur. I tossed it in a corner of my room and moved on.

Days turned into weeks, and the gifts kept arriving—each more personal than the last. A necklace I lost at a club years ago, a postcard I sent my grandma from Paris, even a photo of my childhood dog, long passed away. How did this fan find these things?

Then came the letters, each typed with no signature, just a chillingly familiar recounting of my past. Memories I never shared online, moments I thought were private, poured out on paper as if my own mind had betrayed me.

I tried ignoring the packages, blocking the user, but nothing worked. They always found a way back, subscribing under a new name, their identity masked in the digital crowd of faceless admirers.

The last straw was the video. It popped up in my message requests, a grainy clip showing a figure walking through what looked like my old high school. The camera panned up to reveal the face of the person filming—except there was no face. Just a blur where features should have been, but the voice, it whispered my name, chilling me to the bone.

I called the police, but what could they do? The account was untraceable, the gifts sent from different locations around the world, no fingerprints, no leads. They told me to tighten my security, maybe take a break from streaming. But this was my livelihood.

So, I kept going, pretending everything was fine, smiling for the camera while my nights were haunted by the fear of who or what was watching me. Every shadow seemed to whisper, every creak of my house a sign that my faceless fan was near.

Tonight, I’m going live for the first time in weeks. I’ve triple-checked my locks, bought a new security system, even got a friend to sit off-camera. But as I prep, my phone dings again. It’s a message from a new subscriber—a video link and nothing else. My finger hovers over the button. I know I shouldn’t click it, but fear and curiosity are a potent mix.

The video loads, a live feed of my own room viewed from a corner. I whirl around to the spot, heart slamming against my ribs, but there's nothing there. Just the empty space and the teddy bear with the stitched eyes, sitting where I threw it weeks ago, except now, one eye is missing, and in its place, a tiny camera lens winks at me.

My screen flickers, and a new message types itself out one letter at a time: “See [you](https://new.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1d3diim/a_killer_gave_us_a_list_of_instructions_we_had_to/) [soon](https://new.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/1bg4l0g/i_found_out_why_my_dad_never_talked_about_his/).”
