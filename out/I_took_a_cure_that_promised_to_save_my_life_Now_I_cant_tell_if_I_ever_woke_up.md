Twenty-three days. That’s exactly how long Dr. Harper said I had left to live. Terminal lung cancer, stage four, inoperable. Ellie, my daughter, cried quietly beside me when he delivered the news. Her face was as pale as mine.

That night, while I was struggling to sleep, Dr. Harper returned with a strange determination in his eyes. He offered something experimental, secretive—a small red pill balanced delicately between gloved fingers.

“This is your one chance, Daniel,” he said softly, quiet desperation threading through his voice. “Swallow it before you sleep. When you wake, your cancer will be entirely gone.”

My voice was barely audible. “What’s the catch?”

His eyes darkened, and regret shadowed his face. “The pill induces an incredibly realistic dream. Eight hours will feel like a hundred years. If you die in the dream, it resets—each time becoming more personal, more devastating. Eventually, distinguishing the dream from reality might become… impossible.”

Desperation outweighed caution. I had nothing left to lose. “Give it to me.”

I swallowed the pill at exactly eleven-thirty. Darkness quickly enveloped me.

I woke abruptly, heart pounding. The hospital room felt oppressively dark. A chill crawled down my spine as I realized I couldn’t move—completely paralyzed. Panic surged as a ghostly figure drifted silently toward my bed. It leaned in, whispering coldly, then drew an icy blade swiftly across my throat.

Reset.

This time, the hospital lights glared harshly. Dr. Harper smiled warmly beside my bed. “It worked, Daniel! You’re cured!” Joy surged through me—until he pulled out a scalpel, stabbing deep into my chest, his face blank and unfeeling.

Reset.

I woke again. This time, Dr. Harper smiled warmly, helping me to my feet. We drove home, and I dared to believe I’d truly awakened. My wife greeted us at the door, smiling. Ellie hugged me tightly. Everything seemed perfect. That night, without warning, my wife quietly stood from the dinner table, picked up a kitchen knife, and plunged it into Ellie’s chest. She turned toward me, her eyes empty.

Reset.

Twelve days after returning home from the hospital, Ellie’s blood tests came back positive—terminal cancer, my disease cruelly mirrored in her tiny body. Her eyes were accusing, voice shaking with bitterness. “This is your fault, Daddy.” I watched helplessly as she withered away, powerless and broken. That night, realizing this reality could never be mine, I ended it myself with a noose.

Reset.

Driving home from the hospital, I answered a phone call. A child suddenly darted into the road. Brakes screeched, metal crunched. Soon, handcuffed and numb in a courtroom, the judge sentenced me to life in prison. Years blurred together, solitary agony eroding my sanity until, once again, the noose offered escape.

Reset.

After countless resets—perhaps a hundred—I awoke gasping but hopeful. I was cured, and life resumed normally. Twelve blissful years passed. Ellie grew, graduated, married—a life I cherished deeply. One night, she visited, face strangely pale, her voice cold and detached.

“You thought you’d woken up? You never did, Dad.”

She drew a knife, and I didn’t even resist.

Reset.

Three hundred resets—maybe more. They were indistinguishable from real life, each lasting decades filled with love, loss, joy, and despair. Each cruel ending wrenched me from the realities I desperately clung to, slowly unraveling my mind.

I finally woke a year ago, sunlight warming my hospital room. Doctors celebrated my miraculous recovery. Ellie hugged me fiercely, eyes bright yet strangely distant. Weeks passed, paranoia gnawing at reality’s edges.

A week ago, I confessed my nightmares to Ellie. She looked at me softly, eyes darkening unnaturally.

“Dad,” she whispered, “are you sure you’ve woken up?”

I haven’t slept since. I think I woke up—but last night, I swear my reflection smiled back at me.

Did I ever truly wake up?
