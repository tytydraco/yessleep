Here I am rationalizing, or rather attempting to, my experience, as I cannot help but be convinced that without writing it down and letting the world know about it that I will simply relegate it to a figment of my imagination and ignore the evidence I have of it happening. But I'll let you be the judge of that.

It started rather innocently. I was having drinks at a friend's place after a particularly long day at university. Usual get together. Him, his girlfriend, and a few mutual friends. I don't drink much and don't do drugs, and even if I did there must be something in my blood that refuses to let me get intoxicated, so can pretty clearly recall all of the out of pocket stuff that gets thrown around when people are drunk, high, or both. The usual gets thrown around. Gossip, stories of crazy nights out, hookups, bad trips, embarrassing confessions, you know how it goes. And none of that really matters. *Not this time*. Maybe some other day, some other post. Instead my friend, after what must have been his sixth or seventh drink, turns to me and tells me "I didn't know you had a brother?" Which rather confused me given I'm an only child, and told in the strange sincerity and honesty of someone who doesn't realize what they're saying. I joked it off. "You know I don't have siblings. You would have met them by now." More perplexing was that his girlfriend chimed in as well. "There was this dude on campus we thought was you. Like we thought you had a haircut and trimmed your beard to a mustache. We said hi, he said was your brother, and we talked shit for like half an hour. He even told us about you and Charlie. I didn't know the two of you had hooked up after Tuesday's jam session. Fuck, I didn't even know there was anything going on between you two." I didn't deny what happened between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, because it is factually true. But probing about this *brother* of mine was like a tennis ball bouncing off a wall. Both, in inebriated truthfulness, would not budge from their story. A mustache wearing doppelganger talked to them and told them things no one knows. Or knew.

This is when things started to get eerily uncomfortable. That feeling like everyone is in on the joke except for you. Charlie, or rather Charlotte, is a girl I knew back in middle school who moved with her family to Dublin in high school. I'd forgotten of her existence until she popped back up in university. We bumped into each other at one of jazz society's jam sessions. My usual crowd got shitfaced while I was on the bandstand so left early. Meanwhile, after my set I ended up getting some drinks with Charlie, and well, I don't need to get into the full fucking details. But nobody, other than her, knew. Her roommate was out of town for a research project. And some random guy who looks like me with a mustache claiming to be my brother knows. Can you fathom the thought of it? A stranger convincing enough to look like you who knows your private life gallivanting about.

So I took advantage of an opening to catch some air and call Charlie. No response. I start getting nervous. Try again. Still nothing. I find so excuse go to her place as everyone involved lives close to campus, all the while that intrusive feeling of something *off* is crawling up my spine. The cold and streetlights hardly helped. I could see my breath hang in the air. And that's when I see *them*. What can only be described as me passed through a couple rounds of telephone walking in the same direction. Everything just close *enough*. Shorter hair. Tortoiseshell glasses instead of wire frame ones. Mustache instead of beard. Long overcoat, but single breasted instead of my usual double breasted. But unmistakably me. That's when the dread set in. Unease turning to something more sickening, where all you can do is freeze to process. And they pause. A grin on their face. A swivel towards my direction. And my voice coming back towards me. My voice not as I hear it, but how it sounds on recordings. "Fancy seeing you here. Maybe you've heard of me. Maybe you haven't. But here's how things are going to work. I'll pop by every now and then. Be you for a few hours. Fuck with your friends. In every sense of the word. Fuck with you. Unless we can come to an agreement." I didn't respond. How do you respond to something like that? Instead I just stood there as they inched towards me, every passing moment searing itself to my memory. Halfway between 31 and 33 Lafayette Street. A singular light on the last floor of 32. The nervous winding of the crown of my watch nearly veering into me snapping it out of the cogs making it tick. The faint sound of music in a parallel street.

"See here, there's an easy way to resolve this. You cease to exist. I become you. Nobody will ever know. But I can't make that choice. Only you can. I can... facilitate it if you want. Just let me know." By now they are inches from me, our breath fogging up each other's glasses. They take out a card and give it to me. A phone number. And they walk out into the darkness. I am all of the sudden acutely aware that I am, despite it being near freezing, sweating profusely and could feel my heartbeat echo through my body. I paused my watch at that moment in time.11:32PM. Friday 5th 2024.

When I make it to Charlie's place I'm greeted by her roommate. Says she was creeped out by some guy looking for Charlie. His description didn't match anyone Charlie knew, but having now met me she did say he looked like me. The roommate saw my text message arrive on Charlie's phone, as she'd left it on the table before going to bed, but didn't want to worry her by waking her up. As I write this I can only imagine what could have happened had he run into Charlie instead of her roommate. 

I've not seen or heard of this other me since. I've told Charlie that some guy pretending to be me was looking for her that night, especially now that we're dating. I still have the card. I can't bear get rid of it. It's real. Tangible fucking proof. I can resist the morbid curiosity of knowing what awaits me on the other side of the line. Its hidden, don't worry. I'm not careless. As I write this though the only thing that courses through the back channels of my mind is if, or when, it may happen again. Because that is far more terrifying than anything that has occurred. The threat of what could or will. It could destroy my life. My friendships. Tempt me into calling that number. I'm confident I won't. But it is an inescapable thought.
