So my husband, Michael, called me an ‘bitch’ because I dared suggest that his daughter’s death didn’t make it suddenly okay to read her dairy.

He kept going over *why* it would be the right thing to do. Anytime I tried chiming in, he just referenced the fact I didn’t cry at the funeral, as if this somehow made my opinion worthless. (It turned out my delightful mother-in-law commented on my ‘odd lack of emotion’ at the wake, and he’d been waiting for the perfect opportunity to throw it in my face.)

Neither of us even knew Mel kept a journal. But then earlier that night, the grieving father decided his daughter would have liked her old room better if the bed sat over by the window.

As he shivered a huge, awkward wardrobe off the wall—ignoring my repeated attempts to lure him away by proposing a Lord of the Rings marathon—he uncovered a hidden recess with a little teal journal tucked away inside, all snug and cosy.

In the argument which followed, he got so worked up spittle flew from his lips and his cheeks turned all red. By some miracle, though, he eventually agreed to take a long walk to consider my perspective. “Once you read it, there’ll be no *un*reading it,” I’d said.

Alone in the sleepy house, I sat behind the table in the downstairs lounge, thinking about how to make him see sense. Mounted against the side wall there was a picture of Mel smiling. Her face was painted like a cartoon character from that dumb show she and her dad watched religiously. She loved to draw, so it wouldn't have surprised me if all the screaming was over what turned out to be nothing more than a bunch of silly doodles.

Even still, she'd kept the book secret for a reason. Maybe it was packed full of juicy details so spicey it would kill her all over again if her dad read them.

The front door burst open much earlier than expected, then a slurred voice stumbled along the hall screaming, “RUTHHHHHH.”

Michael found me at the back of the house. He staggered across the room on legs so unsteady he almost tripped over the wastepaper bin pushed up against the side wall, a bottle of whiskey in his right hand. In the past six months, the drunken idiot had let his brown-grey beard grow out all scraggily, and he’d lost so much weight his shirt and jeans looked just a little too baggy.

“Well?” I asked.

“I’m reading the fucking thing…and *you* can’t stop me.” He reached for the journal, which lay by my hands beside a ceramic ashtray.

Softening my voice, I pulled it away and said, “I’ve had some time to get my thoughts straight, and I want you to hear them out. Five minutes is all I’m asking for. Then you can do whatever you like.”

He hiccupped as he staggered back against the chair opposite mine. “I can’t fucking wait to hear this.”

Now and again, he savoured another swig of whiskey without spilling too much. It was the most animated I’d seen him in six months. Why?

From my pyjama pocket, I grabbed a zippo lighter and a carton of cigarettes and lit one, my hands all wobbly. Six months in close quarters with the emotional tinderbox for a husband left me shakier than a soldier in a foxhole.

I took a draw and said, “Now I loved Mel—”

Hot air snorted through his nostrils.

“I *loved* her,” I continued, “just like I love you. And not only that, but I was a teenager once, and when *I* was having trouble with my dad—”

“Your *foster* dad.”

My hands balled into fists. I took great pride in my patience and understanding, but we all have our limits. “If I’d ever caught him reading my diary, or doing anything even remotely like that, it would have been a permanent black mark against our relationship.”

“You think I give a shit about black marks?”

I sighed. “Okay, tell me what you’re hoping to get out of this?”

He leaned forward over the desk. “Nobody could tell me *why*, Ruth. Not Becca. Not any of Mel’s classmates. Nobody. At the funeral, everyone kept saying the same thing—that they couldn’t believe it. Then they all gave me this look like they were expecting me to fill in the gaps about what was going through her head, and all I could do is fucking shrug. I know my daughter. And what she did, she wouldn’t have done without a really, *really* good fucking reason. I want to know what that was, and this,”—he nodded at the diary—“might have the answer.”

He’s right, nobody could put their finger on why. The general consensus among our family and friends, especially Michael's parents, was generally unfavourable towards me. Behind my back, those blessed with clairvoyance said ‘clear warning signs’ had been missed. That anybody could have been 'things were gonna end badly'.

They simply chose to not mention it at the time…

I said, “Michael, you were a great dad. World class even. But the past year, with the whole acquisition thing, it created this…*distance*.”

He winced as if punched in the gut. “I called home every fucking day.”

“But half the time you weren’t even listening. The other half you just grumbled about some legal mumbo jumbo.”

“And I suppose you and Mel became instant besties? What, were you going on spa weekends together?”

“I am not, nor have I ever, implied we were besties. But whether you wanna believe it or not, we did have *a* relationship, and anybody could have seen how blue she was in those last few months.”

“Then why didn’t she say anything?”

“Probably because she didn’t want to give you another problem to worry about.”

“Yeah fucking right. How come *you* never mentioned any of this?”

“I did. Multiple times. You just kept saying, ‘it’ll all be over soon’.”

“I was doing it for *her*,” he snapped, his white-hot fury making me flinch. “I wanted to get the fucking sale done so we could—”

“You’re missing the point. No matter how good your intentions were, being away from home meant you missed stuff. Mel’s started doing worse at school, she was eating less, and she stopped hanging out with her friends. Now can you at least admit the possibility that if she was struggling, she might not have mentioned it to her dad who was already on medication?”

“Of course you’d throw *that* in my face,” he hissed.

I needed to tread carefully. It wouldn’t have been the first time Michael’s grief had driven him to blame the whole sorry affair on the nearest available target. At one point he’d even decided it was all Mr. Simpson’s fault, and a crowd of students recorded him jumping Mel’s former math teacher in the staff car park. In the footage captured by a dozen smartphones, he knocked out the poor bastard’s front teeth while shouting, “Give *my* daughter a C+ will you?”

I said, “Michael, I am not *throwing it in your face*. I’m just saying you’re searching for an explanation that isn’t there. I remember one day, Mel came home from school all gloomy, and I could tell she was trying not to cry. I asked if she wanted to get some ice cream, but she insisted she was fine and kept asking when you were gonna call. And when you finally did, you were worked up about some big meeting, and she just clammed up and didn’t say anything.”

“Okay. Fine. I’m a selfish piece of shit who neglected his own daughter. That means I can’t fuck things up any worse by reading her diary, right?”

“That’s *not* what I said.”

“I’ll tell you what, Ruth, sure, I probably missed some things. But guess what, all those things? They’re gonna be right in here.”

As he poked the diary with a fat finger, my anxiety cranked up a notch. What would it take to make him see things from my point-of-view?

“Remember the time you went to the same restaurant as Mel and Becca to spy on them on that double date?”

“I do.”

“This is a million times worse.”

“Hmm. Good point. I’ll tell you what, if she gives me the silent treatment again, I owe you a steak dinner.”

“So you’ve really got no problem pissing on her memory?”

“None at all,” he said, beaming at me. “You about done?”

I stubbed out the cigarette in the ashtray. Since, all my objections kept falling on deaf ears, was it time to bring out the big guns?

“What if she wrote about you? What if you get near the end and there’s a passage—”

He jumped to his feet. “Don’t you fucking dare.”

“Okay, okay. I’m sorry,” I said, my arms raised in a submissive gesture.

In his anger Michael seemed to fill the entire room. “You know, you’re so desperate for me to *not* read this fucking thing, it’s almost like *you’re* hiding something.”

My heartbeat forced its way up into my temples.

When we first met, Mike had been a soft-spoken nerd juggling the position of CEO at one of WIRED magazine’s ‘Top 5 most exciting tech start-ups’ with raising a moody fourteen-year-old daughter, alone. Around the time our relationship began, executives started floating the idea of an acquisition and, under my guidance, Mike traded in the wolf-print t-shirts for fancy suits, got a decent haircut, and learned how to play the corporate game. I coached him through the fancy gala dinners and cocktail parties, quickly redirecting the subject every time he stumbled into another social faux pas.

Through love, encouragement, and endless support, I’d helped him become a giant success. And call me crazy, but I’d continued to love and support him despite the fact our marriage had gone up in smoke. Despite how every day since the funeral had blurred together into one giant, prolonged slog. Most nights, lying side-by-side under the blankets, that breathing powder keg would roll away from me and sob. From the way he shrugged me off when I tried to help—along with the sprinkling of dirty looks and snide comments spread out over the past half-year—I should have foreseen him lashing out at me.

All the grief and bitterness and alcohol had fuelled Michael’s paranoia. Or maybe it gave him the courage to finally say what he believed all along. Either way, there was no changing his mind.

“Fine,” I said, as I got up and started in the direction of the door. “If you wanna read it, I won’t stop you.”

Without warning, Michael snatched the diary and then flipped over the table. Both the bottle and the ashtray went spinning onto the carpeted floor.

He marched forward, fast and unsteady. “What’s wrong, did I touch a nerve?”

I backed up against the wall. He kept coming until our faces were so close that foul whiskey breath made something sour regurgitate up my throat. Craning my neck to the side, I said, “Michael…please.”

His left arm stretched out, pinning me in the corner. “I think you know something. I reckon without me here to play peacemaker, this place was like a fucking minefield.”

“You’re not thinking straight. You’ve been mixing pills with alcohol.”

“I think something happened between you and Mel, and you’re scared shitless she wrote it down.”

“Call Dr. Mercer. Tell him—”

“I bet you sent me on that walk so you could get rid of something.”

He waved the diary in my face while those bulging eyes crawled all over my body, as if searching for a confession. “What’s the matter? Did I get back too soon and fuck up your little scheme?”

As he leaned even closer, an intense claustrophobia gripped hold of me.

“A lot of shits starting to make sense now Ruth. Your whole life you’ve been a bit of a bad luck magnet, haven’t you?”

“…What?”

“Like that ex-boyfriend of yours, what was his name? Simon? Sam? Stabbed him in the liver, didn’t you? You cried self-defence, but he said you caught him texting his secretary and flipped out.”

“Lashing out at me isn’t gonna bring back—”

“Or how about your foster mom. You were fourteen when she broke her neck, right? I remember Peter said she took that tumble right after they got the thumbs up to adopt a second child. What’s the matter, did widdle Wuthie not wike the idea of sharing her pawents?”

Deep in the pit of my stomach, the rage cranked up a notch. “You’re sick.”

“Am I? What about my company’s buyout?” He expelled a low whistle, his face and neck turning purple. “That deal was worth a fuckton of cash. What would have happened if Mel told me all about how you’ve been acting like a gigantic bitch before we got all the details worked out? A dilemma like that could drive a person to do something crazy. Like say ground up some pills and slip them in somebodies’ food.”

Before I even realized my hand was rising it had slapped him clean across the face. Michael reeled for a moment, touched his left cheek, and then his free hand closed around my windpipe, tight.

As he slammed me back against the wall, the world and everything in it blurred. When I came too, I was lying in a staggered heap on the carpeted floor, blood pouring from the back of my skull. In the centre of the room, two versions of my attacker orbited one another, defiling their daughter’s memory by nosing through her most intimate thoughts.

Who even knew what she wrote in the stupid thing? It could have been very good or very bad. If it was bad, however—like say some fictional creative writing pieces about her wicked stepmother—it would only fuel Michael’s rage, and between the expensive lawyers and teary-eyed testimony from my in-laws, there was a lot he could get away with. I needed to get the hell out of there.

But how was I meant to escape with Michael blocking the exit?

Almost blind, I crawled along on my hands and knees until my fingers landed on the bottle of whiskey. Several inches of amber liquid swirled around the bottom. I blinked away most of the double vision and glanced about the room. The wastepaper bin was sitting against the wall up ahead. Bingo.

I crawled over there, let myself collapse sideways against the wall, cradled the bin against my chest, and doused the contents in the flammable spirit.

“What the fuck is this?” Michael shouted, as he held the journal out at me, jaw clenched.

Toward the back of the book, triangular scraps poked out of the spine. Almost like a section had been ripped out in a hurry.

I didn’t—and I still don’t—know what happened to that part of the diary. Maybe Mel wrote something she regretted afterwards. Or maybe she just spilled Pepsi over them. Either way, Michael looked about ready to explode.

“Where the FUCK are the missing pages?"

I grabbed the lighter from my pocket, ignited it with a roll across my pyjama leg, and held it above the bin. “Right in here darling.”

There was a mountain of letters and bills inside. No ‘missing diary entries’, but of course *that* crazy bastard didn’t know this.

Not too shabby for a plan improvised on the fly.

For a moment, we faced each other in absolute silence. A showdown. Then, Michael’s hands rose, slowly. “Honey…”

The lighter dropped into the bin. Thanks to the alcohol, the papers ignited quickly.

Michael blitzed toward me and swiped the miniature BBQ out of my hands, which caused it to vomit those flaming papers across the floor. He tried stamping out what—*he believed*—were his daughters’ final thoughts.

Dazed, stunned, I used the wall to yank myself to my feet, my right hand still clinging to the bottle. Meanwhile, out in the hall, a smoke alarm wailed.

The pages blackened, curling along the edges. As Michael stamped out flames, repeatedly stumbling over in his drunken state, the carpet caught fire in a dozen or so places, and embers danced into the air.

Desperate, he dropped to his knees patting out the final sparks with his bare hands. This was my chance. I ran forward.

With the so-called ‘incriminating memoirs’ destroyed, Mike looked around at me and said, “I’ll fucking kill you bit—”

That’s as far as he got before getting doused with the last of the whiskey.

The fire spread across his legs and raced up his torso. Swallowed by flames, Michael rolled around the floor, screaming, shrieking, thrashing, spreading the fire even further. All the alcohol made reorienting himself possible.

A stench of roasted meat soon engulfed the oven of a room. Within seconds Michael’s charred flesh became medium rare and was fast on the way to being well done.

Eyes squinted against the rising smoke, I staggered toward the outside hall, giving the burning man a generous berth along the way. Then, I made a desperate break for the front entrance.

Outside, I took a long, nourishing gulp of fresh air. Behind me, the windows glowed bright orange, especially on that top floor. The ugly house seemed to be examining me. Judging me. Cackling about how it was packed full of dirty little secrets.

A crowd of neighbours from as far as five streets over quickly gathered along the street, drawn by the flaming structure. Shortly after a siren wailed in the distance.

I didn’t cry the night I found Mel’s lifeless body spread out across her bed, her face a ghostly pale white, and my eyes remained bone dry at the wake while an endless stream of our closest family and friends offered their condolences one after another. But watching those brave firefighters fail to keep my marital home alive, it became impossible to hold back the tears.

Could I have done more to help Michael process his grief? Possibly. But I had ZERO to do with Mel’s tragic affair. And I definitely don’t know where those missing pages went…

But none of this matters anyway. Because my former self, and all of her mistakes, they burned along with that [miserable old house.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)
