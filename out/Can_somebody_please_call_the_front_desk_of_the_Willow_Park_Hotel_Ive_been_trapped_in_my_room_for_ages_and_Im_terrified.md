All I needed was a place to stay for the night. I was in town on a work trip, and they let me have free reign when it came to choosing a hotel. It might've only been for the night, but I'm a picky son-of-a-bitch when it comes to hotels. Somehow I'd always find amazing deals on hotels that really ought to have been more expensive. Not that it was my own money on a work trip, I just retained a sense of pride about it.





The Willow Park happened to be one of these. 







$150 for the night. I gave up everything I'd ever known to spend $150 on a hotel room.




3 PM. Check-in time. The flight from my home city hadn't been so bad but I found myself exhausted for one reason or another so I couldn't wait to toss my bags into a corner and lay in the pristinely prepared queen-size bed waiting for me. The front desk employee gave me a wry smile as I arrived and asked for my ID before checking me in. 







*"Your reservation is pre-paid, Sir, so here is your room number and keycard. I hope you enjoy your stay at The Willow Park and the rest of your day is lovely".* 







Pre-paid? Huh? I always paid for my stays with the company card upon arrival, so I was left somewhat confused. The out-of-place tiredness convinced me to settle that problem upon check-out, and so I rolled my suitcase along the linoleum floor and made my way towards my assigned room - number 366. 







Before long I was all settled in, and a quick nap left me rejuvenated and rid of the exhaustion from earlier. Nice time for a relaxed drink in the lobby bar before coming back up to get started on some of that work, I thought. 







The room thought differently. 







I pushed, pulled, heaved and hoed with all my might to no avail. The door simply would not open. A call down to the lobby seemed like my best bet, and the employee from earlier picked up.







*"I'm sorry to hear of your inconvenience, Sir, please try again with increased force as some of our doors can be quite stubborn due to their age."* 









*"I dunno what to tell you, I've tried every which way already and it just will not open."* I retorted. 







*"Please stay put, Sir, and someone will be right up to assist you."* 





Nobody ever came. 





5 PM came and went. 





Five thirty. 





6 PM.





Before long the lights in my fancy little room had turned themselves on, sensing the setting of the sun outside. I tried the lobby again. And again. Nothing. From any of the buttons listing various areas of the hotel. Even fucking housekeeping never picked up. There wasn't much left to do but sleep, in the hope my quandary would solve itself whilst I rested. 







It didn't. But what it did do, was give me some clarity. Terrifying clarity, but clarity nonetheless. My eyes adjusted to the brightness of the room around me as I woke up, and I found them drawn to the door. Rather, the bottom of the door. A neatly presented room-service tray lay on the carpeted floor. I stumbled over to it and inspected its contents. An omelette. A slice of toast. A large sausage. A dollop of beans. A glass of orange juice. 





And a note. 







*"Breakfast."*







"What the fuck?" was the phrase repeatedly bouncing around in my brain. I tried the door again. Stuck as it ever was. The day trundled along, theories and ideas whistling through my mind at an alarming rate. I tried every button on the phone keypad again. I was met with nothing, again. At one point I took a look outside. Too high to jump, I would die on impact. I had no way out. Confusion and anxiety gave way to full-blown panic. 







It was on that first full day that I learned how to survive in that room. You see, room service only ever arrived when I fell asleep. It was easy to wake up to a well-prepared, hot breakfast because I fell asleep at some point every night. Dinner didn't come so easily. On that first full day, dinner didn't come at all. Not that I expected it or recognised the pattern at that point, but the principle remains. I learned to induce well-timed naps and woke up to that same white tray on the floor the next day. Steak. Fries. A glass of Coke.





And a note. 







*"Dinner."*





The meals never changed, nor did the notes, nor did the placement of the tray just below the door. Only the timing. If I wake up at 8 AM, breakfast is hot and ready at 8 AM. If I finish my evening nap at 8 PM, dinner is hot and ready at 8 PM. If I was hungry earlier, I could set an alarm for earlier. If I wasn't hungry until later, I could start my nap later. The meals would be there and be in optimal state regardless. Honestly, after I accepted the situation I found myself in, things weren't so bad for a period of time. I had delicious meals made just for me twice daily, I had unlimited time and access to the internet having brought my phone and two computers with me and I could live a relatively fine life in the confinement of that room. Too bad having access to technology didn't change my inability to contact my friends or family, though that wasn't much of a surprise given what I had learned about the telephone in the room. The only hope of this message being seen by anybody but myself is that I managed to connect to the WiFi of room 367. My neighbour. I can only hope they haven't found themselves in a similar conundrum.







The delusional novelty wore off pretty quickly, though. The meals got boring, the internet didn't stimulate me enough and loneliness hit me like a truck. I tried sneaking notes out with the tray that would be replaced whilst I slept more than once. "Please help me" or "I'm trapped in my room" were among the common messages. Again, no luck. Reality began to morph into a discombobulated mess. In my dreams and nightmares, I found myself stuck in that room. In every waking moment, I found myself stuck in that room. There was no functional difference between the two. Still isn't. Every moment I spend breathing is one spent in terror.







Deep down I know that it means nothing whether my reality is comprehensible or not, I find myself stuck between these four walls regardless. Maybe the descent into madness will be easier if I lose track of what's real and what's not. Maybe that *is* the madness. Who knows. 





I don't know how much time has passed me by, be it months or years. I don't think I will ever again know a life beyond these walls. But I had to try one last time. Before my sanity slips away. 





Please, call somebody. Anybody. Tell them a person is trapped in room 366 of The Willow Hotel. Lie, if you have to. Anything to get them here. Call the front desk, call the police, call whoever you think can help me.







Please, I *need* to get out of here.
