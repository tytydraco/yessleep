‘**12 June, 2078**

Those things.....they invaded us.

We are no longer safe.

It’s been only a few months; to be precise I think three months. And the population has already been reduced to a bare hundred.

Me and a few other survivors were holed up in a run-down cottage a bit far from the main town. We hear screams outside our door, every day, sometimes we cannot sleep for the fear of one of those things entering and outright killing the entire lot.

Those *grim things*, what are those, why are we being attacked, why are we being killed?

We are being hunted.

We often hear some survivors crying for help and some even try to break in to our cottage. But the moment they catch up to you, you’re gone. Do not make noise, do not look at your own reflection, and you might be able to survive a little longer.

Those things.... they only attack when you catch a glimpse of your own self. As soon as you eye your own reflection, you’re dead. We’ve covered the entire cottage with opaque materials. We’ve barricaded every window, sealed off every mirror.

There’s a *tiny* glimmer of hope. Maybe we can, after all, make it out alive.

One of the survivors, Jeanne Torres, is most probably dead. Last night during the midnight hour, she snuck off with her child. She hasn’t returned yet and we can only assume she’s dead. The whole town is covered with snow and as far as we know, they’re at every nook and corner; just waiting, patiently waiting for their victims to make a mistake.

Harry Turner, a man in his late fifties who is supposedly the leader of our survivor ‘group’ has announced that we may need some sort of weapons. In case someone goes rogue and cuts off the cardboard and undo the resistance we’ve built. He strictly told us to stay positive. He was good at what he did and I think everyone understood what he meant- Try not to mess up. Because those *grim things* are waiting for their chance.

I think some sort of miracle took place. Or whatever it is.

Jeanne Torres is alive, it’s not entire good news because her son has been killed.

The way she arrived was a bit dramatic.

We were up in the morning, going by our usual routine, munching on apples and oranges when we heard large banging on the cottage door. I quickly snatched my shotgun from the closet and rushed downstairs, Harry was already there. We exchanged glances and nodded at each other. Everyone held their breath.

“Open the goddamn door, it’s Jeanne.” We heard her familiar voice.

“Should we open it?” I asked Harry.

“Are you sure those things can’t take the form of a human? Because if it can, we’re fucked.” Harry replied. Some of the survivors agreed and asked us not to let her in.

Could we risk ten lives for saving one? Probably no. But the idea of those grim things materialising into humans was a bit far fetched.

We opened the door and quickly shut it as she entered.

Sorry, I have to go. I’ll continue where I left off. I promise. I’m writing this to whoever finds it. So that everyone knows what happened to us.

“Why the fuck did you sneak off?” Was the first thing Harry asked, “And why the fuck were you banging so loud? If they know we’re holed up here they’ll play tricks on us, and who knows which one of you insane good-for-nothing would fall prey to their tricks.”

Jeanne sat down with a thump on the floor. “They took my kids.” She wailed. Harry crouched down and put his fingers on her lips. “Shhh! Don’t make noises. They’ll hear us. You’re putting everyone at risk here.”

“We’re going to die! They’ll hear us.” One of the survivors whispered loud enough for all of us to hear. Most of us nodded.

“They fucking took my son! I don’t care what happens to me.” She wailed again. Tears fell down her face.

“How?” I asked, “How did you escape?”

She stopped crying and looked at me. Her eyes were melancholic. Those were the eyes of a madman, but she didn’t do anything. *“I didn’t.”* She replied.

This sent chills down my spine. Harry’s expression turned serious. “What?” He asked, “What the fuck do you mean?”

“Fuck! Look at that.” Terry Beauchamp, one of the survivors exclaimed loudly. He was pointing at a table lamp. It was shaking violently. Suddenly the whole cottage started shaking.

“You fucktard, you tricked us. You let those things in? Why?” Harry asked, his face resembled that of a man who knew that there was no escape.

“They said they would return my son. Everyone in the town’s dead. Except for us. They want us dead. No, no, no, no, no , no , no, no. They want *you* all dead. Not me. I’m going to escape and survive, I am not dying to some weird alien that I can't even see!” She said, and then she laughed, she laughed hysterically as she swung open the door and quickly procured a mirror from her pocket. She held it up high for everyone to see.

There was an uproar. The whole cottage went to shit. Those *grim things* had entered. The whole barricade wore off. Everyone was running. The foolish ones who ran outside were instantly killed. I didn’t witness how they died, I simply *knew.*

I saw Harry die as I ran up the stairs. He tried shooting one of those things, but it was no use. Bullets just went through them, there was no effect, it was almost as if they were translucent. Then those things just sucked Harry’ soul out. No, it wasn’t just his soul. It was everything. Everything

I ran upstairs with my shotgun by me. I knew it was of no use against them but somehow I felt safe and I knew it would come to use later. And it did.

I shot her.

I shot Jeanne. She tried to sacrifice me and feed me to one of those things but her strength fell short to mine. It was gruesome, I didn’t mean to kill her like that but I was overcome with rage and a desire to live, a desire to survive. I shot her in the face at point blank range, her face split into half and her brain just spewed out like play-doh.

I ran and entered the bedroom. I quickly locked the door. The resistance in this room hadn’t been undone. There were two people with me in there- Terry Beauchamp and Eric Rave. “Well, we are fucked. We can’t go anywhere now.” Eric said, he was surprisingly calm and looked relaxed.

“I knew we shouldn’t have let her in. It’s always sympathy for one life that puts everyone else’s at risk. If I would’ve been the leader I would’ve never let her in.” Terry said with a scowl hovering on his face.

“Well, there’s one thing we can do.” I said as a thought lurked around my mind. A sinister thought, yet it was the only way to survive. It was the only way *I* could live. This was my ticket to surviving.

“What?” Both Terry and Eric asked. A questionable look on their face.

“You’ll see.” I opened the door and walked outside. I had my eyes closed as I did this.

I shut the door behind me. I heard a gasp coming from the room as I shut the door.

“I’ll make a deal. I know you’re hungry for us. But inside that room are a few people that will serve all of you. I know you made a deal with Jeanne. I don’t know why I am doing this, but I should. If you can understand what I am saying. Allow me to pass through and you’ll never see me again. Spare me.” I said and kneeled down.

I heard the sound of bones cracking and  surprisingly cold air hitting the back of my neck. My hairs were raised. “As you wish.” A calm and peaceful voice responded. And I felt all of them pass through me as they waited outside the door. I grabbed the handle, my eyes closed, and swung the door open.

I opened my eyes, it worked, there was a clear way out. And I ran. I ran away from the town.

I made a deal with aliens.’

*This was the excerpt from his diary we recovered from his dead body. Frank’s body was recovered from the cottage beside Harry Turner’s body. Study suggests Frank never left the cottage but had spent approximately a few days before being killed by the entities. What is surprising is that Terry Beauchamp and Eric Rave’s bodies were never recovered. We tried to find their name and their residence and all. We couldn’t find anything. Every other survivor’s record we found except these two. Terry Beauchamp and Eric Rave didn’t exist.*

*We don’t know what the fuck happened here. And we don't know if those grim things are still out there.*
