If I had chosen another bathroom on campus, perhaps today I wouldn’t even remember that day. How different would things be if I hadn’t run into that man—handsome and horrifying at the same time?

I feel a need to confess, with the advantage that anonymity provides, what happened to me. Until recently, my days at the university passed peacefully. Between classes and classmates, I had to be careful to hide my pastime. Around six in the evening, I would part from my friends or my girlfriend with any excuse and rush toward the semi-abandoned bathroom—long forgotten by the administration—on the second floor of the Faculty of Humanities. In that private place, where I could establish certain connections…

The place is ideal because few people dare to enter. The smell of urine and feces floods the air; graffiti covers the doors and limescale crusts the toilets; stains of grime reach all the way to the ceiling, and the walls are filled with drawings and obscene messages with phone numbers, not to mention the incessant dripping from damaged pipes. The entrance is a wooden gate, typical of an old building, which can be locked from the inside and outside and most of the time gets jammed.

All of the above, which invites one to say “use only in case of emergency,” seems perfect to me for those… connections. None of it scares me; after all, the dessert shop where I work is infested with bugs. That said, before going in I always take a quick look around: I must avoid my social death as best I can.

In my encounters, in this and other bathrooms, I’ve experienced everything—from those that end very well (most of them) to the occasional one where I ran into a creep I managed to dodge easily.

Everything changed the day I saw him. First, I heard the creak of the door opening and the dull thud as it closed, followed by other noises at the door that almost made me step out to see what was happening. It took him some time to reach the urinals, but from the moment I saw him I couldn’t ignore him. His height surpassed the wall that covered the urinals. He looked like one of those marble sculptures, with perfectly styled blond hair, white skin, and fine features; his blue eyes, with an intense gaze and lashes that looked lined, gave him even more of that sculptural air. He was too attractive—just a little more and it would have been ridiculous. His clean image didn’t fit with all the filth, like a diamond among excrement.

He looked like a catalog model or a movie actor. However, his outfit, though well coordinated, didn’t match the era: dark brown pants, a beige long-sleeved shirt buttoned up to the neck, and black fingerless gloves. Almost all his skin was covered. Why was he wearing all that in the heat? He wasn’t a student, and perhaps because of his clothing he seemed about ten years older than me. From the moment I saw his silhouette, he felt absurdly familiar, though I couldn’t remember having met him before.

I was at the last urinal, and the stranger took the first one. We both avoided making eye contact, creating an awkward silence. Slowly I turned my face toward him; he already had his eyes fixed on me. Heat flooded my body as small drops of sweat began to slide down. The man remained calm, gifting me an enchanting smile. Catching me by surprise, he broke the silence:

“I love your hands. Do you play an instrument?”

“Ah… yes, a bit…” I stammered.

“A pianist? A pianist’s hands,” he said, moving his fingers gracefully, “are the most exquisite, beautiful, and fragile.”

That eccentric comment struck me as strange, but I justified it as nerves from the situation. Besides, his voice melted me: calm, pleasant, like a meditation track.

“Do you come here often?”

It was impossible to deny him an answer. All my objections disappeared, as if a snake charmer had annulled my will. His questions escalated to a level that made me uncomfortable, as if a cult leader were interrogating me.

At first I justified it: *he’s lost in this environment*. My impression changed when I noticed that he didn’t seem nervous at all. Outside, it was beginning to get dark when he said:

“The best encounters always happen at night, don’t they?”

“Uh… yes,” I replied uncomfortably. “And you—aren’t you hot wearing all that?”

“My skin is very sensitive at this time of year.”

I longed for someone to enter the bathroom, but no one did. It was strange for that hour. Finally, he stopped talking and came closer. He placed his right hand on my shoulder. I found myself absorbed by his deep blue gaze, but I noticed something strange about the way he walked: he leaned on his toes, almost tiptoeing, as if he had no heels.

Until then, the dim bathroom light had favored him, but up close I saw him from another perspective. The outline around his eyes was actually dark circles; the whiteness of his skin was a sickly pallor; and his thinness was even more pronounced. Taken together, though beautiful, he looked gaunt. There was something in his expression that made him seem fragile.

Just as I was about to step away, the final detail reached my nose: his smell. A mix of ointment with something else, a nauseating undertone I couldn’t identify.

I pushed his hands away and, with the excuse that I had class, said goodbye. I hadn’t even taken my first step when I felt the smooth fabric of his gloves on my arm.

“Sorry, the professor locks the door ten minutes after the hour and…” I said, taking a slight step back to try to dodge him.

The stranger looked at me tenderly, with a friendly smile on his face. His voice—calm and pleasant, perhaps in another context—uttered, “I won’t hurt you.” No, I wasn’t captivated by his charm, which seemed increasingly artificial, as if he had rehearsed those lines before going onstage.

I turned to his right to get around him, but those feet balanced on their toes were fast and cut off my path, moving with unnatural agility. His hand returned to my shoulder. My vision blurred. My fingers trembled with small spasms. I spoke in a stutter, but not from attraction like at the beginning—this time it was fear. I felt hunted.

“If you give me your number, I’d be delighted to see you more calmly,” I said, trying to break free.

He grabbed both my arms more forcefully, and his affable look twisted: furrowed brow, fixed, possessive eyes.

“Stay!” I heard his near growl.

Where had that sweet voice gone? I tried to move forward once more, but he used half his body to stop me. I felt the spasms of my pulse in my wrists, as if my veins were about to burst.

“Please,” he said pleadingly, though with a hollow tone, with preconceived phrases. “I need company.”

I didn’t want to listen. I didn’t want to see those eyes watching with false supplication. I grabbed his forearms to push him away and, when I touched him, his face contorted into a grimace of pain. Beneath both hands I felt movements, almost like a small electric discharge. Moisture from his arms seeped into parts of my palms and fingers. I felt my heart stop; I stood frozen for a few seconds.

I hadn’t let go when I managed to see his shirt, the edges where I was holding him. I noticed a dark stain spreading across the beige, and at the same time I realized that that discharge-like sensation was something writhing beneath the fabric: a larva? A worm? Something that seemed to be trying to push through the shirt.

Horrified, I turned away, flinging his arms aside. I moved quickly and, for an instant before fleeing, I looked back. He stood with his back to me, touching his arms, caressing them, and it seemed to me that two vertical, symmetrical lines were forming in the fabric—bulges that shouldn’t have been there…

In a rush, I went to the exit, but I realized the entrance door was jammed from the inside. In retrospect, I have no doubt it was him. Had he been waiting outside, hidden between the walls, intending to hunt the first unsuspecting victim? Was this his trap? The door wouldn’t budge, and I could only make out a blurry piece of graffiti on the wood: “call me, I’ll be your little devil,” followed by a phone number.

Breathing fast, I tried to push the door multiple times without success. *It had to be this damn useless bathroom!* I thought in desperation. Then I heard his tender, harmless voice: “Where are you going? We’re having such a good time,” as he approached slowly, with unnatural calm.

“Stay away!” I shouted, beside myself. I swear I left my soul in that scream.

Fear nearly paralyzed me when I felt his breath on the back of my neck and the bony hand that squeezed my shoulder with force. I knocked him aside with my arm. I pushed the door with all the strength I had left. It gave way! Finally.

I burst out of the bathroom, almost running, agitated. I took a few steps and turned back uneasily. The man came out too and stood there staring at me, with a mocking smile in the doorway. I froze for a few moments, seeing him motionless, his gaze fixed on me, without blinking. I felt as if wings had sprouted as I moved away. When I looked back again, he was still in the same place. He stayed there until I lost sight of him.

Before reaching the classroom, I brought my hand to my nose and then discovered the undertone smell I hadn’t been able to identify before. Without the ointment’s filter, it was a scent—sweet at first, nauseating afterward. I went into my faculty’s bathroom and washed my hands. I drenched my hands in antibacterial gel. I felt that nothing was enough to eliminate that smell.

That night I dreamed of his eyes. Blue, fixed, unblinking. At times I felt that he spoke to me, saying my name—the one I never told him during the encounter in the bathroom…
