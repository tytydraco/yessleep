Okay, deep breath. Here goes. This isn't easy to write, even now, over a year later. My hands still shake sometimes when the memory surfaces, unbidden, especially late at night when the house is quiet, when any small creak or settling sound can send my pulse hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird. This happened last year. I haven't told anyone the full story, just disjointed fragments, mumbled warnings nobody really understood or took seriously. But I saw a Somnus Beds commercial last night – one of their offensively cheerful, brightly lit ones promising 'your best night's sleep, guaranteed' – and the dread came back so strong, so visceral, I almost threw up right there on my cheap living room rug. I feel like I have to get this out, put it into words, solidify it outside my own head, maybe just to feel less utterly alone with the memory clawing inside me.



I needed a job, badly. University fees were piling up, a rising tide threatening to drown me, and my already precarious part-time gig washing dishes vanished overnight thanks to sudden corporate 'streamlining'. Rent was breathing down my neck, a constant, cold pressure at the base of my skull. Panic was a knot tightening relentlessly in my stomach, making food taste like ash. That’s when I saw the stark white hiring sign taped crudely inside the tinted window of Somnus Beds. It wasn’t glamorous, obviously, but it was full-time, paid slightly above minimum wage, and honestly, how hard could selling mattresses possibly be?



The manager, Mr. Henderson, was… odd. Not in an obvious, easily categorized way, but fundamentally… off-kilter. He possessed this unnervingly placid demeanor, eyes that seemed perpetually wide, holding an unnerving, almost reptilian stillness behind thick lenses. He smiled constantly, a thin, stretched expression that never once touched those placid eyes, like a poorly fitted mask revealing nothing beneath. He carried a faint, distinct smell – lavender, sharp and incongruously floral, undercut with something metallic and dusty, like old pennies forgotten at the bottom of a damp drawer. During the interview, he barely glanced at my resume, focusing instead on me, his gaze lingering, making my skin crawl as he commented on my posture ("A bit tense around the shoulders, Alex. Chronic tension severely impacts the REM cycle, restricts restorative processes, you know."), my apparent ‘level of innate restfulness’. He spoke less about sales targets and commission structures and more about the profound importance of undisturbed rest, the delicate sanctity of the nocturnal environment. Despite the profound strangeness, maybe because of it – it felt deliberate, performative, somehow – he hired me on the spot. Desperation, I’ve learned with chilling certainty, is a powerful, blinding force.



The store itself was mundane enough on the surface – rows upon rows of mattresses laid out like pale slabs in a morgue under harsh, buzzing fluorescent lights. That specific, sterile smell of new fabric, plastic, and faint chemical treatments hung heavy in the air, failing to completely mask an underlying faint, persistent mustiness, like old water damage. Overly cheerful posters extolled the virtues of spinal alignment and deep sleep technology with aggressive, empty positivity. It was usually dead quiet, the silence amplifying every footstep on the industrial carpet, especially towards the end of the day. Henderson worked the day shift; my primary role was the closing shift, 1 PM to 9 PM, utterly alone in the echoing space for the final, longest, increasingly dreadful hours.



The first concrete sign that this wasn't just a quirky retail job came with the closing procedures. Henderson walked me through them on my first day with meticulous, almost reverent precision, handing me a laminated checklist, its edges slightly softened and greyed from repeated, perhaps anxious, handling. Most of it was standard drudgery: count the till, straighten the sad little pillow displays, vacuum the main aisles into obsessively neat lines, lock the heavy back storage door. But then came the other steps. Specific. Unyielding. Non-negotiable, Henderson stressed, his smile tightening infinitesimally at the corners, a flicker of something hard in his eyes.



Item 12: At 8:45 PM precisely, commence dimming of main showroom lights. (Standard enough.)



Item 13: Dim lights sequentially, strictly starting from the back (Storage end), moving towards the front entrance. Sequence must be maintained without deviation or pause. (Oddly rigid, ritualistic…)



Item 14: Ensure the protective white sheet completely covers the Somnus Platinum Restorative display model (Floor Model SR-001). Visually confirm all corners are tucked securely beneath the frame edge. DO NOT adjust sheet after 8:50 PM for any reason whatsoever. (SR-001. Their flagship beast, a king-sized altar of memory foam and dubious ‘bio-resonant fibers’, perched on a raised, velvet-roped platform near the front window like some bloated, pale monarch awaiting silent, unseen tribute. Even in the bright daylight, it seemed to possess a subtle gravitational pull, a feeling of… passive watchfulness. I dismissed it then as the intimidation of its absurd price tag.)



Item 15: From 8:50 PM until the moment the front door is fully locked and secured behind you, avoid looking directly at the covered SR-001. Peripheral glances are unavoidable; direct, sustained visual focus is strictly forbidden. (My internal alarm bells began a faint, insistent, chilling chime here.)



Item 16: When locking the front door, listen for the secondary, heavier ‘clunk’ of the internal magnetic lock engaging after the main deadbolt clicks into place. Confirm distinct auditory signal before departing premises. (Standard security, perhaps, but the emphasis felt... disproportionate, urgent.)



Item 17: Should any unusual sounds be perceived after 8:50 PM (e.g., rustling, soft sighing, rhythmic creaking, scratching, tapping), they are to be ignored completely. Maintain absolute focus on procedural tasks. Do not pause. Do not turn towards the sound. Do not investigate under any circumstances. Complete closing sequence without deviation or interruption. (Okay, that wasn't normal building noise settling. That was an explicit warning about something specific. Something anticipated. Something known.)



I remember asking Henderson about items 14, 15, and 17, trying to inject casual curiosity into my voice, a forced lightness to hide the unease coiling tight in my gut. He just offered that wide-eyed, unblinking smile, the placid mask firmly, immovably in place. "Standard procedure, Alex. Ensures operational integrity and maintains the store's optimal sleep environment. Building quirks, you understand. Old ventilation shafts make peculiar noises, the structure settles quite audibly when the external temperature drops significantly. And the Platinum… well, it’s our premier model. Unique composition. Requires… specific handling. We treat it with a certain… reverence. Keeps the display immaculate." His explanation felt thin as tracing paper, rehearsed to the point of dissociation, utterly failing to address the core strangeness. But rent was due, wasn't it? And the stark fear of having no job was still, just barely, greater than the vague, creeping fear induced by a weird boss and his nonsensical rules. I convinced myself he was just an eccentric, maybe deeply superstitious, maybe just deriving some perverse pleasure from messing with the new guy. Harmless, just weird.



For the first couple of weeks, closing was eerily quiet, punctuated only by the hum of the lights and my own solitary movements. The hours between 6 PM and 9 PM stretched, thick with silence and a growing sense of profound isolation. I followed the checklist religiously, less out of belief and more out of the primal fear of screwing up and losing the only thing keeping me financially afloat. The sequential dimming felt performative but simple enough. Ensuring the sheet was perfectly draped over the SR-001, corners tucked just so, became an oddly ingrained, almost superstitious ritual I performed without conscious thought. Avoiding looking directly at the big, sheet-covered lump near the window turned into a strange, subconscious game – easy enough if I focused intently on my tasks, wiping down counters that were already spotless, straightening brochures no one had touched all day. I’d hear the occasional groan from the building’s old bones, the HVAC system kicking on with a rattling sigh, but nothing that triggered Rule 17’s specific, chilling warnings. I started to relax, just a fraction, allowing myself the dangerous luxury of thinking Henderson was maybe just paranoid, the rules simply elaborate security theatre.



Then, about a month in, things began to subtly shift, like a radio station slowly drifting off frequency, fading into static and whispers. It wasn't a sudden event, more like a slow seepage of wrongness into the sterile showroom air, a gradual curdling of the atmosphere after sunset.



It began with flickers at the absolute edge of my vision. Sometimes, dimming the lights near the back, moving methodically forward through the deepening gloom, I’d catch a peripheral flutter of movement – quick, dark, indefinite – up towards the front, near the SR-001 under its white shroud. A snap of the head revealed nothing. Just silent rows of mattresses fading into shadow, inert and waiting. The air near the Platinum display developed a distinct quality after dark – palpably colder, heavier, like stepping into a pocket of dead static electricity that raised the hairs on my arms and neck with an unpleasant tingle. And Henderson's signature scent – lavender and old pennies – began to manifest faintly near the SR-001 after 8:50 PM, sharp and unnervingly organic in the otherwise neutral, chemical-tinged space.



One Tuesday night, rain lashed against the large front windows, a relentless, drumming tattoo that blurred the streetlights into watercolor smears. The sound isolated me completely within the glass box of the showroom, a world away from the wet streets outside. I was vacuuming, the machine’s whine a high-pitched scream against the deluge, finishing up around 8:40 PM. 8:45 sharp, I started the dimming sequence, the clicks of the switches echoing unnaturally loud in the charged silence. Back lights off… mid-showroom lights off… As I hit the switch for the front section, plunging the room into a deep gloom pierced only by the faint green emergency lights and the watery, distorted glow from outside, I heard it over the dying whine of the vacuum.



A sound. Distinct from the rain. Not the building settling. Something else.



Soft, incredibly faint, dry. Raspy. Like a single, cautious fingernail being dragged slowly, deliberately, across tightly woven canvas. Sssk… sssskkkk… It originated, unmistakably, from the SR-001 display.



A frantic, painful hammering erupted behind my ribs, so loud I feared it was audible. I killed the vacuum switch, plunging the store into near silence, amplifying the rain and… that sound. Sssk… I stood frozen, every nerve ending alight, straining to hear, to pinpoint. Rule 17: Ignore them. Do not investigate. Henderson’s flat voice, the laminated words flashing behind my eyes like a faulty neon sign. I forced myself into motion, coiling the vacuum cord with hands that felt thick and clumsy, like numb sausages. My eyes kept darting, against my will, drawn like unwilling magnets towards the sheet-covered shape. In the dim, rain-streaked light, the white sheet seemed… deeper, more opaque than cloth had any right to be. The shadows pooled beneath it looked unnaturally substantial, seeming to absorb the weak light entirely, hinting at immense density.



I stumbled through the remaining checklist items – sweeping behind the counter with jerky, inefficient strokes, wiping it down with trembling hands that left damp streaks, setting the alarm panel, fingers fumbling on the keypad, pressing the wrong buttons twice. All the while, that faint ssssskkkk sound persisted, intermittent, sometimes pausing as if listening for me, then resuming, a bare, dry whisper beneath the drumming rain. I kept my eyes rigidly fixed – on the floor tiles, the smudged counter, the glowing green numbers of the alarm keypad – anywhere but the Platinum Restorative. My own breathing sounded ragged and loud in my ears.



Reaching the front door, key shaking visibly against the lock plate, I turned it. Click. The main deadbolt slid home with unnerving ease. I waited, breath held tight and aching in my chest, straining my ears past the rain and the frantic pulse hammering in my own neck and temples. The soft sssskkkkk seemed louder now, closer, perhaps just meters behind me in the vast, echoing showroom. Come on, come on… lock… please lock… Then, finally – a solid, resonant thunk. The secondary magnetic lock engaged with satisfying weight.



Relief hit me like a physical blow, making me sway on my feet. I yanked the door open and practically fell out into the cold, driving rain, pulling it shut behind me with a choked gasp. I stood there, instantly drenched, shivering uncontrollably, heart pounding against my sternum as if trying to escape, staring back through the streaming glass. The showroom was a pit of shadows, rows of mattresses like pale, silent tombs waiting for occupants. The white sheet over SR-001 was just a shape in the gloom. Still. Unmoving. Silent once more.



It was the rain, I told myself fiercely, teeth chattering from cold and adrenaline, the words a desperate litany. The wind whistling through a hidden roof vent. My imagination, stressed and isolated and chronically sleep-deprived, running wild in the creepy, empty store at night. But the feeling of profound wrongness, the chilling certainty that something else had been aware of me in there, listening, watching me move through the darkness, settled deep in my bones like a cold, spreading infection.



The following week, Henderson was on vacation – attending a mandatory "corporate sleep wellness and synergy retreat," according to a clinically worded memo left on the desk. A temp manager, Sarah, covered his shifts. Young, bright, blessedly, achingly normal, she seemed blissfully unaware of the store's... latent atmosphere, humming cheerfully as she worked. On her last day, she offered to close with me, "Just so I can officially sign off on these insane Henderson protocols," she'd said with a conspiratorial eye-roll that felt like a lifeline. We went through the checklist. When we reached the peculiar steps regarding SR-001 – the sheet, the specific timing, the avoidance, the sounds – she chuckled, shaking her head.



"Henderson's little rituals," she whispered, leaning closer as if sharing a hilarious secret. "He's legitimately obsessed with that one mattress. Swears it 'recalibrates the store's positive circadian energy field daily,' or some other pseudo-scientific garbage he picked up at a seminar."



As we dimmed the lights, she wasn't meticulous about the sequence, flicking switches almost carelessly, humming a pop song. And when we got to Item 15, avoiding looking at SR-001, she laughed outright. "Seriously? It's a thousand pounds of foam and springs, Alex. What's it gonna do, develop sentience and critique my posture?" She deliberately turned, making a show of peering directly at it. "See? Just a big lumpy rectangle under a perfectly ordinary sheet-"



She stopped. Dead stop. Mid-word, mid-gesture. Her smile evaporated instantly, wiped clean, leaving her face slack with sudden, stark confusion, which quickly morphed into dawning, horrified apprehension. Her eyes widened, fixed on the SR-001. The store fell utterly silent, save for the low, omnipresent hum of the emergency lights. Streetlights outside cast long, skeletal shadows that seemed to converge, deepening into an unnatural darkness around the SR-001 platform.



"What?" I whispered, the ice from the rainy night returning with a vengeance, prickling my skin, constricting my throat. "Sarah, what is it?"



"Nothing," she stammered, far too quickly, turning back sharply, her face pale. Her voice was thin, strained, trembling slightly. "Nothing. Just… the lighting in here at night is seriously messed up. Makes… makes shapes look… wrong. Really distorted." But her earlier breezy confidence was shattered, replaced by a brittle, palpable fear that radiated off her in waves. She rushed through the remaining closing tasks, her movements abrupt, jerky, clumsy. Her eyes kept flicking nervously towards the front window, towards the sheet-covered bed, even as she desperately, obviously, tried not to. When we locked up, she mumbled a hasty goodbye without meeting my eyes and practically sprinted to her car, fumbling her keys, tires squealing sharply on the dry asphalt as she peeled away into the night as if fleeing for her life.



I never saw Sarah again. When Henderson returned the following Monday, looking infuriatingly tanned, rested, and placid – almost glowing – I cautiously asked about her, if she’d left any notes. He just gave the wide-eyed smile, that mask sliding effortlessly back into place, his gaze sliding past my shoulder towards the showroom floor, lingering for a moment on the SR-001. "Her temporary assignment concluded precisely as scheduled, Alex. A temporary measure, efficiently fulfilled, as planned." His tone was utterly flat, devoid of inflection or curiosity, discouraging further inquiry with chilling, absolute finality. The implication hung heavy and cold and suffocating in the air between us. Sarah broke the rules. Sarah saw something. Sarah was gone.



After Sarah's departure, after that night of shared, unspoken terror, the sounds escalated, becoming bolder, more frequent, less ambiguous. Not just the dry scratching, but the other sound, the one that truly burrowed under my skin and began to colonize my waking thoughts. A soft, rhythmic presence. Like slow, quiet breathing, but deeper, more resonant, possessing a strange, heavy, organic texture. Like air being steadily drawn into and expelled from something ancient and impossibly worn, like enormous, cracked leather bellows working gently, patiently, rhythmically, in the suffocating dark behind me. Huuuuh… huuuuh… It always started immediately after 8:50 PM, after the final light switch clicked off, always seemed to emanate directly from SR-001. Ignoring it became a nightly ordeal, a white-knuckled battle of will against my own screaming senses and the rising tide of raw panic that threatened to engulf me.



Over those final two weeks, the dread became a constant companion, a heavy shroud clinging to me even in daylight, tinting everything with grey anxiety. My shifts transformed into exercises in controlled terror, bordering on complete dissociation. I moved through the motions – checklist, vacuum, wiping, locking – like an automaton, functioning on autopilot while my ears strained in the gloom, cataloging the soft, impossible, sickeningly organic sounds that seemed to swell and fade behind me with horrifying regularity. I started dreading the approach of 8:45 PM like a condemned man awaiting the final, inexorable turn of the clock's hand towards midnight. Sleep became a forgotten country, fragmented and shallow when it came at all, haunted by faint rustling sounds and rhythmic sighs I couldn't be sure were real or just echoes permanently lodged in my exhausted, fraying brain. I thought constantly, obsessively, about quitting. Just walk out, mid-shift, leave everything, never look back. Forget the money, forget the degree. But the rent was still due, my bank account was a gaping wound, and the relentlessly logical, terrified part of my brain kept screaming – what tangible proof did I have? Weird sounds? A freaked-out temp? An odd feeling? Who would possibly believe me? "I left my stable, full-time job because I thought a high-end mattress was breathing?" I needed the money. Or maybe, a darker, more insistent part whispered during the long, silent, terrifying hours, maybe I needed undeniable proof before I could grant myself permission to finally, irrevocably flee.



One night, perhaps the third or fourth before the end, the low huuuuh sound was joined by something new, something sharp that cut through the dread. A faint, intermittent tap… tap… tap… Dry, light, yet insistent. Like something hard – a long fingernail? a sharpened piece of bone? – gently, deliberately rapping against the inside of a thick cardboard box, testing its confines. It came, undeniably, from the SR-001. My hand froze on the penultimate light switch, the one bathing the front third of the store in weak, revealing light. A powerful, primal, almost overwhelming urge surged through me – flip the lights back on, consequences be damned, stride over there, rip off the sheet with both hands, and see what the hell was making that noise, what was trapped or waiting inside. My fingers actually tightened on the cool plastic switch, ready to defy everything, ready to know. But then Rule 17 slammed back into my mind with the force of a physical blow, Henderson's placid, smiling, utterly inhuman face superimposed over the memory of the laminated text. Do not investigate. Maintain absolute focus. Complete the sequence without deviation. Cold sweat broke out on my forehead, trickling into my eyes, stinging. I forced my hand down, plunging the area into deeper shadow, and practically ran through the rest of the closing procedures, the insidious tapping sound seeming to follow me, echoing slightly in the cavernous space, all the way to the front door. That night, the ingrained fear, the conditioning, the sheer power of the rules, was still stronger than the desperate need for proof. But it was terrifyingly close. The internal battle left me shaking.



The worst night… the last night… arrived cold and unnervingly clear. An unnaturally still night, the silence outside the store profound, absolute, offering no cover, no acoustic distraction, amplifying every sound within. I was already frayed beyond measure, running on stale coffee and sheer, brittle, vibrating adrenaline. I’d barely slept the previous night, convinced the rhythmic creaking from my own cheap mattress frame across the room was syncing up with something else, something distant and resonant and waiting. Walking into the brightly lit, cheerful, utterly mundane showroom that afternoon felt like willingly stepping into a meticulously baited, brightly illuminated trap designed just for me.



I performed the closing rituals with the hyper-focused, trembling precision of a bomb disposal expert handling unstable, sweating explosives. Dimming sequence perfect, each click deliberate, final, echoing. Checked the sheet on SR-001 – completely covered, corners tucked tight, its smooth white surface betraying nothing in the residual light filtering from the street. Avoid looking. Don't look. Don't fucking look. The huuuuh… huuuuh… sound started almost the instant the main lights extinguished, louder tonight, sharper, more… present, seeming to occupy the air itself. My hands were slick with sweat as I fumbled with the cash drawer keys, dropping them once with a clatter that echoed like a dropped tray in the silence, making me jump violently.



I was wiping down the front counter, forcing myself with monumental effort to keep my back mostly to the showroom, focusing intently on the repetitive squeak of the damp cloth on the laminate surface, trying to anchor myself to the mundane. The rhythmic huuuuh… huuuuh… was constant now, a heavy bass note under the crushing silence, seeming to vibrate not just in the air but deep within my own chest cavity. And then, the other sound returned, weaving through it, louder and hideously more distinct than ever before. A wet, soft clicking. Viscous. Lingering. Like teeth coated in thick, stringy saliva gently clicking, chattering together with slow deliberation. Click-uh… click-uh… huuuuh…



A wave of bile rose hot and stinging in my throat, cold sweat plastering my hair to my temples. Ignore it. Maintain focus. Do not investigate. The rules were a frantic, useless prayer wheel spinning madly in my head. But the sounds were so present, so physically close, so viscerally wrong, embedding themselves like barbed, parasitic hooks directly into my brainstem. I finished wiping the counter, my movements robotic, detached, watching my own hands move as if from a great distance. I walked stiffly towards the front door, eyes glued to the repeating diamond pattern of the worn floor tiles, counting them obsessively like stepping stones over a black, churning, bottomless abyss. Click-uh… huuuuh… click-uh… huuuuh… The sounds seemed to follow, swirling around me like unseen flies, amplified in the cavernous room. Closer now. Definitely closer. I could feel it – a subtle but undeniable change in the air pressure around me, a localized drop in temperature that prickled my skin with painful gooseflesh, entirely unrelated to the dormant A/C system. And that smell – lavender and pennies – surged suddenly, overwhelmingly strong and cloying, gagging me, thick and metallic in the back of my throat. Beneath my worn sneakers, through the thin rubber soles, I felt it distinctly now – a faint, low-frequency vibration pulsing steadily up from the floor, seemingly centered directly beneath the SR-001's platform. A deep, slow, rhythmic thrum. Like something huge and ancient and resting, stirring slowly within its confines. Preparing.



I reached the door. Key in the lock, scraping loudly against the metal plate in the ringing, expectant silence. Turned it. Click. The deadbolt slid home with a sharp, final crack. I waited, breath trapped painfully in my chest, every muscle locked board-stiff, listening with an intensity that felt like it might rupture my eardrums. The sounds continued, hideously clear in the charged silence. Right behind me. So close I felt a phantom breath on the back of my neck. Click-uh… huuuuh… The vibration in the floor seemed to intensify for a sickening second, a heavy, deliberate pulse.



Thunk. The heavy magnetic lock engaged with satisfying, heavy, absolute finality.



Relief crashed over me, dizzying, nauseating, almost bringing me to my knees. My legs threatened to buckle. I gripped the cold metal handle of the door like a drowning man gripping wreckage, ready to burst out into the clean, cold, blessedly normal night air and run until my lungs burned and my legs gave out.



But as I pulled the door open, the cool, blessedly ordinary air hitting my face, something inside me finally fractured. Snapped clean in two, the tension releasing in a silent, devastating implosion. All the weeks of gnawing fear, the rationalizations crumbling hour by hour, the suffocating isolation, Sarah's terrified face flashing in my memory like a strobe light, the constant, oppressive weight of the unknown, the tapping, the breathing, the clicking – it all coalesced into a single, unbearable point of psychic pressure. Against every warning ringing like frantic sirens in my head, against Henderson’s flat, explicit prohibitions, against my own screaming survival instinct – that dark, desperate, fundamentally human need for proof, for one concrete image to validate the encroaching madness, finally, irrevocably, overrode everything else. I had to see. I couldn't live with not knowing anymore. Not one more second.



I glanced back. It wasn't even a conscious decision. An involuntary spasm of the neck.



Just a quick, furtive glance over my shoulder, through the widening gap of the door, at the Somnus Platinum Restorative SR-001 basking in the weak, sallow, revealing glow of the distant streetlamp.



The white sheet was still covering it. Pristine. Smooth. Immobile.



Except it wasn't smooth anymore. And it certainly, horrifyingly, wasn't immobile.



My panic-stricken mind struggled to process the image, searing it onto my memory forever. The sheet was pulled taut, stretched impossibly tight over something underneath. Something that was vaguely, mockingly human-shaped, but grotesquely elongated, impossibly thin, the limbs beneath the fabric looking stretched and distorted beyond breaking point, like medieval rack victims hidden under a crisp white shroud. The proportions were nightmarishly, fundamentally wrong, alien. The lump where the head should be was far too small, disturbingly oblong, tilted back at an unnatural, broken angle as if gazing blindly towards the ceiling tiles. And the sheet… dear God, the sheet itself was moving. Not just rustling. It was slowly, subtly, rhythmically pulsing. Expanding and contracting almost imperceptibly, like the shallow, diseased inflation and deflation of some enormous, pale lung. In perfect, sickening time with that hideous, wet huuuuh… sound that now seemed to emanate from the very fabric.



And from the distorted head-lump, even through the thick, opaque white fabric, I saw it – a dark, wet patch was slowly, sickeningly spreading outwards like a blooming ink stain on blotter paper. Viscous, glistening obscenely, like thick, dark saliva, or something fouler, staining the pristine white a deep, shimmering, oily grey in the dim, unforgiving light. That’s where the wet clicking was coming from. Click-uh… click-uh… A sound of… testing? Tasting the air? Preparing to emerge?



I didn't scream. I couldn't. The air punched out of my lungs in a silent, agonizing gasp that left me momentarily blind, stars exploding behind my eyes. My vision tunneled to frantic pinpricks of light. I stumbled back violently, tripping over the threshold, catching myself painfully on the doorframe, slammed the heavy glass door shut with a resounding crash that echoed like a gunshot down the unnaturally quiet street, rattling the entire frame in its housing, and ran. I didn't look back again. I ran blindly, fueled by pure, adrenalized, primal terror, legs pumping mechanically beneath me, lungs burning, the sounds – huuuuh… click-uh… huuuuh – echoing not just in the empty street behind me but inside my skull, sharp, visceral, undiluted, unforgettable.



Shivering uncontrollably, fumbling frantically with my phone under the buzzing, flickering, indifferent halo of a streetlight blocks away, nausea churning violently in my gut threatening to expel the little I'd eaten, I somehow managed to stab out a text to Henderson with trembling thumbs: "I CAN'T WORK THERE ANYMORE. I QUIT."



His reply came back almost instantly. Disturbingly, inhumanly fast. Just two words, stark white against the black screen, devoid of punctuation or query or any semblance of human warmth:



"Understood Rest well"



I never got that last paycheck. I didn't dare go back, didn't dare call, blocked his number immediately with a visceral shudder. I broke my lease the very next day, paid a crippling penalty that wiped out my meager savings and plunged me into terrifying debt, moved to a different, distant part of the city under a heavy cloud of paranoia, terrified that somehow, something might have my forwarding address, might know where I went. I threw out my mattress – the perfectly normal, inanimate object suddenly felt profoundly unsafe, alien, potentially permeable, a potential hiding place – and slept on a pile of blankets on the cold, hard floor for weeks, jerking awake at every sound, before I could scrape together enough pathetic cash for the cheapest, thinnest futon I could find at a discount store. Something I could be absolutely certain was empty. Just foam and fabric. Nothing else. Please, God, nothing else.



I don't know what that thing was, or is. I don't know if it's intrinsically part of the SR-001 mattress itself, woven into its very fibers like some obscene technological parasite, or if the mattress is just a vessel, a high-tech cage, maybe even a sophisticated lure designed to draw something in or facilitate… something else entirely. Does it feed on ambient fear? Bad dreams? The psychic residue of troubled sleep? The raw potential energy of the living? What, exactly, is Henderson's role in this obscene symbiosis? Is he a willing caretaker, tending his monstrous charge? A deluded worshipper? A detached supplier, procuring… what? Sacrifices? And the question that claws relentlessly at me during the long, silent, sleepless stretches of the night, the one that guarantees I’ll never truly rest well again: what happens when someone eventually buys that specific floor model? Or any SR-001? Do they take the thing home with them, nestled dormant in the foam? Does Henderson just replace the stained sheet, wipe down the frame, and wait patiently for the next closing shift, the next employee?



All I know for sure is that Somnus Beds is still open. Still expanding, apparently, new franchises popping up like fungal blooms after a storm. They're still running those offensively cheerful commercials on late-night TV and streaming services, promising rejuvenating slumber and perfect spinal alignment with bright, dead, vacant smiles. They're still selling the Somnus Platinum Restorative model, probably in dozens, maybe hundreds, of brightly lit, sterile showrooms across the country, maybe the world. And every single night, somewhere, perhaps in multiple locations simultaneously, someone is performing the closing procedures. Dimming the lights in precise, ritualistic sequence. Checking the corners of a pristine white sheet. Trying very, very hard not to look too closely as the clock ticks past 8:50 PM. Trying desperately, perhaps sometimes failing, to ignore the sounds. Trying to pretend, against all evidence, it’s just the building settling.



Sometimes, very late at night, when the house finally settles into its deepest silence and the darkness outside the window feels absolute, pressing close like a physical weight, I think I can still hear it. Faintly, like a phantom echo carried on the edge of hearing, or maybe just bubbling up unbidden from the scarred pathways of memory, impossible to erase.



Huuuuh… click-uh…



Rest well? Henderson’s sign-off wasn’t a pleasantry. It wasn't a wish. It was a curse. A final, mocking reminder of the peace I lost forever in that sterile, silent showroom, sacrificed on the altar of a good night's sleep. I don't think I ever truly will rest well again. Not ever.
