[[Part One]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1grekr4/theres_something_wrong_with_dr_luske_part_1)

Hello, again. I apologize for the delay in getting another report to you. I've been struggling to get sleep in my car with winter closing in. Unfortunately, I was correct in my assumption that I'd be on the run after my previous post. I've gotten word from my landlord(s) that both my office and apartment have been ransacked in my absence. I've arranged for them to handle the legal side of things (in regards to the break-ins) while I am "out of state". 

This update was a bit of a shock, if I'm being completely honest. I wasn't expecting any accounts from third parties, let alone... Well, I've attached her response email in full with what uncensored information I have for this particular patient. I have had the luck to converse a bit with the patient's family over the phone since this response came through my email that made the tone make a bit more sense.

The patient's journal apparently looked like something out of an art house horror movie, and the family had to piece the following journal entry together. Through scribbling and a madman's handwriting. They likened it to making a story from the signatures on a friend's cast. I respect them for pushing through a no doubt difficult task.

I will do my best to keep you all in the loop as I continue my research. I hopefully have a meeting later this week to collect 'Caesar's' journal. I ask for, and appreciate, your understanding as I sort through the information and get it ready for you all.

We appreciate you reaching out with your survey. I regret to inform you that my father [Name Redacted, henceforth known as 'Caesar'] took his own life in the spring of 2015. We were fortunate enough to have not been the ones to find him, but the later entries of his journal were... Troubling. I've taken the time to transcribe what I could of his entry regarding a nightmare around the time of his sleep study, as it seems the most relevant to your inquiry.

My father served in Desert Storm, prior to meeting my mother and having me. He was fresh out of high school and was just doing what he thought was right. As far as I know, while he did see a good amount of combat, he never lost anyone in the field.

I know you'll probably have questions after reading this, as we all did, but unfortunately without him here to ask... There's just some things we'll never know.

I woke up in tears. Therapist said I needed to start writing my worst dreams out, and this one... It was bad. The worst I can remember by a landslide. 

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It was annoying me, which seemed to draw me fully into the dream. Palmer was using some ridiculously stank, aloe lip balm, which wasn't out of character or anything. So why was I agitated? Ah, that's right. We're holed up in some God forsaken Iraqi village, and this idiot is putting on lip balm. If looks could kill, I'd have probably caught a court marshal off of the glare I shot him. 

To his credit, he flipped me the bird as he tucked the string scented offender away- Something that never fails to lighten the mood between the unit members. Palmer and I went as far back as boot camp together, with the others having been here when we were assigned or assigned shortly after. Tight knit bunch.

"Target inbound. North-northeast, two knots and closing" A voice crackled through our ear pieces. What were we after, again? Some had to have landed us in this hovel to begin with so it must be-

"Alright, we get out there, disable the caravan. Grab Cortez and jet." Right. A rescue mission and Baker was calling the shots, noted. "Do your best not to get shot out there, yeah?" 

We all agreed, obviously., and gathered up our gear. No one wants a bullet in or through them. There was something deeper than that to the agreement, though. It was our promise to each other to get back, drag the others, or get dragged back no matter what happened. We were there to save Cortez, but our mission was for all of us to make it out in one piece. That was always the mission.

We made our way out with due caution. Guns ready to go, designated soldiers watching our backs. I have to admit I'd missed the rush of it all, a bit. I could feel the adrenaline building as we set up the road block and took our covered positions. A well oiled machine that's stopped dozens of caravans over time. It should have been easy. It shouldn't have unraveled how it did.

The insurgent caravan slowed to a halt several yards away from the blockage we'd created and several men hopped out to investigate and clear the way. Mere seconds passed before the voice in our ear pieces chimed in again.

"You are cleared to engage."

Those five words ushered in a chaos of shouting orders and bullet fire as we worked to clear out hostiles and secure our captured ally. The exchange took minutes, even if those minutes felt like hours. Thankfully, we had a few close calls but no one was seriously hurt in my unit. We split into pairs and began clearing the vehicles one by one to find Cortez. Palmer and I started at the rear and moved towards the front.

Most of the vehicles were empty at this point. Some interesting trinkets left behind by now dead insurgents but no P.O.W. as of yet. Things were still so tense that I could feel my heart beat in the grip I had on my weapon. The dry heat felt all the more insufferable in these moments, when we didn't know what the next vehicle might hide. I wish I'd taken those moments to pay closer attention. I wish I'd stopped and inspected the box truck better before he tugged the cargo hold open. I wish it had been me, and not Palmer.

There wasn't really time to react. By the time we realized the truck had been rigged to blow, the shockwave was already imminent. I watched as Palmer was engulfed in flame before the force threw him against the next pick-up truck in the caravan. The stench of burning hair and flesh overwhelmed me as his body crumbled limp to the ground. It was enough to distract from my own new wounds, at least briefly. 

I tried to scream out his name, while I dragged my way over to him after the explosion flattened me out in the scalding sand. Noise came out but formed no words. In fact, I couldn't get my jaw to close, let alone use it to for anything helpful in the moment. It sunk in, finally, that a shard of shrapnel had entered my mouth as I attempted to warn Palmer. The high speed metal piece also tore its way out of the side of my face as it made its exit. 

I dug my fingers deep as I could into the dry earth beneath me as the pain followed the realization. My eyes struggled to maintain focus on the pool of blood poured from my destroyed cheek. It was everything I could do to stay conscious and yet my mind had already begun it's self mutilating guilt over whatever Palmer's fate was. We'd had one mission, and I failed it. All I had to do was keep my guys safe. Make sure they got home to their families. I couldn't even manage that?

"Roll over." A stiff kick to my rib cage and a familiar voice pulled me from my self loathing spiral. I could hear the bones crack. More new pain. More new injuries for my already overwhelmed mind to process. "Damn shame the boom didn't take care of both of you, honestly."

Each breath brought a new wave of pain as I forced my eyes to focus up on the new threat. Baker stared down at me, gesturing for the two soldiers with gas cans to get to work drenching my fatigues while he continued speaking. 

"Sorry, Caesar. This goes way above my head." He sighed, almost convincing with his feigned remorse. The smell of the kerosene and his freshly lit cigarette burned my nose. "Someone's gotta keep the casualty count up to fuel public support for the war, and all that." 

I tried to sit myself upright only for Baker to boot me in the face and put me back down. What the hell did he mean by that anyways? Wasn't it bad enough as it was with IEDs and guerilla ambushes?

"Brass says a couple dead men will bring the rest of us a nice, fat bonus." The bastard chuckled as he brushed his foot in the dirt to clean my blood off. There was so much pain as my face tried to express my rage. "Now, don't look so pissed, soldier. You're dying a hero- That girl and baby of yours back home will be taken care of real good. I'll see to that personally." 

My attempts to growl and shout a response managed nothing but a rotten gurgling that caused me to sputter and cough. The taste of blood mixed with combustible fumes... I'll never forget it. One of the others stomped my chest to shut me up, knocking the air out of me. And they laughed, the sons of a bitches.

"Now... Now, look, bud..." Baker attempted to compose himself with a long pull on his cigarette. "You just be a good boy and die for your country, huh?"

He didn't wait for an answer. His cronies had already moved out of the way. He just flicked the lit cigarette onto my kerosene soaked clothes and turned to walk away. I didn't have a lot of time to process before...

I was on fire.

I was going to die.

Every breath brought more flames into my already burning throat and lungs. My nerves screamed out yet refused my adrenaline's attempt to quiet them. The thick black smoke from the fuel made it nearly impossible to see anything. I could taste my own skin cooking off, but I wasn't done. Not yet.

One. Last. Mission.

With every ounce of will power I could muster- Every drop of adrenaline I could pull from my battered, dying body- I dragged myself to my feet. I must have looked like a spectre of revenge as I forced one foot, then the next towards the retreating Baker. Every step I took was borrowed from time I didn't have left. With both arms reaching out, I got so very close...

But I failed again. I collapsed into the sand, succumbing to the flames and my wounds. The sound of my former comrades laughter echoed about my mind over the crackling of my body burning. Everything went dark, and I woke up in the bed.

I've spent the last few days dwelling on this dream. Not only because of how vividly, viscerally painful it was but... Because I can't shake the grief over Palmer's death. Over Baker and the other's turning on me. I mourn, but I know full well that none of them existed. I never served with any of them, nor did I see Iraq. I was stationed in Egypt, and only saw skirmishes so... Why? Why does it feel like I lost a brother? Why can I remember drills with them all so vividly?

I don't understand. I want to understand. I don't want to be afraid to go back to sleep anymore.
