I will be dead soon and become a part of this....thing. I want to warn you and anyone else who reads this to stay away from the forests In Arkansas for I don't know how far it's corruption has spread. 

I had always loved the forest. There was something about the way the trees swayed in the breeze, the way the sunlight filtered through the leaves, that made me feel at peace. But that all changed when I encountered the creature.

It was a beautiful day, the kind of day that makes you want to be outside. So I decided to take a walk through the forest, to clear my head and enjoy the beauty of nature and remove the stress of my upcoming college exam. But as I walked, I started to notice something strange. The trees were withering, the leaves turning brown and brittle. It was like something was sucking the life out of them.

At first, I thought it was just a natural occurrence, something that happened from time to time. But as I continued to walk, I noticed that the decay was spreading. The grass was turning yellow, the flowers were wilting, and even the air itself seemed thick with decay and even smelled faintly of rusty iron.

That's when I saw it. A strange, pulsating mass of fungus, growing on the side of a tree. At first, I thought it was just a harmless plant, but as I got closer, I could see that it was alive. The tendrils reached out, pulsing with a sickly green glow, and I could feel my skin crawl with revulsion.

I tried to back away, but it was too late. The tendrils lashed out, wrapping themselves around my arms and legs, pulling me closer. I could feel them burrowing into my skin, their touch like a thousand needles piercing me all at once.

The pain was unimaginable. It was like nothing I had ever felt before, a searing agony that threatened to consume me. But even worse than the pain was the feeling of decay. It was like the creature was sucking the life out of me, consuming my very essence and leaving me a hollow shell.

I don't know how long I was there, trapped in the creature's grasp. It felt like an eternity, but it could have been only minutes. When it finally released me, I stumbled away, my body wracked with pain and exhaustion.

But the worst was yet to come. As I stumbled through the forest, I could feel the decay spreading through my body. My skin was turning black and flaking away, my hair falling out in clumps. I could feel my muscles wasting away, my bones turning brittle.

I knew I was dying, but even worse than that, I could feel the darkness spreading through my mind. It was like the creature was infecting my very thoughts, consuming my sanity and leaving me a mindless husk.

I don't know how I managed to make it back to civilization. It was like some primal instinct drove me forward, pushing me through the pain and exhaustion. But when I finally collapsed, I knew that I was beyond saving.

I can feel the fungus spreading through my body, consuming me from the inside out. I can feel my mind slipping away, my thoughts becoming jumbled and confused. But even worse than that, I can feel the creature's influence spreading through the world.

Everywhere I look, I see decay. The trees are withering, the flowers are wilting, and even the air itself seems thick with corruption. It's like the creature is infecting everything it comes into contact with, spreading its dark influence throughout the world.

I don't know what will happen to me when I die. Maybe I'll just be another victim, consumed by the darknes...Actually come to Arkansas...everything is fine. Help us.
