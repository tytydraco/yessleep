The machine hummed softly, its metallic surface gleaming under fluorescent lights. The air in the basement felt cold. You had spent years building it. Years chasing an idea—an unbiased way to measure things never meant to be measured.

Beauty. Desire. Love.

Finally, it was done.

Emma, your girlfriend, stood across from you. Her arms crossed, eyes gleaming with curiosity. Her lips curved into a teasing smile. “So, this is it? The machine that proves I’m a 10?”

Nerves throbbing in your chest, you returned the smile. "Emma, it's more than simply demonstrating it. It has to be measured. impartially. empirically. No more views. Just the truth.

Her pleased chuckle echoed faintly. "All right, Einstein. Connect with me. Let's observe how it functions.

She took a seat in the chair that had been waiting for this time. The cables were ready, coiling like snakes. You put the electrodes on her chest, wrists, and temples with trembling hands. They squeezed onto her flesh, cold and cruel. You were aware of the gravity of what was going to occur.

The machine hummed louder now. Data flickered on the screen, numbers streaming across. You leaned over, focusing intently.

“Does it hurt?” she asked, her voice quiet, unsure.

You barely heard her. “No. Just stay still. The machine is reading everything about you.”

The data stabilized, then flashed. Symmetry: 98.7%. Proportions: perfect. Voice tone, pheromones, neural activity—all at their peak. And then: Desirability: 10.

But the machine didn’t stop.

Emma shifted uncomfortably. “Is it supposed to take this long?”

You barely registered the question. “Almost done,” you muttered.

The data deepened. Her childhood, her first love, betrayal, fears—they all flashed across the screen. You hadn’t programmed it to dive this deep. It should have stopped once the perfect scores came in. But the machine kept going.

Then a new reading appeared. Desirability: 10.01.

Your pulse quickened. It shouldn’t be possible. The scale was capped at 10. But the numbers kept rising. 10.02. 10.03.

“Emma,” you whispered, breath tight. “This isn’t right.”

Her breath quickened. “What’s happening to me?” she gasped.

The machine hummed louder. The numbers flashed. Desirability exceeds boundaries. Subject exceeds human thresholds.

Emma’s body stiffened. Her skin began to glow faintly. Her features shifted, became too perfect, too symmetrical, too flawless.

“Emma?” you asked, your voice thin with fear.

Her eyes widened, dark and vast, pupils too large. She smiled, but it wasn’t the same smile. It was cold. Predatory.

“I think,” she purred, voice distant, “you’ve finally got your proof.”

Her movements were fluid, unnatural. She stepped forward, and the air around her thickened, like gravity itself was shifting to her will.

You stepped back, breath shallow. “What are you?”

Her smile stretched. “You wanted the truth. Now you’ll have it.”

Her touch was fire, liquid heat, burning through your skin, seeping into your veins. The world warped. The room shifted. Reality blurred.

The machine flickered, then died. The final reading flashed: Desirability: Undefined.

You couldn’t scream. The truth had been unleashed. Emma was no longer Emma. She was something beyond, something beyond beauty and desire.

And you were hers now. [Forever](http://www.youtube.com/@TheUnseen2025).
