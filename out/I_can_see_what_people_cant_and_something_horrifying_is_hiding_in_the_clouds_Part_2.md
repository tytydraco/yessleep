I ran back into the room and found my dad looking out in the window while he was in bed. I'm just so glad to see he's alright. Seeing his smile makes my heart melt. I wish mom was here to enjoy this view. 

"Judith, my girl, where have you've been? It looks like you've went out." 

"Oh, yeah I was just walking around the hospital." I lied to him, protecting him from the truth of the event. I know many others lie to others to protect them or just to get away with something just for themselves. But there are lies that tell people that they don't want to ruin such a moment like this. 

The sun rises very smoothly behind the clouds. It was beautiful, reminds me of the time when I was just a young kid. When mom is still here and we would eat pancakes in the middle of sunrise. Birds flew upwards in midair. The lovely grass flows with the wind. 

I felt a sensation in my chest. A squeeze that slowly pours out my own tears. But I forced to hold it back, trying not to make a scene. "Isn't it beautiful. Watching the sunrise in the early morning." Said my dad who's hand lays on the bed's fences. 

"Yeah. I just wish mom is still here." He turned his head to face me. His face said the same way as I feel. "I know. Me too." 

\-

Few minutes later I brushed my teeth, kissed my dad on the forehead, wore my uniform, and left to my part time job. It's an hour long walk, less cars riding by, and the world around me felt more innocent and harmless. There are no eyes watching me nor a creature hiding in the darkness. Just me walking on the sidewalk. The sky faded into bright blue and the clouds glow bright white as usual. 

I was kinda expecting Athena to speak out but she didn't yet. It was as if she disappeared. That's good enough for me because I don't even want to hear a single word from her mouth. Hearing her say 'leave here' bothers me till this day. If you wanted to stay in your home but others tell you to leave, you would definitely stay instead of leaving. Home is where we belong, it's always is. 

*Where are you going!* 

Then, all of the sudden, she spoke to me that made me jump with a small scream. It was a yell and she ruined my peace. I can feel the burning vibration in my chest that I yelled back. "What in the bloody hell! Don't yell you bloody jackass!" 

*What makes you think you can avoid me. I'm a part of you now and you'll do exactly as I said! We are leaving right now!*

"Oh fuck off will you ya cunt! I'm going to go to work and that's that! So don't tell me what to do because I have control of my own damn life!" 

And with that, she went silent. My peace is ruined and now I'm bothered by her irritating intentions. What's worse was that she can speak at any moment. I suddenly have the thought of someone hearing me. I looked around to see a mailman just watching me with those distrusting eyes. Did he not see me talk to her or is he just blind. 

I immediately fast walked away, ignoring his glaring eyes. Talking to yourself in public spreads awareness to others. Looking at you with those eyes that stabs your heart. But sometimes you like to talk to yourself and that you do it in a private room, just so that no one can hear you nor stare at you. Unless someone comes up behind you and you jump up in horror. 

In a couple of minutes, I arrived to Kmart, picking up the supplies, and setting them up in their proper areas. I took a look at my phone and saw the watch said it's 7:32 AM. I continued to set up the supplies until all of them are filled. There were more customers coming over and they asked me for the supplies. I did my best to give them the best offers in communication. 

Sometime later, few hours till now, I found Athena behind me inspecting a toothbrush. I actually find this really funny but I was annoyed seeing her here. To see a literal space alien observing the most smallest things like a toothbrush. I nearly laughed but kept my mouth shut till I can be able to speak. "That's a toothbrush. Just clean up your teeth with a toothpaste." 

*I know that. They clean human teeth to freshen their breaths and reduce the sensitivity of their teeth.* 

"U-huh. Yeah thanks." All of the sudden, I felt a sense of unease. I turned my head to see one of the workers of Kmart staring at me with a face that made my heart squeeze with unease. "Judith, who are you talking to?"

What he said made me raise an eyebrow. "What? You think I'm talking to a ghost?" I whipped my head to her position, showing him where she to prove how blind a fucker like him is right now.

His face gave me a sense of unease. It's as if I'm the crazy one. Until he said something that makes me look at Athena with disbelief. "Judith. Nobody is there." 

I looked back at Athena, her face not showing any other emotion. I whipped my head to the worker. He's glaring at me with those menacing eyes that made me want to just get away from this guy.  

I looked around to see if anyone is there. Nobody was there at all yet which is a good time for me to get away. "I think I should go. There's someone who needs me." 

I turned around to walk away, not wanting to keep looking at his eyes, not wanting to see him ever again. 

"You're such a bitch." I turned around, face to face with that bloody trunchball cunt with the growing heat inside my chest. "The bloody hell you just said to me!" The look on his face is enough to tell me he was insulted, that's good for me. 

"Oh right. What was it I just said? Right, I said you're such a bitch! Why do you even have to take this so seriously for?! This is just a part-time job and you're working your ass off of it! Ignoring every worker except the customers! You have no friends, no life, nobody! So why don't you just quit already and leave!?" 

I immediately grabbed the collar of his shirt, lifting him up, and slammed him into the shelves. I felt the urge to break his back, giving him a message not to fuck with me! A back wrenching experience that I have to keep working just to slow down my dad's cancer.

I heard him groan in pain as I gripped his collar tightly. I wanted to tear his jaw off and use it to bash his head with. "Get off me bitch! Or I'm going to kill you!" He yelled out with a tone that makes me more aggressive. 

But then I was stopped when Athena's hand held on my shoulder. *Don't. He's not worth it.* 

I looked back at her, just baffled as to what I just heard from her. Why release this asshole that dared to make my life worse by pressuring me. Before I could throw him down, my heart sank when I heard a low and loud voice coming from my right. "Judith Wednesday!" I looked to see my boss, coming after me with those eyes I looked away from. He pushed me off of the worker with his stone hard arm. He went to brushing off anything on the worker's uniform. He glared down at me with a menacing face. I looked around to see people just staring at me with those eyes that gave me so much nerve. When I looked back at the worker, a stupid fucking grin on his face shunned on me. 

"Judith Wednesday! You are done!" That's what my boss said that expels me from ever working here again. But you know what, I don't even like working here anyway. I just glare back at him and left. To leave this place already. 

\-

I did everything to find a job here, but because the people around me took videos of me and sent them on social media, jobs aren't available for me. Everyone is calling me the villain of the story. That worker was the one who started it, not me! My boss is not that smart enough to be a real boss. Instead he just fired me right in my face. That's fine anyway because I don't want to work with these kinds of people. That's not the worst part, I was given a fine to pay 8 hundred thousand dollars for the assault I've caused. That bastard really put that on me. 

Till afternoon, out in the woods, all I wanted to do was to scream and wreck everything around me. I kept screaming until I can't keep myself up. My fist slams every tree around me, breaking them into piles of broken wood. I let out the loudest and most aggressive scream I could muster in myself. Right into the bloody fucking sky!!

Then, I stopped there. I kept looking up into the sky, birds flying, clouds roam above, and a plane soaring off to wherever the bloody hell it's going to. A great burning sensation courses through my whole body that I began to sob so much. I kept sobbing that I couldn't stand. I felt hopeless, trapped, and scared. I've lost my job and I'm about to lose my dad. Where else am I supposed to find a job. I tried everywhere and they don't want me in. 

*Judith?*

Her voice. Her damn voice. I can hear her enough to make me want to just punch her in the face. "I don't want to hear another word from you." 

*...I have people who don't understand my pain too.* 

I don't need to see her to tell me she was sitting by. What she said caught my attention. A sign that there's something about her I felt a bit related to. "Yeah? What?" 

*Throughout my life, I've been training in harsh conditions. Later then, when I was sent to a world to conquer, I was met with kindness and love. I never realized the worth and value of life until they showed me.* 

*When I return to my home world, I did everything to convince them what I've learnt, what I've experienced, but they never understand. They destroyed that world which I was designated to conquer. I was furious, so furious. They said that kindness and love is a concept of lies. They don't understand what it really means. What it really truly means to me.* 

This is the first time I ever heard her being so sympathetic and soothing. From what I've learnt from her, I felt I can relate to her. At this moment, I'm getting to learn about her. I guess she doesn't have a cold heart. But what distances myself from her is her plan of revenge. 

There is one question I wanted to ask her. "Can I get people to believe I didn't start this?"

*It's hard and complicated to achieve redemption from others. They won't forgive easily. It takes time. But there are people who will never understand nor forgive.* 

That really gives stitches in my heart. Felt like I want to lash out at other people just to make them believe me. 

*I tried everything to convince others I've changed, but they wouldn't listen when they've learnt my actions of the past. The people in this world are the same. They will not listen to reason. It's not easy to to be forgiven. The best way to go is to move onward. Not backwards.*

The words she said reminds me of my mother. Before she died, she told me many things. 

**Don't give up on the things you hold dear. Even in the most bad moments.**

**It's ok to cry. Me and your daddy cry too.** 

**Love is more better and stronger than fear. Feeling scared for the people you love is also good. Because that makes you so into doing everything to make them happy.** 

I'm very happy to remember those words. How I kept them in my heart. She's another reason I still kept moving on to become stronger for my dad. 

*If only your mother was here, she would understand.* 

I turned my head to her and saw something depressing behind her eyes. How someone from another world can have human emotions warm my heart like the sunset. I totally agree with her though. My mom would definitely understand. "Yeah." 

A thought came to my mind. Where are her parents? What are they like? "Where are your parents?"

I saw her face turn blue. In a gestured way. She looked up into the sky above with those heartbreaking eyes. 

*They took care of me before I was taken to the military. They're not like any other people of my species. They loved me as their own instead of being an object for war. Mother kept rubbing my cheek, keep telling me how adorable I am and how lucky she is to have me. Father taught me his secret for planting flowers in my parents bedroom. My favorite was the one he gave me the first time he taught me them. Every night, they would always sleep by my side.* 

There are tears coming out of her eyes. Her lips were starting to shake and I can tell she was trying to hold balance in her voice. I started to have tears of my own too. 

She wiped the tears away with her tattered sleeve, now looking down on the floor below us. 

*But, all of that came to an end. My parents and I were escaping from our home world. I didn't realize it because I was just a child. We failed to escape and I was taken away to the military. I don't know what happened to my parents back then, but when I was old enough, I learnt that they're never coming back.* 

I was struck in the chest. How her parents have always been there for her and did everything to make her happy. But then all of that was taken away. My mother was taken away, and my dad, I don't know when he'll be gone. And when he's gone, I'll have no one but Athena. I'm beginning to share some sort of bond between us but I knew it'll only make things worse for the both of us. "Then we're on the same page then."

*I believe we do.*

I looked up to the sky to see a bright shining light behind the clouds. The afternoon light reminding me of my good days before disaster. I took a very deep breath, relieved to have let out all of that pressure before I stood back up. I don't hear any footsteps behind me as I walk back into the streets. When I look back, Athena was gone. But I felt she's always been there, just not now. 

When I left the woods and into the streets, Something doesn't feel right. Everyone was crowding around something or someone. I tried to look over to see who or what that was, but people recognized me and told me to back off. "How about you back off there, girl!" 

The ambulance has arrived, which means something happened that was so severe. There, a young girl was holding her dad's hand. I can tell because why else would she still hold his hand and cry. Her dad was frozen, like frozen in place as if he's a statue.

 Suddenly, I heard a loud and horrifying scream up in the sky. I was struck with horror when I look up to see a man being dragged into the sky. I asked one of the men if they had saw what I saw. "What? Are you trying to trick me like you did before?!" 

"What?! No! That man up there is being dragged up! Look!" 

When he looked up, he scoffed me and told me to piss off. This is where I'm getting to understand what Athena meant when she said about 2 different worlds. The material world can't see the cosmic. But why? 

The dad's daughter was crying so much that I wanted to save her dad from whatever is up there. I'm not going to let her suffer without a father. Like I suffered without my mom. 

I didn't waste time as I ran back into the shadows of the woods. I then formed into my other form. But there's a problem. How in the bloody hell am I supposed to get up there. "Athena. How am I supposed to get up there?" 

I turned around to see Athena behind me, making me jump in fright. "Bloody hell! Don't do that!"

*This is good timing. Our connection between me and your soul has grown better.*

"So what does that mean?" 

*Your brain or soul is connecting to my abilities. You'll feel a shock of great pain but I assure you, you'll be alright.*

I felt something growing behind my back. I can feel my bones melting into something. It was too hot and the pain was just too much for me to bear that I can only gag. I knelt down to my knees, grabbing the ground with my bare hands as my body burns like thousands of needles are raining on me.

I don't know how to explain this but it felt like those wings that grew on my back was there the whole time. Connected to my brain. "What? Why do I feel like I had that since I was born?"

*We're connecting to each other. Your whole body is changing and I'm the one that is connecting those wings with your brain. With it, you're able to learn and control your wings. So listen carefully.*

The pain finally faded away. I was met with a weird feeling on my back that gave me goosebumps. 

*The front area of your wings must be higher up than your lower area of the wings.* 

While she guided me, my wings moved as I wanted it to. It's as if they're my new arms. It was incredibly a weird and awkward feeling as I lift my wings the way Athena told me to. I was beginning to grow impatient as the man above is slowly being dragged upwards. 

*At the right timing, flap your wings by rotating them down, then quickly jump.* 

When I flapped my wings and jump, nothing happened. I tried again, and again, and again. I was beginning to stress out that I looked to the man panicking. He was nearly mere inches below the clouds. I hurried myself up but I kept failing every time. I was beginning to grow horrified that I was going to let him die. "Why can't I do it!?"

A metallic hand rested on my shoulder which stopped me and turn my head around to see Athena. 

*You need patience. Focus on your movement more and feel the flow of how you move. No rush.* 

I took a deep breath and began doing it again but slow enough for me to focus. I raised the front of my wing high, prepared a jump, and when I flapped my wings I immediately flew up so high! The air blowing on my face as I soar to the sky. It was incredible but also nerving too. I guess this is how birds feel when they fly?

*Now, rotate your wings forward, then below, you have to thrust them to go both upward and forward.* 

I did just that and it took a lot of energy to do it. The wind breezes below my wings as the pressure of them lift me upward to the direction of the source. My velocity got much faster as I kept thrusting, until I stopped to rest my wings. I'm literally flying like I'm some sort of arch angel.

*You can tilt your wings up or down, left or right a bit, just to get to the direction you want to go. But I warn you. Getting hit will result in you losing your flow, which means you'll fall. You have all of that?*

"Yeah. I think I'm getting the hang of this one." 

As I flew through the misty clouds, I felt nothing but air. Until, when I escaped out of the misty cloud, I saw what terrifies me so much. Before my eyes was a huge spider. Its body must be at least 2 human's tall. Its abdomen is just a large ring that embodies the sun's light. The whole body was gold and diamonds. Literal gem stones. And its eyes brought shivers in my spine. Its eyes are nothing but darkness. A hungry evil. Such a horrifying creature that could exist in such a reality as this. 

It wasn't bothered by my presence, instead it focuses on the man. Its golden strings pulling him up with its oily spindly legs. The man kept screaming to escape but it was futile. I immediately flew towards it at high speed, smashed its head with my shield. The spider's silk was teared off from its prey and he fell to the ground screaming. 

My heart made a harsh beat of panic that I immediately dive downward. I managed to catch him before he could land to the ground. At that moment, I realized that I didn't plan things out as to how it will go. I remembered the ambulance taking his body, so I followed it in pursuit. It was far away, but I was fast enough to catch up. They were driving through the street, to the hospital where my dad rests. 

I landed on top of the ceiling surface before I looked at the man's pale horrified face. His mouth quivers so much that I think he might die from panic. If I was in his situation, I'd definitely be much more paler than him.

Suddenly, I heard something piercingly loud from far behind the vehicle. What follows was the giant spider. There are flames inside of its sockets and I can tell it's mad. I thought if it's faster than this vehicle, it's going to catch us both. "Sir, you're going to have to listen to me. When the ambulance stops, go back to your body in that ambulance. Got it?" He didn't answer nor hesitate. Instead he was just frozen in horror. I hoped he heard me right, because if not, then things won't end the way I wanted to. I put him on the ambulance and immediately I got off of it. 

The creature was only mere inches away before I tumble it down to the ground with a kick in its face. I drag that monster to the sky, preventing it from going near the vehicle. The sun dawns at us, shining around the clouds surface like gold. I threw the spider off into the sky but it halted itself in front of me, as if there was a web behind it. The spider's ring like abdomen shines bright of gold as the sun's light shines on it. A golden, shining web appears at the centre of its abdomen, showing the threads of string. 

What I saw in there, I couldn't explain clearly about it. It was as if I'm looking at an otherworldly phenomenon. 

The spider bellowed out a loud screech that made my eardrums ring. I immediately covered my ears before I was presented a bullet of light near my face. Bullets of light are coming out of its abdomen and they're after me at a speed like a missile. 

I tried to block them with the shield but the bullets are shockingly too strong that it broke my guard.  I have to move away to avoid them. I tried to come after the creature but its bullets are protecting it. The bullets are endless and the more I keep thrusting my wings, the more exhausted I become that I'll fall. 

I'm trying to think of other ways but I don't see any. I tried to keep up my flight, took a bit of break by diving to rest my wings. But when I flew to the right, I got hit in the left shoulder by one of the bloody bullets. The burning and stinging sensation courses through my left arm that I felt like I was being stabbed by a 300 degree knife. I couldn't help myself but to scream in agony. 

I lost my flight and began to fall as my wings struggle to keep balance. I kept moving my wings around but it only made it worse. Another bullet shot through the right side of my abdomen. I force myself to hold my scream, making me groan in pain. My brain becoming so dizzy that I lost control of my flight. 

Then, I was caught by a large golden web, like I was on a sticky trampoline. I forced myself to get up but the webs are too much for me to pull away from. Is this how the insects have to go through? Being trapped by the most disturbing and unfamiliar creatures? The concept of giant spiders terrifies me. The body of the spider is more like anomaly in this world which makes sense to be afraid of. 

The spider from above is moving slowly. Very slowly. Either it's trying to intimidate me or make me afraid of death. If I died saving a kids dad, but recognized as a complete villain, will I die as a nobody or just someone to be hated? If I die here and that thing lives, it will keep eating more innocent people without anyone understanding why. I began to panic from the thought that the creature will take away my own dad at any moment. 

My heart beats in my chest hard and threatening that I began to force myself to get back up. The sticky webs stretches as I pull my arms away. I put so much strength to it that I gritted my teeth out of frustration. Forcing myself to get up as the webs began to weaken. Finally, my arms and torso broke free from the golden web, but my legs and wings are still stuck.

The sun before me is falling and phenomenally the moon started to appear. 

The golden webs in its abdomen is disappearing. But that's not it. Its eyes turned from flames into unholy human eyes. Its face started to mutate into a human like head with a jaw that stretched much farther down than any normality. The sound a loud grinding flesh and bone from the spider send chills in my blood.

The golden sunlight web I sat upon turned from sticky to hard like metal. I looked to the web, watching it turn into diamond like silk. It looked so beautiful and pretty that people would love to use this as a jewellery set. 

I grab hold to the web, feeling its crystalized surface as my wings and legs are free. When I look back to the giant spider, it was moving much slower as if the moon affected it. Its web at the centre of its ring like abdomen shines bright as heaven. When I say heaven, I mean it. It's a light that shines just like it, which questions god's intentions.

The giant spider started to shake violently as large tumors start appearing around its body, as if it was about to explode. Long and pale human arms exploded our of the tumors, flailing around like a rag doll. Its screech becomes more humane and distorted. How am I still able to comprehend those things? I think it was Athena. 

Its arms stopped flailing and began to drag itself towards me like an animal. I don't want to go near its sharp long hands. 

I forced to pull the web close but accidentally ripped it off from the layers. I began to fall to the earth with a long string in my hand. My wings still can't fly due to the injuries I have in my abdomen and my left arm. 

I thought of an idea. At least cause some damage to it. I pulled the string of diamond silk in my hands, then threw it at the giant humanoid spider like a rope. The silk successfully wrapped around its body by its arms. I held the web tight before I stopped falling.

I can hear far above that its screaming from how tight the silk wrapped and my weight tightening it more. The giant spider didn't fall with me, instead it's still there. It's as if in this world it doesn't matter to it at all. 

I took the time to inspect my injury and saw that I was slowly healing. There's blood coming out of the sockets and to my uniform. The sockets are stitching back to each other as strings of flesh and metal seaming together to repair. My pain slowly drifting off of my flesh. I was relieved that I'm able to heal. If I come back to my dad with holes like this, he would freak out. 

The giant spider is still closing in on me with the same menacing eyes others look at me with, but it's far more darker than that. I tried to dive downwards but I can't. With the string in my hand, my strength and velocity can't seem to pull it down. What was I supposed to do. I can't get close to it at all. 

That's when I understand what it's doing with its arms. It's pulling itself, as if struggling to come down. I flew upwards, thrusting my wings with my strength. The string of silk pulled the giant spider towards my direction. I then whipped the silk like a whip and threw it by the time the giant spider's weight stretches backwards. 

It soars into the moon like a beam of light. Shockingly terrifying, it went through the moon's body like a bullet shot through wood. Was it my strength or is it something had to do with the changes to that giant spider. 

I thought it was over until I looked far up to see something coming towards me. My heart nearly exploded when I saw that it grew so massive, larger than earth. Its face glared down on me with those humane eyes that burns in my soul. My whole body runs cold that I froze in horror.

I don't know what to do at this point. It's too gigantic, I don't think I can do anything about it but to watch. I felt hopeless, dumbfounded to what I've done. I shouldn't have thrown it off into space. But I did and now it's my fault. I thought this would be over already but now I'm not so sure it will be. I saved the daughter's dad though, that's good. But soon, everybody is going to die because of this. I guess everyone is right to call me the villain. 

*We can stop it.* 

Her voice caught my attention. "How?" I turned my head to look at her. There's an alien structured bow in her hand. The bow's surface is of metallic material and a curved white metal shell that shields the front of the riser. There are small glowing eccentric wheels that hold the blue bright bow string. 

She reached it to me, encouraging me to take it. I haven't been doing archery for a very long time, since before dad got cancer. My dad and I go through archery lessons together, learning how to shoot and have fun shooting apples and cans.

I took the bow in my hands and inspect it. "What am I supposed to do with this? Where are the arrows?"

*The arrow comes from the energy in your soul. Since we're fused together, it's quite stronger than the arrow I shot before we met.* 

"Where are the arrows?"

*Position yourself like you usually do in archery. Pull the bowstring and it'll appear.* 

I took my position perpendicular and lift the bow to my front with my fingers hooked to the bowstring. The limbs of the bow is really strong and durable that I had to pull the bowstring with a bit of force that the wheels stir with the sound of gears. 

I look up at the face of the titanic humanoid spider, facing me with those menacing eyes. As I pull the limbs under more tension by pulling the bowstring, something sparked at the edge of my right eye like sparkling light. An arrow so bright as blue appeared at the belly of the bow. It was a terrifyingly beautiful arrow, as if I'm looking at something that came from the stars heart. 

I immediately push back my hooked finger and snap the arrow forward. The limbs stretched back to its brace position with such heavy force that the arrow shot into space in a form of a beam, fast as the speed of light or even more faster. It shot through the clouds beneath a second, separating it massively. 

In just a second, the spider's humanoid head exploded into scattered pieces. A terrible and horrifying blue explosion came out of it with pieces of its bone and flesh shooting out. Chills went around my whole body, rendering me frozen in place as I flap my wings. The scenery was too much for me to comprehend that I immediately flew down to the ground. I didn't pay much attention to my surroundings. I just want to get it all out of my chest. 

I didn't want to look back but I was too curious to know what had happened to it. It was gone. Disappeared as if it never existed. The sky became night and the moon got back to normal. The whole scene before me and the image of its head explodes made me vomit to the floor. I gagged as I finished vomiting out of my stomach and began walking away slowly. I was struggling to keep myself up from that moment. The silence of the world around me gave me the comfort to sit by the tree. 

"What in the bloody fuck happened?" Is what I could say out of my voice. I'm too exhausted to even say anything else but to breathe.

*You killed it.*

Then, all of the sudden, I began to smile and laugh hysterically. I don't know what else to say nor how to tell about this. All I could imagine was how did it all went from normal to this? Why is this happening to me? What have I done? What have I become now? Was it worth it? The world is changing around me and I began to feel the insanity coursing through my veins. 

*Why are you laughing?*

I looked at her baffled face and all I could say was. "This is insane." 

Slowly, I began to lose my laugh and smile. Thinking about the many people I probably saved. The creature isn't going to eat anybody nor my dad ever. 

It took me hours for me to reclaim my sanity. I went back to the hospital and ask one of the nurses about the man and his daughter. It's the good thing they don't know what I did to that worker. If not, I wouldn't know what had happened. 

I lied to her that it's for my school project. She led me to the room and I thanked her for it. When I went in, I saw the man, who's now moving and living like a regular man. He was patting his daughter's head softly as she sleeps by his side. He looked at me with those horrified eyes. "Hello? how are you doing?" I tried to lower down my voice, not wanting to wake her up.

"I'm good. I'm just glad that my daughter is alright and I'm still alive." His voice was raspy and exhausted. His face pale from the fright and terror. 

I'm very glad he's alright too. If he was already caught by that creature, who knows what's going to happen to him and his daughter. She won't have a father to be there for her graduation, marriage, and her birthdays. 

"What happened to you?" I asked, trying to act stupid as if I didn't know what had happened.

"Well, I was just having a heart attack, that's all." He was lying but I knew that'll happen. Telling people stories about flying or killing or even kicking satan in the balls would make people laugh in disbelief. I would've done the same thing too. "I'm very glad you're alive too." I said with the sympathy from my heart. 

Before I left, he'd ask who I was. I didn't tell him of course. Not wanting to spread my identity further with anyone. I'd rather keep myself from others. 

When I left the room, a voice from my left hit me like a baseball. "Hey. You must be the one who killed that creature from the sky right?" I whipped my head to see a man in a brown tattered coat. His brown hair all scribbled like a mess. He has a short beard that looked like he had shaved a month ago. He wore what looked like alien boots. "What?" 

The man sighed and said. "You, with the wings, and the bow and arrow. You shot that arrow far up into the sky and killed that giant spider. That's impressive."

Chills run all over my body, spooked as to how is he able to see what can't be seen. I tried to act stupid but somehow he sees through my disguise. "Come on. I've been killing demons for quite a while. And don't worry, nobody's here. Rather, people would just think we're like pretending or playing halloween." He chuckled with a warm and genuine smile. 

He said it as if it was something he'd regularly do and that made me think he's acting like a pretender. For a guy like himself, he's really good at acting. But what if he's not? Who is this guy and how did he find me? Whoever this guy is, he's got something I don't know. And that's what makes me fear him. "Who are you?"

"The name's Darwin Michigan. I'm here to hunt a demon that's been bothering the motion of things. But you killed it and it was impressive. That creature could destroy this planet but good thing you killed it before it does." His voice was enthusiastic and genuine, like a business man who came from another world making deals.

I grew nervous that I began to see him as some sort of demon from hell, trying to catch me off guard. His coat makes him even worse as it does make him more like from a hellish world. Is he human and what does he want from me? "What do you want with me?' 

His brows narrowed as if I said something he regarded as impolite. "I don't want anything from you. I'm giving you an opportunity."
