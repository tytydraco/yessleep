I work as a teacher in a rural town, specializing in English and Mathematics. I teach the children during the day and some of the adults in the evening, as many of them are simple fishermen and hunters. My life was cosy; I didn't need much, and I preferred the basic food. Occasionally, people from NGOs or the government would come to conduct a census or distribute medicines. As the local representative, I helped them understand why these outsiders were there to interrupt their way of life.

After three years, I began noticing something odd: many villagers were leaving their homes. When I asked why, I received no answers until I approached the village elder. He told me that every six years, they must leave their village and move to another one for a fortnight, as the elders wanted to return. I asked if I could stay behind, but they insisted that no one could remain for the night. Curious about this ritual, I asked more questions but was halted by the elder.

"Do not ask about something I do not know myself. It has been a tradition for a very long time. Our ancestors left very few records about why we do this, only that we must."

I had no choice but to follow them, taking some clothes and essentials, leaving everything else to chance. We walked into the forest, not knowing what was going on but trusting them with my safety. After more than four hours, we reached a lake north of the village. Many began to light small fires on the shores and set up places to sleep for the night. I had nothing to use as a bed and asked for assistance, only to find no one willing to help me. That night, the forest was eerily silent, save for the crackling fire and the lake. The absence of flies buzzing around added to the unsettling atmosphere. No one spoke or tried to communicate, which scared me.

At midnight, I heard a large splash from the river. Moving closer, I discovered to my horror that everyone had abandoned me. Though I had fallen asleep briefly, I should have heard them leave. As the sounds from the lake grew louder, I walked to the shore where moonlight shone through the trees. There, I saw something unimaginable.

In the centre of the lake stood a massive figure, picking things from the water and lifting them to its head. The upper half resembled an elephant, but the lower half was composed of tentacles—some long, some short, moving rhythmically. Whatever it picked from the lake, it stuffed into the tentacles. I heard faint voices chanting its name but couldn't make out what they were saying. Desperate to find the villagers, I searched but found none. Eventually, I stumbled upon an old woman hiding in the hollow of a tree, muttering to herself. When I touched her arm, she looked at me with pure fear in her eyes and ignored my questions.

When I tried to hold her hand, she screamed at me. Panicking, I looked back at the lake and realized I might have been discovered. Not wanting to be seen, I moved further into the forest. Suddenly, something grabbed my foot. Looking down, I saw a snake coming from the lake. It dawned on me that the creature in the lake had snakes, not tentacles, around its mouth. Panicking, I searched for something to strike the snake with and found a branch. After several strikes, the snake released its grip, and I ran.

The forest came alive around me as I ran—trees shaking, air rushing, bushes rustling madly. I tripped and fell numerous times but kept going. Finally, I reached a riverbank and collapsed, hearing the sound of rushing water. When I woke, I was in a canoe with two men rowing. Exhausted, I soon fell back to sleep.

I awoke again in an infirmary. A nurse asked me to remain lying down as I was badly injured. Looking down, I realized my left leg was now a stump. I screamed hysterically, and the nurse, along with another, tried to hold me down. A doctor joined them, shouting at me to stop. Eventually, I calmed down and began crying. Confused, I passed out again. When I woke, the doctor was still by my side. He gave me water and asked what had happened. Slowly, I recounted my story. When I finished, he shook his head.

"What you saw is an old myth of this place—an old god demanding sacrifices of whole villages. I never believed in that myth until now. As for your leg, we had to amputate it because when the fishermen brought you in, there were only scraps of meat left hanging on the bone. I feared gangrene would set in. It was as if the flesh was torn off."

I looked down at the stump, wondering how I had managed to run with such a ravaged leg. I couldn't explain it, but I knew I needed to get away from this place as soon as possible.
