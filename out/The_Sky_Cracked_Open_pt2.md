I haven’t left the property since that night.

Food delivery drops at the end of the gravel road. I wait until the driver’s gone, then I collect the bags with gloves on. Cameras cover every inch of my land—thermal, night vision, motion-triggered. Not that they help much. The things that come don’t trip sensors. They just arrive.

Three nights ago, the countdown ended.

It wasn’t dramatic. No sirens, no booming voice from the sky. Just… silence again. That same dead quiet from before. My clocks all froze at 2:13 AM. Every screen in the house went black—phones, laptop, even my digital watch. I could feel it in my bones—something had shifted.

Then came the scratching.

It started in the attic. A slow scrape, like claws dragging along the inside of the beams. Not frantic, not random. Purposeful. I grabbed the shotgun from the hall closet, even though I knew it wouldn’t matter. You don’t kill shadows with buckshot.

I crept up the attic ladder. The scratching stopped. The air felt thick, like breathing through syrup. My flashlight flickered. I whispered, “I’m not ready,” just to see if the voice would answer again.

It did.

But it wasn’t in my head this time.

From behind the insulation came a voice—clear, almost human, but echoing like it was spoken down a long, wet tunnel:
“Now you are.”

The insulation bulged. I fired without thinking. The blast blew out a cloud of fiberglass and something else—thick, clear slime that hissed when it hit the floorboards. My eyes burned from it. I fell back down the ladder, coughing and blind.

When I could see again, there were prints on the wall. Not footprints. Handprints. Long-fingered, webbed, almost reptilian. They led across the ceiling, down the wall, and out the back door. I hadn’t even heard it open.

That’s when I knew the game had changed.

They weren’t just watching anymore. They were inside.

I tried to call someone. No signal. I tried to leave. My truck wouldn’t start. The engine was fine—it just wouldn’t engage. Like something was jamming it at the molecular level. When I popped the hood, the battery was gone. Not stolen. Gone. No signs of removal—just smooth plastic where the connections should’ve been. Like it never existed.

So I waited.

Last night, they came back. Not one this time. Three.

I didn’t see them arrive. One second the yard was empty, the next they were just there. Standing perfectly still, facing the house. Seven feet tall. Bent like praying mantises. Skin like black velvet stretched over exposed bone. No eyes. No mouth. But I could hear them thinking.

And they were thinking about me.

I stepped out onto the porch, shotgun useless in my hands. I didn’t know what they wanted. I just knew hiding was done.

The tallest one moved first. It floated—not hovered—just… disconnected from gravity. It stopped ten feet from me. And then it spoke.

Not in words. Not even in thoughts. It just opened itself, and I understood.

“You held the key. You tuned the frequency. You brought the beacon.”

And then, suddenly, I remembered.

The cube.

That wasn’t a memory I had before. But it unfolded in my mind like I’d always known. Years ago, as a kid, I found something in the woods. A small box, humming faintly, half-buried near a dead deer with no eyes. I kept it in a drawer for years until it vanished one night.

I didn’t bring the beacon that night a few weeks ago. I activated it.

They’ve been coming ever since.

The being reached toward me. Not threatening—just expectant. Like it was time to finish something.

I don’t remember reaching back. I just remember contact.

And then—

The sky opened.

But this time, it wasn’t a crack. It was a hole. Circular. Precise. A perfect absence in the sky, revealing stars I’d never seen before, constellations that moved.

From it came a sound. Not a scream. Not a roar. A chord. Music in a frequency you don’t hear—you feel. My teeth rattled. My bones ached. And my mind… it expanded.

For one second, I saw everything. All of it. The cities burning. The oceans empty. The towers rising. The great migration between galaxies. The farmed planets. The marked species. And us—just starting to bloom. Not unique. Not special. Just another trial run.

I screamed. I think.

And then I was back on the porch. Alone.

No beings. No hole in the sky. No light. Just the ache behind my eyes and a feeling that something big had taken notice.

Tonight, I hear the humming again. But not from outside.

It’s coming from under the house.

I don’t know if they’re coming to finish something… or start something new.

But I know one thing:

This time, we’re not being visited.

We’re being claimed.
