We thought we were ready for anything when we descended into the Mariana Trench.

Our team of expert marine biologists had undergone rigorous training and planning to ensure that nothing could go wrong. But, as we descended deeper and deeper into the abyss, I started to feel a sense of dread that I couldn't shake off.The pressure both inside and outside was immense, and the darkness was all-encompassing. It was like being in a sensory deprivation tank, except for the occasional beam of light that pierced through the inky blackness.

As we reached the bottom of the trench, I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. We had reached a place where most humans had never been before, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. But, as we began our routine environmental exploration, I pushed those thoughts to the back of my mind. I focused on the task at hand, and my excitement at the prospect of discovering something new.Suddenly, our submarine lights flickered and went out. Panic set in amongst the crew as we were plunged into complete darkness.

I could hear my own breathing and the sound of my heart pounding in my ears. We tried everything to get the lights back on, but it was no use. That's when we heard it - a low, guttural growl that reverberated through the hull of the submarine. At first, we thought it was just some kind of deep-sea creature, curious about our presence. But then I saw it, or rather, the outline of it. It was massive and looming, and I couldn't make out its features, but it was clear that this was no creature that we had ever encountered before.

The next few moments were a blur of chaos and desperation. We tried to maneuver the submarine away, but it was clear that we were no match for this ancient horror. It was like it had us in its grasp, and we were at its mercy.

The creature seemed to play with us, stalking us in the darkness, and we knew that we were in serious trouble. Finally, the monster attacked the submarine, ripping into it with unimaginable force. I could feel the metal bending and groaning under the pressure, and I knew that it was only a matter of time before we were crushed. But somehow, by some miracle, we managed to break free and ascend towards the surface.

The second before the creature swam away, I caught a glimpse of it as I shined my flashlight outside the porthole.

I saw that what was fucking with our ship wasn't a creature, but an appendage. A large, black limb among thousands that led farther back into the black abyss, and within that abyss, something MILES LONG moved, the darkness shifting. A leviathan the size of a small town moving through the dark ocean, something impossible.

As we emerged from the abyss, I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders. But the relief was short-lived. We had come face to face with an ancient evil that we couldn't even begin to comprehend. The monster that had stalked us in the darkness was still out there somewhere, waiting for its next victim. Now, I can't help but feel haunted by our encounter. The memory of that monstrous creature still lingers, and I know that I will never be the same again. We had gone too far, delved too deep into the unknown, and now we were paying the price.

But, despite the terror that we had faced, I know that our journey was not in vain. We had witnessed something truly remarkable, and even though it had come with a great cost, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the power and mystery of the deep sea. The experience had changed me, and I knew that I would never be able to look at the ocean in the same way again.

The darkness held secrets that I could never imagine, and I had been lucky enough to catch a glimpse of them. But, as I sit here writing this, I can't shake the feeling that the monster is still out there, waiting for its next victim.

And I can't help wondering, what [other horrors](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/mjn4ot/the_complete_seaside_trilogytimeline_in_order/) lie hidden in the depths of the Mariana Trench?
