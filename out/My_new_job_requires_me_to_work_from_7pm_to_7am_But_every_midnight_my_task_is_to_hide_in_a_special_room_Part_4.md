On Monday, when I exited my home at around 6:08 pm, I saw a man masked with a black motorcycle helmet roaming around in the area. Upon asking about his behavior, without taking his helmet off, he just told me that he was looking for a certain address but he might be in the wrong area. He did not let me help him further, ignoring me as he walked back to, then hopped on his motorcycle before speeding off.
  

  
Commuting never felt so depressing as I kept browsing for job offers on my phone, until I arrived at work at 6:37 pm. Yeah, I do not live that far from work, one of the few benefits of this job. I met my day shift counterpart when I reached the entrance. We exchanged greetings and a few words about daily life, before the conversation moved to more serious matters. My colleague's uniform is all red and he has several rules that just seem normal, except for the one concerning the black room. Unlike me, he is not allowed to be there or even see the inside of that room. That alone comforted me in the idea to leave that circus.
  

  
During the shift, I could not chase my unease away, and before midnight, I opted for a different approach to the situation. I went outside of the building at 11:55 pm and locked the door behind me. That thing could haunt the building, but not the whole area for sure. I stood at the entrance in front of the glass sliding doors, confident that I would see this thing with my own eyes and in absolute safety. At 12:00 am, nothing manifested at the entrance as it should, leaving me baffled. Still, there was a familiar static sound emitted by the radio that prompted me to look at it and I saw its screen flickering, testifying of the presence of the entity.
  

  
After about ten minutes later, at the windows, I saw a dark grey smoke emanating from several parts of the building. At first, I thought that the thing had started a fire and I wanted to look for help, but I soon noticed something that fueled my curiosity. The smoke seemed alive and moved in a very unnatural way, feeling the whole building to the point I could not see anything inside. I do not know if it was the real form of that thing, and I wish I could get that on video but as you know, this being affects my phone too when nearby, and also I have to make sure not to compromise the company.
  

  
The show lasted for the whole duration of midnight and as soon as it was 01:00 am, the smoke just vanished. I approached cautiously and went back inside to resume my shift, hoping that I had found a hack to preserve my sanity. It did not take me five minutes to discover what the entity did while I was outside. My supervisor frantically tried to contact me on the radio at that instant, but I could not even reply to him, completely broken by the sight of all the storage units doors torn apart with some of the stored items scattered on the floor.
  

  
"I'm really sorry about what happened Sir." I apologized for the umpteenth time the next afternoon on Tuesday.
  

  
"You didn't stay in the room. Now look." My supervisor replied. "You'll not receive any payment for this week. Can we agree on that?" He added, since him and other higher-ups supervised emergency door replacements to cover the monumental blunder and the reputation of the institution.
  

  
I stayed the whole day there, observing everything I could from where I sat. Everything and everyone seemed to be set like clocks or computer programs. I could not spot any genuine smile, any authentic laughter as if all those people, just like me, only tried to get through the day before bolting out of there. Everyone was probably following rules. As for my family, it sure took a lot to reassure my wife that everything was fine, but at least, I still had the job and was about to start a new shift.
  

  
Not even one month and already so many events. That Tuesday evening, my heart remained very heavy and even more as soon as I sat in the black room at 11:47 pm. I felt trapped in a prison and frustrated. At 11:50 pm, I received a notification on the loadshedding app about an expected issue on a generating plant, forcing the electricity provider to implement an emergency interruption of supply set to start in ten minutes at midnight. Feeling empty and livid, I just responded to the news by locking the door of the black room.
  

  
At 12:00 am, the lights went out and I assumed that the entity made its triumphant appearance at the entrance. At 12:15 am, my phone rang and I saw that it was my wife calling. I really thought that my son had troubles sleeping again, since I did not even get back home that day, but the purpose of the call was much worse than I expected. We were going back and forth because of her panic while I tried to understand her but from what I could grasp, she was hiding somewhere in the house with the kids, waiting for the police she had already called, because a man with a black motorcycle helmet had broken into our home.
  

  
My heart sank when they all screamed in terror and the call ended, meaning that the man had probably found them. When I tried to call back, the screen was flickering, and I looked at the clock to see that it was 12:17 am and the entity was passing by the black room. After waiting for a few minutes, the thing was far enough for my phone to return to normal and I called my wife back and it went straight to voicemail. I tried to call the police but my phone and the radio suddenly both died leaving me with no other options. 
  

  
This was about my family. I do not care if the supervisor sees this post, or about the opinions of those who think that I am stubborn, careless or downright dumb. I grabbed my nail gun, one of the fancy flashlights, and took a deep breath before exciting the black room. I just have to reach the back entrance, get outside, get some help or maybe even use one of the company vehicles at the parking if possible.
  

  
I ran in the dark corridors continuously checking behind and in front of me. Things seemed a little bit too calm, after all, that was the opportunity for that thing to finally make a winning move. I made my way in the sea of darkness but unfortunately did not reach the expected destination. I could not make any mistake, I was at the back entrance, but instead of seeing the door, there was just a wall that soon reflected my shadow as a warm yellow light approached behind me.
  

  
That sensation overwhelmed me again. The sensation of something really wrong, something that should not be there and should not be happening. Cold invaded my back as my hair stood, my eyes became watery and I trembled uncontrollably. I suddenly remembered my supervisor's words:
  

  
"If you find yourself trapped, just make sure to have your full uniform on, close your eyes and don't make a single move or sound."
  

  
Switching off the flashlight, I noticed that I indeed had the full uniform on, up to the cap and the gloves. I handled the flashlight and the nail gun tight before putting my back against the wall. I closed my eyes to avoid seeing that thing I also desperately wanted to see and understand. The entity sauntered towards me, probably savoring the moment. I could not hear any footstep but I heard the metallic sounds of an old kerosene lantern. The darkness of my closed eyes turned to red as the lamp got inches away from my face, moving from side to side as if the entity was examining me. I was breathing rapidly but quietly enough. I wanted to cry so bad, I wanted to scream so loud, I wanted to run so fast, but the memory of my family along with that of my supervisor's scar cemented me against the wall.
  

  
"Open your eyes." It whispered, but I remained silent and still. It then took the terror to new heights.
  

  
Numerous hands then landed on my body as the entity continued the mind torture. I remained still but on the verge of explosion, retaining my tears and my urines. Some of the hands came from behind me as if they emerged from the wall. Other hands had sharp nails or maybe claws, hurting me as they explored my skin, since the entity sought a reaction from me, while it kept on whispering, asking me to open my eyes.
  

  
I went through the ordeal until a light almost blinded me and made the entity vanish. It was 01:00 am and the power had returned. I stepped forward and fell on my knees, breathing heavily in relief. Remembering my family, I turned around to see that the back entrance had returned and I heard my phone ringing. It was my wife. I picked up the call in panic, contrasting with her calm mood, as she revealed that she has neither called me nor the police earlier. She just phoned back because she missed my call around thirty minutes ago, and a man's intrusion in our home had never occurred.
  

  
I could not find any response to the baffling revelations and just hung up the call, looking around, looking at the mild wounds on my body and wondering what on earth did I just get myself into.
