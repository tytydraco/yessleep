I was watched in the woods

“Have you ever felt like someone was watching you while in the woods?” Lance asked the group. 

The campfire crackled between us as he continued, “I’d wager that you have, your skin prickling from the gaze of another.” Lance paused looking at each of us before he resumed. 

“And I’m not talking about the gaze of an animal or anything like that. I’m talking about the gaze of an intelligent being. Something that knows what you are—something observing you.” 

Chris was hunched over seemingly focused on the story being told. My other two friends were more or less uninterested but still glistened to Lance.

“Well, while I haven’t met the Look-Around, I’ll tell you a tale of someone that has—my dad.”
“Bullshit,” jabbed Jake, “you’re just making this up.”

“Hey man, just let Lance tell the story.” I said, “It’s all in good fun anyway.”

“Fine.”

“Well, now where was I, oh yes. My dad told me this story only once. One day he was out in the woods near his old house up north. He said that he was looking for some berries to snack on during a hot summer day when all of a sudden he felt as if he was being watched. He looked around trying to pinpoint the source of the gaze. His search was unfruitful so he continued on his berry hunt. More carefully than before he searched for berries and was met with moderate success. After gathering a few handfuls of berries he was about to start back home when the feeling came once again. He was being watched. However, this time he could feel the gaze coming from his back left. Spinning quickly he turned to confront the thing. He caught sight of sudden movement near a tree. Something hid behind the tree. Convinced it was another person, he called out to whoever was there. My dad strode closer, moving at an angle to approach from the side of the tree and find the perpetrator. As he rounded the tree he found there was no one there. Inspecting the area he found odd tracks. They were like the footprint of a small child. However, judging by their depth, they belonged to something much heavier than him. Disturbed, he quickly made his way home, feeling the stare of the creature on his way back. When he told my grandfather about his encounter he informed my dad about the local legend of the Look-Around.” Lance stopped and took a quick drink of water before continuing his tale.

“My grandfather grew up in the mountains of the northeast and heard of the Look-Around growing up. It was supposedly a human-like creature that had the stature of a child. The Look-Around was thought to be the result of an unholy union between a demon and a virgin. The demon had set himself upon the young woman and conceived a child with her. The child grew quickly and after 33 days, on the 3rd hour after midnight, the child was born. The mother died during the birth due to the violent way the child erupted from her womb. The child would then stare at people who were alone in the forest. It always staring from behind a tree, like a child trying to hide. That’s where its name comes from. My dad after hearing this thanked his lucky stars he escaped safely from the creature.” Lance’s tale finished with all of us in silence.

The memory of Lance’s fireside story came rushing to me when I felt it. I was being watched. 

I had set out on what I called a journey of self-discovery, though in reality, it was more an excuse to get drunk and spend time with my girlfriend. College wasn’t going well and my job had just laid me off. My response to this was to go on a road trip with my girlfriend and just forget about my problems for a while. The trip was going well until my girlfriend had to go home due to an illness in the family. Despite this setback, I continued onwards. After a couple of days, I found myself at a local campground. I proceeded to park my car and slept off the booze. 

The next morning I had awoken to a headache and bladder that needed relief. Begrudgingly, I climbed out of my car, the damp morning air hung heavy as I stumbled into the shadowed woods. I guess I must have wandered too far because when I finished I didn’t know how to get back. Now back to the present.

The hair on the back of my neck rose as the memory of Lance’s story mingled with the eerie stillness of the woods. As I looked around trying to spot it, a sudden blur of movement caught my eye, disappearing behind a tree. I took a wary step back from the tree. 

“Fuck, this can’t be real,” I muttered in disbelief.

I started walking backward before turning and hurrying away. The gaze followed me, shifting direction. I felt it from my back to my left and to my right. Then I felt it right in front of me. Knowing I had to look, I gathered all my courage and marched towards the tree. I looked around the tree to find nothing. Letting out a sigh of relief, I noticed I could no longer feel the gaze. I did however see my car between the trees off in the distance. Grateful but still disturbed, I started walking to my car. Just as I reached the tree line, a whisper slithered into my ear, cold as first frost…

“I see you”
