Hi! I'm Ash. I got hired by the Fae to hunt Fae Scorn. I wanted to share my stories with you, so bare with me as I write these between calls. I'll do my best to not leave you on a cliffhanger, I like the resolutions just as much as the next fuck. Ty for reading k thnx baiiiiiii  


I awoke to the sound of my alarm clock beeping, and groggily rolled over to turn it off. Reaching out a hand from the warm confines of my blanket, I swatted haphazardly at my nightstand, knocking my glass of water to the floor instead.

  
“Damn it...” I muttered to myself under my breath, focusing more on the alarm clock now and successfully shutting it off.

  
I rolled back over to the center of my bed and stretched, a high-pitched whine escaping my throat as I did. It was a good stretch. I slowly sat up in bed and blinked.. Blunked? Blank? I opened and closed my eyes a few times to clear away the hazy clouds that blanketed my vision. Stretching and yawning once more, I gently tossed my blankets to the side, rotated in my bed, and got up. I took one step before slipping on the water I knocked over, dropping an elbow John Cena would have been proud of straight to my nightstand. A sharp icy pain radiated up my arm because, of course, I hit my funny bone. It wasn’t funny.

  
My lamp fell over with a frustrating loudness for as early as it was, and it knocked the plug to my alarm clock out of the wall. The offending glass of water was also sent violently skittering across the floor until it shattered against the wall nearest my door. It was too early for this shit.  
I lay there for a moment as my brain caught up with what just happened. My not-so-funny feeling arm lay draped over my eyes. The water soaked through my boxers and now my left butt cheek was wet too. I want to go back to bed.

  
Pulling myself together, I rose unsteadily to my feet. The discombobulated coordination of my still half-asleep body struggled slightly during this task. I took a second to look around the room, taking it in and rubbing my sore elbow.

  
With a defeated sigh, I bent over and picked up the lamp, inspecting it for damage. Everything looked good to me. I set the lamp on the nightstand then leaned back down and plugged in the alarm clock. I set it back up on the nightstand, too. I’ll set the time sometime later. Famous last words? Maybe.  
I glanced around once more before I sluggishly made my way out of my room, making sure to avoid sharp shards of glass I did. I headed straight down the hallway towards the bathroom to do my business and take a shower.

  
I entered the bathroom and lightly pulled the door shut behind me. I didn’t have any roommates, but I’ve always had a bad habit of “sneaking” around. I often got accused of scaring people. Anyway, I stripped down, turned on the shower to pre-heat it, and then took my rightful place upon my porcelain throne. It was more like a plastic lawn chair, but you know, potato tomato.

  
Once I finished my business, I stepped into the shower. I adjusted the knobs as it was just a little too hot. And now it was perfect. I stood with my back to the shower head, water running over my shoulders and down my chest. I rolled my head side to side, getting satisfying little pops as I did.  
I leaned forward, bracing my hands on the wall and hanging my head. I started thinking about this girl from work, Phyllis. Damn, was she beautiful. She had the best personality, an intoxicating smile, and a perfect body. Right now, I especially like her body. My mind started to wander in the comfort of my privacy, a steamy scenario beginning to develop a plot in my mind's eye.

  
I let my thoughts run rampant as I pondered her form. I slowly slid my hand down my chest, past my waist, and gently \[MASSAGED MY KNEECAPS\], going faster and faster as my eyes slid shut. It just wasn’t enough. Hesitantly, almost gingerly, I spat on my thumb and ran my hand down the small of my back. Then, I \[PLAYED THE GUITAR\] as fast as I could. Harder and faster, I thought. The steam of the shower was now a thick fog that clung greedily to my skin. Sweat and dew dripped from my body. My breath became labored as my body tensed. Harder. Faster. I kept going until I couldn’t hold it in anymore, and finally, I \[READ THE BIBLE\].

  
I continued my shower and finished rinsing the rest of the soap off my body, turned the faucets off, and stepped out of the shower. I grabbed my towel and dried off my face, hair, and then the rest of my body.  I fanned my hand back and forth to clear away the misty murk that my shower had created. I don’t know why I did this, it’s not like I can make steam disappear. To further add to the “Why am I like this” questions, I wiped off the mirror to see myself in it. You know as well as I do that that doesn’t work right after a hot shower.

  
The air was hot and thick. And sticky. Hot, thick, and sticky. It was stuffy, hard to breathe. I put my towel on its hanger and grasped the dripping doorknob. With a sudden bolt of energy that tickled my frontal lobe, I threw open the door with way too much gumption and yelled “RAHHHHHhhhhhhh!!!” as I crab-walked, naked, out of the bathroom. I raised my hands like little crab pinchers while I continued my sideways scuttle back down the hallway to my room.

  
Ok look... the intrusive thoughts win far more often when you don’t live with anyone. Don’t judge me, ok? I bet you’re weird when no one’s around, too.

  
I entered my room, making little “mirp” sounds as I did. My tiny, pinchy, hand-claw crab pinchers pinching feverishly in the air as I did. I was facing my wall as I moved around the room, avoiding the broken glass to the best of my abilities. I crab-walked all the way around to my dresser before finally assuming the upright position millions of years of evolution had bestowed upon me.

&#x200B;

  
Sighing dramatically, I flopped over at the waist and began grabbing various articles of clothing from their drawers, when suddenly from behind me, someone loudly exclaimed through a barely contained laugher; “What in the actual fuck was that?”

  
Let me tell you, if I hadn’t shit before my shower, I would have evacuated my bowels with a force equal to that of a rocket launching right there in my bedroom. My stomach sunk so far through my body that I was certain I’d at least pushed that out if nothing else. I shrieked a very manly, strong, high-pitched shriek, diving onto my dresser and hitting the wall as I did. It wasn’t voluntary. I didn’t want to smack the wall, but I was startled, ok? They saw it all. They heard it all. They knew too much. I had to kill them.But that isn’t important. Who the fuck is in my room?!

  
With all the grace of a paraplegic turtle, I gracefully rolled off my dresser and landed on my head and shoulders, just as intended. I grunted because I wanted to, and not because I knocked the wind out of myself. I then thrashed around violently on the floor as I oriented myself and found my footing.  
Standing upright, I spun around to confront the person in my room. Only it wasn’t a person.

  
A tiny figure fluttered like a dragonfly in late summer in the middle of my room. I blunk hard, hoping it was a leftover soap bubble from my shower. Nope. I blonked again. Still there, it was very real. A little, chubby, winged man was right there, hovering over my bed.

  
This pint-sized guy was no taller than my smartphone. He dressed in a green, shimmering gown. His little wings, beating blindingly fast, sparkled like lights through a prism. And his hair, oh his hair was a sight. He had hair that looked like it had a passionate affair with a unicorn while still somehow also having a totally receded hairline. His eyes pierced the air with their deep golden intensity.  
He continued to look at me, growing concern obviously consuming his face. “What did you just...” He trailed off as he stared at me, slack-jawed.

  
“I uh—” I began. “I blunk to make sure I’m actually seeing you?” I basically asked him with my reply. A heavy dose of surreal confusion seasoned my words.

  
“No, no, not that.” he said, waving his hand back and forth and sinking a little closer to my bed “What were you doing when you entered the; Wait.” he cut himself off, “Did you just say blunk?”

  
"I uh... yeah?” I replied, suddenly feeling even more self-conscious than I already was.

  
The fairy raised his hand to his face and groaned loudly. “You’ve got to be kidding me!” he huffed with an exasperated sigh, “The one I’m supposed to get doesn’t even know it’s BLINKED?” he finished, his hand falling away from his face.

  
I knew it was blinked! I had it right the first time!

  
“Wow, rude.” I said, blushing from the embarrassment once more.. “And wait why are you- why is a-” I stammered, trying to find my words after my mouth already started moving.

  
“Why is there a fairy in your room?” he offered, his expression now deadpan.

  
I nodded my head slowly in agreement.

  
He seemed to study me for a moment as he thought some things over. His eyes darted back and forth between mine, and I somehow began to feel even more exposed than I already was. He ran his tongue over his teeth, made a little clicking sound, and then began to speak.

  
“I am Myff, a guardian of the realms, both Fae and human,” he stated in a voice that sounded both soft and childlike, as well as wizened and old. He spun his hand in a small forward rolling gesture. "I was sent here by the Seelie court to--”

  
“You’re a guardian of umm, both realms?” I interjected, cutting him off. My brain was not liking this.

  
Annoyance flashed across his face. “Yes. BOTH realms. The Fae realm AND the human realm. I was sent here by the Seelie court to--”

  
“What's the Seelie court?” I cut him off again, “How did you get in here? Why are you-”

  
A static-like sensation crackled forth and filled the room. It was at this moment I knew, I fucked up.

  
“SILENCE!” he bellowed at a volume far greater than anything his size should be able to make, and I was simultaneously slammed down to my knees by an invisible force that I had no hope of defying. He rose back up in the air, almost until he hit the ceiling. Bewildered, I struggled to raise my head and look at him. My knees now throbbed, my not-so-funny-feeling elbow still hurt, my head was spinning, and I remembered I was stark naked. I felt light headed and sick.

  
Myff glared at me for a moment, studying me again. I can fully understand why he’s a guardian, now. There’s no way anything could stand against this crazy power he has. I made a mental note to not cut him off again. The pressure dissipated from my shoulders while Myff lowered himself down to my eye level, floating over to me.

  
He stopped a few inches from my face and spoke “I am Myff,” he said with a quiet voice, yet booming with a level of authority. “I am a Guardian of both realms and YOU, Ash, will be silent when I speak.” His eyes bore holes through my soul.

  
“I’m s-sorry.” I managed to croak out, breaking eye contact. “It won't happen again. I’m sorry. I’m listening.” My head now bowed, and I stared at the floor.

  
Pleased by the reply, Myff began once more. “I am a Guardian of both realms,” pausing slightly, as if anticipating another interruption, “and I was sent by,” another pause and glare, “the Seelie,” pause, “court to--”

  
I violently threw up. Like exorcism levels of projectile vomit. I was like a baby, full of milk, held above a first-time parent’s face. It went everywhere.

  
“Oh for fucksake!” Myff yelled, throwing his hands up.

  
“...erm.. serry...” I slurred, wincing through the awful taste of bile in my mouth. The room was spinning now, and I couldn’t hold it together any longer. “I thing im gunna... fent.” The words felt like water leaving my mouth. I promptly fell over, listening to Myff in a rant with more cursing than other normal words. I blacked out before I even hit the floor. I was out like a light.

  
I slowly regained consciousness sometime later, my head pounding worse than a clubbed seal. I groaned and tried to sit up, noticing I was in a strange place. I sat up, bathed in soft, ethereal light.  
I sat within a circle of toadstools, their tops glowing softly with an otherworldly light. The air around me was alive with the symphony of a vibrant forest. Gigantic ferns rustled as if sharing secrets, and the trees seemed to whisper their ancient tales. Fireflies danced in the warm, golden light that filtered through the dense canopy above.

  
“What the fuck...?” I muttered in amazement.

  
A delicate voice cut through the stillness. "I'm sorry about that, Ash. I didn't mean to knock you out, but you were being quite... challenging."

  
Blinking, I turned my head to see Myff perched on a mushroom-like stool nearby. His expression seemed to dance between regret and amusement. I mustered a weak smile. “Challenging? I thought you were trying to kill me honestly."

  
Myff's wings quivered as he arose and floated closer, his eyes filled with contrition. "I really didn't mean for it to come to that. But recruiting a hunter isn't straightforward, and I thought a little demonstration might help you understand." Landing on the mushroom next to me, he continued, “When I used my magic to make you submit, I guess I sent all the blood to your legs.” He was the one avoiding eye contact now. “And you passed out from that.” He let his voice trail off, inviting me to continue the conversation.

  
I stared at the little guy for a moment. He really reminded me of a child who got caught doing something wrong and was now trying to put on a tough act, but the regret was obvious. Wait wait wait hold the phone what did he just say? Recruit a hunter?

  
“Myff, what did you mean by recruiting a hunter isn’t straightforward?” My brow furrowed and I adjusted myself to fully face him. “And also, where the fuck are we?

  
Rising from his seat, Myff whisked into the air and began to fly around the clearing. “I’ll answer your questions one at a time.” He mused.

  
He was incredibly nimble for being such a stout little dude.

  
“First off,” he started, “We are in the land of Fae. This is the realm that neighbors your own. This is a realm of nature and spirits, riddles and rules, light and dark.” Myff flew straight up into the sky, then let his body fall limply back to the ground. He used his wings at the last moment to stop himself right before impact. “As for talk of hunters, that will need more detail.”

  
I silently regarded him, waiting for him to continue.

  
“Where do I even start?” he pondered his options for a moment as he slowed down to hover next to me. “Are you aware of cryptids?”

  
“Well, sure.” I replied, putting my hand reflexively on the back of my neck. “You mean things like creatures from folklore, right?” I adjusted myself to get more comfortable. My butt hurt.

  
He nodded in agreement. “Can you tell me a few that you know of?”

  
I suddenly felt very on the spot, glancing sheepishly down as I began to question my own knowledge. “A uh... A Wendingus..” Fuck. Wrong.

  
“It’s not a test, asshole” Myff exclaimed, laughing softly at my sudden panic, “You know about Wendigos,” He said, annunciating each individual syllable, “and Skinwalkers, and the Chupabara, right? The big ones you all fan girl about?” He knew from the look on my face that the answer was yes. “As a hunter, you are going to hunt these creatures down and:-”

  
“WAIT!” I yelled, rising to my feet. “Wait wait wait woa wait what? Back it up. Cryptids? You want me to hunt cryptids?” My disbelieving shock clearly cloaked my voice. “But there’s no way, they’re not actually real!”

  
Myff chuckled judgingly at me, the little dickhead. Squinting through the sun in his eyes, he made a point. “You’re arguing with a fairy in an enchanted forest, in the realm of the Fae, and the first thing you’ve seriously questioned is the existence of something in YOUR world?”  
He had a good point.

  
“You have a good point.” I said, “Carry on.” settling back down on the toadstool stool.  
Myff chuckled again and began to settle down once more, putting the sun to his side this time. A soft breeze rustled the trees around us. “Something as simple as a cryptid wouldn’t be cause for interference from the Fae, however.” Apprehension was clear in his voice.

  
I sat still, focused intently on his words.

  
“The reason we need you, and people like you, is because these cryptids... are...” once again making that rolling motion with his hand as if he was trying to lure out the rest of his thought. “Finding ways to eat the Fae. They're becoming... fusions of lore... and magic.” he managed. Taking a pause and then a deep breath, he continued, “We call them Fae Scorn. The amalgamations of nightmare and flesh, cryptid and fae.”

  
Cryptids, the stuff of late-night radio shows, Reddit posts, youtube stories, and blurry photographs. Monsters under the bed, right? But here I was, coming face to face with a truth I couldn't dismiss. But one that intrigued me.

  
Myff's words echoed in my mind, his usually light and melodious voice tinged with a cautious gusto. Cryptids really are really real. That’s reality. It’s really actually really concerning. They're not just mythical creatures from campfire stories. They're out there, and they're feeding on the Fae somehow. Something is changing in our world.

  
I listened to Myff as he went on to explain some of the sightings, and some hybrids he knew of. I was so enraptured with his stories that I had almost forgotten what he wanted me to do. Did I hear that right?

  
“Hey, Myff.” I cautiously said, raising my hand in an apologetic gesture for cutting him off, the woozy fear of earlier not forgotten. Swallowing the feeling, I pressed on. “I don’t have any powers, I don’t have any special skills aside from my ability to crab-walk well enough to fool my cat, and I’m not brave or heroic. There’s no way you have the right guy. Right?”

  
I was starting to hurt my own feelings, Myff quietly listened. “I mean, if you’re assembling the A team, the Avengers of the Fae, you need someone far better than me.” I hung my head low and gripped my hands together, tears beginning the well in my eyes. I really wasn’t much when it came to the big picture, was I? “I don’t--”

  
Myff slapped the shit out of me. Like... Hard. With one little flick of his tiny arm against my delicate, beautiful, and manly face, I was sent flying off my toadstool chair in an arching corkscrew. I realized, as I was spinning towards the ground like a torpedo, that I was still naked. This was like doing a helicopter, but way more complicated. And horizontal.

  
I landed about 10 feet away from my starting position. Thankfully, my face broke the fall. I opened my eyes as I slid across the grass, getting a whole new look at my toes thanks to the scorpion pose I was now in. I stopped my slip n’ slide adventure in a heap a few feet later.

  
I lay still for brief moment, a weird flood of euphoria devouring my doubts. My fingers instinctively brushed against the dew-kissed grass, and the moisture clung to my skin like the delicate droplets of a morning mist. It was as if the earth itself was sharing its secrets with me, inviting me to be part of this timeless dance of life and renewal.

  
In that tranquil moment, lying in the midst of the sun-dappled field, I felt connected to the earth in a way I'd never experienced before. The dreamy sensations of dewy grass on my face were a reminder that nature's beauty was not just something to behold but to be immersed in—a gift to be cherished, a source of endless wonder.

  
I was the silver lining of lofty cloud. I felt like I was soaring.

  
I pushed myself up with the skill equivalent to that of toddler. I felt all... wibbly wobbly. I felt wrong. Something I was seeing wasn’t right. What is it? The dreaminess made it hard to pinpoint. I closed my eyes, focusing on my breathing until the haziness began to clear away, and then I opened my eyes. I knew what it was right away. My head was wrong. Like, it was backwards. I was staring at my own butt, it didn’t look half bad if I’m being honest. But this isn’t good. Did Myff break my neck?!

  
“MYFF!” I screamed in my manly, high pitched, warbly voice, “AHHHHHHHHHHH!” The sound was unvoluntary, flapping my arms like a baby birb kicked from its nest. I sounded like a gargoyle in heat. I think. I guess that’s what they sound like, I don’t know. I’ve never heard one before. Anyway.

  
“AHHHHHHHH!” Myff mirrored my screams as he rushed to my side.

  
“AHHHHHHHH!” I screamed again.

  
“AHHHHH!” Myff screamed, now flying around me.

  
“MYFF! OH MY GOD! WHAT THE FUCK!?” I screamed while I tried to figure out how to turn my body with this new perspective. If I walked forward, I went backward from my perspective. But if I tried to walk backward, my legs were also on the wrong side. My brain didn’t know how to process fine motor skills. I settled for unsteady shaking and stumbling since that seemed to turn me well enough. I was trying to see Myff.

  
Where the fuck was Myff?!  


\*Sorry guys I gotta go! Duty calls! It's a fucking Gargoyle Redhat! Wish me luck!
