I wasn’t looking for trouble. I was just looking for a cheap laptop.

I do freelance graphic design on the side, and my old laptop was barely holding on. I couldn’t afford anything brand new, so I started checking Facebook Marketplace, eBay, and local listings for a decent second-hand machine.

Eventually, I found a listing that seemed too good to be true—a nearly new Dell XPS 15, powerful specs, barely used, for only $300. The guy selling it said he was moving out of the country and needed to get rid of it fast.

Normally, I’d be skeptical. But he seemed legit. Good reviews on Facebook, normal profile, nothing sketchy. So, I met him in a busy Starbucks, checked the laptop over, and everything seemed fine. Clean, working, no issues.

I paid in cash, shook his hand, and left.

I should’ve left it at that.

The First Red Flag
That night, I booted up the laptop. The first thing I noticed was that it hadn’t been factory reset. There was still a user profile named “Admin” on it.

Not unusual—some people forget to wipe their machines. I figured I’d just reset it myself. But before I did, curiosity got the better of me. I wanted to see if there were any old files left behind.

I opened the Documents folder. Empty.
Checked Downloads. Nothing.
Then I opened the Videos folder.

And that’s when things got… weird.

The Videos
There were three video files.

01.mp4
02.mp4
03.mp4
No names, no descriptions. Just numbers.

At this point, I was still assuming it was something dumb—maybe an old school project, or personal recordings the guy forgot to delete.

So, I clicked on the first one.

The screen was completely dark. No audio. Then, about 10 seconds in, the camera adjusted, and I saw… a hotel room.

A cheap-looking one. Yellowish lighting, a single bed, a nightstand with a digital clock. The time on the clock read 3:13 AM.

For the first minute, nothing happened. Just a still shot of the empty room. Then, suddenly, the door opened.

A man walked in, wearing a hoodie. His face was hidden. He moved to the nightstand, placed something down, then left. The video ended.

I frowned. What the hell was that?

I clicked on 02.mp4.

Same hotel room. Same angle. But now, there was a woman sleeping in the bed.

I felt a chill crawl up my spine.

She looked normal, like any random person. The time on the clock said 3:47 AM. For nearly two minutes, she just slept. Then, the door opened again.

The hooded man entered. He stood there for a moment, just watching her.

And then…

The video cut to black.

The Third File
I didn’t want to open the last one.

But at this point, my hands were shaking. My gut was telling me I had just stumbled onto something I wasn’t supposed to see.

I clicked on 03.mp4.

The screen was dark at first. Then, after a few seconds, the camera adjusted again. But this time, it wasn’t the hotel room.

It was a parking lot.

I recognized it instantly—it was the Starbucks where I had met the seller.

And in the center of the frame was me.

I was sitting at a table, inspecting the laptop, completely unaware that someone was filming me.

The video cut off after 10 seconds.

I slammed the laptop shut, my heart racing.

The Aftermath
I don’t know how long I just sat there, staring at the laptop, my mind racing.

What the hell had I just seen? Was it real? Was it staged? Was I in danger?

I grabbed my phone and tried calling the seller. Number disconnected.

His Facebook profile? Gone.

Panic started setting in. I debated going to the police, but what would I even say? "Hey, I bought a used laptop and found some creepy videos on it?" They’d probably brush it off.

But the last video—the one of me—changed everything. Someone had been watching me.

I didn’t sleep that night. I kept checking my windows, jumping at every sound.

The next morning, I took the laptop and drove straight to a computer repair shop. I told the tech guy I needed a deep wipe of the system—no backups, no recovery, just a complete wipe. He looked at me like I was crazy but agreed.

I watched as he erased everything, then reset the machine.

After that, I sold the laptop the very next day. I didn’t care about the money. I just wanted it gone.

But Here’s the Thing…
That should’ve been the end of it. But last night, something happened that I can’t explain.

At 3:13 AM, my phone buzzed.

Unknown Number: “You shouldn’t have watched those.”

I stared at the message, my hands shaking. Then, a second text came in.

Unknown Number: “Be careful.”

No threats. No demands. Just… a warning.

I blocked the number. But I know that doesn’t mean anything.

Because someone, somewhere, knows that I saw those files.

And I don’t think they’re finished watching me.
