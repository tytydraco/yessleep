My boyfriend and I had always wanted to get a cat–a furry little companion to complete our
small family. We had no idea it would be so easy. Everything changed one night when he came into our lives.

We found him on a cold autumn night, the air sharp with the scent of damp leaves and city rot. We were just out for our innocent weekly garbage dump, we barely noticed him at first. There he was, huddled against the alley bins behind our building—a shivering bundle of tangled fluff. Just a stray, but something about him caught our hearts immediately. His fur looked like it had been painted on by unsteady hands, stripes running into speckles, dark smudges forming shapes along his back. Such an interesting look. His ears were too large, sprouting long, curling tufts like tendrils. And his eyes—huge, glassy, too round for his narrow small face—glowed faintly in the dim streetlight, reflecting the night like orbs.

He looked up at us, tilting his head as if he recognized us. That’s when we noticed his
paws—massive compared to his small frame—and those tiny fangs, just barely peeking over his lower lip. So strange. So impossibly adorable in that ugly-but-cute kind of way.

We joked that we’d been chosen by the “cat distribution system.” He was ours now. Or, perhaps we were his.

At first, everything was lighthearted. We laughed at his quirks—his unnatural ability to jump higher than seemed possible, the way he twisted midair, snatching his toys from our hands with impossible precision. At night, he had this habit of stalking our ankles—giving us little love nibbles or gentle taps with calculated swipes before bounding away.

He especially loved playing his own version of “red light, green light.” The second we looked at him, he froze—getting low to the floor, butt shifting. The moment we turned away, he moved.

We brushed it off as simple play. Tons of cat’s online do this.

It was cute.

Until it wasn’t.

The shedding started slowly.

Stray tufts of fur on the couch, a few extra hairs on our clothes. Then, we began finding the full clumps. Matted, twisted little wads of his fur appearing overnight, gathering in corners, clogging the vacuum. It was too much, too fast. We were worried. Maybe he was sick. The vet assured us he was fine—though they couldn’t pin down his breed.
“Maybe a hairless cat transitioning,”they joked.
“Or something exotic.” Odd, but possible. I mean, we had no idea either.

The strangest part of this was the fur always grew back. Fast.

And he was growing, too.

At first, it was subtle. A little bigger than last week. His paws, his ears, his nails—everything
lengthening in grotesque increments. We trimmed his claws religiously, only to find them sharp again within hours. His scratching posts were reduced to splinters in days—resulting in
purchasing a new post for him every week.

The way he moved changed, too—his body sometimes stretched unnaturally as he walked, his steps too deliberate, too silent. Sometimes, if we looked too long, he seemed… wrong. His
joints bending at angles that didn’t quite make sense. His too-large eyes catching the light in a
way that made our stomachs twist.

Most days, he looked just like the little guy we brought home—normal, familiar. We wondered if our eyes were playing tricks on us, if the strange moments were just a product of our own exhaustion. Maybe it was just the mutual stress messing with our heads.

He never slept.

We didn’t realize this at first. We had the thought that maybe we just hadn’t caught him napping.
But then, night after night, we’d wake up to find him watching us. Silent. Still. Barely visible in
the dark—just a shadow with those massive eyes and towering ears. Sitting at the foot of the bed. A dark shape in the doorway, enormous eyes reflecting just enough to glow.

Maybe this wouldn’t startle the average cat owner, I mean we knew that cats had odd sleeping patterns. We kept reassuring ourselves. Cats can be nocturnal. They get zoomies, tear through the house, knock things over. But he never did.

There were no sounds. No pit-pattering of paws on the wood floors. No movement. Just the feeling of being watched—stalked, the creeping sensation dragging us awake, our skin pricking with unease. We’d turn over in bed, and there he’d be—statue-still, pupils wide, unblinking.

He kept playing his game, too, even when we weren’t playing. We’d catch him in the hallway as we worked at our desks, in the periphery as we moved from room to room—always shifting
forward when we weren’t looking. A flicker of movement at the edge of our vision. Closer.
Closer. Then gone. Just… gone.

It became unnerving. We were barely sleeping, leaving us wired, restless. Paranoia crept in. But he was just a cat. Right? Just a lil’ guy.

Then he stopped eating his food.

It began with him ignoring his food. Turning his nose up at his usual meals, his treats. But then
he started begging—not for scraps, not for kibble. For the raw meat we cooked with. Taco
nights, steak nights, chicken nights—he’d throw himself at our hands, desperate to snatch the flesh before it hit the pan.

We tried everything. Locked him out of the kitchen. Sprayed him with water. He’d sit there,
dripping, stunned, but as soon as we turned away, he’d lunge again.

Then one night, he succeeded. He won.

A raw steak slipped from my grasp, slapping against the tile. He pounced.

He didn’t chew. Didn’t savor. He devoured it, swallowing in thick, gulping motions, his throat
bulging unnaturally as he was choking it down.

We reached for him.

The hiss that followed wasn’t right. It wasn’t feline. It was deep, guttural. Almost… human.

His fur bristled, his spine arching in an impossible curve. The god awful sound of his wet slurps filled the room as he licked away. His pupils shrank to pinpricks. His body trembled and shifted. He crouched like a wild animal—not playfully. A predator’s crouch.

We stumbled back, disgusted—terrified. Looks shot between us for a moment, and in a blink—

Just like that—he was normal again. Small. Soft. Purring. He rubbed against our legs his tail curling happily. Grateful.

The steak was gone. Package and all… vanished. As if it had never been there at all.

That night, we made a decision.

We took him to the shelter the next morning.

It wasn’t an easy decision…but, we felt crazy. He could be so sweet, so loving. Belly rubs, chin bonks, soft purrs at our feet. But we couldn’t ignore what we’d seen. We couldn’t sleep, knowing he was watching. Waiting.

Two weeks passed. We started to actually miss him, but life was calm again. Back to normal.
We were sleeping. Eating. Relaxing without that unnerving feeling of being stalked. We felt safe
again.

Then, one night—

Meows.

Soft, familiar, beckoning from the hall. A pitiful little symphony—until it wasn’t.

They warped, stretched, and turned sour. One final, low vibration rumbled through the
dark—something deeper than any sound from a cat’s throat.

We shouldn’t have moved. But we did.

Reluctantly, we got up, our bodies heavy with hesitation, and walked to the bedroom door. 
We cracked it open just enough for—

Silence. Then, something shifted at the end of the hall. A shape, too large, too still. A thickened mass of shadow where there should’ve been nothing. Ear tufts curled sharply in the dark.

The eyes—enormous, liquid black dilated pupils—swallowed what little light remained, reflecting our panicked shadows.

Beneath them, the gleam of something wet, something sharp.

Claws. Longer. Thicker. Twitching with anticipation.

Waiting.

We understood our mistake.

He came back to play one last game of “red light, green light.”
