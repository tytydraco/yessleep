Tonight I hunt a new mark - a corrupt judge who has taken backhanders to send innocents to their dooms. As I trail him home through the fog-shrouded streets, my hand rests on the bone-hafted dagger at my belt. Beneath my cloak, the Soul Jar presses against my chest, humming with contained spirits and eagerly awaiting fresh essence.

The judge turns down an alley, puddles splashing underfoot. I quicken my stride and in one fluid motion, slip behind him and slit his throat. A gurgling rasp escapes his lips as his lifeblood spills onto the filthy cobblestones. I watch, transfixed, as a ghostly wisp rises from the wound and gets drawn into the waiting Soul Jar.

The jar's demonic energies surge as the new soul is consumed. I can feel its power intensifying, promising new dark gifts from the underworld in exchange for my fealty. With each soul, I barter for new unholy abilities - preternatural speed, unholy vitality, profane sorcery. All within my grasp, so long as I keep collecting.

As I gaze upon the judge's lifeless husk, I feel no pang of guilt or remorse. Only a sense of grim duty to my endless pact with the demon lords. They reside in the abyss, awaiting my steady tribute of souls to sate their hunger.

I secure the Soul Jar back beneath my cloak and make my way to the sanctuary where the trapped essences of past souls line the shelves in endless rows of jars. As I add the latest offering, I feel their tormented voices caressing my mind, begging for release from their eternal stasis.

But I cannot permit it. The demons would never allow their currency to slip away. My very existence depends on their infernal power, bought at the price of human souls. No matter how much I recoil at what I have become, there is no turning back.

As the tormented whispers fade, a deeper dread takes hold. My sanctum grows deathly cold and Silent. The shadows seem to culminate in the far corner, coalescing into a presence so malignant it stops my breath.

From the inky darkness, two pinprick crimson lights flare to life, swirling like the gates of hell itself. A low, guttural chuckle reverberates through the chamber, shaking the very jars on the shelves. I try to cry out but my voice is stolen by the demon's unspeakable power.

"Well, well..." a raspy voice like bone scraped against stone slithers from the shadows. "My little Soulkeeper grows weary of our arrangement."

A massive clawed hand reaches out and grips my throat, hauling me across the room. I am slammed against the wall, shelves clattering to the floor as their unholy cargo spills out. Hundreds of restless souls spew forth in a miasma of anguished spirits.

"You belong to us!" The voice is a bellowing roar that shakes my brain. "Your wretched existence is only permitted by our dark pact!"

I am hurled down onto the heaving cloud of souls, feeling them swirling around me, screaming in my ears, penetrating my mind. They claw at my flesh, desperate to be free of their injared stasis.

From the heart of the demon's inky form, a pair of baleful eyes like dying stars flare to life, boring straight through me. A fanged maw splits the shadows, venting forth a putrid reek of brimstone.

"You are ours, Soulkeeper!" It decrees. "We have allowed you to exist in the mortal realm, to do our bidding. But make no mistake - disobey us, and not only will your soul be forfeit, but we will unmake your very existence across all planes!"

The graveled voice echoes through the chamber like a death knell. I can feel the demon's grip on reality itself as it utters the words.

In that moment, I am reminded of just how small and insignificant I truly am compared to the beings I have sworn myself to. My mind races, searching for a way to placate this monstrous apparition of the abyss.

With trembling words, I vow to redouble my efforts to collect souls. The demon seems sated, for now. It slowly dissolves back into the shadows, leaving me lying there, shaken to my core and surrounded by the howling maelstrom of souls I have so callously harvested.

As the screams of the damned souls fade, I am left in silence once more, truly understanding the dread price of the path I have chosen. The Soulkeeper's work is never done...

I am the Soulkeeper. It is my curse to walk among mankind as a specter of death, forever trading in souls to exist another night.
