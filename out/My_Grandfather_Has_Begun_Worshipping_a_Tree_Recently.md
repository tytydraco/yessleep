I traveled here last week, a town so tiny and isolated that it no longer existed on most maps of India. I suspect that the government had forgotten its existence years ago. My parents sent me here to "look after" my grandfather. Apparently, they're looking for elderly homes for him, but I think they're just waiting for him to die off so they can sell the rundown houses in the village and be free of them. Being unemployed, I didn't have the nerve to turn down free boarding and lodging. But god, I already regret it. The village isn't just dying–it's fossilizing.

The roads are barely more than fading dirt trails, potholes eroding further with each monsoon season. The houses have been stripped down to skeletal brick, I’m unsure how some of them are still standing. Even the farmland, once the beating heart of agrarian India, has become barren. Their open fields sprawl like a beggar’s hands, dutifully waiting for alms of rain from the heavens. 

According to my Dad, it had once been a vibrant colony, long ago, before he departed and took off for Hyderabad all those years ago. Today? The few remaining folks here in this village look closer to death's door than life's. They likely barely make it on pension cheques and rationed rice grains. My granddad, Venkat, is no exception to the rule.

He's a living cadaver, a walking specter. The man hardly speaks anymore, I’m not sure if it’s due to a loss of ability or a loss of will. The man’s life was pitiful. It takes him an hour to chew through a meal, each bite sounded like punishment. He labored to clench and unclench his jaw for each bite, gasping and wheezing as it obstructed his throat. Rarely when he did get up did his joints creak and his lungs strain at the exertion. It was a scary sight to behold, his bony physique bringing to mind photographs of famine victims in our history books. He lies in bed all day, eyes shut, as if getting ready for death. 

Which is why I nearly dropped my phone this morning when he walked out the door. No warning, no words—only that skeletal frame stumbling into the white-hot glow of noon. I chased after him, crying "Thathayya!" in my mangled Telugu. He braked, cane trembling, and glared at me. And then he went on walking.

Half a mile below, we reached the forest edge. I still don’t know how he did it. The man who could barely stand for more than a minute had just power-walked a marathon. And why did he do this Olympic feat? A tree. A tree that was somehow even more lifeless than himself.

Alright, it was no ordinary tree. I could see that it must have bore religious significance of some sort, it had been wrapped in holy string, dipped in orange saffron. The tree trunk had yellowed and the dust coated it, but I could see some markings made in yellow, turmeric powder. Mystical symbols of sorts. Maybe desperate pleas for rain or unanswered prayers for food. 

He began to kneel before it, holding onto his cane for support as he descended. I moved forward to catch him immediately but he brushed my arms aside. He was a stubborn man, too stubborn for his own good. He did manage to get down on his knees in front of that husk of wood, though. He clasped his hands together, palms against palms in supplication, and began to chant.

I was actually a bit embarrassed, I didn't know what to do. After a minute or two, when it looked like this prayer wasn't going anywhere anytime soon, I decided to sit down some distance from the tree and just keep going on my phone. I don't know how long we sat there, me browsing on my phone and him praying by the tree, but it took forever.

When at last I heard his wheezing voice fade, I got up and went over to him.

I didn't even bother to try to help him to his feet, figuring the danger of being hit by him wasn't worth it. He did manage to stand, though very painfully. He then walked over to the tree itself and tied a new thread onto one of its lower branches. He motioned for me to come closer and gave me a thread to tie to the tree, as well. I was hesitant, but followed suit, even crossing my palms in front of me at the end, doing my best to mirror whatever this was. He smiled, I guess I did a decent job of mimicking. The silent return home was as difficult as the journey out, but my grandfather's mood was lighter, almost triumphant.

When we returned, he collapsed onto his bed with a sigh, his brief burst of energy spent. I retreated to my own cot in the corner of the little house, the thread still on my wrist. It stung gently, as if a rash, but I wore it out of some vague sense of obligation—or not wishing to offend whatever deity my grandfather had called upon. 

Night fell quickly, the village shrouded in a darkness so thick it felt alive. Heat clung to my body like a second skin, and rest was a distant dream. When I finally slept more than a few minutes, my mind was immediately plunged into dreamscapes. 

I stood in front of the tree again, its gnarled roots emitting a faint, yellow-green glow, throbbing like a heartbeat. The saffron filaments that wrapped its trunk had unraveled, coagulated like blood at the ground. The air was metallic, stinging, and I had leaden limbs, as if the ground itself was restraining me. That's when I saw her.

She stepped out from the shelter of the tree, her form smooth, serpentine.

Her lower half was a coil of rainbow-colored scales, glinting black, scraping soundlessly along the ground.

Her upper body was humam—or almost. Her arms were too long, fingers lengthening into bony claws. Her neck curved unnaturally, pushing her head forward. Her hair spread wide around her head, like a cobra's hood. But it was her face that froze me. Symmetrical to perfection, inhumanly beautiful, with dark, molten amber eyes that fixed on mine, unblinking. My body stiffened. I tried to scream, to run, but my lungs refused to draw breath. My muscles froze. 

She moved closer, her pace hypnotic, until her face was inches from mine. She smelled of earth and ash. Her mouth opened, revealing a line of human teeth accompanied by long fang-like canines, but no sound came out. Only a low, vibrating hum, resonating in my head. The threads on the tree began to squirm, curling towards me, encircling my ankle and wrists—constricting. Her clawed hand rose, raking across my wrist. It burned where she touched it, searing my skin. She looked at me, she looked inside me. Her golden eyes bore right through me, stripping away thoughts, memories, fear. I was exposed, hollowed out, as if she were sucking something from me. 

I awoke with a start, rays of sunlight slicing directly onto my face. I sat there for a minute trying to get my bearings, trying to distinguish reality from dream, truth from fantasy. I shrugged it off on the first day and just went back to wasting time on my computer. But nightmares returned for me the second night. And the third night.

Later, I talked to my grandfather and informed him of the odd visions.

He stared at me seriously, not saying a word back, lost in thought.

Suddenly, he stood up and grabbed my wrist. We walked silently as he led me to the tree. He gestured for me to pray along with him this time and I did. I did not know the words or all the gestures, yet I knelt down before the tree, doing my best to be respectful. After the prayers finished and we rose to our feet again, he walked over to the tree. He ripped off a small piece of cloth that had covered it. He wrapped it around his own wrist and then grasped my wrist and tied it on me, too. 

For some strange reason, that had done the job. The nightmares stopped. The days after the first dream were indistinct. Every day was the same, waking up and visiting the tree with my grandfather. The cloth around my wrist prickled continually, a dull, nagging tingle that I couldn't remove.

At first, I figured it was just the heat, the dust, the odd beats of country living. This was normal, I lied to myself, attempting to attribute it to foreign surroundings and practices. I made every effort to explain away what was transpiring around me. And then the snakes crept in. It started with a sound in the underbrush when I walked up to the well. I froze, my skin crawling, as a cobra glided over the path, its hood open, its eyes on me. 

It didn't strike. It didn't even hiss. It just looked at me, its eyes strangely human, then disappeared into the high grass. I comforted myself that it was a coincidence, a fluke, an oddity, a quirk of the country. But the next day, I saw another—one curled up in the shade of our doorway, its scales glinting in the sun like oil. My grandfather walked over it with no more regard than to a stray cat. 

The villagers, however, reacted differently. They inclined their heads, moving past the snakes, whispering prayers. Some left offerings—milk, flowers, even coins—at the base of the tree where my grandfather prayed. When I asked an elderly woman why, she simply said, "They are her children," as though that made any sense. 

The dreams also returned, although not with such clarity as the first. Blasts of the serpent-woman's face burned in my brain when I slept—her eyes, golden and bright, her long fingers, her voice humming through my head with no words.

I rose each morning more drained than the last, as though the dreams were sucking something out of me.

My grandfather, however, grew stronger by the day. He needed his cane no more. His voice, which was a rasp, grew strong and deep. He even began eating greedily, devouring meals that would have taken him hours to eat only weeks before. I struggled to force away the discomfort bubbling within me. But the thread around my wrist grew tighter, the fibers sinking deeper into my skin like tiny needles. 

One night, after another sleepless night, I hit my limit. I unwound the tightly knotted thread from around my wrist with effort and discarded it. The release was immediate, as if shedding something I hadn't realized I'd been carrying. I fell onto my cot, exhausted but exhilarated. 

That night, the dream came in full force. I stood before the tree again, its roots colorless with a gentle radiance, the scent of damp earth and decay hanging in the air. The serpent-woman emerged from the shadows, her scales shining like melted metal. She did not come toward me this time. She simply stood there, her amber eyes burning with rage and sorrow. The threads at the tree squirmed, slithering toward me, but stopped, as if held back by an invisible force.

Then the ground beneath me shifted. I looked down to see a pit open before my feet, its bottom teeming with writhing, hissing shapes. Snakes–dozens of them, their eyes aglow like hot coals. They began to climb, their chill bodies writhing over my legs, my torso, my arms. I screamed, but nothing came out. The serpent-woman remained still as the snakes wound themselves closer, their fangs scraping along my flesh.

I woke up covered in sweat, my heart racing. The string was on the ground where I had dropped it, its threads frayed but still whole. My grandfather stood in the doorway, his face emotionless. Without saying a word, he picked up the string and handed it to me. His eyes looked into mine, and for the first time, I saw something akin to fear in them.

I tied the string back on.

The next few days were a haze. My grandfather's change just kept on coming, his body becoming almost spry again, his laughter echoing through the house. The villagers started treating him with a respect that was almost worship-like, taking him gifts and seeking his blessings. He accepted it all with a quiet dignity, as if it were rightfully his.

I, however, was shrinking quickly. My hands shook unceasingly. My eyesight was blurry around the edges. Even menial tasks—carrying water, chopping vegetables—left me gasping. The string around my wrist seemed to radiate a sickly, feeble light, its strands now so deeply inserted into my skin that I couldn't be taken out of it without ripping flesh.

The snakes were everywhere, unavoidable. They slithered down the village streets, coiled around doorways, even draped over the branches of the tree. The villagers welcomed them, leaving bowls of milk and honey in their path. I attempted to avoid them, but they always seemed to find me, their eyes locking onto mine with a seeming familiarity that made me shiver.

One night, as we ate dinner together, my grandfather spoke to me. "We must go to the tree tomorrow," he said, his voice clear. "It is time."

I didn't ask him what he meant. He was a devout man on the edge of dementia, I didn't think I could possibly understand.

The next day, we walked to the tree silently. The air was heavy with floral scents but I saw no flowers in the rotting forest around me. My grandfather knelt before the tree, his chant deeper and stronger than the previous time. I knelt beside him, my body trembling from exhaustion.

During a crescendo in the chant, the ground began to rumble under our feet.

A low hiss hung in the air, and a cobra slithered out of the roots, its hood flared, its eyes locked onto my grandfather.

He didn't blink as it slithered up his frame and wrapped itself around his neck, settling like a rosary around him.

He glanced at me once, his eyes full of a horrible gratitude, and nodded. He stood up slowly and went away, into the darkness of the forest. I was unable to scream, unable to shift, as paralysis had caught me. 

Hours later, when it released me, I found the tree transformed: resin oozed from its bark, green shoots bursting from dead wood. My grandfather's cane coiled around a root; the wood was smooth, young. It had some new carvings on it.

They were in Telugu so it took me a while to understand. 

It had only one word–my name.
