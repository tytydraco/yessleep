Dear Nicola,

The people who watch me may not allow this letter to be sent to you. 

If it does get to you, please share it with as many people as you can since I am not capable of doing so within these walls. 

I hope someone will feel a little less alone concerning their supernatural experiences when they read about mine.

I was in a crowded bar in midtown where the roar of an intoxicated crowd reached the TV monitors which played a sports broadcast. 

The volume of the mob was all one could hear and their enthusiastic demands for a better performance out of the athletes disgusted me. These slovenly alcoholics criticized people who worked out for a living because their parlay bet was at risk as if they somehow knew the true winning strategy on the field.

This judgment towards the gatherers was not out of me perceiving myself as morally superior but more of a personal intolerance towards behavior I used to indulge in when I drank. 

On that cold September night, I was not ordering whiskey despite how much I yearned to. 

I gave up the bottle years beforehand. 

I was only getting some late-night food since dining options at ten PM were scarce in my small town and this dive was the only establishment open.

I sat alone in a dusty booth near the back by an unused pool table and silently waited on my to-go order. I could not get out of there fast enough to eat in peace at home. 

The waitress brought a plastic-wrapped styrofoam container to me. Although her hair was a different color (a bright green) since the last time I saw her a year previous, I did recognize her and hoped she would not remember me.

“Did you already pay for this at the front?” 

I nodded.

“Wait a minute…Brent. I haven’t seen you in a long time. How have things been?”

I wanted to tell the truth but kept it inside.

The server’s name was Vanessa and she was my girlfriend Connie’s friend.

That was before Connie passed away in a swimming incident. The two were never that close but easily could have been if Vanessa lived longer.

I had to get out of there.

“I’m good,” I said. 

I tried to make small talk by shifting the subject to her, inquiring how long she had worked there and if she liked it or not. Meaningless banter has never been my strong suit and the inevitable awkwardness which manifested itself in every syllable was undeniable evidence of this.

I wished her a good night and left for the parking lot. The familiar pungency of dried-out spilled beer stained the mats beneath my sneakers as I made my exit into the frigid air.

I got into the driver's seat of my vehicle.

My phone alerted me to a text. 

It was a missed call from Garrick. 

I had known the man for over half a decade and we worked together on various construction sites in the Pacific Northwest when I ended up in a tough place due to being unable to pass a drug test and as a result, had to take manual labor jobs.

He had become my best friend in recent memory despite our overt differences. 

We were both in recovery but I did not have a criminal record whereas he had served time in his past for doing dumb things as a young man. He robbed a few convenience stores and got away with the first three. The fourth proved to be unlucky for him once his tires were spiked and he got hit with a bean bag gun and cuffed. The judge did not have any mercy on him in court.

I dialed him back. 

“Hey. What’s going on?”

“Brent…I’m…I’m…”

I wanted to say the word dehydrated because that is how he sounded. I waited patiently for him to finish.

“…in the hospital.”

“What? Are you okay? How did you end up there? Please don’t tell me it was a bar fight.”

“I…fell from a tree. I was a little high off the grass and I tried to stargaze. It didn’t work out in my favor. I fell, man. I fell hard.”

“Hell. Want me to bring you some food?”

“No. It’s after visiting hours anyway. I wanted to let you know that you’re my emergency contact if one of the doctors accidentally kills me while I’m here.”

“That’s not going to happen,” I said. 

“I might need a ride in the morning when they discharge me.”

“I’m good for it. Let me know and I’ll be there even if I have to leave the office in the morning.”

I had landed a mind-numbing but easy administrative desk job for a plumbing company where I handled their files and did the inventory the big bosses did not want to do. The pay was garbage and the paperwork was tedious but it beat lifting steel in the snow for eight to ten hours. 

“Thank you and take care of yourself,” Garrick said before he hung up.

I drove back home and turned on some late-night radio to keep me company and get my mind off of my worries about my friend. 

I was in a fifty-five-mile-per-hour lane. Due to the ice on the road, I went at a much lower speed than that because there was no one at risk of rear-ending me. The lane was empty. 

This particular road did not even have visible houses on either side. There was nothing but wilderness.

A man dressed in black walked in front of me. 

He came into my view quickly. He did it without any recognition of my bright headlights by failing to even glance at me. He seemed to cross the street with a stoic stare forward, oblivious to my luminescence and the sound of my tires as the rubber burnt once I braked hard and felt my forehead bang against the compartment. 

The car slid.

I waited to feel a thump on the front hood. 

That did not transpire but the man was sucked underneath with the same velocity as a violent undertow taking a drowning victim out to sea.

I honked my horn but it seemed too late.

I cursed, put it in the park, turned on my hazard lights, and hopped out.

I got on my knees on the wet and frozen gravel to search beneath the vehicle. 

No one and nothing was there. 

I went into my trunk and retrieved a high-lumen flashlight. I shone it behind me, looking for an unconscious man or even an animal in case my eyes had lied to me during a time of high stress. This was something that had occurred before.

Nothing was there.

I got back in and pulled off to the side. I took in a few deep exhalations and tried to get my heart rate down.

I looked in the mirrors. 

Nothing was there. 

Could this have been a hallucination born from stress? Although I had gone through that in the past it was not something I had experienced in a while.

I decided to go home. I drove further down the road.

I looked into the rearview mirror and there was a man in black chasing after me. 

*

A combination of terror and adrenaline flooded my body. 

I stopped once more and got out. 

I yelled out something to let him know I acknowledged him and the nightmarish incident as a whole. 

His ability to sprint at least verified that he was not crippled which provided some cold comfort but I was still concerned for his well-being. 

I knew I was sober. I was willing to take a breathalyzer test and fill out an incident report. It was a horrible accident but I knew I could explain myself to the authorities if it came to that.

I ran towards the man. I shone my flashlight on his black silhouette.

“I need to make sure you’re alright,” I said. 

My voice could not hide how defeated I likely was as it echoed into the tree limbs. 

He evaporated once the beam of light went in his direction. 

His mouth was agape in the shadows before he vanished.

*

I yearned for what had become my normal routine. The office of the plumbing company I worked for was in a three-story building. 

The stairs were rickety and coated with chunks of frost despite how they had been salted with ice melt. 

The hallway I followed to get to my place of work was lined with other studios which were used by other outside companies as everything from yoga studios to call centers. 

I had a set of master keys signed out from an electronic key cabinet in the main foyer of the first level. 

Once I got my cubicle I sat down and fired up the old and dusty work computer built in the 1980’s.

I looked out the window. The view was of a private community across the street which had a thin layer of chromatic fog hung over it and the highway. 

The events of last night still had not fully settled. 

I coped with it by telling myself he could have been a crazy person whose body type betrayed how good his agility was. They did not have any blood or wounds I could make out, so that told me I had not hurt them. 

Perhaps the person was a wandering drunk, I reasoned. People who imbibe do gain a certain physical flexibility which can help them survive high trauma incidents on occasion. Friends of mine who were EMTs had verified this to me in the stories they told of their time in the field.

I shook my head and got back to work. 

Something moved in my left periphery.

I looked down at the sidewalk by the main road and there was the same jaywalker who had followed me the night before. My legs grew weak and my chest tightened.

He stared right at me with his hands out front as he advanced toward the building. 

Even though the property was private the front door was often unlocked so workers could come and go on their lunch breaks. I never lamented this fact more.

I stood and swung open the doorway and made my way out into the narrow vestibule where I almost tripped over a crumpled carpet. 

I went outside into the coolness. It was empty and I grew faint. The only noise was the sound of cars driving by and the sounds of a glass door swinging open and shut from a convenience store a few hundred feet away. I snapped my head in the direction to verify it was not my follower. It was the clerk with a case of liquor under his arm.

I went back to my cubicle and looked up the nonemergency number for the local police department and I was in disbelief at doing it. A person with my background did not go out of his way to contact anyone in blue but I had no other choice.

A woman answered and gave the designation of her department. The voice sounded somehow familiar to me in an unpleasant way.

“I think I’m being stalked,” I said. 

I did not tell the full truth about the possible impact the night before on the road since I did not want to incriminate myself.

I sensed she could tell there were omissions in my narrative.

“Has he physically harmed you and do you know if he has any weapons?”

“No, and I do not.”

“Do you have a history with this individual? Have you lived with him or interacted with him before last night?”

“No.” 

“Sir, if he hasn’t attacked you and you don’t know his name and you’re not even confident about the direction he took flight in then there’s nothing we can do. If you see him again you are free to call us and give us his description. Don’t engage and wait for a uniform if you dial this number again.”

Some help.

*

Garrick called me. I left work early and picked him up under the port cochere of the hospital’s front entranceway. 

He walked with a limp but seemed otherwise fine.

“Thanks for doing this man,” he said as he got into the passenger seat.

I drove him home. Halfway there I decided to tell him the tale in complete detail.

I looked over and he stared at me as though I had said gravity did not exist and Dumbo was real.

“Are you out of your mind? Guys like you and me don’t talk to investigators. They’ll run your background and look for ways to take you in. Are you okay? If you need help I know a therapist. Sometimes there’s no shame in having people help you with your head when you start to lose it.”

*

I went to my apartment after I dropped Garrick off at his house. 

When I entered my place I wanted nothing more than to lay down and fade away. 

The authorities could do nothing for me and even my best friend was convinced I was having a mental episode. 

A sense of loneliness overcame me. I had not gone through such isolation in a while. A drink was tempting but I pushed it out with the awareness of where imbibing would lead me.

I could not blame the cops or Garrick. If the two incidents had not been so real I would have questioned my sanity as well. Yet they were as tangible as anything I had been through.

I stared at the ceiling before I fell asleep. 

I awoke to the sounds of thunder.

I hopped out of bed for a glass of water and filled my Brita filter. I gazed through the blinds.

The jaywalker stood on the sidewalk below and was as still as a concrete slab. 

The rain fell through his body and the dampness did not drench him at all. There was a light mist which emanated from his torso and it almost steamed up the glass of my kitchen’s casement despite the distance between us. The neon sign of a Chinese restaurant across the street pierced directly through him as though he were transparent. 

I took out my phone and took a picture.

He yelled at me and even through the noise of the precipitation I could hear the sound of his stressed scream, akin to a man murdered in a narrow and hollow tunnel.

I checked my camera roll. 

The picture was distorted and captured nothing but a flooded walkway. 

*

I went to a supermarket later that night. 

The store was busier than I could have reasoned considering the odd hour. I walked into the electronics section comprised of three aisles. 

Everything was locked and I was afraid for a moment that I would have to wait until morning when the supervisor of that area came in. 

I was able to get a manager on overtime to open up a cabinet for me so I could purchase a home surveillance system. 

I went home and used a power drill to mount the first camera. I activated the system on an app while I stood in the hallway and brushed aside some of the dust on the flooring. 

The livestream came in with a 4K visual clarity and a small percentage of my worries ceased. It contained motion sensors so if anyone approached it I would get an alert. This did provide me with some comfort even if it would be short-lived.

My phone rang.

I answered. It was Garrick.

“Are you hurt again or in jail?”

“Not funny,” Garrick said. 

“Not out of the realm of possibility either. What do you want?”

“Nice to see you too. I wanted to say I’m sorry.”

“For what?”

“For implying you’re going crazy. Or more than usual, anyway. I’ve had my episodes.”

“Like what?”

“When I grew up on a farm in Nebraska I saw some things out on the prairie I can’t explain to this day. A man I thought was a sharecropper always walked the Sandhills. He had one eye. He never talked to me even when we crossed paths during my strolls and I tried to get his attention more than once. Something seemed different about him.”

“You saw a weird guy one time,” I said. “This one keeps returning.”

“Let me finish my story. One time I went to a psychic because I was on a date with a woman in New Orleans and she insisted it would be fun. The fortune teller told me that a man with one eye was following me, looking over me like a guardian angel. I found out through an Aunt that one of my Uncles lost his eye during a knife-throwing incident when he was a teenager. He died of heart complications when I was five years old.”

“So you think I’m seeing spirits?”

“I don’t know,” he said as he took a sip of something and I hoped it was not liquor. “All I’m aware of is how we human beings don’t understand even a quarter of what we pretend to. Thanks for the ride the other day and if you ever need help with anything let me know.”

Garrick hung up. 

Someone banged the handle of what I presumed to be a broomstick or walking cane on the floor above me and I took it as a plea for the power tools to cease. 

I went inside and locked the door. 

I heard footsteps.

I stared through the peephole and found nothing but the silver and fake gold-trimmed room placard across the way.

Someone knocked.

I backed away a few steps and brought up the CCTV stream on my phone again.

The jaywalker stood there. 

His clothes were shredded, his aura gray, his body upright with an almost overly straight posture, his hands balled up and his angry demeanor unhidden. 

The floral carpeting beneath him was visible through his vitreous shape.

He moved away and into a nearby stairwell.

I rewound and hit replay on my phone.

At first, it showed nothing but a dimly lit and empty passageway. The footage grew scrambled after a few seconds.

*

High anxiety gripped me, the likes of which I had not been through since the first time I entered the courtroom on the wrong side of the law years beforehand. 

I must have watched the crystal-clear surveillance footage ten times and it was the same result. Nothing was there but a glitchy and fuzz-strewn screen. 

A part of me wanted to return the item but I also knew that it was not a technological failure. This was a deliberate interference from the unknown realm, the inevitable destination for all of us that none can truly understand until we get there. 

I paced for a few seconds as I considered what to do next.

He had not entered my apartment yet. Nor had he accessed the office I toiled at for eight hours a day. 

It was as though he required permission to intrude on someone’s boundaries. 

I could get some sleep, I reasoned.

Or I could confront him.

I have never been one to take the easier route. Even as a child, I would find resolutions to problems differently than everyone else. Call it neurodivergence, recklessness, or something worse. 

I exited my apartment and went down the stairwell after I slipped on my jacket. 

*

I saw him at the corner between a closed tattoo parlor and a foreclosed laundry mat where a streetlight flickered.

I waved my arms to get his attention. He stopped as though he wanted to head my way and for the first time, I did not feel threatened. 

Strangely I considered how maybe he needed the help I was unable to give him on the night of the incident, yet the only way to figure that out was to communicate with him so I sprinted over the dampened pavement. 

I came within five feet of him before he turned his back on me and entered a spot towards that row of shops where I lost sight of him. I cursed under my breath. 

The absurdity of the situation made me want to laugh but I did my best to keep my senses together. I ran in the direction I had last seen him.

I heard the bells on a door jingle and I presumed he entered one of the businesses in the long stretch of them on that avenue. 

I peered into a pawn shop but the door was secure and no one was there. An Italian restaurant was exactly the same way. A cafe yielded the same results. Nothing but darkness and chairs placed on top of newly cleaned tables.

I stood in front of a clothing store. Mannequins gazed at me in suits and summer dresses. 

The jaywalker stared at me in between them with his arms around their shoulders as though he was at a family reunion or meeting with old friends. For a second I would have sworn I saw a smile. He was amused by his mischievousness and this infuriated me. 

I smashed the glass and made my way inside. 

My fists were bleeding but they did not hurt because of the adrenaline and determination coursing through me. Now was the time to confront and tell him to either leave me alone or let me right my wrongs.

*

Total blackness surrounded me and the oxygen seemed thinner as though I had gone up in altitude. All was quiet except for the sounds of the soles of my shoes hitting the carpet and crunching the bits of the shattered window beneath me. I saw the thing I was pursuing move into a back room and I followed until did a full circle and saw how everything was blanketed in nightfall. It was as though I was down a deep well. 

“You are the biggest fool I have ever met,” a voice said. It was old and hoary, potentially stained by decades of cigarette smoke, whiskey, and yelling out of bitterness and it made me think it could very well resemble how I might sound if I lived long enough.

“I apologize if I hit you that night,” I said. “It was an accident. You appear to be moving around fine. If you want a settlement or insurance details we can work this out.”

A laugh cascaded around me. 

He appeared. His face had lacerations I had not noticed before. The wounds were so prevalent that it was thought someone had taken a knife’s edge around his mouth. 

“You idiot,” he said. “I died because of you. Your whole life has been one fatal accident after the other. Your friend Garrick took some charges and did not get you in trouble when he easily could have. You try to repay him but you know you will never be able to after the price he paid for you. He pretends to not resent you when he does. Let’s also not forget about Connie.”

My head spun as he said those words before he continued:

“You should have been paying attention but you were too busy getting hammered on the beach that day. If it weren’t for your neglect she would still be alive. You won’t take any responsibility for your decisions until you’re at the black gates of hell, the barriers wrapped in black roses.”

Something overcame me. It was the same emotion that drove all of my worst decision-making in my youth.

Unbridled rage.

I swung at him. 

My arm went right through him and hit a shelf full of shirt hangers. They clattered and toppled. I drew back to futilely try to strike again.

“Get on the ground and put your arms behind your back,” a commanding voice shouted.

I turned and saw a police officer stand ten feet apart from me with his gun drawn.

I complied with the orders and the cold steel bracelets were placed on my wrist.

“I know this looks like a breaking and entering,” I said as the cop shoved me toward his cruiser with its lights flashing. “I can explain…”

As I said the words I realized I could not truly, or at least not rationally in a way any self-respecting investigator would believe. 

“Your trespassing and forceful entry into a business is the least of your worries,” the cop said when I was seated in the back of his patrol vehicle and he already ran my name.

“What do you mean?”

“You have a warrant. You’re wanted for a hit-and-run vehicular homicide three nights ago. Everything was captured by a cell phone from another driver. Based on how you drove away I also believe you were intoxicated.”

Dear Nicola,

I sit in this cell with the full awareness that I am never getting out. This is a style of living I have dealt with before. While I will never get used to the complete lack of dignity, I like knowing that you support me, although I know it can’t be for forever. Share my tale. I want to let everyone know that we should let the dead rest peacefully and not try to disturb them even when we see them as a nuisance. It is never worth our limited time to compromise our freedom to appease their anger.
