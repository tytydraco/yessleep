I’ve not seen my grandma since 2009. She had a catastrophic argument with my dad, but he used to be elusive about what actually transpired between them. Grandma moved away a few months later – I only know that because I remember cycling past her house and seeing it for sale. I was always certain she told my dad her new address, but he always refused my requests to visit her.

Once, I did a little detective work and opened a letter addressed to my dad. I recognised Grandma’s handwriting from birthday cards I’d received over the years. Dad scolded me for rummaging through his post, of course. He got all of his mail delivered to a separate PO box after that – stopping me from intercepting any more letters.

*Dear John,*

*Please forgive me.*

*Mum*

*xx*

That was all it said. Unfortunately, there was no return address.

Anyway, when my mum died in 2018, grieving became our sole focus. I stopped asking about my grandma. I didn’t even really think about her for a long time. Just my mum. She’d been struggling with her mental health for a years, and she was missing for a few months before they found her body. I don’t really want to talk anymore about that – I just thought I’d give some context before carrying on.

It's been a painful few years. I haven’t asked Dad about Grandma since I was a teenager. And I’m 24 now. To be honest, I decided a while ago that I was happy to move on with my life. It felt a little like the ship might have sailed. Dad’s the only family I have left. I didn’t want to irreparably ruin our relationship by persistently badgering him about his mother.

But last night, something unexpected happened.

“Cara?” Dad shouted from the living room. “Come in here. Sit down with me for a minute.”

Gulping, I tentatively entered the room and chose an armchair opposite the sofa on which he was slouched. I was panicking because I thought it might be time for a talk about me still living at home. I finished uni a couple of years ago, and I’ve got a job in sales, but it doesn’t pay nearly well enough for me to move out.

“You okay, Dad?” I asked.

He sighed. “Yeah, I’m fine. But I’ve been thinking lately...”

“Uh oh,” I teased, hoping a classic Dad Joke might relieve some tension.

It didn’t.

“You’ve not asked me about Grandma for years,” He said after a long pause.

I was flabbergasted. Dad has never been the one to bring up my grandma. Not since their unexplained estrangement. So, I hardly knew how to respond. After several awkward seconds, I realised that I was simply sitting there, mouth agape, staring silently. My father adjusted his reading glasses, which were perched precariously atop his seemingly-clammy nose and forever slipping down. I started to wonder why he looked so sweaty and anxious.

*Could this finally be it?* I wondered.

“I’m coming to terms with things. For instance, you’re not my baby girl anymore. You're old enough to go out and make your own decisions,” He said. “And I often find myself wondering whether you still want to see your grandma.”

I shrugged. “I stopped asking about her because I could see how much it upset you.”

Dad smiled weakly. “I know. We’ve been through… a lot. But what I’m saying is that I’m aware of your age. You’re an adult now. I just… I worry sometimes that she might try and contact you. Maybe she already has.”

I shook my head. “She hasn't.”

Dad seemed to ease up a little at hearing that. “Good. That’s good. But I realise that, if I really want to keep you safe, I… I have to tell you *why* you shouldn’t see your grandma if she contacts you.”

I nodded. “It would help to know why you two fell out.”

Suddenly, it was Dad’s turn to gulp. He shifted his body weight in his seat, stalling for time. I found my eyes wandering to the night sky outside our living room window. Torrential rain pummelled the tarmac of our sleepy road, and a solitary lamppost was scarcely visible through the cascading curtain of droplets on the glass.

“Your grandma and grandad always had a strained relationship,” Dad eventually started. “That’s why I have so many issues, I think. I just hope none of that rubbed off on you. My mum and dad were always good to me, but they weren’t good to each other. And they seemed oblivious to the effect that had on me as a child.”

I nodded gently. I could remember grandma and grandad bickering throughout my early childhood. And then, one day, my grandad left her.

“I always thought Mum was a bit too harsh on Dad for his long business trips. He was just trying to provide for us. But when he left her, I obviously empathised and took her side. So, I don’t want you thinking of me as the bad guy,” Dad said.

I shook my head. “Never.”

“I’m dancing around the subject. You only have one question, I imagine,” Dad said. “What changed?”

“Dad, you don’t have to tell–” I started.

“– I do,” He interrupted. “If you stop me now, I might never summon the courage again. Okay. I found something shortly after your grandad left, Cara. I was clearing out your grandma’s attic, and there was a cardboard box labelled ‘The Catalogue’. It was… It was full of photos. Photos of missing people, I later learned. And every person’s story was the same. These candid photographs were taken from a distance. In parks and busy shopping centres. Men and women. That wasn’t what scared me. It was... the photographs taken in the attic. Unimaginable brutality. I can’t… I can’t say any more than that.”

Quaking at a revelation I never expected to leave my father’s lips, I sat in silence, processing the horrifying information. My mental cogs were turning, but I hadn’t yet realised what I was still repressing.

“Anyway… When I confronted your grandma about it, she burst into tears,” Dad croaked. “She said it was the reason Grandad left. He discovered her secret. Obviously, I told her that I was going straight to the police, and she just... said she understood. She didn’t try to stop me. But she fled that very night. Fourteen years later, there’s still no sign of her. I just hope, wherever she went, she stopped... taking people.”

And that was it. My dad’s terrible story. I couldn’t find any suitable words, so I stopped searching for any. We both sat for a prolonged period of silence, watching the rain continue to beat down on the world outside. A world which suddenly looked a little darker to me.

Eventually, I went to bed, but I didn’t sleep. I *couldn’t* sleep. My head was whirring, but not for the reasons one might expect. You see, Dad’s story didn’t fully add up.

I’d remembered something.

I used to stay at my grandparents’ house from time to time, and they’d often let me bring a friend or two – given I was an only child, and they “didn’t want me to endure a boring sleepover with two oldies.”

They knew who I’d invite. It was always the same two girls. Sophie and Francesca. In fact, they often insisted on me inviting my best friends. And my friends loved my grandparents. Well, mainly, they loved the sweets Grandma and Grandad would give us before bed. Plying us with succulent, sugary goodness that should have kept us awake all night – and yet, we always slept like babies.

Well, not *every* time.

One night, when I was around 6 or 7 years old, I awoke in the early hours of the morning. It was still dark outside. I felt unbelievably groggy – as if someone had wrapped an elastic band around my brain and restricted the blood flow. But, after a few seconds, I became aware of my surroundings and noticed that, whilst Francesca was fast asleep, Sophie’s sleeping bag was empty. And the door to my bedroom – Dad’s old room – was wide open.

I eyeballed the pitch-black upstairs landing through the doorway. My eyesight was hazy, and I’m sure I wouldn't have been able to see a thing anyway, but my ears, on the other hand, were working perfectly. That must’ve been what woke me up. The sound of creaking floorboards above my head – from the attic.

My immediate thought was that Sophie was messing around up there, and I worried that I was about to be in big trouble with my grandparents. So, I gingerly rose to my feet – almost passing out as I did – and tiptoed quietly out of my bedroom, trying to navigate the blackened landing. I didn’t want to turn on any lights and wake Grandma or Grandad. But the creaking attic floorboards persisted, along with a muffled voice, and I knew it was only a matter of time before my grandparents woke up anyway.

“*Sophie*!” I hissed, hoping she would hear and my grandparents wouldn't.

The abnormally-loud creaking immediately subsided, and I held my breath as I finally accepted something.

*Those can’t be Sophie’s footsteps*.

I hurriedly crept back to bed as the floorboards, like wooden piano keys, creaked hurriedly across the length of the ceiling. I managed to slide under my duvet cover and close my eyes as the attic door opened with a giant groaning noise. It was followed by someone very heavily clambering down the ladder.

I remember striving feverishly to feign that I was asleep as the unknown figure lumbered across the landing. I squeezed my eyes shut, trying not to cry as I listened to the strained breathing of the figure who had stopped in the doorway – the figure who was clearly watching me. I didn’t need to open my eyes to know that. It wasn’t Sophie. *It was the Bogeyman*. That was what I told myself.

The monster padded clumsily into the room, dropped something heavy on the floor, and then walked over to my bed. I still remember that stale, unclean breath on my face. I was trembling beneath the duvet, but I held my nerve and prayed the creature wouldn’t eat me. And, eventually, it slowly backed out of the room, closing the bedroom door.

I remember, when I was eventually certain the monster had left, opening my eyes to see Sophie lying atop her sleeping bag, still passed out. She must’ve been unaware of what happened to her in the attic. I sure hope so.

I know now, of course, what I was too young to know then. There was something wrong with those sweets. Just like there was something wrong with Grandma and Grandad insisting on me inviting Sophie and Francesca.

But I also remember something else. Something that unravels part of my dad’s story.

It wasn’t *both* grandparents who invited my friends and gave us sweets.

It was Grandad.

**EDIT:** How do I tell my dad? I can’t just leave things like this.
