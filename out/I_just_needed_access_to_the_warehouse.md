When I was in high school, this town was nothing more than dirt and rocks. The medical offices were the only game in town. Nowadays, it’s the birthplace and graveyard of warehouses. Where tumbleweeds once rode the wind freely, now they get caught on chain-link fences.

I hate what they did to my home.

Funny. All of a sudden, I’m calling it home. I’m lying to myself. I live on an abandoned military base, cursed by more than nuclear fallout. If I want midnight snacks, I’m gonna have to get a legit place. No more squatting.

That’s what I’m thinking as I step into a giant warehouse.

The gig itself is legit. I needed access, so I called the temp agencies they work with, got my forklift certificate, and boom, I had a reason to be here.

My real job? Report back to an OSHA agent about any violations. That’s where my real skills kick in, watching which rules the company pretends to enforce, and which ones they ignore.

Years of breaking into offices and snapping pictures of financial docs gave me a good idea of how these places run.

It’s a simple job, basically above board, and most importantly, no demons involved. I’m helping people. At least, that’s the lie I tell myself.

I don’t really care about everyone’s safety. They’re adults. They know right from wrong. They also know that crossing the line gets you a pink slip. Something I don’t have to worry about. If I get caught, I just play dumb.

The warehouse I’m in is in my hometown. It’s a small, upstart operation supplying local shops with dry goods. The problem? The shops are getting moldy products. The shelf life on this stuff is supposed to be at least three years.

I just need proof of mold, evidence it’s being documented, and proof it’s being ignored.

This is gonna be fun.

Like any other warehouse job, I go check out the forklift I’ll be operating. I pretend to go over the safety checklist. Really, I’m watching everyone else. All of them getting on faulty equipment. I can tell the problem with each one just by how the driver starts it.

When everyone’s gone, I actually look at my checklist and see the last time anyone filled in the form was two years ago. I inspect my lift and head to the dry goods section of the warehouse.

The production floor is pretty boring. Everyone seems to be following health measures, wearing their hair nets, gloves, masks, the whole deal. I pretend to start pulling down a pallet of rice. Shelf life is two years. I check a few more pallets and confirm they’re all good.

I head to the spices and herbs section next. On the way, I notice a pallet of candles in the disposition area. Some of them are broken, shattered, or cracked. A few are burnt. That’s totally not suspicious or anything. I’ll have to swing back and look into that.

As soon as I turn down the aisle with the spices, I see loose leaves and powders everywhere. Not only that. There is rat droppings. I take out my phone and snap a couple shots.

I head deeper into the aisle and notice the numbers are wrong. One or two boxes are missing. Easy to miss if you didn’t have access to the inventory records. I double-check and notice the sage and cloves are off by two boxes each.

On further inspection, someone’s drawn something on the remaining boxes. A circle made of lines. I snap a few photos of the boxes and the paperwork showing the numbers don’t add up.

At the other end of the aisle are the canned goods. I make my way down, and my nostrils get assaulted by the worst scent I’ve ever smelled. There are cans of vegetables busted open, turning gray, shining from a film of slime. It takes everything I have not to throw up. I take pictures quick and leave.

When I think I’m safely away, I inhale deep breaths of air. Fuck this place. That was disgusting. Time to get some fresh air.

I’m on the roof of the building. The breeze is nice. The desert always looks different from above. That’s one of the cool things about this town, and thats the hill. That perspective is priceless.

Focus on the mission though. I can’t get into the office through the doors. Those need key cards. Instead, I’ll use the roof access. There are two entry points. One above the warehouse and one that leads to the server rooms.

The server room needs to be cooled at all times. So, logically, they made sure HVAC has access to the roof as well. That access is only secured by a deadbolt. Easy enough. I’ll make short work of that and walk right into the office, grab the HR files, and game over.

If companies knew how easy it is to break into secure files, they’d never trust temp agencies. I should really be thanking my mother. As I pick the lock on the deadbolt, my mind wanders to when I was younger.

My mom used to think people were coming into our house at night. So, naturally, when you think someone is breaking in, you set booby traps. At least, that’s what came naturally to my mother.

I used to help her set up those traps. Little did I know, I was absorbing information. Weak spots in security. How someone can sneak in through a window, pick the lock to the front door. How to set up distractions from the real trap. My mother unknowingly taught me both sides.

Hard not to laugh that those skills are finally coming in handy.

I walk slowly, scanning the entire area for anything that looks like complaint files. A folder, a stack of paper, something.

I walk over to a desk with a green folder on it labeled “Disposition.” I shrug and open it up. I flip through the papers and see “spontaneous mold,” and snag that report. Right behind it is a report on “used candles.” I take that one too.

As I slip the reports into my clipboard, the lights come on.

I freeze and set the green folder down. I slowly move toward the back of the office. I hear a voice over a walkie-talkie. I bump a desk with my knee and knock over a phone.

“Who’s there!?” a voice calls out from the other room.

I step into view, hands at waist level. “I got lost looking for the bathroom.”

The security officer looks at me hard. “How’d you end up in here?” he says, tone thick with suspicion.

“There was an open door and I just walked in. It’s my first day. I don’t wanna get in trouble. I need this job. My mom just died and I need to pay rent next week and still pay for her burial.” That just flowed right out.

The security guard nods toward the exit. “Be careful what doors you open around here. Some are better left closed.”

I head out, clipboard in hand.

Back on the forklift, I’m reading the report on the mold. Says the products leave the warehouse perfectly fine. Every single shipment even went through an audit—an added step for quality control before it gets sent to the store.

Photos of the shipments are included too. Odd, there are markings on the outgoing shipment similar to the ones on the sage and cloves. Similar, but not the same.

I compare the photo in the report to the ones I took earlier. When you overlap them, they create a weak hex on the food.

This just got weird.

I told that bastard not to give me anything magic related. Hard to believe this was accidental.

Or is it something worse? No real magic, and I’m seeing connections that aren’t there. Like my mom.

No. Shake the thought. Focus. Think.

The candles. There are candles in the photos too.

I check the other disposition report. Looks like they’ve been finding those satanic candles, you know, the kind that disguise themselves as Catholic bullshit, with burnt wicks. The candles started showing up a week before the mold.

I remember a cult a few years back that tried to start biological warfare on the upper class in Victorville. Failed quick. They left pig carcasses all over town trying to spread swine flu. Idiots thought it came from pigs.

Looks like I’m taking a box of cloves and a candle on my way out. Send them out for testing. I bet there’s no real witchcraft going on. The wax in the candle must be activating mold growth on the box, and those circles are just marking the target product.

I did my job. Gathered the evidence they need. Showed they know what’s going on under their nose. I get a nice payout, don’t ask any questions, and I can finally ditch the Air Force base.
