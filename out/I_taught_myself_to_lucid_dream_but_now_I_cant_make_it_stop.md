I didn’t always have the ability to lucid dream. When I was younger, I used to do all these rituals while awake to try and encourage my awareness of reality. I’d hold my hands out in front of me and count how many fingers were on each one, I’d look at the time and ask myself if it made sense, I’d observe my surroundings and check the books I stacked in a specific pattern were all in order. I even took to drinking strange teas, brewed from exotic leaves I’d purchased online, even if the taste made it difficult to finish. Nevertheless, it was only when I got tired of trying and abandoned this phase that I began to experience consciousness in my dreams.

  
  


At the beginning, I was elated to have unlocked this superpower. I’d compulsively record the events in my previously neglected dream journal, detailing every path I chose, person I chose to see and place I visited. I’d conclude each entry with a paragraph of lines, the words ‘*tonight, I’ll lucid dream again*’, written over and over to manifest more. When I obsessed over it however, it wouldn’t happen. It was only when I forgot about it that I’d stop what I was doing, sensing some strangeness around me, count my fingers and find six on one hand.

  
  


One of my favourite dreams, over a year ago now, I was at work in the cafe as always when I got a strange compulsion to look at my hands. It was a terrible shift, everything had been going wrong and each customer seemed to be looking at me. As I suspected, my hands were completely deformed before my eyes. I let out an exhale in a mixture of amusement at the sight and relief that I was in a dream again. As soon as I’d figured it out, I halted my breath and composed myself. I’d long since learned to conceal my awareness from the characters in my head. I had no reason to believe anything bad would happen if I said aloud that I was asleep, but there was an instinctive fear within me of letting anything find out.

  
  


After my strange display of checking my hands and sighing, my colleague, Eloise, gave me a tense look. I didn’t like the way she looked at me. Her eyes met mine and her expression changed, her head tilting forward slowly, so that she was looking at me from the corner of her eye.

  
  


“Andrea?” She drawled out.

  
  


“Nothing, nothing,” I exclaimed, waving my hands frantically, before she’d even said anything. “None of this matters, anyway.”

  
  


She didn’t seem to like that, opening her mouth to say something, but I shut my eyes and began to spin around. Just as I’d willed it to, the room was different when I opened my eyes. No more strange customers, no colleagues, just me and the ex-boyfriend I’d been madly obsessed with. For my own dignity, I’ll call him something similar, like ‘Miles’. My fanaticism over a relationship that ended isn’t something I like to share, but in my defence, our one-sided relationship was something I only ever planned to keep in my dreams.

  
  


Miles was a frequent visitor of my lucid dreams, at my request of course. In this dream, I served him a coffee and whispered that I was a fan of his work in music. I did my best to be respectful and secretive as to not blow his cover in public, even though we were completely alone. In my dreams he’d always become the famous singer he’d dreamed of being himself. It seemed to make sense in the storyline I’d like to create. He was as gracious as ever, expressing his thanks and then offering for me to join him for a drink, as though he’d forgotten me and we were strangers again.

  
  


“I can’t,” I said, smiling at him with as much charm as I could muster. “I’m still working.”

  
  


He looked around the cafe and motioned to the lack of customers, allowing me to admire the flawless beauty of his side profile. “I don’t see any customers.” He said, a mischievous tone to his voice as he rested his chin in his hands.

  
  


A little caught off guard, I looked around also. “Right, yeah,” I mumbled. “I didn’t think you’d be aware of that.”

  
  


“You didn’t think I’d know we’re alone?” He said, tilting his head.

  
  


I sat down opposite him, swooning. “No, no, I mean-- I don’t know.” I said, fumbling over my words. What I’d meant to say was that I didn’t think he’d be as aware of our surroundings within the dream as I was. After all, he was merely a character created by me, how was I to know he transcended the logic of dreams? The situations and the rules I produced seemed to occasionally flicker out of my control.

  
  


I held out a hand. “My name’s Andrea.”

  
  


“That’s a beautiful name.”

  
  


We proceeded to have a lovely conversation over coffee that we never seemed to drink, before he invited me to ditch my work and head out with him. My memory of the dream became foggy after we left, but I recall seeing a few old friends out in town that I smugly ignored in favour of gazing only at Miles. At some points, his hair and clothes seemed to change a little, much to my frustration, but I knew the dream was simply becoming unstable and that I was waking up soon. Whenever I noticed, I’d reach up to adjust his hair, muttering to myself that he wasn’t holding together. He’d flush at my touch and smile, like I was doing something romantic for him.

  
  


Knowing I had very little time left, I began to rush us home to get out of the public eye. Alone, I remember that he kissed me, that amongst the fog of a collapsing dream, it was the last and yet most vivid, intense moment. A kiss within a dream was my favourite feeling. Every sense, every cell in my body, seemed hyper-tuned to the moment. There was a warmness in my chest and a softness to his lips that reality just couldn’t replicate. Not that it ever would.

  
  


I remember awakening from these types of dreams with a euphoria that had me snuggling back into my duvet, trying to pull the dream back to me. I’d roll out of bed and think about different frames of the movie I’d made, reliving the feeling of him looking at me. With my morning coffee, I’d fill my dream journal with the story.

  
  


I tried to recall the start of the dream, before I’d become lucid. I’d been at work, doing my job as always, so what had tipped me off that it was a dream? The shift was going badly, sure, but that happened in reality every now and then, so why had something felt so wrong? The only thing that stood out to me was Eloise’s face. She’d given me an odd look and there was something about her face that was unnatural and wrong. But it was only once the cover was blown, once I’d counted my fingers, that I realised she wasn’t right.

  
  


It was an entire month after that before I became lucid again. During the next time, I was walking around a shopping centre with a few friends, old friends again. I seemed to revisit the past often when in my subconscious.

  
  


We stopped by a fountain when things escalated in our conversation. I don’t remember what we were talking about, the group hollering angrily about something that felt important in the moment, but it was when Lydia addressed me that I realised.

  
  


“Don’t you have any remorse, Andrea?” Was what she asked me, outraged.

  
  


Time seemed to slow to a stop, gears in my head shuddering to a rusty halt. “Oh.” I said, and I looked at my hands, the only living things in my fabricated surroundings. I had far too many fingers.

  
  


I laughed, freely. I was once again standing in the midst of my own creation, like a mad inventor. I turned around the survey the place, but when I looked back at Lydia, my joy was sapped away.

  
  


Her face had changed. It was still her, but her hair had thinned out and turned dull, her jaw was unnaturally wide, like the blood and fat from her face had drained and her skin had been vacuum-packed to her bones.

  
  


“Don’t do that.” She said, hauntingly. She began to slowly shake her head.

  
  


I felt myself frowning, confused by this tonal shift. I wasn’t sure what it was, but everything was frightening all of a sudden, dread weighing down on me like a weighted blanket. I turned to my other old friends, who stood, dazed, in my peripheral. When I tried to look at them directly however, they were gone.

  
  


I told myself I had no reason to be afraid, this was *my* dream after all. I closed my eyes and snapped my fingers in her unsettling face to make her disappear, but she wouldn’t. When I opened my eyes, she still stood before me, eyes sinking into her increasingly grey face.

  
  


“You’re not Lydia.” I said, slowly. When I’d said it, I meant that she simply wasn’t real, but she started smiling. It was as though she agreed with me.

  
  


She tilted her head to the side, the same way Eloise had in my cafe date dream. That’s right, she wasn’t Lydia at all, but perhaps she was something else entirely.

  
  


I closed my eyes, panicking a little. I simply kept them shut as I gathered myself. This was *my* dream, my creation. I was in control here, so how could it possibly turn into a nightmare? I willed her to be gone, for someone nice to be with me instead, but when I opened my eyes again, she was still there.

  
  


I snapped my eyes back shut instantly, so only an imprint of her figure flashed behind my eyelids. For a single frame, I’d seen a ghastly grin below wide, black eyes, one that stretched from ear to ear and arced unnaturally low.

  
  


*No*, I told myself. I wouldn’t subject myself to this while fully lucid. It wasn’t fair of my own brain to do this to me, knowing I was aware of myself. So I squeezed, scrunched my face up and shook my head, over and over and over.

  
  


And when I awoke I was in my bed. This was my method. When I’d realised I was dreaming within a nightmare before, this was my way of waking myself up, but I’d never had a dream become something terrifying while I was aware of it like that.

  
  


Climbing out of bed in the pitch black, I padded across to the curtains and opened them to try and figure out the time, where I was greeted by the blinding street lights and black sky. I looked down at the fabric of the curtain in my hand. I couldn’t really feel it and I wasn’t sure why I would look outside to check the time instead of just checking my phone. I hadn’t had to dodge the tangle of wires that usually blocked my side of the bed, either.

  
  


One, two, three, four, five, six, seven… Of course. I was still asleep. I smiled, glad I hadn’t lost my chance to have a nice dream and gazed down the street. It was unnaturally foggy outside and I didn’t like that, but it didn’t seem to change when I tried to make it sunny.

  
  


When I took in the stretching emptiness of the street, a face with a chilling smile flashed into my memory and I stiffly turned to look at my bedroom door. It was cloaked in darkness, so much that I could barely make out the frame of it. That familiar horror set into my core, paralysing me to the spot. I didn’t want to look at the door. Was it open? I wanted nothing more than to turn away from it, but something within me screamed warnings to not look out the window, either.

  
  


That same fear, the one I’d felt when I looked at Lydia-- at the *thing*\-- had me holding my breath. I closed my eyes, the only thing I could do to escape. It was here. I felt its presence. I knew my own brain well enough that I could feel when something was amiss; it was what had allowed me to begin lucid dreaming in the first place, after all.

  
  


With my sight taken away, I could only wait in silence for something to make a sound or touch me. I tensed, anticipating something brushing against me. I expected it so fiercely that I was beginning to force it.

  
  


Yes, someone’s here. Someone’s holding my hand, I was telling myself.

  
  


“Miles?” I said, quietly. “That’s you, isn’t it?”

  
  


Miles’ hand squeezed mine in response and I opened my eyes. I was still in the dark room, but now he was here with me. He was wearing the cap he often wore, back when we first got together, and he was smiling down at me.

  
  


“What is it?” He asked, rubbing his thumb soothingly over the back of my hand.

  
  


“Nothing, I just—” I stammered. “I thought something was here. Something horrible.”

  
  


He shrugged. “Just me.” He said, leaning down to kiss my forehead.

  
  


This time, he didn’t feel like some celebrity that I dreamed up or some other perfect version of Miles that he would be playing. It really felt like him and as though he knew exactly what was going on in my head.

  
  


I pulled him towards me and breathed in his chalky violet smell, as comforting and fresh as ever. “I miss you.” I said.

  
  


He stroked my hair and sighed. “I miss you, too,” He breathed onto the top of my head. “Where have you been, chick?”

  
  


Something was ringing in the distance, irritating me.

  
  


“Right here.” I said. “I’ll always be right here, waiting for you.”

  
  


When I looked up, he wasn’t wearing his hat anymore. His hair was wet. “Aren’t you going to answer that?” He said.

  
  


I gave him a puzzled look and listened out for the phone, afraid of who it could be. Ah, the ringing. It was my morning alarm. I was relieved it wasn’t that dreaded phone call again, but my morning alarm wasn’t what I wanted to hear, either.

  
  


“I love you.” I said, and I kissed him softly.

  
  


I’d never been so furious at my alarm as I was that morning, turning it off and shutting my eyes immediately to try and will Miles back to me. But a demented smile was all I could see, forcing me to let go and allow myself to wake up.

  
When I got out of bed, the first thing I did was count my fingers. Ten, as there should be. Although in that dream I'd wanted nothing more than to be out of it, being in reality meant I could no longer have Miles and the weight of that had my eyes watery as I made my coffee and I got ready for work.



It was on the drive to work that my phone really did ring. I knew better than to answer an unknown number, so I let it ring. My choice was further justified when the number tried me three more times.



I had ten fingers when Eloise said good morning to me and ten fingers when I stopped for lunch.



“What’s on your mind today?” She asked me, sidling up beside me.



I analysed her face for a second, looking for anything to cross-examine when I encountered her at night. “Nothing, really.” I said. “I just haven’t been sleeping well.”



“I thought so.” Eloise said, humming thoughtfully. “You look exhausted.”



“Thanks.” I muttered, with a half-hearted laugh.



“Seriously, though,” she reiterated. “Have some caffeine, or something. I’m not saying this to be mean, but I’ve been cleaning up after you all morning.”



I shot her a look of bewilderment. I had no recollection of being such a mess behind the counter all morning. I had the urge to double check I really was awake.



“Oh, I’m sorry.” I said. “I didn’t even realise.”



“That’s okay, I’m sorry to criticise you, it’s just that,” Eloise paused to check no one would overhear her. “Mallory’s been watching you.”



With an exaggerated roll of my eyes, I started picking at my nails. “I’m sure she has.” I grumbled. “She’s been looking for an excuse to fire me.”



“Don’t be silly!” Eloise exclaimed, giving me a light tap in the arm. “You know she can’t fire you, anyway, you’re invincible here. She might just have a chat with you if you get another order wrong.”



I held up a hand. “Woah-woah-woah,” I said. “What do you mean ‘invincible’?”



Eloise leaned back from me, her shoulders dropping. She opened her mouth and faltered. I began to piece together that she’d said something precarious before she even elaborated. “I just mean, with everything.” She said, quietly. “She wouldn’t do that to you.”



Mallory, my mother’s childhood friend, was talking enthusiastically to a customer on the other side of the cafe, unaware of her coworkers’ discussion of her. I knew she had given me this job to help me out, but I didn’t realise I was such a hinder to her business and that I’d left her trapped here with me. I’d already cost her customers by showing my face here, now I was making a mess of the job, too?



Eloise had left me to my thoughts at some point, catching onto the fact that she’d almost broached something dangerous. She busied herself with polishing and wrapping cutlery, as though that was an urgent task calling her attention.



When I left work, I snuck out to avoid a talk with Mallory. I hoped she didn’t figure out that I could hear her calling out to me as I walked out with my headphones on. I couldn’t avoid her stern lecture forever, but at least for today.



I knocked out by midnight, but nothing I dreamt about that following night stuck in my memory long enough to be of note. I only know that I woke up feeling even more tired than ever, afraid and paranoid that something had smiled at me again that night.



For a month or so, I was unable to keep up with the films my brain showed me. I’d simply be an audience member to the display my subconscious was able to come up with. If I ever managed to get ahold of myself, to realise I was dreaming, the cycle would begin.



The ‘cycle’, as I referred to it, was this torturous phenomenon in which my dreams and my reality began to blur together.



One of the most notable occurrences of the cycle was after a particularly troubling nightmare. I was with Miles, this time of my brain’s own doing and not my lucid actions. We were on a boat together, the pair of us soaking wet after swimming in our clothes. We were laughing away, enjoying each other’s company and the view of the sun dipping into the sea, when he started shivering.



Unaware that I was asleep, I began to swarm around him, wrapping him in my jacket and rubbing his arms to try and warm him up. He shut his eyes and seemed to go a little limp, slumped over in the boat, but his teeth continued to chatter.



“Miles?” I shook him, but he gave no response.



I couldn’t begin to explain why, but in my dream state, I figured he was past the point of no return. He was too cold to ever recover. His lips were blue, his lashes seemed to be glued shut with ice, his cheeks were gaunt and his clothes hung off him like a scarecrow.



Overhead, a gull began to dive at him, like he was a floating carcass, ripe for the picking. Although I did my best to swat it away, it wouldn’t relent, even trying to take some chunks out of me. Infuriated, I decided to solve the problem, gently pushing Miles backwards. He slid off the boat like a rag, as though his clothes were empty, teeth still chattering as he was submerged.



When I started crying, the gull landed on the boat, where Miles had been sitting previously. It started cawing at me with a disgusting scream, so I started swinging the oar of the boat at it. It dodged me again and again, deafening me with its wounded yowling.



At last, I managed to hit it, sending it with a splatter to the bottom of the boat. There it lay in pieces, black eyes flickering around and beak quivering as it let out little bird-like chortles.



Its eyes made me sick with terror. It was like there was something else in there, some parasite living alongside the bird that had now taken over its autonomy.



That all-too-familiar fear of something else being present turned me lucid. I was asleep and I hadn’t pushed Miles. This was just a nightmare. The bird got louder and louder with its pained screeches. Whatever it was, I stamped it out with an unbridled rage and awoke with a gasp that hurt my chest.



I was drenched in sweat, so much so that I considered the possibility that I’d pissed myself. The discomfort grew and my chest kept hurting as I lay in bed, surrounded by the dark, so I tried to roll over in bed. But when I turned over, I stopped dead.



There, in the dark, was a girl. She mirrored my position exactly, one hand under her head and the other under her chin, but she had large, black eyes and a tiny mouth and nose, like her head wasn’t fully developed.



Gradually, she began to open her mouth, where a black void laid within. It opened wider, beginning to distort her eyes, and my heart pounded so loud I was sure I couldn’t possibly be asleep.



Unable to move, I did the only thing I could think to do and shut my eyes, squeezing tight. I held strong for ten seconds and when I let go and looked, she was still there. So I tried again. I knew this would work, it always did, so I just kept squeezing. Checking, then squeezing.



After my fourth attempt, I opened my eyes to a bright room. With an uncontrolled sob, I snagged my phone from where it was plugged on the floor and checked the time. It was 08:43AM, meaning I was going to be late to work.



I ran to work, sweating and trying to tie my hair up, but when I arrived, there was only Eloise and Mallory in the cafe, sitting around a table. There was a third seat for me, so I had a feeling I was in some deep shit.



When I sat down, they were mid conversation. Mallory spared me a quick glance and then let out a groan, motioning her hand at me. “You see what I mean?” She said, pinching the bridge of her nose.



Eloise shook her head, disapprovingly. “I know, I’ve been telling her.” She said.



I looked between them, confused, before I realised I was sat there in my pyjamas, no shoes on and likely yesterday’s mascara smeared across my face.



“Please, just give me another shot.” I begged Mallory. “I can be a valuable employee to you, I swear! You can fire me if I’m useless, okay? You don’t need to keep me here just because you feel bad, but let me prove myself, please.”



“Did you run here?” Was all Mallory said.



“Yes, I—” I stammered, wiping sweat from my forehead with shame. But then I stopped.



The cafe was thirteen miles from my house and I had run here. No way in hell could I have done that. I checked my phone. 08:43AM. I counted my fingers.



When I woke up, the little girl was there again, so I forced myself awake. 08:43AM.



I wouldn’t do it again, I wouldn’t rush to work. This was a dream, after all. I sat up in bed and looked around. Nothing felt off. Ten fingers, but I wouldn’t believe it.



I wrapped my arms around myself and listened to the silence in my apartment. Any minute now, my brain would summon something. I waited, but nothing came.



It was only when I stopped waiting that there was a noise in the other room and the fear hit me. I had been trying to summon something, but nothing would come, so whatever was here now was no creation of mine.



“Wake up, please.” I said, out loud. “Wake up. Wake up.”



The noise in the other room had initially been a single tap, but it escalated into a scratching that seemed to scurry across the floor, towards my bedroom door.



I shut my eyes. “Miles?” I called out.



When I called out to him, the instance that followed was the first time I ever heard the thing speak to me.



The sound was gravelly and echoed in my head like it was speaking right into my ear. There were layers of higher, whistling octaves and deep, bass tones reciting the words: “He’s gone.”



Some weeks after this particular cycle, I decided it was time to call him. He hadn’t heard from me in over a year, but I’d reached my wits’ end. I’d spent my waking hours meditating, writing and medicating, but I knew there would be no end to my nightmares if I didn’t get some closure.



I listened to it ring with shaky hands. I had no idea how he would react, but I only prayed it wasn’t anger. I was the one who left him, so what right did I have to seek closure?



“Hello?” Came his voice, his soothing, safe voice, from the other end.



“Miles, hey.” I said, my voice wobbling in response. “I’m so sorry to bother you. I know it’s been a long time and I know I shouldn’t be doing this, but there’s something I really want to talk to you about.”



I stumbled over my words as I spoke, unsure of what to even say now that I had the chance to say it.



The line went silent for a little while. “Is everything alright?” He finally said.



My vision blurred with tears at the goodness of his heart to even ask. “Well, yes, sort of,” I stammered. “I just really need to speak to you. In person.”



He went quiet again. Just as I began to get antsy, he replied. “Okay.” He said. “Do you want me to come over?”



“Yes, please. Thank you,” I was practically wailing. “Thank you, thank you.”



“Don’t thank me.” He said, sharply. “I’ll listen to what you have to say, but this won’t happen again.”



I started nodding frantically, as if he could see me. “That’s fine, that’s fine.”



“Don’t expect anything, Drea.” He said. “You left me, remember?”



“No, I know—” I began, but the phone started beeping in my ear. I pulled it away to see that there was someone else calling me. “Hang on.”



I picked up and readied myself to start yelling at the unknown number to leave me alone, to go to hell, whatever curses and insults I could come up with, but I stopped short.



“Andrea?” It was Miles’ mother. I’d recognise that voice anywhere, after all the hours I’d listened to it scream at me.



“Hello?” I whispered.



I got up from my bed and looked out the window, as though expecting Miles to show up already and save me from whatever his mother was about to tell me.



“Have you heard from Miles?” She asked.



“Yes?” I mumbled. “I just spoke to him.”



“Was he driving to you?”



I swallowed, dryly, shielding my eyes with my hand. I couldn’t answer her. I stared into the palm of my hand.



“Andrea, answer me.” She began, her voice getting louder. “Did you tell him to drive to your house?”



“So what if I did?”



“He’s been killed, Andrea! My son is lying on a slate, freezing cold and full of water because you insisted on him coming to see you in these weather conditions! He drowned, slowly, painfully, because of you!”



I hung up the phone. Eight fingers on my hand.



Miles was fine, I told myself. This isn’t real. Nothing that feels this bad is ever real.



When I woke up from that one I was in a hospital bed, one hand held by my mother and the other by Miles. I broke my hand free of his and counted. No good.



I squeezed my eyes shut. Again. And again.



“Wake me up.” I whispered, staring at the white ceiling.



Miles took my hand again. “Why?” He asked. His hand was freezing cold.



His eyes looked darker than they usually were and I had to close my eyes and look away from him. I trusted him, up here in my head, more than anything. No matter how many times I stabbed him, pushed him, strangled him, he’d never be the one to hurt me. So what had changed now? Why now had the parasite begun to change the way he looked at me?



The next time I looked at him, water seemed to be streaming from his mouth. He started coughing.



“I’m sorry.” I breathed out. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”



He tried to speak to me, but no sound would come out aside from choked gargling. His eyes were bloodshot, neck veins bulging.



I continued, desperately. “I never would’ve left you there if I’d known there was a chance.” I cried out. “Please, believe me! I didn’t want you to die!”



“He can’t hear you, sweetheart.” My mother said, softly, from beside me.

  
Black hair fell to the floor from Miles' head in a clump as he convulsed, blood dripping from his nose that had become disfigured by his own nails clawing at his neck and face.



“He has to!” I exclaimed, thrashing free of her grip. “It’s not too late! Miles, I wish every day it had been me left behind in that car.”



There were many times that I poured my heart out to him, that I was sorry, that I wanted to die in his place, but he never seemed to get the chance to hear me.



At 08:43AM, after a long night of keeping awake, dosed up on caffeine and cocaine, I got in my car and drove. Every now and then, I’d catch glimpses of him in my mirrors. I’d remember the times we laughed, the times we sang at the top of our lungs, each one reflected back at me. I remembered the last time, our big fight. He’d been yelling, he’d knocked my coffee out of my hands, splashing it across my lap and across the seat. I’d screamed back at him.



Glazed over with rage and masked by the dark, he’d missed the car coming around the bend on the narrow road. I was angry when I grabbed that wheel, I remember that very well.



I pulled up at the bend and stared down the ditch over the dashboard. In that moment, in the few minutes that I questioned myself, my phone rang. I never picked up these anonymous calls, knew it would only be someone trying to hurt me, but for some reason, in my current state of mind, I answered.

  
I didn't even get a chance to speak before the voice on the other end said the word I'd grown used to hearing.



"Murderer."



When I put my foot down and aimed for the lake, I only hoped I wouldn’t dream when I was dead.



The drive down to the lake was longer than I remember the fall being, the car banging over every rock as the ground fell away. One rock in particular jostled me so hard that I lunged forward and hit my head on the wheel. Something crawled down my forehead, so fast that it wasn't long before it reached my eyes and I saw blood.



By the time I hit the water, I’d almost changed my mind, but the cold rushing in sobered me up and set me in my decision.



Just as I’d dreamed it, I unfastened my seatbelt and crawled over to the passenger seat, exactly where I’d been that night, where I’d turned to see him bleeding out and completely motionless.

  
Alive.



It was when the cold water rose to my neck that I looked in the rear view mirror and saw it. The thing that my brain hadn’t invited in was watching me sink with its black eyes. But I didn't have the strength to even be afraid of it anymore.



Water filled my lungs and rattled me from the inside out. The pain was welcome, every nerve in my body reacting like electricity, but my physical reaction was to start madly clawing at the window, at the door, at myself, at anything.



In the flurry of bubbles and the sound of my own muffled voice screaming, I saw in my bleary line of sight the number of fingers on my hand.



One, two, three, four, five, six.
