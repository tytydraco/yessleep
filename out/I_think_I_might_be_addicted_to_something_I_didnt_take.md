They say drug residue can seep into your skin, even through layers. That it clings to the walls, the carpet, the insulation. They say that buildings hold onto memories, and never really let go of the things that happened inside them... Ghosts and residue, that has to be what this is. Some kind of contamination. Some kind of exposure. 

Right? 

 

I work in hazardous materials cleanup, mostly, that means cleaning up the mess after an untimely death. I’m no stranger to the unsavory details that come with the job, I’ve seen it all, the aftermath and remnants from every manner of accident, overdose, violent crime, you name it, I’ve picked it up. But apartment complex D6 was different. Something from that place has stayed with me, lingering like an ache in my bones, that I just can’t shake. 

 

We were just supposed to do a standard sweep of the place. It was a decon job. These places can be extremely dangerous. Toxic chemicals from drugs or a lack of maintenance can hang in the air, among other hazards, so we took every precaution. We wore standard Level 4 PPE. Full-body Tychem coveralls with sealed hoods. Dual-cartridge P100 respirators. Triple layer nitrile gloves taped at the wrists. Steel toed boots with Tyvek booties. We were even equipped with air quality monitors clipped to our chests. Fentanyl tape, radon, H2S, CO2. None of our sensitive chemical sensing equipment pinged when we entered. 

 

And yet whatever got to me cut straight through all of it.  

 

The building was quiet. Four stories of crumbling red graffiti tagged brick partially overtaken by weeds and vines. Ivy climbed its way up crooked balconies lined with black iron railings. Every window on the place was either boarded up or blacked out with plastic sheeting, some of it left loosely flapping in the wind. 

 

The main entrance was sealed with plywood and steel bars, but the side door near the alley was propped open slightly with a pile of balled up old clothing. Above it a security light that hadn’t lit up since the power was cut back in 2011. That was our way in. 

 

We had a three person cleaning crew, Jess, Lazo and myself. Our trio had gutted out and scrubbed dozens of locations. Everything from mold in condemned nursing homes, to hauling rotten meat out of an abandoned school cafeteria in mid summer, hell we even pulled a bunch of sleeping bags out a crack den that were nearly liquefied with human waste. Disgusting, I know, try not to lose your lunch. But nothing, and I mean nothing made me feel sick like Building D6. 

 

“So what’s the story with this one?” Jess asked, her voice muffled by her respirator. 

 

I filled them in with the details, it’d been abandoned for fourteen years after an irreparable infestation of mold had caused some of the residents to become ill. Ever since, it’s been prime real-estate for homeless squatters and drug addicts. Cops called six times in the past year by neighboring residents because of noise and fights on the property, five deaths either from overdose or exposure. The place was a complete write off, the Quiet Side municipality ordered it to be torn down, but first they want it scrubbed for two reasons. The first being to make sure there’s no squatters inside when they knock the place down, and the second being to ensure there’s not dangerous contaminants that may hurt the demolition crew. That’s where we come in. 

 

It was about 6:30 a.m., just after sunrise when we’d made entry with our tools ready. Lazo hesitated on the steps.  

 

“Something’s off,” he muttered. “Smells of copper and gutter wine.” Tell tale signs of human occupancy, it was possible there were people inside. But with my guard up I pushed the side door open and called out. “Room service, anyone home?” - Not a soul to be heard. 

 

Inside was a damp hallway. Every surface slick with condensation and the rain soaked carpeted floor squished under my boot, obviously that door had been open for quite some time. We made our way down the hall, keeping an eye on our air quality monitors and came to the first apartment. The door nob had been completely removed and it opened with a slight touch. The place was a mess, overturned furniture and garbage littered the living room and the wall paper curled and peeled from nicotine stained drywall. There was even a toddlers sneaker laying beside a broken ceiling fan on the floor, just one. 

 

I’d gone a bit deeper into the apartment to look for any signs of life while the others screened the living room for drugs or anything dangerous. The next room is where this nightmare really began. In the master bedroom lay a mattress in the middle of the floor. It wasn’t just stained, something was imprinted, no, indented into it. The shape of a curled up human body had decayed directly into the foam. Head, shoulders, hips, knees. A human outline sunk into rot. The stain was brownish black and shimmered slightly in the air above it. 

“Hey guys!” I shouted. “Somebody died in here, looks like they laid here for a while too but there’s no body.” I heard the others enter the room behind me. “Holy shit...” Jess whispered as she crept up beside me to take a photo to show our contract holder. 

 

Thats when I noticed a charred spoon lay in the center, blackened and fused at the handle like it had been heated until it bent. Beside it was a melted syringe stuck to a bible. The page beneath it ironically reading: Let not the unclean pass. 

 

“Hey, do you guys remember that time we cleaned out Quiet Side Sanitarium?” Laz said, kicking aside debris from a torn open sofa cushion.  

“Christ,” Jess snorted. “The one with the raccoon in the pantry?” 

“Nah, that was the old cafeteria. I mean the sanitarium. Where you duct-taped a mannequin to the gurney and scared the living shit out of Miles.” 

“Ohhh Yeah,” She grinned. “I thought he was gonna puke in his respirator. Didn’t you almost swing at it Miles?” 

I shrugged. “Looked like a damn body. In the dark, everything looks like a damn body.” 

“That’s the point of the joke, man.” Laz laughed. “We gotta get you to loosen up some how. Just because you’re the senior on the site doesn’t mean you can’t piss yourself like the rest of us.” 

 

I gave them a dry smile. Joking was fine, but some things just weren't all that funny to be laughed at to me. Death was one of those things 

 

That’s... the last time I remember being with them, Jess and Lazo. 

 

We'd split up to sweep the rest of the apartments on the ground. Slowly but surely we made our way through them, most were completely emptied out or just as trashed as the first. I had gotten a bit ahead of the others and made my decent into the basement level down a staircase. “Headed downstairs,” I radioed in.  

“Okay, keep your mic on,” Jess answered. 

 

I clicked the flashlight fixed to my chest rig and descended cautiously. The plywood steps flexed under my weight. The movement caused dust in the air to stir, obscuring my flashlight beam and clinging to the visor of my gas mask and coating my suit. 

 

In the next apartment a kitchenette came first. Rusted cabinets. A tower old empty pill bottles on the stove top and a pan filled with old dried something. The previous occupant had fashioned a crucifix out of bent silverware and electrical tape and hung it above the microwave. At that point I’d seen enough and proceeded further, walking through what I’d assumed was a bedroom door, but... looking around I had found myself back in the hallway. I must have gotten myself turned around in the darkness somehow, so I turned and then I was back in the kitchenette again, but the room looked different. The pill bottles were stacked in two towers instead of one, and the makeshift crucifix was upside down. 

 

I froze, my heart beginning to beat faster. This was frightening, I thought somebody had to be in here fucking with me in the dark. What the hell had just happened? I took a step back and turned to leave. The hallway was gone. The door behind me was shut now, but I didn’t hear it close at all. 

 

I grabbed my radio and keyed the mic.  “Jess, Laz, I need somebody to come get me. I don’t know what I did but I’m lost down here. I think there’s somebody down here!” 

 

No response. Static.  

Then a faint response. “We’re here.” 

“Where here?” I asked, “I’m in the basement.” 

The radio went silent... then a moment later “Inside, you.” 

 

My hands trembled and my mind raced. This was not the time or place for a prank. I tore the mic off my chest and backed away, but there was nowhere to go. The space had shifted again. Every surface begun to curve slightly like the room was a lens focusing inward. Then the wall paper began to peel revealing a change of color from off-white to greyish green like mold and ash. 

 

“What the hell?” I whispered to myself, panicking now. I noticed an open doorway to my right and broke into a run, sprinting through it and something brought me to an immediate halt. I had nearly just ran straight into an elevator shaft sealed off with a wall of wooden planks. Turning to look over my shoulder I could see the doorway I’d just ran through was gone, no further away, where I’d just come from was now a long narrow hall with a shut door at the end. This was insane, something was either seriously wrong with this place or wrong with my head. Focusing back on the planks In front of me I managed to squeeze my gloved fingers through a crack between two of them and with a few hard pushes I pried one loose and it fell. Looking through the opening, there was no elevator, just an open black shaft. Suddenly a putrid smell of ammonia blasted through my masks filters from the opening. 

 

I turned back, retching from the smell. The door was gone... in its place was just a concrete wall. No doors. “What the hell is going on!” I screamed out loudly, trying my radio again. It was no use, the battery was now reading dead. The area had changed, had I no other option but the elevator shaft? My stomach lurched at the thought.  

 

Turning around again to face it, it too was gone. THE ELEVATOR SHAFT WAS GONE. In its place was the staircase I’d used to enter the basement, except I was now at the top again and they went down, and a sudden and obvious thought crossed my mind. Was I high? Had I pricked myself on a drug needle and accidentally injected myself something? No, there’s no way I would have felt it. Then I Pressed my palms over the filters on my mask and inhaled to test the pressure. They weren’t loose, they had a perfect seal. If I hadn’t gotten jabbed, and I wasn’t inhaling fumes then what could be happening? Rooms don’t just change their shape. Either I had been exposed to some kind of drug, or I was having some kind of mental breakdown.  

 

I was no longer acting consciously; I was in full panic. Without hesitation I began down the stairs quickly. This was the only way I could go right? Did this building have a sub basement? No, the floor plans didn’t show that. But it had too, because as I descended the sagging staircase there was steel door, above it was a small plaque that read Sub Level 1. I tried the doors push handle, nothing. Locked, and it was heavy. There's no way I could break this open without a crow bar. The stairs continued down, Sub Level 2, Sub Level 3. All locked. The walls changed to raw stone as I descended. “This can’t be real,” I screamed, slamming my hands against the walls. “Let me out of this place!” 

 

I had passed several more locked doors, finally the stairs came to a bottom. All that was there was a single rusted steel door with a security glass window, flickering with a dull light behind it. I scanned the walls with my flashlight, this was the only way. Some kind of symbol I didn’t recognize was etched into the top of the door. It looked ominous, carved into the rust. 

 

That’s when I caught my reflection in the glass panel on the door as I attempted to peer through it to get a look at the other side. My pupils were blown, completely dilated, my skin pale. 

 

A sudden loud BEEP BEEP startled me, it was my air quality monitor spiking on my chest rig. The screen was flashing red and illuminating the space around me. Heart rate: 160. Oxygen Plummeting. Oddly, it wasn’t detecting any known toxins. Given what I was experiencing I’d expect that some airborne toxin would be present. It wasn’t, but the oxygen was very thin here. 

 

This environment was lethal and could clearly kill me if I didn’t keep moving, so I placed my hand on the push handle and gave it a strong shove. It was heavy, but it creaked open with a sharp metalic creak. 

 

Beyond it was a room that was dimly lit with dozens of candles arranged in a circle. Not bright enough to illuminate the walls, just the floor around this circle. In the center was a deep hole dug into the floor through the concrete, I couldn’t see what was inside unless I got closer... all that surrounded me was blackness. As I stepped closer, I looked into the pit. My stomach turned, and my heart dropped at the sight of human remains wearing a tattered hazmat suit like mine. Curled into the fetal-position with blood pooling in its visor. 

 

Against my gut, I kneeled to get a closer look. I could see through the bloody plastic visor, the persons face was decomposing and almost skeletal, and covered with a black mossy substance. Then its eyeball turned to look at me and blinked. I jumped back and yelped, stumbling hard onto my hands and knees. I wanted to crawl back towards the open door but... I heard something, something moved in the darkness. A slow shuffling of feet. Too afraid to leave the candle light I just sat there on all fours, paralyzed in fear.  

 

A low, guttural growl like that of an animal rumbled through my ears. Something began to emerge from the shadows. First a foot, ashy and grey, covered in what looked like patches of black fuzzy mold. Then the rest of the thing uncoiled into the light. It was impossibly tall and thin, like a human that’d been stretched, knees, elbows and hips almost poking through tight nearly translucent skin like knives. It bent down to my level, face to... face. It was featureless except for two pinprick black eyes surrounded by sinking reddening eye sockets. It had no mouth, and yet I heard it speak. 

 

“We feed... on flesh... on fear... you will be one with the mold.”  

The things jaw opened, its skin tearing open to reveal rows of jagged black teeth. It’s moldy hand reached out toward me with filthy long finger nails and it surged forward. My knee’s buckled, and I screamed. 

 

That’s when I woke up outside, on the lawn. Laying on my back. 

Jess was shaking me. Laz was already stripping off my suit when I came too, yelling for the first aid kit. I curled into the fetal position and yanked my helmet off just before filling it with vomit. My body ceased and convulsed painfully. 

 

They doused me with neutralizer. Hit me with oxygen, Narcan, and Adrenaline. My pulse was one hundred and ninety beats per minute. Jess kept asking “What did you touch, what got through your suit?” 

 

I couldn’t answer, I didn’t know, and even then, how could I explain? I was just so glad to be out of there. Away from that wretched thing. Glad to be alive. 

 

Ambulance sirens wailed faintly in the distance, growing closer. Laz waived the EMT’s over, one arm wrapped around my shoulders to keep me sitting upright. My head weighed a thousand pounds and lolled heavily. I was soaked in sweat, my teeth chattering uncontrollably, vision unable to focus. 

 

“We found him wandering out of the basement.” Jess told the paramedics, breathless and still clutching her half-unzipped suit. “We got separated, he was punching the walls, screaming at something. Screaming for it to get out of his skin.” 

“We tried to talk to him,” Laz added. “But he just wouldn’t stop. Just kept pacing and screaming in the hallway like he was lost. Then he just collapsed, and we dragged him out here.” 

 

The paramedics checked my vitals, whispering to each other, asking repeatedly if I’d taken anything, if maybe I’d accidentally gotten dosed on site. Jess just shook her head. 

 

“We were all in full gear. Same as him. He was totally clean going in and I didn’t see any damage to his suit besides scrapes on the knees and the torn gloves from punching the walls.” 

 

I wasn’t clean now. My hands were scraped raw. My knuckles were split wide open and bleeding. I could still hear the snarl of that thing reverberating in my skull. I could still smell the ammonia like it had leached into my skin. Something was so, so wrong, and my numb lips couldn’t form the words to say it. They strapped me to a gurney, and loaded me into the back of the ambulance. Jess rode with me, Laz stayed to write a statement with the authorities who’d arrived just as we were leaving. 

 

 

That was my last cleanup detail. 

 

They called it chemical exposure. Some kind of aerosolized opiate or synthetic hallucinogen. They claimed my P100 mask filters must have been faulty, and it was all just a hallucination and an unintentional overdose due to exposure. But nothing showed up later in my bloodwork. No fentanyl, no PCP, no ketamine, nothing. Clean. Just elevated levels of cortisol, and traces of saline... salt water, from the intravenous drip I was given by paramedics. 

 

It’s been seven days. Jess and Laz have been off cleanup detail since. They had a close call in that place but not quite like me. They told me they cleared the rest of the building and didn’t see any of the stuff I’d described. Apartment complex D6 has since been knocked down, and bulldozed... it’s good to know that place can’t hurt anyone else. That thing that lives in the sub levels that don’t exist. I can’t accept that it was just a hallucination. Because lately I’ve been experiencing cravings, withdrawal symptoms, and I’ve become self aware of my own psychotic episodes. 

 

I don’t sleep anymore. When I close my eyes I feel dust on my face, in my mouth, like I’m back in that things chamber. I see the flickering of the candles behind my eyelids. My own reflection whispers when I turn away from it. It says, “Feed me to the mold”. 

 

That thing, whatever it was I saw beneath the building, I think it’s in my home now, or in my head. I came out of that place but I think it came with me. I can feel it lingering in the corners of my apartment, in the corner of my vision. When I look it’s gone but I can feel its presence. It’s in my walls, the ceiling, the floorboards. I can hear its grown in the hum of my refrigerator. 

 

It’s even in my dream now. Sometimes I wake up standing in the kitchen, catching myself talking to someone who isn’t there. Sometimes I wake up mid-sentence, whispering promises in some other language that I don’t even understand. It tells me I belong with it. That I’m one with it. That if I just feed myself to the mold I won’t hurt anymore. The worst part is, it feels right. 

 

I seen Jess again last night, she’s been coming to check on me at home every few days. This time I didn’t answer the door. I didn’t want her to see me like this, Didn’t want to risk having an episode in front of her. I watched her from the upstairs window. She stood there for ten minutes, trying my cell phone several times before leaving. 

 

I’ve started walking past the demolition site at night. Just to stand there and look at it. All the material is basically gone, but it’s like I’m just drawn, pulled to the property. I think it’s calling me. I can feel it behind my teeth. In the pressure behind my eyes. Sometimes my skin itches like that mold is growing underneath, it's not painfull, it's more like warmth. I've come to like it.

 

I think I might be addicted to something I didn’t take... and it's getting worse.
