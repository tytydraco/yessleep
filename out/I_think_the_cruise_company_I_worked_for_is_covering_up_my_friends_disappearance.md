Right, I know this is a long post but I’m leaving in a few days and I wanted to be sure I got it all out there. If something happens and I don’t come back, at least I’m not the only one who knows the truth.

I started working on cruise ships a few years ago. It’s definitely a strange job; you’re cooped up with your co-workers 24/7 for weeks on end. People hook up, people fight. And it isn’t for everyone. Some times people get off at a port and never come back. What I’m saying is that I am used to the usual cruise ship weirdness. But this was different.

I’d been an AV techie for a few different ships in the Caribbean when a friend of mine suggested I check out Velorum. Their ships were really fancy, which means better equipment and better pay. So I applied and, even though I was less experienced than they were looking for, I got the gig.

It started off pretty normal, you know, just another job on the high seas. It was definitely stricter than other ships I’d been on. Like, crew wasn’t allowed on the promenade unless they were working and we’re not meant to be above deck at all during our off hours. It didn’t really effect me because I worked with the theatre team and was had access to pretty much every where, but you’ve got to understand, weeks at sea and not being allowed topside is pretty intense for some people. So at first I took everything in stride, but looking back I should have noticed something was off from the start.

From day one, there was this vibe on the ship, like everyone was keeping secrets. Certain crew members were always whispering and shoot each other these looks, like they were afraid of something. At first I thought it was just because everything was so strict, you know. Just people trying to keep their jobs. But they seemed genuinely scared of something.

Usually these ships are like a total party for crew, but this one was just the opposite. Everyone really kept to themselves. To be honest, I thought I might just quit- it really didn’t seem like the place for me. But then I met Chloe. She was a new member of the theatre team, so we got to know each other a bit during the show. I was putting her mic on and told some stupid joke about hearing her heart beat faster, but then she laughed. Pretty soon, we were spending all our free time together. Man, she was something else—funny, smart, and super cute. I’d had a policy not to date anyone on the ships before, but she really was different. There isn’t a lot of privacy on these cruises, but we found places we could be alone. Just because we weren’t allowed topside, that didn’t stop us from exploring every nook and cranny of that ship.

I’d sort of forgotten about the weirdness at this point. The vibe was definitely still off, but with Chloe around I didn’t really care. I didn’t notice when people started disappearing. People do have a tendency to jump ship from these jobs but this was like poof, gone without a trace. All their stuff still in the cabins- passports, everything. Looking back now, it’s so obvious something was up. I wished I’d noticed sooner… maybe I could have done something to protect Chloe.

So, one of the people to go missing was Chloe's friend, Pippa. I didn’t really get to know her, but most of the actors hung around together and Chloe really liked her. I know fact that she just vanished was a bit strange, but like I say, people come and go from these ships all the time so I didn’t think too much about it. But Chloe was upset so I agreed to help her look into it. The really weird part was that, when we asked around, no one seemed to want to talk about it. Like, fine, people leave- but why the secrecy?

I began to get the feeling that something was seriously messed up on that ship. Chloe and I made a plan, that we’d hide some microphones in the officer’s mess hall and see if we could find anything out. Looking back now I just wish we’d left it alone. I set Chloe up with a few lav mics- they’re small but they get good range. She was supposed to plant them in the mess and then we were going to meet in one of our secret hiding spots to see what we could hear. It was all going well at first- the officers all lust after the cast, so Chloe found it really easy to talk her way in. But then things took a turn. I think one of the officers must have noticed what Chloe was doing. They all stopped talking all of a sudden, even Chloe. Two of the mics went dead immediately, but the third one was still on. I heard someone say something I couldn’t quite make out- I think Chloe must have had the mic hidden on her somewhere. But I swear it sounded like they said ‘throw her over.’

I ran to the officer’s mess, but I was too late- they were gone. I tried to follow the sounds on the mic to find her- I could hear the wind so I knew they were on deck somewhere. I must have run all over that ship. Then, suddenly, the signal went static and disappeared. Look, I’ve been a sound engineer on a ship for while, I know what it sounds like when a microphone gets wet. I think they threw Chloe overboard.

Whatever happed, she was gone. I searched the ship from top to bottom, but there was no sign of her anywhere. I reported it to my duty officer, but he totally dismissed me; said that I couldn’t accept being dumped. But I knew it was something else. I knew what I’d heard. A few days later I got a text message from Chloe’s phone. It said that she was sorry she’d left without saying anything but that she thought it was easier than going through a break up on a ship. I couldn’t believe it. It really seemed like someone was covering it up now.

I was devastated. I’d only known Chloe a short time, but she was everything to me, and now she was gone, and I felt responsible. I didn’t stay on the ship long after that. I knew I had to do something- I owed Chloe that much.

So, I went on a mission, diving head first into the dark corners of the internet, looking for anything to help me uncover the truth behind these disappearances. I’d heard about something happening on another Valerian cruise ship, about the staff rebelling. That’s when I found Lauren. Together we’ve been piecing everything together, and I think it’s bigger than we could have imagined.

It looks like the same people who own the cruise line have started this wellness retreat in Slovenia. I heard about it in one of the forums and I’ve managed to get myself hired as their sound engineer. Like I said, I don’t know what I’m going to find when I get there, but I know its not good. Hopefully Lauren and her friends can help me bring the truth to light.

I’ve got a friend running this account while I’m away (thanks, Steve!), but hopefully I’ll be able to give you guys a proper update when I’m home. I don’t know what we’re going to find at this festival, but I hope we get some answers, for Chloe if nothing else. Wish me luck- I think I’ll need it.
