Let me start of by saying that this happened a few years ago, I was 25 years old at the time and I was living alone. I had a not so great job and everyday the walk from my apartment to my job would take forever since I never learned how to drive. One day I overhears a co-worker talking about exploring the dark web.

"Dude, I'm telling you, that the place is crazy. It has a bunch of like..government information that we don't need to know about". Of course at first I didn't believe him because he usually goes outside and smokes weed so I could tell he was high at the moment, but it caught my interest. 

So I went home to my computer and sat at my desk, I was contemplating if I should actually do this. After all my co-worker also said that it could be a dangerous place. I swallowed my fear and thought "what's the worst that could happen?", I went through the process of going to the dark web and after a bunch of trials and tribulations I finally got through. 

When I got there my heart felt as if it dropped down to my intestines, my armpits felt moist, and my ears started to get itchy. I had a bad taste in my mouth and my hand was shaking a lot due to how nervous I was, but after a quick pep talk and calm breathing I dived head first into the dark web. 

When I clicked on the first link I saw it brought me to a page where the title read "Middle-Aged Women for Sale". "Wtf? Do people actually do real shit like this?" I didn't really know what else to say after seeing the website but I kept on browsing. 

That's when a navigation icon popped up on the upper right-hand side of my monitor. I didn't notice it at first because I was laser focused on the website but that's when it hit me. Before I left work my co-worker told me that they could track you the moment you're in the dark web.

I didn't know what to do or how to avoid it so I kind of shrugged it off as if nothing too bad will happen, I turned off my monitor and went to bed and after a peaceful nap I looked at the clock and it was 12:46AM. When I got up to get a snack I saw a note that was slid under the door. 

When I picked it up I read it and it said: "Michael, if you're reading this, then this is a sign of hostility. You are no longer safe inside or outside of your home." From Anonymous. My heart sunk even lower this time and I was breathing more heavily than the last time, I don't know whose behind this and I'm still nervous so I went and got double the locks installed on my apartment door.
