I heard about the massacre at the old mill while buying supplies in Heidelberg. Two pops, that's all I'd heard last night—sharp and distant like a car backfiring. Could've been gunshots. The housewives at Miller's General whispered over their canned peaches about how the police raided that Brides of Christendom compound up north. Found things. Bad things. Most of the women were killed in the firefight.

My eyes caught the newspaper rack. Thought about buying one. Didn't. World's wicked enough without paying to read about it.

The truck protested when I turned the key, coughing twice before the engine caught. I sat there, hands on the wheel, remembering what Pastor Weber said about God's justice being beyond mortal understanding. The small bag of hard candies for Hannah burned a hole in my pocket. Sugar rots both teeth and discipline, but a father provides.

Those Brides weren't right—everyone knew it. They'd drift through town in those white dresses with faces blank as china dolls, passing out pamphlets about salvation. Couldn't tell you anything concrete about what they believed in, or about the young women who joined and were never seen again. Not right at all. But murder is murder, police raid or not. The sixth commandment makes no exceptions.

I decided I’d pray for them tonight.

The drive home took me deeper into the Schwarzwald, where the roads twist like black ribbons through ancient pines. Few people come this far into the mountains. Sometimes hikers stumble across my property, straying from the Hexenweg trail that runs three kilometers east. They never stay long. Something about this part of the forest makes folks uneasy—the way the trees grow too close together, how the sunlight struggles to reach the forest floor even at midday.

My cabin sits in a natural hollow, half-hidden by the landscape. Built it myself ten years ago, when Hannah was still small enough to carry. No electricity, no phone line. Just rough-hewn logs chinked with mud and moss, a steep roof to shed the heavy mountain snows. Root cellar keeps our food from spoiling, and the stream running behind never freezes, even in the depths of winter. It's not much, but it's what the Lord provides.

It's a hard place for a child. I see that in how Hannah watches the hiking families that pass by, their children bright with store-bought clothes and easy laughter. Sometimes she stands at the window long after they've gone, fingers pressed against the glass like she's trying to hold onto their echo. But hardship builds character, and comfort breeds sin.

Hannah was waiting on the porch when I pulled up, a scarecrow figure in her hand-me-down dress. She watched me unload without offering to help, thin arms wrapped around herself against the cold. That's how she is—quiet, watchful. The doctors in town called it "developmental delays" but I know better. The Lord made her exactly as she needed to be.

We ate our dinner in silence—venison stew and hard bread. The kerosene lamp threw our shadows long against the wall, making the crucifixes dance. Hannah's eyes kept darting to the windows, now black with night. Her spoon scraped against ceramic in that way that usually earned her a stern look. Tonight, I let it pass.

The woods had been strange lately. Not wrong, exactly—God's creation can never be wrong—but different. Like the forest was holding its breath. The deer had grown scarce, birds quieter. Even the wind moved differently through the trees, making sounds that sometimes seemed almost like words.

I'd lived in these woods long enough to know their moods. Sometimes the ancient places of the world grow heavy with His presence. These deep woods are closer to God, raw and untamed as the day He made them. The settled folks in town don't understand this. They've wrapped themselves in electric lights and television static, distancing themselves from His touch. But out here, you feel the weight of creation. Some days it presses down harder than others.

The first scream came just after sunset.

It was distant, could have been an animal. But something about it raised the hair on my neck. Hannah's spoon clattered against her bowl.

"Papa," she whispered, and her voice had that same high pitch it got when she was seven and found a dead fox in the yard, its belly split open and steaming in the winter air. "What was that?"

"Could be nothing," I said, but my hand was already moving toward the rifle above the fireplace.

We waited, breaths held. Then again—distant and high-pitched. This time, it almost sounded like laughter.

I took down the hunting rifle, checking the chamber out of habit. Keep my weapons clean as scripture demands a man keep his soul.

"Stay inside. Lock the door behind me."

"Papa, please." Her voice cracked. She grabbed my sleeve with both hands, something she hadn't done since she was very small. "There's something wicked out there."

I frowned down at her. "How do you know?"

"I feel it," she insisted, her tugs becoming more urgent. "Like... like when you know a storm's coming before you see the clouds. God is warning me, deep in my tummy."

"If what you say is true," I replied, gently pulling free of her grip, "then who better to protect His realm than his most devoted servant?"

She had nothing to say to that. Truth has a way of silencing doubt.

The night air struck like a hammer of ice. Moonlight turned the forest silver-white, each tree casting a prison-bar shadow across frozen ground. My breath came in clouds as I moved between the pines, rifle ready. The woods were different at night—every shadow deeper, every sound magnified.

Another cry echoed through the trees, closer now. Could have been wind through the valleys, but wind doesn't sob like that. Through the trees, something white flickered—maybe cloth catching moonlight. But there shouldn't be anything out here. We're miles from the nearest neighbor. I know every inch of these woods like I know my prayers.

I moved closer, boots crunching on frozen leaves. More movement ahead; quick, darting. My flashlight beam caught nothing but trees and shadows. But the ground told a different story—bare footprints in the frost, small and precise like a dancer's. And something else: dark spots in the snow that could have been blood.

"Hello?" My voice sounded thin in the vast silence. "This is private property."

The woods went dead quiet. Not even wind in the trees. Just the sound of my own breathing, harsh in the stillness. My flashlight caught something hanging from a branch—a scrap of white fabric, edge stained dark. I picked it up, turned it over in my hand. Old, smelled of pine needles and something else—sweet decay, like overripe fruit.

When I reached the cabin, Hannah was standing on the porch. The kerosene lamp behind her cast her shadow long and narrow across the snow, like a crack in the earth.

"Did you shoot them, Papa?" she asked, her voice small but steady. "Did you shoot the witches?"

The question hit like a slap. "What did you say?"

Hannah shifted on her feet, looking down at her bare toes turning blue in the cold. A suspicion crossed my mind.

"Did you read the newspaper when it was delivered this morning?" The words came out sharp as icicles. "You know what I've told you about throwing them away. About not filling your head with that sort of thing."

Hannah merely shifted on her feet, looking down at her bare toes.

Disapproval pooled hot in my belly. *Lord, forgive the child her disobedience.*

That night, as we knelt for evening prayer. Hannah's hands tightened in mine as we recited the Lord's Prayer together: "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."

Her fingers felt like ice in my grip. Behind us, the windows rattled in a sudden gust of wind, and I could have sworn I heard laughter carried on the breeze—high and wild, like breaking glass.

The next day passed as most do. After breakfast—hard bread and the last of our preserved applesauce—we began Hannah's lessons. She has a quick mind when she chooses to apply it, though she's been more distant lately. Still, she worked through her multiplication tables without complaint, recited her verses from Proverbs, and copied passages from the few history books I allow in the house.

Around midday, Hannah went to tend to those goats she's so fond of. Strange creatures, they appeared during the first frost of winter, drawn perhaps by the smoke from our chimney or the scraps Hannah sometimes leaves out. Three of them, all identical with rough black coats and bright eyes. They produce no milk, bear no kids, but Hannah doted on them. I let her keep them, against my better judgment. They didn’t need much feed, preferred the sparse grass and foliage during the warmer months, and displayed a surprising level of fortitude during winter. I’d done a fool thing a few years back and slaughtered a brace of rabbits Hannah had hand-raised since they were kittens. She didn’t speak to me for months. So I let her keep the goats, lest I risk her wrath once again.

I prayed God would forgive me this one indulgent for my little girl. What better to love, than one of God’s creatures?

The rest of the day we spent on chores—splitting wood, checking the snares, preserving what little game they'd caught. We ate our dinner in familiar silence, the wind whispering through the gaps in the logs.

That night, something woke me. Perhaps a sound, perhaps just the weight of another's gaze upon my face.

I opened my eyes to find a woman staring through my window.

The moon lit her face silver-bright. She was smiling—no, her face was split by a smile, stretched impossibly wide across features that seemed to shift and flow like candlewax. Her eyes were dark hollows, reflecting nothing. Not quite human, but wearing humanity like an ill-fitting mask.

I reached for my rifle, never taking my eyes off her. When I looked back, she was gone, but I caught a flash of white disappearing into the trees.

Without thinking, I pulled on my boots and coat. The rifle was loaded—I always keep it loaded these days. Hannah stirred in her bed across the room.

"Go back to sleep," I whispered. "Papa needs to check something."

The night air bit deep. That laughter came again—high and wild, like breaking glass. There—another glimpse of white between the black trunks of the pines. I followed, my boots crunching in the fresh snow.

She vanished into the darkness ahead, leaving no footprints I could see. I was about to turn back when I heard it—a strange, huffing sound, like an animal digging. Following the noise, I pushed through a thicket of young pines into a small clearing.

There she was, illuminated by moonlight. On her hands and knees, clawing at the frozen earth like a mad thing. Her white dress was filthy now, torn and stained with soil. As she dug, she made a sound that raised the hair on my neck—a keening mixture of giggles and pants, rhythmic and desperate. Not human. Not quite.

I raised my rifle. The sound of the bolt cycling made her head snap up, and for a moment our eyes met. Then she bolted, moving with that same unnatural speed I'd seen before, vanishing between the trees like smoke.

I took a step to follow, then stopped. Something was wrong. The air had grown thick, heavy with a presence I could feel pressing against my back like a physical weight. Slowly, I turned around.

The hole drew me forward. I didn't want to approach it—everything in me screamed to run—but my feet moved of their own accord. As I drew closer, I saw the ground around it was scored with deep scratches. Dozens of fingernail marks in the frozen earth, overlapping each other. Multiple sets of hands had dug this, tearing through soil and frost with bare fingers.

I knew I shouldn't look. Knew it like I know my prayers. But I found myself leaning forward, peering into that absolute darkness.

Something looked back.

Hidden and hungry, it reached up through that hole and touched me. Not with hands or claws, but with a presence that turned my bowels to water and my legs to jelly. I soiled myself like a child, scrambling backward, my mind unable to process what I'd felt. The weight of judgment, but not God's judgment. Something older. Something that had been waiting.

I ran. Ran until my lungs burned and branches whipped my face bloody. Ran until I burst through our cabin door, waking Hannah with my panicked entrance.

"Papa?" Her voice was small, frightened. "What's wrong? What happened?"

I seized her hands, pulled her from her bed. "Pray with me," I demanded. "Pray until sunrise."

"Papa, you're hurting me—"

"Pray!"

We knelt there on the rough wooden floor, my hands gripping hers too tightly as I recited prayer after prayer. Hannah tried to ask questions but I shushed her harshly. This was more important. With each passing hour, as gray dawn crept closer, understanding bloomed in my mind like a revelation.

The white robe that woman in the woods was wearing. I'd recognized it—the same white dress those Brides of Christendom wore. The massacre at their compound hadn't been senseless violence after all. It had been divine intervention. Those women, those *things*, they had been planning something. Digging something up that should have stayed buried.

But the police, for all their guns and authority, had failed. Evil still lurked in these woods, scratching at the earth with bloody fingers. That's why God had shown me the truth. Me, who had rejected the modern world's comforts and temptations. Me, who had raised my child in righteous solitude, unwavering in my faith while others grew soft and complacent.

I alone had been chosen to finish what the authorities had started. I alone had the strength, the purity of spirit, to face this evil. My years of devotion had led to this moment—this divine purpose.

"Papa," Hannah whispered as the first light touched our windows. "You're crying."

I touched my cheek, felt wetness there*. Tears of joy,* I assured her.

It gets fuzzy after that.

Days bled into one another after that night. I tried to keep them clear in my head, but my thoughts were muddled, my mind consumed with this one task I now held above all else. Hannah's lessons went untaught, the snares unchecked. A necessary sacrifice I knew that, with time, she would understand. Greater things were at play, terrible consequences to be had were I not to follow through with my purpose.

I spent my days lost in scripture, finding echoes of myself in Moses and Elijah. At night, I would prowl through the obsidian forest, listening for fingers scratching against frozen earth or that gurgling, hitching laughter. I'd only return when dawn threatened the horizon—certain, somehow, that this evil was a creature of darkness.

Time meant nothing. How could it, when I stood on the cusp of such glory?

I'd hear Hannah in the morning, stoking the fire, stretching our meager supplies into something like breakfast. Her movements grew slower each day, her frame more fragile, but my mind was elsewhere—replaying that night's vision, seeing that terrible hole in every shadow, every dark corner.

"Papa, we need food," she'd say, her voice getting smaller, more careful with each passing day. She held up our last jar of preserves like it was evidence at a trial. "The root cellar's almost empty."

"God provides for His chosen ones," I'd reply, running my hand along my rifle's barrel for the hundredth time that hour. "Remember how He fed the Israelites in the desert? Trust in His providence."

And wasn't I proved right when Hannah would return from her daily wanderings, apron heavy with blackberries, dirty hands cupping pale mushrooms like offerings? See how He provides, I'd tell her, though she'd just stare at me with those huge, hollow eyes.

‘See?’ I would tell her, ‘see how He provides for us?’

By the end of the first week, sleep became a distant memory. Each night, I'd pace our small cabin, muttering prayers and checking my rifle, waiting for darkness to fall so I could resume my sacred hunt. Sometimes I caught Hannah watching me, her face gaunt in the lamplight. The weight of her silence felt like judgment, and that judgment kindled something hot and dangerous in my chest.

One night, deep in the woods and parched from hours of searching, I stopped to drink from a still pond. Moonlight turned the water's surface to mirror-glass. As I bent to drink, I saw them—great wings of silver-white spreading from my shoulders, shimmering with holy purpose. I was transfigured, become an angel of judgment.

The vision filled me with righteous fire. I spent hours at my prayers now, my voice growing hoarse as I thanked God for choosing me, for showing me His divine purpose. Hannah would kneel beside me, trembling with what I took for religious fervor, though now I wonder if it was simply hunger or fear.

"Papa," she said one morning, her small hands clutching at my sleeve like a drowning person grabbing for rope, "the goats are acting strange. They followed you last night. I saw them from the window."

"Of course they did," I replied, stroking her hair with magnanimous affection. "I am their shepherd, as Christ is mine. Did He not say 'My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me'?"

"But there's something wrong with them. They’re not normal. They haven’t eaten in weeks, we’ve no grass, but they’re growing all fat—"

I silenced her with a kiss atop her head, though her high-pitched voice had begun to grate like fingernails on slate.

‘I’ll be back before dawn,” I promised her, and left.

The goats accompanied me most nights now, their black forms moving like shadows between the trees. Sometimes I would preach to them as we walked, explaining my holy mission. They would listen with tilted heads, their rectangular pupils reflecting the moonlight like tiny golden crosses.

Ten days in, I stopped reading scripture altogether. What need had I for ancient words when God spoke to me directly now? I could feel His presence in every rustle of wind through the pines, every crunch of snow beneath my boots. The woods themselves seemed to whisper their approval of my quest.

Hannah grew more insistent, more troublesome. One morning, I found her trying to pack a bag with our few remaining possessions.

"What are you doing?" I demanded.

"We need help, Papa," she whispered. "You're not well. Pastor Weber would understand—"

I struck the bag from her hands, sending our last precious cup of flour spilling across the floor. "Pastor Weber is a blind fool who coddles his flock with soft words and softer doctrine. God has chosen me for this task, me alone!"

She flinched away from my rage, and something in her retreat sent a thrill through me. Yes, fear was appropriate. Respect. Long had it been absent.

Two weeks slid by like shadows on a sundial, slow and steady, each night punctuated by the same ritual. Hannah and I knelt together in prayer, her voice a timid echo of my own as we sought meaning, affirmation—proof that my faith was not only righteous but ordained. My faith was the kind of faith that burned, fierce and hot, devouring any doubts before they had time to fester. But tonight, something shifted.

She opened the Bible—*my* Bible—without so much as a glance for permission. Her fingers trembled, but her voice held a strange steeliness. "Proverbs 16:18," she said, the words tight in her throat like they didn’t want to come out. Then she read them aloud: *'Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.'*

I stared at her. It took a few long seconds for the weight of the verse to press down, like a stone balanced on my chest.

“Is there something you want to say, Hannah?” My voice was calm, almost gentle. Too calm.

Her eyes met mine, unflinching. Hard. Older than they had any right to be. “I miss you, papa” she whispered. “I fear for your soul.”

The words hit like a gut punch. For the first time in weeks—months, maybe—I felt it: doubt. It slid into me like a slick, oily serpent, winding its way through the cracks of my certainty.

And then came the rage. Hot, sharp, and purifying.

I snatched the Bible from her hands, the leather binding creaking in protest. “How *dare* you?” I heard myself say, as though from some great distance. “You think you know better than me? Better than *Him*? I have been *chosen*, Hannah. *Chosen*. I have seen His glory with my own eyes. And you dare to question me?”

Her lip trembled.

“You haven’t been chosen!” she cried, her voice pitching with childlike terror. “You’re arrogant, and vain, and mean and I—I *hate* you!”

I erupted to my feet, hand raised to strike her, but she was already moving.

She bolted for the door, her bare feet slapping against the wooden floorboards.

“Hannah!” I shouted, but she didn’t stop.

The door slammed behind her. I lunged for the handle only to hear the scrape of wood—she was wedging something under the knob from outside.

For a moment, just a moment, I stood there, panting, hand frozen mid-air. On the other side of the door, I could hear her breathing, quick and shallow. Fearful.

"I'll do it myself!" she screamed through the door, her voice cracking with terror and determination. "Whatever's out there, I'll be the one to stop it! Then you'll have nothing left!"

"Hannah!" I slammed my palm against the door. When she didn't answer, I forced my voice calmer. "Hannah, let me out."

I heard her breathing hitch on the other side.

‘You’ll be okay,” she said. “You’ll come back, once it’s done.”

"HANNAH!" Terror laced through my veins like ice. She couldn't. It was *mine*, *my* destiny, *my* duty. I hauled back and kicked the door, my leg jarring against solid oak. I heard her sharp cry, her receding footsteps. Toward the woods. Off to steal what was rightfully *mine*.

The axe leaned in its place by the fireplace, its handle smooth from years of use. I took it in hand, its weight steadying me. She had no right. None. No child could understand the burden I carried, the divine purpose that coursed through my veins like fire.

I swung. The first blow sent cracks spidering through the wood. The second showered splinters across the floor. Through the jagged hole, I saw her—a ghostly blur in her white nightgown, vanishing into the treeline.

Through the jagged remains, I saw her. Her white nightgown was a ghostly blur, vanishing into the line of trees beyond the yard. She moved fast—faster than I’d thought she could—but I was faster.

The axe fell from my fingers. I reached for the rifle above the mantle instead. A shepherd's crook for a shepherd's duty. I wouldn't let her defy me. Not like this.

The cold bit at my lungs as I hurtled through the night, breath steaming, the rifle steady in my hands. The trees swallowed her up, but I could hear her—branches snapping, undergrowth rustling. Each crack of a twig was like a beacon calling me onward.

Behind me came another sound, familiar. The goats were following, their hooves striking the frozen ground with a deliberate rhythm. Not just footsteps—a cadence, a beat that matched my pulse. Their soft bleating rose, but it wasn't the plaintive call of livestock. It sounded like laughter, low and mocking, as if they understood more than they should.

Their soft bleating rose, but it wasn’t the plaintive call of livestock. No, it was something else entirely. It sounded almost like laughter, low and mocking, as if they understood more than they should.

Ahead, the moonlight spilled through the canopy, and I swore I saw it: the glimmer of her nightgown, the flash of her small, pale face. She wouldn’t get far. Not from me.

My angel wings—His angel wings—spread wide, their shadow stretching across the frostbitten ground. The forest loomed, dark and waiting, as I chased my wayward lamb into its depths.

And then, I saw her.

Hannah knelt in a clearing, her nightgown stark against the black earth. Her hands clawed at the frozen ground, raw and bloodied as she scraped at the edges of that blessed chasm. Somehow, she had found it—as though it had been waiting, ready all this time. My chasm. My purpose. The culmination of everything I had sacrificed.

“STOP!” The word ripped from my throat, and I levelled the rifle at her narrow back. She froze, her trembling frame caught in the silver light of the moon.

“This isn’t for you,” I said, stepping closer. “It’s mine. This was meant for me.”

She didn’t turn around. Her voice, when it came, was small. “Papa… I can feel it. The wrongness. It’s in the air. It’s in *you*.”

The rifle rose, the weight of it steady in my grip. I pointed it at her, at my daughter—my lamb turned defiant wolf. “Step away from the hole. Now.”

She stood slowly, her small figure pale and fragile in the moonlight. The snow clung to her nightgown, turning it to rags, but she didn't shiver. Behind her, the goats gathered, their burning eyes locked on me. Their mouths hung open, jowls pulled back from stained yellow teeth in strange grins.

I edged closer, the rifle trained on Hannah’s heart. The chasm yawned before me, its edges jagged and dark, the void within pulsing like a hungry, open mouth. From its depths came a whisper, low and syrupy, coiling around my mind.

*^(How big and juicy you’ve gotten,)* it said. *^(How fat and swollen. Are you here to stop me, Thomas?)*

“Yes,” I panted, heart thudding in my chest. “As only I can.”

^(But of course,) the voice crooned. ^(Nobody is as strong as you. Nobody as smart, or as devoted. This is why God chose you.)

I couldn’t help it. The words were a balm to my cracked soul, sweeter than honey. “Yes,” I whispered, the rifle trembling in my hands. “Yes, yes that’s right.’

^(How proud you must be.)

And I was. Pride swelled inside of me, so much of if I felt like I might burst—

A cry tore from my throat as a weight struck my back. Hannah's small body slammed into me with all the force she could muster, and I stumbled, my boots skidding on the loose earth at the edge of the chasm.

I teetered there, the rifle slipping from my grasp as my boots lost purchase, the brittle edge crumbling beneath me. For one awful moment, I was weightless, plunging into the scorching maw of the void—but my hands shot out, snagging the rim just before I disappeared entirely. My fingers dug into the frozen earth, nails splintering as the ground shifted under my grip. Below me, the abyss boiled with unnatural heat, a blistering force that pressed against my skin, alive and ravenous, dragging at me as though it had been waiting for this moment.

 “Hannah!” My voice cracked. “Help me! Please. I’m your father.”

She stood over me, silhouetted by the moonlight, her face streaked with tears that gleamed like silver as they froze on her cheeks. “You taught me to listen to God’s voice,” she said, her words faltering but resolute. “But you stopped listening a long time ago.”

“Hannah—” My grip was failing, the earth crumbling beneath my fingers.

She lowered her head, her voice trembling as she spoke our prayer: “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.”

I choked on my breath, the weight of my own words thrown back at me. “You’re wrong. You’re wrong!” My voice rose to a scream. “I am your father! I am chosen! I am—”

Her foot came down on my fingers.

The pain was white-hot, a searing betrayal. My grip gave way, and I plunged into the darkness.

As I fell, the last thing I saw were the goats, silhouetted by the moon, peering over the edge at me. And Hannah, my lamb, standing tall as she watched me go.

My final thought was bitter and sharp, cutting through the blackness: *At least I fell like Lucifer—defiant, proud, until* [the end](https://www.reddit.com/user/lemonsorbetstan/comments/1hbq68e/the_brides_of_christendom/)*.*
