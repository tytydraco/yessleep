Hi my new coach gave me a strange set of rules for my new hockey team I asked my friends who have been on the team and they do not recognize the rules.

 Hello, I'm Coach Nathan, and I congratulate you for making the team. Here's a list of the rules you NEED to follow in order to have a safe and enjoyable experience.

1. Dont talk to Isac or he will get angry. You wont like it when he is angry. 

2. When you arrive at the arena 1 hour early go to dressing room 3 leave a piece raw steak to satisfy him fail to do so, and you might get dropped from the team you don't want that. Its more painful than you think.
2-a If you enter any other room you will let them out, we DO NOT want them to be let out. Find the closest object to kill yourself with because what they will do to you is much worse.

3.After leaving the steak in front of the door, return after 15 minutes. Politely greet your team mates everyone except for Isac of course. Make sure to sit in the far corner of the room. Quickly change into your workout gear. You will hear screams in the shower pay no attention that's just Gary. Don't try to see Gary or you will end up like Gary.
3-a If you enter and your spot is taken calmly exit the room and enter again. If the twins are not sitting next to each other, please correct them if you fail to do so the team will have extra laps. YOU NEED THE TEAM TO LIKE YOU.
 
4. After your warm up start getting dressed I will be waiting for you in the dressing room if I am wearing our teams signature red and blue colors, then its me if I am wearing any other colors its not me RUN.
 
5. When you see what appears to be a furry hockey bag, don't touch it. He is the team mascot get close he will growl get to close and he will bite.

6. Aiden will be playing music if it suddenly switches to what sounds like demonic chanting the mascot will start growling ask Aiden to change the song if he refuses quickly alert me, I will be on the bench outside the dressing room. If I am not there smash the speaker, its better to take your chances with the team than to try and deal with him.

7. During practice do not be last for anything, you will be TRAPPED.

8. If somebody offers you there water do not drink it. Its not water

9. When shooting hit the net or there will be dire consequences. If you shoot on Isac do not hit his head. If you hit his head, immediately try to find me. I might be able to calm him down.

10. The assistant coaches might look differentÂ (no eyes limbs bent backwards extremely tall) address them like you would me and do not comment on their features they don't like that.

11. Don't be last off the ice. Don't be last when leaving the dressing room. Please leave before 10:30 pm or you will be trapped with it and it will make a mess we dont like to clean.

12. In case I ask you to stay beyond 10:30 
do not listen it is a trap.

If you follow these rules, we will have a year full of fun, keep in mind that these rules only apply to the practices. Mist importantly have fun :)

Iam freaking out why do the coaches look like that? What is the water then? What are they and what is it? What is happening to Gary? My first practice is tomorrow wish me luck.
