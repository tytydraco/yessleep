live in an area consisting of residential blocks that lack parking spaces. One morning, after picking up some household supplies that my mother had asked for, along with a gas cylinder for heating due to the winter cold, I was driving back to my neighborhood, lost in thought about something strange. My friend had told me about an unusual experience he had, and I had convinced him to seek psychological treatment from a European charity center.

We live in an area full of conflicts that can cause immense psychological pressure, which may lead to hallucinations. At first, I was convinced that what he saw was a jinn—since in my culture, we believe strongly in their existence and influence. However, after asking him a few questions, I learned that he was taking sleeping pills. That’s when I realized it was likely a psychological issue rather than something supernatural. I urged him to seek help from specialists, and after that, I didn’t think much about it—I had many other responsibilities, especially since my father was away on a business trip.

When I arrived in my neighborhood, I couldn’t find a suitable parking space, so I had to leave my car two streets away. The distance wasn’t too far, but the real challenge was that my neighborhood was on a mountain. I took the lighter items with me and left the gas cylinder in the car since it was too heavy to carry up the hill.

Once home, I greeted my mother with a kiss on her forehead, placed the items on the kitchen table, and went to my room. Electrical engineering requires a lot of study time, and I had a backlog of material to review. Unlike most nights, the weather was cold, rainy, and gloomy. I sat by my window, staring outside. The alley, usually bustling with people, was completely empty—probably because people preferred to stay indoors during the winter.

Hours passed, and at around 11:00 PM—early for me, though most of my countrymen were already asleep—my mother came to my room and asked me about the spare gas cylinder, as our heating had gone out. At that moment, I realized that I had forgotten it in the car like an idiot, simply because I hadn’t wanted to carry it up the hill.

I quickly put on my jacket and rushed out for two reasons: first, because leaving a gas cylinder in the car was dangerous, and second, because I wanted to move the car closer to our building in case a parking spot had opened up. The night air was unusual—light rain and fog drifted through the streets as I walked. When I reached the car, I got in, adjusted the mirrors, and drove toward my building.

To my surprise, when I arrived, there were only two cars in the alley—far fewer than usual. I parked, secured the car carefully due to the increasing thefts in the area, and retrieved the gas cylinder. Just as I was about to leave, I saw something at the end of the alley, about 15 meters away.

He was black, towering at about 2.3 meters tall. He resembled a human, but he was not human. His face was unclear, as if masked, and his eyes pierced directly into my soul. He stood completely still.

It was exactly as my friend had described.

I froze, an indescribable fear taking hold of me. My heart pounded, and my cold hands trembled. Time felt as if it had stopped. I turned around, hoping to find someone—anyone—who could help me. But there was no one.

I felt weak, helpless. My mind raced, searching for a solution, but I couldn’t think of anything better than grabbing the gas cylinder and running as fast as I could.

As I sprinted toward my building, I felt something chasing me. I didn’t dare look back. I reached the entrance, slammed the door shut, and bolted it. Then, I ran inside and dropped the gas cylinder onto my foot by accident, causing a metatarsal injury.

I locked our house door, gasping for breath. A mix of fear and relief overcame me, and I found myself crying. Ignoring the pain in my foot—possibly broken—I rushed to the window overlooking the alley.

The street was empty. Silent.

Only the sound of rain remained.

Since that night, I have felt like I am being watched.
