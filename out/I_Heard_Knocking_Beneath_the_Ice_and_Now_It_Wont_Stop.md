I grew up in a snow-blanketed town where winter stretched endlessly. Hollow Lake was the centerpiece of our small community, but no one treated it like a tourist attraction. It wasn’t a place to skate or fish; it was a place to avoid.

The lake wasn’t just frozen—it was wrong. People said it swallowed sound. No wind rippled its surface, no birds perched on its banks, and the snow around it always seemed untouched, even on the busiest days. Kids in town whispered about it endlessly. The rule was simple: Never walk on Hollow Lake after dark.

I thought it was just one of those stories parents told to keep us in line. Until last winter.

It was late December, and my friend Jake dared me to cross the lake. We were teenagers, bored, and fueled by cheap whiskey we’d stolen from his dad. The storm had settled, leaving the sky clear and the moonlight bright enough to reflect off the lake’s surface like a giant mirror.

“You’re not scared, are you?” Jake asked, smirking.

“Of a lake?” I laughed, stomping out onto the ice before he could finish the dare. My boots crunched against the frost, and for a moment, everything seemed normal. But as I got farther from the shore, the air grew… heavier. The kind of stillness that makes your ears ring. I stopped in the middle of the lake, turning to wave at Jake.

That’s when I heard it.

A faint hum, coming from below.

At first, I thought it was my imagination. But then the hum turned into a scrape, like claws dragging against the underside of the ice. I froze, staring down at the surface. The moonlight reflected perfectly, but something beneath the ice shifted.

“Jake?” I called, my voice cracking.

“Don’t screw with me,” he shouted back from the shore.

The scraping grew louder, deliberate. Then came the knocking.

Three sharp, deliberate raps.

I staggered back, slipping on the ice, as a shadow moved beneath me. It wasn’t human. Too long, too thin. Its limbs bent unnaturally, and its head twisted upward.

A face pressed against the ice—a pale, hollow face with black pits for eyes. Its mouth stretched wide, filled with teeth that looked like shards of ice. It grinned at me, raised a bony hand, and knocked again.

The ice cracked beneath my feet.

I ran, the ice groaning and splitting with every step. Behind me, the knocking grew louder, faster, echoing in my ears like a heartbeat.

When I reached the shore, Jake was gone. His footprints were erased, as if he’d never been there.

I screamed his name, but the sound was swallowed by the lake’s silence.

The town searched for Jake for weeks, but there was nothing. They said the storm must have taken him. I didn’t argue. I didn’t want them to think I was crazy.

But I know what I saw.

It’s been a year now, and Hollow Lake is frozen again. Last night, as I lay in bed, I heard it—the sound.

Three deliberate knocks.

I stayed perfectly still, clutching my blanket, praying it was my imagination. But when I woke up this morning, there were wet footprints leading from the lake to my bedroom window.

And on the frost of the glass, written in jagged letters, were two words: “Come back.”
