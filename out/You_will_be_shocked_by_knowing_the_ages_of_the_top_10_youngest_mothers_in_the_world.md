Motherhood is a blessing for matures and a boon for the underage.

They often say it’s a miracle gifted to women, but it indeed becomes a burden when a tiny Lil girl becomes a mother. So basically, when the other girls were busy studying, growing, playing, and innovating, these early-aged mothers were forced to undertake responsibilities they weren’t even sure of. Well, this is surely not a normal childhood; any mother aspires to weave for their daughters. 

Taking you to the whereabouts, generally, children attain puberty, i.e., to reach sexual maturity and become ready to reproduce, between the age of 10 to 16. Among girls, it includes breast development, growth of acne, menstruation, growth of pubic hair, etc. Among boys, it involves enlargement of the testicles and penis, growth of facial hair, pubic hair, etc. 

However, in certain rare cases, children under the age of 8 (for females) or 9 (for males) tend to attain puberty. Such a condition is called precocious puberty. It can be caused due to various reasons, such as hormone disorders, infections, tumours, etc. 

Here is the list of the top 10 youngest mothers in the world who attained precocious puberty and became the youngest mothers in history.

1) Lina Medina gave birth to her son on May 14, 1939, when she was just five years, seven months, and 21 days old, becoming one of the top 10 youngest mothers ever in history. The son was delivered with a cesarean section and weighed 2.7 kg at birth. He was named ‘Gerardo’, after Lina’s doctor.

As per Peruvian law, Lina Medina’s pregnancy at that age meant that she was raped even before she had turned five. The identity of her father or the circumstances of her rape was never revealed. Her father was suspected of child abuse and arrested but was later released due to a lack of evidence. 

Lina went on to marry her husband, Raul Jurado, in the 1970s and gave birth to her second son. Lina is 88 years old now and is said to live a quiet life in Peru. Concludingly, motherhood did not come as a blessing for these young mothers who didn’t even have the time to explore their own lives. They were forced to suffer through the trauma of rape, then the pains of pregnancy, and then (in most cases) the responsibility of nursing the child.

2) Yelizaveta “Liza” Gryshchenko, five days after turning six, gave birth to her baby girl on August 19, 1934, and became one of the youngest mothers on the planet. Her baby was delivered naturally, weighing 3 kgs; however, stillborn.  
Her parents had refused to deliver the baby with a cesarean section, which was considered dangerous then. The doctors claimed that the baby would have been born healthily had she been extracted more quickly, reanimated, and oxygenated. 

Regarding the child’s father, It was revealed that “Liza” had been raped by her own maternal grandfather, aged 69. He was a former sailor. After the incident, Liza’s family emigrated to Vladivostok, Russia, to escape embarrassment. They also took the maternal grandfather along with them. The Current whereabouts or whether Liza is alive or not is unknown.
