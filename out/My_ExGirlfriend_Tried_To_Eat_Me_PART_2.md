[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j6fsuv/my_exgirlfriend_tried_to_eat_me_part_1/)

To say that I was disturbed by my find last night would be an understatement. I dialed for the police the second I had found the salad in my fridge and waited with a knife for them to arrive at my doorstep. Constantly checking over my shoulder out of fear that Julia would be standing right there. Smiling as gay as beaming sunlight without a hint of malice on her face.

I couldn’t tell if it was weird that I was more frightened of Julia simply being normal. Unbothered by the events of the previous day. Even offering some of my favourite foods in the fridge, ready to eat. An odd contrast to the sick token that marked her stay in my home.

I now stood on the threshold of my home. Answering questions as one of the two officers searched through the house. Inspecting cupboards, shelves and objects with careful wariness. All the while his partner bombarded me with questions regarding my ex.

“Has this happened before?”

“No.”

“Was anything stolen?”

“No.”.

With my whirlpool of muddled thoughts still fizzing from the night's events I barely noticed as the second officer walked up behind us. Rejoining his companion by the car, bearing a mute expression on his lips and exchanging a silent stare with his partner. A quick glance that was soon reorientated in my direction.

“What did you say the suspect's name was again?” He asked with almost pained indifference on his tongue.

“Julia Lilitu.” As he prattled off more questions the cop beside him fumbled for a notepad, jotting things down with quick, decisive scribbles. 

Of the two officers the one currently asking the questions was more well put together with a narrow, angular face. Sporting a pair of burning eyes that carved through me with careful precision.

His friend was less managed, pudgier with a large horse brush moustache and a sparkling pair of circular glasses perched atop his plump nose. I didn’t take in his full form. The wiry man that stood at his side was already trying to wring as much information out of me as he could. Clearly wanting to return without any further effort.

“And she’s your girlfriend?” The way he said that question indicated that he already had a second one primed and ready.

“Was,” I corrected swiftly, frustration rising in my throat.

“Of three years?”

“Yes.” I retorted without pause, almost snapping at him which I quickly realised was a mistake. Watching him lower his eyes and stare at me with pursed lips. Casting his sideways gaze at my front door that still stood slightly ajar.

“Awful long time to spend with someone without sharing a place…” There was a note of allegation to his words that stung on the cold winter air like a dull blade. I felt a sudden flush of crimson shame burning through my neck and shoulders. Blooming in waves across my face. The answer they were after was one that I wasn’t too keen on divulging.

“We… We were discussing moving in.” His eyebrows arched in a half measure between confusion and surprise.

“Discussing?” He asked with a bemused twinge in his lungs. Beckoning me to continue.

“Before we broke up.” I nodded, trying to affirm my own admission of events. The sometimes days-long conversations that Julia would prompt me forward in. Urging and prying responses from me as if they were treasured jewels. All whenever I was doing washing, cooking or working. The conversations had often fallen into the pit of being one sided with Julia taking it upon herself to speak ideas aloud.

The police exchanged a final glance and nodded before the wiry man with the thin face turned his attention back to me.

“Alright, the photos and salad are the only physical evidence we could find and we’ll need time to check for any DNA evidence.” He looked behind me, eyes watching the door with such intensity that I thought that someone may have been there. Vague foggy pictures of Julia’s silhouette hovering at the threshold. Grinning down at my back as she stared at me behind dark lashes. The notion stabbed at my back with a ghostly grace. 

The officer had continued talking to me as my mind wandered ever further into the tightening memories and daydreams that stuck in my peripheral ever since the night prior. The only things that I had been able to retain were that he suggested I stay at a friend's place and get my locks changed. Both ideas that I dutifully decided to follow. Or as dutifully as I was able.

Contacting a good locksmith wouldn’t be too much hassle. It was finding a place I could stay until Julia lost interest that was the hard part.

How was I supposed to know what she would decide to do next? She had always been off putting and unusual but before last night I would never have imagined her to break into my home.

Plus I didn’t want to even consider roping any of our friends into this. I thought that I’d known her but now I couldn’t take the risk that she may escalate whatever endeavours she had planned. It would be too much if someone I cared about got hurt because of my own stupidity.

With one final bow of thanks towards the officer I reentered my abode. The thick air within my now disturbed home crawled across my tongue with every breath. A sick rising sensation started to grow within my stomach and I had to steady my breathing, long and deep to prevent myself from vomiting.

I felt as though I was walking along the ceiling and all the liquids inside me were being sucked out to the earth. It was wholly unpleasant and I couldn’t stand the sensation for long. I quickly collected my coat, keys, a change of clothes and some other various knick knacks I felt appropriate before escaping out the front door. 

Stopping by the door of my car I stumbled and dropped my keys. Clattering against the pavement. I sighed briefly and started to kneel down to collect them. Fallen leaves crunching against my weight. However, as I touched the ice cold metal a single flicker of faint motion caused me to tense up. An almost silent shuffling against the cement ground and a tiny discolouration that was a long thin strand of black hair. The single piece of string shifted before pulling itself back behind the wheels.

I was completely overcome with terror. My mind already racing to a single, horrifying conclusion. It was her, she was under the car and she’d been watching me the whole time. I took a step back and nearly slid into the pavement. Catching both my fall and scream.

Crouching on the ground I felt a new emotion overcome me. A boiling heat that bloomed across my cheeks and forehead. A grinding of teeth against tooth, twitching in my upper lip and a furrowed brow.

I was being stupid. If she was here then I could certainly overpower her. Snap some sense into her or at least scare her so she’d leave me alone. It was a brave thought that poured temporary confidence into my boots. Confidence that all but dissipated as I kneeled down to peer beneath the car and was left to gaze at the sight that beheld me.

Nothing. No one had been there. Surely I hadn't been seeing things. A flickering line that precise wasn’t something I would mistake. I knew the difference between hair and… and whatever I had seen.

But the more I thought about it, the more I realised I needed to calm my nerves. If I was this on edge then I wouldn’t be able to figure all this shit out without panicking and doing something stupid.

Brushing my brief lack of lucidity out of my mind. I clambered into my car with all the grace of a drunken gorilla and started to drive off down the street. Casting long glances over my shoulder, into the backseat and to the chair beside me. At any point expecting Julia to simply exist where she had always sat. Smiling at me with malignant ecstasy that made my back ache with a throbbing need. All while my heart was tightly wound to a near lethal pressure.



“Yeah, sure Liam. Make sure to say hi to your ma for us!” That was Will. I had needed to clock off work and cash out my leave for the next two weeks so that I could drop off the radar for a bit until things with Julia cooled down.

Will was a good man. He was my boss but he acted more like a close uncle than a superior at the electronics store where I worked. It was an odd relationship we shared given our close age but the strange elder role he took up in my life.

“Thank’s Will, I knew you’d get this. Sorry I have to head out for a bit.” A snort on the other end of the phone call brought a smile to my face as I rounded the corner of the next turn. Letting the man with the thick accent keep talking. There was something about his inflection that set my mind at ease.

“Nah! Don’t worry bout it! You’ve put in a lot of good work for us. You deserve a break!” He was a bad liar. I could have put more work in but I could make it up to him once Julia was firmly out of the realm of threatening me. He didn’t need to worry about that either. I could take care of myself.

“Oh by the way, how's things with that latin girl you were dating?” The car hissed to a halt as I kicked the brakes with such ferocity my car bucked from the momentum. I felt that my body had been doused with chilled water and then was forced to sit in the cold pool that washed across the leather of my seat. But even in that cold thrash of reality and the screeching groan of skidding rubber my boss had continued. His next words made my pupils shrink inside my widening golf ball eyes.

“I wasn’t sure given that she came round earlier.” My fingers slinked further around the steering wheel. The skin pressing against my bones and forcing the blood out of my fingers. I couldn’t fathom Julia talking to Will. They’d never spoken much but were always polite to each other and were still capable of making small talk. But the woman who’d broken into my home talking to my boss without my knowledge was deeply disturbing.

“W-what did she say to you?” I inquired, trying to keep a casual demeanour as I started pushing my car further into the highway. A pause before he continued.

“Not much to be honest. She asked about you mostly. Said something about planning something special for the pair of you later this week.” My heart started to sink with every passing word.

“She seemed pretty ecstatic about whatever it was. I'll tell you what though. You’re a lucky man! I’d kill to have a woman like that!” I nearly rear ended the guy in front of me as his words left a stinging pain behind my eyes. My face contorted as I bit my tongue and held myself back from sharing what had happened.

I knew I could deal with this problem without his input. 

“Thanks.” I murmured back halfheartedly. This was bad. Something special later in the week? What could she possibly have been talking about? A saturating sense of dread crept along my back as I continued to push forward in the car. Giving one final cough of thanks to Will before hanging up. I needed to focus on the drive and getting out of this city for a bit. I didn’t want to chance bumping into Julia.

Unfortunately my plans of an expeditious retreat were wounded thanks to the roadworks and a glut of traffic that clogged the veins of this city. Poisoning it with a strange slowness that was grating the pores on my skin with a slow itch.

I was forced to sit still for hours on end. The heat of the day beginning to marinate through the car's interior and wring all the moisture out of my body. Claws that wrapped around my neck and left its chafing marks along my boiled skin. This feeling of being suffocated by the dry air was only furthered by the sense of being watched. Turning my head back around and peering into the windows of other cars trapped alongside me. It was the worst feeling in the world. To think that anyone of these vehicles could be owned by Julia. But among the cars that crawled past there was one that had particularly caught my eye.

A cherry red ford mustang with deep black tinted windows. Sitting firmly in its place two cars behind my own in an adjacent lane. I knew that Julia had a car like that. One that had been a gift from her father. Or so I’d been told.

I’d never met her family, she told me that they had passed away when she was younger and had practically been forced to raise herself. It was certainly something I could believe.

Sitting there in that smoking hot matchbox of a car I had drifted into the past once more. Reminiscing what Julia had been like when I first met her. She had been in college while I had gone into a trade. 

Working at a small local diner that reeked of butter, fried bread and oil. Bathed in a perpetual glow of golden sunlight that streamed along the checkered tiles. Always at the same time and always casting the woman of my dreams in a halo of warmth.

Smiling down at me wearing her loose blouse and tight leather jean shorts. Her hair was done up so that it was out of her face. Giving me a full view of her cloudy, hazel almond eyes that steamed with desire and vivacity.

From those first brief exchanges there had always been a crackle of energy. One that always travelled with us to the bedroom. The crack of leather and contorting of limbs. Silky bindings that had enraptured my hands and legs. She was someone who I could trust to take control. To put my own safety into the hands of someone else and to know what they are going to do was something I found so appealing.

Yet now that appeal and the sweet flavours that had washed through my body in those brief moments of vulnerability had become tainted. Slowly at first with more exposure, stranger desires and the elaborate displays that we had grown to share. Then finally the break in.

I couldn’t keep lingering on that nightmarish space that had become my home. Instead turning my eyes forward. Still painfully aware of the cherry coloured car. Incapable of discerning it as a pursuer.



By the time I had reached a cheap motel on the edge of the city I was more than worn out. My body had been wrung out of all its energy and motivation to continue my journey upstate. An arduous trek that I had only begun to grapple with and was beginning to realise that I was likely unprepared for. Not for any particular reason, more a home sick feeling that was beginning to lodge in my grey matter. Strange now that memories of home were filtered through that omnipresent visage of my ex’s voice.

“Morning Miel,”

“How are you Miel?”

“Are you feeling good today Miel?”

Disgustingly sweet words that slid down my sticky, sweat stained skin. Stop it, stop it. I kept chanting to myself within my headspace. Trying to halt my dazed repetition of things I used to hold dear as I collected my keys and meandered to my room. Stumbling through the door and falling across the bed with my arms out and face buried between the sheets.

Breathing heavily into them and letting my warm breath cloak my face I let my body warm into a comfortable state of paralysis.

I didn’t move for a long time after that. Tired out by the day as the sun had started to eclipse the concrete and glass monoliths of home. It was a moment where I wished for nothing more than to sink into the furniture I lay upon and cease to feel any of these thoughts that had plagued my journey. The lust, the desire, the fantasies and the horrors. I wanted none of it. I mean it.

It took a great deal of effort to pry myself off those sweat stained sheets so that I could wash up and change before bed. I could keep driving tomorrow and just take the time that I needed.

It was a pleasant thought. One that soothed my aching back as I lay down to sleep. The sickly yellow tint that touched the popcorn textured walls waning shades as the ceiling light flickered. The still corners of the room almost bending up around me and tightening into a bundle that held me in place.

Yet even within that cradle of quiet there was only one thing that shifted in the muddled light. The corner of the blinds that cloaked the dark pool that submerged my room. Pushing up against the door with a tightness that threatened at any point to fracture the glass and wash into my room. But I was safe with that sheet of thin cloth holding my worries at bay. Fluttering in a hypnotic loop that lulled me into a peaceful, resting sleep.



My eyes snapped open through foggy lids and I felt myself spasm with discomfort. I had no clue how long I had been asleep for. The room was dark and I needed to wait several minutes, laying on my back and waiting for the shapes to come into focus. Being aided only through the bathroom light that carved its way along the ground in a thin line.

I continued to stay perfectly still, my chest rising and falling with my breath before I felt my mind recoil at a crackling hiss and the television at the foot of my bed sparked to life.

Oddly enough I found myself unable to lift my neck and instead watched the program at the bottom of my eyes. It was a nature documentary, one from the late 80s judging by the film grain, colour grading and voice over that chirped to life. A strangely restrained murmur that coughed out every word. Talking over the image of two birds with their long winding necks intertwined. A pair of courting swans. “... and here we have the cygnus swan. Uncommon among birds, swans are known to mate for life, forming an inseparable bond that carries into death. With swans even grieving the partners they lose…” It kept going. A drawling weight in his lungs that made me feel distinctly uncomfortable. Watching that old tv program in the dead of night.

But when I tried to move my arms I could barely muster the strength. Instead only shifting my fingers that were flooded with a dull weight and a peculiar pressure at my wrists. I was trapped, stuck with all the power of a fly in a glue trap.

Panic was something that came naturally. But instead of a shot that would have given me a boost to throw myself from the bed and silence that infernal blaring noise that continued to repeat on screen. I was offered a measly cough and lurch before returning to my place on the bed. Groggy, weak and dazed. 

“Have you slept well?” The gentle chorus of her words glazed my near naked body with a tenderness that disturbed me. I would have screamed if the energy was given to me. But I could still see her. A black silhouette that stood in the frame of the bathroom. Detail all but abandoned from her outline of negative space. Draining what little energy I had left.

I couldn't even make out her smile as her lithe figure  tiptoed over to me. Long hair swaying alongside the near see through satin night dress she wore.

“I’m sorry, I know you don’t like medicine.” Just from the infantile way she addressed me I could tell she was putting on a mock frown. All the while her burning eyes sliced pieces of my chest away to reveal tender flesh beneath.

“I know you'll forgive me.” One of her hands traced the bindings on my right wrist. Positioning herself as she straddled me and let her other hand wander across my wrist.

It was a very clumsy motion that left only a chance to glance at her face that was still bathed in shadow. Seeing the wetness at the corners of her mouth and the droplets of spit that dripped from her beaming maw onto my naked skin.

I wanted to cry. I had never felt so vulnerable before. Being laid out and eyed with all the fervour of a hungry dog was something I was familiar with. But this was different, all this was different.

Then she started to do things to me. Lowering her face to my abs, her spine bending and cracking as her lolling tongue lapped at my flesh. Climbing rapidly as it left a trail of cool slime in its wake. Claws pawing softly against my stomach as if she was feigning the actions of digging into my abdomen. Interchanging the action with her stronghold on my wrists. Before long her mouth was inches from my own, closing the gap in meer seconds. Kissing me with a deep and primal pushing.

An action that continued to knock against my already strained mental state. My every nerve being set ablaze with the unbridled passion and need that the kiss demanded. Her tongue painted my face with a thick layer of spit as it slunk inside my mouth and brushed over my teeth. Tracing each with a careful desire that drew the action out to a painfully long time.

I felt sick to my stomach. The way she had completely immobilised me and was doing as she pleased. I wanted to fight her off and scream, to push her away and run out of the room. But I couldn’t do anything as her sharp teeth sunk into my lower lip. Softly at first, then with a sharp tug as she threw her head back and ripped the skin off my lower lip with a sickening tear. Washing blood into the back of my throat that mixed with the salt from my silent tears into an unholy broth.

She noticed my weeping and gave a twisted simpering pity smile.

“I’m sorry Miel, did mommy hurt you?” Another dose of her poison flooded my guts and my revulsion tripled. I hated how she’d disabled me and hated even more that I was now at the mercy of every sick fantasy she’d ever had.

But more than that I hated how, if circumstances were different, I probably would have gone along with Julia’s games. My thoughts wandered to reminiscing even in the danger I was currently in. What the hell is wrong with me?

“Don’t worry,” her words roused my stuporous body once again as her weight shifted and a sting sped through my chest. A needle burrowing into my pecs. 

“We’ll have plenty of time together before it’s all over…” Her form shifted and flickering as my conscious mind vanished and I was falling into a deep slumber. Barely aware of the feeling of cloth rubbing against my blood coated mouth.
