You know what’s more unsettling than driving alone on a dark country road late at night? Suddenly realizing you’re *not* alone late at night on that dark country road you thought you had all to yourself.

Kevin’s stolen Maserati – rather, the Maserati that I stole from Kevin after learning he *didn’t* steal it himself – had no idea that I was driving it down a dark, creepy, and rutted forest road. I don’t think they have creepy forest roads like this one in Italy, where the Maserati came from. The car was out of its element on the narrow dirt and gravel strip. It wanted to surge ahead. To out-accelerate a rival at a stop-light. To glide smoothly and sexily down the winding drive of a billionaire’s villa. Instead, it faced deep, muddy puddles and branches from overgrown trees reaching into the road.

Like the car, I also clung to the idea that I was still in a familiar corner of reality. I fretted over thoughts of insurance deductibles and repair costs from any damage I would do to the car while I was its unauthorized operator. I tried to concentrate on navigating the dark country road without snapping an axle or bending the frame. My thoughts kept coming back to what might eventually be written on the police reports describing the damage I caused to the hyper-expensive vehicle I stole.

The road emerged from the forest into a field. The quality of the road surface was just as bad in the field as it was in the forest, but at-least I was in the open. If something was watching me or following me, at least I’d have a chance of seeing it. I rotated the rear-view mirror, being careful to avoid pointing it at me, until I had a good view out the back window.

Each side of the road was bound by an old split-rail fence. The car’s headlights fought a brave battle against the darkness of night and the drizzly fog that filled the air, but it was a battle that they ultimately lost. The road vanished into a black shadow obscuring the vanishing point between the two fences. I drove and drove into that shadow, never coming any closer to the promised point where the fences met.

My anal-retentive fretting over insurance deductibles and repair costs was replaced by an unwelcome deep dread. Was I now experiencing the country version of the inexplainable E6 Travel Plaza space-warp. Was I passing the same puddles and scraggly roadside bushes over and over again?

Despite my fear that I was stuck in another E6-like loop, I felt no relief when the pair of fences finally ended. The road opened into a wide gravel space. A parking lot? A town square without the town? I drove into the void and soon saw a large, indistinct white shape ahead of me.

The car hit a deep rut and my foot slipped off the clutch. The car jumped forward and stalled. The wipers squeaked away the accumulated drops from the windshield and I saw that the white shape was a tiny, run-down church.

It was old. No, not just regular “old,” but “Olde Tyme.” The kind of church Laura Ingles might have felt at-home in.

In another circumstance, the church would have been – I don’t know. Cute? Can churches be cute? If the sun was shining and happy families were having a pot-luck in the yard next to it - a pot-luck with plenty of potato salad and apple pie - then the church would be reassuring and familiar. A classic piece of Americana, you might say.

If you moved the building into the deep South – replace the gloomy gravel parking lot with trees overhung with Spanish moss – then you could imagine the little white building filled with Christian edge-lords speaking in tongues and handling deadly-venomous snakes. Still a bit of Americana - not a reassuring bit of Americana - but at-least a known quantity. Sure, I’d nope-out of there in a millisecond. But at-least I’d know what I was noping out of.

This, though. A nice little church in the rural region of a space-loop centered around the E6 travel-mart, of all things, was not a piece of Americana. Suddenly, the highway next to the E6 seemed like a lot better place to be than here.

The wipers squeaked again and the church came back into focus. I studied it as the rain re-accumulated on the windshield. My bad vibes about the church came from more than just being uncomfortable with the general setting. There was something else. What?

Squeak.

*The steeple*. The steeple was wrong. It was topped with a large wooden cross, as it should be. But the cross-piece was mounted to the vertical at a 45-degree angle, sloping downwards from left to right.

“Nope.” I started the car. The sound-system came on as soon as I turned the key. Dusty Springfield’s lyrical voice told me that *Billy Ray was a preacher’s son and when his daddy would visit he’d come along.*

I mashed my thumb onto the volume knob to turn it off, but nothing happened. The Italian design geniuses behind the Maserati sound system had out-smarted me. I gave up trying to stop the music and revved the engine just to give me the sensation that there was at least *something* I was in control of. I put the car in first, spun the wheel all the way to the right and turned around in a tight circle.

The headlights slid off the church and into the endless darkness to the right of the small building. I kept turning until the part of the gravel lot I drove through on the way in was in front of me.

*When they gathered 'round and started talkin'*  
*That's when Billy would take me walkin'*

Squeak.

*Out through the back yard we'd go walkin'*  
*Then he'd look into my eyes*  
*Lord knows, to my surprise*

Squeak.

A man stood directly in front of the car.

He wore black – black boots, black pants, and a black jacket. His black hat had an almost comically-large brim. His bolo tie looked like a pair of shoelaces hanging from silver doo-dad at his collar. His face, though…

I screamed. A lot. Curse words mostly, but I took Lord’s name in vain a few times too. I stalled the car again.

I punched the dash in the general area of the audio controls and the Maserati’s sound system finally shut up.

Squeak.

His face was so skinny. Emaciated. He had sunken pits under his cheekbones that looked deep enough to hide bullets in. Just to round things out, he wore a nice little soul-patch under his lower lip.

He raised his hand to show me a chunky, leather-bound book. Even through the rain-dappled windshield, I could see that the cover of the book bore a gold-leaf image of the same crooked cross as the one on the church steeple.

He walked with gravel-crunching steps to the driver’s-side of the car. He leaned over and shouted through the window.

“Do you believe in following the direction of the good book?”

It seemed like the right answer to that question, in this particular situation, was *yes*.

“Sure.”

“Sorry ma’am, I can’t hear you with the window closed.”

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Then I rolled the window down.

“Sure. The good book is … good, I guess.”

“I hope you don’t mind me sayin’, this is nice car, ma’am.”

“Thanks.”

“The King know you’re driving his car around these parts?”

“Whelp,” I said loudly. “Nice talking to you.” I rolled the window up. Started the car, revved the engine to the banshee-zone and popped the clutch.

A thousand bits of gravel pinged against the wheel wells and underside of the car. Even though I was launching forward like a rocket, I kept my eyes on the driver’s side mirror. The preacher-man with his crooked bible faded into the gloom. I shifted my gaze to the windshield.

“Fuuuuaargh!” I screamed again and slammed on the brakes. The car rotated slightly due to the differing frictional qualities of the gravel surface under each wheel, and came to an abrupt stop with the front bumper inches from the preacher’s knees. The church was behind him. The lights were now on inside the little white building.

“If you don’t mind me sayin’ so, ma’am, it sure seems like you could use some teachin’ from the good book!”

I put the car in reverse and performed a textbook moonshiner’s turn. My feet danced on the peddles, clutch in, gas off – I spun the car through a half circle – first gear, gas on, clutch out.  Then I was moving forwards, away from the preacher, at a solid fifty. I drove into a deep puddle and muddy water splashed on the windshield. I flicked the wipers. The water cleared and I saw the preacher and the church in front of me again.

I came to another hard stop, this time with the preacher man right outside my driver’s window.

He took off his hat. Long, unkempt black hair spilled onto his shoulders. “Apologies for scaring you, Pauline. But you need to get right with the Lord.”

I pushed the clutch all the way in and put the car in gear. I was ready to peel away the instant my nope detector fired again. I rolled the window down.

“How do you know my name?”

“Names. Yes. That’s a good place to start. I’m The Parson.”

“How do you know my name? How? Tell me or I’ll flatten you next time you teleport in front of my car.”

He held up his book with the golden diagonal cross on the cover. “I know your name because you’re in the book.” He smiled. “You and the King, both.”

“Who is the King? I don’t know a king.”

“Well, this *is* his car.”

“It’s registered to a guy named Kevin. I don’t know *what* Kevin is, but he’s definitely *not* a king.”

The Parson put his hat back on, stood straight and folded his arms. Then he stared at me, like he was waiting for me to figure something out.

“What?”

The Parson cocked his head and gave me an “oh, really” kind of look.

“Look,” I said. I fumbled around under the driver’s seat, looking for the car registration that I had thrown at Kevin. “Here. This car is registered Kevin. Kevin Gustav.”

The Parson leaned into the window and squinted at the registration.

“I believe that paper says his name is Kevin Issandro Nicholas Gustav.”

“Yeah, so?”

“His initials. K. I. N. G. You’re driving the King’s car, miss Pauline. Now how did that come to happen, I wonder?”

My brain screamed: *Gee. Tee. Eff. Oh.*

Gas on. Clutch out. More flying gravel and fighter-jet acceleration. I fishtailed and drifted and somehow managed to get the car pointed back out to where I guessed the exit from the parking lot should be. I held the wheel tight and mentally prepared myself to run The Parson over if he magically appeared in front of me again. Five seconds. No Parson. Ten seconds. No Parson. I let up on the gas and let myself think about driving instead of committing automotive manslaughter. Where was the exit to the gravel lot? I didn’t see it yet.

I looked to the left and to the right. There was nothing but gravel and darkness in both directions. I turned the steering wheel to the right – maybe I miscalculated the direction of the parking lot exit. I’d have to search for it. Something on the passenger seat slid onto the center console. It was the Parson’s book with the crooked golden cross on the cover.

“It’s time you got right with the Lord, Pauline.” My eyes flicked to the rear-view. The Parson smiled at me from the back seat.

Brakes. Another abrupt skidding stop. I flung my door open and tried to get out. I forgot I was wearing the seat belt and ended up half out of the car with the shoulder belt wrapped around my waist.

I screamed and smashed my thumb at the seatbelt buckle. The Italian design geniuses who made the stylish car interior scored another point – I couldn’t release the belt. The Parson leaned forward and reached into the front seat. I punched at his wrist, a completely ineffective and useless move given that I was hanging half out of the car and caught up in the shoulder belt. He calmly picked up the book and reclined back into the rear seat.

I finally managed to unlatch the belt and fell out of the car. The gravel was cold and wet. I stood. Some of the pointier pebbles stuck into my palms. I ran.

No – I didn’t run. I fled. I engaged in panicked forward motion. I didn't care where I was going, as long as it was away from the car. Well, away from The Parson who was in the car.

I'm not in great physical condition. But still, normally I'd be able to get a few hundred yards before hitting the oxygen wall. But the struggle with the seat belt, and my useless screaming in terror took its toll on my anaerobic output. My heart rate hit maximum the instant I saw The Parson behind me in the back seat and didn’t back off.

I made it a few hundred feet before the burning need to put oxygen in my lungs brought me to a standstill, hands on knees, sucking in as much air as I could. The rain picked up. The darkness picked up too. The night became thicker. The universe consisted of me, the car, and the gravel. I couldn't even see the church anymore.

I looked behind me. There was motion inside the car. I turned and ran again, this time at a pace I thought I could maintain – basically a fast walk. I heard the car door slam. Then the sound of tires rolling over gravel. I turned around. The Parson was driving. He had put his hat back on. The Maserati was just idling forward, but moving faster than I was.

I stopped and put bent over – hands on knees again – to catch my breath. I wasn’t going to outrun the Maserati.

The black car and its black-clothed, righteous driver pulled to a stop next to me. The Parson rolled the window down.

“Miss Pauline. I believe I we have gotten off on the wrong foot, you and I.”

“Ya think?” I get sarcastic when I’m terrified.

“I’d like to read to you.” He reached to the passenger seat and picked up the bible-like tome. “A passage from the good book.”

“Thanks, but no thanks. I don’t need to hear any parables about whatever the heck I’ve done to deserve being here.”

“This passage, Pauline, isn’t a parable that might relate to any young woman who had stolen an expensive car from an important entity. This passage is about you. Specifically. It tells us what the King said about you. At the party. Do you remember the party?”

“Yeah, I remember the party. Kevin – sorry, the King – was rocking out like a lunatic to Mony Mony.”

The Parson opened the book to a page marked by a black ribbon, about three quarters of the way through. He cleared his throat, then began to read.

“And Lo!”

“Lo? Really?” I couldn’t believe the mandatory-fun corporate event in a two-star hotel ballroom was important enough to merit full-on Biblical “Lo!”

“Lo.” He continued, matter-of-factly.  “The woman beheld the King as he was joyful and dancing. And the King beheld the woman – that’s you Pauline.”

“Yeah, I got that.”

The Parson continued reading. “The King beheld the woman and came to where she stood. There he taught her and made known his wisdom. And the woman knew the path to ascension.”

In some demented way, the Parson was describing the strange conversation I had with Kevin about pawn promotion – when the pawn makes it way to the other side of the board and becomes a queen.

“The King then strode to the men of business and the men beheld him. ‘Pauline,’ he said, ‘is going to leave the universe tonight.’ The men of business were mirthful. ‘She will never return,’ the King said. The men of business laughed even more forcefully.”

The Parson closed the book with a snap. “Did you know this, Pauline? That your friend from the party intended to remove you from your universe?”

I *didn’t* know that. Did I? I mean, Kevin – who I only knew as crazy-dancing-dad-bod-guy when I met him at the party, *did* invite me to the “edge of the black side of the board.” But I thought that was just some kind of pickup-line or something. How could I know that he was *actually* stating his intent to move me from reality into his pop-tart and funion version of the world through the looking glass.

“You’ve been tricked, Pauline. Played. Taken for a fool.”

“I know,” I admitted.

“You’ve had the wool pulled over your eyes. Scammed. Taken for a ri-“

“I *got* it!”

“I know how to make this right, Pauline.” He turned the car off and stepped out. “I can make you right with the *Lord.*” He straightened his bolo tie. The silver clasp holding the strings of his bolo was in the shape of a chess piece – a bishop.

“Come with me, my white lamb. My little pawn. It is time. Time for the lord to choose our next move.”

He strode past me and I turned to follow him. The little church stood directly in front of us, no longer obscured by the gloom. I followed him up the short flight of white-painted steps.

“The Lord chooses the moves. We are only the pieces.” The parson opened the front door to the church. A chime rang. He gestured for me to enter and I obeyed.

I stepped across the threshold. A counter with three cash registers stood in front of me. To my right, a dozen rows of shelves stocked with sugary, fried food. Behind them, a wall of glass doors keeping the refrigerated drinks cold. I was back in the E6 travel mart.
