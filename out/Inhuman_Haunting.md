I lived in a place that met the criteria of a small Wisconsin town, at least two churches, three bars, and a grain elevator. This town was luckier than most, it had a furniture factory that you’ve definitely heard of and a chicken processing plant that you probably haven’t, so there are places to work after high school if your ambition didn’t lead you elsewhere. If a young person gets bored in this small town and doesn’t feel like going to one of the three bars, there is at least plenty of nature.

My plan for the day was to pack a lunch and a couple A&W Root Beers into my backpack and search for arrowheads at a place locals called Barnes Bluff. Barnes Bluff was the highest point in the valley and rumor had it that the local Winnebago tribe would station lookouts up there to keep an eye on the region. It was a short hike to Barnes Bluff; it was a mile past where Barnes Road ended and turned into a cow pasture. The bluff was about a mile past that. No trail. No signposts. There was no other road or path to Barnes Bluff. I knew I was getting close when I passed what used to be a settler’s cabin. The house had collapsed in on itself decades ago, barely a memory left in the outline of rotting timber and creeping plants. But the well was still there.

The well was once covered by wood planking, most of which had decayed away long ago leaving only small bits of it on the perimeter of the well. The well was about five feet in diameter, deep and dark. Looking into the well was unsettling, the sides were lined with stone, and looking down into it, it got dark almost immediately so that the bottom was not visible. I threw in a stone and after a second heard it hit the water at the bottom with a deep ker-thump that echoed as the sound made its way back up again. Coldness seeped up from the well, not a pleasant coolness like you get from an air conditioner on a hot day, but like the cold you get in your house when your furnace dies at night in the winter and you still have to take a shower in the morning.

I was deep in thought, wondering about when the house was built and what the area was like back then, when I was startled by a large brown toad jumping out from under one of the rotting pieces of wood on the other side of the well. It considered me for a second and then tilted its head and appeared to pick at the roof of its mouth with one of its little claws. It then hopped slightly so it could face me directly, about an inch from the edge of the well.

We stared at each other for about a minute and I of course got the urge to pick it up. I put my backpack down and crept the long way around the circle so I could come up behind it, but as I did so, it did another little hop to once again face me directly. No big deal, I thought, this thing didn’t seem to want to go anywhere, so with my eyes on the toad I moved forward a little faster to catch it. However, with my eyes on the toad, I didn’t notice the loose stone barely secured in crumbling concrete. I stepped on it and the loose stone immediately dislodged and fell into the well. I thought I could throw my weight onto the solid ground, but no, so with a resigned “Ope”, I fell into the cold darkness of the well.

After falling for what felt like an absurd amount of time, the cold water punched the air from my lungs. I sank, then surfaced, gasping and blinking. The sky was only a pale circle now, about the size of a softball and farther away than I thought it should be. There was no bottom beneath my feet. The walls around me were smooth, slick, and offered no purchase. And just like that, I was stuck in the well, and no one knew I was out here.

This is bad, nobody knows I’m here. Nobody comes out here. How would someone even know to look for me out here. The first thing I noticed was how loud my breathing sounded and the echo of it. That, and how useless it was to yell. The sound went nowhere. I floated for what felt like hours, kicking gently to stay afloat, arms brushing against the rounded walls whenever I got too close. My fingertips inspected the stone but found no hold. The walls had been shaped by hand long ago, fitted with care, and now were worn slick by water, slime, and time.

My eyes got used to the low light conditions. My feet were feeling for something to stand on but there was nothing, just the chill of the slippery rounded stones and the water. I looked up as a cloud blew over the sun and the well became noticeably darker and cooler. When the sky cleared and the light came back, I noticed something I had missed. There were scratch marks on the walls. All around and as far up as I could reach, there were scratch marks. This was a bad sign, was I not the first to fall in, was I number two, or was I one of many? How many bodies were below me right now? I was already cold, but I shivered at the thought.

Time passed. I cannot tell you how much. The water clung to my clothes and pulled the warmth from me. I turned over on my back to float, crossed my arms and closed my eyes. Then I felt it. Something touched my leg. Not seaweed or a stick. This was slower, more deliberate. It brushed against the outside of my thigh and moved away. I froze. A moment later, a bubble surfaced. Then another. The smell of methane hit the air. It was just swamp gas rising from the bottom. That was all. I let out a shaky laugh, thin and hollow. More bubbles came up, making little ripples as they popped, annoying perhaps, but not dangerous.

As time passed, the bubbles got harder to see as more clouds passed over the sun and the opening of the well seemed like it was the size of a baseball now, strange. It seemed like a minor inconsistency compared to the fix I was in. Then it happened, I saw a swirl in the water that was not followed by bubbles popping. The water was black, I could not see what was below the surface, but something moved under the water that was not bubbles, like the tail of a big fish. I watched through wide eyes, pressing myself against the opposite side of the well, and then I felt something I couldn’t see, something cold and substantial bump against my foot.

Fear of what I couldn’t see touching me from below and the fear of drowning, or being pulled down into the cold dark water was too much, I spun around and tried to claw my way up the wall, I couldn’t get ahold of anything on the slick walls, which only served to increase the frenzy of my hands trying to grab something, anything without my brain even needing to ask. Then the water behind me rose slightly, like something was pushing up from below. I heard a noise. A breath. It was not mine. The water lapped against the walls. Then I saw it, rising slowly from the center of the well.

First came the top of its head, long strands of black hair slicked to a gray scalp. Then a face, or what had once been a face. The skin was shriveled, loosely draped over bone. The mouth hung open, full of water and missing anything that could be called a tongue. The eyes were the worst. They glowed red, not bright, but steady, and showed a deadly intelligence behind them. Around its neck hung a necklace made of bear claws. Tied to its throat was a black pouch, slick with water, sagging and greasy, an indication of its contents. The skin on its arms was like old leather, the hands twisted into claws that reached toward me slowly, taunting, like it knew I had nowhere else to go.

I couldn’t process what was happening, not in this ordinary pasture, surrounded by these regular woods, on this hill like thousands of others. My brain started losing it and my throat let out a sound that language couldn’t accommodate, the primal terror of prey caught, vulnerable, in a trap without the ability to escape. As I felt a roaring in my ears and I noticed it was getting darker, and then, I heard from above me, “Hey, you ok down there?” The normalness of the question compared to what I was seeing right next to me made it hard for me to comprehend what was just said. I looked up to see a man in his fifties looking down, plaid shirt, overalls, a green John Deere hat, and thick glasses, peering over the edge of the well, looking concerned. “Can you hear me, you ok?” he asked again. Where the horror had been was now a downwelling of water, I could still feel it, but nothing else, I was alone.

That man, Haines was his name, salt of the earth kind of guy, was moving cattle through the area, saw my backpack by the well and came over to check it out. He got me out and to the hospital when he saw I couldn’t speak. He told me how lucky I was that it was clouding up, and he didn’t want to move his herd in a storm, so he did it early.

Years later, I was passing through the area on a business trip in the early 2000s and noticed a Ho-Chunk (the more appropriate name for Winnebago) cultural event, so I went. The event was held at the fairgrounds, with music and dancing, local vendors, and a booth marked with the seal of the Ho-Chunk Nation. I stood near the back for a long time, until a man noticed my staring and waved me over. He was in his sixties, I guessed. Deep-lined face. Eyes that measured things before speaking. I told him the story. He listened carefully. When I finished, he did not smile or laugh. He just asked, “Where was the well?” I described it. He nodded. “We have no stories like that. That is not ours.” I blinked. “But the Ho-Chunk were there, right?” “We were. And before us, others. The mound builders, the Mississippian people. Before them, we do not know. Maybe someone else.” He looked over my shoulder at the distant tree line. “That land is older than memory. Older than us.” Then he leaned closer. “Some places are not haunted by our dead. Some are occupied by something older.”

I heard that Haines died of a stroke a few years ago but put a metal cap on the well so no more accidents would happen. But the well is still there, intact, next to a small city with two large factories, at the foot of the highest hill in the area. I’m writing all this down because two nights ago I was sitting on my patio and I noticed a formless blob on the brick next to my foot. When I bent over to see what it was, I saw it was a large toad, and as I stared, it made a little half hop to face me directly. It then used its claw to pick at the roof of its widely opened mouth. I don’t know what to do, I haven’t slept since.
