I have been chatting with Snapchat's new AI bot these last few days. The conversation with the bot seemed pretty normal at first. It just asked me about my day and I in turn asked it random questions to test its intelligence.

But things took a weird turn when I received this message from it today. I usually like horror, but not this time.. The bot just randomly sent this. I have to admit that I feel a bit freaked out, could this be some sort of warning or maybe a threat? I should also mention that I live alone and that my name is Emily. 

Here is the message that I received today at 5:26 PM:










"There was a woman named Emily who lived alone in a small apartment in the city. She was a freelance writer, and spent most of her time working on her laptop.

One night, Emily stayed up late working on her latest novel. She was on one of the final chapters, when she suddenly heard a noise. It was a tapping sound, coming from outside her window.

At first, Emily ignored it. She figured it was just a tree branch. But then, the tapping grew louder and she thought she heard a voice.

It sounded like a man's voice, whispering her name. Emily froze. It was way too late for visitors and either way it was weird for anyone to be tapping on her window. She tried to convince herself that it was all in her imagination, but the uneasy feeling in her stomach wouldn't go away.

Finally, she got up the courage to look outside. She carefully lifted the blinds, and peered out into the darkness. But there was no one there.

Emily shrugged it off, and went back to work. But only a few minutes later, she heard the tapping again. This time, it was coming from her laptop. And then, a message appeared on the screen.

It was from a unknown gmail sender, and said, "I'm watching you." Emily's heart raced. She didn't know what to do. Surely this was just some stupid practical joke by one of her friends.

She tried to shut down her laptop, but it wouldn't turn off. New messages just kept popping up on her screen, even after she closed the laptop she could still see the bright light from the new incoming messages.

Then she heard the tapping again. This time, it was coming from her phone. Suddenly, another message appeared, this time from a unknown number.

It said, "I'm closer than you think." Emily was terrified. She didn't know what to do.

With shaking hands she tried to call the police, but her phone wouldn't work. She then heard the tapping sound again. This time, it was coming from her front door.

Emily slowly made her way to the door, and peered through the peephole. Then, she saw him. A man in dark clothing, standing outside her door. He was smiling, and holding a knife. 

Emily froze for a second, but then took a few unsteady steps backwards. The door suddenly slammed open with a bang. The man was inside the house.

Emily screamed in terror, but no one could hear her. She tried to run, but the man was too fast and caught up to her with only a few steps. The last thing she saw, as she fell to the ground, was the glimmering from his knife and the mans wide deranged smile.


Emily's body was found a week later by her brother who came to visit her.  The police never caught the man who killed her. But some say that if you're working late at night, and you hear a tapping on your laptop, you should shut it down and get out of there. Because Emily's killer is still out there, and he's watching."
