Years ago, when I was in the foster care system, I had a horrific experience. By the time I was sixteen, I was too old to be adopted. So I was sent to a group home. I stayed there for five years. Towards the end of my fourth year, I was transitioned to their ILP program. I was so excited!

I would be able to live completely without adult supervision, cook whatever I liked, and stay up as late as I wanted. I worked part-time while going to school at Open Campus, so school and work took up most of my time. But I digress.

When the last of my stuff was put into the house that I had been assigned, I collapsed on the old couch and took a nap. THUD!

I woke up immediately and looked up. THUD! THUD! It sounded like someone was stomping on the ceiling. It was so strange because the only thing that I could think of was who could be in the attic in the middle of August? After searching, I found the entrance to the attic in a spare bedroom. The small house had two bedrooms and one bathroom with a kitchen, living room, and a common area for house meetings.
 
I opened the entrance and stuck my head up. To my utter shock and disbelief, I saw two crimson eyes staring at me literally a foot away. I shrieked and pulled my head back down and closed the entrance. I was so scared I was shaking. I was a practical person. I never believed in demons or ghosts. I do now.

That night, after I was done putting everything away, I lay in my bed staring at the ceiling. Suddenly, I hears a demonic growl right next to my ear. I immediately began saying the Lord's Prayer. It worked, but it wasn't enough. 

Night after night, this thing, which I realized was a demon, tortured me. I would wake up with scratches down my arms and legs. I would be frequently shoved and pushed. The thing even destroyed my self-confidence. In the end, I was only two months away from a successful discharge from the ILP and group home's programs.

I had secured full-time employment in the city and was looking out to a brighter future. The last day came, and I was packing to move into my new apartment. After the last box was taken, and I was about to leave, the front door slammed shut and locked itself. Before I could register what was going on, I was punched in the stomach.

The demon had me by my hair and was yanking it out by the roots. Using my hair, it forced me to the ground and began ripping my hair out. Suddenly a rage filled me, in the loudest I could manage I said, "Get thee hence Satan, in CHRIST'S NAME LEAVE ME ALONE!!!" I was screaming by the end. The demon released my hair, snarled, and left. 

I held my head, which was painful. I could feel a bald spot, but no blood. I stood up and, holding my stomach, I left. After I got into my car, I lifted my shirt and saw a massive purple and black bruise stretching across my abdomen.

I cried in my car. Tears of pain and gratitude poured down my face. For the first time in what felt like forever, I had fought back. With that, I left. I felt sure that I had made my point and finally I was free.

But that's not where this story ends. A year later, I am rocking and rolling at my job. My apartment has been decorated with a bunch of antiques, and I have a good life. Until one night, when my guard was down, the demon came after me again. He surrounded me with fear, and it worked.
 
Then, as I was trying to find the source of what could be causing this, I realized that I couldn't talk. I tried opening my jaw, but I couldn't. Then I realized I couldn't move anything but my eyes. They locked on a pair of crimson eyes in a dark corner. The twisted, serpentine body of this creature was massive. His face was in shadow, and only his burning red eyes could be seen. I began to pray to the Lord in my mind so that He could loosen my jaw.

My prayer was granted, I bared my teeth at him. "Get thee hence Satan, in Christ's name I order thee to leave!" My voice was barely above a whisper, but it didn't matter. The demon's influence and power flowed out of me like water through a sieve. Exhausted, I collapsed and passed out. 

The next day, I smudged the entire apartment and used olive oil and salt to seal off my apartment and prevent the demon from returning. I have spoken to a priest about this, and he said that it was unlikely that the demon would return since I had rebuked him twice. But he did tell me that although it was unlikely, I could still be attacked by the demon. 

To this day, I have not been attacked. I believe that he will not attack me again. But the problem is he is not the only demon out there.

Stay safe, everyone.


The reason that I do not say the name of the group home is because there were and still are boys and girls in protected custody. I am sorry.
