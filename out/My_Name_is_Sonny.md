Have you ever heard of "Groundhog Day"? It's an old movie about a guy reliving the same day over and over again. It is a simple concept and there's movies, books, comics and whatever other media that pops into your head that had done this topic to death.

Of course, it is a scientific impossibility. I tried to find any possible reasoning behind it and couldn't. Maybe there is something esoteric out there that makes it possible, really that is the only other *possible* explanation.

I did my due diligence, tried every possible angle I could, tried every single possible *thing* that popped into my mind. Yet at the end of all of that fuckery I basically began doing the same thing over and over again just to kill the time... I could never explain why and how anything that happened on the 21st of July, 2025. made any goddamn sense.

And I had a *lot* of time to kill.

To make a long story short I am 24 years old - in body. In mind? Well, I lost count. A couple of centuries? Maybe a millennium? Who knows! The main difference between me and the guy in Groundhog Day is that if I survive that day I can go on for as long as I physically can. That much I am certain. But it's not like I am able to survive beyond that cursed fucking date - the world really made it difficult for me... And everyone else.

Now, what made it so difficult? Well, the world went down under quicker than the F-16's that stopped the plane back in '01.

From what I gathered it is up to me to stop the fucking apocalypse! Yup, you heard me right. The end of the world as we know it happened on the 21st of July. And little ol' me is tasked with stopping it. And I think - *thought* I won't be going back to normal until I do it. 

And am I some sort of fucking superhero? Absolutely fucking not. I am just an average guy, with an average build and average everything. I ain't anything special. But I make up for the average-ness in sheer goddamn dedication of not dying. I got pretty good at it.

The longest I survived was to 2040 something, couldn't really count the days when the world was plunged back into Stone Age, and honestly it was difficult to count because the sun was blotted out for who knows how long. I died from an infected wound caused by those acid-spewing pieces of shit... That was the first time I made it that far.

Oh and yeah, my name is Sonny, that's all you need to know about me really... God I am a horrible writer. Agh, anyway - I was born in France but lived in the US for most of my life before moving to the bustling metropolis of Kyusahi City. Why of all places did I go halfway across the world to an Asian tax haven? Well, with a population of 2 million and in need of workers, I took a gamble and got my ass onto a plane. Not to mention the rent is pretty cheap, surprisingly.

And I could hop over to Okinawa or the mainland whenever, Okinawa's the Japanese islands, for you geographically uneducated... The place was somethin'. Combine New York, London, Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong and whatever big city comes to mind, it's that times ten for Kyusahi. I mean you see all that on video and all that jazz. But goddamn, it really does impress you the first time... But then after a while it kinda gets stale, goes to the background. The novelty just wears off, you know.

I worked as a receptionist in some Japanese hotel chain. It helped that I was fluent in English, and French and knew a decent bit of Japanese and Mandarin. There were quite a bit of French speakers over there, considering it was a French colony for a time it's no surprise, really.

The salary was fantastic, triple of what I'd make back home... But there is one issue, the salary might've been three times as big - but the prices were five times higher as well. Despite the low rent a ten dollar sandwich was not cheap.

So soon enough I was penny-pinching.

And this entire bag of bullshit began when I was in a convenience store on a day off... Yeah, the 21st is Saturday... I buy the most basic groceries and overpriced cigarettes, cancer premium, I know... I'd always return to the point of looking at the girl who works at the register, her robotic smile faltering just slightly when I go in to give her a handful of coins that add up to eighty four dollar and twelve cents - I did the conversions. That just barely covers the cost of a single small bag enough to last me three days... Four if I really stretch it to Spartan levels of rationing.

Then I went home and ran into my older neighbor walking his dog, Twinkles... Twinkles would try to bite my bag and fail, as always, he'd mention the festival in the center, and sometimes he'd give me his Zippo lighter if I forgot to buy one at the store... After that, I'd go into my small apartment, and while unlocking the door I'd see my other neighbor, a girl around my age dressed-up for a night out. She'd always be on her phone and mention the "Dragon's Caffe", that's with two F's, I know.

Keep that name in mind it'll become important later.

Now, everything happens like clockwork even if I am home early or later than usual. 

Then I remember even before all this shit began, I had a mental breakdown from the constant stress and decided to go out to the festival. Treat myself for once because for the love of God and all that is Holy I deserved that at least, I worked my ass off.

Despite having barely any money left I got onto the train and went to Hayashi station. It was crowded as all hell, I hate crowds. Alas, I wandered around a bit and enjoyed the atmosphere and the mix of European and Asian aesthetics, good music... Food, I can't really tell. Smelled nice.

I avoided bars because the markup on drinks was unholy, so I tried to find a convenience store, buy myself a "cheap" drink, and sit somewhere on a bench like a bum. Cheap over here is theft elsewhere.

I did just that, I sat on a bench right across the Dragon's Caffe, I didn't follow my neighbor, I ain't a creep. T'was just a coincidence. Neat little place, crowded as all the other places, but the decor and interior were really well done, I could even see the neon lit bar from the outside. Really was a shame I couldn't go in to enjoy it then...

Then I saw a woman come out of the place. A woman so beautiful that when I saw her I swear the entire world stopped and I couldn't hear anything or see anything... But her. Red hair and green eyes...

She looked at me, or at least it looked like she looked at me.

Then her smile faded.

It quickly turned to that of absolute fear.

Then I heard like a crack behind me... Before everything went black...

At least... At least I knew I wasn't that ugly.

The next thing I saw was a girl, but not the red-haired beauty... It was the girl at the grocery store with her robotic smile, telling me the price of the groceries. I felt the same wave of dread at the price go through me at that moment. But the thing is - the past events felt like a dream. Like I was day dreaming. I kept on doing things normally, I remembered to grab a lighter though. And then the deja vu hit - the neighbor, the empty street crossing, Twinkles, the girl dressed-up for a night out... Horrible fucking bag too, expensive as all hell, but good God I never noticed it the first time. That bag doesn't go with her black dress at all.

Anyway I am rambling.

The second iteration was chaotic too, I died quickly at the festival as well. But this time I saw what got me... A hairy twenty foot tall black-furred behemoth, killing and smashing everything in its path. I saw others as well, some bigger some smaller... All equally deadly.

Now, why don't you try and convince people? I did, that was one of my first reactions. And what did I get with that? I got arrested a couple of times. Put into a mental institution for a few hours, before dying, of course. Over the course of this whole bullshit life I had - I got charged with aggravated assault, public indecency, public intoxication, public nudity, robbery and I can't remember what else. Never all of the above in one life-time. Thankfully, murder of another human being was not on that list... Well, I never got charged for killing, but that's beyond the point.

The point is, I tried. I tried to convince people in a nice way, sometimes coerce them, sometimes I tried to make shit up. Sometimes it almost worked, once it actually fucking worked, but most of the time, it didn't. But the result is all the same. Death. And Earth being turned into a physical manifestation of hell.

A few iterations later I managed to position myself so as to not die immediately, and I learned how to avoid those things. I survived for I think a few hours... Then the corpses of the people killed began to, well... Begin walking again.

Let us just say that being crushed is a whole lot better than being eaten alive.

It took me quite a bit of time before I managed to survive for more than a week, I always retained my memories... It was so stressful in the beginning but you kind of just get used to it. The novelty wore off... Similar to when I first arrived to Kyusahi.

Anyway, I decided to hole up in my apartment, I learned that those things "spawned" at the festival. It eventually arrived to where I was as well, of course. But it gave me some breathing room.

I died hundreds of times before I managed to survive my first month. I tried desperately to stay in the city but I still haven't attempted to escape it... So I did, I smuggled myself onto a boat to mainland Japan and got off scott-free. It took a few attempts but I did it. Why didn't I buy a ticket? As I said, I was fucking broke. But it was early back then, I could've just robbed some place or someone. But then again, even when I paid, well I ended up drowning. But I did manage to get there a couple times.

Anyway, I was dead within the month. It got to Japan as well, China too. I remember as the last communications from Europe ceased a few days before that death, then on the day I died the American continent went silent. It wasn't just in Kyusahi, it was global. And the world's militaries could do nothing to stop it. Not even nuclear armageddon would help, that much I know. It would help *them* more if anything.

I realized it originated there in Kyusahi... At the festival. I couldn't warn people, of course. I tried everything as I said.

Then one iteration, an iteration where I decided to remain in Kyusahi, I managed to kill one of those things. This one in particular had wings, it looked like an oversized bat of sorts. It was dumb, I coaxed it to slam into a glass window, it of course smashed through but it was disoriented. Then I and a couple of others began stabbing it and hitting it and shooting it with whatever we could, killing it after it took an unholy amount of brutality.

I died soon thereafter... All of us died. But from that point onward I never saw the flying piece of shit again. Other monsters were capable of flight but nowhere near the size of that fucking thing. They weren't as a big threat compared to the bat thing... Not to mention even those smaller ones were a lot less numerous than before. At least I think.

I realized that there were beings that in the beginning spawned the smaller ones.

"Harbingers" I called them.

If I managed to kill any of them, it would mean that in the future they would not be a problem... And maybe we could get a fighting chance then. But I also realized that *I* had to kill them. Or at least, I could administer the finishing blow. 

But I am one man, how can I fucking do that you ask?

I have all the time in the world.

I did not do it alone of course. How could I? I am not Rambo to go through with it all.

Now that bar which I mentioned previously, the Dragon's Caffe. Something happened inside and right around it that made people have some sort of powers. I assumed since I was nearby, just across, that I was in the area of effect. The thing is I am just a normal human being, while the others have superpowers. Not on the level of Superman or the X-Men, but with enhanced strength, and agility, some can manipulate matter. Water, air, earth, fire, metal and so on... They were always helpful.

I reckoned I was blessed with a fucked up version of immortality.

The red-haired girl was among those. She probably had the most powerful tool. She became Zeus, basically. I won't go into details, you can use your imagination and you'll probably be right.

In the beginning, I did join up with them but as time went by I realized that might not be optimal. I knew too much about them. The good guys would eventually become sadistic warlords in a post-apocalyptic world. They held power... And some of them were irredeemable. Then I went through a phase of thinking - "Well, if I am trying to save these fucking monsters, they ain't worth saving at all!"

And to be honest, I was kinda right. But then again, it took a few years, and I eventually came back to trying to make a difference again... Avoid the depression phase and... The phase of becoming some sort of vigilante, Jackass, Borat kinda combo with a sprinkle of schizophrenia.

I found out the bad way, that you don't judge a book by its cover. And I died at their hands more times than once. Clare killed me a couple of times too... The red-haired girl, that is.

The best option for me was to nudge them toward the target and hope to whatever higher power there is that they kill it or wound it to the point where I or someone else can finish it off, even if *they* killed it, it kinda had a similar effect. But not as poignant and direct as mine. If they killed it one iteration, it would become *slightly* weaker the next. And I managed to get most of those bastards in that way... Sometimes I had to be the sacrificial lamb...

I died in every possible way imaginable. I can give you a list of the best and worst ways of dying. Drowning is preferable to some ways the monsters kill you, the spindly spider fucking things and their venom especially. I was shot, hanged, ripped apart, burned alive, crushed, burned in acid, atomized, pulverized, had my skin harvested and so on... I turned into a zombie more than a few times as well.... And let me tell you that isn't a pleasant experience either. 

But being electrocuted hurt in more ways than one... Clare didn't hold back sometimes. And that lack of restraint... It kinda stung.

You get used to death, funnily enough. But the dying part is what still makes me think twice before doing something stupid. Some part of your brain still tries to keep you alive. But after some time you learn how to temporarily turn that part off... And basically throw yourself into death without a second thought.

Eventually, using various methods and ways... Blind luck included, I killed, I killed all of them. The last one was the most difficult. It was humanoid but intelligent. I think it somehow knew  about my power, about my reincarnation, I don't know for sure. I think it could read minds. But I killed it by making it chase me and others into a nuclear power plant. So I doubt it can... I don't know.

It wasn't immune to radiation that one, and with that it wasn't immune to three magazines of 9mm to the skull... Neither was I, to either. 

It sucked, I coughed up my lungs, literally. My skin fell apart like rotten leather. My flesh boiled. But I was happy. 

I was fucking happy.

I thought this was the end, I was so sure of my theory.. I will feel this pain one last time.

I'll be dead, for good.

But it wasn't. The sweet embrace of death didn't take me for the last time, no no. I was back again.

To that convenience store.

Maybe, just maybe, I thought the world won't go shit at least. I could continue living my life, or maybe I could end it myself. After so much, I didn't really know what to do, what to live. I simply couldn't live with that type of weight and experience. I couldn't.

I decided to give it a shot. To try and turn my life around, maybe get married. Ask Clare out, again. Without the power and apocalypse shenanigans... I knew her well, so I think I have a shot with normal Clare as well.

But no, it was again the same shit all over again. It wasn't as extreme, but those things still kept coming out and killing everyone. It took them longer but they still pushed humanity into extinction... 

I had no other choice.

I have no other choice.

If it isn't the monsters, it is me. 

Maybe it is that bar. Maybe something under it. I tried to find something... Nothing.

So maybe, it really is me. Maybe I am the epicenter of all this shit. It starts there, at the festival. Right where I was.

Exactly at that bench. Where I sat, drinking a stale beer and smoking an overpriced cigarette.

But I cannot die, not truly. If it isn't me it is some kind of cult or something in the city, near the festival.

Nothing, I found nothing. And believe me, centuries...

*Millennia* of searching. Even for one man. You can do a lot... You really can do a whole fucking lot. I excavated, I searched, I raised an entire post-apocalyptic society following my fucking prophecies. And I had some people way fucking smarter than me try to crack the code.

Nothing.

I have no other choice than to assume it is the city itself. I have to erase it from the face of the Earth, from all record and from the fucking timeline if need be. But even if it is nuked to kingdom come, it does nothing. So I have to do, something else.

Something no one ever thought of.

If you are hearing this or reading this, I managed to do it somehow. 

I don't know how, or how long it took me... Probably thousands of years of trial and error, tens of thousands who knows... Until I got it just right.

I am damned to this fate. But I am still driven to do something. I must do something. And if it means erasing an entire city, an entire island, and its population from existence.

Yes... If I erase this island I will change the course of history. And if I change the course of history... I might've never been born in the first place... Yes, then I'd be dead... No, no, no, I'd never have existed in the first place. And I'd stop this... I hope. Maybe, this fucked up deity, he, she, *it* \- will find some way to continue my agony.

Peace. A fantasy.

Life. Inevitable.

Death. Inescapable.

I am sorry. I am doing this writing thing for myself. I tried to warn the world about it through this very platform here. It worked about as well as you'd imagine. Who knows, maybe in some timeline, I am a good writer. But in this one... In this I am just... A bug.

I am sorry to my family, to all the people of Kyusahi, and this planet. Which I wronged in any way.

I did what I could. I did what I must.

But I did succeed. Because I have all the time in the world.

My name is Sonny.

And I... Never lived. Nor have I died.

...

Maybe, this writing thing is not that bad?
