It was 2012. I was just a normal teenager, hooked on energy drinks — Monster and Red Bull cans always stacked next to my keyboard. Chocolate bars were my snacks of choice during long gaming sessions. School was boring, but once I got home, I could disappear into games for hours, sometimes the entire night.

One evening, I stumbled upon a new indie game on a forum I frequented. It was called The Hollow, advertised as a psychological horror game with an unconventional story and atmosphere. Curious, I downloaded it right away. The graphics were simple, a bit pixelated, but the atmosphere was heavy—like someone had poured their soul into every pixel.

I sat down with a Monster in one hand and a half-eaten chocolate bar next to my keyboard.  When the game started, I found myself in a dense, dark forest. Thick fog hung in the air, and I felt like I was being watched. The narrow path I followed twisted and turned, but something felt off. Trees shifted shape. Suddenly, I was somewhere I hadn’t seen before, even though I’d only followed a straight trail.

Shadows moved at the edge of my vision. Sure, maybe it was just game design, but sometimes I heard whispers—soft, barely audible—that weren’t part of the game’s script or sounds. It felt like something was trying to talk to me.

When I looked away from the screen, my room seemed different. The darkness in the corner by my computer felt thick, like it swallowed the light.

I kept playing. The Monster cans piled up, and the chocolate disappeared faster than usual. My days became a blur. At school, I nodded off in class, but the moment I was home and in front of my PC, I woke up again.

But the more I played, the stranger things got. The screen flickered sometimes, and when I looked away, I caught glimpses of things that shouldn’t be there—a shadow standing perfectly still in the background, a door opening without me clicking, a figure vanishing when I blinked.

I showed my friends, but they never saw anything weird. “It’s just glitches,” they said. But I knew it was something else.

One night, after a Red Bull and some chocolate, the game suddenly started showing weird messages in the text boxes. It displayed my name. I heard voices through my headphones—whispers repeating my name.

I tried to quit the game, but my computer wouldn’t respond. It was like it refused to obey me.

Slowly, my reality and the game’s world started to blur. I saw things in my room that resembled the forest in the game. Shadows moved unnaturally. I felt a presence following me even when the screen was off.

I woke up one morning with scratch marks on my arm—like something had tried to grab me. I had no idea how they got there.

I wanted to quit playing. But the game was still there on my hard drive, waiting. When I opened it again, everything got worse. A new message appeared on the screen:

“Let us out.”

I clicked “No.”

My computer died.

A cold fog filled the room.

The voices came closer.

Now I’m trapped somewhere between the game and reality. I don’t know how much time has passed, but I hear them—the shadows, the whispers—every night.

They’re waiting.

And one day, they’ll be free.

When that day comes, I don’t think I’ll be the only one pulled in.

Has anyone else ever downloaded a game they shouldn’t have? Because I’m not sure I’m going to make it out of this one.
