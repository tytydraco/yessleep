I made it out of everything alive to type this up. Unfortunately, not everyone else did.

“I never should have married you,” Kimmy sighed as she leaned back against her Corolla.

That wasn’t the reassurance I wanted from the love of my life. [But considering how shitty the night had been, the news wasn’t particularly shocking](https://redd.it/13z778h).

She smiled, and it was just the saddest thing. “You know how you won me over, Russ?” she asked, her wavy hair falling over an elfish year in a way that always made my breath hitch.

“I have to give myself credit,” I responded, forcing a grin. “How many people would save a stranger from a barfight?”

Her eyes drifted awkwardly to the side.

“…you said that winning the fight was the sexiest thing you’d ever seen.”

Kimmy’s eyes slid further.

An awkward silence hung.

“Do you know how big that guy was who wanted to kick your ass for flirting with me?” she pressed, finally interrupting the crickets.

I shrugged. “About my height, I think.”

Kimmy wrinkled her nose. “No, that was his friend. He came in to help the collegiate defensive tackle with arms as thick as your head.”

I squirmed. “I thought the guy who punched me was the only other person in the fight.”

Kimmy wrinkled her forehead. “That guy just wanted in on the asskicking you were about to get.”

“Oh.”

“Yep.”

“So… what happened to Mr. Defensive Tackle?” I pressed, confused.

She raised an eyebrow.

“Wait – did you cripple him?”

“I found out later that he never played football again.” She scratched her nose. “I actually don’t feel guilty.”

I nodded slowly. “So you were impressed with how I beat up his shitbag friend?”

She pursed her lips.

My jaw fell. “Did you do your paralyzing trick on him just before he and I fought?”

“You were going to get pounded through the floor, Russ!” she answered defensively. 

“I could have held my own,” I whispered.

“He was half-paralyzed and you still *barely* beat him.” She folded her arms.

I stared down at my crossed legs. “So everything was a lie from day one. You never liked me at all.”

“That’s not *true,* Russ!” she shot back, grabbing two fistfuls of her hair in frustration. “How do you not get it by now?”

“Maybe the lying has confused me!” I shot back, my heart racing.

She covered her face. Kimmy looked so small in that moment; I had always felt like her protector, and it crushed me to know that she had never needed it. 

“I liked you *because* you were going to get your ass kicked, and you flew to my side anyway. I thought it was cute. I thought *you* were cute.”

We paused.

“Well, I guess I am kind of charming, from a certain point of view.”

We looked at each other. Pissed as I was, she still made my heart flutter.

“We’re not supposed to marry outside of our kind,” she continued. “So I told myself that I wasn’t falling for you, that it was only a fling. But you were always so desperate for just *one* more date.”

I shrugged. “You were the hottest girl I’d ever gone out with. I wanted to keep seeing you.”

Her nostrils flared. “I know. And it caught me by surprise when that approach made *me* want to keep seeing *you*.” She closed her eyes. “My Tribe had been in this town 106 years when you and I got married in 2019. Our current matron is a woman named Charybdis. When I told her that you and I were getting married, she nearly excommunicated me.” Kimmy rubbed her upper arms, glancing around, anxious. “I was advised not to have children – and that if I did, and that child had Abilities, that I would have to take the baby and leave you.”

A chill settled in my stomach. “And if the baby couldn’t do your…  magic shit?”

Her face went blank. “Then I would have to surrender it to Charybdis for a Devouring.”

I wanted to puke. “Does that mean-”

“Exactly what it sounds like.”

“Shit.”

“Yeah.”

Kimmy took in a deep breath before staring up at the dark sky. Though she sat just a few feet away from me, my wife was half-obscured in shadow as the moon revealed only what parts of her it saw fit. “I told myself that I wouldn’t get pregnant. Then,” her voice trembled, “I *did* get pregnant, and everything changed.” She blinked quickly. “Sometimes, there are only wrong answers, and you have to pick what burns your loved ones the least.”

“I’m hoping that means you were never going to feed Ella to your Tribe.”

Kimmy glared at me. “No.”

“So you were just going to wait and see if she had Abilities, then run out on me either way.”

Her face melted in sadness. “What better decision could I have made?” she asked, her voice pleading.

I folded my arms. “You could have told me the truth, and we’d have run away together, Kim!”

She closed her eyes and shook her head, wavy hair bouncing. “They would have chased us, and you’d have gotten your ass kicked immediately, Russ. What’s the point in starting a lifetime journey that would kill you in one night?”

“Because some things are worth getting your ass kicked for!” I shouted, rising to my feet. “In high school, all I did was play video games and gobble bean burritos six hours a day. Do you know the last time I played a video game?”

“Yesterday,” she deadpanned. 

“Yeah, but for only like twenty minutes! Kimmy, I *can’t* go back to a time before you and Ella were the greatest inconveniences in my life!”

The dappled moonlight couldn’t hide her beaming smile. I wanted that fact to make me happy. But a chill crawled up my spine from the inside, licking the crevices between each vertebra as it worked its way into my skull. The fear lapped like a cat, just like a hungry cat, at the vulnerable folds of my brain. Kimmy’s smile turned to abject horror. 

I didn’t want to turn around. If my wife and daughter weren’t nearby, I’m sure I would have died browning my underpants as I ran away screaming. 

But I had to face what was behind me. 

My heart didn’t just fall; it melted. The creature almost would have been human if it didn’t have a circular wound where her mouth should have been; it looked like a vertical Sarlacc pit. When she spoke, her words made me feel like I was receiving an unsolicited rimjob from a snowman.

“Touching story,” she clucked. “Ridiculous, but touching.”

“Russ,” Kimmy whispered in a voice that sounded like cracking glass, “it’s Charybdis.”

I wanted to say something clever, but my mouth wouldn’t make the words go.

“We had an agreement,” Charybdis croak-slurped. “It will be honored, with or without your consent.”

My world changed as she stepped closer, casting moonlight over her full figure. Satan only knows what supernatural abilities this thing had, because she had taken our daughter without either of us noticing, and now held a sleeping Ella in her arms.

“Please,” Kimmy begged, too broken for tears.

“I have a right to the child,” Charybdis pressed, stepping closer. “Are you going to resist, Kim – or will you make a prudent choice for the first time in your life?”

“Look – I don’t know what fucked-up supernatural methods you’ll use to beat the shit out of me, though I know it’s going to suck,” I roared, afraid of my own false bravery. “But you have *no* right to my daughter.”

Charybdis cocked her head. “Kim? He seems confused. Can you explain to him why I very much have a right to this child?”

I didn’t want to take my eyes off of Charybdis – but even without looking behind me, I could tell that Kimmy was hyperventilating. 

I clenched my fists, praying that Ella would stay asleep as I died. 

“Russ,” Kimmy gasped, her words coming in short bursts, “She’s been hunting for Ella since she was born. [Charybdis is my mother](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”
