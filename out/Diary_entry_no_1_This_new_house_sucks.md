On top of that, my parents are making me "write my thoughts and feelings down" even though they know I hate writing and no one is going to even read this. I guess this is something they found on one of those magazines that give tips on how to be a better parent. 

The only thing that is a plus is that we moved near the beach, and let me say Miami beaches beat New York beaches. Well, i can't compare them yet, It's the middle of December!

Diary entry no. 2.

I finally finished unpacking, and I found a lot of awesome stuff from my past like my teddy bear from when I was 5 and my gameboy advance from ages ago. My parents let me hook up my Wii to my own TV in my room! I stayed up all night playing Wii sports until my parents came into my room and forced me to turn the TV off and write in my diary before bed.

Diary entry no. 3. 

I started school today. The middle school was bigger than any school I've ever seen. Also I made new friends, kind of. Some fellow 8th graders gave me a map of the city and marked a corner of a park next to a forest and told me to meet them there, some sort of initiation, I guess. I asked my parents, and they said I could go since I was going to be with a group.

Diary entry no. 4.

After school, I rode my BMX bicycle to the park that was half a mile away. I got lost a few times, but the map helped me. When I got to the corner of the park next to the forest, I didn't see them, so I locked my bicycle, sat down, and decided to write a new entry. I am that bored.

Diary entry no. 5.

After a half hour of waiting, they finally show up. 

"Hey James, over here." Jack, the leader of the group, yelled out to me.

I nodded my head and ran over to them, excited to spend time with new people. When I got to him, he said that we were going into the woods to a secret hangout spot. 

We walked for about 10 minutes until we saw a rusty run-down fence that was falling over. We crossed the fence, and inside, it was an old little league baseball stadium. The group and I sat down on some rusty bleacher.

"So how do you like this spot?" Asked Sam. He had bright green hair, and that's the only way I remembered his name.

"It's pretty chill." I say, trying to sound as cool as possible.

We sat there for a couple of minutes, talking as they were asking me questions about what it was like where I used to live.

After walking around the forest some more, we exit it onto a street in the slums. On that street, there was an abandoned hospital that the boys seemed eager to explore. 

The doors were locked pretty hard, but the four of us managed to push it down. 

It had everything you'd expect an abandoned hospital to have. Moldy beds, rusty tools, broken windows, etc.

They found an open door that had stairs that led down to a basement. Alex, the third member of the group dropped his fucking flashlight down the stairs and I think it was on purpose.

"Oops." He said

"James, why don't you go down and get it." Jack said

I didn't want to be a pussy so I walked down the stairs to get it, the basement was dark so I couldn't see anything, however there was a putrid smell but when I got down I stepped on something.

Teeth.

I stepped on teeth. That was my main focus for a second before I heard the slam of a door. I turned around, and I could no longer see the group.

They fucking locked the doors.

I think it's a prank, though, so I'm just going to sit on the stairs and write in my diary until they eventually unlock the door.

Diary entry no. 6.

I HEARD GROANS.

There were groans coming from the basement after a few hours of waiting.

I decided I wasn't going to sit and find out what was there. So I started hitting against the lock with my flashlight until I heard the groans turn into grinding of teeth. The sound of someone grinding their teeth was getting closer and closer, so I started smashing the lock faster and faster. 

When the door opened, I saw a figure on the bottom stair moving his jaw back and forth, making the horrible grinding sound.

I never ran as fast in my life. 

Away from the hospital to the park.

When I got to the park, my bike was gone. The bastards that locked the door stole my bike. 

I had no choice but to sit on top of a slide and wait until morning or until my parents went out looking for me.

Diary entry no. 7.

I HEAR THE GRINDING OF TEETH.

The diary ends here. I am sharing what was written in the diary of James Agusto after this diary was found in a park next to a pile of teeth following the 13 year old's strange disappearance in the winter of 2008
