The livestream froze on a wall of red. For a second, I thought maybe it was just a glitch, some corrupted video feed. Then the screaming cut through my speakers, sharp enough to make me drop my phone.

“Jared?” I whispered, though I knew he couldn’t hear me.

The camera shook violently, tumbling sideways, until it showed part of Jared’s bedroom door. Something slammed against it from the inside—hard enough to splinter the wood.

Then the door exploded open.

I swear to God, what crawled through the doorway was the exact thing I had designed on that website.

Its wings scraped the ceiling. Its eyes glowed like molten fire. It had four arms that moved too fast, claws dragging along the floor, sparking against the wood. And its mouth—Jesus Christ—its mouth opened far wider than a human skull should allow, stuffed with hundreds of teeth grinding against each other like knives.

And Jared was in front of it.

The camera zoomed as if pulled forward. Jared screamed, swinging a lamp. The monster caught it with one claw, crushed it like paper, and lunged.

The stream dissolved into chaos—flashes of torn sheets, blood spraying against walls, a woman’s shrieks cutting off with a wet crunch. The monster moved too fast to process, a blur of wings and claws.

And then—silence.

The room lay in shreds. Blood streaked the floorboards, soaking into the rug. The thing turned its head toward the camera.

It smiled.

Not a human smile. A jagged, awful grin of teeth, as if it was aware of me. Watching me watch it.

Then the screen went black.

I don’t remember breathing for the next minute. My ears rang like I’d been standing near an explosion.

“No,” I whispered. “No, no, no…”

I dialed Jared again. Straight to voicemail.

I tried his wife’s number. Nothing.

My body moved on autopilot—I grabbed my car keys and tore out of my driveway. Jared’s house was only fifteen minutes away. I don’t remember the drive, only the sound of tires screeching as I hit corners too fast.

When I arrived, red and blue lights already painted the street. Neighbors huddled outside, pale and wide-eyed.

Two police cars blocked the driveway. An ambulance sat with its doors wide open, though no one was inside.

I tried to push through the tape, but an officer shoved me back.

“Sir, you can’t be here.”

“That’s my best friend!” I shouted. “Jared Mayhew! Please, just tell me—”

The look in the cop’s eyes told me everything.

The next day’s headlines made me sick.

“Local Couple Brutally Murdered in Suspected Home Invasion.”

The article described a scene that made my stomach twist. “Unidentified attacker.” “Extreme mutilation.” “Authorities searching for possible animal involvement.”

But the details—oh God, the details—they matched exactly what I had ordered. Jared’s wife had been found “torn in half.” Jared himself had “multiple bite marks inconsistent with any known animal.”

I designed that. With a goddamn drop-down menu.

And then I noticed something worse.

A new email.

From MonsterCall.

SUBJECT: THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLACE ANOTHER?

I deleted it instantly. Slammed my laptop shut. But no matter what I did, I couldn’t shake the image of that grin. The way it seemed to look through the camera, right at me.

That night, I barely slept. Every creak in my house made me jolt awake. At one point, I swear I heard scratching at my bedroom window.

When I finally drifted into a half-sleep, my phone buzzed.

Another email.

“Your monster is still hungry.”
