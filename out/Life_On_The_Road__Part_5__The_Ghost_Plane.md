Even though my life was one dedicated to always being on the move, I rarely rode a plane somewhere. Driving across North America was easy enough. I wasn’t in a hurry to get anywhere nor had much of a desire to go to more tropical locations. Besides for work, I never thought about booking a flight.  

A request came in asking me to investigate a certain odd sighting of a plane that started to appear at airports. There was a bit of a pattern to the sightings, and The Corporation was fairly certain this mystery plane was real. I normally only got called if they needed someone to confirm certain cases or gather information. An agent should be the one dispatched to tracking down this plane, but none were available.  

They offered to cover any costs for this trip including food and hotel rooms so I took the request. My new job was to hang around airports waiting for what they dubbed the Ghost Plane to appear and then try to board it. From what I’ve been told, pilots saw the plane appear out of thin air at day break. Some thought the Ghost Plane may crash into their plane causing a bit of a shock to the passengers when they moved off course trying to avoid something that wasn’t there. A few people even were able to get on the empty Ghost Plane. They were the only ones on the flight, not even the attendants. By some miracle the plane got them to where they needed to go and the airport staff didn’t have a clue on how someone who missed their flight suddenly appeared at the gate of the plane that they never boarded. 

Overall, it all sounded harmless. But I knew that when it came the supernatural, things don’t always turn out well. At least I was the one who took this job. If there was danger waiting, I would stay alive through it. But I worried over the outcome. What if the plane decided it didn’t want to land? Would I get trapped on it forever? Just flying through the air completely alone? This job wasn’t ideal but then again, none of them really are. 

I was told the most likely airport the Ghost Plane would appear at based on the reports and scattered known bits of the flight pattern The Corporation picked up. I walked inside the busy building getting acquainted with all the gate locations. Since I don’t fly often, I wasn’t sure if airports liked having a strange man wondering around for hours between different gates. The managers were told a lie beforehand that gave me whatever access I needed. I even was given an official looking lanyard to flash in case any staff got on my case.  

I was also provided with a credit card for food. It was very tempting to splurge on new paperback books and overpriced coffee. I just got the basics I needed but did treat myself to a cinnamon bun. I think the airport air made them taste better. 

I pretty much lived inside that airport for two days. Nothing strange happened the first night. I’ve slept on worst surfaces before, but curling up on one of the uncomfortable seats and using a jacket as a blanket wasn’t pleasant. My entire body was stiff by the second day of walking. By one in the morning on the second night I was so tired I nearly gave up to find a hotel room. A sound of heels on the tile floor and my name snapped me out of my sleepy state. 

“I was told to come get you if something odd happened and well... this is odd.” An attendant told me in a concerned voice. 

I followed her and listened while we made our way over to an empty gate. 

“A plane showed up at this gate ten minutes ago. It’s locked but the weird thing is, no one saw it landing. In fact, all the strips would have been busy by the time it would have landed. Someone should have either run right into it, or saw something. It’s not possible it just sat outside all day without anyone noticing.” She explained.  

The odd sight drew in a small crowd of the overnight workers. None of them understood how the plane appeared out of thin air or what to do from there. I could see the mystery plane from the wall of windows just beside the gate. It looked normal besides the lack of any company logo on the side. A pair stood next to the gate doors, debating on if they wanted to go inside. One wore a neatly pressed suit and I assumed he was a manager. I quickly went over to take over. 

“I’ll go inside. You all stay here.” I said hoping I sounded confident. 

“Is that safe? Should we be calling the police?” The man asked. 

A set of TFA agents were walking over to the small crowd. The manager must have wanted them to go on first instead of a stranger with unknown credentials. I took action before he could call the police to muddle this entire job. I walked through the hallway, the manager and some people calling me back. I waved a hand over my shoulder but didn’t look at them to let them see how scared I felt walking towards the mystery plane. 

“I know what I'm doing. If I don’t come back out in an hour then you can call some higher ups.” I called back.  

That was a lie. I had no idea what to do. I should have called in a real agent to deal with this. But they were on short supply and wouldn’t get here fast enough. The plane could disappear at any time. Plus, more people might see the mystery plane causing the cover up to be more of a hassle. No, I needed to do what I could to deal with the problem. Even if I didn’t know what just yet. 

I stopped at the end of the short hallway expecting a locked door on the other side. The girl who got me did say the plan was locked. Instead, I stared at an open door, the entrance inviting me inside. I took a second to push down my fear then walked onto the plane. After all, people had been on an empty flight without any issues. Why would my flight be any different? 

I didn’t get very far inside when the door shut on its own behind me. I nearly was knocked off my feet by the entire plane shifting suddenly. I caught myself on a seat and was helpless to stop the massive steel monster from starting to slowly move down the runway. This was bad. Very bad. Why the hell did I agree to this job? I tried the door in vain, then start to run down the aisle way looking for any possible way out.  

By the time I went up and down the entire plane, we were already in the air. I saw the lights of the city below through the small windows as I raced past. There was no one besides myself. No luggage, nothing useful. I found a few emergency doors that refused to open not matter how hard I tried. I checked my phone to see if I could call for help. The screen flickered in a way that made my stomach drop. Phones and magic did not mix at all. I’ve been through enough broken and fried cellphones to know what one looked like when it was suffering from being shorted out from magic in the air. I knew that this plane wasn't normal, but I never would have assumed it held so much power to kill a cellphone given to me by The Corporation. They made it to hold up around monsters who oozed power and yet this plane bricked it. 

Even a normal person who didn’t have a clue about magic could feel the power in the plane. I got uneasy right away. This was officially above my paygrade. Since I already was there, I might as well look around. I don’t fly often. I really didn’t know what planes looked like on the onside beside a long row of seats. I started from the back to the front checking every corner I could see. The bathrooms ran just fine, at least I wouldn’t die of thirst. The small kitchen area held some food and drinks. At least enough food for a few weeks. God, would I get stuck here for that long? I really didn’t want that to be the case. 

Unable to help myself, I found a seat in first class to sit down and check my phone again. I wouldn’t be able to be in a seat like this any time soon. I might as well take the chance when I had it. Aside from the normal sounds of the massive machine, there wasn’t any other noise. I looked out the window seeing nothing but darkness. We did take off in the middle of the night. The sun wouldn't rise for a few more hours trapping me in the dark. Even if I could see outside, I wouldn’t know where we were headed.  

I wasted time trying to open the cockpit without any luck. There wasn’t much to do on an empty plane. I stole a soda from the kitchen area to look around a second time with. For some reason, the idea to narrate my actions came to mind. I doubted anyone would be listening. But just in case, this might alert whatever creature made this plane suddenly appear that they picked up someone. 

“This is pretty boring you know. Nothing to do. I didn’t even find those little peanuts. Have they stopped giving them out?” I asked not expecting an answer. 

I sighed hearing no response. I kept talking to myself about nothing much. Another idea came to mind. Normally when I mentioned I worked with The Corporation creatures reacted. They were either afraid of it, or hated agents for pretty valid reasons. I also got some negative responses when I said some creatures looked cute. But I wasn’t that weird to think planes could be attractive. I had some odd tastes, but not that weird. 

“Hey so, I work for The Corporation. We just wanna know what you’re doing and all that. If you could answer-” 

The plane suddenly dipped making me lose my footing and spill the drink in my hand. I scrambled trying to get back up. Being in a plane that changed course even in the slightest was scary as hell. I don’t care who you are. I couldn't really die but that didn’t mean I wanted to go through a fiery crash. 

I got back to my feet seeing that something changed. A person stood in the aisle. I should have been glad to see someone but nope. They weren’t a person. Just a black solid shape holding a very sharp weapon. I turned on my heel to run. Aside from hiding in the bathroom I didn’t have a plan.  

Another black shape cut off my path towards my only safe spot in the entire damn plane. Turning around wasn't an option. I ran past the newly formed figure, barely squeezing past it. Thank God I often didn’t have the money to spend on three good meals a day. I thought I saw a second bathroom near first class I just needed to keep running. My heart hammered through my chest from the short sprint. 

The plane dipped causing my feet to slip again., So many of those dark passengers appeared out of the floor and between seats. When I fell, I landed on one that halfway crawled out of the floor. With the dark knife it held point upwards. 

I felt the blade slide into my stomach, and thought I saw an expression of shock on the blank face. Due to adrenaline, I didn’t feel the pain. I steadied myself, holding the knife still as I ran. My body slammed against the cockpit door unaware of how I got there. My head swam from shock and fear. Within seconds those figures would overtake me. I stood helpless watching them press onwards. 

The door opened making me spill inside the small space. I quickly closed the door, locking it with shaking hands. Blood from the stab wound poured down my leg. The knife disappeared after being too far away from the host. I looked over my shoulder to see someone sitting in one of the seats. I collapsed in the other, light headed from lack of blood and pain. 

I glanced over at the pilot expecting him to be like the ones outside. Instead, he just looked like any regular person you might meet on the street. I placed a hand over my wound trying in vain to keep pressure on it. I knew I was going to die. I just hope we landed before then. 

“Are you...” I started to ask the man sitting next to me. 

He didn’t look over. He shushed me, his blue eyes glued on the window in front of us. A small white pin on his hat caught the light. I turned my head just in time to see the sun rising. The light pouring over the clouds and sea. If you haven’t seen the sun, come up while in the air. I recommended it. The sight was one of the most beautiful things I've seen. For a few seconds I forgot about my pain to focus on just that light. All at once, I understood the person sitting next to me. 

“I just want to see the sun every day. That’s all.” The pilot said, his voice calm and even. 

Both his and the plane’s only purpose was to see this sight. Over and over again. He wasn’t a man hungry monster, or dangerous. He just wanted a simple thing. The only reason why the plane made those figures to attack me as just to hopefully scare away anyone from trying to take down this plane. I doubted any of them wanted to actually hurt me. I just slipped. A guilty look came over his face when he saw how much blood stained my clothing. My eyes started to get heavy and everything felt so damn cold. 

“It’s not fair...” I said, words barely above a whisper. 

The Corporation would take down this plane. He risked getting in the path of another in flight either crashing it or spreading rumors certain people didn’t want out. Supernatural things and humans didn’t mix, no matter how harmless their intentions may be.  

“I’m landing shortly. Just hold on.” 

I shook my head wanting to tell him it was fine. It didn’t matter if I died or not. If he landed now, he wouldn’t be able to see the sun rise again and that scared me. My body failed me, sending me down into a darkness I hated. 

I did die. But not on the plane. He landed and I appeared at a gate with people around. They got me stable and in the hospital. The Corporation sent and agent to review my situation. They knew the wound needed time to heal so their agent killed me in the hospital bed. A bit rude if you ask me. I woke up perfectly fine the next day to find The Corporation doing a lot of paper work to cover up my absence from the hospital. 

I got a call a few days later from an agent I hadn’t met before asking for a quick talk. We found a food stall to meet at. His suit not really the attire for people who ate in this location. I ordered something to sit with him for a few minutes. He looked like one of 340’s brother. Honestly, he had so many I wasn’t surprised. 

“I wanted to tell you the outcome of the so-called Ghost plane.” The Agent started. 

I offered him my fries and he broke character to accept them. He ate a few then pulled out a small ring box. He opened it showing me the pin I noticed the pilot wearing.  

“You know about the magic streams, correct?” He asked finishing off the fires. 

I nodded. I knew about the streams. Or, heard about it. It was pretty complex so I only had a vague idea of it. Some places, like mountains or deep woods held a lot of magic. It’s a good reason why creatures lived there. The magic of the world flows out of them in streams that change with the season, or for other unknown reasons.  

“This pin was made form a bone of some sort of powerful creature. A pilot wore it, then as a tradition handed it down to the next person. We’re not certain of how long they wore it. But due to it always following or being near the magic streams it absorbed a bunch through the years. The last pilot kept the pin hidden in a decommissioned plane because he didn’t have someone to pass it along to, I guess. The pin wanted to fly again, so took over that broken down plane. Simple as that.” 

To him this had been a simple case. I bet he dealt with a lot of stranger things than a pin wanting to fly again. I crossed my arms wondering what would happen to it now. 

“Is it going to be locked away or something?” I asked the Agent. 

He shook his head placing the box in the table between us.  

“We drained some magic out of it. It’s not dangerous. I wanted to offer it to you. It’s not useful for your travels but...” He trailed off unable to say the real reason why he made the offer. 

He heard the pin wanted to see the sun rise and wanted to ensure that happened. I couldn't die after all. Agent’s lives were short. There wasn’t any guarantee he made it to the next day. As much as I wanted to keep it, I shook my head. I reached over to take the pin out feeling the bone carved into the shape of a wing. I then put it on his suit jacket before he protested. 

“I can’t form any habits. This thing is pretty much alive at this point. It means it can die. I don’t want it to get hurt so it’s better if you’re the one to take it. It’ll be a good luck charm. You both can see the sun rise together.” I told him. 

He gave the idea some thought. He let himself smile in a way most of his brothers didn’t. If he died, I felt certain this pin would be handed to the next sibling. I bought him a meal to go, which he greatly appreciated. I really wished he had a long life after our meeting. 

I checked my phone seeing a new request come in. I hadn’t really recovered from the plane case yet, but my bank account wasn’t entirely full. I accepted it, feeling dread about the next job. At least now I knew to stop to watch a sun rise once and a while because there are some people in this world that can’t do the same.
