Everyone goes through changes as they become a teenager, but after educating myself on those changes, I realized that I didn't go through the normal ones.

I grew up in a very rich household, one where we had hired multiple maids. However, my parents are kind and generous souls. They treat us, our maids, and everyone around them with love, care, and respect. They made sure to raise me and my sister to treat others as they do, and for the most part, it worked. My sister, let's call her Sophia, was friendly, outgoing, funny, and she tried her best to be kind. I was more of the shy and reserved type, but I try to stay polite and respectful, as I was raised to do. 

 We have a maid, let's call her Joy, who has been working with us for years. She isn't perfect, but she is reliable and tries her best. However, after Sophia turned 13, apparently Joy was not good enough for Sophia. Sophia would frequently point out every little,  irrelevant mistake that Joy made. It became so bad that I would sometimes catch Joy alone, sobbing about how she is worthless to the family. I came to comfort her, letting Joy know that I would confront my parents about Sophia's behavior. I went to talk to my parents, and the conversation went as follows:

"Mom, Dad, I have to talk to you about Sophia. She has been acting really mean to Joy lately. It makes Joy sad, and that makes me sad. You have to stop her," I told my parents. I expected my parents to say something such as "don't worry honey, we will talk to her about it," and then Sophia would eventually stop. Their real response surprised me.

"Oh? So she's been acting different lately?" my father looked at my mother, as if they knew something I didn't. My mother nodded her head. "Well, she's just been going through something called puberty, that's all. It's when a person is transitioning from being a child into an adult. You might think she is "becoming a monster," but she just has to grow into being an adult. It's an awkward phase that you'll have to go through when you turn 13," she explained.

"Aren't you going to stop her? She is being a bully! Also, am I going to become a bully when I'm older?" I asked in a worried tone.

 "Well, "puberty" affects us all differently. It may effect Sophia the way it affects her because of her personality. You are such a mature and polite girl for your age, so I'm sure that nothing too bad will happen to you when you're older. Also, I'm afraid that there's nothing we can do about Sophia and Joy. Just continue comforting Joy, alright?" my father asked, smiling at me. I looked down, and nodded my head. I couldn't argue with them, they're usually right. I just hoped that this "puberty" thing would end quickly. However, it only worsened. Sophia had became bossy, bratty, and selfish towards everyone she knew. I tried to remain patient with her. I think I lost that ability when I turned 13.

I began to act different, it was like I gained a personality seperate from my own. I became very protective over Joy, violently lashing out when Sophia mistreated her. Me and Sophia's relationship began to break apart because of that. We became so fed up with each other, that we stopped talking to each other for good. As my and Sophia's relationship got worse, so did how I treated others. I became the weird, creepy, and violent girl at school. I lost all my friends, got into fights, and became very unpopular. I didn't know what was happening to me, most words that came out of my mouth felt as if they weren't even my own. And somehow, my jerk sister was pretty, popular, and had lots of friends. I decided to confront my parents about this again. The conversation went as follows:

"Mom, dad, what is going on with me? I've been acting like a huge jerk to everyone without even trying. It feels like I'm no longer myself anymore. How do I fix this?" I asked them. I had already scripted out what they were going to say to me in my head. They were going to give me another lesson in morals and ethics, how I could be a good person and do the right thing. Instead, they gave me another surprising response.

"When you turn 18, you'll go back to normal. So will Sophia. Picture this: There are two of "you" in one body. One of you is the person you knew growing up, the other is the "monster" you gained. When you turn 18, you two will come to accept each other, and be able to utilize each other. Just be patient, you'll eventually grow into your body," my mother explained to me. My parents, who carefully made sure to turn us into perfect children, now let me and Sophia attack the world around us with no consequences. However, I couldn't argue with them. They knew what they were talking about. Until the last straw, Joy.

I was Joy's only friend, and Joy was my only friend.  We were two outcasts who need each other. The difference between me and her, was that I deserved to be an outcast. She didn't. I deserved no friends. She did. But I think she recognized that she needed friends who weren't creepy, possessive, and out-of-control teenage girls. She confronted me and told me that I haven't been a good friend to her, and talking to me felt like she was being controlled, like how Sophia would control her. I lashed out at her, for daring to compare me to somebody like Sophia. I argued to Joy that I was the reason Sophia didn't boss her around like she used to. I called her selfish, I accused her of taking the protection I gave her for granted. This made Joy run away, crying.

Right after Joy ran away, Sophia walked in. 

"So, you've finally gotten rid of the maid too? You're an embarrassment to this family, Jessica," Sophia giggled, "you're hair is a mess, and your skin is oily and gross. Why would you think that Joy would actually want to be around somebody like you?"

Sophia was right. My tangled, dirty blonde rat's nest couldn't compare to her gorgeous, brunette waves. She had clear skin with a perfect tan, and a face that didn't even require makeup to look gorgeous. I was happy for her, but the other part of me was envious. This is the only reason people like her. She didn't deserve it. I'll have to take it away someday.

"What do you want?!" I snapped at her.
     
"I just wanted to let you, don't go anywhere near me tomorrow, at my 18th birthday party. Don't go looking for Joy either, she isn't going to want to see you," Sophia said with a smirk. 

"How do you know she won't? What if I do decide to look for her?" I replied.

"You'll regret it, trust me," Sophia said as she turned around to walk away. 

I was planning to just sit in my room the entire party. Nobody from school liked me a whole lot, and parties weren't really my thing anyways. However, I remembered what Sophia said about Joy. It made me a little curious, so I decided to go to the party to look for her. Joy wasn't at the party, which wasn't a surprise. What was surprising is that Sophia wasn't there, at her own party. I left the party to go look for them. I walked around the mansion until I heard what sounded like a muffled scream from one of the rooms. I peeked inside, and I think what I saw is going to scar me for life.
 
There was a creature convered in some sort of murky green slime. The slime had a horrible smell, like that of a rotting dead body. The slime was staining the carpets and the clothes of the person that was there was it. It was Joy. 

A hand made of slime was extended, lifting Joy into the air and covering her mouth up. "Do you really think somebody is going to come and save you?" the creature asked. I recognized the voice almost immediately. However, I couldn't bring myself to do anything but stand and watch.

The creature opened it's mouth. It's mouth looked much to big to even fit on a human body, and was filled with razor sharp teeth. I'll spare you guys the details of what happened after looked like, but the scene still haunts my nightmares to this day. Suddenly, adrenaline rushed through my body. Sophia could not find out I this. I sprinted as fast as my wobbly legs could carry me, and ran into the bathroom to throw up. When I was finished, I went back into my room to process what I just saw. 

I was 16 then, at the party. Nowadays, I notice symptoms of my own. Some days my teeth are sharper then usual. Sometimes I will find a strange green substance coming out of my skin. Sometimes I have strange, murderous urges. The worst part is, in a few days, my parents are going to throw me a party for my 18th birthday.
