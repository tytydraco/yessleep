The Call of the Forgotten

Timeframe: Around 2010 or 2011. I was about 12 or 13 years old, and it was during my school break for exams. One ordinary day, my mother came to me and said, "Masum, your cousin's mother-in-law has passed away. We need to go."

The news left me with an unexpected weight in my heart. I had never met this woman before, and now I never would. The finality of death struck me in a way that filled the air around me with a deep, unsettling silence.

We left quickly to attend the mourning. On the way, I learned that the funeral prayers and burial had already taken place. My cousin, who was about my age, was there as well, and we shared a few words. All around us, the atmosphere was thick with grief and sorrow. Yet, there was something else—something unsettling—about the way the sadness lingered in the air.

Not wanting to remain in the suffocating environment, I decided to take a walk with my cousin.

The Eerie Encounter
At the edge of the garden was a small family cemetery, where dusk was beginning to settle in. From a distance, I noticed an old woman standing in one corner of the graveyard. She was draped in a white sari, leaning on a walking stick. A cold, eerie feeling crept up my spine, freezing the air around me.

Her gaze—so unnervingly fixed—made me stop in my tracks. I thought she might be a relative of the deceased, but there was something unnatural about her. Her eyes never blinked, and her stare seemed to pierce right through me. Feeling uneasy, I quickly moved away, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that her eyes were following me.

The Night of the Milad (Prayer Gathering)
Two days later, there was a prayer gathering, or Milad. The house was still full of sorrow, but the atmosphere seemed even stranger. It felt as if something, unseen but very real, was slowly creeping closer.

Throughout the gathering, I couldn't stop thinking about the old woman from the graveyard. Her cold, emotionless stare haunted me, stirring a deep and inexplicable fear within. But I said nothing.

On the third night, something happened that I cannot forget. I was by the pond, washing my hands and face, when I heard a thin voice behind me. I turned around, and there she was—the same old woman in white, standing at the edge of the cemetery. This time, she was closer, and I could see the shadow of death in her eyes. She gestured toward me with a bony hand.

For a moment, I thought she was asking for help. But as I moved toward her, a bone-chilling fear paralyzed me. It was as if I knew that taking even one more step toward her would pull me into a darkness I could never escape. I turned and ran, terrified, back to the house.

A Night of Terror
That night, I went to bed, trying to put the whole ordeal out of my mind. But sleep didn’t bring peace.

I awoke to an ice-cold touch on my leg. When I opened my eyes, she was there—standing at the foot of my bed, smiling in a way that made my blood freeze. Her lips moved in a barely audible whisper, but her eyes never left mine. I was completely paralyzed, unable to move or scream. She leaned in closer, and I could feel myself slipping into an overwhelming darkness.

I recited every prayer I could think of in my head, but nothing seemed to work. Her hand slowly reached toward my foot, and I could feel my consciousness fading. Just as I felt myself being pulled into a void, I screamed, waking my mother, who rushed into the room. The old woman had vanished, but the terror she left behind lingered.

The Ominous Voice
The next evening, I went to the store. Dusk was setting in, and as I passed by the old cemetery—something I had done countless times before—I heard it again. That same frail voice, "Come... come to me..."

I froze, fear shooting through my body. When I turned, there she was again, standing near the graveyard, motioning toward me. Her eyes burned with a strange mixture of rage and longing.

Panic gripped me, and I ran. Halfway down the road, I tripped over something and hit my head hard. When I came to, it felt like an ominous presence was watching me, surrounding me.

Seeking Help
The next day, I went to the local imam and told him everything. He listened carefully and then said, "This is not a normal occurrence. You must pray to God for protection. Only He can keep you safe." He gave me a protective amulet, instructing me to wear it at all times.

For a few months, things returned to normal. But the fear—the feeling of that cold gaze—never truly went away. And then, one night, it all began again...

Conclusion: The Haunting Lingers

This experience marked me deeply. It left me questioning the boundaries between the living and the dead, the seen and the unseen. To this day, I can’t explain what happened, but the memory of that old woman—her cold eyes and the chilling presence that followed her—remains vivid in my mind. I’ve learned that not everything can be explained by logic or reason. Some things are simply beyond our understanding.

Perhaps the dead do call to us in ways we cannot comprehend. And perhaps, sometimes, it’s best not to answer.

Key Takeaways:

Not all encounters with the supernatural are meant to be understood.
The line between the living and the dead may not be as clear as we think.
Fear and faith often go hand in hand when dealing with the unknown.
