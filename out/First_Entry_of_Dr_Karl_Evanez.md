Entry 1  

  

My name is Dr. Karl Evanez and this is the log entry of my last case and everything that happened afterwards.  

The body came to me last night at the Berlin Wuhlheide Pathological Institute. I almost put it off until tomorrow, but with the current death toll and this fever, which has never been so high, I could hardly keep up. A dozen virologists demanded a lot of files and brought me an excess of cases.  

So I thought that M. Michael's case was just that, as he had been sent to me again by the Institute for Disease Control. However, this man hardly seemed to have any signs of viruses or bacteria.  

The check of his organs also gave no helpful indication of the cause of death. It seemed as if he had simply dropped dead. How strange for a young, athletic man of 31. Further samples also left me baffled.  

No trace of drugs, cancer, a heart defect or anything else. His file said that the man came to his GP with a high temperature and would have been dead the next day. But I saw no sign of the fever, let alone that he had died from it.  

I looked at the dead man's pale face and slowly opened his eyelids. That's when I noticed the first clue: the pupils were unusually altered, they were larger and looked as if they were elongated.  

Had I missed something? After all the work and tiredness? Was it drugs or a poison after all?  

But all the samples remained negative. I decided to take the body back to the cold store for the time being and take a fresh look at it tomorrow.  

I pushed the stretcher with the body to one side and turned away from it when my cell phone rang.  

My wife called me to find out where I was and started arguing again. I was often not at home because of work and she was already threatening me with divorce. I promised to clean up and come home immediately. She sounded more worried than usual.  

When I turned around, I couldn't believe my eyes. The body was gone. The stretcher was empty and the door to the cold room was still open. I looked around, puzzled. Had I got lost? Had I mixed something up and already put the body away? I had to admit that the stress and fatigue were getting to me. I searched through the cold rooms and checked everything. I was beginning to feel uneasy. The room had an emergency exit and the main entrance was in my field of vision. So someone could only have come in through the emergency exit, but I should have noticed if someone was carrying a body out.  

I went to the emergency exit and noticed that the door was locked. I opened it and looked out into the corridor. There was a long lighted corridor and a door with a small window at the end. It was already dark outside. When I turned around, my blood froze in my veins. A figure was crouching behind my desk. It peeked out and seemed to be watching me. Pale, completely naked and with eyes wide open. I saw a broad, tortured grin on its face. I screamed in panic and slammed the door shut.  

Breathing hastily, I ran through the corridor back to reception.  

“Marie! Marie, call security or the police!”  

I couldn't believe it, but what was sitting there was the body I had examined earlier. Was it my imagination? Or was the man actually still alive?  

My body was shaking and I was barely able to move, but I looked around the corner and noticed that Marie was lying on the floor. She had blood on her face. An automatic sliding glass door led outside, where I saw the figure, naked and upright, walking towards a guard.  

“Stop! Stop or I'll use pepper spray!”  

I bent over Marie, her eyes were open and she was breathing. A low moan escaped from her throat.  

“Marie! Hey Marie!”  

Her heart was still beating. Outside the door, I heard the sound of pepper spray and a choking scream. I didn't notice any change in Marie, apparently she was in some kind of shock. I grabbed the phone and dialed the emergency number.  

“Please come quickly. There's a madman here who's attacking us.”  

I pulled Marie behind the reception desk while the security guard seemed to be struggling with the scary man.  

After a short time, the man stood up and the security guard stopped moving.  

The police drove up and the man stepped towards them as if nothing was wrong.  

A few warning shouts from the police followed until one of them pulled out his gun and fired. There was a loud bang and a bullet hit the sliding glass door. The second policeman came running in.  

I identified myself and shakily raised my hand behind the reception desk.  

“I... I made the call. Please, she's hurt, we need help.”  

“Is there anyone else there? Where did the man come from?”  

“He... he was on my table. He was dead. A corpse, but he got up again.”  

“Don't talk nonsense!” the policeman instructed.  

His colleague ran over, gun in hand.  

“I shot him dead. Is everything all right here?”  

“We have casualties. They both seem to be in shock.”  

“No, please, you have to believe me,” I said as an ambulance was called.  

I noticed that the police officers didn't seem to be listening to me. I looked past them and noticed that only the bloody corpse of the guard was lying on the ground. His face and neck were scratched, his arms were bruised and open, but there was no sign of the walking corpse.  

“Jesus Christ! Look, there's no one out there. The man you shot! He's gone.”  

A voice rang out through the radio of the policeman who had fired the shot.  

“Police Constable Wernher, are you there?”  

He turned around and answered in the affirmative, but then his features slipped.  

“Hey, Arif. He's... He's gone,” said Constable Wernher to his colleague.  

“Mr. Chief Constable! Please answer me. Is everything all right with you?” came from the radio.  

“No, sir! We need support. There's a murderer on the loose. I shot him, he was on the ground and dead, but now he's gone.”  

“Have you made sure he's dead?” it sounded again.  

“One hundred percent. Two shots in the chest and one directly in the neck. Nobody survives that.”  

“Witnesses?”  

“Two, one injured, she's in shock and unresponsive, and he appears to be stable.”  

“Retreat immediately!”  

“What?”  

“Take the witness to the station. You and Constable Kaya come back immediately!”  

“Understood.”  

The policeman Arif Kaya protested.  

“What? We can't just leave.”  

“Orders from above! You there, come with me!” ordered Chief Constable Wernher.  

“But Marie!”  

“The emergency services will come immediately.”  

“Jens! We can't do that,” protested Arif.  

“Orders from above. Come on now and you too, or do I have to force you?”  

I agreed. Arif continued to protest, but also got into the car.  

The policeman Jens drove along the driveway and shook himself.  

“What is it?” his colleague asked.  

“I don't know. A strange feeling came over me.”  

I could see the trees and bushes outside next to the pathology building, it was pitch black outside and somewhere there... was this man.  

The emergency services drove towards us, but we drove on to the police station. Once there, I was questioned about everything that had happened. They didn't answer any of my questions. Only my file on the case was confiscated and I was given an indefinite leave of absence.  

I heard about Marie from a colleague. She died in hospital and the pathologist who examined her disappeared shortly before her funeral.  

At the cemetery, we saw the coffin being lowered into the ground, only I knew that it was empty.
