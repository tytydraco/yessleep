You can read [The First Part](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/SFnOKRkpd5) and [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/Jt5Q9WVc3f) to catch up on my experiences with the train so far.

I have never seen the Driver of the Train to Nowhere. None who have seen him have returned after being escorted to the engine.

Attempting to sneak forward and take a peek has also always failed to yield any results. The Conductor is always blocking the path, a red velvet curtain concealing the form of the one controlling the levers. The conductor, always diligent, will escort the curious wanderer back to the stagecoach saying that the driver cannot be distracted in order for us to make every stop on time.

Those who have attempted to sneak a look while the conductor makes his rounds to the back of the train are always collected and brought back before they could peek behind the curtain.

Among the riders of the Train to Nowhere, there are a few popular theories on what is driving the train. All range from the same type of thing the conductor is to a giant slug that feeds on the secrets of the passengers. I personally prefer the later as the former would be far more terrifying.

On a return trip from Russia, after a fantastic ball hosted by Catherine the Great, a particularly wild group of riders grew a little too excited and jovial. When Phil and I boarded, Sue hadn’t been able to join us for this excursion, the group of rambunctious teens had already been aboard. They were openly, and very loudly, discussing their rabbling at a Speak Easy in Prohibition Era Chicago. The loudest of the group decided to toss one of the now empty mason jars he had in his possession. The jar, which a second earlier or later would have careened wildly out of the open window opposite of them, hit the side of the conductor’s face.

With an audible crack the jar bounced off of the conductor’s face and smashed onto the ground below. The crack had come from the sound of the porcelain face of the conductor taking such a decisive blow. A large chunk fell to the floor and shattered atop the glass already scattered below. His face still held the same happy smile stretched wide, but beneath the outer shell the corner of a furious face beneath was easily identifiable. The sound of excitement and laughter was immediately sucked out of the air as the conductor turned to face the group.

In an incomprehensible movement of stiffness the person responsible for the assault was picked up and carried towards the front of the train. There were no words of discourse or discussion, only an empty seat left behind like a falcon picking up a shrew from a field.

When The Conductor returned no sign of damage could be seen on his face, and no trace of residue altered his appearance. It was as if a pristine replacement had swapped with the man who had just occupied the place of the conductor.

Later when Sue asked how our trip was, we told her only that the ball was fine but we could always return at a later point.

When Sue and Phil left for college, I thought it would be the last of my trips on the Train to Nowhere. However, with the monotony of having to work at the family business, I found myself frequenting the train on my off days when I didn’t have to help my parents with inventory.

With the disappointment of being stuck in a small town with the pressing reality of never leaving, my discontent made for a valuable exchange when paying for my ticket to ride.

When in school, the furthest I had gone was probably Rome, Constantinople, or Pompeii, I now found that those places were easily accessible. What became my midweek vacations, I would visit the magnificent wonders of the ancient world. With every ticket I would hand over to the conductor, I would be escorted to the private carriage at the back of the train. The majority of these passengers were all young adults like myself. I don’t think I ever saw anyone under eighteen waiting to see the more costly sights. While the time I could spend in these places was never as long as the first stop of Egypt, there was an appeal to venturing so far out.

There were on a few of these long trips where there would be an individual seeking the end of the line. While they would mention their intent, none were willing to seek it out when I reboarded for the return trip home.

A man in his late 20s named Andrew had told me that he had every intention of seeing what waited, he got off at the stop beforehand, unwilling to cross that final threshold. 

The Conductor is always eager for those who wish to travel so far out. He always acts overly courteous to those who wish to see the end and have paid the toll to be able to see it. When they disembark earlier than the end, there is always a tinge of disappointment as he bids them a fine time exploring.

The Express ticket I received tempts me. The longer I feel the pull of a boring life in a small town. The thought of what could be at the end both intrigues and dissuades me. Plenty of adventurous souls sought immortality in the cemetery and never returned. Was the same true for The Train to Nowhere as well?

Perhaps I should talk with my parents about taking a trip to see Phil and Sue off in college. A chance to put the town and the train out of my mind. Maybe getting out of the town will help clear my mind in a way that the train never could.

There was a sound coming from the engine the last time I boarded for the return trip home. A soft gurgling and groaning as metal shifted back and forth. The sounds of faint murmuring whispered the secrets of thousands of untold truths. 

I began to walk towards the front of the train, the conductor absent from view. As I neared the velvet curtain I could hear the voice from within calling me to peek behind and see all the truths that were hidden from me.

It was as my hand hovered inches from the curtain that The Conductor ushered me back to the stagecoach. No malice in his voice, no hint of disapproval.

Only the words…

“Please don’t bother the driver at this time, Sir.”
