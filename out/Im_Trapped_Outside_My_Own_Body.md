“You need a hobby,” said Sal.

He saw me eyeing the girl at the end of the bar.

“I got a hobby,” I laughed, still watching her.

“I meant something besides...well you know,” he replied. 

“Maybe a hobby with more meaning, something you find interesting,” he continued. 

“What? My current hobby isn't interesting enough?” I asked.

“Obviously not, if it was enough, I wouldn't have to have to hear you bitch every night about how much your life sucks,” Sal replied.

“Fuck off Sal,” I replied, unable to hide my annoyance.

Sal and I worked together, a simple office job. The pay was good and hours were a simple nine to five. Once we got out of work for the day we always went to the same bar for a few drinks. Life wasn’t bad...it was just so fucking boring. Every year that fled us, I got more and more depressed. Is this all I am ever going to do?  For the rest of my life? 

Sal and I always talked about this, usually started by me. For some reason he never had the same fear as me. Though he understood my frustration in life, he was still so content with his. It drove me mad. How the fuck was he so content with everything? We were both single, never married, never had any kids. Hell we both never even left our city, let alone state. We both followed the same path in life. Graduated high school, went to college, and then got a “good” but boring ass job. Our parents must have been so…”proud”.

“It sucks man. I feel like a goddamn goldfish, swimming in circles until it's time to be flushed down the toilet,” I said. 

“Come on, it's not so bad,” Sal replied. “We got a comfortable living,” he finished.

Sal always tried to be the voice of reason. 

“Thats the fucking problem! It’s comfortable. Comfortable usually means boring,” I said.

“Take a vacation then,”

“That’s only temporary,”.

“Go back to school and get a new degree”

“Takes too much time and money”.

“Oh for fucks sake! Sell drugs and become a kingpin then! Like ‘Breaking Bad’!” Sal finally said in exasperation. 

“Hmmm maybe I should!” I replied, trying to sound sarcastic.

Sal didn't know if I was joking or not.

“That was sarcasm,” I mocked.

At that moment, I noticed the girl get up and start walking towards us. My heart jumped a bit in excitement. I opened my mouth to say something, but she quickly cut me off.

“I'm not here for that,” she quickly said. 
My smile disappeared. 

“Oh my god, shut down!” Sal laughed.

“Shut the fuck up Sal, ” I frustratedly said. 

“What can we do for you then?” I asked her.
 
“I didn't mean to, but I couldn't help overhearing what you guys were talking about. Your friend is right you need a hobby,” she said.

“Wow what great insight! My problems are fucking solved!” I said, my tone dripping with sarcasm.

“Let me finish, asshole. I was in a similar situation as you. I tried a lot of crazy shit to bring some excitement to my life. Nothing worked until I tried one thig that changed my life forever,” she said

“What...what did you do?” Sal asked in a quiet and nervous tone.

She smiled.

“Tell me, what do you guys know about astral projection?”




I started laughing. I was never a religious or spiritual person, so that was my first instinct. 

“What is that, like meditation?” I asked.
She smiled.

“It’s...a method. A way for your spirit to temporarily leave your body,” she answered.

Sal looked very uncomfortable. He was always a religious man who took his faith seriously. 

“That sounds like the work of the devil. Your soul is only supposed to leave your body when you die,” he quietly said.

She turned to him.

“Maybe this has nothing to do with god or the devil. We, humans, are spiritual beings in a universe we know nothing about. This is just a way to possibly help us gain some new insight on life,” she replied to him.

Sal didn't reply. He just stared at her with the same nervous look. 

I laughed again. 

“You guys are both hilarious arguing over different fairy tales. Tell you what, if I ever drop acid or some other crazy drug Ill try your little astral projection. It should be fun in that state of mind,” I said with another inconsiderate laugh.

“Look you're the one complaing about life. Im just offering you something to try. You don't have to believe in it, but there's no harm in trying something new, especially in your state of mind,” she said.

“You boys enjoy your night,” she said and turned to leave.

“Wait what's your name?” I asked her.

“It doesn't matter, we won't see each other again,” she cooly replied. 

And with that she was gone. Sal looked more relaxed now that she left.

“Look I know your not a believer but no matter what, do not listen to her. Her idea is...dangerous,” Sal suddenly said.

“Whatever Sal, you know I think both of you are full of shit,” I replied.

“Good,” he simply said.

I lied. It's true I didn't believe either of them, but part of me was interested. I always prided myself on being as logical as possible. It's why I called myself an agnostic. Sure I didn’t believe in a god, or gods for that matter, but I admit I was to stupid to say they don't exist either. I wasn’t arrogant, just because I didn't believe in anything outside this life, that doesn’t mean there isn't anything out there. I hated to admit it, but this whole “astral projection” did peek my intrest. 

When I arrived home I went online and read all I could about it. It was like she said. Astral Projection was a way for your spirit or soul to leave your body for a time. All sources said something different about where your soul goes. Some say you just remain in this world but can go anywhere you choose. Others said you move into the world of purgatory. Another source said you enter another dimension and can see the true nature of the universe.

“What a bunch of bull. What the fuck am I doing?” I scolded myself. 

I turned off the computer and went to bed, I had work early the next day. All night I tossed and turned. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the girl from the bar and what she said. The worst thought entered my head and that was the “What if?”. 

What if she was right? What if against all my beliefs, there was something else out there? What if this was what I had been searching for? What...fucking...if?
I decided right then and there that if I was right and it was all bull I had nothing to lose. I decided that night that I would give this “astral projection” a try,



I took the next week to do as much research as possible, Before I even attempted anything, I wanted to have as much information at my disposal. I learned how astral projection was not just simple meditation, but also that you had to visualize yourself leaving your own body. Just like meditation, I had to be at complete peace with myself, no thoughts in your head aside from your goal. I tried for weeks, for hours everyday, all for nothing. I was starting to get fed up, 

“This is some bullshit, what am I doing?” I yelled at myself. I was ready to give up, but then I remembered what I read online. 

“You must be patient and at complete peace,” it said.

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. I forced myself to clear my mind of everything. My job, my parents, my life, my reasons for doing this, every thought was shut out from my head. For the first time in my life I had no thoughts. For the first time, I found peace. 

I thought about my goal. I tried hard to visualize myself leaving my body. I focused on what felt like hours, when I suddenly realized something. I wasn’t breathing! With that realization I opened my eyes in panic when and couldn’t believe what I saw. My panic was replaced by astonishment. I was looking at….myself. 

I could see myself sitting with crossed legs, in the middle of my room. I was hovering a few feet from my body and the floor. I wasn’t breathing but I could see my body was. I could see my physical forms chest inhaling and exhaling calmly. While I stared in disbelief, all of a sudden I felt a force start pulling me back into my body. I couldn't fight it! It was over within a few seconds. I opened my eyes and gasped for breath. My heart was racing. I looked around the room and then at my own hands. I felt myself calm a bit and collapsed on the floor. I laughed. I couldn’t believe it. I actually had done it for a brief while! I successfully left my own body! 

It's been two weeks since the first time I left my body. I was getting better at it. I was able to last longer outside my body. It started off just a few seconds, but now I could remain out for over an hour before I was forced back into my body. Whatever “it” was, it felt like a muscle. The more I used it, the stronger it got. 
One night I was brave enough to finally leave the room my body was in. I Worked my way towards my door and tried to open it. My band went right through! 

“I wonder,” I thought to myself.

I tried to walk through the door and to my amazement it worked! I found myself in the small hallway outside my room. I was like a ghost! I could go through anything because I was not in a physical form. At that moment I had an idea. 

“I wonder what my landlord's wife is up to right now,” I said to myself. 

They lived directly above me. It was only midday and I knew that he wasn't home. Instead of taking the stairs I had another idea. In this form, if i can move through doors and walls, I Should be able to move through ceilings as well! I concentrated as hard as I could and found myself slowly floating off my floor, and straight through the ceiling. 

I found myself in their kitchen. It was such an average looking kitchen. You wouldn't think that they were owners of any property. My landlord was an asshole. He always tried to act like he was rich, flashy cars, flashy dress wear. Yet his kitchen was so...plain. I laughed. It was all a show for other people.  I made my way through the kitchen and through his apartment. His living room was just as dull. A tv, a couch, a plant or two lying around, but nothing else. No pictures, no paintings, nothing. I kept moving until I saw a closed door.

“Must be the bedroom,” I thought to myself.

I tried using the knob only for my hand once again, to go through it. 

“Of course,” I laughed to myself. I still had to get used to being in this form. I walked through the closed door only to be paralyzed with a pleasant shock. Here was my landlord's wife, with a man I had never seen before. I couldn't believe my luck. The first night I was brave enough to leave my room I found my landlords wife having an affair! 

“Choke me John! Punish me! I've been a bad, bad girl!” She yelled. 

I laughed like I never laughed before but then quickly tried covering my mouth. I didn't want them to hear me. To my suprise, they didn't even react. Perhaps I couldn't be heard either! It made sense, my actual mouth and vocal chords where a floor below. This was exactly what I needed. Now I could have absolute proof that this whole experience was real and not in my head. Now I jad some dirt to test it. The last two weeks I kept questioning if it was real or not. Before I could do anything else, I felt myself get sucked through the floor, and then through a door, and back into my body. 

I Gasped for air. This was the longest and farthest I had ever gone. While catching my breath I repeated to myself “John, his name was John,”.

The next day I knocked on my landlords door when I knew she would be there. To my delight she opened the door. 

“Hey,” I said with a big smile.

“The fuck you want,” she said with annoyance.

“I need an extension on the rent. I'll have it for you guys next week,” I said with the same big smile.

“For fucks sake, aren’t you supposed to be the responsible one?” She angrily said.

“Sorry, I just had some shit happen recently and for the first time I'm gonna be a bit late with rent. It's not that big of a deal.” I said with the same goofy smile.

“So fucking irresponsible! Aren't you single with no kids?? Where does your money go?!” She angrily asked.

“No you don’t understand. John said it was ok,” I then said.

Her eyes widened at the mention of his name. I could tell reality sunk in for her when I mentioned his name. 

“I ..I don't know who that is,” she weakly replied.

I smiled an even greater smile. This was my confirmation. This whole astral projection was fucking real! 

“Look John said it was no problem. I'm just telling you instead of your husband because I know you are oser to John than him,” I said with a nasty smile. 

She couldn’t reply.

“Don't worry, we don't have any problem. Ill have the rent for you next week,” I said then added “ you bad girl,”.

Her eyes widened with fear. She must have thought in that moment I was a stalker or something, bit now I owned her.

“Ok,” she whispered “Next week is fine,”.

With that I turned around and went back to my apartment. Even though I was smiling, I was in shock. Now I had confirmation that this was all real. It wasn't in my head. AI was actually leaving my body and was free to go anywhere. At this very moment a whole new world had just opened up to me. There was no limit to what I could do with this ...”ability”. 


By now I was a pro. I could now leave my body and return whenever I wanted to. I would sometimes spend hours just walking around anywhere I wanted. It was amazing. In this world, I could go anywhere I wanted. I could even float above the ground and fly up anywhere. The laws of physics no longer applied in this world. That girl from the bar was right, this was life changing. I was able to enter anyone's home and watch them without them knowing I was there. During this time I learned a lot about the people in my life. Yousef, my deli guy, had a fetish for feet. I watched him in his house looking up women's feet on the internet, almost daily. The girl who worked at the coffee shop I went to every morning was a cutter. No wonder she always wore long sleeves. I know it's fucked up to invade people’s privacy but I was addicted.

I was having the time of my life. Then one day I got a little spooked. I was watching two women sitting outside a restaurant eating. I was in my spirit form, but for some reason I was drawn towards them. I stood right by them and tried to listen in on their conversation. They were just talking the usual nonsense, work, guys, nothing of interest. I was about to leave when one of them looked in my direction, and winked. I looked behind me to see no one there. 

“Theres no fucking way,” I thought to myself. 

I tried floating away back to my building, and she followed me with her eyes the whole time, with a smile on her face.

That girl scared me but she raised many questions. Why could she see me? Is she someone who can do the same thing? Would I also be able to see people with time? I didn't have any answers and I had no one to turn to for advice. I took a few days from astral projection, I was still pretty creeped out and thought it would be best for a break. 

I sat at home and decided to give Sal a call. I hadn't really hung out with him for a while, since I started my new...hobby. He didn't answer his phone. Not five minutes later I got a text from him. 

It read “ I know what you have been doing. You are playing in the devil's realm. God did not intend for us to be in that world. I can no longer see you while you do this. Please stop, it will not end well for you if you continue. I say this as someone who really cares about you, STOP,” 

I didn't know how to react to this. I tried calling him but got the voice message saying the number was no longer in service. My best friend, my only friend, had abandoned me. 


I went to work the next day. I wanted to talk to Sal. To my surprise he wasn't there. Our boss, Danny, told me Sal quit the day before. No two weeks, no nothing, just collected his stuff and left. 

“You didnt know?” Danny asked with surprise.

I just shook my head. 

“I don't know what's going on with him, he ignores all my texts and calls,” I replied.

But I didn know partially what was going on. Work was uneventful. I kept thinking about Sal the whole time. I went from sad to angry. My best friend turned his back on me for what?! I decided I would pay him a visit that night and see what he was up to. I would use my new ability to do a bit of reconnaissance work. 

I got home and quickly went to my bedroom. I closed the windows and doors to make it as quiet as possible, i was able to astral project with noise but it took me longer. It was easier to do it in silence.I closed my eyes tightly and focused. After a few moments I felt it, that weightlessness feeling. I opened my eyes and stood up. I looked at the floor and saw my body sitting still. 

“Time to go,” I said to myself with a smile.

It was a few days since I had done this, I forgot how much I loved this feeling, full freedom. I made my way to Sal's home. It took me about a half hour. I smiled as I almost arrived. A few weeks ago I would have been too weak to last this long, I would have been forced back into my body, and now look at me. 

“A master,” I thought. 

I saw Sal’s building. I made my way up the stairs. At this moment I forgot I could float up, gravity didn't affect me in this form. But I was still new to this. I arrived in front of his door. I felt a little guilt. I Was about to invade my best friends privacy, but I had to see him. I reached for the doorknob and as I did my hand once again went right through it. 

“Dumbass,” I said to myself. 

I walked right through the door. I didn't see him. I walked through his hallway looking for him. I knew he was somewhere in here. His lights were all on. I walked towards his bedroom. As I entered I saw him, on his knees, praying. I smiled.

“Must be getting ready for bed,” I thought to myself. 

But I realized that something was wrong He was praying, in another language. Latin perhaps? His hands were clenched tightly and he was rocking back and forth.He kept praying, and very intensely. One minute passed, then five minutes, then ten. I Was getting more and more worried. What was going on with my friend? I always knew he was religious, but this was...disturbing. 

“Sal what's wrong with you?!” I shouted desperately.

He kept on praying. I took my hand and foolishly tried to put it on his shoulder. It went right through him, but Sal suddenly jumped and let out a scream. I jumped back as well just as startled. 

Did he feel me? Sals eyes looked around the room frantically. 

“Whos...Whos there?!” He yelled out. 

“Sal, relax its just me!” I desperately shouted. 

He kept looking around the room, eyes wide in terror. He couldn't hear or see me. I tried desperately to calm him. I again reached for him, to help calm him. Again my hands just went right through him, but he jumped. His eyes widened even more with fear and he started running. 

It all happened in slow motion. He ran out of his bedroom into the living room, where he tripped over his desk chair. The same desk next to one of his windows, an open window. I saw him lose his balance and slowly fall right out of the window. I heard his loud scream of terror followed by a “crunch” sound, and then ...silence. I jumped out the window, I knew I couldn't get hurt in this state. Sals lifeless body greeted me on the street level. His arms and legs were bent in shapes that was not natural. His eyes, though opened, showed no life, but the same terror I saw in them right before he fell. I couldn’t move. People were now swarming his body from all over. Frantic voices were on their cell phones trying to call for help. I just stood there in shock, unable to look away from his lifeless eyes. 


Then out of nowhere, Sal slowly got up! He looked at me, and then to my horror, he looked down at his own mangled body. He gave me a sympathetic smile as he then started to ascend into the night sky. I tried to follow him. 

“Sal! Im so sorry! Wait!” I screamed out. I flew up after him, trying to catch up. I wanted to grab him to let him know this was an accident. I Didn't mean for him to die!
I was getting closer and closer, within inches of him, when he just disappeared before my eyes. I didn’t understand what happened, but I did know one thing. Sal was gone from this world 




I left the city after Sals death. I needed to take some time away from everything that had happened. I ended up going to my mother's house. She still lived with my sisters in a small town not far from the city I was in. It had been almost three years since I had last seen them all. My job kept me very busy. My family all heard about Sal. They all tried their best to be as comforting as possible. We had a big dinner the night I came back home. My sisters all shared their stories with me. My youngest sister was happy to soon start college. My Eldest sister, was excited for a new job she applied for in the city.

I told them about myself and my job. I of course left out my new “hobby”. That night was when everything changed for me. I was in my old room getting ready for bed after a nice dinner with my family. Before going to bed, I decided to go on another adventure. Once in my astral form I first went into my oldest  sisters room. I saw she was texting some guy, obviously someone she liked as she was making plans with him to go to the movies. 

“Boring!” I thought to myself.

Nothing interesting so I moved on. I moved on to my mothers room to find her sleeping. I smiled.

“Sweet dreams Mom,” I whispered softly.

I decided to leave the house, but as I left I was more nervous. Since Sal died, this world, the spirit world, astral world, whatever it was, seemed more grey than usual. The noise from the world, the people, the cars, all seemed to sound lighter than usual, the world seemed more dark than usual. I decided to make my way back home. Maybe everything seemed to change because I was spending a longer amount of time in this realm. I made my way to my mother's old house, through the front door, and then into the room I was spending the night. I saw my body, sitting there, crossed legs. I made my way over but to my horror I just went right through. It was the same if I tried to walk through a door or when I accidentally walked through someone in this form. I tried again and again and failed every time. My confusion then turned into panic. For the first time I was unable to return to my body! No matter how many times I tried, I was trapped outside my body!




I sat there for hours watching my own body. I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what was wrong. Should I just concentrate and visualize myself returning, the same way I would leave my body? Morning had arrived. I heard my family all getting up to start their day. I then froze in terror. I, no not me, my body got up! I just stared in fear and awe. I saw myself walk to the door and open it and walk down the hall. I quickly regained some composure and started to trail my own self. I hesitated, was that even me?

“ No there's no way!” I thought.

“Im me! Im here! I don't know what that...thing is!” I thought to myself.

I followed “it” to the kitchen. My mother was already there making breakfast for everyone. 

“Good morning!” She said cheerfully. “Did you sleep well?”

To my horror “it” replied, “ I slept great! Better than I have in a while!” with an evil smile. 

“NO MOM! THATS NOT ME! THATS NOT ME!” I yelled with desperation. 

She obviously couldn't hear me. 

I charged at my own body, trying to punch and kick, anything to stop the son of a bitch who was controlling my it.It was all for nothing, as every attempt went right through it. 

“I made some pancakes for you! I know how much you love them,” my mother said. 

It took a bite and then smiled that same nasty smile. 

“This is amazing! Best thing I've tasted in years!” It said.

My mother laughed.

“That's because you could never cook to save your own life!” She laughed.

Again I tried swinging my fist at it. I tried over and over, yelling “MOM PLEASE DONT LISTEN TO IT! THATS NOT ME!”

“GET OUT! GET OUT OF MY BODY! ILL FUCKING KILL YOU!” I shouted.

It was useless, it again had no affect. No one could feel me, no one could hear me, I was shut out. 

“Thanks for the pancakes!” It said and with an evil grin added “mom”. 

“I'm gonna head out for a bit,” it continued.

I started to cry. I had no power to do anything. All I could do was watch. 

“Alright dear, stay out of trouble!” My mother said.

“Always,” it replied.

It headed towards the door and I followed. Right before it stepped out it stopped and turned around to face….me. It let out an evil smile and said a simple 
“ thanks”.

 With that it stepped out into the world.



I had no choice but to follow it. I was determined to get my body back, some way, somehow. I knew my best bet was to just stay with it and try to learn all I could. It just walked around what seemed like randomly. It stopped at a starbucks and ordered a drink. Then it moved on to a deli and tried a little of every candy in sight. It stopped at almost every shop of every street. Eventually we reached a library. I saw it pick up the pace and move towards it. It had logged onto a computer and stayed there for hours. It was looking up the events of the last 80 years or so. From wars to politicians. I horrifying realized what it was doing, it was getting itself up to date on all the events it must have missed! 

I couldnt help myself, I yelled at it again “what the fuck do you want from me!!” 

It ignored me. I knew it was aware of my presence, how else did it know to give me that sadistic smile earlier. Hours turned into days. I just followed it, with no power to stop it. It tried everything, museums, restaurants, even concerts. It was making up for lost time. 

My world was turning more and more grey with each day I was in the spirit world.It got to the point where even noise died down. I could still hear the outside world if I focused enough on an object. But I knew it was only a matter of time before the world would go silent. I kept following it, as the world faded more and more I made sure to put all my focus on my body and whatever took over it. 

One day it looked at me. I froze, it always ignored me,what now? 

“It will only get worse. Soon all you will see is an abandoned city and an abandoned world. The people, the moving cars, all will soon disappear, you will be cursed to walk forever alone and unable to die,” it said. 

I didn't bother responding, I knew there was no point. 

“I am sorry but I was trapped there for so long, but then I saw you. I've been watching you and following you, waiting for the perfect moment to try and take over,” it continued. 

“Unless I leave you will never be able to return to your body. And I'm sorry to say I don't ever plan on returning to that world. I suffered enough in that...purgatory,” it said.

“Soon even I will disappear from your sight, no matter how hard you try to focus,” 

It smiled.

“Ive been there, I know, all I can tell you is look to the light if you wish to return,”

And with that he walked away. I knew it was useless to follow. I accepted my fate and accepted the fact that my body was lost to me. This darkening world was no my new reality.




I didnt know how long it had been now, weeks, months. I was in what seemed like purgatory, and all alone. I was still free to go anywhere I wanted, but there was nothing left to see. It was just like that thing said, nothing but deserted buildings and darkness. I was still alone. The world I saw was dark and cold. Cold...what I would give to actually feel cold again. I couldn't feel anything anymore. I couldn't hear anything or smell. At one point I did feel despair, but now ...now I feel absolutely nothing. I just wandered aimlessly. I had no choice. I couldnt ask for hell, I couldnt kill myself, all I could do was wander. 

Then one day it happened. A small light in the distance. I moved as fast as possible. I remembered what that thing said, “look to the light,”. As I got closer I saw the light was coming from one of the buildings. I moved faster towards it and through the last remaining door that separated me from that light. As soon as I walked in I saw that same light being sucked back, into a body! I was in shock. I could still see them, even though they were dark I could still see that person. The first person in god knows how long!

Im that very moment it all made sense to me. This was that persons first time astral projecting! Just like my first time, I didn't last long before being forced back into my body. This must have been how that thing found me! When you enter this world you must become visible to all who were here! 

With my new “enlightenment” I had gotten a new idea. An evil, but necessary, idea. If I followed his man long enough, if I waited for him to get stronger and be able to abandon his body long enough, perhaps I could use that as my chance to finally return to the real world. I could finally leave this place and be free! 

So I did what I had been doing for ages, I waited, I waited and watched. I kept my distance and just observed him. Like me his time in this spectral world was lasting a little longer each time he tried. He looked like I did, moving everywhere, going into all buildings that he could, he was enjoying himself much like I did. A slight guilt came over me, but my urge to escape was greater. The day came when he wandered far, too far. I took the opportunity, I had to get back, no I needed to get back, at whatever the cost. I saw his lifeless vessel, a vessel made of flesh but no soul, no one to control it, and I jumped in.

I heard knocking and the sound of a door open. 
“Hey baby, is everything ok? You have been acting…off lately and I wanted to make sure everything was ok,” said a beautiful young lady. 

I paused for a moment, before smiling at her and replying.

“Sorry baby, I’ve felt like I’ve been gone a while, but I’m back, everything is great”
