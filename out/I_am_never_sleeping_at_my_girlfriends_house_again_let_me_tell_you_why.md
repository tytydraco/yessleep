Her mother always gave me the willies. 

I mean, I always thought that something was a little off about her, nothing too crazy, just annoying and inconvenient. But that was the final drop, I'm never sleeping there again. Let me start by the beginning, the first time I went to their house.

We we're going out for a couple of weeks, when she decided should I visit her home meet her mom. I was nervous but ok, that's part for the course of a relationship, I need to do my part. We get there and she lives with her mother in this tiny apartment: you get in and there's the kitchen in front of you, to the left the living room, there's room for a dining table and the piano, nothing more. When looking left straight there's the corridor, where the dog lives, and in the end there are 3 doors: to left the bathroom, to the right my girlfriend's room and straight ahead her mother's room.

Her dad is out of the picture and we don't talk about him. We live in a big metropolis, so middle class kinda feels like poverty, and everything is unfairly expensive, but that's life. We get there and I first notice the huge Akita Inu living within the confines of a 1x3 meter hallway, I would feel a little worse if that wasn't the most neurotic dog in existence. 

Jon, the caramel Akita is by all accounts, a big dumb fluffy baby... with his owner. With anyone else that isn't my girlfriend he is very hostile, including me that loves dogs. But with her mother, he despises her. So imagine my surprise when I get in the apartment, the lock locks eyes on me, immediately starts snarling, so she says to me "Don't look him in the eyes, it challenges his domain of the territory". What is he, a shark? But in a split second, to quick for me to take my eyes off the dog, I see the doorknob behind him start twisting. Like he has a motion sensor he turns around and starts barking and howling. Out of the darkness comes this figure: 1.75 meters tall, almost my height, overweight and dressed in pijamas, her mother.

She has a hard time going past the dog, that jumps and makes a ruse in that tight corridor, the says "Is that your new boyfriend?!", that's when I can see the very rotten teeth in her mouth, and the prescription glasses, so thick and strong, that her eyes look like tiny black marbles through it. My girlfriend immediately shaking her down, saying that if she doesn't behave, we will leave. Her mother brushes it off. I found that strange, since you expect the parent to do sermons, but I came to understand that when parental figures lack, the child ends up taking that job, as somebody has to be in charge.

What followed was the most uncomfortable dinner of my life, filled with the usual questions about college and my family, and the awkward silence pauses. Her mother repeatedly told how handsome I was, much to the dismay of my girlfriend that gave her and increasingly angrier look with each mention. She has a loud exaggerated laugh, followed by a minute long coughing session. It was pain all the way through but necessary, when you compromise you have to make compromises. 

After we left I asked my girlfriend where her mother was from, as she had this strange accent, maybe Argentina maybe Eastern Europe, like Hungary or Romania or something. Difficult to place under the prominent lisp. "She's from the next town over but lived here in the city all her life." she said. I said that was really weird because of the very apparent accent she had, but my girlfriend said she never noticed. Maybe she heard her speak that way all her life and got used to it. Her mother spoke almost in old English, used very complicated and obscure words, while mispronouncing some very simple common words and using the wrong tense of simple verbs. She also rolled her "r's" like Bela Lugosi which was admittedly pretty funny.

As the months went on I got to know more about my girlfriend, and her relationship to her mother. She was a young, healthy and furious little thing, very determined and bold, almost to a fault sometimes. Once we were mugged at gunpoint, while I gave the mugger my old iPhone 7 with the screen broken, she was trying to kick him and trying to take the cellphone back from his hand. She was neglected for much of her childhood, came out stronger because of it. Nobody's perfect, and because of the loneliness she became very attached to me, requesting me to be with her all day and all night, sometimes when I had class, sometimes when I had work. Attachment became jealousy and that drove me nuts, still does, but it's the price I pay. 

She especially loved that I slept with her, at her house because my parents are also very jealous of me, and don't like that I even spend the night out and get coy if she stays at my house until late in the morning (I'm 21). It was a question of who I chose to get mad at me each day, her or my parents. But most importantly, sleeping with her means sleeping under the same roof as her mom. Which scared me at first, but seeing that she was the one that kept things in order around the house, she could do as she pleased. It was on the 2nd or 3rd night that I found out that her mother didn't even know I was there. I was always trying to avoid getting seen to avoid conversation, which was easy since the woman seemed to be locked in her room all day and all night, only coming out occasionally.

It was one night that we were in my girlfriends room, when suddenly we were warned by the howling and barking of the dog in the corridor that mother was coming out of her room. My girlfriend told me to hide the tight space between the closet and the wall, when mother comes barging in like in the first minutes of Shrek, screaming where was her food. I thought about how fucked up that was, I was hiding behind a closet during a family feud I had no business being in. From that point on I started going there less and less. Upon much prying from my girlfriend I answered the problem was her mother. She didn't get offended, she just understood. Mother was very hard to deal with, plus a illness that almost killed her a few years back, that almost made my girlfriend an orfan effectively, made me pity her and mother quite a bit.

That went on for a few months, hiding and staying very quiet sometimes was a compromise I came to accept. It wasn't all that bad, the worst part was when I had to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, but suddenly mother needs also and I have shut the lights and pretend I'm not there even though I can see her shadow through the opaque glass door of the bathroom, trying to pry the locked door open. I felt like a character in a horror movie, hiding in the bathroom with the monster prying on the door, hoping that it would loose interest and go somewhere else. The sliding glass door was for the wheelchair they had to use when mother was sick, made the scene more unnerving than it needed to be.

4 years have now passed and we're still together. Her mother's weirdness became the least of my problems, life is trouble enough as it is, I don't want have to worry about the skinwalker that lives together with my girlfriend. I learned to deal with mother's weirdness, but some occurrences were just too bizarre: buying an unhealthy amount of fruit, not eating any of and letting it all go bad and filling the house with flies; getting mad at me because I threw away the pits of the avocados I used to make guacamole (she EATS the pits); constantly travelling by bus to a town she has no living relatives in, among many others.

But on another occasion, everything changed.

I made the sacrifice of sleeping in, after a late night screening of Psycho (how ironic), and I was too tired to drive home. 

It was about 10 o'clock, I went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. I was in my underwear because thought mother would be fast asleep at that time. That was when the dog gave it's warning and the door at the end of the corridor opened. I got caught, I thought. I was in the directly line of sight of mother and there was no way she wouldn't see me. I tried to explain myself over the sound of the dog barking my I quickly gave up. I noticed she wasn't looking at me, she was looking straight down. I just stared as she hopped over the dog gate, into the living room, and walked right past me, into the kitchen. She poured herself a glass of water, drank it, all the while I was pressed against the corner, watching. She made her way back, walking right past me, like a palm's distance. Hopped over the gate to the dismay of the dog, and entered into the black void that was her room, shutting the door behind her.

She didn't see me at all. She didn't have her glasses on, but I too can't see sharply a palm in front of me without my glasses, but would notice a person standing in the corner of my own house, even if blurry. My heart raced like in a marathon, I sweated like a pig, but nothing really happened. She was blind as a bat and didn't see me, so what? I'm the "trespasser" and I'm nervous? I shook it off and went back to my girlfriends room.

She had woken up and I explained what happened, she didn't think nothing of it and chalked it up to 12 degrees of myopia mother had on both eyes. Much like the rest of the occurrences I tried to forget, then watched an episode or tow of SpyXFamily on her laptop until we both fell asleep. I have the consciousness of always taking off my glasses when I get sleepy as to not crush them, this time I wish I didn't.

Now, it was hazy, but I woke up on a whim, bothered by lamp I accidentally left on. When I noticed the door wide open, and right after, the head poking out of the doorway. There was only one person that that could be. I quickly closed my eyes again and pretended to sleep, I figured it be better to deal with it in the morning than getting confronted now. I opened my eyes slightly to see if she was gone, and not only was the figure still there, that's when I noticed how tall it was. The head in the doorway almost grazed the top. This time I closed my eyes out of fear. What the hell was that and why was it so tall? I lay there awake with my eyes closed for a few more minutes, which seemed like hours. I tried to soothe myself that I was still dreaming, that that did not happen. But, I had left the light of the living room on accidentally, it wasn't pitch black with the door open it was bright. And I know I saw, a round grey mass, a head, poking from the door, watching us sleep.

I must have drifted off some time after that. I woke up covered in sweat in the same position we had fallen asleep in and explained the story. Again, girlfriend chalked it up to "mother making sure that she was asleep because the lights were on". I don't buy that. I left shook and invaded. I was reminiscing the event on the drive back, scrutinizing every detail to figure out if it was really a dream. But it was real, my vision wouldn't be blurry in a dream, that really did happen. Most importantly it didn't feel like one, the fear was too real, I remember shaking and sweating cold. When I thought it could get any worse, I remembered the most crucial detail. I didn't hear the dog, it was silent the whole time.

That settles it, I'm never sleeping there again. She can kick and scream all she wants, I'm not doing it. No love's that big. She tried to explain, then convince me that that didn't happen. But I know what I saw, and I'm not sure it was mother. Anyway, if my girlfriend so adamant it didn't happen, then why soon after she had locks put on all the doors?

The End.
