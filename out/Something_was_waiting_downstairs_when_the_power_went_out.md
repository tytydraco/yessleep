When I woke up, the house was too quiet.

Not the normal quiet you get at night, with pipes ticking and distant cars passing. This was heavier. Like the air itself had stopped moving.

I reached for my phone and realized it wasn’t charging. The screen was dead. My lamp didn’t turn on either.

The power was out.

Before I could think much about it, I heard something downstairs.

It wasn’t loud. Just a soft, uneven sound. Like something being dragged slowly across the floor.

I called my sister’s name from the top of the stairs. No answer.

The only light in the house was coming from downstairs. The living room. A dim, flickering glow that pulsed weakly, like it was struggling to stay alive.

That scared me more than the darkness.

I crept down the stairs, each step groaning under my weight. The sound downstairs stopped as soon as I reached the bottom.

My sister was standing in the living room.

She was completely still.

Her back was to me, shoulders stiff, arms hanging straight down. The flickering light from the lamp barely reached her, throwing her shadow too long across the floor.

“Sis?” I whispered.

She didn’t turn around.

Instead, she raised one arm and pointed toward the far corner of the room. Toward the part the light didn’t reach.

I followed her finger.

At first, I thought it was just darkness playing tricks on me. Then it moved.

Something unfolded itself from the shadows. Low to the ground at first, then rising unnaturally, joints bending the wrong way. It looked animal, but not any animal I knew. Too tall. Too thin. Its head tilted as if it was listening.

The smell hit me next. Wet. Rotten.

My sister gasped.

The thing lunged.

I screamed, but the sound barely left my throat. It hit her with force that sent both of them crashing into the floor. She tried to crawl away, hands slipping in something dark that spread beneath her.

The creature tore into her stomach with its hands. I saw skin split. Saw ribs beneath.

She didn’t scream for long.

The thing didn’t eat her.

It climbed inside her.

I don’t have better words for it. It forced its way into her body, pushing itself through the opening it had made, stretching her in ways that shouldn’t be possible. Her limbs jerked violently, then went still.

The light flickered once.

Then everything went black.

I woke up on the living room floor in the morning.

Sunlight poured through the windows. The power was back on. The lamp stood upright, perfectly normal.

My sister was in the kitchen, making coffee.

She looked fine.

No blood. No wounds. No sign that anything had happened.

I started crying the moment I saw her.

My parents rushed in. I tried to explain. Tried to tell them everything. They exchanged looks the whole time, the kind adults give when they’ve already decided what’s wrong.

Night terror. Sleepwalking. Stress.

My sister watched quietly from the doorway, her head tilted slightly to one side.

When everyone left the room, she smiled at me.

Just for a second.

It was too wide.

Too deliberate.

I didn’t sleep the next night. Or the one after that.

Everything about her was normal when anyone else was around. Same laugh. Same habits. Same routines.

But when we were alone, she’d stare.

Sometimes she’d stand too close. Sometimes she’d repeat things I’d said earlier, word for word, but with the wrong tone.

Once, while passing me in the hallway, she leaned in and whispered,  
“You didn’t faint this time.”

I froze.

She walked away like she hadn’t said anything at all.

The worst was the eye contact. She’d hold it just a beat too long. Then she’d wink.

Slow. Intentional.

A message.

I know what I saw that night. I know I didn’t dream it.

Whatever came out of the dark didn’t leave.

It’s learned how to wear her.

And it knows that I know.

She winked at me again this morning before leaving the house.

I don’t think she’s planning to hurt me.

Not yet.

I think it likes watching me pretend everything is normal.
