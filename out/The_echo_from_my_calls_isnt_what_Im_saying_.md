"Content Warning: >!Mentions suicidal Ideation and suicide.!‹" 

It was 2020 when I started realizing my phone was acting up. My calls wouldn't go through,  they'd be choppy,  that sort of thing. I had it checked out too and they said nothing was wrong.  

Whenever I'd call someone I could hear the echo of my voice but it's not what I was saying. It's been little things here and there, for example I was on the phone with my mom when I said, "Did you get me something from the store?" Then I heard my voice say, 
"What are you doing?" Back to me,  that kind of thing. Harmless.

On sunday September 13th 2020, I was on the phone with my doctor when something odd happened. I told them, 
"Hey I needed a refill on my meds." Then my echoed voice said, "I need nothing." And hung up. When I tried to call back it kept saying the call had failed and decided to call back a week later, brushing it off knowing I had stuff left to hold me over till I could make an appointment. 

Over the past few days things had seemed to taken a turn. I was on the phone with my best friend 3 days after, who was having trouble feeling accepted as he came out to his parents. When I said to him, "You are very loved and this too shall pass." My voice said, "No one will ever love you being gay and all and you should accept it." When I tried to explain to him that was not at all what I said he blocked me and I've been devastated losing my best friend. I was there for him through everything and encouraged him coming out to his parents, I feel so guilty and ashamed. I have no idea what's wrong with my phone. 

After this, I immediately went back to the phone store to see what was wrong with my damn phone. I waited there for almost 4 hours just for them to tell me nothing was wrong. When I told them to look again they said there was nothing they could do and I was holding up the line.  When I got home I hopped on my computer to research anything and everything I could and came up with nothing. 

After going to the phone store again things started to settle back down a little bit and went back to the harmless stuff like when I asked  my dad, "What time will you be home?" And the voice saying,  "What's for dinner?" I thought it was still odd but at least it went back to normal if you can even call this normal. 

Everything was good I thought. But the morning of September 19th 2020 was my breaking point when I got a call from my boyfriend. He was crying about how he's suicidal and depressed, when I said, "I love you very much and I'm here for you." My echo said,  "no one loves you no one will even realize your gone." After he got really hurt and didn't believe me when I told him that I loved him and that's not what I said and hung up. Then I got a call from his mom shortly after screaming at me telling me she found her son dead and it was my fault.

 I can't live like this.

 I just lost my best friend and now my boyfriend’s dead in the span of about a week. I wanted to curl up in a ball and die. He was the love of my life. I screamed in agony and threw my phone at the wall and watched it shatter. 

Everything was fine with the weird shit until I got an email from an unknown sender, it said, "Don't think you can get away from me that easily, soon you'll have no one and it'll be all your fault." I'm terrified and don't know what to do with this information. I thought i should just go try to get some real sleep and pretend this never even happened. I just prayed this was all an awful nightmare that I would wake up from.
When I woke up, what I saw definitely wasn’t a dream but it was a real life nightmare and I really, really wish it was all just a dream. 

When I opened my eyes a tall, lengthy, skinny figure was hovering over me breathing heavily. I got up and screamed not knowing what to do, I got under my blankets and started to flail every which way. 

“Enough!” Said a voice. I froze as the voice was oddly familiar and it sent a chill down my spine. 

“W-who are you?” I asked terrified at what the answer could be. 

“I’m here to make sure your life is a living hell.” Said my voice back to me. I didn’t know what to do but listen in fear.

“What’s your problem with me! Why am I so important to you!” I scream in frustration at this creature standing in front of me just knowing this is who was ruining my life. Her face hidden by shadows in my room. 

Once the creature stepped closer to me, the moonlight shone on her pale sunken face. I was even more confused looking at an older, terrifyingly skinny, malnourished version of myself. 

“W-what are you?!” I screamed wanting... no, needing to understand. 

“Ive tried so hard to be you but I can never be enough! I've tried to make your life mine I've changed everything about me to be you even changing my appearance to look like you but nothing would work no matter how hard I tried. So the only thing I can do to satisfy myself is destroying everything for you and it has only just begun. Your parents are dead in their room blood spattered everywhere, no chance of saving them even if you tried. All your friends think you hate them, and worst of all you blame yourself for all of this. You'll be forever alone and will have nothing left.” The monster spat at me in fury. 

“Why? Why do this to me all because you couldn't have my life!?” I yelled angrily. 

“Because I want you to feel how I’ve always felt!” the monster screamed at me as she grabbed me and smothered me with the blanket. Once I woke up I was in a bunker all by myself. Alone. 

This was a few years ago, it's hard to keep track but I think it's now some time in 2024 the 4 year anniversary of when this all started. I'm still alone in this bunker that monster tried living my life for awhile but realized she fucked it up to a point she didn't even want to live it. Now she's doing this to other poor souls as I rot away in this cellar with everyone else she's done this to. I'm posting this on the only electronic were allowed to have, a slow and old computer with practically every website blocked on it. Red it being the only way I can share my story as I have nothing else I can do nor live for. Please send help.
