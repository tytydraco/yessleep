I started realizing my phone was acting up a few months ago. My calls wouldn't go through,  they'd be choppy,  that sort of thing. I had it checked out too and they said nothing was wrong.  

Recently, whenever I'd call someone I could hear the echo of my voice but it's not what I was saying. It's been little things here and there, for example I was on the phone with my mom when I said, "Did you get me something from the store?" Then I heard my voice say,  "What are you doing?" Back to me,  that kind of thing. Harmless.

 5 days ago I was on the phone with my doctor when something odd happened. I told them, "Hey I needed a refill on my meds." Then my echoed voice said,  "I need nothing." And hung up. When I tried to call back it kept saying the call had failed and decided to call back a week later, brushing it off knowing I had stuff left to hold me over till I could make an appointment. 

But over the past few days things have taken a turn. I was on the phone with my best friend 3 days ago, who was having trouble feeling accepted as he came out to his parents. When I said to him, "You are very loved and this too shall pass." My voice said,  "No one will ever love you being gay and all and you should accept it." When I tried to explain to him that that is not at all what I said he blocked me and I've been devastated losing my best friend. I was there for him through everything and encouraged him coming out to his parents, I feel so guilty and ashamed. I have no idea what's wrong with my phone. 

After this, I immediately went back to the phone store to see what was wrong with my damn phone again. I waited there for almost 4 hours just for them to tell me nothing was wrong. When I told them to look again they said there was nothing they could do and I was holding up the line.  When I got home I hopped on my computer to research anything and everything I could and came up with nothing. 

After going to the phone store again things started to settle back down a little bit and went back to the harmless stuff like asking my dad,  "what time will you be home?" And the voice saying,  "what's for dinner?" I thought it was still odd but at least it went back to normal if you can even call this normal. 

Everything was good I thought. But this morning was my breaking point when I got a call from my boyfriend. He was crying about how he's suicidal and depressed, when I said, "I love you very much and I'm here for you." My echo said,  "no one loves you and you should kill yourself." After he got really hurt and didn't believe me when I told him that I loved him and that's not what I said and hung up. Then I got a call from his mom shortly after screaming at me telling me she found her son dead and it was my fault.

 I can't live like this. I just lost my best friend and now my boyfriendâ€™s dead in the span of less than a week. I wanted to curl up in a ball and die. He was the love of my life. I screamed in agony and threw my phone at the wall and watched it shatter. 

That was a few hours ago. I'm typing this on my computer now. Wait I just received an email from and unknown sender, it says, "Don't think you can get away from me that easily, soon you'll have no one and it'll be all your fault." I'm terrified and don't know what to do with this information. I think I'm just going to try and go to try and get some real sleep and pretend this never even happened. I just pray this is all an awful nightmare that I wake up from. Please tell me if you have any suggestions or anything to help.
