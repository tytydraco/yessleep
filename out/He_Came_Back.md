I wasn’t planning to write this, but after everything that happened, I can’t stop thinking about it. Maybe getting it out will help. Maybe someone will tell me I’m not insane.

It started last winter, when my brother called me out of the blue.

We hadn’t talked much since the accident. The one that killed his girlfriend. He was in the car too — barely made it out alive. He never liked to talk about it, and I didn’t push. When he said he needed somewhere to stay for a while, I told him to come over right away. He sounded… small, almost like a kid.

The first week was normal enough. He mostly stayed in his room, quiet, polite. Said he was “just tired.” He didn’t go out much except to buy cigarettes or flowers — said he left them for her at the cemetery. I thought maybe it was part of his grieving process.

Then the smell started.

At first, I thought it was the plumbing. It was faint — a sour, musty odor that came and went. I cleaned the bathroom top to bottom, emptied trash, even scrubbed behind the fridge. But the smell kept creeping back, thicker every day.

It got to the point where neighbors started complaining. My upstairs neighbor texted me asking if something died in the walls.

I tried asking my brother if he noticed it. He just shrugged and said, “She doesn’t like the window open.”

I didn’t understand what he meant, and honestly, I didn’t want to. He’d been talking to himself a lot lately. Late at night, I could hear him whispering through the wall — soft, affectionate words like, *“It’s okay, I’m here,”* and *“Don’t cry anymore.”*

Sometimes I could have sworn I heard a woman’s voice answer. Just a breath, a murmur, so faint I thought I was imagining it.

The more I tried to ignore it, the worse everything felt. The air in the apartment grew heavy, damp. I’d come home from work and the smell would hit me before I even reached the hallway.

Every time I asked him to at least air out his room, he’d get defensive.  
“Don’t touch anything,” he’d snap. “It’s fine. She’s fine.”

She.

I thought he was losing his mind.

A few days later, when he left for one of his “visits,” I decided I couldn’t take it anymore. I told myself I’d just open the window, spray some air freshener, maybe do a quick tidy-up. Nothing invasive.

But the second I opened his door, I almost threw up.

The smell slammed into me — thick, sweet, metallic. The curtains were drawn tight. The air was humid, like something rotting had been trapped for weeks.

Clothes were scattered everywhere. Old food containers. The floor was sticky in some places. But the worst part was near the bed. The wood there was dark, damp-looking, as if something had seeped into it.

My stomach turned when I saw the corner of a blanket move slightly — or maybe it just sagged. Either way, something was under there.

I crouched down, grabbed the blanket with trembling fingers, and pulled.

That’s when I saw it.

An arm.

Pale. Stiff. The skin looked stretched, like paper over bone.

I screamed and stumbled backward, my heart slamming so hard I couldn’t breathe. For a few seconds, all I could do was stare. The smell made sense now. The whispers. The way he never left.

He’d done it.  
He’d dug her up.  
He brought her home.

My brain refused to process it. I ran for my phone, my hands shaking so badly I could barely unlock it. That’s when I heard the front door creak.

He was home.

He stood in the doorway, eyes wide, his clothes damp from the rain. For a long moment, neither of us spoke.

Then he smiled — that empty, hollow smile I hadn’t seen since the funeral.

“You weren’t supposed to go in there,” he said quietly. Then, louder, almost shouting, “She’s *still real*! Don’t say she’s not!”

He lunged toward the bed, shielding it with his body, shouting at me not to touch her. I backed into the corner, crying, begging him to stop. I called the police, screaming into the phone that my brother had lost his mind, that there was a dead body in my apartment.

He was sobbing now, clutching something invisible, whispering her name over and over. When the sirens finally grew louder outside, I thought it was over. Relief flooded me.

The officers burst in — two of them, hands on their holsters. I pointed to the bed, yelling for them to look, to see what he’d done. But they just stared at me.

One of them spoke softly, like I was a child:  
“Who are you talking to?”

I turned to gesture toward my brother. But he wasn’t there.

The room was empty.

The bed, though — the bed still had something underneath it. One of the officers knelt, lifted the blanket, and then froze.

I’ll never forget his face.

Because the body under the bed wasn’t hers.

It was him.  
My brother.

His eyes were sunken, his mouth open like he’d died mid-breath. His skin was gray, mummified, caved in.

I dropped to my knees, shaking my head, saying no, no, no. Because it couldn’t be him. He was *here*. He had *been* here. He called me, moved in, ate breakfast with me, sat at the table every morning, *talked to me.*

They pulled me away, but I kept screaming that he was alive, that he’d just been standing there. They said I’d been living alone for months. The landlord confirmed it.

The neighbors never saw him. No one ever did.

I’d dug him up myself.

Somewhere in my mind, I guess I couldn’t handle losing him. I told myself he called, that he came back. I cleaned his room. Cooked for him. Heard him talking through the wall.

But he never came back.

Sometimes, at night, when it’s quiet and the heater hums, I still hear him whispering through the wall. His voice is soft, almost kind.

“Thank you for letting me stay”
