***\[Transcript Begins\]***  


**Hawthorne:** Okay Mr. Johnson, as of right now anything you say will be on the official record, is that clear?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Yes I… wait I’m not a suspect, am I? I… I showed you the video, *I’m not a suspect, right?*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** We’re just having a conversation right now, Mr. Johnson, okay?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** So I’m not… I’m not a suspect?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Right now it’s too early to determine that. Just answer these questions to the best of your ability, okay? Can you do that for me?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Yeah… yeah, I can do that!

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Okay. Why don’t we start with the night of May 8th? 

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Yeah… yeah… um… we were at the Hollywood Lounge. It’s a nightclub downtown. You can check with the bartender, or look at the camera footage. You’ll probably see *Her* there too.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Were you and Gareth regulars at the Hollywood Lounge?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Yeah! Well… okay, I wasn’t but *he* was! He fucking loved the place. Always said it was one of the best places in town to get some premium tail. A guy like him just needed to saunter in, throw some money around and the sluts would flock around him, like ducks crowding a little old lady who brought some bread to the pond. Then he’d have his pick of the litter.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I see… so he would often pick up women at the Hollywood?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Yeah, really often. His… um… his favorites were the girls who were fresh on the scene, as it were. And out of that group the ones he loved the most, were the tagalongs. 

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Tagalongs…

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Yeah… um… the friends. Doe eyed, hot little things who were only there because their more daring friends talked them into it. The good girls who clearly didn’t belong there.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Right…

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Fuck… they just fucking melted whenever he showed them some attention. They didn’t know how to handle it or what to do with themselves! And after that, it was easy to wrap them nice and tight around his little finger. I mean, I’d watched him work plenty of times before… the man was like a magician when it came to these girls. He knew just what to say and just how to say it, and he was so goddamn confident! I don’t know how he did it. I sure as hell couldn’t have done it… but then again, I didn’t need to. 

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Why is that?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** See, there’s one thing Gareth liked even more than shy, skittish girls and that was being watched. He liked *knowing* that someone was watching him fuck, he liked being envied… which was just fine with me. I liked to watch.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** You… would watch your roommate have sex…?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Look, we’ve all got our *eccentricities*. These were ours. We’d been roommates for a few years, and during that time, had sort of come to an agreement. He’d fuck. I’d watch. 

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Uh huh…

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** What’s with that look…? It’s just… you said you wanted context, I’m giving it!

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** And these women consented to being watched…?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Um… not exactly. Most people weren’t exactly okay with a stranger watching them get plowed, but that’s not the issue here! I mean, okay I know I’m sorta throwing myself to the wolves right now, but… shit… I mean you *saw* the video right? 

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Was your roommate at least aware of the camera…?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Yeah! He set it up! I mean, he was in on it! He knew where to put it so I could get a nice view of the action, and he liked to sorta put on a show for me too. He knew the positions I liked to see the girls in, he knew the dirty talk I liked to hear, he knew how to turn every encounter into a scene I’d enjoy… so I’d like… while he was getting busy I’d be watching from my own bedroom, listening to the moans through the walls and watching the show on my laptop. No one would ever know I was there. If his partner for the night asked, I was *‘away for the weekend.’* Nobody ever second guessed that. Why would they?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Right… let’s stay focused on May 8th. You were at the Hollywood that night with Gareth, correct?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Yeah! I was with him when he saw Her.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** The woman you said was in the video you provided?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Yes. I… I never caught her name, but I saw her.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Can you describe this woman?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Young… busty but petite, blonde with big, blue eyes. Doe eyes. Hair tied back in a ponytail. She was sitting off to the side of another group of girls. She looked a little lost but… well… she was kinda perfect. I mean, the moment I saw her, I knew she was going to end up in Gareth’s bedroom… I honestly couldn’t wait to see what he’d do to her.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Right… I presume Gareth took a clear interest in her?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** He did. He was watching her for a bit, and I could tell that he caught her eyes wandering. Eventually he got up to go talk to her, and I figured at that point, she was as good as his. He never said anything to me about her. He just gave me a knowing look before going over to chat her up. So I sat back, ordered myself another beer and watched him work his magic from a distance. I mean… Gareth was a good looking guy. Tall and beefy with a chiseled, clean shaven jaw and perfect, windswept hair. He had this winning smile that seemed to make most women just melt. This girl was no exception.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Let’s stay on topic, please. How much longer did you stay at the bar after Gareth went to talk to this woman?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Not long. I watched them talk out of the corner of my eye for a bit, making a point not to seem too interested. Then, when I was sure that Gareth had sealed the deal, I settled up my tab and called a cab home. I… I wanted to get set up in my room for when he came home.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** How long did it take for him to arrive home after you did?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** About an hour or so. Pretty standard for him. The girl was with him.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** This girl, did you at any point catch her name?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** No. But I never really caught the names of the girls he took home. I figured the less either of us knew about them, the better… *\[Laughter\]* 

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Um… Detective? Why are you looking at me like that?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Moving on… what followed after Gareth got home is what you claim you captured on the video, correct?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Yes. Wait… you say ‘*claim*’... the video, you saw it, right?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** We found a camera at the scene, yes. But the video files from May 8th were corrupted. 

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Wait, wait, wait… corrupted? I *saw* it! I saw everything that happened! 

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Well the file we found couldn’t be read, so we’re going to need you to recount it for the record, please.

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** I… I… yeah… I can do that… I can do that…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What happened when Gareth came home with the girl?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** He took her to his room. They were talking, she sat on his bed… she seemed a bit nervous. He asked her if she was a virgin… if this was her *‘first time being fucked’.* She said it was. So he kinda started putting the moves on her. Kissing her, undressing her. He told her he couldn’t wait to be inside of her… and I remember that when he said that, she pulled back a little bit, smiled and whispered to him: *“I can’t wait to be inside of you either.”* Then she just… 

&#x200B;

*\[Pause\]*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Mr. Johnson?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** She… she put her hand in his stomach…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** *In* his stomach…?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** *IN.* One minute he was normal and then he just sort of made this sound as she put her entire hand through him… he didn’t even seem to know what to do at first, he just froze and went pale… and her lips started curling into this smile… this… coquettish little smirk. Then she leaned in and she bit him. Right on the neck. He… he didn’t even scream. She forced him down on the bed, tearing open his stomach and taking chunks out of his flesh and all he could do was make these wet gasping noises I could barely even hear through the camera…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I’m sorry… you’re saying she gutted him with her bare hands and began to *eat* him?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** I wouldn’t be telling you this if I didn’t see it with my own fucking eyes! Jesus… even if I don’t have the video, you had to have seen the body, right? The body and all the blood that was there… you had to have seen it!

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What happened next Mr. Johnson?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** I got up! I was… I was going to run in to help him but… Jesus, looking at the state he was in… looking at how she was… she was just taking him apart, I didn’t know what to do! I mean… shit, even if I went in there what the hell was to stop her from killing me? I didn’t know what to do! And I just kept glancing over at the camera and… that’s when I looked into her eyes. She was staring right at the camera… blood smeared around her little pale mouth and streaking her blonde hair. She looked like something out of a nightmare. And she was just staring at me… that’s when I lost it completely. Next thing I knew, I was running for my window and climbing down the fire escape. Then I called you guys… the cops on the scene said they only found the body. You *have* to have at least seen that, right?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yes… I have seen the body.

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** S-so am I a suspect still?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Not at this time… but we will need you to stay in touch. It’s likely we’ll have further questions.

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** I’ll tell you whatever the hell you want me to tell you! Just… promise me you’ll get that thing, okay?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** We are currently looking into it.

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** And what about like, witness protection or something? I mean… I don’t know if it saw me or if it knows my face but I… I don’t feel safe out there.  


**Hawthorne:** I can ask an officer to keep an eye on you. I presume you haven’t been staying at home since the incident?

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** No… I’ve been staying with a friend. 

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I’ll need their name and address… let me just get a fresh coffee and we’ll get that set up for you.

&#x200B;

**Johnson:** Right… right, thank you!

&#x200B;

***Notes:*** *Passing this one along to Justice along with the relevant police reports. This seems like it’s up her alley, so her people can deal with it.*  


*Judging by the coroners report and my own examination of the body, the wounds that killed Gareth Lovisa are consistent with the ones described by Sebastian Johnson. Lovina’s remains had been partially eaten upon discovery, although it’s unclear what exactly it was that attacked him. The bites didn’t match any known animal and clearly weren’t human.*  

&#x200B;

*About two days following my interview with Johnson, a neighbor called the police after hearing some sort of loud altercation at the apartment he’d been staying at. Upon arriving at the scene, police did not find Sebastian Johnson or the friend he’d been staying with, but they did find signs of a struggle and a lot of fresh blood. As of time of writing, I believe it unlikely that Johnson is still alive and despite my admitted disgust toward the man (the transcript doesn’t come close to capturing what a pig he was) I’m still fairly disturbed by the notion that there’s something wandering free out there.* 

&#x200B;

*I’m going to keep an eye out for any similar cases in the area. Something tells me it won’t be long before I find a few.*
