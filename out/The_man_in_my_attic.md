Hey guys, I don’t really post on Reddit but my friend said I should tell this story here.
I’m Terry, I’m 14 and I live in southern Ontario with my dad and my little brother Alex (he’s 9). My parents are divorced and my mom only comes around every few weekends. Dad works nights at a warehouse so it’s usually just me, Alex, and our dog Peanut.

This all happened last November, like right after Halloween.

Our house is kinda old and makes a lot of noise at night. My dad always says it’s “just the house settling” but I swear sometimes it sounds like footsteps or something moving.

We started noticing weird stuff first. Food went missing from the fridge. Sometimes I’d leave leftovers in there and they’d just be gone the next day. Dad thought Alex was sneaking it but he promised he wasn’t. Alex’s Halloween candy slowly went missing too.

Then Peanut started barking at the ceiling at night. Like full-on barking at nothing. It creeped me out but Dad said it was probably mice or raccoons or whatever.

Then my computer started doing weird crap. Files would go missing or new ones would show up with random names. I don’t have a password on my computer and sometimes my little brother uses it for school stuff so I thought maybe it was him doing it despite him saying he didn’t touch it. 

One night I came back from brushing my teeth and there was this random tab open on my browser. It was called “InMyRoom Live.” I didn’t go to that site and it was already logged in. At first I thought it was some pop-up ad thing. But when I clicked on the tab, it showed a live feed from our kitchen. For real. Peanut was laying by the fridge.

There was a few other camera feeds shown on the website as well. One of them was our bathroom.

It saw a clip from earlier that day of me sitting on the toilet.

There was also one of my friend Maddie in the shower. She’d been over the night before working on a school project. It got late and my dad said she could just crash on the couch. She took a shower before bed. I felt sick. I didn’t even want to look anymore but I saw clips of my dad shaving, Alex brushing his teeth… even me sleeping.

And then there were other clips of some random guy walking around our house when nobody was home. He’d eat stuff, sit on the couch and watch tv, even use the bathroom. Then he’d go up into the attic. He seemed to know our routine and would come out for the majority of the day when me and my brother were at school and my dad was out running errands or at work. 

I called my dad right away and he came home from work. He called the cops and they searched the attic.

They actually found him up there.

Some dude was living in our attic. He had a sleeping bag, a backpack, and a pile of food wrappers (mostly my brother’s Halloween candy.) He had tapped into one of the attic light sockets to get power to charge his phone. 

The cops think he got in when we were all out one day and just stayed there.

They took him away but it seriously messed me up. The police checked my computer and everything was deleted, like totally wiped clean.

It’s almost been a year now and I still can’t sleep sometimes. The house still makes noises at night and it really creeps me out.
