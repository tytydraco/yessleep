\[Transcript of a journal found by a hiker, \[REDACTED\], in \[REDACTED\] National Park.\]

6/4/21:

Today the six of us arrived at \[REDACTED\] and hiked the trail to the campground. It was a brisk and invigorating hike that left us with plenty of time and energy to set up our camps, as well as dinner. It wasn’t all good, though: I was hoping to do some birdwatching, and yet didn’t see a single bird. Didn’t even hear one all day--what gives? Oh, well; there’s always tomorrow.

\[Italicized to show that this is written in a different hand:\] *There’s no such thing as the Fleshgait, of course. It’s an invention of the internet, like Slenderman or the Rake--even the name came about because it was decided that it would be offensive to continue calling this hybrid monster a skinwalker (get it?) or wendigo.*

6/5/21:

Who wrote that? \[arrow pointing at the above\] I asked my six companions and they all denied it. I don’t even get the point of the prank. Or when anyone would have time to do it, for that matter.

But I get ahead of myself. We left the designated campground and hiked deeper into the woods. Found signs of a previous camp site and decided to make it our own. Decided to write our progress down and that’s when I discovered that someone had vandalized my journal. Real mature, guys! I asked what a “Fleshgait” even was, and no one claimed to have any idea. Dave vaguely remembered having heard about it on the internet, but couldn’t remember any details.

Still no birds or birdsong.

*But the method of its creation was unique; unlike Slenderman and the Rake, it has no individual author. It was a collaborative effort; people from all over the world looked at three monsters from the myths of completely unrelated cultures--skinwalker, wendigo, goatman--and decided, based on some instinct or intuition far deeper than the logical workings of the conscious mind, that there was a connection here. They gathered the traits of each they collectively found most disturbing and pooled them into a single creature.*

6/6/21:

Okay, that \[arrow pointing up\] is actually kind of impressive; I could have sworn I guarded my pack like a hawk all day. Still don’t know what the point is.

Anyway:

The six of us came across  the most picturesque babbling brook today! It was the quaintest thing you ever did see--like something out of a picture book--and decided to fill our canteens; we have iodine.  
Seriously, are there even birds in this forest?

*Could it be that there’s a REASON the closest thing we have to a collective will of humanity found these particular traits to be the most disturbing ones to give to a humanoid, human-hunting monster? Some genetic memory, perhaps?*

6/7/21:

Accidentally opened this journal in the morning and noticed that the above was already here--ah, so you’re doing it while I sleep! I don’t care enough to stay up all night in order to stop you, so fine, have your fun.

\--Later--

We came upon a split in the trail today, one branch going north and one going south. By a 2:1 vote (Mike and I abstained) we went south. Still no birds.

*That would be ridiculous, of course; where is the evidence in the fossil record? How did such creatures go extinct? How WOULD something with the powers of the Fleshgait go extinct, even? How indeed.*

6/8/21:

Exhausted. Today’s hiking was more taxing than usual. I’m beginning to wonder why we brought so much equipment for just four people.

 *But if a monster ever DID exist who could alter the memories of those it meets, who’s to say it ever went extinct in the first place?*

6/9/21:

What the hell? What is this nonsense? I decided to look this journal over again, since we’ve been out here for nearly a week and--I understand how, if not why, someone would add to my notes, but not how they’d go back and change them. 6 people? 7? 6 again? 5? 4? Who the hell are Mike and Dave? There’s three of us. There’s only ever been three of us--me, Brian, James. It’s not like they just erased what I wrote and wrote over it, either--there’d be signs of that, and besides, this is all in my hand, monologuing about the Fleshgait notwithstanding. So yes, this escalation of the prank is genuinely disturbing--are you happy now??? Piss off.

\--Later--

How DID three people manage to port all this stuff into the middle of the woods, anyway?

*The idea that the world is small in the modern age, that it has been completely mapped, rests upon a single underlying assumption: that if, say, bigfoot existed, someone would eventually SEE it--and that someone would SAY something. Information--evidence--would be gathered, and it would eventually be smoked out.*

6/10/21:

It’s over. The monster has toyed with me for a week, but it’s over. Now that there were only two of us left, it let its guard down. It let me remember the others--to toy with me, or perhaps it was exhausted. Either way, I saw how we’d been picked off one by one, and I bashed its head in with a rock. The monster, which had inserted itself into my memories as my good friend James, is dead.

*This doesn’t really hold when information is the predator’s weapon, does it? When the monster is perfectly evolved to use your own mind against you?*

*But why would such creatures live in the wilderness, if humanity is their prey?*

*The territory of any species--lions, antelopes, elephants--has margins, where that animal can only just barely survive, where the least fit among them are exiled: the weakest, the stupidest…the ones least able to camouflage themselves.*

*Or since we’re talking about an intelligent animal, perhaps the least WILLING to do so; the ones who most like to toy with their prey before going in for the kill. The sadists.*

*Even if you escape ME, you’ll never escape US.*

6/15/21, or at least that’s what I assume by counting the previous entries:

I’m never escaping it, am I? Not that I particularly WANT to live, after what I have apparently done. Weighing the pros and cons of ending myself.

\--Later--

Heard birdsong for the first time on this entire accursed trip, as I sit upon this ledge. Don’t know if that means anything. Too little, too late. It has won. What life have I to return to, after killing five men? Goodbye, world.
