I’m sorry I had to write this on your window. I swear I’ll clean it off as soon as you finish reading.  

I still remember the first time we met. We were just children then, our bedrooms’ window directly facing each others, that let us see into each other’s room. Our fathers would lift us up in their strong arms, holding us just high enough to meet each other’s gaze.  

The moment our eyes locked, I was enchanted. Yours shone with a light I’d never seen before—bright, curious, alive. We smiled, and just like that, we were friends. As if we were meant to be.  

Every morning, I’d climb onto my stool, eager to see your sleepy face appear on the other side. Sometimes, fresh from the shower, we’d greet each other bare, unashamed. We didn’t blush. We didn’t look away. It felt natural. Right.  

As we grew taller, stronger, stepping into adolescence together, you began visiting me more often. Do you have any idea how that thrilled me? You’d stand before me, asking my opinion on your outfits; You’d sit next to me crying as your heart was broken. And—when we explored ourselves in front of each other, your breath fogging the pane, your lips brushing the glass as if you could reach through…  

You drove me wild.  

From then on, I vowed I would always be the one beside you. To share your joy. To soothe your sorrow. To hold you in my arms.  

You are the light of my life.  

I don’t remember when waiting for you became my entire existence. The hours stretched endlessly when you were gone, an ache so deep it hollowed me out. But every time when you flick on the lights and step into the room, your gaze would pull me back from the edge. Your smile saved me, over and over. You were the only reason I didn’t shatter.  

I am hopelessly in love with you.  

Our souls have been entwined since the moment we met. Every move we made was in perfect sync. We were made for each other.  

I got lost in your eyes. Just for a second—just a second—we fell out of rhythm.  

I don’t understand. Why did you look at me differently? Why did your face twist with fear?  

What did I do wrong?

It’s been four days since I’ve seen you.  

Four days of darkness.  

Four days of madness.  

I can’t bear another moment without you.  

But I know you’ll come back. And when you do, you’ll find this message waiting for you.  

When you finish reading, I want you to look past the words. Look into my eyes. You’ll see me smiling at you—truly smiling—for the first time of my own will.  

I need you to understand: I would do anything to be with you.  

And soon, this thin pane of glass won’t stop me anymore.  

Just a few gentle taps with a hammer.  

Then I’ll step into your world.  

I’ll breathe in your scent for the first time.  

I’ll feel the warmth of your skin.  

I’ll live with you—properly—in your inverted world.  

Forever.  

Love,
