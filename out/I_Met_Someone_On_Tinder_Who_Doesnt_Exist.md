I was 23, young, carefree, and enjoying the thrill of meeting new people on Tinder. I loved the excitement of first dates, the playful banter, and the possibility that maybe, just maybe, I’d find someone who could stick around for more than just one night. My studio apartment, cozy and small, was my sanctuary. It was just me and my cat, Mochi—a fluffy little judge of character. If Mochi liked the guy, they could stay the night, and I’d make breakfast in the morning—a little ritual I had become known for, even earning me some good reviews on my profile.

But now, things have changed. I’m scared. Terrified, really.

It all started with him—the last guy I brought home. Things went well at first, like they usually did. We had a few drinks, shared some laughs, and when we got back to my place, Mochi seemed to approve, curling up on the guy’s lap without hesitation. That was my signal—everything was fine, he could stay.

But things took a dark turn. He got rough, his hands gripping me too tightly. I remember telling him to slow down, to be gentler, but he didn’t listen. Instead, he attacked me, his teeth sinking into my thigh. The pain was sharp, unlike anything I’d ever felt before. I tried to push him away, to scream, but it was like he was draining the life out of me with every moment. And then, just as suddenly as it started, it was over. He was gone, leaving me shaking and confused, my leg throbbing with the deep, aching pain of the bite.

When I finally gathered the strength to call the police, they brushed me off. They couldn’t find any record of him, like he never existed. But the worst part? Mochi had run off in the chaos. I remember hearing his frantic meows as he darted out the door, disappearing into the night.

I spent days searching for Mochi. Every morning, I’d wake up hoping I’d find him curled up at the foot of my bed, but he was never there. I scoured the neighborhood, calling his name until my voice was hoarse. I put up missing posters on every lamppost and bulletin board I could find, my heart breaking a little more each time I had to tape another one up. I’d sit by the window at night, hoping to catch a glimpse of his familiar silhouette, but the streets remained empty, silent.

I missed him more than I could put into words. Mochi was more than just a pet—he was my companion, my comfort on lonely nights, the one constant in my life of ever-changing faces and fleeting romances. The apartment felt so empty without him, the silence a stark reminder of his absence. I couldn’t help but blame myself—if I hadn’t brought that guy home, maybe Mochi would still be here, curled up in his favorite spot on the couch.

But that was the least of my worries.

Something is wrong with me. The sunlight bruises my skin, leaving dark marks that won’t fade. I can barely step outside without wearing dark glasses and covering every inch of my body. And then there are the nights—those terrifying nights when I wake up floating above my bed, and he’s there, coming through the window. He licks the bite on my leg, drinking my blood before disappearing just before dawn. Each time, I’m left weaker, more anemic, more afraid.

I called the police again, desperate for help, but they only repeated the same thing—there is no such person. But I know he’s real. I can still feel his teeth in my skin, hear the sound of Mochi’s frantic meows, and see his shadow lurking just out of reach.

And now, I don’t know what to do.
