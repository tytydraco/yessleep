I found this diary while looking for books to read at my local library, it seemed like it was stuffed in there, it looked old, at least 20-30 years old. I brought it home and sat down. I set the book on my desk and opened it up. The things I found are… disturbing. I would like to share a small part of this diary. This, man… writes in a very weird format The things I really found… interesting.



Glonbjo I

Hello, this is Glonbjo I. 
Created on June 6th, 1967

(1)
I was born on January 16th, 1932
I am currently 35.
I fought in WWII
I am going to die on November 18th, 1968.
I am not crazy, I can assure you that.

(2)
Are you crazy?
Am I? 
Are you?
And if you are so, why?
Authority is Key

(3)
My brother died 
Mostly because of me
Medicine is fake
My name is Gerobi Glonbjo
My favourite colour is red

(4)
Do you know when I joined the army?
Did you know I never did?
Don’t answer them, seek for what you love
Dad… Why?
Did you do it?

(5)
Even if you are not here, you did it
Everyone says I have ‘Shellshock’
Either they are crazy, or I am
Earth, a beautiful woman 
Everyone hates me, no they don’t.

(6)
And are you going to continue to talk?
Ah, I hope not.
A+ in my test when I was 14
And that didn’t matter 
Authority is not key

(7)
The principles aren’t correct
Trust me
To your generation, I killed him
To who? Kill you? What? 
Top of the class! Ha, funny.

(8)
Hello there! I don’t talk to myself 
Heavily inspired I’m guessing 
Hey, you, watch your mouth young boy
Hector, dad… I killed him
Hello, and goodbye




This is a, very odd and confusing piece to understand. What I know is that this man is suffering from PTSD, what horrible things he must of saw.

This is only a small snippet of this whole ‘diary’ He spirals into insanity, who put this book there…

His name is very unusual too. So far he hasn’t said anything about where he is from. But he keeps referring that he killed someone.

Possibly referring towards his dad, or as if he is telling his dad. Who he killed? I don’t know…

There’s 8 paragraphs/sections of Glonbjo I, each one starting with the same first letter. 
Spelling out ‘IAMDEATH’ with spaces: I AM DEATH… does he mean he is death as he killed so much people during WWII, or is he referencing to something else. Maybe it is just a coincidence, I don’t know.

This whole thing is giving me a sore head, but yet it is so intriguing. I would like to note that if anything happens to me, I have recorded this on file paper, and I have uploaded this onto this new internet thing, I find it fascinating. 

This is set to be posted at 15 minutes to midnight on October 3rd, 2023, just over 17 years from now. I also have the book locked in a safe, only my daughter will know the code, who is currently 3… So It will be a while before she knows.

I need to keep reading, I’m on Glonbjo VI currently, I will be back soon.
