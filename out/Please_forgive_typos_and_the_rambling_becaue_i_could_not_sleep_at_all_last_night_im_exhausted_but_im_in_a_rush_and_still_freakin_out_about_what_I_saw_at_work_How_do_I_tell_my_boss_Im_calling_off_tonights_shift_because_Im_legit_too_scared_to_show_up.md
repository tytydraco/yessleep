I work, or atlesat up until now I *have* worked as a security guard on the night shift at a local park. Mostly my job is great, i get to be outdoors all day and I get to help good people enjoy our park. I pick up litter or do some trail maintenance and I lock up the gates at the end of the night, then just kinda hang out in the truck and keep an eye on things.

sometimes when I'm making the rounds if I find an animal carcass i have to move it. You know, usually roadkill, but sometimes I'll find an animal away from the roads that seems to have passed from natural causes. 

It's kinda morbid and sad, I know, but those remains need to be relocated to keep the public areas of the park safe and clean. We obviously dont want a family on picnic to find a half-rotten squirrel or somebody's dog to come running back to the them with entrails drippin gform their teeth. So I get why we move the bodies. 

But it's gross. 

Now, usually we just toss them in the bed of the pickup, and dump them off an old service road behind the park office (along with fallen limbs, and any other compostable brush). 

About a 10 minute hike away from thedump up the service road, past the parts that are too overgrown for the truck to get through, there's actually a small, like compound of abandoned buildings. I don't know what they are, but if anyone here is good with that urban exploring stuff, you can see the pictures in my post history and guess what they might have been. here's the link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/abandoned/comments/yea1px/i\_work\_as\_a\_security\_guard\_at\_a\_public\_park\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/abandoned/comments/yea1px/i_work_as_a_security_guard_at_a_public_park_and/)

I heard weird noises coming out of the opening on that brick one, that almost sounded like a woman moaning. I hope it was just a mourning dove or something but it freaked me the fuck out in the moment. IT's worse now, after what I saw yesterday. before last night I had actually intended to ask my boss about those buildings,and maybe explore them witha  flashlight. but fat chance now!

Anyway, back to the dump.... 

I've had to dump deeer, squirrel, turtles, woodcucks, even a baby beaver one time. 

Whatever I've dumped back there always gets scattered, or removed entirely, I'd always assumed by scavengers.

It's always sad. But it's not really scary, just gross. 

However, the area where we dump them has always given me the creeps. It just feels negative, and I hate being back there anytime after sunset. Maybe I'm just a baby about it, but I don't mind the dark or the night noises anywhere else in the park. Only there. I've even heard coyotes a few times a while back, kinda yipping and whatnot while I've been locking up some at gates or hiking around at night and I always just thought it was cool. 

But even the smallest noisses back by the udmp make my skin crawl. I almost feel threatened. During the daylight its not hard to kinda shake it off, but at night those noies really settle into my mind, you know? 

One time I had to be back there kinda late, later than I'd want to be and I saw a bunch of eyes staring at me from the treeline when I was back there right after dusk. 

Having heard the coyotes I'd assumed it was them, waiting for me to dump them a snack. But it was a little unnerving how they never took their eyes off me. That's kinda why i don't think they were deer. Usually deer don't stay still for so long. They look at you and then go back to grazing. or they get spooked and runaway. But these.... Whatever animals they were, they just stared at me. 

I'm big into wildlife, same as when I heard coyotes, part of me thought his was kinda sick. So I went back in daylight and took a picture of the only print I could find, half way up a short embakement. It wasn't like any animal print I'd seen before, so I posted it on an animal tracking sub and people there said it was just a double imprint from a deer. 

There's no telling whether what made that print was even one of the animasl that was looking at me that night, but IF they were deer, they were acting weird. That's all I'm saying. 

SO anyway, that area back there just feels off. Feels wrong, and very... unwelcoming. 

At another point in time, I had to move the carcass of a wild raccoon that I kind of recognized. we had a big chunker boy who would visit our dumpsters same time very night. Obviously he was still a wild animalbut I liked seeing him around and had a carefree kind of attachement to him. But then after a while he stopped showing, and I ended up finding a raccoon carcass, same size from what I could tell, on a nearby road. It didn't seem right to dump him back there for the crows and foxes and coyotes to just unceremonioulsy tear apart, so I took some time on a lunch break to build a burial mound around him, with heavy sycaomore logs. 

Each log weighed around 50+ pounds, and I wedged them in such a way that they couldn't really be rolled away without huge effort. 

I would periodically check the mound and once took a picture of the naturally defleshed skull and posted it on a bone collecting sub, just because I thought it was kind of morbidly interesting to see the fracture lines. 

Here's a link to that picture: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bonecollecting/comments/y7aqp1/i\_work\_at\_a\_public\_park\_and\_occasionally\_i\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonecollecting/comments/y7aqp1/i_work_at_a_public_park_and_occasionally_i_have/)

THen I put it back, because honestly it just felt wrong to do anything else with it. But on a shift a few nights ago I found the mound totally opened up and the skull gone. 

here's a link to so you can visualize what i"m talking about: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bonecollecting/comments/ycvdaf/before\_my\_shift\_today\_i\_went\_to\_check\_on\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonecollecting/comments/ycvdaf/before_my_shift_today_i_went_to_check_on_a/)

I was kinda kicking myself for not truly burying it, and felt bad. Normally i don't have any sentimental attachement to the poor creatures that i gotta place back there, but this one that I recognized just felt more special. 

Well that skull being gone kinda pissed meoff, but I took a little bit of comfort in the thought that wherever he ended up, he was going to eventually reintegrate into the ecoysystem he came from. Sounds cheesy, but the circle of life stuff, you know?

But I was wrong. 

Last night at a little after midnight, the end of my shift, after I had locked every building and every gate, I came back to the office to plug in the park phone, return the keys to the truck, the whole bit. 

I signed off the guard notes and went to leave but i wasn't being careful,, and when I opened the door ot teh office the park cat (Simba) ran right out . 

he is NOT an outdoor cat. He has a collar and he's up to date with his flea treatments but obviously neither of those things would help him if got into a scrap with the coyotes I'd been hearing. So I ran after him. 

Word of adviee if you're ever trying to retrieve a cat DO NOT RUN AFTER IT. 

He booked it, and after only a cuple yard hew as too far away int eh dark for me to even knowwhere he went. 

...But he went in the general direction of the dump. 

I zipped back to the office, took the park phone, a box of his treats, and his laser pointer. 

then rattling treats and tryin to walk calm so I wouldn't scare him further, I hiked back to the dump on foot and started searching. I was yelling his name, and of course cats don't fucking come when you call, so this was pointless. But I had to try. 

I used the park phone to video this, partially because it has a bright light, and partially because I wanted a record of what I was doing so I could ask my boss if it consitituted owrk. Wanted to get paid for it if possible since I shouldeve left at midnight, but now I was stuck there late trying to save Simba. 

Thevideo is posted on my u history and you'lll see what I found.

. I ended up following the road back to the abandoned complex, and my light caught something in an old concrete culvert of some sort. I thought it could be him and when I gota closer look I shuddered and porbably would have shat my pants if I hadn't taken care of that earlier in my shift. 

There awas pile of animal bonesin the middle of this culvert. THere was also some satanic garffiti 

here's the video link if you want to see it. But be warned those are real animal remains [https://www.reddit.com/user/tasteofhemlock/comments/yes7oe/but\_if\_a\_late\_night\_last\_night\_at\_work\_last\_night/](https://www.reddit.com/user/tasteofhemlock/comments/yes7oe/but_if_a_late_night_last_night_at_work_last_night/)

&#x200B;

so at this opint I had ogoosebumps and shivers on my spine and I wanted to fucking book it. 

But I didn't want to leave the cat, especially after that. I kinda quietly asked him to come back a couple times then full on yelled for him one more time,but my own voice fucking scared me.

But part of me was like, if people are doing weird ritualistic shit back here I need better evidence than this grainy night time video, so I took a couple pictures. and then I bolted. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I was trembling, way to o scared to stay back there another minute. It's a miracle i didn't trip because it was dark as hell and I was panicking. 

&#x200B;

I ran all the way back to the office, feeling like the devil was right behind me. 

&#x200B;

When I got back to the office, i couldn't believe my luck, i heard simba's bell. 

I couldn't realy breath a sigh of relief though, because my stomach was stiill in my throat. He seemed spooked too because he was hiding under the truck. 

&#x200B;

I tried to get him out, but he wouldn't come for treats, he wouldn't even follow the laser pointer out like I had hoped. 

You can see this in the video too. here's a link [https://www.reddit.com/user/tasteofhemlock/comments/yeshse/last\_night\_after\_running\_away\_like\_a\_scared\_bitch/](https://www.reddit.com/user/tasteofhemlock/comments/yeshse/last_night_after_running_away_like_a_scared_bitch/)

It cuts off, but I had to put everything down to scoop him upa nd then run inside. 

This morning I looked closer at the pcitures. They still give me chills, but I could recognize the skull. IT was the raccoon I had tried to protect. 

Anyway I posted the pics and mentioned that when I got back tot eh warm, light office i was way too scared to go right back out. I sat there cuddling simba for a while, wanted tos tay to daylight. But I had to be outta there before the morning guys came in at 5, otherwise I'd be a laughing stock. 

people commented on those posts saying I was a coward for being so scared. I already knew that. 

But they also said that this just looked like teenagers messing around and trying to prank me,, it being almost hallloween and all. here's the posts with those pictures: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bonecollecting/comments/yeswv1/long\_story\_short\_i\_found\_that\_raccoon\_skull\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonecollecting/comments/yeswv1/long_story_short_i_found_that_raccoon_skull_that/)

thepeople who said this is all just teenage edge lords, they're probably right. But i still feel really squeamish about the whole thing. 

However I do need tospeak to my boss about it.  I definitely open to suggestions on how to approach that conversation. 

**I will edit this post with an update after I call him**

EDITED: UPDATE.... FUCK ME!!!1!!

I have to go to work

I called my boss and just told him straight.. Described everything I had seen. And what described the same stuf I've told you all in this post. I told him I did not want to come in because I didn't feel safe. He ddint' even sound surprised he just goes, "THOSE DAMNED KIDS!!"

I'm like 'huh?'

There was a pause on the line and he says, "nothing man. I mean we've had kids trespassing after hours, to like.... uh... mess around or party or whatever. DOn't worry bout it. Just come in for your shift."

I reiterated that I was BEYOND uncomfortable. You know how embarassing it is to admit to your boss that ypu're scared? 

He said: "They're just stupid fucking teenagers messing around. If you don't show up for your shift, you lose your job." Then he hung up. 

I almost want to post on antiwork or something, i feel like this is ridiculous. my boss is acting like the fucking devil- how he just yelled at me and hung up. I've never had a supervisor do antyhing so disrespectful before. but honestly I'm too stressed to even think clearly. 

So I typed out this update just because I said was going to and then I'm jetting off. 

God!

I can't lose this job right now, but i'm for sure going to be using downtime in the truck later to search for something new. FUck me. 

I will make a point of asking him about those buildings though.

**I'll update this post on my lunch break. or whenever I get some downtime**

EDIT: UPDATE 

I know this edit comes quikcer than you expected. But I can't wait for lunch break to let you know what hapened..

my boss was acting completely weird when I came in. At first he was pretending like nothing out of the ordinary had happened. 

He just asked how my morning was. I looked at him like, are you serious?

Then he told me to put last night out of my mind, as it wasn't a big deal. Just some kids getting their kicks

Then he gave me a short list of assignments: Pick up litter on the south side, fuel the truck, change the garbages by the playground.... 

I told him that if I saw roadkill I was not going to be willing to dump it today. He shrugged and said, "Just let me know where you see it. I'll have the morning guys take care of it before we open the gates for the public."

Then he was on his way out the door, telling me he hoped I'd have a good day, and I remembered I wanted to ask him about the buildings. 

When I said, "Hey Luke, I have a question before you go." He was like, "sure man, what's up." 

I said, "A few nights ago I went for a hike up the service road,, past the dump. I found some abandened buildings--" His eyes narrowed but I pressed on, "--and I was wondering what they used to be."

He was frowning so hard, it was crazy.  I actually backed up a bit because I felt like he might.... I dunno. Like he might hit me or something. 

All he said was, "I don't know. THey used to be part of some kind of water treatment facility I think. DOn't go back there. It's not safe." 

THen he opened the door and said, "Oh, and don't worry about those little fuckers who messed around back there. *They won't be causing any more problems any time soon.*"

Then he left. 

And I'm... 

I'm not trying to sound paranoid, but hte way he said "They wont be causeing any more problems any time soon.".... it freaked me out. I cant get it out my mind, and the more I think about it the more I worry that maybe he did something to them, like...

LIke killed them or something?

I know that sounds insane, but honestly everything right now is just out of control

I do NOT want to go back there again, but the fact that he got so weird and warned me not to and then said those kids wouldn't be a problem... I guess I'm just thinking the worst. 

Before this morning I never would have said my boss could be a crazy person or a.... murderer. But you never really know a person. I'm taking a flashlight, and my personal phone and hiking back there again before its anywhere near dark. I'm not gonna linger, but I'm gonna check each building as quick as I can. and just make sure theres nothing I nee to call the police for. 

&#x200B;

... OH! and I'm taking a prybar with me. To pop open the boarded up doors and windows. And I guess because I'll just feel safer if I have something I could use as a weapon if I somehow needed one. 

&#x200B;

**I'll edit this post with an update within a couple hours, hopefully to let you all know that this is all just me being stupid and paranoid and nothing to worry about because I found nothing.** 

&#x200B;

edit Oh jesus am i going crazy?

what the fucking fuck is going on here

first i went to the building with the open door. The one where I thought I heard a woman moaning all those days ago. Feels like an eternity. Like a different life. 

I shined teh light around and i swaear to fucking GOD i heard a giggle, then clear as daylight, a woman's voice. "Are you back to play, my prince?"

I nearly fucking jumped out of my skin

Her voice was coming up from the stairwell at the back of the second room from teh door. It might be visible in the pcitures i posted earlier. I don't know. 

Either way, standing there at the door way I couldn't believe what i was hearing. And I sure as fuck didn't have the balls to go any furtherinto that building. I though she must have been a junky or psycho hiding down there. Maybe not even alone, maybe to ambush me. 

But I had the wherewithall to remember I was a security guard. I said, "Ma'am, I'm park security, you need to exit this building immediately. it's not safe."

SHe fucking mocked me. "It's not safe? Oh no. Is a bigs trong man gonnaa come rescue me and then.... use me?" she started laughing

I wanted to barf. 

I told her, "Ma'am I'm calling the police."

she stopped laughing and said, "I'm sorry. I'm just scared. He chained me up down here and it's been so long since I've heard a human voice."

My head was buzzing. Chained her up? Who? 

I could only assume she meant my boss. My instninct should have been to jsut fucking get far far away and call the poliice riht then and there to handle this. 

But the idea that some poor woman was chained up down there against her will made my blood boil. 

I couldn't leave her there, so I buttoned up what little courage i had. At this point it was just desperation And i stepped inot the building. 

It smelled terrible . LIke shit and rotting flesh. 

There was broken glass and rusted scrap metal everywhere. I shined the light at the stair well. 

And I heard her kinda crooning, "Are you coming to rescue me mister. I'll let you... fuck me. Or do whatever you want. I don't think my prince would mind."

I actually told her to shut up. And she did, but the silence wasn't any better. I felt like i was stepping through a gate to hell entering that building, and each step towads the stair well took every ounce of my will. 

I tend to be pretty squeamish about spiritual stuff and haven't gone to church in probably a decade. But I was praying the OUr Father the whole fucking time under my breath. 

Then finally I was at the top of the stairs and I shined my light down. the stair well turned half way down, and i had to decend. 

Each step I just kept saying "Jesus please." 

I don't even know what I was fully asking. It was almost inarticulate. Just "Jesus please. Jesus please. Jesus please."

At the corner, I swung the light down and saw her. Must have been a 30 year old woman, chained to the ceiling, completely nude. Her skin was grotesquely pale. Her hair was matted and dank, and her eyes utterly mad. *Maddening* even.. But she had this pouty look on her face and kept making like a kissy expression. THe worst part is that she looked very pregnant. She was thin, but her belly was massively distended. 

She said, "Quick, give me a good fuck before my husband comes back. If you're lucky you might even feel the baby kick. But leave the chains. THey get me so wet."

She kinda gyrated her hips and licked her lips. 

I grimaced.

I was mortified, I couldn't look away. now that I'd seen her I was repulsed. neither I couldn't go unchain her because I couldn't possibly go any nearer. I was trembling and could barely keep my feet. 

"Jesus please."

When I said that she kinda recoiled and then laughed, but speaking seemed to break my shock. I turned back up the stairs and rushed out into the daylight then I barfed all over the wall. I leaned against the door shaking. 

When I realized i had an erection i started sobbing. 

She yelled after me, "why don't you come back here and let me *eat* that hard cock?!" 

I stumbled away from that building and her voice trailed after me. "Do you like the little messages out there. My husband wrote those for our babies. They've been bad. They know they aren't allowed to come out and play unless he's here to keep them in line and keep them safe and...." 

Her voice rung in my ears and I thought I'd go insane.  I plugged them.

My eyes swung around the complex. 

and saw the graffiti. 

*fuck*

*kill*

leering faces spray painted on every wall

*wife and kids trapped*

The culvert... where I'd found the stack of bones, the red pentagram. 

*Satan <3 you*

 

I closed my eyes. THis all had to be crazy delusions. But that woman seemed real. And maybe she was just crazy too. IF she'd been down there along time she probably had some... Stockholm syndrome or something. God. poor lady. 

But one thing was certain, she was pregnant, and she had been talking about other *babies.*

kids. 

My boss had said they wouldn't be a problem any more. He'd warned me away from these buildings. And I'd found a pregnant madwoman chained down there talking about her husband, her prince.

I couldn't make sense of what anything I'd seen and heard. I was overwhelmed with terror and all I wanted was to run away and forget this. but there's some stupid part of me that's good. 

I wouldn't say it was any sense of heroism or valor. I literally just knew I couldn't live with myself  if I'd run away from actually children in peril. I'd felt bad enough when I' thought i'd abandoned simba....

I couldn't run away. I wish I'd been smart enough to dial the police right then and there. But honestly, my mind was-- and still is a shitstorm of fear and chaos. 

I heard her voice spilling out the open door, "you gonna go check on the little ones?"

How the fuck she had any idea what I was doing, I didn't know or care. I chalked it up to conicidence. 

distantly, i heard her say, "They're over there, just peek on in."

SOmehow i already knew that. 

I was looking at the building with the blue graffiti. 

I walked up the stairs, thankfully the sun was still out. Because that little scrap of goodness in my soul wouldn't have been enough to force me up those steps if it had been dark.

I used the pry bar and popped open the door on the building with the blue graffiti and shined my light in there and I felt myself nearly swoon. There were bone stacks EVERYWHERE in there. and it smelled far worse than the first building.

The stacks were all different patterns. SOme were tall like cairns, but skeletal instead of stone. Others were sprawling across the floor like sprawling grizzly mandalas. 

And all along the walls were chained the freaks. Their beady eyes were on me. 

They were infantile, but sure as hell NOT human. Some had gangly claws, some had beastly legs, with hooves or paws instead of feet. 

They had hideous like gargoyle-ish faces. Uglier than sin. LIke if picasso and Goya got together to paint a hybrid child.

... some even had horns.  

And all seemed stunned silent. Whether by the sudden light, or by my sudden arrival I had no idea. 

Then one smacked its dog like jaws, and i saw the drool dangling from its haggard lips. And the others seemed to wake from their surprise, and suddenly there was a hellish cacophony pouring out of that evil room. 

Their chorus was unintelligible, there weren't any words. Just shrieks and giggles and moans, but I could tell by the look in their eyes and the slavering of their tongues... THey were hungry and I looked like food.

Clear as crystal, a miserable image blinded my mind. A picture flashed before my eyes: my bones arranged in their own little stack in one dark corner of this damnable building. I saw my ribs splayed like wings, and my skull grinning stupidly atop my propped up spine. All skeletal pieces stripped clean, just like those roadkill bits that decorated the floor before me then. 

&#x200B;

I stumbled back, slammed teh door and finally found the strength to run. 

I actually ran to the office and when I got there I wasn't even panting. It was like I had wings. 

I Grabbed Simba and carried him to my car. 

Then I got in and called the police.... 

I didn't think they'd believe all that shit about the... demons? or whatever they were. So i only told them I worked as as security guard at this park. Gave them the address, and then said I'd found a pregnant woman chained up in an abandoned building out back. Told them I couldn't help her, because i chickened out and told them thehy'd better send an ambulence- maybe several. 

I told them teh woman had been raving about her other babies. And that the police should check the other buildings on site. 

They told me not to leave. 

Which fucing sucks because the only reason i put simba and myself in the car was because my gut was telling me to do just that. 

&#x200B;

**I'll edit this post with an update after I speak with the police. Then I'm going home and never setting foot in this park again.** 

&#x200B;

edit: update, it's only been 5 minutes but i'm anxious as fuck. I want the cops here now. 

wait...

&#x200B;

I jsut got a text form my boss. 

He said, "I warned you not to go back there. We're on our way."

We? What the fuck does that mean? 

How does he even know?

Every fiber of my being is telling me to get the fuck out of here right the fuck now. But the cops said stay and if I go that might... i dunno, fuck up their investigation? 

My head is swimming. I don't think I could even tell them what I really saw. I know what I think I saw but that can't be right? Maybe... Maybemy imagination filled in some blanks?

What the fuck am I supposed to do?

**I'll edit with an update once I decide if i should stay or go**
