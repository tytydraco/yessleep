***\[Transcript Begins\]***

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** So… this is your debriefing room, huh? I was kinda expecting something fancier…

&#x200B;

**Young:** Why’d you think ours would be fancier?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I dunno, I just thought it would? I mean, you guys are like, spooks or something, right?

&#x200B;

**Young:** We’re not spooks… we just deal with things that it’s better if the public isn’t widely informed about.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Isn’t that like, the *definition* of a spook?

&#x200B;

**Young:** We’re not spooks!

&#x200B;

*\[They are interrupted by the sound of a door opening as Director Durand enters. There is the sound of movement, followed by Durand sitting down.\]*

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Sorry to keep you waiting. Let’s get right into it, shall we?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Right! Of course… sorry, this is kinda new to me, being on the other side of this. Usually I’m the one doing the interviews.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** I’m aware. I’ve read the previous reports you’ve passed along to Justice. So, let’s go over what happened, alright? Let’s start with you, Detective Hawthorne. Can you clearly identify yourself for the record, please?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Right.... My name is River Hawthorne. I’m a Detective with the Toronto Police Service, and I’ve been with them for about six years, although it’s really only been the past two and a half years that I’ve been in touch with people like Justice. 

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Right. Now, for the record, can you recap your prior experiences with this Entity, not including your recent misadventure with Miss Young.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yes… yes I can. [In May of 2023, I worked a murder case](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/1bkfewm/peep_show/) where a man was butchered in his own home. His roommate claimed he’d brought a girl back that night, and that she had been the one who’d killed him. We found enough evidence to confirm that *something* had torn the man apart, and that odds are it wasn’t the roommate, but we didn’t find much else and to add a little cherry on top, the roommate died soon after, sending the trail cold. Then, things picked up again [about a month later](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/1bl2j0d/fetish/) when a colleague of mine, Detective Angelo, claimed to have encountered some sort of ‘*entity*’ while investigating a double homicide. *Entity* really is the only word I’ve got to describe this thing, because it sure as hell wasn’t a person and according to him, this thing had killed his partner, Detective Horvath.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Right, we have transcripts of the relevant interviews on record.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yeah, but those transcripts don’t cover what happened next. I did pass that information on to Justice at the time, but do you want me to recap it for the record here?

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Please.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Less than a week after he gave me his statement and I sent it along to Justice, Detective Angelo turned up dead. The officer they’d assigned to keep an eye on him found him in his bedroom. He’d been almost completely torn apart, as if he’d been mauled by an animal. Knowing what I know about Angelo and this supposed *‘Entity’,* I feel as if I can say with reasonable certainty that it… excuse my phrasing here: ‘*got to him.*’

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Why is that?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Well, every account I’ve heard about it has one thing in common. Every victim of this thing’s been killed by their own… for lack of a better term… *fantasy*. I mean, you saw the transcripts, right? That guy and his roommate? They had a thing for voyeurism. The roommate used to watch him fuck on camera and according to his statement, he also watched him die on camera before it came for him. And Angelo’s partner, Horvath? That guy was on *record* as a bit of a freak… and when the Entity appeared to him, it appeared as some sort of Dominatrix before it crushed his head under her heel. As for Angelo… he’d told me that the Entity had appeared to him as a man in a dog mask. No…  not just appeared. He’d told me that it’d *become* a man in a dog mask, right after it killed Horvath. Changing from a woman in leather, to a man who looked a hell of a lot like a man he’d been seeing, dressed in full fetish gear. Apparently he and his boyfriend had a thing for that kind of play… not judging… just… Look. Either way, when I heard about the state they’d found his body in, I knew that it had gotten to him. And after Angelo died, things went dark. Well… they went dark in Toronto, at least.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Yes, I didn’t hear of any updates to the case following Detective Angelo’s death.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yeah, I get the feeling that its little run in with Angelo and his partner convinced whatever that thing was to move along for a bit. Things quieted down, but I kept my ear to the ground, listening for any interesting cases that might pop up. And over the next few months, I heard a few stories.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Stories? And did you report these to Justice?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I might’ve mentioned them in private, but I sent no official correspondence about them since I was only going off of rumors. I only send something her way unless I’ve got something more substantial, and these cases weren’t in my jurisdiction. I *did* however make note of them in case they became relevant in the future, hence why I’m mentioning them now.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** I see. Can you elaborate on these cases?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Well,in August of 2023, there was a 21 year old man admitted to hospital in London, Ontario after his roommate found him, lying in his bed, alive but missing chunks of flesh. He died in hospital soon after, but not from his injuries. No. What killed him was some sort of unidentified viral infection. Digging into the victim, I found a profile he’d made on some obscure forum talking about something called ‘*bugchasing*’. Apparently he was into some *very* weird shit, and thought he’d found someone to roleplay his fantasy with.

&#x200B;

**Young:** We did examine the body in that instance, Director… no conclusive source for the virus or examples of transmission. It died with him.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Then there was another woman from Cambridge who was found vacuum sealed in plastic on her bed around December. She’d been completely drained of blood. Friends ID’d her as a member of the local BDSM community. Apparently she’d been into that sort of thing. Then of course there were smaller stories that were harder to verify. A man in Hamilton found asphyxiated at a gloryhole, a woman in Guelph who was apparently smothered with her own shit in a bar bathroom and another man in Kitchener who’d been and I quote: ‘*Killed by excessive trauma to the anus, causing a fatal prolapse.*’

&#x200B;

**Durand:** *\[There is a notable pause on the record\]*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yeah, that was… that was my reaction too. In each case, the body was described as being *‘partially eaten’.* The other departments had chalked this up to some sort of animal getting to the bodies. Racoons, household pets… although I’ve heard that kind of bullshit before, and I’m sure you have too. I’m sure if you reached out for the autopsy photos, you’d find that the bite marks aren’t consistent with the ones on the victims from Toronto and Detective Angelo. And before you ask, the only reason I *didn’t* try reaching out is because I had no official reason to. These weren’t my cases. On paper, there’s nothing for me to investigate here.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Duly noted.

**Hawthorne:** Even with Angelo… I mean, the general consensus was that his *‘shapeshifter’* story wasn’t legitimate. A lotta people thought the poor guy had a bit of a break from reality after watching his friend and partner die, and Angelo hadn’t really argued it. He’d just mumble stuff like: *‘I don’t remember what I saw.’* and drop the subject. And maybe that’s true. Maybe he wasn’t playing with a full deck when I’d interviewed him. Lord knows, I’ve seen that movie before. Shock is a hell of a drug. When you’re panicking, it’s easy to misremember details. But a woman turning into a man in full puppy play fetish gear? Yeah. That’s a hell of a detail to make up. Maybe if I didn’t know the things that I know, I’d have dismissed it as crazy talk too. But by now I’ve heard enough wild stories to know when someone is lying or misremembering and when someone has seen something legitimately impossible. I know for a fact that Angelo wasn’t misremembering. I heard it in his voice when he spoke to me. He knew what he’d seen. He could barely believe it, but he knew what he’d seen… he knew…

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Detective Hawthorne… with all due respect, you’re preaching to the choir here. You don’t need to defend your late colleague to us.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Right… sorry… it’s easy to forget that you guys are used to this kinda thing.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** That’s alright. Still… sounds as if you didn’t take its killing of Detective Angelo all that well. Were you two close?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** He was a good cop… a good colleague. So was Horvath. I didn’t like the idea of something just… killing them… killing them and walking away…

&#x200B;

**Durand:** I understand… so, moving on to more recent events. When you saw evidence of this entity's resurgence, you took action, correct?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** That’s correct.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Walk me through that.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Well, on March 19th,the body of Dan Schmitt was discovered by a local garbage collector. His remains had been torn apart, stuffed into several trash bags and left out by the curb for collection. The trash collector initially hadn’t noticed anything off until one of the bags split after being picked up, spilling the contents all over the street. The officers who later arrived on the scene confirmed the remains as human and later examined the house… they found it vacant and almost immaculately clean, although later forensics did determine that Mr. Schmitt had been killed and dismembered in his own bedroom.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** And how did you get involved?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I’d heard about the case in passing from one of my colleagues and although it was certainly gristly, I didn’t originally flag it as related to the other deaths I’d been looking into. Not until I heard about the escort service.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Escort service?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Apparently, an examination of Mr. Schmitts personal correspondence confirmed that he was a frequent customer of a local escort service run by a gentleman by the name of Roman Mazzetta. Specifically, he seemed to have a thing for maids. He’d hire some girl to come by his house, put on a sexy outfit and clean for him while he played the part of the lascivious pervert. That’s when it all clicked. Another victim, killed by their fantasy…

&#x200B;

**Durand:** You believed it was the same entity?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yes… I had to lean on my Sergeant pretty hard to pass the case along to me, but he owed me a few favors and I made a pretty convincing case that the M.O. here was consistent with the previous victims so he agreed to let me take over and as soon as the case was mine, I called Justice.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** For the record, can you elaborate on your relationship with Justice Young?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Well, I first came into contact with her through a mutual friend after having my own… for lack of a better term… supernatural troubles. We stayed in touch after that, and occasionally grab a drink together. I would describe us as friends… I mean, secretive job aside, Justice doesn’t really strike me as a *‘spook’.* Honestly, I’d call her a hippie.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Thanks, I guess?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Look, you’re the only person I know who’s gone out in public wearing a fucking witch hat on a night that *wasn’t* in October. I love you. But you’re a hippie. Own it.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I mean… yeah… I guess…?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Anyway, *occasionally* when we meet up, I pass along anything I’ve got that might be up the FRB’s alley. Although for the record, I don’t know a whole hell of a lot about what it is you guys actually *do* aside from *‘deal with weird shit.*

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Right… so you contacted Justice for her help in dealing with this Entity?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** If you recall from Detective Angelo’s interview - he watched Horvath put a bullet in this thing's head, and it didn’t even slow it down. I figured if I was going to be looking into it, I should speak to an expert first.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Right… fair enough, I suppose. Justice, what can you tell me about this meeting you had?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Um, we met at the usual bar. River mentioned that the Entity might have resurfaced. She… well, she specifically called it ‘*The Kinky One*’ since we didn’t technically have a name for it at the time. She asked if there was anyone we had who’d be available to help her look into it and I’d told her that our Hunting team was stretched pretty thin at the time, I wasn’t sure if we’d be able to spare anyone without any hard evidence.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Which I still think is kinda bullshit, I mean you’re dating one of the girls on that team, right? The one with the really heavy eyeshadow… what’s her name…

&#x200B;

**Young:** It’s Nina, and I told you that she was out of town! I told you that I’d need to put in a request with Director Durand, and see what happened. *You* were the one who said you didn’t know if you had time to wait!

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** If you’ve got a lead, you don’t just sit around with your thumb up your ass, you follow it! This thing could’ve dropped off the map again by the time you guys had the bandwidth to start looking for it!

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Ladies… please. Just settle down. Justice, please continue.

&#x200B;

**Young:** *\[Sigh\]* Look… River did have a point. It would’ve been better to pursue it while the lead was still relatively fresh. She asked if I could disclose any information on what this thing might be, so I *may* have bent the rules for her a little, in the interest of public safety.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** What exactly did you tell her?

&#x200B;

**Young:** I told her that based on the transcripts and police reports she’d previously sent me, we *might* be dealing with a Mimic. That was the primary theory our team had before the trail went cold. The M.O. fit. The ability to change forms and prominent carnivorous diet… both traits of Mimics. Plus the *honey trap* hunting behavior also tracked. A lot of Mimics who choose to hunt humans tend to lean toward that strategy for the sake of convenience. It’s a good way to get people alone, and to lower their guard. It’s why vampires and sirens use similar hunting strategies. Like I said, I’m aware that sharing that much information with unauthorized personnel through an unapproved channel is technically against protocol, but in the interest of public safety-

&#x200B;

**Durand:** It’s fine, Justice.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Oh thank God…

&#x200B;

**Durand:** So… I assume that Detective Hawthorne asked you how to kill it?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I mean… it was the obvious fucking question…

&#x200B;

**Young:** She did… yes. I recommended either cursed bullets or a weapon with the right type of enchantment, although when neither of those came across as a viable option, I suggested a more traditional poison. I’m not exactly *great* with that kind of stuff, but I did dabble in magic during my University days, and the spell to create the right type of toxin isn’t particularly complicated, so…

&#x200B;

**Durand:** You agreed to create it.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I did… after which Detective Hawthorne convinced me to ride along with her the following day while she went after Roman Mazzetta.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** In my defense, I wasn’t entirely sure if Mazzetta would be human or not. I mean… come on, judging by Angelo’s description of it, what was really going to stop it from killing him, setting up shop in his place and pimping itself out for easy prey? I just wanted to cover my bases.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** I see…

&#x200B;

**Young:** I’d just like to state for the record that I *did* inform her that I don’t work in the field anymore, considering what happened last time.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yeah, yeah. [We know how you met your girlfriend](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/uhz8mb/trashy_nina/). But I needed you with me!

&#x200B;

**Durand:** So… this was why Justice was present at the sting operation you held to capture Mazzetta?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yes. I mean, I’m sure this might come as a shock, but it turns out that Mazzetta sorta had a history with the Toronto police. Drugs, money laundering and, surprise, surprise, pimping. I had some colleagues in the sex crimes division who were happy to lend a hand in exchange for an easy arrest. We had one of them pose as a client at a local hotel, while Justice and myself listened in on a wire in the next door over. I just want to state that I did *not* put your researcher in danger, and had her follow protocol for this sort of thing.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I was kinda just there to have the poison on hand, in case it went south.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Right.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** And ultimately, nothing really happened! I mean. Something did happen… Mazzetta showed up… and he kinda broke like a fucking egg the moment I put any pressure on him.

&#x200B;

**Young:** It was actually kinda pathetic…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yeah, even the hooker that was with him was just sorta standing there like: *‘Really man?’*

&#x200B;

**Young:** He wasn’t having a good day…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** He was *not* having a good day.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Right…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I questioned him about his relationship with Schmitt… and I got the impression that his death was news to Mazzetta. I mean, that guy folded like a deck chair, but he didn’t strike me as either a killer or anything other than human. When I pushed him, he gave me the name of the girl he’d sent to Schmitt that night. Hailey Bianchi. Mazzatta had been adamant that she couldn’t have been involved in Schmitt’s murder, claiming that she didn’t have the disposition or the physical prowess to kill a man like Schmitt, and that he hadn’t seen a drop of blood on her when he’d picked her up after the encounter… although for the record, these just contributed to my suspicion that Hailey Bianchi was just the… for lack of a better term… *‘face’* the entity was wearing at the time. At my insistence, he gave me her address before I let the other Detectives take him away.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** And this is where things took a turn, isn’t it?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** *\[Pause\]* Yes…

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Walk me through it.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** The address Mazzetta had given me belonged to a fairly run down apartment on the edge of town. Justice and I gained access to it, and made our way up to Haley's apartment where we forced the door open. The… *\[Pause\]* the apartment itself looked simultaneously lived in and abandoned. The place was a mess, but it was an old mess. Old dishes that had been left out on the coffee table were starting to grow mold and what I can only describe as the distinct smell of mildew. But no evidence of any bodies present… which was, unfortunately, *not* reassuring. We did a sweep of the apartment, but we didn’t find much. A heroin stash. Used needles. Signs that whoever was living here wasn’t exactly living their best life… but other than that, no evidence that Hailey or anything else was present at the scene.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Right.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I consulted Justice on what to do next, and she suggested filing a report with you and doing surveillance and after confirming that there was no further action that could be taken at this time, I agreed with that assessment. We were in the middle of returning to our vehicle when we… *\[pause\]* we ran into Justice’s girlfriend.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Nina Valentine?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Yes… we saw Nina in the hallway as we were leaving. I was originally a little surprised to see her, and asked what she was doing there. She mentioned that you’d sent her to investigate the Schmitt case.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** I see…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** We talked for a bit in the hall, I told her that we’d been looking into the same case and she’d suggested we compare notes… she said she’d heard something about other victims and thought we might be able to figure out where the Entity had moved on to. I recall that I’d suggested we grab a bite at a nearby bar, but she’d said she wanted to get a look at Bianchi’s apartment, so we went back with her. She looked around for a bit, and talked a bit while she did, although I don’t really remember what she said… I remember her flirting with Justice a bit.

&#x200B;

**Young:** She… did make some comments. Which did strike me as a little odd. Not to get too into my private life but… Nina doesn’t usually flirt a lot in public. Usually it’s the other way around. And she was getting… well… uncharacteristically handy, especially with River present.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yeah, I’ve never really noticed her to be the handsy type. She was even sorta giving me a look which like… I don’t really swing that way? And I mean… she’d never behaved that way toward me before.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I noticed it too. It wasn’t like her… and she kept on touching me and saying things and… so I stabbed her… I just…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I just heard screaming, and when I turned around, Justice had put the knife right in her stomach and was stabbing her. Nina was screaming, and Justice was trying to force her to the ground. I remember trying to force them apart, but that’s when I noticed that there wasn’t any blood on her knife… then ‘Nina’ just grabbed me. And the next thing I knew, she’d thrown me halfway across the fucking room. I… I might’ve briefly lost consciousness at that point.

&#x200B;

**Young:** You kinda did… and that *thing*… it just glared at me. It held its stomach like it was in pain, but after a moment, it just started toward me again, grinning at me. It shouldn’t have even been able to stand… I mean… if it was a Mimic, it shouldn’t have even been standing. Or even if it was, it should’ve been in more pain! It should’ve been running but… it wasn’t. I was still holding the knife but… it didn’t seem scared of it, it just seemed excited. I couldn’t get past it so all I could do was back away. I kept screaming for River, but…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** I heard it… I remember looking up and seeing that thing. It didn’t look like Nina anymore, though… it was just this… I’m not sure how to describe it… this mass of writhing te-

&#x200B;

**Young:** It must’ve… reverted to its true form… because of the poison.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Whatever it was… I just saw it getting closer to her. The only thing I could think to do was just go for my gun and start shooting. I didn’t know if it would do any good but… I guess it got its attention…

&#x200B;

**Young:** It gave me enough time to get into one of the rooms and close the door.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yeah… I saw you get clear while it was turning to look at me. That’s when I saw it changing again into… *\[Pause\]*

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Into…?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Look, let’s just say it knew what kind of guy I liked, and leave it at that… I had some room to run. So I made my way to the door. Not *all* the way to the door, just far enough to try and kite him… spent a few bullets to keep his attention. I was sorta hoping Justice would try to get out the window, actually, but…

&#x200B;

**Young:** I mean… I considered it… but I didn’t want to leave you to die. And when I saw the stuff in the bedroom, I had to try it. I heard you shooting… so I came out. I had the used needles with me and I still had the knife, I figured that maybe I might be able to stun it for a bit.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** How’d that work out?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Well, I guess I didn’t die. It heard me coming and turned its head to look at me. I… don’t think it was good with being blindsided like that. I was able to stick it with the knife and the needles before it could react. It seemed to hurt it, just as it had before, but still not to the extent that I would’ve liked. I could see it trying to shift again… I would assume trying to find a way to regain its advantage.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yeah, I saw it trying to change… that’s why I just put the last of my bullets into it. Didn’t do a hell of a lot of damage, but I think it kept it disoriented long enough for Justice to get away.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Although you could’ve waited until I was further away before you started shooting.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Did I hit you?

&#x200B;

**Young:** No, but-

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Then you’re fine. You made it to the door, and we booked it the fuck out of there.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Yeah… I did look back to see if it was giving chase, but as far as I can tell, it wasn’t. That said, I don’t think we harmed it in any meaningful way. I imagine that the only reason it didn’t try and pursue us was to avoid being seen by other residents of the building, who had been alerted by the gunshots. A lot of them had stepped out of their apartments, by that point.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Yeah… too many witnesses.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Right, after which you came here for shelter?

&#x200B;

**Young:** And to debrief, sir…

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Right… *\[Sigh\]* I don’t suppose I need to tell you how reckless you’ve been, Justice?

&#x200B;

**Young:** I didn’t expect things to escalate to this level, sir.

&#x200B;

**Durand:** Clearly.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Look, if you’re gonna give anyone shit, give it to me. I’m the one who pushed her!

&#x200B;

**Durand:** I’m aware… however I’m also aware that you were trying to nip this in the bud quickly. Look, I’m not an unreasonable man, Detective. Protocol only gets you so far. You made a judgment call. It was reckless, but I don’t entirely disagree with it. That’s not the issue at hand here.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Wait… this isn’t like a disciplinary thing?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Fuck… oh fuck… no, no, no…

&#x200B;

**Durand:** No. But as your past reports have indicated, escaping this thing is not necessarily enough. In both prior cases, the witnesses were subsequently hunted and killed, were they not.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** *\[Pause\]* Yes… yes, they were…

&#x200B;

**Durand:** I have no reason to believe that this thing will break that trend for you, especially since you and Justice managed to harm it. Only slightly, yes… but your description of events would suggest to me that you did indeed cause it pain. Something like that, might be inclined to take such a thing personally. Therefore, I’m recommending that the two of you be kept in protective custody for the foreseeable future.

&#x200B;

**Young:** No… no, Milo you can’t do this…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Wait… what can’t he do? Protective custody’s good, right… right?

&#x200B;

**Durand:** I’m sorry, Justice. I’ll have someone escort you two to a safe room, and I promise I’ll do everything I can to try and keep you alive.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Milo, wait! Wait!

&#x200B;

*\[There is movement heard in the recording. Director Durand is noted to have left the room at this point.\]*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Wait… what can’t he do? Justice, what the hell is going on here? Protective custody’s good, right… right?

**Hawthorne:** It’s a Mimic… right? That’s what you said? You guys can kill it, right?

&#x200B;

**Young:** The poison didn’t work, River… you saw it… the poison didn’t work…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** S-so…? Maybe someone else can make a better poison or… you mentioned like, cursed bullets and shit… they’ve got those, right?

&#x200B;

**Young:** I… I don’t know… even if it’s not a Mimic, the poison should’ve hurt it more. Should’ve slowed it down more… I don’t know what’s gonna work on it… I don’t…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** But you guys have *something,* right?

&#x200B;

**Young:** I don’t know… but… but I guess they’re going to find out real soon, huh?

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** What…?

&#x200B;

*\[Pause\]*

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Oh fuck me… no… no, you’re not serious…

&#x200B;

**Young:** He said he’d *try* and keep us alive… key word… try…

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** Justice, please tell me you’re joking.

&#x200B;

**Young:** You said it yourself… this thing went into hiding after Angelo saw it. It’s probably gonna go into hiding again after it deals with us… and that leaves exactly one window of opportunity to kill it before it leaves town again.

&#x200B;

**Hawthorne:** He’s not just… come on… he’s your boss! He’s not just gonna… he’s not gonna use us as bait!

&#x200B;

**Young:** I really don’t know if he has much of a choice right now…
