Before I begin, I want to share… maybe a memory. Or maybe a lesson. Or maybe just something my brain stitched together out of scraps.

When I was a kid, my father—bastard that he was—once told me: “Fear is weakness. And weakness is something people use.”
I’ve interpreted it differently over the years.
But lately… it’s started to mean something else entirely.

My name is Derek. I’m 28. Freelance writer. Diagnosed schizophrenic. I moved into this apartment building a few weeks ago—small place, mostly older tenants, quiet enough. Thought I’d give Reddit a shot. Writing helps sometimes. Reading too.

See, when the voices start crowding in—those whispery little bastards with doubts and insults—it’s like they hush up when I read. They lean in, like kids at a storytime. Each shadow in the corner takes a line. Sometimes I even imagine the neurons in my brain flickering back to life as the narrative flows. That was my first week here. Peaceful. Familiar.

But then things started… shifting.

I’m not saying it’s real. I know what my diagnosis means. But I also know what I saw.

⸻

Monday.
Just got back from the hospital, picking up my meds. I tucked the Walgreens bag inside my jacket—discreet. No one needs to know.

As I was unlocking my door, the one to my left creaked open.

Ms. Grace.

Eighty-something, soft-voiced, melting face. Skin like it was sliding off the bone, but maybe that’s just how I see people sometimes. She gave me that smile—cherry red lips on sagging flesh—and that sweet Southern drawl.

“Oh, there you are, my strong man. Could you help an old lady out?”

I nodded. “Sure, Ms. Grace. What do you need?”

“Just the trash. My hip’s been actin’ up since the surgery. Bless your heart.”

I asked, “What about your grandson? I thought he was staying with you?”

Her smile dropped like a curtain. Her eyes lowered. The whites disappeared into the shadows under her brow.

“He’s not here no more.”

The silence after that felt… suspended, like something waiting to fall.

I nodded again. Like I understood. I didn’t.

Inside her apartment, all the lights were off except the hallway glow behind me. The place stank—like copper, rot, maybe ammonia. Three oversized trash bags sat by the door, leaking something thick and dark.

“Mind the mess,” she said, but the accent was gone. Her voice sounded… wrong.

I tried to breathe through my mouth as I grabbed the first bag. It was heavy. Too heavy. The voices in my head—usually cruel, dismissive—sounded… different. Panicked. Pleading.

“Get out.” “She knows you know.” “We’re exposed.” “You’re helping her.”

I kept my head down. Hauled the bags out. Focused on the task.

When I came back, her drawl had returned, smiling like nothing had changed.

“Thank you, sugar. I’ll be sure to thank you proper… sometime.”

She patted my arm. Her skin felt cold. Damp, almost.

I smiled back. Forced. “Looking forward to it.”

I stepped inside my apartment, shut the door fast. But the feeling didn’t leave. The voices were all screaming now—anger, confusion, fear. I reached into my jacket to take my meds…

The bag was gone.

Shit. Maybe I dropped it? Maybe… I left it in Ms. Grace’s place?

I should’ve gone back. Asked. But when I peeked through the curtain, I could still see her silhouette through hers. Standing there. Motionless.

When I opened the blinds—she was gone.

Her door was closed.

I almost let it go. Almost went to bed.

But then I saw it.
The Walgreens bag. Sitting on her windowsill.
Folded. Upright.
Mocking me.

Tuesday

I didn’t confront Ms. Grace that morning. Even though I needed those pills, something in me said not to bother her. Maybe I could get a refill. Maybe it wasn’t worth it.
Or maybe part of me just didn’t want to find out what I might’ve seen.

I stayed inside. Called Dr. Sharpen—my therapist—and told him about what happened. He listened, calm as ever, and explained it away. Said I was helping an elderly woman with chores, and that my condition may have distorted the details.

I wanted to believe that. I really did.

But even as I sat there, nodding on the phone, I could still feel the weight of those trash bags in my hands. Still smell that coppery, syrupy rot.

Still hear her voice shift.

By afternoon, I decided I’d face her. Just grab the Walgreens bag from her window and be done with it.

I knocked on her door, just once. It creaked open before I could raise my hand again. I told myself that was good—less talking, no need to linger.

I stepped in fast, eyes on the bag still sitting on her windowsill like it had never moved.

Then I heard her voice from behind the door:

“Oh, you’re back. I was just about to ask if you needed that little bag.”

I turned. She was hiding behind the open door, only half her face showing—one wide eye peeking out and a smile that didn’t quite fit.

“Uh… yeah,” I started. “I saw it yesterday… figured I dropped it… and the door was—”

She cut me off, her grin widening—too wide, her features warping like a painting in motion.

“You know it’s rude to enter someone’s home without being properly invited.”

Her tone was sweet. But something in it crawled up my spine.

“I-I’ll keep that in mind, Ms. Grace. Sorry. Didn’t mean to intrude…”

Sweat rolled down my back. My head was buzzing. Was it the lack of meds? Or something else entirely?

“Well… go ahead. Take them.”

I moved slowly to the window, every step feeling watched. I reached for the bag, trying not to look at her, but I could feel her gaze digging into my skin.

We locked eyes as I slipped the bag into my jacket.

“I appreciate you… being calm about this,” I muttered. My voice shook.
“Sorry again.”

Was I scared?

I couldn’t let her see that.

She smiled. But her eyes darkened—no whites, just pooling black, like tunnels looking straight through me.

“It’s okay,” she said softly.
“We all make mistakes, every now and then… Have a good night, Sonny.”

Sonny?

That was her grandson, wasn’t it?

I didn’t ask. I just nodded and backed out, then turned and bolted the second I hit the hallway. My feet ran before my thoughts could.

Back in my apartment, I locked the door behind me and stood there. Frozen.

The voices were louder now.

“She knows you saw.”
“She’s coming.”
“You crossed the line.”

I tore open the bag and popped the pills, desperate for silence.
But the paranoia didn’t fade this time. It didn’t feel like it was in my head.

It felt… around me. Heavy. Present.
Like something had come back with me.

I must’ve blacked out. When I woke, I was on the floor, pills scattered like breadcrumbs, my heart pounding in my ears.

But the voices were gone.

That should’ve been a good sign.
So why did I still feel like I wasn’t alone?

Wednesday: 
Today was… quiet.

After cleaning up the mess from last night and organizing my pills, things felt still again. I even got back into my routine a bit. But I couldn’t shake what happened with Ms. Grace. Her voice. That door. That word—Sonny.

I kept replaying Dr. Sharpen’s voice in my head: “It’s all in your mind, Derek.”

Maybe he’s right.

Hell, maybe my parents were right too. They’ve been telling me for years to get a support animal. I’ve always brushed it off, but now… I don’t know. My brain could use all the help it can get.

So I started doing some research. I wasn’t really expecting a discount or miracle price, but I figured—worst case—I could just adopt a dog from the shelter and train it myself.

That’s what I did.

I walked down to one of the smaller, more overlooked shelters nearby. At first, I had my eye on a basset hound or a bloodhound—something with big ears and soulful eyes. But then I saw her.

She stood out immediately. Massive. Silent. Unbothered. A black Tibetan Mastiff, matted and unkempt, fur like tangled yarn or worn dreadlocks. She looked like a bear in hibernation. Calm, still, timeless.

Something about her felt… familiar. Like me, she didn’t belong to the world around her.

I adopted her on the spot, brought her home, gave her a bath (she barely reacted), and signed her up for those specialized therapy dog classes.

She hasn’t barked once. She just exists—moves only when she wants to. Sleeps a lot. But when she lays by my feet, the chaos dims.

I named her Cleo.

There’s something about her presence… anchoring. For the first time in a long while, I didn’t feel alone in the room. I mean—I’ve always been alone, but there’s a difference between being alone and feeling it.

I come from a big family. Eight of us, and somehow I was always the background noise. The second child. The quiet one. The one who made too much eye contact and too little conversation.

Growing up in a house like that?
Let’s just say dysfunction was the wallpaper.

I used to wonder why I wasn’t close to anyone in my family. But now I realize—every time I reached out, they reminded me why I shouldn’t. The same toxic patterns repeated, like a looped audio file with static in all the wrong places.

And maybe my mind’s not wired like theirs. I don’t see things as they do. I think in parables, symbols, patterns. Not cause and effect.

The point is—I know I’m “crazy.” Maybe lucid at times, maybe not. But that doesn’t mean I deserve to be treated like a patient who’s already failed treatment. Or a prisoner serving time for having a brain that bends a little differently.

Reality doesn’t crack because someone’s weak. It breaks when it’s twisted too many times. When words don’t mean what they used to. When smiles are masks, and no one explains the rules.

My family was like a broken game of telephone.

After a while, I stopped playing. Started talking to myself instead.

But clearly… even that has its consequences.

Anyway. Just rambling.

I’m signing Cleo up for her first session tomorrow. She’s asleep right now, curled up like a rug beside the door. I think she’s already helping.

Maybe tomorrow will be better.

Thursday

After our morning walk and finishing up Cleo’s first specialized training session—not to mention a few errands—we finally headed back to the apartment.

The instructor was kind. Helpful, even. She complimented how well-mannered Cleo was, surprised by how naturally she followed cues.

“It’s like she’s done this before,” she said with a smile and that classic valley-girl accent.
“If she stares at what you’re staring at—it’s real. If she looks at you during an episode—then it’s probably just in your head.”

I nodded. I know I should feel proud… but there was something about how cheerful she sounded that rubbed me the wrong way. I wanted to tell her to calm the hell down, but I just smiled and thanked her instead.

I went ahead and signed Cleo up for two weeks of follow-up sessions—just to get her documented and “official,” I guess. I don’t really care about the paperwork. I just like having her around. Someone who gets me.

Even if that someone has paws.

We hadn’t seen Ms. Grace in two days. Probably for the best. After everything, I needed time to breathe.

But then… the building started feeling off again.

As Cleo and I walked down the hallway toward our place, I realized we were looping. Walking in circles. No door numbers. No signs. Nothing looked familiar anymore.

Had I gone to the wrong floor?

I turned around and headed back to the elevator. Pressed the button—up or down, I wasn’t even sure.
The doors opened and the display read: Floor 9.

That can’t be right. The building only has four floors. I live on the top—4F. I know this. I know this.

Cleo noticed the shift in my mood. She looked at me with that grounding stare like she was waiting for me to recalibrate.

I took a breath and pressed “4.”

The elevator opened again.

Same hallway. But now there were no doors at all. Just a long corridor. Bare white walls. Paint peeling at the corners. No sound but the hum of dead air.

I stood there, frozen. But Cleo wasn’t. She pulled the leash forward, tugging me out of the elevator like she’d made the decision for both of us.

The hallway felt sterile and wrong. Like the back of a corporate office they never finished. Cleo walked with a tired, deliberate pace, like this wasn’t the first time she’d done this. Like she was already sick of my spiral.

“I hope you know what you’re doing…” I muttered to her.

She stopped. Stared at the wall. Then looked back at me. Like she was expecting something.

And then—without a sound—Ms. Grace appeared.

I blinked and she was just… there, standing in front of us like she’d stepped out of the wallpaper.

Even Cleo jolted, her stance shifting into a guarded, alert posture.

“JESUS!” I shouted, nearly swallowing my own heart.

Ms. Grace just stood there, unfazed.
Or worse—amused.

“Do you always use the Lord’s name in that manner?” she said, her tone playful, almost teasing. But something in her posture was wrong. Something leaned too far in.

Cleo planted herself between us, eyes locked on Ms. Grace. Her face was neutral, but her tail stiffened.

Those black, soulless eyes from before were gone. But the energy she gave off still stirred every voice in my head into a quiet scream.

“She knows you saw.”
“She’s hiding something.”
“She’s coming for you.”

“That’s a nice dog,” she said, voice syrupy and slow.
“Is it a boy or girl?”

“S-she—” I began.

“Does she bite?” she interrupted, already reaching toward Cleo.

That’s when Cleo lost it.

She barked, snarled, and lunged with a force I didn’t know she had. If I wasn’t 6’0” and 225 pounds, she might’ve pulled me clean off my feet.

“C-Cleo! DOWN! DOWN GIRL!” I yelled, straining to hold her back.

Ms. Grace recoiled, but her face… didn’t match her voice. Her body flinched, but her expression didn’t show fear. It showed challenge. Like she’d been waiting for this.

“Goodness… get that thing under control,” she snapped. But even then, her words felt rehearsed. Like a line she was reciting out of obligation.

“You know…” she added, turning to go, “You really shouldn’t keep that thing in such a cramped apartment.”

Then she disappeared into her unit. Slammed the door. Hard.

Cleo and I rushed back into ours. I pulled her inside and bolted the lock. She stood there for a long time, guarding the door, tail low, hackles slightly raised.

She’s never acted like that. Not with the trainer, the cashier, the people at the dog park—no one.

Only Ms. Grace.

“She knows you know.”
“She’s coming for you… she always does.”

The voices whispered on loop, like a warning or a countdown.
Cleo wouldn’t leave the door. Just stood there. Still. Watching.

It took forever to convince her to lie down. And when she finally did, it was right next to me. Pressed against my side like a shield.

Am I making her as paranoid as me?

Or…

Is there actually something going on?

I took my meds. Tried to clear my head. Tried to focus.
The voices are quieter now, but not gone.

Writing this helps. A little. Like I’m debating with myself whether these things are real… or just in my head.

Hell, maybe they’re both.

Friday

I couldn’t sleep last night.

I think I woke up every two hours—sometimes gasping, sometimes drenched in sweat, sometimes unsure if I’d ever fallen asleep to begin with. Cleo stayed by me through most of it, her big body curled against my legs like a living anchor. But even she has limits. At some point, she rolled over with a soft grunt and gave me that look—the one that says, “Figure it out, man.”

By the first sign of daylight, I decided I’d had enough lying around. I needed to walk. To clear the static. To piece my head back together with fresh air.

I ignored most of the calls on my phone—junk, family, some unknown number that kept calling around 3 a.m.—but one voicemail stuck out.

“Hello, Derek. I was calling to confirm your appointment tomorrow morning at 12:30. If you’d like to reschedule, that’s fine—just return my call. Otherwise, I’ll see you in my office at 12:30.
And remember… take your medication.”

Dr. Sharpen. Of course.

I forgot about that appointment. And I hadn’t mentioned Cleo to him yet. I wasn’t sure if he’d even approve.
Still… I couldn’t just leave her here alone. Not after yesterday. Not after the elevator. Not after Ms. Grace.

So I figured I’d take her with me. Simple enough.

We left the apartment and headed down the hallway. That same hallway I’ve walked a dozen times now. The same peeling paint. The same faded carpet that smells like mold and copper and old soap.

But today… it felt too calm.

You ever feel that stillness? The kind that settles just before something terrible happens?
That’s what the air felt like in the building today.
Like it was waiting.

I closed my eyes just before we stepped outside. Just to breathe. Reset. Feel that first hit of crisp morning air and shake this crawling sense of pressure.

But when I opened my eyes…

We were back.

Back on the fourth floor.

Standing at the threshold of my apartment.

I froze. Cleo looked up at me. Tilted her head. That grounding stare again, like she was checking me—like I was the one acting strange.

Maybe I pressed the wrong elevator button? Maybe I walked back up out of habit?

I tried again. Pushed the button. Elevator down. Lobby. Deep breath.

Step out.

Back on the fourth floor.

Same place.

Same spot.

Again.

And again.

I must’ve tried it four times. And every single time, we ended up right back where we started—at the threshold of my door. The hall swallowing me like a bad joke on repeat.

Cleo started to sense something. I could tell. She sniffed the doorway, pawed at the edge like something was under it. She whimpered. That sound cut through me. She never whimpers.

And then… she looked up at me.

Which meant—it was in my head.

Right?

That’s what the trainer said: “If she looks at you, it’s internal.”
But this time, her stare didn’t feel like correction. It felt like… comfort.
Reassurance.
Pity?

I closed the door and sat on the floor, dialing Dr. Sharpen’s number.

“Hey… I might have to reschedule our appointment,” I said, trying to keep my voice level. Like I wasn’t unraveling at the seams.

“Okay,” he replied. Too quick. Too neutral.
“Is everything alright?”

“Yeah. Just… can’t seem to get out of bed right now.”

I walked toward the kitchen while Cleo sat in the middle of the room, eyes still locked on the door.

“You know, I could do a home visit,” he offered, calm and precise.
“If that’s easier.”

“No—it’s fine. I’m okay. I just need some rest.”

There was a pause. Long enough for the silence to feel loaded.

“The pills aren’t working, are they?”

The voices began to hum, low at first, like static bleeding through my skull.
Then clearer:

“He knows.”
“They know.”
“She’s coming.”
“Useless.”
“RUN.”

“You said they take a few days to adjust,” I muttered, trying to sound casual. My hands trembled as I gripped the countertop. The world felt uneven.

“Right. That’s true,” he said. But now… his voice felt sharp. Like a scalpel.
“But if things worsen—you’ll come to me. Yes?”

I nodded, even though he couldn’t see me. I tried to answer, but my throat felt dry.

“O-of course,” I finally said.
“I will.”

I hung up.

I could’ve told him everything. Should’ve. But something inside me screamed not to.
Like he was waiting for me to say the wrong thing.
Like he wanted me to confess something I didn’t understand yet.

But what was I going to say?

That I’m trapped inside a four-story apartment building that somehow has a ninth floor?

That I walk out the elevator only to reappear at my own front door?

That my dog may be the only creature in the building who knows I’m not insane?

Yeah.
I’d be institutionalized by morning.

I’m a grown man. I should be able to handle my own mind. My own body.
But every time I reach for the world outside, it swallows me whole and spits me back out in the same goddamn hallway.

Maybe that’s why I’m writing this.

To trace a path.
To figure out what’s real.
To prove I’m not just pacing a cage inside my own skull.

Cleo and I stood at the threshold of the door again, staring at it like it might answer us.
Might tell us what the hell we’re supposed to do.

And the voices—they didn’t whisper anymore.

They sang.

A twisted, looping chorus:

“She’s coming.”
“Hide.”
“She knows.”
“She’s coming.”

They coiled around my mind like vines. A macabre melody that warped my thoughts into grotesque shapes. Like static images glitching across a dying screen.

I felt like a prisoner again. In my body. In this building. In my mind.

Cleo missed her class today. We both did.

And whatever’s happening—it doesn’t want me to leave.

Or maybe it’s me that doesn’t want to.

I don’t even know anymore.

I’m going to take my meds and try to sleep.

Try.

Sunday

I know I’m not crazy.
I know I’m not.

I couldn’t sleep at all this weekend.
Every time I closed my eyes, it felt like something just outside my awareness was whispering, crawling, waiting. Not a sound I could hear—more like a pressure behind my teeth. A thought that wasn’t mine.

I started drawing a map.
Cleo has been helping me—she’d guide—

—[CUT]

Sorry. I’m getting ahead of myself.

Let me back up.

You probably noticed I skipped Saturday. That was on purpose.
And I have a completely rational explanation for it:

I don’t remember it.

Not in the way people forget their keys or what they had for lunch. I mean nothing. Just a black hole where 24 hours used to be. And I know what you’re thinking. Schizophrenia. Dissociation. Hallucination. Sleep deprivation.

Sure. Fair.

But I have proof.

I’ve been keeping a notebook. Every hour. Writing what I see. What I hear. Even how many times Cleo blinks. And when I flipped back through my entries… Saturday is blank. Not skipped. Not torn out. Just… never written.

Like the day wrote itself and then deleted me from it.

Anyway.

It’s Sunday now. And whatever this building is—it doesn’t want me to leave.
I’ve tried. Dozens of times.

Elevators don’t work.
Stairs all lead to Floor 4.
Even the fire escape drops me at my own goddamn door like it’s some kind of cosmic joke.

So Cleo and I figured—okay, fine. If we can’t go down, let’s go up.

There’s always a roof, right?

Wrong.

The top floor isn’t a rooftop. It’s… a courtyard. Walled in with rusted iron fences and broken concrete planters. No sky. No sound. Just an empty pit pretending to be open air.

And it gets worse.

Every five floors, there’s another courtyard. Same design, but older. More decayed. More… off.
As if the building keeps building on itself, but forgetting how it’s supposed to look.

The air changes, too.
At first, it was just cold. Then metallic. Then thick. Heavy. Like breathing through wet cloth soaked in vinegar and old pennies.

I tried the basement. Locked.
You need the janitor’s key, and I haven’t seen that man in over a week. If he even exists.

Cleo started growling at the stairwells. Refuses to go near them now. Like she knows they lead nowhere.

I guess what I’m saying is…

We’re trapped.

So now I’m mapping it. Floor by floor. Stair by stair. Hallway by hallway.
Cleo stays close. She looks at me like I dragged her into hell—and maybe I did. But she’s still here. Still following.

I used to think it was just Ms. Grace.
That she was the root. The ghost. The parasite.
But this place… this thing… it breathes.

And now it knows that I know.

It’s like… some unseen eye finally blinked and noticed I was paying attention.

Is this a test?

A breakdown?

Or have I finally caught up to reality?

Either way—I’ve come full circle. I want to be back in my apartment. At least there, the madness was quieter. Contained.

But now even that space feels smaller.

It’s like the further I travel into this building, the more it shrinks behind me. Like the walls contract every time I leave, trying to keep me from ever going back. Trying to force me forward.

Cleo sees it too. I know she does. She’s not looking at me anymore—she’s looking with me. At the walls. At the shadows. At things I only catch from the corner of my vision.

But then again…

I am the one with the condition.

So maybe I’m just projecting.
Or maybe she’s part of this too.
Hell, maybe she’s my mind trying to stabilize itself. A hallucination of a hallucination.

I don’t know.

After that last phone call with Dr. Sharpen… I shut down completely.

Turned my phone to airplane mode.
Closed my laptop.
No TV. No internet. No people.
Just me. And Cleo. And this prison.

But I need to document this.
Need to write it down while I still remember the shape of my thoughts.
Because something is happening.
Something is building.

If I disappear again—I want someone to know it wasn’t because I gave up.
It’s because this place took me.

So I packed.
Chargers. Flashlight. Snacks. Batteries.
Journal. Extra pens. Water.

Cleo stood by the door while I loaded up my backpack like I was prepping for some backwoods hiking trip.
She stared at the threshold—no fear now. Just… readiness.

Maybe I’m ridiculous.
Maybe I’ll spend the next 12 hours wandering hallways and end up right back in my bathtub muttering into a shampoo bottle.

But if this is all in my head—then fine.

Let me be the lunatic in tactical gear wandering his own hallucination.
At least I’ll know I tried.

But if it’s not…

Then I need to find whatever this is.

Whatever is watching me.

Cleo knew it too.
She nudged the door.
One slow breath.

We stepped through together.
