This happened during my third year of pharmacy training. As part of my internship, I was assigned night shifts in the emergency ward. Honestly, I was excited in the beginning. My chief pharmacist told me night duty is where you really learn. IV injections, emergency protocols, everything. And he was right.

But no one tells you how exhausting it really is. Staying up all night in a hospital, watching trauma roll in nonstop, messes with your body and your head. I held on during the first week. Forced myself to stay awake. We were always warned that if a patient's family saw you sleeping, or someone from the media came in, or any senior staff noticed, you'd be in serious trouble.

But after a few weeks, the exhaustion got unbearable. One night, when things were calm and the ward wasn’t too crowded, I decided to take a quick nap. Just for a while.

I sneaked up to the second floor, to the OPD area. The Eye OPD room was always empty at night and it had air conditioning. Two manual iron beds sat there untouched.

I brought my bedsheet, took off my shoes, used my bag as a pillow, and locked the door from the inside. I felt safe. The room was cold, silent, and dim. I checked my phone. It was one in the morning. I set an alarm for three thirty. Just a short nap before shift change.

I lay down and scrolled through some reels, laughing quietly in the dark. After a while, my eyes got heavy. I don't remember exactly when I drifted off.

But what happened next didn’t feel like sleep.

I opened my eyes and I couldn’t move.

My body was frozen. My arms, legs, even my mouth. I was awake, aware, but completely paralyzed. My heart started racing. Then I heard it.

Sounds. Inside the room.

Not from the hallway. From inside with me.

I heard footsteps, soft and slow, like someone barefoot on the cold floor. Breathing too. Not mine. And then whispers. Right near my ear. I couldn’t understand them, but they were close, too close.

I wanted to scream. I tried. Nothing came out. My chest felt heavy, like something was sitting on it.

And the whole time, I was thinking, I locked the door. No one should be in here.

But I didn’t feel alone. I felt watched. Trapped. Like something was standing in the corner, waiting for me to see it.

Then my alarm rang.

Just like that, I could move again. The sounds stopped. I jumped out of bed, sweating, heart pounding.

I didn’t even bother picking anything up.

I left everything behind. My shoes, bag, sheet. I ran downstairs to the emergency floor in just my socks. I didn’t care who saw me.

I never went back to that room. Never took another night shift again.

I told the staff I was feeling sick, but the truth is, I was terrified. I still am. Sometimes, when I try to sleep, I remember that room. The bed. The locked door.

And the feeling that I was never really alone in there.
