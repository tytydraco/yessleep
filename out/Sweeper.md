I work at a gas station, underpaid and overworked like any sales associate. I’ve worked in retail most of my adult life, caught in between whether I look legal or to be taken seriously. It was both a curse and gift wrapped in one. I know how rude and unruly customers can be, there are the  most unreasonable, and there is the absolutely bat shit crazy ones. But as one who works in retail, you have to be neutral and have a backbone to go along with it. My name is Arlen Macky, and I hate retail, but  a job is a job. 

I got stories that could scare your pants off or just sound plain weird. I’d worked mostly in shopping centers, although there was at most weird things that happened there. It doesn’t compare working at a gas station, I had quit my previous job because my boss, Dennis, was harassing me, his style was to make you want to quit so he didn’t have to fire you. I decided to quit, took a break, and was able to finally get another job. 

I ended up being hired to work at a little gas station off the highway, not as spooky as one would say it was, although it was near the mountains, during the daylight hours looked absolutely peaceful and serene. At night, not so much. You can hear creatures that don’t sound realistic howling or screaming, babies crying out from the darkness, and at the edge of your peripheral vision you think you saw something like a shadow dart pass the gas pumps into the bushes, that looked vaguely human but also like an animal at the same time. 

Because I was a recent hire, my boss Mary,  had no choice to terminate one of the overnight employees, David was a quiet Hispanic who minded his own business. But, one day he stopped showing up, he blocked everyone and ghosted everyone. Now a rumor during the day crew spread like wildfire, a joke, they all tell each other that a ghost scared him, or something to that effect. Being pulled into Mary’s office, while she was making the new schedule, I had an inkling of what she wanted to ask me. 

She wanted me to replace David at night. I could tell by the way she shuffled the schedule in front of her, hesitating just long enough for me to feel the weight of the ask. The overnight shift, with all its eerie noises and unsettling stories, was suddenly becoming my reality, not just another rumor whispered among the day crew.

My heart sank a little when she finally slid the paper toward me, her eyes searching mine for signs of protest. I tried to keep my face neutral, not wanting to show any hint of fear or reluctance. After all, I needed the job, regardless of the shift. Still, I couldn’t help but wonder what exactly had happened to David—and whether those stories about the night shift were just jokes, or warnings I should have taken seriously.

I agreed to take the overnight shift, figuring the extra pay was worth putting up with a few scary tales and weird noises. The rumors swirling around didn’t seem real enough to scare me off, at least not yet. I told myself the money was what mattered, and besides, someone had to cover those hours.

The first night was all it took to make me want to quit my job, but I stayed out of obligation. The moment the sun dipped behind the mountains and the gas station was swallowed by darkness; every unsettling story seemed to come alive around me. Shadows lurked just beyond the edge of the fluorescent lights, and every distant howl made my nerves jump, but I kept telling myself I had a responsibility—to the job, to Mary, and maybe to prove to myself I could handle it.

Before the swing shift had left, one of my coworkers Scott had informed me that there was a homeless guy who liked to sweep the parking lot. Scott said the guy wasn’t dangerous, but he was unpredictable—always silent, and he always showed up just as the swing shift ended, broom in hand. They called him “Sweeper,” and nobody really knew his story. Some folks thought he was just looking for a few coins or maybe a little company, but others swore he’d been around for years, showing up at odd hours and moving through the shadows as if he belonged to the night itself.

I had laughed at him thinking it was a joke. During the daylight, there were a lot of homeless people that came by going through garbage, and panhandling money from customers. But a guy who came and swept the parking lot seemed a bit ridiculous. 

That night, true to Scott’s words, I saw him. He appeared almost out of nowhere, gliding silently from the shadows at the edge of the lot, his old broom dragging behind him. He didn’t make eye contact or acknowledge my presence, just started sweeping in slow, deliberate circles under the dim yellow lights. There was something almost ritualistic about it—like he was cleaning away more than just dust and leaves, as if he was trying to keep something at bay.

I stayed inside the store, pacing up and down the aisles as the night wore on. The shelves, illuminated by harsh fluorescent lights, were lined with all sorts of sugary junk food—tempting in their own way. There were half a dozen packs of white powdered doughnuts, each more hazardous to my health than a glitter bomb, their sweetness almost daring me to take one. Stacks of honey buns sat nearby, looking deflated and forlorn, with no expiration date in sight—almost as if they’d been forgotten by time.

From the back of the store, the grill creaked, and the rotating tornado snacks swirled alongside hot dogs that looked more than a little questionable. Despite the unsettling atmosphere and my nerves on edge, I focused on my duties: stocking the shelves and taking inventory. The familiar tasks provided a small sense of normalcy, grounding me amidst the night’s uncertainty.

Every so often, I’d catch a glimpse of Sweeper through the window, his silhouette moving steadily across the lot. The rhythmic scrape of his broom seemed to blend with the night sounds, never quite loud enough to be comforting, but impossible to ignore. I found myself watching him between tasks, my curiosity growing with every loop he made around the cracked pavement. Was he really just a harmless drifter with a peculiar habit, or was there something more to his nightly ritual? 

Nothing out of the ordinary happened for the first week, seeing the Sweeper appearing out of thin air like some magician was truly a sight to behold. It was one Tuesday night, it was pouring outside, the rain was treacherous. 
I watched from the safety of the store, the windows fogging up as the storm battered the glass. Outside, the parking lot was awash with shimmering puddles and streaks of reflected neon, yet Sweeper was undeterred, moving through the rain with the same slow, methodical motion. His coat hung from his shoulders like a soggy tarp, but he kept sweeping, unfazed by the downpour, as if the weather was nothing but a minor inconvenience in his nightly routine.

I watched Sweeper, drenched and steadfast in the downpour, his hood pulled up as always, obscuring his face from view. Despite never seeing his features, I felt a pang of sympathy for him—there was something unsettling about witnessing someone endure the rain in silence, swept up in his nightly ritual. The thought of leaving him out there, cold and soaked, weighed on me. Unable to just stand by, I decided to do something about it.

I walked over to the coffee machine and brewed a fresh cup, the warmth and aroma offering a small comfort against the chill outside. Wanting to make sure he had options, I grabbed a generous handful of creamers and stuffed them into my pocket. As I approached the front door, the cup in hand, I hesitated, my fingers resting on the handle, ready to push it open. Yet, something made me stop—whether it was the memory of Mary’s rules or the uncertainty about how Sweeper might react, I found myself standing at the threshold, torn between concern and caution.

Mary did give me a list of rules while working overnight, and one of them was never to leave the store unattended. I could hear her voice in my head, reminding me not to take unnecessary risks no matter how small they seemed. So I hesitated, torn between wanting to help Sweeper and following protocol like I’d promised.

I glanced back at the counter, the store empty except for the low hum of the coolers and the flicker of the security monitors. The storm outside rattled the windows, making me second-guess my decision. My fingers tightened around the steaming cup of coffee, feeling the heat seep into my palms as a small comfort against the chill of my anxiety. For a moment, I wondered if Sweeper even wanted help—or if breaking the rules for his sake would only make things worse.

Instead, I opened the door, and I yelled across the parking lot through the storm, the rain already starting to soak the front of my shirt. “Hey! Do you want something warm to drink?!” I shouted. 

Sweeper stopped when he looked up at me, I still can’t see his face, the hood casting a deep shadow over his features. For a moment, he stood motionless, rainwater streaming off his coat and pooling around his boots. The only sign that he’d noticed me was a slight tilt of his head, as if he was weighing whether to respond or just keep moving. The air hung heavily between us, filled with the sound of rain and the distant hum of the highway.

As if it was pure nightmare material, he melted into the gravel, all that remained was the coat on the ground and the broom. The sight sent a chill down my spine, the rain seeming to hush around the empty space where he’d stood just moments before. I stared, stunned.

My breath caught in my throat as I took a hesitant step forward, the cup of coffee trembling in my hand. The parking lot felt suddenly vast and unfamiliar, every shadow stretching longer than it should. I blinked, half-expecting Sweeper to reappear, to materialize out of the downpour like he always had before, but the space remained stubbornly empty. The broom and sodden coat lay abandoned, silent testimony to his presence—or his absence. I couldn’t decide if I should venture out to investigate or retreat inside and lock the doors, but the uncertainty rooted me in place, heart pounding, mind racing with questions that had no easy answers.

That’s when I heard a squeaking sound, looking down, I saw one singular mouse scurrying from the gutter towards me, it was half the size of my hand. The little creature paused just outside the circle of light cast by the store’s entrance, its tiny body shivering as droplets clung to its fur. For a moment, it seemed to look up at me with something like desperate curiosity, as if hoping for shelter or perhaps simply drawn by the warmth still radiating from the coffee in my hand. The absurdity of the situation struck me—I was standing between worlds, not sure whether to fear the supernatural or to care for something so ordinary, so harmless. I knelt down, setting the coffee by my feet, and I set a pile of creamers I shoved in my pocket next to the coffee. 

I quickly shut the door and went back inside; I felt that unfamiliar creeping feeling as if I was being watched. I tried to act normal, but when I sneakily glanced over my shoulder, I was rooted to the floor. I felt my heart sank, my fingers felt numb, a scream was stuck in my tight throat. My eyes were wide like a deer’s; I was sure of it. The lightning crackled across the sky like veins, and I felt like I was in a horror movie. 

Sweeper stood just outside, clutching the cup of coffee I’d set down. My breath caught as he turned toward me—and for the first time, his hood slipped back, revealing not a face, but a shifting mass of tiny, glistening eyes and twitching whiskers. His features weren't human at all; beneath the soaked layers of his coat, hundreds, maybe thousands of mice pressed together, moving in synchronized patterns that mimicked the shape of a man. It was as if the coat itself was animated by their restless bodies, swirling and reforming with every subtle movement.

For one horrifying heartbeat, I couldn’t move, mesmerized and repulsed by the impossible sight. The rain distorted his outline, making it seem as if the mice were shifting in and out of the shadows, their beady eyes reflecting the harsh glare of the parking lot lights. It dawned on me then—Sweeper hadn’t just vanished. He had always been something beyond explanation, a secret hidden in plain sight amidst the ordinary rhythms of my nightly shift.

Sweeper, composed of thousands of mice beneath a trench coat, lifted the steaming cup of coffee in the pouring rain. Despite the uncanny nature of his form, the gesture was unmistakably human—a single hand, constructed from the shifting bodies of countless mice, raised the cup toward me in a silent, eerie acknowledgment. It was as if Sweeper wanted to thank me, his movement deliberate and oddly gentle amid the chaos of the storm. The image lingered: the cup held aloft in the drizzle, a moment of gratitude shared between worlds, unsettling and oddly touching at the same time.

Time seemed to slow as I tried to process what I was seeing, the storm fading into a dull roar behind the glass. My thoughts scrambled for logic, for anything to make sense of this living nightmare, but nothing in Mary’s rules prepared me for a moment like this. I realized, with a cold certainty, that sometimes the danger wasn’t from leaving the store unattended, but from what might find its way to the door no matter how tightly you followed the rules.

And Sweeper turned its back to me and slowly made its way back to the broom it had left by the pumps and picked it up and continued to sweep as if it was the basic and normal Tuesday night. 

I watched, transfixed, as water dripped from the brim of his hood and pattered quietly against the asphalt. The surreal stillness was broken only by the gentle swish of the broom, an oddly comforting sound made uncanny by the impossible truth I’d just witnessed. My mind raced to piece together fragments of supernatural folklore and mundane reality, searching for a foothold in the bizarre intersection where I now stood. Part of me wanted to shout, to demand an explanation from the shifting, rodent-formed figure, but I remained silent—afraid that to acknowledge it aloud would make the moment irrevocably real.

For the rest of the night, I didn’t look out the window, afraid if I did, Sweeper would be right there by the windows watching me. Even as I tried to focus on my work, every scrape of the mop against linoleum or distant hum of the cooler seemed amplified, as if the entire store was holding its breath along with me. My nerves buzzed with the memory of those countless eyes, and each time headlights flickered in the lot, I tensed instinctively, expecting to see that impossible silhouette lurking just beyond the glass. 

It was hard not to imagine the mice, hundreds of them, slipping through unseen cracks, always watching, always waiting. Only the steady tick of the clock and the warm cup between my palms tethered me to reality, a fragile barrier against the surreal encounter that had forever changed the way I saw the world outside my store’s fluorescent glow.

When morning finally came, and Mary pulled into the parking lot, I grabbed my stuff and clocked out. When she asked if anything happened during the night, I stayed silent because I knew no one would believe me about Sweeper. The truth was too strange, too unsettling to share, and even as I considered speaking up, the words caught in my throat. Instead, I simply shook my head and forced a smile, letting the secret settle quietly between us like the lingering chill of the rain-soaked morning.

I thought about it, even if no one believed me, I know what I saw. It wasn’t because I was sleep deprived, it wasn’t because of the storm. Those writhing thousand mice in that trench coat were real, their beady eyes staring right into my soul, their whispers twitching every few seconds. As I headed for the bus stop, I stopped at the edge of the parking lot and glanced at the now empty puddled parking lot. 

For a moment, I lingered in the gray dawn, haunted by the imprint of Sweeper’s form burning into my memory. The puddles glistened beneath the early sunlight, but the air still held the eerie hush of the night before. Even as I stepped onto the bus, I felt the weight of invisible eyes following me, a strange mix of fear and wonder twisting inside my chest. Nothing seemed out of place anymore, yet I knew the world could never feel ordinary again, not after what I’d witnessed.
