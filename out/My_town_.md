The streets roar with the busy sounds of a large crowd. Snippets of everyday conversations float in the air like a passing breeze. Friends chatting about old gossip, couples talking through dinner plans, children playing make believe under parents watchful eyes. Today is an important day. Today is the first day of the harvest. Today is the day the markets roll into our humble town. 

Being the small community this town is, a market is exciting. New goods, new people! People come from all over. A whole new range of foods and fabrics and leathers to choose from is kind of a huge deal if the only goods produced here are crops, and occasionally flowers and mushrooms. Whatever we can harvest here. My mom and I are gatherers here, but the rest of my family are hunters. The whole town works to support each other, It's how we are here. 

People from all over come to our little town just to shop at these markets. I love being able to see all of the new faces. Perhaps some of them will stay this time. We always have space for them in here.

Lines of stalls reach down the streets. It's getting busy. I should start to shop, but somewhere quieter. The smell of fresh meats wafts out from the butcher shop, Mr. Harlow must have already gotten his done. I remember going to the butcher every sunday to buy snacks, finger food is my favorite, and talk to the butcher and his wife. She passed last year, brain disease took her. Mr. Harlow lost her and the baby.

With a sigh I turn to head down a narrow alley. I've spent a lot of time in this specific one. It's convenient, the butcher on one side, the gardener on the other. The gardener grows a majority of our harvest, she has the best fertilizer. I would spend time chasing friends around, then as I grew older I used to have my own stall here. Not anymore. Some little shop sat where mine used to. 

A green-blue shine illuminates the stone walls. Little boxes arranged in messy piles were the source of this strange shine. I paused in my steps. No vendor watched over the stall. Snooping couldn't hurt, right? No one goes down this way unprompted anyway. 

The little boxes are cold to the touch. The gap between the lid shines brighter as I open it, I have to close my eyes. The box creaks open and so do my eyes.  A small... screen? A little blue screen sits in the box. A still image of the front of the flower shop sits, glitchy in a spazzy sort of way. Mindlessly I move my hand towards it, my index finger meets the screen and it's cold like water. The picture moves.

It changes to a different picture, the gardener in her shop next to her fertilizer bags. It changes again. I gasp. A body lay stretched out on the screen, twisted morbidly into a pile of decomposing foods. A fertilizer bin. She has many, all in her basement. 

The cube falls from my hands, back into the pile. I grabbed another. This one shows the hunters out in the woods. It plays out the same way as the other. Chasing down fancy dressed town folk. Oh god. 

I can't help myself as I grasp at another cube. This one shows the butchers shop. The butcher and his wife stand out by the front. in the next scene they sit down for dinner together. Mrs. Harlow isn't pregnant yet, still thin and alive. The shiny silver platter decorates the middle of the table like it always had. The checkered table cloth was wrinkled and torn. Like it always had been. Mrs. Harlow pulls up the platter top in the image. A head, a real human head. Oh no.

Something needs to be done soon. My hand reaches into my back pocket, fingers grasping along a tall rectangular shape. I swipe at it with the urgency only fear can install. There's a click, then a woosh as the stand catches fire. Nobody needs to see this. If this got out it would drive all the tourists away. Without them how would we get fresh food, or cloth, or leather? We need to harvest somehow. The fire should attract a few wanders and I'm sure Mr. Harlow and the gardener can take care of it.
