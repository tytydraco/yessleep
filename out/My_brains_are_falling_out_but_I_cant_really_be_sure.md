My brains are falling out. At least I think they are, though it seems more or less impossible to really find out for sure.

How could that be? I know you're asking this. I've asked myself this a thousand times. I ask myself this every time I have that same old fist-fight with myself again about getting it together, locking in, stopping the noise, finding my peace, going to the doctor, self-care, or maybe just not being *so fucking lazy and delusional and* —

No. It's impossible. I've checked. I've checked a thousand times.

My brains are falling out but there isn't any way to know if that's true.

You might ask follow-up questions. Why don't you go to the doctor? Why don't you talk to a therapist? They've these wonderful brain scans nowadays, and drugs, and all sorts of surgeries too, and if that doesn't work I know a guy who knows a guy who sells magic mushrooms online and will get you in cheap if you like the same Bill Maher brainrot he does. Plus, if your brain is *really* falling out — and I mean really, *really* falling out, undeniably falling out, and you're not just having delusions or something — wouldn't anyone be able to see it and tell you? Wouldn't you likely be dead by now and not slapping up a computer keyboard like nothing's wrong at all? This is just a protracted metaphor for mental health or something, isn't it? Sooo original. Don't forget to call me when they put you on Oprah for being the only person clever enough to come up with something this creative. Well, man, shut the fuck up and maybe listen, because it's more than that. I might be fucked up in other ways but this is more than that.

Am I being uncharitable to you, dear Reader? I've been told I'm uncharitable quite a lot lately, plus a host of other expletives I don't think can go on kids' TV. Last week I got called the slur of a race I'm not even part of, though I think that might've just been an old asshole with bad eyesight.

You should forgive me. It's hard to be charitable when you keep wiping little brain chunks off your sleeve.

Let's try to start somewhere. Anywhere is fine. My brain doesn't work so well anymore after something took a big bite out of it and then left a dookie in the cavity, so you'll have to forgive me for self-starting like a broken car. My great-aunt had schizophrenia her whole life and nobody ever did anything about it, at least until she ran off into the woods one night and nobody *could* do anything after that. My family lived there in that town for another generation, or at least my mother's side did. My parents actually met at Columbia in the 80s, where my father was a well-to-do New York native and had no part in that strange story whatsoever. He had his own problems, though. What was I trying to say? You'll have to forgive me, my brain doesn't work so well anymore after something took a big bite out of it.

What I was trying to say was 

So, okay. I was just making breakfast one day when something definitely bit me. There was no mistaking the sensation. Long, jagged teeth braced the crown of my head for a moment, almost gingerly, like a golden retriever, and then they sliced far down into my head and stayed there for what felt like forever. They were sharp, so sharp and so surgical you could hardly feel it unless you listened — looked? felt? — very closely and didn't likelook the hum of anything else in the room distract you. It's very easy to get distracted. But you have to 

And that was that. I had been marked forever. I felt the back of my head, that tender little spot I always worried was going premature bald but everyone told me I was crazy about. There's a story about a Greek tragedian named Aeschylus I should tell you, though I don't know why. He was very bald, and a very old Greek man, and this made him very en ticng for birds And one day,     for some reason one just went pop! And dropped a turtle on his shiny little bald head because it looked so much like a rock from up above. And then he died. And that's why I had been marked forever, since the Aesthy lus incieent made me very prone to birds dropping birds on me or biting the crown of my head while I wasn't looking and *smick-smacking* my brains out with a long, protruding straw-tongue like some kind of insect animal that I suppose made the bird more of a fly-bird, or bird-fly, or what have you.

I was living with my parents, then. Not in a sad way. It was just a summer visit before I went back to grad school. Well, I guess unless you consider grad school sad, which I suppose it is.

I was living with my parents. And I freaked out, because *obviously*, and screamed bloody murder since my scalp had been sliced clean and my brain chewed off and I begged my father and my mother with tears in my eyes to come look and take me to the hospital and *catch the bastard* before I died out on the kitchen tile, at least if they could. They *are* getting old and infirm, so I'd understand if it was out of the question. Just wanted to check in! Let's circle back to this on Monday. Kindest regards, your Son. Xx.

My father laughed. My mother looked annoyed. There was no hole in the back of my head, or anything even remotely close. Just to calm me down, and I guess because they really loved me after all, my mother even gently felt all around my scalp and cupped my head with her cool, slender fingers and reassured me that there was nothing there, not even a bump. You couldn't even chalk this up to a particularly vengeful mosquito. There was simply nothing there.

But there was. I could feel it. Have you ever been in so much pain that you swore you could see red in your peripheral vision like a first-person video game character right before they die? My head felt hot, white hot, searing really, and I fought very hard to hold back tears because I knew how silly I looked in this moment and then slunk back downstairs to my childhood basement-lair with its suburban finished-basement laminate floors and the crooked Call of Duty 3 poster I hated now and applied pressure to the back of my head, like a bad imitation of a very good paramedic. Blood was trickling from the top of my head into my ear. It was warm and cold all at once, slowly reaching thermodynamic equilibrium with the air outside my body before seeping right back in.

I removed my hand from the wound, which was of course conveniently located in the biggest human blind spot. It was bright red and wet with gore. I saw little blood clots running like slugs down my wrists and fought the urge to throw up, reminding myself that heaving from the trunk of my body would only make the pain at the top of my body worse. I should really go to the hospital. I'm

Don't I have work to do? Don't I have a family to feed? Wait, no. Not really on the second thing, but definitely yes to the first.

I'm stumbling to my laptop. I need to do the readings. My qualifying exam is in January, and that's very important or else I guess I'll die or something. No. I can't be cavalier about that kind of thing. I'm just kidding. If there's any gods up there listening, I'm just kidding! Knock on wood. Knock on wood. Knock on wood again. I'm kidding. I really, really am. I'll work hard, I promise. No. I shouldn't promise. It's not good to swear oaths and get the gods mad, is it? I need to pass my qualifying exam if it kills me.

So I hold my head with one hand and open up the next reading with the other. Except I don't do that. I'm too busy bleeding out of my head and crying, and throwing up, and crying, and bleeding out of my head some more, except that I'm NOT because there's NO BLOOD except that there IS and I need to go to the hospital but I don't.

At dinner, my mother asks how my studies are going. I force a polite laugh and say something noncommital. She tells me she thinks I'll be fine. I remind her I'm going home to live in her basement forever if I don't pass it, and at this point I'm really not sure that I will. I feel sick. I need to work. I just need my laptop right now. My father tells me I look gaunt. What's there to worry about? You're making good progress every day, right? You haven't just been hiding down there pretending to work and lying to us while you waste your whole day doing nothing, right?

I love my job. I don't know what's wrong with me. I glance at my phone as a distraction from this very uncomfortable conversation that is very uncomfortable and making me feel a little bit attacked right now.

I blow chunks all over the table.

It's August.

Well, just early August. You still have some days left. Except you don't, because you blink again and it's no longer early August.

Wait, is it June? Holy shit, has a whole year passed?

No. You sigh. Or, well, I sigh. No. It's only a trick of my imagination. The date is August 4th, which means

I somehow spent a whole month down there clutching my head and bleeding out with my brain all over everything leaking and getting eaten and crunched and god knows what else. It was July 4th the last time I checked. Was there some kind of holiday I missed? But I can't do holidays. I have a qualifying exam to pass. I'm reeling again, but I can't say anything else. I merely force a quick smile at my parents and get up to leave. They don't say anything, or even mind that much, because I hadn't thrown up on the table after all except that I *had* but that was yesterday, even though I don't think I remember yesterday.

As I get up to leave, a slice of brain oozes out of the back of my head and plops onto the floor. It looks a lot like the placenta of some kind of ruminant animal, like a scene from an old thinly-veiled red-blooded propaganda school DVD about humble life on the farm right after a baby calf is born. Miracle of life, isn't it? The average farmer Joe is doing very well this year. He has beers for cheep because of the Prime Minister or something. Or whatever we have. Jesus fuck.

So there's my blood on the flmy brain on the floor. Or at least a little slice of it.

I have a paper to write. Two of them, actually. I've a seminar paper I haven't started yet even though it was given months ago and a paper I need to write out of an abstract I talked up way too much for a conference in October. I haven't started either of them. Because I need to pass my qualifying exam. But haven't I just spent a month not working on my qualifying exam?

This is an odd reaction to have to my brains being blown out on the table. Or chair. Or — fuck — what's that thing called/ The flor. The floor. That;s it. The floor.

I throw up again, for real this time, and wake up in my bed with tucked in a cold towel on my head like a child. The icy water drips into the cavity in my skull. I slough the thing off. It's bright red and pink, presumably like what the back of my head looks like. I look at my pillowcase. It's somehow perfectly pristine. I wring the thing out into the bowl of water beside me, but all of it clatters to the floor instead. There was no bowl. I guess besides the bowl in my head, which I should really go get looked at.

I'll look at it after my qualifyinge exam. But it doesn't stop me from telling my dad I'm too sick to go to the gym with him tomorrow. I need that extra three hours to write, and maybe work on my qualifying exam again.

I close my eyes and wake up. It's September, because of course it is. I'm in my own bed, across the continent from the other one.

Without my parents here, I feel so much more inadequate and alone.

I think about those baby monkeys in the documentaries. The ones who let go from their mothers after a vigorous chase by chimpanzees and get picked up in one hand like little sandwiches by these guys that look like tail-less, roided up versions of them and then *crack!* The chimp bites into the back of their head, and then that monkey's toast. The mother monkey makes a sad little wail but can't look back without becoming chimp-food herself. We get a close-up shot of the chimp smacking his lips, face covered in fresh pink brains.

I get up out of bed and a long tube of brain matter, not *not* resembling a soft log of shit, slides out of the bore-hole in my head. The skull has healed a little, but left a gap for the brains to come out. It sits unceremoniously on my pillow like a present from a cat.

I get up and go to my laptop. My stomach churns.

I end up going to the doctor after that. None of them can find anything wrong with me. Male, 5'6, 22 Years Old. Below average in the height department but that's not exactly a medical emergency. I'm in perfect health. The nurse compliments my biceps. Something about the word biceps reminds me of giraffe. I think it would be very odd at all if there were giraffes on my arms. There's no hole in the side of my head at all, and the doctor tells me this seriously while he's playing with a chunk of my brains he just pulled out from that same cavity he says doesn't exist. But fuck me, right? I'm not a brain scientist or a rocket surgeon. Maybe that's just his comfort brain-slice and I'm being insensitive to his stim toys. That's a bit rude. I'm sorry.

He refers me to a psychiatrist, who obviously also tells me there's no hole in my head. She asks me a lot of very invasive questions about my mental state and then asks if I've ever been on any medication for psychiatric disorders. I tell her no. I'm ADHD, teenage diagnosed, but I never sought medicine for it because I thought I worked fine. I mean, fine people go to grad school, right?

She tenderly suggests we try an anxiety medication. It's a gentle kind, she says, won't hurt too bad. Not too many side effects versus the other ones.

I go home and pick up my new pill bottle the next day. It doesn't do anything, at least not that I can feel, but it's not supposed to for two more weeks.

It takes me a million years to turn in even one of my outstanding papers. And I mean that in the no-fun, academic way. Outstanding = bad. It means it should've been done months ago but wasn't. I'm in tears in my supervisor's office and she tells me she's not mad, just worried about my health, but I can tell she's mad from the way she's staring daggers at me. Maybe I won't have to confront her after all, once I fail my qualifying exam for good and have no choice but to pack my bags and restart my life as a candle salesman, or a professional clown. She offers me a fruit from her garden and I take it to look nice. Tears mix with the fruit juice when I bite down. I feel teeth gnawing on the back of my head and it takes all of my effort not to scream again and crawl away on my stomach and get carted off to rehab for something I'm not even on.

I open my eyes. Terror and fear and anguish wells up in my stomach. It's that paper again, and it's two weeks earlier. I haven't started. I'll have to write it all over again.

My brain is throbbing and I realize it's soaked through my shirt. Clear cranial fluid and grey brain matter dribble down like little slugs between globs of some kind of pink water. I look like those images online of very fat men sweating. I make a virtual appointment to see my psychiatrist again, then pass out.

It's midnight. I need to work. I really, really, really really really really really really really really really need to work. What if I fail my qualifying exam? What then? I can't be put out on the street. I've wanted this my whole life. I wipe the tears from my eyes and blow out the snot from my nose, which of course is just more leaking brains that run bright pink on my hand and then grow brittle and hard in my arm hairs. Shouldn't I be dead right now? My head feels like cotton candy, but warmer. It feels like soup. Have you ever felt like a cauldron, gently stirred beneath some kind of massive fire?

That's my first all-nighter. I barely make progress, but it's progress I force myself to feel proud about.

I go to class the next day and sit next to my friend from CompLit. We're chill. He likes to skateboard and go on long runs and he and hsis boyfriend and training for a marathon.

"Matt." No response.

"Matt." I get hushed.

We're out of class now and he's finally responding to me. "Hey man, can I ask you something kind of weird? Please don't laugh."

"What's up?"

"Is my brain leaking out of my head?"

He laughs. Because obviously. And I'm very annoyed at him about it but what can I do? I'm about to tell him off but can't, because my head and my stomach decide to attack me both at the same time and I fall into a coughing fit that lands me in a fetal position on the floor. My brain sloshes around in my head like a bad batch of jungle juice. A little pile of it falls down beside me. I can see a chunk staining Matt's nice white sneakers and feel bad that I'm such a nuisance and ruining everything. Can't my brain fall out a little more politely?

"No, buddy. You look perfectly fine. Do you need to see a doctor?"

But I've already *seen* a doctor.

Matt makes me see another doctor. Just more time I could've spent studying for the qualifying exam, not that anything seems to matter anymore. Time feels like a death march towards the inevitable. I'll try to follow up tonight, try to read something, try to stay on track. The doctor admonishes me for pulling out a PDF on my phone while he's talking to me. I feel terrible. I imagine beating myself up for being a failure and then sucking the last bit of brains out from my head like a Capri-Sun. There's no hole in my head. I'm in perfect health. I'm a prime physical specimen, or at least I would be without the everything thart's wrong with me. He asks if the anxiety meds are helping. I say no.

It's my third all-nighter in a row. I'm delirious now, and the chat icons of my friends online are swimming in my head like little fishes. There's mice crawling all over my apartment, although there really aren't.

At some point during this mess I had asked my psychiatrist to put me on Adderall and started taking it. This helped for awhile, until I stopped feeling anything. It made me pretty nauseous, though, and incredibly sleepy.

I pop another Adderall into my mouth and start studying. It's Thursday, September something I don't know and don't remember and don't want to. It's my fourth all-nighter in a row.

I wake up in bed at 10pm the next day and there's an earthquake outside. Buildings crash into each other. Everybody dies. An errant bookshelf lands on my face, crushing my head for good. In one final crack, my skull gives in and the last of the brains seep out, free at last.

I realize it's just my heart beating too fast and that I'm having a panic attack.

Some things have gotten better since I started medication. I stopped losing time, or at least not losing so much. But it's not like it can reverse the damage that REALLY matters, which is of course the brain coming out of my head. And the month of time I wasted that I can never get back. No one will medicate me for those.

I brush my teeth and look at myself in the mirror. I'm gaunt, pale-faced, bloodless. How could the doctors even think to say I'm in good health? There are nail marks all over my body I never saw before. There's bright, angry lesions all over my face. I lift up my shirt and hives are forming over my stomach.

A little bit of pink brain slides out of the hole, teasing me like a stuck-out tongue. I tilt my head the other way and force it back in.

I feel feverish. Whatever brain is left in there must be boiling. I can serve it like the warm bowl of borscht my friend Raymond's nanny would make when I went to his house. Raymond was a nice boy from a nagging Chinese family. I knew him in elementary school. He had a nurse from Eastern Europe but I don't remember where. I keep having dreams of him dying in a horrible car crash lately, but of course I couldn't say that. I couldn't even if I wanted to. I haven't spoken to him in a decade and don't know where he is.

I go to another doctor, and then another. More time I'm wasting not studying for my exam. My stomach feels sick all the time. My head feels more and more empty, probably because of all the brains I'm spilling everywhere.

I take the bus to the store one day and accidentally spill my head all over some old lady with a baby. I reflect on how dire it must be that the life-ending hole in my head has become more of a day-to-day nuisance. I shouldn't be living like this. Nobody should. The old lady with her baby make me tear up, and I don't know why. I feel terrible, but the way she shushes the baby with her sweet, caring voice makes me miss my mother.

I call my mother. She's angry and demands to know why I haven't called her back for days. I check my call logs. They're all red. Bright, angry red. I've missed forty of them at least.

A piece of brain slides out and smacks onto my phone screen, pressing 'End Call' before I can get a word in edgewise.

I got a referral to a dermatologist for my hives that I might as well take up on. The derm looks terrified when I walk in. I talk to her the best I can, the most coherent I can manage these days, and she looks like she's going to call security but hangs on anyway. They run some tests on me and can't find a thing. I remember her shaking as she ushered me out of her office, with tears almost forming in the corner of her eyes. I hear muffled retching on my way out.

She sends me an email the next day from a burner account, or at least someone pretending to be her does. I don't know. She asks me why I haven't gotten the hole in my head checked, and I'm incredulous that she sees it too.

*Please go to the ER*, she replies, and I never hear from her again.

At the ER, there isn't anything wrong.

I stopped having friends at work-school, whatever you want to call it. I used to have lunch with this one girl in my department before she taught her 1PM class on Wednesdays, but she stopped seeing me after my last outburst. Nobody's particularly kind to me anymore. My supervisor avoids my glance when we're in the same room together, and another one of the faculty always looks at me with eyes that seem pitying and pained. Everyone is ignoring me. Everybody hates me. Who wants to be friends with a freak with a hole in his head, let alone a hole-in-the-head freak who's going to fail his qualifying exam and isn't long for this world anyways? At least, I think so.

I ask Matt if I seem abnormal or incoherent lately after class. He's stuck around, though he seems increasingly like he doesn't want to.

"You seemed fine. Maybe a little hyper-active at times. Is the Adderall working correctly?"

"Are you sure that's it? And yes, the Adderall is fine."

"There is nothing else abnormal about you and I'm really concerned that you keep asking me."

"I think everyone in this department hates me. I can see it in their eyes."

"I don't know what to say to that."

He stops talking to me afterwards.

I'm writing this because the *crunching* has started again. Whatever attacked my head the first time isn't giving up, and I can feel it licking the folds of my brain with every slurp, slurp it takes. Something pushes down on the bone of my skull, causing painful cracks and fissures to radiate out from the whole hole. My head feels like cotton candy. My movements ar e jerky' fofr once it seems it's affecting my motor function, too.

I don't know who to turn to. I've alienated everyone I know. My eyes feel so heavy and my head feels like hot, searing fire. No doctor in the world can even see how pale I am, let alone the hole in my head, besides one woman whose name I can't even find anymore when I try to search her up online. What's happening to me?

I'm scared, guys. I'm really, really scared.
