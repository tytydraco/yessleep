I’ve been having dreams lately, which, as normal as it sounds, is pretty unusual for me. I’ve never been one to recall a single detail from my dreams, and yet here I am, remembering a whole dreamlike sequence from start to finish.
 
It always starts with me in third-person view, standing in my kitchen, surrounded by familiar faces. I watch in horror from the corner of the room as my other self picks up a kitchen knife and, one by one, mercilessly kills every single one of my friends. 

I’m sure some freak out there could tell me the exact meaning of this dream—and I sincerely hope it means I’m getting rich soon—but I can’t fathom the fact that I have to confess this to anyone.

Because, as chilling an action as it is to murder everyone you love, it does not compare to what happens next. Or rather, during it. It doesn’t matter whether the knife digs into their stomach or their throat; every victim is silent and cold. No fear in their eyes, no will to survive.

And the most bizarre part: they all look at me. Not the cold-blooded killer version of me that is ravaging through them, but the one watching everything from the corner of the room. I usually wake up before the fifth body drops, which is what happened that morning as well.

It was notably cold. My gaze met the alarm clock that was screaming at me from the corner of the nightstand. With wide-open eyes, I managed to read the time and date: seven o’clock, the fifth of January. I looked outside my window to see slight drops of rain. It never bothered me; I love the smell of wet dirt and humid air.

I got up and wiped the small pool of water that formed below the window overnight. I always sleep with it open. I feel safer that way. With light steps I made it to the bathroom. Leaning over the sink, I splashed some water on my face, although I never understood the use of it.

I began my morning routine; I brushed my teeth, I flossed, I applied some skincare products that apparently helped delay aging… I’m pretty weird, aren’t I? Worrying about withering away at the age of 25.

Finally, I looked at myself staring back at me in the mirror, hoping it doesn’t murder me. I practiced my smile. It had always bothered me since it looked crooked. It might have been me overthinking it, but it looked like a robot’s best attempt at being human. After a while, I gave up.

“My name is Helen Brown,” I told myself, putting on a friendly mask. From my understanding, it’s mandatory when you work in real estate.
“How can I help you?” I paused.
“No, too straightforward…” I told myself. “How can I be of use today? Yeah, much better.”

I was on my way to the kitchen when I heard it again. The knocking from the basement. Although it’s a one-story house, it has an underground room guarded by an old wooden door. The place is small and cramped, so I’ve been using the extra space to store random tools and the washing machine.

I live alone, so the house is usually quiet. That’s probably the only reason I could hear it. As it got louder and louder, I couldn’t help but get annoyed. If this continued, I’d have to deal with it. It might sound like I’m one of those horror movie protagonists that do everything but run away, but if you were in my shoes, you’d be annoyed too.

It was this really irritating knock, followed by the faint sound of chains. It had gotten more intense since the day before, which wasn’t a good sign. I tried to Google it, but I wasn’t quite sure what it I was supposed to be searching for. Every successful attempt at describing the problem in a short sentence was met with completely unrelated results. For example, a horror novel. What was I supposed to do with that?

It’s also worth noting that it got even louder when I went down there, much to my displeasure. I wasn’t particularly scared of it. It was just this weird thing that kept happening for whatever reason. A drop in a puddle.

I finally made it to the kitchen and prepared some coffee. I drank it plain since I don’t like the taste of sugar and grabbed the bottle of milk from the top of the fridge. Why do I have such a tall fridge? It’s really impractical for a short woman. Regardless, I poured some into my coffee and left the carton on the counter.

I mindlessly checked my phone. It was a quarter to eight, which meant I had about forty-five minutes until Jules was there to pick me up. She was my coworker—the only one who was my age. We’ve been hanging out for two years at that point, ever since we both realized that our other options at work were salivating old men and bitchy middle-aged women.

My thoughts are interrupted by a loud thud. It came from the familiar source of all sounds. I opened the fridge door and put my coffee mug inside. I then headed toward the basement door with determined steps. This could not keep happening. It gets to a point.
As I was about to open the door, my phone rang; “Armageddon” was the contact name.

“Hello…?” I answered.

“Helen, dear,” the voice replied from the other end. It was calm and sweet. I turned away from the basement door. I guess I’d deal with it another time. “How have you been?”

“Busy, I guess,” I replied as I headed towards the fridge to retrieve my coffee.

“Poor thing… Have you been eating properly?”

“Yeah,” I took a sip of the now chilly liquid.

“That’s great. Anyway, honey, I don’t want to sound like a whiny old lady, but I just got a bit worried. Your father told me not to call you because you’re probably busy, but he’s outside with Nathan fixing the Chevy, so I decided to be a little naughty.” She laughed at her own words.

“Work has been killing me lately, so Father is right.”

”’Father’ Looks like someone matured suddenly.” She let out a dry laugh, followed by the click of a lighter. There was an inhale, and then the sound of an object gently thrown on a wooden surface. “Anyway, dear, I won’t bother you any longer. I just got a bit worried since you always call us on the weekend, and this was the first one you missed in seven years.”

”I’m sorry. I’ve been running around a lot lately—I can’t catch a break. Today is the busiest Monday of the month. Hope you understand.” I reached for the kitchen counter and lit my own cigarette, the warmth of the smoke familiar to my lungs. I’ve gotten used to it sooner than I expected. Jules kept coughing for months after she picked it up.
 
“I do. Just… take care of yourself. I love you.”

”Love you too, mum.” I replied, hanging up.

I lightly tapped the cigarette, causing the ash to fall from grace, and after a few seconds it finally met the cold surface of the sink. 

My little smoking-in-the-dark session was interrupted by the doorbell. There’s a window next to the door, so I could see Jules grimacing at me through it. I smiled and walked towards her.

“We have, like, twenty minutes to spare, so I decided to intrude,” she joked as she entered the living room, making herself comfortable on the small white couch. She reached for the ashtray on the corner of the table.

Much to my annoyance, I had to go to the kitchen to retrieve my coffee for a second time. I know it seems minute, but unnecessary repetitions genuinely exasperate me. That small observation aside, I sat next to her on the couch.

She looked at me with her vibrant green eyes as the smoke traveled out her nostrils effortlessly. 

“I didn’t expect you to be up this early.”

“Me neither,” I joked. I put out my cigarette on the ashtray, one that’s frankly seen better days, and leaned back. I took a good look at Jules.

I’m not the jealous type. I’ve never felt an ounce of jealousy in my entire life. But I wish I looked like her. Her sharp jawline, the short black hair effortlessly framing her beautiful face, the piercing green eyes that looked right through you.

 Of course, one could argue that she had a killer body too, but that would be really superficial of me to admit. 

It wasn’t just her looks I adored. She was funny, talkative, social, and considerate… maybe too considerate at times, which could get overwhelming. I always found myself captivated by her. I wondered what she smelled like. I bet her skin was really soft and has the aroma of the vibrant pink flowers I used to see in the woods all the time. But then again, I had a boyfriend, so it was really weird to think of that stuff… I think.

“Can’t wait for that eight-hour shift at that shithole,” she exhaled. I recognized that feeling: annoyance, unease.

“Pays the bills, though.”

”Bitch, the bills will have to pay themselves if that fugly old raisin stares at my ass like that again. He doesn’t look at anything else. Like, let me do the work you hired me to do, jeez.”

Her complaints were fair. It was true that our boss was weird, in a predatory way. But I guess that was to be expected. He wouldn’t act on it, or at least he hadn’t done so yet. Good for him. Wouldn’t be so pretty if he did. It’d be a shame to throw my life away.

“Just put up with it,” I chuckled. “It’s not like we spend all day with him. Besides, won’t you be sent to that house at the port today?”

”Nope, that was last week,” she muttered, disappointed. “You better drink some more coffee, girl. Your memory is all fucked up.”

”Maybe some wine would be better,” I joked.

Jules smirked. “Now we’re talking.”

She got up and headed towards my kitchen. She seemed to know her way around; she even instinctively lowered her head while passing through the empty door frame. It was too low, for whatever reason. Short people like me never felt the fear of banging their heads, so that’s why I hadn’t really noticed it probably.  

She hastily filled two glasses with wine and came back, leaving them on the wooden coffee table. The amber liquid reflected whatever light managed to slip through the closed curtains. She took a sip and let out a relieved sigh.

“Speaking of wine, are you coming tonight?”

I stared at my glass for a moment. What was it again? Since there was wine involved, it was probably a party of some sort… or a social gathering?

“Yeah, why not?” I finally replied.
Jules looked at me, surprised.

“Wait, for real? You aren’t fucking with me, are you?”

”Nope, why would I?” I asked, taking a sip of wine. The taste was the same as it was the day before. It reminded me of juice for some reason. A spiked one at that.

“Bitch, I’ve been trying to convince you for ages. You sure, right?”

”Yeah!” I flashed a smile. She smiled back, her eyes shining with excitement. 

How pretty it was to witness life: the racing of the heart, the overwhelming warmth, the excited childish gaze… I sound like an old, dying woman, don’t I?

A few moments of silence passed, and she stood up.

“I’m gonna go to the bathroom and then we’re out.”

”Sure, take your time,” I reassured her.

She downed the wine in one sip and started heading away.

“Have you eaten, by the way?” She asked over her shoulder.

“Not hungry, you know me.”

”You have to work on that. Did you know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day?” Her voice kept getting lower and lower as she finally closed the bathroom door.

As expected, the knocking from the basement resumed. So I finally figured out the trigger: any type of outside noise. When Jules went past the old wooden door that led to it, it started again.

This wasn’t really optimal. If Jules heard it, what would I say? She wouldn’t dismiss it; her personality wouldn’t let her. Plus, she’d surely get anxious at first, then scared. She wasn’t exactly fond of horror, to the point where she’d get mortified by even the slightest sudden sound.

“Has the wine hit me, or are there sounds coming from the basement?” she asked, as if she read my mind. I didn’t realize she’d come back from the bathroom.

“Probably the washing machine...”

”That’s scary…” she admitted. 

I’ve been putting it off for the past four days. That was when the sounds first started.I guess, in a weird way, it made sense that they would amplify whenever I headed down to the basement, but what was the point of them even being made when I was outside the room? I’d have to deal with it. Not when Jules was there, obviously. When I got back from work that day.

“Anyway, the chicken sandwich from the cafeteria really messed my fucking stomach up,” she said suddenly, trying to dismiss her obvious unease.

“Nah, I’m fine. You just have a weak stomach,” I joked absentmindedly.

There was a silence. I finally looked behind my shoulder to face her. Her eyes were wide open, her expression that of a surprise. She looked like she’d seen a ghost. A really terrifying one. Did she realize? Did she know?

“Helen… did you eat the sandwich too?” she asked.

“Yeah? It’s just a sandwich…”

“Helen… aren't you vegan..?”

I stared at her for five long seconds.

“Well, new year, new me. I just couldn’t resist it anymore.”

Jules’ worry was replaced with a knowing smirk.

“I knew it! No sane person can be fucking vegan. Well, at least now I can take you to my favorite barbecue spots.”

I looked at her up and down. Such a beautiful woman. That was a slip-up on my end. I wouldn’t let it happen again. I couldn’t afford it. I was really, really glad she didn’t react the way I thought she would. I slowly stood up, adjusting my suit pants. I met her halfway, and we both headed for the door.

“By the way, Justin is coming too tonight… you aren’t mad at him still, right?” she asked as I searched for my keys.

“Nope,” I replied dryly.

“Good. I knew you’d forget about it. It’s a silly thing to get mad at. I mean, it’s his childhood friend. Besides, look at you. No need to get jealous; he’s smart enough to know you’re a hundred times sexier than that bitch. And, Helen, I mean this in the nicest way possible: I’m glad you’re overcoming your jealousy issues.”

As we were about to leave, the knocking got louder. In fact, it got so loud that the chains rattling against the cold wooden floor could be heard as well.

Jules looked at me, her eyes bloodshot. She closed the door and rushed towards the living room, hiding behind the couch. She then nodded at me to come over, whispering something I couldn’t quite hear. I locked the door and obeyed.

“Something is fucking down there,” she whispered.

I also hid behind the couch next to her. “Don’t be silly, Jules. I probably forgot something in a pocket, and it’s banging as the washing machine is spinning.”

“Cut the shit, Helen. You know this is not fucking normal. That’s not what a fucking washing machine sounds like.”
She took her phone out and tapped the call icon. “We should call the cops.”

“And what will we tell them? That there’s knocking on my basement? That two grown women are pissing themselves over what could be a rat that’s trapped in there?”

“I don’t fucking know,” she said, louder now. “Fuck this, I’m doing it.”

She began dialing 911. I grabbed her hand, which made her jump a bit.

“Alright. How about we check on it first, just to be sure.”

That was all I had left. A desperate attempt to deescalate the situation.

”Helen, why the fuck would we check it out!?” She practically yelled at me, which also made the knocking turn to loud banging. “Whatever is down there wants to fucking hurt us!”

That was another thing that irritated me about her. When she put her mind to something, she wouldn’t let it go. Why would this happen? Why wouldn’t she listen to me? Didn’t she realize what she was doing?

I grabbed her wrist, causing her to drop her phone on the couch. She looked at me, her eyes wide. I could feel her heart racing, her skin getting colder as panic rushed through every single fiber of her being. Even now, she looked like an angel.

She looked at my hand. There was a bit of warm blood where my nails pierced her pale skin. Tears started forming in her eyes. Her voice came out weak. Low cries mixed with it.

“Helen, don’t you…” she said and paused, as if she couldn’t stomach what she was seeing. “Don’t you have a birthmark on your hand? Where… where is it? This is a prank, right?”

There was a long silence after that. Her piercing green eyes never left mine. It felt as if every other sound stopped, and the only thing that existed was us two. She noticed me. She noticed me for who I am. I loved her. I loved her so… so much. I leaned closer and gently kissed her lips. She showed no resistance. I could feel her terrified gaze landing on my closed eyelids. I pulled back slowly.

“Why did you have to notice, Jules?” I ask, my voice soft. “Weren’t we doing just fine?”

“N… notice what, Helen?” she laughed awkwardly, though her voice came out tense.

“You know, don’t you?”

“K.. know what? Helen, please stop. This… this isn’t funny.”

“Why would I try to be funny, Jules?”

She let out a forced laugh. She began rubbing my hand with aggression.

“I’ll give you that, you made it look convincing. What foundation did you use to cover it?” her voice kept breaking.

I simply observed her, unable to understand what she was trying to accomplish.

“It’s a prank, right? Right, Helen? You.. you know I don’t like scary stuff. Is Justin making noises in the basement?”

She let out  an even more forced, high-pitched laugh. “That little bitch!”

The tears that hadn’t stopped revealed the truth we both knew.

“About the whole… kiss thing, we will discuss it on our way to work. Al… alright? Now let me go. Please.”

“You do realize I can’t do that, right?” I replied, confirming the worst case scenario she had probably made in her head. I tried my best to sound friendly.

She threw my hand away and rushed towards the door, almost tripping on the leg of the table. I let her go. I didn’t want to scare her even more. Besides, the door was locked, and I had the key.

She fought the doorknob like a child trying to break into a cabinet full of treats. She was, quite frankly, so adorable. I slowly stood on my feet and made my way toward her. She looked at me and back at the knob in rapid succession. After she realized there was no exit available, she sank down, her back glued to the door like a cornered animal. She looked up at me as if I were some monster. 

I grabbed her by the hair and dragged her to the kitchen. 

“Helen, what the fuck! Stop!” she screamed but it was no use. She knew. I couldn’t allow that.

I threw her; she hit the side of the marble counter hard. She let out a pained grunt as tears traversed her sharp cheeks like a wild river. It reminded me of the river in the woods where I used to pass the time. I grabbed the kitchen knife.

“Helen, what! What are you doing! Helen! It’s me, Jules!” she screamed, her desperation evident. She flailed like a fish on shore. I clamped my hand over her mouth and drove the knife into her stomach.

Her eyes widened. Her breathing quickened. I felt the blood exit as she coughed, staining my palm. I pulled my hand away since there was no way for her to scream anymore as the amber liquid flooded her mouth.

“It’s your fault that this happened. You could have ignored it, you know. We could have been so happy. Why would you do that, Jules? Why?”

All that came out of her mouth was gibberish as she choked on the liquid. Her breath smelled of that familiar, metallic aroma. I drove the knife into her stomach three more times. I watched as her eyes slowly lost their spark. I closed them and softly let her fall onto the marble floor.

I was so absorbed in my intimate moment with Jules that I had completely forgotten about the basement. The banging was as intense as ever, only drowned out when Jules’ phone rang in her pocket. I caressed her cheek one last time. Her skin truly was soft. The contact name was “Boss.”

I tried my best to recall Jules’ voice. Its friendliness mixed with a low, almost seductive tone. I coughed a bit as it helped me readjust my vocal cords.

“Hello?” I said, imitating her voice.

“Where are you?” the raspy voice of our boss asked from the other end. I could practically smell the oil on his hair through the phone.

“I’m not feeling so well. Do you mind if I don’t come to work today?”

The boss scoffed but gave in. “Yeah you… you sound a bit weird. Sore throat? Fine,” he said, and hung up.

I guess my impression wasn't perfect after all.

Obviously, he called me - Helen - as well, and I said the same thing. He let me stay at home; however, he clarified that I’d have to work on Saturday to make it up. No problem. I guess Jules was the only one getting special treatment.

I hung up and headed towards the basement door, dropping on all fours. The tips of my fingers landed lightly on the cold floor. At last. Walking on two legs was getting uncomfortable. 

The old wooden piece of wood creaked as I opened it. I counted the stairs as I went down head first. The chains rattled violently as I approached. Fear. That’s what it was. The reason for the amplification of the sound was human fear.

The blindfold on her eyes and the tape on her mouth were slightly displaced, and the chains had left marks on her wrists and ankles. As for the knocking, I thought she must have been banging her head against the wall behind her. All that effort… poor thing.

I removed her blindfold and the tape. There she was. Helen Brown. Staring back at me as if I were some monster.

“Who are you!? Why are you doing this!? What did you do to Jules!?” She began screaming at the top of her lungs. 

I noticed that her voice was a bit more high pitched than what I had adopted. I needed to work on that. At the same time, I wondered how Jules didn’t notice the faulty voice from the beginning. Or perhaps, she did. Didn’t really matter at that point.

I smiled. The same smile I had practiced for the past four days. It was unfortunate to see that it petrified her even more. I had spent so much time perfecting it. What a mean human being.

“My name is Helen Brown,” I told myself, putting on a friendly mask. From my understanding, it’s mandatory when you work in real estate.

“How can I be of use today?”
