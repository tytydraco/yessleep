im not sure where to begin, i have been experiencing the paranormal since i was an infant. i guess ill start there with the most common thing that has occurred. at night my blankets would sometimes pull towards the foot of the bed and then on the floor. this would occur so often throughout my life that i developed a knee-jerk reaction where i snap out of wake at the first hint of my covers moving and grab them as fast as i could. made a new years resolution at age 10 to keep count, keep track, make notes, things accelerated when i did but i counted to 60 by july of that year. every night for a week i would be woken up to a tug of war. i cut my summer visitation with my father short the night i was stripped of my blanket 3 times. i can recall my mother telling stories of finding my baby blankets on the floor or down the hallway. she would tuck them under two baby mattresses with me on that and she would put it i was just a strong kicker as a baby. i became so enraged i tried to fist fight it during one weekend visitation when i had the entire house to myself. screaming and cussing while swinging my fists in the air. that entire weekend is very fuzzy but i recall a dream so hellish i woke up that sunday physicaly exhausted yet could not remain in bed. i trudged outside to my mothers car who was already there and honking the horn. she asked "where did you get all those bruises?" i had no idea there were any but when i looked in the mirror my back was almost solid purple with many large bruises dotting my limbs. i get a call later that evening from my father asking why his home was completely thrashed top to bottom.  
 other kind of things have happened, portrats and hats moving threw the air. since my eyesight was poor from an early age i learned to focus on certain shapes and colors to identify people and things. for my dad it was a distinctive blue employee ballcap he wore when doing anything. i think i was trying to get my dad to a trampoline or outside for something but i didnt understand how rickity and worn out he was. i was yelled at to "drop it"   
 after that i spotted my dads hat moving out the front door and around towards the backyard passing 3 windows. i bolt outside and around the corner for the backyard. get to the trampoline and realize there is no moon and i am completely in the dark. i then hear my fathers voice coming from the front door to get back inside and asking what im doing out there. i find out my dad was late for work cuz he couldn't  find his hat, it had been sitting in the backyard.  
 one of the times was so violent it tore the skin on my arm leaving me and my bed covered in blood. this was in broad daylight while i was reading a comic book at the edge of my bed. the comic is in my lap and i lick my left thumb to turn a page when it locks in place. i start to experience sharp pain and jerk my arm hard as some sort of force seems to try keeping it in one place. the squeezing clamping feeling on my forearm becomes hard to bare as i struggle harder getting to my feet. with a big heave i yank my arm to my chest and run down the stairs to the sink. i hold my arm under the faucet and as the blood is washed away i start to see bite marks, clear indentations for molars and punctures for fangs, i go to my dog and note the pattern of molar to fang in the mouth. my arm shows the same pattern of fang to molar. only more spaced apart,  
 my first suicide attempt was at age 13, i was sitting on the edge of a car trail threw the woods with a box cutter held to the inside of my elbow. i was working up the nerve for one swift cut up my wrist. i closed my eyes took serveral deep breaths and began pushing the blade into the inside of my forearm. i then feel a wet warm tongue against my cheek. my first and bestest dog had been missing for over a week. my eyes open and burst into tears, drop the boxcutter and hug my dog.  
   a few minutes pass and im just holding onto him desperatly. i notice that he is beginning to tremble as if fireworks are going off. i loosen my grip and ask "whats wrong boy?" the trembling intensifies as our eyes meet. i see his eyes dart to something behind me before he bolts for the tree line. im sitting there dumbfounded and at a loss when a loud heavy thud happens behind me in mud. followed by 4 more stomps aprouching my back. i jump to my feet and spin around. the tall grass stalks were parted going out a few feet. i have screamed in sheer terror only 2-3 times in my 34 years of life. at that moment i felt pure fear and bolted towards the dry creek bed that seperates the backyard from the main house. i must of lept over it cuz i dont remember stopping until i got inside and sat down next to my dad.  
  i think some of the incidents might be repressed. when i concentrate hard i can recall memories from infancy. my mother looking deep into my eyes as she held me and hummed a tune i can still hear to this day. when i apply that focus to some of these events i struggle to decide if what im recalling is fiction or fact. hanging in the air by my ankle seems too far fetched  as does the shapes i think were looming over my baby crib, some i can recall sharply at first but the details get fuzzier the more i push. the darkest attack ive had was around a full length mirror with a swivel and wooden frame. my homework was to look at our eyes closes in the mirror and draw it. i have near sightedness and my eye was a milimeter or two from the surface, when the mirror swiveled away from my face. a single moment passed before i was pushed to the ground. i tried so very hard to sit up but felt as though i was being sat on by an elephant. i do not know what happens next i pass out and am woken up by my mom coming home from work, i have no idea where the paper i was drawing my pupils on went but i never seen it since and took a zero for the grade.  
  there is far too much to recall or post in one sitting so i will add more when i remember it. but if anyone can shed some kind of information for me, something anything if anyones gone threw similar pls tell me how you dealt with it. i am not presently not feeling any kind of oppression or this overwhelming feeling something is directly behind me. nothing has happened for many years and i dont live in my fathers house anymore. the house was build in 1912 and im the first born male in several generations. my sister has come forward saying that she has seen moving shadows and other things. but never by herself only with me. around me or near me. i dont think these things can fit inside an explanation that my multiple sclerosis is causing me to hallucinate or im having night terrors. i just want answers and i have more to add.
