The dinner party was my idea, because I am a vain bitch.

Carla and Edith may have the Harvard physicist husbands and *gifted* kids and lavish European vacations, but dammit, I was going to have *something.* And it ended up being a house.

Did I buy this house knowing there was probably something wrong with it? Yes. Did I care? Not particularly. As soon as the realtor showed me the place, I knew I had to have it. Bless her heart, she was actually trying to be honest. “There might be a little water damage,” she said, gesturing to the stain on the wall that was clearly in the shape of a woman’s face. “No one’s been in the basement for decades,” she said, as a horrible thumping noise came down from below us.

“When can we close?”

“But I haven’t shown you the attic yet,” she protested. “There’s something you should see up there…”

“*When can we close?”*

I’d replayed the fantasy in my head a hundred times. My sisters’ looks of shock as they walked up the front porch steps. I’d relived it more than any sexual fantasy, that’s for sure. The look of their jaws dropping open, validating my existence, was downright orgasmic.

*They’re not going to believe their eyes.*

We moved in in a rush. Isabel originally started out in the front bedroom, but the woman in the closet became a problem. “A woman can’t fit in there,” I’d reassured her, but she explained to me that the woman “folded herself up like a spider” to fit. Jack didn’t like his room either, complaining of the “man that hangs from the ceiling and stares at me all night.”

I hadn’t experienced anything in the owner’s suite, so I put the kids in there. I decided to sleep in Isabel’s old room (a haunted woman sounded marginally better than a haunted man, you know how men can be) and things went okay after that. It was always a pain putting the chairs back every morning (no matter how we arranged them at night, they were always stacked on each other in the morning so they reached the ceiling.) There were other issues too, but for the most part, we were surviving.

The day of the party, I couldn’t sit still. I skittered around the house, straightening the table cloth, arranging the flowers just so. “Mommy, can I have one?” Isabel asked, staring forlornly at the mini-sandwiches I’d made on a multi-tiered plate.

I hesitated. Even one missing would throw off the symmetry of the whole thing. But I didn’t want to be the bad mom. (I suppose some people might argue that moving your kids into a haunted house is what a “bad mom” would do also, but eh, to each their own.)

“You can have one,” I told her, moving to ruffle her hair—then stopping myself. Wouldn’t want her to have messy hair when they arrived.

Then I stationed myself right behind the door, staring out the peephole. Ten minutes later, I saw Carla’s SUV pulling up. And a few minutes after that, Edith’s.

I watched them walk up the steps.

And boy, did their mouths drop open.

I desperately wished I could read lips as I watched Carla say something to Edith, gesturing at the porch. *They’re so pissed! This is awesome*—

“Mom?”

“Not now, your aunts are here—”

“But the sink’s making blood again.”

I jumped back from the door. *“What?!”*

“There’s blood coming out of the faucet,” she said plainly.

And then I heard Jack giggling in the kitchen.

*Fuckfuckfuck.*

The doorbell rang, but I was sprinting away from the door, into the kitchen—*oh, no.* There was, indeed, blood coming out of the perfectly-polished kitchen faucet. It splattered onto the quartz countertops, staining them red. And there was Jack, running his hands through it, the edges of his sleeves red, giggling like a madman.

*“JACK!”*

He turned around, still grinning.

I turned off the sink. “Tell Aunt Carla and Aunt Edith I’ll be there in a second,” I told Isabel, grappling with Jack, “*and do not let them in the house.”*

“Yes, Mommy.”

I was lucky to have Isabel. She was a smart kid, smarter than me. Must’ve gotten it from her dad.

Ten minutes later, Jack and I were making it down the curved staircase. Him in a new, crisp-white shirt. Me with the faintest ghost of blood around my fingernails. Isabel, bless her little soul, was standing in the doorway talking up a storm with her aunts.

“—and that’s why poison dart frogs are poisonous,” she was saying. “It’s what they’re *eating* in the rain forest. Not a single frog in a zoo has ever been—”

I appeared behind her. “Hi!” I said, breathless. “Sorry for the wait! Come on in!”

They both silently stepped in. “Woah!” Sam, Edith’s boy, said. “This isn’t like what you described—”

“Sssshhh,” Edith cut him off.

“This is really nice,” Carla said. But her voice was heavy, carrying—what? Jealousy? Suspicion? Maybe she thought I’d robbed a bank, or worse, become a crack dealer. Well, good. Let her dream up her little conspiracies.

“Woah!” Carla’s husband Jacob said, completely clueless and not reading the room, as he stepped in after. “This is *amazing!”*

“Thank you,” I replied.

“I didn’t think you could aff—”

*“Kevin,”* Carla hissed.

He shut up and gave me an awkward grin.

“Come on in, I’ve got some hors d’oeuvres for you all.” I ushered them into the dining room, where I kept the sandwiches. I quickly noticed a turkey-and-swiss had a deep red fingerprint on it. *Fuck.* I grabbed it and stuffed it into my mouth whole.

*Hope that blood doesn’t carry any bloodborne diseases!* a little voice singsonged in my head.

*Well, we’ll fucking find out, won’t we?* I thought as I swallowed.

Jack sat at the table, kicking his legs, slowly unraveling his shirt as he pulled at a loose thread. Isabel stood next to me, absolutely motionless, surveying the scene.

*As long as I can keep everything under control for two hours,* I thought. *They don’t stay long. Edith’s kids have a strict 8 o’clock bedtime.*

My eyes unconsciously flicked to the three deadbolts over the basement door. Then the crack of darkness underneath the door. I swallowed.

*Two hours.*

*We can do it for two hours.*

*Right?*

“These are delicious,” Edith said. “Did you make them?”

I nodded. “Isabel helped me.”

“Little chef there, aren’t ya?” Carla said, shooting her a big grin.

Like she even cared about my kid.

Okay. That was harsh. Of course she cared about Isabel. But by the same token, I hadn’t seen her rushing to babysit when Eric left, or bringing over lasagnas and brownies, or swinging by with Carrie and Colin for a playdate. Neither of them reached out a helping hand when we were groundless, buoys on the water, drifting between schools and zip codes. 

“Can we see the upstairs?” Colin asked, with a big, toothy grin.

“Yeah, can we?” Carrie asked.

“Uh…” The woman in the closet flashed through my mind, sitting on the floor, crumpled in on herself. Her head upside-down, black eyes glittering in the shadows. “Sorry, no, it’s really messy up there. First floor only, please.” I shot a look at the deadbolts again. “No basement, either.”

“Aw, man,” Colin groaned.

Then the creaking started.

It started above us, in the far corner of the dining room, and then slowly moved to the opposite end. Edith’s apathetic teenager, Sam, looked up from his phone for a second. Edith shot me a look—“Someone else here?”

I shook my head. “Nonono, the house just settles a lot, is all.”

I glanced at the oven clock.

Six minutes.

They’d been here six minutes.

*Fuck.*

“Okay, uh, let’s just establish some ground rules,” I said hastily. Edith raised an eyebrow. Carla looked skeptical. “No upstairs, no downstairs, okay? We stay on this floor. And also, uh, the kitchen sink has been having issues, so use the bathroom sink if you need to wash your hands.”

Carla and Edith exchanged a look.

“Also! If anyone has any injuries, like injuries that draw blood, immediately go outside.”

Now the kids were staring at me too, eyes wide.

*Shit. I didn’t have to say that. The chances that someone would draw blood in the next one hour, fifty-three minutes were tiny. I could’ve just hung onto that rule… and waited… and only said it if someone actually hurt themselves.*

*Now Carla and Edith are looking at me like I’m crazy.*

*No, no, not crazy.*

*They’re looking at me like they think I’m hiding something.*

*Like a mold problem. Or a bat problem. Or something…*

“Let me get the food ready,” I said, clearing my throat. “Give me a sec.”

I disappeared into the kitchen. I’d picked up some chickens from Boston Market and put them in the oven to warm up. I walked over, grabbed the oven door—

I quickly slammed it shut.

*Fuck fuck fuck.*

What had been staring out at me was not a well-seasoned bird, but a woman’s head, skin crispy and eyes charred.

*Why the fuck did you use the oven?* I scolded myself.

*You know this happens sometimes.*

*You* know *this.*

“Mom, are you okay?” Isabel whispered behind me.

“It’s Rosemary,” I whispered back.

“Oh. I know how to get rid of her.” She walked over to the salt pig and grabbed a pinch of kosher salt. Without looking, she cracked the oven door open and threw the salt in. I heard a sizzling sound, that almost sounded like a shriek—and when I looked in the oven, the birds were back.

“Wow. How’d you figure that one out?” I whispered.

“When you were at work late. A few weeks ago. Jack was hungry, I cooked a pizza, but she was there. Salt repels ghosts, so I tried that. Sage does too, but it only made her really mad.”

Wow. She was *so* smart for a thirteen-year-old.

I donned the oven mitts and pulled the birds out. Got all the other side dishes out. “Okay, let’s eat!” I called, my heart pounding in my chest.

*One hour, forty-seven minutes left.*

\*\*\*

“This is delicious,” Carla said. “How’d you season it?”

“Oh, just the usual. Sage, garlic… rosemary…”

Isabel began to giggle. I shot her a smile.

Things seemed to be going okay. No one had mentioned Eric yet. No one had tried to use the kitchen sink. And the piles of teeth hadn’t started appearing.

Maybe things would go okay.

*One hour, thirteen minutes left…*

A loud *thump* came from upstairs. Carla stopped chewing and looked up. “You have mice or something?” she asked.

“Nope,” I replied. “Not mice.”

“Sounds like an animal,” she said, stabbing at her chicken. “Could be a raccoon. Raccoons can transmit rabies, you know. You should get someone out here to take a look—”

“It’s *not* a raccoon.”

“Okay, okay,” Carla said. “Just trying to help.”

*No, you’re not. You’re trying to tear down this house because you’re jealous.* My heart twinged. *After everything I’ve done. You’re trying to take it away from me.*

Edith said nothing, but I could tell she was thinking something. She kept shooting Carla conspiratorial glances. No doubt they’d be having an hour phone conversation tonight, sorting through every detail of the evening, picking it apart. *And she wouldn’t even let us go upstairs!* I could picture Edith saying. *It’s got to be bad. Maybe black mold. Or water damage.*

*Yeah, she was so weird about that,* I could picture Carla saying. *What’s she trying to hide so bad? A dead body?*

Well, yeah, sort of.

I stabbed at my chicken, trying not to think of Rosemary’s blistered skin, and ate it. With each bite I got madder and madder. They’d moved on to other topics now—Edith’s vacation to France—but obviously they were still thinking about me, thinking about this house—

Thinking about how Eric left me—

Thinking about what idiot doesn’t sniff out an affair for *two years—*

Thinking of all the coke I must’ve sold to buy this house—

Thinking they’d never buy this house, it wasn’t good enough for them either, with its black-mold-rabid-raccoons-dismembered-woman-in-the-attic—

“Wait,” I said, looking up from my food. “Where’s Sam?”

“Oh, he went to use the bathroom upstairs,” Edith said. “Jacob’s in the one down here.”

My heartbeat skyrocketed.

“I… said… *no one… upstairs,”* I snarled.

“Yeah, but he had to use the bathroom!” Edith said. “Why are you acting so odd, anyway? This entire dinner you’ve been—”

A metallic *thunk* came from upstairs.

I didn’t wait for Edith to finish her thought. I bounded up the stairs two at a time. As I got to the top, I saw that the bathroom door was closed.

And there was a thin layer of water, seeping out from under the crack in the door and into the hallway.

*Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.*

I ran over to the door. Tried the handle. It was locked.

“Sam!” I shouted. “Sam, can you hear me!”

A gurgling noise came from the other side.

Like someone trying to talk, under water.

I felt above the doorframe for the key. Hand shaking, I put it into the tiny hole in the doorknob. My hands shook as I maneuvered it, trying to get the door to unlock. I was so bad at this—it was so hard to get it perfectly positioned—

*Click.*

I burst into the bathroom.

The green tile floor was covered in water.

It was flowing over the sides of the bathtub. Which was mostly obscured by the shower curtain.

Poking out from the edge of the shower curtain, though, I could see two things—

Sam’s dockside shoes and the hem of his blue jeans, underwater.

And long, wet black hair trailing into the water.

I yanked the shower curtain back and the *thing—*the emaciated woman-like thing with the gaping wounds all over her body, balancing herself on the edges of the tub, hovering over Sam, holding him underwater—leapt off the bathtub and onto the floor.

Her body hit the wet tile with a splash.

I lurched for the bathtub and grabbed Sam, pulled him out of the water. He coughed and sputtered and clawed at me, desperate to get away from the thing. It scrambled into the space between the toilet and the wall, hissing.

“Sam!”

I looked up to see Edith running into the bathroom, her face deathly pale. “*What the hell did you do to him?!”* she screamed at me, after confirming he was alive.

“It wasn’t me. It was *that.”*

I pointed to the thing, hair trailing over her face now, one pure-white eye peeking out at us.

Her entire body froze.

Then, without a word, she grabbed Sam and pulled him out of the bathroom.

I don’t quite remember what happened after that. I remember Carla screaming at me. I remember Carrie crying. Or maybe it was Colin. I remember them getting out of my house as fast as humanly possible, while Isabel and Jack cowered behind me.

And then they were gone.

Water dripped off the balcony that overlooked the foyer, falling onto the beautiful hardwood with a *drip, drip, drip.*

The wood creaked over our heads. It was probably the man that hangs from the ceiling. He likes to stretch his legs sometimes.

The thing in the bathroom was still hissing.

“Mom,” Isabel said, looking up at me. “Can we get a different house?”

I stared out the window, at the wraparound porch, the wooden swing, the setting sun.

“I think that’s probably a good idea.”
