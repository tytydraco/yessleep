Part 1.

Me and David became close from the second he sat next to me at that party. I distinctly remember those brown eyes and curly brown hair that he never really combed, but the messy look suited him very well. He was tall, Hispanic, and had a perfectly trimmed beared that covered his masculine features. I always did my best to sneak behind him and comb his hair while he was distracted, either texting on his phone, napping, or watching highlights of his favorite basketball team on the couch. This always seemed to upset him, so I didn't do it very often.

I admittedly didn't know too much about his past throughout our short-lived relationship, but he never really spoke about it up until the end. Maybe it was my selfish desire to learn more about him that kept me around. I don't know what I saw in him, but for a while, it was nice. He approached me at a friend's party, I gotta say, around the summer of '99. He smelled good. *Really* good, like cedarwood and roses. He complimented me on my dress and my how I looked amazing in it. He looked at me with those soft, studying eyes. He was much more confident than most guys who approached me at bars or other parties, and I was quickly drawn into his romantic trap. We slept together that night. Looking back, I really don't know what I was thinking, but it took me by surprise how quickly my life changed afterward.

A year after we had been together, we moved into his apartment in South Austin. We lived there for another year. He never really cleaned up after himself, but he played the excuse that he was busy working all the time and was always tired when he returned home. We had a pretty rocky start, as most young couples do, and Austin was far more expensive than other, more suitable places in Texas. David always managed to barely scrape by at the last second when bills were due. After a while of realizing I would have to start working to help with rent, I began putting in job applications. As a 19-year-old college student, I could hardly afford any time to work, but I knew I could start somewhere as a part-time employee. Shouldn't be too hard.

David said he worked for his dad's construction company as the co-founder and that they had several employees, but this raised suspicion with me, as he began bringing home only around $600-750 every month, which was far less than minimum wage in 2003. His normal wage was about $2000 monthly, but he said that the company had to cut funding because of a boycott at the company.

One day, as I was sitting on the couch studying calculus in my school book, I felt curious and decided to pay David a visit. I don't know what got into me that day. Maybe curiosity got the better of me, but I was right to trust my gut. I made a batch of fudge brownies for him and his cohorts before I left the apartment. I drove downtown where he said he was working—"Colleen's Construction" down Pearce Lane past Austin. He said they named the business after their late mother, Colleen, who had passed away when David was a child.

I pulled into the construction site and found a muddy acre of land surrounded with engineer tape. There were several workers lollygagging around the perimeter of the site, smoking cigarettes and talking amongst themselves. I shyly approached the group of workers, batch of brownies in hand, and asked if David had clocked in for work that day. I said that he was the co-founder of the company, to which the group of workers all shot me blank looks of confusion, making me immediately blush in embarrassment.

"Wait, I'm sorry, you mean Colleen Thatcher? The old woman who lives in West Lake Hills in a big mansion with her kids?" one of them asked.

He asked if I was a friend of the owner's, to which I didn't know how to respond. I stared at the ground, blushing profusely, trying to escape the conversation somehow.

"I... I don't know. I'm sorry to have bothered you guys," I said.

The man in the front, holding a cup of coffee, looked at me with compassion and responded in a quiet, respectful tone. "Hey, look. If you want me to ask my boss if your boyfriend is here, I could gladly do that. But I don't think we know anyone named David. There's only about 15 of us on this whole site during the day, but the rest of 'em already clocked out early. We clock out at 8. Maybe I can visit the boss before I head out?"

I abruptly responded, "No, no, it's totally fine. I'm sure there's another site nearby I could look."

He apologized profusely and waved me goodbye as I turned to walk away. I stopped in my tracks for a moment before turning back around to ask, "Hey! You guys want some brownies?"

The workers stared down at the tray I was holding for a few seconds before two of them turned and made eye contact with one another.

"We would actually... fuckin' love some brownies right about now."

I walked back over with a big smile, and before I knew it, the tray was cleaned off. The workers thanked me wholeheartedly as I waved them goodbye.

"We love you!" one of the guys cheered loudly, as I let out a small chuckle.

I gave one last polite smile to the workers and entered my car as they waved me goodbye. I entered my car and couldn't help but stare down in confusion. Where the hell was David?

I began driving back to our apartment, but as I was parked at a stoplight, I flipped open my phone and stared at David's contact number. Wherever he was, I just wanted to know he wasn't spinning some tale or lying to me completely. I hesitated for a moment before pressing call. A few seconds of ringing went by, and he picked up the phone with that same exhausted tone in his voice, as if he were in the middle of a heavy project that need his attention"

"Hello?" David asked.

I sucked in a deep breath through my teeth and put on a fake smile to help shift my tone so I didn't sound worried. "Hey, baby. What time did you say you were getting back today?" I asked jovially.

David hesitated for a minute, and I could hear him tapping his finger on the back of his phone, as if searching for a cop-out response to my question.

"Uhmmm. Not sure yet. Me and the guys gotta remodel this kitchen, and it's looking like it'll be a big project. I might be home a little late tonight, but I'll do my best to get done quick so I'm not late for dinner."

I glanced down at my watch. It was already 8:05. I may be a little naive, but I'm smart enough to remember those construction workers saying they'd be clocked out of work by now.

I hesitated again, taking a heavy breath through my nose, trying to hold back tears as I collected myself once more to respond. "Alright. See you tonight." My voice quivered slightly. I thought David would notice my clearly worried disposition, but he just simply responded in that same rushed voice.

"Alright, baby. Gotta get back to work, but I'll see you tonight. Love you!"

I held the phone to my ear, his last words echoing in my mind. I hung up the phone without saying a word. I kept driving and sat my phone in my lap, those last words ringing in my ears: "I love you."

Without skipping a beat, he called me again. At this point, I was mildly upset. I flipped my phone open and pressed it to my ear.

"Hello?" I asked, keeping my voice as calm and collected as I could.

"You didn't say I love you back," he said.

I began frowning and tilted my head in confusion. A moment of silence passed between us before he said, IIII Loooove Youuuuu"

I took a heavy sigh through my nose and puffed out my chest. "David. I'm not playing this game with you."

David softly gasped, taken aback. He waited a moment before responding nervously. "Taylor?"

I retorted quickly, "I don't know where you are or what you're doing, but I know you're not at that construction site. So, where are you?"

Moments passed, and he didn't say a word. After giving him the floor for several seconds, he began to respond. "I-I don't... Taylor!"

I interrupted him before he could finish his thought. "I'm giving you 20 minutes to come home."

At this point, he began raising his voice. "Whoa! H-Hold on—"

I hung up before he could finish his thought. I wanted to feel a sense of pride in what I did, but I couldn't help but feel guilty about reprimanding David like that. After all, he could just need some alone time away from the house. It was getting late, so maybe I was just worried he'd be out until 12 a.m. again. I loved him and didn't want to see him upset, so I began to contemplate calling back and apologizing.

But this wasn't the first time he'd lied. This is a recurring problem that we never bring up, and now is the time. I shook off the feeling of regret quickly and pressed the gas pedal harder, banking a left to return home. I drove for what felt like an eternity, but I arrived home in as little as 10 minutes.

As I pulled into my apartment building, I didn’t notice David's black Volkswagen parked in the front, so I shut off my engine and sat in the car, waiting for him to return. It was dark, and all I could think about was, "Who is he with right now?" I quickly shook off the thought. A few minutes later, I saw his car pull into the parking lot of our old apartment complex. He was shuffling around, reaching over his passenger's seat. I didn't know what he was messing with, but he was clearly trying to hide something from me. I noticed he wasn’t sporting any type of neon vest or a hard hat, like the workers I spoke to at the construction site. He was just wearing his black "LA" cap and a black hoodie.

I got out of my car and began walking up to his car, hands at my sides and trembling. I had not prepared what I was going to say to him in advance, so only one question came to my mind. As he parked his car and swung the door open, walking over to meet me in the parking lot, the first thing I asked was, "What's in the glove compartment?"

David stopped in front of me, hands in his jacket pockets, lips curled up into a sarcastic half-smile. He pulled his arms out of his pockets and threw them up to his side. I folded my arms in contempt. We stared at each other for a few more moments before I folded my hands into fists and began marching over to his car.

David stepped in front of me and put his hands in front of me, cautious not to touch me. "Taylor. I just want to talk to y—"

I brushed past him quickly and approached his passenger's side door.

"Taylor, stop!" he began raising his voice, but I didn’t respond. I opened his door, and I was immediately blasted with the smell of weed. I knew David smoked, and I never had a problem with it, but it seemed unreasonable to believe he was smoking during work. I wouldn’t put it past him, though.

There was nothing in the passenger’s seat. David just stood back with his hands folded in his pockets. I could tell he wanted to say something, but he just stood there silently and took a deep breath, staring at me as I reached into his glove compartment. Inside were a bunch of registration papers, a birth certificate, and other things that he brought to the DMV when he leased the car.

"You see? What were you expecting to find, Taylor?"

I noticed a rolled-up sheet of paper tucked away in the back of the compartment. I unwrapped the paper, and inside revealed a small bag with a substance that looked like salt crystals. However, I knew it wasn’t that. I simply froze in disbelief. It wasn’t disbelief in what I saw, but it was disbelief in myself—that I would get myself in this kind of situation.

I gently placed the bag back where I found it and softly shut his car door, leaving my hand on his window.

"Construction, huh?" I asked sarcastically, but my voice was quivering too much to sound serious.

David didn’t move an inch and looked at me with a serious expression. "We need the money, Taylor," he said matter-of-factly, as he kept his hands tucked away in his pockets. "We’re already late on our lease, and we can hardly afford groceries. Taylor..."

He walked over and placed a gentle hand on my shoulder as I stared into the window of his car. "I fucking love you, ya know that?"

I threw my shoulder back, releasing his hand. Tears were streaming down my face by this point. I glanced back at him one last time.

"The lease is yours now, David," I said. I turned to walk back upstairs to our room. "I don’t want any more of your excuses."

David began marching towards me, shouting at this point. "What the fuck do you think you're doing, T?"

I was on the verge of sobbing. I felt so naive and gullible for ever trusting David with my feelings. He never shared anything about himself, but at this point, I knew everything I needed to know. David grabbed my shoulder before I reached the door.

"Don't fucking touch me!" I retorted.

David let go of my shoulder, and I opened the door. I stared in disgust and disbelief at the disheveled mess that I had left. No... that *we* had left. I couldn’t believe I was ever okay with living like this. David followed closely behind me as I walked over to our room and reached into our closet, pulling out a suitcase. David just sat and watched as I began emptying my dresser, tossing handfuls of clothing into the suitcase.

David grabbed my wrist with force as I was reaching into the dresser. "What the fuck are you doing, David?"

He jerked my hand back and began pulling me over to the other side of the room. He was a large man, so I couldn’t do anything but thrash and scream as he overpowered me. I punched him in the mouth and screamed for help. He lifted me up off my feet and shoved me onto our bed. I shut my eyes in terror for a few seconds and heard a distinct metallic click.

I slowly raised my eyes back up to meet David's. He raised his handgun at me and had a cold, blank expression across his face. I threw my hands over my face and began sobbing loudly, begging for help.

"Please stop, please, don't do this, no, no, please, just stop!"

David interrupted my loud pleading and waved his gun at me. "Alright, alright, just shut the fuck up!"

I stopped crying and began breathing heavily, keeping a guarding hand over my face. David shouted, "Who the fuck do you think paid for this bed? These sheets? The fucking food in the fridge? Me! I'm the one who does *everything* in this fucking place while you slouch around doing jack shit! And now I'm going to lose you for trying to make a living for us? Who the fuck do you think you are? Ungrateful bitch!"

David had tears welling up in his eyes. He sobbed and wiped the tears from his face before remorsefully saying, "I fucking loved you, T!"

David puffed out his chest and aimed the gun towards me. "Now, I'm gonna lose the one person I ever loved!" His voice lowered to a soft tremble as his upper lip quivered. He stared back at me with tears streaming down his face, sniffling.

I lowered my guard for a second before responding. "David. I-I'm so sorry. Please, put the gun down. We can talk about this."

David wiped the tears from his eyes. "What more is there to talk about?"

I sat up from the bed and crawled towards David. "We can start over. Find a different route. I... I don't know how we're gonna do it, but we always make it through *everything*. Me and you, David. We're not going anywhere."

I looked up to lock eyes with David. I expected some sense of warmth in his eyes or for him to lower his guard, but he just shot back a cocky grin as he put the muzzle to my head.

"Lies, lies, all these fucking lies! How the fuck do you sleep with yourself at night? You fucking disgust me! All this dribble, all this banter, and you're still just gonna fucking leave the second I walk out that door! No! We're done talk—"

Our conversation was suddenly interrupted by a loud crash in the living room. Apparently, in David's fit of rage, he didn't notice he had left the blinds open for the neighbors to see us. David quickly pointed his weapon at the door and began firing as he shuffled towards the closet. I could do nothing but roll out of the bed onto the ground, curling up, shutting my eyes, and screaming in horror as glass from the window shattered and bullets whizzed above my head.

Men from outside the window were shooting in. David took shelter in the closet, and I could see him staring in the direction of the window as he reloaded his magazine. He slowly turned his head to make eye contact with me, that same cocky grin stretched across his face. I widened my eyes in horror.

Suddenly, my vision was blinded, and my ears began ringing loudly as the sound of a loud bang flooded the walls of the room. I cupped my hands over my ears and screamed as loud as I could, but I could not hear my own screams over the deafening ring. I could hear muffled voices a few feet from me over the bed.

"Put the fucking gun down!" one of them shouted.

I squinted open my eyes and could make out three silhouettes surrounding the closet where David was holed up. As if the world itself had stopped, I looked at David once again. His curly hair flowed like a gentle breeze, and his eyes were kind and compassionate. He stared at me with an immense look of remorse, as if he were asking me for help. His hands were outstretched, above his head. Time seemed to move in slow motion.

One of the officers moved in to approach David, instructing him to stay calm. David gave me one last hopeless plea for help and jerked his head back towards the officer, swinging the muzzle of his handgun forward, closing his eyes. In an instant, David pulled the trigger. He shot the officer.

Loud bangs began to ring out across the room as David launched back towards the wall of the closet. I screamed in horror as an officer quickly rushed in to subdue David. The officer who had been shot was hunched over at the foot of the bed, wincing in pain as he held his chest. Another man rushed in to check on the officer.

"Are you hurt?" the man asked.

"He got my plates," the officer replied.

The man in the closet, subduing David, held his arm, checking David's pulse. "Response team to dispatch, suspect is down, needs immediate medical. One officer wounded, but responsive." He slowly glanced back at me. "One civilian responsive. How copy?"

His radio chimed back. "Response team, Medical is standing by. Clear house and let the paramedics in. Great work."

As I stared into the closet, I saw David. His eyes were wide open, staring at the ceiling, as he took short, labored breaths and he held his hand against his stomach. Blood soaked his hoodie as he grasped tighter. He stared back down at me, breathing quickly, as he stretched a sickening grin across his face. He raised his arm slowly and pointed his thumb and finger at me, mimicking a gun.

The officer who had been shot stood in front of me, blocking David's glare, as he extended a hand towards me.

"Are you okay, ma'am?" he asked.

I stared at him for a moment before taking his hand. He pulled me up to my feet and I stumbled forward, dizzy. He wrapped my arm around him as we began stumbling towards the living room. Behind me, I could hear David slowly gurgling.

"Don't... t-touch... her..."

I attempted to look back before the officer pulled me forward, towards the exit. "C'mon. Let's get you out of here."

As we stumbled out of the exit, the officer slowly let me go. I wobbled to my feet a bit, but I could stand on my own. The ringing in my ears did not subside as the officer spoke. His voice sounded robotic, as if speaking through a fan.

"I know you've seen a lot, but we're gonna make it up to you, okay? The medics downstairs are going to take good care of you. I'll walk you down," he said.

I looked down to see the paramedics rushing upstairs, carrying a stretcher. Neighbors peeked in through their blinds, watching through their windows. One woman next door opened her door to see what was going on. The officer yelled back at her, "Ma'am, could you please stay in your home?"

She gave me a hesitant, frightful look before ducking back into her apartment. I then realized that david had shot through our living room, right through the wall where the woman lived. Even in my predicament, I couldn't help but feel sorry for the woman. The officer placed a gentle hand on the small of my back as he guided me downstairs toward the ambulance that was waiting for me.

The paramedic shouted from the back of the ambulance. "Hey, Ramirez! You get shot?"

Officer Ramirez waved his hand dismissively before shouting back, "Nah, I'm good! But she needs medical attention!"

The paramedic yelled from the ambulance. "Like hell you're good! Get'cher ass in here! *Now!*"

Officer Ramirez shot me a sarcastic grin, as to say, "this guy over here," before helping me up into the ambulance and climbing in behind me. The medics checked my vitals, eyes, and ears to make sure I wasn't hurt. They asked me a bunch of questions and soon told me they were taking me to the hospital nearby.

I shot them a worried expression. "Don't worry," one of the medics said. "You don't gotta pay for the ambulance."

The medic shot a look toward Ramirez. "This is coming out of your paycheck though."

Ramirez rolled his eyes and jeered. "Ah, fuck off, man."

Hearing the back-and-forth banter, I managed to let out a pained chuckle. As we pulled into the hospital, my mom and dad were both waiting outside the emergency room entrance. They were both visibly crying and rushed in quickly to embrace me, both kissing me on the forehead and cradling me tight.

"My girl, my baby girl," Dad said, sobbing through his words.

The medics asked them to move aside and walked me into the building. Mom and Dad followed closely behind. I was met with two doctors, who instructed me that they were going to perform some tests to make sure I was safe and unharmed. They walked me into a room with a padded bed with a long sheet of blue paper draped over the top. They asked me a few questions about how I felt, asked if I had any pain, and told me they'd be back in a few minutes before exiting the room, leaving me, my mom, and my dad.

My dad sat up straight in his chair with his fists clenching his jeans. His jaw cocked to the side and he had a vengeful glare in his eyes. My mother tried asking me what happened in the apartment, but I knew telling them would make my situation worse. She eventually stopped asking questions and just sat next to me, hugging me tight and stroking my disheveled hair, telling me that everything would be okay.

After half an hour, a beautiful, skinny nurse with blonde hair tied into a bun peeked into the room and asked if it was okay if she could collect a sample from me. Hesitating, I nodded my head. I got up and followed the nurse into a bathroom across the hall, where I collected the sample and left it on a small labeled shelf inside the bathroom.

As I opened the door, the nurse greeted me with a gleaming smile, standing on her tippy toes with her hands behind her back. "This way, please." She guided me back to the room where I could hear my dad yelling at the top of his lungs. "He better hope he's fucking dead!"

I peeked into the room through the closed, opaque glass door and saw the silhouette of my dad, pacing back and forth in the room, arms flailing as he screamed. "What he did to my daughter... No! I'm gonna fucking--" I saw my mom place her hands on his back, urging him to calm down.

I looked over past my room and saw what looked to be 2 tall, Hispanic men in black hoodies, staring from across the hall, around a corner. They weren't staring at what was happening in the room, but instead, made eye contact with me. They noticed me looking back at them and they slowly turned back and disappeared around the corner.

Was I imagining things? Were those men looking at me? I quickly brushed off those thoughts and rushed in to meet my dad. My mom was trying desperately to calm him as he turned around and saw me.

"Dad. Please."

He heaved heavily for a few moments before I heard a man's voice behind me. "Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to lower your voice. There are other patients here."

I turned around to see my doctor in a white lab coat with a security guard peeking from behind his shoulder. My dad was hunched over, breathing heavy, furious breaths, as he eyed the doctor. Dad stood up straight, took a deep heavy breath, and cleared his throat.

"Right... Right. Sorry."

The guard left the room, and the doctor respectfully explained that the nurse would be back in five minutes. I sat down on the bed next to my mom as my dad sat in the back of the room on a chair. He clenched his jeans again and sat in silence.

A few minutes went by, and the nurse peeked in from the door, apologizing for intruding. She was visibly shaken, but asked me to have a conversation with her outside of the room. I looked back at my dad, who had relaxed his arms. "It's okay, sweetie." He nodded, and we stepped out into the hallway.

The nurse looked down at the floor. She had a nervous grin, but I could tell she was trying to maintain her composure. She took a deep breath through her nose and looked at me.

"Ms. Welch," she said in a serious tone. "Your lab results are still pending, but we have some news about the urine sample you provided for us."

I hesitated and awaited her next words. She reached around and grabbed my hand, placing a small sheet of paper in my palm. I hurredly glanced through the page, and stumbled across 3 words that shook me to my core.

"Pregnancy test: Positive"
