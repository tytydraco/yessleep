When I was young I owned a swing. It hung from a tall tree in my backyard and every night I’d rock back and forth on it, thinking about life. It was peaceful. The fresh cool air felt great through my hair. The sounds of the woods were calming. 

Then one night I go out there to see a raven standing on the swing. I thought it was odd at first, because it was probably around nine o’clock at night and most birds are asleep by then. But it only got stranger. As I neared the raven it didn’t move at all. It looked like it could have been a Halloween decoration. I thought that might have been what it was for a moment, and slowly I reached my hand forward until I was just about to touch the bird when I felt the rough texture of the rope. Confused, I went back to touch the raven again, and again my hand felt no feathers, only the cool air. I made a flurry of more aggressive attempts but none of them brought any success. The bird had not moved. I began to ponder how such a thing could be possible. I thought that I could possibly be hallucinating from being too tired. So I went to sleep.

The next day I had forgotten about the raven. Call me foolish all you’d like, but I had more pressing matters at the time. My day at school went as it usually did. My only feelings felt throughout the day were boredom and loneliness. I took a shower and before I went to sleep I decided to go back to the swing. There I saw the raven, and everything came rushing back to me. Immediately I made an attempt to touch the bird and as expected I made no contact with it. In my less tired state I was able to devise more methods of making contact with the anomalous feathered creature. I grabbed a stick from the forest floor and swung at the raven. I heard wood hit wood and the stick snapped in half, the bird entirely still.

I then tried to lay back first onto the swing. As you could imagine, this only caused me to fall onto the forest floor, stabbing my back on the pinecones. By now I was terrified so I did what any terrified kid would do and told my parents about it. They went outside and inspected the swing. They concluded that the raven was not a raven, but in fact a rock. My mother then picked up the raven and showed it to me. This entire time the raven did not move an inch. It never blinked, it never reacted in the slightest. But it was definitely a raven. I tried to grab it but ended up grabbing my mother’s arm instead. I went back to bed and slept another night. I couldn’t focus in school that day. All I could think about was the raven. I simply had no idea what I could possibly do with it. Books tell you about monsters, ghosts, zombies and creatures of the deep. But they do not tell you about ravens capable of the impossible.

After school that day I went straight back to the swing. The raven was sitting on its perch seeming to mock me. I asked it something along the lines of “What do you want with me?”   The bird of course did not answer. I flipped the seat over. I shook it around. I attacked it as furiously as I could. But the raven stayed. I could barely sleep that night. The next day at school I entirely gave up on my studies and spent the whole day thinking about the bird. What it was, what it wanted, how to make it leave. I couldn’t think of anything in all of those hours. I came home furious at the bird and screamed at it. Once again I tried to violently tear it off, and again nothing came of my attempts. I took a shower and got into bed but I didn’t sleep. All I could think about was the bird.

This cycle repeated for months. I could barely get any sleep, my grades plummeted, and my behavior worsened significantly. Everyday the bird sat there on the swing seeming to mock me. Eventually we moved due to unrelated reasons, and everything eventually went back to normal. But I know that if I ever went back to that house, the raven would still be on that swing waiting for me. No matter what, I just know. That thing tortured me and it will never leave.
