When my grandfather got divorced, he didn't take it well, and after all the court proceedings were done and everything had been finalized, he just stayed alone in his house for months. I don't think being alone in a big house was good for him, though; I mean, I don't think it's good for anyone really. I've always preferred smaller houses; the big ones felt like museums or hotels. They gave me the feeling that I really shouldn’t stay too long. I guess grandpa realized that too because after a few months he moved to a double-wide flat on his property and let the big house go to shit. It stayed like that, just rotting and growing, for almost 20 years. 
 

When my dad started talking about going out to Grandpa's to clean up the big house I, of course, wanted to go with him. Being a 9-year-old in northern Appalachia, I was always kind of outdoorsy and Grandpa's house was in the middle of a beautiful forest that stretched for miles in every direction. I remember at night I would look up at the stars and make telescopes with my hands and try to see heaven. I never did, but that sky was pretty close.
 

In hindsight, I don't really know why my dad let me come with him; it's not the best idea to bring a kid into a 100-year-old collapsing house with hermit trash and several strands of hitherto undiscovered bacteria, but despite that, I ended up right behind him as we walked in the front door. 


The first thing I noticed was the smell, a primordial funk that had fermented and distilled for 20 years. At the time, I thought it smelled like teargas, but I was 9, and I didn't know what teargas smelled like. The second thing I noticed was the unrealistic amount of trash; even at 9, I thought it was way too much for Grandpa to have accumulated in his months as a shut-in, but either way, we started to go through room by room and get an idea of what we were dealing with. 
 

Now you know how sometimes if you're walking with another person and your footsteps are just out of sync enough, it can sound like there's an extra pair of footsteps? I remember having that feeling as we walked out of the living room into the kitchen, but I just brushed it off because it was a big house and we had a lot of ground to cover. When we finished our tour of the ground floor, we headed to the second floor.  I remember my dad pausing for a little too long when he got upstairs; the only reason I remember that was because I got annoyed waiting behind him, and I was anxious to see more of the creepy old house. He muttered something under his breath, then walked in.
 

The second floor was much cleaner than the first, and it was much more open with the stairs leading into a large central living room and one hallway with 2 bedrooms on either side. Those didn't matter to me, though, because in the corner of the living room there was a bed—well, kind of a bed. It was 6 mismatched couch cushions arranged in a rectangle, and I remember it reminded me of something I'd make for a pillow fort, which I thought was awesome, but next to it was an old Coleman grill, a pot, a few cans of chili, and a few cans of beans. My dad said, “I thought no one lived here,” and I remember thinking it was dumb because obviously no one lived here; Grandpa already said that. But either way, all of the stuff looked like it hadn’t been used in a while, so I guess my dad assumed the owner of the pillow fort bed was gone.
 

We finished checking out the second floor, and I was heading for the third when my dad sternly informed me it was a bad idea as the floor had already collapsed in several places, and if i went up there it was my fault if i died. I had been looking forward to the third floor and was disappointed that it would have to wait, but I did what I was told and went downstairs. The trash wasn't actually that bad downstairs, mostly just weeds and old food cans, but it still took us well into twilight before we only had some big stuff left and decided to start on the upstairs. We didn't get very far into it before we realized it was much darker on the second floor and we'd better wait till tomorrow. But part of me still wanted to see that third floor. You can imagine my confusion when I saw my dad standing at the top step. His lower half barely visible in the fleeting moonlight. I started up the stairs after him, but I stopped for a second because I heard my dad open the door to leave downstairs, and when I looked back to the top step, there was nothing there. 
 

I was terrified, and I ran downstairs out of the house to my dad and fell down the porch stairs trying to put as much distance between me and the house as possible. But when i got up  I started to laugh a little bit; I couldn't believe how dumb I had been. So scared of what must’ve been just a trick of the light. “There was no one in that house, Grandpa said, so I must’ve imagined it” i thought to myself. And when my dad asked me what was wrong, I told him I just wanted to race him to the flat.
 

The flat only had one bedroom, so I had to sleep on a futon in the living room with my dad. I didn't mind it, but I kept waking up that night, which was weird because I was a heavy sleeper, and I only really woke up if my dog got stuck in my room and started scratching at my door. But eventually I was able to wade off into a peaceful sleep, excited to go back to the house in the morning. 
 

The next morning I woke up to my dad and grandpa talking about something in the kitchen, and I figured out what they were discussing very quickly. The window I had been sleeping next to was covered in deep scratches like an animal was trying to dig its way through the glass. They were wondering what kind of animal it could have been, but they only had coyotes and hogs out there, nothing that would’ve done that kind of damage to the window. And when my grandpa went to check the footage on his security camera, they both went quiet. They wouldn't show me what it was, but they said we had to drive back home, and Grandpa would stay with us for a little while. 
 

This was the worst news in the world to me. I was so excited to get back into the big house and see the third floor. I probably wasn’t even going to get to go up there either way, the floor didn't just fix itself magically overnight, but still I had made it out to be some grand new frontier, and when we drove past the big house, I waved goodbye from the backseat, and through the third-floor window, the house waved back to me.
