They say, “Grief is the price you pay for love.”  
They say, “Grief is love with no place to go.”  
They say a lot of wildly unhelpful bullshit.  
None of it helps when it’s 3 a.m. and the walls are closing in.

When I was pregnant with my first, my mother in law said, “You’ll never sleep again.” Her tone exuding more joy than pity. Turns out the bitch was right. Only, I slept great when I had a newborn. It was only *after* she turned ten that my real sleep issues began. 

If grief is the price you pay for love, I’ll counter that with, ‘Insomnia is the price you pay for grief.’ Every night I toss and turn like the princess and the pea. But, in my case, the pea isn’t some hidden vegetable causing a lump in my mattress, it’s the mounding self-hatred for what I’ve done, or what I failed to do, that keeps me up at night. 

Grief being “love with no place to go?” Now that takes flippant stupidity to a whole new level. Grief has plenty of places it likes to show up. In the checkout line at the grocery store when you’re buying Super Plus tampons. When a telemarketer calls asking if you’d like the chance to win a free trip to Disneyland. Or in the crick of your neck as you wiggle into a sports bra for a spin class that you’ll sob the whole way through. 

Grief will follow you anywhere and everywhere. Even to Montecito. 

Count the sheep, all the money in your bank account, the number of lovers you’ve had.

Buy the $20K Ralph Lauren Brook Street bed.

Chase a tiny blue Trazadone with a half a bottle of Sav Blanc. 

You still end up staring at the clock all night. Tick. Tick. Tick. **SPASH**!

Because you can’t sleep if you don’t have a clear conscience. 

The houses here look like Nancy Myers sets. And the women look like Gwyneth Paltrow Fuck, the women ARE Gwyneth Paltrow. Leaning over the hedge from her backyard to yours for the occasional borrowed lemon. 

Everything here smells like jasmine, everything sounds like the sea. But behind the stucco walls, the air reeks of guilt. And secrets seeping through like damp rot. 

I should know. I buried three friends in less than a year.

And buried my son the year before that.

That’s a hell of a lot of rot.

**The Drowning**

My name is Reese. Before Montecito, I worked as a chef in Beijing with my husband, Jacob, and our two children. My son, Sammy, was six. My daughter, Mandy, ten.

They say, “*Life happens when you’re busy making other plans*.”

But really, life happens when you’re busy looking the other way. Sammy was splashing in the rooftop pool while Mandy, her arm still in a cast from last month’s break, sat at the edge brushing her doll’s hair with her one good arm. 

“Stop splashing me! I can’t get my cast wet!” Ever since she turned ten, Mandy had become very serious. Things, like a splash of pool water, had never bothered her before. Now everything Sammy did was a total and utter annoyance. I told Mandy to keep an eye on Sammy while I ran downstairs to check on the cake I was baking to celebrate him turning six. Mandy promised they’d stay at the edge of the pool until I got back. And I chose to believe her.

*But kids don’t always do what they say they will*. 

When I returned with the cake, I saw Mandy first. Kneeling next to the pool. Panic twisting her not-so-cherub face. Sammy was floating face down in his purple swim trunks. Like a discarded toy. I don’t remember anything after that, only what they told me later. I had dived in to pull him out and nearly broken my neck. 

I was shocked back into reality by the touch of the cold stiff body I was left holding in my arms. I thought, “If I hold him tight enough, if I warm him up, then I can bring him back.”

But he was already gone by then.

And Mandy… my daughter just kneeled there. Watching. She’d tried to pull him up but she said he was too heavy. She just kept repeating, “Dad said not to get my cast wet.” No ten year old could’ve lifted him using only one arm\*. But was she really so afraid of her father that she refused to save her baby brother?\*

After the funeral, Jacob left us. Did you know that 80% of couples who lose a child divorce? I read that somewhere. Or maybe I made it up so that I would feel less alone.

Living in our condo after Sammy and Jacob were gone all I could see was gray. 

Gray sky. 

Gray appliances. 

Gray people.

Gray life.

So we left. I told Mandy we needed to “start over.” Bought us one-way tickets to LAX and rode the air bus up to Montecito which only took an hour and a half. I’d read about Montecito in a magazine. It’s called the American Riviera because it’s like living in the south of France. Without the language barrier and the slow bureaucracy. 

“Unincorporated. Only one stop light in town. Montecito doesn’t even have its own police department.” Some people would consider that a downside. But I knew it was exactly what Mandy and I needed.

Arriving in Montecito the world felt different. Everything was now in technicolor. Like landing in Oz after the tornado. I no longer saw gray. It was blue, and green, and…purple.

I met Shari first. She was walking past our bougainvillea vined fence with the perfectly styled cunty little bob. 4 karat diamond studs holding it behind her ear. 

“I’m so happy you moved in! Now I won’t have to see that Ugly-Devil-Gerby-Baby on my walks anymore.” I glanced around for a child before realizing she meant the stone angel statue the movers were setting in the garden. The former owners had asked if I wanted to keep it but after Shari’s harsh verdict I told the movers to haul it off immediately.

Shari asked me to join “the girls” at the Coral Casino for brunch. I turned her down politely saying I needed to stay and help the movers. “Worried they’ll steal? Watch them on your ring.”  I gave an apologetic smile to the men who’d obviously overheard. “Bethica’s daughter is your daughters age! Shellian’s a great “in” if your daughter plans on having any kind of social life.” If anyone needed an “in” it was Mandy. Before Sammy’s accident she was noticeably shy but after, she seemed almost translucent. 

I told Shari I’d see them at the Coral at ten and rushed in the house to tell Mandy. As I walked up the stairs, I heard muffled voices from behind Mandy’s closed door. “I know I should but I don’t think she would understand. She doesn’t get it!” 

*What wouldn’t I get?*

I quickly opened her door. Mandy was sitting in front of her vanity applying a wing tip liner to her eyes. She looked up, surprised to see me. “Who were you talking to?”

“Huh?” She blinked back her confusion leaving black ink in the creases of her eyes.

I knew I had to tread lightly, “You weren’t talking to dad, were you?”

“*Why* *would I be talking to dad*?”

I looked at her face for signs that she was lying but with Mandy there were no ‘tells.’ Not like Sammy who pulled at his lip anytime he tried to fib.

“Do you want a sandwich before I head out?” I sat down on the bed, straightening imaginary creases on her comforter. “I’m meeting some women in town for brunch. One has a daughter in your class. A potential new friend!”

Mandy looked skeptical. “She’s probably some stuck up bitch.”

“Mandy, you gotta be open! This is a chance to start over. Aren’t you ready to be happy again?” Mandy didn’t answer. But her face seemed to say, “Happy? What’s that?”

“Nana used to say, “If you perform the life you want well enough, eventually that’ll be your life. Whether it’s true or not.” Mandy groaned, “What’s that even mean?”

I tried to sound cheerier than I felt, “Fake it till you make it! One day, you won’t have to fake it anymore.” Mandy smirked, “Fake being happy. Got it.”

Before I could object to her twisting my words, a LOUD BANG rattled the front door. I hurried down the stairs, my feet slipping on the damp steps. “Mandy, why are the stairs wet?!” Before she could answer before the front door creaked open on its own. “Knock knock!” A mousy haired woman entered carrying a tray of muffins on a Dixie plate. She looked like the Temu version of Shari. More Old Navy than Chloe. 

“Aunt Annie’s Roadkill Muffins. Apple walnut oat. I made a batch for the church last week and froze them. Figured I had to bring something if I was going to come introduce myself. I’m Karen.” Karen had the kind of voice that instantly makes you feel claustrophobic. Like you should start planning an exit strategy. Unfortunately, I was in my own home. I eyed the muffins. Yep, they were definitely a week old. She called it a welcoming gift but it was really a cover. Karen wanted the scoop on Mandy and me for the paper. “You write for the LA Times?” I asked.  

Karen looked embarrassed. “The Montecito Journal. It’s a free paper. Comes out Thursdays. You can find one outside of the coffee shop in town.” Karen didn’t get paid for her writing but that didn’t matter. It gave her access into other people’s lives that she was unable to get through true friendships. “I’d love to do a writeup on your family. Is it just you and your daughter or….?” She let the question hang there like she had already gone through my mail and knew that Jacob was no longer in our lives.

I had to get her out of my house before Mandy heard her ask anything else, “I’m so sorry I’d love to talk but I’m heading out to brunch. With Bethica Mandeville.”

“Wow. You’ve been here 24 hours and Bethica’s already let you into her little group? I’ve lived here my whole life and those women have only said five words to me.” I waited. Karen counted on her fingers as she spoke, “No. We. Don’t. Have. Room.”

**BEIGE IS THE NEW BLACK**

I met Shari at the valet. Poppy arrived in beige, matching her tan Range Rover. Bethica wore a cream scarf with her cream Rivian. The women in town seemed to be in some sort of unspoken contest as to who could appear coldest in 74 degree weather.

The Coral Casino, like most things in Montecito, wasn’t what it seemed. Not a casino at all but instead a prestigious beach club that wouldn’t get you in without a $250,000 membership or an invite from someone willing to pay your guest fee. When the Waiter passed us our menus, Bethica turned him away, “Breakfast is for children and fat people.” I chewed on the rind of my lemon hoping to silence my growing hunger.

Poppy, an ex-soap star from “The Sun Also Rises,” was glamourous, magnetic, and obsessed with social media. An ex addict, “Rehab. Threepeat offender” who still slipped mushrooms in her smoothies for “therapeutic purposes.” She cared more about her follower count numbers than the amount of friends she had in the room. She promised to “help me rebrand” my life.

Bethica was harder to read. The self-proclaimed “First lady of real estate in Montecito.” She knew everything about everyone in town. “Marital status, credit score, drug of choice.”  The power she wielded lied in the unspoken knowledge that she could tell someone how much you have in your savings account after too much wine at a PTA meeting. Bethica had sharp eyes which she closed when she spoke as if speaking to others was utterly exhausting. She asked questions she already knew the answers to just to see if you would tell her the truth. 

Half way through my second glass of wine, a woman in her 60s walked into the club. Everyone turned to look. Muffled whispers spread throughout the room. “What’s she doing here? I thought she was moving?” The air in the room had changed. *What made her so special?* “Who’s that? The richest woman in town or something?”

“More like the saddest.” Shari answered. 

“Her daughter Sophie died in the 2018 mudslide.” Poppy said, her eyes welling up Soap Opera style. Bethica was less sympathetic. “Caroline Collins. Before the mudslide she was a social pariah. Cheated on her husband, Kyle, who everyone adored. He divorced her. He kept the house and their social circle.”

After Sophie died, Caroline became the ethereal symbol of anguish in Montecito. The mud wiped away her house *and* her social debts. Caroline shot Bethica a look so full of hatred I had to wonder if she had lipread what Bethica said. Bethica returned her stare with a self-satisfied smirk. “Careful, honey. Wealth whispers.” But Caroline didn’t look afraid of Bethica. She looked angry.

Bethica turned her attention back to me. She seemed unimpressed with my job *and* lack of alimony. “Being a personal chef is basically 21^(h) Century slavery.” Then she got to the question I knew she’d wanted to ask before the waiter had even pulled out my chair. “So, why’d you ditch the ex in China to move to Mayberry with money?””

I glanced at Caroline, thinking about the pseudo-sympathy they’d offered knowing her trauma. I thought of Mandy, and how badly she needed a friend, how much I wanted her to be happy, and I knew it was time to tell them about Sammy. 

About Mandy’s survivor’s guilt…. 

Aaaannd…about the new cookbook I was writing. “Turning Grief to Gourmet!” 

And with that, I’d done it. I’d sealed my place within the elite friend group. My grief story became my ticket into their hearts. And my ambition to overcoming that grief would become my redemption arc. 

**HILTON**

And what better way to round out that arc than with a new love interest? We bumped into Hilton on his way into the club for a game of pickleball. He was wearing head-to-toe James Perse and a casual smile. “Impossible. You girls let in a fourth? I thought there was only- (kissing Shari hello) Earth- (pointing at Poppy) Wind- (pointing at Bethica) and fire. I guess that makes you water.”

“That’s a compound.” I said. *I mean, I was pretty sure it was*. I was trying my best to show that I could keep up with his wit. I hadn’t been properly flirted with in ages.

Hilton bounced the proverbial wit right back to me. “Much more complicated than the other elements. You mustbe special. Bethica wouldn’t let Poppy in til she won Dancing with the Stars.” Hilton offered me a ride home after Shari said she had to get on a call with the “Dutchess of Difficult.” She gave me a wink and leaned in, “Go for it. He’s in the 1% of the dating pool here. Montecito’s full of the newly wed and nearly dead. He’s neither.” 

I slammed the door to his Jaguar as Caroline Collins walked out. Seeing me with Hilton, she sent me a silent plea with her eyes, “Use caution.” I chose to ignore the warning. Hilton was handsome, charming, and (let’s face it) I hadn’t been laid since before Sammy died. Besides, the kind of sex that Jacob and I had wasn’t exactly the kind a woman misses. I had a feeling many, many, women missed Hilton. 

We drove with the top down as he pointed out the sights. Hilton was a self-proclaimed “Cito Rat.” Born and raised in Montecito, he had grown up on the wrong side of the tracks but worked his way to the “right side” through contractor work on the multi-million dollar houses being sold every other hour in town. “I do Bethica’s dirty work fixing up the houses that she then sells for three times what they were worth before.” 

He was also her ex-husband. 

**Death #1: Karen**

The morning Karen died, she had called me to rat out Mandy. “I saw her riding on the back of Shellian’s purplee-bike! And she wasn’t wearing a helmet!” Karen said she’d done a write-up in the paper a couple weeks earlier about the dangers of e-bikes. “No one’s going to listen me until someone ends up dead!”

When Shellian picked Mandy up that morning for school, I made her swear not to ride on the bike. Shellian seemed embarrassed on behalf of Mandy saying, “No e-bike, we get it.” She walked it next to Mandy as they headed down the driveway. 

But, like I said before, *kids don’t always do what they say they’ll do*.

After Karen’s urgent call, I’d driven straight to the school. I found Shellian’s e-bike parked near the front lot. After taking a quick look around, I wrestled it into the back of my car for safe keeping. It’d only be until I was sure the girls would listen to me. 

*I had to protect Mandy*. 

Karen came up to my car window in the school pick up line and shoved a notecard with her Aunt’s recipe into my hand. “It’s for your grief cookbook!” I accepted it with a sigh. The muffins had been shit. Just like everything else Karen touched. 

I didn’t have time to cover the bike. *Had she seen it*?

Then she started in about Sammy’s death. Saying it was important for her story. “It will give it heart, open up doors to new friendships.” I told her I had enough friends and to, “Leave it alone. We came here for a fresh start, not to dwell on the past.”

Mandy got into the car as Karen was giving me a funny look and saying, “*Dwell* on your son’s death? That’s a funny way to put it.”

Just hearing her brother’s name said aloud Mandy turned an angry shade of red that frightened me. “Listen you fucking snoop-“ I rolled up the window before Mandy could finish. Later that night I received a text from Karen asking for me to join her at Douglas bluffs for wine at sunset. “We don’t even have to talk about *you know what*.” She texted and texted all night. I hit “ignore” on her final call to me.

Karen’s body was found at the bottom of the bluffs the next morning. Shellian’s purple e-bike lying on top of her crumpled body. A tube sock shoved deep inside her mouth. A symbol. Someone wanted her to stop talking and whoever it was knew that the e-bike was in my car. They called it a drunken accident even though it was clear she’d been murdered. Montecito likes to keep its tragedies clean. 

Housing prices go *down* when crime goes *up*.

**DR PILL PUSHER**

Like I said. I couldn’t sleep. And my neck was getting worse and worse. Bethica gave me the number of a guy she called Dr. Pill Pusher. “He refills Shellian’s Adderall prescription on an endless loop. “I put her on it at 8- to keep her weight down. He’ll give you whatever you want. No questions asked.” 

Dr Pill Pusher looked like he should have retired years ago. He immediately offered me unlimited refills of Percocet and a number to support meetings for grieving parents. He thought that my neck pain was tied to the emotional trauma of losing Sammy.

That night I popped two pills, hoping to sleep through the night, but woke at 2 a.m. with racing thoughts. *What happened to Karen*? *How did whoever killed her get Shellian’s bike from my car*? *Should we be scared?*

I stared out the kitchen window, drinking glass after glass of water. Fill it, drink it, fill it, drink it. My reflection stared back. *Why couldn’t I sleep? I barely liked Karen why would I grieve her*? Then my reflection shifted. Bloated, bruised, and unmistakably…

**Karen**. Her eyes pleaded, “*What happened to me*?” I tried to blink her away but it didn’t work. She raised a finger pointing at me. Or *behind* me.

A small voice whispered, “What are you doing?” I jumped out of my skin. Dropping my water glass on the floor and shattering it into hundreds of tiny, shards of translucent glass.  Mandy stood behind me. A look of worry mixed with irritation on her face.  “The pills I got for my neck. They’re making me thirsty.” Mandy stared at me a moment then turned on her socked heels to go upstairs. “You didn’t take Shellian’s bike out the other night, did you? To try and sneak it back to her?”

Mandy’s eyes turned dark. “No, mom. *I* didn’t.”

**SAD MEETINGS FOR SAD PEOPLE**

I walked into the grief meeting at All Saints By the Sea and took a seat. Hoping no one would notice me. The parents around me shared the same empty posture. Like a bunch of deflated balloons who lost all of their air the day that they buried their child.

Fred was mid-share. He’d lost his adult daughter to suicide. “She was in pain. Pain that I wasn’t equipped to fix. Dads can fix a lot of things. But I couldn’t fix the hole in her heart.”  Caroline Collins popped a cough drop into her mouth angrily, “Ill-equipped. What an eloquent way to say that we failed.”

The group leader was a rich pseudo-hippy named Tabitha who wore flare Paige jeans and stacked jewelry that cost more than my first car.  “Caroline, how do you feel that you failed?” 

Caroline shifted in her seat, irritated. Maybe it wsa the shitty folding chair she was stuck sitting in, or maybe it was just at life. “Sophie and I went to bed January 9th knowing that rain was coming. But we had no idea that we were living in a house that would be nothing but a floating piece of scrap wood by daylight.” 

There were some knowing nods on either side of me. Obviously having lived through the Thomas Fire and mudslides that followed when it hit Montecito. “We locked eyes and she said, “Mom, what do we do?” And all I could say was, ‘Hold on.’ And she did. We got pulled into the creek clasping one another’s hands. But the current was stronger than us. I got tangled into a tree. Nearly tore off my arm. But Sophie kept going. She was found in the surf by the bluffs. Cold, broken, alone.”

Tears fell from my face. It took everything in my power not to break down into heavy ugly sobs. I imagined Sophie in the sand of the bluffs. Hand outstretched reaching for her mother. Like a lost little girl. But slowly her face dissolved into Karen’s. The purple e-bike lying on top of her. Sock shoved deep in her mouth.

Another woman, Amy, interrupted my train of thought.  “I’d a never  bought a house on a creek. Too noisy.”  Amy had decided she qualified for grief meetings when her son decided he couldn’t have a relationship with a mother who’d voted for Trump. “He’s dead to me now.” Her total lack of empathy was probably the bigger factor in her gay son cutting ties with Amy. But it was easier for her to blame her politics.

Caroline wrang her hands angrily. “You’re right, Amy. I never should’ve bought a house on the creek. But the person who sold me the house knew it wasn’t built to withhold years on that land. But they happily took my money. I would’ve done anything to protect Sophie. But I couldn’t. Not from them.”

*Them*? Them who?

Tabitha interrupted my thoughts. “Newbie, would you like to share?” I  didn’t. I actually wanted to run from the room. Separating myself from being clumped into this angry, sad, depressing group of people. But I stayed, rolling my neck (fuck it was hurting) and speaking with a shaky voice that I almost didn’t recognize. “I’m Reese. A year ago, I lost my son. Sammy. He was six. It was a swimming accident. He drowned, he dry-drowned, holding his breath. My daughter, Mandy, jumped in to save him but he was too heavy. I jumped in. Almost broke my neck.” 

Caroline rubbed her arm, remembering her own pain trying to save Sophie. “I kept thinking, *If I get him warm, if I dry him off, he’ll be okay.* They took his body away, and I held my daughter. All I could think was, *She’s so dry, so warm… and he’s so cold. Why can’t he be warm like Mandy?* I don’t know why, but that thought just stuck with me.”

A strange look came over Caroline’s face. Something about my story wasn’t sitting right. She waited until the end of the meeting to approach me. “Be careful of who you trust your stories with around here. Some people may use them against you.”

She walked out before I could ask her who she meant.

**SEX AND SECRETS**

The girls had decided to throw a gala to bring awareness to “Dry-drowning.” The official ‘cause of death’ listed on Sammy’s autopsy. “Nobody knows what the fuck dry drowning is. I had to google it.” Bethica lamented. They had agreed to call the foundation “Sammy’s Smile.” The gala would go hand in hand with the release of my cookbook, Grief to Gourmet.

Mandy called it ‘Grief Porn.” She asked how I could agree to this type of public exposure. “Didn’t we come here to get away from dad? If he finds out---"

“He won’t find out.” Mandy had seen how Jacob reacted when Sammy’s drowned. How angry he was at her. How angry he was at me. She had every reason to be afraid.

Hilton invited me to come check out his house so I could see the space we’d be using for the gala. Or at least that was the official reason I was asked to come.

He walked me across the sweeping expanse of his impossibly green lawn, past his Schumacher wallpaper lined library, and into his media room- complete with a concession stand. He put on The Graduate and, as I reclined in the red velvet theater chair, I knew I wasn’t leaving without climbing onto his lap to fuck him first.

After a rinse off in the double headed shower, I walked ahead of him, towel-drying my hair, he suddenly screamed out, “Reese, Stop!”

I almost laughed, thinking he was joking, until I saw a gaping hole less than a foot in front of me. It was covered by a clear plastic tarp. “You’re standing over the atrium. A glass ceiling. It’s not finished!” He coaxed me back to him with an outreached hand just as a door  below us slammed. “Hil? Hellllo?!” a shrill voice called up the stairs.

“Bethica! What’s she doing here at ten o’clock at night?” The last person I wanted to have to do the walk of shame in front of was Bethica. An ex is an ex no matter how superficially cordial of an act they put on.

“She had some contracts she wanted me to look over. I had no idea she’d want those done tonight.” I searched his eyes, was he telling the truth? Or could it be the ‘cordial act’ they put on was *more* than cordial? 

“Is there another way out? Bethica’s the last person I want to see right now.” Hilton ushered me to the back staircase and gave me quick kiss before walking down the hallway to the front stairs. When I heard him get to the landing Bethica sighed dramatically, “There you are! I brought those contracts for you to go over.” 

I felt a sense of relief. He had been telling the truth. “I was in the shower.” I peeked from my spot at the bottom of the stairs and saw them standing in the kitchen. Bethica was ruffling his wet hair flirtatiously. “I can see that.” I felt a pang of jealousy. Yuck. I quietly opened the  backdoor when Bethica said something that stopped me dead in my tracks. “Caroline Collins is breathing down my neck again.” I leaned in. Caroline? 

Hilton whispered urgently, “So just give her whatever she’s asking!” I quickly realized the only reason he would whisper like that is if he thought I may still be in the house. He was afraid of what I’d hear. Bethica snorted, “She’s asking for a public apology.“ 

There was a long pause then Hilton asked, “Are you ready to give her that?”

“Are *you*? I thought all the lawsuit B.S would be put to bed with Karen gone.” Bethica sounded more annoyed than afraid. Hilton cleared his throat, “Who else knows?” Bethica was hesitant, “Poppy. But she was wasted when I told her. I wouldn’t worry.”

I felt sick to my stomach. *Bethica and Hilton were involved in Sophie’s death?* And Poppy knew.  *Had Karen known*? *Is that why she was dead*? I snuck out the backdoor before I would be forced to hear more. 

**MANDY**

I tiptoed into the house and bumped straight into Mandy. “What are you doing up?” I ran my fingers through my hair. Hoping that the shower had erased any smell of all the insanely good sex that I’d just had.

“Where were you?” She asked. Eyes seeing through me like she already knew. “With the girls.” I glanced down at the book she was reading. “Everything I Never Told You” by Celeste Ng. “What’re you working on?”

“Book report. It’s about this Chinese family. The middle sister drowns.” She looked at me as if she wanted me to have some big reaction. I tried to keep my voice as casual as possible. “How did she drown?”

“She’s scared of water. But she wants to impress her parents, they’re like really intense, so she goes swimming in the lake. Then she drowns. Just like Sammy.” She turned a page and used her purple highlighter to underline a passage.  My voice was shaking, “Sammy didn’t drown trying to impress me.”

“Sure he did. Don’t you remember?” She changed the pitch of her voice to sound more like Sammy, “*Mommy, watch me hold my breath! Watch me, mom*.’” 

I felt the heat in my cheeks rising. It took everything in me to steady my voice and not fall to my knees. “Mandy, sometimes you can be so cruel.”

She capped the pen and looked right at me. “It’s not my fault you have selective memory.”  I reached for my bottle of Percocet but when I turned it over several  chewable Vitamin Cs landed in my hand. “Mandy, did you take my pills?” 

Mandy looked from me to the pill bottle. Then put on her most defiant voice. “You probably did it during one of your sleep walking episodes.” I tried not to sound defensive, “Sleepwalking episodes, what’re you talking about?” 

“The chugging water, staring out the window all creepy, in the middle of the night. Or when you think I’m talking on the phone when I’m clearly not.”

“Mandy, don’t gaslight me.” 

“I didn’t take the damn pain pills. I prefer *uppers* not downers.”

“What? Have you been taking Shellian’s Adderall? I want the truth!”

Mandy slammed the book shut. “Until you can start being honest with me I’m done being honest with you.”

**Death #2: Poppy**

Poppy came over to help me get the “Sammy’s Smile” Instagram up and running. “Content night,” she called it. She started by taking down photos of all the food I had posted on my Instagram and inserting more photos of Sammy. 

That’s when she found Jacob’s Instagram account. **FREEJACOB1**.

I had forgotten to un-tag Jacob from a photo of Sammy. Gapped toothed and blowing a pink bubble. With that one mistake, Poppy now had an all-access pass into all of the details about my ex that I had purposely omitted from our friendship. 

“I’m in the Forbidden City. Alone but the walls bulge with ghosts. This palace isn’t a palace at all. It’s a prison. They left me here, didn’t they? Abandoned. Secrets crawling through my veins. I’m the true ghost now. Recognize me?”

“Oh shit.” Poppy’s mink-lashed eyes fluttered in disbelief. “He really lost it.”

Mandy walked into the house just  as Poppy clicked on a photo of her father’s emotionally damaged face. She raced up the stairs and slammed her door.  I ran after her as she screamed, “Stop her or she’ll find out everything!”

That night as I scrolled through the Sammy’s Smile Instagram and saw a new DM. 

**FREEJACOB1** “*Monotonizing on our son’s death*.” He included a photo of him leaning against a Palm Tree. #paradise.

There aren’t Palm Trees in China. He knew where we were. He had found us.

I asked Poppy to go on a hike the day before she died. I thought it’d be nice to offer up an activity that didn’t revolve around drinking. Every occasion in this town seemed to come with a monogrammed glass of Veuve champagne.  Poppy had offered me her recipe for her Mushroom Detox smoothies to use in my cookbook so I’d blended us up two thermoses to celebrate when we reached the top of the mountain. 

I’d only used half of the recommended dose of psilocybin. I’d never used mushrooms before and didn’t want to find out how I’d react when I was 3 miles up a steep ravine. Just as we were got to the peak overlooking Montecito, Poppy admitted something to me. “I had an  affair with Greer. Back when I was using.”

“Does Shari know?” 

“No. AA says to only make amends if it will not cause further damage to the person you’ve wronged. Shari has had a rough year. With Matilda transitioning to Matty and all. She puts on a brave face but I know this would kill her. But Bethica knows.”

“Aren’t you afraid she’ll tell Shari?”

“She’s got her own secrets she doesn’t want out.”

I wanted to find a way to tell her that I already knew, “I don’t think secrets don’t stay secrets for long in this town.” Poppy looked at me. “Not even when you come all the way from China to hide them.”

My head snapped to look at Poppy. “Hiding? What am I hiding?”

Poppy came clean. “I did a deep dive on Jacob. I couldn’t help myself It was hard because, China news and all, but I know what he said about Sammy’s death. Did he blame you...and Mandy.” I played dumb. To see how much he knew, “What do you mean?”

“Jacob said it was your fault.”

“It wasn’t Mandy’s fault. Jacob told her not to get her cast wet.”

She took a breath then said, “Reese, why did Jacob go to jail?”

I was at a loss for words, and frankly, irritated as hell. So I said the only thing I could think of to avoid having to answer. “Why’d you set the Instagram to public? You swore it’d be private…Have you relapsed?”

Standing at the edge of the cliff Poppy looked very small. I was so angry I could have shoved her from the cliff then and there. She vehemently denied changing the account settings. “I had a slip. I’m sorry.”

Hearing her own-up to what she did quieted my brain. It was an accident. She made a mistake. “Let’s forget it. Here, I made us Detox smoothies from the recipe you gave me to celebrate when we reached the top!” I handed her a thermos.  “To Paradise!” Poppy clinked my cup. “To paradise.” 

Less than 12 hours later Poppy was dead.

Bethica, Shari, and I found her body balled up on the floor at her Holistic Haven clinic the next day. She had relapsed. Overdosed on pills. 

A purple sock shoved deep into her mouth. Red foam soaking the edges. Everyone in town called it auto-erotica gone wrong. It was a far more glamourous cause of death than a simple overdose.  Edgy. Dramatic. 

The way that Poppy would have liked to be remembered.
