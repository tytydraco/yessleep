Last month, I got a job at a small security company. The pay wasn’t great, but I needed it. My task: monitor a room in an abandoned building for eight hours a night. Five nights a week.

They didn’t tell me much about the building. Only that it used to be a pharmaceutical lab. The listing was vague. The interviewer said the work was easy. They told me never to leave the room, no matter what I saw or heard.

The room I monitored was empty. Four walls, a floor, a ceiling. A chair sat in the middle, bolted to the floor. My station was outside, watching through a monitor.

The first few nights were normal. I’d sit, watch the chair, kill time. But on my fifth night, something changed.

At 3:17 a.m., the chair moved.

It wasn’t dramatic. Just a small scrape, like someone shifting in it. I stared at the screen. My heart pounded. I tried to convince myself I imagined it. But then it moved again. Slightly, tilting to the side before settling.

I reported it the next morning. My supervisor didn’t seem surprised.

“It happens,” he said. “Ignore it. The chair moves, but nothing happens.”

Nothing happens? What did that mean?

I thought about quitting. But I needed the money. So, I went back.

3:17 a.m. came again. The chair moved again. This time, it turned, facing the camera. A cold chill crawled up my spine. I couldn’t look away from the screen.

By the second week, things worsened. The chair didn’t just move—it rocked. Once, it tipped over completely. When I checked the footage, the timestamp froze every time it moved. Seven seconds, like the camera glitched.

Then, last night, I made the biggest mistake of my life.

At 3:16 a.m., I heard it. A faint scraping sound. The chair wasn’t just moving on the screen—it was moving in real life.

I grabbed my flashlight and opened the door.

The chair was facing me. Centered, tilted forward. Like it was leaning in. I froze.

And then... I swear, the chair whispered my name.

I slammed the door, locked it, shaking. My keys nearly fell from my hands. I didn’t go back to the monitor. When my shift ended, I left without clocking out.

Now, I’m sitting in my car, typing this. My shift starts in twenty minutes. I don’t know if I can go back. But the worst part?

When I got home this morning, there was a chair in my living room.

It’s the same chair.

And it’s facing my bedroom door.

I thought I was imagining it. But then I noticed the chair’s edges. Covered in something—dust, maybe. But fresh. Too fresh. It had been dragged. Moved. My hands shook as I examined it. Red scratches carved into the wood. Like someone clawed at it to escape.

I should’ve called the police. But I couldn’t. I felt a pull. Like I had to stay. Stay where? Stay in the chair? I don’t know.

I dragged it into the hallway. Hoping that would stop it. But it didn’t. It followed me.

That night, I went back to the building. I had to—rent wasn’t going to pay itself. When I entered the security room, I glanced at the monitor. My heart nearly stopped.

The chair moved again. But this time, it wasn’t alone.

I could see something in the reflection. A figure. Tall—too tall. Limbs twisted unnaturally, joints bent the wrong way. Almost human, but something was off. The face... blurred. I couldn’t make it out. But I felt it. Watching me.

I froze. The figure moved, slow, deliberate. It crouched next to the chair, waiting for something. Or someone. Then, the chair tipped over.

I couldn’t look away. I didn’t want to, but I couldn’t stop.

The clock read 3:17 a.m. again. I remembered that time. The night this all started.

The figure looked up. I swear it smiled.

I couldn’t breathe. The room grew colder. Darker.

Then, everything went black.

I woke up on the floor. How long had I been out? I don’t know. The monitor was still on, showing the empty room. But something was new. Wrong.

The timestamp froze at 3:17 a.m. again. And the chair... was gone.

I sprinted to the door, desperate to escape. But when I opened it, the hallway had changed. Longer. Darker. Like a maze. The walls pulsed with something alive.

I ran.

I don’t know where to go anymore. I don’t know if I can escape.

I thought this job would be easy. But now, the chair is everywhere. Watching me. Waiting.

The worst part?

I’m not sure I’m still alone.
