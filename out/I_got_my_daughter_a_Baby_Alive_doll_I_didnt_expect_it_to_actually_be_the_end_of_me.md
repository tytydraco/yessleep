The title might sound crazy, but I couldn't believe it either. I, F 34, have a daughter, F 8. She is a kind, innocent child who has a particular interest for Barbies and all that stuff. When she first saw Barbies and Baby Alive dolls, she felt attached to them instantly. So, I bought her a set of 2 dolls and a small Barbie playset, and we played together. I have to admit, it was pretty fun to play with these dolls. As she grew up, I bought her more, and we played together with them. Soon, her room was full of Barbie dolls and Baby Alive dolls.

But you might be thinking to yourself: what's the problem? Everything is normal, and you bought a Baby Alive doll before. How could it be the end of you? Ill explain that now.

In December of 2023, I tried finding a new Baby Alive doll to give to my child for Christmas. It's her favorite holiday, and she loves getting gifts from her relatives and Santa Claus. So this year wouldn't be any different. We set up the tree, decorated it, and I secretly bought her some gifts to unrap on Christmas Day. There was one thing missing from her list that was sold out everywhere: a Baby Alive doll that she has been wanting for a while. I searched everywhere: Target, Amazon, Walmart, but it was sold out, no matter where I looked. I was starting to give up, and I was about to just tell her "Santa was busy, and he couldn't get it in his sleigh right now", until a co worker told me about a site called eBay, where people resell things. I instantly went on eBay and started searching. I searched for a long time, until I found a reasonable price of 20$. That was strange though, the doll costed 40$ with the whole set, and this seller was selling it 20$ cheaper, with everything included. I couldnt complain though, every other listing was 60$ or more. So, I got the doll, wrapped it up, and waited for Christmas.

On Christmas Day, my daughter unwrapped the doll and she was overjoyed. She instantly opened the doll and went to play with it in her room after opening the doll. I went and joined her in playing with the new doll, before we went to my mother's house to celebrate Christmas with my family. 

The first few days with the doll was normal. After Christmas, she returned to school, and I returned to my job after my week long Christmas break. At my job, it allows for remote days if time is needed, so I used those days to help with setting up anything Christmas related. After I returned to work, I met up with my coworker.

"Did you get the doll for your daughter like you wanted?" My coworker asked me.

"Yeah, I did." I said while typing up a document needed for a client.

"I hope she enjoyed it. She was so happy opening it."

I froze. How did she know that? I shrugged it off. Maybe she said that because she has children herself. I went to pick her up after school, and on the drive home, my daughter asked me something weird.

"Mommy, how do I make a cake?"

I thought this was weird, but I told her I would help her make it. So, at home, we had fun baking the cake. It was very fun, and me and my daughter enjoyed making the cake. We ate the cake, and then decided to go to sleep afterwards. 

I woke up in the middle of the night, tired. I shrugged it off as usual. Sometimes I wake up, it's normal. I walked to the kitchen to get a glass of water, and when I was walking back to my room, I heard my daughter in her room. I decided not to go in, and I listened.

"Patricia [The dolls name], I did what you said for the sacrifice."

I was confused. Sacrifice? How could she know what to do for that? I was worried, until I heard the doll speak again.

"Now go and kill your mother. That's all we need to finish this, and you can become what you always wanted. You made the blood cake, now finish what we started."

That was my coworkers voice. I was about to leave the house, when I saw my coworker holding a gun behind me.

"Leaving so soon?" She asked.

"I- what- what are you doing?"

"I'm gonna break it to you: I'm a demon. We were doing a small fun game called a sacrifice, and you happen to be our sacrificial lamb."

I turned to run into my daughters room, until I saw her. Holding a knife.

"Mommy, the doll said I can gain power."

"Well- the only power you need- uh- is with me! Please, it doesn't have to be this way!"

I heard my coworker cock the gun, and I felt the tip of the gun at the back of my head.

"Oh, but it does. You were all I needed from day one."

I heard a gun shoot, and I fell to the ground.

"Mommy! What happened to Mommy!?" I heard my daughter cry.

"She's just... sleeping. You will see her again soon, just follow me."

"Okay..." I heard her and my daughter walk away, and then I passed out.

I woke up on the ground. Turns out she missed, and I didn't die. So, I called an ambulance, and immediately started writing this. If I did, just tell me daughter I love her. I will update this post if anything happens.
