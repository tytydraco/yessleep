Today was a bad day. Today I stayed inside my apartment all day, alone. 

Hi I'm Mark, and something not quite human has been living in  my apartment complex for years, probably.

  
For me all this started when I moved in a year and a half ago. I live in a small 1 room, 1 bathroom apartment, so does everyone else on the first and third floor. But I'm getting ahead of myself. When I moved in I ''knew'' about 5 of my neighbours, two old ladies on the first floor and one on my floor. One young guy also on my floor, I never met him, and my old, short, fat neighbour on the second floor.

  
This guy, Karl. I met him a couple of times, he never sounded right and I could never understand him. He always mumbled and his hands always shook. He always wore the same clothes, He always looked the same like some cartoon character. He stank as well probably came from him wearing the same clothes all the time His droopy eyes and perpetual slack jaw made him look like he was half asleep all the time or very very drunk.

  
I was, still am a bartender in a local restaurant. I say restaurant because that's what my boss wants. It's more of a bar/pub that serves food. I have a lot of experience with drunk people, I eventually learned to just nod and '' yep ''  my way through whatever they have to say. That's what I did to him.



I'm not anti-social or anything, I just need some time to recharge my social battery after a long day at work. I work 2-3 days in a row, 12-hour shifts, 2 days off. It sucks, and I'm starting to hate it more and more over time but the money is still good. I'm sorry for getting sidetracked, I just think it's good for you to get some insight for my headspace.

  
Anyway, people have disappeared from their apartments over night, it was 4 in total. New people moved in soon afterward the old ones disappeared, and then a few of the new ones did too. I think the first one was the young guy on my floor, just poof, gone overnight. I didn't realise it until a few days later when a new couple moved in. Two guys, they're gone too, They vanished 2 months after the first guy, They were nice. I heard something that time, some bangs and cracks and thuds and i just chalked it up to the usual apartment sounds.

  
I never lived in a house. My parents lived in an apartment, so did my grandparents. I can confidently say that I've never even slept in a house. That being said I hope you can understand why i wasn't scared by a few loud noises in the middle of the night. I mean when I lived with my grandparents we had scaffolding outside our window for like half a year.

  
The next disappearance happened over the summer. I was gone at the time. some company had a party at the restaurant , they left at like 3 am, we finished cleaning up at around 5-6 am. Drank a few beers with my boss, he was an asshole but he liked me when he was drunk, then i went out for a smoke and I just went home. I know it makes me look like an asshole but I learned not to say goodbye when I'm leaving a party, because everyone wants to have a last beer or a last shot a last blunt or whatever and I don't. So I just leave. 

  
When i got home there was a distinct metallic smell on the first floor, You could hear heavy breathing . The next morning i found out what you probably put together a long time ago. Everyone who ''disappeared'', died. They were killed and eaten and for some reason this time was different. Before there was no smell, no blood no evidence. That morning i went downstairs, there were dents on the floor, four dots next to each other, right there in the tiles, like a dog would leave on carpet when his claws weren't ground for a long time.

  
There was blood right by the main entrance. just a few drops. Holes in the ceiling again four right next to each other. I think I barely escaped death that day, and I don't know how.

  
When fall came, there were hunters in the woods. You could hear gunshots all day and night. The last disappearance was the sloppiest one. It was the old lady on my floor. I woke up in the middle of the night. What sounded like a bear woke up faster than any coffee could ever hope to match. I looked through my peephole, there was a trail of blood in the hallway. listening closely i realised the growling was coming from downstairs.

  
I put my clothes on, I don't have a gun. I have an old replica axe from a medieval festival i went to a while back. It wasn't sharp but it was quite hefty, had some good weight on it. I went down to the second floor. The second door on the left was open, the inside was pitch black. I turned on the flashlight on my phone and went in. 

  
Two smells hit me at once, The first sickly sweet like fermenting fruit, The second, metal. Just like that night in the summer. The walls were covered in blood, some fresh bright red. some old almost black, there was a mirror in the little hallway, i could see into the kitchen, and there it was.

  
It was tall, that's all I could really tell. I could only see the silhouette. I probably should have called the police, I didn't. I threw my phone into the kitchen, threw it like a frisbee, landed flashlight up. I took my axe in both arms and I swung at the creature, Like I said It wasn't sharp but it was heavy. Up close with the light of my phone I could make out more details, I can picture it exactly. I can hardly describe it. It was pale and thin, I couldn't see its face. It was hurt, a gunshot right in its side. when I hit it, the thing screamed.

  
I did my best, It stabbed me. I probably knocked it off balance because it only hit my leg. Eventually, It got tired, or maybe I scared it. Either way it shoved me to the floor and ran off. I called the police, tried to tourniquet my leg with my belt. I know I should have just stayed down and waited, but I wanted to take a look around. 

  
It dug holes in the walls. it connected all the apartments on It's floor and made a pathway into a few others on the upper and lower floor. Thankfully there was no obvious path into mine. I Found Bodies, or skin suits I guess, I don't know They were hung up like coats, perfectly intact.

 Ten.

 There were ten and most of them were people I knew, not just from the complex but also from around town. The whole floor was freezing cold. I passed out

  
So here i am, it's January. The thing's been gone for a while 3-5 months, I'm not sure when our confrontation happened. The cops called it crack head disregarded the pathways. Didn't find the skins, It probably came back for them. I haven't told anyone, I'm too young to be thrown into the loony-bin. But I hope I'm going crazy, because for the last week, I've been hearing growling outside.
