There was a different person at the gas station. A rough looking older guy with a big greying beard. 

  
He nodded and smiled at me, “Poor Anthony couldn’t make it.”

  
I said nothing, took the bag. It felt like I was carrying a bomb.

  
The old man said something I don’t remember, laughed loudly as I shambled out.

  
I peeked inside, caught a glimpse of Anthony’s face on a medal like the other package, but there was a different gruesome surprise inside. Wrapped in paper, I caught a glimpse of a medical bag filled to the brim with something red. It was obvious what it was, but even now here I am speaking in abstractions, unable to face it. I drove for five minutes before I had to pull over and hurl. Still retching, I sped to the house. I sprinted to the door, heard stomping footsteps coming from upstairs when I put down the bag, and I was already speeding around the corner before the door opened.

  
A cop car followed me right on my ass until the first set of lights off the ramp. 

  
I drowned myself in some of the alcohol I had bought in my spending binge the other day. 

  
Just a few more days, I decided. Just enough money to escape, one more week and... then I’d run.

  
I hadn’t met with trouble as long as I just did what they said, so...

  
It dawned in me then that I hadn’t seen any other orders pop up at all. Not that I had taken any others, but... I tried to remember the last time I saw a normal order, couldn’t remember. Maybe once they had me, they blocked the normal orders. It made sense that the developers of the app were involved, or at least somebody on the inside.

  
The next night, another bag, a new face on the medal, another bundle of fingertips and fingernails.  Thought the girl on the medal’s face seemed vaguely familiar, and it wasn’t until I pulled up to the house that I placed her as the girl I had seen in the back of the ghost car when the cop pulled me over. 

Holy shit...

  
A police car was parked in the driveway, the only vehicle that time. Why the fuck didn’t they just deliver it themselves? Why? Was this just a sick game to fuck with me?

  
When I hastily went to put the package down, the door swung open the moment I let go. I jumped back.

  
Nobody was there in the doorway. It was my first really good view of the entrance. It looked like the lobby of a hospital. A light came from the entrance to the hallway on the other side. I turned down, slowly, my gut tensing.

  
Someone was laying on the floor. The girl that had first answered the door, spread out limply. Her eyes were glassy. 

  
I thought she was dead, but when something thumped behind her, shaking the whole floor, she sputtered up a bit of blood. 

  
I turned up to the source of the thump, saw something huge, a dark shape, seated in a chair in the hallway outside the entryway. The figured covered in the tarp was rocking in the seat, left and right, dragging the chair forward, then it stopped... it was stirring underneath, began to stand up.

  
I quickly leaped away on all fours like a deer running from a wolf, the girl’s gurgling laughter echoing through the night until I slammed my car door shut. 

  
I was paid the next day like usual. I had 4500$ total to my name. It might have been enough to get me away and get a rough start somewhere else. 

  
I delivered again that night, so they wouldn’t suspect anything. Nobody (or nothing) came to the door that time, luckily. I had already packed up anything I might need, withdrew my money from the bank. I drove around aimlessly for about an hour, to shake off any would be pursuers.

  
When I was absolutely sure nobody was following me, I started to head down a backroad that would take me out of province.

  
I remember I started to cry. I could be free.

  
My phone rang, the number was unknown.

  
I didn’t answer it.

  
It rang again.

  
Again.

  
Again.

  
Again...

  
I hit answer on my radio screen.

  
Instantly, the person on the other end hung up.

  
I kept driving, ignored my sinking heart, ignored the fact that all hope being drained from me. 

  
It rang again! Unceasingly. I had a few texts. I cursed and let the car roll to a stop, picked up my phone.

  
I squeeze it so hard it nearly broke. Another set of photos. Of a house. But it wasn’t my house.  
It was my dad’s house.

  
Those bastards... those fucking bastards! Rage mingled with my terror, but in the end fear swamped it over.

  
“I wouldn’t leave if I were you, Robert.”

  
You have a duty.

  
You need to do this, don’t you see?

  
For yourself.

  
For your father.

  
For me.

  
Tomorrow, it will truly begin.  


Tomorrow, we need you on your best behavior.  


Tomorrow, and from now on.

  
Don’t disappoint me, Robert.

  
Your friend, Nick.”

  
I drove back in the depths of despair.

  
My father lived out of the province, alone. How did they find him? What were they going to do? I imagined my father’s fingertips in one of those bags, or a sack of his blood, or God knows what.  
I put the pedal to the floor and sped home.

  
There was no escape. 

  
They had me.
