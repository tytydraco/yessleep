Hey, Reddit. Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. I never thought I’d be writing something like this, but I need to get it off my chest. I’ve hunted in Wexford County, Michigan, for over 30 years, and I know these woods better than the back of my hand. But what I saw last October still haunts me. I think… no, I *know* I saw something out there. And I’m pretty sure it was the Michigan Dogman.

Let me start by saying I’m not someone who buys into urban legends. I’ve heard the stories, of course—if you’re from Michigan, you’ve heard them too. The Dogman, half-man, half-dog, seven feet tall with glowing blue eyes, stalking the woods at night. I always thought it was just a local myth, something to scare kids or keep tourists on edge. Until last year, that is.

It was late October, right around dusk. I was deep in the woods, tracking a huge buck I’d been after for days. The tracks led me to this dense part of the forest, where the trees grow so thick you can barely see the sky. That’s when I noticed how quiet it was. I’ve been out in the woods at all hours, and it’s never *that* quiet. No wind, no birds, not even the usual rustle of leaves. It felt… wrong.

Then, I heard it. A growl, deep and low, coming from somewhere behind me. It wasn’t a bear or a wolf—I’ve heard those before. This was different. It sounded *wrong*, like it didn’t belong in these woods or anywhere else. I turned around, expecting to see a bear, maybe a large coyote, but there was nothing. Just trees and shadows.

At this point, I should’ve listened to my gut and gotten out of there, but I kept going, driven by pride, I guess. I don’t know. A few minutes later, I caught sight of something moving between the trees. At first, I thought it was the buck I was tracking. But when I got a better look… it wasn’t a deer. It wasn’t *anything* I’d ever seen before.

This thing was huge, at least seven feet tall. It was hunched over, with long, muscular arms that hung low to the ground. Its fur was dark, almost black, and its eyes—those eyes—were the most terrifying part. They were bright blue, like ice, and they seemed to glow in the fading light. But the worst part was the way it *looked* at me. It wasn’t the look of an animal sizing up prey. It was… something else. Like it was studying me.

I froze, my heart pounding so hard I could barely think. I had my rifle with me, but for the first time in my life, I didn’t feel like it would do any good. I slowly raised it anyway, aimed right between those glowing eyes. But before I could pull the trigger, the thing let out this low, rumbling growl and… vanished. Just like that. One second it was there, and the next, it was gone.

I didn’t wait around after that. I got out of those woods as fast as I could, practically ran back to my truck. The whole time, I felt like it was still watching me, just out of sight, waiting for me to make a wrong move.

Since then, I haven’t gone back to that part of the forest. I haven’t told anyone about this, not even my hunting buddies. They’d just laugh, call me crazy. But I can’t shake the feeling that it’s still out there, lurking in the shadows of Wexford County.

So, I guess I’m posting this here to see if anyone else has had a similar experience. I can’t be the only one who’s seen it, right? If you’re from Michigan or have hunted these woods, and you’ve seen something you can’t explain, let me know. Maybe we can figure out what the hell is out there.

Thanks for reading. And if you’re ever in the Wexford woods after dark… be careful. You might not be alone.
