I can't believe I finally managed to get through. I guess they were on to something here.

Surely there must be confusion, on your part, dear readers. Please, allow me to erase it. Let's start from the beginning.

I apologize in advance for any errors in English. It is, after all, not my mother tongue. Nor may the English I know be identical to that of your universe. Who knows? 

My name is Dieter Bauer. I currently hold the rank of SS-Hauptsturmbannf√ºhrer, and am attached to the 29. SS-Garnisonsdivision "Morgenrot", tasked with peacekeeping operations in the greater Moskau area, in Reichskommissariat Moskowien.

The current date, in my world, is 20. October, 1979.

I am currently in an underground research facility on the outskirts of Moskau. The chaos outside is too much to bear.

A diplomatic crisis resulted in the outbreak of a third Weltkrieg, or World War. This happened exactly 8 days ago. The Wonder weapons of all major powers were launched. A complete exchange of total destruction.

I will not lie... I prefer not to think of what became of my wife, Astrid, and my son, Heinz. I hope that they were luckier than those still alive.

Few of my comrades survived the initial blasts. We took refuge in this compound, deep in the earth. All we knew about it was that this was an Ahnenerbe research station closed in 1976 due to lack of funding and satisfactory results by order of Reinhard Heydrich himself. 

Well, me and my comrades discovered the computers the scientists were working with, and while the outside world crumbled, we could only read their leftover notes... And mess with the equipment.

To keep things short, it turns out that they discovered a parallel universe. Yours. But they could only access it by perfectly linking our satellites to yours. And even so, only via computer data, never physically.

They even left a list of what they call "links", very limited. Every time we tried to access another thing on your "internet", our computers proved incompatible.

This point, where I write this now, appears to work just fine, although there are lots of letters missing from the looks of it. My messages disappear into the void, so I am just placing the same message everywhere until it finally sticks somewhere. 

It is to my understanding that English is the lingua franca of your world, too, which is why I am using it here. Please, whoever reads this, contact your nearest German embassy and tell them the information presented below. 

Stalin left a legacy of death and destruction ever since he fled to the Urals in '42. But we never knew until last week. 

Nuclear Armageddon is the least of the world' s problems currently. 

He gave Trofim Lysenko unlimited authority to experiment in search of wonder weapons. Lysenko discovered new poisons, viruses... Which we saw deployed against us over the last 8 days. 

Horrible, but still not topping the nuclear missiles launched by the Soviet Union's reanimated, rotting carcass. 

What I am talking about is a true abomination unfit for existence itself. 

An electromagnetic signal that is sentient. It is sentient and it hijacks an individual's mind, compelling them to commit suicide in as little as five seconds after hearing it. 

It can enter most communication devices with capacity to transmit sounds. Radios, television sets... Even air raid siren speakers.

What I truly do not understand (aside from how exactly it works) is why they kept this hidden until now, and not use it earlier. It would've certainly helped them decades ago.

Stalin died and so did any chance of the USSR becoming relevant internationally ever again. So we thought. They were left with just the urals and Siberia. And a population of a little over 30 million. Our main enemies were the US, Japan and the treacherous Italians in the cold war. 

Maybe I am thinking of this wrong! Writing it down so that I do not forget it: Perhaps the signal was discovered by Lysenko back in the 40s or 50s, but never used. And now that it's been two decades since he died, the containment measures probably finally failed.

No matter: to anyone reading this, inform the nearest German embassy of our situation! Ensure the Reich of your world sends a proper task force into the Urals to seize and recontain the signal before it escapes!

I will attempt to keep communications continuous once I find a stable point of comms. Perhaps this time it might be it.

And please ensure that you turn off any audio devices attached to the machine you are seeing this from. We do not yet know if the signal is capable of reaching your world. We hope not.
