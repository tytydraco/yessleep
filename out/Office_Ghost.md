The ghost is made up. I know that. There is no office ghost. I want to be very clear on this point.

It all started a few months ago when John, one of the few men we had in the office that day, went to the bathroom. I was checking the inventory of sticky notes, paperclips, and correction tape in the supply closet near the bathrooms. John walked to the men’s room door. It was ajar, and he casually pushed it. The door snapped shut and stuck fast. He pushed harder, and then jokingly asked me if I’d glued it shut.

“What? No, we’re out of that kind of glue,” I'd answered, honestly only halfway paying attention to him until he put both hands on the door and leaned his weight.

The door didn’t budge. He looked at me, confused. “What am I supposed to do now?”

I shrugged. “There’s no one in the women’s; you can go in there.”

John went to the bathroom. I finished my inventory and went back around to my desk.

He spent the entire morning telling everyone who walked past his cube that a ghost had shut him out of the bathroom.

When lunch came around, John told me that he’d tried the men’s door again after using the bathroom, and it was fine. In fact, he’d tried it multiple times since that morning, and no other time did it jam, stick, or refuse to open. He said he believed that that meant the ghost wasn’t focused in the men’s room, meaning we may encounter it anywhere in the office.

I kept my face solemnly puzzled and polite, but inside I was laughing. Less than an hour after the bathroom incident, Sylvia had come over to my cube. She’d looked nervous, almost embarrassed.

“I was the one in the men’s room this morning!” she had confessed, “I had to go, and all the stalls were full in the women’s room. I knew there weren’t very many guys in the office, so I didn’t think I’d be noticed, but when I went to leave, John was trying to get in. I just *couldn’t* get caught in there! Don’t tell anyone?”

I had promised, and I had fully intended to keep that promise, which meant that I couldn’t tell John there was no ghost.

A couple of weeks later, John got into a fierce argument with Jane, our resident holy-rollin’ Bible thumper about the ghost. According to her, the only ghost that existed was the Holy Spirit. John argued that he saw no reason for said Spirit to be keeping unsuspecting men from bathrooms. She didn’t appreciate his point or sense of humor, and she told him so, though in a yelling, convoluted sort of way. Luckily, things didn’t escalate to the point of needing intervention from HR, but their working relationship is definitely worse for the wear now.

Others, however, have since taken advantage of the situation. Over the past few months, any time something went wrong, or missing, or any time anything odd happened, the ghost has been blamed. Myka, one of the younger women in our office, swears she’d seen the ghost floating through cubicle walls one evening while she was working late. Her vivid description of a skeletal woman wearing a long, lacy, white gown stained with dirt and blood is entertaining, to be sure, but no one in the office has taken her seriously about anything she claims since she swore two summers ago that Elvis Presley returned her missing dog. But now the others invariably use her description when blaming the “ghost” for things. I guess no one is disturbed by the idea that this supposedly female ghost was first encountered locking John out of the men’s bathroom?

Of course, Sylvia and I *still* haven’t said anything when we hear these wild tales, but John will inevitably bring up the bathroom incident, and gently nay-say anyone’s argument that the ghost is malevolent, or even mischievous, again apparently ignoring the fact she used the wrong bathroom. Why does she steal stuff if she's neither malevolent nor mischievous? John says it must be her only form of communication. 

John thinks of himself as quite the expert on her, as he had been the first to encounter her. Jane of course sniffs disdainfully at all talk of the ghost, but doesn’t voice her none-the-less clear opinion that she thinks it’s all nonsense. I generally think it’s pretty funny, but the other day, Sylvia confided to me she felt guilty about starting this whole thing.

Right now, though, I don’t find any of this funny. The ghost is made up; there is no ghost. I’m not sure who’s been stealing, although I wonder if it really isn't just away to keep the ghost story circulating. I *know* the bathroom incident was Sylvia, and Myka is just a sweet, gullible flake.

There is absolutely no ghost. She, *it*, is completely made up!

But here I am at my desk, working some overtime, trying to figure out what am I watching float through the cubicles towards the men’s bathroom.
