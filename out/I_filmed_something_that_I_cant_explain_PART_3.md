Weirdly enough considering what happened that evening, I slept better than I had in a while last night. I mean, thinking about it, it’s actually easy to understand, because for the first time in a while, I wasn’t alone. We weren’t talking at all, but Lucy’s presence was so heartwarming.

 

Today, we woke up late, I think 11 AM or so. We were both still pretty shook up by what happened, especially since Lucy had even less explanations or context as I did. She served a small breakfast for us. I could see she was still internalizing and processing a lot because she wasn’t talking much and had a way more closed face than usual, but she still couldn’t contain her natural kindness. We were eating breakfast when she finally broke the silence.

 

“I think I’m ready for some more explanations now, if you have some.” She said calmly.

 

I considered what to tell her, how to tell her, in what order. I was myself in the dark about so many things, but I did know what was the sort of nightmare that I recorded the evening before, or who was Claire. I hesitated a bit, but whatever was happening, I knew I needed help, and I couldn’t get her help if I wasn’t honest with her. I took a deep breath, and I started by explaining the real memory that was behind what she saw that I recorded. My memory from when I was 14.

 

It wasn’t easy. I never opened up that much and so honestly about what happened that time, even to the cops or the psychiatrist that I had to see after. I told her everything, in details. I talked about all the “love” when I first arrived in the family, the gifts, the recurring hugs that I was too young to understand the meaning of, all the other kids in the family that looked so broken, the slow change of behavior from the couple, all those small things, the details that stuck with me for all these years. I told her about that day, the day it all fell apart, that afternoon where he called me to the basement to help him. I explained the shock, the pain, the shame, the clothes I was wearing, the look the wife had, the shape of the ceiling, the smell of the basement, the meal they served to everyone after, all the details that never left my head. When I was finished explaining, I wasn’t even crying, I wanted to, but it didn’t come, the shame was back so strong, it was suffocating me.

 

Lucy looked shocked. She wasn’t saying anything, her eyes were filled with tears that she couldn’t stop from falling down her face. I was looking down at my feet, I didn’t know what to say now. I thought maybe I made a mistake by telling her about this, maybe she wouldn’t talk to me anymore, maybe she was disgusted. That’s when she formed a phrase that I didn’t expect to hear.

 

“Sarah,… do you think I can hug you? I understand if you don’t want, I just, I want to hug you, but, you know, I don’t…” She was mumbling.

 

I looked at her face, and I had no hesitation as to what my answer would be.



 “Yes. Hug me.” I said.

 

It felt so warm, so comfortable, I hadn’t felt like this in a while.

 

“You’ll be okay Sarah.” She said while holding me.

 

Those words echoed in my brain, and then, I cried. These were good tears. It felt like I was getting rid of a burden, of a guilt that was following me, even just for a moment.

Eventually, we separated. There was a silence.

 

“Maybe I could make us some coffee, don’t you think?” She said.

 

I had a little laugh.

 

“Yes, I think that would be nice.”

 

She brought two hot coffees. I know I still had something else to tell her, I had to talk about what happened with Mark. I prepared her by explaining that what I was about to explain was going to sound crazy, and I told her everything about my last encounter with him and Claire, explaining that the unknown man that appeared in the two videos seemed to be looking for Claire, saying that she was “the solution” . Of course she had heard rumors about the two missing. When I was done, she looked like she was a bit perplex.

 

“So, do you believe me?” I asked.

 

She gave me a look that I couldn’t really interpret, it was weird, but funny.

 

“I would really like to tell you that I believe you entirely, but if I’m being honest, I’m not entirely sure yet. However, considering what I saw so far it doesn’t sound that crazy now…” She explained.

 

She then smiled at me.

 

“I guess we have to find them now don’t you think?” She said.

 

“So you believe me?!” I asked again.

 

“I don’t “don’t believe you”, but I know you need help, so, what is wrong with looking for them.” She looked at me with a smile. “Plus, you know…”

 

“What?”

 

“Well, I finally get to spend time with you.”

 

With that she got out of my room to go get her PC. I smiled, she was making me feel weirdly good, I didn’t know how to describe the feeling, but it’s like, being with her was comforting. She came back minutes later.

 

“So, how do we find them?”

 

I was caught off guard by her question. I told her that I already tried to contact Mark through his phone number but that he probably threw away his phone or at least changed number because I had no answers.

 

“Well, that’s not a good start.” She said. “But, I mean, they’re a 20 year old guy and a 9 year old girl travelling alone, maybe that caught someone’s attention at some point, that may have posted it online?”

 

“I don’t know, if they don’t do anything crazy, I doubt we’ll find anything…”

 

We took a few seconds to think about it, when a sound broke the silence. It was the noise of my camera shooting a picture. 3 times, 3 pictures. Lucy and I exchanged a look, and I immediately grabbed it to look at what had been captured. She got up and sat besides me. Our legs and arms touched which kind of embarrassed me, but not in a bad way, I just wasn’t expecting it. I opened the gallery and there were 3 new pictures, captured just now. I pressed to look at each of them. The three were black images, but I could see that they had a lot of digital noise on them. I had to play with the settings to increase the visibility of the noise, and it formed a text on all three of them. The first one said “they’re”, the second one said “at” and the third one “mulberry”(It didn’t actually say Mulberry, it said the name of a small town that was little more than an hour from us but I changed the name so to not reveal my or their localization). We looked at each other.

 

“I think I believe you more and more.” She said.

 

“Who do you think sent us that sign?” I asked.

 

“Huh, I mean, if you ask me, I would bet on the man who, according to you and what we saw yesterday, appeared in every weird instances since things went sideways and that seems obsessed with finding Claire, but what do I know, am I right?” She was speaking ironically, her tone was so laid back, it felt reassuring to have her goofing around a little.

 

“Do you think we should go?”

 

She made her “thinking hard” face that I was already starting to get used to, she had a very expressive face.

 

“Honestly, I think we should, yes. It’s not far from here, it’s worth a try. But, you know, if you need to rest, we don’t have to.”

 

“No, you’re right, it’s not far, let’s do this.” I said. It wasn’t a very risky move, Mulberry wasn’t far so we could go and come back easily with a bus, I knew the town already, and it wasn’t big, so, if Mark and that Claire were actually there, it shouldn’t be hard to find them.

 

“Okie dokie then. If we want to be able to get back here before sunrise if we don’t find anything, I think we shouldn’t wait too much, so I’ll go pack a few things and, meet you here, okay?”

 

“Yeah, that’s good.”

 

I dressed and took my stuff. Before leaving, I thought it was best to take my camera. Whatever were those strange phenomena, my camera clearly showed that she was more than useful. I took a few more SD cards and charged batteries too.

 

We got out of the building and started to walk to the bus stop. About 3 minutes later, something completely stupid came back to me: we were both students.

 

“Lucy!” I exclaimed. I could see I surprised her a bit so I calmed myself before talking again. “Sorry, sorry, hum, I just thought, don’t you have class today? I mean I know I don’t, but don’t you? I heard the finals for occupational therapy are pretty difficult so…”

 

She first gave me a look of disbelief mixed with a bit of her thinking face, then she let out a laugh.

 

“I’m sorry, are you worried about my finals right now?” She asked with a smile.

 

“I mean, a bit, I don’t want you to fail because of me.”

 

“You’re sweet. Don’t worry, I was going to fail those anyway, I wasn’t ready.”

 

“Ho, okay.” I said.

 

“Plus, I wasn’t going to miss our first trip together…” She was smiling.

 

I was surprised by those last words of her. I knew she was playing, so I decided to got in her game.

 

“Lucy tell me, are you currently flirting with me?” I asked confidently.

 

She looked at me in surprise.

 

“Well, and to say I was thinking I was the one leading this until now…” She said.

 

“So, are you?” I insisted.

 

“Well, I don’t understand your question, and I won’t respond to it.”

 

We both smiled and kept on walking.

 

We arrived at the bus stop and got in. The drive was going to take something like an hour and twenty minutes and the bus was almost empty, so I decided to take some rest and sleep a little bit. Lucy reassured me that she’ll stay aware and wake me up when we get there. I fell asleep pretty fast, the movements of the bus were helping.

 

That’s when things took a bad turn again. I opened my eyes and found myself where I left in my nightmare the evening before: in that basement with all the kids with their long fingers, sharp nails, wide smiles, pointy teeth, all biting me everywhere with the “Dad” encouraging them with a crazy laugh. I screamed for help. I was alone and terrified again. Then, he appeared again: the unknown man. This time I didn’t had to ask for his help, he immediately walked towards me and placed his hands on each side of my head. In a second it was just me and him, still in the basement, but all the kids and the couple were gone. He looked at me and all the bites that were bleeding and seemed very concerned.

 

“Grace, listen to me, we got to get you out of here as fast as possible.” He said.

 

I took a second to put my camera back on my eye so I could see everything through it, feeling protected.

 

“I’m not Grace, who are you?” I asked him.

 

All of sudden, he put his hand on my mouth and make me sign to stay silent. We started to hear heavy steps coming from upstairs. Not long after, a voice started to speak. It was a sinister but playful voice.

 

“Where are you Sarah… Come back and face me, it’s the only way. I’ll get to you eventually…” It said, giggling between each phrase.

 

The man that was helping me showed me a door that was close by and made me sign to follow him. In my memories, this door was just a closet, but when he opened it, it led to a dark and big empty space.

 

“The door is probably not far, follow me!” He said.

 

We ran. I didn’t understand much of what was happening. Eventually, we found a door. It was a nice wooden door, but it was covered in claw marks. The man looked behind us. We could hear a beast like scream approaching from the distance. The man grabbed my shoulders.

 

“Grace, it’s not safe here, the more you’re here the more he gains power over you, you must stay away from here.”

 

“But, it’s a dream… Isn’t it?” I finally said.

 

“No, listen, I don’t know exactly where we are, but it’s real, it’s not in your head, what you see here, it exists.”

 

The scream were getting closer.

 

“But who are you?”

 

“You don’t have time, he's weak, but that doesn't mean he's not dangerous, you need to leave now, find Claire!” He said.

 

Then, he opened the door and pushed me in it. In a second, I was back to myself in the bus. But I found myself holding Lucy’s arm, with my mouth open trying to get to her hand while she was holding me back. I stopped myself immediately. She understood what happened easily, apparently my eyes turned to white, but this time I was having a wide smile and I tried to bite her, while my wounds from yesterday opened again out of nowhere. I looked at it and it was indeed bleeding again, probably because of the kids that bit me again when it started.

 

I apologized and explained to her everything that I lived on my side this time while she was posing new bandages on my now re-opened injuries. After that, we both checked my camera and, as expected, the footage of what happened was on it. She watched it and looked concerned.

 

“What is it?” I asked.

 

“Nothing, it’s just… I’m playing cool but it’s honestly getting scarier as it goes, so, I’m a bit worried, that’s it.”

 

After a few more minutes, we arrived at Mulberry. After the events of the bus, we were hoping very strong that we’ll find Mark and Claire. We started wandering randomly, as I said, it’s not a big town so, we were hoping to find them easily. While we were walking, I saw that she was hiding her hand in her sleeve, and I saw that there was blood running down her finger. I understood that, while I was away wherever it was, I actually succeeded to bite her in the arm and that she chose to hide it from me. I was about to ask her about it when something caught my eye: on a parking lot, I recognized a car. It was the car they had when they came to me that time. It was the only car on the parking lot. I showed it to Lucy and told her that was their car. We approached slowly. Then we got to the other side of it and they were here. They both screamed of surprise and Lucy and I screamed too, because they were drinking blood. Both of them had a blood bag in their hand and were drinking out of it.

 

“WHAT THE FUCK MARK?!” I shouted.  
  
“Sarah?! What are you doing here?!” He shouted back.

 

They both threw away their bag.

 

“You better tell me that these are some fucking juices packaged like that for a horror movie commercial or I’m going to definitely lose it!” I said.

 

“Wow, hey, but, no, I don’t get it what are you doing here?! And who is she?!”

 

“Ho, so I’m the one who owes you an explanation now? Who put me in deep shit and left without a trace?” All my anxiety and fear that I had accumulated these last few days were exploding and I was so angry towards him.

 

“What do you mean “*put you in deep shit*”? I literally just asked you to put a letter in a box!”

 

“Okay, so you’re really clueless this much?”

 

Claire got up and started talking.

 

“What’s happening? Is something wrong?” She asked calmly.

 

“Gosh, I’m sorry I got so angry… Hum, yes, something is clearly wrong, some weird things started to happen, and, well, a lot of things pointed to you two…” I explained.

 

Lucy decided to introduce herself after having witnessed the whole thing.

 

“Hi everyone, nice to meet you, I’m Lucy.”

 

“And how did you find us?” Claire asked.

 

“Well, it’s a bit complicated…”

 

Claire looked at Mark and, now that we were all calmer, they both looked very concerned.

 

“It sounds worrying, but I don’t think we should do this here, and you?” She asked Mark.

 

“Yes, you’re right. So, can we, maybe, take you two to eat somewhere? You can explain everything to us then.” He said.

 

I was still a bit shook so I didn’t answer, but Lucy did for us.

 

“That actually sounds nice, thank you.” She said.  
  
They invited us to get in their car so we could find some place to eat.

 

“What’s with you two wearing sunglasses?” I asked before getting in.

 

“It’s so people don’t recognize us in case we stumble upon someone we know.” Mark answered.

 

“Well it’s not working.” I said.

 

We all got in the car and Mark started driving.

 

That’s where I am now, waiting to get to the diner they found, so I’m writing you this to keep you updated. I have so many thoughts and things I don’t understand, I’ll keep you all updated.
