After polishing the last, (completed, walk away from) draft of my haunted house script, some creepy, weird and pretty much, random things started happening. I don’t usually buy into coincidences, but these moments strung together in such a way that I couldn’t help noticing.

The first instance came from a single line of dialogue that just wasn’t working. It felt off, like it didn’t belong in the scene no matter how many times I rewrote it. Rewrites weren't solving the problem so I tried something else...

Example (not from the actual script):

SYD
Took you long enough.

BEIB
What’re you talking about? I haven’t seen you since seven.

I cut Beib’s line and ran it through an AI text to voice generator that I’ve used for a couple of years. Normally, it’s smooth and reliable. But this time it played the line up until: “What’re you talking about? I haven’t seen…” — then froze and drew out this long, unnatural sound:
 “Ooooooooo.”

I thought it was a glitch, so I tried again. Same exact thing happened. The generator glitched at the very same point. This stood out because, in two years of using it, it had never once failed on me.

The second occurrence came the next day. My father and I had gone out for a coffee, nothing unusual. On the way back, his car suddenly stalled. Just cut out completely. 

Strange, because his car has never given a moment’s trouble, not a flat tyre, not even a broken light. Nothing. Yet the morning after the AI glitch, the engine died without warning. It was as if the weirdness had jumped from the digital page and into real life.

The third and most peculiar incident happened at 8 a.m. the very next morning. I was jolted awake by the sound of a Spanish guitar strumming above me. Not a recording, real strings being plucked, rhythmic and deliberate. The thing is, the adjoining attic room was completely unoccupied at the time. Then came noises like someone crawling around up there.

I got up, opened the attic door, and what I saw was almost surreal. A blackbird perched above the stairwell, staring down at me with ink blotted eyes. It had somehow slipped in through a gap in the gutter. From there it had hopped over the guitar, pecking at random objects, and fluttered around the knick-knacks as though it was its natural habitat 

So there it is. Three incidents in quick succession: the AI glitch, the stalled car and the blackbird with its eerie guitar accompaniment. 

Any one of them on their own could be brushed off. All three together though? In a row? This feels like something else entirely. Something deliberate.

I can’t shake the thought that these moments are more than coincidence. Maybe... just maybe, when you spend enough time writing about a haunted house and the accompanying lore, that energy doesn’t stay trapped on the page.

Perhaps when you’re writing scary stuff, it leaks out into waking life.

I'll thread with care from now on.
