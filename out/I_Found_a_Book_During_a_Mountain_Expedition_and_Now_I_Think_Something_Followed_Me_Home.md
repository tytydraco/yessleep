  
It’s been a few days since I discovered this wretched tome and its unholy contents.  
I can hardly even call it a book. The only thing that makes it resemble one is its familiar shape—but in truth, it’s more like a cursed object, judging by its brutal, wicked appearance.

Its spine is decorated with tiny, brittle bones—what I assume once belonged to forest animals—held together by frayed, sun-burnt string and a mix of crooked hairs. Wedged between each segment of bone are feathers from a variety of birds, stuffed tight and glued in place with a tar-like substance. The cover’s patchwork leather looks stitched together from the skins of different animals. Everything is sealed with a necklace of teeth, tiny bird beaks, and little skulls that resemble human remains—each no bigger than a walnut.

What disturbed me the most, though, was the cover. A hand-painted piece, reminiscent of medieval Christian art, gilded in flowing golden ornaments that frame a central figure: a seated, robed woman whose features are nearly erased by shadow. Only the faintest suggestion of brooding, dark eyes are visible—barely recognizable unless studied under a light with a magnifying glass.

Beneath her, written in a gothic font and embossed in the same golden liquid as the decorative trim, were the words:  
**“Lord Ut’Roth, the Womb & Mother of Mud.”**

I found the tome while taking shelter from a sudden downpour during a hike. I’d stumbled across an abandoned cottage after following a faded trail through the woods. Desperation guided me there. The air inside was stale and heavy with dust. It felt less like a home and more like a museum of a time long past.

Little statues made of straw and mud stood in a circle on top of the dusty dining table. They looked like girls—hollow-eyed, mouths agape. It almost felt like they were there to welcome me.

The place didn’t show any signs of being occupied, which eased my conscience a bit, despite technically breaking in. But I couldn’t afford to think about manners—I needed to dry off and get warm. I lit my emergency lantern, tossed some tinder and logs into the fireplace, and got a fire going.

I was heading to a base camp near the mountain I’d been assigned to collect glacial samples from. I’ve been a mountaineer for over a decade, and figured finding the camp wouldn’t be an issue. The weather was supposed to be good this time of year, and no serious climbing was required. A friend and fellow researcher had taken the heavier gear up with a group of hired porters.

I rarely make mistakes this grave. I’d studied the path relentlessly before setting out—but something went wrong. The forest felt... twisted. Like it had shifted beneath me. Like I’d been silently redirected toward a different peak entirely.

I sat at the table, exhausted, and examined the eerie little dolls. They had a crude, childlike quality—clumsy craftsmanship with tiny fingerprints still pressed into the clay. In the center of the circle was a candle. As it grew darker outside, I figured a bit more light might do the room some justice.

I pulled out my lighter, looked toward the rightmost doll... and noticed it was facing away from the center.  
“Huh. Could’ve sworn you weren’t looking that way,” I muttered.

Curious, I followed its gaze to the darkest part of the cottage—the far-right wall, draped in a large, dark tapestry that touched the floor.

And then I saw them.  
A pair of pale feet, just barely peeking out from under the curtain.

My heart stopped.

I froze. Every instinct in my body screamed at me not to move. A sudden chill gripped me—so complete and primal that even blinking felt dangerous. And then... a sound.

A low hum, soft at first. But growing louder. Closer.

I stayed locked in place, eyes fixed on the feet. My breath went shallow. Sweat pooled on my forehead. I tried to speak—but before I could make a sound—

**Thud.**

I flinched.  
One of the dolls had fallen over.

When I looked back at the tapestry, it was wide open.  
Revealing nothing but an impossibly dark void where the wall should have been.

“Fuck this,” I whispered, half to break the silence, half to pump myself up to run.

I stood, and from the corner of my eye I caught movement—faint, slow, undulating. Something shapeless. Flowing. Dancing. I didn’t wait to see more. I grabbed my pack, snatched whatever valuables I’d laid out on the table, and ran out the door into the cold, rain-drenched woods.

I didn’t care where I was going—I just knew I had to move. A primal survival instinct took over. I didn’t want to know what waited in that void. I didn’t want to look back.

But I did.

Just once.

And the cottage was gone.

My sprint turned into a jog, then a walk. The realization hit me like a wave: I was completely lost, in the middle of the night, deep in the forest of a cold, unforgiving mountain.

I called emergency services. Thankfully, I had extra batteries, and a signal.

A few hours later, they found me.  
I told no one what had happened. Just that I’d gotten turned around. When I got home, I showered, changed, and collapsed into bed—grateful to be safe.

But the next morning, while unpacking my gear... I found the book.  
And one of the dolls.

Only this time, the doll’s expression had changed. It wore a happy little grimace.

I was sure it hadn’t looked like that before.

I threw both of them in the trash. Then into the dumpster.

The next day, they were back—sitting on my desk.

The book was open.

I feel like I’ve invited something wicked into my life. And I don’t know what to do.

I tried to resist looking, but curiosity got the better of me. I examined the page it had opened to.

At the top, in bold script:  
**“Gauche, the Painful Boy.”**

Below that, an ink illustration, reminiscent of a woodcut print.  
It showed a boy in overalls and pointy shoes, tiptoeing down a dark corridor. A stained sack was slung over his shoulder—one that seemed to have eyes and a mouth, subtly grinning. With one hand, the boy held a finger to his lips in a shushing gesture. The only light came from a slightly open door at the end of the hallway, casting long shadows behind him.

Atop his head sat a bird’s nest—worn like a crown. Three tiny eggs rested inside. One was cracked. The others were speckled.

I didn’t read the story. Just took note of the chapter title.  
Then I flipped to the very first page, hoping for any clue about its author.

At the center, in ornate black letters, it simply read:

**“Fairy Tales for the Old Ones”**  
**by Kaz’Oh Gor**
