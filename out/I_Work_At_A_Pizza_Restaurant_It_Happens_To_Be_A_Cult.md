Part 1

At twenty-four I didn't think I'd be working at a mom and pop pizza restaurant. I live in a small junction city with no desire to go to college. I want a better life for myself, of course, but I'm seeing where it takes me first. I know this isn't the way to success, nonetheless that'll come with time I suppose. Enae's Pizza is on the outskirts of town. Other than a rickety old gas station in front of it, the parlor was fifteen minutes away from town. Two islands of civilization in a vast ocean of trees.

The outside looked dated; from the dingy windows to milk ppl a barely legible red and yellow banner with "Enae's pizza" on it. Attached to this was an unwelcoming and tattered awning. Due to a recent storm a quarter of the shingles were missing and the right-side gutter was barely hanging on. Not to mention a couple bullet holes. Truthfully I'm not too sure how safe the building is, but I don't get paid enough to care about that. The way I see it is if something happens I'll get a big pay day. In any case there's only one street lamp to light up the parking lot. Not only was it dim, as if the bulb hasn't been changed in ten years, it was also positioned at the far right corner of the lot. It was practically pitch black at night. 

Being so remote discarded pets and wildlife littered the area looking for an easy meal. Feral cats, dogs, and raccoons were the main suspects getting into the trash. Every once in a while you'll see an odd pairing; like a rab!bit with a dog, a chicken with a pack of mice, etc... The most illusive pair is a hairless cat with red eyes that rides on a white deer with black antlers. Most go their entire 'career' without seeing them. I've been working at Enae's for two weeks and have had the misfortune of exactly that,  seeing them. It was dark and roughly 8 P.M. when I was working on the front counter, business as usual. I had just gotten done making a salad and put it on the counter when they walked up to the dining room fire exit door. Next thing you know the pasta boiler exploded on the closing manager Dianna. She had third degree burns on her face and most of her torso. Obviously we closed shop afted that. 

First walking in to Enea’s you’d see our barely functional rectangular dining room. In the middle you’ll have the displeasure of looking at our dilapidated tables that are placed from the front to the back were the open kitchen is. Most of them were off balance, needing cardboard to stabilize them. They had an ugly white, almost yellowish tinted cloth over them from years of neglect. The chairs weren’t in any better shape, they were stable enough to sit in, but the cushions were like rocks and some didn’t have a backrest. I couldn’t count the amount of complaints we’ve gotten due to this. There’s four booths on the other two sides. I call them booths, but in reality they’re modified church pews with tables in between them. Our max capacity is seventy people, not that we ever had close to that many customers though. A short hallway in the back right of the dining room were where the bathrooms are. Surprisingly the bathrooms were up-to-date and looked nice in comparison to the rest of the building. 

The back of house had three rooms: a server station, the kitchen and the back hallway way. The server station connected the front and back of house. It was a small bracket shaped room bisected by the back wall of the dining room that separates it from the kitchen. The server station is barely able to fit two people at once. Mainly this is due to the built-in desk that holds two POS screens and a computer for the servers to place orders and managers to run reports respectively. The shelves underneath hold a slew of items such as a printer, first-aid kits, receipt paper, a lost and found basket, and other miscellaneous items. 

Walking through the server station you’re immediately confronted with the server cart that holds the dirty dishes. Behind the cart lies the salad station and front counter. Walking into the kitchen proper, on the left hand side of the kitchen there’s the ice machine and drink station, past that is the kegerator, sliding refrigerator and the drink machine's syrup storage. The back of the kitchen has the prep table that sat parallel to the sliding refrigerator. This was attached perpendicularly to the pizza line, the oven and the pasta station respectively. In between the front counter and the oven lies the expo table. 

Behind the prep table is the door to the exterior walk-in refrigerator. Looking to the right is our cramped back hallway. Lining the right side is the dough station that holds the pizza roller, a dough mixing machine, a freezer and a prep sink. The left side has two shelving units holding spices, pots and pans, equipment for catering orders and other supplies. After that the back door and then a dishwasher with a three compartment sink attached to it. Both sides have hanging shelves high above the all of the equipment and machinery. The dish pit wreaked of mold with gnats flying around making whatever morsel of food left behind their home. The owner’s, Ryan and Louisa Fields, said that they hired a new dishwasher to solve this problem. I don’t believe them. I’ve scrubbed the back hallway with bleach for a week and they still survived. 

Today starts my third week as I pulled around the back of the restaurant. I expelled a sigh of relief when I saw Carson’s 2004 Toyota Corolla. He’s the cool manager, allowing everyone to get away with whatever they wanted as long as they were done by closing time. I got out of my Nissan Rogue with my bag when I had noticed that the exterior walk-in had new dents in it from this morning. At least once a shift somebody will walk outside and use it as a punching bag. It’s not acceptable of course, but it’s better than punching the wooden boards out of the wall surrounding the dumpsters. That employee got fired.

“Carson! What’s going on man?” I yelled happily walking in the back door. Not hearing a response I walked through the flour ridden back hallway without setting my backpack down. Usually I put it on the flour rack underneath the pots and pans and across from the dough station. A crescendoing chant began as I turned around the prep table. 

“Sacri-slice! Sacri-slice! Sacri-slice!” Carson, His server girlfriend Holly and the host Kyleigh yelled. All throwing up their hands and laughing as I looked at them. 

“What’s a ‘sacri-slice?” I asked in bewilderment as they began cackling once more. 

“What’s a ‘sacri-slice’?” He said with a wide grin. “It’s when we have left over slices from the morning shift and throw one of them into the oven repeatedly till the end of the day. It's a ritual we do for the pizza gods,”

“What the fuck man,” I said laughing. “It’s burnt as hell,” the slice of pepperoni pizza was pitch black. The edges broke into a thousand little crumbles as he put it back through the oven. 

"Its not yet,” he said before dapping me up. “How are you today?”

“I’m alright. Where am I at today?” I asked while pouring some tea from the urn. The soda is undrinkable here, I don’t know if it’s the machine or human error. It's either flat or the machine is spewing out too much syrup. Customers and other employees alike, oddly enough, don’t seem to mind. So maybe I’m just sensitive to our machine. 

“You’ll be on pizza with Marcus tonight,” he said before walking away and preparing the pasta line for the dinner rush. I had an hour to kill, and after I washed my hands, I figured I’d roll some pizza dough, what we call skins. Like most places we sell small, medium and large pizzas. I grabbed four racks, two for the smalls and two half-and-halfs for the mediums and larges. I set them on the prep table and took a swig of my tea. Rolling skins is a pretty easy yet time consuming job. 

The best part was that you could play music or listen to a podcast while doing it. Playing boring documentaries and trashy music will get you made fun of here. Something that boils the blood of the younger employees here. Not that my music taste is bad, but I decided to lose myself in thought instead. I had only awoke from my trance when Marcus tapped me on the shoulder. He had said my name three times without me acknowledging it. Granted I really hadn’t heard him, this place does that to you. Anytime I start working I get stuck in a drug like dazed state. Some days are just a blur until we’re closed. You could write it off as the job being mundane, but I don’t think that’s the case.

“You’ve rolled enough skins for the night. Do you want to see something crazy?” Marcus asked in a concerning but excited voice. As if he didn’t know whether to be proud or ashamed of what he was about to show me. Of course I agreed. Nothing could shock me, I've seen everything on the internet. From beheadings to 'running the guantlet' to live exorcisms. 

“You’re gonna freak out when I show you,” he said hurriedly walking out of the restaurant as I followed. I could barely keep up as he stormed across the thirty foot back parking lot. He stopped at the edge of the lot lined with bushes. We were situated at the top of a steep hill. It was only twenty feet down, but had a fifty degree slope if I had to guess. 

“Follow me,” he said while strategically descending the hill. Every step was calculated, one wrong move and you’d likely break an arm or leg falling down. Jagged rocks and tree stumps darted the ground. 

“Ryan told everybody in our last meeting not to go down there. It’s a safety hazard and we could get lost in the woods,” I said as he was reaching the bottom. 

“Do you really think Ryan cares about us?” He retorted. “He came in after Diana got burned right?” 

“Yeah, but has anybody heard from her? It’s been a almost week since then,” he was at the bottom of the hill now signaling me to come quickly. I obliged and carefully walked down to him. “All I’m saying is something weird is going on here. We’ve both lived here all our lives and have always been told not to go into these woods,” he said as we were approaching the tree line. Dense vegetation hindered anyone trying to get into the forest. 

“It’s a forest man!” I said annoyed. “There’s predators in there and if they don’t get you. You could get lost easily.” “Maybe you’ve never tried to explore these woods, but I have. No matter where you’re at the brush is so thick that it’s almost impassable. Even if you get ‘through’ you’ll just come out where you started. This is the only place where you can walk in unimpeded with a trail,” he said with a wild look. A certain fog came about me, had I also experienced this? As kids my brothers and I never went camping or exploring in these woods. Our parents always took us elsewhere for those activities. In the twenty-four years I’ve lived here I haven’t heard a single story about traveling through the woods. 

“What’re you trying to say? That we go and explore?” I said before checking my phone for the time. “We have five minutes till we open, we gotta get inside. We can talk about it later,” 

“Something is denying us access to these woods and I’m going to find out why. I believe it has to do with Ryan and Louisa,” he said before walking up the hill. I wondered why he had confided in me but I didn’t care to ask. We hadn’t known each other long, he was a good guy, however we were nothing more than work acquaintances. Stunned by all of this information that I woefully wasn’t ready for, I admit, I hadn’t moved. Maybe I should help him with his little mission, at bare minimum I can prove him wrong and that he’s delusional. 

A minute or two passed before being startled by Marcus yelling my name. I came to and got up the hill quickly. Marcus opened the back door and we began making pizzas. We had two orders: a large supreme pizza and a medium wild-game pizza. The owner being a prolific hunter decided to add wild-game to our meat toppings. Today it was rabbit, tomorrow it might be duck and the next deer. He prepares the game meat early in the morning before anyone is there. Which is fine by me, I can only imagine the smell of the leftover carcasses have to be horrendous. Luckily I've never had to discard any of them.

The shift went by pretty quickly. We had one hiccup at 7 p.m. today. A regular customer named John complained about his chicken alfredo again. He believed that the julienne cut chicken breast were fingers. He’s an older veteran who was supposedly tortured by the Vietcong and forced to eat his fellow soldier’s fingers. He was sent in a frenzy, grabbing his fork and almost stabbing Kyleigh. Carson, hearing the commotion prior to the attempted stab, was there to disarm him and throw him out. I knew he was strong, but John didn’t touch the floor till he hit the pavement outside. Panicked and going through a PTSD induced manic episode he ran to his car and escaped our ‘concentration camp’. The crowd cheered for Carson as he went back to work after checking Kyleigh. 

“Should we call the police?” I asked Carson. 

“No. We never call the police. I’ll let John and Louisa know about this,” he said angrily at me. He seemed more mad at my question than the guy who almost stabbed our coworker. I let it go as he's usually the happy-go-lucky type and that might've been his way of coping with the stress.

A few hours went by and 9:00 p.m. rolled around. This is when we closed for the night. Shutting down the pizza line is easy. We're asked to only clean it and the prep table. Coincidentally we always run out of ingredients on the line by the time we close. We're not allowed to restock at night,  something about it being Ryan's job in the morning. It was a slow night and we all had gotten our closing duties done within thirty minutes. Carson and Holly were sitting at one side of the dining room, Kyleigh and her boyfriend Aspen on the other and Marcus and I at a table in the middle.

"Anybody want a shot?" Kyleigh screamed over Marcus' speaker playing Alice in Chains. She pulled a bottle of generic vodka out of her purse and waved it in the air before coming to our table. Aspen followed after checking his phone.

"You know what we have to do," Carson said bleakly while pointing at the light switch. "I don't want somebody from the gas station looking in. Turncthe dining room lights off. They've had it out for us for awhile now," Carson and Holly got up and sat at the last two chairs of the table. Marcus, being the closest to the switch in the server station, got up and turned them off. He grabbed six plastic ramekins from the salad station and sat down. It would be pitch black if not for the kitchen lights bleeding through the server station and the counter. 

"Anybody have a blunt or a bowl packed?" Aspen asked. Marcus, probably the biggest stoner I've ever met, took a mason jar out of his bag excitedly. Opening the jar he picked out one of fifteen joints and sparked it. He took a deep inhale and passed it to Aspen on his right. That was the start of rotation: Marcus, Aspen, Kyleigh, Holly, Carson then me.

"I'm not much of a smoker so pour me a shot," I said truthfully. Thinking how crazy it is being able to drink in front of my boss at work. I don't know if I'll ever get used to it. Kyleigh poured a shot for everyone. After a quick toast we all drank the burning elixir. 

"Jesus, why do you always get the shitty liquor? You need to get some bourbon," Marcus said and grabbed a handle of bourbon out of his backpack. 

"I don't care as long as I get a buzz," Aspen said wiping his already watery eyes. The liquor hit him the hardest, as he rarely if ever drank. After passing the blunt to Kyleigh he grabbed the bottle and took a long swig. His flushed rosy cheeks told me everything. Kyleigh, Holly and Carson took their hits quickly. Carson passed the blunt to Marcus

"Marcus why don't you give everybody a shot so we can compare them," I said jokingly. Everybody chimed in with me asking for shots.

"Let's take a gauntlet," Marcus said holding the blunt in his mouth. After pouring the shots he took a hit and held it in till he swallowed the bourbon. He slammed the plastic ramekin on the table crushing it.

"I'm not taking a gauntlet where I don't smoke but I'll take a shot," I reiterated. Aspen quickly took his gauntlet, almost throwing up in the process.

"You work at a restaurant and don't smoke? That's wild" Kyleigh said before taking her gauntlet.

"It gives me anxiety to be honest, I used to be a heavy stoner in high school," I shot back. Carson and Holly took their gauntlet and passed the blunt back to Marcus. I pointed at the bourbon while he took the last hit. He nodded and i grabbed the bottle and chugged a mouth full. 

"Baby, why d-d-don't you pour a-a-another shot for all of us," Aspen slurred. I didn't think it was a good idea, but I'm not going to say no to free drinks. Kyleigh looked concerned but did it anyways. We all took it quickly, everybody was buzzing at this point.

"Hey I gotta question?" Kyleigh asked excitedly. "Do you all wanna conjur spirits. I just bought another ouija board and candles," she said grabbing them out. The whole table stopped. We all knew she dabbled in Wiccan practices, though I thought she was more of a tarot card reading type not the seance type. Only a second after our initial surprise the table thought it'd be fun and I reluctantly agreed. Carson giddy with excitement rushed to turn the other lights off. As darkness befell us everyone's face became distorted, a crude amalgamation of human and almost demonic looking features were plastered on them. I chalked this up to being tipsy in combination with the sudden shift in lighting of the room.

"This is going to be so much fun," she said laughing. Aspen took out his lighter and drunkenly lit the candles. He cursed under his breath as he burnt himself on the last candle before slamming back into his chair. The artwork became spectacles of horror in their own right. They were never appealing in the first place, but they were terrifying in the dim light. The tainted smiles mouthed indistinguishable words while their bulging eyes followed every movement. They had razor blades for teeth and vicious snakes for tongues. Closing my eyes would reset them to their original design before the darkness would corrupt them again.

"How many times have you used an ouija board?" I asked inquisitively. 
"I lost track after twenty. I mainly contact my parents when I miss them. They both died from drug use when I was younger. As any kid would be, I was depressed, anorexic, suicidal. I just took it a bit further than most and made an ouija board out of cardboard and markers," she said with pain in her voice.

I didn't know," I said upset for even asking.

"It's fine... anyways we all have to hold hands, don't break the circle until I say it's safe!" She said in a somewhat serious tone. As instructed we held each other's hands and she chanted in Latin. I didn't know much Latin, the only phrase I understood was 'custodi nos a malo', keep us from evil. She chanted for a couple minutes before telling us we were safe to let go.

"Does anybody have someone they want to contact. Before I contact my mom," Kyleigh asked. 

"I'd like to talk to my friend Spencer Adam. If thats ok?," Marcus said. "He passed in a car accident a couple years ago," 

"Of course its ok. Everybody put your hands on the planchette. As I chant we have to circle the planchette on the board" she said and chanted. A cold chill came over me as we did it. I didn't think this was the best place to summon spirits. The surrounding forests could hide any number of evils let alone if we bring one of them here. 
"He's here. Everyone push it above 'hello'," Kyleigh said. We did. "What would you like to ask? Be mindful, you don't have to ask 'yes or no' questions. It'll be easier for his spirit to answer those though,"

"Long time no see. How ya doing Spence?" he asked. The planchette moved above 'good' and returned to the center of the board. Marcus gave a weak laugh.

"Hey do you remember the time when we were staying at your mom's house and broke the TV wrestling?" He said laughing with a tear rolling down his face. The planchette moved to 'yes'. 

"It's so lonely without you man. I miss you every day. I hope you're doing well in Heaven," he said fully sobbing now. The planchette moved over five letters before hovering over goodbye, 'I mis u'. Moments went by and Marcus composed himself, wiping tears from his flush face. Carson and Holly both looked at each other skeptically, but refrained to voice their opinion. 

"I'm sorry for your loss. Would anybody else like to summon someone they've lost?" 

"Kyleigh why don't you summon your mother? I want to see something though. Real proof that somebody is there. Not just the board piece moving," Holly said. 

"FUCK YOU," Marcus yelled. "Do you even know what it's like to lose your best friend?"

"SHUT UP," Kyleigh responded with the same vigor as Marcus. "Holly we respect the dead even if you think this is a prank. Marcus if you bring anger into this circle we'll summon evil. Now everyone look at the board and I'll summon my mother," she seethed, speaking through her teeth. With a deep breath she continued with the ritual "Mother if you're here flicker the lights," she grabbed the planchette quickly and moved it in a circle three times once again. As if in spite the spirit made the lights above the table flicker three times. The parmesean shakers levitated a foot off their table pouring out into little cheesy mountains.

"What the fuck man she's really here," Carson yelled jumping out of his chair. Holly helped him get up and dusted him off. Both were shaken to the core but continued with the game. Like them I was rattled, I have had encounters with ghosts but none this prolific.

"Mother will you show yourself as an apparition? I want my friends to see how beautiful you are," not containing her excitement she was standing now and yelling each word. Aspen, still hellaciously drunk, was fumbling each word. What spewed out of his mouth was more of a cacophony of sounds than individual words. Marcus was lost for words staring at Kyleigh as she continued speaking in Latin. 

The candles were flickering impossibly now, one moment they'd be lit and the next blown out, only to be relit. The machines in the kitchen rattled as they were turned on and off. Light bulbs bursting throwing glass everywhere.
"Kyleigh," a voice screamed. "Why have you summoned me here to this evil place," we all saw her now. Standing in the front right corner, only fifteen yards away from us. She was a shorter woman with beautiful brown hair. 

"KYLEIGH!" her mother screamed. "Why am I here?" She teleported to Kyleigh sending everyone out of their chair. Her once beautiful complexion became soured. Her eyes were crying a blackened blood, each droplet staining the white dress. Her brunette hair turned white and coarse. She was shaking violently, causing the room to swirl.

"What the fuck man... this isn't what we were expecting," Holly cried out hiding behind Carson. Marcus took his cross off and tried saying something before her mother cut him off.

"I'm not a fucking demon," she said throwing Marcus into the wall. "I don't have long before I'm forced to go back," 

"Where are you going," Kyleigh pleaded. Her pain was multiplied seeing the bastardization of her mother. 
"You all need to leave this place. Everything holy about this land has been blight-," a portal appeared with a hand snatching her by her hair. The hand was blistered and black, rotten flesh falling off with every jerk. A sickening miasma of hot smoke flooded the room now. The smell was a concoction of burnt flesh and sulphur. Choking, I gasped for air, finding no relief. My throat was burning terribly, but my lungs felt the brunt of the toxin. With every half breath I could feel my soul becoming tainted. Whoever was on the other side of the portal was filled with malice.

The struggle was exponentially getting worse. Her hair was ripping out of her scalp, blood and flesh showered her in the exchange. The hand tightened even more pulling with such vigor I thought her neck might break. The hands blood vessels grew to enormous proportions with some bursting. Mother's scalp started to bleed that black blood, covering her face fully. She was shrieking loudly as she began losing ground. The left side of her body was completely in the portal.

"Momma," Kyleigh screamed. She jumped up and grabbed her mother's arm in the nick of time. It was a torturous game of tug-of-war. Each side mustered every iota of their strength to gain the advantage. As they were able to pull out her body from the portal the scene became exponentially disturbing. The hand was now ripping the skin off her scalp whilst her mother used her nails to puncture in between the metacarpal bones. This act was able to dislodge the hand from her hair, but immediately after the hand grabbed the left wrist. The hand swung her arm wildly, knocking Aspen out when he stepped up to help.

Her once angelic skin was rotting from the inside out. Veins throughout her arm went from blue to black. This toxin reacted quickly forming boils and sores to form. The Orchestra of pain ruptured my eardrum and sinus cavity. I thanked God in that fraction of a second that it wasn't after me. I was losing my sense of reality as I hit the floor. My vision blurred, but I could still somewhat see the glaring red 'exit' sign. It's only ten feet away, but that might as well be considered a mile. My whole body burned and I couldn't stop heaving. We were all dying on the floor except for Kyleigh miraculously still fighting. In my delirious and weakened state I looked out the window to see a beautiful white light shining through. 

I thought it was a car until the smoke was funneled back into the portal and I saw the deer and cat. They were starring at the portal with their bulging eyes glistening in the lowlight. I stood up anchoring myself with the closest chair. I couldn't stop turning my head back and forth watching both sides of the fight. A strong tug broke the hand's grip.

"You'll be my slave soon," the disembodied voice screamed before the portal closed. The hand was cut off and disintegrated, fully turning into dust right before it hit the floor. 

They cried in each other's warm embrace returning her mother's luster. Her skin turned a natural hue and the white coarse hair went back to brunette. She cried actual tears instead of blackened blood. It brought a tear to my eye as I was never close to my mom.

Everyone but Aspen regained their consciousness. It took everything in me to help Marcus to the table. The other's slowly took to their seat. Most of us were to weak and confused to do anything else. 

"I'm terribly sorry for scaring you all. Especially you," she said looking at Marcus. He accepted her apology with a nod and a thumbs up before laying his head on the table. Mother lifted her hand and the dining room was cleaning itself. All of the parmesian went back into their shakers. Chairs were set, the glass from the light bulb flew into the trash with new bulbs replacing them. It was as if the past five minutes hadn't happened.

"Oh my God, Aspen," Kyleigh said releasing her mother and rushing to his aid. She shook him violently screaming his name over and over.

"I'm fine I promise. I've just been laying here taking a nap," Aspen said, trying to look cool in front of her. With her help he sat at the table with the rest of us. He was exhausted and looked older than his age. Not that any of us didn't, not with what just happened. 

"Who was that?" Carson asked softly.

"I don't know his name. Though he's pretty much the king of Purgatory. With his word you can be sent to Heaven or Hell. But he hasn't sent anyone to either place in centuries. He's a sadistic man who loves to punish souls who don't follow his rules,"

"What did you do to make him come after you? Will he come for you again?" Kyleigh asked worried.

"We made contact to many times. The limit is three, I've been running from him ever since our fourth séance,"

"I'm sorry Momma. I've really missed you throughout the years," she said disheartened. 

"No baby, I wasn't there for you in life so I'll be here for you in death," she said before addressing everyone. "He's been weakened. I don't sense him anymore. If it's ok with you all could I stay here and help out for the time being,"

"Why not?" Carson said while shrugging. "Just don't scare the customers,"
