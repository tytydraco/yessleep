Back when my mama was still alive, she used to tell me, “Son, if it wasn't for bad luck, you’d have no luck at all.” 

If you were to take one look at me when this all started—all of twenty-five and limping down the sidewalk to the local shithole bar called The Rusty Nail—you’d be inclined to agree.

One thing to know about my bad luck was that it liked to stalk my firsts. 

Mama, she called it “the curse of the firsts.”

My first words were “uh oh”. 

My first steps saw me toddling right off the front porch, where I broke my first bone.

My first tooth I ever lost, I aspirated the damn thing right into my windpipe. I can remember my mom’s screams as she dangled me upside down and pounded the hell out of my back, the little enamel shard finally exploding out of me into a puddle of bloody phlegm. 

After my first kiss, I caught the worst case of herpes you ever saw. My lips looked like raw, crusty hamburger meat. 

The first time I got drunk, that was a two-fer. It happened to coincide with my first vehicle, the week I first got my driver’s license. My first car was totaled. A DUI. I bummed rides and rode the bus for the rest of high school. 

The first time I ever got laid, I knocked the ol’ gal up. It was one of them forbidden high school romances that go hard and fast. We’d used a condom and everything, too. But the damn thing broke, and of course she wasn’t on the pill.  

Marissa was her name. She was literally from the other side of the tracks. The *right* side. Not the wrong side, like me. I guess that had something to do with what her dad had to say to me when he found out.

She called me with the news, how she was 4 weeks late and just had this bad feeling. How her friend had bought a slew of EPTs, how she had two lines on the piss test, how she had checked it multiple times. 

Ever the supportive boyfriend, I headed over to her place as soon as I could. Being as our love was frowned upon by her mom and dad, maybe this wasn’t the best of ideas. Maybe we should’ve arranged for a secret rendezvous. But the situations was dire.   

I was greeted at the door by her old man. An intense fella that looked like he’d played football in high school and could probably break me in half. 

He lit into me, fists clenched at his side, a big bulging vein snaking across his forehead. Read me the riot act about how dare I and how could I and what was I thinking and did I ever even read what the bible had to say about sex before marriage and his daughter was ruined and it was my fault.  

“No daughter of mine is gonna end up poor white trash,” he said at the end of it all. 

At the time I wasn’t sure if he was implying that a teen pregnancy would confine her to such a fate or that marrying *me* would. But being as I now live in a trailer house, maybe it was the latter. 

He pulled her out of school and I heard they took care of the pregnancy as soon as they could. 

They moved out of state and I never saw her again.

I loved her the way only a teenager within the grips of his first love ever could.

I’ve been scared of girls ever since. 

Because what if the next time is worse? 

What if the curse has my firstborn in its crosshairs (cause maybe fetuses don't count)?

I graduated high school by the skin of my teeth, entered the real world. Floated around for a while until I found a decent job at a roofing company. It was hot as balls and a lot of hard work, but it was the best paying gig my unskilled ass could find. Easy to pick up after a while, too. 

Before I knew it, I was one of the company’s favored employees. There was even talk about making me foreman, provided I kept up the good work and stuck around long enough and worked on my Spanish.  

But was it any wonder the first good paying job I ever had got fucked up too?

I was humping a couple bundles of shingles up the ladder on a two-story house. It’s only in hindsight I remember the empty bottle of Gatorade on the concrete below, the one that had blown off the roof and had gone tumbling down, spilling its contents all down the ladder’s top steps, the steps where I slipped. 

Nothing slowed my fall. I hit the concrete feet first. A shard of bone jutted from shin and I can still remember its wet, jagged edges staring up at me before I puked and passed out. 

The repair of my shin and ankle required plates and screws. 

My first ever surgery.  

You know where this is going. 

I developed something called a hardware infection, and from there, sepsis. Fevers and delirium and crashing blood pressure and weeks in the hospital on IV antibiotics and undergoing more surgeries on my wasted ankle. 

I damn near died. 

This older nurse at the hospital named Nancy, she took a liking to me, some sort of mother hen instincts taking me in. She must’ve felt bad as I had no visitors. Mama had been dead a couple years at that point and there was no one else, not really. A few guys from work came by after I first got admitted, but other than that I was all by my lonesome. 

Nancy would stay up late and talk with me, tell me how she was gonna set me up with her cute little niece. She’d bring me McDonalds and Mountain Dew and magazines. She had a grown son that was no longer talking to her, so maybe I was her adopted son for the time being.  Most importantly though, she put me in touch with this personal injury lawyer guy. 

Long story short, the suit was a success. Even after the lawyer’s cut, I was still left with more money than I knew what to do with. Still, I’d have traded it all back in a heartbeat for this to have never happened in the first place. 

No splashy purchases for me. I decided to hunker down with my little windfall and figure out a way to make it stretch as far as possible. 

I moved out to this single-wide on the backside of this old guy’s acreage. He cut me a helluva deal as long as I checked up on his horses from time to time. It was all I needed, the perfect place to hide out while I nursed my physical and mental wounds. 

Looking back, living out in that trailer house was the easiest time in my life. Days passed by in a blur of simple routine and laziness. I subsisted on frozen TV dinners and cigarettes and cases of Natty Light. Every morning I’d wake up and zone out for hours in front of the 3 or 4 basic channels that I could pick up on the antenna that was mounted on a pole next to the trailer. I’d stock up on DVDs from the library, sometimes hit up the Redbox at the Wal-Marts if I was feeling fancy. 

I’d end the day on the rickety and splintered deck that served as the trailer’s back porch, nurse a beer and cig while I watched the sunset and listened to the frogs and the crickets and the coyotes, all the time telling myself, “Just a few more weeks of this and I’ll get my shit together. All I need’s a little more time.”

Bill, the hunchbacked old man I was renting the trailer from kept to himself mostly. I never even saw him ride his horses, but he’d shuffle out and stare at them when I was out there feeding them, tell me how the mare used to be a real wild bitch until he broke her. He liked to wear a shiny belt buckle as big as a dinner plate, something he probably won at some rodeo. But his riding days were over. I doubt he could’ve hopped on a saddle even if he wanted to.

Lest I got too isolated, I made sure to drop by The Rusty Nail a few times a week. It was this shitty little bar a few section lines away from me on the outskirts of town, nothing more than a sheet metal building in a gravel parking lot. Inside: fake wood paneled walls adorned with neon beer signs and puncture wounds from stray darts. A concrete floor with a couple of crooked pool tables. 

You could drink at home for cheaper, sure, but not by much.   

I’d hang out at the bar for a few hours, soak in the conversations that were happening around me, shoot the shit with whoever was working the bar. 

Enter Rodney.

Like myself, he was something of a regular. We got to know each other over a string of tipsy afternoons. He claimed he had known my mom, told me how he’d even tried to date her back in the day, but she’d always shoot him down.

“She told me she had a thing against roughnecks,” he said.

“Figures. My dad died in an accident on a rig,” I said.

“Damn. I’m sorry. Oilfield about killed me, too. Back and neck’s all fucked up. Hell, I’m collecting my SSI right now. You hang around long enough, I’ll show ya how to get it. All the right things you gotta do and say.” 

“I was thinking of looking for a job eventually.”

“Hell, son. You can’t even *walk* right.”

“Maybe a greeter at Wal-Mart, then,” I said.  

“There ain’t enough Wal-Mart greeter jobs in the world for all the cripples out there. Believe me, I looked.”

I’d done the math and I was gonna run out of money eventually, even though it was five or six years down the road. It might be nice to have a backup plan. I decided to hear him out. Whenever Rodney dropped by The Rusty Nail, I’d chat him up. 

After a while, I reckoned that Rodney fancied himself as some type of father figure to me. 

He certainly didn’t look like any type of daddy I’d wanna claim. 

There was something bulldoggish and mean about him. A barrel chest that sprouted thick arms that ended in callused mitts. He had one of those faces that looked permanently sunburned, his skin the same red complexion no matter the time of year. The stubble on his face was always the same length, like it had decided to stop growing, looking like spilled salt scattered on a red countertop. Slicing through the salt was a narrow mouth, fixed into a constant scowl (except when he was laughing at the expense of someone else, and then it would crack open to reveal two rows of perfectly spaced smaller-than-average teeth).

I could never imagine him sitting in the stands of a little league game, unless he was about to brawl with the umpire over a missed call.  

And I don’t think it was common for dads to take their sons backroading, hours and hours spent kicking up gravel dust and drinking beer from cans, the empties piling up at our feet, chuckling metallically as they skittered around the floorboards.

“That shithole gets depressing,” he’d say about The Rusty Nail. “The barstools hurt my back. I need my sunlight.”  

Somehow I fell into this routine. He’d pull up in his Chevy C/K without any advanced notice, lay on the horn until I staggered from my trailer and out into the blinding sunlight. 

This is where I learned about his alternative sources of income. For his bad back Rodney got a hundred and twenty norcos a month and sixty Oxycontins. He even convinced his doctor he had anxiety and got ninety Xanax a month as well. 

Despite his reported bad back, it never seemed to slow him down any. He never limped, never stooped over, never groaned when he tossed the ice chest into the back of his truck.

He’d sell his to several guys way out in the boondocks, meth heads and dopers with piles of rusty car parts in their overgrown yards, stolen trailers pulled out back. 

“You ever get meds for your thing?” Rodney said one day, gesturing a beer toward my ankle.  

“My ankle? Like for pain?” 

“Yeah.”

I had dozens of pill bottles in my medicine cabinet. The ortho doc had felt bad about my multiple complications and had kept the pain pills coming without me even really asking for them—a bangload of percocets at first, followed up by plenty of norcos. I had never liked taking medicine, especially not after what had happened to my mom.

She’d gotten the fuck knocked out of her while parked at a stoplight, got strung out on pain pills for a couple of years, would nod off at the dinner table, droopy eyes and mouth half ajar, her speech slurred. 

The coroner figured that she had been dead for hours by the time I found her on the couch that Sunday evening. You could tell, he said, by the purplish color on the bottom half of her thighs. It was ruled an accidental overdose. 

At the time It didn’t really occur to me that perhaps I could be complicit in something seriously fucked up, redirecting my own pain pills for somebody to OD on. I was so passive at this point in my life, going with the flow of whatever the universe threw at me. It was how I’d ended up riding around with Rodney in the first place, why I kept getting those prescriptions filled. 

Most days were spent driving around with no real destination in mind. Skynyrd and Metallica always on the radio. Rodney talked a big game about fishing, how he knew a few killer spots, but we never went. 

Lots of times we ended up at Mandy’s place. She lived in a trailer at the bottom of a bottom, bordered on both sides by red dirt hills that had been washed away,  a pump jack and tank battery nearby.  

We'd sit on her front porch that was welded out of steel pipe and scrap wood, smoke Mexican brick weed/schwag. This was back before the medicinal laws made it where could buy pot on any corner.  

Looking back, she was probably more attractive than I give her credit for. At the time, she kinda looked too old for me, a former beauty past her prime. She’d come out on the porch barefoot, cut-off denim shorts and a sports bra. Midriff always exposed, the skin of her stomach was loose and criss-crossed with the faint lines of old stretch marks, put there by the kids she no longer had custody of.  The only thing she was fit to take care of nowadays was a blue pit bull, his head a grinning gray jack-o-lantern while he tried to hump my leg. 

Inevitably I’d be left on that front porch while Rodney and Mandy disappeared back into the trailer, try to tune out the noises they made in there for the next fifteen minutes, the way her fake staccato moans were perfectly separated like the beats on a metronome. 

Rodney always left that place happy, a spring in his step. We’d hit the road. There were more beers to be had. 

“She’s never gonna get her kids back, she keeps it up,” Rodney said one time after we had left. “Saw a little baggy of syringes by her nightstand. Said it was for her diabetic nephew. Psh. She ain’t got no diabetic nephew.”

“I don’t think she even wants them kids back. They’re probably better off,” I said, backwashing my beer back into the can. It didn’t taste right anymore.

“No joke.”

“Hey, you ain’t worried about catching something from her? All them needles and shit?” I asked

Roy just shrugged and cracked another beer, turned up the radio. Instead of the usual Metallica, a lone fiddle started playing over the stereo. A loud mournful twang.

“Fuck is this shit?” he said, twisting knobs and pounding the dash. 

The fiddle continued into a burst of static. 

A voice cut through. For whatever reason, we both sat transfixed, listening to this cartoony guy spout off nonsense.

*Good afternoon my little layabouts! And what a lovely afternoon it is. It’s the kind of day where you don’t clock back in after lunch and spend the rest of the afternoon playing hooky down at the ol’ fishing hole. What better way than to forget about a crappy mess at work than to catch a whole mess of crappie, am I right?*

*But then again, maybe you two fellas don’t know much about that, given your current situation. Far be it from me to judge. Ol’ Bucky never found a loophole he didn’t like and he certainly never liked working for the man and helping him get richer.* 

*All that said, there’s something to the purpose of an honest day’s work that makes you stand a little taller and piss a little straighter. Find* something *you can believe in and set off towards it, steady as a herd of turtles.*

*Speaking of turtles! That reminds me of today’s rule of the road.* 

*Turtles are important. Did ya know that many cultures believed that the very world itself balances itself on the back of a giant turtle? It's what keeps the Earth from plummeting into oblivion. But what about the giant turtle itself? What keeps it from falling? Why another turtle, silly. An below him, another! It’s turtles all the way down.*

*So with that background, on to the rule of the day. If at any point during your journey, were you to come across one of our slowpoke four-legged friends crossing the road, then you must pull over and help said shellbacked reptile get to the other side.*

*Now I know what you’re gonna say. You’re gonna say, ‘Bucky, I ain’t touching no goldang terrapin. Their cloacas are teeming with salmonella!’  And to that I say, woah! Who said anything about touching a cloaca? Are times really that rough? But seriously, folks.* 

*So  you don’t want to carry the turtle across the road. To that I say, fine.* Fine. *Whatever. You can have this one. You might get some bonus points for helping the turtle cross the road, but you don’t* have to\*. But I do urge you at the very least to avoid hitting the turtle with your vehicle. Swerve, straddle, brake, whatever you must, but do not hit that turtle. Or else you just might not like it when it hits back.\*

*That’s all I got today folks. Once again, I’m Buck Hensley and these are The Rules of the Road. Stay safe. Stay steady. Stay lonely.*

The car filled with a dull silence. Rodney sniffed, took a sip of beer and said, “Maybe you’re onto something. Better get my head checked for syphilis. Cause *that* was some crazy shit. Were you hearing that?”

“Yeah,” I said. 

“Good to know I ain’t the only one.” 

The day ended like so many before, an uneventful alcoholic haze, bedtime a barely remembered thing. 

It got to be where we were spending more of our backroading sessions heading over to Mandy’s place. I was getting annoyed by this routine. We’d always have a chat and a toke and a beer on the porch, Rodney and Mandy would make their way inside while I was left to my own devices, either to fend off the advances of the stupid humping pitbull or to flip the channels on her satellite TV—I didn’t even know how she afforded such a service. 

They started spending longer in the bedroom together. I could hear the low rumble of their pillow talk after they had fucked. I paced holes in the floor, pounded beers to kill the time. 

One time they’d spent a really long time in there and I pounded on the door, told Rodney I had to get. 

“You ain’t got shit to do,” he responded lazily.

“Exactly,” I said. “Ain’t shit on TV.” 

“Alright, alright. We gots us a little errand to run anyhow.” 

Then it was the three of us, me riding shotgun and Mandy riding bitch, laying her head on Rodney’s shoulder and rubbing her hand up and down his thigh.

“Y’all kill the beers you got. Gonna be going through town in a bit,” he said, patting his front shirt pocket, a bottle of pills rattling in there.

Our destination turned out to be Arrowhead Apartments, the shittiest complex in town. It sat next to a few rows of tract housing that had been built for the sole purpose of section 8. Made that place look like a gated community.

Rodney honked at a few feral children that roamed the parking lot, simply laughed when one of them flipped him the bird. He parked next to a crumbling curb. 

“Wait here,” he told me. 

He crossed an overgrown patch of grass, stepping over faded Fisher Price toys as he did, and knocked on the door of a ground level apartment. A guy in a wife-beater and a woman came out. They talked a bit and the man gestured to the apartment. Glancing back over his shoulder at us, Rodney stepped inside. 

Next to me, Mandy just smoked a cigarette, leaned her head back on the bench seat with her eyes closed. After a few minutes a little kid not more than three or four years old came outside, squatted in the dirt. 

“Fuck,” I couldn’t help but say. 

“What?” Mandy asked, eyes still closed.

“Nothing.” 

I decided right then and there I was done. No more backroading with Rodney. No more giving him my pain pills for him to sell. No more of whatever this was. There was nothing forcing me to stay like this. I’d been dealt a lot of bad hands, but I could walk away from the table, make my way through the rows of slot machines, burst through them double doors of the casino and out into the blinding sunlight. It might take a while to adjust to the blinding glare, but I’d get there. 

Eventually, Rodney made it out of the apartment with a skip in his step, tousling the little kid’s hair as he passed. 

“No lowballing” he said, sliding behind the wheel. He slapped Mandy in the face with his newly acquired money stack.

“Hey, dick,” she said. 

“Any of that mine?” I asked. 

“Shit, Evan. You ain’t forked over anything in a while.”

It was little relief. Whether I was here or not, this transaction was going to happen. Still, I’d sat back and watched.  

But what could I honestly do? Call DHS? Maybe.  

We pulled away from the apartment complex, took the highway headed out of town, before pulling off a random country road. 

Miles down the road, a mischievous glint caught the light in Rodney’s eye. I could tell he was getting looser, the beers catching up with him, delays in his reaction time. How he’d over correct when we’d be getting too close to the ditch, tires skidding on the gravel. 

“Rodney, man. Need me to take the wheel?” I asked after his most recent fishtail.

“Nah, I’m good.”

“How about you drop me off. Just gotta take a right up here and loop around across the low water bridge. I don’t wanna keep you two from doing what you wanna be doing. Third wheel shit’s getting old. I gotta feed the horses anyway.  Bill's in the hospital with his COPD.”

“I’ll swing Mandy by her place, then run you home. We gots to talk about some things,” he said. 

“Whatever.”

The sun was getting all golden. The gravel road looking like a path to a heaven none of us would ever reach. 

“Well lookie here,” Rodney said. He had seen it before me, the little box turtle plodding across the road. He gunned it. 

“Rodney. Rodney!” I was pounding the dash. “Don’t hit it Rodney. Don’t fucking—” 

The little guy never had a chance. There was even hardly a bump. I looked back through the settling gravel dust to see the turtle laying in the road, its body looking like a crumpled can of Miller. 

“Ten points,” Rodney said.

“Aww *Rodney*. That wasn’t nice,” Mandy said. 

“The fuck man? Little thing wasn’t hurting no one.”

“It’s a cruel world.”

“Let me out,” I said, my voice flat. 

“You serious? Over a little-ass turtle?”

“Not just the turtle. Don’t you remember the fucking rule? LIke I need any more bad luck. Jesus. Pull over,” I said. 

 He slid the truck to the side of the road and I hopped out without saying another word. They sped away.

For the most part, I was able to scoop up the turtle’s body in one piece. Bits of gravel blended in the bloody cracks of its shattered and flattened shell. I carried it across the road and left it in the ditch. Maybe this would count for something. 

Or maybe it was just a meaningless act in a meaningless universe. It was meaninglessness all the way down, not turtles. 

A couple miles from home a friendly farmer in overalls gave me a lift. 

After feeding the horses, I opened my medicine cabinet. There were still about five hundred pills in there. I uncapped their lids, dumped the tablets in the toilet, then flushed them into oblivion. 

I wandered over to the kitchen and heated up a can of Spaghettios, sat at my rickety kitchen table, spooning them into my mouth straight from the pot. 

Outside, a frantic honking made its way down the gravel drive. I stepped out onto my front porch to see Rodney’s truck making a sliding Dukes-of-Hazzard-style stop.

He hopped out, panicked. His shirt was covered in blood. Long lacerations traveled his forearms like a map. 

“Rodney, what the fuck?” I asked, stepping down from the porch.

“Bill got that AR handy? The one he uses for hogs?”

“Yeah, he’s got a gun safe in his bedroom. Never locks it. What the hell’s going on?”

Rodney looked down at his bloody arms then back over his shoulder, paced around in a circle. “That damn dog of Mandy’s? Went fucking nuts. We were just fooling around—still dressed for the most part—and it fucking leaps on her. Goes ballistic. This is all from me trying to rip it off.”

I looked closer at his truck. There were flecks of blood splattered all along his hood, his doors, his tires. Bits of meat and gristle dotted the windshield. “Wait, it got Mandy?” I craned my neck to look in the truck’s cab. “Where’s she at? She okay?”

Something wasn’t adding up. In the far off distance I could hear a weird noise, a steady clomping. It was unlike anything I’d ever heard, how I imagine a fleet of marching soldiers might sound, a slow-mo stampede.

I moved closer to the truck, stood on my tiptoes to get a better look at the cab. Inside, Mandy lay slumped over across the seat.

“Rodney, what—”

I didn’t see it coming. The haymaker he threw. I was out like a light.

# #

I came to on the porch, my wrists and ankles duct taped to a plastic patio chair. Mandy’s body had been dragged out into the driveway, the gravel around her wet with her blood. She lay face down, only wearing her jean shorts and a bra. Chunks of her flesh had been bitten from her thighs and lower back. One of her feet was a mangled mess, like it had been caught in a lawnmower.

The strange sound I had heard earlier was louder. A wall of noise marching down the drive. A swarm of scraping and crunching. 

“Rodney!” I yelled, jerking at my restraints. 

“It wasn’t the dog that did it,” he said. His voice came loud and clear from above me. He was on the roof of the trailer. 

I looked up but couldn’t see him, could only see the edge of the roof from my current position.

“I ain’t a total piece of shit,” he said. “I tried to save her. Dragged her ass through the busted bedroom window. That’s how come I’m all cut up like I am. Her, too. Although it’s them bites that did the most damage.”

The noise grew louder. A squirming darkness on the horizon.

“She was going down on me. I was getting into it and my eyes were closed, when all of a sudden she lets out the most God-awful scream. Something had bit her foot. Hard. She topples backward, grabbing at her foot, falls to the floor. She stands up and they’re already on her. She’s screaming louder, trying to shake ‘em off. 

“And now they’re pouring through the fucking doorway. Stacked on top of eachother, clawing at each other to get in. The big kind. Alligator snappers. As you can no doubt see up ahead.”

I looked toward the cattle guard that marked the entrance of the property. There they were, blotting out the ground with their mass, making it look like the ground was a living, breathing thing.

How many of them were there? Hundreds? Thousands? More? I could no longer see the road behind them. 

A gunshot rang out from the roof.  A turtle went airborne, shell tumbling through the air, spiraling out blood and meat from its body. The horde of snappers stopped their forward march momentarily. 

I shimmied in my chair, the flimsy plastic legs twisting every which way. It’s not like this was a brand new chair. Brittleness had to have set in during its months of neglect out on the front porch in the summer heat. 

“Sorry about all this buddy. Not like I planned to come out here and fuck you over. Soon as I got Mandy in the truck, I tried to head out to the highway. There was a fucking tidal wave of them, flying up my tires and crawling over the hood. Everywhere I tried to go—it’s just like the guy said—turtles all the way down,” Rodney said. He fired a couple more rounds. Each shot was a hit. It was hard to miss. 

“Jesus, Rodney. If you hadn't run over that turtle, none of this would be happening.”

“I see that, now. Way I figure it, maybe they’ll be happy once they get Mandy. She was in the truck. If not, you I guess. That’s two outta three. That oughta make ‘em happy. If not, can’t say I didn’t try.”

“Fuck you,” I said, rocking my chair back and forth, pulling with all my strength.

A volley of gunfire rattled twenty feet above my head. My ears rang. 

Down on the gravel drive, turtles exploded, somersaulted through the air in eruptions of shell and blood and gore.

Still they came. Their stubby arms pulled their bodies forward. Wild eyes and gaping mouths. Hissing while their alligator tails swished behind them. 

I’d seen turtles such as these before, yeah. Alligator snapping turtles, they called them. They looked mean as fuck. Weird button eyes that zeroed right in on you. A mouth that could open wide enough to swallow a cantaloupe, with a spiky tooth smackdab in the middle. 

Rodney fired some more, cursed. Soon, a magazine clattered to the porch right beside me. It was completely full. He must’ve accidentally kicked it down from his rooftop position.

The advancing tide of turtles was mere feet away from Mandy’s body. Once they got past her, it would be a hundred more feet or so to me.  

Turtle shells cracked open in explosions of red mist and cartilage. More bodies flew through the air. It was as if there was a row of landmines outlining Mandy’s body to prevent them from encroaching on her. 

But there were just too many of them.

They washed over her. Started chomping at her legs and thighs. Flesh pulled from bone. I thought the wet smacking noise would be enough to make me vomit, but when they got to her belly and the blood pooled there like a dog bowl and she suddenly sprang up like a jack-in-the-box and let out this awful shriek, that’s when I leaned over and retched my Spaghettios all over the porch and my shoes. 

Rodney let out a startled burst of gunfire, put her out of her misery. Her head blew apart like so many turtle shells. 

I was lucky I had vomited. Having my head down there by my lap made me realize how mobile I was. A light bulb went off in my head.  I was free to move my head to my wrist. Meaning? I could make like a snapping turtle and chomp away. 

Rodney wasn’t relenting now. He was firing as fast as he could. A non-stop assault of noise. The gravel driveway slick with blood. 

Soon there was silence and everything paused. I looked up from my duct tape meal. The turtles had quit moving. The smell of gunpowder and blood in heavy in the air. 

A truce?

No. Simply a break in the action. They marched onward. 

I had an arm free.

A feral scream of frustration shot out from the roof. Rodney hurled curses and empty magazines into the writhing crowds of turtles. He was out of ammo.

 The AR-15 soon followed. The stock struck the bumper of his Chevy, cartwheeled to the base of the porch. It leaned against the stairs. 

They were mere yards away and coming fast. I had both hands free, a leg. I dragged that plastic chair like a ball-and-chain, grabbed the rifle, reached down and snapped the chair leg off in a fit of adrenaline.

Popping the magazine that Rodney had dropped earlier into the magwell, I was locked and loaded. I stood up on the wooden rail of my little front porch, hoisted myself onto the roof. I didn’t need help for this part. Climbing roofs was in my blood.

There was Rodney, sitting on the corner of the trailer house, feet dangling off. He was smoking a cigarette and staring out at the angry sea of turtles with a dejected look on his face. He looked over at me, bored. 

“Well shit,” he said, flicking his butt into the turtles. “Shoulda had you bring me a beer.”

I said nothing, just shouldered the rifle and held it on him. 

The snappers had us surrounded, were clawing at the sides of the trailer, using each others’ bodies as ladders. From above I bet it looked like an ice cream sandwich in the middle of an anthill. 

Rodney stood up, wiped his hands together. Even up here with a gun held on him, he still cast an imposing figure. “I ever tell you I sold your ma her final batch? No? She didn’t have the money, so we worked out a deal. She was a goddamn whore. Wanted it in her ass. *Begged* me to do it that way. " 

The barrel of the AR-15 drooped. My arms went as rubbery as a garden hose. I blinked away a tear. It took all I had to not squeeze off a few rounds in his chest. 

But I knew what he was doing. He was trying to commit suicide by ex-friend. A bullet to the head or heart would be a much easier way to go out then being devoured by turtles. I wouldn’t grant him that pleasure. 

You may think you’re big and bad, but if someone fires several rounds at your feet, your bound to take a step or two back outta reflex. It’s inevitable.

And when you’re on a roof, you should always be mindful of your footing. I should know. 

That’s more or less what happened. 

I have to hand it to ol’ Rodney. After he fell into the mass of turtles, he didn’t go easily. He went down swinging and flinging. Even though they clung to his forearms, swinging from the shreds of meat that hung from his biceps, he still tried to take out as many as he could. 

And when there was no fight left in him, when his legs gave way and the threshing beasts engulfed him and were pleased with his total evisceration, the sea of turtle parted. They turned tail and waddled down the road. Disappeared over the horizon, the sun shining golden on their spiky backs.

I hate this next part. For my involvement in it. But what else was I supposed to do? 

Under cover of night, I drove Rodney’s truck into a remote part of Hickory Creek at the bottom of Bugscuffle Hill. This was after I had loaded up his and Mandy’s bodies to ride passenger with me. They weren’t heavy in their semi-skeletonized state. 

I set fire to the truck’s gas tank, the engine, their bodies. The nearest house was two miles away and the creek was heavy with thick brush and trees. It would be a while before this got called in.

I walked hours back to my place, crossed pastures and creeks and barbed wire. 

I feel bad for doing this. Especially when it comes to Mandy. But nobody would believe the truth and I was liable to get charged somehow.

No more disability for me.

No more roofs, either.

I enrolled in some classes at the local vo-tech. Nursing, if you can believe it. Nancy, she was an inspiration

I’ve been working five years as a licensed practical nurse, now. Gonna try to figure out how to get my RN, someday. If I’m smart enough. 

My ankle still hurts like a sonuvabitch. 

Everything else I went through? That hurts, too. 

And I'm not going to say that the pain will make you stronger or any of that other motivational crap like that. It can wear you down. Make you complacent. Make you want to hide away and give up. I know because it did this to me.

And when it was all said and done and I somehow made it through the other side, the pain didn't go away.

It is still here.
