Part 1

CW: Abusive content

When I finally awoke, it wasn’t gentle. It was violent and sudden, as my consciousness snapped back into reality. Air rushed into my lungs in a single, desperate gasp. It felt like I’d been hit by a truck. I struggled to breathe, scrambling to keep pace with my panicked thoughts. My body felt heavy, as if some invisible force were pinning me down.

For a moment, I thought I was still in the car. But as my senses slowly returned, I could see that this situation was far worse. I was in a basement, or at least that’s what it felt like. The place was incredibly dark, almost pitch black. The only light came from a single bulb dangling overhead, flickering as if it were barely getting any power.

I blinked hard, trying to clear the haze from my vision. When I tried lifting my hand to rub my eyes, something jerked it back down, stopping it about a foot from my face. I looked down to see what had caught me, still blinking away the haze. I could see something blurry and indistinguishable wrapped around my wrist. I looked down at my other hand, noticing that it was caught in the same way.

As my vision sharpened, the blurry shapes resolved, and the realization hit me, sending a fresh surge of panic through my already tattered mind.

My wrists were shackled with heavy chains. Thick iron links held me fast against the brick wall at my back, the metal pulled so tight it cut into my skin, crushing any chance I thought I had of breaking free. I yanked and struggled anyway, desperate and shaking, only to feel the chains bite down harder. With each attempt, the unforgiving metal bit down, tearing off strips of skin, leaving thin streams of blood trailing down the brick and onto the cold concrete floor.

I eventually stopped fighting, letting the chains go slack as I tried to conserve what little energy I had left. I rested my head against the cold brick, feeling the adrenaline drain away and my senses creeping back one by one. That’s when the smell hit me.

A putrid, rotting stench permeated the air, heavy with mildew and a dampness that clung to everything, including my skin. It crawled up the back of my throat, forcing me to gag, but I swallowed it down, not daring to make a sound.

I had no idea where I was or whether he was still nearby, but I wasn’t going to give him a reason to come back. Whether it was a blessing or a curse, I was alone for now.

Swallowing back the intense urge to vomit, I let my eyes drift across the room, scanning every fetid inch of the place. I noticed a slot in the wall next to me. The doors were made of metal, rusted and weathered by time, but they seemed as though they had been used recently. It wasn’t large, maybe only concealing a foot of space behind them. I figured it was probably a chute for his dirty laundry. From the looks of the place, it wouldn’t have surprised me in the least.

Squinting through the dim light, my eyes caught something across the room. There was a door on the far wall. It was old, made of wood that was splintering at the edges, like it had been petrified down there. The panels sagged unevenly, warped, and streaked with mold.

A thick, black fungus clung to the base, traveling upward through the grain, like veins through flesh. Deep gouges marred the lower half, as if something hard and sharp had struck it repeatedly.

It didn’t take long for me to realize that this door might be the source of my salvation… and my damnation.

It couldn’t have been but a couple of minutes before the sound of heavy footsteps thundered down the corridor. My eyes snapped back to the door as adrenaline-soaked panic tore through me, raising every hair on my skin.

I couldn’t see him yet, but I could feel him. A dark, foreboding presence pressed in closer with each echoing step.

I barely had time to sit up before the door creaked open and he stepped into the room. My skin crawled the moment I saw him, his face still wearing that same sick, curling smile. His clothes were the same, ragged and stained, but his eyes were sharper now, bright with what looked like an eager anticipation, like he’d been waiting for this particular moment his entire life. His gaze slowly rolled over me, assessing his prize.

Seemingly satisfied with what he saw, he spoke.

"Good. You're awake," he said, his voice relaxed and calm, as if this were a completely normal conversation.

"I was starting to worry you wouldn’t wake up. But you seemed like a tough one. I figured you’d come around. You’ve got some fight in you, Emily. I like that in a woman."

Hearing my name slide off his lips made me want to vomit. He had taken everything from me, including my name. I wanted to curse, fight, anything, but I couldn’t. My mouth was so dry that it had tightened my throat, preventing my vocal cords from functioning. My chest felt shallow, my lungs still straining to pull in enough air to breathe properly. I could do nothing but glare at him, my words stuck somewhere between my mind and my mouth.

"Don’t bother struggling,” he said, looking down at me, like he could read my thoughts. “You’re not going anywhere. Not yet anyhow.”

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small knife, holding it up in front of me to make sure I saw it. My breath caught in my throat as he took a step closer. The dim light skimmed across the blade, sending a sharp pain through my head.

It wasn’t large, but he handled it with such casual ease that my whole body trembled in fear. He twirled it between his fingers effortlessly, like a familiar toy. I could feel the intensity grow in the room with every movement.

“You see, Emily,” he continued, his voice low and smooth, “I don’t really like to hurt people. But when they don’t listen, and especially when they’re difficult, they need to be put back in line. Understand?”

He stepped closer, then crouched down until his eyes were level with mine. My heart hammered in my chest as I instinctively pulled against the chains, trying to push myself as far away from him as I could get.

‘Please,’ I silently begged in my mind, ‘Please, no.’

I wanted to shout, but the words stayed locked inside me. I was completely trapped.

His smile widened as he lowered the blade from my face.

“I’m going to be kind to you. I promise I am,” he said, staring into my eyes. “But you’re going to need to learn. You’re going to have to understand how things work around here.”

I flinched as he suddenly rose, his fingers grazing my cheek on the way up. It was the gentlest touch, but in my mind, it felt like a razor blade dragging across my skin. My body screamed to pull away, but I could barely move.

He reached out and cupped my jaw, forcing my head to tilt upward. His face hovered inches from mine, so close that I could see every detail in his face.

His skin, so sickly pale, looked as if it had been completely drained of all warmth. Thin, purple veins snaked across his temples and neck, pulsing subtly as if some alien fluid flowed through them. Worst of all, his cracked, colorless lips twisted upward into that same grotesque, misshapen smile, sending waves of nausea across my stomach. Though I badly wanted to, I dared not look away. I was frozen in terror, forced to stare into his soulless eyes.

He pulled back slightly, grinning with amusement.

“I don’t hurt the ones who make it easy,” he said softly. “But when they make it hard... well, that just makes it a little more fun for me.”

I felt my stomach twist as his words slithered around my mind like a parasite, digging in to feed on my fear.

The knife in his hand caught the dim light, glinting sharply across my face, a cold, silent reminder of what would happen if I didn’t obey.

Suddenly, he lunged forward. I barely had time to register his movement before a hot, searing pain ripped across my cheek. The blade sank in, carving a line of fire through my skin. I could feel the warm blood beginning to flow across my cheek in thick, sticky rivulets, slowly rolling down my neck and onto my shirt. I gasped, my eyes wide in shock. He was just there, the blade slicing through my skin so fast, so effortlessly that I couldn’t have stopped it if I wanted to.

Blood pooled in my mouth, thick and metallic as it flowed down my face. I summoned everything within me to keep from gagging, fighting to stay calm and bury the pain. I didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of seeing me break.

Smiling widely, he stepped back to admire his handiwork.

“See? That wasn’t so bad, was it?” he asked sarcastically. “It’s just a little cut. It’ll heal. In a few days, you won’t even remember it.”

He was right. The sharp, throbbing pain in my cheek was already fading beneath something far worse. The creeping realization that this was only the beginning settled heavily in my mind. If this was ‘not so bad,’ I couldn’t begin to imagine what he would do to someone who made it ‘difficult.’

“Now,” he said, looking down at the blood on his fingers, “let’s see how long it takes for you to learn.”

He casually pulled out a white handkerchief from his pocket and began wiping my blood from his blade and hands before tucking it away again.

I wanted to scream or to fight, but I couldn’t. It wouldn’t do any good anyway. The chains were too tight, and my body was already trembling too hard to be of any use to me. Sheer and absolute terror rooted me in place.

“Please,” I whispered, my voice crackling and weak. “Please don’t do this to me.”

He stood there, motionless, staring at me with those cold, empty eyes. For a moment, maybe a fraction of a second, I thought I saw something shift behind them. I noticed the slightest flicker of humanity spark within him. But just as quickly as it had shown, it vanished, swallowed by the vast, empty darkness he had become.

“I’m going to take good care of you, Emily,” he said, his voice soft once again. “You just need to learn your place, and it will all be fine.”

It sounded gentle, but I could hear the darkness behind it, the threat buried underneath.

I now knew what he was capable of. I’d seen the way his eyes darkened the moment the knife appeared. I saw the way he looked at me, not like a person, but like a thing, something to be broken. Twisted. Owned.
