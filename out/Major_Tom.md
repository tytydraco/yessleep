Hello to all, I need your help. I've been having a recurring dream. Yes, dream, singular. It's always the same, and it always ends at the exact same moment. I don't think I'm myself in this dream, maybe it's me in the future? Or someone in a different reality? Someone else in the future? I know that sounds stupid, but I just don't know anymore. I decided to write it down last week; (I can remember every detail, I've been having it for months now), after all, maybe it just needed to get out of my system. But after I did, the dream became way more real, more...lucid? More details came, and I just knew them intuitively. No one in the dream told me. And...I was able to hear his thoughts. Whenever I'm watching this from, whoever is on this mission...I don't know, I've always loved space, the Final Frontier, but ever since I've had this dream now all of it makes me feel so - empty. Listening to his thoughts, feeling what he saw...the thought of going anywhere but our atmosphere terrifies me now. Any similar experiences or help would be much appreciated. I tried to write all of the details as I remembered them, and the thoughts and feelings I was having while it happened, so sorry if it reads weird. I really need any help you can give. 

Kindest Regards,

Thomas Schilling,  
NASA

The snap of a camera.

The squeeze of a daughter. 

The laughter of a friend.

Next person.

Bright lights, excited faces. 

Next one. She’s pretty.

The man of the hour adjusts his gloves and moves his helmet to the other leg.

“Is it heavy?”

A glance at the gleaming white and obsidian visor. An idea came laughing to the mind.

“Wanna try it?” The ditzy brunette, the last in a once long line, gasps in mock appreciation.

“Oh my gosh of course!!”

More laughter behind the camera. She sits on the empty leg and pats a spacesuit. 

“Oh my gosh it’s so squishy!!”

Behind the camera, two black suits.

“Everything ready?”

“Everything. Fueled, prepped, waiting for launch. He’ll literally walk right up to the ship after this.”

 “And the data trackers?”

“Computers synced, Sensors primed, timers started, we’ll be able to account for any relativity- look, the time to be worried was days ago, why are you asking this now?”

“Just making sure all the variables are in control. He’s our X factor.”

“Who, the Major?”

“Yes. He’s never been to space before.”

A scoff. “And I’d never driven on a highway before I merged. He’ll be fine.”

“What about the readings we just got? Are we sure about doing this today, with that...I don't know, that anomaly?”

“All the sims came back fine, he should completely miss it. All evidence points to our man coming home safe.” 

“But no spacecraft has ever been through a flare, not like this.”

“The orbit is going directly around the anomaly, he won’t even notice it. No need to abort.”

“I’m just saying, anything can happen. We barely know our own ocean, let alone eternal nothingness.”

A shrug. “Fair enough.”

A flash, a smile, and the Major was standing.

“Thank you.” He stuck out his hand to be shaken, only to be sent off with a kiss.

“Not sure I’ve earned it, but…thank you.”

“Ready to go sir?”

“Born ready Captain.”

Two suits and a Major exit the room, and one leaves the world behind. 

\*\*\*\*

The Major stepps out of the elevator. Unfeeling steel closes behind him.

He finds himself standing alone on the catwalk to his shuttle.

Stepping in, he buckles, shuts the door to the atmosphere and braces. He was about to leave it, for the first time, and maybe even for the last.

What an unhelpful thought.

Crackling static. 

“Ground control is a go, Major do you copy?”

“Loud and clear Ground Control.”

“Major, notice anything abnormal in the cockpit?”

“Negative Ground Control, everything looks good.” 

“Copy Major, stand by for takeoff orders.”

Heavy breathing. The Major zones out. 

A new frontier was about to be conquered, in the name of science. For the first time in history, a human being was set to walk the vacuum of space for a full twenty four hours. 

In the name of science.

With nothing but 2 inches of padding between the Major’s body and infinite nothingness, he would collect the data, measure the photons, track the force of gravity, and time himself to observe the immutable law of relativity and its effects the human frame hurtling around Earth at 1,700 miles per hour. 

For twenty four hours.

For science.

Sweat beaded down. He needed to calm himself. 

“Major Tom to Ground Control.”

“Major Tom this is Ground Control, go.”

“I’m too sober for this, why don’t you send me up a drink?”

Quiet laughter. 

“Negative Major, all our champagne is already popped.”

A tense, smiling sigh. Oh well.

Deep breaths.

He thought about his wife.

He wished he was with her.

The radio reignites.

“Ground control go, systems ready. Major begin the countdown.”

“Controls are live, ignition key.”

The roar of the engines.“Four, three, two, one.”

\*\*\*\*\*

Silence.



Blackness.



Earth sparkling beneath.



A Major gripping a railing.  


One slip of the foot, gone.



One missed hand grab, gone. 



One overcorrection, gone. The void would accept the sacrifice. 



Flying over the edge of nothing gives one the impression that everything doesn’t matter. 



“Ground control, are you gettin’ this?”

“Affirmative, Major. Data collecting, stabilizers engaging.”



A slight jerk, Momentary panic. 



“Stabilizers are a go, you are free to navigate the hull. How do you feel, Major?”



Grip re-established. Deep breaths. 



“I’m OK, I’m uh…I’m getting cold, how long have I been out here?”

“Eastern time reads approximately oh three hundred, our timer shows one hour fifty-six minutes. Your vitals are holding steady, life support ready if anything happens. You’re doing good Major.”

“OK, hoo...ok good. I’m going to climb up top, take a look out.”



The frontier conqueror climbed the starboard side of his ship.



Swinging a leg over the railing, magnetic shoes hold his place on the hull.



The Major allows the Gs to stand his body upward as he watches his home.



Earth. Home. 

Shades of blue, white, brown, green. 



A shiny marble.

Everything he had ever known. 

Everything he had ever felt. 

Everyone he had ever loved, hated or had never met, living or dead. 



Miles and miles and forevers below. 



Upwards.

The Sun. 



All his light, all his hope, all the light and hope of everyone he’d ever known…every yesterday, every tomorrow we can never call our own…



Beaming mercilessly, blindingly white into a man’s eyes.



A lost man.



A lonely man. 



A worthless man?



What was it all for?

We struggle, bleed, and die amongst the dust only to find that no one was watching. 



Nobody ever was. 



Hundreds of years, metric tons of dust and dirt and war and strife, and no one to regard. Fighting against endless currents, torrential downpour, merciless elements and against impossible odds, loving, living, choking, dying, losing and losing and losing…just to find our arena was barely small enough to notice from space and our story set in a marble deep in the ocean.



This spacewalk was no win, no step forward.

This data would change nothing.

Hundreds of years from now, thousands and tens of thousands of years will press ahead, and nothing would be there to remember from our latest loss.

The continents will sink, the air will vaporize, and the marble will fall into the Sun. 

And then one day after that, the Sun will submit to the void currently suffocating the lonely man, and soon after the Universe itself will become the nothingness it filled. 

We can’t stop any of that from happening.

When it all does happen, there will be nothing to remember us.

Will my wife even remember me, or I her, even fifty years from now?

She was six months pregnant. She and the baby could die tomorrow. 

Would that be worth remembering?



What if my son should live?

Would he do something God can remember?



Will God remember us?



We’re helpless on our own. 

We are so fragile.



We can hardly breathe in our own marble. 



Breathe Major. 

Breathe.



Alarms. 



“Major!”



A forceful jerk. 



The sensation of falling.



The ship getting away.



The relentless pull of nothingness.



Breathe, please, breathe.



The tether is still attached.



Snap, Ching. A cable drifts away.



The embrace of nothingness. 



Breathe, Breathe.



Pulling, 



Breathe,



Pulling and pulling, a man is forced to fall. 



Breathe.



Breathe.



Oh God, please breathe. 



Breathe.



Gasp.



Gasping.



Gasping, struggling, pleading. 

  
Flying, spinning, stabilizing.  


Drifting, falling.



Floating, weightless...



Worthless. 



\*\*\*\*\*



“Telescope lost visual.”  
“Is he on the ship?!” “Negative, no sign of him.”  
“Is he tethered?!” “Negative, the cable reached full extension before snapping.”    
“A solid steel cable snapped?!” “I don’t know, his orbit could have drifted, it could be the force fro -”“GET HIM ONLINE, COMMUNICATIONS GO!”

“Ground Control to Major Tom, this is Ground control to Major Tom. Are you receiving?"

  


“Goddammit, Auxiliaries try general broadcast, get international to broadcast all channels. All signals - GET ME INTERNATIONAL-”

“Ground Control Major Tom - Major are you receiving?”



“Major, do you read -”

Crackling.

“Major. Major, do you read me?!”

Louder crackling.







“Give - my wife - my love.”



  








“Major, Major Tom, we lost you for a moment, do you read me?”

“We’re not getting any signals, his vitals cut out.”   
“Major, are you receiving?”

“Major, can you hear me?”



“Major, are you receiving?”

  


Major, are you receiving? 



“Not responding.”



“Oh [No...no](http://no...no/).”



\*\*\*\*\*



“Time?”

“Eleven hundred thirty.”

Drained coffee cup, pursed lips.

An unwanted question.

“When do we tell the press?”

An answerless pause. 

A captain’s reluctant sigh, an empty coffee cup.

An intern continues. 

“We cut the livestream at three hundred oh seven. The public already knows. All we can do is make it official.”

A captain nods, a friend forsakes hope. 

“Ready the press box. I’ll appear in fifteen.”

The world prepares to mourn.

\*\*\*\*\*

Spinning, falling, floating. 

Gasping, straining, turning.

Cold. Dark. Endless.

Blinding light, a glimmering object disrupting the void.

The Major’s ship peeked around the Earth. 

A deep breath, a sigh.

He was hurtling towards hope.

Across an empty horizon, a cable drifting in the nothing, a silver line of hope.

Deep breaths, anticipation…

A smile fades.

Too close. 

Clang against the ship, spinning for a severed hope, a cut.

Cold metal opens solid rubber, tearing thin flesh.



A scream. 



Life support; a suit seals off the nothing.

Losing feeling, blood stopping. 

An arm lost.

Breathe...breathe...breathe.

Spinning. 

Drifting. Falling.







Hours.





  


Getting cold. 



Give up. 



A glance at the light. 



The Sun…Bright, constant, piercing…The Sun...The Son...



My son. 



Unwavering. 



Unyielding.



Guiding. 



No giving up.



“Major Tom to ground control.”

Silence.  
“Major Tom to ground control, do you read?”  
Nothing.

“I’m coming home. Do you hear me? Does anyone read me?”

Defiant silence.  
  
“I’m coming home, OK? I PROMISE!!”

A final hope around the horizon, five miles a second.

“I AM COMING HOME.”



An arm outstretched, a steel thread coming into view again.

A lonely man, a future father. 

Earth below him, drifting, falling,



Floating, weightless,



Calling coming home.
