This is the story about how I switched sides with my reflection. This is part one of a three-part story.

 

I had been reading Creepypastas well into the night. I saw the ritual posted there. It gave clear instructions on how to switch places with your reflection. I chuckled at the absurdity of the post. I had seen other rituals before and sometimes was curious about trying one or another. Since this one was already on my screen, I decided to try it. Being ever the skeptic, I thought I would take minutes to freak myself out a little. I walked into the bathroom and closed the door behind me.

I followed all its rules:

1)      I turned off the light. I was left in complete darkness except for the faint glow of my phone screen.

2)       I turned on the hot water in the shower and waited 3 minutes.

3)       I turned on the flashlight on my phone, stood in front of the mirror staring at my own eyes, and shone the light directly into the eyes of my reflection, blinding myself as well. My reflection just stared back at me.

4)      I lay my left hand flat against the mirror. My reflection did as well.

After a few minutes the mirror began to fog up. I was no longer allowed to blink until the mirror was completely opaque and I couldn’t see my reflection and it couldn’t see me.

5)      I began the chant: "Reflectio reflectio, veni ad me, per speculum, transgredi, et mutare animam.” Over and over again "Reflectio reflectio, veni ad me, per speculum, transgredi, et mutare animam.”

 

I stared into the mirror as I said these words. My eyes burned and watered but I didn’t blink.  I stared directly into my own eyes in the mirror. "Reflectio reflectio, veni ad me, per speculum, transgredi, et mutare animam.” The steam made it hard to see, but my reflections eyes seemed darker, somehow.  Almost too dark. My eyes were hurting and I wondered how much longer I would continue with this childish experiment. But I couldn’t stop now! I wanted to see what happened next. I NEEDED to know what happened next. My head began to hurt and my chest began to feel tight. But I would NOT stop chanting "Reflectio reflectio, veni ad me, per speculum, transgredi, et mutare animam. Reflectio reflectio, veni ad me, per speculum, transgredi, et mutare animam.”

After what felt like forever I couldn’t take it anymore. I stopped chanting and turned on the light.  I shut the hot water off. I opened the door to let the steam out and rubbed my eyes. The bathroom was quiet except for the occasional drip from the showerhead. I picked up my phone.  It was 12:05.  I got back into reddit to check if I had skipped any steps.  I laughed a little at how silly I had been. Smiling, I looked back at the mirror and just for fun I said the phrase one more time: “Reflectio reflectio, veni ad me, per speculum, transgredi, et mutare animam.”

 

I turned off the light and went to bed.

 

Except, I didn’t actually move.  My reflection did.

I saw it in the mirror. Turning around and walking away from the mirror. It moved slowly. I reached for the light switch and turned off the light. The bathroom was pitch black but I could still see it. It turned back to face me over its shoulder. It smiled. The grin was too wide, too strange. His eyes stared into mine and I couldn’t look away.

 

I did it.  I was on the other side of the mirror.

And it was in my place.
