Hello!

I am a man of many interests, mainly history and anthropology, but recently I was drawn to the darker stuff, you know? 

So I went into the rabbithole of demonology, cultts etc. I didn't really believe in it, still don't know if I do, but when I told a pal of mine he contacted an old friend of his, who claimed to have had a real and vivid experience witth a demon.

I thought you guys might like that, so I asked her if I could share it here. She agreed! So here it is:







It had been a lush summer day, the purple clouds cutting through the serene blue-
yellowish sky.
 My mum had helped me unload the sleeping bag and the rucksack with  spare clothes, toothbrush, snacks etc.

Before we went to the door, she hugged me, which made me feel a wee bit 
uncomfortable. I was 14, for christs sake, not a child, so i pushed her away. She wasnt 
angry, I guess she knew that´s how teenagers are. 

Today, I wish I had hugged her longer. No, I wish she had stayed firm and hadn´t allowed
me to go.

I wasn't allowed at the beginning, but when she heard Dad would "work longer" 
because he "had to finish the project", she suddenly decided I would be allowed to go. 
He had finished the project weeks ago. He had told us.

He really was going to the Pub. Something I knew, something she knew, and, I´m sure of 
it, something he knew we knew.

I guess that, just for once, she didnt want me to hear the screams, the endless 
arguments, the sobbing... seeing her standing in the bathroom, telling me it was fine, 
that she had fallen, that I should go into my room, or, when dad hadn't been at the 
casino, to the mall.

We rung the doorbell, and a lanky man in business clothes opened the door. The round 
small glasses made him look like a teacher.

"Ah, look who it is, lil Amber. God, youve grown!" 

Me: "Hey, Mr Burg!"

Mr Burg: "Come on, go inside, they're in the basement. "

I went past him, torwards the door behind the stairs. I was always astonished by how 
neat and clean their house was. Mrs Burg was a bit of a typical surburban mum, always 
in cool dresses and with styled hair. I guess they had the money. Not that we weror unkempt, but it was like the whole house radiated... peace.

Yes, that´s it. It felt peaceful.

I heard Mr Burg and my mum talk, but didnt pay it much attention. Typical parent-talk. 
"How are you, i´ll get her at this and this time, blah blah blah."

I walked down the wooden stairs into the basement. It wasn't like a typical basement, 
more like a hobby room. There was a bar (whose contents were denied to us with the 
help of a VERY big lock), darts, a billard table and a couch.

My friends things and sleeping bags where sprawled across the floor, as the sound of 
music and the smell of bubble gum flavoured smoke hit my senses.

Kelly had gotten a Vape for her birthday.

And there they were, my friends. Jasmin, whose parents house we were at, Kelly, and 
Selin.

"Amb!" it echoed through the basement. They got up and hugged me.

"Whats up, guys?" I asked.

Jasmin:" Oh, alls good, alls good. Just that Mr. Strict locked the booze."

Me:"I mean, i guess that makes sense, we shouldn't dri-"

Jasmin:" Oh no, not you, too! Didn't even allow us a few beers. Hes such a jerk."

That was Jamin for you. Dont get me wrong, I didnt have anything against a good time, 
but I understood where he was coming from.
I didn't try to give any contra, didn't care too much in the end.

I went over to Kelly, who had cut her hair short into a Pixie Cut.

Me:"Oh, look at you! Looking good."

Kelly:" Awww, thanks. My mum hates it, though. " 

Me:" Don´t let her tell you how too dress or style! You have to be comfortable with it, 
not her."

The others agreed. Kelly seemed to truly aprecciate the encouraging words.
I lay down my stuff, sprawled out my sleeping bag and placed the snacks in the middle 
of our "camp" with the others.

Kelly:" You hear, Selins got a boyfriend now!"

Me and Jasmin:" Ohhhhhhhhh."

Selin:" You promised not to tell, you bitch!" she said laughing, hitting Kelly jokingly.

Jasmin:" About time! Come on, tell us! Who is it?"

Selin:" Ugh... Jason Ferguson."

Jasmin and Me answered at the same time :"Jason Ferguson?"

Jasmin:" The guy with the Dirt Bike?"

Selin:" Yeah."

Me:" Why him?"

Selin:" I dont know.. hes nice... and kind..."
 She smiled sheepishlly while talking about  him.

Jasmin:" When do you bring your first guy home, Amb?"

I was a bit taken aback by that. It was true, I was the only one of our group without a  boyfriend now. I suppose I just wasn't eady yet. And to be honest, that scared me.
 It  made me feel like the world was advancing and I couldn't keep up. 
I had had something akin to romance in my life before, but that was nothing serious. 
Teen stuff, you know. A card at valentines day, sending heart emojis, but nothing that I 
or anyone else for that matter, would consider a relationship.

Kelly:" Oh, leave her alone; Jasmin, haha."

Jasmin:" What? Im just asking questions!"

I sat between them, emberassed, not knowing how to answer. So I didn't. Once she 
realized she hit a nerve, she backed down.

Jasmin:" I'm sorry, Amb. You know I didn't mean it like that."

She smiled at me. And, once again, that was Jasmin for you. She wasn't cruel, just a bratty, but who wasn't from time to time at that age?

Jasmin:" And, anyway, after tonight, who knows? Maybe all our dreams will come true?"

As she said that, we all grew a bit more serious, but also... excited. I had almost  forgotten. 
But it wasn't time for that yet, Jasmins parents were still awake and we wanted to wait 
till they were asleep.

So we took turns vaping, drinking soda, eating snacks, and shittalking people at our 
school. In a way, it felt like being a kid again.

Jasmin dad came down and told us they´d go to sleep now, to not make too much of a 
ruckus, but also not too little, wished us a good night and ascended the stairs.

Selin:" Your dad's nice."

Kelly:" Yeah, i like him, too."

Jasmin:" Uh huh."

I knew Jasmin. She seemed weirdly dismissive, but may be she was just angry over the 
booze thing.  I didn't question it.

And once we didn't hear anything from them, Jasmin opened the bag, with 4 candles, a 
tattered suit. and chalk inside.
To be honest, when I saw the stuff, I grew a bit scared.
 This thing I only knew from  stupid horror movies suddenly became more... real, you know? I mean, I didnt't believe in it, not really, but I guess many of us wouldn't use a Ouija Board because... what if? 

What if, for any reason, it worked?
But as I said, I didn't really believe in it, and I wasn't going to be the one to chicken out.

We placed the lit candles in a square, one in front of each of us, and Jasmin, who had  found the ritual online, drew the smybols on the suit and placed it in the middle.
She then said something in some weird language, really unenthusiastically, and waited.

And at first, nothing happened.
And then it was like the color drained from the world.
The flames at the circle began to flare up, discolouring from green to purple to blue, as 
did the chalk on the suit.

Dark laughter and tortured moans filled our ears, and we all crawled back, as bone and 
flesh and sinew and skin begin to violently twist and break and creak within the old suit.

The flesh began to form into a crude mockery of a human being, the eye sockets and 
mouth hollow, as it writhed and blue flames sporadically errupted from the whirlwinds 
of sharp bones and muscles making it up.

Then skin formed around its broken body, followed by hair, and the rest of it clothes.

And in front of us... stood a man.

He was tall and lanky, with brown short hair and sharp features, his equally sharp teeth 
forming a smile, with his eyes laughing at us. Mocking us.


The old suit was now impecable, made of some fine brown-blackish material, neddle 

stripes and all, weird occult symbols adorning it at the sleeves and the neck and buttons.

His pants were normal, but his shoes seemed to be made of some sort of reptile leather,
with bronze or gold at the tips, shaped like skulls.

He turned around a few time, looking at each of us, and I could tell that the others were 
just as dumbfounded as I was. 

He threw his arms to the side and then put his hand on his hips, as if to say "So, Im here. 
What now?"

Jasmin:" Uh... hello?"

As she answered he quickly turned around, startling her.

Guy: "Oh, hello, darling!"

Jasmin:" Wh.... uh... who are you?"

Guy:" "You tell me! You summoned me, after all!"

Jasmin:" Ugh, ah, yeah, I guess. Guys....?"

Kelly:" Are you... a demon?"

Guy:" Depends on your definition!"

Selin:" Our defintion... of a... demon?"

Guy:" Yes!"

Now our initial shock was replaced by... annoyance?As weird as it sounds, his refusal to 
give straight answers was frustrating.

Me:" Uh... will you hurt us?"

Guy:" Depends on your definition, hahaha. No, no, I'm just kidding. "

Every move he made was like that of some actor, or maybe a ring leader. Like he was a 
comedian on stage.

Jasmin:" So... you´re... no demon?"

Guy:" Oh, no... I am." 

As he said that, his iris flaired up with blew flame and the air in the
room grew ... heavier.

Demon:" Just not of hell, I suppose. Heaven and Hell are real, this wanna-be just thinks 
he can lay claim to worlds because hes stronger than us! Im beyond heaven and hell, my
dear friends. This Lovecraft Guy had some good ideas about it, though I suspect some ofmy... friends... had a hand in his creative endeavours!"


We all looked at each other. These were two bomb shells at once.

Me:" Heaven and Hell... are real? You´re joking."

Demon:" Im a demon, floating in front of you. You tell me if I'm joking."

He had a point.

Kelly:" So if heaven is real..."

As Kelly started to speak, he frowned, and again, the whole room grew heavier, and his 
form grew slightly off. As if something was writhing underneath his skin.

Me:" Listen..." he said with annoyed undertone. "Im not here to answer your dumb 
questions. You are meat puppets, there are things that are not. Comprende?"

We nodded.

Demon:" So, are we going to make a deal or what?"

As he asked the question, I got goosebumbs. Did he know, or did he just infer it?

Jasmin:" Actually...."

Selin:" We did... want to make one. Well, hehe, we didnt think it would work, really."

He answered with a sharp grin:" No one ever does."

Kelly:" What... will it cost us?"

Demon:" Depends on what you want."

Jasmin:" We want... to be all powerful. To be all powerful, rich, beautfiul, bend reality to
our will..."

Demon:" Uh huh, uh huh, yeah." he nodded along, sarcastically.

Jasmin:" What? Are you too weak to pull it off?" 

Jasmin looked at him defyingly, making the rest of us rather nervous. Provoking a 
demon didn't seem like a good idea.

She kept prvoking him, as he stared at her with the most unimpressed look someone 
could muster. As she did, he made a gesture, and a cigar appeared in his hand, which he 
lighted with a fire he spawned at the tip of his thumb. He puffed out a cloud of smoke, 
which took the form of skulls with horns. 

I wondered if the... otherworldy and the human experience really were so similar, or if 
he did these weird little hints and gestures because we were human.

Demon:" Me? Too weak? Nonono. But you? You are."

Kelly:" Wh... what do you mean?"

Demon:" What do you have to give? 4 teenagers in their parents house, 4 puny little 
souls, and you want the world? Ha!"

He stopped floating and knelt down in front of Jasmin, then moved his face close to 
hers.

Demon:" You are small, little things. So... start small."

He rose to his feet again, and we started to ponder. What could he gives us, and... what 
would we have to pay down the line?

Selin:" Ok, uhm... what can we give you?"

Me:" Yeah, what do you want?"

Demon:" A bit of a clisheé, I know, but I deal in souls."

I became scared as he said that, even a bit offended. Our souls. Our innermost self? The 
thing that made us.... us?

Me:" We're not gonna give you our souls!"

Jasmin:" Yeah, screw that!"

He shrugged.

Demon:" Doesn't have to be yours. Those who are free for you to give are fine as well. 
Those directly dependent on you, your workers, the people who live on your land, 
servants, slaves... "

He counted up a bunch of possible relationships, and then he smiled 
devilishly as he came down to the last one:

"... your loved ones."

That was even worse. The people we love, who we trusted and who trusted us?
To feed  them to this... thing?

We were silent for a second, then Jasmin, to my shock, said something I never expected.

Jasmin:" My dad."

Every head turned torwards her.

Demon:" Oh, thats perfect!"

" Jasmin?" Kelly asked in a hushed tone.

Jasmin:" What? Fuck that piece of shit! He's cheating on my mum! She just walks around
the house all day on painkillers with that fucking smile, like a fucking ghost!"

Kelly slumped down a bit as she heard that, her initial protest vanished. Maybe her life 
wasn't as good and perfect as the initial impression made it seem.

Demon:" Yes, yes, a cheater. A dirtbag who goes around fucking his secretary,then comes home and plays house! Oh yes, thats perfect!"

As the demon recounted the situation in such a vulgar manner, Jasmin winced, and to 
be honest, it hurt me a little bit, too. 

We moved over to her, and tried to console her. As we did, patting her shoulder and telling her it's alright, he pointed at me.

Demon:" What about you? What about... daddy?"

I was surprised by being singled out that way. 
I looked away, fearing he'd Show everyone my 
families dirty laundry.

Demon:" Some dirty little drunk, who gambles away the money that should go to you and your mum. A strong woman who works two jobs tp support you, so utterly grinded down when he comes home and whacks in her teeth! 
What a pathetic sight when your  poor mum lies over the toilet bowl, puking her wretched little guts out from crying so  much.
But the worst thing? 
Sometimes, hehehe, sometimes, you despise her more than him, for not leaving, for not standing up!" 

He was now overjoyed with glee, almost doing a little dance of excitement as he 
recounted the details of my life.

My thoughts raced, but laid out like that... he did make sense. 
I wanted him gone so often, sometimes, in my darkest, most private moments, when I walked into the living  room with him passed out on the couch.... how easy it would be to... but then I didn't. 
I thought that I was better than that.
But now I realized... it wasn't virtue that stopped me... it was cowardice.
So as... as this devil whispered into my ear, I... couldn't help myself. 
I agreed.

Me: "Won't we be caught?"

Demon: " No! Thats a guarantee, my darlings. They will be goners, and you... hmmm.... 
how does eternal beauty sound like?"

Eternal beauty? What 14 year old girl wouldn't dream of that? In retrospect, none of us 
were really ugly, but to us, with our hormone ridden insecruities, it did sound like a 
dream come true. 
None of us answered, so the demon pointed at Selin.

Demon:" What about... hmm... .mummy?"

Selin:" What? No! I love my mum!"

Demon:" These two love their dads, even if they wouldn't admit it. That's the whole 
point."

He was right. Even if he was a drunk, a bastard who beat my mum, I couldn't deny it. He 
was still my dad.

 He was the man who carried me on his shoulders at the zoo, who taught me how to ride a bike, who called me "treasure", though I cringed at it since I´d  turned 11. 
Maybe thats why it hurt even more when he did what he did when he was  drunk.

I kept listening as he continued to berate Selin.

Demon:" You love her, you do. But... maybe exactly because you love her... wouldn't it 
be a mercy to... release her? The cancer in her chest has already spread, it's eating her alive. 
Let me tell ya, I've seen Ghouls in the 8th dimension looking healthier!"

Selin:" Don't talk about her that way!"

He slung his arms around her as tears formed in her eye.

Demon:" Selin, Darling, lets be real here. How often have you heard her say, when she 
thought you weren't there, or when she thought you had music running in your... very 
fashionable headphones, by the way, good tatste, dear.... how often did you hear her 
say that it hurt, that she just wished it´d be all over, that even a rabid dog would get the 
bullet.
And how often did you hear that she's doing it all... for you?
 For you, her shining star. That all the pain would be worth it if she could see you graduate, go to prom, in a beautful dress. 
Don't you think it's time to... give her something back?"

We all were in tears now, but Selin the most. She was a mess... and then nodded. 

He looked at her calmly, then pattet her shoulder and said:" You're a good person."

He unslinged his arm from around her shoulder, like a Boa constrictor realising all life 
had gone from it´s prey.

Then he looked at Kelly. We all were defeated at that point, we vdidn't even try to dissuade her from whatever he offered her. 

We were in, and odds  were, she would be in, too.

Kelly:" I, uh... leave me alone." she closed her eyes shut, kneeling against the wall.

He plunged himself next to her, like a social worker who tries to be cool, to get on her level, like he was trying to tell her drugs were bad. Though he would probably  encourage it and then sell them to her at a two for one discount.

Demon:" Keeelllyyyy.~.. what´s wrong , dear?"
Kelly:" I won't.... i won't-"

Demon:" Why? Why can't she just accept you like you are? So what if you like girls?"

We looked at her.

Jasmin:" We thought you had a boyfriend?"

Selin:" Yeah!"

Kelly:" Mum made me say he was so noone would think I´m... a "freak." "

Demon:" Dear little Kelly, my poor little freak. She's responsible for those, isn't she?" 

He pulled up her sleeve, revealing a row of scars.

She pulled it back down, then she 
looked at us. 
We didn't say anything to her

You know, I wish that we had. She now knows I accepted her, but maybe if I had said 
something right then and there, told her it was alright, maybe she wouldn't have felt the
need to go through with it like we did.

Demon:" Therapy... yelling, screaming, convertion camp. Sometimes shes so kind and 
nice, treating you like you are her one and all, taking you to the mall, to the park... thoseare days she can convince herself you aren't what she knows you are. "

Kelly:" Shut up, please... just shut up..."

Demon:" And the worst thing is... shes right, isn't she? I´m the proof... heaven and hell  are real, 
and you don't know that everything that goes along with it, in her faith, in your faith, is too."

Kelly looks at him, waiting for an answer, waiting for the confirmation she will go to hell

Demon:" Heh , I won´t either. But it also doesn't matter. Just say yes... say yes to me, 
embrace my power.... I hand them to you, dear. I will give you power, power beyond  heaven and hell, beyond judgement. You will be beautiful, free to do as you wish, free  from this feeling of the divine around the corner , only waiting for your heart to stop,  waiting for the abyss to swallow you."

Only a faint "yes" could be heard from behind her knees, her tears soaking her pyjamas.

"Great." he said as he jumped to his feet, knocking his feet together in a jovial manner.

Demon:" Ok, heres the deal. I will give you beauty, use that to gain more influence and  power. 
Once you have that, you can call me again, we'll hash out the details, and you  get something even better! Understood? Wonderful!"

He extended his hand, and a blue flame errupted from his palm, engulfing it whole.

Demon:" Come on, go on, it won't hurt."

Jasmin went first, a bit hesitant. 

Jasmin:" He's right, it doesn't."

Selin and me followed, as did Kelly, her face red and puffy.

The demon smiled while shaking our hands, and after a few seconds, the flame went out.

Jasmin:" Did it work?"

Demon:" Sure did, Sweetie."

As the demon said so, we heard steps coming from above, and a voice calling down the 
stairs. "Girls?"

Jasmin:" Dad? Don't tell me..."

Demon;:" Enjoy the show."

Jasmin:" No, no, no, i dont want to s..."

Mr Burg walked down the stiars, his business attire exchanged for a white T- shirt and 
jogging pants.

Mr Burg:" Hey, sorry to interrupt, girls! I just got hungry and wanted to go get a midnight snack! You want anything..."

We all looked at the Demon, and then at Mr Burg.

Demon:" Don't worry, he can't see me."

Mr Burg seemed a bit weirded out by our attitude.

Mr Burg:" Everythings alright? You guys look like you've seen a ghost!"

At this question, Selin began to gasp for air, and cry, as the demons laughter began to fill
the room.

Mr Burg seemed startled, so he stepped forward:
"Hey, everythings good? Sorry, Selin, i didn't mean to..." 


He turned to Jasmin and me, and whispered: " ...with her mother and all, poor girl. I 
didn't mean it."

Jasmin:" Now you're sorry?"

Mr Burg:" Hey hey hey, what's this all about?"

Jasmin:" Well, you can apologize to others, that comes easy to you, huh? But then just  lie to your own wife and daughter; you.... fucking cheater!"

Jasmin exploded. 
I understood her. reaction.
 If I had been her, in front of my father, in that 
situation, I don't know if I could have kept it together, too. 
Why was this man, why were all our parents, less sensible to our feelings than a literal demon?
He mocked us, yeah, 
he was cruel, yes,
but what he said just hit the core of what troubled us., you know?

 Between this feeling of impending doom, the demons laughter, the crying,  the guilt, the excitement, who hadn't lost their cool?

Mr Burg went through a variation of emotions on the spot. I could tell. Surprise, shock, 
emberassment, anger... a deep seated, almost hateful, white burning anger... 
understanding.

He moved his hand through his hair, and then looked at his daughter the most  empethatic and understanding way a man could muster, I think.

Mr Burg:" You... of course you know..."

Jasmin cried out:" Yes, i fucking know! Of course I fucking know!? Look at you! Gleaming every fucking day while mum wastes away! 
You think I couldn't tell?"

Mr Burg:" Your mum knows... we tried to keep it away from you."

Jasmin:" Well, you aren't fucking subtle!"

Mr Burg looked like he wanted to yell at her. Like a father who doesn't tolerate his child 
speaking to him in such a manner. 
But he didn't.

She was right.

He was wrong. 

And he knew it.

Mr Burg:" Listen... Jasmin... " he paused, contemplating his next words very carefully:

"... I... fucked up. I fucked up and theres no correcting my mistake. Me and your mum... 
we.... no, I won't talk about your mum. 
She should tell you yourself. All I want you to 
know is that, we love you, I love you, and we'll ... I'm sorry, dear."


Anger was written across Jasmins face, but I think I also saw  contemplation and fondness behind the anger and tears.

Jasmin:"Im sorry, too, dad. "

Mr Burg:" You don't need to apologize for any-" 

Mr Burgs warm smile faded instantly. He got up from his knees, and looked around.

Mr Burg:" Why is it so hot in here? "

We all were taken aback by that. We suspected it was the demons doing, I think, but the way he changed from this regretful father to this annoyed, uncomfortable dude was  weird none the less.

He walked to the heater next to the stairs and touched it.

Mr Burg:" Hm, no, normal. Jeez, why is it so hot in here? Aren't you guys hot?"

We shook our heads. 
I guess we just waited for it to happen. We could've warned him, told him, but I felt like it wouldn't have done anything. 
Also, like it wasn't our place to  tell him.
This was Jasmins deal. 
It also still felt like a dream, like it wasn't real. The true weight of our decision hadn't dawned one me, yet.

Mr. Burg began to grow more erratic, searching for the source of this "heat.", his white 
shirt growing dark around his neck and arm pits.

Mr, Burg:" God damn it, why is it... .you guys don't feel it? Why is it so hot?"

Jasmin:" D-dad."

Mr Burg:" Shut the fuck up darling, im fucking hot, oh, im sorry dear, its just so fucking FUCK-"

He ran past us, throwing up our bags and snacks, desperately searching for the source of the
heat he claimed to feel.

Jasmin tried to stop him, but he pushed her out of the way.

Jasmin:" Dad!"

Mr Burg looked at her, his small glasses half off his face, his hair dishhevelled. 
For one  second he looked regretful, and then just continued searching.

Jasmin stood up, and grabbed the demons arm. 

Jasmin:" Stop it, stop it! I take the deal back, fuck it, I give you my soul, whatever it is  you're doing-"

Demon:" No taksie backsies... this is happening!"

As he said so, a bag of popcorn appeared in his hand and these blue and red 3D-Glasses on his head.
She let him go and walked up to her dad, and as she did, he stopped searching.
He stood with his face to the wall, then turned around,  a small  smile on his face.

He walked to the beginning of the stairs, while Jasmin tried to stop him. "Dad... sto--  DAD!"

Mr Burg:" Please let go of me, dear."

Jasmin did as he said, then asked: " Are you better now?"

He smiled at her, then just... opened his mouth. He looked like his brain went to stand-by. 
He... made a weird noise, a small moan escaping his mouth, drool pooling up at his  feet.

Jasmin moved her hand to hold his.

Jasmin:" Dad?"

Mr Burg immediately went up in flames. 
Instantly. 
Starting at his center, engulfing his  body in a second. 
The heat hitting our bodies was bad, the smell was worse.
I ran up to Jasmin and pulled her into a corner with the others, while Mr Burg screamed,
flailing his arms around.

I dont know how long it took or him to stop. Could´ve been a minute, could´ve been 10. 
But as instantly as the fire had started, as instantly it stopped, leaving only behind a... 
perfectly shaped,black, human silouhette 
burned into the carpet... and a wedding ring 
at the silouhettes left hand.

We all were in shock. Jasmin, of course, the worst. 
I held her and patted her head while 
she shaked forth and back in my arms.
I had closed my eyes for the most part, but not my ears. 
Mr Burgs shrill screams still echo in my head from time to time.
 As does the laughter. 
This unhinged, carefree,  amused laughter.

You know.... I think it would've been enough. 
I mean, of course it was. 
Or maybe not,  now that i think about it. 
Maybe we deserved it. 
But either way, the demon walked up to us one last time, and  decided to mock us.

Demon:" Amber, your dad just had a broken off bar stool rammed up into his brain 
through his nose by a bunch of loan sharks.

Kelly, your mum just had a horrifying car crash. Her face was ripped off, now decorating 
a stop sign. She bled out, while her organs spilled out on the fucking asphalt.

And Selin... hahaha... no... hahaha, how terrible, what the fuck.... haha. ... no no no 
hahaha.... she just got cut up by a stalker who snuck into her hospital room hahaha no, 
how awful hahaha."

He wiped a tear from his eye. 

Demon:" Anyway... Deals fulfilled. See ya!"

He disappeared into blue flame. And that was that.

Maybe we could've done, should've done something.
 Call our parents, call Mrs Burg, find a way to... I don't know.... reverse the spell? 
But we didn't... we just curled up, and... slept.

The next day, I was greeted by a black stain in the carpet, and the 3 most beautiful  faces I had ever seen.

Mrs Burg came down to wake us, scolding us for staining the carpet and using her make 
up.
The police arrived soon after, telling us of our parents demise. 
We knew already, of  course. But it still stung.
Mrs. Burg found out her husband was dead soon after.
I don't know what Jasmin exactly told her. 
I didn't ask.
All I know is she would sometimes speak up at community meetings or the church,  rambling on about the dangers of "spontaneous combustion."

Kelly moved to relatives nearby after her mum had died. They didn't judge her for her 
love life, she said she lost that fear of damnation... for that. 
But gained many, many others.

Selin broke off contact after what happened. Walked out of the Burg's house and.... 
that was it.

What about me, you ask?

Well, life became easier in some ways, that's true. Boys ran in the doors for us, we became popular.

Mum had a breakdown after what happened. She would always tell me that she only loved him. That he was a saint. She isn't any happier than she was before. 

What can I say?

Don't make a deal with a demon. You might get what you asked for.
