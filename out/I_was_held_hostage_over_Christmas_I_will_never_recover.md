“And there you have it,” I said to the blonde woman behind me. I could feel her gun pointed at the back of my skull. “Now we both have unspeakable secrets to hold over one another.” I wiped my face, inadvertently smearing the man’s blood across my lips. “[Is that enough to let me live](https://redd.it/10ngbrz)?”

I wish I could have said that I stood with dignity as she decided my fate, staring stoically into a space where entire galaxies rise and fall without our awareness. Barring that, I would have liked say that I held a newfound appreciation for a life after coming face-to-face with my own mortality, enlightened with the knowledge of just how precious and fleeting existence truly is. 

But all I could think about was the mouthfoam and twitching and shitting the man before me had gone through before collapsing into an undignified puddle that was rapidly approaching room temperature. I knew it was shitty of me, but all I cared about was ensuring that I didn’t sink so low. 

I took in halting breaths, wondering if a bullet against my skull would feel more like a wasp or a crowbar, pissing just a little, trying to prevent it from being a lot. My nose ran freely. 

After a few seconds, I was willing to take any sort of resolution, provided I didn’t have to continue waiting. 

But I was too much of a coward to move.

The blonde woman sighed. Without looking behind me, I felt her relax. “Fine,” she breathed. “You’ve at least earned a reprieve for the amount of time it takes to walk outside.”

My breath shuttered as my nose and bladder released a little more. 

I struggled to speak.

“If you’ve got something to say, out with it,” she groaned, the tension rising. 

Fearing the silence, I forced myself to talk. “It’s – it’s almost funny… Santa’s been gone for a while now, but I think – um – I think that *this* is the scariest part.” I turned around.

I recognized the look in her face then: she was just as afraid of me as I was of her. Nothing is so terrifying as what a normal person can become.

Side by side, we walked through the sticky mess of blood, hair, and viscera that used to be our three companions. 

She opened the door, and we stepped into the world.

The sun was shining despite the fact that I felt like it had no right to do so. I blinked, trying to understand why I was seeing something familiar. A sign above the exit door read “1913 xxxx Street.” I looked behind me and saw the familiar landscape of Garfield Park.

My house was just three blocks away. 

“This is my home,” the blonde woman offered in a weaker voice than I’d thought possible. “I live in that apartment.”

Discomfort curdled in my stomach as I realized that all five of us had probably resided nearby. Dirty Santa wanted us to suffer close to home.

And so we faced a split path. The cloudless sky was the brightest I’d seen it after a week of slate-gray clouds. It was exactly the sort of thing I’d taken for granted when it was easier to look down and get pissed at an untied shoe or a flat tire, because we focus on the transient at the expense of any bigger picture. Three people would never again experience a bright blue sky, while I had decades of them before me, even if it would never look quite the same. In the end, it was the mundane things I feared losing most when I made the decision to take a man’s life in the hopes of sparing my own.

“This moment,” I responded in a trembling voice, “is everything. After that experience, we’ll never see life the same way again. We’ll take this with us for as long as we live.” I ran a hand through my hair with shaking fingers.

She looked at me without blinking. Concrete silence stiffened between us. 

“You’re right,” she answered.

Adrenaline flared in my stomach as she flexed the hand that still held a pistol.

Then she raised the barrel to her temple and pulled the trigger.

For the fourth time in an hour, I witnessed a death that was far less dignified than I would have believed. Her jaw flapped, one leg jittered, and more blood poured from her skull crater than I thought a person could hold. She foamed at the mouth and vomited while pissing and shitting. 

The kids in the park screamed. I marveled, distantly, at the years of therapy that would inevitably spawn from this brief moment. We suffer because we want to believe that life isn’t fragile. 

The blonde woman’s eyes stayed open the whole time. When they finished twitching, they were staring at me.

The police said that I was lucky to be the only one of five who lived. 

But Santa also lived, and he got everything he wanted. I suppose he was the luckiest of all. They have no realistic hope of finding him. 

The District Attorney told me that she won’t prosecute me for the man I killed. But his sister screamed that she’ll never forgive me, that I’ll never put this behind me, and she’ll never be whole again. 

In the end, we gave Dirty Santa everything he wanted: we killed each other and ourselves. He did very little compared to our own actions. I doubt he even had a gun. Our phones and means of escape were with us the entire time.

I wanted *so badly* to live. 

Which forced me to ask myself why.

I found the answer: the life I had before this guilt was pretty good. Not great, but certainly worth appreciating. I’ll never, ever have it again. Everything will be different until I die. No amount of drugs or therapy will erase it.

So I’m giving the man’s sister her wish. I can’t live with the guilt of being a murderer. I’m going to post this and then kill myself. I think I’ll use a knife in my throat. 

I deserve it.

Goodbye.
