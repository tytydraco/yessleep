I wasn’t always a man of faith. I wasn’t always the kind of person you’d look at and think, There’s a man who’s found peace. The truth is, I didn’t deserve peace. I didn’t deserve redemption. I had done things in my past—horrible things. Things that I’ve never spoken of, never confessed to anyone. I thought if I buried them deep enough, I could escape. I could forget.

But God doesn’t let you forget. He doesn’t let you hide.

That’s how I found myself in the small town of Westbrook, working under Pastor David. He was the kind of man everyone trusted, the kind of man who made you believe in something good. Something pure. I thought if I worked alongside him, if I stayed close, maybe—just maybe—I could bury the person I had been. I could push the darkness far enough away that it would never catch up.

At first, it was exactly what I wanted. The work was simple—helping around the church, managing the community programs, running errands. I stayed in the background, never drawing attention to myself. Pastor David never pried into my past. I told myself that he had no reason to.

But one night, everything changed.


It started as a normal evening. Pastor David and I were about to head to bed after a long day of helping with the church service when the phone rang. The call came from a woman, frantic, almost breathless. Her daughter, Emily, was acting strange. They believed she was possessed.

I didn’t know what to think. Possession wasn’t something I had ever experienced, but Pastor David was a seasoned man of God. He had dealt with demons before, or so I had heard. I was young and naïve, and I thought maybe this was a chance for me to truly see faith in action. I could watch Pastor David perform an exorcism. I could finally see what it meant to confront the darkness that had always threatened to consume me.

Pastor David wasted no time. He told me to grab my coat, and we were out the door.

The house we arrived at was old—ancient, even. It creaked in the wind, and the lights flickered like a bad omen. I felt the weight of the place before we even stepped inside. Something was wrong. You could feel it in your bones.

Emily’s mother led us upstairs, her face pale, her eyes wide with panic. She didn’t need to say much; her expression told the whole story. Something had happened to her daughter. She didn’t know how to help her. But Pastor David seemed calm, collected. He knew what he was doing.


When we entered Emily’s room, I froze.

She was sitting in the center of the bed, her body twisted unnaturally. Her limbs were bent in impossible angles, and her skin looked stretched too tight over her bones. Her hair hung in matted tangles around her face, but her eyes—those eyes—were the worst part. They were entirely white. There was no iris, no pupil, just empty, endless voids staring back at me.

Emily’s head jerked up when we entered, but it wasn’t the normal motion of a person. It was… unnatural. Wrong. Her body seemed to follow her head like a puppet on strings, her limbs jerking as though they weren’t quite connected to her.

And then she spoke.


“I’ve been waiting,” Emily whispered. But her voice wasn’t hers. It was deeper, like a growl, a guttural sound that didn’t belong in her small frame. It was the voice of something else, something ancient.

Pastor David stepped forward, his voice strong and sure, as he began to read from his Bible. “In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I command you to leave this child.”

But Emily didn’t seem to react. Instead, her head tilted to the side, and I felt a cold chill sweep through the room. It wasn’t just the cold of the night air outside. It was something much worse. Something hungry.

Then, she smiled.

The smile was wide—too wide. Her lips stretched back, revealing teeth that were far too sharp. Too many teeth. The grin was almost… mocking.

And then her eyes found me.


“Matthew,” Emily hissed. My name hung in the air like a curse. How did she know my name? I had never told anyone here about my past. I had never mentioned it to Pastor David. It wasn’t something I was proud of. It was the kind of thing you bury and never speak of again.

But Emily, or whatever was inside her, knew.

“Matthew,” she said again, the words dripping with malice. “You’ve been hiding, haven’t you? Hiding from what you did. But I can see it. I can see everything.”

I felt the blood drain from my face. My breath caught in my throat. She couldn’t know. No one knew about the alley. No one knew about the man I had hurt, the one I left to die. The memories came flooding back in a wave of terror. I could see the flickering light of the streetlamp, the way the man had stumbled toward me. His pleading eyes. The way I had…

“No…” I whispered, barely able to form the word. “You’re lying. You’re lying.”

But Emily only laughed. The sound was wrong, distorted. It echoed in my ears.

“You can’t hide, Matthew,” she said. “I’ve seen it all. I saw you. I saw the blood. I saw the fear in his eyes as you…”

I couldn’t breathe. I wanted to run. To scream. But I couldn’t. I was paralyzed.


And then, she turned her gaze to Pastor David.

I don’t know why, but something inside me told me that it wasn’t over. That it wasn’t just about me. There was more to this. I didn’t know what was going on, but I could feel the walls closing in.

Emily’s voice softened, as though she were savoring the moment. “But you, David… You’re the real monster here.”

Pastor David’s face drained of color. His lips trembled. He dropped the Bible to the floor. I had never seen him so vulnerable, so… broken.

“You’ve been hiding too, haven’t you?” Emily’s smile stretched wider. “I know your secrets. I know what you’ve done.”


The room grew colder. My teeth began to chatter, and my heart pounded in my chest. I looked at Pastor David, but I could see the fear in his eyes. For the first time, I saw the man who wasn’t the perfect, unshakable pastor everyone thought he was. He was just a man.

“I never meant to—” Pastor David stuttered, but the words wouldn’t come.

“I know,” Emily purred. “I know everything. You remember the boy, don’t you? The one who came to you, begging for help. But you didn’t help him, did you? You turned him away.”

David’s face twisted in agony.

“No!” he shouted, his voice trembling. “I never wanted—”

“But you did,” Emily interrupted, her voice cutting through the air like a knife. “You turned your back on him. You promised you would help, but you didn’t. And the woman, the one who came to you in the middle of the night—she begged you for mercy, and you refused her. You let her die.”


David fell to his knees, his face a mask of horror.

“I was trying to help,” he whispered, tears streaming down his face. “I didn’t know what else to do.”

But Emily wasn’t listening anymore. She was gone. The room was silent.


Now, let me tell you about the cases Emily was speaking of.

There was the boy—Tommy. He was just fourteen, his face a mess of bruises and cuts. He came to Pastor David’s church one Sunday, desperate, trembling. He was running from something—his father, his stepmother, he wouldn’t say. But he asked for help. Pastor David told him to come back the next day, that he’d pray for him. When Tommy returned the next day, the church was empty. Pastor David was nowhere to be found. Tommy vanished after that.

The second was the woman—Angela. She came one night, tears staining her face as she begged for shelter, for anything. She had been beaten by her partner, and Pastor David was the only person she trusted. But he turned her away. She ended up dead in the woods a week later. No one ever found out why she left, but there were whispers. Whispers that Pastor David could have stopped it.


The police arrived a week later.

They had been investigating Pastor David for months. They’d heard rumors, seen the strange disappearances, and had finally put the pieces together. But there was something more—Emily hadn’t been possessed. She’d been part of a sting operation to get David to confess. They had her trained, telling her everything she needed to know about David’s past. And when they finally broke him down, he admitted it all.


I wasn’t the only one living in a lie. The police had been watching us all along.


A few days later, after Pastor David’s arrest, something strange happened. I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of footsteps. Someone was in the house.

I got out of bed, my heart pounding, and I slowly crept toward the door. When I opened it, Emily was standing there in the hallway, her eyes still white, her smile still twisted.

“We never leave, Matthew,” she whispered. “We never forget.”

And now, I’m not sure who is haunting who. The past never truly leaves you. It stays with you, festers inside, and no matter how hard you try to escape, it always catches up.

The worst part? I don’t think I’m ever going to be free of it.

Because I think the devil’s coming for me again.
