I decided that I will write down all three accounts I had. I felt so much better after getting the first one off my chest that I'm willing to keep going. I'd like to thank the people who look at this for helping me work through it.

This story takes place when I was 17. I was still in the boy scout group at this time and for anyone who knows about it there's this thing we did called a trek. It's more or less just backpacking through a predetermined path. The area we decided to do this was between my house and my aunts where the first event happened, so probably a 30 minute drive to my aunt's. This was 2 years after the first account as well, so that was out of my mind. Plus this area was more mountainous and remote so running into people was not a concern.

We arrived and began hiking on a Monday. The members were Paul (17), Kaden (17), James who we had a range of names for “Argentinian”, “Painter”, etc. (he’s German), but I’ll just call him James in the story (16 almost 17), Tim (15), James’ dad, Tim’s dad, and a guide named Vicky. Generally it was uneventful. We made it to the first spot to set up camp without issue, just following shallow creek beds most of the way. The area already had a full stockpile of wood from whoever used it last, as well as a pair of boots near the fire pit that they must have forgotten after trying to dry them. By the time the sun began to depart over the horizon we had a fire going thanks by no means to myself, but Paul who prided himself in the fact that he was the best at it. Me and Paul were tenting together since we decided it'd be lighter if we only brought 1 tent and shared the weight between the two of us. We were all just relaxing by the fire until about 9 when the adults called it a night and went to sleep like responsible people. The rest of us stayed up. At some point Kaden pulled out Animal Farm from his ass presumably and read until were Old Major dies (spoiler). At that point we heard a rock land right on the ring or rocks with a crack and a bit of it split off. It was a decent sized rock, probably double that of a softball. It seemed to come straight down, or more liley none of us noticed it until it was already coming down. Based on how much of a 90 degree angle it descended at it was probably thrown underhand.

The first feeling that set in for all of us was confusion. Where the hell could that have come from? I got up and looked around with Tim doing the same, glancing in every direction. "Very funny James’ dad." Paul said in a sarcastic, singsongy tone. "Yeah yeah, James, that was probably just your dad." Timmy agreed quickly and somewhat frantically. "Well my dad's strong, but he's not an idiot. He wouldn't throw a big heavy rock at a bunch of kids as a "joke"." James retorted, slightly annoyed. "And, no offense James, but your dad isn't that strong. He's not shot-putting a rock that hard." Kaden added on, matter of factly. I kept trying to look out, but the light bubble from the fire caused me to see no more than 10 feet. I might as well have been looking into a black sheet. To be entirely truthful I was unnerved, but didn't want to show it. I spent years making people think of me as "the brave one", and wasn't trying to throw that away because of a rock being thrown. Again, looking back that was probably the mentality we all had but didn't want to admit it. I remembered a trick I learned where you could tie cans to a string, and put it around your campsite, so if any animal tries to come through you'll hear the cans. We had canned everything that night so we were able to quickly fashion one and went to put it up. I went to the boundary of the camp with Paul to string it up when we saw we weren't alone in our thinking. There was already one set up and God knows it wasn't ours. We followed around the site until we came across a worse site. The last group out here must have brought a gas can with them, because now there was one, completely flattened. I'm not an expert but those things are fairly sturdy.

Since we were all scared and trying to act tough we didn't hang on to it, but soon all decided to pack it up for the night. Me and Paul would usually chat a lot about this or that, "I got my town hall to level 13", "Woah you got who's number?", "I could definitely take a German Shepard in a fight", but tonight we didn't speak and just went straight to sleep.

When I woke up the tent was at my face. I jumped and pushed it up but met resistance. I pushed harder and felt water slowly pour off. I took a minute to gain full consciousness of my surroundings and I heard it wasn't just raining but pouring. I punched Paul in the shoulder and he awoke to the same sight. I fumbled around for the zipper and could feel a solid layer of water at the bottom of our tent, soaking my socks. I got out to the sight of dark clouds turning the sky gray. Within a few seconds I heard thunder. I counted, one, tw... "Crack". Damn that lightning is close. I could see rapid moving clouds above me and the wind was pushing the rain at me horizontally. I ran to James’ dad's tent and woke him up. Within 5 minutes we had all loosely shoved tents and whatever we could find in our bags and set off forward to try and reach the next camp site as soon as possible. Kaden in the group is Mexican and fairly spiritual, so I told him to do a rain dance to make it clear up. Clearly he needs to work on his magic as not only did it not clear but got drastically worse. We were at a point in the trail where it dipped in on either side with pure walls of trees on either side so you had to put one foot directly in front of the other to move. From the trees forming walls on the left and right, and the rain blocking vision in front you maybe had a 5 foot vision in front only. I should mention I am a fast walker and was at the front of the group with Kaden on my heels. I turned back after a few minutes of setting off to notice It was just me and Kaden. I looked down and there was no path to be found.

There was a river off to our right. I told Kaden since the trails we had been following were near the river we should move closer to it. I doubt he heard me over the rain, but followed me anyway. We reached the place where when we first left that morning was still a shallow creek bed, was now a river, at bare minimum 30 feet wide, at least 3-4 feet deep, and moving very fast. We followed it further until I smelt something. Through the pouring rain and wind it's nearly impossible to perceive anything from any sense, but to this day I have never smelt anything worse. I'm sure Kaden would verify as he immediately threw up. I imagine that's what a dead body would smell like, but a dead body that was in a hot, humid room for weeks. That was followed by the sound of a creaking. It grew louder until there was a thud and a tree fell a few feet beside us. The only issue was there was no lighting or anything to take down the tree. The wind was strong, yes, but not tree falling strong. It was more the rain which made the storm so overwhelming. I didn't stop for a second however. I was focused and nothing could take me from my path, until something did.

It was faint, nearly unhearable, until it wasn't. In front of us there was a scream, or a screech, I don't know which is more accurate. It sounded like the pain of death, the anger of ten men, and a need for blood. If I had eaten that morning I'll tell you, it would have come right out. Kaden’s came out the other end mine would have, vomiting again. I turned towards the right and ran for about 2 seconds before I remembered we were next to a river that could drown Michael Phelps. The worst part of this was I couldn't hear footsteps. I would have no clue how near it was or was getting. For that matter I had no idea how close the scream was, my sound perception was totally off. I stared for maybe 3 seconds before saying screw it and taking a foot step into the river. I felt my leg bet pulled to the side before it landed, hitting a few feet off the mark and almost taking me under. Accounting for this I took another step, and another, and another until I was in the river. Kaden hesitantly followed me and slowly I took no more than two more steps before I heard an incredibly faint crashing through trees. I could only think "hell no" at that moment and ran through the chest high water as quickly as I could. Kaden followed suit. I figured if I stayed whatever that was had made its mind up about killing me, the river was still deciding, so I took my chance. I made it to the other side in what felt like hours but must have been seconds. I looked back and saw Kaden almost across, took a bum step, and dunked under the water for only a second before miraculously coming back up. He's a better man than me, if I went under for an instant I'd have been dragged away. I'm sure he saw the lights of heaven and fires of hell for that moment.

We made it across and booked it forward until after less than a minute we refound the trail. Later I looked back at the map when I was home and saw the trail crossed the river, since it was so flooded we must have just missed it. I figured if they crossed without us they'd probably hunkered down to wait for us. We ran back the direction we had been coming, but parallel to the shore we were on and sure enough we found them, under a tarp one of them brought. We joined and after probably about 30 minutes to an hour the rain began to subside. A few miles ahead there was a bail out point where you could reach a road where hopefully the beeper teh guide brought could pick up a car to get us out. It was that or go back across the river to retrace our steps to where we entered. I can not emphasis how much Kaden and I were not under any conditions going to the other side of the river where that thing was, so we went to the bail out point and made it back to civilization, but you know it's the funniest thing, when the adrenaline wore off I realized I was bleeding. There was a chunk missing from my arm that I had no clue was missing. After a few seconds I felt it and wished I could go back to not noticing. I got patched up later at a hospital but could have swore it almost looked like a bite.
