Where to begin?



Well, as someone suggested in the comments, I asked my building manager about the previous tenants. At first, he was hesitant and shady. I pressed him and didn’t let up until he told me what he was hiding. I guess he saw my desperation, because he told me everything and then begged me not to tell any of the other tenants. Jesus…it turns out there have been three deaths of previous tenants specifically who lived in my apartment. My property manager got hired about two years ago and apparently the last manager up and quit with no reason and zero notice. 



The first death the tenant fell from the fire escape while they were yelling at someone on the sidewalk below. The second death, the tenant tripped on the sidewalk and into oncoming traffic. The third death, the tenant that passed before I moved in, happened when the HVAC on the roof malfunctioned and poured bad air into only their apartment. They died in their sleep. I’m almost certain those are not the only deaths that occurred in my apartment. Those are just the ones that the current manager dealt with. He wasn’t able to find any record of older deaths than that. So, there’s no way of knowing how far back this thing goes and when the game show started to appear.



It doesn’t matter. All that mattered was getting Ethan back and in order to do that I needed to be prepared. I started by searching up the host’s name. “Lugh.” I said out loud as I typed it into the search bar. This is the description I received: “Lugh (also known as Lug, or Luga) is a prominent figure in Irish mythology, a multifaceted god associated with the sun, light, and harvest. He is a member of the[ Tuatha Dé Danann](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=b16723199f5965cc&sxsrf=AE3TifN34IYZJPVm5wo2JKtqvT6wJgbdJw%3A1752185242905&q=Tuatha+D%C3%A9+Danann&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwibtO_XprOOAxXTr-4BHVuzBOMQxccNegQIPBAB&mstk=AUtExfBO4SjlAh6s9VmjuwFBXjBK6OdaX9BDUJnjvuTa-fgZctKhsaqiGkkziNej1oSUaPOijPtxYkHD2whjLzgkOnk2bPIr7QNwTvrV-EcVRKKdONtZDgWYGndpKstme-6zg6fRw3b8l6LGz1QNU25t8gPkBwfXgjXN92QJxkCjiRWK6FX94Mwb3H-kQzLWIE819I8h474KKdF9xA14Easp3DBiKfU-iCE_aEBqf6Uay5WO48Z6TOh589lCwPvx-2J3Xb6_YDIQakt67M_ERRHBwMm4&csui=3), depicted as a warrior, king, and master craftsman. Lugh is also linked to skill, mastery in various arts, oaths, truth, and rightful kingship.”



I mulled this information over while I patched myself up as best I could and drove over to Ethan’s house. I unlocked the front door with his spare key I found underneath a small Celtic Cross statue in the planter. Gatsby greeted me, cheerfully bounding between my feet and rubbing his body on my legs, as I entered. “Hey there B. Are you ready for another closet journey?” I knelt down and pet him as he purred, meeting my gaze. Last time I took Gatsby with me he wasn’t much help, but maybe he could help me find Ethan or to snap him out of whatever trance the Host has him in. 



I looked around Ethan’s place. It still smelled like him. That same, expensive cologne he always wore permeated the walls of the bathroom as I passed by. The kitchen sink still had dishes in it from his dinner the night before. I still felt his presence here, but what would I do if…? No. I couldn’t think that way. I smacked my head and retreated from that thought. I set my sights on the garage and found the exact ingredient that would give my mission its edge. A gallon can of gasoline sat on a shelf among crates of tools and auto parts. I recalled where Ethan kept his matches and checked those off my mental list too.



It was then that I remembered someone saying on my last post to try and call Ethan. I pressed his name in my phone and waited for it to connect. It started to ring, but it sounded garbled. There was a click followed by silence. “Hello…?” I said. There was a shallow gasp as if someone had been holding their breath. “Ethan? Is that you?”



“Aaron. Where am I? Please…help me.” Ethan whispered as his voice was filled with increasing static.



“Ethan! Are you okay? I'm coming! Hold on!” I called out.



“Aa…on…I’m…ding…plea…e’s come…” Ethan’s voice was choked by the blaring static.



My phone released a shrill shriek. I dropped it to cover my ears, sending it careening across the tiled floor. Gatsby took off toward Ethan’s bedroom. The sound ceased and I picked up my phone. It was dead. It wouldn’t even turn on. Great. Not only was this asshole host costing me a medical bill, but now I have to get a new phone too, I thought. A trivial mindset to have at the time, I know, but it helped keep me sane. 



I only had a few hours to prepare so I made sure to gather everything in Ethan’s room beforehand. Last time, the Host used my knife against me so this time I would only bring things that were useless to him or, in the case of the gas, would hurt him too. Either way, there wasn’t going to be a version of this where I didn’t burn his shit to the ground. I would get my brother back or I would die trying.



I found a heavy duty, metal flashlight with extra batteries in the kitchen, matches, and a pair of sun glasses. I set everything at the foot of Ethan’s bed when I noticed Gatsby scratching at the closet door. What was stranger was there were no lights or music emitting from the closet. “What’s in their B? Is that where your litter box is or something?” I turned the knob and swung the door open. We were met with the sides of the walk-in-closet morphing into a dark hallway. The light from the bedroom only reached so far until it was snuffed out by a thick wall of darkness. The black mass wiggled and moved in such a way that made me think it was alive. The sight of it made my stomach turn.



“What? How?” I paused and glanced down at Gatsby. He looked up at me, meowed, then stared back at the black wall. “Alright, I guess this is it. Let’s go get Ethan.” I said and turned to gather up my tools. I clicked the flashlight on. The beam hit the dark wall and was cut off. I approached it, poking it with the end of my flashlight. It wobbled and rippled from my touch. Gatsby wasted no time as he sniffed at the wall then walked right through. I gasped as his little body disappeared. If he could do it so easily, I guess I can too, I thought. I closed my eyes and stepped forward.



Instantly, my surroundings felt humid and the earthy scent from before was abundant. Sounds of crickets, cicadas and frogs filled the room. I opened my eyes and was rendered speechless. An exorbitant amount of candles lined the rest of the hall and the grand atrium where the game show stage used to be. What was once seating, was now grassy knolls, tree stumps, and massive mushrooms. An enormous, willow tree filled the left side of the room with its encroaching branches looming overhead. Loose moss and vines hung like curtains against the far wall. The podiums were gone and in the center was a large, circular stone fixture in the floor. Just through the branches peeked the moonlight pouring down from a burnt orange harvest moon. Something so natural that should’ve comforted me, instead sent chills crawling through my skin. I felt watched.



As I approached the center of the room it became apparent what the stone fixture was. It was an enormous hole in the ground with stone steps leading downward in a spiral. The outer stone bricks that formed the circle each had their own symbols on them. It took a few seconds for it to click in my brain, but I recognized them as celtic runes. As I stepped onto the bricks I felt a gentle, constant vibration coming from them. It was as if the stones themselves were humming. “You want to go first?” I asked Gatsby and he cocked his head, curiously at me. “Yeah, I thought not.” I sighed and started my descent.



The smell of moisture and the sound of running water made their way into my senses. Candles continued to line my path even down there. They flickered and licked at the air, desperate for fuel. The air down there felt thicker; heavier with each passive breath. As I moved the beam of my flashlight, a single hall with several ornate wooden doors stood tall and strong. They all bore different symbols just as the stones above did. Each of the doors was smeared with thick, reddish black muck that looked like it had been there for a while. Gatsby and I stayed silent as we gently stepped down the stone path.



We passed the first set of doors and I could hear gears turning. As I listened closely I could make out crunching and dripping reverberating from the other side. What the fuck was this place? I thought. My heart skipped a beat as I thought about Ethan. I hoped with every fiber of my being that he was okay. I swallowed hard and took a few deep breaths as I made another heavy step onward. The next set of doors carried the scent of sugar and fermentation. The sound of whirring machines and humming fans followed me down the hall. The third set of doors smelled acrid and foul. An invisible metallic ammonia cloud wafted into my lungs and I held back a cough, making me tear up. I spent less time in between those doors, but as I left their presence I thought I could hear sobbing coming from the right room. That could be Ethan! My mind screamed. As horrible as the stench was, I needed to be certain it wasn’t him.



I glanced down at the final door at the end of the hall and back at the door in front of me. I covered my nose with my arm and slowly lifted my left foot to push the handle down. The door swung open with a long, tired moan. I shined the flashlight in and I gasped, sucking in the acidic, tainted air. I couldn’t hold back any longer and coughed, nearly gagging at the sight of what was in the room. Rusted, bloody cages lined the room and hung from the ceiling. Decomposing, half dismembered corpses filled a few of the cages, while others sat empty. No one alive occupied the hellish prison and none of the bodies remotely looked like Ethan. For good measure, I checked the other room. I really wish I hadn’t.



Somehow, the room on the left was worse. Several, headless corpses hung upside down as they dripped blood into a stone basin that flowed to one of the other rooms. I held back another gag. That’s when I heard Ethan scream my name.



“Aarooooooon!!!!” Ethan called out from the door at the end of the hall. He sounded in pain and it made my muscles freeze in place. The only thing that got me moving again into a full on sprint, was Gatsby taking off toward Ethan’s voice. Adrenaline surged through me and the gas tank felt lighter in my hand. As we reached the final door, I could see the same familiar multicolored lights and hear the fanfare music. Only this time, it sounded slow. It sounded wrong. Like an old CD player attempting to read a disc that’s heavily scratched.



I shoved the door open with my shoulder and instinctively flipped the sun glasses from my head, over my eyes. “Okay, mother fucker! Give me back my brother!” I said with as much aggression as I could muster. Whether or not I came off as intimidating is up for debate.



“Aaron! Welcome back to RISK! OR! REWAAaaaaaarrrrrd…” The host started to speak enthusiastically as their voice shifted unnaturally from feminine to masculine tones. They stood an unnerving eight feet tall. They looked as though they had been stretched out to their limit. Their sharp toothy smile reached from ear to ear and their eyes were black around the edges with glowing, gold pupils boring into me. Their two outfits were messily stitched together on their gangily, leathery body and their long fingers dripped with fresh, viscous crimson fluid. Atop their silver-haired head was a crown of thrones and rosebuds that leaked blood from their punctured scalp.



Gatsby hissed loudly which snapped me out of my shock. That’s when I spotted Aaron next to the Host, strapped to a set of three wooden beams in an X formation. He was facing away from me with several long slices into his back. I could hear him crying as his own bare back was drenched in sweat and blood. I stepped forward to help Ethan down, but the Host moved in front of me. They moved so quickly it was as if they floated across the floor. I crouched down to place the gas tank down and clicked off the flashlight, still clutching it in my hand. As I knelt down, Gastby jumped onto my right shoulder, still hissing at the Host.



“Not so fast, Aaron. You have to play the game again to get your reward. Or, you could always walk away and accept your risk…” They said, in that same unrecognizable tone as they gestured to my brother. It made me uneasy, but I stole my mind and focused my sights on Ethan. The Host would not muddy my mind this time.



“You like games? Fine. Let’s play a different game.” I declared.



“Hmmmm…” The host brought their thin, veiny hand to their pointed chin and licked one of their fingers. “It has been soooooooo long since anyone acknowledged me with a challenge. How exciting…What kind of game did you have in mind, child?”



“Easy. A quiz show. Ask me three questions and if I get them all correct then I can leave with my brother and you leave us alone…forever.”



“And if you get even a single question wrong you AND your brother become my new audience members…forever.” The host mimicked my voice with that last word and my nerves shook. I tightened my grip around the flashlight, looked down, and stamped my feet. 



“Deal.” I said, through gritted teeth.



The host snapped their fingers that let out a roll of thunder throughout the room. Darkness covered everything save for the candles that lined the subterranean studio. A single spotlight shined down over two glass podiums. The host stepped out from the shadows, completely renewed into their pristine, masculine form. A gold crown now adorned their head along with a fresh, dark green suit. Applause from an unseen audience filled the room as another spotlight shined at a set of bleachers where Ethan sat. He clapped and smiled, tears streaming down his reddened face. I stepped up to my podium and waited for the final game to begin.



“Welcome Aaron, to the final round of RISK! OR! REWARD! Now, per your suggestion, this final round is special as it’s a quiz! You get three questions, three answers! Answer them all right and you get our GRAAAAND PRIZE! But miss just one and it’s curtains for you, my friend!” The host announced theatrically and with more flourish than I’d seen him muster before. This was it. This was my distraction. One way or another, Ethan and I were getting out of here. I would just have to play along for a moment longer. “Now! Your first question, are you ready, Aaron?” 



“Yes.”



“Excellent! Question one: What was the name of the wine you won in round two?” His golden eyes and handsome face seared into me, but I felt my sunglasses holding back some of the intensity. This allowed me a second more to shift my gaze away from him. What the hell was the name of that wine again? It almost killed me. That much I did remember. Fuck…we’re screwed, I thought. I knew it had a praying mantis on the label. “What’s the matter, Aaron? Not stumped already are we?” Lugh mocked and Ethan laughed uncontrollably. That’s it.



“Laughing Mantis. Final answer.” I proclaimed and noticed Gatsby pounce off my shoulder, behind me.



“That is…CORRECT!” Cheers filled the studio and Ethan clapped, but I could see him in my periphery. He fought against whatever spell Lugh had him under. “Question two: What started the fire in the forest when you were a child?”



“I did.” I sighed. “With a lit cigarette. Nice try, Lugh.” I mocked back. I knew it was a trick question. He wasn’t going to play fair and I wasn’t going to fall for his traps.



“Very good.” He said, as his left eye twitched, his body slowly stretched, and his tux began to tear. “Final question.” Their voice dipped back into that unnerving, guttural droning from before. “How many players have been on my game show?” Lugh’s smile nearly split his face as it spread wider and wider.



He believes he’s won, I thought. He asked me an impossible question, because there was no way I could answer that accurately. I still had no clue what Lugh even was let alone how many millennia he’d been doing this. There was no point in guessing. That much became clear as I heard the gas can tip over behind me and Gastby’s meow. I could see Ethan just on the edge of my vision slowly creeping through the bleachers in the shadows. I needed another distraction, but I was all out of time.



“Well? We’re waiting!” Lugh roared with manic glee.



“Unknown.”



“What?” Lugh’s smile twisted into confusion.



“The amount of players is unknowable, because you yourself don’t even know.” I attempted to call his bluff.



“Oh…” He chuckled. “I know. The question is, do yoooooou?” 



“Are you sure? Because I think you’re lying. I think you really can’t bear to lose. So, you asked me a question that doesn’t have an answer, but I know something you don’t.” I said, switching the metal flashlight into my right hand and feeling its weight. With my left hand, I slid the box of matches out of my pocket.



“Please. Enlighten me.” Lugh grinned, his large mouth salivating.



“Gladly.” With all my might, I tossed my flashlight at Lugh’s head. It smashed him dead center in his face and he let out a horrible, ground shaking scream; one filled with eons of rage. The tremors made me drop the matches on the ground, spilling them everywhere. 



“Aaron! No time! RUN!” Ethan stood near the doorway, holding Gatsby in one arm and a lit candle in his other hand. Without a second thought, I sprinted toward Ethan. Just as I reached him he lobbed the candle into the large pool of gasoline. Lugh’s face morphed from rage to shock as we threw ourselves into the hallway and slammed the door shut behind us. There were metal bolts on the top and bottom of the door frame that I shoved locked, pausing to look at Ethan’s face afterward.



“Let’s fucking leave.” I said and Ethan nodded, eyes wide.



As we reached the stone stairs, shrieking pierced through the hollow, cold hall. Flames licked from underneath the door frame and banging shook the red hot bolts. Ethan led the way and I followed him back up to the surface. We spotted the black veil and made a beeline straight for it. As soon as we crossed back into Ethan’s closet, we slammed the door shut and immediately left the house in my car. We drove with Gatsby to the middle of nowhere and laid on top of my car looking at the stars until the sun came up. We didn’t say a word to each other until then.



I’m writing this from a cafe. It’s been a few days. Ethan and I haven’t slept in separate rooms since that night, but I think we’re safe now. I have no way of knowing if it’ll last or if something terrible will take us later on, but we can’t live the rest of our lives in fear. I want to believe Lugh or whatever that thing was, is dead. I got my brother back and that’s all that matters. We have each other and I don’t intend to let anyone or anything threaten our lives again. One more thing I can’t seem to shake though. I went back to my apartment last night to grab a few things and everything was fine, but when I was leaving I could have sworn I heard game show music coming from my neighbors place. Maybe they just had their T.V. too loud.
