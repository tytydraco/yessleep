I had much trouble sleeping that night. If I as much as started to drift off, intense nightmares would set in and wake me up, drenched in sweat and with heavy breathing I still saw and felt the dreams. They were weird dreams, like nothing I had ever had before, dreams of being in an unfamiliar place, with a feeling of dread and utter helplessness waying down on me, a feeling of not being seen or noticed by people around me, only – there were no other people there, I was alone. I did however finally doze off, probably due to pure exhaustion. I woke up to a massive crash outside my window and ran up to see what was happening. A huge branch of the old oak just outside my room had broken off and crashed down in our backyard. This weather was out of this world. Never before had I seen a storm last this long, and only intensify as I went on. I stood there in the window, looking at the scenes playing out in front of me. Grey, almost black clouds passing by and the rain coming down so hard it almost looked like a snowstorm. The wind causing havoc everywhere you looked. I was so mesmerized by natures show that I almost didn’t hear my phone ring. Finally, I snapped out of my trans like state and realized it was ringing and buzzing beside me on the table.


-	“Hello?”, I answered.
-	“Jake?”, I heard my father say through static and wind blowing straight into the microphone.
-	“Dad?”, I said, “What’s up, when are you guys going to be home?” I asked.
-	“Hi Jake. Yeah, that’s why I’m calling”, he continued. “This storm is only getting stronger as you probably noticed. We won’t be able to get home today as planned, I’m afraid. They’ve closed the highway, too risky with so many trees coming down. Hopefully things will be better tomorrow, but I’m afraid you’re going to have to manage one more day by yourself”.
Normally this would be like winning the lottery for me, but at this moment, I really didn’t feel like being alone and had actually been looking forward to my parents getting back, hell, I even wanted Helen to be home.
-	“Oh, ok, I see…”, I responded, clearly not sounding OK about this.
-	“You’ll be fine”, dad continued. “There’s some extra money in my drawer for food, if they even deliver in this weather, otherwise you’re going to have to do with what’s in the fridge. I’m sure you’ll manage. And as soon as they’ve cleared and opened the roads again, we’ll be back, alright son?”.
-	“Yeah, alright dad”, I tried sounding calm and collected but even I could hear the hesitation in my voice. 
We ended the phone call after he reminded me to stay inside and away from the windows in case something blew in with the wind. I assured him I wouldn’t go anywhere and hung up the phone.


I couldn’t let go of the horrifying experience with my screen the night before, to the point where I was almost too afraid to turn my computer back on. But I needed to tell the rest of the group what had happened, so I took a deep breath and pressed the power button on my computer and once again, like so many times before, sat down and listened to the sound of the fans starting up and discs starting to spin inside my neon-lit chassi that doubled as a foot stool under my desk. One by one my screens came back to life, except the screen that had had the message on it the night before. It didn’t respond. The light behind the button was glowing green as usual, but the monitor remained black. It took a good five minutes before it slowly started to fade from black into its normal settings, but when it did, I saw that the lines with the message were gone. The screen was once again back to normal, not a trace that anything had been wrong with it the night before.  I immediately started to question my own experience. Had I dreamt it? Could that be possible? I did have nightmares through out the night, was that just another one of them? Just more realistic than the others? That did seem to make the most sense, I convinced myself. What else could it be?


I was back in the chat, and it seemed, to my surprise, that all the others were online as well already. It wasn’t even one o clock in the afternoon, usually no one would be here for another five or six hours. 
-	“Hey guys”, I said in a weak voice, still affected by the night and my thoughts. “What are you all doing here so early?”
-	“Man, you should see the storm were having”, Jen said. “It’s insane! There’s not much else to do than hang out here”, she said.
-	“Same here”, Ali responded. “Wind’s acting all kinds of crazy over here”,
-	“Yeah… Warren said”, We’re also experiencing hard rain and winds over here… that’s so weird.”
-	“They’ve even closed the bridges and tunnels to Manhattan over here”, Henry added.
I too proceeded to tell them about the storm raging outside my creaking house. 
-	“I’ve never heard of this before”, Warren said. “Such extreme weather in so many different parts of the country, that’s actually weird, like Weird-weird..”.
We all agreed and sat in silence for a few minutes. 
-	“Well,” Jen exclaimed, “that just leaves more time to hang out, so I guess that’s the upside, right!”
-	“Absolutely!”, Henry answered.
I once again decided not to go into what I had experienced, or dreamt, the night before. I didn’t want to sound like this thing was getting to me and making me see things that weren’t there.


-	“Hey guys!” Warren suddenly said in an exited voice. “Check out the stream, she’s added another camera!”
Everyone opened the stream again, but I let the cursor hover over the link for a while. I hesitated. “Maybe all the things that was happening wasn’t dreams and mind tricks, maybe it did in fact have something to do with this damn stream “, I thought. I took a deep breath, exhaled, and went along with the others and clicked the link. The site started to load, and just like Warren had so excitingly proclaimed, there was another camera added to the stream. This one was of the exterior of the house, pointed in an angle towards the front door down on the left side and the front yard for the larger part of the shot, revealing some of the area surrounding the house. It looked like a normal suburb, houses of different sizes with fences & bushes separating the front yards. Nothing out of the ordinary. In the distance you could see a church tower that looked like it had been damaged. It seemed it was missing the silver painted roof panels on one side of the top of the tower. Based on the heavy rain coming down in front of the camera, and the trees trying to withstand the hard winds in the background, it seemed that wherever this stream was broadcast from, they too were hit by a storm like the one we all were experiencing. 


-	“Oh shit…”, Warren said softly.
-	“What?” I asked, almost not wanting to know the answer.
-	“I know where this is…” Warren said, again almost in a whisper.
-	“What do you mean?” Jen asked.
-	“This is here, in my town!” He responded with more power in his voice. “That church in the background? With the missing panels? That’s my church!”
We all sat in disbelief and tried to think of something to say. What were the chances of this. This was beyond odd.
-	“Here, let me show you”, Warren continued while we could hear his fingers hard at work hammering away in his keyboard. “Check this out”, a blue link to a google maps-page popped up in the main chat. “That’s the church!” Warren said.
-	“Are you sure?” Ali said with a noticeable freaked out voice. “I Mean, church towers kind of look alike, right?”
-	“A hundred percent”, Warren answered, once again almost whispering.
-	“Hey…” Henry said almost like to himself. “Maybe we can use google maps to pinpoint which house the stream is coming from! We know where the church is, and we know the angle we see it from in the stream, it shouldn’t be to hard to at least find the right neighbourhood, and from there go to Streetview and see if we can find the right address, right?”


Even though we all felt a bit sketchy about looking into this even further and feeling almost stalkish about looking up someone’s house like this, we couldn’t help ourselves from feeling a little excited about it. And hey, it gave us something to do for a while, so we started to investigate and check angles, try to determine distances, and look for more things to use as checkpoints to determine the correct street. We looked at the houses across the street if there was anything standing out. There was one house for instance, built in a Victorian style that had a small tower on one of the corners that no other house seemed to have. Another one had a small fountain in their front yard. Small details like that could help us pinpoint the exact street. After splitting up and taking parts of the map between us, it really didn’t take long before Ali with an exited “Got it!” had found the house with the tower. She sent over the link with the address to us, and we all went over to check it out. In street view, all we had to do was turn the camera 180 degrees and there in front of us was the house that must be the source of the stream.


-	“That’s it, that’s the house” – Warren said.
-	“This feels weird”, I added. “I mean, even if this person willingly broadcasts the inside of their home 24/7 this feels a bit invasive, don’t you think?”
-	“I mean yeah,” Jen said”, but this is like an old picture, it’s just google maps, we’re not hurting anyone.”
-	“Still though” I said silently while looking at the house. 
An ominous feeling came over me as I conveyed the home in front of me. At first glance it looked like any other house. But I couldn’t help to feel like I knew it from somewhere. Like I had been there before.
-	“What the hell!” Ali said suddenly. “What’s going on inside the house, look at the kitchen-cam, you can see a bit of the hallway there. It looks like the woman is just laying on the floor, like, lifeless!”
We all looked, and it indeed seemed like she was just lying there, completely still. We could see part of her torso and her legs stretching out into the kitchen.
-	“How long has she been lying like that?!”, Henry asked out in to the open.
-	“I don’t know”, Jen said. “I haven’t been checking the stream since we started with the maps and stuff.
-	“Yeah, me neither”, Warren said.
-	“We need to do something, Ali responded with a tremor on her voice.
-	“Like what?” I said.
-	“We need to like, call an ambulance or the police or something”, Ali responded. “We know the address, right?”
-	“It’s true,” Warren said. “We can’t just ignore this! I can make the call.”


We all listened as we heard Warren talk to the local cops, explaining the whole thing, that we were watching this house live on a stream, and that it seemed like something had happened to the owner. The cops had at first been somewhat reluctant to buy the story, but finally agreed to send a squad car to check it out. We sat fully ingulfed in the stream, trying to see if we could spot any movement at all from the woman, while eagerly awaiting the cops on the external camera. After what seemed like forever, a cop car finally pulled up on the street in front of the house. Two officers exited the vehicle and holding on to their hats, less they would take of in the harsh winds, and trying to shield themselves from the whipping rain coming from what looked to be every direction, they made their way up to the front door and knocked hard a couple of times. The angle of the camera didn’t reveal who opened the door, but we could clearly see the cops communicating with someone, gesturing, and nodding as if listening to someone. They were let in the house, and we continued to monitor their way from the interior cameras. We saw the reflection of someone leading them inside in the mirror in the living room, and we saw them walk right past the woman laying on the hallway floor into the kitchen, like they didn’t even notice her. There was no one else but the two officers, but we could still clearly see them talking to what seemed to be a third party. 


“Shit, I need to record this”, I thought while quickly connecting my external drive and hit record on the screen capture software.


The officers where then, seemingly, led into the living room where they stood and looked around for a bit before once again moving towards the front door. Tipping their hats to whoever was there with them and exiting the house.
We all sat with our moths wide open, not believing what we were witnessing.
-	“What the hell are they doing?!”, Warren said with ragged breathing. “They can’t leave! She´s still lying right there! And who the hell were they talking to?!”
We had no answers, all still sitting in disbelief staring at our screens.
-	“I’m going to call them again”, Warren said firmly.


Once again, we heard him talk to the cops, but this time it seemed he was doing more of the listening than explaining.


-	“I’m back”, he said after a while. 
-	What did they say?!” Ali asked.
-	“They warned me from calling in any more prank calls”, he continued with a resigned tone. “Especially in conditions like this where police could be urgently needed elsewhere because of the storm” he said slowly. 
-	What the hell do they mean by “prank call”, Jen said. “We can see the woman lying right there, she still hasn’t moved an inch, and they walked right past her!”
-	“I don’t know”, Warren said solemnly, “that’s what they said. They said that the two cops had spoken to the woman who lived there, and had asked to be let in to check the premises but that they had found nothing out of the ordinary, everything seemed fine”
-	“I don’t understand” Ali said, with a clearly frightened voice. “I don’t get any of this”
We all agreed and continued to look at the three cameras, still showing the same images we’d seen for a good hour now.


-	“I’m going.”, Warren said silently.
-	“you’re what?” I asked with a clear emphasis on the “what”.
-	“I’m going over there”, he said again. “It’s not far from here, and that woman clearly needs help, if the police’s not going to do anything about it then we’ll have to! And since it’s right here, I have to go, I have to! I can’t just watch her lay there!”
-	“You’re crazy!”, Henry added. Firstly, because all hell is braking loose out there with that storm, and secondly because we know nothing of the woman who lives there! You saw the stream yourself! The cops walk right past her! There’s something weird going on in that house man, don’t go over there by yourself!”
-	“I agree!”, I added. “This is not a good idea Warren, even if your heart is in the right place, there is something very fucking off about that place!”
-	“I’m actually scared right now”, Ali said. “I don’t like this at all”
-	“I have to agree with the others,” Jen said, also with fear in her voice. “You shouldn’t do this Warren, it’s a really bad idea.
-	“Look”, Warren said with determination in his voice, “I’m going, Ok? This Is how I was raised. If someone needs help, you help them, God damnit. Besides, you can all check on me through the stream when I get there. And I can start the video chat when I’m there, so you can see through my phone as well right here in the chat, OK?”


We obviously couldn’t talk him out of it, and silently all agreed to follow his moves closely. It would take him about fifteen to twenty minutes to get there, and we all sat in silence the entire time waiting for him to show up on the external camera of the stream. After a while, we saw him standing there on the street, looking at the house, then straight into the camera, giving a small wave of his hand in our direction. We could see him reach for his phone, and a couple of seconds later he popped up in the chat. 
-	“I’m here!”, he screamed as the wind blew hard in the phone, he was soaking wet from the rain and looked like he really had to struggle to talk over the brutal gusts doing their best to push him around.
-	“Alright man, BE CAREFULL!”, I screamed into my mic.
A thumbs up showed up on the chat, as well as the exterior camera, before we saw him slowly walk up to the front door and knock hard three times.


The door opened.
