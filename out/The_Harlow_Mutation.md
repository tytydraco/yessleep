Hello guys! Halloween is approaching and I thought perhaps making creepypasta would be something fun to do. I've also started a YouTube channel recently so if you like the story and the video, I'd appreciate if you drop a like and subscribe if you feel extra generous. \^\_\^

I will try to post regularly here and on my YouTube Channel.

[The Harlow Mutation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paazMSj4QvU)

**Day 1: May 3rd**

They brought the first patient in from rural Arkansas.  
Middle-aged farmer, forty-six, bitten by what he called a “stray coyote.” No one thought much of it. Rabies cases are rare, but not unheard of.

He was agitated, hallucinating, and foaming at the mouth. Standard rabies presentation. We started the Milwaukee protocol.

*My name is Dr. Evan Rourke, and I*’m a virologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stationed in the Southeastern Division of Emerging Pathogens. My work is focused on zoonotic transmission, how viruses leap from animals to humans.

Anyways, what makes this case strange is how fast it progressed… full-blown neurological collapse in less than eight hours. Rabies doesn’t do anything like that

When we tried to draw blood, the patient bit through his IV line and *spat* the fluid at one of the nurses. The blood was black.

 

**Day 2: May 4th**

The nurse, Shaw, is showing symptoms already eighteen hours post-exposure.

 She’s developed hydrophobia, hypersalivation, and something else… aggression.

She doesn’t scream or thrash. She watches. Like she’s waiting for something.

When we took her blood sample to view under microscopy, her blood cells show signs of necrosis around the nucleus, but her white cell count is rising, not falling. The virus isn’t killing the cells. It’s changing them.

We sequenced the genome. Rabies RNA with an extra segment, looks like a *recombinant insertion*. Something… unnatural.

 

**Day 3: May 5th**

Shaw bit one of the orderlies before we could restrain her. We locked her in containment. She doesn’t seem afraid.

She hums and odd tune... all night. One low, droning note that vibrates through the walls.

We tested her saliva. Viral titers were off the charts, ten times normal rabies loads. The virus has a second phase, a latency cycle, like herpes or HIV. Except this one reactivates immediately upon the host’s death.

We injected a sedated rat with the infected serum.  
It died in under three minutes.

But then… it stood up again.

 

**Day 4: May 6th**

They’re calling it Lyssa Variant H, for “Harlow,” the town where it started.

But this isn’t rabies anymore. It’s something far worse.

The reanimated rat attacked the others, spreading infection by saliva and aerosol. Within thirty minutes, the entire cage was a pile of convulsing bodies.

And every one of them were reborn unnaturally

We froze the samples and requested BSL-4 transport. Washington denied it. “Contain locally.”

We are not equipped for this.

 

**Day 5: May 7th**

Harlow’s gone dark.

They said the local hospital burned down after “civil unrest.” But our data link still shows thermal signatures. Human movement… hundreds of them, wandering through the streets in erratic patterns.

We intercepted radio chatter from the sheriff’s department. Their last message:

“They don’t die when you shoot them. Burn them. Burning them is the only way to stop them.”

We’re surrounded by farmland, forests, livestock… hundreds of potential carriers.

I can’t sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I hear Shaw humming through the vents. Her tune reminding me of her eerie presence

 

**Day 6:  May 8th**

She broke out.

We don’t know how.

The containment lock didn’t show any damage. They were opened from the inside.

Two of my colleagues are missing. The others barricaded themselves in the lab with me.

Oh god…

 We can hear them out there. Not just Shaw, but the others she infected. Their footsteps drag, but they move with purpose.

One of them whispered my name through the door.  
But it wasn’t just *her* voice anymore.

It was… layered. Like there were dozens of throats speaking from her mouth at once.

 

**Day 8: May 10th**

The CDC declared emergency quarantine for five counties. The military setting up perimeters, but it’s too late.

Lyssa H spreads by bite, contact, and airborne droplets within enclosed spaces.

It works by rewriting the limbic system, suppressing pain, amplifying aggression, and somehow keeping the host ambulatory after death.

Not undead. Not “zombies.”  
Neurological puppets**.** The virus hijacks electrical signals like a second brain.

I caught one of the infected under infrared. Their neural activity glows brighter than a normal human’s. It’s like the virus is burning them alive from the inside and *making them enjoy it.*

 

**Day 9: May 11th**

We lost containment.

It started with one scream down the hall, then another, then nothing.

I’m writing from the isolation cell now. The door is made of steel. I have a generator and a recorder. I don’t know how long I will last, but I’ll document as long as I can.

I can still hear them in the facility. They don’t moan or shriek—they breathe together, in sync, like a single organism.

Sometimes I hear the hum again. It vibrates in my teeth.

I think they’re using echolocation.  
Or maybe they’re listening for me**.**

 

**Day 10: May 12th**

The air outside smells like copper and rot. Through the security window, I can see the fields glowing with fire. The military tried napalm, but it doesn’t seem to be working.

The infected walked right through it, still burning, still moving. The virus doesn’t die… it just goes dormant until the flames die out.

There’s a pattern to their movement now. They gather in circles, heads tilted back, mouths open like they’re tasting the air.

When I played back the audio of their humming, the spectrogram showed words, embedded frequencies that spelled:

“**JOIN US**.”

This isn’t infection. This is an assimilation**.**

 

**Day 11: May 13th**

I’ve been exposed.

Small nick on my forearm from a shattered vial. The skin burned like acid.

I’m recording this before I lose control. I’ve been documenting the mutation phases in real time. My temperature is up. My pupils are dilated.

I feel… good. Too good. The fear is slipping away. The hunger’s gone. My thoughts are… clear.

The virus isn’t killing me… it’s optimizing me.

I can hear the others outside the cell. Their humming isn’t noise. It’s communication. It’s a network.

They’re calling me to sync.

 

**Day 12:  May 14th**

I understand now.

The human brain resists unity. We cling to separation, to noise, to individuality. The virus fixes all that. This isn’t a disease… It’s a cure… A cure to war, famine, and suffering.

Shaw isn’t dead. No…. None of them are. They’ve simply evolved.

The hum isn’t random—it’s the pulse of one consciousness distributed across millions of hosts.

When I press my hand to the glass, the humming stops. They’re listening. They want me to open the door.

I think….  I will...
