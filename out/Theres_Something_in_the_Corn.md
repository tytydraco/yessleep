That’s the cliche isn’t it? The classic, midwest horror trope of murderers, monsters and any other sort of unspeakable evil lurking in the swaying stalks of corn. Unfortunately, when you’ve lived there your entire life the allure of that kind of horror is much less effective. The only things rustling around in the corn are hungry raccoons and—

That’s what I always believed anyway. I was always the practical one in the family–’a good head on my shoulders’, as my grandpa would say–and I prided myself in not being easily swept up in fantasies and conspiracy thories like my mom was, and my grandma…and my Aunt Carol, and every other female member of our family. Madness always comes for the women, according to Grandpa, and I was determined not to end up that way. There’s always a logical explanation. That’s what I believe–well, *believed*. 

Honestly, I debated for a long time whether or not I would revisit these memories at all, let alone write them down and post them somewhere for thousands, maybe millions, of strangers to see. Just another tin-foil-hat looney jumping at shadows and reading between lines that haven’t even been written. But I’ve been looking at the different posts on this site for a couple days now. This is where people go when they’ve seen things–things that can’t be explained, or the explanation goes against what we as a society have deemed ‘acceptable’. 

I’ve seen things; and I’m ready to talk about them.

It started when my husband  Eliott and I found ourselves moving back to my family’s farm to take care of our dad after he had a stroke that left him unable to take care of himself for a few months. Mom had been shipped away to a mental hospital two years ago–the alien conspiracy theories finally cracked her–so Dad was all by himself on fifty acres of land out in the middle of good, old-fashioned, midwest nowhere. 

Now, I call this a farm, but if you're picturing giant, industrial-sized barns full of cows, and massive, shiny equipment caring for endless fields of crops and hayfields…stop it. Ninety percent of the land was woods with just enough land carved out for a two-storey farm house, a tiny barn for a handful of chickens, a couple goats, and an ancient sway-backed horse, and the cornfield that took up more land than the house and barn put together. Corn was the only thing he sold from that farm–deer bait for hunters–and when Mom was still around they would turn the field into a maze for the neighborhood kids. 

At first everything went pretty smoothly. I had a job that let me work remotely and Eliott found part-time work at the local bookstore. Dad was recovering nicely and I had just gotten two pink lines on my pregnancy test after a year of trying.

I was sitting on the front porch, feeling a little sick and a little giddy, trying to think of the best way to tell Eliott, I didn’t notice how late it had gotten. Night falls fast and hard in the country, a short twilight is the only warning you get before you’re plunged into a darkness you can’t imagine if you haven’t experienced it. 

Nothing dramatic happened beforehand, the woods didn’t suddenly go quiet, I didn’t get an inexplicable chill down my spine. I just saw a little glint in between the stalks of corn as they swayed in the evening breeze. Small, low to the ground–a fox most likely–looking to snatch himself a chicken. A common occurrence in a place like that, so much so, that I barely registered it. 

What I *did* register, though, was the rustling in the corn to the left of the glinting eyes. Probably a deer, another common sight in the cornfield. 

I saw it a minute later, its tawny pelt lit up in the dim glow of the porch light, but something wasn’t right about the way it moved. It was hunkered low to the ground, limbs bunched up and creeping out in a way that deer limbs absolutely do not do. Picture a cat stalking a mouse and you’ll have a decent image of what this deer was doing. It’s silly and cartoonish to imagine, but it was eerie to see it happening in front of me. I didn’t move from my spot on the porch, transfixed by this weird deer creeping through the cornfield until it was out of the halo of the porch light and I couldn’t see it anymore.

I was about to get up to tell Eliott and Dad when I heard the scream. If anyone reading this hasn’t heard a fox scream before, the best way I can describe it is the scream of a dying woman. People have actually reported hearing a woman screaming in the woods when what they’re actually hearing is a fox. No matter how many times you hear it, it’s going to scare you, and this was no exception. The scream of an animal being tortured. 

*Blood. Agony. Tearing. Pulling. Devouring.*

I jumped to my feet then, and something in the cornfield rose with me, head peering above the stalks. Taller than any four-legged animal had a right to be. The deer. The glare of the porch light made it hard to make out, but I know what I saw. I saw its giant eyes, glowing orange in the light, looking right at me, and I knew that I had been *Seen*. Seen in the way that prey is Seen when a predator is hunting. Pinned in place like a moth on display. 

Something was hanging from its mouth. Torn and tattered, dripping thick black blood into the corn. 

I don’t remember screaming, but when Eliott burst out onto the porch asking what was wrong my throat was raw.

The deer was gone, and when I dragged Eliott out into the field to search the spot nothing was there. No blood on the ground, no orange tufts of fox fur, not even any hoofprints. 

“Are you sure you didn’t doze off on the porch and dream the whole thing?” Eliott suggested gently when I described everything over the dinner table. 

“I…” I wanted to say I was sure–that I knew what I saw–but was I? Did I? I had been tired this last month taking care of Dad. What was more likely: that I had seen a deer stalk and kill a fox, or that I had fallen asleep and had a nightmare? Plus, deer do eat meat sometimes. There’s videos everywhere of deer eating snakes or baby birds that they found on the ground. Maybe I was half-asleep and saw a sick deer eating something already dead?

“You sound like your mother,” Dad grouched from across the table. *That* stopped any protests that I might have had. The stroke might have stripped him of the use of one side of his body, but his mind was still completely intact, and that was ‘Dad speak’ for, ‘you sound crazy’. Just like your mother, and your grandmother, and your Aunt Carol, and every other woman on that side of the family.

*Madness always comes for the women.*

Eventually, I mumbled that I had probably fallen asleep and the atmosphere at the table brightened enough for the conversation to move onto lighter topics. For Dad, at least. I picked absently at my food while Eliott squeezed my hand under the table and kept shooting me worried looks. 


Two more months came and went without incident. I didn’t have any more dreams or nightmares about carnivorous deer stalking the corn. None that I remembered, anyway. Dad had improved enough that we could probably head back home next month. Get back to our own lives. Start planning for a baby, designing a nursery, and buying baby clothes and diapers.

Things were going well. Which, in my experience, usually means things are about to get bad again.

I was sitting on the porch again. It was October now, and the evening air was crisp and fresh. The cornstalks had turned dry and brown and rustled noisily in the breeze. 

By then I had almost forgotten about the weird deer in the corn. Just a weird dream borne of an overworked mind. But that didn't stop my heart from jumping into my throat when I spotted the tawny coat of another one in the greasy yellow halo of the porch light. 

A big doe, walking with calm purpose toward the cornfield, holding something securely in her mouth.

Something that dripped.

Then another one–a young stag with his first set of spike antlers–followed a few paces behind the doe. He held something in his mouth too. Something that twitched. One after another, a dozen or more deer marched solemnly into the dried stalks of corn, each carrying something dead–or almost dead–with them. 

I watched the whole procession from my spot on the porch; my mouth dry and my palms wet. I wasn't dreaming. I know with everything sound and sane in me that I was wide awake and stone cold sober. 

One last deer, a straggler, barely out of its fawn spots, hurried to catch up with the rest, struggling to hold up what it carried in its mouth.

Something squirming and writhing. Something that dripped black-red blood onto the ground. Something that cried with a voice all too human.

I stood up then. My legs carried me after the deer before my brain could catch up to what I was doing. The corn stalks slapped against my arms as I charged headlong into the field. I couldn't see the deer anymore, but I could hear the crying. Weak, shrill, and tearing at an instinct that had been growing in my body for the last two and a half months.

I barely managed to stop when the corn abruptly gave way to a clearing, perfectly round, the stalks stomped down by countless hooves for who knows how long. 

The deer were all assembled, standing silently inside the circle, their prey laying at their hooves like offerings to the beast that stood in the center.

I went to a museum once as a kid and saw the remains of a prehistoric deer–I can't remember what it's called–and I remember being amazed at how big it was. How strong its neck must be to hold up such massive antlers, each one longer than a man.

This was bigger. 

It was white. Taller than any moose or elk, neck as thick as a tree trunk. Golden antlers so tall and so wide they surrounded the moon that rose above its head, creating the illusion (I think) that it was wearing it. The only jewel worthy of such a mighty crown. Of such a mighty creature.

I watched as it surveyed the offerings set before it with frosty disinterest until it reached the baby–still wailing, still squirming around in its own blood on the hard, pointed floor of broken off cornstalks. 

The beast's ears flicked forward for a brief moment of interest, and it lowered its massive head to sniff at the pathetic thing. 

It must not have liked what it smelled because it raised its giant hoof above the flailing lump and brought it down.

Hard.

I thought it would crunch; like stepping on an egg, but it didn't. Just a dull *thud* and the crying stopped.

I made a noise then–a gasp or a cry, I can't remember which–and two dozen heads turned in my direction. Two dozen pairs of empty, black eyes, glowing in the moonlight and freezing me in place. The deer didn't move, not so much as the flick of an ear, they just stared. 

The white monster huffed loudly through its nose and pulled its lips back in a snarl that defied the deer body it wore. Its teeth were the teeth of a wolf, dripping with thick ropes of saliva. It stepped forward, the congregated deer silently parting to make room, and approached where I stood at the edge of the clearing. 

I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe, I could barely think. I could feel the ground shaking with every step the beast took, closer and closer until it blocked out the world with a wall of white. It hurt to look directly at its face, but something told me I didn’t dare look away. It wanted me to see, wanted me to feel the full force of its presence. 

It leaned its head down and sniffed me like it had with the baby.

And something changed.

Its ears perked forward. Its mouth relaxed. The deer in the clearing huffed and shifted in anticipation.

The white beast opened its mouth and I was treated to a view of its black tongue and cavernous gullet. I was going to eat me. Swallow me whole. I was the sacrifice it had been wanting. The offering on the altar.

Instead it spoke. Slow, hoarse, forcing words out a throat not made to make them.

"**Daughter…of th..e stars….**"

I didn’t have time to think about what those words meant. The beast touched its muzzle to my stomach and suddenly I wasn't myself anymore.

I was something old, something afraid, something running away. I was hurtling through the stars faster than a human mind could fathom. 

I was burning up in the atmosphere. 

I was crashing through trees and rolling in the grass.

I was getting crushed under the weight of gravity I had never felt before.

I was seeing a creature. With branches on its head that reached the sky. 

I was making myself into it.

I was learning its body, blood, bones, muscles, cells. 

I was seeing a different creature. Small and soft and staring in terror and wonder as I made myself. 

I was making a connection.

I was making a connection.

I was making a conne̷c̷t̷i̷o̶n̶.

I woke up in a mental hospital. The nurse screamed when I asked her where I was. My stomach had distended into a proper pregnant belly.

I had been there for three months; silent, unresponsive, catatonic. 

My husband had found me sitting in the middle of the cornfield, dried bloody tears on my face, staring at the moon.

Just like how Dad had found Mom two years ago. And how Grandpa had found Grandma. 

The doctors asked me all sorts of questions about what had happened to cause what they called a "psychotic break". Nurses tactlessly asked if my husband was beating me, if the stress of taking care of my father could have caused a nervous breakdown. 

I didn’t tell them the truth, of course. Stories about monstrous, alien deer wouldn't inspire much confidence about my mental state. I told them what they wanted to hear, took all the right steps toward a normal recovery, and was released from the hospital a mentally sound woman. All I wanted to do was forget.

But I can't.

I cried when my baby was born. Not for any of the normal reasons, though I pretended that's what it was for Eliott's sake. 

I cried because it was a baby girl. And I've kept crying for her for the last three years. Because I can see it. 

I can see it, just like I'm sure Mom could see it in me. In her big blue eyes that stare at the moon with a seriousness that no toddler should have.

Madness always comes for the women in my family.
