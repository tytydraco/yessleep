My family doesn't age like other people. My grandmother was 98 when she passed, but she looked 65, maybe younger. My great-uncle is 102 and still chops his own firewood. We've always credited it to "good genes" and our one sacred tradition: the "Renewal Stew," served at every major family gathering. It was a rich, dark, savory stew that made you feel warm from the inside out, full of life.

When Grandma Rose died, I was the one who inherited the old family farmhouse. Tucked away in her study, I finally found it: the original, handwritten recipe book, bound in cracked leather. I felt a thrill, like I was finally being let in on the secret.

I opened it to the page for the Renewal Stew. It was mostly blank. There were no ingredients listed for the stew itself, only two cryptic notes in my great-great-grandmother's spidery script:

*For the Broth, see the cellar instructions.* *For the Seasoning, see the attic instructions.*

The cellar was damp and smelled of earth. Behind a stack of old canning jars, I found a loose stone in the wall. Pulling it free revealed a dark, hidden chamber. Inside, arranged in neat rows, were a dozen large, unglazed clay pots filled with a dark, peaty soil. A thick, pale, gnarled root snaked out of the soil in each pot, looking disturbingly like a human hand.

A dusty journal sat on a small table. The entries, dating back to the 1800s, described the process. When a member of our family dies, they aren't buried or cremated. They are "Planted." Their bodies are prepared with a special mixture of herbs and laid to rest in these pots. Over the years, the soil and the body produce a "Life Root." This root is harvested, boiled for three days, and becomes the broth for the Renewal Stew.

I felt a wave of nausea. We weren't just eating stew. We were consuming the concentrated essence of our dead ancestors.

Shaking, I went to the attic. In a locked trunk, I found a collection of small, ornate silver boxes, each engraved with the name of a living family member. I found my own, my name freshly engraved. Inside each box was a small, sharp, obsidian knife. Another journal explained the final step. The "Seasoning." It wasn't a spice. At each gathering, every family member present must make a "living contribution" to the stew. A few drops of blood. A sliver of fingernail. A tear, cried directly into the pot. This offering of the living is what "awakens" the ancestral broth.

I slammed the book shut, my hands trembling. It was a grotesque, cannibalistic ritual. I vowed I would never participate.

The next major gathering was for the autumn equinox. I made an excuse not to go, claiming I had the flu. I felt a sense of righteous defiance.

A week later, my mother called, her voice thin and weak. "Your Aunt Carol isn't doing well," she said. "She's had a... a sudden decline."

I drove to my aunt's house. The woman who opened the door was a stranger. She looked 80 years old, her skin thin and translucent like parchment, her hair patchy and white. But it was Aunt Carol. She was only 58. She looked at me, her eyes wide with a desperate, hungry light.

"You didn't come," she rasped, her hand gripping my arm with surprising strength. Her fingernails were cracked and yellow. "The stew... it wasn't strong enough. It's always weaker when someone is missing."

I finally understood. We don't have "good genes." We have a curse. A rapid, horrifying decay that is constantly trying to claim us. The stew isn't a fountain of youth; it's the only thing that holds the rot at bay. We aren't living long lives; we are desperately, grotesquely staving off an accelerated death.

The winter solstice is next month. My mother called again yesterday. She told me my great-uncle's hands are so stiff he can no longer hold an axe. She told me she found a new gray hair, and when she plucked it, a small patch of skin came with it.

Then she asked if I would be coming home for the solstice. Her voice was casual, but the question hung in the air, heavy and raw.

They need me. They need my contribution.

I'm looking at the small silver box with my name on it. The little black knife sits inside, cold and sharp. I have a choice. I can go, participate in this stomach-churning ritual, and feed the curse to keep my family looking young and vibrant while I know the horrifying truth.

Or I can stay here, clean and pure, and watch them all fall apart, knowing that the same rot is flowing through my own veins, waiting for its turn.
