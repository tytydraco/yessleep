I know I haven’t [updated](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/194j5nl/four_kids_went_missing_last_summer_my_job_is_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in a while, everything got crazy once we got to the hospital. The good news is we got checked out at the hospital and they had a lot of questions about Taylor. The bad news is that we had to run as soon as we realized we were basically trapped in the hospital.

\-

I got my chest checked, and I have a broken rib but nothing overly serious. Normally, I would've taken things easy to let this injury heal but that wasn’t an option right now. Taylor had more serious injuries and for a moment I considered leaving her at the hospital, but we both knew if that monster came back for her it would kill anything in this hospital that got in its way.   
  
I checked myself out and told them I was going to take Taylor to a different hospital, they weren’t hearing that though because I am not her legal guardian. So, I called my friend James who happens to be a doctor. He was going to be my last resort phone call because I didn’t want him mixed up in all of this.   
  
James eventually helped us leave the hospital after I promised him I would explain everything. I wouldn’t let him come with us because I didn’t want to risk his life.   
  
Once we got back outside I helped Taylor to the car and locked all of the doors. We had to go through the box again and see if we could find what the monster wanted, but I also had to make sure we had enough gas to outrun the monster.   
  
\-  
  
“What do you think the monster wants?” I asked Taylor as I got back into the car from filling it up with gas. I also made sure to get us some food and water.   
  
Taylor wasn’t feeling good so I put the backseat down for her, it was the best I could do under the circumstances.   
  
“Probably the whole box,” Taylor mumbled.   
  
I turned around to give her my jacket so she could at least be warm.   
  
The thought of losing all of the evidence made my stomach curl into knots. I could make copies of all of the photos but having the physical items could give us what we need to solve this case sooner.   
  
“Why is it chasing you?” I asked Taylor as we slowly drove around. I was watching the sunset, and as it got lower I could feel my body slowly getting tenser.   
  
\-  
  
“When my family moved to Greenridge, everything was fine for a year. But, everything changed when I started writing for the school newspaper.” Taylor started.   
  
“For, I think six months, I began to notice weird things happening at the school. At first, I was brushing things off. Maybe I was going crazy because of stress or something.” Taylor said before signing loudly.   
  
I could tell she was frustrated.   
  
“Anyway, as the school year went on everything got worse for me. I thought that writing for the school newspaper would keep me distracted but after a while, it didn’t help anymore.” Taylor’s voice cracked as she spoke.   
  
“Anyway, towards the end of the year, people kept dying and the school was closed. I was spending more and more time at my parent's house. One day I went out to grab something from the store and I came back to them dead in the living room. It looked like their skulls had been split open.” Taylor told me before forcing her body to turn to the window.   
  
“I take it the monster started chasing you after that?” I asked Taylor as we turned down another street.   
  
“Yeah, and I have been running from him ever since. I finally ran out of money and that’s when I had to come find you. It was like I was being drawn to you.” Taylor mumbled.   
  
I could tell she was being honest and I didn’t want to push her further.   
  
\-  
  
As I turned down the next street and clenched the steering wheel. It was hard for me to comprehend everything that was happening around me. As weird as it might sound I was coming around to the current situation extremely fast.   
  
Something about what was going on felt so wrong but being in the car with Taylor, it felt like I was supposed to be here.   
  
\-  
  
I watched the sunset but this time we were ready to be chased.   
  
“Taylor? Buckle up.” I called to the backseat as I drove slightly faster down the street. I would slow down periodically when I could see other cars coming. Luckily, I knew how to stay on the backroads as much as possible.   
  
As I drove I could hear Taylor going through the box.   
  
“I found something.” She eventually told me.   
  
“I can’t turn around and look. Our mutual friend will be here soon.” I said as I checked the mirrors. This monster is going to need a name. My thought process was that giving it a name would somehow make it less scary.   
  
“A card hidden in the backpack straps,” Taylor said as she tried to sit up and turn on the light. I quickly reached back to do it for her.   
  
“It says enter this address into the GPS.” Taylor shrugged as she handed me the card. I slowed the car down to read the address on the back and enter it into the GPS.   
  
“We should name the monster,” I said to Taylor as I entered the address.   
  
“Why?” She asked me.   
  
“I think it will make it less scary,” I said honestly.   
  
“Fine but we can’t call him just any name,” Taylor said seriously. I checked the mirror and could see her smiling a bit. I made a mental note to check the name Snowball or Mr. Hooks off of my list of names.   
  
\-  
  
I watched the GPS freak out for a second. She told me to keep driving down the street and suddenly hook a left, if I had listened to the GPS we would’ve hit a tree.   
  
“What’s going on?” Taylor asked.   
  
I was going to answer her but I could hear the familiar sound of a chain hitting the street. The monster was behind us, if it was in front of us I would’ve seen it in the lights.   
  
“Caleb.” Taylor hissed at me.   
  
“I know,” I said as I checked the mirrors.   
  
Sure enough, the monster was rushing us from behind. I didn’t have time to wonder where it came from or how it found us, I slammed my foot on the gas and drove down the street as fast as possible.   
  
As we drove down the street the GPS was screaming at us, it kept telling us to keep going straight.   
  
The monster was gaining on us fast, I was trying to keep an eye on it and the road at the same time.   
  
“Caleb! Watch out!” Taylor screamed at me.   
  
I blinked and swerved the car to the right, I almost hit someone who was driving down the street. I checked behind us and watched the car drive through the monster like it wasn’t there. The creature disappeared into a cloud of mist before reforming in the spot where it was standing.   
  
“You have got to be fucking kidding me.” I snapped before driving again.   
  
The GPS was screaming at us to continue down the road and we didn’t have anywhere to go anyway. I thought I knew these roads by heart but I was taken aback when the machine suddenly snapped at me to turn left.   
  
I did a quick double-check and turned left as the machine demanded. The moment I hit this road I looked back and saw the monster standing behind us, it wasn’t following us down the road. At first, I was relieved but this monster had followed us everywhere. I couldn’t help but wonder why it didn’t want to follow us here.   
  
\-  
  
“It stopped,” Taylor said under her breath.   
  
I slowed the car down and continued driving down the street. Eventually, I could see a large neon sign glowing in the distance.   
  
Welcome to the Steadfast Hotel, glowing a bright red color and flashing.   
  
The hotel stood about four floors from what we could see outside. I was shocked, I had never heard of this place, and as far as I always knew the road we took to get here didn’t exist.   
  
There was no way in hell I was going to leave Taylor in the car so I got out and helped her up.   
  
“Where are we?” She asked me as I gently lifted her up.    
  
“A hotel that a couple of the kids I’m investigating went to. Do me a favor and stay close. I won’t be able to carry you inside.” I told Taylor as I shut the door with my foot and walked to the front door of the hotel.   
  
I placed Taylor down and held the door open for her. As we both walked in I took in the hotel lobby. The carpet was a nice clean gray color and the walls were all painted charcoal black. The curtains were white and the trim of the lobby was white as well.  
  
Hanging in the middle of the lobby was a huge chandelier, to the side of the front desk there was a large staircase leading to the second floor.   
  
As we approached the front desk a man smiled at us. He had shaggy brown hair and light green eyes, it looked like he was wearing colored contact lenses.   
  
“Hi.” I started to say but the man cut me off.   
  
“We’ve been expecting you, Caleb. Taylor, you’re late. Lotus will not take kindly to you both being so late. Before you can speak to him you must complete your Black Card task to prove that you possess a gift.” The man said. I could tell by his tone that he wasn’t joking.   
  
\-   
  
“We don’t have a black card,” Taylor said to the man.   
  
“Yes, you do.” He insisted.   
  
I took a deep breath and prepared myself to argue further, but I could see the monster entering the lobby through the glass doors. It was walking in here like it owned the place.   
  
“Your test is here.” The man said as he reached under the counter.   
  
“We knew you wouldn’t understand so we prepared your weapons in advance.” He continued as he placed the case on the desk.   
  
Everything felt like it was moving in slow motion. I was tempted to take Taylor and run up the stairs with her.   
  
The man opened the case and spun it around so I could see.   
  
Sitting before us was a jet-black revolver and a long metal rod with a bird on the top. I instinctively reached for the gun and watched Taylor take the staff. Holding the weapon in my hand felt right, it felt good.   
  
As I held the revolver I turned to face the door, this time I was going to kill this thing.   
“Use your ammunition wisely.” The man behind the counter said.   
  
“Taylor. Take the staff, you will have to use it on the monster so it can die.” The man told Taylor before opening a magazine.   
  
He was ready to sit here when a monster came into the lobby. He didn’t seem bothered, it was as if this was a normal day for him.   
  
I was tired of being chased around. I was tired of having no answers, and I was fed up with the lack of weird shit happening to me and this girl. The moment the monster ripped the doors open I fired a round at its chest.   
  
At the same time, the creature swung its chain and hit the bullet from the air. It was blink and you’ll miss it moment. I have never seen anything like that before. I was stunned.   
  
“Caleb,” Taylor screamed.   
  
Something hit me in the chest, this time with enough force to throw me back and make me cough up blood. My head was spinning and my vision was fading. Everything hurt, I clenched my hand around my gun and slowly sat up. As I coughed more blood into my lap I glanced around the room for Taylor.   
  
She was trying to keep as much distance between her and the monster as possible. But I could tell she wasn’t going to be able to move much longer, she was sweating bullets. She wasn’t healed enough for a fight like this.   
  
I quickly brought the gun up and fired two shots at the monster. I wheezed and coughed up more blood right after. It felt like I was going to die.   
  
As the bullets hit the creature, it slowly dropped to one knee and Taylor slammed her staff into the monster's neck. I watched the staff light up, it was extremely pretty. The glow lit up the whole room.   
  
It hurts to breathe.   
  
I couldn’t breathe.   
  
\-  
  
When I woke up I was laying in a bed with a blue blanket pulled up to my chest. I quickly sat up, pain surging through my body. Taylor was sleeping in a separate bed closer to the window.   
  
As I looked around I spotted a note on the nightstand next to me.   
  
“Lotus will see you both at 6. Don’t be late. Further instructions were left for you on the nightstand.” I read out loud.   
  
I let my body fall back and took a deep breath.
