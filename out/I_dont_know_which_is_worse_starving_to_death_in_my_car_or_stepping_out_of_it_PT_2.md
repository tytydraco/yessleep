[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/muIIi0dPKy)

I’m so cold. I woke up shivering; I can’t even see out of my windows anymore. Beforehand I could at least see the ground and some of the Texaco island and its pumps. Now, all I can see is white. I’ve been wondering if I died in the car and now this is my purgatory; maybe that’d explain why I saw Caine outside after writing my last post before passing out.

Caine. I should probably get back to what led up to this. To me being in my metal coffin; my old red car.

In the hotel, my sleep was so fragmented. Maybe it was worrying about the escape plan potentially failing. I kept waking up and falling asleep, the smell of the dead woman’s blood hanging in the air like a metallic cloud. Every time I woke up, my body was drenched in sweat, and I had to flip my pillow, even though the room was freezing. I think the building was so old it just didn’t have radiators.

I vaguely remember a dream about Rachel. I had escaped Hawthorne’s Ridge and was in her arms, crying. I told her how much she meant to me and how much I loved her and the baby. She was obviously confused because I didn’t dare tell her what I’d been through, but she said she loved me too.

Years passed in the dream; my child turned out to be a boy, who we named Sebastian after her father. Sebastian ended up doing track in high school.

We didn’t raise an extraordinary child. If anything, Sebastian was as average a person as could be. He rebelled, hung out with the bad crowd, maybe smoked a few things before eventually maturing. I’d become a grandfather to a beautiful girl.

Me and Rachel would grow old together, maybe in the South Carolina countryside. My life would’ve been nothing special, but I still would’ve enjoyed it because I had her with me. I’d never be like my dad. I’d never cheat on Rachel.

But then it’d turn from a dream to a nightmare. Rachel’s pupils would expand until the irises were just physically impossible to see, and the whites of her eyes would go misty. Her mouth would constantly be opened, and she’d blankly stare at me.

She’d become hollow. Even after getting out of Hawthorne’s Ridge, the nightmare would come back for me. She’d reach out for me and that’s when I’d finally wake up. Terrified.

When the room was illuminated by the natural light of the window, Caine was already buckling his belt and putting his leather jacket on. He was combing his long black hair when he noticed that I was awake and bubbled: “Morning! We’ve got a big day ahead of us, Jackson!”

I assumed he was so happy because of the prospect of finally leaving. I got out of bed, stretched, and washed my face in the attached bathroom. The bathtub was filled entirely with dangerous items by someone who was in the same spot as us. Which either means he was successful in escaping or was hollowed out.

Caine moved aside a few cans of gasoline and some rope, and he handed me a small pistol. I looked up at him, feeling dread sinking in. I had taken a defensive course for journalists before, but it was entirely physical. No weapons included. Not to mention, I had done the course five years ago at that point.

“Can’t you just handle the guns?” I remember asking him. He looked at me as if I’d said something completely unintelligible, like how the sky was actually purple and fuzzy, and the only reason humans never noticed was because of us all being collectively colorblind.

He responded by telling me that it was “just in case” and how he didn’t want to save my ass constantly. That made me laugh; I hadn’t laughed in years at that point.

Caine loaded his shotgun and kicked the door open to keep his hands firmly placed on the trigger, just in case there was a hollow one waiting for us on the outside. Looking back, he kept on saying "just in case." It really brings into perspective how hopeful he was of getting out.

We went downstairs. Last night, there was a hollow one standing behind a check-in desk of sorts, but it was completely empty as we walked past. I looked on the carpeted floor behind the desk and saw the man’s shoe prints. There was a hole in the left heel. The indent was so deep; it was almost as if the man planted himself behind the counter and stood there for years.

Knowing the nature of the hollow ones, that’s probably more of an educated guess.

We walked along the street, passing various hollow ones who were standing as still as statues. I could feel their stares, even though they didn’t move; I just kept my head down. There wasn’t exactly anything to look at anyway. Hawthorne’s Ridge just consisted of corridors and corridors of old buildings and storefronts with empty roads in the middle.

When we reached my car at the gas station, we stopped dead in our tracks when we noticed that a hollow one was standing at the driver’s side door. Before I could propose an idea like entering through the passenger’s side door, Caine grabbed the hollow one by the shoulders and threw them to the ground.

He stomped his boots on their face; it was a man with wavy hair in a hoodie and jeans. I feel like he was trying to send a message to the other hollow ones because of the stomping being so loud; don’t come near us and you’ll be fine.

I had to constantly remind myself that the hollow ones only used to be human. They were just vegetables some higher power controlled.

I got into the driver’s side door as Caine filled up the gas tank. After finishing, he jumped in and I keyed the ignition...

The car didn’t start.

Caine looked at me and asked what was wrong. I knew what it was immediately.

My car is really old; I got it from my dad as a birthday present. Coincidentally, it was the exact same model he used to have, and I got it shortly after he bought himself a brand new Porsche.

The car needed to get some friction before it could move. Caine offered to do it because he said I was “built like a bundle of sticks.” He exited the passenger side and started pushing the car from the back, while I tried the ignition. I was worried about flooding the engine when I heard the engine roar.

I opened the passenger door and shouted at Caine through it to get in as I cruised as slowly as possible. I saw Caine run towards the car through the rearview mirror, grab onto the open door before hoisting himself in, and shutting the door. His face was red; likely because he hadn’t done much moving during his 3 weeks in town. Despite that, he kept a wide grin.

He instructed me on where to go. The nearest exit of Hawthorne’s Ridge was past the town hall; Caine practically knew the layout of the town by heart. Just imagining him wandering around all by himself in this ghost town made me feel bad for him. He told me how he tried to ride his motorcycle out of town and how it was practically like a treadmill;

Back then he was moving but wasn’t making any progress. The exit somehow went farther away every time he checked, as if the ground itself was shifting.

I was driving quickly with my foot on the gas pedal when Caine suddenly exclaimed happily and started shaking me. His joy was infectious. I looked over at him and asked him what the hell had gotten into him while grinning myself. He told me how we got past a part he never could on his motorcycle. The plan was going to work.

I was beyond happy to say the least. I started putting the pedal to the metal, not caring about a traffic collision because of the desolate state of the Hawthorne’s Ridge roads. Everything was blurring past.

Looking back now, if the story ended there, it’d be a happy one. A happy one where I was in a creepy place, but made a good friend along the way.

We passed by that playground when we saw the first hollow one standing in the road; it was a little girl with pigtails. I know I tried to convince myself that it wasn’t malicious since they were just empty husks, but I didn’t have the heart to run her over. I swerved strongly.

I thought the car was going to crash because we were easily going over 80 at that point. Caine had to hold onto the steering wheel to avoid a crash because it was going in every direction. He wasn’t shaking me anymore and practically jumping for joy in his seat, he was asking me why the hell I almost killed us.

I felt good regardless.

I thought the little girl was going to be one of the only ones on the road.. So you can imagine my shock when we reached the town’s exit and saw a large crowd of hollow ones staring blankly at us. I had no time to brake, so I rammed into them. I felt guilt but I pressed on regardless.

And that’s when the road fought back. I heard a crack from beneath the car and figured one of the bodies we plowed through must’ve hit something important, but then I realized we were practically going up a hill. The road had somehow risen to the height of a rollercoaster.

I wanted to just let go of the gas and let the car go down the newly created hill, but we had gone too far at that point. I continued up the hill which ended abruptly. We plummeted down to the ground with a loud bang; I just knew the car was fucked, but I kept driving.

But the exit was gone. Instead, there were just more buildings and roads. I didn’t see anything on the road so I drove slowly.

And we ended up back at the gas station. We had somehow looped around.

Caine was hyperventilating. At first, I thought it was because of the adrenaline of how fast we were driving and the hill that emerged from absolutely nowhere, or perhaps fear... But nope, he was absolutely furious. He kicked his door open and kicked a rusty metal trash can next to a pump.

He shouted, “IT’S NOT FUCKING FAIR! I WANT OUT OF HERE! I WANT OUT I WANT OUT—”

His face had gone a bright shade of red and I was fully convinced that foam was going to come out of his mouth, but instead he just shouted profanities. I didn’t feel any of the despair of the failure yet because I was too preoccupied by Caine’s emotional outburst.

I got out of my car and walked slowly on the cracked pavement towards Caine; I was slightly worried that he was going to let his anger out on me, so I was approaching him the same way one would approach a hungry carnivore.

I placed a hand on his shoulder and he immediately spun his head towards me and pointed the shotgun he was keeping tucked in his belt at my head. He must’ve assumed I was a hollow one approaching... Although looking back, I have no clue why he didn’t think it was me at first. He had to have heard my car door opening.

 He lowered his gun and I asked him if he wanted to get a drink at the supermarket. He sighed and agreed.

I hate thinking about what happened next because it was all my fault. I didn’t summon the hollow ones to our location, but I was the one who suggested going to the supermarket. If I didn’t, Caine would still be alive right now.

We walked through the fog, and we didn’t see them coming. At first, we only felt them on the ground and saw small pebbles moving; at first, my mind instantly went to an earthquake, but then I realized it was a stampede of hollow ones. And we were surrounded.

 Caine started blasting immediately with guns I didn’t even know he had, but even though he kept shooting them down, more came. There seemed to be thousands; I remember deliriously wondering how many drifters and tourists had fallen into the same trap as us, but were caught.

I took the pistol he gave me and I hesitated. I didn’t want to shoot one. I only did it once when a girl tried to touch me with both of her arms extended in the air as if she were a zombie. My heart skipped a beat when I realized that it was the same girl from the road.

I felt like I couldn’t breathe, everything became dizzy and I could actually feel my heart beating in my chest. I was on the verge of vomiting when one of those things touched me.

Caine told me what it was like to be touched by one of those things, and by god, was he accurate. My memories, emotions, and thoughts slowly started leaving me. I also felt as if I couldn’t move my muscles and my vision and hearing were starting to fade.

Just before everything went black, I heard Caine bellow something, although it sounded weak from my perspective. I think it was ‘LEAVE HIM ALONE!’

Next thing I knew I was back to normal. Caine had pushed away the hollow one that was trying to turn me into one of them and he was using my pistol I dropped to shoot some more.

When I was coming to my senses, I got a few flashes:
Attached to every single hollow one was a meaty, pulsating string which led directly to the ground… And I saw something under the ground. The thing that was controlling the hollow human beings.

It was an amorphous blob that was pale to the point of almost being white. It had multiple of everything as if it couldn’t decide what it wanted to be; there were multiple eyes which were albino, mouths hung open to reveal rows of sharp teeth, arms which protruded from every single angle of the body and grabbed at nothing.

The creature, or should I call it the puppet master, started off round at the bottom, but only got smaller and smaller until the top formed what looked either like a head or an antenna. The pulsating strings were connected to the very top of it.

Caine was starting to get overwhelmed by the amount of hollow ones, and I reached out to help him, but he only pushed me away and told me to “GET THE FUCK AWAY.”

I didn’t know what else to do, so I just ran. My legs seemed to have a mind of their own as I sprinted in between the large, desolate, and old empty buildings. I couldn’t see through the dense fog, so I was paranoid that at any moment a hollow one would jump out and try to turn me... Turn me like what they did to Caine.

I didn’t know where else to go, so I just ran back to my car and locked the door. And that’s why I’ve been trapped here for days... Or weeks. I can’t tell anymore.
If I could describe the process of myself wasting away, I’d compare it to a race of some sorts. Sometimes starvation is in the lead and I feel as if my stomach is trying to practically eat itself. Other times starvation was in the lead and it made me feel as if my throat was composed entirely of rough sandpaper. What was constant was the overwhelming feeling of my body weakening and shutting down.
I didn’t want to sleep at first because I was paranoid. Fog surrounded my car, so what if I slept for just a few minutes and the hollow ones decided to use it as an opportunity to break open the windows and get me. I think that’s why I started to hallucinate. At first it was just small things. I smelled things that possibly couldn’t have been there; like smoke or rotting fruit. For a second, I thought my hand had fused with the lining of the car, but as I pulled it away, I felt no sensation of ripping.

With each passing day, my eyelids grew heavier and heavier, moving a single inch of my body became a herculean task. I passed out eventually. I had a nightmare, and it just consisted of me walking through a dark hallway as something with a deep voice murmured words in a language I won’t bother pretending to comprehend. When I woke up, I saw the outlines of two still figures outside my windscreen; I knew from the sensation that something was staring at me that it was a hollow one.
I tried my car, but the engine flooded. It was old, I needed somebody to push it in order to get moving. Caine would’ve done it with a wisecrack to go along with it, but he was gone. I remember on my first night in the car, I kept on insisting to myself, despite better judgment, that he could still be saved. Or perhaps he ran away and was hiding in an abandoned building with enough firepower to kill anything.

A few days in, I tried to stretch my legs by going into the back seat and standing up as far as I possibly could before my head reached the roof, but that wouldn’t be hard because I’m 6’3. My back seats are filled to the brim with empty wrappers and boxes from fast food restaurants; living on the road doesn’t exactly guarantee home-cooked meals, after all.
My hands were shaking so badly as I went to move the boxes, which felt as if they weighed 200 pounds. When I made it to the back and tried to stand up, my legs collapsed. I think I heard a crack; it probably doesn't matter.
I’ve tried using my phone. I have bars, and it says I have internet, but none of my calls have been going through. I thought it did one time when I heard the voice of an old woman, but it started to distort as I explained my situation. I heard a distorted cackle from the other end, and then the woman hung up on me.

I didn’t bother using my phone after that. I’m only using it now to write this post, and I better hurry up soon because it’s at 20%. I dreaded when I needed to use the bathroom. At first, I was planning on rolling open my window and doing my business through it, but the thought of one of those things touching me when I’m so vulnerable is deeply uncomfortable. I couldn’t afford to do it in the car because the smell of rot was getting worse and worse, so I shat and pissed in an empty hamburger box and threw it out the window. Bomb’s away.

It was almost as if I stumbled across the holy grail when I was holding one of the empty cups in the back seat and felt sloshing inside. I didn’t bother checking what it was; I drank with a ferocity. I needed to fix my dry throat, which was making it harder to breathe. It appeared as if there was flat coke or Pepsi in the cup; I can’t taste the difference.
I do remember checking my phone, and it said I had been in the car for about 7 days at that point. The silhouettes of the hollow ones in the fog always seemed to be shifting around the car every day. The worst of it was when it was directly beside the driver’s side window.
I saw myself in the rearview mirror. It didn’t look like me; it just looked like a skeleton that had draped my skin and clothes over its body. I touched my arm and could feel the bones protruding from various different directions; my skin felt flaky and stretched out.

Past the first week, I started hearing things. I thought I heard Caine’s voice, but it was probably just me remembering him because it was something he said previously about how we had a big day. Maybe my mind was replaying what he said like an old vinyl in the hopes of warding off insanity.
Despite the drink, I could feel my tongue swelling up in my mouth and becoming dry. Even if someone who wasn't infected by that... Monster under the ground walked by the car, I probably wouldn’t be able to say anything.
I found another drink in one of the styrofoam cups in the back, but I wondered to myself how long I was possibly going to keep that up.

Days passed and I felt like a zombie. My head was beating strongly, and I had nothing to dull the pain, so I just stared out into the fog for hours upon hours without even realizing it.
I don’t know when, but I did vomit over the back seat and pass out. When I woke up, I saw Rachel.
Maybe it was just a primal reaction, but when I saw her, I felt tears running down my face. I didn’t care. She was completely radiant with her golden blonde and smattering of freckles across her face; I noticed the baby bump on her stomach, and I didn’t feel worse. In fact, I wanted to be there for my unborn baby more than anything.

…I was about to open the door without even realizing it when she spoke. It sounded exactly like her, but something was off. The window was sealed, but despite that, I could hear her voice perfectly as it beckoned me to come out. She sounded as if she was right beside me, even though she was behind the window.
I opened the window enough for my frail arm to slip through and tried to touch her. Just as I was about to, I blinked, and during the split second from when my eyes were shut to open, she had disappeared.
I was hallucinating.

Moving has been really painful. It’s almost as if my bones are made of glass shards that are constantly piercing my flesh and making wounds even deeper.
I started wondering where the hell that thing from under the ground: the puppet master, came from… And then it hit me. When I was driving across middle America researching roadside attractions, I came across this establishment called “Crazy Larry’s.” It was filled with “Rare unseen beasts,” which were obviously taxidermied and fake.
But there was a room with an empty shattered glass cage. A sign said Larry had found it during his first-ever expedition into a cave system in a local town, and it escaped shortly after and its current location was unknown.

The sign said the creature was blind because it was born in the caves, and the puppet master looked albino during my brief glimpse of it.
But for all I know, that creature has been on earth before the roads it resides under were even paved. Larry seemed almost giddy when I asked him about the glass cage after the tour. It seemed like bullshit when I heard it, and it might still be bullshit; after a certain point in the car, I probably would’ve believed anything.
I’m pretty much in a glass cage right now, and the creature is ogling at me.

Are you familiar with the concept of someone’s life flashing before their eyes..? That’s what started to happen to me during an unknown date in the car. It isn’t literal; you don’t suddenly get flashes of the most important parts of your life. Instead, everything seems to replay in front of you.
I looked out my left window at a row of buildings, and on a curb there was... A younger me, 14 maybe, sitting next to a boy from my old homeroom class. I remembered what happened exactly. It was my birthday, and he had stolen a bottle of vodka from the local corner shop. I watched as an observer as we drank the clear liquid and started heaving.

And just like that, the younger me and my friend on the curb disappeared. I grinned faintly, the memory being funny to me in hindsight.
I looked to my side, the seat that was once empty was now filled by a child who was not much older than 7; I recognized him because of his uneven dark brown hair and because I had seen him in various framed photos around my house. It was a younger me.
I heard pounding on the window next to the little me and saw my father. I knew what this memory was; I had locked him out of his car, and he was furious. When I got out of the car, he belted me.

I could almost feel the stinging sensation of the belt on my adult body, and just like the vodka memory, it disappeared. 

The final memory was the hardest. I looked at the playground which was a good bit away; at first it was a reminder of the child I was scared of having, but now there was two kids playing in it. Younger me and Rachel. 

I remembered what happened, you never forget your first kiss after all. She was saying goodbye because her father had gotten a promotion which meant she had to leave the state, and she suddenly pecked me on the cheek with a kiss before running away giggling. I watched it happen from my car as an outsider and I broke down.

Even though I was freezing in the car, I could feel the warm summer air on my arms. I could feel the impact of her lips on my cheek. Normally that memory would’ve been sweet and something fond to look back on, but now it was just a reminder of who I was never going to see again. 

I leaned my head against the dashboard and closed my eyes. I could feel tears coming and I didn’t fight them. I heard other memories play out, people cheering happily from my graduation party, some of my old college roommates chanting my nickname like they were gospel singers. I didn’t open my eyes for any of them. 

Eventually I fell asleep. 

When I woke up the memories were gone. It hit me like a truck when I realised that because my life was flashing before my eyes via hallucinations, it meant that I was dying… I had completely ignored that because of the pain from my headache and starvation. They had become dull pains in my weak body. 

And so I took out my phone and started writing my last post as a form of eulogy, and as a warning to stay the fuck out of Hawthorne’s Ridge no matter what.

..And with that, you’re pretty much completely up to date. 

When I woke up and started writing this second post I mentioned seeing Caine. That was only a few hours ago but just the thought of it is enough to put me in an even more terrible mood. 

I woke up at an unknown time, entirely focused on finishing this post despite my eyesight deteriorating and becoming more blurred. I typed and typed even though my hands were shaky and could barely hold the phone.. I was only distracted when I heard a scraping at the window next to me. 

I turned and I saw Caine, or to be more accurate Caine’s body being controlled by the creature. The scraping must’ve come from the rings which were hanging loosely on his emaciated fingers. Seeing him finally confirmed that he was gone, despite my delusional hopes otherwise. 

He stared at me blankly like the other hollow ones, but his face was pressed firmly against the glass. His pupils were dilated to the point of his irises being non-existent and the whites of his eyes were misty like the other hollow ones.. But there was something different. 

He was smiling. His grin was wider than any human possibly could’ve done. 

I looked into his dilated pupils, they were inky black. It was like staring straight into a portrait of hell… And I could tell that the creature puppeteering his body was looking through them. I could also tell that it was relishing in my slow decay. 

I couldn’t shed any more tears. I was emotionally drained at that point. So I just looked down at my phone and kept on typing this post. After I finished the previous sentence I looked where Caine once was, and now he’s gone. 

And with that, I’d like to say goodbye. By tomorrow morning I’ll probably be dead. 

I’ve been looking back on this post for hours now, thinking..

I planned on my goodbyes being the final thing I ever wrote, but then I thought about my unborn child and my own father. 

My father was someone who liked to make me and my mother feel small. If he wasn’t doing that he was distant. And then mom found out that he was cheating on her with some woman who was half his age. I think about my father with disdain even though I haven’t seen him in years. 

And so I wonder how my child would react if he read this after my death. They’d probably assume that I was nothing more than a coward. And if they don’t, both them and Rachel would assume I just got in my car and abandoned the both of them when I love them more than anything in this whole world.

I regret deciding to write this article about roadside attractions. I did it because I had recently learned that Rachel was pregnant and was terrified; I was running away, even though it was subconscious. 

But after my time in Hawthorne’s Ridge I realise how terrible I’ve been. I want to be there for both of them. I want to watch my child grow up, and I want to do it with Rachel at my side.

This has invigorated me. I’ve been devising a plan, and I think I’ve finally got something in mind. 

I’m going to burn this town to the ground. It’s fitting; it's been my hell on earth for what feels like decades. 

I’ve been stuck in my car at a texaco this whole time, so I’m going to start by dousing the entire gas station in gasoline before throwing my lighter on it.. And then I’m going to return to the hotel and pour gasoline all over the buildings, they’re all linked together so the fires would probably spread quickly. 

The idea of the smoke becoming more dense than the fog is exciting me. If that happens, when the smoke clears I’d finally be able to see the sky again. 

I think there’s a high chance that I might die as I attempt this. I’m feeling weak all over and I feel like I’m going to collapse at any moment… but I also feel like this might finally put an end to that creature under the ground. It seems like its albino and nocturnal, so maybe the fire would kill it. 

And if I kill it, the hollow ones will finally be put to rest and Hawthorne’s Ridge will revert back to what it always should’ve been: an innocent town in middle America. 

I’d rather die in a final stand than alone in a car. To my child, I love you

And to whoever’s reading this post, thank you. If I don’t respond to any comments or make a follow-up post you can likely assume what happened to me.

Goodbye. I’m now leaving the car with my lighter.
