It’s been days since I’ve gotten my last order. I think I pissed off whatever has been giving me these orders since I pounded on that door. Even without getting the orders, I still feel like I’m being watched like a pair of eyes is always glaring at me. 

I’ve started seeing shapes staring at me out of the corner of my eye. When I turn to look, they’re always gone. I’ve been losing sleep too. This constant feeling of being watched has caused my anxiety to worsen. I lay in bed, unable to shake this feeling. 

Last night, I had had enough, and at around 4:40 AM, I decided I had to do something. I got up, grabbed my keys, and decided to go back to the Butcher Shop. I left my dorm at 5 AM. 

The drive was the same as always. When I got to the turn that used to be the butcher shop, it was that old, decrepit road once more. As I followed the road, a light lit up on my dashboard. I was almost out of gas.

 I kept driving even though my gas light was on. It’s not like I could have turned around if I wanted to; the trees on both sides pressed in close, the branches almost touching over the top of my car. 

My eyes felt heavier; the lost sleep from the past few days was finally setting in. I don’t remember when I started nodding off. My eyes would flick open, then close again, heavy like someone was pulling them down. Every time I blinked, the road looked a little different. The trees were closer. The light from my dashboard seemed to pulse, like it was breathing. 

I tried everything to stay awake. I slapped my face a few times, pinching my arm, and I even tried something I saw online once, where you squeeze your shoulder blades together, but nothing was working. I turned my radio on as a last-ditch effort, praying the sound of static would be enough to keep me awake, but it wasn’t.

When I woke up, it was 5:55 AM. My car was parked in front of the store. When I checked my phone, I saw I had an order. I rubbed my eyes and got out of my car. As I walked up to the freezer, I saw a bag full of snacks and energy drinks leaning up against a gas canister with a note taped to it that read: “AAA - Fresh Meats.” 

I didn’t question it, I grabbed the bag and the gas can and went back to my car. The gas can was tiny, only able to hold about 3 gallons of fuel. When I was done filling up, the canister still had some fuel left in it. I set it down next to the freezer and grabbed the new order. When I turned my car on, I saw I had a full tank of gas. 

Not wanting to piss this *thing* off again, I set off for my destination. This was my longest drive by far, just about 50 miles away. I cracked open one of the energy drinks and began the long drive.
