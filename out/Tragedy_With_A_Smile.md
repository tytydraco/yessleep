You know what they say about weddings and funerals, right? They bring everyone together? What a fucking joke. I remember Uncle Derwin’s funeral as if it happened yesterday. That’s when it all began. When I lost control. We often take for granted the fact that our body is ours to move and shape to our whim. A world in which a muscle stops working or some paralysis takes hold is nearly unthinkable. At least, until it happens. Then it’s suddenly all “woe is me”, as if days earlier we weren’t making jokes about wheelchair users or stroke victims. Empathy, what a crazy concept! Anyways, I digress. I am not paralyzed nor wheelchair bound. My affliction is something a little bit more… bizarre. 

I was attending my uncle’s funeral after he had passed away in a drunk driving accident. He was the drunk driver, no surprises there. I was never particularly close to him, but my family insisted I go. My dad was especially distraught about his brother’s death. He loved Derwin, flaws and all. How someone can be so forgiving, I’ll never understand. But I can respect it. I can respect anyone who chooses to be kind out of their own free will. Especially given that sometimes it’s just so much easier to be apathetic. 

There were less than twenty people attending the service. Some of them I recognized as Derwin’s work friends. There were also a few older couples near the front pews who I didn’t know. Maybe his neighbors? He was a pretty neighborly guy, so that wasn’t out of the question. Whatever the case, enough bridges had been burned that the service was not anything huge. The circumstances of his death likely didn’t help matters. Hell, it was a closed casket for a reason. What I did notice is that no one was crying. I’d imagine that one of the most humbling afterlife experiences is to watch as no one cries at your funeral, but what do I know?

It was during my dad’s eulogy speech for Derwin that the sensation began. I had been in a cycle of frowning and having a neutral facial expression for most of the funeral, which I think is understandable. Such a dour endeavor isn’t exactly conducive to bright smiles. I was also bored out of my mind, which probably wasn’t helping. 

“He had more love in his heart than anyone I know. I think he would be happy to see all these faces here today at this service,” my dad said, tearing up. “I know he’s up there, somewhere, watching us.”

It was at this point that I noticed my facial muscles start to shift. I tried to get it under control, but they seemed to have a will of their own. I remember thinking to myself how unusual it was for a muscle cramp or spasm to have such strength. Before I could figure out what to do, it happened. A wide smile spread across my face right as my dad gave a tearful last few words. I froze. 

“And may we all cherish our time here. It’s what Derwin would’ve wanted,” my dad finished. He stared me dead in the eye, a puzzled look on his face at my expression. Then anger.

Maybe it was just him who saw me. Maybe it was the whole room. I was so shell-shocked that everything became a blur. What the fuck had just happened? And how was I supposed to explain it? Sure, the last words were touching, but not to the point that I should’ve had a grin even a comedian would be flattered by. I was too suffused with panic to even consider trying to figure out a rational explanation. My face didn’t show it, though. The grin was still wide and shit-eating. The muscles in my face were starting to ache.

As we left through the church’s open doors, my dad didn’t speak a word to me. The smile had eventually diminished once the service came to an end, but that didn’t suddenly erase what happened. The gray sky above did little to lift my mood. And if it started raining, well… safe to say I would not be having a good time. 

“Do you want me to drive?” I asked, breaking the silence. 

My dad looked at me in response with such tired eyes, I could hardly fathom it. He trembled a little, but still didn’t speak. He kept the keys to his truck clutched in an iron grip. I guess I couldn’t really blame him. As far as he was concerned, I was having the time of my life all while he grieved over his brother’s death. Maybe he thought I was high out of my mind or something like that. Sure, I had smoked some weed prior to the service, but nothing that would cause that sort of physiological response. I could only hope that the sudden smile was a fluke. A misfired nerve. Like winning the bad lottery. 

We got in the truck, silence still permeating the space. As the truck came to life, *Summer Breeze* emanated out from the speakers. My dad quickly turned the music off. He had played it on the way there to provide some levity before the funeral. It was clear to me that it was the last thing he wanted to hear right now, especially since the sun had been covered with clouds between the start and end of the service. I was so wound up inside I thought I might burst. Here was the only family left in my life, no longer willing to speak to me. And off something I had no control over. There is no worse feeling. It was like being blamed for something you didn’t do as a kid. It is utter helplessness in its purest form. 

“Why did you smile?” my dad finally asked, his voice cracking a little. There was no anger, not even disappointment. It just sounded hollow. “Is everything a joke to you?”

My heart sank. He didn’t think I was high or drunk or whatever. He thought I just plain didn’t care. It hurt. It hurt a lot. My dad always tried to see the best in everyone, Derwin being a perfect example of that. For me to shift his worldview towards the side of pessimism was beyond painful. I wanted to tell him the truth, but how was I supposed to do that when I didn’t know what the truth even was? It would just sound like I was making shit up. Making excuses. Now that was something I was good at, and unfortunately everyone knew it. It’s reasonable for one not to believe a repeated liar. I had made my bed, and here came a time where laying in it was the only option. I said the only thing I could.

“I don’t know what happened. It was not intentional, I swear.”

If I was unable to offer a solid explanation, the next best idea was to perform damage control. Out of all the relationships I was fine with fracturing, the one I had with my dad was not among them. There would be no one left to go to if I messed this up.

In my peripheral vision, I saw his face soften. “I believe you,” he said, though he still refused to look back at me. I couldn’t blame him for that. My uncanny resemblance to his brother probably did not help matters. I was a dead ringer for Derwin. Strange, the curveballs that life can throw at you even from birth. To have so little control over that is unsettling to say the least.

The drive home gave me a while to recollect myself and come up with a proper explanation. I decided I would go with the idea of it being a strange sort of muscle spasm. I would tell my dad that it was painful, even if that was a lie. In actuality, it felt euphoric when I allowed the smile to take shape. Like it was the right thing to do in some universal equation. I was rewarded for it, as though I was a dog performing a trick to receive a treat. I brushed away such thoughts, trying instead to figure out how I could word it. There was no need to further freak myself out. The funeral had already provided plenty of that. 

We eventually approached the driveway to the house. I had my own apartment, but visiting my childhood home never felt like a chore. Under these conditions, however, it was a bit of a different story. The air was laden with a tension no impromptu explanation could allay. Although what I had said earlier did have a brief placating effect, it was clear to me that my dad still wasn’t content. As he wordlessly opened the door for me to enter the house, I opted to speak up.

“I think it was a muscle spasm, but it was unlike any I’ve had before. It was extremely painful, and I’m sorry it happened at such a bad time,” I told him, my desperation making me sound incredibly genuine. 

My dad finally looked at me, sighing. “Okay. But you are right, that was really bad timing,” he said, giving me a weak smile. At least his sense of humor wasn’t completely decimated. There was still such a tiredness in his eyes that I didn’t really know what to think, but I’d take what I could get.

After that day, there was quite a while without incident. I’m not sure exactly how long, given I didn’t have the foresight to keep track, but it was long enough that the funeral became just a weird one-off. My dad was still grieving, though he didn’t hold any ill will towards me. I could thank the lord that he was more reasonable than his brother. Derwin would’ve flown off the handle had I pulled something similar at a funeral he was doing a speech for. God, maybe I miss Uncle Derwin more than I thought? I keep thinking about him even now. Maybe it’s because his funeral was the catalyst for all this. 

Whatever the case, nothing happened until a single session with a client upended my work life. I had been working as a therapist for the past two years, and was starting to get a decent list of clients. I won’t lie, it was a difficult job, with many pitfalls to look out for. I was only able to stave off burnout by building up a pretty morbid sense of humor, if that hasn’t been made clear enough by now. There’s only so much empathy and sympathy you can afford to give when constantly hearing stories of abuse, self harm, and suicidal ideation. It can weigh heavily. I was only able to stand it for as long as I did by keeping a good amount of emotional distance. Ironic, then, what would transpire next.

It was a pretty standard session. I won’t reveal too many details about the client, but I suppose it doesn’t matter much anymore. I guess I’ll give her the name “Abby” for the purposes of this retelling. She was on the younger side, and unfortunately had been through the relationship wringer. She had some PTSD from the abuse suffered at the hands of her former boyfriend. We were around three months in session-wise, so I had built up a decent rapport with her. I can’t ethically justify giving more details than that though.

Abby sat down on the plush white couch in my office as she told me of her most recent episode. I’ll spare you the minutiae, but when we came to the crux of the episode, that’s when it happened.

“When my dad raised his voice at me the other day, it was like I was back in the hotel all over again,” Abby said, starting to tear up. She shuddered a little bit, wrapping her arms around herself as though she was freezing

Even as a seasoned therapist, cases like this were never easy. To see an indelible mark left on a person from events beyond their control is harsh. Pessimism about the world becomes so much more prominent when all you see is the bad. What is therapy, if not compassion for those that the world has chosen to leave behind? Paid compassion, yes, but compassion nonetheless. Perhaps that is a cynical way of looking at it, though I did feel as if I provided genuine help to those who needed it. When it just wasn’t enough though… Well, I ought not speak on that. 

“I hate that even someone raising their voice at me is enough to do this!” Abby exclaimed, self hatred pouring forth in palpable waves. 

As I moved to respond, I felt a strange twitch. Something familiar. The muscles in my face twisting into a visage of glee. *Fuck! Not now*, I thought. I pinched my arm hard to try and keep whatever force was causing this at bay, but the pain seemed only to act as stimulus. The tugging at the sides of my lips became even stronger. I was not winning the battle, nor the war. Abby gave me a puzzled look, her tears now stopped in their tracks.

“I’m so sorry, can you give me a moment?!” I asked Abby, trying to keep my lips pursed as I spoke. 

It wasn’t enough, as a big smile broke through before I could exit the room. Her eyes widened at that, and I saw as the tears came back in full force. So much for beneficence and nonmalficence. The whole situation was fucked. I closed the door behind me with far more force than I’d intended, and I could hear Abby startle even with the separating wall. I had no more fight left in me, allowing the grin to have free reign over my face. Just like at the funeral, it felt euphoric. Again I was being rewarded. But by what?

After around five minutes, my face finally returned to neutral as though nothing had happened. I was overjoyed to have my own expressions back, but that was quickly stifled by panic. Shit, I had left a client in the room by herself! That was a big no-no, especially in the middle of a breakthrough session. That’s not even taking into account the impression I had left her with. Abby had told me some of her most dreadful feelings and I beamed at her like a kid receiving ice cream. How to unfuck this session was beyond me, but I had to at least try. 

I walked back into the room, trying not to let on how nervous I was. Distancing myself was usually easy. Not this time though, given the circumstances. Abby’s face was far more red than when I had left the room originally.

“So sorry about that, I’ve been getting these muscle spasms lately,” I said, opting to be as candid as possible. If I was to re-establish trust, that was the way to go. 

“Can we uh, reschedule for another time,” Abby responded, her voice as hollow as I’d ever heard it. “I don’t think I can do this right now.”

“Are you sure?” I asked, a vast pit opening in my stomach.

“Yes. Please.”

My heart broke a little at that moment. Whatever this spasm was, it had not only interfered with my familial life, but also my work life. Not to mention the potential damage it had wrought on the client. As much as I try to keep my emotions in check regarding my clients, I still care deeply about them. It might seem like a paradox, to both care and not care at the same time, but it exists nonetheless. Some things are unexplainable, I suppose. Abby opted to cease sessions with me after that incident. Prematurely ending treatment, and because of something I couldn’t control. It still stings. 

I took an extended vacation from work. I didn’t want to, given it left some of my more high risk clients vulnerable, but I couldn’t allow another incident like that. God forbid I smiled at someone who was telling me how suicidal they were feeling, that was a disaster waiting to happen. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if such a thing occurred. Therefore, I surmised, it was in everyone’s best interest to figure this all out. As long as this phenomena continued happening, my life was only going to get worse. I decided to visit my doctor and try not to sound like a maniac when describing it to him. 

A week later and my appointment with Dr. Kincaid came and went. It was not very helpful. He mentioned something about it being possibly psychosomatic, perhaps related to high stress situations. I guess I can understand why he came to that conclusion, given the circumstances surrounding the two incidents, but to me it didn’t make much sense. I wasn’t stressed at all during Derwin’s funeral. And my session with Abby was no more plausible, given that she was not even close to being my most stressful client. He wound up referring me to a psychiatrist, and recommended some over the counter anxiety medication. I was pretty incensed by that. I knew far more about mental health than he did, and what I suffered from wasn’t anything psychosomatic. I’ll admit in retrospect that I may have let my ego get in the way there.

It was after the visit to the doctor that the incidents picked up exponentially in frequency. The next one was while I was ordering a coffee at my local Starbucks. Not usually my first choice, but coffee is coffee. I’ll give you the short version of what occurred. 

“What kind of milk do you want with your coffee?”

“I’ll go with oat milk, please.”

“Anything else?” 

Unlike the other times where I’d had some level of warning with my muscles tensing up, this was near instant. I wasn’t able to respond because of how wide the smile was. I tried to turn around but it was as though my body was locked in place. The barista became visibly uncomfortable, shifting her feet. I was escorted out of the store after a minute of that, once my legs started to work again. The part of me that was embarrassed was far overshadowed by the terror I felt. Whatever it was, it was spreading across my body. It wasn’t just my face anymore. I rushed back to my apartment, nearly pulling a Derwin by speeding past a red light. I was lucky not to get t-boned. 

Things have only gotten worse since then. I’ve been holed up in my apartment for a while, too fearful to go out. Excuse the paranoia, but what would I do if my body locked up during a drive or something similar? I just can’t risk it, especially with the incidents becoming more frequent. It feels almost natural now when it happens. As though it's a normal function my body is meant to carry out. Moving on its own, paying no mind to the brain controlling it. What felt alien before now feels normal. I sometimes can’t tell when it’s me moving and when *it* is doing the moving. The sensations just blend together.

I find my mind wandering, foreign thoughts proliferating amongst my own. I know for the time being that these are not my own thoughts, but what will happen once it becomes as natural as the alien movements now feel? Will I be myself anymore? Will I even be able to tell?

I can’t even tell if it is me writing this all down, or if *it* is doing the writing. Looking back at previous pages, the personality expressed through the narration is not my own. I don’t have a morbid sense of humor. I don’t make jokes at times like this. Whenever my computer screen goes black, I am forced to look at my own reflection. To see a wide smile and hollow eyes staring back at me. It is a veritable hell. I’ve been experiencing an increasing urge to leave the apartment and go outside. I don’t think it is me that’s thinking this, though. I wonder what it will be like, to walk around and talk? All while the people are unaware as to what is really doing the walking and talking. 

They will see me and think: *If only I could be so happy.* They will not give a second thought to me. Or rather, to *it*. I can only pray that someone notices. Someone who knows me. Someone who can tell that I am not myself. Then again, I still don’t know if the me right now is myself. What then? In any case, there’s nothing I can do anymore. It wants me to post this. It knows no one will come to help.

Even my breathing is performed for me now. I can’t hold my breath. I can’t make it stop.
