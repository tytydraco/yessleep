We’ve never told anyone about this. I’m breaking the silence on what happened to us in Graywater.

——

*It’s been far too long. Where are you? You said we’d all be together again. Walking along the streets. Wading through Graywater. Lies creating wakes. I’m little to nothing now. Won’t last much longer. Soon I’ll go back to dust. Dust among the lilies. I’d like to share it with you, one last time. - Luke*

I couldn’t comprehend the letter Ryan had handed me. *Why was Luke in Graywater?* I thought. I could hardly remember that place. I mean, I knew we were all from there; it was there that our friendship first formed and strengthened through adolescent bonds to the same comic book heroes and silly cartoons. My head felt full of radio static. It was nearly impossible to gather my thoughts.

“When did you get this?” I asked him.

“Today, Jay. It came in the mail. I rushed over as soon as I saw it was from Luke.” Ryan replied. His green eyes were freshly bloodshot and bags lined the lower lids. I glanced back down at the envelope lying on the counter. It looked like an old tea stained pirate map. *My Only Brothers. How could it get to him without a return address?* I wondered.

“That’s it?”

“That’s it.”

“What the hell is he doing there? We haven’t been there in almost a decade.” I questioned. We left Graywater when we were 16. All three of us packed what little we had into Ryan’s 1998 Honda Civic and never looked back. There was nothing left for us there. Luke’s parents passed, Ryan’s were dicks and mine never cared. We wound up in Bend, Oregon and set roots, just the three of us. It wasn’t too far from Graywater, and it had enough infrastructure to provide us with jobs. Plenty of young lost souls to blend in with as well.

“Your guess is as good as mine, man.” The harder I tried to picture Graywater, the foggier it got. I couldn’t paint a clear picture of that place in my mind at all.

We hadn’t seen Luke in about three weeks. We’d thought he’d just been on another bender. But after the first week we started to imagine the worst. He was a recovering alcoholic, and recovery is always a bumpy ride. A roller coaster of achievements and relapses. I’d stuck by his side through it all. I took more than a week off work to be with him. What we went through together would be forever ingrained in my mind. The shakes. The sweat. The crying. The fevers. The vomit. Desperate cries for a single drop. “Just to take the edge off.” “Just one sip, please. I just need to clear my head up so I can get well.” He’d tell me he’d felt like he was dying, and I almost believed him a few times. But we made it through. Together. Or so I’d thought.

“We have to go get him.” I said, fear scittering through my voice.

“Jay, let me speak. For just a minute.” Ryan stated solemnly. “I already packed a bag, because I knew how you’d react to all of this.” *Yeah. Like we should be.* I thought to myself. “I’ll go, man. But you know how this ends and I told you a long time ago I was done with all of this. You have to promise me that this it. We go get him. We put him in rehab. Thats it. After that, I’m done.” I had to fight my frustration with him. Ryan and I had always been on the same wavelength, for a while at least. Ryan had put up with way too much. Especially when it came to Luke.

“I understand.”

Luke had become a glass canon. His reactions were always sporadic. You never knew if something you said to him would strike a nerve. He was usually always happy, but he had developed manic episodes that progressively got worse as we got older. He said the drinking helped. We knew better, but he would never let us in. We could never pin down why Luke had to drown himself in liquor.

I walked back to my room, and stared into the stain on the carpet. Vomit from the last time Luke and I had sweat it out in there. It had turned a dark visceral brown. It wouldn’t come out, no matter how many chemicals I threw at it. I grabbed some clothes from the closet, loosely stuffed them into my gym bag, and started to turn around. I couldn’t help but feel like something was in the corner of my eye. Scratching at the strangest itch in my brain. A shadow. Something familiar, but I just couldn’t make anything of it. I shook it off and shut the door behind me as I walked out.

I locked the door to my apartment and walked briskly down the stairs to the parking lot to meet Ryan. It was a chilly October morning, and there was a dense layer of overcast blocking out the sun’s warmth. The leaves had fully changed into waves of orange and yellow, slowly beginning to fall. A subtle breeze rustled and twisted them around along the cold, gray asphalt. As I stepped in, a glimpse of the three of us riding along under the cloak of night raced through my head. Luke would always take the passenger seat, and I’d sit in the back as Ryan glided through town. All three of us. Laughing and listening to music both way too loud. Or headed to D&D that week. Those thoughts kept me warm most days, but they stung with longing as the two of us began the long drive to Graywater.

“I don’t get it. Graywater is a six hour drive from here. How did he manage to make it all the way there on his own? He always rode to work with me. He hasn’t had a car since high school.” I was floating in and out of consciousness as Ryan spoke to me, but I heard every word.

“I don’t know. It doesn’t make much sense to me either. But what matters is that we know he’s there now. And we’ll be picking him up from whatever bar he ended up at before dawn.” I said to comfort myself as I twirled Luke’s keys around between my cold fingers.

Luke was incredibly predictable. He developed patterns, just like the rest of us. We could always tell when Luke was about to take a step too far and fall over the edge. This time was different, though. No warning. He was just gone. No clothes packed, no note left on our counter telling us how sorry he was for fucking us over again. Just a cold, empty space on my couch and a strange letter that came in the mail after the fact.

I looked over at the clock. It blinked 10:00. *We’re coming buddy.* I’d hoped my thoughts would transmit to him. I was sending him warm frequencies to let him know he wasn’t alone. I’d hoped he could feel me too. 

——

I hadn’t even realized I’d fallen asleep when I was startled awake. The car was parked at a gas station, and I’d assumed Ryan had gone in for a quick pee break. Gazing out the window, I realized that we were encompassed in a thick gray fog, and before I knew it, I was walking down the middle of the small highway. I didn’t know why, my legs were just moving on their own. Somewhere beyond the fog, I could make out what sounding like couching. Thick, phlegmatic, wheezing coughs. A strange ringing started to whine all around me. Something caught my eye again. Something lying in the middle of the asphalt, right between the yellow lines. A black red and gray striped fedora with one side of it caved in. A deep red spread into the grooves of the pavement from the bottom of the hat. I began to shake violently, acid rising in the back of my throat, and sweat penetrating the layers of clothing that clung to my rigid body. I felt piss seep into my Chucks as the ringing got worse. My eardrums were splitting and my vision started to blur as the hat suddenly disappeared into a geyser of thick fluid. The shock of it knocked me back onto my tailbone, sending splinters of pain up through my back. I tried to scream, but my airways were frozen completely still, like someone had a death grip on my lungs. What I had to assume was blood crashed over me, soaking every inch of my skin and clothes. The fog had turned a deep crimson, and the ringing took over my entire existence. I could feel my throat ripping apart as I tried so desperately to force any kind of noise out of the chords.

Jumping in my seat, the seatbelt locked as I realized I was drenched in sweat. My heart was pounding out of my chest and I couldn’t catch my breath. I frantically checked outside the window. The gas station, but no fog, just tall pine trees lurking all around, their branches waving softly to me in the breeze. I peered inside, and I could see Ryan at the checkout counter. Wiggling my toes, I realized I’d never relieved myself, and somehow that was more comforting to me than the lack of fog. *What was that? I never dream.*

Ryan opened the driver side door, and sat down. He held out a drink to me.

“He lives!” He cackled. “You conked out man. I got you something, it’s almost your turn to drive.” I gladly accepted it; those days I survived solely on caffeine. I looked at the clock. 12:30. “Dude you look like you’re gonna hurl. You alright?” No, I had never been more not alright but I couldn’t bring myself to tell him that.

“Yeah, yeah. Just anxious. I’m ready to get Luke the fuck out of Graywater.” I was only half lying. Wiping the sweat from my face, I cracked open the can and took a deep swig. “I’m good to switch out if you want to get some rest.”

As we wound between an endless sea of pine trees, I couldn’t help but feel shivers run down the length of my spine, leaving goosebumps across the entirety of my skin as I read the passing road sign.

*Gr ywa e 1|0
Portland 75*

I couldn’t help but tighten my grip on the steering wheel. *Why would you go home?* I thought. *Why wouldn’t you tell us? What the hell kind of bender are you on?* No matter how I tried to put the pieces together in my head, I could never find the answers to the questions swirling in my head.

The radio caught my ear, snapping me back to reality. I reached down, pinched the volume knob and turned it slightly up. 90’s punk rock spun around the car. I could feel Luke’s energy in there with us. I let him and the familiar music wind me down even more familiar dense forest roads and buried memories…

——

2 Years Ago. October 15th 12:53am.

Rock music was playing on Ryan’s radio. The windows were down, filling the car with fresh cold oxygen. We were leaving Judy’s, the local dive bar our friend group, along with the rest of the college aged population, frequented. We’d spent the night under the glow of a lone red light on the balcony, overlooking the streets of downtown. Ryan was driving, as he preferred to DD after his uncle died in a died in a drunk driving accident. I was in the middle seat in the back, trying to keep my recently sweaty hair out of my eyes.  I promised myself I’d keep it cut shorter after this. My right hand was firmly placed on the back of Luke’s neck. We were flying through town way too fast for comfort. But there was no time to think about speed limits. Luke had the worst alcohol poisoning I’d personally ever witnessed, and we were on our way to the emergency room.

If he wasn’t choking up his typical jager-dark beer potion, he was completely unconscious. He had already spilled his bladder, several times, and he was muttering strange phrases.

“You don’t…..don….d-don’t remem….ber….what h-he d….did to ussss.” Was the only one I could make out. *What are you even saying?*

“It’s okay buddy, we’re gonna get you some help, I promise.” Reassuring him was all could do. As we pulled into the emergency awning, after pulling the parking brake of course, Ryan sprang out of the car and darted through the automatic doors. I could hear him screaming desperately at the top of his lungs.

“WE NEED HELP! PLEASE, HE CAN’T EVEN WALK!”  Ryan must have put them under a spell, because not five seconds later two nurses were helping me finagle Luke out of the car. They placed him in a wheelchair, and began rolling him in, as if to skip triage entirely and get him back as fast as they could. As they crossed through the doors, Luke violently vomited all over the entryway floors. I grabbed Ryan by the shoulders, and spoke to him very sternly.

“Great fucking driving buddy. Go park the car, I’ll go back with him and I’ll grab you from the waiting room once he’s settled in.”

“Okay,” he sighed, “I’m not happy about this, but I’ll see you in a few.”

Luke was knocked out, his vitals had evened out, and he was on a full saline drip. The subtle beeping of the monitors droned on over the noises outside of the room. He had fought the nurses for a solid five minutes as they tried to stick him with the damn IV.

“No, please. I….I don’t want to sleep. I’ll be good, please.” He’d beg, jerking his arms away from them. He was completely delirious. Ryan was sleeping on one of those shitty blue couches they always have in those rooms, and I had pulled up a chair next to Luke’s bed. *Why, Luke? Why can’t you give this up? Why can’t you just let us help you out of this for good?* I laid my head on a spare pillow I had fixed on the side of bed, and sobbed. I desperately wanted my friend back.

——

Present day.

Ryan was fast asleep in the passenger seat as we passed the welcome sign to Graywater. I’d never seen the front of this sign before. It read: GRAYWATER, YOUR NEW FAVORITE HOMETOWN. I watched in the side mirror as we passed it, expecting to the typical “See you soon!” But instead, it read “You came.” Suddenly, I felt like someone had their hand the inside of my head. Fiddling around in the creases of gray matter. I pressed my foot down into the brake pedal as if I was a mobster curb stomping some unlucky rival. The car came to a screeching halt, and Ryan jolted awake as his seatbelt locked up.
“What the fuck Jay!? What happened!?” My breathing had gone sporadic, and my fingernails were fully embedded into the steering wheel. I looked back up into the rearview. As quickly as I saw it, it was gone. *How the fuck.*

“There was a dog…ran across the road. He’s already in the tree line. You okay?” A very lame fib to throw him off.

“Yeah. Goddamn.” He let out a big sigh, and settled back into his seat as I gave the car some gas. *What is going on with me? What am I so afraid of?*

Graywater was laid out like any other small town in the PNW, probably the country if I’m being honest. Lots of quaint neighborhoods surrounded your typical downtown square. And downtown was where we were headed. But this place was unfamiliar to me. Street names twisted and folded in my head. One-ways that led only to dead ends, roundabouts that spun webs of confusion. I got turned around more times than my pride could take, but we made it eventually. The architecture of the city center screamed Chicago meets Seattle. Lots of two story apartment buildings with beautiful bay windows squeezing each other from sidewalk to sidewalk. Little shops and restaurants lived on the first floor of many of these.

There was a single two-level parking garage on the west corner of the town center. I nestled the car into a spot on the second floor and as I pulled the keys out, I looked around and noticed the absolute lack of other cars. One…two…three.

“You seein’ this?” He gave me a perplexed look. “This place is dead.”

“Was this place ever really alive?” This answer caused me dig deep into my memories.

“Can I tell you something? Promise not to call me crazy?”

“Hit me.”

“I…I can’t remember anything. About this town I mean. This is our HOMETOWN. The foundation of everything we are. Why can’t I remember?” A deer caught in the headlights. That’s all I can say to describe the look on Ryan’s face. That and a mix of nausea, maybe. Then, he said something I’d never possibly be able to forget.

“I can’t either.” I was completely speechless, and we sat in silence for what seemed like eternity. “Let’s get Luke out of this fucking town.”

We exited the parking garage, and found a directory sitting right at the edge of the block we were on. It showed the full layout of downtown Graywater, showcasing all of the local shops and bars. Just two blocks south, there was a bar called Patty’s.

“Bingo! If anyone’s seen Luke it’s a bartender. Let’s get him and get the fuck out of here.” Ryan suggested with a heaviness in his voice.

“Anyone ever tell you you’re really smart?” Flattery was the only weapon I had to keep him here as long as possible.

“I could stand to hear it a few more times.” He snarked.

We passed a few people as we walked towards the bar, and this set my mind at ease a little. It still felt a little empty for downtown a few hours before dinner rush. I tried to push it out of my mind and take in the scenery. In the center of downtown, there was a tiny little park. Adorned with a splash pad and jungle gyms. The trees were popping with vibrant oranges and yellows. But as I zoomed in on the trees, they looked like they were starting to rot. And the jungle gyms had subtle hints of rust throughout their many connecting metal bars. There were three young boys playing on the swing sets, and they creaked and moaned with every push. But they were unbothered. Unaware of the condition of their surroundings, they laughed and played freely. The sidewalks had too many cracks to count, with little dead bolts of grass crawling out of them. But I had to force myself to zoom back out. Luke was here, somewhere. Alone. Waiting for us to find him. We had to find him.

Finally, we stumbled upon our destination. I looked up at the sign hanging above the doors. “Patty’s Bar & Pub. Your last stop for the night.” I grabbed the door and held it open for Ryan.

“Thanks, buddy.” As we stepped in, the floor creaked and the strong scent of fried everything mixed with stale beer filled my nostrils. There was one older man sitting at the bar. His beer was half empty and most likely flat. There was a small bowl of peanuts next to him, and his chair was surrounded by the husks. Two other men sat at a booth on the other side of the bar. Ryan looked over to me, “I’ll ask around in here if you wanna hit the bathrooms.” I nodded and patted his shoulder firmly. A bright red arrow shaped sign hung next the bar, reading *restrooms this way*, in a questionable font.

The hinges on the door squeaked as I pushed in the door. The state of this restroom was far beyond questionable. The walls were a rusted orange, with darker almost red streaks pointing down to the floor tiles. They were in far worse shape. Cracks seeped through every one of them. The bar was definitely of the dive variety, but this was still an extremely jarring jump in quality. I really didn’t want to be in here, in fact I didn’t want to be in this hellhole at all. But Luke needed me.

“Luke?” I called out. Silence. “You in here buddy? It’s Jay.” Still nothing. *Okay. I’m really doing this.* I thought to myself as I started to push in stall doors. Empty. The next, empty as well. As I placed my hand on the door of the third stall, I could make out faint breathing on the other side.

“…Luke?” I pressed inwards on the door. It wouldn’t budge. The breathing got a little louder, mixing with strange wet sloshes. Like volcanic liquid bubbling, low gargling began to radiate from the stall. I backed away, almost tripping over my feet. The lock started to jiggle unfathomably fast and small wisps of steam floated all around it. I was almost back to the entrance when the stall swung open, clashing with the on next two it with a loud BANG. What I saw next will haunt me for the rest of my life.

What I can only describe as a membrane, pulsated with a thickness to it, then split open with a horrible squelch, spilling dark red-brown fluids onto the floor. The putrid smell that spilled from that stall was enough to make me kill over. A large, clear sack fell into the mess on the floor. Something inside writhed on the floor, and something began to push its way out. A dark filthy foot popped out and it ripped open slowly, and what at first looked like a human stood up carefully, steam rising off its back. It turned around very, very slowly. It was completely nude and covered in barbed wire, tightly wound into its skin, trapping its arms to its sides. Its legs were crooked and its knees bent inwards, like a fawn attempting to stand for the first time. Blood was seeping out of every small wound from the metal it was wrapped in. Its lanky malnourished body was unsettlingly disproportionate. Its genitals and chest were removed with what seemed like poor surgical skill, leaving only lazy seams of stitches behind. Puffy, red, and swollen stitches. If it had eyes, they were covered by flaps of bloody skin sewn over them. But it was looking right into the depths of my soul.

Every muscle in my body seized, and I spilled my guts all over the floor in front me, spattering bile onto my shoes. I looked back up at the creature as my eyes watered. *What. The. Actual. Fuck. Is that.* Its jaw dropped wide open, revealing rotted holes with scattered uneven teeth. It started to move its maw up and down rapidly. It was whispering,

“Pleasepleasepleasepleasepleaseplease-”

It wouldn’t stop, like the worst scratched record I’d ever heard. I felt the blood drain from my head, and the room started to spin. I thought my legs were going to give out, but adrenaline started to rush through me. As I regained my senses, I realized that it was walking towards me, still pleading with me. Every movement it made was accompanied by frenzied jerking motions and it had to fight to keep its balance. I began frantically reaching back for door handle. I found it, and began to yank it backwards. It wouldn’t budge. I beat my fists against it desperately. My diaphragm went berserk. I began screaming, “RYAN! HEhuhHeughRYAN FUCKING HELP HEHEUGH ME!” The whispering grew louder, and I could hear its feet plop onto the tiles as it walked. “PLEASE HEUGH-RYAN!”

The door burst open, knocking me back into the creature. It was shockingly cold, and I could the barbed wire jutting into my skin and ripping my clothes. We spilled down into the mess of afterbirth. I looked up and saw Ryan towering over me. He froze.

“Fuck me. Holy FUCK!” He reached out for me, and I locked my hand into his. He pulled me back up to my feet. I turned back to the creature. It slowly sat up and fixed its non-existent gaze on us. “Jay, what the fuck is that?”

Something in my head snapped. My ears started ring violently. Rage shot through my veins. *Fuck this thing.* Before it had a chance to get to its feet, if it even could, I ran across the bathroom, and planted a solid kick into the creatures face with my right leg. Its head slammed into the floor with a wet and hollow thud. I stood over it for a moment, almost feeling sorry for it. But that feeling faded quickly. I lifted my foot over its face, and I stomped with every once of strength my leg could muster. Its skull cracked between my shoe and the tiles.

“ssPleasssessspleasessspleaseplease-” It continued to mutter, blood pouring out of its face. I stomped again. I felt its jaw snap out of place. It could now only force a gargling sloshy mess out of its mouth. Again. Glimpses of its body twitching filled my peripherals. Again. The blood started to drench my sock, thickening the fabric. Again. Finally, its face completely caved in, spraying jet black blood and bone viscerally onto the wall behind it. As I lifted my soggy chuck out of its head, It writhed and squirmed on the ground as I backed away. It let out one final raspy bubbly breath, and stopped moving entirely.

When I turned around, Ryan had a blank expression on his face. My right sneaker, pant leg, and little sections of my flannel had a fresh layer of the creatures tar-like blood spattered into them. He turned, bent over quickly and dry heaved a few times.

“Jesus…” The words left his throat in a weak and tired tremble as a string of saliva stretched all the way down to the ground. “Jay. I don’t…I don’t understand. There was no one in the bar after you walked away. It’s like they dematerialized or whatever.” He looked up at me. “W-where did they go? Where the fuck did they go, Jay!? I feel like I’m fucking losing it. And then this? What the FUCK is that thing?” I guess he caught a glimpse of the stall it came out of, because he fell to his knees and finally fully purged his stomach. I was still trying to reconcile what happened in here. So many things were racing through my head. Pounding against my skull like fish in a tank that’s too small.

“Ryan?”

“Yeah?” He said, wiping his lips.

“We really gotta find Luke.” I didn’t want to speak about what just happened and I know he didn’t either. It was just too much to cope with. 

Ryan wasn’t losing it. The bar was baron. Not a soul wandered between its walls. The lights remained glowing, and drinks had spilled over onto the tabletops. *How?* I started to run towards the door frantically.

“Jay, wha-“ I froze before I made it there. I stared blankly out the windows. Subtle ringing filled my eardrums as I gazed out into the completely city center. What were inklings of life before was entirely desolate. “Jay?” His voice was muted in my senses. I pushed open the door and the stepped out, Ryan sticking right behind me. Silence. Silence like I’d never experienced. The cold breeze was still steadily swaying through the air. The door to the bar slammed, and echoed out across the barrenness before us. “Well, now what?” He asked. I let out a slow sigh and started walked slowly down the street. “Jay?”

“You coming?” I proposed. He didn’t answer, and stared wildly at me. “I saw a sign for a hospital coming into town. If he’s not at the bar, my guess is that he was already taken there after he did what he always does.”

“Jay, stop. I told you this was in and out. Snatch and grab. Not a trip down memory lane that I can’t even remember.” He told me.

“I’m not leaving him here. You can go, Ryan. No one is stopping you. But you saw what I saw back there, and you’re seeing what I’m seeing.” It was hard to contain my lack of patience. I let out a long sigh. “I got this…if you need to go.” He looked like he was losing his patience with me too. He swallowed his feelings, and looked me in my eyes.

“Luke made his bed…but I can’t leave you here too.” We shared an understanding look.

We started walking back to the directory by the parking garage, cutting across the park to save time. The soft dead grass crunched lightly beneath my shoes. We passed completely  abandoned cars slightly parked on the sidewalk. Open balcony doors of second floor apartments with curtains blowing in the breeze. The trees drooped and their leaves had started to fall ever so softly the ground.

As we walked up to the rectangular prism coated in maps, one side of it caught my eye. I stepped around, and felt my head flush. Written in blood, there was a red arrow lining the entire route all the way to the hospital. It was circled and red lettering wrapped around it that said *“You couldn’t. What makes you think they can?” Who’s taunting me? What is this?* I wondered. I could feel Ryan’s gaze on me. As if he was questioning my thoughts without being able to hearing them. I was determined to get all THREE of us out of here. Together.

According to the map, the hospital was around 2 miles southeast of us. That’s all I needed to know. I looked around at the surrounded buildings to get my directional bearings. I pointed southeast-ish.

“Let’s go then.” I said. Ryan sighed at me.

“Okay.”

——

I need to catch my breath and collect myself. There’s so much I need to scavenge through in my head to make this comprehendible.
