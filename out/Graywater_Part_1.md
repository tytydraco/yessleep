I’m still piecing together what happened to me in October of 2013. I was 21 years old, and It’s all a foggy mess. Here’s what I’ve got so far.


——

Knocking pulled me up through layers of sleep like hands dragging me from deep water. My eyes opened to my bedroom ceiling. A texture I’d memorized but never meant to. I rubbed my eyes, and glanced over at my alarm clock. *7:36AM*. The digits hovered, slightly out of focus. I sat up slowly and rubbed the sleep out of the corners of my eyes. Blinking them open, my room faded into focus.

*knockknockknockknock!*

*What the hell.* The thought formed slowly, moving through the fog in my head. I pulled myself from the sheets, damp with sweat, and tugged a hoodie over my frame. The fabric smelled like yesterday and the day before.

*Knockknockknockknock!*

“C’mon, man, gimme a second.” The words came out softer than I meant them to. I made my way through my bedroom door. The apartment was tinted soft blue with early light that hadn’t committed to morning yet. Everything looked temporary. Uncertain. The couch stopped me. A blanket lay there, half-draped across the cushions. A pillow still held the indent of a head that wasn’t there anymore. The sight of it opened something in my chest—not pain, exactly. Just space where something used to be. I stood there longer than I should have, staring at the empty shape of someone who used to sleep there.

I disengaged the latch and turned the deadbolt. 

“It’s seven fucking thirty in the mor-“ Confusion washed over me as I saw my friend standing outside the entryway.

“Ryan?”

His chest was heaving with fear. His eyes were too wide, and he held something out for me.

A letter.

—— 

*It’s been far too long. Where are you? You said we’d all be together again. Walking along the banks. Wading through Graywater. Small footsteps creating wakes. I’m little to nothing now. I’ll be gone soon. Dust among the lilies. I’d like to share it with you one last time. - Luke*

I couldn’t comprehend what my friend had handed me. Why was Luke there? A place that existed somewhere in the back of my mind. I knew we were all from there. Knew it the way I knew facts from a history text book— distant, belonging to someone else’s life. Comic books. Cartoons. Summer days that stretched forever. The fragments were there but wouldn’t connect. Wouldn't form a picture. My head felt like it was full of bees. The buzzing drowned out any thought I could’ve formed. Every time I tried to grab hold of a memory, it dissolved like smoke between my fingers.


“When did you get this?” The question came out hollow.

“Today, Jay. I was about to go on a run and it was just sitting on my doorstep. I came over as soon as I saw it.” Ryan's hand moved through his hair. Brown curls damp with panic. His green eyes looked like he'd been crying or hadn’t slept or both. Red-veined and raw. Bags underneath them like bruises. I glanced back down at the envelope lying on the counter. It looked like an old tea stained pirate map. Yellow and aged. Almost archeological. *My Found Family*

“That’s it?”

“That’s it.”

“What the hell is he doing? We haven’t been there in almost a decade. And how the fuck did this just land on your doorstep? What the hell kind of sick game is he playing?” The questions came out fast but didn’t feel real leaving my mouth.

We left our hometown when we were 16. All three of us packed what little we had into Ryan’s 90s shitbox. We drove away and the rearview showed us nothing worth going back for. Bend took us in. The city was big enough to disappear into, small enough to survive in. Odd jobs that didn’t ask too many questions. An apartment that fit three young people who needed to stay close. Other lost souls drifting through, making us truly invisible by comparison.

“Your guess is as good as mine, man.” His voice sounded far away. “Probably on a bender.” The eye roll looked tired and practiced. “Again.”

Three weeks. Luke had been gone three weeks this time.

Recovery isn't linear. We’d watched it loop and spiral and crash into itself. Luke's poison: alcohol. Clear and simple and it was destroying him one bottle at a time.

Usually the disappearances lasted days. Three, maybe four. Then he'd show up—drunk, confused, apologetic in a way that meant he'd do it again. The first week we worried about the normal amount. The second week the worry changed shape, grew teeth.

We'd been there for all of it. Held his hair back while he vomited up everything inside him. Stayed awake through the night sweats, the shaking, the begging. Luke would plead for just one drink. Just a sip. Just enough to make his hands stop trembling, to make his head stop splitting open. *I'm dying,* he'd say, and his eyes would mean it. Sometimes I’d wonder if he was right.

But we made it through. Together. Or so I’d thought.

We sat in silence for a brief moment.

“I have to go get him.” I said, trying to hide the fear flowing through my voice. The words tasted like a mistake. Like a door I shouldn’t open.

“I know.” Ryan's face was stone. “I already packed a bag….But Jay,"  

“Ryan, I can do this part on my own. You really don’t have to get involved.” The look Ryan gave me could have stopped a clock. 

“Let me finish…This is the last fucking time I do this. We go get him, and then I’m done. I mean it.” Each word dropped like a stone into still water.

“Thank you, Ryan.”

Ryan and I had always been on the same wavelength. Especially when it came to Luke. Luke himself was a different story, though. His reactions were always sporadic. You’d never know what would set him off. Which word, which look, which silence would be the one that broke something. He was usually happy. Manic happy. Bright-burning happy that hurt to look at directly. The episodes got worse as we got older, expanding like cracks in glass. He said the drinking helped. Luke said a lot of things.

“I’ll meet you downstairs.” Ryan said as he opened the front door, spilling cold October air into the apartment.

I walked back to my bedroom and the stain in the carpet caught my eye. It was always there. Waiting. A dark visceral brown that looked almost black in certain light. I’d tried everything—chemicals that burned my nose, scrubbing until my hands cramped, prayers to a god I didn’t believe in. Nothing touched it. The stain remained. A permanent scar on the floor marking a moment in time I’d failed to stop Luke from bleeding all over it. Failed to protect my friend from the knife of himself. 

I grabbed some clothes from the closet, loosely stuffed them into my gym bag without looking and started to turn around. I couldn’t help but feel like something was in the corner of my eye. Something scratched at my brain. Something familiar, but I just couldn’t make anything of it. A shape I should have recognized. A shadow that knew my name. I shook it off and shut the door as I walked out. I grabbed my keys, as well as Luke’s set he’d left behind like always.

I locked the door to my apartment and walked briskly down the stairs to the parking lot to meet Ryan. Outside,  October had begun to strip the warmth from everything. Overcast hung low enough to touch, pressing down on the world like a hand on a bruise. The trees had turned into waves of orange and yellow that looked too bright against the colorless sky. Leaves drifted down in slow spirals, settling on asphalt the color of storm clouds. 

As I stepped into the old beat up car, a glimpse of the three of us riding along under the cloak of night raced through my head. All three of us. Laughing and listening to music— both way too loud. Those thoughts kept me warm most days, but they stung in my chest as we began the long drive home.

“I don’t get it. It’s a six hour drive from here. How did he manage to make it all the way there on his own? He hasn’t had a car since that beater he had in high school broke down.” Ryan's voice drifted in and out like a radio station losing signal. I floated somewhere between listening and not. Between here and somewhere else.

“I don’t know. It doesn’t make much sense to me either. But what matters is that we know he’s there now. And we’ll be picking him up from whatever bar he crash landed at before dawn.” I said to comfort myself as I twirled Luke’s keys around between my cold fingers.

Luke was predictable. Had patterns we could read like weathermen. We could always tell when Luke was about to take it a step too far and fall over the edge. This time was different, though. No warning. No clothes packed, no note left on our counter telling us how sorry he was for fucking us over again. Just a cold, empty space on my couch.

I looked over at the clock. It blinked *8:36*. *We’re coming buddy.* I thought it hard, like maybe thoughts could travel through air and fog and distance. Like maybe Luke could feel it wherever he is. Warm frequencies saying you're not alone, we're coming, hold on.

Ryan stepped on the gas, pulling out of the parking lot like we’d just robbed a bank. The leaves swirled in our wake like they were waving goodbye.

The road ahead stretched dark gray and endless.

The apartment building grew smaller in the rearview mirror. I didn't look back. Neither of us did.


——

I hadn’t even realized I’d fallen asleep when I was startled awake. The car was parked at a gas station, and I’d assumed Ryan had gone in for a quick pee break. Fog was kissing the windows of the car. Thick, gray and alive. I didn’t remember opening the car door. Stepping outside. But my legs were carrying me forward down the center of the highway. Yellow lines disappeared into the fog. The world seemed to have no edge. 

Somewhere in the gray— coughing. Thick, phlegmatic coughs that sounded like drowning from the inside. Wheezing that rattled like chains.

A strange ringing started to whine all around me. Something caught my eye again. Something lying in the middle of the asphalt, right between the yellow lines. A black, red and gray baseball cap with one side of it caved in. A deep red spread into the grooves of the pavement from beneath it. I began to shake violently, acid rising in the back of my throat, and sweat penetrating the layers of clothing that clung to my rigid body. I felt piss seep into my chucks as the ringing got worse. Hot then suddenly cold. My eardrums were splitting and my vision started to blur as the hat suddenly disappeared into a geyser of thick fluid. 

The shock of it knocked me back onto my tailbone, sending splinters of pain up through my back. I tried to scream, but my airways were frozen completely still, like someone had a death grip on my lungs. It crashed over me, soaking every inch of my skin and clothes. The fog had turned a deep crimson, and the ringing took over my entire existence. I could feel my throat ripping apart as I tried so desperately to force any kind of noise out of the chords.

——

The seatbelt locked as I jumped and realized I was drenched in sweat. My heart was pounding out of my chest and I couldn’t catch my breath. I frantically checked outside the window. The gas station, but no fog, just tall pine trees lurking all around, their branches waving softly to me in the breeze. I peered inside, and I could see Ryan at the checkout counter. He flashed a peace sign at me when he saw me awake. *What was that? I never dream.*

Ryan opened the driver side door, and sat down. He held out a drink to me. The red can sent shivers up my spine.

“He lives!” He cackled. “You conked out man. I got you something, it’s almost your turn to drive.” I reluncantly accepted it; those days I survived solely on caffeine, nicotine and shitty Chinese food. I looked at the clock. *10:30.* “Dude you look like you’re gonna hurl. You alright?” No, I had never been more not alright but I couldn’t bring myself to tell him that.

“Yeah, yeah. Just anxious. I’m ready to get Luke the fuck out of that town” Only half lying. Wiping the sweat from my face, I cracked open the can and took a deep swig, forcing it down a throat that still felt raw. “I’m good to switch out if you want to get some rest.”

As we wound between an endless sea of pine trees, goosebumps spread across the entirety of my skin as I read the passing road sign.

*Gr ywa e 180*

My knuckles turned white as I over gripped the steering. *Why would you go home?* I thought. *Why wouldn’t you tell us? What the hell kind of bender are you on?* No matter how I tried to put the pieces together in my head, I could never find the answers to the questions swirling in my head.

The radio caught my ear, snapping me back to reality. I reached down, pinched the volume knob and turned it slightly up. 90s punk rock spun around the car. Distorted guitars and drums that sounded like beating hearts. I could feel Luke’s energy in there with us. Could almost hear him laughing in the back. I let those warm thoughts and the familiar music wind me down dense forest roads and buried memories…

——

2 Years Earlier. October 15th, 12:53am.

The same song plays on Ryan's radio.
Windows down. Fall air rushes in—crisp and sharp and alive. We were leaving Judy's, the dive bar where we’d spent countless nights under the glow of that lone red light on the balcony, watching the streets of downtown move below us like a river.
Ryan drove, I sat in the bitch seat, always—one hand fought to keep my sweaty hair out of my eyes. The other hand was locked on the back of Luke's neck. Holding him upright. Holding him together.
We were flying through town way too fast for comfort, but speed limits didn’t matter that night. Luke had the worst alcohol poisoning I’d personally ever witnessed.

If he wasn’t choking up his typical jager-dark beer potion, he was completely unconscious. He had already pissed himself. The car reeked of it. And he was muttering strange phrases to himself. Words that slipped and slid, never quite forming complete thoughts.

“You don’t…..don….d-don’t remem….ber….what h-he d….did.” Was the only one I could make out. What are you even saying?

“It’s okay buddy, we’re gonna get you some help, I promise.” Reassurance was all I had left to give. As we pulled under the red glow of the emergency awning, Ryan sprang out of the car and darted through automatic doors that opened too slowly. The light gave everything the color of warning. I could hear him screaming desperately at the top of his lungs.

“WE NEED HELP! ALCOHOL POISONING!”  Ryan must have put them under a spell, because not five seconds later two nurses were helping me finagle Luke’s awkwardly tall body out of the car. One of the nurses gasped when she saw the state he was in. They placed him in a wheelchair, and began rolling him in, as if to skip triage entirely and get him back as fast as they could. 

As they crossed through the doors, Luke violently vomited all over the entryway floors. Refusing to stop and gawk at the sight, I grabbed Ryan by the shoulders. His eyes were confused and unfocused

“Go park the car, I’ll go back with him and I’ll grab you from the waiting room once he’s settled in.” I said, sternly.

“Okay, okay.” He was sweaty and somewhat dazed. I chased the nurses down through sterile hallways that all looked the same and followed them into the room Luke was going to be staying in.

——

“This might have been the worse case of alcohol poisoning I’ve ever seen.” The resident medical student said, pushing his glasses up on his nose. He glanced over at him as he mumbled through his drunken state. “He’s incredibly lucky to have friends like you. He probably would have ended up dying of liver failure if not for you two.” He grabbed his laptop and slowly walked out of the room.

Luke was out cold by the time Ryan made it back. His vitals had evened out, and he was on a full saline drip. The subtle beeping of the monitors droned on over the noises outside of the room. He had fought the nurses for a solid five minutes as they tried to stick him with the damn IV. I never knew he was scared of needles.

“No, please. I….I don’t want to sleep. I’ll be good, please.” Begging. Child-like. His arms yanked away from the nurses' hands like they were trying to hurt him instead of save him. Completely delirious. Lost somewhere inside himself where nothing makes sense. I stood in the corner of the room, staring in disbelief at the state of fight or flight he was in. His child-like pleading shook me to my core. This night had taken such a role on me that I still hear the low beeps of the vitals monitor in my sleep, slowly humming through my head.

Ryan was sleeping on one of those shitty blue couches they always have in those rooms. The kind that squeaked when you moved and left patterns pressed into your skin. I had pulled up a chair next to Luke’s bed. *Why, Luke? Why can’t you give this up? Why can’t you just let us help you out of this for good?* I laid my head on a spare pillow I had fixed on the side of the bed. The fabric smelled like disinfectant and other people’s pain. and sobbed. Quiet. Crying that came from somewhere deeper than sadness. I desperately wanted my friend back.

I stayed awake, watching, wondering when the friend I used to have slipped away and who this stranger was that had taken his place.

____

Present day.

Ryan was fast asleep in the passenger seat as we passed the welcome sign to town. I’d never seen the front of this sign before. Some of the letters were faded.

*GR YWATER.*

*WE’RE SO GLAD TO SEE YOU BACK!*

Something about it felt off. It was too enthusiastic. Towns don't welcome you back. They just exist, indifferent to your arrival or departure.

I watched in the side mirror as we passed it, expecting to the typical “See you soon!” But instead, it read *You finally came home* Suddenly, I felt like someone had their hand the inside of my head, fiddling around in the creases of gray matter. I pressed my foot down into the brake pedal like I was a mobster curb stomping on some unlucky rival. The car came to a screeching halt, and Ryan jolted awake as his seatbelt locked up.

“Fuck! What happened!?” My breathing had gone sporadic, and my fingernails were fully embedded into the steering wheel. White crescents pressed into leather. I looked back up into the rearview. As quickly as I saw it, it was gone. Replaced with:

*See ya later, friend!*

*How the fuck.*

“There was a dog…ran across the road. He’s already in the tree line. You okay?” A transparent lie  to throw him off.

“Yeah. Goddamn.” He let out a big sigh, and settled back into his seat as I gave the car some gas. What is going on with me? What am I so afraid of? 

We wound through the outskirts of town, my mind growing foggier as we passed small roads leading back into the woods. The dense abundance of trees guarding homes that couched beneath pine canopies. As we pulled closer to the road that would lead us into the heart of the city, we pulled up to multiple road signs blocking our way in reading, 

*ROAD CLOSED FOR CONSTRUCTION*

Bright orange barriers guarding the road. No construction equipment or workers. Just sitting there like sentries.

Ryan glanced over at me. “So do we go around?” We’d have to backtrack. Hours through winding backroads that twist and double back on themselves. Hours more before we’d find Luke. I looked around and noticed a small park nestled in the trees just off the road.

“It’s only half a mile to downtown. We’ll park the car there and walk.” Confusion spread across Ryan’s face.

“And what if Luke is as bad as he was last time? You’re gonna have to carry him out of there.” The memory flashed—Luke's body deadweight in the backseat, vomit and piss and muttered nonsense. The red glow of the emergency room. The beeping that never stopped.

“So I’ll carry him then.” I was determined to get Luke out of this place, TODAY, and we were losing enough time as it was.

“Fuck, man. Whatever you say.” I knew this trip was already a burden on him. But this was important. I couldn’t fail my friend again. We were already losing precious minutes.

I swerved the car sharply into the parking lot of the small rest-stop like park. Gravel crunched under the tires. The park sat empty around us. Picnic tables weathered gray, trash cans overflowing, a rusted swing set creaking in the wind.

Through the trees ahead, somewhere in that half-mile of fog, Luke was waiting. I opened the car door. The air that rushed in was cold and damp and tasted like metal. Like copper. 
Ryan climbed out slowly. Reluctantly. Looking at the trees like they might have tried to move when he wasn’t watching.
"Half a mile," I said again. Trying to convince myself as much as Ryan.

—-

The small town was laid out like any other. Lots of quaint neighborhoods surrounded your typical downtown square. But this place was unfamiliar to me. Street names twisted and folded in my head. One-ways that led only to dead ends, roundabouts that spun webs of confusion. I got turned around more times than my pride could take. 

The architecture screamed wannabe tourist destination—a town of maybe thirty thousand trying to wear the clothes of somewhere important. Two-story apartment buildings with bay windows that might have once been beautiful squeezed together from sidewalk to sidewalk. Little shops and restaurants occupied their first floors like organs in a body that was slowly shutting down.

“You seein’ this?” He gave me a perplexed look. “This place is dead.”

“Was this place ever really alive?” His answer caused me dig deep into my memories.

“Can I tell you something? Promise not to call me crazy?”

“Hit me.”

“I…I can’t remember anything. About this town I mean. This is our HOMETOWN. Why can’t I remember?” Ryan was a deer caught in the headlights. That and a mix of nausea glimpsed through his features.

“I can’t either.” I was completely speechless. Silence stretched on for what seemed like eternity. “Let’s get Luke out of this fucking town.”

We strolled crooked sidewalks that seemed to shift when we weren’t looking. I spotted a directory at the edge of the block—one of those tourist maps showing the layout of downtown. A record shop. A bookstore or two. And two blocks south, a bar called Patty's..

“If anyone’s seen Luke it’s a bartender.” Ryan suggested.

“Agreed.”

——

We passed a few people as we walked towards the bar, and this set my mind at ease a little. They seemed tired, and not completely present. Empty eyes in expressionless faces drifted past us without acknowledgment. It still felt a little empty for downtown a few hours before the dinner rush, though. I tried to push it out of my mind and take in the scenery. 

In the center of downtown, there was a tiny little park. Adorned with a splash pad and jungle gyms. The tiny trees were popping with vibrant oranges and yellows. But as I zoomed in on the trees, they looked like they were starting to rot. And the jungle gyms had subtle hints of rust throughout their many connecting metal bars. Three young boys played on swing sets that creaked and moaned with every push. The sound was awful. Pained. But the boys didn’t notice. They laugh and play freely, unaware of the decay that surrounded them. The sidewalks had too many cracks to count, with little dead bolts of grass crawling out of them. 

Finally, we stumbled upon our destination. I looked up at the sign hanging above the doors. “Patty’s Bar & Pub. Your last stop for the night.” I grabbed the door and held it open for Ryan.

Inside, the  smell hit immediately—fried everything mixed with stale beer, the scent of a place that had been dying slowly for years. One older man sat at the bar, beer half-empty and probably flat. A bowl of peanuts beside him. Shells scattered around his chair like evidence.Two other men occupy a booth on the far side. Silent.
"I'll ask around in here if you wanna hit the bathrooms."
I nodded. A bright red arrow-shaped sign hangs next to the bar: *RESTROOMS THIS WAY* in a font that looked like it was trying too hard to be fun.


The hinges on the door squeaked as I pushed in the door. The state of this restroom was far beyond questionable. The walls were rusted orange. Darker streaks—almost red—pointed down toward the floor tiles like arrows showing the way to hell. The floor tiles are worse. Cracks seeped through every single one, spreading like veins under sick skin. The bar was definitely of the dive variety, but this was still an extremely jarring jump in quality. I really didn’t want to be in there, in fact I didn’t want to be in this hellhole at all. But Luke needed me.

“Luke?” I called out. Silence. “You in here buddy? It’s Jay.” Still nothing. Okay. I’m really doing this. I thought to myself as I started to push in stall doors. Empty. The next, empty as well. As I placed my hand on the door of the third stall, I could make out faint breathing on the other side.

“…Luke?” I pressed inwards on the door. It wouldn’t budge. The breathing got a little louder, mixing with strange wet sloshes. Like volcanic liquid bubbling, low gargling began to radiate from the stall. I backed away, almost tripping over my feet. The lock started to jiggle unfathomably fast and small wisps of steam floated all around it.

I tried my best to make it back to the door, but the stall burst open before I could. Smoke filled the room so quickly I didn’t have time to react, and as I breathed it in I began to choke harshly. I fell to my knees, lightheaded and completely dazed. Just before I could pass out, the air felt fresh again, and my lungs began to clear out the smog.

I looked up, and I thought I could make out a little boy, but my vision was still blurred.

“Are you okay, mister?” He asked me. He couldn’t have been more than 5 years old. I could start to make out shaggy dark brown hair and blue eyes. He was wearing a superhero shirt and baggy sweatpants. I cleared my throat.

“Why are you all alone? Where are your parents, bud?” I asked him. He looked down shamefully.

“Gone.” I could hear him holding back tears. 

“Gone? Gone where? This is a bar you shouldn’t even be allowed in here.” No answer, but he began to sob. This boy felt strangely familiar to me, but I couldn’t seem to place where I’d seen him before. He looked back up at me, but now his eyes were red, with deep yellow irises.

“LEAAAAVE!” He screamed, his voice twisted and dark, skipping around in octave. 

Suddenly, the stall door slammed back open, swatting me like a fly and sending me across the restroom. I made contact with the door, the force opened it, and I landed against the wall outside of the restroom. Pain shot up my back as I tried to gather myself. I heard Ryan running over.

“Ryan?” I asked through the pain.

“What the fuck happened? Are you alright?” He wrapped an arm under mine and helped me up to my feet. Before I could even think about answering him, I shoved open the door to the restroom and took a few steps in. Ryan held the door open behind me.

It was completely empty. I looked over at Ryan, but couldn’t form any words to describe what I’d seen.

I walked out of the restroom with Ryan pacing after me. The semi empty bar was now baron. Not a soul wandered between its walls. The lights remained glowing, and drinks had spilled over onto the tabletops. How? I started to run towards the door frantically.

“What the fuck?” Ryan said, “I was just talking to the bartender. Jay, wha-“ I froze before I made it thereI and stared blankly out the windows. Subtle ringing filled my eardrums as I gazed out into the completely city center. What were inklings of life before was entirely desolate. “Jay?” His voice was muted in my senses. 

I pushed open the door and stepped out, Ryan sticking right behind me. Silence. Silence like I’d never experienced. The cold breeze was still steadily swaying through the air. The door to the bar slammed, and echoed out across the baroness before us. “Well, now what?” He asked. I let out a slow sigh and started walking slowly down the street. “Jay! Fucking talk to me!” I took a deep breath, and slowly released the air in my lungs.

“How many other bars are in town?”

——

We checked all five local bars. Every trace of life had completely left the town. As we walked through the town square, I looked over at Ryan.

“Okay. The hospital is about a mile from here. If he’s not at the bar, my guess is that he was already taken there after he did what he always does.” I said.

“Jay, this place, for whatever reason, is a complete ghost town. I-I really think we need to leave.” I didn’t skip a beat in replying.

“I’m going. You’re welcome to go back to the car and wait. I completely understand if this is too much for you.”

We started walking back to the directory, cutting across the park to save time. The soft dead grass crunched lightly beneath my shoes. We passed completely abandoned cars slightly parked on the sidewalk. Open balcony doors of second floor apartments with curtains blowing in the breeze. The trees drooped and their leaves had started to fall ever so softly to the ground.

As we walked up to the rectangular prism coated in maps, one side of it caught my eye. I stepped around, and felt my head flush. Written in red, there was a red arrow lining the entire route all the way to the hospital. It was circled and red lettering wrapped around it that said *You couldn’t. What makes you think they can?*

*What is this?* I could feel Ryan’s gaze on me. As if he was questioning my thoughts without hearing them. I was determined to get all THREE of us out of here. Together.

“Let’s go then.”
