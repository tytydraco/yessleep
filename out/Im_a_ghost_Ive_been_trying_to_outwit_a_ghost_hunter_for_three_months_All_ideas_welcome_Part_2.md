First, I want to thank everyone for their advice. You are all ingenious freaks of nature, and I will always be grateful for your help even after I’ve disappeared. I also personally want to thank the user who suggested I steal the keys to the basement with Dennis’ ghost-hunting equipment and hide them somewhere only I could find. The look on his face after he’d dug through waist deep manure for three hours was priceless **(Dennis’ Note: I knew that idea wasn’t smart enough to be your own)**. 

Anyways, a lot has happened since I wrote, so I’ll spare you the less interesting attempts **(Dennis’ Note: Failures)** and get on with it.

After reading through the comments, I decided to try to find my classmates again to see if they had more details about what happened the night we were attacked and to enlist their help in cementing my disorganized ideas into a plan. I’d never bothered to memorize my friend’s addresses since I’d saved them on my phone, but I knew Gabbie still lived two streets down from the house my family had lived in before my brother was born. I decided to head there first, armed with the speaker and visibility spray that Dennis had used on me. 

The neighborhood had grown since I’d last been there, but the streets that I remembered remained unchanged. The woman who’d screamed at my parents after I hadn’t said hello to her one time was out walking her scruffy dog, still ensuring her path didn’t cross our old house despite us being gone for five years. One of the stray cats who prowled the neighborhood was lounging in the sun on my former neighbor’s driveway, and I sat with him for a while before realizing that I was stalling. With one last pet, I went to Gabbie’s house.

Right away I knew something was wrong.

Heaps of garbage were piled on the curb outside of the house, large bags that looked like they were about to burst alongside furniture that appeared to still be in perfect condition. Inside the house felt sterile: every inch of the space had been meticulously cleaned and depersonalized except for the vibrant colors freshly painted onto every visible surface. Upon further inspection I wasn’t surprised to find the door had a giant padlock on it emblazoned with the word ‘Realtor.’ Abandoning the search of the house, I began scouring through the trash for anything that would help me figure out if Gabbie was still alive or where she and her family had gone. Two of the bags were full of clothes, but the third one I searched through held a macabre garden of flowers: wilted blooms of every color were packed into the bag, alongside soiled notecards and more intact, fancier looking cardstock. My heart dropped as I realized all of them were offering their sympathies to the Ross family for the loss of their daughter. 

Grief overwhelmed me as I read the heartfelt accounts of my friend’s impact on their lives. Gabbie and I had been closer when we were younger and the only friends you had were the ones within walking distance, but reading them felt like I was joining the brunette on every adventure she’d had since then. It also reminded me that the community would have reacted the same way to my death, though I didn’t think I deserved it as much as Gabbie did. I had nearly finished reading through the notes when I found one from Travis’ family.

Skimming over the contents, I was relieved to see the distinctive left-handed slant and cramped letter spacing of Travis’ own handwriting. His sentiments were the same as the others, but most importantly it had his address still intact in the corner of the envelope. Memorizing the address I sped towards it, eager to see my friend safe.

When I arrived I buried the speaker in a pile of dirty clothes in Travis’ closet and waited. Once I was certain my friend was alone, I began taunting him in increasingly garbled volumes. 

“Travis-”  


“Your closet smells like your ex-girlfriend’s perfume. That was six months ago man, wash your shit more.”  


“I’m seriously gonna haunt you until the end of time unless you come and talk to me.”

Travis nearly tore the door off its hinges in his haste, his face looking pale. Guiltily I changed tactics. Spritzing myself with the visibility spray, I grinned at my friend.

“It’s good to see you alive.”

I swear the hug he gave me was the warmest I’ve ever felt.

“What the fuck is going on, Chase?” Travis asked afterwards, clearly stunned. “I- I saw your body. And Gabbie’s, and Derrick’s, and just about everyone else in our damn class,” his voice had shaken as he went on, but it eased into amusement as he took in my form. “You look like a neon strip-club sign.”

I filled my friend in on my current situation, and though he looked like he still hadn’t slept in the three months since I’d seen him, his eyes glinted at the chance for revenge.

“What do you need me to do?”

“Well the old man lives about two hours from here,” I explained. “We can work on a plan to force him to help this weekend. It’ll have to be something more imaginative than the time you dumped glitter all over your sister’s boyfriend.” I smirked.

Travis laughed and threw an old sock at me. “Screw you. I was nine, and he ended up cheating on her. I bet he left a trail of glitter behind him for months.”

I snorted and put my hands up in surrender. “Anyway, in the meantime we should try to find out more about the dogs that killed Gabbie and I. Once we beat the bastard, we’ll have to make sure they’re all together for the police to go firing squad.”

Travis looked confused. “Gabbie wasn’t killed by the dogs.”

I frowned. “What else could have killed her? The corn?”

“No, man. I saw her body. She was stabbed, like, fifty times. Whoever killed her, they were definitely human.”

I didn’t argue with him again despite my confusion. “If she was killed by a person, do you think she ran into them after she got out of the field?” I asked.

But my voice didn’t come through on the speaker.

I reached for the cheap toy, but unsurprisingly my hand phased through. Travis called my name a few times, then stopped abruptly and jumped to his feet. He picked up the listening device and shoved it into his coat pocket as he put it on, muttering about never getting time to relax, then went outside. I easily followed my friend by phasing through the walls of his room, beating him to his new truck, which had been a present for recently passing his driving test. But as he took off I passed right through the windshield, and was left to watch uneasily as Travis drove off alone. I scrambled to get there first, hoping I was right about where he was going. 

I was.

Two hours later I watched the searing headlights of Travis’ truck flash as he rolled to a stop in the cornfields where our bus had broken down three months ago.

“It has to be around here…” I heard Travis mutter as he jumped from his cab. The sun was slowly sinking towards dusk, the deep orange glow transforming my friend into a living shadow as he marched intently to the edge of the field. Surprisingly, the corn hadn’t been harvested in the last three months, so the field Travis entered was still a densely packed wall of green. Knowing my friend wouldn’t have come back here without good reason, I decided to start scouting the other field to help expedite the search.

It didn’t take long for me to find multiple places where the endless rows had been trampled in the escape from the dogs. The cornstalks remained eerily rigid as I passed through them in the still air, following one of the flattened paths until I ended up in a small clearing. At one edge a crusty, blackened stain caught my eye, and I swallowed back anxiety before stopping to investigate.

Whoever had been here had clearly been taken away by police, as tape still loosely in the shape of a body was visible beneath a small layer of leaves and dirt. I kneeled down beside the tracing, hoping to find something useful. I scanned the surrounding area as quickly as I could in the growing darkness, and after a few times meticulously glancing back and forth I noticed a pristinely painted nail sticking out of the dirt nearby. Sudden memory struck me as I recognized the bright pink color as the nail polish Gabbie had been wearing. 

I trembled with horror as I approached the finger to confirm what I already knew. My sadness turned to mounting frustration as I realized I wouldn’t be able to take the dismembered appendage out of the ground. I was about to head back to Travis when a small flash caught my eye. I turned and saw Gabbie’s phone buried not far from her finger. Understanding dawned on me. Travis likely knew that her phone was missing, and must have thought it would help our investigation. I jumped urgently to my feet, determined to find a way to get my friend’s attention.

It wasn’t until then that I realized Travis was screaming. 

Startled from the sudden noise I cursed, then followed the sound as fast as I could across the road and through the opposite field. I exhaled a sigh of relief when I saw that Travis was alive and unhurt. He had stopped to crouch beside something, his eyes staring numbly downwards. Once I recognized what it was, I understood why.

It was the dead body of our friend Alex. 

I stood over Travis as he mourned, wishing I could join him in grieving for our classmate. I wondered guiltily if Alex and Derrick would still be alive if I hadn’t told them to get on the bus, then shut the thought down. I wasn’t sure how the police had missed Alex, but I was relieved that he could at least be returned to his family now. As I waited beside Travis, I looked more closely at our friend’s corpse. Alex had been stabbed countless times, but the wounds didn’t look like clean knife wounds or bullet holes. The cuts were long and jagged, mainly gouged along his face and chest, with the worst cut being across his throat. It also didn’t seem like he had died here, as there was no pool of blood like there was where Gabbie had been killed.

Confused and deflated after finding our friend dead, I waited with Travis as the sun faded farther and farther below the horizon. Eventually however he stood up and began to trudge back towards his truck, bringing his phone to his ear. I decided to let him go off alone, since I couldn't talk with him anyway. I wanted to stay with Alex until someone came for him.

But Travis only made it a few steps before Alex’s body started to move.

The corpse’s legs jerked once before a shiver began traveling up its body. As it did it gradually began to stand up, writhing unnaturally until it was fully upright, then staggered towards Travis. 

“Watch out!” I screamed impulsively to Travis, the phrase cut off with an irritated growl as I remembered the uselessness of speaking. Determined to try to protect my friend I pushed myself towards Alex’s body, passing through for a moment before I was forced to a halt with a rush of sensations so strong I screamed in agony.

But the person who screamed was Alex.

I opened my eyes, dumbfounded by what had just happened. I looked down and recognized the gashes on my hands. I had been staring at nothing else for hours. 

I was inside Alex’s body. 

Without thinking I locked eyes with Travis, who was watching with a mix of confusion and fear. “Get out of here! If Alex wasn’t found, there are probably others. I’ll get the phone. Run!” Travis hesitated for only a moment before nodding once and sprinting back towards his truck. 

As I watched him leave I heard growls from behind me. Moments later five hellhounds slunk into view, but they took no notice of me inside Alex’s rotting body. Instead the dog in the lead barked once, and the pack hurtled after Travis. I took off after them, grabbing one of the beasts by their tail. It turned and snapped at my hand, not quite reaching flesh. I released its tail then tackled it to the ground. The creature was larger than Alex, so I couldn’t hold it for long, but the commotion caused the pack to abandon their hunt for my friend and turn back. I released the dog just before the others arrived then collapsed to the ground, pretending to be dead. Thankfully the rest of the pack still ignored Alex’s corpse, and before they regrouped I heard Travis’ engine start. 

I sighed with relief as the noise grew louder, then more distant. Travis was safe. I lurched to my feet, the pain of Alex’s wounds starting to overwhelm me now that the shock of having my senses back had passed. I followed the dogs to the far edge of the cornfield, going as slow as I dared while still remaining hidden as I got a closer look.

A group of a dozen people had joined the hellhounds, standing in a line at the very edge of the field. Some of them were my classmates, but others had clearly been here longer. Their bodies were disfigured and rotting: one of them had been shot through the cheek, revealing gleaming white teeth set in a permanent sneer. Another held its own rib as a weapon, and a third had its leg twisted the wrong way. But once Travis was gone they disappeared into the cornfields again, and I made sure to not cross paths with them as I returned to where Gabbie had died.

I waited beside Gabbie’s phone for four days, making sure no one else tried to go into the fields. When I was finally shoved out of Alex’s body and able to grab the phone, I immediately made my way to Dennis’ house. Travis still had the speaker, so I explained all of the new information we’d gathered to Dennis through a second,  prototype ghost-listening device he’d been working on using a baby monitor **(Dennis’ note: Lucky I didn’t put you back in the toaster for giving away the old one)**. Once I’d finished he looked at the phone and frowned. “I just hope the damn thing is worth it. Your friend’s more harebrained than a warren.”

I couldn’t argue with him. It had been pretty stupid of Travis to go back there alone, but I had enough trust in him to withhold my verdict until we could look at the phone. “Do you have a charger?”  
“Do I have a charger,” the old man snorted. “You think a sheriff’s deputy can be on call without a smartphone?” 

I chuckled for the first time in days. “No. Just thought you would have made one yourself from a  tin can.”

Dennis coughed as he laughed. “Damn ingrate. I’ll get it on the charger. You best get back to trying to stop my equipment.” 

So that’s what I plan on doing.

I’ll keep you updated on what we find on the phone. But until then I’m going to keep planning out ways to outwit Dennis. I should have better luck now with Travis’ help. If you have any ideas or think you know what’s causing all of this, let me know.

**(Dennis’ Note: I reckon it’s time someone spoke with the owner of this farm. Seems like they should know a thing or two about the trouble goin’ on right under their noses. No need to bother the boy about it neither. He’ll be busy enough, so I’ll giv’em a call and see what they have to say for themselves.)**
