I didn’t go to work. I couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw its face—those hollow eyes, that grin carved from nightmares. I spent the day pacing the apartment, trying to convince myself that I wasn’t losing my mind. The shadow wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. But my body knew better; it was on edge, every muscle tensed, waiting for something to happen.

I called Mike around noon. I didn’t want to drag him into this, but I needed to talk to someone who was there that night.

“Hey, Jake,” he answered, his voice groggy. “What’s up? You sound rough.”

I hesitated, not sure how to phrase it. “Did… anything weird happen to you after the party?”

There was a pause, long enough for my stomach to twist.

“Weird how?” he asked cautiously.

“I don’t know. Like… voices? Shadows? Something that doesn’t feel—” I stopped short, afraid of how insane I sounded. “Forget it. Never mind.”

“No, wait,” he said quickly. “I… I’ve been feeling off too. Like, I’ll catch something moving in my peripherals, but when I look, there’s nothing there. And last night, my bedroom door opened on its own. I thought it was the wind, but my windows were closed. I didn’t want to freak myself out, so I let it go.”

A chill ran down my spine. “Mike, this isn’t just paranoia. Something followed us home from that party. It’s real.”

He didn’t laugh, didn’t brush me off, and that scared me more than anything. “What do we do?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

“I don’t know. But I think it started in that basement.”

Mike cursed under his breath. “That stupid séance. I told Stacy it was a bad idea, but she said it was all for fun. A bunch of drunk idiots messing around with things they didn’t understand…”

I felt a surge of anger. “She invited this thing in. And now it’s in our lives. I think we need to go back to the house. Figure out what she did and how to stop it.”

Mike hesitated, but eventually agreed. “Alright. Tonight. Meet me at my place at eight.”

The day dragged on, each hour stretching into eternity. Every creak of the floorboards and groan of the pipes felt magnified, my nerves strung tight. By the time the clock hit seven, I was a wreck.

When I arrived at Mike’s, he looked just as bad as I felt. Dark circles under his eyes, his hands trembling as he locked the door behind me.

“I’ve been doing some research,” he said, holding up his laptop. “A lot of this stuff is tied to intent. If Stacy summoned something—”

“She did summon something,” I interrupted. “And it’s not leaving us alone.”

Mike swallowed hard. “Then we need to send it back.”

The plan was simple: we’d return to the basement, recreate the séance, and try to undo whatever Stacy had done. The thought of going back to that house made my skin crawl, but it was the only lead we had.

When we pulled up to Stacy’s house, the windows were dark. Mike knocked on the door, but no one answered.

“Stacy?” he called, his voice echoing in the still night.

We let ourselves in, the house eerily silent. The air felt heavy, oppressive, like the walls themselves were watching us.

“Basement’s this way,” Mike said, his voice trembling.

The moment we stepped into the basement, that same icy chill enveloped me. The air was thick with a metallic tang, like blood and iron. The candles from the séance were still there, melted stubs scattered around the floor. In the center of the room was the mirror Stacy had used—a tall, antique monstrosity with an ornate gold frame. Its surface seemed darker than it should have been, like it was swallowing the faint light from our flashlights.

Mike set up the candles, his hands shaking so badly that he almost dropped them. “What now?” he asked, looking to me for guidance.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “But if this is where it started, maybe it’s where it ends.”

We lit the candles and sat in a circle, the flickering flames casting dancing shadows on the walls. Mike pulled out a piece of paper he’d printed—a banishment ritual he’d found online.

As he started to chant, the temperature dropped even further, our breath misting in the air. The shadows around us seemed to come alive, twisting and writhing like they were trying to escape.

The mirror darkened further, and then the voice came, low and guttural, echoing through the room.

“You shouldn’t have come back.”

The shadows surged toward us, and the candles flickered violently. Mike shouted the final words of the chant, his voice cracking with fear.

The mirror shattered, the sound deafening, and the shadows recoiled, letting out a terrible screech.

And then, silence.

The air felt lighter, the oppressive weight gone. Mike and I stared at each other, panting, the broken shards of the mirror glinting in the candlelight.

“Did… did it work?” he asked, his voice hoarse.

I wanted to believe it. I really did. But as we left the basement, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had followed us.

And when I got home, my reflection in the bathroom mirror didn’t smile back.
