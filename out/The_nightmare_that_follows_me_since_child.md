Hi. 

My name is Mael , i am 16 and soonly 17 in march , i am from belgium so please excuse my english that isnt probably the best. The story i am gonna tell you is true , and ive lived it myself. 

I lived in 4 different houses from now on , i dont remember anything from the first one ( from my birth to +- 1 year old ) , but i do remember the second one ( from 1 year old to 6 year old ). 

This house was in PÃ¢turage ( Belgium ) , the house was near a school ( my garden litteraly leads to the school's entrance lmao ) , to describe the house i would say that it wasnt a huge house but it wasnt little too.

 i had my room and my brother ( he is 3 years younger than me ) slept in my parent's room , the toillets were on the first floor just like our rooms. 

The house had humidity isolation problems due to its age and my room was the worse part of the whole house for the humidity , so during summer i had millions of mosquitos and it was really annoying.  

So , in this house , i had a few nightmares but nothing serious , most were just me getting kidnapped on the road as my parents were buying fuel at the gaz station or me being on the road alone , whit people menacing me.

 Idk why but my nightmares occured mostly on the road or whit cars. I also got a dream wich i though was real for years where my mother were driving nearby my nona's house and suddendly we got shoot by her neighbors,  then i just drifted to sleep.

 Sorry for telling my life or just annoying facts but i dont really know how to do a good reddit since its my first time but i really wanna share what ive lived ( this isnt the interesting part but i wanna give you backgrounds or idk so you can help me to know what it is or idk )

After that comes the third house were i lived most of my current life ( 6 years old to 15 years old ). THIS is the house that got me crying and had me on fear for years. Idk how to say it in english but it was a "3 wall house" 

(the house was on the edge of a line of house , so people could enter my garden ). This house was bigger than the last one , i had my room , my brother had his room and my parents had their room. 

We had a cave where my father would do wathever he had to do ( i hardly ever went down there as my parents would smoke in the cave , and i cant stand the smell of a cigarette at all ).

 The stairs to go to the first floor goes all straight for 13 steps ( ive counted them ) then there is a huge square ( i would say 1.5m per side) then it turns to the right for 2 steps before finishing.

 Directly at the left was the room of my brother , but he didnt like to sleep alone since he was still a kid so he slept in my room wich was 100 times bigger.

 Directly INFRONT of the stairs is my room , and when you open the door the first thing you can see is my bed at the end of the room , directly facing the door. 

On the bottom left corner was my brother's bed. When you go to the right aftet the stairs is the bathroom  and just before to the left is my parents room

When i was 7 , i went to sleep , and had a terrible nightmare. Writting about it makes my eyes all wet due to fear lmao.
The nightmare occurs like that : 

-i get in a spectator stade where i cant move and can see just infront of "me"

-all i can see is a weird rectangle shaped room whit ( extremly important ): box in the middle of the room that i would say were 1m tall , some were upon each others but you could walk beside it as the room was quit large.

-A strange man figure ( i dont even know if it is human , but it looks human , but my mind tells my that it may be not human ) at the total right. Standing on its feet and look to the total left ,  gazing through the box. Looking at some kind of a

-kid , or a human, wich i think is me ( i cant say why , but i am 1000 % sure that it is a kind of "me?" ) and i am sitting and snobbing , trying to keep quiet from this man.

The man start talking calmy to "me?" , but i cant understand a single thing he is saying , i dont think its even a language that we speak , it was just random letters wich makes random words and thats it.

 but he had this way of talking that got me in a pure state of FEAR , so he would speak calmy and the next second he would scream on "me?" , and the "me?" Would start shaking and breathing loudly , then the man would stay quiet for a few second before talking again.

The nightmare ends by him taking 2 steps to "me?" , i then wake up in the same position as  the "me?" In my dream , in tears and in pure state of fear , and when i look up from my bed , the man is here. Just infront of my bed. Staring at me completly silent.

 The door behind him is wide open ( usualy closed , as i was scared by my father that passed infront of my room during the night when i was younger ).

 i yelled so hard that my parents wake up and run at my room , as i get out of my bed shaking and crying , running straight to the stairs. 

My parents caught me and helped me to stay calm , ive described them the dream and the man , they had no clue what it was , just probably a random nightmare they would say.

Two hours later i go back to sleep , DOOR CLOSED AND VERIFIED CLOSED , and guess what ? The same fucking nightmare occures , the same man , the same vision , me not being able to move at all and just the scene playing again , the exact same thing , but i was awake inside of my nightmare and was like: 

"oh my god , if i am having this nightmare again , there is a chance that he is in my room while i am sleeping" , so the nightmare ends just like the other , and when i wake up ( in the same position ) , he is closer to me.

 Closer than before , i would say 2m away from me now , and looking at me whitout moving or saying a word , the door WIDE OPEN. I scream once again and rush to the stairs as my parents grabbed me once again. I couldnt sleep for two whole weeks , and when i started to sleep again it was in my parent's bedroom whit their company. 

You would say "if it is only that" nuh uh , i had this nightmare multiple time in my life and it still occures thoses days , but rarely ( the last time i saw him was in april ) , and each time i had this fucking nightmare its the same shit , me waking up and the man being closer and closer and closer everytime.

 I also was a strong sleepwalker ( thank god i am not anymore ) , i was able to do almost everything during my sleep ( i once played league of legend my father told me and recorded it ) , but i had strange things during my sleep walking stade , i never knew if i had a sleep walking episode until my family would told me.

There was this night were my father would go to sleep late ( 4 am due to insomnia ) and didnt see me in my bed as usual , so he searched me but couldnt find me , my blanket was also missing , he started to stress. I was missing.

 He was in fear and searched for everything possible ( window opened , cave , door opened , garden , infront of the house , under the beds) and everywhere.

Then when he came back in my room , he heard snobbing , he found me. I was behind my bed , between the bed and the wall ( there wasnt even 40 cm , so ofc he wouldnt think of me being there) and i was there , whit my blanket , hiding , and when he found me , he took my hand and get me in my bed , he asked me ( knowing that i was sleep walking because i never act like that ) 

"what were you doing behind your bed ?" And ive answered "he is comming , and he is near" instantly aftet that i closed my eyes and sleeped. He told me what happend the next morning and i was in fear as the only thing that could be "comming and near" that can make me in this state of fear ( hidding and snobbing ) was the man in my nightmares. 

This year when i was 16 ( in april ) , i had my first trip whit the school , wich occured at Malta ( it is beautiful you should visit this country tbh ) , and everything went perfectly well , exept one night. 

we were playing D&D whit friends and suddendly my head went blank ( 2 am when it happend ) , and the voices of my friends began to sounds familiar but not in a good way , it would sound like the man's voice , and their word werent making sense to me.

 I was in pure fear whitout any reason infront of my friends , and suddendly one of them talked but loudly , and it got me to the part where the man yells at me. At this moment i had a panic attack and exploded in tears , and my friends didnt understand what was happening.

after 30 minutes of me in the bathroom washing my face in cold water , i came back and explained them everything , one of my friend couldnt sleep that night and the others were terrified too. 

This nightmare is following me since child. But it seems to have left since april whit my friends. 

It have no clue of what it is. But i feel like this entity only want me dead and nothing less.


Thank you really much for taking the time to reading this and please excuse my poor english.

This story is true , i wouldnt lie on it and spend my time spreading useless things

If someone has an idea of what it could be , feel free to answer please.
