I think I know what it is about [Mimes](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lero4c/never_leave_a_makebelieve_door_open/) that people don’t like. There’s the obvious stuff—like their annoying commitment to something nobody cares about and the clown comparison—but I think it goes deeper than that.

You have to guess what it is they’re trying to say or what they want. They don’t outright tell you. I’m not saying people that don’t talk are animals. But mimes specifically force you to play a game with them.

Personally, I don’t like them. I don’t have time for games. Fact is, if I’m talking to you and you’re choosing not to talk to me, we have a problem.

I heard a rumor that a drunk guy disrupted a vigil at a park, screaming about a mime. I found him, had a talk with him yesterday.

Said his niece was taken by a mime. He didn’t have proof, but the girl had been missing for four years. Presumed dead, but never found a body.

Crazy story, If he isn’t full of it. Could this be the same mime?

Our talk was civil. He doesn’t seem to be suffering from any sort of disorder—not obviously anyway. His story matches what I know to be true.

I think this could really be it. He and the niece were playing when he unlocked a make-believe door and never closed it.

You play mime games, you get mime prizes.

Like I’m one to talk.

My experience started when I was just a boy. It was my birthday party—9 or 10. Mostly family, but since I was getting older, I was allowed two friends to stay the night. 

Thomas and Bryan were active children—the kind you let outside and don’t expect back until the dinner bell. I was the oldest child in my family. All my cousins were toddlers. We were given permission to play outside while a lame clown entertained the younger kids.

Looking back, my mom was probably upset that she’d hired a clown for my party and I wasn’t even going to watch.

Thomas, Bryan, and I went outside looking for mischief, and living in the rural area we did, we found none. So we made some the way most kids our age do—we played pirates. The best thing about being a kid is the imagination. Ours was in full swing, and we turned a little forest paradise into the raging sea, and our trusty ship (a large log) our only means of survival.

During a particularly bad storm, I, the captain of the vessel (it was my birthday after all), ordered the crew below deck to ride out the worst of it. Bryan hopped down and pretended to walk down some stairs.

“Ooof. Bet that hurt,” Thomas said to me.

“What?” Bryan asked.

“You smashed through that door!”

“NO I didn’t!”

“You didn’t even open it.”

“It was open!”

“Pirates don’t leave doors on their ship open—it’s against the rules.”

“They’re PIRATES! They don’t do rules!”

Finally I’d had enough.

“Stop! I’m the Captain. I will make a ruling here. Bryan, uno reverse back here and I’ll go below deck first.”

The power of imagination—reversing time, erasing the conflict. (Remember when life had do-overs like that?)

I balance-walked to the end of the log and pretended to turn a doorknob. But my hand... it actually gripped something.

It startled me. I jolted my hand away, confusing the other boys.

“What’s wrong?” Bryan asked me.

“There’s something there. I touched it.”

“Like what?” Thomas said, backing away a step.

“I don’t know. It didn’t hurt—just scared me.”

I reached out again and found it. It felt like a doorknob. Round and metal. I could feel it wanting to fulfill its only reason for existing. I turned it—but it was locked. With my other hand I felt the space where the door would be. I could feel it—the texture, the grain of the wood. It was like there was an invisible door in front of me. I showed Bryan and Thomas, who were just as confused as I was.

“How could that be there? I just jumped off that side and it wasn’t there before,” Bryan said, jiggling the invisible doorknob.

“We should get your mom,” Thomas said.

“Okay, listen,” Bryan said. “You’re right, we should get a grown-up. But before we do, there’s still plenty we could do to discover stuff for ourselves!”

“Like what?” I asked.

“Bust through?”

“Feels too sturdy.”

“It’s a door, right? We could knock!”

“What if something answers?”

“We could try an invisible key?”

That got us thinking.

“Are we on the inside or outside?” I asked.

“What do you mean?”

“Well, doors get you from one room to another—or even outside.”

“Yeah?”

“So does that door lead outside to something—or is it keeping something in?”

“What if we use an invisible axe?” Bryan suggested.

“Like an invisible fireman?” Thomas teased.

“Yeah. Exactly.”

“See one anywhere?”

Bryan looked around.

“Dummy.”

Bryan pushed Thomas off the log. He landed on his feet and we all just stood there looking at each other. The push was an innocent act of a child returning a tease—but mid-fall, we all realized that we were afraid.

The door turned out to be real.

Was the water under the ship going to be real? The storm?

Everything was normal.

We gave a chuckle of relief.

Knock knock.

We froze. We didn’t even dare breathe.

Knock knock.

“Guys, was that one of you?”

“Not me.”

“Me either.”

Knock knock.

“What do we do? Do we ask who it is?”

“It’s not even our door. We should go!”

BANG. BANG.

“Okay! Back to my house!!”

BANG. BANG. BANG.

We ran.

Outside the house, my mom and a few other relatives were smoking cigarettes and talking with the clown (who was on a break, I guess). We told them about the door. It took an arm and a leg to get them out there. And when we did—the door wasn’t there. Or it couldn’t be felt.

My mom was not pleased that we dragged her and a half-dozen adults through the woods to an old log just to show them a game we were playing.

“Ahh, it’s no big deal. It’s the big guy’s birthday, after all,” the clown said.

“Well consider this little adventure my last present then. Now how about getting back to the ones I wrapped?”

“Yeah, sounds great, Mom,” I lied.

I loved presents, but I was rattled. So were my friends. We knew it wasn’t a game. We knew the door was there.

I didn’t know why they couldn’t feel it.

I know now: it’s because they didn’t believe.

Belief is what holds the world together, I think. If Bryan would have physically looked for that axe, I bet he would have found it. Things are because you believe they are. As soon as that link is severed, it takes something special to get it back.

That’s why he only goes after kids. They aren’t all dried out of belief. They have so much, they play with it. That’s what he wants.

I think he eats it.

On our way back, the clown kept going on about how a family went missing near here about ten years ago.

“Come on, don’t tell them that,” my mother said to the clown. “We live here—it’s basically our backyard. It’s safe.”

Then she looked at us, smiling. Reassuring.

That night, as we lay in bed, none of us could sleep.

“Do you think it was the family that was knocking?”

“You think they’ve been in there for ten years? How could they survive?”

“What if it was them—asking for help?”

“If it was… we’re the only ones who can do anything.”

“They need us.”

We left through my bedroom window. The shadows danced to our headlamps and flashlights as we approached the log.

I found the door right away.

“Say something.” Thomas said.

“Yeah, knock.” Bryan added.

I knocked.

“Is anyone there?”

Nothing.

Again, harder:

“Does anyone need help?”

I leaned in.

BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG.

I fell. Thomas took my place.

“Are you trapped? Can you speak?”

BANG. BANG. BANG.

“We’re going to help you, okay? Knock twice for yes and three times for no. Understand?”

Knock knock.

Thomas looked at me like he got a math problem right.

“Can you speak?”

Knock knock knock.

“Have you been in there a long time?”

Knock knock.

“Just hold on, okay.”

Thomas hopped down, joining Bryan and I on the ground.

“Okay, now what?”

“Now, gentlemen… the key,” Bryan said, pulling invisible air from his jacket.

“There’s nothing there.” Thomas muttered.

“That’s why you’re not in charge of the key.” Bryan said, inserting it into the knob.

A scraping noise. Stone. A door groaning open.

And then—he popped into being like a bubble.

A mime.

Black and white stripes. Red beret. White face. Grinning wide. Waving hard.

“Were you the one trapped in there?”

Clap clap.

“Are you part of the lost family?”

He paused, then made a gesture like swapping places.

“They’re part of you?”

He nodded, beaming.

“Like… you took their place?”

He clapped once—then crossed his arms dramatically, struck a frozen pose, and slowly pointed to his chest.

We didn’t fully understand. We still don’t. But something about it felt final.

“We should get you back to my house. You probably want a doctor.”

He frowned.

Clap clap clap.

He shook his head no, disappointed. Then, if all this wasn’t crazy enough, he walked off the log using invisible steps—like they’d been there the whole time. The log separated us from him like a line in the sand.

Then he got an idea. You could see it in his face. He pointed at us, then at himself, then at the spot below the log hidden from our view.

“You want us to follow you?”

Clap clap.

“There’s nothing there.”

He waved us off and descended again—then came back up, as if to say *see, told you so.*

“Whoa, neat trick,” Bryan said.

Clap clap clap.

“Not a trick… it’s real?”

The mime smiled.

Bryan jumped to the other side, joining him. He stared downward in awe.

“Guys, he’s telling the truth!”

The mime looked pleased. It made my insides twist. Something felt wrong—maybe from the start. We should’ve just watched the dumb clown.

“…Bryan, remember your dad is picking you up in the morning?” I stammered. “We can’t be late for that. Don’t want him to get upset.”

“What’s wrong with you guys? You’re acting weird. This is awesome, come on!”

“W-we need to get back. All of us,” Thomas said.

The mime bent down, mimed picking something up with two hands, and began swinging it like a lasso. He flung it toward Thomas and tugged hard.

Thomas hit the ground with a thud.

Bryan laughed—until he realized it wasn’t a joke. He rushed the mime, trying to stop him. The mime kicked him backward—right into the invisible stairwell.

I heard Bryan’s body hit every step on the way down.

I grabbed Thomas’s arms and pulled with everything I had.

“Don’t let him take me! Please!” he screamed.

But I couldn’t hold him. The mime pulled again—and Thomas slipped through my grip.

The mime looked at me.

I couldn’t breathe.

But I ran.

Ran all the way back to the house. Straight to my mom’s room. She called the police.

They didn’t believe me when I told them what happened. Said we were playing at night. Said an animal must’ve gotten them.

For a long time, I told myself they were right.

That my memories were just tricks.

But I never believed it.

And now, sometimes, I see him. Between cars. In storefront reflections. Just flashes of him—smiling.

Beckoning.

Inviting me back. Back down the steps. Back to join them.

Did we let him out?

Was he baiting us the whole time?

I don’t know.

But the man from the vigil and I have more to talk about.
