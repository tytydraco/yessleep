Tommy had been asked to conduct an interview with someone who had lived with one of the disappeared strangers. He had also been allowed to see the reports associated with the other two, and had been allowed to share them with Cullen.

It was a very important Formality, not to look into the secrets of strangers who were doing no harm. There were no consequences in Society, except that some of them seemed to just know when you did it, and they’d become agitated. Even if they lashed out, something would stop them from doing any harm outside human capability. Even if they didn’t hide their true faces, even if they proudly displayed something monstrous because it was how they were comfortable, their claws wouldn’t cut any deeper. If they did, something would stop them. It might be mundane, it might not be. But they’d be stopped.

As long as they were meant to be there. Cullen was not meant to be Outside, not if he didn’t follow the rules, and there were no formalities or manners saying he should be able to look at the logs. It was not his job. Unless the secrets belonged to someone unfit, on either side of the wall. Someone nobody wanted, or who had broken a rule. Look at the wrong secrets, without good cause, push deep enough, and someone would notice and remember for later.

He did not discover his insides turning outside, or find himself in some dark, long corridor, so Cullen was either meant to see this, nobody cared he was seeing it, or the contents didn’t matter. He liked the first two options better. It was useful, too, to work with someone you can both call a friend and who knows where the lines get drawn.

Cullen had paid a lot of attention lately to the security chatter. Over the comms, over cafeteria talk. He’d always listened, but never quite paid attention. Now that it mattered, he did. And he noticed things. He noticed that there were a lot of tools everyone had, to do a lot of different things, and it varied almost by the person whether they could talk about them or not. The less normal something was, the less likely they could say directly, and it was pretty pointed when the normal things were the cards they kept closest to their chests.

He’d made a few connections. Both with people and ideas. Some things, some individuals, he’d already known on a surface level, which were now clicking with him. You almost never went to other sections without permission. Who could give it to you varied, but you almost never did it. Science types disappeared or retired the most, and were the most cliquish. Most importantly, there were actual classifications for things, not just the nicknames he’d heard in proper Society, but if you mentioned them directly enough, bad things happened.

Cullen was pretty sure the names mentioned were throwaways, and anyone who wasn’t human had a euphemism or stand-in that clearly reflected a position in a filing cabinet somewhere. If he squinted, really hard, he’d see these awful blurry spots that hurt to look at, which he was pretty sure, somehow, Tommy could read but Cullen couldn’t. Not even those were consistent, if he pretended the blobs reflected some kind of pattern.

“Don’t keep trying. Your eyes will start to bleed eventually. That isn’t a joke.” Tommy was watching him, as if he expected the words to jump off and attack Cullen. Cullen took that mental image to heart, and held the documents at a certain level distance from his face.

**Visual Imagery**: Large room. Enough space for most subjects. Table. Cushions. Chairs are not sufficient. Bean bag stolen recently. D Autumn, interviewee classification Oceaner88.

**Oceaner88**: “We were supposed to go swimming together. I left for a handful of minutes. The path changed. She was gone when I returned.” Subject’s tone is clipped, to the point. Possibly evasive.

**D Autumn**: “Records show she passed the entry examination. She had all necessary limbs or sufficient stand-ins, and made the appropriate direct or reflective eye contact. ‘Explore human water’ was the stated goal. Do you think she could’ve been deceptive?"

**Oceaner88:** Flash of discomfort. Maybe anger. Frill movement meaning unclear. Gesturing. “Never.” *It suddenly got blurry. Maybe there was a name there?* “Never lied, not once. You let her in, so she should’ve been okay.” Definitive display of frustration.

“Why is this so… Literal?” Cullen looked at Tommy.

“The Author.” Tommy replied, like that meant anything.

“What?”

“Steals records sometimes, turns them into stories. He’s drawn to… Vivid descriptions. If you ever see a guy who makes you really feel like reading a book roll up to the window, don’t let him in.”

Cullen didn’t know what to say to that, so he kept reading.

**D Autumn:** “That isn’t my job. That was-” Cuts herself off. “-Never mind. Did she enter abnormally after clearance? Did she… Break your rules? Not ours.”

**Oceaner88:** “She used your currency. Bought your shelter. She-”

**D Autumn:** Cuts subject off. “Okay. Did anyone… Approach you, after? Anyone you did not feel comfortable around? After she… Went away. Or before.”

**Oceaner88:** Notable silent period. Flexing of gills. Distress? “They said she wasn’t supposed to use the tunnels. That it wasn’t the proper way in. Said it would’ve been allowed to…” Gesturing.

**D Autumn:** “Slide?” Subject confusion. Clarification. “Like the… The motion, not the toy.” Further confusion. “Social motion.”

**Oceaner88:** “Yes. They said too many things broke recently, and she didn’t use the… Approved path. So she went away. If she did not do it again, when the other things happened, it would’ve… Been allowed to slide. I don’t understand. She was given permission. Why does it matter after? The water… Connects for a reason.”

**D Autumn:** “Do you know who… They were? Where… Where the other one like you went.”

**Oceaner88:** Visible anguish. Distress. Consolation is attempted to allow progress, and minutes pass. “I don’t remember.” Is asked if coerced, or hiding information. “I don’t know where she went. Is she alone? This was you, yes? We will follow the rules, please. Undo it.”

**Visual Imagery:** Subject becomes agitated. Almost becomes aggressive. Is incapable of comprehending the inability of border security to resolve sources of distress.

**Aftermath:** Shortly after, an underwater tunnel was discovered at-” *Blurry spot, again.* “-and is now in the process of being sealed. Engineers and workers attendant reported seeing the interview subject entering the tunnel mid-construction. Refused to halt when asked. Evidence recovery and investigation resources are expended. No remains or signs of the subject are found on either side of the wall, or at the river the subject’s-” *Another blurry word.* “-Disappeared. Society-side habitation path is tracked to-” *Blur. When Cullen stared at this one hard enough, it felt familiar. He checked the photo that had been taken at his apartment block. No one like this was missing, or visible.* “-Apartment room is found vacant. All possessions that were personal are missing. Calls were made by appropriate sectional staff. Mementos have been returned to perceived familial, platonic relations without error.”

Cullen stared at the document quietly for a while, then set it aside. He looked out the window of the security booth, let his eyes roam over the monitors. Nothing of note was happening.

Lupe was reading something. Sketching. Cullen had noticed she did it a lot. Mainly with non-fiction, or things that were more or less in line with how the world worked, or could, or used to. He’d tried to show her a fantasy novel he’d been reading once, and for some reason it had freaked her out. He’d seen her eyes light up like she was about to be shot, and like she thought the bullet would actually do something. He had no idea why. But it was how he’d discovered that the walls had an HR department.

Cullen returned to reading. “Who writes these, anyways? You?”

Tommy actually answered. “Me, and anyone who has to go out to, or receive and interpret, things from people who cross the walls. Or who try to.”

“There’s always paperwork, huh?”

“Always. You just don’t see most of it.” Tommy looked around the room like he could see invisible paper stacks threatening to topple and smother them all. Cullen figured, if you did try to gather all the paperwork for this section alone in this one room, you probably could.

The Visual Imagery bit read the same, but replaced D Autumn with D South, and Oceaner88 with Jeff. Presumably Jeff was human. Otherwise, Cullen could only wonder what classification Jeff was analogous to. His dad had always said there’s certain types of people you don’t want around, and he’d been talking about personality. Maybe the strangers had a filing cabinet somewhere with his name in it, and it read something like Personality: Stubborn Idiot.

He cracked a smile that made Tommy look at him sideways. He *had* seen what looked like office buildings out there.

**Jeff:** “You’re gonna tell me where he went, right?” Beanie hat is adjusted. Agitated tapping.

**D South:** “That’s what we’re here to find out.” Smile. Does not get intended reception.

**Jeff:** “Listen, man. I don’t know what goes on outside the walls. What I know is it’s your job to keep track of that. You’re supposed to let people back in, aren’t you? He passed.”

**D South:** Adjusts glasses. “Yes, that is correct. Which we can get to much faster if you cooperate.”

**Jeff:** Subject seems to want to give retort. Refrains. “He was collecting sand.”

**D South:** “For what purpose?”

**Jeff:** “Art projects. He did this… Thing. Where he’d just.” Gesture. “Make it turn to glass. It didn’t harm nobody, so everyone let him do that. You’re supposed to clear them a… Whatsit. ‘Approved hobby’, aren’t you?”

**D South:** “Reasonable secrets, reasonable personal items, reasonable traditions that do not clarify excessively, and reasonable hobbies are allowed past the walls, yes.”

**Jeff:** “...I don’t like you. You’re uppity. I swear to god, I-”

**D South:** “No, you won’t.” Leans forward. “And if you want anything to change for the better, you need to give us information.”

**Jeff:** Hesitation. Sweat. “Listen. He… He told me. Well. You know, not with words, but. He told me that someone had been messing with his… Pile? Sand pile, I think. Something about there being too much, more than he was supposed to bring. I think someone was messing with him.”

**D South:** “And you don’t know who?”

**Jeff:** “He’d said… Others like him. That’s all. He kinda was acting like there was something he couldn’t tell me, but I know we aren’t supposed to pry. I… Kinda did anyways, though.”

**D South:** “In what manner?”

**Jeff:** “Know a guy. Owns some kinda machine that sorts grains, counts them. Ran some of his piles through it, and it came out the second time around with a few more than it was supposed to have. When I told him he freaked out a bit.”

**D South:** “Do you think this caused him to do anything… Untoward?”

**Aftermath:** Interviewee became increasingly agitated and distressed, but was eventually calmed and reassured before allowed to leave. The entry report was pulled after the interview for the associated victim. After peer review, it was determined the individual had been unfit due to a missed discrepancy in eye contact equivalency. No further relevant information was gained from interviewee, but the relevant case has been closed and any and all watch or sweep alerts have been halted. D South has been noted to have suffered unexplainable but minor injury upon next expedition into the Outside. Audio peer review has determined the D to have lied directly to the interviewee about the state of the missing unfit.

Cullen felt his hand shake a little, but it wasn’t because he was spooked. He grit his teeth.

Before he could check the third interview report, the lights on the alert board lit up.

“Familiar unfit approaching. Caution. Designation: The Author.” Ron’s weathered voice boomed and crackled over the intercom.

Cullen put the files down, walked over to the alert board and sat down. He frowned at his mug, set it aside, and watched the monitor.

“He can’t do anything to you from out there. But he’s absolutely going to try to convince you he can.” Tommy dropped the tidbit like it was just part of routine, which was fair enough. Cullen had been spooked before, even before the window almost broke, but he’d never had a single one of the strangers actually try to do anything but try to get him to go out. Some would lie, some would try to persuade or straight up bribe you, but it only went bad if you let them in.

Unless you were dumb enough to break rules right after, Outside, where they could touch you.

13-A-9. 13-A-8. 13-A-7.

“What’s he gonna try? Does he sell books or something?”

“Not to us.” Tommy cocked his head, scanned the board. He didn’t seem put off, so neither was Cullen.

“Unapproved factor sighted.” Ron’s voice crackled again. “All security in section, to alert.”

Cullen craned his neck over the monitors, too. Followed light to label, hovered his finger over a few relevant buttons. Almost all of them just gave him access to hidden speakers, let him turn drones on or off or move them if it was necessary. Some sent out alerts, or warnings. Most of them were for solo, when the Outside got antsy and needed less eyes. Otherwise, it was up to Ron, his aides, or other shifters. Late nighters.

He saw a man with a beanie, who didn’t look like he’d been meant to go out there. Judging by the fact Lupe was getting up, he definitely wasn’t. She didn’t take a gun, or a suit, since she belonged out there. She knew the rules better, though lately Cullen wasn’t sure how much better. Cullen watched her disappear across the field, through the woods, and do what he couldn’t. Walk the paths. One moment she was here, then she was there.

Cullen watched the alert board recognize her. Heard Ron call out over the Outside systems to approach security. He called himself god, but he needed his angels, so his aides came out of the woodworks. They weren’t seen or heard unless they wanted to be. In chorus, their variety of voices and a few less familiar sounds sent the same rough message.

“Designated booth officer approach. No inter-section intervention. Watch only.”

Cullen watched the Author move from 13-A-7 to 13-A-6. He noted that he was actually moving fairly slowly. Like he was on a stroll. He saw the exact perfect representation of what one expected an author to look like on the back of a novel, coming to life and moving through a world that seemed natural to them. He struggled, though, to place what kind of writer he was looking at. Physically. He just looked at his features, and he didn’t know how they made him feel.

His palms began to sweat a little. He drank from his mug, paused mid-sip, then checked the board again.

He was moving too slow. No way he crossed several sectors that fast.

“Hey, Tom. Something’s not right.” He pointed out 13-A-9 and 13-A-8.

“That? Don’t worry about it. Means it’s fine.”

“The hell?” Cullen watched the monitors, watched them very closely. He saw nothing. There was maybe a shifting of leaves, maybe a rustle of a bush, maybe a bending branch. But there wasn’t any sound. He flicked a switch, so that would change. It was a very case-by-case, what do you want to risk sort of thing, to lessen that barrier enough to let in more than what could be seen. But he felt he needed to know.

He didn’t hear anything.

The man in the beanie met at 13-A-6 with the Author. He must’ve stopped for some reason earlier, gotten out to figure out if he was at the right spot, his vehicle just out of sight. It was now blatantly obvious he was driving a jeep. How the hell did he get that through the gate?

He was also holding a hell of a lot of things that very much belonged on the paths, or even inside the buildings in the suburb patches. He opened the trunk of the jeep, and there was some kind of machine that looked like a printer stuffed in the back.

“Hey. This good enough?” The man with the beanie watched the Author approach with far too little alarm, and not near enough skepticism. He looked almost excited, hopeful. Big smile on his face, even though his body language didn’t quite match.

The Author walked up to him, his best clothes on, something in his posture, his facial features, the very way he carried himself telling you that he knew what you wanted. He shook the beanie man’s hands. It was a firm shake.

“Of course. You brought everything I asked.” The Author sounded warm.

“This situation isn’t normal.” Tommy began to sweat, visibly. His voice was shrill for a second. He hit a button. “Ron, I think you need to get security out there. Now.”

Suddenly, every moving entity converged at the same spot. 13-A-6. Cullen saw Lupe emerge onto the scene, smoothly sliding into existence the way she was meant to. Judging by the reaction of the man in the beanie, he did not like her real face, not one bit.

“The fuck is that?” He directed the question to the Author.

“Nothing to worry about. Just wait a second.” The Author pulled out a cigarette, lit it. He seemed to think everyone involved had all the time in the world. Ron didn’t respond to the direct communication. But something responded to the developing scene.

There was no sound, still. Everything moved, then went quiet. They were in the middle of some kind of parking lot, in front of what looked like a shopping mall. Cullen saw a handful of strangers peek from windows, turn corners, or look on from a safe distance. Each one left. Normally, Cullen would watch them, at least when they were actually present, go about what were obviously meant to be human activities. Or something adjacent. Right now, they proved that included the ability to leave when they weren’t meant to see something.

The man in the beanie didn’t. Jeff didn’t. There was a flicker of sirens, of shoes against the sidewalk. Some shrill noise like a baby’s cry that didn’t quite match up, someone moving through the checkout at a store. Answered calls, even little things, like swiveled chairs, someone pausing at the top of the stairs, someone flipping something in a frying pan.

Then it stopped.

Lupe was looking at something. Something that Cullen couldn’t see. Cullen looked at Tommy. He seemed to be squinting, like he was looking at something that wasn’t quite there. He made a face. Cullen made one, too, and his whole body went rigid. It felt like if he moved himself, he might end up somewhere he wouldn’t want to be, meet someone he didn’t want to. There were hands at the corners of his vision that he couldn’t see, and they were patient, unjudging, but they would reach out if he moved wrong.

Jeff had moved wrong a long time ago. Cullen had watched Lupe work before. And she was fast, decisive, and typically did not stand so rigidly and wide-eyed in the face of a crisis.

Something happened. Jeff moved, just slightly. A brief shift of the shoulder, a crane of his neck to try to get a look at something he didn’t know wasn’t meant for his eyes. He didn’t even get to finish the motion. His eyes didn’t go all the way right.

Cullen watched the Author mouth something. Read his lips.

“These sensations, they are not meant for you.” Jeff looked shocked. He stretched his foot, just slightly, like the ground was gone and he was about to fall. But he didn’t. “These sounds, they are not meant for you.” Cullen didn’t know what that did, but he had a guess. Jeff seemed to understand perfectly, though, when the rest came. Though he obviously did not hear Lupe whine. “Your agency is denied where it is not granted.” Jeff’s hands disappeared, and he dropped everything. His legs buckled, and were cleanly detached from his torso. “These sights are not for those who don’t respect them.” His eyes withered out of his skull. “You are not meant to be here. You are not permitted. Begone: Delinquents are not wanted. Not there, not here.”

The Author’s lips stopped moving. He had a smile on his face. As he smiled, Jeff stopped existing.

He held up a book, which he definitely didn’t have just a moment ago. It had a cover design that looked like some kind of beach, with colorful little patterns interspersed. Lupe looked at him like she was waiting for him to go away, too. Her features shifted, from tense to the kind of relaxed you’d expect someone to be when the other shoe was about to drop.

There was no guillotine. The world returned to life around them, as if nothing had ever happened. The strangers returned to their routines, and it was once again unclear which of them did and did not belong.

“This should count.” The Author pulled a second copy of the book he held out of his pocket, smaller. “But I can only get it where it needs to go, if you let me leave, too.”

Cullen wasn’t sure what emotion he felt, watching the exchange happen. But the moment the stranger walked off, book in hand, he followed him on the monitor. He noticed some things: little broken objects that he pointedly stepped around, forming a trail that was heavily interrupted, never too dense, never too thin, which only went back the same direction he’d come from. When Cullen looked back to the exchange point, he saw a curious stranger, something long and slimy, open the jeep’s side door.

There were a lot of things that belonged on the path inside the vehicle. Things from each terrain, in equal numbers. Things that were from either side of the wall that no rules or manners permitted to be there without approval, but here they were. Some were obviously not an issue, but the person collecting them probably didn’t know what would do the trick and what wouldn’t. There were even leaves, small twigs.

When Lupe returned, she put her human skin back on the moment she stepped in. She crumpled up whatever she’d been sketching, tossed it in the trash. A light went on. The pot-crab creature was back, in the exact same position it had been previously. It finished its task, as it had intended to originally. And it went from point to point, lights flaring, all the way to the checkpoint it had to go through.

It waited patiently for another entity to be approved and pass through. It stepped carefully, and met every requirement. It went through the gate. Nothing unusual happened. The book went in the boon box, though Tommy wondered aloud if it should be given over to it.

Cullen did not check what had been thrown into the trash. Cullen checked only a single page in the book, just to confirm something, and he read a passage about an apartment where two people who thought the other were very strange, but who they enjoyed the company of, lived together.

When he saw the note, signed by a certain author, that had been slipped inside and offered him something in exchange for that third document, Cullen put it away instead of reading it, and he did not perform the exchange. He did not know if there would be consequences for denying the bastard, but he knew something for sure. There would be if he didn’t, and it was impolite to pry.

None of the strangers who came after that, that day, wanted to cross the wall. Instead, they deposited, one by one, things into the deposit tube. It took a while for the rhyme and reason to become clear, and for Cullen to notice the jeep was gone. Every single thing that had been part of, or inside, the jeep, and every object the man with the beanie had held, that the strangers had not felt belonged, had been returned. Everything they did, they kept.

The beanie was the last thing deposited into the box, and there was a man's name on the inside, on a little inner tag. Cullen did not read it. But he made sure it got home.
