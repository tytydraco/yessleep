I know this probably sounds insane, but I needed to get it out before I lose my mind. I haven’t slept properly in days, and no one I’ve talked to believes me. Maybe someone here has experienced something similar… or at least can tell me I’m not crazy.

Here’s what’s been happening in my apartment over the past week.


I’ve lived in small apartments before. I’ve heard
 neighbors fighting, babies crying through the walls, even mice scratching behind old drywall. But this… this is something else.

I moved into this place last week. It’s a tiny one-bedroom unit on the third floor of a crumbling building on the edge of the city. The kind of place you only consider when rent prices make you feel like sleeping in your car. It smelled like dust and old wood, but it was quiet, and it was mine.

The first night passed uneventfully. I unpacked, ordered takeout, and fell asleep watching a movie on my laptop. But by the second night, I started to notice something odd. The wall beside my bed—the one I share with the supposedly empty unit next door—felt… strange.

At first, it was subtle. When I leaned my head against it to plug in my charger, I felt a faint vibration. Not a buzz like electricity, but more like a slow, rhythmic thump. I assumed it was the building settling or maybe a water pipe.

But it didn’t stop.

On the third night, the sound became clearer. I lay in bed with the lights off, trying to ignore it, but there it was:
Thump… thump… thump.
Steady. Like a heartbeat.

I pressed my ear against the wall. That’s when I heard it.
Breathing.
Deep, slow breathing.
Inhale… exhale… over and over, steady and calm.

It was so human, so unmistakable, that I jumped back and turned on every light in the apartment. I barely slept that night.

The next morning, I called my landlord. He sounded annoyed before I even explained.
“No one’s in that unit,” he said. “It’s been vacant for months. Maybe you’re just hearing echoes through the pipes.”

I didn’t believe him. Not after what I heard next.

On the fifth night, the whispering started.

It began around 3 a.m.—a faint, breathy murmur. I couldn’t make out most of it, but one phrase repeated itself:
"Open the door…"
Over and over.
"Open the door…"

There is no door on that wall.

That night, I didn’t sleep at all. I sat in the kitchen, lights on, knife in hand. Every time I stepped near the bedroom, I could hear the breathing—closer now, almost… eager.

This morning, I found something new. A faint crack in the paint along the bedroom wall. No, not a crack—a line. Perfectly vertical. Like a seam. Like something waiting to be opened.

Tonight is the sixth night.

The breathing is louder. The wall feels warm. I touched it just an hour ago, and it pulsed beneath my fingers.

I don’t know what’s behind it. I don’t want to know. But it wants me to open it. I can feel that now. Like it's calling to me—lonely, hungry, patient.

I’m writing this in case I don’t make it through the night. If someone finds this… check the wall.

And whatever you do,
don’t open it.
