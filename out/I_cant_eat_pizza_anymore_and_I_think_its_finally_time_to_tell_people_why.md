The corpse lay with one arm tucked under the torso and crusted pizza sauce dripping down its cheek onto the unforgiving tile floor. Before that day, only shiny black crickets knew death on that floor. To me and my broom they were nothing but a chore that I had to finish quickly so I could get home without getting stuck by the 12:50 freight train. I heard the horn of that train the night of the attack as I cowered in my hiding spot. I considered it before and my chances of surviving an apocalypse were decidedly low, if that’s even what this was. I was never a camping type. I didn’t get enough exercise, not to say I wasn’t in shape back then. But when I think about the feats that people did in novels and newspapers to escape the killer or down the beast…Well, I just don’t think I could. Only a week before the incident I read “Intensity” by Dean Koontz. I remember stopping at the scene where the main girl risks breaking bones in order to snap the chair she’s bound to and being completely unable to fathom doing the same. Does the water know it can boil when put in the pot?  
	  
The clock read 5:30 when it happened, a while before the crickets met their dustpan graveyard. I threw my now empty hot bag onto the pile. The delivery screen showed nothing new, so I decided to knock out my in-store duties before more orders popped up: taking out the trash and wiping down the bins. I told the GM to call me up when an order dropped. My coworker, Isabella, caught me as I was headed to the back. She snuck up behind me and poked me in the side. I mock gasped.  
“Bels, are you in love with me or something?”  
“Totally.” She laughed. “And it’s your turn, by the way. In pool.”  
“Bet.” I flashed her a smile and pulled out my phone. We had a pretty intense virtual game going on. “I’m going to dish you up and eat you for breakfast.”  
“Whatever you say.” She waved her hand in the air as she turned back to the oven, adjusting her one earphone that she always wore to work. It was pastel pink and shaped like an elf ear. I always thought that was cute. “That’s what you said about our round of darts.”  
I chuckled a little as I made my way into the back of the store, my mind lingering on Bel’s voice. It was a little raspy, in a way that made me want to kiss her. I’m blushing even now thinking about it. I had a crush on her from the first day I came onto the team.   
It only took a few minutes to empty the bins, with a few added minutes for each turn of virtual pool. Tuesday afternoon shifts were slow as hell, so I wasn’t worried. I hauled the trash bags out the back door, tripping over the threshold a bit and heading down the ramp to the dumpsters. I was in a small college town. Not the kind of small where everyone knows each other, but small enough to know every street like the back of my hand. A few people were milling about, but most were on campus for classes. Thankfully, all my classes were Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, which left me just enough working hours to scrape by monthly, but not enough time to have a social life. It was a little humid out, and I broke a sweat as I walked down the ramp.  
I looked up momentarily after tossing the bags in the dumpster and noticed a mother and her toddler. They were dressed in swimsuits, the little boy sporting a sun hat, but he had pulled it back from his forehead to look up at the sky. His mother was doing the same, and she clutched his hand a little tighter than a protective mother normally would, or at least that’s what it seems to me looking back. I followed their confused stares to the skies. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the bright sun, but as the spots around the corners faded, I noticed something glinting in the sunlight. I noticed many shining things in the sky, like stars that were much too close. As they moved closer, I made out a luminescent, slightly tinted substance, like goo in texture. Sacks, dripping from the sky. I couldn’t tell where they were dripping from, but it felt for a moment like I was standing on the tongue of a giant monster watching its saliva drip down from its teeth. One of the sacks rapidly approached the ground, slowing the closer it got. A few feet from hitting it the bottom of the sack rippled and its long tail thinned so much that it snapped, dropping it suddenly onto the hard pavement of the Wendy’s back parking lot. The sack popped in an array of misty colors and left in its place was a creature so strange that it took me a moment to even register what I was seeing.  
Dripping with the same slime the sack was composed of, its limbs were long and black, shorter in the back. It was sleek, hairless, and dog-like in form, except for the head, which came together in a heart like shape, very similar to a Praying Mantis. I heard the child scream as its mother scooped it into the air and began running. The sunhat fluttered onto the abandoned sidewalk. I didn’t see where they ended up, or if they were safe. All I could focus on were the sacs bursting around me and releasing more of these monsters. One broke off and popped maybe a hundred feet from me. The creature took a moment to stand up, balancing like a newborn deer. I let out a small gasp, mesmerized by it despite the fear crawling up my back. Its head snapped in my direction, and large, fly-like eyes met mine, predator eyes. It moved barely an inch in my direction before I booked it up the ramp and into the store.  
It’s hard to say exactly what happened next. There was a bang and then an insufferably high-pitched scratching noise at the back door. I heard the windows in the front of the store breaking. I heard screams. Lucas, another of my coworkers, had been doing dishes in the back. He turned as I stumbled inside with a confused expression.  
“H-hide!” I barely managed to warn him before I heard the hinges on the back door start to crack. I dove for the laundry bin, one of my favorite hiding spots as a kid, and dug out just enough space to wiggle in. Lucas dashed for the bathroom. Without hesitation, I pulled the remaining rags on top of me, blessing whoever forgot to wash them this morning. Under no other circumstance would I be touching those rags with my hands, much less all the other parts of my body they were now pressed against. I tried to block out the smell of cleaning supplies and the toilet odor. It wasn’t hard once I heard one of the monsters crashing in from the front of the store, soon followed by the back door being broken through.  
Suddenly, things seemed very quiet, and my breathing felt very loud. I heard a strange cooing noise, like a bird…or maybe a cat… and then another responding. Claws clicked against the tile floor. A few black crickets scurried past my spot and under the washing machine. I envied them. All I could see was a small patch of ground through the rags, and then a gnarled, untrimmed claw scraping its way past. Out of instinct, my breathing slowed. The side of a black mandible dropped into my line of sight, sniffing and drawing closer to me, dripping dark red spots onto stark white linoleum. I felt its warm breath as it stopped by the bin, and I desperately hoped the dirty towels would mask my scent. What strange senses did creatures like this have? As it’s breath swept over me, I caught a whiff of it. It didn’t smell like anything I’ve known before, and a feeling of discomfort washed over me. Everything felt real and not real all at once and I thought for a moment that my bones were about to leap from my body as a series of goosebumps started to run down both my arms.  
That’s when I heard Bel’s voice. Raspy, but clear as always. The creature snapped its head away, and I would have felt relief. I would have felt relief if it were anyone but Bels.  
“It’s okay guys! They’re gone. You can come out now!” A call from the front. I stifled my urge to cry as I waited for the inevitable. But the monster wasn’t attacking. I could still see its claw through my peephole.  
“Come out! It’s safe. We need to regroup.” It was definitely Bel’s voice.  
I heard a shuffling noise from the bathroom, and I stifled another urge to shout that at least one monster was still here. The bathroom door creaked open, and I heard Lucas whisper.  
“Isabel-” He was cut off by his own whimper, a small cry. Then I heard a fraction of a scream interrupted by a noise I’ll never forget: the tearing of human flesh. I could easily imagine the scene just from the ripping sounds and the specks of blood splattering the part of the floor I could see. The last thing I ever heard from Lucas was a gurgle, hopefully not a conscious one.   
Another monster came clicking in from the kitchen, and I heard Bel’s voice again, clearer and louder. A mimic. I was reminded of that time years before when a friend of mine showed me the movie “Annihilation”. The scene with the mutant bear haunted me for months afterward. I didn’t think something could scare me like that until the attack.. My only comfort back then was thinking that something like that would never happen to me.  
The monsters left the store soon after, but I waited for hours crouched in that laundry bin breathing in the rancid smells of gore and Mr. Clean’s Multi-Surface Spray.  
It’s getting late here, but I will continue this entry as soon as possible. It may take me a few days to recuperate mentally, but I’m determined to write everything down. I hope these memories don’t infect my dreams tonight.
