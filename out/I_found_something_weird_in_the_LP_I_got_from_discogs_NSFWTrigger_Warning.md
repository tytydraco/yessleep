I ordered a copy of Psychic TV's 1988 album, *Allegory and Self* from discogs, and I found a manuscript of an essay in the LP's sleeve which seems like it was meant to be published at some point, though I'm not sure where.

I think that the record's previous owner left it there by accident. The references in it are current enough that it can't be older than five months.

&#x200B;

After following the author's instructions, I ended up in a mental health crisis center, then Ft. Grippy Sock for a few weeks. There are certain truths which the mind does not accept easily. Be careful. Be mindful of your fear.

&#x200B;

Here is the text of the manuscript

Author’s Note:I am writing this essay under a pseudonym, since I’m pretty openly explicit about “naming names”, so to speak. *The Theogony of Zalty* and *A Myth of Ellis*, I’m fine publishing under my legal name. However, with this essay, there’s a “poking the bear” quality which I want to handle carefully. This is for the sake of my own sanity, and the sanity of those whose life would be affected by unwanted attention from indoctrinated internet weirdos. I also think that quality is what makes \*redacted\* great. I truly feel that you will enjoy this work, and I eagerly look forward to your feedback.

Magick is real. This is not some sort of statement of faith, but a practical truth that I intend to demonstrate to you directly, by the time you finish reading this essay. I will ask that you set aside the time necessary to review the material I present here. It is readily available from easy-to-find sources for zero to reasonable cost, no more than the average person wastes on nonsense every month. Occult secrets are much like that. *Phillip K Dick*, in his Exegesis (available on audible - hold your anticapitalist indignation, I know you have a subscription), describes the nature of spiritual truth in the literary garbage of every age, comparing them to words of *Jesus* when he described himself as *“The Stone That the Builder Refused”*. *Wouter Hanegraaf* in his Book, *Esotericism and the Academy* argues for a definition of Esotericism as “The Rejected Knowledge of the Western World”, and provides a formal academic argument for PKD’s mystical intuitions. His book is 35$ from Cambridge University Press, and while I won’t moralize about the way you acquire this knowledge, I will say that financially supporting academics who do this sort of work is probably a better use of 35$ than that overpriced gram of weed you’re thinking of buying right now. No good comes of supporting the dreams of weed industry bros. It’s legal where you live. Grow your own.

&#x200B;

In this spirit of recovering the philosopher’s stone from the landfill of our collective unconscious, I will present the first piece of enlightening garbage on our journey of discovery, revealing the raw electrical current of magick by “shocking” you with it. I say this in the spirit of transparency. It is my intention to be conscientious about its application. Electricity can injure a person severely if mishandled, and magick is similar in that respect. Many of these injuries occur in churches, are inflicted deliberately, and upon people of a very young age.

I was injured via eldritch shock in 2000, at a youth group in Tulsa, OK. *Church on the Move*, and the various organizational branches of *Willie George Ministries*, ran sophisticated propaganda operations out of that city. Around Halloween, two episodes of the 1990 production *Fire by Nite*, were played to *Oneighty*, the Jr. High youth group. As an adult, I laugh at the obvious unsourced claims and manipulative filmmaking. Then, I believed it was true.

&#x200B;

They put us into a suggestive state using repetitive melodies and lyrics for extended periods. Then, they lowered the lights and showed the first episode. After that, another session of the hypnotic musical *Occult Pastorcraft*, then the second episode. These episodes are available on YouTube. All you have to do is search  *Fire by Nite 9009 and Fire by Nite 9010*. Connoisseurs of Satanic Panic media will be refreshed by the raw entertainment value of the video, compared with the dry tone of the genre’s usual fare. I will not spoil the surprise. They’re worth a watch on their own merits.

&#x200B;

This is the first stopping point in this essay. Watch those videos now. Listen to creepy evangelical worship music on repeat for at least 30 minutes before each video if you’re into that sort of thing.

&#x200B;

That is, if you’re super gay for full somatic immersion. Don’t lie. We know you’re into that shit.

&#x200B;

Now that you’ve passed the first gate, remember that this was locally produced by passionate, well-paid amateurs in Tulsa, Oklahoma in the year 1990. Those who lived in the MO/AR/OK/KAN area during the Satanic Panic will have deep core memories of this weird, coercive mystical current. Those who don’t will get the basic idea by watching the previously mentioned videos. If you’re reading ahead, cut that shit out and watch the videos. I’m serious. Fuck off.

&#x200B;

When those things have been contemplated to your satisfaction, search YouTube for the video How Emotions Are Made (Cinematic Lecture). It’s a frank and intuitive introduction to the work of  renowned neuroscientist, Lisa Feldman Barrett. When you watch this video (Again, this is mandatory. Stop reading and watch it now.)

&#x200B;

If you know how to follow basic instructions (I’m looking YOU, thou reincarnation of Jack Parsons. Read past the introduction!), an understanding should be developing by now. The predictive brain is hijacked, as is the affect and language, for the purpose of cauterizing the part of you that feels curiosity. Not effective for the average skeptical, relatively emotionally stable adult. For a room of 12-year olds? The holographic reality is accepted without question.

&#x200B;

Other, more coercive methods of indoctrination were available to more intransigent subjects. Have you read *The Invisibles* by *Grant Morrison*?

&#x200B;

Harmony House is real. They operate in the open. Do you remember the *“Cash Me Outside Girl”* from that old *Dr. Phil* episode? If so, you may recognize the name “*Turn-About Ranch”.* Her experience of the place is documented in the YouTube video titled *BHAD BHABIE - Breaking Code Silence - Turn About Ranch abuse Dr. Phil | Danielle Bregoli*.

&#x200B;

Stop reading and watch that video now.

&#x200B;

By now, you probably have questions. Naturally, this is the case. Where did this come from? From *the CIA’s experiments with LSD at Harvard University*, to put it simply. One of their subjects started the United States’ first attempts at curing heroin addiction, *Synanon*. What ultimately happened was the creation of a malicious cult, and its particular cult indoctrination technology has bled into all levels of US society and culture. Again, stop reading now and look up the five-part podcast miniseries, *TrueAnon The Game.*

It’s a difficult listen, and I encourage the reader of this essay to consume it according to their personal comfort level. It’s heavy stuff, and you will probably need time to process the information. Don’t get bogged down in attempting to formulate these understandings too quickly. Study and Praxis are like weightlifting. If you’re ego-lifting with bad form, you’ll injure yourself.

&#x200B;

Take your time. Take it easy. Take it in.

&#x200B;

And stop reading ahead.

&#x200B;

Now, with this knowledge, - may it deepen your understanding - the germinating gnosis should be taking solid form, more or less.

&#x200B;

Stop reading again (I feel like you should know enough to understand why I’m instructing you to do this, if you’ve been following my instructions.), pull up youtube, and search for *Who is Yahweh - How a Warrior-Storm God became the God of the Israelites and World Monotheism*. After having done this, think of this anecdote which my mother once related to me.

&#x200B;

She told me once that, before she ever had a kid, she didn’t consider herself capable of murder. When the first child was born, she underwent an inward change where she knew that she was capable of it. It made me think of the violence and force of *Kali* as depicted in her traditional Hindu iconography. If you paid attention to *Dr. Sledge’s* video on the origins of *Yahweh*, you might remember his consort, *Anat-Yahu*, and her iconography. Those familiar with the *Chaldean Oracles* should know her as *Hecate*.Now, think of the *“mama bear”* archetype and its particular ubiquity within conservative evangelical culture.  You see, even though contemporary devotees of that bronze-age storm god do not pay her homage, she still abides with them.

&#x200B;

You should now understand the effect of environment upon the individual, and some of the common misguided applications of this knowledge

.

Now, I am preparing to “shock” you. There are two more YouTube videos which offer an exit door from *The Game* via knowledge of certain pieces of *“Trash”, “Woo”, and “Camp”.*

&#x200B;

While there are those whose craft is fashioned for the purpose of fear-based control, there are those who would offer the Medicine which is the antidote to their poison. And it can only be found in the city, the path to which one must apply certain observances; that is, one must not bring food, for fear of wild animals, or bring jewels and costly garments, for fear of bandits and robbers.

&#x200B;

Go to YouTube and search for *The Magic Christian (1969) - Ringo Starr, Peter Sellers.*

&#x200B;

After that, look up *DKMU - The Media Magician*, keeping in mind that it was produced and uploaded to YouTube in the year 2009.

&#x200B;

The diligent reader will presently understand what I mean when I say “Magick is Real” and why I emphasize the dangers and hardships of The Path, in the context of this essay.

&#x200B;

Rigorous scholarship is the insulation which mitigates the risk of serious injury.

&#x200B;

So that I don’t release you into the world, only to fall prey to the contemporary *P.T. Barnums* of the spiritual community, I will instruct you to search YouTube for the playlist called *Historiography & Historical Research Methods*. I also recommend that the prospective magician invest in a subscription to *The Great Courses* streaming service for $20/month. For a service which provides a solid knowledge foundation for a wide range of undergraduate-level subjects, from STEM to the Humanities, it’s the best bargain you’re going to get in this lifetime.

&#x200B;

The hidden fact, which is occulted  by obscurity and not secrecy, is that *The Invisible College* is actually a literal college. You will not get certificates of authority, which is of little to no interest for the competent magician, but you will gain practical knowledge. These principles are applicable to any competent experimenter who doesn't rely on the permission of educational or ecclesiastical authorities to do The Work.  The only armor which protects against ignorance is knowledge.

This is not a war.

This is a rescue mission.

Therefore, go forth.
