Part I

"JESUS CHRIST." My aunt's voice, coming from somewhere deep in the house, was loud enough to carry all the way to the second floor.

I had been scrolling aimlessly on my phone, listening to the soft patter of rain outside. It fell from my hands and onto the ground as I sprinted from my room, taking the stairs two at a time to make my way to the kitchen.

Aunt Marlie stood at the sink, scrubbing her hands viciously like she had touched something poisonous.

"What happened?!" I said, my eyes darting around the room. They found the counter, and I felt my jaw drop.

The food we had made yesterday was a putrefied mess.

The tin foil was pulled back from the bowl I had made yesterday, and the vegetables that had been fresh less than 24 hours ago had wilted into a mushy, unrecognizable heap, oozing a dark, sticky liquid that pooled around their container. The rolls, stacked neatly in a basket, were now covered in a crawling green mold, their texture like sponges. The pies were out, too, and even without taking the plastic wrap off, I could see that something was wiggling around in at least two of them, tiny white maggots struggling to make their way out of their containment.

Even the air in the room felt damp with the stench of rot.

I pulled my shirt over my mouth and nose, holding it tightly.

"I honestly don't…I think we must have lost power last night during the storm. The lights were flickering this morning, too." My aunt was still scrubbing her hands. She sounded defeated.

I stared at the mess for another minute before finally taking action, grabbing a garbage bag from a cabinet and tossing out the putrid food. It was so foul that I wished I had rubber gloves. I could understand why Aunt Marlie was still scrubbing her palms raw at the sink. I struggled with the bag's weight, sliding it to the back door.

Through the window on the door, haunted eyes stared back at me. I reared back, opening my mouth to scream, only to realize it was Tyler. His face was sopping wet from the rain. Maybe he had been out doing his list of chores and came when he heard his mother scream.

Or he had been watching us from outside.

"What the hell, Tyler?" I demanded. He stood in the doorway, dripping onto the linoleum. I shoved the trash bag into his hand.

"Can you take this out, please?" My voice made it clear it was more of a demand than a request. His arm raised to take it automatically, but his face gave no indication that he understood me. He was staring at his mother, who had turned off the water but still stood hunched over the sink.

"Now, Tyler." I pushed at his chest, only to grasp at his shirt when it seemed he was going to let me knock him over altogether. That seemed to jostle him enough to get him moving, and he turned towards the garage.

Watching him leave, I realized he wasn't wearing his coat or shoes despite the frigid rain. I almost called him back, but by the time I processed what I had seen, he had already turned the corner and was out of sight.

"Aunt Marlie-" I started to say something, but I didn't know where to start.

"I'm going to go to the store." She said firmly. "We need food for Thanksgiving."

"I- okay. Sure. But-" I tried to interject. I needed to tell her about Tyler.

"I'll be gone for a few hours." Her voice was trembling with emotion, and her hands were shaking, too. I guessed she had hit her limit.

I bit my lip, debating whether to mention Tyler's bizarre behavior. I decided it could wait until she got back.

"Alright, take your time, and drive safe," I said. She walked past me to the front door, and I took her spot at the sink, vigorously washing my hands. By the time I finished, she was gone.

I made a pot of coffee and took it with me as I went to look for Tyler. I walked through the whole house, including the basement, with no luck. I walked back to the kitchen, looking out at the half-mowed, half-raked lawn, and something flashed red in the corner of my eye. I paused and looked out the window.

Tyler was still outside in the rain, sitting on the stoop of the backdoor with his face in his hands.

I immediately walked to the door and pulled it open.

"What are you doing? Come inside. It's horrible out here." He stayed there, hunched over. His beanie was plastered to his head, the only covering he wore besides an old T-shirt and boxers. I grabbed his shoulder hard.

"Tyler. Come on." I pleaded. At this point, I knew something was seriously wrong, like he was having some sort of breakdown, and my voice reflected that. He got up slowly, like it hurt to move, and slumped down on the kitchen floor. His hat slid off, and I was horrified to see rivulets of blood running down his neck. His right ear lobe looked like someone had tried to pierce it in the dark.

"What happened to your ear?" I handed him a paper towel roll that he made no move to accept.

He mumbled something into his chest.

"What did you say?" I crouched down, trying to avoid the puddles of blood and dirty water. I took his hand and was shocked at how cold it was. How long had he been out there in only his underwear?

"It's the fairies." His voice was barely a whisper.

"What do you mean 'the fairies'? Do you need to go to the hospital?" I wondered if it was slang for something like PCP or if he was just straight hallucinating altogether.

"It was an accident. You saw that, right?" He asked me, eyes wide and wet with tears, looking ten years younger.

"The car? Or the little village in the yard?" I asked. He looked like he might throw up.

"The fairy." He sobbed. He broke down, telling me what he had seen the day before, the creature that he had seen die. I argued back that it was sad that he had hit an animal, but he was adamant it had been a fairy. The absurdity of it shocked me into silence as we stared at each other, him miserable and me incredulous.

"I think you had a really bad nightmare, Tyler. Did you sleep at all last night?" I finally asked him. He shook his head. A dribble of blood ran down his cheek, and I held a paper towel to it since it seemed like he genuinely wasn't capable of doing it.

I wondered if he had taken something that made him pick at his skin or if he had cut himself somehow yesterday when he tripped.

There was a guilty pang in my stomach. I felt like we were kids again, and I hadn't been watching him when I was babysitting.

"No. They said that I took a life that didn't belong to me, and I need to make it right." The misery in his voice made a chill go down my spine.

"We're talking about fairies, like Aunt Marlie's fairies? Like when we were little?"

He shook his head. "They don't look like that."

He pointed at one of Aunt Marlie's paintings behind me. "Not like- pink and smiling. They look like- I don't know. Like wooden dolls with joints that bend the wrong way. With sharp teeth."

Wooden dolls? Maybe some weird manifestation of his guilt for ruining the Tiny Town?

"How are you supposed to make it right, then?" I asked, trying to keep my voice even. My mind raced. I felt completely inept. I couldn't wait for Aunt Marlie to come home so I could unload the bizarre responsibility of navigating my cousin's nervous breakdown.

"I don't know yet." He seemed to consider the question, cocking his head. "It's hard to understand them. It took me all night to make it out. They sound like- cicadas, I guess. They chirp and hiss. But you can make out the words if you listen long enough."

"And one of them, what, like bit you?" I gestured to his ear. He shook his head, his chin deep in his chest.

"No, it felt more like...like they were putting their hands in my ears. Scraping around inside my head." He reached up to touch the ear that bled. I shook my head and ran my hands through my hair, immediately regretting it as I realized how filthy I had gotten.

"Why don't you go clean up?" I suggested, trying to avoid the topic of fairy brain-stabbing altogether.

For a second, I wondered if I would have to hold his hand like I had the night before, but he pulled himself up, still dripping onto the floor, and made his way out of the kitchen. I grabbed more paper towels and wiped up the puddles of mud and blood on the kitchen floor and then the carpet he had walked on afterward.

I took a shower after that, feeling like I had rolled around in a hospital dumpster. After, I sat on my bed and lost track of time, doing a series of internet searches that made me feel increasingly more insane with each one-

**"side effects overdose seeing fairies"**

**"fairy revenge myths and legends"**

**"what to do when someone sees fairies mental illness"**

I felt a wave of relief at the sound of my aunt's car in the driveway, pulling myself away from my phone screen. I walked quickly down the stairs to the front door, opening it to meet her.

My aunt was standing in the driveway next to her old pick-up, grocery bags dropped to the ground. Her hood had slid off, and rain poured down her face, but she didn't seem to notice. She was staring at the garage door.

It looked like someone had taken my car and rammed it three more times. The door was battered and bent, its panels warped and twisted in a way that made it almost unrecognizable, like scrapped tinfoil. The bumper of my car lay detached entirely, a few feet away from where it should have been. Scratches marred its surface, and streaks of paint from the garage door were scraped across it. The edges were jagged where it had been ripped from the car, and fragments of plastic and bits of headlight glass were scattered around it, glinting in the light.

The garage door and bumper were coated in a green and brown sludgy mess. Rotten food that had been crushed and smeared on it. The remnants of our spoiled Thanksgiving were a viscous, unrecognizable paste that clung to the metal. Beneath the bumper, a trash bag, shredded and flattened, lay sprawled on the driveway.

"What's wrong with you? Seriously. What's wrong with you?" Her eyes were bright and wild. I turned to see Tyler had come to stand behind me in the doorway, this time fully clothed and his hair still damp from the shower. His eyes matched hers- bright, wild, confused.

"I didn't do that." He said. "I swear I didn't. I taped up the bumper yesterday and swept up the glass."

My aunt moved quickly, slipping a little on the wet ground, walking up to us like she was ready to do battle. She grabbed Tyler, pulling him from behind me and to the garage.

"Aunt Marlie, wait-" I tried to intervene. Everything was happening so quickly. She pulled Tyler outside toward the mess of metal and spoiled food. Then she pushed him through the torn gap in the garage door.

"Don't come out until you fix it. Stay in there through Thanksgiving, I don't fucking care. Just fix it." She hissed through her teeth. Tyler held his head in his hands.

"I didn't do this, Mom, I swear."

"Aunt Marlie-" I tried again. "I think-"

"JUST FIX IT, TYLER." My aunt's voice was steel. She grabbed the damp grocery bags and shoved past me into the house.

Tyler was quietly crying in the garage, limned by the sheets of rain that continued to fall. I stayed in the doorway, not knowing what to do next. I was torn between wanting to comfort my cousin and wanting to punch him in the face.

Had Tyler been so mad that he was deliberately fucking with us? Was he just messing with me for the past couple of days? Was he bullshitting me with the fairy stuff, and worse, had I bought it that easily?

As I contemplated, I looked out onto the field next to the house, watching the grass sway. I squinted my eyes, catching something moving in the distance. Long pieces of what looked like duct tape were braided through the edge of the field. They blew in the wind like ribbons. I wondered how they could have gotten so far away from the driveway. I shook my head and turned around.

I had to talk to my aunt.

I found her slumped in the worn plaid armchair in the living room, grocery bags still at her feet. I desperately wanted to give her some privacy, but I couldn't wait any longer. I cleared my throat, and she looked at me with red-rimmed eyes.

"I- well, Tyler's been…" I cleared my throat again. "He's been…seeing things. He told me this morning that he did, anyway. He's been acting really weird since yesterday." She blinked, trying to process what I was saying.

"What do you mean? What has he been seeing?"

"Well, uh. Little creatures." She stared at me, waiting for me to continue.

"Fairies," I continued haltingly. If anyone would believe it, it would be her. She continued to stare at me, her face showing no reaction.

"Is this a joke?" She asked. "I'm really, really not in the mood, Alex."

"No, it's not a joke. I mean, I don't think he was joking. I think he might be…sick." Aunt Marlie reached to the end table next to her and picked up one of her sculptures- a little pixie sitting on a toadstool. She cradled the sculpture in her lap and looked down at it.

"Fairies? That's a little coincidental, don't you think?" She stroked the carved hair and crown with her thumb. "Kind of feels like just another dig at me. Using something I love to hurt me."

I was silent at that. I really couldn't tell. I didn't feel like I knew Tyler well enough to know the answer anymore.

"What kind of person is he?" She asked, her voice small and vulnerable.

"It's just a bad week, Aunt Marlie." I tried to reassure her. I picked up one of the bags.

"I don't know about you, but I'm starving," I said. That was the wrong choice of words.

"I'm sorry, Alex. I haven't fed you, " she said, her eyes welling with tears. She usually kept the house full of comfort food and baked goods.

"It's okay! You can have your chance now." I said, trying to lighten the mood. My aunt gave me a watery smile.

It felt surreal to cook with her again like we had been transported back in time to the day before. The grocery store didn't have all the same ingredients, as it had been cleared out by last-minute Thanksgiving shoppers, but it was enough to put together a nice meal. Aunt Marlie calmed down as she cooked, enough so that I felt comfortable making a suggestion.

"Maybe we could bring a plate to Tyler?" I asked. My aunt sighed and gave a tired half-smile. "See what he's up to with the power tools?" We had heard the telltale buzzing of my uncle's saw about an hour earlier and had given each other a sideways glance. Whatever he was up to, at least he was trying.

"Yeah, I think we could do that." She answered. "Would you mind bringing it in? I'm not ready to talk to him yet."

"I get that. Sure." I said. I could understand why she was simmering. But I also had this twisting feeling in my stomach that made me want to check on him.

I couldn't quite believe it had all been an act. He was immature, but he wasn't that evil.

At least, I hoped he wasn't.

I borrowed my aunt's raincoat, shielding the plate of food as I made my way out to the garage.

Tyler had put a tarp over the hole, and the mess that had once been the rotted food was melting in the rain, dripping down the driveway. I pushed open the tarp, balancing the plate in one hand. I opened my mouth to greet Tyler. It stayed open, jaw dropped, the words dying before I could speak.

The lawnmower was disassembled entirely, its components broken and tossed into a heap. It had been reduced to pieces.

And so had my cousin.

Deep, jagged cuts covered his arms and legs, where he had cut through his limbs. Blood had soaked through his sweatpants and onto the garage's concrete floor, where it had started dripping into the sump pump. His hands were shaking, holding blades larger than I had ever seen. The blades from the mower.

"I understand them now." His lips had been cut, and he had trouble forming the words.

"It had to be an even trade."

Blood dripped down his chin, making the words sound choked.

I couldn't tear my eyes away from him.

From his face. The places where it sagged. Where it fell to the floor.

My ears started ringing, a high-pitched, stuttering drone, as my body flooded with shock.

He said something else I couldn't hear.

He fell to his knees and then onto his stomach, his head hitting the ground hard enough to make it bounce.

I dropped the plate, the shatter echoing behind me as I ran back inside for my aunt.

I don't remember what I said to her, but whatever it was made her immediately call 911 before she even started running to see her son. Before she started screaming.

I ran out after them, my heart beating so hard I felt it in my fingertips. I dimly remember helping my aunt get my cousin into her truck and her panicked tone when she told me to call 911 to tell them to have the ambulance meet them halfway. We were so far away from the hospital that every second counted.

I stayed on the phone with the 911 operator, numbly explaining the backwoods route, waiting until they finally confirmed the ambulance and police escort had spotted the truck and brought my cousin and my aunt to the hospital.

The stupid fucking productivity blocker finally ended from my phone at midnight on the dot. I don't even know where to start with explaining to my friends.

I'm alone.

I tried calling and texting Uncle TJ, but he didn’t answer.

I can't go anywhere without my car, and there's no ride services taking calls this far out because of the storm.

I'm sitting in the living room on the couch, an afghan wrapped tightly around me, wondering if I'm going crazy.

I took a shower, but I still feel Tyler's dried blood under my nails.

And I feel so, so stupid because it's all probably just in his head.

In my head.

But I still filled up all the glasses in the house with milk and left them outside. I put all of the new Thanksgiving food on the doorsteps and window sills, covering them with bowls of potatoes and plates upon plates of vegetables and pies. I dumped honey out in sticky trails until the bottles were empty.

I sprinkled salt everywhere, even though it melted in the rain- because in some of the folklore, they say fucking salt helps.

Because when I think back on what Tyler said last to me before he collapsed, I think I remember it.

***They say it was your fault.***

I'm surrounded by my aunt's art of fairies laughing and smiling, dancing in rainbows, and basking in the sun. But in the corners of my eye, I see their grinning faces twisting and sharpening. I see their bodies splinter with jagged wood and claws slick with rot and gore. My childhood memories feel like they're mocking me.

Outside, I know the night is dark and cold.

I can hear the creaking branches of the apple trees and the whispers of wind blowing through the field.

I can imagine what it looks like, although I'm trying not to because my mind conjures up a thousand pairs of eyes staring back at me through the grass, behind the tree trunks, glaring from behind dead flowers.

But I can't make myself look out the window again to check.

Because the milk is turning red.
