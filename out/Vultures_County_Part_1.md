The tides of fate do not ordain a certainty of events, only that they will come, in whatever shape or size, to bring forth change as destined. Holly stares slack-jawed toward the shoreline, kneading the beach towel between her fingers in nervous anticipation. We are all frozen in place, witnessing the ascension from the waves. No one dares utter a word. Fear paints all of our faces a deep crimson.

At first, it seemed like buoys were surfacing, tethered in rows, stretching along the width of the bay. Once his face broke through the surface, astonishment replaced our fear. Bespeckled and with firm features, his dark-grey pork-pie hat masked the extent of his greying hair. He glided toward the shore in strides displaying a mechanical briskness. The remaining droplets of water fell from the rim of his hat, disappearing back into the ocean. His entire suit remained unsullied; any attempts by the water to cling to his being were firmly rejected by some omnipotent force emanating from his body. In his right hand hung a briefcase, jet black with a golden rim.

He reached the shore around fifty feet to the left of us. The sunlight reflected off the polish on his Chelsea boots. His entire suit was immaculately tailored and pristine, yet unmistakably wrong. It looked stiff and old-fashioned, as if marching out of a time thoroughly alien to us. The sand refused to cling to his shoes. He may have noticed us, but he didn’t break his gaze. The only slowing of his pace was to turn to the stairs, which led him off the beach and onto the embankment.

Our attention was then stolen by the sudden crashing of water. Five, ten, two dozen, four dozen—countless men, all of similar stature, identically and immaculately dressed, began rising from the water, marching in military formation toward us. Each with the same round-rimmed spectacles. Each with the same black and gold briefcase. Each unwavering in their parade toward the shoreline.

We fucking shit ourselves.

Scrambling to our feet, we launch ourselves at the embankment and begin to climb. James is the most agile and reaches the railings first, diving through the bars and sprinting off up the path without a second thought to the rest of us. We scramble frantically at the cold concrete, grazing knees and palms as we make our way over the top. As I reach the path, launching to my feet, I turn to observe the performance unfolding on shore. Countless rows of businessmen are marching towards the embankment. In turn, they file up the stairs with rhythmic cadence in their footsteps.

Without further hesitation, I bolt up the embankment towards town, encountering no obstacles in my frenzy. I remember the first man. Wonder if we’ll catch up to him, or if he’ll ambush us. I don’t give two shits if I see that bespeckled fuck, I’ll deck him. I round the corner and onto the main road. We scatter in different directions as I make my own way to sanctuary. 

Town lies in the same slumber of which I have known my entire life. Lined with staples of high-street malaise – butchers, building societies, and takeaways. The streets lie dormant of their previous high-churning economy. Every other shop is smashed, boarded up, open to let, stripped of their community promise. I pay it no mind; They have all become pieces of home whose familiarity still warms me. I recognise faces dotting the high-street, drawing attention to the emptiness that surrounds them. Creaky, a vagrant with whom I have shared many a chat and a coffee, lies sleeping beneath his sheets outside the local news and booze.

I dart towards ‘Grimsthorpe Best Fish’. An immaculate, if kitsch, little fishmongers to the centre right of the high-street. Inside I find my mother hunched behind the cash register, lording over fine cuts of salmon, haddock, and trout, resting in well-tempered display. I rush behind the counter to her side, wide eyed and mouth agape, struggling to muster a sound. She stares inquisitively and asks what’s wrong. Before I even begin to collect my thoughts, we are interrupted by a soft wrapping at the window.

“Excuse me, ma’am.” His voice is muffled through the glass. My mother steps politely towards the window, breaking my concentration.

“We’re open, you can come in.”

“Oh, I apologise, but I didn’t want to intrude.” He glances down at me beneath his spectacles. Only now do I get a sense of his height. Tall and domineering. Distance hid no imperfections except the age around his eyes. Once the shoreline, now the glass; our final barrier between us is broken as he glides through the doorway and into my mother’s shop. He eyes me with a look of recognition.

“As your boy is probably quite aware, I’m from out of town.” I startle at the acknowledgement of myself and circumstances of his arrival. His gentle smile dismisses my apprehension.

“I’d hate to burden you; I stopped by your shop because I was wondering if it was for sale possibly?”

My mom guffaws involuntarily at the request.

“No, I’m afraid not”, she laughs.

His nose wrinkles in confusion as he pushes his spectacles back up his face.

“I’m sorry?”

“It’s not for sale, love, you’ll have to try somewhere else then.” My mother firmly rebukes and turns on her heels.

“But I’m fully serious. I would like to buy your property, I’d be more than happy to pay a reasonable sum for the purchase and transfer of rights, for your shop, *today*.” The firmness of his tone elevates the seriousness of his proposition. She scans him up and down with piercing judgement. Disgust rises from her stomach at the thought of diminishing our livelihoods to a single request.

“And who the fuck are you then?” She spits with righteous indignation.

“I’m just an inquirer.” He stammers “I-I feel I would have a lot to offer if you would kindly let me explain for a moment.” My mother’s mind is set, but her interest still piqued.

He persists “I have in my possession, a considerable sum of money, which I’m sure will satisfy both yourself and your stakeholders.”

“What do you want with my shop.” She retorts abruptly.

“It’s an investment, I’m here under strict instructions to purchase a retail property in a prime commercial location. It’s not my money – I’m not too concerned to be parting with it quite frankly.” He smiles weakly and lets out a hollow chuckle.

“How much are you offering?” She blankly responds. I shoot my mother a look of concern as her mood shifts from hostility to curiosity.

“How much do you want?”

My mother pauses for a moment, eyeing the surroundings before reaching a figure.

“£150,000”

“I’ll give you £170,000”

“Fuck off, you’re not much of a fucking businessman, are you?”

“I’m not haggling, ma’am” He reassures. “I’m here to buy your retail property at reasonable compensation to yourself, and for the property and rights to be transferred, to my enterprise, today.”

“What will you do with it?”

“Anything I like.” 

The obtuseness of his response startles her into recognising the absurdity of the situation.

“You’re giving me £170,000 for my shop, right now. Where is it? Is it in that briefcase?”

“Yes”

“Show me.”

He leads my mother over to the shop counter and places the briefcase beside the till. Releasing the clasps, the briefcase springs open revealing £50 notes, bound together in neat stacks, each labelled £10,000. Three rows of six, with one absent. My mother scans the contents of the briefcase.

“Exactly £170,000, yeah? What if I asked for more, would you have had that?”

“Yes. Do you want more?”

My mother pauses again, in stunned silence and contemplation. She considers the offer with a gravity not previously afforded to the businessman. Once again assessing the surroundings, her eyes fall and fix themselves upon me.

“I-I mean, my boy’s off to uni soon, and it’s gonna set us back about £20,000 and I’m struggling to pull…”

“Done.”

With resounding finality, briefcase slams shut and the clasps firmly embrace. He waits expectantly for disapproval but doesn't receive any.

“Do we have a room around back where we may finalise our agreement?” The businessman gestures to the doorway at the back of the shop.

“But you haven’t even had a look around the place”

He smirks, bemused, then flails his head and neck in a frenetic scan of the room, torso and lower body remaining motionless.

“I have, and it’s *magnificent*.” He exhales with a wry dryness. “Shall we head around the back, if you wouldn’t mind.”

“I’ll have to call the landlord about transferring the lease…”

He waves his hand in dismissal and offers a thin-lipped smile, “This is mere window dressing. Please, don’t worry, I can assure you that my team and I will take care of this all for us.”

With that, they disappear behind closed doors. The cosmic dread of our first encounter now smothered in the polyester banality of contractual agreement. Without consultation, our worries and fortunes have been forfeited to a man whose name I do not know and whose existence lies beyond my understanding.

Left to my own consideration, I emerge sheepishly from the store as if entering a new dawn. At each shop I pass, another businessman is canvassing a store clerk, making pleasantries with the grocer, or enchanting owners of family-businesses with the contents of their briefcase. Two I spot feverishly pacing about ‘To Let’ signs plastered in shop windows, gripping old brick phones with utmost concentration. Others bang ceaselessly at the broken glass of derelict properties, demanding attention from whomever resides. At the end of the street, I see bar staff boarding up windows of the local pub, overseen by the manager and its newly-ordained owner. Change has swallowed a town which never previously knew the word, only ever acquainted with its antithesis, decay.
