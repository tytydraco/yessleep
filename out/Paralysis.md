 

Brooke immediately felt something was off when she woke up. Her eyes sprung wide open, and she grabbed for her phone. It was too bright out for her alarm not to have gone off. The sun was already starting to shine through her apartment window and the birds were chirping outside. Looking down at her phone confirmed the panic that was settling in. The screen read 8:37 AM she had overslept. She had no idea why her alarm didn’t go off this morning and didn’t have any time to figure that out. If she didn’t get ready and out the door now, she was going to miss her flight.

 

Moving in a frenzy she swished around mouthwash throwing on a navy pants suit. Spitting back out the mouthwash she put her auburn hair up into a messy bun. She had planned on styling it this morning to look good for her big presentation, but this would have to do for now. Maybe she would get a chance to clean it up later. Sprinting out of her apartment she grabbed the suitcase waiting for her by the front door. She was glad she had packed the night before. 

 

Outside of her apartment building she stood on the sidewalk waving her arm to hail a cab. With every passing minute she became more impatient, certain that she was going to miss her flight. A cab finally puttered up to stop in front of her. Still moving in a hurry, she chucked her suitcase in the trunk and told the driver to get her to the airport as quickly as possible. The old man driving the cab looked back at her smiling warmly, “You got it”. Looking at the old added another worry to her rapidly growing list. Could the old driver even get her to the airport?

 

The cab puttered out in traffic making its way to the airport. Brooke impatiently tapped her fingers on the armrest as they came to a stop in traffic. Her mind started to wander thinking about what would happen if she missed her flight. Would someone else take over the presentation she had spent months preparing? She began to tap faster and harder as frustration overtook her. “Can you go any faster? I'm in a hurry and can’t miss my flight”, She snapped at the cab driver. “You got it” the cab driver responded politely, moving over a lane. Cars honked as they raced by the slow-moving cab. Brooke rubbed the bridge of her nose in exasperation.

 

The airport came into view as the cab pulled into the long line to drop off passengers, but Brooke decided she couldn’t wait anymore. She tossed money up to the cab driver shouting back to keep the change as she got out of the car. Pulling her suitcase out of the truck, she weaved through traffic running towards the airport. Drivers honked and shouted as she cut them off, but it didn’t concern her. She was laser focused on making it to her flight.

 

Inside the airport the line for security was no better. Hundreds of people stood shoulder to shoulder waiting to get through. She shuffled past as much of the line as she could, jumping in towards the front of the line. With her eyes welling up she pleaded with the people ahead of her to let her pass. To her own surprise the people let her by going right through security. For a moment she had the devious idea that she could do this more often and save time on her trips.

 

Making her way through security was quick, but she still had no time to spare. She took her suitcase off the security line, dropping it to the ground with a thud. Hearing a loud crack, she stopped to check her suitcase. The short drop had snapped off one of the suitcase wheels. Time was already running out. Frantically she picked up her bag, trying to run to her gate at the opposite end of the terminal. The gate attendant looked concerned seeing her run up to the gate. Hesitantly the attendant stepped out in front to stop her. “I’m sorry ma’am the flight has already taken off.”

 

Exasperated, she took a seat nearby to sulk. After all her efforts she still ended up missing her flight. The next flight wouldn't be for another six hours and there was no way she would make her presentation. This presentation was supposed to be her big shot showing her boss she was ready for the next promotion. Instead, it would show she was unreliable and unprepared.  She wasn’t ready for it to end that way. Her mind raced, scrambling for an idea she Then it hit her.

 

Brooke pulled out her phone while making reservations at an extravagant sushi restaurant. With the reservation confirmed she came up with the best excuse she could. She called her clients and explained it would be a shame if they couldn't take in the local food and sights. Passing over the reservation she encouraged them to take the day to explore and relax so that they could meet the next morning refreshed and ready to talk business. When she had offered to pick up the tab they couldn’t resist and agreed. With that problem out of the way she just had to get there. 

 

She wished the rest of her trip would go as easily as that call. Instead, it was haunted by issues and delays. When Brooke finally got on the next flight hours later the plane sat on the runway in need of last-minute remains. Normally she would have just gotten off the flight, but she waited worried there might not be another flight out today. While the flight was uneventful trouble picked back up as soon as she landed. Getting to the rental car she was greeted with a check engine light. Not wanting to test her already dreadful luck she had to return to the counter and wait for another car. By the time she got that sorted out and pulled out of the airport a torrential downpour started bringing traffic to a crawl. Pressing on, she drove through the storm making her way to the hotel. After the flight and drive she was exhausted by the time she arrived. None of the day had gone how she imagined, and she was ready for it to be over. It was midnight and she could think about now collapsing into bed.

 

The receptionist greeted her as she walked in the door, “Checking in?” Yes, Brooke responded, mustering a faint smile. Clacking away on the keyboard the receptionist looked up her reservation. He looked back with concern, “There seems to have been a problem with your room reservation, but not to worry we still have plenty of spare rooms for the night.” He placed a key labeled 217 on the counter sliding it across to Brooke.

 

Picking up the key she headed straight for her room ignoring the receptionist spiel about the hotel. In a daze she walked down the hallway heading to her room ready to relax. She opened the door to her room and noticed there was only one bed. She reserved two and always preferred an extra to lay her luggage and clothes out on. Tonight, she was too tired to go back and argue with the receptionist. Tomorrow she would go down and ask to change rooms before breakfast.

 

Leaving her suitcase propped against the open door she started to go through her standard hotel check. She walked over to the bed leaning down to check under, making sure there was no one or nothing under it. After her quick glance she went over to the window pulling the curtains closed and making sure nothing was hidden there either. Going back to her suitcase she took out her toiletries to place in the bathroom and double checked that there was nothing in the bathtub. Satisfied that she was alone she took a tissue from the bathroom, closed the door, and stuffed the tissue in the peephole. She locked the door shut behind her, sliding the lock chain into place. Feeling too tired to unpack, tonight she set her suitcase out on the chair in the room.

 

In the bathroom she brushed her teeth to get ready for bed. Out of habit she pulled out a wipe to remove her make up realizing she had been in such a hurry and flustered today she never got around to applying any. With a big yawn she went back into the bedroom, settling into the king-size bed to go to sleep. The hotel was dark and quiet; only the faint hum from the AC broke the silence. Even as tired as she felt Brooke couldn’t seem to fall asleep. Something nagged at her in the back of her mind as if she had forgotten something. She worried about her looming presentation lying in bed.

 

Minutes turned into hours as she laid in bed tired but unable to fall asleep. Finally, as she started to nod off, she heard a noise. A soft scraping and sliding of a wooden drawer opening. Her eyes barely opened as she glanced around for the source of the noise. At the foot of the bed one of the small dresser drawers had rolled open on its own. She let her eyes start to drift back shut until she heard a snap. It sounded like a bone being broken and her eyes shot wide open.

 

At the end of the bed, she saw a thin gray arm reaching up out of the dresser drawer clutching the handle. The shock brought her fully awake. She went to scream but couldn’t open her mouth. Despite her efforts she couldn’t move any part of her body except her eyes. Her eyes screamed, looking around the room hoping for some help to come bursting through the door to help. The snapping continued, bringing her attention back to the end of the bed. A bald gray head began to creep up out of the drawer. The head was slightly wrinkled but almost completely featureless. Where she expected to see eyes were two sunken in black holes.

 

The body continued to unpack itself from the drawer, its limbs snapping as if they had been folded and compressed in. Brooke closed her eyes tightly, telling herself that this was just a bad dream brought on by stress. Closing her eyes couldn’t keep her from hearing the rest of the hideous snapping.  When she opened her eyes, the gray figure was standing outside of the drawer. The six-foot-tall figure was completely gray and naked. At first, she thought it was a man, but as she glazed down all she saw was a smooth body. Closing her eyes again she told herself this isn't happening, this isn't real. 

 

Breaking out in a sweat, Brooke opened her eyes to see the empty draw at the foot of the bed. She started to relax until out of the corner of her eye a gray blob came into focus. Looking over it was now standing next to her looking down at the bed. Her heart raced as she was still paralyzed, unable to move or even scream.  It leaned down over the bed, coming more into focus. Up close the figure looked emaciated and frail. The closer it leaned in its face the more blurred its features seemed to become. A black hole opened forming where its mouth should have been as it began to make a labored inhaling sound. Unable to move, Brooke began to sweat even profusely. Her heart and breathing rapidly speed up. She thought her heart might explode from the pounding in her chest.

 

After what felt like minutes the hole on the figure's face closed up. It slowly began to drift backwards at an uneven pace towards the dresser drawer. The figure stepped back into the drawer unleashing a torrent of cracking sound. Its limbs and body folded back up retreating into the dresser drawer. With care slowly the figure’s sinewy gray arm reached out giving the drawer a push back inward as it retreated. The drawer clicked back shut back into place. Brooke's eyes stayed locked on the drawer waiting for it to come back out. She couldn’t tell if she was still paralyzed or simply too afraid to move.

 

The alarm on her phone went off promptly at 7:30 the next morning. She snapped awake startled not realizing when she had dozed off the night before. Turning the alarm off she looked at her phone confused. Last night she hadn’t even remembered setting the alarm. She wondered if she had set her airport alarm for the wrong day. That chain of thought was quickly interrupted when she looked over at the dresser at the foot of the bed. A sense of dread washed over her as she remembered the events from last night.

 

Her heart began to pound all over again. Moving at a snail's pace she slid out of bed trying not to make a sound. She tiptoed through the room moving to get her suitcase and get out as quickly as possible. As she moved, she never took her eyes off the dresser. Feeling around she found her suitcase and her clothes flung over the chair from the night before.  She put her clothes from yesterday back on not wanting to unpack or spend another second in the room.

 

Placing her suitcase on the ground, she had forgotten about the damaged wheel. In a daze she dragged the bag across the floor cutting through the silence of the hotel with an eerie scrapping. Brooke ignored the scraping sound all she could focus on was the dresser and the sound of her pounding heart again.

 

She took a deep breath beginning to tremble as she crossed by the dresser. For a moment she paused right in front of the drawer that the figure had climbed out of. Her eyes locked on it as her quivering hand reached out. Something in her mind stopped her hand inches away from the drawer.  She pulled her hand back, backing away towards the door. Unlocked the door, she clumsily felt around with her hand finding the lock and latch. Her toiletries were still in the bathroom, but she quickly decided it was all replaceable.

 

Opening the door, she backed out into the hall letting the door fall shut in front of her. She shuddered as the door closed. Looking down the hallway she couldn’t wait any longer to put this place behind her.  Almost breaking out into a run she walked as quickly as she could to the elevator. By the time the elevator reached the first floor her heart had slowed back down. She was feeling calmer, but not enough to spend one more second than she needed in the building. Dropping the room key on the counter at the front desk she said bluntly, “I’ll be checking out now.”
