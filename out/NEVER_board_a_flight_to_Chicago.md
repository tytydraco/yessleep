I should’ve known something was wrong the second the lights went out.

One minute, the airport was humming with the usual noise — the static of intercom announcements, the rhythmic clatter of luggage wheels, tired conversations drifting through the stale air. The next, everything cut to black. Utter, suffocating black.

The silence that followed wasn’t normal.

It wasn’t the confused silence of people waiting for the backup generators. It wasn’t the awkward shuffle of passengers inconvenienced by a technical glitch.

It was dead silence. Like the entire building exhaled and forgot how to breathe.

I stood near Gate 12, gripping my backpack so tight my knuckles went white. Phones died across the terminal. Screens flickered, then went blank. Even the dim glow from vending machines snuffed out like someone had pulled the plug on the whole place.

A few people muttered. Some laughed nervously. I didn’t.

The emergency lights never came on.

We waited.

Minutes crawled by like hours. Parents tried to comfort their kids. A businessman near me smacked his dead phone against his palm. Someone joked about the apocalypse.

But it didn’t feel funny. It felt… wrong.

Eventually, faint emergency lights sputtered to life. They didn’t make me feel better. They were weak, flickering, casting strange shadows across the terminal walls.

I told myself I was being paranoid. I told myself it was just a blackout.

But paranoia is better than being blind, so I kept my guard up.

And then I made my first mistake.

The pressure in my bladder had been building for a while. I held it as long as I could, but with the lights back on — sort of — I decided to risk it.

The bathroom was down a side hallway, away from the crowd. As I approached, I noticed how quiet it was down there. The hum of voices and footsteps from the main terminal faded away.

The men’s room door creaked as I pushed it open.

Dim yellow light buzzed overhead. The air inside was stale and cold. The tiles were grimy, the mirror above the sink cracked. A puddle of dark water seeped along the floor.

I should’ve walked away.

Instead, I stepped inside.

The door slammed shut behind me — hard, like it was yanked closed by something on the other side.

Before I could react, pain exploded in my hand. Something heavy smashed down across my fingers, pinning them to the edge of the sink with a sickening crunch.

I screamed, yanking my hand back.

Three of my fingers bent at impossible angles. Blood welled up around my nails. I staggered back, cradling my injured hand, heart thundering in my chest.

And then I saw it.

A shadow in the corner of the room — impossibly tall, limbs too long, head tilted unnaturally to the side. Its outline was… off. Wrong angles. Stretched proportions. No face that I could see, just… darkness where its head should’ve been.

It didn’t move.

Neither did I.

Cold dread knotted in my gut.

I backed toward the door, forcing my legs to work.

The thing didn’t follow.

I slammed back into the terminal, eyes wide, breathing ragged. My hand throbbed with pain, blood trickling down my wrist. But I was alive.

For now.

That’s when the screens flickered back to life.

I expected flight schedules. Delays. Apologies from the airline.

Instead, every screen — departure boards, kiosks, even the tiny monitors by the gates — glowed with the same blood-red text:

1. Do not enter the washrooms.
2. Anyone smiling is already dead. Stay away.
3. Don’t interact with the workers. Don’t let them discover you.
4. Do not close your eyes for more than 5 seconds.
5. If you see the crying boy in the blue shirt, run.
6. NEVER board a flight to Chicago.
7. You are ALONE. No one is like you here.

At first, I thought it was a prank. Some hacker screwing with the airport systems. But as I looked around… the bottom dropped out of my stomach.

The people… weren’t right.

Their smiles — stretched too wide, unnaturally wide, flesh pulled tight over bone. Their mouths looked ready to split open. Their eyes were glassy, distant, empty.

And their heads… tilted side to side. Back and forth. Slow. Unblinking. Repetitive.

Like metronomes keeping a twisted rhythm.

I stood frozen, watching them.

A woman with a baby stroller drifted past me. The baby was smiling too — the same grotesque grin, lips pulled ear to ear, head tilting rhythmically like everyone else.

A businessman near the windows grinned wider and wider, his neck bending at an impossible angle as his head swayed side to side.

It wasn’t natural.

It wasn’t human.

And no one else seemed to notice.

I ducked behind a row of seats, my injured hand pulsing with pain. My eyes scanned the terminal, heart racing. The workers in their bright uniforms moved stiffly, faces expressionless, eyes vacant.

The rules burned in my mind:
Don’t interact with the workers. Don’t let them discover you.

I stayed low, slipping behind pillars, dodging past unmoving, grinning passengers.

I needed to get out.

I found the main entrance — or where it should’ve been.

But there were no doors. No windows. Just endless, smooth, sterile wall stretching out in every direction. I ran along the length of the terminal, searching, pounding on the walls.

Nothing. Solid. Cold.

The only way out was through the gates.

Every flight?
Chicago.
Gate 6: Chicago.
Gate 11: Chicago.
Gate 27: Chicago.

The list went on. Different gates, same destination.

My head spun. My mouth went dry.

Chicago wasn’t the way out.

It was a trap.

The rules said so:
NEVER board a flight to Chicago.

And that last rule…
You are ALONE. No one is like you here.

I believed it. Until I heard the crying.

Soft, desperate sobs, carrying faintly over the low hum of the terminal.

I turned, scanning the crowd.

By Gate 14, a little boy stood alone. Blue shirt. Head down. Tears streaming down his cheeks.

My chest tightened.

Rule 5.
If you see the crying boy in the blue shirt, run.

His head lifted. His eyes — wide, dark, hollow — met mine.

I didn’t think.

I ran.

Pushing past the grinning passengers, past the gliding workers, deeper into the endless terminal. I didn’t stop. My lungs burned, my legs ached, but I kept going.

Because now I knew — this place wasn’t broken.

It wasn’t malfunctioning.

It was hunting.

And the only thing worse than the monsters was the thought that I might be trapped here forever.

The lights flickered. The terminal stretched on. The walls closed in.

And the boy’s cries still echoed behind me.

I kept running.

The terminal stretched on endlessly, impossibly. My lungs burned, my injured hand throbbed, but I couldn’t stop. Gate numbers flashed by—higher, higher, climbing beyond reason.

Gate 47.
Gate 63.
Gate 82.
Gate 97.
Gate 102.

It didn’t make sense. Airports don’t work like that. They’re big, sure, but not infinite. The gates just kept coming, hallway after hallway, no doors, no windows, just blank white walls and endless, sterile carpet.

And every flight?
Chicago.
Chicago.
Chicago.

It pulsed through the overhead speakers now, distorted voices announcing flights to Chicago every few minutes like some broken recording on loop. My head pounded. The walls seemed to close in. The flickering overhead lights made everything look washed out and dead.

I stumbled around a corner, nearly slamming into him.

A guy. Maybe late twenties. Tall, thin, skin pale and clammy like he hadn’t seen sunlight in weeks. His eyes were bloodshot, wild. He looked like he’d been running too.

But he wasn’t smiling.
His head wasn’t tilting.
His face wasn’t… wrong.

For the first time since this nightmare started, I saw someone real.

He flinched at the sight of me, but the moment his eyes landed on my hoodie, his expression cracked with relief. He grabbed me, pulling me behind a support pillar like we were fugitives.

“Holy shit,” he breathed, voice raspy. “You—you’re the guy.”

I shoved him off, chest heaving. “What the hell are you talking about?”

“The hoodie,” he gasped, holding up a flickering, half-dead phone. “My first rule. Find the man in the gray hoodie before he dies.”

The screen was glitching, but I could still read the faint red text burned across it:

1. Find the man in the gray hoodie before he dies.
2. Stay awake.
3. Rule 5 is a lie.

My brain lagged trying to process. “Wait… you have rules?”

His eyes darted across my face, panicked. “Yeah. I’ve been looking for you. Days, maybe. I—Jesus.” His gaze dropped to my hand, and his face twisted in horror. “Your fingers… what the fuck happened to your hand?”

I glanced down. The mangled, swollen mess of my fingers looked worse under the flickering emergency lights. The skin was purple, split. Blood crusted along my wrist.

“The bathroom,” I muttered, swallowing bile. “First rule on my list… don’t go to the washrooms. I… I didn’t know yet.”

His face drained of color. “You went in the bathroom?”

I nodded. “Didn’t end well.”

“Fuck…” He wiped his face, pacing in place. His clothes clung to him with sweat, his eyes bloodshot and sunken. “I’ve been trying to stay awake. That’s my second rule. Stay awake. But I can’t… I can’t do this anymore.”

I tried to steady my breathing. “You… don’t know my rules?”

He shook his head. “Your rules? What—no. I just got mine when the lights came back on. Three of them.”

I thought of the list burned into my brain: seven rules, endless warnings, everything spiraling out of control.

Seven for me.
Three for him.

“They’re different,” I muttered. “They’re different for everyone.”

His eyes widened, realization dawning in his exhausted face. “Shit… that’s why this place is such a fucking maze.”

He staggered, leaning against the pillar for support, his skin waxy and pale. His eyelids drooped, fluttering shut for a second before he jolted awake.

“You can’t sleep,” I warned him. “Trust me.”

“I know,” he mumbled, voice frayed with exhaustion. “Second rule… stay awake… but I can’t keep this up. I almost… almost got out, I think.”

“What do you mean?”

His jaw clenched, eyes unfocused. “There was a flight. A gate, way down the hall. Chicago, of course. But… it looked normal. There were people boarding. No grins. No head tilting. Just… people.”

My stomach twisted. “You almost boarded?”

He nodded slowly. “I got to the door. Handed them my ticket. But right before I stepped onto the jet bridge, I looked back.”

He paused, shivering.

“What did you see?” I asked.

His voice dropped to a whisper. “They weren’t real. The people… their skin… it was peeling. Their eyes were wrong. Hollow. But they were smiling. Not the ear-to-ear, stretched nightmare smiles… just… normal ones. But it wasn’t right. They weren’t right.”

I exhaled shakily. “What did you do?”

“I ran,” he said simply. “Didn’t look back. Been walking circles ever since, searching for you.”

The overhead speakers crackled. Another distorted announcement echoed through the terminal: “Final boarding call… Chicago… all passengers proceed…”

It sounded more like a threat than an instruction.

I clenched my fists, ignoring the searing pain in my mangled hand. “Listen. You can’t sleep. You can’t board. You can’t trust anything.”

His knees buckled slightly, and he slid down the pillar, curling up on the floor. “I just need… five minutes,” he slurred. “Five minutes… watch over me, okay?”

Panic surged in my chest. “Don’t—seriously, don’t.”

He waved me off weakly. “You’re here now… I found you… five minutes…”

His eyes drifted shut.

I froze, breath caught in my throat.

The rules screamed in my skull.

Do not close your eyes for more than 5 seconds.

I counted, helpless.

One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.

His body twitched violently.

His head snapped to the side with a sickening crack.

His mouth peeled back into a grotesque, impossible grin—ear to ear, splitting his cheeks unnaturally wide. His eyelids lifted, glassy and vacant, head tilting… side to side… side to side… endlessly.

Gone.

The realization hit me like ice water.

I snatched up his flickering phone, my hands trembling.

The screen still displayed his three rules:

1. Find the man in the gray hoodie before he dies.
2. Stay awake.
3. Rule 5 is a lie.

I stared, heart pounding.

Rule 5 is a lie.

My Rule 5.

If you see the crying boy in the blue shirt, run.

The boy by Gate 14. Crying, small, lost. I ran like the rules told me.

But if Rule 5 is a lie…
I wasn’t supposed to run.
I was supposed to find him.

The boy might be the key.
Or the trap.
But what other choice do I have?

My phone’s dead. The guy’s phone barely works. But this app—this forum—still loads.

I’m typing this now, through his phone, praying someone reads it.

If you’ve been here… if you know how to get out… tell me.

I’m going to find the boy.

Before it’s too late.
