My handler escorted me in, making sure I didn’t turn around. 

He didn't need to watch me like that. Like a hawk. I wasn’t going to run away. I knew what I needed to do. I just wanted to get this whole thing over and done with as quickly as possible. But there was a clock I had to respect. I had to wait until noon. If I left a minute before twelve o’clock, I risked my release. I wasn’t about to do that. I needed to get free, no matter what it took. 

My handler told me I had to go mingle, “chat with people”. 

“*Really?!*” I asked. I wanted to shout at him but I kept my tone as controlled as I could.

“Really,” he confirmed sternly. “Go.”

I loathed him with ever fibre of my being, but I wasn’t going to show him that. I knew it wasn’t just him watching my every move. I couldn’t see any cameras, but I knew they were watching. I had been instructed to follow this man’s orders, so I would.

I walked into the party hall. It was decorated with colourful birthday balloons and streamers. A big banner saying “Happy Birthday 90th Birthday Nolan!” hung over the crowd. The place was packed with people. I felt immediately claustrophobic amongst the happy throng. 

I squeezed my way through the partiers towards the side of the hall. 

The wall was plastered with photos of what I assumed was Nolan growing up. Him as a cheeky faced baby, a gap-toothed toddler, playing on the swings with his sister, him as a Lion a school play (the Wizard of Oz), holidays and birthdays spanning the years, travelling with his family to Australia, South America, Paris, graduating high school, graduating college, proposing to a young woman…

I looked away from the photos. I didn’t want to see any more. I think I knew he was married. Someone must’ve had told me that but I guess I had shoved that information out of my mind until now.

“We were so young, weren’t we?” An old woman grasped my elbow, looking up at me with a smile. She had been watching me look at the photos. Nolan’s wife, I guessed. I really didn’t want to talk to her, but my eyes flicked to my handler and his sharp gaze told me I should. 

“Yeah, it’s a really great photo,” I said. 

“We haven’t met, I don’t think? I’m Maria,” she said, offering her hand. 

I gave it a quick shake. 

“Eli,” I said. The fake name I used for coffee orders and trivial online subscriptions had popped out of me before I could really think about it. I looked back to my handler. Did it matter if I used that name here? I couldn’t read his expression.

“Eli, nice to meet you,” Maria said warmly. "So how do you know Nolan?”

“Umm… we met a while back,” I told her. I didn’t want to confess I didn’t know him at all. It felt rude to say at his party. 

“Make sure you get some cake, honey,” she told me. “We ordered Nolan’s favourite, lemon with lemon curd filling. I hope you like lemon!” 

I nodded. “It’s my favourite too,” I said. That wasn’t a lie.

I used the excuse Maria gave me to part ways and head to the cake table. I took a plate and piece of cake and started eating. I kept my eyes on the cake. I wanted to avoid seeing Nolan in person for as long as I could manage it. 

A young boy joined me at the cake table.

“I’ve already had a piece but don’t tell my mum, ok?” He whispered at me. “I’m having another because it’s so good and Grandpa says I can have as much as I want because it’s his birthday and his rules!” 

I nodded in agreement. He grinned at me before scampering off with his new, very large, piece of cake. His boldness reminded me of me at that age. It made me smile. 

I watched as he ran to show off his cake to his Grandpa. 

Nolan. 

There he was. 

He was older here than he had gotten in our timeline. There, his life ended at twenty eight years old, that’s what they told me. This timeline wasn’t supposed to exist. This old man I was looking at wasn't supposed to exist and it was my responsibility to eliminate him.

It had felt straight forward enough when they explained my duty to me earlier. But now, actually seeing the old man in person, I felt my limbs go tingly and my head start to swim. I knew I had to do it though, so I shook my head and peeled my eyes away from Nolan, instead looking to the large clock on the wall. 

I had to wait until after the clock had struck noon to kill him. I didn’t know why, but those were my orders, and I had to obey them. They told me that completing this task of theirs could set me free. I felt the weight of the handgun in my jacket pocket. Somehow, it felt heavier than it had when I had first placed it there.

“Don’t let yourself care,” I told myself silently. “You don’t know him. Besides, he’s already dead. Don’t let yourself care.” 

That’s when the speeches started. Maria made a loving toast to her husband of fifty-two years. Nolan’s children, two daughters and a son, spoke of their wonderful childhoods. They talked about how much they loved their their Dad and how hard he had worked all their lives and how he supported them endlessly… Nolan made a speech too. About how proud he was of his family. Looking back on eighty years, he said though there were tough times, he wouldn’t’ve changed a thing. He really couldn’t have wished for a better life. 

I didn’t want to hear all this. I had tried to focus on counting balloons instead of listening, but the words found me anyway. 

I don’t know what I would’ve rather heard… That his life was terrible and it should’ve ended long ago? But no, he seemed genuinely happy. And that made me feel sick. I felt my hands start to tremble as I gathered courage for what I was there to do. I looked to the clock. It was almost noon. I let my hand grasp the handgun in my pocket. 

“He’s already dead,” I reminded myself. “Don’t let yourself care. You can be free.”

But I felt myself freeze. I couldn’t pull out the gun. 

Then I felt a firm hand grasp my shoulder. 

“Come with me,” my handler told me. 

“Why?!” I asked, confused, as he escorted me away from Nolan. 

I was furious. All I needed was to wait until the second hand clock ticked past twelve and - *Bang!* \- I’d be done! I watched as the second hand ticked closer and closer to the top of the clock as I was ushered through the crowd by my handler. 

He pulled me out of the hall and into the front lobby. It was empty except for us. Silent.

“We told you it was your responsibility to eliminate Nolan Winters from this timeline,” he said.

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “But I had to wait until past noon. Until now! Why’d you drag me out here? Can't I just get on with it?!”

“You looked like you were having trouble,” he said. I could tell he was trying to read me for weakness. “We know it’s a lot to face… taking a life.” 

I steeled my face. “He’s already dead.” I said flatly. “It’s no big deal.” 

“You’ll do it, then?” He asked. 

I pulled the gun from my pocket. It felt so so heavy. Like it was going to drop from my hand. I kept a tight clutch on it, my knuckles white.  

“Ok,” my handler said, still obviously trying to read me. “I’ll let you go back in. But there’s something else we are going to ask of you,” he continued. “We weren’t fully transparent about your task earlier… Now, I will remind you that how you proceed is your choice. You always have a choice.”

“Do I?” I asked. “If I really had a choice, I’d walk out those doors and go home right now. But you’re not going to let me do that, are you?”

“You’re right, I won’t. You’re not ready,” he said.

“Ok, so what else is it you need me to do?” I asked. “Just let me know, and I’ll do it. I just want to go home!”

My handler just stared at me, expressionless for a moment. Then he pushed a folder into my hands. 

“It’s not just Nolan you are responsible for eliminating,” he told me. 

“What?!” I said.

“Open it,” he insisted. 

I did. Inside were photos and names of hundreds of people. They were faces I recognized from the party. Young and old. Nolan’s little grandson was among them. And his wife.

“You must eliminate them all,” my handler told me. 

I felt my heart drop into my stomach. 

“What?” I said, now barely managing to expel a whisper.

“If Nolan had died young, as he did in our timeline, these people wouldn’t exist,” he said. “There is an expansive tree that would’ve grown from his continued life. It is your responsibility to cut down every branch of that tree now. You must eliminate everyone in that hall.”

I couldn’t speak. My eyes were glued to the file. 

“Do you understand?” My handler continued: “With Nolan dead, Maria, would not have survived her severest episode of depression. She wouldn’t’ve lived to be there to save their neighbour when he slipped in the pool. He never would never have gone on to have his own children. Nolan and Maria’s children wouldn’t exist. They never would’ve grown up to be the surgeons and mental health workers they became. The lives they saved over-

“Stop,” I blurted out, “please.” I realized I was shaking uncontrollably. I couldn’t help it. Nothing I could do would make it stop. My face was wet. Tears were streaming down my face. 

“I can’t,” I told him. “I can’t just kill all these people.”

“But you already did,” he said. “In our timeline. When you killed Nolan.” 

“I didn’t mean to kill him, though!” I yelled. “It was an accident! A stupid accident. I drove when I shouldn’t’ve. That’s it! I’m not a murderer. I shouldn’t be here! I shouldn’t have to do this! I just want to go home! This game you’re playing, it’s sick!”

I felt my handler remove the handgun from my hand. Then replace it with a semi-automatic rifle. 

“This is not a game.” he told me. “You are responsible for these lives. Now, are you going to do it? Are you going to accept your responsibility?!”

I felt the rifle drop from my hands, heard it clatter to the floor. 

“No, I don’t want to do this,” I wept. “Just let me go!” 

“You must complete your trial,” my handler said.

I kicked the rifle away from me. 

“If you don’t eliminate them,” my handler said, “we will.”

Suddenly, what looked like a heavily armed SWAT team burst into the lobby from outside. They moved swiftly past me, through the lobby, and towards the party hall. 

“Wait,” I shouted, “no!”

I ran after them, desperately trying to pull them back. But they shook me off effortlessly. 

“No, please,” I begged, I sobbed, “Don’t hurt them!” 

But they didn’t listen to me. *BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-*

I watched in horror as partiers dropped to the floor, dead, blood pooling around them. People screamed and ran, only to be shot down, their blood spraying across the room. Across me. 

I saw Nolan and Maria, clutching each other close, then- BANG-BANG- they fell too. 

Nolan’s little grandson wailed. I tried to get in front of him, but- BANG- he fell too. 

It was all over so quickly. The shooters, having done their job, marched out of the hall. I was left alone, drenched in the blood of the dead. All I could do was sob. 

I was still sobbing  when the glasses were unlocked from my face. The hall disappeared and I was in prison again. I was no longer covered in blood, just drenched in my own sweat. 

The trial was over, I was informed. I knew I had failed, I knew I wasn’t going home anytime soon now, but I didn’t care. All I could do is sob. Sob for Nolan, his family, all of those people… They didn’t deserve that. I felt waves upon waves of grief for them. And fury too. Fury that I had just let it all happen. Somehow, somehow, I should’ve been able to stop it. *Why couldn’t I have stopped it!?*

My mind went to when Nolan died. Not when he was ninety, but when he was twenty-eight. I hadn’t even seen who I had hit. I was so drunk. I remember the smashed car. That’s it. And I remember looking away. I didn’t want to see who the paramedics had pulled from the wreckage. It was all a stupid mistake, that's all I could think about. That’s all I could focus on. One stupid mistake that was going to ruin my life. My life. That was all I could think of then. 

I heard someone speaking to me. The prison officer who had removed my glasses. She spoke to me again. I tried my best to listen. To focus on her words.  

“Did you hear me?” she asked. 

I shook my head. 

“I said, you passed,” she told me.
