I don't know how long it had been going on, but, last week, I noticed something unsettling. A crow watching me from the shadows of a tree, its presence struck me like a knife. At first, I only spotted it because of its eyes... piercing faintly in the dark. It was hidden so perfectly among the branches, cloaked in shadow, that even after noticing it, I doubted myself. Was it really a crow? Its feathers weren’t just black; they were very dark. The darkest black I’ve ever seen on a living thing.

It didn’t move, didn’t caw, didn’t flinch not even when I shouted, clapped, or waved my arms. It was deathly silent. Its eyes were locked onto mine, cold and unblinking. I stood there, unnerved, trying to shake the feeling that those eyes weren't normal... they looked dead. I couldn’t take it anymore. Retreating into the house, I closed the door behind me and forced myself to forget about it.

But that night, the crow followed me into my dreams. I don’t remember much about the dream itself only that I was going about something boring, and yet, somewhere in the periphery, that same crow was watching me. I noticed it accidently. When I finally locked eyes with it in the dream, I woke up, gasping for breath, my heart pounding. I tried to brush it off as just a nightmare, but the feeling stayed with me.

Yesterday, I saw it again. I was miles away from home, walking through a quiet part of town, when I looked up at the sound of a helicopter passing overhead. That’s when I saw it.. a crow perched on the brittle, lifeless branches of a dead tree. It was behind me, hidden, as if it had been trailing me unnoticed. Its eyes bored into me, the same unrelenting stare as before. My stomach churned, but I told myself it couldn’t possibly be the same crow. It had to be a coincidence, didn’t it? Crows are everywhere.

I left quickly, trying to shake the uneasiness. For the rest of the day, I couldn’t stop glancing over my shoulder.

That night, I visited my father at the old family house on the outskirts of town. My mother passed away recently, so I’d been coming by to check on him. The house always felt hollow without her, but that night, it was weirdly quiet. Around midnight, as I was drifting to sleep, I heard a faint, scratching sound at the window. It was subtle at first, like something brushing against the glass. My chest tightened as I crept toward the window, pulling the curtain aside. Nothing was there... just the faint glow of the moonlight filtering through the trees. But on the windowsill lay a single black feather.

My hands trembled as I scanned the garden below and the tree tops, but there was no movement, no sign of anything... or anyone. Still, the uneasiness lingered, clawing at my mind like a dull blade.

I stayed awake, staring at the ceiling, until exhaustion finally overtook me.

Then, at 2 a.m., I woke to the sound of a voice. It was my mother’s voice... soft and familiar at first, calling to me the way she used to when I was a child. But as I listened, something about it changed. It wasn’t quite her voice anymore. It grew strained, distorted, taking on a mocking, almost playful edge. The words became garbled, impossible to understand, until all that remained was an unsettling cadence.

And then came the death scream.

It was a scream like no other... a wail of agony and despair that pierced the night and rooted me to the bed. The blood drained from my face as I realized it sounded just like her. Exactly like her. My body froze, the air around me cold and still.

I forced myself to move, stumbling to the window. My hands trembled as I peeled back the curtain. The garden below was silent, bathed in a pale, silvery light. But the moon was strange—tinged with a very light red, but it looked sinister. My eyes scanned the tree line, hoping that I don't find anything.

That’s when I saw it.

High above the tallest tree in the garden sat the crow, perched on a brittle branch that swayed unnaturally in the still air. Its silhouette was darker than the void surrounding it, blending seamlessly with the night. And its eyes…they were still fixed on me. They glowed faintly, like burning coals, and seemed to hold a twisted kind of knowing. Its beak tilted upward slightly, almost as if…as if it were smiling.
