I raised my hand and touched my lip. It was bleeding slightly, and I could taste the iron on my tongue. I had been biting the skin on my lips all day. Maybe I was nervous.

I lowered my arm when I spotted something in the field. I stopped and reached for my shotgun. 

“Quiet,” I whispered to the dog.

It was the same thing I had said countless times before, but still the dog looked up at me joyously. A dozen times had I tried to train the mutt to sit or heel, and the creature would simply stare at me, head tilted, with the same blank expression. I could swear the dog had no concept of the world around it—nothing more than a childish sense of joy and wonder. It looked to the field, then back at me, and barked.

“Hey, hey,” I put my finger to my lips, “shh.”

The sun was almost down. A flock of pheasants had been sitting out in the clearing. It would have been the last clear shot I was going to get. By this point it was no use; the birds had already flown too high, and there was no way we would find more before the sun had gone down.

I shook my head.

“Fine, come on, let’s go home boy. But no jerky for you, got it?” I said.

I knew the dog couldn’t understand what I was saying, but I suppose I liked to pretend it did. Even if it just sat there—tail wagging and tongue lolling out—it was better than no one listening at all. 

The sun had begun to set as the first sight of the farm came into view. I felt a sense of relief—the kind one feels after a long day of hard labor. I couldn’t wait to sit down and eat a nice bowl of stew. Though, maybe if I had been able to shoot a bird or two, I could have had that instead.

As I walked over a small hill, I noticed the dog had stopped. I turned back. The mutt stood stiff, ears pointed straight forward, staring off into the woods.

"C'mon boy, let's go inside; it's getting late,” I said, snapping my fingers and whistling.

I looked in the direction the dog was staring. It was getting increasingly harder to see. I squinted as I peered through the trees. Still, I could see nothing.

“Hey, you hear me? We're going home, remember? Don’t go running off like you do.” I said, turning back to the dog.

The mutt took a few hesitant steps backward, and then faced me once more with wide eyes. It made a strange sound, something between a bark and a whimper, but eventually started trotting after me once more.

As I sighed and took my first step after turning around, the point of my boot caught something on the ground.

The snow had already covered most of the ground in a light layer, and the soil was wet and muddy beneath it. The mud stuck to my elbows as I attempted to stop myself from falling face-first. I cursed under my breath.

I cursed at the dog; I thought it had walked in front of me, but upon turning around, I saw it sitting next to me, staring with its ears flat against its head. It let out a whine, and then took a few hesitant steps in the other direction before quickly turning back to look at the forest.

I turned my head slowly. The snow wasn’t thick enough to obscure whatever it was I had stumbled over. As soon as I recognized what it was, my breath caught in my throat. I froze.

It was so close, and appeared in such detail that at first it didn't seem real. Then, my senses returned to me. I scrambled away, crawling backward and kicking the mud with my boots as I distanced myself. 

Look, as a farmer I am no stranger to slaughter, but I assure you that this was no normal, humane killing. 

The level of malice, hatred, and intelligence required to kill in such a way was beyond the limits of even the most terrible predators I know. The head was nowhere to be found, and the entire sight was enough to force me to turn my head and vomit. The fact that it had been one of the goats from my farm, and had been killed only a short distance from my house, almost made it feel like it had been purposefully placed for me to find. 

With that thought, I suddenly remembered why we had stopped in the first place.

I looked up and saw the dog standing a few paces ahead of me, facing the same direction as before. Its ears were still flat, and it was trembling slightly, staring into the woods and whining quietly.

Now, I am not a superstitious man, nor have I ever been prone to believing in nonsense, but I swear that at that moment, when I looked out into the woods in the dim light, a chill wind blew in from the forest, and a terrible stench came with it. It smelled like rot, yet came from the forest and not from the cadaver before me. The temperature fell and I shivered.

I slowly and cautiously rose to my feet, trying my best not to make a sound as I reached for the shotgun strapped to my back. I could hardly see anything now that the sun had gone down, but nevertheless, I watched the edge of the forest, holding the gun against me and keeping the barrel pointed toward the brush as I slowly retreated in the direction of the cabin.

I was far too nervous to take my eyes off of the area where the dog was staring, but every nerve in my body ordered me to sprint back home and lock the door shut. 

Until, at last, I heard something rustle the bushes in the forest. 

You can call me dramatic, if you wish—especially considering the fact that I had a loaded Remington 870 in my arms—but the truth was that I simply couldn’t stand it anymore, and every ounce of dignity left my body as I ran full speed toward the cabin, feeling the presence of something piercing my back for the entire length of the journey. I felt so unusually frightened that I didn’t even open the fence gate that separated the clearing from the farm, opting instead to throw myself over the wooden posts and continue until reaching the front porch.

The dog flew past me before I could even make it up the steps, but I soon threw the door open and instantly dashed inside.

I quickly let the dog inside as well and, without thinking twice, slammed the door shut. 

I scrambled around the keychain on the rack by the front door for an uncomfortably long period of time, searching frantically for the right key and fumbling with it in the lock before finally securing the door.I took a deep breath, leaning my back against the wall and sliding to the floor, still gripping the shotgun with both hands.

I touched my lips; they were bleeding again. I cursed.

The pain in my lip distracted me temporarily, and as my breathing and heart rate stabilized, I admit, I couldn’t help but feel slightly embarrassed. After all, it was entirely possible that I had allowed my overworked mind to run wild and that the carcass had not, in fact, been the work of some maniacal creature. I thought to myself that perhaps it was merely a bear or a cougar, and that the dim light had simply exaggerated the condition of the goat.

I chuckled slightly to myself, but my chuckle soon evolved into outright laughter. “Now, when was the last time we used that key, huh boy?” I spoke to the dog in between fits of laughter. “Ain’t nothing but possums and squirrels out here. I swear to god, never even thought to lock a door, and yet here we are, scared shitless, aren't we boy?”

My laughter eventually settled into something in between coughing and chuckling. I rubbed my eyes.

Then, as I finally began to settle down, something made me pause.

A sound—a sound coming from outside. I listened closely for the sound I had heard a second ago, that's when I heard it again: 

A soft scratch at the door.

The smile was wiped from my face in an instant.

Then, a whine behind the closed door.

The dog—my dog—was on the porch, barking, scratching, and whining at the door, and yet, I could vividly remember letting the mutt inside the cabin and locking the door behind it. 

Every ounce of blood drained from my skin.

My body refused to turn and face the dim interior of the cabin, but I could already see, in the corner of my eye, that the dog I had let inside was no longer behind me.

My eyes scanned the room, but it was far too dark to see what was in the hallway. I could only see darkness. That's when I recognized two possibilities: 

Either there is nothing in the darkness, or there is.

My question was answered. I heard something in the hallway.

I said to you before that I’m not usually a fearful person, nor was I ever in a situation before this that truly struck fear into my heart. But, when I realized that it was not my dog that was inside the cabin with me, I felt a sensation I had never experienced before and—I pray to God—will never experience again. 

It was not a rational fear. It was as if some awful memory had just awoken from a deep, thousand-year sleep—a primal fear that had hibernated through generations, and was now screaming deep within my mind. At that moment I felt—for lack of a better word—exactly like prey. 

The sound… it sounded nothing—absolutely nothing—like my dog.

It was almost as if someone with a hoarse, grating voice had attempted to mimic the sound of a panting canine, but all that had come out was an awkward, unnatural, and almost human impression. I could not see what was in the hallway.

The image of the goat lying beneath the dim light flashed into my mind. There was no doubt in my mind that the thing responsible for the gruesome sight was standing before me.

But then, the eerie panting ended abruptly.

“Quiet,” it whispered.

The word had come out as a heavy, unnatural groaning, as if a sick, elderly man had forced a word through a sore throat. Yet, at the same time, there was nothing human about it whatsoever.

“—He-y,” it breathed out, “shh...”

The voice was so unnatural and distorted that it was difficult to distinguish whether the speaker understood what it was attempting to say, or whether it was simply mouthing the syllables and breathing out.

The thing took a few steps forward, and floorboards creaked in the hallway. It sounded like the paws of a dog—the nails tapping the hard surface with a click-click-click-click. It stopped.

“Hhin—, let’s—go home… boy—” it breathed. 

My blood ran cold, and my body tensed in realization as I recognized the words I had spoken to the dog mere minutes before. 

“Go home. Getting lat—” 

The thing's voice collapsed, and it made a long, gargled choking sound as if it were trying to cough up something lodged in its throat. 

“Too dark for hunting," it finally croaked.

I couldn’t stand it anymore. Without a moment of thought, I opened my eyes, raised the gun, and pulled the trigger. I had aimed in the direction of the sound, but I hadn’t seen the target. Still, the shotgun boomed, and birdshot sprayed the interior of the house.

The sound of the blast was still ringing in my ears, and I was struggling to focus my eyes. My hands were shaking so violently that it was difficult to keep the gun steady.

For a moment, I began to worry that I had overreacted, and perhaps I should have investigated further before firing. Still, I stood up, pulled the slide on the gun, and waited, staring at the empty space in the center of the room. 

“Shh…”

Not a second later, something wrapped around my leg and squeezed. I turned the gun down, but before I could process what was happening, the claw pulled my leg out from under me and I fell onto the hardwood floor.

The grip tightened, and fingers dug into my leg. It was not a claw at all; it was a hand. A burning, searing pain shot up my calf. I cried out and, in desperation, pointed the barrel of the gun at the black space beneath the dinner table where the hand had come from. But before I could get my finger on the trigger, I was pulled forward. My head hit the edge of the table. I felt a jarring pain in my forehead. I had managed to hold on to the gun somehow and fired in the direction of the darkness.

As soon as the gun went off, the hand released my leg. I quickly scrambled backward, pulling the slide and sending another shell into the chamber. My leg was throbbing, and I could feel a warm trickle of blood running down my forehead. I still couldn’t see anything in the pitch-black room, but the sound of a dog’s breathing was clear and unmistakable.

I pulled the trigger and fired once more in the direction of the sound. The flash lit up the room just long enough for me to see a figure sitting under the table.

I was convinced, for just a second, that this was a nightmare. I knew it could not be real. The proportions were all wrong; the legs were far too long and thin, the torso was too tall and wide. Though it sat in the position of a dog, it seemed almost like some misshapen, emaciated cadaver. Its neck, however, was long and thin. I followed the neck until it ended. I saw a chin, not a snout. 

Though it was too dark to know for sure, I saw a round head and narrow eyes; it was a human head.  

On this head, most uncanny of all were its eyes, reflecting pale light, sunken and expressionless. I couldn't even tell where they were focusing, there was just the subtle impression of them seeming cold and far away. It was a blank stare—a sad, hopeless trance—focusing on nothing in particular. 

I ejected the shell and chambered another, firing again into the darkness. This time the flash revealed nothing. An eerie silence followed the sound. I pulled myself back against the wall, training the gun on the space in front of me. I froze for a moment; I felt melancholic somehow. The creature's eyes—those sad, painful eyes—were burned into my mind. I thought for a moment: 

Had I hurt it?

No. The birdshot had done little more than slow the thing down. There was no guarantee the next shell would serve the same purpose. That was my concern. Why was I sympathizing with it?

I snapped away from my trance. My head was pounding, and my calf felt as if it had been set on fire. I tried to get to my feet, but a jolt of pain shot up from my injured leg. I cried out before losing my balance and collapsing to the floor. 

“Quiet,” the voice whispered directly in my ear.

I turned to face the voice, prepared the next shell, and fired. Another empty shell was ejected from the weapon, but the flash revealed nothing but a cloud of smoke and debris.

I was down to my last bullet, and my hands were shaking so hard that the gun rattled in my grasp. It was getting difficult to breathe, and a thick, heavy sense of panic was building up in my chest until, at last, I was unable to handle the mounting pressure any longer.

I could no longer think straight. The only thing occupying my mind was the image of the goat, lying dead in the clearing before the woods. I could not lie on the ground, mutilated and broken, like the goat. I refused to become the object of its inhuman, maniacal game. 

I paused, and the silence was suffocating.

My hands reached for the door, and I slowly turned the key.

“Fuck you… Fuck. You," I muttered under my breath as the lock clicked.

“D-don’t… go running off like you—”

In an instant, I tightened my grip, lifted the gun, and fired the final shell.

Without confirming whether or not the creature had been hit, I pulled out the key, threw the door open, and leapt onto the front porch, shutting and locking the door with electrical speed. Almost immediately after the door had shut, something slammed against it from the other side, shaking the snow off the roof and rattling the windows of the house.

I fell on the porch, leaning against the door and trying to hold it shut. The thing, however, did not repeat the action, and simply groaned and wheezed, shaking the doorknob on the other side. The sounds continued for a while, but eventually trailed off into the night.

It was silent. 

Completely silent.

The dog—my real dog—was not on the porch.

If the dog had run away, it would have certainly gone to the shed—the dog did not live in the cabin with me. It knew where to go.

Besides, I always keep cartridges in the shed. I don't usually hunt elk, and find shooting birds more enjoyable. Still, I have a rifle. I use it to take shots at the coyotes that bother the animals every now and again. Never had I thought of using the rifle for self defence. 

I made my way to the cabin, dragging my leg behind me. I was exhausted, in pain, and terribly hungry. Maybe it was the fact that I had spent all day outside, or maybe it was the energy I had used up in the farmhouse. Whatever the cause, I felt famished and tired, and the walk to the shed was unusually exhausting. 

I reached the door and noticed it was closed. I stumbled inside and shut the door behind me.

Everything was still quiet. The dog was not in the shed.

I fell against a wall and slid to the floor. A pain shot up my leg and I touched the skin; it was an ugly, unnatural color. The pain had subsided considerably, though not enough to allow me to comfortably place weight on the ankle. I felt exhausted. Not only was I exhausted physically, but my head felt heavy. It was either pain, stress, or fear. I shook my head.

My eyes blurred and my head turned. I felt as if I were about to pass out; the pain in my leg and the unbearable hunger I still felt were the only things keeping me alert. I was trying so hard to resist falling out of consciousness that I almost forgot why. 

And then, as I thought I might faint, I heard something disturb the snow outside. 

My eyes shot open. It had been a soft, almost imperceptible crunch, like a heavy boot landing on a thin pile of snow. 

My body tensed and I forced myself to stand. I stood in silence, listening. If the thing was outside, I thought, perhaps it was listening as well. I made my way to the shelf where I kept my rifle.

The step was soon followed by another, then another, until finally the sounds stopped at the door. I took the rifle and loaded it. A few seconds later, I trained the barrel on the door.

I began applying pressure to the trigger. I knew I preferred to end the encounter as soon as I could, as opposed to repeating the experience in the farmhouse. The only thing keeping my finger from firing was the notion that maybe, if i remained quiet, it would ignore the shed and search elsewhere. 

“Hello?” 

My thoughts were interrupted.

It had been a male voice. It sounded concerned—maybe even slightly uneasy. I thought to lower the gun, but kept the barrel focused on the center of the wooden door.

Another period of unbearable silence.

“Is anyone in there?”

A hand tightened around the doorknob, then pushed forward.

Something, I don't know what, prevented me from firing immediately. Perhaps it was the blue uniform, or the badge which reflected what little light there was, but something about the figure told me to hold back.

The man crossed the threshold. Immediately, he raised a flashlight.

I had been sitting in total darkness, and the unexpected light blinded me entirely. I covered my face with my hand.

“Holy shit,” I heard someone whisper. 

“Drop your weapon!” The voice snapped suddenly.

The voice was strict and stern, and yet I had no intention of releasing the rifle in my arms. He sounded like an officer, he acted like one, and his attire was certainly familiar. Still, I refused to lower the weapon.

“I can't,” I said softly, almost to myself.

I heard the officer shift in his place, then take a step forward. The light was somehow more overpowering than before. 

“No, step back!” I said suddenly.

The officer took a step backward.

“What in God's name happened here? Holy shit!”

I still couldn't bring myself to face the light. I forced myself to take a few steps backward and lean against the back of the shed, squinting my eyes and turning to face the officer. I thought of an explanation.

“I… you wouldn't believe me,” I said as the officer took another step back.

As my eyes became accustomed to the light, I could make out the man's features. He seemed to have a short beard and a friendly face. His expression was one of concern; he looked at me with narrow, curious eyes, though, at the same time, he seemed stiff and uneasy. It made me feel uncomfortable. 

Something felt wrong. I thought for a minute about what it could be. 

He was scared.

He looked at me with disbelief. The officer was terrified. He took a step back occasionally, as if he were ready to flee as soon as I lifted a finger. 

What could I have done to make him act that way?

And then, for the first time, I felt something run down my chin. 

I raised my arm to touch my face, but it stopped before I expected. It touched something else, something that was not my face. I dropped the rifle to raise a second arm to my cheek. Once again it touched a firm, angled surface. It felt like leather.

It was then that I noticed how heavy my head was. I turned to the window; the darkness outside made it especially reflective. I could see myself staring back.

I froze. I recognized the sensation as the one from the forest at sunset. Once again, I felt as if I were staring into the woods, into the eyes of something unseen—into the eyes of the butcher from before.

I saw the head of a goat—fresh blood still streaming down its face. The eyes reflecting the gleam of the flashlight.

No—this couldn't be the reflection. It had to be what was behind the glass. My senses, however, could not lie to me. My hands were touching leather, not skin. 

I held the head of the goat with my hands and pulled it off. It was heavier than I expected. I realized how tired my neck was as soon as the mask came off.

Then, I started to think: 

Why was I wearing a mask?

My thoughts stopped there; I was interrupted by something else—I was interrupted by my new reflection.

What stared back at me in the glass, now that my mask was off, was something completely unfamiliar. My eyes were sunken and tired. My face was not round at all, but bony and emaciated. I had always had a beard, but beneath my mouth was a stream of dark red liquid. And my skin… my skin was not just pale; it was grey—the color of ash. 

No, that could not be me.

What disturbed me the most, however, were my lips. 

The reflection in the glass had no lips—only torn, bleeding strands of flesh hung from the space where the lips should have been. The missing flesh created a gap that allowed me to view the teeth beneath.

I froze; I could only stare, absolutely dumbfounded. I was disturbed, disgusted, and utterly overwhelmed. I couldn't even begin to process what I had seen. The smell of rot increased to unbearable levels. The smell made the air sticky, almost slimy; it stuck in my nostrils and burned into my sinuses. I tried to vomit, but all that came out was mucous and spit. My stomach cried—I hadn't eaten in far too long. 

I turned to the blinding light and raised my arms over my head. Somehow, they touched the ceiling. The man was speechless.

“I… I never called the police,” my voice was trembling, it didn't sound right, “why are you h-here.”

The officer was shocked—his face was pale. He stood silent for a few seconds, then spoke.

“You… someone… called two hours ago.”

Just then, his radio came alive with static. I listened to the white noise until a voice came through.

“Unit—zzzz—25… report.”

The officer reached for his radio, then brought it to his face.

“Unit 25 on the scene. I've got possible suspect at gunpoint, hands up. Suspect is male, impossibly tall and thin… 7 feet, at least,” the officer paused, staring at me in shock as if considering what to say, “I can't describe it, requesting backup for detainment. Over.”

“Unit 25, copy—” the radio went silent.

I looked down at my hands. They were thin—unnaturally thin—and the flesh hung from my fingers, and my bones pushed against my skin, pulling it taut and giving the impression of leather. I had to process what had happened.

I was interrupted. The radio buzzed. 

“Unit 32 on the scene, house is a mess… 10-91d, dog. Corpse filled with bullet wounds—zzzz—birdshot—beneath a table in the kitchen.”

I fell to my knees; my mind was spinning far too fast for me to stay on my feet.

Dog… bullet wounds… birdshot. None of it made sense. 

Just then, I heard a voice through the glass… from the farmhouse.

It was the same whisper as before, and yet, I heard it differently this time.

“Let's go inside,” it whispered.

There was no malice in its voice. It was completely empty. I recognized, at that instant, that the voice in the farmhouse spoke from everywhere and nowhere. 

“What did you say?” The officer took an uneasy step toward me.

Air came out, my throat trembled, and what was left of my lips mouthed the syllables.

“It's getting late.”

At that moment I was taken, for the very first time, by absolute hunger. 

I was, and still am, unbearably hungry. No matter how much blood I spilled that day, my body only grew thinner and thinner, paler and paler. 

I can only describe it as total emptiness… famine.
