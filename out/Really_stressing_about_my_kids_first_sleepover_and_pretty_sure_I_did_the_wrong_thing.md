After sharing my experience online, it turns out that most people think the whole shitshow was *my* fault. But if it were up to me, no one would have died. 

I shouldn’t say that. No one’s dead. [There isn’t any evidence of it](https://redd.it/14s64d7).

And my son’s a good boy. Most of the time. In my opinion, at least.

So I ignored the inevitable phone calls I received after five children when into my basement and four came up the next day, then sat my son down for a talk.

“Do you know what this is about?” I asked.

“No,” he answered in that blank way that only preteens can muster.

I faltered. “Um. Your friend who came over last night.”

“Which one?”

I winced. “The, uh, weird one.”

“Which weird one?” 

I stood up, folded my arms, sat down, and unfolded them. “You know. The squirrely-looking one who you said went home early.”

“You mean Oliver?” 

“Yes! That sounds right.” I forced a smile.

He maintained the blank stare. 

“Did you fuck around and hurt him last night?”

Ah, shit. My son looked like he was about to cry. I hate it when he does that. 

“Why would you say that, Dad?” he whimpered.

How was I supposed to respond? That I had watched him and his little dipshit friends roll the kid up and suffocate him on the hidden camera I’d left to spy on them?

I stared at my boy and convinced myself that I was somehow mistaken. He was too innocent.

There had to be another explanation.

I smiled and ruffled his hair. “Sorry. Your old man just worries about you, okay?”

He continued to stare wordlessly. 

And then my son hugged me. For two full seconds. Hugs had fallen off in the past couple of years, so I wrapped my arms around him and embraced the brief moment. As he turned and walked away, I felt significantly lighter. The stress had melted.

“Dad,” he whispered, stopping in the doorway with his back still facing me. “Stay out of the basement, okay?”

He paused for a moment longer before stepping out of the room. 

I felt each individual hair rise on the back of my neck, sending a wave of piloerection straight down to my taint. 

And so I was left alone in the kitchen with my thoughts. I had never *felt* silence before, like a physical thing raking across my skin.

I stared at the basement door. 

And resolved not to open it. Poking around seemed like an active search for trouble. I told myself this while subconsciously opening the basement door.

*Wow* that was a strong smell of copper. Was it like that when I had gone down there last night? I’m sure I would have noticed it. 

There had been a time when my own son was too afraid to go into the basement. I had always laughed it off, telling him that it was just his imagination creating things that weren’t there. 

I tried to convince myself of the same notion as I descended the steps. I really did. 

It’s just one of the many ways I’ve failed.

I entered the room and told myself that I if I didn’t find the rug, everything would be fine. 

I didn’t see it at first. I smiled.

Then I turned around and looked at the corner. 

The rug was there, rolled up tightly. The smell intensified as I got closer. It was only stained a little, though. That’s good, right?

I reached through the silence to touch it.

“Stop.”

My heart did just that as I turned around to face my son. We stared at each other and spoke without words.

“What did you do?” I finally managed to whisper.

He cocked his head. Something was different. 

“If you help me get rid of it, I’ll promise never to answer that question.”

Obviously, helping him would have been ridiculous. I pondered just *how* ridiculous it was as I dragged the extremely heavy rug to where I’d parked my car in the backyard, away from prying eyes. As I heaved and sweated, I told myself that I couldn’t know that anything was wrong as long as I didn’t look in the rug. 

That included ignoring the occasional twitch from inside. That *had* to be my imagination. 

I hated forcing the thing into my car. But the silence upon completion was even worse. My son stared at me when we were done, both of us panting. 

“We need to drive.”

My son is *eleven.*

So I stepped aside to type this up and post it. That seemed like the prudent [thing to do](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
