When my husband and I were first presented with the idea that we move in with my grandmother, to say we were less than enthusiastic was an understatement. It’s not that I don’t love my grandmother or anything, but my husband and I have been married less than a year and want to have a place on our own. However, for financial reasons while we both get settled into our new jobs, we figured this would be the best option for us. Plus, we’d get to move out of our too-small-for-two people apartment and would be able to take care of my grandmother and keep her company. 

We moved in about a month ago and, I gotta say, up until a few nights ago it was going pretty smoothly. My grandmother was loving the company and having the help around the house, and my husband and I have had a lot more privacy than we thought since we have the whole finished basement to ourselves. Thursday night, though, everything changed. I woke up at around 3am needing to pee. As I walked back from the bathroom, one of the floorboards beneath my foot came loose. So loose that I could lift it up. I was getting ready to put it back into place and deal with fixing it the next day, when I noticed something under the floorboard. It was a small, gold key, attached to a keychain that said “Billy.” I’m not sure why, but I felt this sickening feeling in my stomach as soon as I grabbed it. Still, curiosity got the best of me, and I headed back to our bedroom, stuffing the key in the bedside drawer next to me. 

At breakfast the next morning, I wanted to see if my grandmother knew anything about the key or “Billy.” For some reason, my gut was screaming at me to proceed with caution so I approached the subject softly. 
“Hey, grandma, who’s Billy?”

She put her coffee mug down and took a deep breath. I could feel the tension grow as we sat there in silence for what felt like an eternity. Finally, after what was realistically about thirty seconds, she looked at me with an expression I had never seen from her before. Pure rage. 

“Where did you hear that name?” She half-yelled.

Knowing I shouldn’t tell her about the key I found, I quickly mumbled, “Oh, I just…I think I heard his name mentioned in one of my mom’s childhood stories she was telling me the other day.”

“Mm…” she answered, unconvinced. 

The anger seemed to have subsided though, and my grandma walked away from the table to sit outside. Unnerved by my grandmother’s reaction to me asking about Billy, I began cleaning. Cleaning is something I do when I’m feeling particularly anxious or afraid. I’m not sure why but it’s soothing. As I ran the broom across the kitchen floor, I heard my grandmother talking outside. I know I should have respected her privacy, but the hushed, rapid tone in which she was speaking piqued my curiosity. I hid myself under the window and listened. 

“If you didn’t tell Lacey about Billy, then where did she hear about him?” a short pause followed while she listened to the person on the other end of the phone, who I assume was my mother, respond.
“Well, if she brings it up to you, keep your mouth shut about it. I can’t relive that again.”

Almost immediately after my grandma hung up the phone, my husband walked through the door from work. He had just started working the overnight shift at his job, so him getting home from work at 11am and spending the rest of the day sleeping before eating and leaving again was our new normal. He saw me crouched under the window and looked at me confused.

“Lace, what the hell are you doing?” He laughed.

“SHHHHHHH,” motioning to him with my finger in front of my lips. 

I quickly got up and rushed him into the bedroom. He must’ve thought I rushed him in there for a different reason because he had a smirk on his face as I closed the door. As put his arms around my waist and leaned in to kiss me, I whispered, “I have to tell you something!” In a hushed tone, I told him about the key I found and the whole interaction with my grandmother and the phone call I overheard.
 
“Who do you think Billy is?” Jack asked changing into his pajamas.

“I have no idea. But what’s with all the secrecy? And what is this a key to? And…”

“Lace…there’s clearly a reason why it’s a secret. You heard your grandma, it’s too painful to relive. Just let it go.”

“I guess,” I said in a way that didn’t convince him or me I would stop looking for answers.

Later that night, I was watching TV. Jack was at work and my grandma had gone to bed at like 8 o’clock. I went into my bedroom and opened my bedside drawer. I studied the key, wondering what it opened. I decided I would take advantage of being alone and explore the house. I knew I couldn’t go anywhere near my grandmother’s room on the third floor because I couldn’t risk waking her up. I crept into the laundry room at the far end of the basement and started rummaging through drawers and the linen closet. Nothing. 

I went into the walk-in closet in the other bedroom in the basement. The light in the closet was busted, so I was using the flashlight on my phone. As I scanned around the closet, I noticed all the way in the back my light was reflecting off of something. The closer I got, the sicker to my stomach I felt. When I finally reached the end of the closet, I saw it. A keyhole. I took a deep breath and wondered if I really wanted to find out what was on the other side. It was as if everything in me was telling me not to do it, but I felt like not knowing would drive me crazy. I put the key into the hole and, to my surprise, it fit. When I opened the door, nothing could have prepared me for what was on the other side.

I opened the small the door in the closet and crouched through the entryway. When I got to the other side, I could barely breathe from the stench of rot. I was in a bedroom. A kid’s bedroom that looked like it had not been touched since the 1950s. There were clothes strewn on the bed and the floor, toys scattered throughout the room, and a boy’s bed off in the corner. 

“What the fuck,” I whispered to myself.

As I walked further into the room, I noticed some pictures and drawings on the desk. The pictures were of a young boy sitting on a tree swing smiling widely. I turned the picture over and saw in small writing “Billy- July 1955.” I tucked the picture away in my pocket. I started to get this eerie feeling like someone was watching me. I knew I needed to get the hell out of there. I grabbed a notebook I found on the desk and scurried out of the room, making sure to lock the door behind me. I could swear that as I turned the lock I could hear a little boy yell, “Don’t”. 

Spooked, I quickly made my way back to my bedroom. I was stopped in my tracks by my grandmother standing at the bottom of the stairs. She hadn’t seen me but the enraged look on her face told me she knew something was going on. I had a small, but possible, chance that I could make it to my bedroom without my grandmother seeing me. In that moment, I felt like a child wanting to run and hide under their covers from the scary monster. I slowly got on all fours and as quietly as humanly possible and made my way to the bedroom. By the time I got in there, my grandmother was checking out the laundry room. I quickly made my way into my bed and pulled the sheets over me, pretending to be asleep. 

After about five minutes, I heard my grandmother’s slow and heavy footsteps approach my room. I don’t know why, but I was scared stiff. My grandmother never scared me before. In fact, I really never saw her angry until I asked about Billy. Slowly, her footsteps approached my bed until they stopped right in front of me. 
Pretending to be asleep, I could feel my grandmother’s face inching closer and closer to mine. She was so close that if I opened my eyes, I’m positive my eyelashes would graze her face. I could feel her hot breath on my face, feel the sweat dripping from her forehead. It took everything in me to keep from screaming. My grandmother just stood there, hovering over my face for at least twenty minutes. I know it sounds crazy, but in those twenty minutes I don’t think she ever blinked. You might be asking, “how would you know if your eyes were closed?” But, if she could feel my eyelashes if I opened my eyes, wouldn’t I feel hers if she closed them?

After twenty minutes that felt like twenty years, I heard my grandmother slowly inch backwards from my bed. I mistakenly thought this terrifying ordeal was over, but I was wrong. My grandmother sat in the chair of the vanity not too far from my bed and sat there watching me until morning. In the morning, I opened my eyes pretending as if I was just waking up and not silently freaking out with my eyes closed for the last few hours. When I turned to look at the vanity, my grandmother wasn’t there. I heard footsteps upstairs and could tell she was in the kitchen. How the hell didn’t I hear her leave?

I walked up the stairs and into the kitchen. My grandmother was making eggs and had brewed coffee.

“Good morning, dear,” She sweetly said as she handed me a plate of eggs. “How’d you sleep?”

“Um…ok I guess.” 

She was pretending nothing happened. I certainly wasn’t going to bring up last night. As I sat down and began eating my eggs, I could feel my grandmother’s eyes on me. I looked up and the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. My grandmother’s eyes, fixated on me, were completely black for a split second before turning back to normal. She still was acting like nothing happened last night. 
	
  “What is your day like today?” She asked, getting up to put her plate in the dishwasher. “I’m going to run to the store to pick up some clothes for my new job and then I’m going to do some grocery shopping.” Normally I would ask her to come along. Not today, though. I needed out of that house and away from whatever the hell the thing acting like my grandmother was.

Instead of going shopping for clothes, I drove to a park outside of town and found a spot under a tree to read the notebook I had found in that bedroom last night. It was Billy’s journal. Most of the pages were filled with what he had done that day, drawings, and stories. 

The last three pages, however, sent chills down my spine. 

“July 25th, 1955.
Mom and dad don’t believe me. Jane is acting weird. I mean she’s always been weird but not like this. I told them that in the middle of the night last night, I heard weird noises from Jane’s room. When I peeked through the door, she talking to someone in the corner and laughing. She must have felt me there cause she turned around really quick and I swear her eyes were black for a second. Mom said not to swear if something isn’t true cause it’s a sin, but I SWEAR I saw her eyes like that. She closed the door in my face, and I ran back to bed.”

“August 11th, 1955.
I haven’t been feeling too good. Ever since that night, I’m scared to be alone with Jane. No one believes me, but she’s getting weirder and weirder. The other day when Mom and Dad were out at the store, I was playing marbles outside by myself. I heard some rustling coming from the other side of the yard. When I looked up, Jane was running on all fours toward the chicken coop. She had this creepy look on her face, like it was contorted into an evil grin and her eyes were bloodshot. When she got to the coop, I hid behind the tree and saw Jane pounce into the coop, grab a chicken with her hands, and start eating it alive. My eyes filled with tears, and I felt pee dripping down my leg. Just then my parents’ car pulled in front of the house and Jane’s face jerked up. She quickly scampered away, back into the house. When my parents found me, I told them what happened. They didn’t believe me and sent me to my room.”

“August 25th, 1955
It’s really hard to write cause I’m too weak. After Mom and Dad sent me to my room, they locked the door from the outside. Later that night, Mom opened the door to bring me food and some water. She told me I should think about the consequences of lying and closed the door. When mom locked the door, I heard her gasp and knew she had seen Jane. She told Jane not to creep up on her like that and to go get washed up before bed. Mom repeated herself a few times before I heard her scream out in agony. When my dad came down to check, he met a similar fate. I had backed myself up against the wall and sat there clutching my knees. Slowly, I heard the door creak open. I kept my eyes closed tightly as Jane approached me. She whispered that I needed to learn my lesson, or I’d end up like Mom and Dad. I opened my eyes and Jane was covered in blood. She had this deranged smile on her face and her eyes stayed open and wide as she backed away out of the room. Before she closed the door, she stared at me and let out a cackle, never once changing her facial expression or closing her eyes.
I’ve been in here for a long time, I think. At least two weeks. I’m hungry, I don’t think I can go on much longer.”

The journal ended there. I quickly called my mom and asked her about Billy. 

“Why did he describe Grandma like that? Why didn’t anyone ever mention she had a brother? You told me grandma’s parents died in a car accident when she was 13!”

“Leave it alone Lacey. I’m serious. I don’t want to talk about it. Just don’t let grandma know you know anything more than his name,” she said before hanging up.

I rushed home and woke up my husband. I whispered to him that he needed to leave and go to a friends’ house or something. He had so many questions, but I told him he needed to go NOW. I didn’t want to drag him further into this. My husband, usually one to be logical, saw the fear in my eyes and quickly was out the door. I followed him upstairs and saw my grandmother in the yard gardening. I called out to her that I was going to go grocery shopping a little later but decided to come back home and take a nap first. 

“Okay, sweetie,” she waved.

I went downstairs, locking the door behind me. I quickly grabbed the key out of my pocket and made my way back to the room in the closet. When I got into the bedroom, I started looking for any clues as to what happened to Billy. I was overcome with that same, putrid smell of rot as I searched through the room. I opened a toy chest that sat at the foot of the bed and immediately gagged. Inside, was a skeleton of a child, dressed in the same clothes Billy was wearing in the picture. As I reached for my cellphone to call the police, I heard the door to the room slam behind me. At the door stood my grandmother. She looked at me, eyes filled with rage. Instead of yelling, she laughed. She laughed, and laughed, and laughed with that same expression Billy described.

“If only you had listened to me you little bitch….You know why your mom is so scared of me? Cause when she was little, if she misbehaved, I’d lock her in the room with Billy. I thought we should’ve done the same to you since you were such a little brat growing up, but your mother made me promise I’d never do that. I promised not to, if she promised never to bring up Billy. No need to bring up old news. But, you had to be a little nosey, rotten, bitch.” She was right in front of me now. Her faces was inches from mine staring at me with her black, soulless eyes and a face that no longer resembled my grandmother’s. We stood in silence like that for a few seconds before I tried to run.

I felt my grandmother’s hand grab onto my arm, and I turned around. She suddenly looked like my grandmother again. 

“Oh, dear. This is your home now.”

My grandmother crawled toward the door, contorting her body in unhuman ways as she moved. She looked back at me and I shrieked in horror. She had my face now, my body, and my voice. She laughed once more and closed the door behind her. 

Now, I’m stuck in this room. A room I wish I never found. I need to find a way out.
