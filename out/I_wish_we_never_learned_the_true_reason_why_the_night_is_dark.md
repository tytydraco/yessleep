We’ve all gazed at the sky and maybe have asked the question, "Why is the sky blue?", But have you ever truly pondered the night? Why is there such darkness in space? Why does the vast expanse of space feel so cold, so empty, so desolate?

Throughout history, brilliant minds have wielded science and mathematics to unravel the mysteries of space and time. But did anyone answer why? Why is it that the speed of light is limited while distances of cosmic objects are so huge? Why is space so empty and dead? Why are the only examples of life we know exist on a single planet orbiting a single star?

There’s a harsh truth we often forget: we are small, limited creatures. We perceive only three spatial dimensions and experience time as a single, unbroken thread. What if beyond our senses or understanding, lies a reality so alien that it eludes even the sharpest minds?

I am an astrophysicist and it was my life's work to figure out these questions. Questions rarely pondered in today's world. What I dicovered was a terrible truth about the nature of our universe. It would have been the most earth shattering discovery, had the world's governments not suppressed it. 

Surely, you must observed how things have changed over the last few decades. The way governments have stopped planning for the future, the way corporations are hoarding resources like there’s no tomorrow. It’s not just greed. They know.

I don’t think staying silent is an option anymore. People deserve to know. Even if the truth breaks them. If this post disappears, or if I do, you’ll understand why.

It started soon after the Apollo Lunar missions. Space exploration was at it peak and we had mountains of data to process. As we studied the data, we noticed anomalies in the light's temperature fluctuations. Subtle but consistent deviations that suggested something odd about the way light had traveled in the early universe. Further analysis revealed that these fluctuations couldn’t be explained by known physical models. Einstein was completely wrong. We had evidence that the speed of light was not a constant. In fact, in the early universe, it was almost infinite, but had slowed down to the value we observe today.

Leading physicists dismissed our findings as speculative nonsense. They claimed our methodology was flawed. The heart of the controversy lay in the implications of our work. If light had indeed slowed down, it undermined one of the most important constants in physics. The speed of light wasn’t just a number, it was a cornerstone of modern science. To question it was to question the very structure of the universe. The US govenment played a significant role in suppressing our work as it undermined the careers of a lot of very prominent and well paid scientists.

I still continued my work in obscurity. My reputation was tarnished beyond repair but I refused to up.

See, If the speed of light had slowed, it raised a haunting question: why?

Physics offers no mechanism for such a change. Constants, by their very nature, are supposed to be unchanging. A changing speed of light implied an external force, something beyond our understanding of the universe. It suggested interference, not just with light, but with the fundamental laws of reality.

And if that interference was deliberate... who, or what, was responsible? This was what made even the bravest physicists uncomfortable.

As technology advanced, more scientists joined me as they independently figured out the truth and were subsequently ridiculed and supressed. In hindsight, perhaps they were justified in their efforts to silence us. Even now, I can't help but regret that we ever dared to seek the answer to the question of "Why?"

It all started with something we found in the early 2000s. Infrared surveys of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the faint radiation left over from the Big Bang, found something we didn’t expect.

There was a strange glow superimposed on the CMB. It was faint, like static, but it was structured. At first, we thought it might be a calibration error or interference. But the glow was real, and when we mapped it out, it formed patterns.

Not random patterns. Complex ones.

It was like finding fingerprints in the oldest layers of the universe.

When we looked closer at the data, we found something horrifying.

The universe was once a vibrant, radiant expanse, teeming with light and life far beyond what we can comprehend today. The cosmos wasn’t always the cold, empty void we see now; it was filled with energy, potential, and life in a way that we could scarcely imagine. But then something changed. Something began to drain it, changing the constants of reality. A force or an entity perhaps, not of this dimension, slowly siphoned off the universe's vitality, consuming energy, and leaving behind the desolate expanse we now call space. And perhaps most terrifying of all, this force or entity, whatever it is, isn’t gone.

You’ve probably heard of the Bootes Void. It’s a massive region of space with almost no galaxies in it, so empty that it makes everything around it seem unnaturally dense. Astronomers have always thought it was just a natural phenomenon, the result of random fluctuations in the universe’s early expansion. But we studied it meticulously. That was our evidence that the force or entity is still out there, snuffing out galaxies and stars at a phenomenal scale. Based on our calculations, we have tragically very little time left. Maybe in a day or maybe in a thousand years, we will certainly be wiped from existence, consumed by forces beyond our comprehension.

We are not drifting in an endless sea, but trapped in a cold, dark prison with its walls closing in every second. The Fermi Paradox, the question of why we haven’t found alien life was never a paradox. We haven’t found life because we’re the last ones left. The final embers of life in a universe that’s already gone dark.

There is nothing we can do to stop this. We are like insects trying to stop an earthquake. Our leaders know the truth. That’s why progress has stalled. That’s why governments have abandoned their dreams of the stars. They’re preparing for the end, even if they won’t admit it.

So, the next time you look up at the night sky, remember this: the silence you see is not natural. It is deliberate, a haunting stillness that echoes the universe’s slow death. And soon, we will all fall into that same silence, forgotten, like the stars themselves.
