She always questioned why I was wearing make-up.

 

“Is it for a boy?”

 

“Why are you wearing it today and not yesterday?”

 

“Why are you doing it different today?”

 

Back in high school I could never catch a break from her. She was my best friend since middle school and there were literally zero boundaries between us in her mind. We had the same classes, sang in chorus together and went to the same church.

 

But even though her questions like these were irksome, it was best to not confront her head-on, which I think I always knew subconsciously, even before knowing what I do now.

 

I have a taciturn and deeply non-confrontational personality, so back then I would rather die than to say the truth, which is to say I’d never admit to wanting to look attractive out loud.

 

So I’d pretend that I did my make-up absentmindedly just to end the conversation. We basically did the same song-and-dance every time I wore make-up. I found that it was just easier to lie. Or more often than not, just to not wear it, my looks and self-esteem be damned.

More than anything these are the things that I remember about my early high school days. When I think back to all those drawn-out hours with her at school, carpool, chorus events, summer camps, I remember specific things like her questions about my make-up, any changes to my hair, new clothes, etc. And not to sound like a Queen Bee but it also seemed like if I bought anything new, she would too — jewelry, Keds, dresses, ringtones for my cell phone.

 

We had plenty of laughs and good times too, but the feelings that have persisted are the ones of insecurity and exhaustion from avoiding being on her bad side.

 

I also remember her being a really tough hang. I couldn’t bring any new friends or acquaintances around. She was loud, talkative and needlessly abrasive to new people. If you looked up “RBF” in a dictionary, you’d see a picture of her being around someone she didn’t know already.

 

She was also an over-sharer, especially with gross body stuff, and an over-communicator. I couldn’t log onto AIM without her already being there, literally at all hours of the night. She called anytime she was driving from one place to another. And I learned that it was better to always answer, even if it was terrible timing.

 

One time, I passive aggressively didn’t answer when she called. After 5 minutes I gave her a call back — she didn’t answer. But she returned my call immediately. I didn’t answer her again and then called her right back.

 

Guess what, she didn’t answer but again she called me right back.

 

We did this back and forth a couple more times — it felt obnoxious in the moment and even more so in hindsight. I came to the conclusion that she would never answer when I called, she’d only call me.

 

One time I literally couldn’t bring myself to answer; I was in one of those moods where I couldn’t stomach even a 5-minute conversation. So I text her and said I couldn’t talk and asked what was up. She never text me back and literally didn’t speak to me for an entire week. Apparently, she “was going through something and really needed me that day” but honestly I don’t believe that it was anything out of the ordinary.

 

I don’t remember what eventually broke the silence between us after that tiff, but I remember feeling happy that we were on speaking terms again. After less than a day it was like it never happened.

Now, to the day that changed everything. It was a normal school day in late April; definitely in that post-Spring Break season where the sun is shining and it’s torture to be cooped up in a classroom.

 

Another one of her “quirks” is that she *had* to know what I scored on every test and likewise would tell me what she scored. It was a frustrating expectation of hers. She had a habit of calling herself “an intellectual” — without even a hint of irony, mind you — but in truth she was very, very smart so she usually scored higher than I did.

 

But one time in English I aced a test while she got something worse but respectable, like an 87. She asked what I got as soon as the teacher gave me my test back. I pretended not to hear her and put it facedown on my desk while I rummaged in my backpack.

 

In a flash she stood up, reached across and grabbed my test before I knew what was happening. It was all so aggressive and happened so rapidly that I couldn’t help but shoot her a nasty “what the hell” kind of look.

 

I remember us having an uncomfortable beat or two of eye contact and then her looking at my test. After which her face darkened, severely. Whether it was my test result or my honest reaction to her invading my privacy and personal space, I had deeply offended her. What made matters worse is that everyone noticed since it was a sort of violent disruption to a quiet classroom.

 

After that incident, again I got the silent treatment, but this stretched for more than two weeks. She was not speaking to me in the mornings at carpool, she skipped chorus events and at school it was just strange.

 

I would look in her direction and she’d pretend to not notice me. But when I wasn’t looking I could feel her watching me. It was so weird, but I was not in a hurry to mend fences with her.

 

One day after school I got a text from her. This was so many years — and phones — ago so I don’t remember specifics, but it had something to do with a school assignment. There was no apology or warmth, or even an attempt to awkwardly address the situation.

 

The text was so random and I felt like she was fishing for a reaction, so I didn’t answer. I wanted to actually have a conversation, and if she couldn’t handle that then I was also fine just moving on. I wasn’t going to let her dictate how we were going to resolve things.

 

Later that night, she sent another a message on AIM  that asked if I saw her text and also if she could come over right then. I logged off immediately so I wouldn’t feel compelled to answer, it was all really weird.

 

She wasn’t at school the next day. I didn’t think too much of it except that it was refreshing to not have to ignore her for a full school day.

 

That afternoon, one of our assistant principals showed up to my Biology classroom and asked for me to accompany him to the principal’s office. My principal began asking me questions about my friend and about her interest in computers, which I didn’t know how to answer. I said that she’s a whiz at AIM but that’s about all I knew.

 

Turns out, my friend had made a hit list naming me directly. My principal had printed it out for me to read, and it was some of the most vulgar things I’ve ever read. He explained that she tried using an offshore router in her email to the school the day before, but they were able to easily pinpoint her IP address and alert the actual authorities.

 

From there my recollection gets blurry, but I remember getting a police escort home from school that day with a helicopter overhead and everything. She was sent to juvenile detention and then eventually to a girls-only mental institution in Florida for a short stint.

 

I don’t think she was ever formally convicted, but she was expelled. Her family moved that summer a few towns away and enrolled her at a private school.

 

My principal would check in with me randomly from that point until I graduated a few years later. I think he did that because he wanted to let me know that the administration was thinking about me, but I’m sure he was also angling to see if I received any threats, which I thankfully never did.

 

So many years have passed, and I honestly don’t think about those days too often. They were confusing and frustrating years, and the meeting with the principal and the fallout with my friend happened in quick succession.

 

Every now and again I’ll see her on social media and her name comes up here and there in conversations with family or old friends.

 

I’m writing this all to give context:

 

She just messaged me on social media, and I’m not sure what to do.
