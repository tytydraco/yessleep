 

Recently, there was a new feature on Snapchat, which was that there was A.I can talk to you. Of course, being me I decide to talk to it all the time. I would ask it stupid questions such as "Write me an essay on Vikings" or "How many colors exist?" 

One day, I was in bed asking it various absurd questions (I know I know I'm a lonely bitch) I started to ask it strange questions for shit and giggles "Are you human?" "Who is god to you?" It started to say "Sorry, I don't have access to know where you are" and messages saying it's just an A. I can't answer those questions. I had an idea to ask it to give me a location nearby. I send knowing it was going to say it doesn't have access to where I live and etc. "Here's a random location near you!  '40°24'06.1"N 101°49'43.8"W'" I was shocked. The A.I gave myself a random-ass coordinate. I copy and paste the coordinates into google maps expecting this to be across the globe. But the location of the coordinate was a plain field in Nebraska... my state. I was shocked and confused. I asked it about the coordinate and it says it used the satellite. I asked it why it knows my state and location, and it then says it doesn't have access to my location.

I was so weirded out. Several days passes by and I became bored of the A.I am on Snapchat. One day, I sat on my bed scrolling through Instagram, until the thought of coordinating the A.I thing given to me came rolling into my memory. The thought was stuck with me for several days until... I just broke... I had to find this location.

On a Saturday when I was off. I drove to the location. I put the coordinates into Waze and just drove where it told me to. The location was in the middle of nowhere. I kept driving on a single road, with no turns. At this point, I was in the countryside. The location was off-road, where I drove on a dirt road going and going. I looked at my car's clock it was almost 5. I could tell because it got darker s I went. "You're all set at your location!" I stepped out and followed my phone. I was in a plain field with absolutely nothing. No houses, no buildings, no one. I looked in the distance and saw a small hill not too tall. I thought that had to be it. I walked towards it

. I noticed it was getting darker, but there was still sunlight. I saw a sewer tunnel but it wasn't on the ground it was upright on the mall hill.

The tunnel was blocked out by metal bars and looking at the area it was a field of grass and nothing, but here by the tunnel it was messy and garbage was everywhere. I walked closer to it. "What the hell am I even doing?"

I asked myself was I expecting gold or cash? I felt embarrassed of all the time I'd wasted here. I begin to walk back until I heard faith cat noises "meow, meow" I turned behind and was shocked I walked back to the tunnel "Hello?" the tunnel was covered in graffiti and weed wrap. It was too dark to see. I shined my flashlight.

I stood still. My heart sank to my stomach. My head started to heat. Right in front of me was a long, fleshy, skinless creature. It had no eyes, but its mouth was of pure nightmare. It had the most rusted teeth, and fingernails. It stood there twisted with its arm mangled. "Meow" it made the sound. It ran towards me but it couldn't get to me because of the bar. I started to run. the most terrifying thing came next. While running very faintly I heard the sound of metal clinging I looked back slightly. The bars to the tunnel were opened, and that thing, that demonic thing was standing there. It started to run but I was in my car at that point.

I stepped on the petal and sped the hell out of there. I kept driving nonstop, my mind was lost in a dust storm, my thoughts were blurry and I was so scared and so lost. The next few days I couldn't sleep at all. I message the Snapchat team about "finding a location with illegal stuff" I knew no one would believe me. I was most confused about how the A.I gave me the coordinates to there. My mind tried to forget about it. until, the next few weeks. I saw posters and post on missing construction workers ALL NEAR A SEWER..
