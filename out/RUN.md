"Every day when I woke up I had to run to school, every lunch I had to run from my bullies, every evening I would run into my room and hide away. I ran for ages I don't remember a time that I wasn't running.

I got good at running, amazing actually. Even if my legs felt numb and burning, even if they were cut and bruised, I still ran. I entered competitions, I always got first place. At the age of 20 I was quicker than most Olympic athletes. People though I was using steroids so I did test before every race. People were watching my every move at this point, it was clear that I was far quicker than anyone. Then I got it, o  December 19th 2011 I ran the 100 meter race quicker than Usain Bolt. 30 miles per hour. It was on the news, it was at this point I realised I didn't need to run anymore."

This is what my brother wrote in his autobiography, all of this was true. When I heard the news that he had disappeared I was devastated. After they stopped the search I was looking through his house, I noticed there was a diary. I peeled it out of the dusty drawer, brushed it off and started to read,

I'm starting this diary because of something bothering me, I have been seeing a mam everywhere I go. No matter how fast I run, he's there. I just want him to go away.

I can't get any time to think, I've been busy with the press, he's only around six feet away. I feel sick. I cannot comprehend what he is. He's looking at me right now the only time he's not is when I run, he has to face forward to run ad quick as me.

He's been getting closer, before he was off in the distance but now he's only 40 meters away. I'm starting to get worried, I'm having tests done to see if im Schizophrenic and saying it's just to check for drugs. I don't want to worry my family. 

February 15th 2012
I haven't written in this for a while due to me being on the news. He's only a few meters away and I'm really worried. 

March 22nd 2012
I'm done running, no matter how fast I run he's right there I'm going to be ready when he's able to touch me. If anyones reading this then I'm probably dead, please if you see a dark figure in the corner of your vision then RUN.


As I finished reading the rushed writing. I stood up and left, I couldn't wrap my head around what I had just read. I walked out the door and felt my heart drop all the way into my stomach, in the corner of my vision I noticed two tall figures staring at me. I turned to look but they werent there. I've probably not got much time left as I'm not nearly as quick as my brother was, but please if you see dark figures in the corner of your vision, RUN
