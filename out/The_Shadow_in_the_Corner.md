The first rule of the Under-Dark is simple: You do not breathe when the springs groan.

I pressed my ventral plates into the gray dust, flattening my liquid shadow-form until I was little more than a stain on the floorboards. Above me, the wooden slats of the bed frame bowed. **CREAK. GROAN.** The sound was a thunderclap in my sanctuary, a tectonic warning that the Titan was shifting its weight.

My three hearts hammered against my ribs—thump-hiss, thump-hiss, thump-hiss—a rhythm so loud I was certain it would vibrate up through the mattress and betray me.

I am Malaphis. I am the Shadow in the Corner, the Eater of Bad Dreams, the thing that has made a thousand children wet their beds in terror. I have feasted on the adrenaline of the innocent for three centuries. I have driven nannies to madness and forced families to move across oceans.

But I am weeping.

A tear, thick and black like crude oil, leaked from my primary eye and pooled in the dust. I didn't dare wipe it away. Movement was death.

Above me, the breathing changed.

Usually, the sleep-breath of a human child is a soft, rhythmic whuff-shhh. It is the dinner bell for my kind. It signals that the dreamscape is open, ready for us to slide in and plant the seeds of terror. But the Thing Above, the boy named Toby, did not breathe like prey

His breath was a wet, clicking rasp. It sounded like scissors snipping through wet silk.

Snip-hiss. Snip-hiss.

He wasn't sleeping. He was waiting.

My stomach cramped, a sharp knot of hunger twisting my entrails. I hadn't fed in six nights. A fear-eater can go a week, maybe two, before he begins to fade, losing his cohesion and turning into harmless mist. I looked at my hands—clawed, obsidian, terrifying—and saw the edges were already blurring, turning to smoke.

I needed to leave. I needed to find a new house, a new child, a normal child who cried for their mother when they saw a shadow move. But to leave, I had to cross the Carpet.

The Carpet was the kill zone.

I shifted my weight, inching one knee forward. The movement disturbed a cluster of dust bunnies. They rolled away like tumbleweeds.

**CREAK.**

The bed above me exploded with motion.

I froze, my blood turning to ice. The mattress slammed down against the slats as the weight above moved violently. A heavy, singular THUMP hit the floorboards right next to the bed skirt.

He was out of bed.

I squeezed my eyes shut, retracting my tentacles, pulling myself into a tight, trembling ball against the far wall of the Under-Dark. Please, I prayed to the Old Nightmares. Please let him just be going to the bathroom

Silence stretched. Thick, heavy, suffocating silence.

Then, the bed skirt lifted.

It didn't fly up all at once. It rose slowly, agonizingly, just an inch. A single, pale finger hooked under the fabric, lifting it like a stage curtain.

Light from the hallway streetlamp slashed into my darkness, blinding me. I squinted, my secondary eyes watering.

An eye appeared in the gap.

It was blue. But not the sky-blue of innocence. It was the pale, washed-out blue of a drowned thing floating in stagnant water. The pupil was blown wide, swallowing the iris, a black hole searching for gravity.

"Malaphis?"

The voice was a whisper, but it carried no tremble. It carried a smile.

"Are you hungry, Malaphis?"

I didn't answer. I held my breath until my lungs burned.

"I know you're there," Toby whispered. "I can hear your tummy growling."

The finger let go. The bed skirt dropped. The darkness returned.

I let out a ragged exhale, shaking so hard my teeth rattled. He was mocking me. The predator was toying with the mouse.

I remembered the first night I arrived here. I had slithered in through the window, hungry and arrogant. I had seen a small boy under the quilt, a perfect morsel. I had swelled to my full height, a seven-foot nightmare of smoke and teeth, and I had roared my terrifying, soul-shaking roar.

The boy hadn't screamed. He hadn't hidden under the covers.

He had sat up. He had looked at me with those dead, waterlogged eyes and said, “Finally. Make me a balloon animal.”

And when I refused, when I reached out to harvest his fear... he bit me

He bit my shadow-flesh, and it hurt. It wasn't a physical bite; it sheared off a piece of my essence. He chewed it and swallowed it, and I saw his eyes flare with a terrible, golden hunger. That was when I realized I had made a grave mistake. I wasn't the invasive species here. I was the livestock.

Scritch... scritch... scritch.

The sound came from the Carpet. He was moving.

I risked a glance toward the gap between the floor and the bed frame. I could see his feet. They were bare, pale, the toenails long and jagged. He was pacing. Back and forth. Guarding the exit

I needed a plan.

The closet. If I could make it to the closet, there was a vent. An old HVAC intake that led to the basement. From there, I could squeeze through the dryer exhaust and escape into the night. I would starve for a few days, yes, but I would live. I could find a stray cat to scare, gather just enough strength to move to the next town.

But the closet was ten feet away. Ten feet of open ocean with a shark patrolling the surface.

I waited. Time in the Under-Dark is fluid, but I counted the rhythm of the house settling. The furnace kicked on, a low rumble that vibrated the floor.

Now.

The noise of the furnace would mask my movement.

I flowed. I didn't crawl; I poured myself forward like spilled ink, keeping flat, keeping silent. I reached the edge of the bed. The pacing feet had stopped near the door. He was blocking the hallway, but the closet was to the left.

I slid a single ocular tentacle out from under the bed skirt to check the perimeter.

The room was bathed in shadows, the moonlight casting long, skeletal shapes across the walls. Toys lay scattered on the floor, but they were wrong. A teddy bear with its eyes gouged out and replaced with marbles. A plastic soldier melted into a scream. A coloring book left open, the pages covered not in crayon, but in meticulous, scratching charcoal drawings of things that looked like me.

Toby was standing by the door. His back was to me. He was humming a song, a low, atonal melody that made my skin crawl. “Rock-a-bye baby, on the tree top... when the wind blows, the eyes will all pop...”

He was distracted.

I surged.

I shot out from under the bed, abandoning stealth for speed. I became a blur of smoke and claws, scrambling across the rug. The closet door was ajar. Just a crack. Enough for me.

I hit the gap and squeezed through, pulling my trailing tentacles in behind me. I collapsed onto the closet floor, surrounded by the smell of cedar and mothballs.

Safe.

I lay there for a moment, gasping, waiting for the door to be ripped open. Waiting for the scream.

Nothing.

The humming continued, uninterrupted. He hadn't seen me.

A laugh bubbled up in my throat, a hysterical, wet sound. I had done it. The Great Malaphis, the Night-Stalker, had outwitted a human child.

I turned toward the back wall, looking for the vent.

It was there. A rectangular grate near the floor, painted over with layers of white latex. I dug my claws into the screws. They were old, rusted into place, but my strength was returning with the adrenaline. I twisted. Metal shrieked. The screw popped.

I worked frantically. One screw. Two. The grate loosened. I could smell the basement air: musty, damp, glorious freedom.

I pulled the grate away and tossed it onto a pile of old shoes. The duct was dark, narrow, tighter than I liked, but I could fit. I shoved my head inside, dragging my shoulders through. The metal was cold against my belly.

I crawled. Ten feet. Twenty. The darkness here was absolute, but it was my darkness. It was empty. No pale boys. No biting teeth.

I rounded a bend in the ductwork, seeing a faint light ahead. The basement.

I scrambled faster, my hearts soaring. I would escape. I would go to the next county. I would find a nice, normal family with a child who slept with a nightlight and believed in Santa Claus. I would never, ever enter a house with a red door again.

I reached the end of the duct. A wire mesh blocked the exit, but it was flimsy. I lashed out with a claw, slicing through it like paper.

I tumbled out of the vent and hit the concrete floor.

I stood up, shaking off the dust, expanding to my full height. I stretched my limbs, letting the shadows coil around me, restoring my dignity.

"I am Malaphis," I whispered to the damp basement air, my voice gaining its old, gravelly resonance. "And I am free."

I looked around to get my bearings. I needed to find a window or the dryer vent.

The basement was large, unfinished. Concrete walls. Exposed insulation. In the center of the room sat a small wooden table.

And sitting at the table was a tea set.

My blood ran cold.

It was a plastic tea set. Pink and yellow. There were three chairs arranged around it.

In the first chair sat a stuffed rabbit, its head torn off and sewn back on backward.

In the second chair sat a creature... or what was left of one. It was a Grotesque, a cousin of my species. A bulky, stone-skinned haunter of attics. It was slumped over, its rocky hide cracked and glued together, its eyes replaced with shiny buttons. It was dead. Stuffed. Taxidermied.

The third chair was empty.

And on the plate in front of the empty chair was a name tag. Written in crayon.

**MALAPHIS**

I stared at the card, my mind refusing to process the geometry. I had crawled down. I had gone through the vents. I was in the basement.

**CLICK.**

The sound came from the top of the stairs.

The basement door opened. Light flooded down.

A silhouette stood at the top of the stairs. Small. Pajama-clad. Holding a flashlight.

"You cheated," Toby said. His voice echoed off the concrete.

I backed away, pressing myself against the cold cinderblock wall. "How..." I stammered. "I went through the vents. I..."

"All the vents go here," Toby said, taking a step down. CREAK. "The house knows I like to have tea parties. The house helps."

He wasn't a child. I saw it now. The shadow he cast on the stairs wasn't human. It was vast, many-limbed, and jagged. It stretched out behind him, climbing the walls, darker than the absence of light.

He took another step. "You broke the rules, Malaphis. You left the bedroom before the sun came up.

"Stay back!" I roared. I tried to make it terrifying. I flared my cowl, exposing my rows of serrated fangs. I summoned the psychic dread that stops human hearts.

Toby didn't blink. He just tilted his head. "Cute."

He reached into the pocket of his pajamas and pulled out something silver. It glinted in the flashlight beam.

A staple gun.

"Mr. Rock-Bottom kept falling out of his chair," Toby said, gesturing to the dead Grotesque at the table. "He wouldn't sit still for the tea. I had to fix him."

He descended the stairs. **THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.**

I looked for an exit. There were small windows high up, near the ceiling, but they were painted black. Barred.

"Please," I whimpered, my dignity shattering. "I'm old. I'm tired. I taste terrible. I'm all gristle and fear."

"I don't want to eat you," Toby said, reaching the bottom of the stairs. He smiled, and for a second, the skin didn't move right. It didn't wrinkle. It just stretched, pulling too tight across the bone, smooth and poreless like wet latex. "I told you. I want to play."

He walked toward the table. He patted the empty chair.

"Sit."

The command wasn't a word; it was a psychic hook that snagged my spine. My legs moved without my permission. I fought it, clawing at the air, my mind screaming RUN, but my body betrayed me. I walked stiffly, jerkily, like a marionette on invisible strings.

I approached the tea table. I smelled the Grotesque next to me. He smelled of sawdust and formaldehyde.

"Sit," Toby said again.

I sat. The tiny plastic chair groaned under my weight.

Toby climbed onto the table. He sat cross-legged in the center, towering over us. He picked up a plastic teapot. It was empty, but he poured from it anyway.

"Sugar?" he asked.

I couldn't speak. My jaw was clamped shut by terror.

"One lump then," he decided. He mimed dropping a cube into my cup.

He leaned in close. His face was inches from mine. I could see the pores in his skin. They were too uniform. Too perfect. Like synthetic rubber stretched over a frame.

"Mr. Rock-Bottom was boring," Toby whispered, glancing at the stuffed husk of the Grotesque. "He broke too fast. He stopped screaming after only two days."

Toby turned back to me. His blue eyes were swirling now, churning like a whirlpool.

"You look stronger, Malaphis. You look like you can last a whole week."

He raised the staple gun. He didn't point it at me. He pointed it at his own hand.

**THWACK.**

He fired a staple into his own palm. He didn't flinch. He didn't bleed. He just laughed, a sound like glass grinding in a disposal.

"Your turn," he giggled, handing me the gun.

My hand took it. I didn't want to take it. I tried to drop it.

"Play the game," the shadow on the wall whispered.

I looked at the staple gun. I looked at my own hand, the hand that had terrified generations.

"What happens if I win?" I choked out.

Toby grinned, and his teeth kept growing, pushing past his lips, long and gray and sharp.

"Then you get to be the teapot next time."

I put the gun to my palm. I looked at the empty plastic teapot on the tray. I looked at its spout, frozen in a silent scream. I wondered who used to sit in my chair.

The basement lights went out.

**THWACK.**
