I slipped out of The Shack as quietly as I could, comforted by the sound of Jeremy drunkenly snoring. 

Once outside, I snatched up the shovel and started digging into the Frog Graveyard. Knowing the results of my digging would be eerie, I took a look at the first  contents my shovel dug up – a few rocks etched with faded marker with the names of some of our long forgotten frog friends like Hopper and Daddy Long Legs and the scattered remnants of the tiny bones of the perished creatures. 

I shuddered for a moment, but went right back to digging until I felt my shovel hit something hard. I frantically dug up the object to see it was another rusted coffee can, this one included writing on top that read: *FOR JAME.*

I opened up the can to see a scattering of photos. Even just at first glance, I could tell they were disturbing. 

The pictures looked like those photos from those prisoners of war camps over in Iraq that leaked years ago, except the torturing guard was a 10-year-old Jeremy and the one being tortured was a 10-year-old Daniel. I cringed looking at the dirty photos all these years later and almost couldn't bear to see such a young, soft Daniel taking all of the embarrassing punishment from such a young Jeremy.

All was quiet and dark by the entrance to The Shack. All I could hear was a rising chorus of bullfrogs croaking into the night. I swallowed some nervous spit and headed back inside.

I looked at Jeremy's bed. It was just a scatter of crumpled blankets except for a foreign object I had not yet seen in The Shack – a video camera. I scooped up the video camera and pulled out the screen on the side of the camera where you could watch the footage that had been shot on it. 

I hit rewind on the camera and I saw a familiar scene I had stored in the back of my head as the darkest of secrets, but I was watching it from a different angle. Shot through the cracked view of a barely-open closet, I could see myself on top of Jeremy's now ex-wife, tangled in a passionate embrace bathed in mood lighting in my bedroom. The acidic sting of vomit rushed to the back of my throat as I watched our disgusting moment unfold on the little camera screen. 

I was going to throw the camera across the room, but it cut to a new scene. I pulled the screen closer to my eyes to try and make out what it was showing. It was very dark, shaky, but it eventually became clear – the video was shot out in the dark, looking through dirty windows into the candle lit heart of The Shack as Jeremy and I chuckled over drinks just hours ago. 

The video kept zooming in closer and closer to the both of us until it cut out and the screen before me went completely black. 

I dropped the camera to the floor and heard a rustle in the bushes outside. I saw a figure dart away in the dark out the window and wanted to fall to the floor myself, just like the camera, and give up on life, this was all just too much. 

But surrender would not be an option, the scent of burning wood and the sound of crackling kindling grabbed my attention. I turned around to see The Shack starting to catch fire back by my bed. From my vantage, I could see the fire was spreading from an old, printed out photo of Jeremy, Daniel, and me standing in front of our elementary school, our arms around each other. 

The fire quickly picked up momentum. I had no other option other than to run out of The Shack or burn to death in the thing like a log thrown into a fireplace. I dashed for the door.

The soundtrack of the croaking frogs had magically vanished when I stepped outside. I was calm, all was still, not a sound lingered on the wind. 

I heard a stick snap behind me. I tried to whirl around, but stopped when I felt a hard object ram up against the back of my head. 

"Don't move," I recognized the voice that barked the command even though I hadn't heard it for nearly 20 years. 

The object stuck to the back of my head led me backwards until I was facing the wood of the door to The Shack. 

"Daniel," I started to plead.

"Don't try to beg me now. You forgot about me years ago."

He nudged me closer to the door. 

"What were we supposed to do? You did what you wanted."

"Open the door."

"Come on Daniel."

I felt the object dig deeper into my scalp and I reluctantly opened up the door. The back half of The Shack was engulfed in flames and they were licking closer and closer with each second I watched them. 

"Inside."

I stepped in. 

"Don't try to act like you're a good friend now. I showed Jeremy what you did. And he can't say he is either. You know what he did. You know why I am why I am."

"I'm sure that's not all why Daniel. We always tried to help you."

I stared at the flames approaching me as Daniel yelled back into my ear. 

"You're not a good friend, admit it."

"You're right, I'm not."

"And neither is Jeremy."

"He's not."

"But I want to test him. See if he has any shred of hope that he won't do to you what you two did to me, torture and abandon me, and not forgive me for the mistakes I made."

"Daniel, we didn't...

He cut me off with another hard thump on the back of the head and put his lips upon my ear, tickling me with the stubble of his beard. 

"He's the only one who can save you now. Better hope he is a better friend to you then you two were to me."

Before his words could sink in, Daniel pushed me towards the approaching fire and he was back out the door before I could turn around to catch a glimpse of him. I ran up to the door, tried to open it, but he must have managed to lock it tightly from the outside. 

I scrambled around, looking for other ways to get out, but had no options, the only windows were in the back of The Shack where the fire was blazing, there was no getting through the fire alive and I couldn't find any kind of ax to break down the walls. Daniel had truly created a test, the only way I was getting out alive was if Jeremy was out there and came back to rescue me. 

The heat from the flames quickly became almost unbearable, I went back to the door and tried to do whatever I could with my own body weight to open it up, but didn't have even the slightest bit of luck and the flames kept getting closer and closer. I tried and tried until my energy reserves were empty and I fell down upon the ground with my back to the door. I watched the flames keep dancing towards me. 

I closed my eyes. 

Then I heard the sound of wood splintering right next to my head. I opened my eyes and looked to the right to see a rusty ax head resting inches from my skull. The ax sent shards of wood at my face when it pulled back out and slammed back into the wood of the door.

A few more cracks at the door opened the holes up enough to where I could recognize Jeremy working to knock the hole open enough so I could crawl out.

One more crack and I ran at the door and pushed myself through the broken wood without abandon, the jagged edges of the wood slicing all over my body, drawing fresh blood. 

Once back outside in the forest, Jeremy glanced at me only for a second before breaking eye contact. 

With The Shack evaporating into flames behind us, we took off down a crude path that cut into the dark woods. We fought against the stray branches, leaves, bushes, and mud puddles, which crossed our path with my eyes constantly sweeping my horizon, expecting to see the horrid image of Daniel running at us, but his vision would not come.

We eventually stopped when I heard the blue roar of the river ahead of us through the trees and Jeremy ran up to a falling-apart cabin that looked a lot like the one we had just fled. He was inside for just moments before he emerged with a hard plastic raft.

Jeremy and I lugged the raft down to the banks of the river.We pushed the raft into the shallow waters of the river and jumped on. 

I hunkered down once we set sail in the moonlight and tried to get my breath back. It would take a while, but eventually my heart would stop racing, my lungs would stop burning, and my brain would calm and when that happened, I slowly drifted off into a cold sleep. 

\*

I woke up shivering in a swampy marsh I had never seen before. I had no idea how long I had been out, but morning had just risen, and I could smell the faintest hint of the salt of the sea, which told me we had traveled a long, long, safe distance from Daniel, and the madness of the shack. 

I looked over to see Jeremy still asleep, a knife clutched in his hand. I let out a deep breath and stretched out over the edge of the raft. 

We had washed up against a soggy shore. I starred at its muddy riverbank until I saw something moving in the thick clay that caught my attention.

Things were not good. They weren't even okay. There was a long ways to go from there, but I was alive. 

Three little frogs, so small and young, they would probably fit on the tip of your finger. I watched them sit together, just at the edge of the lapping water until one sprang away and the other two followed.
