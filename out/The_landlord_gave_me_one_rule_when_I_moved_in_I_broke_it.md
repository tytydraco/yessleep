When I moved into this building, I thought I’d finally caught a break. Rent in this city is brutal. Between my dead-end job and my divorce bleeding me dry, I’d been one bad month away from sleeping in my car. So when I saw the listing for a one-bedroom at less than half the going rate, I didn’t even think. I called, signed, and moved in within the week. The place was… rough. The hallway smelled like mildew and cigarettes that had been smoked thirty years ago but never left. The wallpaper peeled in strips like dead skin. The elevator had an “Out of Order” sign that looked permanent. 

But it was mine. The landlord, Mr. Kerr, was a wiry man with eyes too big for his face, and he shook when he handed me the keys. Not from age, he wasn’t that old. More like nerves. He had a way of talking fast, like someone afraid of being interrupted. He told me the usual things, trash chute at the end of the hall, laundry in the basement, maintenance requests on a slip of paper under his door. Then he stopped, cleared his throat, and leaned in closer. “One more thing,” he said. His voice went soft. “Don’t knock on 6B after midnight. No matter what you hear. No matter what you see.” 

I gave him a look, waiting for the punchline. He didn’t laugh. He just repeated it, slower this time “Don’t knock. On 6C. After midnight.” I nodded just to get him off my back, but inside I was already rolling my eyes. Maybe it was a crazy tenant. Maybe some recluse who worked night shifts and didn’t want to be bothered. I didn’t care. I had a door that locked and a place to sleep. That was enough. That night, I lay awake longer than I wanted, staring at the ceiling. My new neighbors’ footsteps creaked above me. Pipes clanged like hollow bones. The city outside hummed with life. Then, faintly, through the walls

…knock. 

…knock. 

Two slow raps. Not at my door. Further down the hall. Room 6B. I held my breath. And that’s when I heard it, something inside knocking back. I told myself I imagined it. Old buildings echo, pipes bang, neighbors slam doors at odd hours, it could’ve been anything. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t. Because the knock had a rhythm. A pattern. Like a conversation. 

Knock.   
 …   
 Knock. 

And the reply, softer, muffled, but definitely there, carried the same cadence. The next morning, in the gray light of my kitchen, I almost convinced myself it hadn’t happened. But when I left for work and walked past 6B, I slowed down. The door was… plain. Cheap wood, painted beige, the number peeling. No decorations. No welcome mat. But standing there, I felt the hair on my arms rise. Like the air in front of the door was heavier than the rest of the hallway. I didn’t linger. 

Over the next week, I settled in. Work, home, sleep, repeat. But the knocks came back. Not every night. Not at the same time. Just often enough that I started waiting for them. Always after midnight. 6B always answered. Once, I pressed my ear to my wall, straining. “Please…” I swear I heard a voice. Hoarse. Tired. Begging. I jerked back like I’d been shocked. My heart was hammering so loud I thought someone would hear. The next day, I asked the landlord about it. 

He stiffened instantly. His hand trembled as he adjusted his glasses. “Don’t,” he said. “Don’t talk about 6B. Don’t think about it. Just… leave it alone.” He didn’t explain. He didn’t need to. His whole body told me enough: this wasn’t a joke. This wasn’t a story. This was fear. That night, I locked my door twice. And at 12:17 AM, someone started knocking again. But this time… it wasn’t at 6B. It was at mine. The first knock was soft. So faint I thought I dreamed it. But then came the second. Louder. Closer. 

Knock. 

.......

Knock. 

At my door. I froze in bed, covers bunched up under my chin. My phone glowed on the nightstand, but I didn’t dare reach for it. The landlord’s words pounded in my skull 'Don’t knock on 6B after midnight.' He hadn’t said anything about 6B knocking back. The third knock rattled the wood. A little longer, more impatient. I swallowed hard and forced myself to sit up. The apartment was dark except for the faint orange glow bleeding in through the blinds. My throat was dry. My legs felt like cement. “Hello?” My voice cracked, thin and useless. Silence. I waited, heart thudding. Then 

Knock. Knock. Knock. Knock. Knock.

Faster this time. I swung my legs over the bed and crept toward the door, every step screaming don’t do this. The peephole was a black circle in the middle of the door. I hesitated, then pressed my eye against it. The hallway stretched empty. Shadows pooled in the corners. But there was no one outside. Just the door to 6B. And as I stared, I saw the knob on 6B twitch. Just once. Like someone had tried it and let go. I staggered back, breath sharp in my chest. Then, faintly, from behind that door: “…let me in.” 

The next morning, I barely managed to drag myself out of bed. My eyes burned, my chest felt hollow, and I swore I could still hear the knocks echoing inside my skull. I wasn’t going to say anything. Not to anyone. But when I stepped into the hallway, I caught my neighbor across the way staring at 6B like it had just whispered her name. She was older, maybe late fifties, wiry gray hair pulled into a bun. She noticed me watching and quickly looked down at her grocery bags. 

“You hear it too,” she muttered. Not a question. I stopped. “What?” Her eyes flicked to the door, then back to me. “The knocking. You heard it.” I opened my mouth, closed it. She gave me a smile that wasn’t really a smile at all. “Don’t answer. Don’t speak to it. And whatever you do, don’t knock back.” Before I could respond, she slipped into her apartment and shut the door. That night, I stayed up again. Sat on my couch with the TV on mute, trying to act like I wasn’t waiting for it. 

12:03.   
 12:11.   
 12:29. 

Then it came. 

Knock.   
 …   
 Knock. 

At 6B. I held my breath. Silence stretched. And then, a new sound

Knock.

......

 Knock. 

From the other side of my wall. Right where my head would’ve been if I’d been lying in bed. I bolted upright, stumbling into the middle of the room, staring at the plaster like I could see through it. And in the silence that followed, I realized something that made my stomach twist, It wasn’t trying to get out of 6B. It was trying to get in. The following day, I caught the landlord on the front steps, fumbling with his keys. “You didn’t tell me it knocks on other doors,” I said before I could stop myself. He froze. His face drained like someone had pulled a plug. 

“Don’t.” His voice cracked. He stepped closer, almost whispering. “Don’t talk about it out loud. Don’t give it your attention. That’s what it wants.” “What’s in there?” I asked. He just shook his head, his eyes darting to the building like we were being watched. “No one lives in 6B. No one’s lived there for years. You understand?” I wanted to press him. To demand an explanation. But his fear was so raw, so obvious, that I just nodded. That night, I tried to drown it out with music. Headphones in, volume up. Anything to stop me from listening for the inevitable. But when 12:20 came, I felt it anyway. The vibration through the floorboards. The rattle in the glass on the counter. 

Knock.   
 …   
 Knock. 

Even through the music. Even through my own pulse. And then came the whisper. Right against my wall. “…please…” I ripped the headphones off. My apartment was silent. The kind of silence that feels staged. Heavy. Waiting. Then

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. 

Relentless. Violent. Shaking my door in its frame. My heart slammed against my ribs. I backed into the kitchen, too scared to breathe. And then it stopped. The silence after was worse than the knocking. I crept back toward the peephole, every nerve screaming don’t look. But I did. And this time, I saw something. A hand. Pale, too long, fingers splayed wide across the wood of 6B’s door. Pressing. Trembling. And then, slowly… it knocked again. From the inside. 

I wasn’t the only one losing sleep. By the end of that week, the whole floor looked like ghosts. Hollow eyes, jittery hands, doors opening and closing fast so no one had to linger in the hallway. Everyone knew about 6B. No one wanted to talk about it. Except one. His name was Derrick, early twenties, always smelled like weed, the kind of guy who thought rules were made just to see what happened when you broke them. He lived two doors down from me. I ran into him outside the building, both of us pretending not to look at the dark windows of 6B. 

“You hear it too, huh?” he said, smirking. “Man, this place is weird. I’m gonna figure out what’s in there.” “You shouldn’t,” I said, too fast. He grinned wider. “Come on, dude. It’s just some crazy old shut-in. What’s the worst that happens? They yell at me?” That night, I barely slept. At 12:15, the knocking started again, steady and patient. 

Knock.   
 …   
 Knock. 

But this time, footsteps joined it. Heavy, slow, dragging. Coming from Derrick’s apartment. My stomach dropped. I pressed my ear to the wall, every muscle tight. I heard him shuffle down the hall, muttering to himself, voice slurred with that lazy confidence only drunk idiots get. “Alright, let’s see who’s home…” The knocks from 6B went silent. And then Derrick knocked back. Three sharp raps. “Yo, open up!” The hallway went dead quiet. Even the pipes stopped creaking. I held my breath. From behind 6B’s door came the sound of something shifting. Slow. Heavy. Like furniture being dragged across concrete. Then a single knock in reply. Derrick laughed. “Oh, hell yeah.” 

The knob turned. I didn’t even know 6B’s door could open. I’d never seen it move. But I heard the hinges scream, felt the rush of air like the building itself exhaled. Derrick’s laugh cut off mid-breath. Silence. Then the door slammed shut. Hard enough that my walls shook. I waited. One minute. Two. Five. Derrick never came back. By morning, everyone knew. His door stood wide open, lights still on, TV humming to itself. Couch cushions tossed, a beer can tipped on the floor. But Derrick was gone. No one said his name. No one wanted to. 

When the landlord came up, he didn’t even bother stepping inside. Just looked once, pale and sweating, and pulled the door shut behind him. He didn’t lock it. Didn’t put up a notice. Just muttered, “One less,” like it was a number on a list. The cops never came. Nobody reported him missing. But that night, when the knocking started, it sounded different. Heavier. Louder. And underneath it, I could swear I heard a voice. “Yo… open up…” Derrick’s voice. I pressed both hands to my ears, rocking in bed, whispering to myself: it’s not him, it’s not him, it’s not him. 

But the knocking followed me. Through the wall. Down the hall. At my door. And when I checked the peephole, I nearly screamed. Because Derrick was standing there. Or something that looked like him. His face was wrong. The features blurred, smudged like wet paint, the eyes too wide and staring straight into the peephole. His body twitched like a puppet pulled by tangled strings. “Let me in, bro,” he croaked. “It’s cold.” I stumbled back, heart slamming against my ribs. Then, from 6B’s door, came a sound like laughter. Low. Hollow. 

And Derrick, or what was left of him, jerked his head toward it before vanishing. Not walked away. Not turned. Vanished. Like he’d been yanked backward through an invisible curtain. The hallway went empty again. And 6B stood quiet. Waiting. I didn’t wait until morning. I stormed straight down to the landlord’s unit, fists pounding on his door until he cracked it open. His eyes were wild. Sunken. Like he hadn’t slept in weeks. “You knew,” I hissed. “You knew Derrick was gone. What the hell is in there?” For a long moment he just stared at me, lips trembling, hands gripping the frame like if he let go, he’d fall apart. Then, finally, he opened the door and motioned me inside. 

His apartment was bare. Too bare. No pictures, no books, no TV. Just a table, a chair, and a stack of worn notebooks. The blinds were nailed shut. He sat heavily in the chair, rubbing his temples. “You think I put up that rule for fun?” he said. His voice was low, bitter. “You think I like losing tenants?” I said nothing. He opened one of the notebooks, yellowed pages filled with cramped handwriting. The first entry was dated 1979. “It’s been here longer than me,” he said. “Longer than anyone alive now, I think. The man who owned this place before me warned me the same way I warned you. Don’t knock. Don’t answer. Don’t listen.” 

“What is it?” He shook his head. “It’s not a person. Not anymore. It… wears people. Like clothes. That room, it’s a door it shouldn’t have. And once it opens, someone always goes missing.” I swallowed hard, bile rising in my throat. “So why not brick it up? Burn the place down? Something?” His eyes snapped to mine, sharp with a kind of desperate anger. “You think I haven’t tried? You think others haven’t? Every time someone interferes, it spreads. Once it was just 6B. Then it was the whole floor. Then the building across the street. Always knocking. Always asking. Always waiting for someone dumb enough to open the door.” 

He leaned forward, gripping my wrist so tight it hurt. “Don’t be that someone. Do you understand me? Don’t be the one who breaks the rule.” I yanked free, my heart hammering. Because I couldn’t tell him that the rule was already broken. And it was still knocking. That night, I tried everything. Headphones. Sleeping pills. Even stuffing towels under the door. But nothing dulled it. The knocks came sharper, closer, hungrier. 

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. 

Each one rattled the picture frames on my wall, shook dust from the ceiling. It wasn’t just 6B anymore. The sound was everywhere. Above me. Beneath me. Inside me. And then, at 12:47, my doorknob turned. I bolted upright in bed. My door shuddered as if someone were trying to twist it off its hinges. I staggered into the living room, every nerve screaming. The peephole showed only darkness. Not shadows, not an empty hall, just… black. Like the other side of my door had been swallowed. Then I heard it. 

“…please… it’s cold…” 

Derrick’s voice. Thin. Warped. Coming from everywhere at once. I stumbled back straight into the wall. And the wall knocked back. Three booming raps, inches from my spine. I couldn’t take it anymore. The fear, the sleepless nights, the constant waiting for the next sound. I had to end it. Before I could talk myself out of it, I ripped open my door and staggered into the hallway. It was empty, except for 6B. Its door was wide open. A black void yawned beyond it, swallowing the flickering light of the hallway. The edges of the frame seemed to breathe, warping with every exhale. And inside the dark, something moved. Slowly. Too slowly. 

A shape stretched thin, like a man drawn in charcoal and smudged by a careless hand. Its limbs bent wrong. Its head lolled as though the neck was broken. And its hands, its hands were pressed flat against the inside of the doorway, long fingers curling along the frame. It leaned forward, and I swear I heard every neighbor’s voice whispering in unison

Knock. Knock. 

The sound echoed in my skull, vibrating my teeth. Then, all at once, every door on the floor flew open. And in every doorway stood another shape. Each one wearing the blurred, shifting face of someone I hadn’t seen in days. Derrick. The old woman. Tenants who’d vanished without notice. All of them staring at me. All of them whispering together

“Let us in.” 

 I don’t remember how long I stood there. Seconds. Hours. Time bent in that hallway, stretched thin until it snapped. The figures didn’t move closer. They just waited. Patient. Smiling faces that weren’t faces at all, shifting like reflections on black water. I backed into my apartment and slammed the door, locked it, shoved the dresser in front. My heart jackhammered against my ribs. My breath came in shallow gasps. But the knocks followed. From the walls. The ceiling. The floor. A thousand knuckles rapping in perfect unison. I don’t sleep anymore. Not really. I close my eyes, but I still hear it. Every night. Louder, heavier, closer. 

The landlord hasn’t been seen in days. His door is wide open, the notebooks scattered on the floor like someone rifled through them in a hurry. The last page just says 'If you’re reading this, it’s already too late.' I think he’s right. Because last night, something changed. The knocks didn’t come from 6B. They came from inside my apartment. The kitchen cupboard. The bathroom mirror. The closet door. 

Knock. Knock. 

I don’t know how long I can last. The walls feel thinner every hour. The air heavier. Like the building itself is hollow, waiting to cave in. I’m writing this because maybe, just maybe, if I tell someone, if I put it into words, it won’t get any closer. But even as I type, I can see the shadows stretching across the floor. Long fingers curling toward my chair. And somewhere, very close to my ear, a voice is whispering the same two words, over and over. 

Knock. Knock.
