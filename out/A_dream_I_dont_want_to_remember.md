Had my first ever true nightmare last night.

———

Context: I’m 29, a normal dude, happily married for 3 years. My wife is from an affluent area and  she has a lot of rich friends and is always meeting new friends.

I went to bed at 2am, woke up at 4am when my dream got to the climax. Usually, I won’t dream if I don’t enter REM sleep, and REM sleep usually happens for me about 5 hours into sleeping.

The dream started with my wife and I being invited up to LA to visit the mansion of my wife’s new friend.

This friend is very charismatic, pretty, and fun so my wife naturally gravitates towards her.

I was hesitant to go because she would have friends we hadn’t met yet and I didn’t really trust that the girl was well-intentioned or not.

But I figured if I were there that everything would be fine, so I agreed we could go.

When we got there, it was immediately very odd.

We were greeted by a beautiful old woman who insisted on giving me a tour of the mansion alone while my wife was directed to the living room where her friend was.

She said a lot of concerning things to me on this tour, specifically about p*rn and how her house is used for group s*x.

She showed me weird rooms where people had committed su*cide and given birth.

I was obviously uncomfortable and demanded that we end the “tour” so I could go be with my wife.

She obliged and brought me to the room where all the friends were.

She opened the door and like a true horror movie, all of the friends (6 of them - 4 girls and 2 guys) were eyes wide, big smiles, staring at me as I walk up to them, like they’ve been patiently waiting for me.

Things were pretty normal at first as I met everyone. They were all nice. But things quickly got weird when one of the dudes started talking to me about how they all do p*rn together.

He was telling me how cool and progressive he thought I was to offer my wife up to them and that I was about to have the best night of my life with him and these new girls.

This obviously threw me off, because there was never even an ounce of belief or mention that we would be doing this today.

I set my boundaries immediately with everyone and addressed that we would not be doing this and I wouldn’t be sharing my wife with anyone, no matter what.

This is when things turned.

I noticed my wife wasn’t in the room, and the other man was missing.

I asked where my wife was and the guy said “she’s having the best night of her life.”

I obviously got angry at this and lashed out at the group, but was more perplexed because I knew my wife wouldn’t even want to do that (we have a great s*x life irl).

That’s when they told me that I didn’t have a choice in the matter, that my wife had agreed and was excited to be “their’s now”.

I immediately went into fight mode at this statement, but I couldn’t move. I was frozen to the chair I was sitting in.

This is when the group s*x started. I yelled and screamed for my wife, wherever she was, but no one cared. They all just continued.

The peril and despair I felt in that moment as I thought I had been dr*gged and was now being r*ped, and who knows what was happening to my wife.

A few moments later, the older woman came into the room.

She leaned down, got close to my face and smiled, showing me her rotten teeth. I remember her breath smelled of rotten eggs.

As a religious person, I immediately thought of her as a demon and these people must have been the cult worshippers that brought her into the physical world.

She whispered one sentence in my ear that sent me into a nightmare within a nightmare: “you were an easy target”.

She took me through the past few months of my life, where my reality was shown to be the complete opposite of what I experienced.

She showed me this altered reality where I had been self-destructing. Got fired from work, ruined all of my relationships, and neglected all of my finances.

She showed me my dejected and neglected wife and showed me abusing her, with her telling her friends that she wanted to leave me, but was too scared of me.

This was a horror I could not measure. At that moment, I was convinced that I was a targeted individual and had been under a brainwashing program like MKUltra that completely altered my reality and the perception of myself.

As I came back to, everyone was staring at me, still performing s*x acts.

I asked “are you going to k*ll me?”

They all chuckled, and the guy said “no, you’re going to k*ll us”.

I simply replied “no I’m not.”

He smiled and said “it’s already done.”

He pulled out his phone and showed me tomorrow’s news.

He showed me my name and face in the headlines; “Man m*rders his wife and six others at Hollywood s*x party.” and “Family and friends of mass m*rderer speak about his decline into paranoid schizophrenia.”

My heart sank. I realized at that moment I had been being targeted for months, had my reality completely manipulated, and was helpless at the whims of this demonic cult.

In the next moment of the dream, I look around the room and everyone is de*d… brutally m*rdered as I stand over them.

Horrified, confused, and panicked I looked towards the door and saw the old lady standing probably ten feet tall, hunched over to fit in the doorway, smiling literally ear to ear.

Like any horror movie and nightmare she jolted  towards me.

That’s when I woke up sweating next to my peacefully sleeping wife.

It was 4am, meaning it only took 2 hours for me to have this mind-blowingly vivid dream that genuinely felt real.

I’ve never dreamt like that before. I’ve always had vivid dreams, but they’re only ever confusing or simple. I don’t even think I’ve ever had a nightmare before honestly… until last night.

Has anyone else had a nightmare like this?
