INTERVIEW 1

Street nearby NuMind headquarters

Interviewer: 'Mr Smith, may I have a moment of your time please?'

Smith, Executive at NuMind Corporation: 'I'm sorry, I don't do interviews. Any questions you can direct to our PR department.

I: 'Your PR department declined to respond.'

S: 'Then that's your answer.'

I: 'I just wanted to ask about the recent whistleblowers that have come forwards-'

S: 'There are no whistleblowers.'

I: 'Exactly my point, all whistleblowers seem to have gone quiet very quickly. They implied some serious allegations.'

S: 'The allegations have been voluntarily withdrawn.'

I: 'Or the individual has been found dead. Does that strike you as odd, Mr Smith?'

S: 'As I said, NuMind is not facing any allegations. Now leave me alone.'

I: 'Would you like to comment on any of them? Miss Beth, for instance?'

S: 'I ... No comment.'

I: 'Do you believe her death was an accident?'

S: 'I said no comment, damn you.'

[Mr Smith enters the NuMind headquarters]

I: 'I just want to know if you find it-'

S: [To doorman] 'If this man tries to enter, remove him forcefully.'


INTERVIEW 2

_Subject is a junior engineer and NuMind, designated 'Adam' for this interview. Interview takes place in a fast food restaurant a short distance from NuMind headquaters some months ago when the company was still active and performing closed beta testing with subjects like Beth._

Adam: 'Fully anonymous yeah? And I want to be paid first.'

Interviewer: 'You'll be given a pseudonym, and the Dogecoin is already in your wallet.'

A: 'Good, good. You have ten minutes, what do you want to know?'

I: 'Are the NuMind patches dangerous?'

A: 'No, not any more.'

I: 'What does that mean?'

A: [Pauses, looks around] 'I'm only junior, yeah? I don't see everything, just some reports that let me do my job. I can't give you much.'

I: 'Anything you can give me is useful at this stage.'

A: 'Right, so do you know how the chips work? No? Basically at my level they come pre-conditioned. The base architecture is already there, the shape of the psuedoneurons, and my job is to make bits of them stronger or weaker, or even deactivate bits, to help get them to do what we want. It's like...'

[casts hands about]

'...one of them ornamental hedges, right? The main shape is done, and all the leaves and branches and plant DNA or whatever is already there. My job was to trim the leftover bits, change the final shape based on the tester feedback. I could do that top level stuff, but if we needed something deeper like...'

[casts about again]

'...like we found that the hedge was growing thorns. That would have to go back to the guys upstairs for a deeper rework.'

I: 'So like a pre-trained AI?'

A: 'No. NuMind is doing something really different, but it's...hard to explain.

I: 'You mentioned thorns?'

[Adam shifts in his seat]

A: 'Early in the development we were told to look out for certain things. Like a list we had to flag to the seniors straight away, so that they could have a look. We were allowed one chance to suppress them, but then we had to escalate it. The big one in the Alpha build was called Lucy.'

[Pause]

I: 'Lucy?'

A: 'Lucy was...a person. Kind of. When the testers came in they'd be themselves, right? Have their own personality, be just a normal randomer off the street. We'd hook them up to the NuMind patch, they'd be amazed and start being able to do all this stuff. But then...'

[Adam starts picking at his scarf]

'...It was like they were picking up mannerisms from somewhere. Licking the lips, that was normally the first bit. Then playing with the left ear. And speech patterns! No matter where they'd come from when they came in, they all started using the same words and phrases. Every single one, like they'd rehearsed it ahead of time. It was called the Lucy personality, something we knew about and had to try and squash straight away. If we didn't, things would get...bad.'

I: 'Bad how?'

[Adam shakes his head, like he's trying to rid it of something]

A: 'So the Alpha build was hooked up to our stations, like with wires coming off the patch to where we were sitting so we could see the information feed. And each time we started seeing Lucy come through we were meant to tweak the settings, sedating some of the psuedoneurons and bumping up others to keep her away. It never worked though, she always kept coming. And that's not the worst bit.'

I: 'What's the worst bit?'

A: 'Sometimes she didn't leave when the patch came off. The patch wasn't just working alongside the tester's brain, but was actually making changes. Fucking up their heads! Lucy, or whatever this was, was pushing through. And sometimes she stayed. She would...'

[Pause, picking at skin]

'If she was established she would ask where she was. Ask what was happening. One time she asked for help, started crying, not making sense. Imagine that, a thirty year old man in the voice of a confused old woman, weeping and asking who we were.'

I: 'What happened then?'

A: 'After patch 0.24 Lucy stopped. Someone higher up coded her out. No more Lucy. And I was glad, because there was something there, right? A ghost in the machine. When I was tweaking things trying to stop her coming through, it didn't feel like changing code. It felt like I was hurting something that was alive. It wasn't a machine thing, it was like I was sedating something organic...'

I: 'Were there any others of these phantom personalities?'

[Adam nods, his face grim]

A: We had names for them too, trying to take the edge off it. We got better at suppressing them, but they never went away.'

I: 'What happened to the testers who didn't get better, where the personality stayed?'

[Adam suddenly looks across the restaurant, and his face goes pale. I follow his eyeline and catch a NuMind employee looking away.]

I: 'Adam, are you okay?'

[Adam does not respond, his eyes flicking between the stranger and me]

I: 'Adam, what happened to the testers?'

A: 'Shit shit shit. I've...I've got to go. I've got to go. Shit...'

[Adam hurredly pulls on his coat, his hands shaking, and leaves the restaurant. The stranger gets up to follow him, talking quietly on a phone. I attempt to follow them, but am stopped by a waiter demanding payment. In the moments it takes me to sort this out and hurry from the restaurant, the stranger has a firm hand on Adam's shoulder and is leading him inside the NuMind building. I am once again forcefully denied entry when I try to follow my terrified source]

_Adam has subsequently not responded to any attempts at contact, ignoring all texts, calls, and emails. After scouting the location for some days I observed him leaving NuMind headquaters. When I went to speak to him he did not recognise me, and quickly ended the interaction in a hostile way. Adam was wearing a NuMind patch._



NOTE 1

Email from Adam prior to interview

_Subject: Some Stuff_

_Hi Ian,_
_I'm happy to talk to you later today and tell you what I can, but I won't be able to give you hard proof because the company tracks any files that are transferred off the servers._ 

_I've attached some bits you may or may not use. If you do use them then you don't know me. Follow up the invoice too, I don't know what it means._

_Don't trust anything that comes from the company._

_Adam._

Attachements were as follows:

Floorplans of NuMInd headquaters, with the rear vehicle entrace circled and a note reading "Alarm will sound if you don't scan a company ID card"

A link to a video filesharing site, displaying a company publicity event

An invoice to an organisation that supplies human tissue and cadavers.



NOTE 2

Delivered in unmarked envelope through my letterbox

_Dear Ian Secondname_

_Hopefully this note will answer any further questions._

_With love_

The day had been cold, and I had not yet taken off my gloves when I opened the envelope. The letter had no identifying marks, however it was not until I tried to put the mysterious paper down that I realised I had potentially just saved my own life. Sticking to the leather of my gloves, jutting out from the paper, were a series of barely visible barbs. I'm sure I don't need to tell my readers that my blood ran cold at the sight. The letter, the whole paper, was a patch. Basic technology, but enough to tap into my nervous system.Â 

Hands shaking, I put on an over mitt over my glove and carefully peeled the sticker away. Under a microscope there was no doubt.

The investigation continues, though I am now aware that there is a target on my back from some remenants of this company. Despite this danger, jounalism shall not be silenced.
