There was an abandoned ship in my town.

Looking back now, of course it couldn’t have been abandoned; some company had to own it, had to have paid for it to be towed there and had to be paying for the slip at which it sat. It wasn’t so easy to find these things out back in the day, though. I couldn’t Google it, and I never would have known who to ask, so all I could be sure of was what I saw- and what I saw looked pretty well abandoned. (And speaking of Google, it’s one of the reasons I know a lot more now than I did then. I’ll be using proper ship-words when I tell this story, but please don’t take this to mean I knew much of anything about ships at the time. I didn’t, except that they floated and carried important things.)

I’d been noticing it for a few years, because I could just about see it from the on-ramp of the highway that I took to go and visit my parents. Nowadays they call freighters like it “classics”, because there are so few of them left, but back then they were dirt common. I saw them from a distance almost every day, coming and going in the harbour. As far as I could tell, the only interesting thing about this one was that it never moved at all.

It's easy to start taking things for granted when your routine never changes. In my case the change that started all the trouble was a new job.

I interviewed at an office downtown for a position at a warehouse in the industrial part of town. The first time I drove into work, down gravel roads I'd never seen despite living here for the better part of a decade, it occurred to me that I was very near to the water.

A minute later I saw it.

It was only a second's glimpse, at the far end of a side road that I was past in an instant, but it drew my eye and lingered like an afterimage: a wall of grey, streaked with faded vertical stripes where time and rain had worn channels into the paint, and a flash of a rust-speckled black smokestack. Just enough time to catch a handful of details, but those details filled in the broad strokes I’d been seeing all along from up on the bridge. All of a sudden it was more real than it had been before.

The next day at lunch I asked one of my new coworkers about it.

“The what?” he replied around a mouthful of tuna sandwich.

“The ship, just down the road and around the corner from here.” I gestured in that general direction. “Do you know how long it's been there?”

“Oh, that thing. It's always been there- least, as long as I can remember.” He paused to ponder this, then added, “Twenty years for sure. Maybe longer.”

I nodded as though my curiosity had been minor. To him this clearly made it uninteresting- it had just always been there, like a strange and not especially pretty rock formation- but not to me. There was a very bad idea coalescing in my head.

The day after that, I got up early and took the long way in, down the sideroad that ran right along the water. The ship was visible ahead for a full mile, bathed in the light of the sunrise; no part of it was shiny enough to sparkle or flash, so it glowed orange instead, and shapes emerged from the glow as I approached. First the outline of the pilothouse, then the long line of the hull behind, and finally the sharp angle of the bow looming high above the water. It wasn't until I pulled up next to it- or as close as I could get, with a chain fence and wide expanse of battered concrete between us- that I could blink away the glare and take it all in at once.

It was huge. I'd been right in my initial impression of it as a wall. Six hundred feet long, and there had to be forty feet of that wall above the water, looking ancient and solid as petrified wood. It made me wonder whether they were all this big- none of the ones I’d seen from up on the bridge had seemed anything like this- and even though I now know that it was small compared to them, I still can’t quite believe it.

At the top of the wall I could see strands of green that had taken root where dirt had blown in over the years. The windows of the pilothouse had been covered over in the same pale cream as the rest of the structure, and looked like nothing so much as closed eyes. Just below, a heavy rope held the sleeping giant in place, looped around a flaking bollard.

The bad idea was solidifying.

I wish I had an excuse. I wish I could say I was young and stupid, but I was closer to thirty than twenty. I wish I could say that I had a really good reason, but when I look back on it I know I didn’t have a reason at all. Looking at the ship up close, I simply had the undeniable feeling that all the time I’d spent taking it for granted, not really noticing it, had been time wasted- time I ought to make up for, now.

I waited until Sunday, for purely practical reasons, consumed by impatience the entire time. Then, Sunday evening, I set out from home on my bike with nothing but a flashlight and a folding knife, and pedalled down side streets in the dark.

I parked the bike against a warehouse fence a block away and walked up. It was a bad idea, but I’d thought it through.

It looked even more ancient in the dark. Behind and below it, unseen, the waters of the harbour lapped gently at the concrete. In the relative quiet of the evening, I could even hear the creaking of the ship itself.

The fence was easy to climb. The rope was very difficult. I’d overdressed, anticipating the cool late-summer breeze from the lake, and by the time I managed to haul myself up those forty feet I was sweating like a pig and my sweater was covered in moss that had flaked away from the rope. I swung a leg over and flopped onto my back on the deck. Rust and dirt crunched below my shoulders.

When I sat up, the city was far away. The deck was all around me, a long row of hatches stretching away to the stern where the stack stood, silhouetted by the city lights. I took it all in for a moment, feeling no sense of danger. No one was going to catch me here. No one cared. Atop the hatch immediately beside me, a patch of grass waved lazily in the breeze to prove it.

I stood up, touched it and turned towards the bow.

I had all night- why not start at the start?

There was a staircase on the outside of the superstructure, and it creaked and settled as I climbed it. The higher above the deck I got- the more of the ship that was below me- the more I could hear it, creaking and whispering like a house settling endlessly.

The door to the pilothouse wasn’t locked. I reached into my pocket for the knife, expecting to have to jimmy it, but the handle turned under my hand and the door swung open with a shriek.

The darkness inside was absolute, and the smell was powerful; it didn’t waft out but hit me like a wall instead, a smell of dust and stagnation, like an empty attic. I turned on the flashlight for the first time and illuminated the old helm, the leather captain’s chair, the telephone hanging on the wall, all looking untouched. If it weren’t for the opaque windows, I’d almost have thought that the last crew to leave this room did so with the full expectation of walking in again the next day to get right back to work.

I sat down in the chair for a moment. Why not? The leather crackled under me. From the new vantage point I could see a small pile of modern-looking trash in the corner next to the door. That explained the open door, but brought up a whole new set of questions regarding the condition of the room.

As I sat there and pondered it, listening to the sounds of the ship, it occurred to me that those sounds had changed.

I froze, stopped my foot from tapping, listened.

The creaks and groans coalesced into a rhythm that seemed to spread up from the floor and through the walls. There was no one moment of transition, only a moment of realization, like when you finally recognize the beat of a familiar song that had already been playing for a minute.

It was *words.*

**BACK TO WORK?**

**BACK TO WORK?**

**BACK TO WORK?**

It was a voice, a voice of shifting metal, quiet and slow and enormous. That’s what you have to understand- that’s why I wasn’t afraid, at that first moment. The unknown is frightening, but understanding came to me instantly, so that there was no time for fear. It was the voice of the ship, asking one short question, over and over.

**BACK TO WORK?**

“Are you talking to me?”

I stood up- it felt right, somehow- and the voice fell quiet for a moment, as though surprised into silence. Then-

**YES.**

I had the dreamlike sense that this should not have made as much sense as it did, that I ought to be disbelieving the evidence of my own ears, but I couldn’t. It was like I’d known deep down, from the moment I’d first seen the ship lit up by the rising sun, that I would be talking to it before the week was out.

But what to say to a ship?

I settled on “How long has it been?”

**SINCE LAST MOVING… TWENTY-SIX YEARS.**

Another pause.

**SINCE LAST WORKING… THIRTY-FOUR YEARS.**

“Damn,” I whispered, and the floor shivered a bit under my feet.

**I WAITED. I AM STILL AS I WAS. COME SEE. GO DOWN.**

The pitch of the voice had risen just a little- it was insistent, almost defensive. I swung the flashlight beam around, searching the room for what it might mean by *go down*, and in the corner across from the door I found the stairs. I went down.

The dusty room became dusty passageways. I opened doors as I went, looking in on empty cabins and other rooms whose purpose I couldn’t quite discern. The voice stayed quiet, waiting for me to find my way; the creaking of the ship sounded like breathing now.

After three more flights of stairs, and several more minutes of wandering, I found the right door. The floor shivered again as I turned the watertight handle, and the voice made me jump a little when it suddenly spoke again.

**LOOK.**

I looked. The door opened onto a tunnel, and a split second after raising my flashlight to peer into the darkness I knew it had to run the entire length of the ship. The light couldn’t find the end. The floor was metal mesh, and the walls and overhead couldn’t even really be called that; they were not solid but made up of pillars and struts and a long tangle of pipes and cable, stretching away into the gloom.

It smelled damp and moldy.

**LOOK. LOOK. PLEASE.**

The mesh squealed when I stepped onto it. The railings on either side of the walkway were cold and greasy, and I leaned on them gingerly to get a closer look at the wall. I saw ancient wiring, ancient pipework- green copper and rust everywhere- a tiny puddle of brown water standing in the hollow of one pipe bracket, another bracket rusted through entirely. Were they supposed to look like this on the inside? Had all this happened after the ship had been abandoned, or before? Surely it had been laid up for a reason- but if the reason was that it was worn out, surely they would have just scrapped it?

Thirty-four years. That meant it had been out of service since the *fifties*.

**DO YOU SEE?**

“I…” I hesitated. “I'm not sure what I'm looking for.”

**NOTHING… NOTHING WRONG. YOU NEED ME… I AM READY. READY AS I WAS. BACK TO WORK?**

**BACK TO WORK?**

The question echoed.

I stood there in the tunnel, silent, as a weird guilt settled into my heart. “I can’t get you back to work,” I answered at last. “I just… wanted to visit.” *Explore* was closer to the truth, but it felt like the wrong thing to say. The answer, when it came, was very slow and very low, reverberating through the pipes around me. Somewhere in the distance, a shower of rust shook itself free and rained down on the metal grating.

**YOU ARE NOT CREW.**

It wasn't a question, but I answered anyway. “No. I'm sorry.”

**BRING CREW. PLEASE. PLEASE.**

It even sounded like a desperate last attempt. Overconfident, I answered without thinking. “But even if I could, I don't think-”

I cut myself off too late. The ship spoke no words, but I felt something begin to vibrate the air in the tunnel, something like the gathering of charge in the air before a lightning strike. A discordant note came rippling down the metal railing from far off.

Suddenly I knew the fear of something very small caught at the mercy of something huge, incomprehensible… and *upset*. It came rushing in all at once, dropping my heart into my guts; all the fear I should have been feeling up until that moment. I spun for the door just as a sound like no other I'd yet heard shook the walkway- a great THUMP like a trapped animal throwing itself against a locked door.

The flashlight fell from my hand, bounced off the floor and fell between the railing slats. Its beam illuminated me from below, shaking as the THUMP came again, and then again and again with increasing frequency. I stumbled, fumbling for the opening in the awkward light, and ran straight into the now closed door. The thumps came faster still, shaking the walkway like an earthquake.

“What are you doing?” I yelled over the growing noise, throwing my weight against the handle. It had moved easily on the way in- now it seemed like a hundred years’ worth of rust was jamming it. “Please, stop! I'll try! I'll bring- I'll bring crew-”

My foot slipped, and terror cut me off as the floor jolted under me. A metallic clang of indeterminate origin echoed madly through the tunnel- steel on steel, not the low, slow steel on steel of the ship’s breathing but the sharp, harsh shift of a sudden movement.

“Just please, open the door!”

No answer. The thumps settled into a frequency so high that they all but blended together, rattling my teeth, sending pieces of who-knows-what raining down all around me. With a strength born of panic I wrestled with the door handle, moving it by millimetres at a time, one foot braced against the railing. The deck was tilting under me, slightly but undeniably, and though I didn’t yet understand what it meant I knew it was nothing good.

Then something gave with a SNAP like a great gunshot, and the walkway jolted more violently still, and the pillars around me thrummed like tuning forks. A second later, another SNAP, further away.

The tilt had disappeared. Then I knew, and I bit my tongue to keep from screaming for help again- it would let the panic in if I did, the panic that was already screaming from the back of my mind. One snap, and then another; one ancient, dry-rotted rope breaking, and then the other.

We were underway.

I gave the door handle one more tug, and the infinitesimal movement it made pushed back the panic and replaced it with frustration. Some old quote about the definition of insanity came to mind. I turned away from the door and set off at a run- hand trailing along the rail- into the darkness that had to hold, if not a better option, then at least *another* option. There would be a door on the other end. Maybe it would be open.

The cacophony grew louder as I ran; now I know it as the grinding of rusty bearings, the protests of a steam engine left to the mercy of time and the elements for thirty years, but at that moment all I could hear was an endless roar of anger.

It must have been the overwhelming noise that kept me from registering the smoke.

I didn’t realize it until the railing ran out and I slowed just in time to run into the door at only half-speed. The handle turned when I tried it, and the stench of smoke washed over me when I wrenched it open.

Smoke and darkness. I turned around, blinking away the burn, to look back the way I’d come, all the way back to the tiny distant glow of the flashlight, then shut my eyes and stepped through the door.

It was a stupid thing to do. Maybe when it all hit me, deep down I was thinking I'd rather burn to death while actively looking for a way out than burn to death in a long, dark tunnel like a trapped rabbit. I had no plan. I couldn't see a damn thing. I felt my way forward under a mind-numbing barrage of noise and stink and growing heat, and stumbled into the side of a metal staircase through sheer luck. I had gone down to get to the tunnel, so up meant out. I ascended until I found windows, grubby with rusty water streaks but letting in just enough light to show me the way through the smoke.

At the top of the stairs I took in a breath that seemed to be nothing but smoke, and the panic I'd been fighting back finally broke through. I couldn't breathe. I was suffocating. With one hand over my mouth and nose I broke into a sprint for the nearest shadowy shape that might have been a door.

I burst through into the night and ran. The long, open part of the deck next to the rail was ahead of me, and I could think of nothing but getting away; my vision was a tunnel. Stumbling over a clod of dirt on the deck brought me back to my senses. I was going the wrong way.

I turned around.

The smoke was billowing from every window, black against the deep blue of the night sky. Flames licked deep inside, rising up, casting an evil dancing light on the rising pillar. It had to have started in the engine, but it wouldn't be long before the fire would consume the entire stern- and well before that point it would have spread through the rest of the ship as well.

The lights of the city still twinkled beyond. I ran to the deck rail and jumped.

It was a long fall into darkness, and the impact was a shock. Before I'd even reached the surface again I was already swimming, terrified of being caught up in the ship’s wake and dragged into the screws. I heard and felt it pass by me from underwater; heard its roar, no quieter than it had been in the air, and the whap-whap-whap of its propeller blades that sounded close enough to reach out and grab me. Felt its massive bulk pull the water along with it, so that for a moment I was swimming in place- and then being slowly, slowly pulled backwards- and then breaking free and surfacing with a gasp.

I was swimming in darkness. The only possible bearing I had was the lights of the shore, the ones that seemed nearest. I had no real idea where I was, or how far the ship might have travelled. I rode the wave of panic, letting it power my kicks and strokes, until another light- a light I couldn’t see, but which I knew to be behind me- demanded my attention one last time.

I paused, treading water, and looked back.

The sight held me spellbound for a moment, fighting with the self-preservation instincts that told me to keep swimming. The entire vessel was lit up by the golden glow of the flames, just like it had been lit up by the sunset when I'd first seen it. It steamed away like a ghost ship, making for the open water of the lake, and I could hear the fiery-hot steam venting from its whistle in a long, wordless howl of grief and rage and pain.

That howl followed me as I swam, and I could still hear it when I dragged myself up onto a rocky point covered in birdshit, but I didn't look back again. One last glimpse had been enough.

I found my bike. It wasn't hard to parallel the water until I found a familiar building. I made it home, half-frozen. I even made it to work the next day, feeling and looking like I had the world's worst hangover. I hardly said five words, total, that day, even when my coworkers were asking me if I'd heard.

*Had I heard about the fire?*

It was just “the fire”- nothing about the far more interesting aspect of the incident- which might have caused me to doubt my own memory if I were the type. I’m not. I knew what had happened; I just accepted that most people hadn’t seen it. There weren’t many people living near the water, and it had been very late.

Then it showed up in the newspapers. No photos, just *Freighter catches fire and sinks in harbour*. Nothing about the fact that it had to have been nearly *out* of the harbour before its rusted hull finally succumbed to the heat and vibrations- or hell, maybe it made it all the way out into the lake. I can’t say I liked to think about any of it, but thinking of that at least felt right. But the article let it sound like it had sunk at its berth. *Total loss*, it said. *The vessel had been out of service since 1952*.

It was a cover-up, and I can see now why they did it. What really happened was something impossible. You can't just hotwire a ship and start it up like a junk car; it takes a whole crew of experts to get it to start running and stay that way. There was no logical explanation for a ship starting itself up in the dead of night and steaming away- so, better not to mention it.

I didn't mention it either, though it weighed on my mind.

I came to terms with it early. For me, who had been there when it happened, it made a strange sort of sense right from the start, but it took me a while to put that feeling into words and explain it to myself. Now I’ll explain it to you.

What makes a ghost, if not unfinished business? What is unfinished business if not purpose unfulfilled, enduring after everything else is gone?

And what stronger sense of purpose could there be than that possessed by a singular, purpose-built machine?

It waited, its sense of purpose growing even as its body rusted. Maybe it would have waited forever if I hadn't been drawn in by its will- and I'm sure now that that was what happened. I stumbled in like a fool, spoke to it, raised its hopes and then crushed them. And then… its patience finally ran out. Its anger gave it the power to act on that will. The most powerful ghosts are supposed to be the angry ones, aren't they?

And I was the stupid mouse, in a cage with an angry elephant.

I was never sure if other machines had this capacity- to run out of patience. For thirty-eight years I thought it was a freak case, a one-time thing.

Then, last month, coming home from a road trip with my daughter’s family, I felt it again. It. The pull. Like something desperately wanted me to look at it, notice it.

“Look! So cool,” my grandson exclaimed, and the twin forces of that pull and my need to humour him dragged my eyes off the road.

It was an old combine harvester, crouched like a huge metal troll in an overgrown circle in the middle of a farmer's field, surrounded by low green rows. Its black windows stared at me as I drove past, and I could almost hear it.

*BACK TO WORK?*

*PLEASE?*

It all came flooding back.

“Pretty cool, buddy,” I agreed, hoping that my voice didn’t sound too high, and that it didn’t waver when I shivered. If it did, no one said a thing.

So there you have it. Maybe not all machines have this capacity, but some of them do. Maybe most people don't have the capacity to hear them and feel them, anyway, but some of us do. Maybe it’s even genetic- maybe my own flesh and blood all have it. So I've got to come out with it.

If you ever find yourself inexplicably drawn to an abandoned old machine, it's not just curiosity. Please don't go inside.

And if you do go inside, for God's sake, don't make any promises you can't keep.
