I had an amazing wife. We were only married for a  year before she went missing. We had known each other since we were kids, we started dating in early high school. She was popular and out going. The kind of person that wouldn't give up on her dreams no matter what. Honestly I'm not sure why she was interested in me. 

I don't know why but I  was the only one she told that she practiced magic. At first I thought she meant like cards, stage magic but I was wrong she meant witchcraft. I never understood any of it though she would talk to me about it. She would talk for hours about her love for it. She said she liked  that it was a secret between the two of us. 

She would say that that she put spells on me to keep me safe, she never said from what. I  took as it was her special way of saying she loved and cared for me. She gave me a necklace once and asked me to never take it off. So I never have. She would always smile when she saw that I had I on even in the shower. Even when we would... let's say have fun she would pull on it and she would pull hard. It never broke or seemed to get damaged to my surprise. 

I still remember everything about the day she vanished. She had work so she would get up before me. The night before hand we had some fun. It's also the first time I started have weird dreams. I  woke up and she had already left. I got dressed and went by my day like normal. Nothing out of the ordinary happened. I  walked our dog,took our kids to school, did work around the house, fixed our sons bike. Picked the kids up from school, had dinner  with the kids and helped them with their home work. It was when I was helping our daughters with their home work. I  thought to myself she should be home by now. 

I grabbed my phone  and called her. There was no answer. The phone rang and rang only for it to just go to voice mail. I called again and again only to get the same result. I started to panic a little. I did my best to hid my worries from my kids. I helped them finish out their home work then put a movie on well I tried to find out what was going on. I tried calling her office they said she hadn't been in all day. My heart dropped at the news. I quickly  called 911 to report her missing. The cops showed up  20 minutes later. I explained to them all I knew even told them about friends and family she might be with. I  told the kids what was going on as I didn't  want to hide this from them. All five of them hugged me crying.  I  comforted them as much as I could before sending them to bed an hour later. They did wind up sleeping with me that night. 

The dream I had that at was weird it was like the one from the night before. I was on this weird building that had a pool that I was standing in. Unlike the night  before  I  saw something  on the ground on the other side of this massive pool room by the hall way. When I got to the other side of the pool I saw it was one of my wife's dresses. It was her blue one with a slit on one side. It was then i hard her voice call out to me. It was echoing from the halls. I  run down the hall as fast as I could. There was an massive pool room with an big archway on the other side of it. I  jumped  in the pool and started swimming across. As I  was swimming  there was a splash I jard from behind  me. I didn't turn around I just swam faster. I got to the other side pulled myself out then turned around. There was a naked woman deep on the water looking at me. I  ran through the archway and hall to an other massive pool room. 

This one was even bigger than  the last two. It also had ten different pools in it.  And slides high up on the walls  even one the would drop you straight down it to on. The naked woman popped up from one of the pools. A purple tentacle came up from an other and dragged her into it. Then before I  could even react. What looked like a 15 foot tall woman with long arms and legs  cover in black seaweed with green glowing eyes came up from the pool and grabbed me. It brought me up to it's  face then I heard my wife's voice again. It dropped me it felt like I was falling  forever. Everything around me started warping and turning into humanoids things with eyes that glowed purple. I looked straight down and saw the floor rapidly approaching. I  woke up right before I  hit the floor.
