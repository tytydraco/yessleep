The next morning, mommy didn’t have a face.

She didn’t have a lot of things anymore, really. Something had taken her face, her eye, her fingers. I’d never seen blood and viscera before, so the sight confused me almost as much as it scared me. I’d woken up covered in those red chunks, and the smell made me feel sick. Was this really what people looked like, under their skin?

A trail of that scarlet red led down the hall, splattered over walls and furniture. My mind swam with questions. How had I slept through it all? Who did this? The little girl or the thing that followed were my immediate suspects, but the true culprit was so much worse: Bandit. We were supposed to be best pals no matter what, yet there I spotted him, maw turned red with dried blood, ears flattened against his head, looking guilty.

It was all too much. I’d been betrayed by my best friend, and my mom, once my only source of comfort, wasn’t even recognizable anymore. Worse still, the reality of the situation was finally starting to dawn on my developing mind. Things weren’t going to go back to the way they used to be. I wasn’t yet ready to comprehend the idea of eternity, but… somewhere in the back of my mind, there was a growing flicker of understanding that my mom wasn’t going to wake up from all this.

The thought wracked me with a profound terror I wasn’t yet ready to handle, and I threw myself at her side, shaking her limp body. “Mommy, please. You have to wake up. You’re really hurt, mommy. You have to go to the doctor! You have to!” I choked out the words through bitter tears, my voice raising until I was screaming myself hoarse, as if volume alone would make her wounds disappear and her eyes open and we could go back to being a family again. 

Only the silence answered.

I curled up and cried somewhere far away from the mess of red meat that had once been my mother. But eventually, I felt a cold snout bump against my back. It was Bandit, sniffing me close as if to check on me. I tensed, disgusted by his audacity, roughly shoving him away from me with a hand. “No! Go away! Bad dog! You hurt mommy!”  It wasn’t long before he nudged me again, and in a fit of rage I swung around and punched him in the snout hard enough to make him yelp. “I said go away!”

But I immediately felt bad, watching him slink guiltily away. And when he poked his head back in a good fifteen minutes later, I sighed and beckoned to him with a hand. “I’m sorry, Bandit.” He trotted forward and I wrapped him in the biggest hug I could muster, and I couldn’t help but giggle softly as he licked over my cheek as if to wipe away my tears. “You’re a good dog. You were just hungry. I’m hungry, too. I love you.”

But of course, even now, her body wouldn’t stay still.

I was used to being awoken these nights, usually due to my piercing hunger or night terrors or that presence at the door. This time, however, it was from a clattering downstairs. It seemed familiar, like… the sound of someone loading dishes into the washer? Had mommy finally woken up? A day ago, I would have jumped for joy at the idea. Now it filled me with terror, even if I couldn’t say why. Something about imagining that faceless thing hobbling down the hallways…

I crept downstairs at a snail’s pace, bracing myself, yet still I yelped in surprise at the sight of her. Her body’d been propped up limply at a chair at the dining table, facing my way as if expecting me. A spaghetti mess of ratty, molding hair, thin and stiff and black like a spider’s legs, was draped over that concave crevasse that had once been a face, all splotches of red with glimmers of white where her teeth remained embedded in the meat. Said meat was turning an ashy black, pocked by holes where insects had begun to lair like creatures resting in caves along a cliff face, the largest being the socket of her consumed left eye which a maggot family now called home. Her right eye had been tugged halfway out of its socket, looking wide and glassy and yellow, bent sideways as if staring at the wall.

I was so struck by it, it took a second to notice that the sound was still coming, even though she was motionless. Something else was in the kitchen, seemingly knocking about pots and pans, sorting through glasses and silverware, making as much noise as possible like a lure. The dining room was dark, but the kitchen was truly pitch black, lit only by the faintest glimmers that shone upon silverware like dots of moonlight upon a black lake. Mommy sat at the very border of that blackness with her back to it, like the Cerberus at the entrance to Hades.

And then, all at once, the noises ceased, as if the thing had caught me staring, and had stopped to stare back. And once again, the silence proved worse than the sound.

I took a seat at the table, across from the meat that used to be my mother. I still don’t know why. It just felt like what I was supposed to do. There we sat in a twisted, mocking facsimile of the family dinners we so used to enjoy, as I tried to pay attention to anything but the look and smell of her, as everything around us faded to silence and dark. Just as I thought the silence would last forever, mommy sprung to life.

No — not her. Something behind her, in the darkness, using her like a puppet. Even as a child, I knew instantly those movements were not hers. They were like a marionette’s, stiff and jerky and artificial. But her voice was unmistakable. “Good morning, my darling. Oh, that was quite the refreshing rest.” Silence. “What’s the matter, my love? Aren’t you glad to see your momma?”

I heard Bandit growling, and turned to see him stood beside me, head low, ears up, eyes wide like a deer’s, staring into the darkness. He was thinking the same thing I was. “Y-you’re not my mommy.”

That black abyss in its scarlet not-face spread wide in a way that, I guess, was supposed to be analogous to a smile. “Why, don’t be ridiculous, child!” A hand jerked upwards to wave dismissively. “I was just having a little nap. You know us moms. We work so hard. We need lots of rest. But I’m awake now. Okay, honey? Everything is okay.”

I stood from my chair, tears blurring my vision. “No! It’s not okay!” I yelled, all that fear and frustration bubbling up. “You’re not my mommy! Where’s my mommy? I hate this! I hate you! I want to go home! My real home, with my real mommy!”

And as I screamed and cried, the thing’s not-face slowly soured, as though the sound of my tantrum was like nails on a chalkboard. “Now, now. Don’t cry. You know… mommy doesn’t… like it when you… cry.” It whinced and shuddered. Its voice lowered. “You’ve already made this far more difficult than it had to be, you… little… whore.” As she growled those last words, her voice lowered into… something else. It didn’t sound much like a voice, but rather an itching coming from inside my own head, like a fingernail scratching against my eardrum directly.

I screamed, and Bandit took that as his cue.

His barking tore through the silence as he stormed fearlessly into that darkness, and somehow managed to sink his teeth into something solid in all that black. There came a sound roughly comparable to the squealing of a pig being put through an industrial lathe hooves-first, and the creature through my mother’s corpse away in such a fashion that it seemed to go pouncing over the table onto me. I was sobbing as I was knocked backwards in my chair, the body flopping limply atop me, maggots and blackened blood and bits of turgid meat splattering upon my cheeks.

I wriggled out from under her with all the strength I could give, and went blindly fleeing, crying and wailing to the tune of Bandit snarling and tearing at something unfathomable far behind me. 

The façade of my apartment was flickering all around me, as if the illusion was crumbling as my loyal pooch mauled its creator. Once again I was merely sprinting through an endless course of rooms I recognized, but which were somehow *off* — the geometry warped and twisted in impossible ways, like I was not in the rooms themselves but in half-faded memories of these rooms made manifest. TV flickering between violent and profane images over a soundtrack like someone smashing keys on a piano. Doors slammed shut before me, and each clung stubbornly closed… but then I’d think of my mother’s loving face, and they would yield.

And then things emerged from those implacable darknesses. The shadow things from the apartment doorways. The things that were children — or had once been children, long ago in days when they’d been loved by anybody but the creature in the dark. Things twisted into lattices of rusted metal, bones broken and bent and allowed to heal in wrong directions to fit those twisted industrial shapes, hobbling forth on bony legs as if struggling to maintain their own weight. There was no way they could catch me at that speed, but it seemed they hoped their visages alone would terrify me into paralysis. And they almost did, until a friend rejoined my side.

I felt the fur brush my leg, and I screamed, ready to kick and scratch at it. But I turned and saw it was Bandit, and if I didn’t know any better, I’d say there was a smug, triumphant little grin on my dog’s face. The fur around his muzzle was wet with the thing’s blood — no, not blood, but something black, thick and curdled. He showed no fear, only a determination to shepherd me through the valley of darkness.

But behind me, the darkness followed. I could hear that entity screaming from a mouth that was not a mouth, roaring in a sort of infrasound that could not be heard by the ears but which rattled the mind and twisted the stomach into knots. Doors slammed and lights shattered in its wake as if it were afraid to ever step into the light. The floor rumbled and shook as it grew nearer, until I could feel its breath against the back of my neck.

And then I pushed through one more door, and floated away into an endless expanse of white.

I closed my eyes, if only because the very brightness itself pained me. But that horrible, raspy breathing was replaced with another, one low and gentle, a kind I recognized from snuggling up to my mother on many a sleepless night. One last time, I got to feel her hold me close and nuzzle her chin against mine. She whispered a vow of love in some language I didn’t understand, and I’ll never forget her meaning even if I can’t express it with words alone.

And somewhere far off behind me, something was rumbling, rumbling…

And I was home. Sitting on the floor in front of the TV, where the Dora the Explorer theme song was blaring. Toys and action figures scattered across the floor before me, and two social workers standing over me, flashing a light in my eyes, trying to figure out why I wasn’t responsive.

Nobody ever believed a word of my story. The only hard proof I have to offer is that, while her bed was found caked in dried blood, my mother’s body was never found. Not even a trace of it.

After that, I found a new home living with my distant aunt and uncle twice removed, a plain couple who just happened to take pity on the poor child with the tweaker mother. They would always talk about how inseparable me and Bandit seemed to be. How my loyal pooch would always stand by my side, as if always guarding against something. He was sick for a few months after all that happened — my uncle said he must’ve taken a bite out of something he shouldn’t have. But he pulled through, and I still have my scrappy old mutt today, pampered with all the treats and belly rubs he could ask for.

But I can see in his eyes that what we saw in those days never left him. And it hasn’t left me either.

Our society is sick. So many children like me fall through the cracks every day, and nobody notices. Nobody cares. It’s a cruel enough fate to go through your short life without ever feeling the warmth or the light of care or love. Crueler still to fall into the hands of the thing that waits for them out in the dark.

A few weeks ago, a girl vanished from a poor apartment near me. Not a single hint left that she’d ever existed. No family, no manhunt, just a footnote in the papers. And when once I was roused late in the night by Bandit’s growls, and dared open my eyes, I swear I could see her beady little eye staring at me from the absolute darkness behind the crack in the door.
