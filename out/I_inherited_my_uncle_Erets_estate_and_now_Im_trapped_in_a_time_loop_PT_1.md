Hi, I (22 M) am posting here because I need advice, because I am freaked the absolute fuck out. I don't want to use my real name on here (people who leak that kind of thing are asshats), so call me Aurum. 
Little background info, I just got out of college, and in my last year, I heard that my uncle had passed away. He and I were never really that close because my mom's side of the family did not like seeing him. Something about an old family dispute. But I do remember a couple things about him. He was a squat, portly guy, with a buzz cut and white hair aside from this one streak of toffee brown that was right above his left eye. He was a vet, had served a couple tours in Egypt in the 70's, and always regaled me and my siblings with these over-the-top war stories, recollections about war buddies, and things he had seen during the war.
Honestly, some of the things he said should've scared the hell out of me, but they didn't. They always fascinated me. Probably contributes to why I'm a Stephen King buff today.

He always talked about things he'd call Chakru. Big golden sentinels that would guard pharaoh's tombs. He'd show me this big book about Egyptian mythology with a silver cover. The kind of thing you'd fight tooth and nail to get at a Scholastic Book Fair when you were 8 or something. There would be these drawings and pictures, and Polaroids of the things in the book. The weird thing is, when I looked them up, nothing appeared. Nada. Nill. I looked for the pictures, no evidence of them even existing or been taken. Scanned through the book for the sources, looked em' up, still nothing.

Uncle Eret's whole house gave weird vibes. Oh yeah, my uncle's name was Eret. Can you tell I'm writing this in a hurry? Anyway, it was this big, tent-shaped log cabin, about three stories tall, in the middle of rural Massachusetts, just shy of Boston.
It was warm and cozy, with these big Bukhara rugs, and paintings everywhere. Newspaper clippings and red string lined the walls around the center of the second floor, leading, like a trail of breadcrumbs to Uncle Eret's study. It looked straight out of Jurassic Park, like something John Hammond would ogle his amber cane in. Ham radios, shelves full of weird objects, candles, that kind of thing.

I think that was part of why my family chose to no longer talk to Uncle Eret. Poor guy died basically alone. We didn't even get any news about it until months after, an invitation to the funeral. No idea who arranged it, either. Like I said, he didn't have a lot of people in his life, and yet, that church was packed.
There were tons of people we had never met, dressed in what looked like the same exact black suits and dresses, in neat little rows in the pews. All stonefaced and just staring ahead. 
"Extended family" or some bullshit like that.

That funeral went by in what felt like minutes, but was probably closer to three or so hours. By the time I walked out of that church, it was night out, pitch black, with those people herding into SUVs and minivans like lambs.
After that, things just kinda went back to normal. Back to studying, cramming for exams, eating Ramen noodles and Mountain Dew. Saved up for an old Xbox and played a ton of Halo. 
Surprisingly, I graduated. And to celebrate, I went to my family for Christmas that year. While I was halfway through a plate of turkey and mashed potatoes, my mom got my attention, and showed me an envelope addressed to me. It had a golden wax seal on it with something in Arabic circled by a horned circle.

I excused myself, and peeled it open. Inside there was a small piece of paper. In flowing gold script, it read what basically equated to:
"Hello, Aurum, you are entitled to Eret [Insert Surname Here]'s estate as per his will. All expenses will be paid in the future by [Insert insurance corporation here] so long as you move in by January 4th."
Now, that was a big deal. I mean, I had a job, but i would never afford a house, let alone a big estate like my uncle's. AND my gas, electricity, internet, were all paid for? I hit the lottery. ...So what was the catch? 
It sounded perfect, so there had to be something wrong with it. But, I mean, I was poor and basically living out of my old beat-up PT Cruiser, so I just saw the words "entitled to", "estate", and "all expenses... ...paid".

Christmas went on pretty normal, hell, I had forgotten about the envelope by the time I woke up in my car, and only remembered about an hour into my shift. (I flip burgers for McDonalds. My mom was right about not taking school seriously. Stay in school, kids.)

Come the end of my shift, I started up my car and made the long-ass drive to my uncle's estate. In those woods, in the cage of pine forests, where the asphalt eventually morphs into tred dirt, you can feel both at peace and melting with dread simultaneously. The road to my uncle's estate is right along a cliffside, and I was incredibly scared that in my tired, greed-addled mind, I'd accidentally swerve and crash into the quarry at the bottom of the cliff.

In those woods, you get reminded that humans reallt are just apes who got lucky. Without cars, or skyscrapers, a bear could leap out and tear you apart, or a moose could slam into you, and nobody would know. I was practically swimming in dread, and before I knew it, I was at my uncle's estate. 
The place hadn't changed since when I was a kid, but as I walked in, I realized and learned, much to my dismay, that the place had basically been gutted by the movers. The only thing still in there were what was in the kitchen. No groceries.

As I looked around blindly for a light switch, I found a post-it note to the side of it, with "Blow-up bed, and canned food in the basement".
Somehow, in comparison to the woods, the basement looked almost cozy. Was it a cold concrete block that still held the frames of the wooden casks of beer it once held? Yes. We're there any... I dont know, wendigos, spirits, fae about to jump out at me? No. The only natural threat I think could possibly be in there would be a rabid bat.
Sure enough, sitting next to a pallete of canned tomatoes, peaches, and tuna, was a rolled up, dusty, inflatable bed.

I picked it up, slugging the surprisingly heavy roll beneath my arm. But as I was walking, my foot pulled out a cloth and I came crashing to the floor.
My head collided with the concrete floor and I blacked out. 
When I came to, I was sitting in front of a large statuesque figure. It sort of resembled a humanoid beetle crossed with a knight or samurai. Instead of arms, it had a bunch of hoops connecting to resemble chains. Its eyes were black, like onyx, and its chest was segmented, like it was designed to open from the inside.

I scrambled backwards in terror, since that thing was definetely not in front of me before.
Thankfully, the figure was completely still, even as I prodded it curiously. It towered over me. It looked like it was completley carved from gold. 

Whether it was stupidity, or if it was just me having a concussion from my head cracking like a coconut against the floor, I walked past it, and set up the bed in the main foyer.
I passed out on the bed.

And that, dear listeners, is when the horror started.
I shut my eyes, and drifted into dreamless sleep. After what only felt like a minute or so my eyes shot open. It was pitch black and the lack of background noise from my phone made it even more eerie. The thing must've died. 

Then I realized, I couldn't move. My eyes stayed still in their sockets, I couldn't even blink. 
I was in the middle of sleep paralysis. 
I winced at the thought of the demons that awaited me. 

Then I heard it, a dragging. Like metal scraping against old, lacquered wood.
Scrape...
Scrape...
Scrape...
Each time, it got closer. I couldn't see where it was originating, only that it was coming from the general area of the basement.
I heard another scrape, and I could see the faint glint of polished gold in my peripheral. Another second, and it got closer. I could see its head and upper torso. My eyes were still adjusting to the darkness, but the bright yellow of the figure helped me make it out.

It was... the statue. From the basement. It crept closer to me, timed by a second. Until the thing was on top of me. How could I even begin to describe the pain?
My ribcage was being crushed, I could feel my ribs splinter and snap, by spine forced to the indifferent plastic of the bed and my lacquered pine of the floor. My vertebrae popped out of place one by one, making a noise like osseous popcorn.

The thing's chain arms wrapped around my neck, like a vice. I could feel the blood leave my face. I could feel the gusts of air trying desperately to stay in me, but failing as the monster's vice-like grip stayed firmly around my neck.
The edges of my vision blurred as the compartments on the thing's chest starting popping open. One by one, revealing a large cavity within the creature, glowing a vibrant green, like a verdant spotlight. 
With a loud SHWING, like a sword being drawn, a large limb swung from within the thing's chest. It was angular, like the leg of a wasp, ending in a sharp, spear-like tip, completely comprised of a nebulous green energy. Another followed it.

Two more, but smaller swung out. The rancid smell of rotting meat and formaldehyde emerged from the golem's chest as it sunk the lower pair of limbs into my stomach. I wanted to cry out, to scream, and express the acidic pain, but I couldn't. I couldn't so much as cry. 
It swung one of its larger limbs into my torso, red pooled around it, and the other sunk in right after. Together, they pulled, pulling my skin taught, causing my flesh to rip like fabric. I could see my ribcage, my cracked, partially shattered ribcage. I could see my pumping heart, my breathing lungs, a bit of my digestive tract. More red fluid pooled out of my chest, like a swimming pool of sanguine and bone fragments. I should've been dead. If not from shock, then from blood loss, but I was lucid as could be.

With a mighty cleave, the monster raised one of its large claws and swung down, shattering my ribcage, sending bits of bony shrapnel to pelt my face, revealing my beating heart. 
Gingerly, the horror grabbed my heart with both large claws and suddenly yanked upwards, ripping it out of my body. I only managed a gasp. A cowardly facsimile of the scream I meant to make. The beast's lower claws produced a medium-sized porcelain jar, and stuffed my heart inside.

As quick as it arrived, its extra claws retreated back inside of it with a snap, like cracking twigs. Its chest compartments revealed, and I was left there, slowly bleeding out, and dying. As my eyes shut, I expected to see white clouds and singing angels.
But, I didn't. I woke up with a start. 
I screamed, loud, with primal terror. But, I could move and there was no nightmare on top of me.
Daylight shone through the windows.

I began to smile, and laugh a bit.
"Thank God, it was all a nightma-"
But, then I saw it. Scrape marks on the floor, as if something heavy and metallic had been dragged across them. 

I ran down to the basement, expecting to see the auric automation gone. But it was still there. This didn't do anything to abate my terror. I noticed something about it... one of its chest compartments was ajar.
...I had to know. You know? To see if my heart was in that jar, if what had just happened was real.
I tugged on the golden plates with everything I had, until they came away and fell to the floor eith a clatter, and I saw what I was dreading...
...inside the thing's chest was a jar, and inside... a beating heart.

I screamed once more. Was I dead, was I a ghost? I ran back up the basement stairs to check something. I grabbed my phone, and tried to turn it on. Miraculously, it did with 14% battery. (I assume it just auto-turned-off before).
I pressed on the Messenger app, and clicked my mom's contact, half expecting my fingers to phase through the phone. But as I called her, the phone rang, and rang, until she picked up, and I heard her speak, with a tired-sounding voice, like i just woke her up:
"Aurum? What is it, honey?"
I couldn't respond, I simply hung up.

My mouth was agape, my skin was ghost-white. And I noticed, that, sitting on the bed, was what appeared to be a flower. 
It resembled a rose, but with glowing green petals, like they were carved from rose. It smelled vaguely of sage.

There was an odd warm sensation on my forearm. I looked. It was the ankh on my wrist, now glowing a green. Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention. When I was young, the aforementioned uncle gave me an ankh tattoo on my wrist when my parents weren't looking. Anyways.

Instantly, I sprinted for the front door, and jostled the knob. It wouldn't budge. It must be locked from last night. So I tried to unlock it.
And, I swear, it just re-locked. 
As I fucked around with the door, I heard it... that telltale scraping. Metal on wood. I didn't even have to look behind me as a massive shadow encompassed my form. With another:
SHWING
A glowing green claw pierced my abdomen, and my heart was on it like a stake. There was a searing pain throughout my body as it pushed through me like a knife through butter. As it priced my skin, blood sprayed like a faucet. I could hear it punching through my spine, and getting stuck somewhere in the muscle of my back, forcing it to pull out.
I fell to the ground, the claw being the only thing holding me up, before it shot through me once more, and shot straight through my ribs. My heart literally fell out of my chest, and I blacked out once more.

Once again, I woke up screaming in the bed. I looked to the door, and saw scratch marks in the wood where it was behind me. And yet again another rose.

So I can't leave my house. Great.
