Hi. My name is Alex. Weird things are happening, and I don’t understand. I just don't know what to do anymore, I am really scared, I need your help. Please !

I don’t know how to explain this. I just got home. It’s late. I was out with friends, nothing crazy—just a normal night. I should have walked into my house, gone to my room, and gone to sleep.

But when I got to my front door, I heard my own voice inside.

I froze. At first, I thought I was losing it. Maybe I left the TV on? Maybe my phone was connected to a speaker? But no. The sound was too real, too close. I could hear myself talking. Laughing. I could hear my mom, my dad, my sister talking back to me.

My heart started pounding. I pressed my ear to the door.

I heard myself say, “Man, tonight was great. I needed that.”

That was my voice. That was exactly what I was going to say when I walked in.

My hands were shaking when I knocked. The talking inside stopped. Footsteps came toward the door.

When it opened, I saw myself standing there.

Same face. Same clothes. Same everything. But… something was wrong. His smile was too perfect. His eyes looked too bright. Like he had been expecting me.

I took a step back. “Who… the hell are you?”

My voice—his voice—was so calm. “What do you mean? I live here.”

Behind him, my family stood in the hallway, watching. Their faces were blank, confused. Like I was some kind of stranger.

My mom tilted her head. “Who is that?”

I felt sick. My dad frowned. My sister clung to the fake me’s arm.

I took another step back. “Mom. Dad. It’s me. What the hell is going on?”

My mom’s eyes darted to my fake, then back to me. “Is this some kind of joke?”

The fake me laughed. He fucking laughed. “I don’t know who this guy is.”

My stomach turned. I looked at my dad. He didn’t move.

I reached for the door, trying to push inside. My dad stopped me.

His hand hit my chest. Hard.

“Hey,” he snapped. “I don’t know who you are, but you need to leave.”

I thought I was going to throw up. This was a nightmare. It had to be.

I looked at my mom, pleading. “Please. Please tell me you know me.”

Nothing.

She didn’t recognize me.

I turned to my sister. “It’s me. I swear to God, it’s me.”

She hid behind the fake.

My breath was coming too fast. My head felt light. I looked at the fake again. He just smiled. Like he knew exactly what was happening.

The door slammed shut.

I stood there, shaking. The house was locked. I was outside. Alone. 

I was completely shattered and scared , I can't even process the fact that the family in which I have lived for years, th....the....they just don't recognise me anymore. 

I pulled out my phone. My hands were slippery with sweat. I opened my messages. My entire chat history with my family was gone.

Every photo of me in my gallery—gone.

It was like I had never existed.

And the worst part?

Through the window, I could still see them. My mom. My dad. My sister. Sitting down for dinner with him.

Like nothing was wrong.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to go. Please, if anyone knows what’s happening, tell me. Please.

W....wa...wait I think someone is coming, i will ta.....
