My Room on the 13th Day of the Month

I live in a cabin in the woods with my wife. It's cozy inside, but whenever I try  to sleep in the 13th day of a month, I always see a white speck in the cabinet. The cabinet is for some reason locked? But it has a small crack that I can barely see through. I also always feel like something's in my bed at the same time. It sometimes whispers but I always thought it was part of the song I always listened to with my phone speaker under my pillow. It's always hard to sleep because of the presences I somehow sense. My wife always calls me insane whenever i try to tell her about it. I've gotten paranoid to the point that I always put my phone camera into the crack of the cabinet door. Even ripping my matress to check inside it everyday. I sort of got used to it now. 


But on The 13th of November 2013, I didn't feel a single presence in my bedroom? I went outside to water my plants then something was off. I felt a.... Presence? I rushed into the cabin. And found out that the painting of a man's silhouette was missing. I asked my wife, "Where'd the painting go?". She said, "What painting?". My heart dropped instantly. I ran out of the room. But... The "Figure" was everywhere. Under the table, behind the refrigerator, in the cabinet, in my matress and....... Behind me. It had a face I could never erase from my mind even in a million years. An eye in the middle and a mouth that stretches from ear to ear. I panicked and tried to hurt the figure by punching it in the face. I felt a severe pain in my face and the figure looked unbothered. I felt so dizzy... The figure spoke. It had a deep, sinister and evil voice. "Of every home, this? You really fucked up, Xan." I fainted. 


I woke up. But... I was in a different place?? The eyes... They were everywhere... I fainted again and woke up. In a different house with my wife. It turns out we're in my mother's house. She told me that after I fainted, she went to my mother's house while I was passed out. She said I've been unconcious for 13 days? I went all the way back to the cabin. To finally see what was inside of it. I picked the lock and opened it. I saw a hole inside. I tried to put my hand in it to see if anything's inside. I felt a human like finger touch me. I slammed the cabinet shut and ran out. And decided to never go near the cabin again. In my mother's house, I was happy that I was finally free from the curse. "Finally. I'm free." I said. My mother came in and told me, "Hey, son. Why's there a speck of light in the cabinet?".
