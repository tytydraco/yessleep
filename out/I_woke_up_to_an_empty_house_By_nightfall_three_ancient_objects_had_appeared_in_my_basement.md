I woke up on the basement floor. I didn’t know why. The concrete was cold beneath my cheek. Damp. It smelled like dust, mildew, and something faintly metallic. My body ached with the dull stiffness of having laid too long in one position. Had I sleepwalked? I couldn't remember coming down here.

A thin gray light crept through the high basement window, casting pale beams across old furniture and cluttered boxes. Outside, the fog was thick, softening the trees beyond into vague silhouettes. The sun was just beginning to rise.

I stood slowly, brushing grit from my hands. The silence was heavy. I climbed the stairs, planning to apologize to my wife for disappearing in the night. She’d love this story.

As I take the stairs one by one, I begin to know that something is very different. The power in the house is obviously off, it is far too quiet. Too still.

As I emerge through the basement door into the kitchen, my suspicions are confirmed, the power is most certainly out. I continue my journey through the house, intending to go back to sleep as even in the absence of a clock, I know it is still quite early.

My wife is likely asleep so my strange story can wait to be told until later. I make my way up the stairs to our bedroom, which is the first door I come to. My wife is not there. I can still see the indentation of where she had laid on her side of the bed, but she is not there.

I figure waking up to see me not in the bed may have caused a slight panic in her and she is likely elsewhere in the house searching for me, though I’ve heard nothing else so far this morning.

I immediately leave our room and head down the hall to our son’s room. He is also not in bed. I’m typically a calm person but at this point, panic begins to creep in.

I call out to them both, more anger in my voice than I mean, but I’m worried. The next logical step to take is to go down to see if the car is still in the driveway.

I make my way back downstairs and out through the front door. The car is still in the driveway. Then they must both be in the house!

I go back inside to call out a few more times but I already know my efforts are futile. Though I’ve just noticed their absence moments ago, I know something is very wrong.

I decide to call the police for help. I head back upstairs to my bedside nightstand where I leave my phone. The phone is off so I hold the power button. Nothing. My next decision is to head to our next door neighbor’s house.

In my brisk walk over there, all kinds of thoughts enter my mind. Are we under attack? Did an EMP hit us? But why would my wife and son be gone?

I arrive at my neighbor’s porch and ring the bell. Even in my current situation I feel a bit guilty ringing the bell, but I simply don’t know what else to do. I wait a short amount of time and after no answer I ring the bell again. Still nothing.

We live on a cul-de-sac with six houses, so I have more neighbors to try. I try the next house. Same result. I peer in the window. Everything seems to be in order, except like my house, it is devoid of life.

As this thought occurs to me, I realize that the entire cul-de-sac is devoid of life. I don’t hear any birds, nor any insects. Just the fog, unmoving in the absence of any wind.

I decide now that my only option left is to walk down the street and see if I can find anyone else in the neighborhood. I figure even trying to start the car is a wasted attempt, and I hope to not have to walk very far anyway.

As I begin to walk, it allows me to try to make sense of this situation. But I can’t. As my steps continue, I feel my panic devolve into fear, slowly. I am on the verge of tears, which is very unlike me, but I feel so scared and hopeless.

I walk down the street that feeds our cul-de-sac. I notice that the density of the fog has left me at a point in the street where I can no longer see our house, but I also cannot see where I am heading. The fog allows me to see maybe 50 feet or so.

As I continue to walk, I begin to see shapes emerge, of houses and cars in the street. This starts to fill me with some amount of hope as I see these shapes as more options to get help. But as I move closer, I come to the realization that the shapes I am seeing are my cul-de-sac again.

At this point, it becomes very difficult for me to describe my emotions. My brain is a debilitating mix of confusion, sheer dread, and certainly the panic I have been feeling all morning, though far more intense now. I would think this was a nightmare, but I know I’m awake.

At this point, I have no idea what to do next. The only thing that makes sense to me is to head back into our home, if indeed this is our home I am heading to. I walk inside and this does appear to be our home, nothing has changed.

I collapse onto the couch in the living room and make a feeble attempt to come up with a plan, but I simply don’t know what to do. I pace through the house for hours, hoping the walking will make some thought come to me, but a thought never arrives.

The evening hours are already beginning to set in. Once again I collapse back onto the couch to attempt to sleep, it feels wrong to sleep in our bed. Sleep never comes.

The evening hours turn into absolute pitch-black dark. In my restless attempts to find sleep, I turn my head to the basement door and notice a very faint orange glow outlining the door. The glow is so faint I never would have noticed except for the deep darkness of night.

I use the faint glow as a guiding light to make my way to the door and turn the knob.

There is certainly some kind of light source in the basement. Maybe it was my desperation for some sort of sign, but I felt a pull toward the light, so I began to descend down into the place where my day began.

I reach the bottom of the stairs and notice two things immediately. First, I knew I was not alone down here. I neither heard nor saw anything else, but I felt it strongly, there was at least one more presence here with me.

The second thing I noticed was the light source. The source of the orange light was a very old lantern. As I continued to walk toward the lantern, I also came to the realization that this lantern was sitting on a table that was not mine. And sitting on the table, next to the lantern, was a deck of cards.

One distinguishing feature about the lantern, table, and cards was that these three objects were ancient. They were each worn in a way that doesn’t come from years or even decades of time, these objects seemed to be thousands of years old.

As I gazed at these otherworldly objects, more details began to emerge. Etched, and in some cases crudely carved into the table were markings that I can only describe as arcane symbols. They certainly were not any language I recognized and it appeared as though there were many different languages represented, and all crafted by a different hand.

The cards were yellowed and had crumbled edges presumably from eons of time and handled by an untold number of people. I don’t know how I knew this, but I knew that I must sit at this table, and draw a card.

With a deep breath, I sat at the table, and reached to draw my first card.
