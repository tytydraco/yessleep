It was a dark and stormy night, the kind of night when the very air seemed to be charged with an ominous energy. No one dared venture outside, for fear of what might be lurking in the shadows.

But there was one man who had no choice. His name was Jack, and he was a grave digger. It was his job to bury the dead, no matter what the weather or the circumstances.

As he trudged through the cemetery, shovel in hand, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. It was an unsettling sensation, one that he knew all too well.

But he had a job to do, so he kept going. Soon, he came to a freshly dug grave, ready for its occupant. He set to work, digging with quick, efficient strokes.

As he worked, he heard a strange noise, something that made his blood run cold. It was the sound of something scraping against the lid of a coffin.

He froze, his heart pounding. He had heard stories of the dead rising from their graves, but he had always dismissed them as superstition.

But now, as the noise grew louder, he knew that something was terribly wrong. He hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to do. Should he run? Should he call for help?

But he knew that he had a job to do. With trembling hands, he lifted the lid of the coffin, and what he saw made his blood run cold.

The dead man inside, a notorious gangster named Tony, was not at rest. His eyes flickered open, and he let out a terrible groan. His skin was rotten and discolored, and there were maggots wriggling in his hair.

Jack stumbled backwards, his shovel falling from his hands. He tried to run, but he couldn't. The dead man was too fast, too strong.

Tony grabbed Jack by the throat, his bony fingers digging into his flesh. Jack struggled, but it was no use. He was helpless in the grip of the undead.

With a sickening crunch, Tony snapped Jack's neck, and his body went limp. The dead man pushed Jack's body aside and crawled out of the grave, his eyes fixed on the light of the moon.

As Tony stumbled through the cemetery, he came across a group of teenagers. They had come to the cemetery looking for thrills, but they got more than they bargained for.

Tony snarled and lunged at them, his hands outstretched. The teens screamed and scattered, but Tony wasn't easily deterred.

One by one, he caught them and dragged them back to the cemetery, where he feasted on their flesh. The night was filled with the sound of screams and the sickening squelch of gore.

By morning, the cemetery was littered with the bones of the dead and the bodies of the living. Tony had gotten his revenge, and there was no one left to stop him.

And so, he continued on his ghastly quest, hunting for fresh victims to satisfy his insatiable hunger. The world had become a much darker place, filled with the horrors of the undead.
