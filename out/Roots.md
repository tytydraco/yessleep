I didn’t get much sleep that night. I sat up, my mind racing with endless questions. What could it all mean? Where was his body? Could he still be alive? Was this some terrible joke? And where was Angela? If it was murder, why the noose? The thoughts swirled in my head, loud and unrelenting. Little did I know, some of these questions would soon be answered.

The next morning, I woke up feeling like I had been run over. No one had contacted me about work, but I decided to go in, just in case someone was expecting me. When I arrived, I tried the front door, but it was locked. I headed to the back and used my key to get in. I set my bag on the breakroom table and quietly walked around the office, going room by room. I didn’t hear or see anyone, but something felt wrong. The air was thick and heavy, and the entire place seemed different. I told myself it was probably just the aftermath of last night's events.

When I reached Dr. Lance's office, I slowly opened the door. I half-expected to see him sitting there with a smile, asking about my weekend. If I hadn’t been so frightened of him after Friday, I might have even wished to confide in him about his own disappearance. But the office was as empty as I had expected. As I scanned the room, something caught my eye on the corner of his desk. I stepped closer for a better look, and my brain struggled to make sense of the grisly sight in front of me. It was a canine tooth crossed under a lateral, with a molar perched on top. The roots of the molar wrapped around the single-rooted teeth, acting as a sort of clamp. They were still bloody, the blood looking dried, but not completely—still holding onto its red hue. I stared at it, unsure of what to do.

I decided to run to the nearest operatory to put on gloves. Grabbing a sterile pouch from the lab, I carefully placed the strange tooth formation inside. I examined it for a few moments before sliding it into my pocket. I searched the room for any other signs of something unusual, but nothing else seemed out of place. The only thing missing was the small vial of teeth Dr. Lance had been staring at before he lashed out at me. I wondered if it meant anything, but decided to bring the evidence to the police and give them any information they might need.

As I turned to leave the room, I nearly collided with Angela, who was standing silently behind me. I screamed, jumping out of my skin. Once I realized who it was, I bent over, trying to catch my breath. “Jesus, Angela, you scared me half to death. I didn’t think you’d be coming to work today.” I waited for a response, but she stared blankly at the corner of the desk. “Angela? Are you alright?” I asked, growing concerned.

“What were you doing in here?” she asked, her voice flat and devoid of emotion. My face grew pale. Not this again, I thought. This strange energy was getting out of hand, and I felt like a frightened animal backed into a corner. “N-nothing, I just—”

“You have no reason to be in here. Get out,” she said, her voice lifeless. I completely understood, considering what had just happened to her husband. I nodded and slipped out of the room without protest. As I rushed back to the break room, a shiver ran down my spine. All of this odd behavior was getting to me, so I grabbed my bag and hurried out the back door. 

As I pulled out of the parking lot, I decided I didn’t want to go home just yet. There was so much going through my mind, and I needed to clear my head with a nice long drive. I drove around the familiar streets and backroads of the town for about forty-five minutes, lost in thought. Eventually, I decided to drive past the Lance's home, just to see if what Sadie had described was exaggerated or not.

I had only visited their white picket-fenced home once before. They had invited me over one Friday to play some board games with their twin niece and nephew. They were about my age, and we actually had a wonderful time. Being fairly anti-social, it was a pleasant surprise to get along so well with a four-person group. The whole family seemed picture-perfect, with their welcoming smiles and a home that smelled like warm coffee and vanilla. As I reminisced, I turned the corner onto their street, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the end of it. Their beautiful home, once a place of love and excitement, was now a sight that would make anyone feel sick. It made me wonder once more how things had gone so wrong so quickly.

The crime scene tape covered the closed garage door, the front door, and acted as a fence around the whole yard. It was completely void of life, and the beautiful flowers that once lined the walkway were shriveled and dried. I slowly drove to the end of the street and parked my car in front of the neighbor's house for a moment. My nose began to sting as tears welled up again. A single tear rolled down my cheek, but before I could really cry, I noticed one of the blinds in the upstairs windows being pulled down as if someone was trying to peek out without being seen. My emotions quickly shifted to laser focus. I couldn’t make out any person, and for a moment, I thought maybe the blinds were just broken and always looked like that. 

As soon as the thought crossed my mind, I received a text. I glanced down at my phone and saw “Text message—Angela.” I didn’t open it right away but looked back up at the window. The blinds were back in their original shape, as if nothing had ever been out of place. My heart stopped, and I sucked in a barely audible gasp before quickly shifting my car back into drive. I didn’t want to stick around to see who or what was watching me. I whipped out of that neighborhood like a bat out of hell and decided it was time to go home.

As soon as I got home, I sank into the couch and turned on the TV. Angela's text was still waiting on my phone. I let Face ID unlock it so I could see the preview. It read, “Don’t be messing with things that you don—” The pit in my stomach deepened. I hadn’t even read the whole text, but I felt like I was being threatened by the Italian mafia or something. “Fuck, dude,” I said out loud to myself. I was so tired of all this mess. At this point, I felt like begging my previous boss for my job back. I’d gladly take some Gossip Girl drama over whatever this was.

I braced myself before opening the full message from Angela. “Don’t be messing with things that you don’t understand, Amelia. I need you to return what you stole by tomorrow morning. If it isn’t returned, bad things will happen. I’m serious.” Now, I felt that my life was in danger. I contemplated my next actions carefully. Should I respond to her text or just leave it alone and call the police? I was scared. No, I was terrified. I wanted out of this situation and didn’t want to deal with whatever messy consequences would inevitably come from all of this. But I knew I didn’t have a choice. I decided to do both. 

I quickly typed back, “You’re really scaring me, Angela,” and hit send. I decided I would visit the police department first thing tomorrow morning. I’d bring them the odd tooth formation I found and show them the creepy text I received from Angela. I was beginning to think Angela played a big part in whatever happened to Dr. Lance. I got up and made sure all of my doors and windows were locked, just in case I really was in danger. I didn’t fully believe Angela’s threat, but I didn’t want to take any chances either.

As I made my way to the kitchen to make myself a light lunch, my phone chimed again. “Text message—Angela.” This time, I immediately opened it. “This is much bigger than both of us. I’m warning you because I care about you. Do as I say, Amelia, or you will regret it.” I nearly dropped my phone. What the hell was she talking about? I decided it was time to turn my phone on Do Not Disturb. This was all too messy and too much for my brain to wrap around. I made myself a PB&J and turned on YouTube. I watched Moist Critical police chase videos and crocheted until the sun went down. It worked. I managed to wash my brain of the issue that had been haunting me, even if it was only temporary.

Around nine-thirty, I took my dogs out and herded them into their kennels. Most nights, I let them sleep in my bed, but tonight I wanted them to stay in the living room so that if anyone tried to break in, they would alert me. I brought my katana, which normally hung on the wall for decoration, into the bedroom with me. I set it on the floor next to my bed and wrapped myself up in the comforter. Surprisingly, it didn’t take long for me to fall asleep, despite my current dilemma. The constant stress must have been wearing on me.

It was three-thirty on the dot when my eyes shot open. I didn’t hear or feel anything out of the ordinary, so I wasn’t sure what had woken me. My eyes drifted to the alarm clock, and I lay still and silent, just to make sure it wasn’t an intruder. But my dogs were quiet, which meant I was safe. I let out a deep, sleepy breath and rolled onto my side, ready to drift back to sleep. That’s when I heard it—a plastic-sounding scrape coming from under the bed.

I froze, straining to listen. The floors were real wood, so I thought maybe one of the dog balls was rolling around with a draft, something that happened from time to time. But what I heard next was unmistakably horrifying: an impossibly deep, nearly demonic-sounding breath, like the sound CGI dinosaurs make in movies when they’re quietly hunting their prey. My skin turned to ice, and my whole body went rigid.

“Amelia, is it?” a deep, whispering voice came from directly beneath me. I couldn’t move, let alone respond. I heard it shift slightly, but it didn’t sound like a person with rustling clothes—it was more like plastic beads rolling on the floor. Something crawled up the wall and gently placed itself over my forehead. It felt like a snake-like tentacle, covered in hard bumps. I whimpered, paralyzed with fear. I couldn’t see anything in the pitch-black room, and the thought of dying at the hands of an unknown creature in my own bed was too much to process.

Its voice came again, like the sound of a spinning quarter on a wooden desk. “A woman of great taste…” It trailed off as another beady tentacle slithered under my chin. Tears silently rolled down my face, wetting my hair beneath me. I sniffled and grimaced at the disgusting creature holding onto me. “A profession of little desire… but why?” it asked in a menacing tone. The tentacle under my chin slithered its way between my lips, forcing my mouth open. I tried to keep my jaw shut, but the creature’s strength was unimaginable. I thought my jaw might break if I resisted any longer. The tip of the tentacle probed around inside my mouth, starting on the top right and moving to the back, feeling each and every one of my teeth one by one, right to left, left to right. I trembled uncontrollably, hoping against all hope that this was the most vivid nightmare I had ever had.

When it reached the lower right side of my mouth, the tip of the tentacle perched itself on top of my last molar. With one quick tap, I felt the tooth crack, and I screamed in agony. During my four years as a dental assistant, I had learned that each tooth has somewhere around seventy nerve endings, and I felt each and every one of them screaming for help. The tentacle flicked upward, running itself from my soft palate, causing me to gag, to the back of my front teeth. I continued to cry in pain as it caressed my face with the now slobbery tentacle. “Return what is not yours, and you’ll never have to see me again… I don’t want to turn any more of those pearly whites into a problem.” As it spoke its last words, it slowly released me. 

I heard the beady creature recoil under the bed as the right side of my face throbbed. I needed medical attention or painkillers, but both were far out of reach for the same reason—I couldn’t force myself to leave the bed. So I lay there, frozen, staring at the ceiling in silence until the sun came up. At some point, I managed to curl myself into the fetal position, quivering uncontrollably. I probably would have stayed there forever in shock if my dogs hadn’t started whining and scratching at their kennels. This was their normal morning behavior, their reminder to Mom to get them breakfast.

Slowly, I unfolded myself and sat up, scanning the room for any Cthulhu-like creatures, but of course, everything was in its place. I carefully scooted to the edge of the bed, where the door handle was waiting for me. I reached for the handle, opened the door without taking a step off the bed, took a shaky breath, jumped off the bed, and ran to the living room as if something were on my heels. I looked around and finally accepted that I was safe. I opened the two kennels and gladly welcomed the excited kisses from my dogs, their fuzzy bottoms giving me a small rush of serotonin. Once they were taken care of, I grabbed the stupid tooth formation from the counter and made my way to the office once again. I didn’t even change out of my sweatpants or my stained PJ shirt. I looked exactly how I felt.

I pulled into the office parking lot to find it was empty once more. I unlocked the back door, flung it open, and hustled to Dr. Lance's office. I placed the sterile pouch containing the creepy teeth on the desk and quickly made my way back to the exit. I didn’t look around for anything odd or try to gather any more clues—I was done. I never wanted any reason to piss that thing off again. I didn’t care if Dr. Lance’s body was super glued to the wall—I didn’t see anything.

I quickly drove to the prompt care clinic a few blocks away and waited for a couple of agonizing hours before I was finally seen. When they brought me back, I explained that I had broken a tooth by biting down on an almond. The lie was stupid, but I couldn’t think of anything else. They took an X-ray, and when the doctor came in, he looked peppy, but I wasn’t feeling it. “Looks like you had a rough night!” he said with a small chuckle and a big white smile.

“Yeah,” I grumbled, trying not to act like a total jerk.

“I was looking over your chart and X-rays. You bit down on an almond?” he asked, as if it were unbelievable. I nodded, wondering why he was questioning my story. I thought it was the most believable I could come up with. “It’s just that the tooth cracked in a very unique way. I’ve never seen a crack quite like this. I’m no dentist, but we do get our fair share of tooth infections and fractures on the weekends.”

I quickly followed up, “May I see? I work in dental.” I was nervous, wondering how badly this thing had messed up my mouth.

“Sure thing,” he said, pulling up the X-ray software on the monitor in front of us. When he opened the periapical, I was floored.

As I mentioned earlier, I’ve been reading X-rays for about four years. I’ve seen many things that defy what I believed to be standard: a front tooth that broke in half horizontally, a tooth stuck sideways in someone's chin, a grown woman with seven baby teeth—you name it, and it’s most likely happened. But when I saw the state of my molar, which had been perfectly healthy just yesterday, it absolutely defied my expectations. 

The tooth had a large abscess at both root tips, at least three large cavities, and the crown had been split into four pieces, divided by the roots. The cracks visible in the X-ray were so large that we didn’t need a specialist to locate them.

“Jesus Christ,” I finally managed to say.

“My thoughts exactly! But it looks like this tooth has been a silent problem for many years. Let’s get you some antibiotics for that abscess, and then you should see your dentist as soon as possible.”

“Okay, thanks,” I muttered, unable to take my eyes off the screen. I didn’t blame him for thinking this had been an ongoing problem. If I had seen this in someone else, I would have said the same thing.

I made an appointment at one of the corporate dental offices in my area to get the tooth extracted. They were able to get me in the same day, so after the appointment, I came home with a numb face and one less tooth in my jaw. I asked the doctor to let me keep my tooth so I could examine it when I got home. I held it up in the ziplock bag and gazed in amazement, thinking about how something so small could cause so much pain. I knew this wasn’t the end of my problems, but I decided it was time to start looking for a new job. I hoped never to hear from Angela again.
