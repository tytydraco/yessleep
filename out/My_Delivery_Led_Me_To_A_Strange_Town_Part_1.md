Hi everyone. So, I just got off work. I was a bit tired after driving several hours in my state. I have driven all across the US as a delivery driver of a major carrier for the past 10 years. I have driven in places such as Massachusetts, one of them was Salem, where they said witches are burnt there, or that's what the history said. I drove in Baltimore, now that's a different can of worms; people shooting at random people, that kind of stuff. Then, when I decided to move to Kansas, it became quiet. Not a whole lot to do in that state, apart from driving to Kansas City to get some action. 

And then there is this town I drove to recently. It's a town named Burton. Now you're wondering why I even mention a small city that is situated in Western Kansas? For context, I lived in Wichita, Kansas. It's a pretty alright city that is like a 2 hour drive in Topeka, and almost 3 hours to Kansas City. Burton is a small city sitting just by Highway 54 – A small highway system that nobody uses unless you're actually going south, and know where you're exactly going. It's pretty much the only city that is actually not a small town around the south west Kansas area, so it's a guarantee that people who wanted to go south would drive there to reach New Mexico.

When I got there however in my couple of runs over there during my delivery, it was the strangest town I have ever drove. I can't exactly explain why I said it. So, I'm going to explain why, it sounds like I'm rambling, but trust me, I'm not lying this time.

That was my first time as the driver within the western Kansas, as my colleague who was supposed to do the runs there got really sick and decided to take a week off. My boss asked me if I could cover some of his routes. At first, I wanted to not take any of the routes he took, as it was far away, and half the time, driving that long in Kansas is just plain borinf. That however was changed as he offered me a $2 hourly premium on top of what I was already being paid for. I accepted the offer. I know it's dumb to accept an offer that low, but still, I can't let myself pass that up.

I then started my shift and began my 2 hour drive to some of the small towns in South Western Kansas. It was a pretty boring drive; kinda why I said I won't take this route at first as the highways I have to take to get there were just so boring. As I drove, I turned on the radio. At the time, that was the only thing inside. There was nothing inside the truck that entertained me while I did this long drive; no Bluetooth that I could connect my phone to, no aux cable for me to just plug it in, only the radio. I turned it on and tuned to anything that is worth listening to. I came across the radio station for Burton, the small city that was only 24 miles ahead of me.

I tuned in to the radio station and listened; it was something to finally break the monotony of this drive.

"98.9 Cruise FM, where your life in the highway means life in cruising"

The radio station began to play Owner Of A Lonely Heart. This was the moment I just began to jam on the radio, singing that song as loud as I could, hoping I sound like the singer in that song. I just hoped the bosses didn't just hear the crappiest rendition of the song I was listening to, I know. My jam eventually became more subdued as I saw a sign. It was a road sign, pointing directly to the direction I was heading. I have just arrived at the city of Burton. 

I was greeted by the swaths of roadside establishments, such as grocery stores, hotels, restaurants, and even a casino by the side. Before entering the city, there's an exit that leads back to the highway, which means when you go straight, it leads you to the downtown of the city. I pressed on and was greeted with a strip mall placed as the nexus point of this highway side commerce, and this mall seems to be filled with activity, from cars to people walking by. I've never been to Burton before, but it seems it won't be a boring place to be after all, it has everything I need to actually stop by and buy something on a roadtrip. 

I continued driving on one of Burton's main roads, Avelia Ave. I was greeted by the suburbs of Burton itself. The place seems to be pretty neat; rows of houses, small businesses, and paralleling this road is a rail track. Going straight to this main road finally led me to Downtown Burton. It was an incredibly beautiful place to be; places such as cafes, restaurants, a tattoo shop, and even a store to buy movies and video games, not bad. The one thing I liked about this city is just how clean it is. There's literally no trash on the pavement, no crackheads, and not even a person who is just hanging around, it's just people walking by and going about their day. This isn't like Topeka where I swear every single spot in that city has some crackhead lingering on the streets and making people uncomfortable.

I arrived on my first stop of my run, a small cafe in Downtown Burton. I turned the truck's engine off and I began walking at the back of the truck from the inside. I grabbed the package; It was a medium sized box that I grabbed and eventually opened the door of the van for the first time. The smell of Burton became more apparent as I stepped on the concrete sidewalk of the city. It was the faint smell of roses, the smell that no matter where I walked in this place, the faint sensation seeped into my nostrils.

The wind was calm and the noise I heard was minimal, almost as if people were all inside the buildings, and the people who are walking right now are the people heading to their destination. The sound of passing cars were all the noise I heard, and some occasional conversations between people. It was arguably one of the quietest places I have ever stepped foot on within this city, it's crazy to think a city can be this quiet, but hey, I won't complain.

I walked into the cafe. It was a small place; 5 tables and a counter across the building from the entrance. Behind the counter led to the kitchen, with an opening to where food is going to be placed. As I walked towards the counter, an employee of the cafe, named Emma judging by the badge on her chest, greeted me with a heartwarming smile.

"Hello and welcome to Downtown Café, what can I get you for?" She asked me with this affectionate and chippy tone that actually caught me off guard a bit.

"Uhh yeah, here's your delivery" I said as I reached for my PDA on my vest. "Sign here please"

Emma looked at me for a brief moment, and she then signed on the PDA. She then grabbed the box and passed it to her coworker, a man around the same age as Emma and brought it inside the kitchen, out of my view.

"So, can I give you a coffee to get your day up?" Emma asked.

"I suppose you can give me a roasted coffee if you don't mind," I said.

"Wonderful, I'll give you a cup in no time" she spoke with a chipper voice

She turned away from me as I watched her make my coffee. Her hips swayed gently, as she began to sing in a slightly quiet volume. She mixed the cream and the sugar with seamless flow, and finally stirred the hot coffee. Eventually, she turned around with the cup of hot coffee she just made and placed it on the counter 

"Here you are sir, enjoy your darkest coffee of your life" Emma quipped as she smiled at me with the clear hint of satisfaction.

I grabbed the cup and began to take a sip. The taste is just perfect; the perfect balance of bitter, and sweet, almost as if the coffee was created for someone like me who travels a lot,  and hates McDonald's coffee. Emma saw my expression as I glanced back at her. I have never seen someone this pleased over a simple cup of coffee she served. I actually almost feel bad for not paying her.

"Do you like it?" Emma asked

"This is good actually, I like it" I respond, as I nodded

"I'm glad to hear it mister" she said 

As I sipped my coffee, I heard the door open. I glanced at the front door and it was a police officer entering the cafe. Emma seemed to be in high spirits seeing this man enter. 

"Oh hi Mr. Smith, you are early today" Emma said in the same chopper voice that she had

"Well, it's the job young lass, there is always something outside that needs handling" The officer replied, as he pushed the tip of his cap off, showing his face clearly.

"Same order Mr. Smith?" Emma asked

I watched the two talk for a moment. As Emma poured the officer's coffee, I took a good look at the man. He looks around in his late 40s, greying hair, and has an imposing stature. He also has this faint scar that runs at the right side of his neck, which is more noticeable when he tilts his head to his left. The man probably has seen a lot of crazy stuff in his entire career; he's probably not even surprised at everything he sees at this point after years of being a cop.

"Here you go sir" Emma said. She slides the coffee cup on the counter. 

The officer grabbed it and took a quick sip of the hot coffee. He looked pleased at what Emma made for him that he nodded in approval.

“It taste good Emma” Cop complimented

“Thanks sir, my mother said I was a good barista”

Eventually, after all of that talking between one another, The officer finally turned towards me. He looked at me with a curious look, before sipping his coffee before he spoke 

"Delivery?" The officer asked

"Yeah, lots of deliveries down here" I replied, nodding.

I looked at his uniform. His name is actually Bradley written on his badge. He nodded and then stood straight back up after leaning.

"Son, it will be a busy day for you here. Where are you from?" Bradley inquired.

"Well, I'm from Wichita. It's like a 2 hour drive from here" I respond 

"You're far away from home it seems. I respect your effort at driving for 2 hours. The other guy who used to drive here before seemed to look like he had enough all the time" Bradley quipped.

"What do you mean?" I asked

"Well, the last time he was here. I saw him pale as a ghost when he stopped on one of the houses in the Southside of town. I thought he was just experiencing shock. The reality was, he saw Josey, and he thought she was going to do something crazy. Poor thing she is". 

Eventually, the officer decided to slowly head towards the front door. He nodded to Emma, to which she smiled. She glanced at me for a split second before looking back at the front door. For one last time, Bradley looked at me again as he walked.

"You take care of yourself, and have a safe drive". Bradley said as he left the cafe.

After a couple of minutes of conversation, I eventually left the cafe – Not before Emma in her chipper on the corner of my ear, "I hope to see you soon Markus". As I closed the front door, meeting me once again was the scent of roses, my god I can smell it. I began to walk back to my truck. I watched as Bradley just drove off in his police car. 

Wait a minute, I just remembered something. Did she just call me by my name? Or am I hearing things? I brushed that one off, probably my ears heard something elseI hopped back in my truck and now continue with my run. I placed my still warm coffee on the cupholder and headed back to the road once more.

As I drove within the city once more, I eventually found myself in a more affluent area of the city. I noticed that every single lawn within this area has campaign materials on their lawns – mostly shows the candidate, Carmen Berkshire. Now, during my time here in Kansas, there was a state election that will begin in the next 2 months. Mostly a state election, the midterms are about to happen anyway. 

They seemed pretty eager to vote for this woman as their representative, definitely not the first and not the last time this city will vote for her. Perhaps she's very popular in this city? Maybe she was a really good donor down here? Or perhaps this is just exclusive to this neighborhood? Who knows, I'm not a politician.

Speaking of this city, I just arrived at my second destination. It's a typical cookie cutter house within this affluent suburb within the city. I parked the truck in front of their driveway and grabbed the package. This one is big, and heavy, almost as if they're shipping some serious hardware with this thing. Jumping out of my truck, I carried this box onto my shoulders and began to march towards the front door. I took my first step onto the porch stairs as I looked at the front door of the house.

The air around this place smelled even more pleasant than the downtown area. The lingering scent of lavender permeates all across the front door; I don't even know where it came from, but unlike the downtown area however, the scent is much more prominent here than back where I came – like the smell of a typical city is replaced by this incredibly powerful air freshener that just goes around. The sound of the city is even more muffled; like the sound of cars just dampened out based on just how quiet it is, like your ears will ring if you try to listen to the serene atmosphere around me. Eventually, I rang the doorbell.

The door opened and I was greeted by the sight of an old woman inside. She looked like she just finished doing something and I decided to just knock.

"Hey ma'am. Here's your delivery" I said, laying the heavy box down on her porch.

"Sure thing mister, I'll take care of my package" She replied, peering on the corner to see if the box is there 

I pulled out my PDA and pass her the small stylus that I use to sign signatures with

"How is your day my dear?" The old woman inquired, with a gaze as if she was expecting an answer

"It's pretty alright. Busy day for me" I answered unconsciously 

"I understand the feeling. My husband is a busy man as well. He works at construction as a Foreman down by the Southside. He told me many times that he should be spending more time with me. Then again, the Mayor do ask a lot of things after all"

In that entire spiel, I just nodded along. I eventually retrieved my PDA back and placed it in my pockets. I said my thanks in a brief conversation, but she then asked something to me that made my head turn back at her. 

"Are you new in this town?" She asked

"Well, yeah. I'm not from around here as you can tell" I replied

"Oh I see. Sorry if I bother you with that conversation, many of us here just wanted to know if you are okay" she asserted, as she gave me a smile.

I finally left this old woman's porch. A quick glance side to side and I noticed that it is still quiet outside, maybe this is the most peaceful neighborhood I have ever stepped foot on. It's impressive just how quiet it is here. I hopped back in my truck. I looked at my phone and it looked like it was close to my lunchtime. Still got one more package that I have to deliver before I go for my lunch and drive back onto the highway. 

I drove to the 3rd destination of my delivery. This neighborhood led me to a much more working class neighborhood, people often called “Southside”. Basic sized houses like your typical bungalow or occasional old school houses that have 2 separate floors for each tenant, modest backyards, and these trees on the side. Then we have dirt alleyways with surprisingly not a single trace of garbage. Occasionally, I spot a house that looks like a typical landfill, with a random hoard of items on their lawns, but beyond the porches of these houses, it's pretty much clean from where I drove to the sidewalk. This has to be one of the most impressive cleaning I have ever seen a town to think even their poorer neighborhood looks like someone sweeps the roads every single day.

Now that I have thought about it, I have never once seen a single person who looks like your typical gangbanger or your local methhead who has a crack house to take their stuff in this entire neighborhood. This place is just clean, empty, and frankly, the quietest place I have ever stepped foot on. Sure there are parked cars on each side, telling me people do live in these houses, but this Southside the cop once mentioned is pretty neat, like any reasonable family could live in this place if they want.

I continued my cruise down Southside. The area has a church being constructed, but then also 4 cop cars around the place. "Interesting" I thought. Maybe the warning about Bradley earlier is starting to become more and more true. I mean, that's a lot of cop cars for a construction site, why would there be cops on a construction site of all places. My drive continued. More and more, Southside looked less like a naturally pleasant neighborhood and more like every crackhead, every drunk, every vagrant just… left – like they're not here at all but the area looks like it could be a horrible place to live in.

After minutes of driving, I come face to face with my final destination in my delivery. It's a small house – the house has a brown color, almost looks like the house is made entirely of wood. I parked the truck and finally grabbed the package for this destination. It has a strange shape for a box; it is long but a narrow box, almost as if I'm carrying something long like a guitar or something. I carried the box towards the porch, as I stepped on the rickety steps of this house's front facade. I dropped the box on the floor and began knocking at the door.

Unlike the last house which was immediate, this one took a while before the door answered. I stood by the porch for what seemed to be a couple of minutes until I heard someone rummaging inside, audible behind the wooden door. The door finally opened. I was greeted by a disheveled man; his thick beard is the thing I immediately noticed the moment we both lay eyes on each other.

"What is it?" The man asked

"Here's your delivery sir" I replied, showing him the package 

"Oh yeah, that's right, my bad" he muttered

He stepped outside and looked at the package. His glance went from the box, then towards me as he stared at me

"Did you open the box?" He asked, his voice have an accusatory tone in it

"No, I don't open anyone's package when I bring them here" I corrected 

"Good. That's all I'm asking. These days, people here need to mind their own business. I swear, people just grab my stuff and leave me to dry" He remarked, glancing around me

Eventually, he grabbed the box and immediately placed it inside of his house. The man stepped back outside and stood by the door, his hand on his hip as he began to talk once more

"So, what's your deal in this town exactly?" He asked me

"I'm just the delivery driver, I'm not from here really" I replied

"Uh huh, oh, in any case, here's my word of advice for you if you ever step foot in this city again. Watch out for Josey next door. She's been going crazy for the past couple of days. I'd say she's going to hurt someone" warned by the man.

"I'll keep that in mind" I responded 

Eventually, I decided to wave goodbye as I stepped down the stairs. Why is he telling me that? It's not like I'm going to return here and converse with whoever this Josey is. I immediately hopped back inside my truck and started the engine. I took a deep breath, thinking whether I should eat something first or I should leave this city for today. My body decided food is top priority at the moment; not even the coffee can handle my hunger.

After my run, I drove to a nearby diner and stopped there for the day to eat. I parked my truck just by the side of the main road and I exited my truck. Once more, the downtown has this rich smell of roses that I could not explain. The more I stood, the more I'm confused as to how these people managed to make this city smell something this rich of flavor. Even the smoke of my own truck's fumes couldn't even register on my own nostrils. I decided to enter the diner

Inside the Diner, as I sat on one of the tables, I was greeted by a waiter named Jonas. Just like Emma from the cafe earlier, Jonas here is just as chipper as she is. If anything, I've never felt more intrigued by someone this jovial on a menial task as this.

"Hello sir and welcome to Downtown Diner. What is the order today sir?" Jonas asked

"Just give me Bacon and Eggs and a glass of water"

"Of course, I'll return with your meal in 5 minutes” 

Jonas walked off. I glance and take in the scenery of this diner. The place looked like your 1950s or 60s style diner with checkered floors, seating next to walls, and the counter with drinks behind them. Among those is a huge bulletin board placed on the corner of the wall. There's a lot of them tacked onto the board itself, most of them are just the usual garage sales, hirings, or programs, nothing special really.

Jonas arrived with my meal and laid down the plate. It was my egg and bacon that I ordered; it smells pretty good too, almost irresistible. I handled my fork and knife as I began to slice my first bite. It was calming to just eat here and not think about what happened earlier. Although, it still bothers me that this town, for a place so clean, so organized, there is something that isn't quite right. 

Emma, that girl in the coffee shop, how did she know my name? I've never even met her my entire life, so how could she know something like that? Who is this Josey they keep telling me? They talk to her like she's some sort of rabid animal that got out of the clinic or zoo to create some chaos out here. This has got to be the first time in years I question if this town has something I don't know about. Then again, I don't like driving out here for 2 hours just to deliver something, but hey, what do I know.

I finished my meal and glanced at the open window. The scene of a clean city never disappears from my mind. Thinking about it, I've never once felt at peace or even felt like I was safe. I never once felt that the city felt like it's going to rob me or kill me, I felt more like I was part of the town even. Do you know the feeling where even if you are a stranger on a small movement or even a larger movement, you know there's a lot of people walking with you, sharing the same goal? The idea that even if you're all by yourself, you'll never feel intimidated, never felt like you're going to lose yourself from the crowd. This is what I felt walking around this place. Everyone knows you are welcomed, everyone knows you're alright.

I stopped thinking about what happened earlier and paid my bill. I left the restaurant and finally jumped back inside my truck. Before I even turned the ignition, onto the driver side window, a little girl walked by the truck. I looked out my window and I saw the girl. She looks like she is around 10 years of age wearing what seems to be a shirt showing a local charity group. In her hand, she is holding what seems to be a pamphlet. 

“Here you go sir” She said in a chipper voice

I grabbed the pamphlet and she walked off. I watched her pass more pamphlets to other people in front of her, from people walking by to people inside their cars, all of them greeted her. I turned the ignition of the truck and finally, the vehicle came to life once again. I looked at the pamphlet she gave me. There, I saw that this is about a charity organization within the city of Burton. Here's what it says:

“With the annual celebration of our mistress' blessings getting closer, it is a reminder as her children, you can show your blessings to our fellow citizens by donating. Here's all what you can donate to the organization:

Clothes
Toys
Food

Or, if you do not have anything to spare, you can also donate $5 to our organization. We would accept any kind of donations. Thank you for your consideration”

I wonder what kind of charity this would be. Who is this mistress this pamphlet is telling me I wonder? Maybe that's how they call their leader? Maybe that's their weird church in this place? I just brushed it off and began driving out of the city. Before I turned the wheel of the truck, the truck door opened suddenly. The door swung violently to the side and what emerged was a man who was frantically trying to tell me to drive out of here. 

“Get us out of here! Please!” He shouted

My body froze in place. I don't know if I should drive as he said or just stay in place. I watched him peer through outside the truck, looking at something from the distance. His face contorted into a face of desperation, panic set inside of him as he pleaded for me to drive out of here. He shook me as he screamed at me

“Please! Get me out of here! I'm begging you!

Before I managed to drive off, 4 cops caught up to the man. I watched as the 4 cops dragged him out of the truck and eventually pinned him down the ground. The cops shouted commands on him as he was being cuffed by one of the officers. One of those was Officer Bradley; his unmistakable greying hair stuck out alongside his younger colleagues.

“This is 1A2, we have the suspect in custody” Officer Bradley asserted through his radio.

He then looked at me and immediately recognized me

“Son? It's you. Are you ok?” Officer Bradley asked

“I'm fine,” I muttered.

“I'm sorry if this man shocked you earlier. We were looking for him for the past couple of days and, by the looks of it, he finally stepped out.” 

He takes quick glances at me and his colleagues, checking if his men managed to completely restrained him. 

“So, with that out of the way, do you want to make a statement? Is it ok for you to step out for a second? I'll just ask you a couple of questions for a moment. I promise, you'll be on your way again once everything is settled”

I told everything that happened before and during when the man entered my truck. The entire time, Officer Bradley listened to what I had to say, as he wrote everything I told him. Eventually, he hid his notepad and his gaze softened for a moment.

“Thank you, I know it's a lot to take in after what just happened, but I assured you, you are safe with us. Now, do you wish to write a victim impact statement as well?” Officer Bradley asked

“No thanks, I think I'm good” I said

Officer Bradley nodded as he fixed his hat. He said his goodbyes as he and the other officers began to jump inside their cruisers and drove off. Man this is the most interesting day of my life. I thought I was going to have something crazy happen in this town. It is strange. The man that jumped in my truck wanted to leave this place. What's so scary about this place? I know the town can be weird, or can be really off putting, but this place is something anyone can live in, a place where a family can raise their kids without worrying about people jumping on you. Maybe there's something I just don't understand that I have to find out.

I finally left the city, now heading back to Wichita. I admit, this has to be the most interesting delivery run I did so far. Before I arrived back home however, I decided to fill up the truck with gas. Cruising by the highway, I saw a decently sized gas station directly in front of me. I decided that I'm going to take a quick stop for a moment.

I parked the truck next to the pumps and I began to fill it up with whatever the company gave me for gas money, sweet. 

As my truck filled up, I entered the store and began to peruse the store for something to eat on my way back. I eventually come across on the far corner of the store, an advertisement board, you know, the kind where every company and organization places their flyers for people to see. This one however, is different.

Dotted from top to bottom of the brown board, more than a dozen missing persons posters. From the top is an old woman who went missing near Montezuma, a 30 minute drive from Burton. The next is a young woman who went missing in Dodge City, a quarter half minute drive from Burton. Another is a missing poster of a young girl. This time, she went missing just a week ago in Burton. This goes on and on until the bottom. 

I looked at each one, all of them, every single one of these posters. I looked at them all, everyone that went missing. Around Burton, there's just so many people who went missing in the area. Wow, there's so many.
