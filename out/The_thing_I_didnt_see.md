This happened to me a long time ago on the other side of the globe. 

There's no real action in my story, no guns, no monsters, no ghosts, none of the usual stuff I see in these posted scary stories. But this quiet, simple event terrified me more than anything I have ever been through, and I've been through some Final Destination level shit. 

I have rewritten this story until I could truly, and viscerally FEEL what I experienced and live through it again, but it was real & it changed me. I hope you find it interesting and worth a read.

The entire world was green. Not the gentle, life-giving green of a forest, but a thick, oppressive, and sickly algae green that swallowed light and sound. The silence was the loudest thing down there, broken only by the rhythmic, mechanical rasp of the regulator cycling from my own breathing—the sound of an alien machine in a world where it did not belong. Thirty five feet of water pressed in on me, a constant, heavy reminder that I was an intruder, a slow, soft-shelled creature in a place of immense pressure. 

My world was the three-foot bubble of murky visibility around my face mask. Beyond that, there was only the infinite, threatening green of open water that my vision couldn't pierce. My focus was on the machine I were tending: the vast, black, silent curve of a submarine's hull. It was my only piece of solid ground in this vertical wilderness. I worked slowly, methodically, my hands sure and practiced on the wrench as I loosened the bolts on the lower ballast tank vent plate. My rational mind was in control, focused on the task, the required task, the procedure. 

A small school of parrot fish, huge and iridescent, drifted lazily in front of my mask and in my limited visibility bubble, their powerful beaks scraping algae from the hull with a slow, crunching sound. They were unafraid. They had seen me before and didn’t flinch when I waved my wrench at them. Their calm presence was reassuring, a sign that I was just another part of the underwater scenery. They were my guard dogs. My canaries in this deep, green coal mine. 

I had the last bolt of the vent plate loose. I shifted my weight, tied off the plate on my secondary line and was ready to pull the heavy cover free with one last turn of the bolt. 

And then, it happened. 

It wasn't a sound. It was a pressure wave, a silent concussion in the water that I felt in my bones. And with it, a flash at impossible speed in the corner of my vision. Not a shape. Just a sudden, violent smear of battleship gray against the green, no more than a foot from my head.

But I didn't need to see what it was. Because in the exact same instant, the parrot fish—the calm, large and fearless beasts - vanished. Not swam away, but ceased to be there, a frantic, desperate detonation of pure terror. 

And in that moment, the calm and logical part of me in my mind died. The technician, the sailor, the thinking man—all of it was gone, vaporized by a single, primal signal that screamed up from the oldest part of my brain. The part that knows, with absolute, unshakeable certainty, what it feels like to be prey. 

My blood turned to ice. Every muscle in my body screamed at me to flee, to kick for the distant, shimmering promise of the sun. But the logical part of my brain, in its dying breath, had left one single, cold command in my mind: if I bolt, I die. The bends. The nitrogen in my blood will boil. A death more certain than the teeth I could not see. 

I flattened my body against the coating of the cold steel of the hull, trying to make myself a part of it. My hand, clumsy and shaking, found the hilt of my dive knife. I drew it, the blade a pathetic, useless little sliver of metal against the imagined monster in the green gloom. I was a man with a toothpick, waiting for a freight train. 

The terror was absolute. I was blind, helpless, and I knew, with a certainty that transcended sight, that I was being watched. That something ancient, powerful, and built for this world was circling me, just beyond the three-foot wall of my vision, deciding if you were worth the effort. 

I began to rise. Not with a kick, but with a slow, agonizing act of will, controlling my buoyancy, fighting every screaming instinct to flee and kick to the surface. Every foot of ascent was a lifetime. My head was on a swivel, your eyes straining, trying to pierce the suffocating green. I saw NOTHING. I heard nothing but the frantic, ragged sound of my own breathing, a panicked animal hyperventilating in its trap. 

The pressure in my ears changed released. The light shifted from a sickly green to a brighter, more hopeful gold. 

And then my head broke the surface in the shallow slope of the boat's stern. 

The sudden, shocking noise of the real world—the cry of the gulls, the distant hum of the diesel generator and chatting of sailors topside—were the most beautiful sounds I had ever heard. I was alive. I was back, and out of reach. 

I never saw what it was, but I know I was an intruder in a cathedral built for a god I was not meant to see. And for one, long, terrible moment, it had considered me.
