Hello, I don't know if anyone will see this but I need your help. Urgently. 



I woke up yesterday at around 3pm (I have a terrible sleep schedule), walked out of my room, and saw a large oak tree in my kitchen. The tree’s trunk was about 3 feet wide, connecting the roots which were digging into the floor beneath my feet to its leaf covered branches, which extended up to the ceiling where they had to stop for lack of room. Its bark was thick and knotted, and rough to the touch as I learned when I cautiously put my hand on it. I don’t exactly have the largest of kitchens, so the place where the tree now stood was previously occupied by a red spinning stool, which I could see brief glimpses of from a small gap in the tree, a bit like a thin gap in a cave tunnel. I am not a caver, so I did not reach inside to see if I could fit, so my stool remained there, with the tree growing around it.



After a few hours of standing there, poking and prodding the tree in disbelief, I looked up if this had ever happened to anyone else. Turns out, if there was a tree growing inside of a human residence, it was usually in an abandoned one, or done on purpose as some sort of decorative piece. Never on the second floor of an apartment complex, and never, ever overnight. I didn't know what to do, so I decided to call my dad. He didn't pick up. Typical. I called my sister but for some reason she thought I was joking and hung up on me. I took some photos but when I looked at them before sending, I noticed something even weirder.



The tree was not there. I tried again, and again, and again. Eventually I went and got my cheap instant film camera and took a picture, and it showed up on that, but when I took a picture of the photo i had taken, the entire photograph was missing, and my phone only took a picture of the kitchen counter UNDER it. I don't know why but I think it was the tree’s fault. Somehow this thing isn't letting me prove it existed at all. After I sat down some more, I thought of who would ever believe me that a fully grown tree somehow spawned in my kitchen. My landlord wouldn’t, especially not without proof, and with the housing market the way it is i don’t really wanna risk seeming crazy and getting kicked out. 



Eventually I realised the tree's roots were growing through the floor below me, so theoretically, they might be growing into the apartment below mine. I grabbed the photo and I went downstairs as quickly as possible, forgetting to lock my door on the way out. Usually I lock my doors whether or not i was inside or outside, not that my apartment complex was particularly shady or anything, but this one time i was so adamant on getting help i completely forgot to. I ran down the stairs, jumping from the second one from the bottom to the floor to save time, like every second counted. I found the apartment that was below mine. I knew it was this one because mine is the furthest one away in the hallway from the elevator, and so was this one. I knocked on the door, and noticed something. The photograph I was holding when I left my apartment, the one I distinctly remember holding at every part of that journey, was somehow gone. I frantically checked every pocket I had, and couldn’t see it on the floors of the hallway I was in. I was about to walk down to check when the door opened.



A man, in his early 50’s if I had to guess, opened the door. Based on the look in his eyes he was clearly already annoyed, so I knew if I told him why I was here I would instantly have the door slammed in my face. So instead I briefly explained that I was his upstairs neighbor, and was wondering if he had had any trouble with his ceiling at all, like cracks, stains or damages of any kind. 



“None whatsoever. Although you could be quieter sometimes. Some people like to sleep at night y’know?” he said, throwing an accusatory glance at me. Sadly for me however, was the fact that he was clearly telling the truth, behind him i could see where his kitchen was, and the ceiling was fine, meaning either the roots had grown entirely within the space between the bottom of his ceiling and the top of my floor, or it had no roots at all.



I went home, dejected, and as I went to push open my door it wouldn't budge. I already explained earlier that on this occasion I specifically left my door unlocked, and that was proven further when I tried my key. It wasn't the lock that was holding the door shut, something was on the other side pushing it closed. After trying and failing to open it several times, I decided to shoulder-barge it, but as I hit the door all resistance dissipated and I fell completely on the floor. I laid there on the floor, in the shade of my kitchen tree. I bashed my head a little bit as I hit the floor, so when I got up I went to take a tylenol or something. But for some reason, my faucet wasn’t working. No water came out, and I realised that if the tree was growing in my floor, it was probably breaking my pipes, giving me an opportunity to get my landlord to send someone over to fix it. Someone who would see the tree and see that I'm not crazy.



My plan was working flawlessly, a plumber was coming the next day at 9:30am in order to fix my water, and soon I wouldn't be alone in my tree problem. I decided to try and sleep a bit more so I could wake up in time to see the plumber, but then the tree started groaning. I know trees groan and creak in the wind, but this wasn't that. This was pure moans of despair, sobs and the choking back of tears. Every time I closed my eyes the tree filled my brain with the images of heartbreaks I don't think I can understand. Cries of terror mixed with babies sobbing with the quiet despairs of a grieving parent. I didn’t get any rest. 



After a full night of this the tree’s cries were interrupted by a knock at my door. Thank god. The plumber had finally arrived. I opened the door and to my utter horror he just said:



“Hi, I'm here about the plumbing.”



No mention of the 8 foot tall tree growing into my ceiling. No mentions of the wails echoing from its branches. Nothing. I had no choice than to let him in and watch him fix my plumbing, which turned out to be ENTIRELY UNRELATED to the tree. I walked to the other side of the kitchen, when I saw it, atop the red stool in the caver crack in the tree. The photograph. If I just reached in and showed it to the plumber, maybe he would understand. I pushed my fingers in between the bark of the tree, and grasped the photo. It was at this moment that the plumber turned around. 



“Oh my god! What are you doing?! Stay away from me!” 



He dropped his bag and ran out of my apartment. I tried to pull my hand out but I swear it was tighter than when I put it in. my left hand is stuck in the tree. It's been an hour and nobody will pick up their phones, not even the police. This is my only idea, but i don't know if anyone will see this. If you do, please help me. Nobody else can see it, and i’m afraid of what they see instead.
