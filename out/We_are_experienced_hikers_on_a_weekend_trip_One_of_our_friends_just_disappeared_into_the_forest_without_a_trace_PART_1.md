‘He’s gone’ I startle awake, elbow forcefully jamming into Chris’ side as I steal him from his sleep. It was around 7 when I heard him outside his tent, pacing about on the dry leaves. The noise stopped a short while later. It is now 8:30, any traces of Richard, his tent, or supplies, have disappeared.

‘What… what do you mean’ Chris blinked, groggily. He squinted as his face emerged from the sleeping bag.

‘Richard’s left, he’s gone, where the fuck is he?’. I start scrambling, pulling at the zips on my sleeping bag as I get into a crouching position to leave the tent. The forest floor is untouched, any traces of Richard have been scrubbed from its memory, masked in a thick layer of auburn leaves. How long has he been gone? Can’t have been more than an hour?

‘Is he taking a piss?’ Chris asks, dismissively.

‘No, like he’s fucking gone and left, he’s taken his tent down and disappeared.’ This startled him into a sense of alert.

‘No, you’re joking, where’s he gone?’. Chris’ head peers over my shoulder into the clearing.

‘He’s honestly taking the piss, what the fuck’s he gotten up to’. I get out of the tent and into an upright position, my joints creaking as I take a few steps to examine the clearing and the nearby woods for any signs of Richard. A neat patchwork of pine trees envelops the surroundings. At certain angles I can see between the long promenades of trees, helpfully arranged in straight rows to provide a narrow view of the distance; but this doesn’t help much.

This isn’t like him. We’re 12 years into these hiking trips and not once has he ever strayed so much as a few feet from the group. We are all very much team players and rely on group consensus for any important decisions. My stomach exudes a feeling of discomfort and unease. Did he tell us he was leaving? I honestly don’t remember.

I clamber back into the tent and over Chris, rummaging through the rucksack until my hands grasp a cold metallic slab. I take my phone and re-enter the clearing, raising it en-pointe towards the sky as if offering it up to some unseen deity. No signal. I swear I had at least two bars last night. We set up camp here because it’s the first place for miles that I received any notifications. I meant to give Jane a message to let her know we were okay. Shit - I’ll have to call her when I get the chance.

Chris’ eyes widen and he starts moving with urgency as he heads back towards the tent. He pulls out a waterproof jacket and fumbles through the pockets for his phone.

‘I was going to show you how these worked, but I got some of those trackers a few months ago. Because of the bag and shit we lost last time I thought we could put these on all our stuff.’

Chris’ explanations were muddled under the weight of his intense concentration. He stares, unblinking at his phone, hands shaking slightly as he opens and closes apps until he finds the right one.

‘I think I put two in Rich’s bag thinking it was mine, I couldn’t find them in my rucksack last night.’

I don’t respond, as if not to break the spell of this alchemist working unearthly magic to return our friend.

‘Here’, he exclaims with some confidence, showing me the phone screen. I see a map. Barely a map, more a large, deep green plane with very few details. But I notice some pinpoints, in two bunches at top and bottom of the display. Chris gestures to the bottom group. ‘This is us, I think, and the ones up there are the ones Rich has got’. He taps the screen and we zoom in on the ones we think to be Richard’s.

‘There’s no way’ I retort. ‘That’s 22 miles away, he’s been gone a fucking hour, how did he get 22 miles away? Do we even know what direction that’s in?’.

‘Mate, I don’t know’ Chris lets out a nervous chuckle to break the tension. ‘But it’s GPS and it says five minutes ago’. He swipes the screen to refresh, the pinpoints shuffle slightly further up the screen as the time now reads ’60 secs ago’.

‘I mean he’s a runner, maybe he went full pelt over there’ Chris smirks and looks for my validation.

‘That’s insane’ I spit back, exasperated. ‘He can’t have gone that far. That’s fucking ridiculous. Did someone give him a lift?’ I sense my sarcasm cutting at Chris so I reel it in and collect myself.

‘How accurate are these? Is it still tracking him?’. Chris doesn’t respond, instead tilting the phone screen in my direction so I can verify it for myself.

‘He’s taken his shit, and he’s headed off in that direction’ Chris gestures through the dense thatch of trees. ‘We planned to be out here for three nights, so we can get to him by this evening, and head back in the morning, we’ll be ‘aight’.

‘Is he still moving?’ I ask. I resign myself the premises of this situation and start prodding at the feasibility of Chris’ plan.

‘Looks like he’s settled for now’ Chris replies. ‘When we get signal, we’ll give him a call or something and ask him to head back towards us’.

‘He might be lost though, how’s he going to make his way back?’

‘Look, once we speak with him we can sort this out. Unless he’s gone absolutely mad, we can get him to meet us somewhere. It’s about 9am now, we could make it by 4ish if we head off now’

Without waiting for my agreement, Chris reaches for his rucksack and starts fixing it on his back. I do the same. I feel a tightness in my stomach, an unease which seeps into my bones. I think of Jane and I sweep the sky for phone signal in one last hail Mary attempt. No luck. I follow Chris’ lead and fasten my rucksack on tight. We head off into the woods in search of Richard.

The forest becomes thicker as we journey forward. We are slowed by the tangle of dead branches and shallow roots. I watch where I step, and I feel a creeping pain in my neck from holding it at an uncomfortable angle. The cacophony of bugs and insects ring just slightly louder than my tinnitus. We travel in silence for a large part of the journey. Chris keeps his eyes fixed on the way forward, only interrupted by a brief glance at his phone to ensure the path ahead is correct. We have missed our deadline by a good few hours, but Richard has not moved in that time. The pinpoints show his location as unchanged, with only slight shifts left and right, as if he’s swaying in some drunken stupor. At least it gives us confidence that they’re still on his person. I clench my fists as I resist the urge to scratch the bug bites covering my forearms and shins, shaking sweat from my hands every now and then. I get flashes of discomfort when I feel my clothes sticking to me, and the aches and pains of having walked nearly 20 miles. The GPS, and our exhaustion, are the only indicators that we have made progress. The scenery remains monolithic.

The sun starts to set as we close in on Richard. We start calling out his name, softly at first, as if too loud a sound would anger the forest. With confidence growing and distance narrowing, we shout for him. Sweat and spittle rain from my face as the last of my energy is spent demanding his attention. No response. The night robs us of the ability to see more than a few dozen feet in front of us. So, I listen. I hear only the footsteps of Chris and I. The insects grow louder, but so does the sound of running water.

As if by some break in the fabric of reality, the forest suddenly and unexpectedly stops. We come to a large clearing, about the length of a football pitch. The forest still dominates the surroundings, lining the other side of the clearing as it continues to stretch for countless miles further. But the clearing is wide, at least a mile or more in length, further than I can see at this time of day. The dense undergrowth has given way to soft grass, trees replaced by wild bushes no more than a foot high.

A river runs through the clearing, dividing it in two down the middle. The jagged rocks on the riverbed cut ripples into the water’s surface. It looks jet black and viscous, harshly reflecting the moonlight off its inky surface. In front of us, the river forks and rejoins not much further down, forming an ellipsis-shaped island in the middle. A large oak tree with a wide base and thick trunk stands defiantly in the middle of the island, alone. It stands large and squat against the backdrop of imposing pine trees, unusually conspicuous in an already abrupt clearing. I grab Chris’ hand to turn the phone towards me. All it shows is the same deep green forest we have spent our day, nothing on the map suggests that there is a stream here, or where it may lead.

Richard’s there. He’s by the tree. Oh my fucking God. I feel the energy surging back as I sprint towards the riverbank now screaming his name, my throat burning. Chris takes only a moment to catch on and he’s there running alongside me, flailing his arms as if stranded at sea. I take about three steps into the water before the cold hits me. Compared to the warmth of the day, the water feels icy and hostile. I flinch and take a few steps back towards the riverbank.

I take this opportunity to get a better look at Richard. All I can make out is his silhouette, standing motionless to the left of the tree. His face is completely obscured by shadows, I can’t tell if he’s facing towards or away from us. The lights of our headlamps dissipate before reaching the island. Chris is continuing to shout Richard’s name, punctuated by a few ‘What the fuck are you doing’s and ‘How the fuck did you get there’s. But Richard just remains, motionless in the dark, as if dissolving into the vast expanse of the forest behind him.

I return to the edge of the clearing to grab my rucksack. I must have shed it when we started running towards the riverbank, but I certainly don’t remember doing that, it wasn’t my focus. Chris doesn’t wait, wading into the waist-high water without a second thought. He lets out a few pained grunts as the water envelops his torso and stomach. His arms ride abreast the water, and he glides slowly through towards Richard. I’m not far behind him, clenching my teeth as I brace for the first few steps in.

  
Second part coming soon.
