The way my job started wasn’t unique. It’s a story you may have even heard before. 

I got my heart broken pretty bad and hit rock bottom. Drinking, drugs, sleeping, and unemployment would sum up my day to day. 

It got to the point that I had people coming over - friends and family of mine - and performing check ups on me with poor disguises. For example, “it’s been forever since we got food together.” or “why don’t we go running like we used to.” It annoyed me because I felt pitied. But honestly, it’s a blessing to have people who care enough to. 

But I rarely took them up on it. And eventually they dropped the disguises. A painfully long, awkward intervention with all my friends, my parents and my sister. Tears, yelling, pleading. All so painfully uncomfortable. 

In the end, I agreed and promised I would get out of the house. Get a job. Do something with myself other than waste away in my dingy apartment.

I looked around, but the idea of working a cash register or some other monotonous 9 to 5 was unbearable.

After some time, I came across an ad online:

A tour guide. That was an idea. It would get me out of the house and I like nature. I used to be very active before my spiraling. Why not?

So I sent them an email to inquire about any open positions. They responded quickly. Very quickly - as in, within a few seconds. Definitely strange, but it was easy to brush off. 

The email was polite, almost warm, and invited me to come in within the week for an interview.

The “office” was a trailer at the edge of the park, door propped open, letting in the smell of pine and wet earth. Inside was a desk, two folding chairs, and a man who looked almost as nervous as I was.

He shook my hand without smiling and motioned for me to sit. His eyes were glassy- not unfriendly, just unreadable.

He asked me some pretty basic stuff. Have I ever done any similar work? How well did I know Blackmouth? How am I at following instructions?

I really did my best to make myself look good. And apparently it worked, he offered me the job. 

I asked him about the pay and he told me I’d be given a quarter share of the profits. A tour was about 30$, and a group is usually around 3-10 people. That put me at 22.5$-75$ per tour.

And if I was fast I could get through 4, maybe 5 tours a day. It's a pretty broad range, but I calculated I could make between 112$ and 375$ every day. 

To put that into perspective, if I was able to get through enough people in a day, I’d be paid the equivalent of about 45$ per hour. 

My boss went on, 

“Now, you won’t be taking the guests the whole way,” he said. 

“Halfway through, there’s another guide who’ll take over. You just hand them off and head back for the next group.”

A quarter pay for half the work? Way too much to say no to. 

And so I didn’t.

My first day started earlier than I’d woken up in months. The sky was still a deep navy when I pulled into the gravel lot. My breath fogged in the cold, the air smelling faintly of rain and cedar.

The trailer door was open again, light spilling out onto the dirt.

Inside, the man from the interview was at the desk, head down over a folder. Without looking up, he slid an envelope across to me.

I opened it.

It was just a map of my route. He explained it to me, but he never looked me in the eyes. He spoke quickly, like he dreaded the entire conversation.

Behind the route was a single sheet of paper with a typed list of names. Ten in all.

Today’s first group. It was a pretty diverse spread - some couples, some young, some old.

I jerked my head up as my boss dropped something heavy on the desk in front of me. A worn, sackcloth bag tied with a string. Like something out of a movie. 

He told me I’d need it. 

I loosened the string and peeked inside.

Coins.

Not the shiny kind you dump into a vending machine - these were dull, heavy discs with worn edges and a faint greenish patina. The faces stamped on them were unfamiliar, the lettering in some alphabet I didn’t recognize.

“They’re for the river.” he said flatly.

I thought he was joking, some touristy tradition for good luck. But the way he said it, eyes still down, voice tight, made me think twice about asking.

“Don’t lose them.”

I nodded, still unsure if this was a weird hazing ritual or if I’d signed on for something I didn’t fully understand.

Outside, the sky was bleeding into a pale grey, and I could hear voices gathering in the lot - my first group, chatting and laughing as they waited.

I stuffed the map, the list, and the bag of coins into my pack and stepped out to meet them.

I put on my best retail smile and greeted them like I was thrilled to be there.

They smiled back, some with polite nods, others with that eager spark tourists get when they’ve got a camera ready and nowhere else to be.

We started along the trail, the dirt path winding through tall pines that whispered in the breeze. Somewhere off to the left, a woodpecker worked away at a trunk. I spotted a flash of blue, a jay darting between branches,  and pointed it out like it was part of the official program.

I walked them through the first landmarks.

Echo Point, a rock outcropping where sound bounced back in a strange, delayed way. The Split Oak, an ancient tree with a lightning scar splitting its trunk clean in two. The Devil’s Step, a shallow stone shelf where the river narrowed into a fast, white ribbon.

I recited the facts from my script in a bright, practiced tone, throwing in the occasional chuckle, nodding like I’d told these same tidbits a thousand times but still found them fascinating.

I was quite proud of myself for the act I was putting on. 

On the surface, it was just another nature walk.

But in my pack, I could feel the weight of that sackcloth bag thumping against my side with every step.

And then, just as the sun was beginning to come back down, it was time for the main attraction.

I led them down the last slope, where the trees gave way to bare rock. The entrance to Blackmouth yawned ahead of us, low and wide, like a mouth set in a permanent sneer.

Inside, the temperature dropped ten degrees in an instant. My voice echoed faintly against the walls as I launched into the script about the cave’s geology, how the limestone had been carved over millennia.

We rounded a bend and the main attraction came into view; a wide, slow-moving river cutting right through the heart of the cave. Its surface was black and glossy, reflecting the dim yellow from the string of safety lamps bolted into the rock. The sound was steady but strangely muted, like the water was moving under a layer of glass.

“This is the Blackmouth River,” I told them, smiling like a proud host. “It runs underground for nearly six miles before resurfacing in a nearby valley. Local legend says no one has ever swum the full length and come out the other side.”

A couple of people laughed softly. The rest leaned over the railing to snap photos.

We followed the narrow walkway that hugged the wall of the cave, the river sliding silently beside us. The lamps overhead gave off a weak yellow light, just enough to paint the wet rock in streaks.

Up ahead, the path widened into a stone platform jutting out over the water. This was where I was supposed to give the final part of the speech - the bit about the river’s depth, the sediment, the wildlife - before turning everyone over to the other guide.

I was halfway through my line about freshwater crabs when I saw him. 

He stood on the far side of the platform, where the light didn’t quite reach. He was tall, and he wore a heavy coat with a wide-brimmed hat shadowing his face.

Behind him, tethered to the stone, was a boat. If you could call it that. 

It wasn’t like the park’s rafts or canoes. This thing was narrow and low to the water, the wood so dark it almost looked black. An oar lay across the seats, the handle worn smooth, the blade stained as though it had been in the river for decades.

I figured he was just going for that “old-timey” look. Something for the tourists. Maybe he’d get them to pose for photos before the ride back. Still, the dripping hem of his coat caught my eye. It hung heavy, sodden, as if he’d just stepped out of the water instead of down from the trail.

He raised one gloved hand, palm up.

I remembered the sackcloth bag in my pack. The one my boss had told me was for the river.

I slipped it from my shoulder and crossed the platform, forcing a friendly nod.

“Guess you’re taking them the rest of the way?” I said.

He didn’t answer. Just took the bag in a slow, deliberate motion before stepping back toward the boat.

I was uneasy, the guy gave me the creeps. But my boss had warned me about this. This was normal. This was part of the job. 

I turned back to the group and gestured toward him like this was just another attraction.

 “Alright folks, this is where you’ll head out with our river guide. He’ll get you to the turnaround point and bring you back safe and sound.”

They didn’t ask questions. Nobody hesitated. They filed toward him in neat pairs, stepping onto the platform with quiet, practiced movements, as if they’d already been told what to do.

One by one, they climbed into the boat. It rocked slightly with each step — but the water around it stayed perfectly still. No ripples. No sound.

Halfway through loading, I glanced down at my list and froze.

One of the names had a thick black line drawn through it. I didn’t remember seeing that before.

When I looked back up, there was one less person in line.

I scanned the group. Ten names, but now only nine faces. My mouth went dry.

The ferryman’s hat tilted up just enough for me to see the shadow of his jaw, pale and sharp. His hand rested on the oar, still as stone.

“Everything alright?” one of the guests asked, her voice startling me.

I forced a smile. “Yeah. Just making sure everyone’s on board.”

The boat pushed off, gliding into the black water. The guests sat silent and straight-backed, their faces dimming until they were swallowed by the dark.

I turned and began my walk back, glancing sporadically at the list of guests. 1 name crossed out. Then 3, then 8, then 10. Every name.

By the time I reached the bend in the cave, the paper was trembling in my hand. Ten names, every one now slashed through with that same thick black line.

I stopped and listened.

The cave was dead silent. No water, no echoes, nothing. It was like someone had muted the world.

Then, from somewhere deep in the darkness behind me, I heard the slow, deliberate sound of an oar dipping into water. One stroke. Then another. Getting closer.

I didn’t look back. I folded the list, shoved it in my pocket, and forced my legs to move until the dim daylight from the cave mouth came into view.

The rest of the day blurred together. I kept running tours, trying to put on the same cheery face as before, but my stomach stayed knotted. None of the people from that first group ever came back down the trail. I told myself they’d taken a different exit, that maybe the other guide had his own drop-off point.

But by closing time, the lot was nearly empty. No cars matching theirs. No chatter from hikers packing up for the day. 4 groups that day. 32 total guests. And not one of them had made their way back. 

The park felt hollow. Just the sound of the wind in the pines, and the faint smell of river water sticking to me like glue. It made me uneasy.

I headed back to the trailer to clock out. The door was propped open again, light spilling onto the dirt. My boss was inside at the desk, a stack of papers in front of him, pen scratching slowly across the top sheet. He didn’t look up when I stepped in.

“Hey,” I said, keeping my tone light. “Weird question, but… where do the groups go after I hand them over? I didn’t see anyone come back.”

He didn’t look up. “They finish the route.”

“Yeah, but I mean… does it loop back to the parking lot? I never saw them.”

A pause, just long enough to notice. 

“They don’t come back this way. How was the river today?”

I forced a small laugh, like his answer had cleared it all up. 

“Fine. Yeah. The river was fine.”

It wasn’t, but I let myself believe it anyway. Maybe there really was another trail. Maybe there was a shuttle back to the lot I just hadn’t seen.

I signed out, muttered a “See you tomorrow,” and stepped out into the cooling air. The sun was gone behind the trees, and the path to my car felt longer than usual. Every step carried that faint damp smell from the cave, clinging stubbornly to my clothes.

When I got home, the first thing I noticed was the smell. It was stronger than even my clothes. Coming from my kitchen. 

Inside, the lights were off. But on my kitchen table sat a neat stack of coins. Dull, heavy coins with the now familiar faces and language. 

I didn’t move at first. Just stood there in the dark, staring at the stack.

Droplets clung to them, catching what little light leaked in from the street. A thin ring of moisture had already formed on the table around them, slowly spreading.

32 guests. 64 coins given to me that morning. And now 16 in my kitchen, waiting for me.

My quarter share for that day.

The old man in the trailer had just been the middleman. That much was obvious now.

Whoever, whatever  had left these in my kitchen, that was the one I really worked for.

And judging by the smell rolling off the stack, thick and cold and heavy in the air, they’d already been in the river.
