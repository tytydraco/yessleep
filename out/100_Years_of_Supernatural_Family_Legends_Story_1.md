I remember when I was six years old, my father told us about his grandfather's encounter with something inexplicable.

The story took place in 1926. At that time, Tajikistan was part of the Soviet Union as an autonomous region of the Uzbek SSR. The locals were primarily engaged in agriculture. My great-grandfather was 16 years old then and already married. He worked in his uncle's field, which was located 15 kilometers from his home. Like most Tajiks, he lived in a village. His workday started at 7 AM, so he would leave home at 4 or 5 AM and ride to work on his horse.

Every morning, his wife, my great-grandmother would prepare breakfast for him, which included a warm flatbread, fresh milk and soup. My father recalled that the smell of these flatbreads was incredibly delicious and the most pleasant to him.

One night, his wife made three flatbreads for him. He took them and set off for work. The only source of light illuminating his path was the moon. His route consisted of three kilometers through the village, then crossing a river, passing through a small forested area, the ruins of an ancient city, and finally his uncle's cultivated field. He always carried a rifle with him in case of attacks by bandits or thieves.

The ruins of the city were always avoided, as several hundred years earlier, there had been a massacre during the city’s capture, and all 20,000 inhabitants had been killed. There were rumors of spirits of the dead in the area, but my great-grandfather did not believe in these superstitions, as ghosts do not exist in Islam. He had passed through this area every morning for two years without incident.

After crossing the village, the river, and the forested area on his horse, he reached the ruins of the old city. Hungry, he stopped, pulled a flatbread from his bag, broke off a piece, and began to eat. The flatbreads were still warm, and their aroma spread everywhere. Just as he was finishing the flatbread, he heard a raspy, intermittent, heart-wrenching sound. He turned around and saw a hairy creature about 2-2.5 meters tall. The creature was completely covered in hair—not fur, but actual hair. Every part of its body was covered in thick dark hair, except for its face.

Great-grandfather immediately drew his rifle, loaded it, and aimed at the creature. It was five meters away and slowly approaching. Great-grandfather fired, but the bullet missed. The creature was startled, growled, and took another step forward. Great-grandfather shouted that if it came closer, he would shoot it in the head, and then he heard a baby's cry.

Looking closer, he finally saw the creature’s face. It was a woman with a normal female face but with a slightly elongated chin. Her skin was snow-white, and her eyes were so blue they glowed like bright blue lanterns. She was holding something, and when she looked at grandfather, he saw that she was holding a baby. The baby appeared to be a normal human infant, wrapped in rags. The woman was trying to soothe the baby. Her voice was initially creaky and guttural, but as she calmed the baby, it gradually became soft and feminine.

Great-grandfather was horrified, still keeping her in his sights, and he froze. Once the baby was calm, she shifted her gaze from the child to grandfather and said:

— Bread... give.

Her voice turned creaky again, and grandfather's terror increased even more. He examined her and finally realized who she was.

— Do you want a flatbread? — great-grandfather asked.

She nodded.

— Are you alone in this city?

Nod.

— Whose child is this, yours?

She did not answer.

— Whose child is this?

Silence again.

— Whose child?!

— MYYYYYYYYY! — she screamed so loudly that every part of great-grandfather's body began to shake with terror; her voice was so heart-wrenching.

A Shot. Great-grandfather aimed for the head. She turned away and fell to her knees. Her moan was audible, like a wounded dog's. The child began crying again. Great-grandfather slowly approached and saw that she had placed the child on the ground. With a sudden jerk, she turned around, screaming with all her might, and attacked him. Great-grandfather defended himself with the rifle, but she was incredibly strong. She struck with her powerful limbs, and he fended them off with the rifle, holding it with both hands. She grabbed the rifle with one hand and wrenched it from him, tossing it aside. Before Great-grandfather could understand what was happening, he was struck in the face. Her claws tore through the skin on his cheek, exposing the bone and shattering his jaw, knocking out two teeth. Great-grandfather fell to the ground. His head spun. She stood in fury, looking down at him. A bullet from the rifle had hit her right ear. The child cried loudly. She turned to look at him, and Great-grandfather, with his last ounce of strength, surged up from his spot and clasped her with both arms, pinning her arms to her waist. She tried to break free, but was unsuccessful. Great-grandfather, the village wrestling champion in "Gushtin," threw the two-meter creature over his shoulder. She crashed headfirst into the ground with full force, and a crunch was heard. Fueled by adrenaline, Great-grandfather quickly got up and ran toward the rifle, which was near the child. He picked up the rifle and noticed the child's face.

One eye was closed, and there was a white patch on the lower part of the closed eye, extending from the lower eyelid to the hair on the head. The hair around the patch was gray. At that moment, Great-grandfather realized where she had gotten the child from. Sometimes, children with disabilities or deformities were simply abandoned.
Great-grandfather lowered the rifle, took the child, and, soothing him, carried him back to the woman. She was still lying on her side on the ground but was conscious. Given that she turned her head toward Great-grandfather, her neck was not broken. He bent down and placed the child next to her. She pulled the child close and embraced him.

Great-grandfather returned to his horse, took a flatbread and a bottle of milk, and placed them beside the woman. According to Great-grandfather, when he gave her the food, she looked at him and he saw tears in her eyes. Great-grandfather silently nodded and walked back to the horse. He then mounted the horse and rode to work, where he received medical attention.
The claw marks were deep and took a long time to heal. Even after so long, they still ached.
He never saw her again and didn’t know what happened to her, but every day for another six months, he left a flatbread and a little milk at the place where he had once encountered her.
At the end of 1945, after the end of World War II, Great-grandfather was in one of the schools where he had brought his younger daughter for her first grade. On one wall, on a poster of fallen heroes, he noticed a young man who had been posthumously awarded the title of hero for bravery. He was smiling and glowing in the photograph. One eye was closed, and there was a white patch on the lower part of the closed eye, extending from the lower eyelid to the hair on the head.
