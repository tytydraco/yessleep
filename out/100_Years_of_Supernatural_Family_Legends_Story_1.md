Strange and inexplicable things happen often, and nearly everyone encounters them at some point. However, the number of such stories in my family, and personally for me, exceeds all norms. I was born and raised in Tajikistan—a country in Central Asia where 90% of the population are Muslims. Tajiks, being descendants of Persians, have a rich tradition of Arab and Persian folklore that forms the basis of their culture. From childhood, Tajik children are frightened not by bogeymen, but by ghouls, djinns, and spirits. But telling scary stories is one thing; sharing real experiences is quite another.

I remember when I was six years old, my father told us about his grandfather's encounter with something inexplicable.

The story took place in 1926. At that time, Tajikistan was part of the Soviet Union as an autonomous region of the Uzbek SSR. The locals were primarily engaged in agriculture. My great-grandfather was 16 years old then and already married. He worked in his uncle's field, which was located 15 kilometers from his home. Like most Tajiks, he lived in a village. His workday started at 7 AM, so he would leave home at 4 or 5 AM and ride to work on his horse.

Every morning, his wife, my great-grandmother would prepare breakfast for him, which included a warm flatbread, fresh milk and soup. My father recalled that the smell of these flatbreads was incredibly delicious and the most pleasant to him.

One night, his wife made three flatbreads for him. He took them and set off for work. The only source of light illuminating his path was the moon. His route consisted of three kilometers through the village, then crossing a river, passing through a small forested area, the ruins of an ancient city, and finally his uncle's cultivated field. He always carried a rifle with him in case of attacks by bandits or thieves.

The ruins of the city were always avoided, as several hundred years earlier, there had been a massacre during the city’s capture, and all 20,000 inhabitants had been killed. There were rumors of spirits of the dead in the area, but my great-grandfather did not believe in these superstitions, as ghosts do not exist in Islam. He had passed through this area every morning for two years without incident.

After crossing the village, the river, and the forested area on his horse, he reached the ruins of the old city. Hungry, he stopped, pulled a flatbread from his bag, broke off a piece, and began to eat. The flatbreads were still warm, and their aroma spread everywhere. Just as he was finishing the flatbread, he heard a raspy, intermittent, heart-wrenching sound. He turned around and saw a hairy creature about 2-2.5 meters tall. The creature was completely covered in hair—not fur, but actual hair. Every part of its body was covered in thick dark hair, except for its face.

Great-grandfather immediately drew his rifle, loaded it, and aimed at the creature. It was five meters away and slowly approaching. Great-grandfather fired, but the bullet missed. The creature was startled, growled, and took another step forward. Great-grandfather shouted that if it came closer, he would shoot it in the head, and then he heard a baby's cry.

Looking closer, he finally saw the creature’s face. It was a woman with a normal female face but with a slightly elongated chin. Her skin was snow-white, and her eyes were so blue they glowed like bright blue lanterns. She was holding something, and when she looked at grandfather, he saw that she was holding a baby. The baby appeared to be a normal human infant, wrapped in rags. The woman was trying to soothe the baby. Her voice was initially creaky and guttural, but as she calmed the baby, it gradually became soft and feminine.

Great-grandfather was horrified, still keeping her in his sights, and he froze. Once the baby was calm, she shifted her gaze from the child to grandfather and said:

— Bread... give.

Her voice turned creaky again, and grandfather's terror increased even more. He examined her and finally realized who she was.

— Do you want a flatbread? — great-grandfather asked.

She nodded.

— Are you alone in this city?

Nod.

— Whose child is this, yours?

She did not answer.

— Whose child is this?

Silence again.

— Whose child?!

— MYYYYYYYYY! — she screamed so loudly that every part of great-grandfather's body began to shake with terror; her voice was so heart-wrenching.

The baby started crying again, and the woman began to soothe it. Great-grandfather, still keeping his rifle ready, approached closer and noticed some deformities in the baby. One eye was closed, and there was a white spot extending from the lower eyelid to the hair on the head. The hair in the area of the spot was gray. At that moment, grandfather understood where the ghoul had gotten the baby. Sometimes, children with disabilities or deformities were simply abandoned.

Great-grandfather lowered his rifle, returned to his horse, took a flatbread and a bottle of milk, and handed them to the woman. According to grandfather, when he gave her the food, she looked at him and thanked him with a normal female voice. Great-grandfather nodded and advised her to take care of the baby. Then he mounted his horse and rode off to work. He never saw her again, but every day for another six months, he left a flatbread and some milk at the spot where he had once encountered her.

Great-Grandfather told this story only to his close family, and strangely, no one was surprised. Many knew that in the hills near the abandoned city, there had once lived creatures known as ghouls. Most of them had been killed between 1917 and 1919.

This was the first story of its kind that I had ever heard in my life. The first, but not the last.
