\*\*\*

I stomped out what remained of the cigarette and got back in the car. I could feel the nicotine working, both heightening and calming my senses simultaneously. I was wired in and ready. I clicked off the hazards and steered onto the road, then took a right turn onto a gravel path which led up to Kelsie P’s residence.

The trees seemed to close-in around the path like French claw-clips around a couple fingers. Even with my brights on, the winding road never allowed for more than ten yards of visibility. I rolled the window down and listened to the crackling melody of small stones crunching under Bess’s Continentals, and the persistent falling of rain against the hood. I checked the map, then lifted my eyes and saw the gravel path fork off to the right, fleeing from the large clearing that was Kelsie P’s driveway.

And what a driveway it was. 

One moment I was in Northern Illinois, driving on a gravel path through a quasi-forest. And the next I was in a Westminster Abbey courtyard. The rough road smoothed out into a cobblestone square, enclosed by a brick half-wall which picketed around the property, separating it from the natural surroundings. The only entrance was a gate, already opened, which was straddled between two marble obelisks. 

I entered.

The building, which could most aptly be referred to as a chateau, was set at the end of a topiary garden. Two rows of geometrically shaped hedges bordered a wide walkway leading up to a set of cement stairs and a porch. I pulled through the cobblestone square and entered what from the sky would have looked like the handle of a giant briefcase, then parked at the precipice of the walkway. 

The rain was coming down pretty hard now, so it was difficult to see outside, but through the intermittent swipes of my wiper blades I could make out a space of flat land surrounding the house, separating it from the brick fence. Splotches of grass were beginning to bud up from the moist earth, and the hedges, with their implanted roots, seemed merely to be a more advanced and curated form of the grass itself. I glanced once more over at the porch which was lit with two welcoming lanterns, then turned my attention back inside the car.

I spent a minute fiddling with my jacket, making sure it was properly fitted. Then I checked my phone for messages before sliding it into my pocket and grabbing the Lazy Dog bag. I held it in my lap while looking into the rearview mirror. I could see my face: barely lit by the car’s embedded light sources. My brown hair was cut short, military style, and even in the dark I could see the gray streaking through like a spray of off-white paint. My eyes were hard and tired, but stretched wide with adrenaline provided by the cigarette. Or at least that’s what I told myself was causing it. I sniffed, then coughed. Probably there was still some flour in my nostrils. I grimaced, then I looked back out the passenger window. And the last thought I had before exiting the car was that none of the windows were lit. *The house was completely dark—except for the porch lights.*

I jogged through the rain with the bag clutched against my chest. It only took fifteen seconds to clear the walkway and make it up the stairs, but in that time the rain had soaked my hair. I started to pat it out when a burst of thunder came on the heels of a lightning bolt, and for a moment the entire world was bright as in daylight hours. I saw the hedges and thought they looked menacing in that brief spark: as if they were creatures stalking under cover of darkness, suddenly exposed. Then I looked to the right and saw the porch continue around the house like one might see in the country. I wiped my face, then turned to ring the doorbell. But the door creaked open before I could click the button.

The lady was around 5’4”, maybe thirty years old, and had thin brown hair combed neatly behind her shoulders. From what I could make out in the dim exterior light, her skin looked pallor, and her face was sunken and tired. She gripped the door with the weak fingers of her right hand, holding it only slightly ajar.

“Good Evening,” I said with a nod. “I have an order for Kelsie P.” I twisted the bag in my hand to expose the tag with Kelsie’s name on it.

She stared blankly at it for several seconds, and I got the impression that this woman had other things on her mind. When she finally registered my question, a look of surprise swept over her features, and she effused an “Oh, hello,” as if she had just seen me. “I’m—” she stumbled, “Kelsie P, that’s me.” She smiled weakly and looked behind me. “Sorry about the rain. It must be a hard night to be out.”

I nodded again and said, “Well, generous tips like yours make it all worth it. Plus, it’s not like you control the weather.”

Her smile stretched, seeming more genuine. “I’m glad,” she replied. “And, you’re right. But, you know…” she trailed off, and for a few seconds there was only the sound of rain pattering against the wooden overhang. Then Kelsie said, “well, thank you,” and reached for the bag.

I held it back, a reaction which prompted her to jerk her hand back inside the dark crevice of her doorway. I retrieved my phone from my pocket and held it up so she could see the Dasher app. “Sorry, ma’am. Protocol for alcohol deliveries. I have to scan your ID.”

“Oh,” she responded nervously. She looked over her shoulder, as if someone was trying to speak to her from inside. Then she turned back to me and said, “I left my purse in the dining room. Do you mind if I go and get it? Shouldn’t be a minute.”

“Please,” I replied. “Take your time.”

I listened to her footsteps trail off down the hallway; when I was sure she was gone, I pressed the door open another few inches and peered inside. As expected, all of the lights were turned off. Only a few candles were lit in the living room. I made note of the spiraling staircase directly up ahead, and the hallway beside it which presumably led to the kitchen and dining room. I listened for another minute, and just as I was beginning to worry, I heard Kelsie’s footfalls returning from the back of the house. I backed up a couple feet and waited.

When Kelsie returned, I could tell immediately she was different. Her breathing was deep and disturbed. Her voice sounded unsure as she said, “Sorry . . . about the wait. My purse, I couldn’t—”

“It’s no problem,” I interjected. “It looks like your power went out.”

Her hand, which was rummaging through her purse with frantic speed, froze, and I could see her fingers trembling. She looked back into her house, as if just realizing where she was. Then she turned back and said, “Oh, yes. It went out with the storm.” She confirmed then continued to rummage.

“Are you sure?” I replied and reached forward, placing my hand atop her purse to stop her motion. Then, while keeping the Lazy Dog bag hooked around my wrist, I raised my index finger and placed it over my lips. I met her wide, terrified eyes, and at this distance, I could see they were hazel. When I was sure she was not going to scream, I lowered my finger, and while keeping my other hand over her purse, I whispered very quietly: “I know everything. I’m here to help. Will you let me do that?”

She was staring into my eyes, but I could tell something in the house was agitating her. Her head kept rotating over her shoulder, as if pulled by a magnet, and it took a concerted effort for her to stop from turning around.

“It’s okay,” I said, filling the silence. “You don’t have to speak. I’ve done this before. There’s one inside, isn’t there? Nod once if there is.”

She gulped, but something in her face told me she was beginning to believe me—trust me, maybe. She nodded once.

“Okay, I’m going to tell you what to do. Don’t worry about the theatrics of it, these things aren’t very socially acute. It’ll all be over very quickly if you do what I say. Do you understand? Nod once if you do.”

She nodded.

“Good. Now, when I release your purse, I want you to count to three in your head, then toss the purse behind you, maybe a good four or five feet. Understand?”

She thought it over, then nodded, and I noticed her fingers had stopped trembling.

“You’re going to pretend like you dropped it, which means you’ll turn around and start cleaning it up. It’s very important that you face the interior of the house in such a way that you can see everything inside. Okay?”

Another nod.

“I’m going to come in and crouch down in front of you, pretending to help. Now this next part is very important. When you see it, I want you to show me where it is with your eyes. This means that you’ll look at it, then look at me, then look back again. Once *I* know where it is, I can take care of it. Do you understand?”

Kelsie nodded, and I could see an intense weight had been lifted off her shoulders.

“Okay, then,” I started, speaking deliberately. “On your mark.” I removed my hand from her purse and nodded.

There were three seconds of quiet anticipation. Thunder croaked in the Heavens. Rain tapped its millions of nimble fingers against the gutter. Another flash of lightning harpooned across the night sky. And then Kelsie swung her arm behind her and released the purse. I heard a dull thud, then the sound of objects sliding across the tile floor. She looked once more into my eyes, and in hers I saw the words, “Please don’t let me down.” Then she turned around and did as I had instructed.

When I stepped inside the foyer, I felt the hairs on my arms and neck raise. It felt like I was walking against a strong winter wind, only the frigid air was saturated with the scent of black licorice. I pushed forward and moved to face Kelsie. “Here, let me help,” I uttered, then crouched down and began to pick up the loose items. I drew a deep breath, steadying my focus. I returned a tube of lipstick to the purse, then looked up into Kelsie’s eyes. They were searching, and I saw that she was drawing shallow breaths through an open mouth. Probably that mouth was dry as the desert air.

This went on for maybe fifteen seconds, at which point Kelsie’s expression warped into one of abject terror. I had to whisper her name to get her attention. She gazed at me, remembering, then looked back over my right shoulder, then back at me. Based on the trajectory of her gaze—up and to the left—I concluded that the creature was probably held up in the upper-right corner of the living room. I gripped the Lazy Dog bag firmly in my left hand, and when I was ready, I offered Kelsie one final nod. Then I threw the bag over my right shoulder, and—spinning in the same direction—I pulled the gun from my left holster with my right hand and aimed it straight at the bag.

I only saw it for a second; its features were nothing more than dark silhouettes in the flickering candlelight. Then the mass lept at me, torpedoing through the sky with inhuman velocity. I pulled the trigger right before the bag and creature crossed paths. There was a brilliant flash of red light as the incendiary bullet ignited the solution and exploded into a billion embers which engulfed the creature completely. It dropped to the ground with a crashing force suggestive of metal, splintering and breaking the floorboards beneath the creature’s tremendous weight.

I didn’t waste any time closing the distance between myself and the thing that had fallen out of the air. In the light of a dozen living room fires, I could see it clearly now, and I kept my gun trained on its abdomen while checking the damage. 

Scarlet cracks manifested all over the creature’s clear, chitin exoskeleton but were focused around the navel cavity where the makeshift bomb had exploded. Unlike a human’s stomach, the creature’s was concave and round like a Spiral Wishing Well. Tight cords of muscle twisted around its core, allowing it unbelievable abdominal strength and rotary ability. Above, its chest was broad and smooth, with only a single pectoral muscle connecting the two arm-like appendages, perhaps four-times the size of an average bodybuilder’s arms, stretching down to its ankles. Its ovular head was connected to its body by a long, snake-like neck which could stretch five, maybe six feet, then contract like an accordion. Attached to its onyx head were five spider-like eyes, and below, a star-patterned incision where its mouth flap would open up to reveal two rows of tiny serrated teeth, overshadowed by two vampire-like incisors. 

“Game over you fucking parasite,” I spat while holstering my gun. When it was put away, I spent a moment observing its exoskeleton armor. While the blast had shattered the entire front portion, I could see the resilient material already beginning to reform. “You’re a persistent bastard, I’ll give you that,” I said and reached behind my head to retrieve the sword which was hidden there beneath the trench coat.

That’s when I heard the front door shut behind me.

Now, as I alluded to previously, this wasn’t my first rodeo. After three dozen successful hunts, Julie and I have been able to create a set of parameters—rules, if you will—for both the creatures and my own methods of engagement. Chief among our discoveries is that there is only ever one “vampod” per household. This rule was *never* broken: so when I heard the creak of the door, then the latch, and then the sound of transformation—a sound which can be mimicked by rubbing two pieces of wet rubber together—I was utterly shocked.

My hand, which had found the sword’s handle, remained in a perpetual reaching-behind-my-head pose as I listened further. Beneath the sound of the attenuating rain, I heard what sounded almost like fast-falling hail. And then I realized what it was. It was the vampod’s death call: a subtle chattering of teeth, indicating its frenzied hunger. I felt a child-like wave of dread pass over me, but I forced myself to turn my head. Sure enough, where Kelsie had previously been standing, there was another vampod. Its beady, black eyes were glaring at me; its mouth was quivering with anticipation. 

*Shit.*

While keeping my right hand on the hilt, I slowly moved my left hand along my waist, reaching for my gun. Just as my fingers touched the rubber grip, the vampod lurched at me. I ducked and rolled further inside the living room, barely escaping the monster’s wide swipe. Then I sprang up, pointed my pistol, and shot an entire clip of incendiary bullets into center mass. The vampod flinched with each bullet, but when the barrage ceased, it once again started stalking toward me.

“Shit,” I said and took off sprinting toward the kitchen. I reloaded the gun and holstered it, then reached inside under my left armpit and pulled a grenade from my belt. Taking one of these things on was hard enough—two would be impossible. I circled back through the hallway with the second vampod close on my tail and chucked the grenade at the wounded one. Then I cut past the spiral staircase and into a small family room on the other side of the house. 

The explosion shook the walls. I knew the grenade alone wouldn’t be enough to kill it, but it should buy me another three minutes while I figured out how to either escape or kill the second one. I ran through the dining room, sliding over the large wooden table, and escaped into the kitchen just as the pursuing vampod slashed the entry-way to pieces. I saw an open door with a flight of stairs leading down to the basement. I considered going through—perhaps there was an egress window I could use to escape. But I knew if there wasn’t one, I’d be toast. 

Then I had an idea.

I ducked behind the island, which took the brunt of the vampod’s next swing, then I stood up dual-wielding my pistols. I shot both clips—28 rounds—while backing up toward the stove. I lagged my left gun long enough to allow my right hand to spin the dials on each of the eight gas burners. Then I pulled the master cable connecting all of the grenade pins and released the belt, allowing it to fall on the ground in front of the stove.

I sprinted toward the family room, knowing I only had six seconds to get as far away from the blast zone as possible. However, with the big gash in the door-way, the vampod was able to recover and leap at me—its force carrying through the wall and into my side. I coughed, feeling one of my ribs break, and fell onto the ground beside the dining room table.

The monster, which had overshot its mark and punctured the wall next to me, pulled itself out and towered over me in the doorway. Time seemed to slow down then. My attention was fixated on the creature’s large incisors which jutted out from its mouth. Its neck elongated, stretching toward me in expectant pleasure, and it released a moan which was a cross between whales singing and a low, distant fog horn. The sound filled the room, along with the scent of black licorice, and just as the creature was going to take me, the pack of grenades exploded, and the entire kitchen went up in flames.

I covered my face, bracing for the heatwave. When it came, it felt like a giant was sweeping me with a molten broom. My fingers sizzled, and later I was sure that if the vampod had not been standing directly in front of me, I would have died right then. The room's temperature gauge jacked up like an uncontrolled steam room, and all around I heard crackling and popping sounds. 

I opened my eyes.

The vampod was lying face-first on the floor several feet away from me. The explosion had not only shattered his exoskeleton, but had warped some of the musculature underneath. Black ichor dripped from its skin, and it writhed, releasing a low, painful moan before going limp.

I felt my own body go limp, drained of its adrenaline-fueled hypervigilance. My side swelled up around the broken rib, and attempting to turn rightside up felt like cutting myself in half with a scalpel. I laid for an unknown duration of time, falling in and out of consciousness as the flames closed in around me. 

The feeling of my flesh melting woke me up. I jutted forward and saw my feet on fire. I screamed, and in my panicked movement, I managed to kick one of the table legs. A simultaneous surge of pain in my shin and torso nearly knocked me out again, but I swallowed it and forced myself to my knees, gritting my teeth as my singed fingers flared with pain. I grunted, wiping the sweat and soot from my forehead, and used my elbows to prop myself up. Then I anchored myself against the side of the table and rose to my bloody feet. Tears rolled down my feverish face, and I realized it was quite possible the entire house was a giant bonfire by now. I had to get out.

I limped through the dining room, only looking back once to confirm the vampod was still lying on the ground behind me. All I could see was a puddle of black liquid. *Good enough,* I thought and pressed on. When I came to the front door, I realized three things. First, it had stopped raining outside. Sometime during my unconsciousness, the storm had passed. Second, the other vampod was also liquidated. And third, a baby was crying upstairs.

I’m ashamed to say that I almost left anyway. I undid the latch on the front door and cracked it wide open, feeling relief in the form of a cool, humid breeze. But before I could take a step outside, I heard the baby scream again. I pressed my wrist into my forehead and closed my eyes. *No one would blame you for leaving,* I thought. I took a deep breath of fresh air and released. Then I looked back toward the source of the cries. *But I’d blame me.* I left the door open and started back inside the house.

It felt like I had a gut full of buck-shot as I ascended the spiral, bracing against the banister in a lovers’ cleave. The fire had spread along the wall and ceiling, but peering into the second floor rooms, I saw they were mostly unafflicted. This fueled my hope that I would have enough time to save the infant, whose cries for help became more and more urgent. I stumbled over the last step and fell forward, nearly lunging into the flaming wall. Luckily I managed to bend—bearing the pain of my rib—and land on my knees. I howled, and for a moment the murky world turned completely black. But it was only a moment, and I picked myself back up, wading through the smoke until I found the nursery.

The fire hadn’t torn inside the room yet, but the air was filled with smoke. We both had to get out of here, and fast. I stumbled toward the sound of the baby’s cries, cursing aloud with each painful step, my raw feet feeling like I had walked a thousand miles over jagged rocks, barefoot. When I finally reached the crib and set in to grab her, the baby thrashed violently against my advances. “I’m here to help,” I said as the infant kicked at my hands. “Come on, now, don’t be like that.” I grabbed for her, but she squirmed out of my grip. The child truly had incredible strength. “Fine,” I yelled and turned indignantly. *I don’t have time for this!* I screamed inside my head. 

That’s when I heard heavy footfalls coming from downstairs. Someone, *or something*, was walking through the main hallway.

“Shit, there’s more?” I said, incredulous. “Fuck,” I spun around and grabbed the child, overpowering her strong legs and pressed her to my chest. “Shhhhh,” I hushed, “I just need to—” I heard the sound of footsteps sprinting up the spiral stairs. “Damn!” I ran with the baby to the closet and stepped inside, closing the louver door behind us. The spaced slats allowed me to see into the room, but it also allowed smoke inside the closet. We’d probably only have a couple minutes before smoke inhalation would rob what little oxygen we had left. I held the baby closer to my neck and waited.

A moment later, a human figure entered the nursery. They stopped at the doorway, and I heard myself whisper “Go away—please, just go away,” under my breath. The figure took a step inside. Then another step, and another. They stopped in the center, as if considering what to do, then she approached the closet. I was so wired-in, I hardly realized the baby had stopped crying. The entire world seemed completely void of noise. 

Then I saw her.

The skin on her face was creamy and doll-like, as if she had used plaster as compound. Her blond hair was tied back in a ponytail, and her facial expression was completely blank. She took another step toward the closet, and I noticed her movements were . . . clunky. The swing of her arms seemed to lag her step, and when they did move, the movement was too fluid, as if my ex-wife was synchronizing her motion to the steady rhythm of a song. 

I didn’t feel shocked when I realized it was Karen. Something in her reddish-brown eyes pulled my concentration, and I suddenly felt like I had been expecting her—that we were meant to rendezvous here. My muscles weakened, and it took all of my effort to keep from dropping the baby. Karen took another step, and I felt my heart beating in my ears. Another step, and I opened my mouth, inhaling deep breaths of smoke. I was becoming lightheaded—disoriented. My skin was crawling, and my reflexes were urging me to run, to escape whatever this disgusting thing pretending to be Karen was. But she had me. I was only a spectator now, and she wanted to show me something—

Suddenly I was back at home-base: an old, two-story energy building Jules and I rented out as a private space to conduct vampod research and store our results. It was dark out, but moonlight poured through the windows. Looking around, I saw the place had been ransacked. Desks and chairs and shards of glass were strewn everywhere, and on the air was the familiar scent of black licorice. “Jules?” I called, walking toward the back offices. I saw several vested men lying on the ground—security guards on our payroll. Their corpses had been ripped apart, and what remained of their bodies were pale and shrunken. I began to shake. “Jules?” I called again, quieter.

I made it to her office. The door was wide open, and I could already see her figure lying on the ground, her blood staining the blue carpet, black. “Jules!” I cried out, dropping on top of her body and feeling for vitals. No pulse. No signs of breathing. “Jules, hold on,” I said and flipped her over, prepared to perform CPR. I fastened my hands together but stopped when I saw her chest—it was caved in. Something had reached through her sternum and literally ripped her heart out. Then I saw her face. Her eyes and mouth were both wide open in a fixed expression of horror.

Tears streamed out of my eyes, but I didn’t make a sound. I was completely stunned. I brought Julie’s body to my chest and hugged her for what felt like hours. Then I heard something. A faint clicking sound. It was coming from behind me, in the corner of the room. I didn’t turn. I didn’t move. I just closed my eyes as the sound of chattering teeth stalked closer.

Then I was back in the closet. Karen’s face was pressed against the door. She was smiling with manic ecstasy, as if she was siphoning my terror through the grated door and ingesting it like a drug. She stuck her tongue out in a licking motion; it was long and sharp, like a lizard’s tongue. And just when I thought she was going to enter and kill us, I heard someone else yell from downstairs. The Karen imposter turned with a scowl. “Carl?” I heard the voice yell, and I immediately thought of Julie.

Karen turned back to me, flashing one more creepy smile before backing up to the nursery window. Then she lunged through the glass, shattering it on her way out of the house.

Julie must have heard the glass shatter, because she started up the stairs. “Carl?” she called again. I stumbled through the door, keeping the silent baby close to my chest. “H—here,” I mumbled.

“Oh my God,” Julie remarked as she entered the room. I fell over into her arms. “It—it was—Kare—Kar” I tried to elaborate, but my voice was weak, and my brain might as well have been a second heart, pumping singular thoughts about escape.

“No time to talk now,” Julie said and guided me toward the stairs. “Cops are on the way. We have to get out of here, pronto.”

I mumbled a barely audible agreement, then let Julie guide me through the upstairs hallway and down the stairs. By the time we exited the house, Julie was partially carrying me on her back. She had taken the baby from me and was holding her with one arm, while the other arm was pointed at my Honda Taurus. “Sorry, Carl,” she said while loading the baby and I into the back seat of her black Escalade. “Can’t have this trace back to us.”

I fell onto the leather seats and groaned, suddenly remembering what it felt like to be an eight year old again—to fall off my bike and skid my knee across the blacktop. Only I didn’t just skid my knee, but my entire body, and whenever it made contact with anything, it was as if the skin was being flayed with a hot knife. I tried to hold on, to resist the blackness that was taking over, but Julie’s voice faded into the background like a head into an infinitely deep pillow, sinking and sinking until the pain in my feet and the smoke and smut in my nostrils and the ringing in my ears all suffocated under the weight of a single point of pressure which bore down like an iron thumb on my forehead.

The last thing I remember before losing consciousness was the bumpiness of the road as we turned onto the gravel path, and the distant sound of an explosion.

Then I was out.
