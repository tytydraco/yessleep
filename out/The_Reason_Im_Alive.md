I shouldn’t believe in ghosts. I know that sounds crazy. But this is something I need to convince myself.  



When I was young a psychic told me that I would never be able to see ghosts. Being the curious kid I was, I was devastated. It’s like being told that unicorns are real but you’ll never be able to see them. But my dad looked relieved. I knew he had many secrets he never told me but I still wonder what he experienced.  



It was about 4-5 years after my dad passed. I moved into this house. It was previously occupied by an old couple. I met them once, briefly. They looked like the kind of people living out their retirement together peacefully.  



When I moved in the house was left clean except for a statue in the corner of the yard. It was just outside my window. I don’t remember whether it was like that before or I did it intentionally, but it was broken when I threw it away. Everything seemed normal for the first year of living there.  



Nothing unusual except for a patch of moss that started growing bigger without any source of moisture. I’m not a biologist but I have seen moss grow on weirder places. So it wasn’t really a problem for me. About a year in, things started to get weird. I started getting letters, addressed to different people.   Christmas cards in June, something from a life insurance company, but most just unmarked letters. Of course I never opened them. Just threw them in the bin or gave them back to the post office.  



Then birds started dying. Every time I went to work there would be a dead bird in front of my house. The weirdest thing was there was never a smell. The first couple of times, it was a mundane thing. Cleaning up. Cursing the nonexistent cat that should’ve done it and leaving for work. But then it kept happening and for some reason I started getting mad at the neighbours. I still can’t understand why I thought it was the neighbours putting bird corpses in my driveway, but for some reason it sounded like a logical conclusion at the time. My relationship with the neighbours started to get increasingly tense as I started to seclude myself in the house.  



I started to sleep on the couch as the noise from the neighbourhood became unbearable. I couldn’t understand what that noise was but it was a deep guttural voice screaming at a crying woman. I called the police a couple of times but they couldn’t find anyone with a domestic dispute in the neighbourhood.  



Things started to break. Everything was breaking apart for no reason. My car, which I treated like a princess, broke down in the middle of the road while I was coming back from work. While I walked away to call a tow truck, someone broke the window. Took the mail and my dash cam. I had to stay on the side of the road in the cold until a tow truck came. No matter what part the mechanics replaced the car wouldn’t work. I started taking the bus to work. Everything around the house was breaking. The AC started turning on and off by itself so I had to disconnect it. The lights and TV would turn off by themselves. Mirrors would break for no reason. The dishes.  


The dishes were the strangest thing. Every night I would start to hear the sound of dishes breaking. I didn’t have a dishwasher. All the dishes would just be in the cabinet. I would check over and over and every single thing was there.  



For some reason I moved back to my bedroom. I started locking the doors when I slept. I wasn’t going to work as frequently. Everything was eating into my savings, which made me fear the thought of having to move.  



That was when the sounds of it started. Something was scratching my walls as I slept. It would scratch until I opened my eyes. I could hear it slithering and scratching throughout the night. It was probably the animal that was killing the birds, I convinced myself.  



The guttural sound was closer. The voice, the screaming, the scratching, everything was just outside the walls. It wanted me to notice it. It wanted me to see it. It didn't know that I couldn’t.  



I was running out of food, I was running out of hope. Then one day, I heard a knock at the door. A genuine knock. I pushed my body to move as I opened the door. It was my neighbour. She had been trying to make Bahn mi  and wanted to share. Something in me snapped. For the first time in a while, I felt something I had been missing for months. Fear. Why wasn’t I afraid? Why was I waiting for death? I packed a single bag of luggage and moved to my sister’s house.   



I have moved to a different place now. Life is getting better. Maybe it was all a coincidence. Maybe not being able to see it was the reason that I’m alive. I’ll never know. I learned something through this, don’t believe in ghosts. Don’t look at them, but whenever you feel something’s strange, run away.
