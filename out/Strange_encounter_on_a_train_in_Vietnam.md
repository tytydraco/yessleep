I wanted to share an experience I had several years ago. On its surface, I’ll readily admit the experience can easily be summed up - and dismissed - as a brief encounter with a subjectively odd individual within an environment unfamiliar to me. The thing is, something about the seemingly pedestrian experience has stuck with me through the years. There’s just something about it I can’t seem to shake. The vividness of the memory continues to plague my thoughts, and for no discernable good reason. I thought I’d share my story in this community and I would love any feedback, no matter the vibe. It seems like it might even be therapeutic. I will warn you, though, I’ll be as descriptive as I can, but I cannot offer any particular thrills nor high drama nor tantalizing backstory, save for the sad history of where my experience took place: Vietnam.

I was there in 2017 with a friend. I had decided to take an overnight train from Hanoi north to Sapa near the border with China. Specifically, I’d booked passage aboard the Sapaly Express. To add a bit of context, I was quite excited for this portion of the trip; I have always found trains to be rather romantic. My friend, however, was… less enthused. Still, she followed me through the chaotic yet alluring streets of Hanoi, into the train station, and onto our double berth in what we hoped was the correct train. The train was not what you’d expect in western Europe or first world Asia, it was, to be sure, far more rustic and rode fairly roughshod over what I assume were ancient rails. To me, it all added to the mystique and sense of adventure. The train car consisted of private berths with a shared bathroom at one end of the car.

During the night, rendered sleepless due to far too much clickety-clacking, I got up to pee. Groggy and with legs unsteady due to the train’s sway, I slowly made my way to the back of the train. I suddenly became aware of an incredibly strange smell which seemed to engulf me so completely it felt more like an aura. My mind raced to identify a source. Train exhaust? No… I know exhaust fumes, and this was far less combustion and much more… what? Organic? Putrefaction? The thing is, it wasn’t an entirely new smell. It was an amalgamation of things I could readily identify, stale cigarettes, the dry remnants of a cognac glass left to sit until morning, a severely abscessed tooth, rotting garbage… and the unmistakable signature of rotting flesh. In other words, Death. From where the bathroom was I saw a man emerge and walk towards me, though “walking” isn’t the right term. It was a slow but steady glide the man had… like he had on those wheeled Heely shoes kids were crazy for years before and was being propelled by some invisible force. It seemed he had no intention of squeezing through or giving me any space so I ducked into a crevice and waited for him to pass. And when he did…

I wish I could tell anyone who might be reading this a better tale. Of fangs or hoofed feet or eyes like fiery rubies or bandages like the invisible man. I cannot, but I’ll describe what I *did* see… a face so pale and dry it looked like parchment or whatever a wasp nest is made of or the papery bark of a white birch. He wore a filthy loose-fitting suit with pinstriped pants and a wide-collared shirt and a soiled bowler hat. His teeth, insofar as he had any, had long since rotted away. A wispy moustache slightly upturned at the ends. He stopped, looked at me with jaundiced eyes the color of egg yolk and said, simply, “Et toi?” before gliding away. I’m a proud skeptic, vehemently unconvinced by tales of apparitions or visits from beyond, but something about that encounter made me slink away back to my cot where I took little comfort in my friend’s quiet snoring and the alien landscape rushing past the window.

In the early dawn the train arrived in Sapa and we deboarded. My friend, already not happy I had cajoled her into an experience she wasn’t keen on, seemed especially standoffish. It wasn’t until we were in a taxi enroute to our hotel that I started to recount my night to her. I barely got to the engrossing, putrid smell when my friend blurted out “OH MY GOD! THE CREEPY FRENCH GUY?!” She had gotten up at some point, too. What followed was a comparison of our interaction and served as confirmation of what I saw. “But,” I asked, “how did you know he was French? Did he speak to you too?” Her response, for some reason, is what really sent chills down my spine. And I don’t know why. But she said “No, he didn’t say a word… I just… *know* he was.” 

We talked some more and it dawned on us we never saw him again. Not when everyone deboarded the train, not when we were scrambling to get our luggage, not anywhere in the small station, not outside at the taxi line… 

I don’t know why this sticks with me. It’s really nothing more than a creepy, smelly, oddly dressed man on a train. But the memory of it all, the sound of the train, the sudden realization I really had no idea where, exactly in the world I was at the particular point in time, and that *smell*… it’s all so vivid. It bothers me. And part of the frustration is not knowing why.

It wasn't until later, while reading a book about French colonialism in Vietnam, that I saw him again. Well, characters that resembled him, anyway. An old black and white photograph, perhaps from the 1950s, of four white men, three of them in safari suits and pith helmets, one in a suit and bowler hat almost exactly like the guy the train, surrounded by three armed Asian men, and on a block of wood the severed heads of 3 young locals, their crimes unknown.
