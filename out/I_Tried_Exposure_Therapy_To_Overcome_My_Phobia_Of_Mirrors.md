I had always hated the sight of my own reflection. In fact, I hated myself and my reflection just reminded me of that fact but in visual form. My parents called it 'low self-esteem', my paediatric therapist called it 'an ongoing battle with myself and my future self.' I called it 'Hell on Earth.' Every compliment I had ever received felt like it came with a side of pity and sarcasm. Layers of foundation and blush were not able to plaster over the deep rooted loathing for my appearance.

My doctor had prescribed me Diazepam which was supposed to take the edge off the way I felt. Sure, it helped a little but this wasn't something a 10mg tablet taken twice a day could fix. Nobody could seem to understand that this wasn't just teenage hormones, social anxiety or a confidence issue. It was an illness that ate at me from the inside out like malignant cancer of the blood. Furthermore, just like a cancer patient I knew I required treatment before it was too late.

My phone alarm jolted me awake at 7AM which was my cue to hit snooze. I didn't press snooze for a few extra minutes of sleep like most people. I pressed it to have a few minutes in bed to practice self affirmation. It was something my therapist told me would make a subtle difference to my opinion on myself. Actually, it was one of the very few techniques I had learnt that did help to ground me. It was simple, quick and took little to no effort.

"Regardless of how you interpret compliments, you receive them often for your eyes and smile."

"Your friends are always there for you, no matter how much you think they hate you."

"There are bound to be at least a few people in the world that find facial acne tolerable."

That was my biggest insecurity by far. My acne. People would always tell me I had such clear skin and constantly asked me what my skincare routine was but I knew what they were really trying to imply. Whenever I heard one of these remarks, I would feel my face flush red with embarrassment and that would make my acne more apparent which would start a vicious cycle of distress which was frequently followed by a panic attack.

My alarm went off for the second time and that signalled the start of my morning. I was up showering late last night so I decided to stay engulfed in my blankets for a little longer and loaded up TikTok to ease myself into the day. My TikTok feed was filled with models, motivational feminists and self-help gurus. The first video that appeared on my feed was uploaded by one of my favourite influencers: Lisa Cramling. She was a 28 year old Swede who had been living in Thailand for the last year. She was also living proof that not all pretty blondes were dumb. Her content was usually based around self-improvement and this particular video explored a certain form of therapy. Exposure Therapy.

I was vaguely familiar with the concept so I watched on. Lisa explained that it is commonly used to treat phobias. She went on to describe the process of it and how it can be very overwhelming for the patient but the end result is usually effective and the process can be very quick in comparison to other methods. She explained that it was essentially facing your fears head on and letting the fight or flight reaction dissipate until you are relaxed in the presence of your fear. A caption popped up on the screen.

'This is not medical advice. Always consult a health professional to determine whether exposure therapy could be a suitable treatment for you.'

She stressed how important it was that this was done in a controlled environment to prevent the chance of the phobia becoming more potent. The comment section was flooded with virtual nods of approval and testimonies claiming that exposure therapy saved their lives. Despite the thousands of likers and commenters that had engaged with that video, it felt like Lisa was directly addressing me and my issues.

I closed TikTok and fled my blanket cocoon with a motivated burst of energy that felt foreign to my usually lethargic body.

I went to the bathroom to begin my morning routine. I kept a charcoal towel draped over the bathroom mirror which permitted me to wash without being disconcerted by the sight of myself. I confirmed that the shower knob was set to the coldest setting and I began undressing. I took cold showers ever since Lisa said there were countless benefits (both mentally and physically,) to bathing in cold water. I was also made aware by another Tikoker that not drying yourself instantly after showering could lead to fungal infections such as athlete's foot. For this reason, I always kept a towel on the rack besides my shower cubicle so I could dry off quickly after my wash.

I remember my first time ever taking a cold shower. I channelled all of the grit and determination I could scavenge and I stepped into the cascading, piercing water. I think I lasted about four seconds before jumping out and wrapping myself in the warm embrace of my towel. As weeks went by, I started becoming comfortable in the frigidity of my shower cubicle. I guess it was a form of exposure therapy in itself and cold showers were now nothing more than a mundane chore to me.

As the last of the water droplets hit my body, I reached my dripping hand out to reach for the towel rack to begin drying. To my surprise I didn't feel the fluffiness of cotton fibre, but rather the resistance of solid steel. My hands searched the surrounding area and I came to the realisation that after my shower last night, I had forgotten to place the towel back onto the rack. My heart sank.

As the water travelled it's way down my legs and onto my feet, I could feel the skin on my soles begin to smoulder with fungi. I scrambled out of the shower in desperate search of something that I could use to dry myself off. I pawed at the toilet roll holder expeditiously before coming to the realisation that there was barely enough tissue to dry my hands and feet, let alone my entire body. My eyes sped around the bathroom looking for a solution and came to a sudden stop at the charcoal towel.

I paused momentarily and then yanked it from the mirror, keeping my eyes sealed shut. I could see Lisa's Tiktok looping in my mind. In almost no time, I had dried myself and I stood still completely blind. I started thinking that maybe this whole ordeal was a sign that things needed to change and they needed to change now. I knew that phobias were irrational and there was no logical reason to be afraid of the mirror, but knowledge is futile in the face of fear.

I sat down on my bed and leant over to my bedside table. I clutched the white bottle sat atop it, removed two pills of Diazepam and placed them under my tongue before laying my head down for a moment. I then sat up and pulled a large post it-notes and a red marker from my bedside drawer. I thought back to Lisa's video and how she had mentioned that exposure therapy patients usually worked their way up to facing their fears. My plan was to cover the features of my reflection using numbered post-it notes and slowly peel them back revealing a new feature once I felt comfortable exposed to the previous one.

I walked over to the mirror taking caution not to view it directly and placed post-it notes all over the mirror to cover it completely. Level one of the therapy would be to look at all of the parts of the mirror that didn't show my face at all. I scrawled a one over all of the post it notes on the perimeter of the mirror. Level two would be my eyes. I repeated the same process, scribbling the number two on any parts that would be covering my reflection's eyes. Level three would be viewing her hair. Level four would be viewing her lips and I labelled all of the remaining post-it notes with the number five. Five levels of exposure therapy.

I told myself that no matter what happened, I must not turn away from the mirror as the mere thought of this phobia growing any stronger was enough to make my life completely unliveable. I knew it would be intense but I felt I was ready. I was starting to feel the effects of the Diazepam already and felt my shoulders relax and fall to my sides. I locked my bathroom door and started the process.

I began by slowly removing all of the post-it notes labelled with a one. This revealed the reflection of the walls and surfaces behind me and I felt completely fine. I wanted to make sure I did this properly so I really took the time to stare into the reflection and be conscious of the way I was feeling. I started whispering out phrases of self affirmation.

"Your reflection is beautiful."

"Your reflection is pretty."

"Your reflection is drop-dead gorgeous."

Despite the fact I was only looking at a reflection of my surroundings, I was not anxious and I was ready to move on to level two. I placed my hands over both post-it notes labelled with a two and simultaneously peeled them from the shiny surface. I saw my reflection and I was now making eye contact with her. I welcomed my eyes into hers but she did not reciprocate the act as she was staring at the ceiling. I felt a tsunami of warm blood flood from my chest to my extremities. I tensed my face and forced my eyes to close. I knew what I was seeing wasn't real. Of course my reflection was looking back at me but my fear was so strong that my mind was playing tricks on me to get me to safety.

The words of Lisa echoed in my head, "Exposure therapy can be very overwhelming however withdrawing from the treatment too early can lead to dire consequences." Suddenly, those words were interrupted by the fluttering sound of pieces of paper hitting the floor. The post-it notes had began falling. My eyelids served as protection from the monstrosity that was to be revealed in due time.

"I can do this!"

I retracted my defences and what I saw was petrifying. Her head was abnormally small in comparison to the bulbous eyes protruding from her ghastly eyelids. They were suffocating within the very sockets which they were caged. Her wired hair stood straight up, in messy spikes like the teeth of a disfigured headlice comb. Her face was the colour of gravel. The folded wrinkles and cavernous scars on her face intertwined to create a clamour of chaos and commotion. Her cracked lips were pursed together and stretched across the the breadth of her jaw which produced a psychotic smile. Her jaw was low hanging and seemed to be unhinged from one side with a clump of skin dangling from that same side. The bridge of her nose was pencil-thin and revealed her peculiar bone structure. Punctured deep into her skin were a cluster of red spots, with each individual one roasted purple at the tip. As soon as my eyes fell to the spots, her skin began to darken and the capillaries in her eyes became visible along with the network of veins buried belowthe surface of her her translucent skin. Her head suddenly began to violently vibrate and the spots on her face became geysers bursting open one by one and expulsing pus through the holes in her face.

My knees gave out under me and I stumbled into the towel rack behind me. I bent down and grabbed a razor from the cabinet and began slashing wildly at the mirror whilst holding my palm over my face to block my vision.

***Some Time Passes***

A nurse gently shook me awake.

"Hey, how are you feeling? Could you hold your hand out for me?"

She twisted the canular valve on my hand shut and sat at the foot of the bed I was laying in.

"Where am I?" I asked.

"You're in hospital." She replied gently.

"Why? How did I get here?"

"Do you really not remember?"

She turned her head to the side as if I was supposed to remember exactly what had happened.

"The police were called to your address after a neighbour down the street heard shattering glass. Due to the time of night, they told the operator they assumed it was a burglary. The police made their way into your home and heard distressing noises from the bathroom.  The door was locked so they kicked it down to find you on the floor with a razor in your hand.They say they saw blood everywhere and hair all over the floor."

I touched the top of my head and winced in pain as I noticed it had fresh cuts all over it and it was completely bare.

I felt sick at the thought of being bald and my face must have visually showed it as the nurse was soon handing me a metal bowl with one hand and rubbing on my shoulder with the other

My vision blurred and I began vomitting into the bowl. After the contents of my stomach (mostly bile) had been extracted into the bowl, she reached out to take it from me. 

"I'll just replace this and be back in a minute."

I felt exhausted. I lay my head down onto my pillow and watched the nurse leave. I looked over to the bowl grasped between her gloved fingers. I could see a faint reflection in the curvature of the bowl. My reflection was perked up in the hospital bed like a mannequin, completely still with the same psychotic smile draped across her jaw.
