**Is Something Watching Me?**

First off, I’m so sorry I disappeared for a bit. Things have been *crazy* at Pine Haven. Between flu season hitting hard and a nasty Norovirus outbreak making the rounds, we’ve been absolutely slammed. And of course, when half the staff starts calling out sick, the rest of us have to pick up the slack. Honestly, the craziness has been a bit of a blessing in disguise—it’s helped me put some of my concerns on the backburner for a while. Staying busy with the patients in front of me has kept my focus off the strange things that have been happening-or that I am just imagining.

By the end of my shift, I’ve been so exhausted I just go home, crash, and do it all over again the next day. Between being short-handed and running on caffeine and prayer, I haven’t had a minute to catch my breath—let alone sit down and open Reddit. I finally had a few minutes this morning to open Reddit, and… well, everything came rushing back. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. And there’s more to the story now.

**Just to Recap**

To catch up with anyone who is just joining. Three patients came into the ER at Pine Haven Medical Center where I work with something I’ve never seen before—strange, spiraling scratches on their arms and backs. None of them could explain how they got the injuries, and all of them described the same sharp, sulfuric, metallic smell that no one else could detect.

The scratches were symmetrical, almost deliberate in their pattern, and one patient even needed stitches to stop the bleeding. The similarity between their injuries and the smell left me disturbed, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was connecting them.

**Your Questions and Answers**

First, thanks to everyone who commented on my last post. Your thoughts and questions are definitely welcome and I will try to respond to some of them.

One that really spoke to me was from the clinical person who gave their thoughts about **the olfactory hallucinations (or the smell**) —the sulfur, “rotten egg”, and metallic smell all three patients mentioned. *Thank you so much* and you’re absolutely right that this is concerning, especially since it could mean something neurological was going on. But here’s the thing: none of the patients showed any other symptoms to suggest a neurological issue. No confusion, no headaches, no trouble with balance or vision, pupils were equal, etc. Their vitals were fine. And the fact that all three described the same smell, independent of each other, is what continues to confuse me. *Hallucinations don’t typically line up like that, do they?*

Another question that came up was about the **scratches**—how they looked and why they were even ER cases. Normally, you’re right, these would’ve been more of an urgent care situation. But here in Willow Ridge, Pine Haven is the only medical facility for miles, so we see everything. Plus, these scratches weren’t typical. Some of them were deep and they were all symmetrical and spiraled in a way that almost looked deliberate. One patient even needed a few stitches to stop the bleeding. If you haven't seen the pic I posted then you may want to check it out. That picture still gives me the creeps.

There was a question about **the patterns**—if they were consistent. The answer is yes. Whether it was on their arms or back, the spirals were all similar. I’ve honestly never seen anything like it.

Someone asked if I had heard of **David Paulides** and mentioned, “This sounds like something he’d know about.”

So, I’ll admit, I had no idea who David Paulides was before reading this. I had to Google him, and… wow. If you don’t know, he’s apparently an ex-police officer and author who’s written a lot about mysterious disappearances, especially in and around forests and National Parks. He focuses on cases where people vanish under strange circumstances, often with no logical explanation.

I’ll be honest—with as little as I know about him I’m not sure how much of his work is fact versus speculation, but reading about it definitely got my attention. A lot of his stories involve people being found in places they shouldn’t be, or strange patterns like clusters of disappearances near certain locations. And the thing that resonated with me is how often the woods come up in his research.

The more I read, the more I couldn’t help wondering if whatever’s happening here in Willow Ridge might be connected to something bigger. I mean, I’m not saying people are disappearing or anything, but… the woods have always had this weird reputation. It’s kind of an unspoken rule to stay out of the woods after dark, but thinking about it I don’t think I have ever really heard why.

I haven’t reached out to him or anything—I wouldn’t even know where to start—but the idea that someone might have studied things like this before makes me feel a little better about where my mind is going. If anyone has more info on his work or thinks it’s worth digging deeper, let me know. I’m open to anything right now.

**A Fourth Patient**

We had another patient come in last night. Let’s call her Lisa. She’s in her early 20s, healthy, no medical history worth noting. She showed up complaining of severe abdominal pain. At first, we thought it might be appendicitis, but the more we talked, the stranger her story got.

She said she’d been out jogging near the woods that evening when she started to feel anxious. She doesn't have a history of anxiety attacks so that was ruled out pretty quickly. In describing the feeling she did not describe the typical feeling you would experience when you’re alone—it was deeper than that, like someone was standing right behind her. She insisted that when she looked around the area, no one was there. And that’s when her pain started.

When the doctor examined her, he couldn’t find anything to explain it—her appendix was fine, no signs of infection or trauma. But then, we rolled her over to check her back and I saw them.

Three faint scratches, spiraling across her lower back. They weren’t deep like the others—more like fresh bruises or shallow burns—but the pattern was definitely the same. Perfect. Precise. When I asked her about them, she swore they weren’t there before her run and she had no idea how they got there.

And, of course, she described "the smell". Sulfuric, "rotten eggs", metallic, just like the others. She said it hit her near the woods and didn’t go away, even after she left. After seeing those spirals I had to go to the break room for a few minutes just to get my composure back. What is going on here?

**The Parking Lot**

After my shift, I was exhausted. All I wanted was to get home, take a long shower, and sleep for a week. I wasn’t even thinking clearly as I walked to my car, just mindlessly going through the motions.

That’s when I noticed someone standing near the edge of the parking lot, just beyond the lights, close to the tree line. At first, I didn’t think much of it. Patients sometimes hang around outside waiting for rides or smoking, and with everything on my mind, I didn’t have the energy to overthink it. But the longer I looked, the more something felt… off.

They were too still—unnaturally still. Their head looked like it was tilted to the side, like they were watching me. It’s hard to explain exactly what made it so unsettling, but the way they stood didn’t look right or normal, like they weren’t just standing there—they were waiting.

With everything that’s been going on lately, my fight-or-flight kicked in hard. And full disclosure - flight is my usual go-to outside the ER. I told myself to just get the he\*\* in the car and leave. But I didn’t move. I froze in place. My legs felt like they were rooted to the pavement, and I just stood there, staring.

Then they raised their hand—slowly—and pointed at me. It wasn’t a wave. It wasn’t a beckon. It was just a single, deliberate point. My stomach turned, and all I could think was "run". But my body wasn’t cooperating, and before I could figure out what I was seeing, I heard it—a voice. It wasn’t loud, but it was clear, like someone standing right behind me. They said my name! I spun around and nearly tripped, but there was no one there. Nothing. Just the empty parking lot stretching behind me. When I turned back, the figure near the tree line was gone.

My first instinct was to run straight to my car, lock the doors, and get out of there. But something stopped me. Maybe it was the adrenaline or my nursing instincts finally kicking in, but instead of leaving, I turned and went back into the ER to find the night security guard. I told him what I’d seen—the figure, the pointing, the voice—and asked him to check the lot with me. He looked skeptical (and honestly, I can’t blame him), but he grabbed a flashlight and walked the perimeter while I waited by the door. Of course, he didn’t find anything. No person, no sign that anyone had been there at all. He came back and told me I must’ve imagined it, that I was probably overtired and stressed from work. Then he gave me a stern warning: “Don’t walk out there alone at night anymore.” I nodded, but his words didn’t make me feel any better. If anything, they made it worse. I’ve worked at Pine Haven for years, and no one’s ever felt the need to tell me something like that before.

When I finally made it to my car, I locked the doors the second I got inside and sat there for a minute, trying to convince myself it was nothing. But it didn’t feel like nothing. It felt like something—and that something was still out there.

**The Porch**

When I got home and was fumbling for my keys to unlock the front door I saw “it". This thing—sitting on my doorstep. It was a small wreath, twisted together from twigs and dried vines, with a single black feather right in the center.

When I saw it, my hands started to tremble. I could feel my pulse pounding and I had to remind myself to breathe. In other words, I freaked out. I stood there for what felt like forever trying to decide what to do.  I wanted to turn around, get back in my car, and leave, but where would I go? I just stood there, staring at it. Eventually, I calmed down and I've managed to take a picture, because honestly, who would believe me if I didn’t? I wouldn’t believe me! *I will try to remember to include the picture at the end of my post.*

I didn’t want to touch it—there was no way I was touching it. Just looking at it made my skin crawl. I thought about kicking it off the porch, just to get it away from me, from my home, but I couldn’t bring myself to do that either. What if it… I don’t know, what if that made it worse somehow?

In the end, I just left it there. I stepped around it and went inside, locking the door behind me like it was going to help. I told myself I’d deal with it later, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Every time I tried to close my eyes, I could picture that thing sitting there. It's still there this morning.

I honestly don’t know what to think at this point. The scratches, the smell, the patients, the woods, the parking lot, this little wreath-looking thing… it all feels connected. But saying that out loud? It makes me feel ridiculous. Things like this don’t happen in real life. They’re the kind of stories you hear around a campfire or watch in horror movies. It's not something that happens to a nurse in a small town.

I don’t want to sound crazy. I’ve spent my nursing career dealing with facts, logic, and processes so none of this makes any sense. I can’t shake the feeling that whatever it is, it’s not just happening around me anymore—it’s happening to me. Maybe I’m just overly tired. Maybe I’m coming down with the flu myself and having some odd symptoms because I am so stressed.

Please, has anyone experienced anything like this or seen anything like this wreath? I’m starting to feel a little desperate here. What would you do? I really need some answers so I can start making sense of this, but I’m terrified that the truth is going to be worse than anything I might imagine. I’ll check back as soon as I can to see if anyone has any thoughts or ideas. Right now, I just feel like I’m way over my head, and I could really use some answers—or at least a little reassurance that I’m not losing it.
