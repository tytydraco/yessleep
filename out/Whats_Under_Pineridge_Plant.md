It's Sam. Sorry it's been a while.

It’s easier to just recount what happened than try to explain it in my own words. I’ve been stewing on it for a couple days, trying to process what I saw before putting it down here. I still don’t know if I’m ready, but if what I saw was real, I have to.

After slipping into the plant using one of the old maintenance hatches, I managed to circumvent the locked doors via the vent system. It was tight, awkward, and I had to crawl for what felt like forever, but eventually I dropped down into the hallway behind the doors. 

The lights were harsh white, clinical, humming with a low, persistent vibration. The kind of fluorescent glow that makes everything seem sterile, almost unreal. The place was completely empty—no humans, no footsteps, just the pulse of the water moving somewhere deep inside the plant. You could feel it under your skin, like the building itself was alive. The regular hallways in the plant were similar, but this one was almost sterile rather than just clean.

The hallway sloped gently down for what felt like a long stretch. At the end, I saw a set of massive wooden doors, something I wouldn't expect to see in a modern water treatment plant—more like the entrance to an old castle. The pulsing I had felt earlier grew louder, more resonant, like the heartbeat of something enormous hidden just beyond. I paused, listening. Every instinct screamed at me to turn back. I didn’t. I couldn’t.

I eased the doors open just enough to slip inside. The chamber beyond wasn’t industrial—it was antiquated: high vaulted ceilings arching over polished stone floors. Light reflected off shallow pools carved into the stone, water dripping from overhead channels. The entire space was silent except for the constant pulse, vibrating through the floor, through my chest, through the air itself.

It felt like some vague imitation of a cathedral, or some place of worship.

As my eyes adjusted, I noticed subtle signs that people had been here. Symbols etched into the floors: spirals, eyes, strange patterns that almost looked like human heads with a spiral embedded in the forehead. Kneeling mats had left faint impressions on the stone, water-stains shaped like hands pressed in devotion. 

Whoever had been coming here wasn’t casual—they had been paying homage, worshipping something for a long time. Even the raised platform at the far end was carved with subtle markings, making the space feel like a twisted altar—a shrine built around something alive.

And there she was. I almost can’t put this into words. She’s enormous, her body a series of bulbous, translucent segments, like some nightmarish grub or… I don’t even know. Tendrils, not mandibles, waved gently in the air, sensing me, testing me, I think. At the center of her, a massive sac pulsated with a fluid that shimmered faintly. The notes from Marlowe flashed through my mind—the egg-laden fluid, fed directly into the water system. Connected to her sac, cables and pipes ran like veins into the plant itself, feeding, distributing, contaminating.

I wanted to look away. I wanted to scream. But I couldn’t. She was the source. Everything I’d seen, everything I’d warned people about, came from her. She was the reason the town was sick, the reason the boiling didn’t work, the reason the Board had been so careful to dismiss any concerns.

I lingered too long, staring at the sheer scale of it, the unnaturalness of it, and the faint, ritualistic markings scattered through the chamber. The air smelled damp, slightly metallic, and the pulse of the water seemed almost alive in my chest. I felt… seen. Then the full weight of what I was up against crashed down: this isn’t just contamination. This is something older, something alive, and humans—people in power—have been complicit in propagating it.

I stumbled back, slipping through the doors and retracing my path. My heart hasn’t stopped racing. I can still feel the pulse in my veins. I’ve been replaying it over and over since I got home. I don’t know if the Board knows, or if the investigators could comprehend it even if I told them. And I don’t know if anything I post can truly convey what it’s like to stand in the presence of that… thing.

I needed to write it down before I did something foolish. To whoever reads this: the eggs aren’t natural. The water isn’t safe. And what’s controlling this… what’s feeding this… has been hidden in plain sight for longer than I can guess.

I’ll need time to process everything, and I’ll try to post again once I can make sense of it. Avoid the water. Don’t drink it. Don’t even touch it if you can help it.
