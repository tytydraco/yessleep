I'm writing this from my car because I need to get it down before I talk myself out of what I just saw. My hands are shaking, and the rain hasn't stopped.

My headlights burned out three days ago—the regular ones, not the high beams—and I kept meaning to replace them but work has been brutal and I just kept putting it off. So tonight, driving home on County Road 12, I'm running on high beams alone, and the rain is coming down in sheets, and I can barely see fifteen feet ahead of me.

That's when the fog bank appears.

It's dense. Unnaturally dense. I'm slowing down, my foot pressing lightly on the brake, and through the wall of white I see a shape. Small, low to the ground. A child, I think. Or a dog. Something living and solid and directly in my path.

I slam on the brakes, brace for impact, close my eyes…

Then nothing.

When I open them, I'm through the fog and there's only an empty road ahead, rain-slicked and black. My heart is hammering. I check the rearview mirror but the fog is already dissipating behind me, wisping away into nothing.

Just fog. Dense fog. I was seeing things.

I keep driving home.

I pass the Patchetts’ farmhouse about two miles later. I've driven past it a thousand times. Their white house and red barn, that ancient oak in the front yard. Except tonight, as my high beams sweep across the property, I see Mrs. Patchett standing in her kitchen window.

She's washing dishes.

That's not strange; I know my neighbors well enough to know their daily routine. What's strange is the *way* she's doing it. Her hands move in precise circles, over and over, the same motion, but there's something mechanical about it. Performative, like she's playing the role of someone washing dishes rather than actually cleaning them.

And her face. I only see it for a second as I pass, but her face is pointed straight at the window, and her expression is completely blank. Not tired, not thoughtful. Blank. Empty.

I tell myself I'm seeing things again. The adrenaline from almost hitting something is making me paranoid. Mrs. Patchett is just tired. It's late. People zone out all the time when they do dishes.

I keep driving.

Another fog bank appears about a mile later, thicker this time. I slow to a crawl.

This time, I see other cars. Three of them, heading the opposite direction. Their headlights cut through the fog like searchlights, and for just a moment—just a flash—I see the drivers and my face contorts into something ugly.

They're not driving. They're consuming.

I don't know how else to describe it. Their mouths are slightly open, their eyes fixed forward, and they're no longer just people commuting home from work or running errands. They're feeding. The motion itself—the act of going, taking space, moving forward—they're devouring it. Like the distance is something they need to swallow just to keep existing.

One of them is a woman in a sedan. As we pass each other, she turns her head slightly and our eyes meet through the fog and rain.

There's nothing behind her eyes. Nothing at all. Just the desperate, automatic performance of being a person driving a car.

Then I'm through the fog again, and my hands are gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles are white.

I pull over. I need to pull over.

I'm at a turnout overlooking Miller's Pond. I put the car in park and I'm breathing too fast. This is shock. This is my brain misfiring because I almost hit something and my nerves are shot and I haven't been sleeping well and—

I look down at my phone and keep typing because I need to write it down. I need someone to see this before I convince myself none of it happened.

Okay, I'm calmer now. I've been sitting here for maybe ten minutes, gulping air to fill my lungs then slowly exhaling to calm my nerves. The rain is lighter, my breathing has slowed, and my heart isn’t fluttering like a trapped animal behind my ribs anymore.

I can see the lights of town from here, scattered across the valley like dropped coins. People in their homes, living their lives. Their very normal lives.

I'm going to finish driving home. It's only another three miles up the road. Maybe someone can tell me I'm having a panic attack or that there's some kind of gas leak making me hallucinate. Something rational.

There's a 24-hour gas station at the edge of town. I wasn't planning to stop, but my tank is nearly empty and I don't want to deal with it tomorrow morning.

I pull in. The fluorescent lights are too bright after driving in the dark, and they make everything look washed out and artificial. There's only one other car here—a blue pickup truck at pump three.

I get out. The rain has stopped but the air is heavy with moisture, and I can see my breath.

The man at pump three is filling his tank. I recognize him. David something—he works at the hardware store. I've bought paint and light bulbs from him, the kind of routine interactions you have in a small town where you're not quite friends but you know each other's faces.

He sees me and nods. I nod back.

I start pumping gas, and then the fog rolls in.

It comes from nowhere, thick and low, its tendrils pooling around the pumps like something alive. David is still standing there, watching his pump, and I'm watching him, and the fog is rising.

His hand is on the pump handle, but he's not looking at the numbers. He's looking at nothing. And I can see it now—really see it—the way I couldn't before.

He's hollow.

Not metaphorically. I can see the shape of him, the outline of a man in a jacket holding a pump, but there's nothing inside. No thoughts, no feelings, no…self. Just the performance itself. The learned behavior of being David-at-the-gas-station, executing the script: pump gas, check numbers, replace nozzle, get receipt, drive away.

And underneath it all, underneath the performance, there's just this desperate, gnawing need to do something, to keep moving because stopping means facing the emptiness.

He's feeding on the act of completing tasks, on the illusion that any of it—any of *this*—means anything at all.

The fog thickens and I see myself in the reflection of my car window.

Oh god.

Oh god, I'm doing it too.

I'm standing here pumping gas at night because that's what people do. That's what I'm supposed to do. And I'm going to drive home and I'm going to walk inside and I'm going to make coffee or check my email or watch something on my phone, and every single action is just me trying to fill the void. Trying to convince myself I'm not hollow.

But I am.

We all are.

David-something gets in his truck and drives away as the fog is starting to clear.

My pump clicks off. I replace the nozzle. I get my receipt.

I perform the script.

I drive another seven minutes down the street, and I'm home now.

I've been sitting in my driveway for twenty minutes, staring at my front door.

Inside is my life. My furniture, my routines, my carefully constructed existence. The person I pretend to be when I wake up and make coffee and go to work and come home and do it all again.

But I can't unsee it now.

Every choice I make, every word I speak, every interaction with another person—it's all just a performance, an elaborate shared delusion that we're real, that we matter, that any of this means something.

And the worst part? The absolutely worst part?

I'm going to keep doing it.

I'm going to walk inside. I'm going to take off my coat. I'm going to brush my teeth and go to bed and wake up tomorrow and do it all again. Because what else is there?

So I'll keep performing. Keep consuming. Keep feeding the emptiness.

Just like everyone else.

I'm posting this now because maybe that's all we can do—reach out across the void, hoping someone else sees it too, hoping that sharing the horror makes it more bearable.

But I know better now.

This post is just another performance. Another way to fill the emptiness. I'm using your attention, your validation, your responses to convince myself I exist.

We're all doing it. Every post, every comment, every interaction—we're all just hollow things trying to feel solid for a moment.

The fog didn't change anything, not really.

I need to go inside now. I need to keep performing. Because the alternative is admitting there's nothing to perform for.
