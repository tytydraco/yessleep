A few weeks ago, I found out by accident that my phone sometimes saves short audio clips when it thinks I’m talking to it. The files are only a few seconds long and buried deep in the settings.

At first, they were harmless. Once, I mumbled in my sleep: “Where’s my charger?” Another time it was just a cough. I laughed and figured it was just normal sleep talking.

Then, one Thursday, there was another file. 3:12 a.m.
I hit play and heard my own voice say:
“Is he awake?”

A short pause.

Then a second voice: “No. Not yet.”

I live alone.

My voice sounded slower, flatter. The other was deeper, rougher. I couldn’t place it.

The next evening, I met up with two people I sometimes grab drinks with. We sat in a small bar, talking about work and stress. At some point, I mentioned the recording, like it was just a weird story. One of them immediately said I probably just talk to myself in my sleep. The other said maybe I could hear my neighbors through the walls. They both laughed. I laughed too, but inside, I had the feeling they didn’t really believe me.

Night 2: Friday, 2:47 a.m. – next recording:
“Soon.”
My voice. I was sure of it. No memory of saying it.

On Saturday, I stayed out most of the day to clear my head. Shopping, coffee in the park. I tried convincing myself everything was normal. That night, I put my phone in the living room, turned on airplane mode.

Night 3: Sunday morning, there was still a new file. 4:03 a.m.
Slow footsteps. Then my whisper: “He’s listening.”
Then absolute silence.

At work, I noticed my concentration slipping. I work in a small warehouse. Usually, it’s all routine, but I kept zoning out. A coworker asked if I was getting sick. I shook my head.

Night 4: Monday, 3:55 a.m. – two voices, both sounding like me:
“When?”
“Tonight.”
Then a dull thud, like someone had moved the phone.

On Tuesday, I started checking for changes in my apartment. I found a glass on the wrong side of the table, a sweater draped over a chair that I’d left in the closet, my screwdriver lying in the middle of the hallway. I stood there staring at it for minutes, as if it might explain itself.

Night 5: Tuesday – recording:
“He’s almost ready.”
“Soon he’ll remember.”

Wednesday morning, I had a thin scratch on my forearm. Not deep, but fresh. I had no idea how it got there. That evening, I went out to grab groceries and caught myself scanning people on the street, like I was checking if they recognized me.

Night 6: Thursday – no greeting, no whisper. Just one sentence:
“We know what you did.”
Pause.
“You’ll play your part.”

By Friday, I felt numb. I only realized at lunch that I hadn’t eaten the breakfast I’d brought. While working, I noticed a small dried stain on my pants – dark brown. I rubbed at it, but it didn’t fully come out.

Night 7: Friday –
“Tonight you’ll finish it.”
“You know what to do.”
Then a long, soft sound, like something heavy being dragged across the floor.

On Saturday, someone I used to hang out with called. We talked briefly before he said I should come out again sometime. I told him I was busy. After hanging up, I realized I’d lied  I had nothing to do.

Night 8: Saturday –
The recording started with no background noise.
One voice: “It’s time.”
My voice, quiet: “I know.”
A short pause.
“You’re ready now.”
Then a single, slow step and the recording ended.

That Saturday night, I sat on the couch for hours, staring at the dark TV screen until my own reflection barely looked like me anymore. Then I picked up my phone and slammed it on the floor until the screen shattered. Pulled the battery, put everything in a bag, straight into the trash. I thought it was over.

Last night, I woke up. No idea what time. No phone. No clock. Just that musty smell of damp concrete and metal.

I was standing. Barefoot. The floor cold under my feet.
In front of me was a workbench. On it, my box cutter, my hammer, zip ties – all lined up neatly. It was definitely my tools.

The air was thick and heavy. Somewhere, water was dripping. A lamp on the ceiling flickered, throwing restless shadows against the walls.

And then I noticed:
My right hand was wet. Not completely just the handle of the knife.

I don’t know how I got out of there.
Or if I even want to know.
