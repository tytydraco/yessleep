They say the Devil doesn’t live in hell. He lives in the quiet places—between heartbeats, between breaths, behind the parts of your eyes you can’t quite focus on.

I never believed that, until I saw the ones that moved when I blinked.

It started with the old folks at Granger House. I work nights there, a CNA in the memory ward. Ten beds, all of them with failing minds and paper-thin skin. I wasn’t squeamish. I’d seen it all—vomit, broken hips, even a man who tried to eat his own wristband. But I wasn’t ready for Room 9.

Not for Mr. Pell.

He was new. Ninety-one. Silent. Blind in both eyes from untreated glaucoma. Never spoke, never moved, just stared at the ceiling with a look like something terrible was painted up there only he could see.

First night on his floor, I was changing his linens when I heard him whisper.

“They’re in the corners,” he rasped. “They come out when the lights buzz.”

I paused. “Mr. Pell?”

His dead eyes flicked toward me. “Don’t blink.”

I laughed it off. Late nights, fluorescent lights, the weird atmosphere of a place that smells like talcum powder and urine—it gets in your head. But then he gripped my wrist.

Cold, fragile, but tight.

“They want skin,” he said. “The wet kind.”

He died that night. No known cause. No struggle. Just gone, mouth open like he was still trying to warn us.

That’s when the power flickers began.

Only at night. The lights would hum—this high, warbling buzz—and then the fluorescent tubes would dim just slightly. Shadows stretched longer than they should. And every time it happened, I’d feel it:

A presence in the corners.

Not movement—anticipation. Like something waiting, crouched low behind the filing cabinets or beneath the wheelchairs in the rec room. I could never see it. But I’d catch it in the corner of my eye… a shape like a spider too tall for its own legs. Always still.

Until I blinked.

That first time I caught it move, just a flicker.
I thought it was my mind. But it had moved closer. It was in the hallway. I blinked again.

It was at the door.

Then the lights came fully back and it was gone.

I stopped sleeping. Brought eye drops. Did anything to keep my eyes open during the night shift. Because others were starting to see it too.

Nurse Marla claimed she found Mrs. Eddings—sweetest 80-year-old you’d ever meet—dead in the bathroom with her jaw unhinged and something like sucker marks all down her neck. Dr. Mallick insisted it was a stroke, but I saw her chart. No bleeding. No burst vessels.

Just a body emptied too cleanly.

Marla was next.

We found her slumped in the supply closet, eyes wide open, both missing. Not gouged. Not cut. Just… gone, like something had sucked them right out and sealed the sockets smooth.

That night, I stayed in the nurse’s station. Duct-taped my eyelids open.

But when the lights buzzed, I could hear it. A skittering like wet claws on linoleum. A whispering—not in words, but intent—in the folds of my brain.

“You blinked.”

I hadn’t. I swore I hadn’t.

But my eyes burned, and in one half-second twitch, I saw it fully.

It stood on reverse-bent limbs, long like stilts but soaked, skinless and glistening. Its face was a vertical slit, peeled open like a blooming flower, inside a thousand grinding teeth. Arms ended in hands with eyes, all of them blinking, twitching, staring at me.

It didn’t move.

Until I did.

I’m writing this with one eye taped open. I’ve removed the other. They can’t take it if it’s already gone.

They feed on that moment of blindness—the blink. That fraction of a second where you don’t see, where your mind resets, where reality skips.

That’s when they get closer.

You’ve seen them too.

That feeling that someone’s in the room just as you open your eyes. That instinct to snap your head around at a shadow that isn’t there anymore. That blur of movement you catch when you’re too tired to focus…

That’s them.

And they’re so much closer now.

So if you value your life…

Don’t blink!
