The forecast said “snow showers.” That is the exact phrase that got me to throw my pack in the trunk like I was beating the clock on some fun little weekend reset.

Snow showers.

By the time I reached the pull-off, the world was already turning white in that slow, steady way that makes you feel like you’re inside a shaken snow globe. It wasn’t blizzard conditions yet. Just thick flakes and wind that kept changing its mind. The kind of weather where you can still hear your own boots in the powder and convince yourself you’re fine.

I signed the trail register with a pen that didn’t want to work. My glove made my handwriting look like a toddler’s. There was one other name above mine, from earlier that morning. No notes. No “back by sunset.” Just a name and a time that felt too early to still matter.

The first half-mile in, I started second-guessing myself. Not because I was scared. Because every tree looked the same, and snow eats landmarks. Trail blazes disappear when they get frosting on them. Tracks turn into soft dents and then nothing. Your world shrinks to whatever your headlamp hits, and mine wasn’t even on yet.

I kept going anyway, because that’s how I am. If I’ve committed to something, I’ll drag it behind me like a bad decision on a leash.

I picked a spot the way I always do. Not too close to water. Not in a low pocket where cold air settles. Not under dead branches. A little rise off the trail with a couple of thick trunks to break the wind. Nothing dramatic. Just a place that looked like it would still be there when I woke up.

Setting up in snow is never graceful. I stamped out a rectangle with my boots until the powder packed down. Dug out a shallow trench for my vestibule so I wouldn’t be crawling into a drift. Anchored my guylines with buried sticks because the ground was too frozen for stakes. My fingers went numb halfway through and I told myself it was fine, because I had a sleeping bag rated way colder than this and a stove and those little hand warmers that smell like pennies when they heat up.

It should’ve been simple.

It should’ve just been cold.

While I worked, the woods kept doing that thing where it goes quiet in patches. Not the normal “snow muffles sound” quiet. I mean the kind where you realize you haven’t heard a bird in a while. No squirrel chatter. No little taps from branches. Just wind, and the soft hiss of snow landing on nylon.

The first time I noticed it, I actually stopped and listened, like I expected someone to clear their throat behind a tree.

Nothing.

I finished pitching the tent and went to fetch more deadfall for a small fire. Not to be dramatic. Just because fire makes the dark feel less personal.

That’s when I saw the tracks.

They weren’t mine. Mine were wide, boot-shaped, predictable. These were longer, like someone had taken a shovel and dragged it toe-first. A single line of impressions, deep enough to show wet under the powder. Each one spaced too far apart to be walking normally.

I followed them without thinking. Ten steps. Twenty.

They went in a straight line between two stands of pine… and then they stopped at a scoured patch where the wind had polished the snow down to hardpack near exposed stone. No clean turn. No tidy return trail. Just the last drag mark fading into a surface that didn’t hold detail the way fresh powder does.

I stood there with my gloved hand still gripping a dead branch, staring at the last mark until the storm started filling everything in. The wind picked up and a spray of powder hit my face.

That’s when I heard something behind me.

Not footsteps. More like a slow drag.

Like someone pulling a heavy bag over crusted snow.

I whipped around fast enough to almost lose my balance.

All I saw was the thinning light between trees, and my own breath, and the start of my boot trail back to camp.

The dragging sound stopped the second I turned.

I did the thing you’re not supposed to do. I called out.

“Hello?”

My voice sounded wrong. Like it didn’t belong in the woods.

No answer. Of course no answer.

I told myself it was a branch. A deer. The wind moving a downed log. Anything that fit into the normal world.

Then I noticed something I hadn’t noticed the first time.

Those long tracks weren’t centered the way a person’s would be. They weren’t two parallel lines like skis, either. They were slightly off, like whatever made them had one side of its body heavier than the other.

Like it leaned.

I carried the branch back to camp and tried to shake it off. I got my fire going with a little stove fuel and stubbornness. The flame fought the wind but didn’t quit. It popped and snapped like it was annoyed.

I ate a sad dinner standing up. Instant noodles in a metal cup, because sitting on snow makes your body remember exactly what heat is worth. I kept turning my head to check the trees, not because I saw anything, but because my brain kept insisting I should.

The storm thickened in layers. It wasn’t just snow now. It was snow with teeth. Gusts that shoved it sideways. Flakes stinging my cheeks. Visibility dropping until the firelight felt like a little island and everything outside it was just a wall.

I crawled into the tent early. Not because I was tired. Because being outside started to feel like being watched through frosted glass.

Inside, everything was close and loud. Nylon breathing. Zippers clicking. My sleeping pad squeaking every time I shifted. I stripped off wet layers and stuffed them into a bag so they wouldn’t freeze into boards. I checked my phone. No service, obviously. The battery already draining faster than it should in the cold.

I lay there with my headlamp off, listening.

Wind. Snow. Tent fabric snapping.

Then, very faint, the drag again.

Not outside the tent.

Further out. Somewhere between the tree line and the trail.

Drag. Pause. Drag.

I held my breath like that mattered.

The dragging got closer. Slow. Patient.

I sat up and turned my headlamp on. The beam turned the inside of my tent into a bright little fish tank. I stared at the nylon, like I could see through it if I stared hard enough.

Drag.

Pause.

Then something touched the outside of the tent.

Not a gust. Not snow sliding. A pressure, deliberate, like a palm placed flat against it.

The fabric bowed inward and held.

I didn’t move. I don’t mean I stayed calm. I mean my body went rigid in a way that felt automatic.

The pressure slid, just a little, like whatever was out there was feeling along the seam.

It stopped near the zipper.

I grabbed my knife. I always carry a small fixed blade for camp stuff. Cutting cord. Shaving kindling. It looked stupid in my hand suddenly. Like bringing a pocketknife to an argument with the weather.

The fabric at the zipper pulled.

Not the zipper itself. The fabric around it, like fingers trying to find purchase.

I didn’t think. I lunged forward and shoved both hands against the door, pushing back from the inside, trying to keep whatever it was from getting leverage.

For a second, there was resistance. Real resistance. Something solid.

Then the pressure vanished.

The tent snapped back into place.

Silence.

I sat there in that awful bright circle of headlamp light, sweating in my base layer, waiting for something else to happen.

Nothing happened.

That was worse.

After a few minutes, I forced myself to breathe normally. I clicked the headlamp to red mode and unzipped the door just enough to look out.

Snow blasted in immediately, cold and sharp. I squinted into it. The beam of my light got swallowed fast, just a short cone before it dissolved into white.

I couldn’t see anything.

But I could see the marks.

There were fresh impressions right outside my vestibule, partially filling with snow. Not boot prints. Not animal tracks. Those long, leaning drags, ending inches from my door.

And mixed in with them, very faint, were thinner lines, like something with nails or claws had raked the snow as it moved.

The prints didn’t lead away.

They circled my tent.

Not a clean circle. More like it had paced around, stopping, starting, doubling back, then pressing close again.

I zipped the tent shut so hard the teeth snagged.

And that’s when I heard it.

A sound that made my stomach drop because it was trying, badly, to be familiar.

It was a voice.

Not a word. Not a sentence. Just a low, throaty attempt at the shape of a human sound. The way a parrot can mimic a laugh without understanding it.

It came from somewhere beyond the trees, past the edge of my light.

It went, “Hey…”

Soft. Almost polite.

Then silence.

Then, closer: “Heeey…”

The second one had more breath in it. More confidence.

I pressed my mouth into my sleeve to keep my own breathing quiet, like a kid hiding under covers.

“Hey,” it tried again, right outside the tent now.

So close I felt it more than heard it, like the nylon was carrying the vibration.

The voice was wrong in a way I can’t explain without sounding dramatic. It wasn’t scary because it was loud. It was scary because it wasn’t quite right. Like something had listened to people speak from far away and decided it could do it too.

My headlamp beam shook as my hand shook.

The tent wall bulged inward again.

This time it didn’t feel like a palm.

This time it felt like a face pressed into it.

I saw the shape of it in the nylon, an oval with ridges, like bone or cartilage. The fabric stretched across it and held, showing the suggestion of where eyes would be, where a mouth would be.

The mouth moved.

“Cold,” it said.

Then, with a little laugh that sounded like someone choking: “You cold.”

I don’t know why that broke me, but it did.

I kicked at the wall where its head was pressed, hard enough to make my heel sting. The shape snapped back. The nylon popped outward.

Outside, something made a noise like wet fabric being pulled apart.

Then the dragging started again. Faster. Circling.

Drag drag drag drag drag.

The whole tent shivered with each pass, like it was brushing against it, bumping it, testing it.

I grabbed my car keys. Not because I was going to drive. Because the alarm button felt like the only weapon I had that wasn’t a joke.

I crawled into my boots, hands shaking so bad I missed the laces twice. I stuffed my sleeping bag into its sack without rolling it, just crammed it down. Threw what I could into my pack half-zipped.

I had one thought, clear and bright in my head: get to the car.

The storm was thick enough that I couldn’t see the trail from my tent. I had to follow my own boot line by feel, like reading braille with my feet.

I unzipped the tent and bolted out.

The cold hit me so hard it made my eyes water instantly. Snow slapped my face. Wind shoved my pack like it wanted me on the ground.

I took three steps and almost fell because the snow had drifted into my boot prints.

Behind me, something moved.

Not dragging now.

Running.

It hit the side of my tent with a heavy thump, like it had launched itself at it the second I left, and the whole structure collapsed in on itself. Poles flexed, snapped back, then folded. My little island of shelter crumpled like a kicked soda can.

That gave me a horrible, vivid image of it being angry that I was leaving.

I ran.

My headlamp beam bounced wildly, making the woods strobe. Trees appeared and vanished. My own breath sounded like an engine failing.

Then something grabbed my pack.

It yanked me backward so hard my spine jolted. I went down on one knee, pack straps biting into my shoulders.

My first thought was that a branch had hooked it.

Then the pack moved sideways, smooth and strong, and I realized whatever had it was pulling.

I twisted around and my light hit it for half a second.

It was low to the ground, but long. Too long. Its body was pale in a way that didn’t look like fur or skin. More like packed snow pressed into the shape of something alive. It had limbs, but they didn’t bend right. They hinged too many times. And its head…

Its head looked like it was wearing a face that didn’t fit it.

Like it had pressed a mask of frozen skin onto bone.

The mouth opened and I saw dark inside, wet and wrong.

It didn’t roar. It didn’t snarl.

It went, softly, like it was still practicing: “Hey.”

Then it jerked again, trying to pull me off the trail.

I did the only thing that made sense. I let my pack go.

The straps slipped off my shoulders and the thing went with it, tugging it into the white like it weighed nothing.

I scrambled up and sprinted.

Behind me, the dragging returned for a second as it adjusted, then it came after me with a new sound, a rapid tapping, like nails on crusted snow.

I could hear it gaining.

My foot punched through a thin crust and I went down hard, my shin smacking something buried beneath. Rock or root, I still don’t know. Pain flashed hot and then went oddly dull.

I tried to get up and my leg didn’t want to cooperate.

I forced it anyway, half running, half limping, tears freezing at the corners of my eyes. My headlamp beam caught the trail register sign ahead like a miracle. A reflective rectangle in the storm.

The pull-off was close.

I hit the edge of the lot and saw my car as a dark shape under white.

I fumbled my keys so badly I dropped them. Had to find them by feel in the snow, fingers clawing, panic making everything clumsy. I got them, jammed the key into the door, yanked it open, nearly fell into the seat.

The tapping sound was right behind me now.

I slammed the door.

The car rocked.

Something hit the side hard enough to make the whole frame creak.

I locked the doors out of instinct, like a lock meant anything against whatever that was.

The windshield was already frosting. Snow plastered against it. I turned the key and the engine coughed once.

Then nothing.

The battery, cold-soaked. The car had decided to join the storm in being useless.

Another impact. This time on the hood.

I looked up through the windshield and saw a shape on the glass, inches away, sliding down slowly.

Not a face. Not fully.

Just a pale oval pressing against the windshield from the outside, leaving a smeared patch where frost melted under it.

The mouth moved, muffled through glass.

“You cold,” it said.

Then it made that choking laugh again.

My hands were shaking so hard I could barely press the panic button, but I did. The car erupted into noise. Horn blaring. Lights flashing. A ridiculous, desperate alarm in the middle of nowhere.

The shape flinched.

It peeled off the hood and dropped into the snow with that wrong, jointed motion. The head turned toward the sound like it didn’t understand it, like it was hearing a new kind of animal.

It took a step back. Then another.

I hit the ignition again and again, begging the engine like it was a person.

On the fourth try, it caught.

The heater fan whined weakly. The headlights cut through the snow in two pale tunnels.

I threw the car into reverse without thinking about traction and the tires spun, then grabbed, then slid. I fishtailed, corrected, and backed onto the road like I was fleeing a burning building.

In my rearview mirror, through the chaos of white, I saw it standing at the edge of the lot.

Not chasing now.

Just watching.

It lifted one arm slowly, like someone waving goodbye.

Then it raised its hand to its mouth, pressed fingers against it, and moved them like it was shaping sound.

“Hey,” it said one last time.

And it sounded closer to normal than it should have.

I drove until I hit pavement that looked plowed and saw lights in the distance. The shaking didn’t stop. My shin had swollen under my pants, and when I finally dared to pull over somewhere with a streetlamp, I saw blood seeping through the fabric where I’d slammed it on whatever was under that snow crust.

The next afternoon, after I’d gotten my leg looked at, I went to the ranger station and asked about the other name on the trail register. The woman behind the counter went still for a second, then told me the register “wasn’t for public discussion” and that if I wanted information I could file a report. She didn’t meet my eyes when she said it.

At urgent care they did an X-ray and told me nothing was broken, then rinsed the cut and put in a few stitches anyway because the rock had split me open clean through the skin.

I keep replaying the way those drag marks circled my tent, stopping at the zipper like it knew what that seam meant.

I keep thinking about the way it practiced that one word, over and over, like it was trying to get the tone right.

And every time I catch myself wanting to write it off as storm panic, I remember the pressure of something solid through the tent wall, and the sound it made when it peeled away, wet and wrong.

I haven’t slept outside since.
