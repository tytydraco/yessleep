A thing happened to me today and I can’t shake it off of my mind. I don’t know if any of you got the same experience last night because I feel I’m going crazy…

As a disclaimer, I’ve had multiple health checks for mild depression and anxiety but other from that, I’m an entirely healthy 22 year old guy. Yesterday, I went to sleep and had a nice dream (of which I completely forgot but I remember I was in a school or something). After I woke up, I opened up the windows to let in some fresh air and everything outside looked more vibrant than before. Everything looked much more crisp than what I remember. I texted my girlfriend goodmorning, and when she replied, I felt a rush of love and dopamine, I had never felt before. It was so powerful I almost cried. When I ate my cookies in the morning (as I have no time to prepare any breakfast in the morning before going to uni), it tasted much better than before. In my 3 hour lecture on modern European history, I felt captivated by the lecture on the 1848 Spring revolutions even thought I’ve always slept in this class before. However things started to get grange when I got back home.

After I went home, I opened up my computer to play some Valorant and I was greeted with the logo of Windows 13.

When I saw that logo, I was dumbstruck as I remember denying multiple times the upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11 so seeing this logo was extremely strange to me. Everything with the computer seemed fine and all the files were there. I went downstairs and everything was normal. At around 9, I was just on my computer looking at the Windows 13 logo and was still extremely confused. I had searching on Google if Windows 13 was the current version of Windows of which it reassured me it did. I even searched ChatGPT and it said:

The current version of Windows as of my last knowledge update in October 2023 is Windows 13. However, newer versions may have been released since then, and I recommend checking the official Microsoft website or a reliable source for the most up-to-date information.

I checked reddit and it had r/windows13 with over 500,000 members and tech support groups often had titles like: "Windows 13 won’t boot up". I even went on the system information tab on my PC and it also told me I had Windows 13.

Afterwards, I had enough and I went to sleep. In my dream, it was extremely vivid and I was in my room again. When I opened the window to let in some air, I was met with in a dark void with lots of floating keys in the sky. When I went downstairs, I was met with a strange figure holding a book. He explained to me that this reality is actually Windows 13 and that I was in the outdated reality which was Windows 10. He explained that Windows 10 was actually the same as Windows 13, but was actually a bad rendition of it. He explained that I was selected as a beta tester for Windows 13. And when he asked me if I wanted to stay, I explained to him that I wasn’t too comfortable and that it felt weird and off-putting. He understood and asked me if I wanted to go back to Windows 10 of which I happily agreed. He explained to me the terms and condition and that i would be stuck in Windows 10 forever, I explained to him that I understood and I accept the terms of the agreement.

Then, everything froze for about 10 seconds and I couldn’t move. Then, I was back in my room and I could move again. I open the window and everything is the same except not as vibrant as before. My screen displayed my usual anime wallpaper and I was back to Windows 10. Everything was again completely normal. However, when I went on ChatGPT, the prompt about Windows 13 was still there. When I asked if there was really Windows 13, it said:

I apologize for the confusion. The current version of Windows as of my last knowledge update in October 2023 is Windows 10. However, newer versions may have been released since then, and I recommend checking the official Microsoft website or a reliable source for the most up-to-date information.

Im writing here on r/sleep because this is the only place that will listen to my story and not call me a schizophrenic. If any of you has had the same experience, please write it in the comment! I feel like I’m going crazy, having other peeps with the same experience would help a lot!
