It was just another day of me getting bullied at school and just getting walked all over. I never really saw myself as something to be feared of because of my size and personality. I am a nerd who does good at school but I have no other talents and I am definitely not very cool. I can’t wait to leave school and start my life else where and my home life isn’t so good as well, parents fighting and siblings don’t like me. So this is why I never saw myself as something to be feared of and I wouldn’t be scared of myself as well.

Then I remember getting this feeling like something was watching me and sometimes I would catch a clown staring at me, then when I stare back at the clown, the clown suddenly turns away running. Then one random night I heard something in my room and when I go into my room, I see that clown and it screams at seeing. This clown was so scared of me and it was sam the sandown clown. I thought it was fake but he was standing right in front of me terrified of seeing me.

This clown begged me to just let it go and the reason it came into my life, was because it wanted to test its own bravery. I kind of laughed because I am not fearful in anyway and when my dysfunctional family saw sam the clown in my room, being all terrified of me, they started laughing their heads off. Sam was crying and begging out of complete fear of me and then my older brothers beat me up a little bit to show that I am completely weak and nothing to be feared of.

Usually an intruder would be shot to death but because sam the clown was so terrified and peeing his pants at the sight of me, my family were all laughing at the clown. When I tried to walk closer to same the sandown clown, the clown screamed in fright and hid under my bed. It was vibrating the bed, and when I tried to get closer to the clown again, sam the sandown clown screamed so loud that his head exploded.

The clown was so frightened of me that it took its own life and I had no idea what was so frightening of me. Then at school a witch tried getting closer to me and she was trying to test out her bravery by trying to get closer to me. When I tried to get closer to her, she screamed out of petrifying fear. I couldn’t understand what was so scary about me? and the witch started whimpering and completely regretting ever trying to test out her bravery by coming close to me. She then lit herself on fire as she couldn’t take it anymore.

I did not like being feared even though I have always been bullied by my school peers and at my home life. I did not like being feared and the reason for their fears of me was completely unknown to me, it was really irritating me. So I was getting bullied at school and at home, but these supernatural creatures and cryptids were terrified of me. Nothing was making sense.  

Then when a vampire tried to test out its bravery by getting close to me at school, it was scared of me as well. My bully laughed at the vampire for being scared of me, then when the vampire bit my bully, he then stepped into the sun from the shadows and he burnt into flame. Then the next couple of weeks as my bully was turning into a vampire, he started to become more and more scared of me for some reason. I have to admit I am kind of liking the fact that my bully is now scared of me.

What is so scary about me?
