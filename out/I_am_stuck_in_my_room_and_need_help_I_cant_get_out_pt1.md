As for you who don't know how it all started... I am a normal 15 year old teenager. I am posting here because it's my only hope... Today, I had woken up at around 5 am to get ready for school... When I wanted to go downstairs, when I pulled down the door handle, the door was stuck, it just wouldn't budge... I know that my room's door can sometimes get stuck and you have to pull harder to get it to open... But this was different... I pulled down the door handle and pulled the door as hard as I could for some reason. And it didn't open... At first, I thought maybe it just got stuck a little... So I called out for my mom... No answer came, even though she has work at 6 am and is usually awake at 5 am because of work.... I got extremely confused by now.... I yelled out again...

"Mom!? Are you there!?"

No answer... I started panicking because when I was a kid, my dad would lock me into the dark room at night... That's why my parents are now divorced. I took my phone, I could charge it, I had some music and headphones... At first I thought this would be nice, maybe my mom left for work earlier.... Maybe she was gonna come home later... And I could have maybe told her that my door was stuck and I couldn't leave my room so that she can call for help... I stayed home all day... It was around 4 pm when she was supposed to come home.... However, I couldn't hear my dog barking, I couldn't hear my cats playing and fighting... I was starting to get really scared because I don't have any food in my room except a few snacks like chips and some other stuff... I even have a bottle of water, however... Later on... 7 pm has passed by... I decided to call my mom on my phone, the phone rang and rang, nobody picked up... I cursed under my breath

"What the fuck is happening here??"

I wondered... I was really starting to get more panicked and scared.... I suffer from anxiety... And this happening was really bad for my anxiety... However, I could still recieve real-time messages.... Some of my friends asked me where I was in school, one of them, asked me the following......

"Dude, where the hell have you been?? Why didn't you come to school?"

I answered back while I was panicking.... Saying the following.

"Man.... I don't know what's going on but I'm really scared now.... I tried to open the door of my room but it just wouldn't budge... I'm really confused and scared, my mom should have been home by now but I don't hear anyone... Not even my dog barking..."

He replied back to me within minutes....

"Dude, stop playing a prank... We have a math exam tomorrow... I swear if this is some kind of a sick fucking joke, I'll see you tomorrow after school, behind and you're gonna tell me what the fuck is wrong with you!"

I then tried to take a photo of myself in my room... I did take it but when I opened my gallery, the picture wasn't there, as if it had never existed in the first place... I have a PC in my room... I have a lot of games on it, but currently... I was in no state to do anything now, I couldn't even think straight... I opened a bag of chips and drank a bit of water, but not too much, so I would have some for later... After doing that... I took a short nap and woke up at around 9 pm... I told myself one thing repeating it in my head as an idea popped to my mind....

"If the door won't open... Maybe I could try to ipen the window and jump out through it... Maybe I'd survive the fall...??"

I then cut myself off.... I knew I wouldn't survive the fall because my room was on the second story of the house and the yard was concrete.... From down there up to my window, there was maybe around 4 or 5 meters.... It was too tall of a height, and I am scared of heights... I said to myself the following...

"Maybe it's all just a lucid nightmare...? Maybe I am dreaming of this and it feels so real and it actually isn't? Or am I maybe losing my mind? Am I going insane?"

I've been writing this for about 35 minutes... I hope someone sees this and gives me an idea, because I can't get out of my room... Right now, I am extremely tired, currently, it's 10:12 pm exactly... I don't know what to do anymore.... I might just go to sleep and update you guys tomorrow.... If I am still alive by tomorrow.... 

Please wish me luck...
