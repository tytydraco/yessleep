Listen up, kid, and listen good. I got a story to tell you, a story that'll make your blood run cold. It's a story about me and Nick the Shimmy-Shaker, and a rat named Jimmy Bedsprings. Now, let me tell you, Jimmy was a real piece of work. He was a lowlife, a two-bit hustler, and a skirt-chaser of the worst kind. But what really got him in trouble was when he went and slept with the Don's wife.

Now, you gotta understand, the Don was a powerful man, the head of the Macaroni family, one of the most feared and respected mob families in the city despite the name (and clowns who chuckled at it once never lived long enough to do it again). And his wife, Maria, was a real looker, a dame with curves in all the right places. But she was also off-limits, if you catch my drift. No one, and I mean no one, was supposed to touch her except for the Don himself.

So when he found out what Jimmy had done, he went ballistic. Don Macaroni was like a raging bull, throwing things, breaking furniture, and cursing up a storm. And then he turned to us, me and Nicky, and he said, "Boys, I need you to take care of this rat. Make sure he sleeps with the fishes."

Well, we knew what that meant. We had to find Jimmy and give him a one-way ticket to the bottom of the river. And let me tell you, it wasn't easy. Jimmy was slippery, he knew the city like the back of his hand, and he had a lot of friends in low places. But we were determined, and we had a job to do. Don Macaroni wasn't a man you disappointed.

We spent the whole night looking for him, going from one dive bar to another, asking questions, following leads. And finally, around midnight, we found him. He was holed up in a seedy motel, with a bottle of whiskey in one hand and a dame in the other. He was so drunk he didn't even see us coming.

We did what we had to do, and Jimmy Bedsprings slept with the fishes that night, just like the Don wanted. But that's not the end of the story, kid. Not by a long shot.

See, something happened that night, something that I can't quite explain. Something that has haunted me ever since. I can't tell you what it was, not yet. But let's just say that Jimmy Bedsprings wasn't the only thing that went down that night. Something else happened, something that was dark and twisted that still makes my balls suck up into my guts if I think on it too long.

We took him down to the pier, where he spent his final minutes smoking a last cig and acting all cool like he didn't have a care in the world. But we knew better. We grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and dragged him down to the water's edge, where we had a bucket of cement waiting for him.

Now, Jimmy Bedsprings was no dummy. He knew what was coming, and he begged and pleaded for his life. But we weren't in the business of mercy. We shoved his feet into that bucket of cement and held him down as it hardened around him. And then, with one swift kick, we sent him over the edge and into the water below.

But that's when things got real freaky. As Jimmy sank deeper and deeper, something started to rise up from the water. At first, we thought it was just some big piece of garbage fallen off the back of one of the freighers. Or, when it started moving, a shark. Then we thought maybe it was a whale, like the one that got itself stuck in the harbor back in '57. As it got closer though, we realized how wrong we were.

That thing weren't no shark.

It was a monster. Yeah, I said it, a monster. I ain't the kind of guy who believes in superstition. I don't buy ghosts, UFOs, lucky rabbits feet, nothing. I'm telling you though, with every shred of integrity I have as a man of the mob from a time when that meant something, down in the harbor that night was a living nightmare-ass monster.

This thing was big, I'm talking skyscraper big. It had tentacles writhing all around it, like snakes on steroids. Its skin was slimy and covered in scales. Worst part wasn't its size though, or the mouth full of machete-length spikes that emerged when it parted its rubbery tractor tire-thick lips.

Nah, pal. It was its eyes. Its eyes was how I knew it was a monster. Only monsters have eyes that glow like that.

Let me tell you, I felt my balls tighten faster and harder than if they'd been grabbed by a dame with a grudge. It opened its jaws wide, and in one swift motion, it swallowed Jimmy whole. Snapped him up, no bother, barely had to part its rows of irregular yellowed fangs. And then it disappeared back into the depths, like it was never even there.

Me and Nick were frozen, bonafide statues in the briny midnight, unable to move as the thing vanished into the murky nothingness below the surface of the water. I dunno which one of us screamed first, but I do remember we both made an agreement the moment we got back in the car - whatever we both just saw, we didn't see, capiche? We came, whacked Jimmy Bedsprings, and now he's sleeping with the fishes. Just a normal Thursday in the mob.

And let me tell you, kid, I swore to myself for years that I ain't going near that pier again, not for all the gold in Fort Knox. Whatever that thing in the harbor was, it was scarier than your old lady with a switchblade in her hand and your sister in her bed, and I ain't taking no chances. So if you ever find yourself down by the water's edge, you better watch your back, pal. You never know what's lurking just beneath the surface.

Right after it happened - and for a good few years after - I didn't really think about it too much. I was more shell shocked than a Somme veteran, sure, but I was also busy trying to make sure we weren't caught by the cops. Me and Nicky never told Don Macaroni, or anyone. We were made men, see? We'd sent Jimmy to sleep with the fishes, not to come back with stories of sea monsters.
 
That was a long time ago now though, kid. I got old - too old to give a rats ass about my long-dead boss thinking I'd gone soft. Over the years, the image of that writhing wormish form rising from the inky darkness to snatch Jimmy Bedsprings up like fish flakes has stuck with me, a mental herpes festering in the crook of my thoughts. The memory's been gnawing at me, see, like a rat in the walls.

Now that I'm retired from the mob, I got nothing but time on my hands. And I can't shake this feeling that I need to go back to that pier and find Jimmy's body, to prove to myself that the monster wasn't real.

I know it sounds crazy, see, but I can't help it. That monster has been haunting my dreams for too long. I gotta face it head-on and prove to myself that it was just a figment of my imagination. Or else, I'll never be able to rest easy.

So, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go back to that pier and find Jimmy's body, no matter what it takes. I'll bring some buddies with me, just to be safe. But I gotta face that monster, see. I gotta know for sure if it was real or not. If it's not, great. If it was thenâ€¦ well, call me Captain Ahab. Otherwise I'll keep having the dreams about those glowing eyes until I die - and I'm genuinely worried they'll be what's waiting for me if I kick the bucket while that things still alive.
