I know what you are thinking.  Who in their right mind tries to have a relationship with a doll?  This guy must be a real loser.  Well, you know what, you’re wrong.  My name is Chet Stockbridge, and I am forty-three years old.  While I have had a moderately successful real estate career, my joyful personality doesn’t match up with my looks.  I’ve got an overly large, bald dome that resembles those alien images they show on TV when someone claims they saw something from beyond our world.  My gut ages me to the point that most of my clients think I’m sixty.  It doesn’t help that I’m short as well.  I never had any luck with the ladies, so on July 3^(rd), 2024, I purchased an adult-sized inflatable doll from a yard sale. 

I named her Allie.  She had caked on blonde hair with bright rosy cheeks and a smile that made me go weak in the legs.  A long gray painted on dress from her shoulders to her feet made her look business-like, professional.  I admired that about her.  She looked respectable, not like one of those sex dolls you buy online.  But of course, I drew odd looks from everyone when I took her into town. 

During our first night together, I took her to a diner and sat her across the table from me.  As I told her about my life, a few of the restaurant patrons left their booth and moved to tables farther away from me.  It didn’t bother me though.  I was falling fast for Allie.  To have someone there that could just listen to me, it really made me feel special.  After dinner, I took her home and together we watched a funny TV show.  I couldn’t remember the last time I had laughed so hard.  Her constant smile made me feel right at home, like my first romantic relationship might be falling into place.

The first few days went smoothly.  Before I left for work each day, I’d position her on the recliner chair that faces our living room window, kiss her on the cheek, and then wave goodbye to her as I headed out.  Roughly a week into our relationship, I started to notice her smile fading.  I chalked it up to the condition of the doll.  I figured the last owner may have owned it for quite some time.  However, the next evening, Allie’s smile looked more like a frown, like she was irritated at me.  I tried to butter her up by giving her a neck massage, but her serious face didn’t sit well with me.  I called it an early night and tucked her into bed next to me.

Around two in the morning, I felt something tickling my back.  I opened my eyes, turned around, and shuddered as Allie—now positioned sideways to face me—stared back at me with that upsetting scowl.  I grabbed her and flung her across the room.  Thirty seconds later, I picked her up and apologized for hurting her.

As each day came and went, seeing Allie upset made me sick.  I couldn’t handle it anymore, so I told her I was breaking up with her.  In an act of selfishness, I carried her outside and stuffed her into the garbage without even deflating her.  On July 17^(th) though—as I took a walk around the neighborhood—I spotted Allie in my neighbor Carl’s kitchen.  I stopped in my tracks and scratched my head.  Carl was dancing with my ex in his kitchen.  I stepped onto his grass for a closer look, and that’s when I noticed it; Allie’s smile was back, bigger than ever.  I rushed home and took a shower to calm myself.

On the morning of July 18^(th), my body felt different when I woke up.  I looked at myself in the bathroom mirror, and my jaw dropped as I appeared to be noticeably thinner.  As the day progressed, it felt like I was losing more and more weight.  Something is off though.  Yesterday when I looked at myself, I screamed because I no longer look human.  It’s hard to describe, but I almost look fake, like a doll.  I don’t know what is happening to me.  I’m scared about the rapid transformation of my body.  What should I do?
