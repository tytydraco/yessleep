I have always been interested in the paranormal. My father used to joke that the reason I liked horror so much was because my mother was reading Stephen King when I was still in the womb. When I was five years old, my grandmother and I \*accidentally\* watched *Pet Sematary* on a taped-from-television VHS cassette my dad maintained in an archive of similar bootlegs. In spite of this, to this day, I cannot recall ever having a paranormal experience of my own. Well, except for one… 

I grew up in a drafty, leaky-roofed house where the winters were bitter cold and the summers were swelteringly hot. This was the birthplace of suburbia on the unceded land of the Secatogue and Massapequa people on Paumanok, on what is now called Long Island, New York. 

At one time, all of the houses on our block looked the same. That was, until families began mutilating them. Eviscerating them. Adding a garage here. A second floor there. Still with just enough left intact to see that, in spite of all their efforts, the monikers of conformity remained just below the surface. Cookie-cut. Sterile. 

Our house sat just off of an exit ramp to a major highway; our backyard used to face a vacant lot. As such, the kids never played in the street, because the cars drove too fast. In fact, we hardly ever got to know our neighbors growing up. 

The neighborhood was quiet. Uncanny. Ghostly. 

My parents used to boast that, when they first moved to that upper-middle class hamlet, the population was “0% Black”. Code for safe. That persistent myth of suburbia as controlled chaos. The conquering of the state of nature. Uncertainty corralled behind a white picket fence. (The neighbor to the right of us had one). The boon of White flight asserted in neatly manicured lawns and egregious property taxes. 

I would learn much later, as an adult, that we lived on the poor side of town. North of the railroad tracks. On the other side of that major highway. 

It was among these modern horrors that my childhood was shaped. 

I was lucky enough to not really grow up there, however. I was instead carted all over Long Island, from doctors offices to research labs, inpatient psych hospital wards to special education programs. I was hardly exposed to the rampant racism, toxic masculinity, misogyny, and affluenza that, say, my siblings did. Aside from the occasional neighborhood bully. The unnamed benefits of being labeled a “sped”, I suppose.

Throughout this tempestuous time in my young life, a constant source of joy and support was my maternal grandmother. She had been a single mother who had raised my mother more or less alone; a career woman who, in spite of her poor choices in men, had instilled in all of us a stoic sense of self-determination. Later in life she became a golfer, though she was notorious for being a terrible driver. Me and my sibling would beg her to recount her stories of car accidents and near misses. Tales of rolling backwards down a steep hill when the clutch gave out on her Beetle or careening into a swamp when she took a wrong turn down a back road in her Pinto. 

When doctors doubted whether or not I would become a functional human being—a question that is still up for debate—my grandmother doted me. Empowered me. Loved me. Soothed my mind with convictions to remain “calm, cool, and collected”. She baby-sat us from an early age and it was her love that saw through to who I was becoming: an actual person. 

The house we lived in had been gifted to us by her and her third husband. She had lived there with him before moving to a gated community in Virginia. (A fitting move for retired suburbanites. At least it wasn’t Florida). Her husband had been the one to renovate the house, opening up the garage into a dining room and sitting area, and installing skylights that made the space light-filled, which to this day I celebrate. Of course, the skylights were installed improperly, which meant the roof leaked like a sieve whenever it rained any more than a drizzle. 

When I was eleven years old, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer and was given only a few months to live. This news devastated my mother. It was the same summer I was weened off my psychotropic medications and spiraled into an intense depressive episode. My mother used to beg me to stop crying. 

Eventually, she travelled down to Virginia to care for my grandmother in her final weeks of life. I don’t remember the last time I saw or spoke to her before she passed. 

During this time, I was an isolated kid who spent most of his days alone in his room making art or little films with my father’s outdated VHS home movie camera. My room—with burnt orange walls and mustard-colored shag carpet, courtesy of the 1960s—was beside the stairs and down the hall from my parent’s bedroom. The same bedroom my grandparents had slept in.

One night, the week my grandmother lay dying in Virginia, I was up late playing around with my video camera. The night before, I had had trouble sleeping because I heard odd noises out in the hall. At this time, my father was sleeping in the basement after having heart surgery. 

I set up my camera at the foot of my bed. I had been filming for some silly project, the nature of which I cannot remember. As I laid in bed, I could hear the distinct, rhythmic sound of footsteps coming up the stairs, walking across the hallway, and going into the bedroom. Complete with a gentle clap of the door behind them. 

This pattern repeated itself, over and over, but when I poked my head outside my door to see, there was nothing. Only the drafty, dimly lit hall. I crawled back into bed. Again, the same pattern repeated. Footfalls on the stairs. Footsteps in the hallway. The gentle latching of the bedroom door. Again and again and again. I checked, but even the door remained ajar. The bed crisply made. The darkened room inside, empty.  

I checked the camera, which for whatever reason was set to face me in bed rather than the hallway. I watched my eyes dart about, my expression one of confusion and surprise. I wasn’t scared. I was curious. Befuddled. But the camera recorded nothing, the sounds outside just faint enough to be beyond the grasp of its microphone. 

It was only later that I made the connection between the sounds and by grandmother. They couldn’t have persisted for more than a few nights. Maybe as long as she did… After that, the only sounds that might have been considered hauntings in that house were my parents arguing and the specters of suburbia just beyond its walls. 

My mother eventually returned home, exhausted from caregiving, with at least one paranormal story of her own. I have since moved away from suburbia, first to the multicultural urban sprawl of Queens, NY (where my mother grew up) and now to rural Appalachia in SW Virginia, just a few hours from where my grandmother spent the last and, so I’m told, most joyful years of her life. In adulthood, I feel her spirit with me more and more as I grow older. The love she gave me as neurodivergent kid was paramount in helping me to survive; to see the worth in my experiences. Paranormal or otherwise.

As for the video, I imagine it might be tucked away in the corner of that house’s sweltering attic, the hatch to which sat above my bed, kept warm by a layer of dust and pink fiberglass insulation. Or perhaps it sits in the damp crawl space beneath my parent’s footsteps. Biding its time. Waiting to be uncovered.
