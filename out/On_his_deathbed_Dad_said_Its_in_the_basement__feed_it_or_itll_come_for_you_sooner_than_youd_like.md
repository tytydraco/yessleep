There was one emotion I didn't expect to feel when Dad died: *relief*. The last few years of his life were spent in pain, bouncing around from doctor's offices to hospitals, all whilst preserving the stoic image he'd spent decades cultivating. He was weak at the end - a shell of the man that once stood in his place - and at some point it became evident that it wasn't a matter of if, but when. 



And when it did come, I felt relief. He was no longer with us, but at least he wasn't suffering anymore. He could finally rest, wherever that may be. There was another emotion I felt before the grief began to settle in, though, and it was one of fear. As I sat beside his deathbed and against a backdrop of machines faintly whirring, Dad spoke what would become his final words: 



"*It's in the basement, Son, feed it or it'll come for you sooner than you'd like.*" 



My dad was a serious person, stoic, as I mentioned, and there was nothing to indicate that he was trying to get one last laugh out of someone. I desperately tried to coax an elaboration out of him, but as soon as the final word rang out, the machines surrounding him began to signify the end. He was pronounced dead a few minutes later, and the sinking feeling of despair that clawed its way into my mind temporarily washed away the unknowable fear that had entered not long before. 



Grief is a funny thing, though, and over the coming days, I found myself ruminating over Dad's final words, hoping for them to provide some reprieve from the gaping hole created by his absence. He never had the chance to explain further, but he gave me a starting point nonetheless. Mom died a few years earlier, and I had always been an only child, whilst my wife and I, not for a lack of trying, remained childless, which meant that cleaning out Dad's stuff fell to me. I decided I would venture into the basement whilst doing so, and soon enough, the day arrived. I declined my wife's offer to join me, taking after Dad's composed manner and shouldering the load myself. 





I had never known that the house had a basement, even though I grew up there. A little hatch was suddenly present in a corner of the living room where there had always been a hardwood floor, and as I hauled box after box into my truck, it was almost as if I could feel its presence. Like the closer I was to it, the more it beckoned me inside to see what it held. 



"*Calm down, I'll get to ya*", I thought to myself, poorly attempting to disguise the intense sadness that what I was doing filled me with. And eventually I did. There was an old-timey wooden ladder leading down to the basement, and with no way of knowing if the lights worked down there, I armed myself with a flashlight and plenty of pretend confidence before making my way into the darkness. 



I fumbled with the flashlight as my eyes struggled to adjust to the nothingness before them until I managed to find the light switch beside me and flicked it on, only to be met with a scene of horrific insanity. 



A figure of deformed proportions was propped up in a chair across from me. Its feet were practically fossils, its legs in a somewhat similar shape, its torso like that of a body buried decades ago, and its head - its face...



Was that of my Dad. 



The eyes were hollow and oozing a yellow substance, the tongue decaying as it stuck out, unable to move, and the entire face drooped in candle-wax melting fashion. 



But, unmistakably, it was *his*. 



I stumbled back in a dread-filled amalgamation of emotions, before the realisation hit me. I had been so preoccupied with what lay in front of me that I had forgotten Dad's final words. The tone he used. The way he died as soon as he warned of the existence of the burden I now shouldered. The way Grandpa allowed nobody but Dad in to visit in the days before he died, all those years ago. 



And as it all clicked into place in a crescendo of sudden knowing, the buzz of the phone in my pocket took me out of the moment. 



It was my wife. 



"*Honey, you won't believe it...*



*We're having a baby.*‚Äù
