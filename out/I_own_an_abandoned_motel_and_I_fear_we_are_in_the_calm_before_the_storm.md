The next few days were quiet, as though the release of Muriel’s presence had temporarily endowed the property with a fragile peace. For the three of us, however, peace meant always looking over our shoulders, wondering what price we would pay and when it would be demanded of us.

Often, I found my thoughts drifting back to my great-grandparents, to John and Ellen. What was this place, really? Was it just a dumping ground for those the witch wanted to punish? Some sort of demented zoo with my family as the reluctant keepers? Could this place ever be normal, a place of happiness once more?

And even if we could proceed to each cottage and one by one eliminate each entity, what then? When would the hammer fall? Surely, the witch had some retribution planned, even if it appeared that for now she allowed me to mess with her playthings.  

How do you prepare to face a…being like that? Waiting was the only thing that made sense to me. Biding my time until I thought of a solution. Or until my time ran out.

I read Martina’s notebook every day, hoping that the next time I’d open it, it would magically be filled with answers. I’d sit with a tumbler of whiskey and willed things to be different. While I sat ruminating, René, with the help of an apologetic Jake, had begun the repairs to my front porch. I’m not asking where they got their materials—they showed up a couple nights ago with the exact amount in tow. They were nearly finished already and I began to understand why my great-grandparents had found supernatural labor so valuable.

In fact, I understand a lot more about my great-grandparents now. It all started when I was searching for my uncle’s Irish crystal whiskey glasses for my nightly tipple. They weren’t particularly valuable, but they were pretty and I thought it would be nice to use them. I recalled seeing them in a small box in the drawers underneath the bookshelf. As I pushed aside old beer koozies and golf tees, my hand hit a smooth, slim leatherbound album.

I opened it. It was my great-grandparents’ wedding photograph from 1921, Ellen with a magnificent lace veil pooling at the ground, secured with a circlet of flowers across her brow in the fashion of the time, John standing beside her in a three-piece suit, the hint of a smile on both their lips, eyes joyous. The next photo was of Ellen sitting on a blanket in front of a familiar looking dock. Then of John posing with a Model T. Ellen and John together in a boat. Numerous, casual, playful pictures of people I hadn’t known.

“He loved that Kodak camera.”

I looked up to find René at my shoulder, smiling wistfully.

“What happened, René? What happened to this place?”

He nodded sadly.

“It’s time, isn’t it?”

“Yes. It’s time.”

He sat beside me and began to speak.

“For fifty years, I had wandered after being released from the service of the witch, haunting the campfires of the St. Lawrence, looking for the blood of evil ones, or perhaps someone in need of some carpentry.” He laughed dryly.

“I did not mind that my existence was far more menial than it had been with *her.* I relished the freedom, for the first time in nearly two centuries, I could go where I pleased. The nights were mine.

I was walking along the river on one such night in May of 1923 when I came across a group of men, arguing in low, but stern voices, barely above a whisper, but obviously audible for a creature such as me. The evening was pitch black, a night of the new moon, perfectly capable of hiding certain types of activity from prying eyes. I crouched down behind a copse of trees. One man stood on a dock, and two sat in a small boat laden with what appeared to be crates of vegetables. All three wore flat caps pulled low, obscuring their features.

I hadn’t fed in awhile and the prospect of coming across not one, but multiple potential ne’er do wells was almost too exciting. I listened to the conversation intently. There was a disagreement between the man on the dock and the men in the boat.

‘That price is insultingly low, John,’ said one of the boat men.

‘I’m sorry.  I can’t budge.’

‘After all the nice business we’ve done together…’

‘My friends were pretty upset with the condition of the goods last time. Corks were wet, juice was undrinkable.’

‘We’re out here risking our necks for your “friends” and the best you can do is some lowball offer? We would have gone with Simpson’s crew if we knew you were going to be so stingy.’

‘You’ve gotten careless, Doyle. Maybe if you had put some of the money into fixing that leaky boat of yours instead of with your bookie, we wouldn’t be in this unfortunate situation.’

I could sense a wave of rancor rise in the men of the boat. One of them was armed. I knew that the man at the dock would not leave there alive, and that gunshots would spoil my chance at a decent meal. Sure enough, the man called Doyle drew a gun on the man at the dock. The man called John took a step back and raised his hands, but his face was resolute. No one paid attention as I crept silently down towards the river. I assessed the distance between me and Doyle. 

With a leap I pushed John to the ground and pounced on Doyle in the boat. Before he could react, I was ripping into his neck and drinking, until all too quickly he dropped to the ground. His accomplice was screaming. He tried to jump out of the boat, but John cut the rope mooring and fled into the night, leaving us out to drift. I grabbed the other boat man’s collar, bit into his artery and he met the same fate as his companion.

I cleared the bodies of any valuable items and shot the corpses with the gun. After some time in the river, the authorities would assume the deaths were “ordinary” homicides. Underneath the vegetables were a couple crates of fine champagne. I decided to let those bottles drift with the boat, treasure for a lucky scavenger to find. 

I did not enjoy the swim to the shore, but even though I was soaked, I felt wonderful with the infusion of fresh blood. Between the blood and the cash, I figured I was in good shape for quite some time. I was so exuberant that I completely forgot about the third man, John. He was lying in wait for me with his knife. He plunged it into my side before I could throw him off of me and with a groan, I saw a good deal of that hard earned blood pour out before the wound healed.  John’s every instinct told him to run away, but he stood transfixed at the monster before him, shaking.

‘I saved your life and this is how you repay me,’ I chuckled. I locked eyes with him. ‘Be calm, John,’ I instructed. He took a deep breath and put his knife away.

‘What are you?’ He asked.

‘A vampire,’ I said. 

Why mince words? He had seen me in action, after all. I could see that this troubled him, of course. Nevertheless, he shocked me by extending his hand. 

‘Vampire or no, I suppose I’m in your debt.’

I took it and though I saw a sliver of fear pass through his eyes at the coldness of my touch, we shook.

‘John Calnon.’

‘René Allaire.’

‘I’d say it’s a pleasure, but I’m not sure that’s the right word.’

I laughed.

‘Likewise,’ I said, pointing to the bloodied hole in my shirt where he had wounded me.

‘Ah, well, sorry about that. I suppose if you were going to kill me you would have done so already.’

‘That is correct.’

‘So then, Mr. Allaire, I’m at your service. I’d offer you the champagne those assholes were bringing me, but I doubt you’d have much use for it.’

‘No, that’s quite alright. I only ask for a place to stay during the day. Somewhere the sunlight can’t penetrate.’

‘I have cellar. With a sturdy metal door and lock.’

‘That would do nicely. Thank you.’

‘As I said, I’m in your debt.’

I followed him up a rocky hill to a humble white clapboard house. Before he could open the doors to the cellar, a woman ran out, a look of concern on her face.

‘John!’ she cried, embracing him. ‘I heard gunshots!’

‘I’m fine,’ he muttered. She pulled away and examined him, then looked at me, her eyes immediately drawn to the blood on my shirt and face, and the fact that I was still quite wet. She turned to John, waiting for an introduction or explanation.

‘Ellen,’ he began, voice unsure. ‘This is René Allaire.  Mr. Allaire, this is my wife, Ellen. Ellen, this man just saved my life. Doyle and Miller drew a gun and, well…” He trailed off.

‘I took care of them,’ I added. Ellen narrowed her eyes.

‘What do you mean?’ she said suspiciously. 

I glanced at John who seemed frozen with indecision. My usual practice was secrecy, of course. But I had already revealed myself to John. Ellen had just as much a right to know. I opened my mouth, revealing my fangs. Her eyes widened, and the color drained out of her face. 

‘You said your name was Allaire?’ she asked.

‘Yes. I was from French Canada.’

‘As were my parents,’ she said. ‘My grandmother would tell me stories about creatures like you. The blood drinker.’

‘That is what I am. Your husband has kindly offered me your cellar for my rest, but I understand if you do not want me under your roof.’

Ellen and John exchanged glances. Ellen nodded.

‘If you saved John’s life, then his debt is mine as well. Would you care to warm yourself by our fire? I can give you some of John’s old clothes.’

This act of kindness may sound trivial to you, but you have to understand, it was the most I had received in over two centuries. I agreed to her offer, genuinely moved.

As we walked up the wooden stairs to their home, one buckled under me. John and Ellen were apologetic.

‘I can fix it,’ I said. ‘I’m a carpenter.’

Ellen’s face lit up with excitement, but John did not share her enthusiasm. Within moments, we were seated by the fire, my wet and dirty clothes replaced. Ellen handed me a rolled-up piece of paper, spreading it out before me. It was a blueprint for a series of cottages scattered around the land adjacent to the Calnons’ home. 

‘We have some money now,’ John began hesitantly. ‘I’ve always worked as a handy man—jack of all trades, really—for a bunch of the rich folks who have their summer homes around here. Been doing that since I was a kid. Since Prohibition, those rich folks have been antsy. Can’t get the booze they’re accustomed to anymore. That’s where I come in. I go between them and the smugglers. Works well for everyone. Rich people don’t get their hands dirty and I get my cut. It's been very good money for us.’

‘But if we could build these cottages, we wouldn’t need that sort of money any more,’ Ellen interjected eagerly. ‘As you saw today, it’s dangerous. Too dangerous. You see, we’ll be having a baby in November.’

‘I understand. If you let me stay here and provide the materials, I’ll build whatever you like.’

And so, we agreed. It was a fine summer, full of warmth and true companionship. John found me a proper house to live in, owned by his cousin, but often I would find myself staying in the Calnons’ cellar after long nights of work. I embellished Ellen’s design with a few of my own touches and by the time the first cold breezes announced the arrival of autumn, the cottages were nearly completed.

That’s when the trouble began. 

One night, I was finishing up some final tasks. I was returning to the cellar when I passed by one of the recently completed cottages. There was a dull, yet distinctive scratching sound, accompanied by a low humming that felt as though it were coming from under my skin. I put my ear to the cottage’s door and the sound only became louder. I opened the door and out poured a horde of cockroaches. The entire floor was covered with them, a veritable writhing carpet. They crawled out of the door, over my boots and into the dark, leaving exposed on the cottage floor the bones of a cat, picked clean.

I lowered myself to the floor, my head in my hands, stifling a cry of despair and disbelief. I knew that she had found me. For a half of a century, she had left me in peace. No macabre little gifts, no black apparitions in the dead of night, no malevolent laughter. I had truly believed that I was free. How foolish I was, over two hundred years old and still the naïve youth. 

I decided to not worry Ellen and John, especially given Ellen’s delicate condition. I figured that I could run away, leave them to their lives. The thought of leaving without saying goodbye to the people who had been so kind to me was almost unbearable, but I knew I had to do it. 

I was too late.

No sooner had I made the decision to leave when the sky began to churn that familiar, nauseating green. Ellen and John stepped outside in their bedclothes holding each other in fear.

“There’s someone…laughing in the house,” John said bewildered, eyes wide with terror.

“You both need to listen to me. Leave *now*. Go to your church, wake up the priest, do whatever you need to do, but stay in the sanctuary until sunrise. Do you understand?”

They nodded. John disappeared inside the house and returned with a woolen blanket, which he wrapped around Ellen, and his gun. They ran down the hill to their Model T, but before they could escape inside, the car burst into flames. They screamed.

I felt a burning hand on my arm, cold lips at my ear. My stomach churned.

“You are mine. Forever.”

Her voice was death. I did not turn around.

“Take me then. Leave them be.”

She walked in front of me, her hand caressing my cheek as she passed. She gazed with disdain at the Calnons cowering before her.

“Pathetic, René. You truly are pathetic. I give you the world and this is where I find you?”

“What is he to you?” she said to John and Ellen. “Did you think a creature such as he could be your pet?”

“He is our friend,” said Ellen resolutely. She stood straight and wiped the fear from her face.

The witch’s mouth peeled into a wide, black grin. John aimed his gun at her with trembling hands, which, of course, made her smile even wider.

“Arrogance. The vice of all men.” With a twist of her hand, she forced them to kneel before her in the ground. She bent down and placed a hand on Ellen’s belly. Ellen shrieked with heartrending agony. “I haven’t held a baby in so long.  Shall I take him? Shall I carve it out of her right now?”

“Enough!” I shouted. “Let’s make a deal. Do what you want to me, take me, kill me, I don’t care. But leave them and their child alone.”

“You do not know what you ask. You still think the worst thing is death,” she laughed.

“Do we have a deal?”

“Yes. It is done.” A short dagger materialized in her hand. She began to kiss me, and for the sake of the Calnons, I dared not flinch or turn away. She drove the dagger into my gut, my chest, over and over until I staggered and collapsed. She straddled my body and with one swift movement cut my throat. Blood poured out of my many wounds; my body not quick enough to heal them. I was weak, so weak I could barely lift my head. 

“These mortals I will spare, but this place…” she gestured to the cottages around her. “I quite like it. I have friends of mine, humble servants, who need a home. And as you two seem so fond of monsters,” she said kicking me, causing even more blood to spill out of my mouth, “you will find no trouble extending to them the same hospitality. They require a certain amount of…upkeep. But you will learn and obey the rules.”

She turned towards me, bleeding out before her. 

“And as for you, my traitorous lover. I see you delight in your craftsmanship. Did you like playing at the simple carpenter, once more? Perhaps you’d like to stay here forever.”

I felt my body lifted, suspended in air. I was walking into a dark place, though I knew I could not move. The sound of wood, hammers, coming as though from a distance. The air was hot and close. Taxing all my strength, I lifted my hand and immediately touched a wall. I was trapped, entombed.

She was right, there are worse things than death. But those first years, in which my consciousness and thirst nearly drove me mad, the worst was knowing that it was my fault, my hubris that brought the witch to torment your family, though only now do I understand what she has done here.”

“And what was that?” I asked, hugging the album of John and Ellen close, as though I could reach back in time and protect them from what was coming.

“Payments, taxes, your grandfather was wise to conceive of them as debts. For even a creature such as she has such obligations. The entities that she has bound to the cottages, burdening your family with their maintenance—that is but mere amusement to her. But then there is the grand tax, the one above all, the one that even *she* must pay on the quarter days. To keep with our corporate metaphors, she has outsourced even that grave duty to the caretakers of this place. John and Ellen, your grandfather, your uncle, Martina, and now you, you became her unwitting agents.”

“How do we break it? How do we default, so to speak?”

He shook his head.

“That I do not know. I can only hope we have time to figure it out.”

I stood and though my heart was heavy, I embraced him.

“I don’t blame you for this. I hope you know that.”

I felt him exhale, his arms tightened around me.

“Thank you.”

Just then Jake threw open the cottage door. A look of befuddled amusement crossed his face at seeing us together.

“I hope I’m not interrupting anything. But there’s a cottage on fire.”
