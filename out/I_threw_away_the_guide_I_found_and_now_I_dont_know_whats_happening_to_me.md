I bought an abandoned house at a foreclosure.  I had been completely screwed in my divorce, and moving far away from everything I had known to a rundown colonial was my way of coping.  The first issue I found with the house was the fridge.  It was one of those basic one-door, metallic fridges with a small freezer drawer underneath.  It would’ve needed to be replaced even if the door hadn’t fallen off as soon as I touched it.  On top of that someone had *cut* the power cable.  Then there was that damn phone.   

It was an unlocked phone sitting in the fridge.  Everything on it was deleted except for a single note.  It listed out a bunch of bizarre rules that I glanced through.  They seemed stupid.  Things like avoiding water and malls, and not trusting landmarks.  I thought it was just a bunch of paranoid nonsense written by a Sam or Sally or something.  I dismissed it immediately, and cashed it in to contribute to my new fridge fund.  But all my problems started when I found it.  The guide must have explained what is going on now, but I don’t have it.  I am hoping that Sam or Sally is still out there, and can explain what the guide said, because I don’t know what I did wrong and why this is happening to me.  It’s going to happen again and I need help.

The first time was when I was measuring the spot for a new fridge.  I was carefully considering how much of the kitchen cabinets I could afford to trash, when I disappeared.  Well, *I* didn’t.  I looked down at the measuring tape and looked up at an empty room.  I had been forcibly taken into some dreary place.  Fluorescent lights, plain wallpaper, tacky carpet, it could only be an office.  Or *almost* an office.  I could tell it was off just from standing in it.  The multicolor carpet felt warm and sterile, and my feet sank into it like I was walking on a mattress.  

I know I can sound flippant.  It was one of the things my wife always complains about.  “Why can’t you be more serious?”  “Why can’t we ever just talk?”  “Why can’t we watch a movie without you constantly mocking it?”  “Why can’t we have a baby?”  Well ex-wife.  It’s just my coping mechanism.  You can’t imagine all the thoughts that went through my head the moment I found myself in that not-office.  Was I finally going senile like my father?  Did I go into some fugue state and wander off?  My heart was pounding in my chest while I took in that bewildering space and I just started laughing.  Hysterically.  You hear stories about seeing something so jarring, so bizarre that you can’t even process it.  That’s what it was like the first time.  I don’t know how long I stood there alternating between laughing, crying, and petrified fear.  Then I heard a doorknob rattle behind me.  When I turned around, I was back in my kitchen.  

After that, I just sat on the couch and endlessly scrolled through my phone, fighting the urge to call Emma and tell her everything.  She had been one of my confidants.  Even though we have gone through some rough times I still trust her.  Or *had* trusted her until she blindsided me with those papers.  I thought about calling Mike instead.  We had been friends since high school, more or less, and I could at least bounce ideas off him.  In the end I didn’t do anything.  Just convinced myself that it must have been a dream.  And that I somehow accidentally threw away my measuring tape without noticing. 

I’d still think I was just going senile, if it didn’t happen again.  It was nearly a week later, the new fridge had just been installed, and I was trying to clean out a scuff mark the movers had left on the kitchen floor.  I paused to gauge my progress when I was back in the not-office.  But this time I had a plan.  I steadied my breathing and took out my phone to start filming.  I took a solid half-a-minute video all around the room.  Then I stopped to watch it.  To see if I really was going crazy.  Watching that video I was frozen in fear.  The walls *shifted* to track my *eyes*, but not the camera.  The entire “room” was set dressing, and wherever I wasn’t watching, *it* was watching me back.  I looked back and forth between the wall and the video, icy pinpricks slowly working their way up my back, trying to comprehend how the wall could really be that fleshy, eye-covered monstrosity when *it* opened.  A large eye staring out from the wall.  Boring into me.  I could feel every ounce of its curiosity, confusion, and then, focused anger.  It didn’t *want* to be seen.  Then its eyelid closed and there was a wall again.

I turned around looking for more eyes, and realized the walls were closer.  I fell to my knees with a gasp struggling to my stomach roiling, struggling to stay calm as the reality of my situation settled on top of me.  As, I pressed into the spongy ground, I could feel something slimy pooling around my hands.  This wasn’t a carpet either.  I threw up onto the floor.  My own vomit mixing with the villi that made up the floor.  I looked away from that disgusting mess, and the walls had gotten closer.  I stared at the walls.  Hoping they’d stop moving.  Then I felt a sudden weight as something slammed into my arm.  Like a pane of glass falling from the ceiling.  I involuntarily jerked my arm back, and realized I’d dropped my phone when I threw-up.  When I got back, only half of it had made it back to the kitchen.  

I avoided the kitchen after that as much as I could.  Moving won't help.  I’m not stupid.  After two days I made arrangements to stay at a hotel so I could get a good night’s sleep.  While I laid in that musty hotel bed, finally able to relax, I had all sorts of dreams about selling the house and pretending all of this had never happened.  Maybe Emma would even take me back.  Then I woke up in a water treatment plant.  Same hotel bed.  Same me.  Just now we were surrounded by bright lights, white-painted concrete, and chutes diverting water all over.  The “water” smelled off too.  Like hydrogen peroxide.  I felt exposed as I crawled out the bed in my underwear and looked around.  At first, I wasn’t sure if I was just being pranked or if this was somehow connected to the not-office.  I walked to the edge of one of the chutes, and tried testing the water with my toes.  It only took a few seconds for them to start burning.  My toes were blistering from whatever was in that water.  I quickly jumped back into the bed and dried off my foot with the gross hotel comforter.  I laid back and stared at the ceiling.  Trying to will myself back to the hotel.  An eye opened up above me and I stifled a gasp.  Then I heard the creak of a door opening behind me.  I curled into a ball and started praying that this was just a dream.  I heard a shuddering step into the room, echoing across the tunnels.  Then another.  My eyes cracked open, and all I saw was a flash of white before I was back in the hotel.  

I stay in my house as much as possible now, to avoid popping into some unknown, dangerous situation.  Before yesterday, the not-office seemed to be relatively empty.  The most I’d hear was a door opening.  It seemed like the worst that could happen was getting cut by the invisible box that teleports me back and forth.  As long as I stood still, I was safe.  And, over the course of two months, it’d become routine.  I naively thought that this was something I could handle with an upbeat attitude.  

Yesterday started off like any of the other times.  I had just poured a new cup of coffee and was headed back to my computer when I was back in the not-office.  I immediately froze and stood as still as possible to wait it out.  I had nearly finished my coffee when the I heard the door start to creak.  I ignored it.  Then, I felt that pane of glass coming down on my *head*, and instinctively jumped back.  In the wrong direction.  A split second later I was in the same place.  I had missed my way back.  Then I saw what had opened the door.

Pale, white figures began marching into the room.  About a dozen of them and all roughly the same shape and size.  Lined up behind me and standing still they looked like mannequins.  I took one step forward hoping I was now correctly lined up with that invisible box.  I heard the mannequins move as well, and turned around.  They were all mimicking me.  Awkwardly copying my posture and movements.  One more walked into the room, it looked more feminine than the others, and began walking down the line.  She stood in front of each of them, scrutinizing them.  Turning her head this way and that.  It took me a few moments to realize she was comparing them to me.  Sending the ones that didn’t match closely enough to wait in front of the door.  All the while, I stood still and hoped that I’d be sent back soon.  I wanted to scream and run.  To put as much distance between myself and whatever they were planning, but I couldn’t risk moving and losing my only means of escape.  

Eventually she narrowed it down to one that was my exact build, more or less.  She led him to stand right in front of me and I could feel the happiness radiating off of him.  She positioned herself directly behind him leaned one arm back and with a whirlwind of motion, struck him on the crown of his head.  Hard.  It made the crisp sound of wood striking wood.  He was completely unfazed.  Then she struck him again, her hand moving faster than my eyes could follow.  And again.  Those crisp thwacks turned into a sickening crunch.  Fractures had formed all along his head.  She paused, and I could see that her own hand was fracturing as well.  

She only stopped for a moment, before she began clawing him.  Focusing on the cracks.  Digging her fingertips in the tiny gaps.  Deepening and spreading them.  Tiny flecks of his shell fell to the floor. Then she pulled off a large piece from his face, and let it slowly drop from her hand in triumph.  It hit ground with a dampened thump.  What was hiding inside that shell is something I still can’t put into words.  But it was definitely smiling.  She was reinvigorated by her progress and feverishly chipped away at him further.  She had just cleared the torso when I popped back.  God knows what they’d have done when she finished.

After that I did call Emma.  I broke down completely and told her everything.  I almost started crying.  And her *advice*, her words of *wisdom*, were to “go see a doctor.”  “There’s no such thing as aliens, you’re hallucinating.  You need to see a doctor, Greg.”  A *doctor*!  Like I don’t have heaps of evidence of what’s happening to me!  My phone being cut in half, the fridge, my missing tape, the blisters on my foot.  Even the hotel bed I stayed in was damaged.  Still, she won’t believe me.  She *won’t*.  I tried calling Mike as well, but I framed my question as a hypothetical.  His advice was to blow it up or burn it.  Yeah.  Great advice.  Try lighting a room that you are already inside on fire.  They think it’s a joke.  They don’t realize how terrifying my life is now.  I *can’t* stop them from taking me again, and I don’t want to know what they’re going to do next.

Please help me.  I don’t know if someone knows who Sam is, or what rules I’m supposed to be following, but I need help stopping this.  I don’t sleep anymore.  I can’t *allow* myself to sleep for more than an hour at a time.  If someone’s seen their guide or knows what it says, please send it to me I don’t know what to do.
