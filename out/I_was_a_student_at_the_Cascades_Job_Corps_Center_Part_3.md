The hospital loomed in the distance, its dark silhouette barely visible through the dense fog. The air was cold, sharper than it had been earlier in the day, biting against my skin as we approached. No one spoke. Our footsteps were muffled by the wet grass, and the only sound was the occasional rustle of the supplies we carried.

We reached the back entrance, the same one we’d escaped from days earlier. The metal door, slightly ajar, creaked as Tony pushed it open. A faint, sterile odor drifted out—bleach, decay, and something else that made my stomach turn.

“Last chance to turn back,” Lex muttered, his voice barely audible.

“No one’s turning back,” Andre replied firmly. He flicked on his flashlight, “Let’s get this over with.”

We slipped inside, the door shutting behind us with a soft click that sounded far louder than it should have. The building felt different now.

We moved quickly, retracing our steps through the dimly lit hallways. The floor tiles were cracked and stained.

The stairs we’d used last time stood ahead, the lower stairway leading into the blackness below.

“This is it,” I said, my voice hollow.

“Of course it’s stairs,” Tony muttered. “Because an elevator would’ve been too easy.”

Andre went first, his flashlight gripped tightly in his hand. “Wait until I’m down before the next person starts following.”

One by one, we descended into the unknown, the cold metal railing biting into my palm. The air grew heavier the further we went, carrying a faint, metallic tang that made my throat dry.

When we finally reached the bottom, the flashlight beams revealed a narrow, concrete tunnel. The walls were lined with rusted pipes, some leaking a slow trickle of water that dripped into shallow puddles on the floor. The sound echoed around us, giving the space a sense of vastness despite its cramped confines.

“Which way?” Kelsey asked, her voice trembling.

Andre checked the map of the tunnels we’d found in the maintenance room. “Left. The main tunnel should lead us deeper into the complex. If the note was right, the answers are down here somewhere.”

As we moved, the tension between us grew. Every sound felt amplified, the shuffle of our boots, the distant drip of water, the faint hum of machinery somewhere far off.

“Does anyone else feel that?” Tony asked suddenly, stopping in his tracks.

“Feel what?” I whispered.

“Like… we’re being watched.”

No one responded, but I could see it on their faces. They felt it too.

The tunnel eventually opened into a larger chamber, dimly lit by flickering fluorescent lights overhead.

Before anyone could say anything else, a sound echoed through the chamber, similar to the one we heard in the hospital days before. A low, rhythmic, guttural noise that sent a shiver down my spine.

“Did you hear that?” Kelsey whispered, her flashlight shaking slightly in her hand.

We froze, the beam of Andre’s flashlight swinging wildly as he scanned the room. The noise came again, louder this time. It sounded almost human but… not quite.

“It’s coming from up ahead,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

“No,” Lex hissed. “We’re not going toward that. Are you insane?”

“We don’t have a choice,” Andre said firmly, his grip tightening around his wrench, “If Rachael’s down here, we can’t leave her.”

Reluctantly, we moved forward, the sound growing louder with every step. The tunnel narrowed again, forcing us into single file. My heart pounded in my chest, each beat echoing in my ears.

We ended up in a large room. I covered my nose to mask the burnt scent hitting me. Inside, everything seemed to be covered in a light layer of soot and on the far side of the room, a rusted furnace. Along the walls were rows of metal gurneys with body bags resting on them.

Then we saw it. A figure resting on one of the gurneys, covered by a white sheet just the like ones we saw inside the hospital. Only, this time it was motionless.

Kelsey moved towards it first, “Is that…?” but her words trailed off as we got closer.

She slowly started to lift the sheet off of the humanoid figure.

It was James. Or what was left of him. His face was pale, his eyes sunken, and his body twisted at unnatural angles. A sharp, metallic smell filled the air, and I had to fight the urge to gag.

Kelsey screamed.

“Holy shit,” Tony breathed, his flashlight trembling in his hand. “What… what did they do to him?”

Andre knelt beside the body, his expression grim. “He’s been dead for a while,” he said quietly. “But… how did he get down here? He wasn’t with us at the hospital.”

Before anyone could answer, the guttural noise came again, this time from behind us, louder and closer than before.

“We need to move,” I said, panic rising in my chest. “Now.”

As we turned to leave, a shadow moved at the edge of the flashlight beams.

“Wait. did you see that?” Kelsey whispered, her voice trembling.

Another sound echoed through the room, this time a soft, shuffling noise. My stomach dropped as a figure stepped into the light, blocking our exit.

It was Rachael. Or at least, it looked like her.

Her eyes were empty, her movements jerky and unnatural. A deep scar ran across her forehead, and the way she stared at us sent chills through my entire body.

“Rachael?” I said, my voice barely audible.

She let out a low, guttural growl, her head tilting unnaturally to the side. Then she lunged.


Time slowed as Rachael lunged, her unnatural movements horrifying and swift. Andre reacted first, shoving Kelsey out of the way and raising his wrench in a futile attempt to protect us.

“Rachael, stop!” he shouted, his voice trembling, as though some shred of the person we once knew might still be inside.

She didn’t stop. She didn’t even flinch.

The impact sent Andre crashing to the floor, his flashlight spinning wildly as it hit the ground. Shadows danced across the walls, making everything feel even more chaotic. Rachael clawed at him, her movements feral, her growls echoing like something out of a nightmare.

“Get her off him!” Kelsey screamed.

Tony and Lex grabbed her, their hands shaking as they tried to pull her back, but she was stronger than she should’ve been, inhumanly strong. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest, until Kelsey shoved something into my hands.

The crowbar.

“Do something!” she yelled.

My mind raced. It wasn’t Rachael. It couldn’t be. But as I raised the crowbar, I hesitated. What if it was her? What if there was a way to save her?

Andre screamed in pain, snapping me out of my thoughts. His arm was bleeding, her nails digging deep into his skin.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered, swinging the crowbar.

The impact sent her sprawling, her body hitting the floor with a sickening thud. She lay still for a moment, and I thought it was over.

Then she started to move again.

Her head twisted unnaturally, her eyes locking onto me. The guttural growl returned, deeper and more menacing, as she pushed herself up, her limbs bending at impossible angles.

“Run!” Andre shouted, clutching his arm.

We didn’t need to be told twice. Grabbing Andre, we bolted down the tunnel, the sound of her growls echoing behind us. My flashlight bobbed wildly.

“What the hell was that?” Tony yelled as we ran, his voice breaking.

“Not now!” Lex snapped, his breathing ragged.

The tunnel opened into another chamber, this one larger and filled with machinery. Pipes crisscrossed the ceiling, and the walls were lined with monitors, most of them cracked or flickering with static. In the center of the room stood a large metal door, its surface covered in the same strange symbols we’d seen earlier.

Andre stumbled, his face pale. Blood dripped from his arm, leaving a trail behind us.

“She’s still coming!” Kelsey cried, glancing back.

“Help me with this!” Lex shouted, running to the door.

Tony and I joined him, our hands scrambling for a way to open it. The door didn’t have a handle, just a keypad with a faintly glowing screen.

“Shit! What’s the code?” Tony yelled, slamming his fist against the door.

“I don’t know!” Lex shouted back.

Behind us, the sound of Rachael, or whatever she had become, grew louder. Her growls were joined by a strange, metallic clicking noise that made my skin crawl.

“Figure it out, fast!” Kelsey yelled, pulling a knife from her bag and turning to face the tunnel.

Andre, leaning heavily against the wall, pulled the crumpled map of the tunnels from his pocket and shoved it into my hands. “There… might be something,” he said through gritted teeth.

I scanned the map, my hands shaking. The symbols on the door matched something in the corner of the map, a sequence of numbers and letters.

“Try 7C-A43!” I shouted.

Lex punched it in, and for a terrifying moment, nothing happened. Then, with a low hiss, the door slid open, revealing another tunnel bathed in red light.

“Go!” Tony yelled, pulling Andre through.

Kelsey was the last to follow, her knife clutched tightly as she backed toward the door. Rachael’s figure appeared in the distance, her growls growing louder as she moved faster, her body jerking with each step.

Kelsey hesitated for a split second, then bolted through the door. Tony slammed his fist against a button on the other side, and the door slid shut just as Rachael reached it.

The sound of her growls and the metallic clicking didn’t fade. She pounded against the door, the force shaking the ground beneath us, but allowing us a moment to breathe.

Kelsey looked towards Andre “Your hurt,” pulling out a first aid kit “let me help you.

“I’m fine,” Andre said, gasping for air “really.”

“Shut up tough guy,” Tony grabbed some gauze from Kelsey and tightly wrapping around his arm “like you said, we’re in this together.

“We can’t stay here,” Andre said weakly, his face pale.

“We won’t,” I said, glancing down the red-lit tunnel. “But wherever this leads… it might not be any better.”

The others looked at me, their faces filled with fear and exhaustion. No one said anything. We just kept moving, deeper into the unknown.
