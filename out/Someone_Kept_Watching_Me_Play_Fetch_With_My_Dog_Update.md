Hey Everyone,

It's been a busy week, but getting my thoughts together on everything that went on this summer and getting it out there really did make me feel better. Even with how crazy it all was I'm doing better now that I'm settling into my new place. This update has another occurrence that happened near the building and leads up to what caused me to have to sneak inside it at one point. Feel free to let me know your thoughts on it all, will maybe help me feel not so crazy about everything.

Prior to Wiley focusing on the front windows of the building, I did have a run in with someone near it. It was during last fall and I was just playing fetch like usual. Because it was cooler weather I was able to go out a bit earlier, so I took Wiley out on an early Friday after all the cars in the parking lot had gone. I was throwing the ball with my back facing the building and Wiley decided to be ornery and not bring the ball back. I playfully chased after him trying to get the ball back when he focused on the building. I'd heard a door close so I crouched down and had him sit, holding onto his collar so he wouldn't run to whoever it was trying to get pets.

I looked back at the building and was surprised to see someone walking around the side of it to the back. Though their back was facing me, I could tell it was a woman with long red hair and who seemed unnaturally tall. Like, from my perspective she seemed taller than the windows she was walking by. I thought it was weird, and the woman turned back as she was about to round the corner. I caught her eyes and looked down at Wiley, trying not to be awkward. But writing this down I remember how weird that situation was. Especially that I don't remember making out her face at all. I cannot remember any features of it besides her eyes when she looked back at me, which from afar were just black and almost reflective even from far away. I quickly got Wiley back on the leash and left after that, simply so I wouldn't disturb anyone while playing with my dog.

Anyways back to this summer.

The next occurrence was actually that night after the fire exit door had opened. I woke up quite hungover in the middle of the night and sucked down as much water as I could. Drunken me had thankfully left a tall glass of water that was room temp by now near the bed. I downed the first one quickly, and got up to fill it up again, this time with colder water.

I went and used the bathroom, dry heaved a little but gratefully did not need to puke. Washing myself up after, I took some pain relievers and got back in bed. This is when I heard Wiley growling.

I could barely hear it, a soft knock at my apartment door.

I was still slightly delirious, so I told Wiley to quiet down and went to my bedroom door. I threw it open and heard the knocking a bit louder at this point. I stopped as I got closer to the door. It was the middle of the night and someone was being loud banging on my door. I realized the situation and grabbed some scissors sitting on the kitchen counter I had to pass by. The knocking had subsided and I looked through the peephole.

Of course no one was there.

I let my breath out and sighed in relief. I sat the scissors down on the counter and rubbed my eyes. As I was about to step away I thought I could hear something. Breathing. Right outside the door it sounded like someone was breathing right by the peephole. I stayed quiet. I slowly grabbed the scissors and looked back through the peephole.

I hadn't noticed it before, but on the right side of the rounded edge, it was dark. A shape ust outside of view rounded the edge of the peephole, and I thought I could even see a long shadow in the brightly lit hallway of the apartment.

Someone knocked loudly against the door.

I took a step back and the knocking stop. Suddenly, the door to my bedroom slammed shut, with Wiley was barking like crazy from inside the bedroom. I rushed to my bedroom, flipping on the main room light as I went past it. I threw the door open and turned on the light.

Wiley was still barking loudly and shaking about in his kennel. No one was in here. I ran over to the kennel and opened it. He ran like a mad dog out of there. He went to the bathroom, then the living room, and the kitchen barking the whole time. I tried to calm him down, and turned on all the lights in the apartment.

The knocking had stopped, and after a couple of minutes I grew the courage to open the door, all while hiding a claw hammer behind my back.

No one was there.

It took treats and walking every inch of the apartment with him to calm down. Usually he prefers to sleep in the kennel but I let him sleep on the bed with me the rest of that night. I kept the light on in the bedroom and bathroom, but still shut and locked my bedroom door. It took me awhile but I did get some sleep, only after I started to ignore the phantom movements that were imagined in my peripheral vision.

After this, Wiley and I were on edge for a couple of days. Inside the apartment he would snap his head around as if he heard or saw something. I was randomly waking up at night. In my dream there’d be a loud knock or I’d see a figure burst through my bedroom door and jolt awake. I only knew not to worry when I’d look over and see Wiley soundly asleep in his kennel. Surely, if a shadowy figure was inside my apartment he’d be the first to know.

It was about a week of this before we both calmed down. Another week went by and I was able to calmly get some rest once again. I'd been considering moving at that point, but money was tight and I wasn't about to break my lease if I didn't have to. But we were definitely not playing fetch or walking around outside of the apartment complex after that.

Another weekend came up and we had a good Saturday. I took him to walk at the lake, got some food on the way home and gave him plenty of treats when we got back. He was always tired after our long walks so I know he’d be sleeping soundly the rest of the day. Later on I went out to meet with some friends for dinner and put Wiley up.

Dinner was fine, and I told my friends about the craziness going on. They laughed it off, of course as much as I would have if they’d told me the same thing. At one point it devolved into what sort of ghost it was, or if it was simply a perverted old janitor who’d taken a shine to me and my dog. I wasn’t very appreciative of their remarks, but in the moment, I went a long with them and it did cool me off to how wild the whole ordeal had become. The couple of beer pitchers we ordered also helped.

By the time I got home it was dark again and I was in good spirits. I was able to snag a parking spot close to my building, and thought about which video game I was going to play for the night. All my troubles were pushed away until I got to the door of my apartment.

The door was slightly ajar. I stared at it curiously until the realization sat in. I quickly went into my apartment, closing the door quietly behind me. The lights were on and I once again grabbed the scissors on the counter near the door.

No one in the kitchen, no one in the main room. My bedroom door was also ajar, even though I’d left it fully open. I took a couple of breaths and pushed my way into the bedroom door. No one was in hear and a quick glance across the room I saw Wiley's kennel was still closed. I quickly checked my closet and bathroom, throwing back the shower curtain. No one was there. I was confused. Money I'd left on the counter was still there, and any of my electronics that could be pawned hadn't been touched. With realization my stomach suddenly dropped. With my heart  racing, and I ran back into my bedroom and by my bed. The kennel was empty, Wiley was gone.
