 Crickets 

My childhood was set to the sounds of birds cooing and crickets chirping. The low drum of the summer heat and the animals that accompanied it. I found comfort in this cacophony of noise and the blanket of heat that always seemed to surround me.

I spent many a night running around with the neighbor kids. Playing manhunt and swinging on the small playground that accompanied our cul-de-sac. It was bliss. I couldn’t have imagined a better neighborhood to grow up in. The houses were surrounded by woods and creeks that all seemed to run back to the lake in the heart of it all. Nature was everywhere, and as a child I saw deer, snakes, and even wild turkeys roaming around. 

I felt as though I had hit the jackpot. The friends I made down the street soon became my closest confidants. We always seemed to find something to play with or new scenarios to re-enact. It was heaven for a socially-awkward kid like me. 

I was always a curious child. My imagination seemed to always have an other-worldly effect on me. When I wasn’t seeing my friends or digging outdoors I would spend hours inside my own head. Worlds and stories filled with distinct characters. I could be anyone I wanted, and being left to my own devices most of the time, my mind became my second friend. 

Eventually my buddies down the lane noticed my affection for telling tales and my growing imagination. They would beg me to regale them with spooky stories or legends. Now, as a sheltered Christian kid I did not have many scary stories hidden up my sleeve. In fact, I had always strayed from the intense or paranormal. Those stories just seemed more real for me. 

One evening changed everything, and I knew I shouldn’t have told this one fated story, especially since I held a secret none were the wiser to.
 
Ever since I could remember I had a tumultuous relationship with the night. During the day I was a normal child, but at night I would see things, otherworldly things. It was as if the second the lights in my room turned out the projector in my head would start up. No matter how awake or aware I was, I couldn’t escape these oddities and creatures that seemed to swarm around me. Thousands of tiny dots would come together to form things not of this earth. However, I had seen things from this realm, and I knew enough that I hated the feelings they gave me.

I couldn’t escape them in my dreams, nor even by closing my eyes. The few times I had tried to tell my parents they simply dismissed it as a bad dream. It was a bad dream. It had to have been… and before long I had dissociated who I was during the day versus the night.

I was mocked for being sensitive. I couldn’t watch scary movies or even just an intense one. I couldn’t risk seeing them later. Yet here I was being begged by my buddies to tell them a frightening tale. I wanted to please them and give them something to chew on. I wish I hadn’t, for it was too much to digest even for me.

It was odd. The way this story flowed out of me. It’s like I could not stop, and I hadn’t a clue where it came from.

The crickets. I made them listen to the crickets. 

I told them that’s where it lurked. In the sounds that surround you. It’s chilling voice echoing the very noises we had grown up with. A spindly creature with two white glowing eyes that were much too big for its disfigured face. It’s hands long and gangly like the rest of its body. Waiting for the day a child would recognize its disguise. For once you heard the chirping in this new light, it could see you. It could feel you. The fear, the anxiety, the acknowledgment of its existence even. Laying in wait in the summer grass that surrounds us. It was everywhere yet no where, but exactly where you would expect it to be. 

I should have stopped when I’d seen their faces grow more and more anxious, and the regret seep into their eyes.  

I told them there was no turning back. Once said or discovered it was a Pandora’s box violently slammed open. Angry its presence will now be known. 

They told me to stop. They said it was too scary and were concerned I had thought of such a thing in the first place. That’s when the shame crept in. A feeling I was much too familiar with. 

They quickly dismissed themselves to their home right across from the playground. I  however, had more or a hike ahead of me.

I hurriedly walked towards the direction of my home. Suddenly too aware of the crickets chirping and frogs croaking. The heat started to crawl its way up my spine. Only to be replaced by this sinking feeling of eyes upon the nape of my neck. Exposed. I had never felt more exposed. Terror rose in the pit of my stomach and my anxiety couldn’t help but try and clamber out of my body. 

It’s not real. I made it up. Yet… where did it come from? I hadn’t thought of it before, and while I was a good story-teller, even I had to admit this was far past my capabilities. 

The more I thought about this entity. This creature with the whitest eyes and broadest- throatiest grin, with scraggly dark hair that only grew from its chin and maw. The louder the sounds got. Chirping now a deafening hammering in my ears. I felt the sensation of being watched growing, almost festering inside me. 

With my house in sight I broke out into a jog. I was too aware of the summer sounds that swarmed me now. 

Finally inside, the noises dimmed quite a bit. Relief washed over me, but soon replaced with a different kind of anxiety.
My mother stood rigid with a sour expression on her face. She asked me why I hadn’t come home before the street-lights had turned on. I tried to explain me and my buddies got caught up in a tale I had told. She scoffed, not believing such a thing could keep me out past our agreement. 

I desperately wanted to tell her I had messed up. To run to her arms and feel as though everything would be ok, but there was this gnawing feeling I was not normal. I was afraid my mother would think I had done wrong. To be seen as odd or too extreme or let myself indulge in a sinful activity. Viscerally aware of my differences and the fear I already held for the night. I decided to try and sleep and pray the next day would bring brighter feelings.

I was wrong, so wrong. The lights in my room were off within minutes of me clambering into my bed. A familiar ringing filled my ears, and the blackness in front of me now filled with the images and creatures that visited me every night. No matter how unwelcome they were. 

Yet I found relief in the familiarity. These known terrors and hallucinations a greater comfort than what lurked outside. 

I should have thought about anything else. I’m not sure why my mind seemed to always drift back to the chirping. The chirping. It had grown louder and louder even though my windows were always locked shut. Fear crept up my throat, and the familiar sensation of eyes burning into me. I told myself it wasn’t real. It was something I made up. 

That’s when it hit me. What is real to me when my reality is already so blurred? I’d opened my eyes seeking any comfort of my room when I saw a flash of white through my window. Two pale eyes the size of saucers glaring towards me through my foggy glass. I froze. Terrified. 

I don’t know how long it glared at me with its unblinking eyes, and I’m not sure why I couldn’t stop staring back. The chirping screaming in my ears. I tried to look away. I truly did. This wasn’t like my nightly terrors. This one was more real, and able to remain outside the confines of my room which the others had never escaped. 

I wept until it blinked and slowly sunk down out of sight. I immediately turned on my lights and tried to stay awake until the morning. Worried it would return. Luckily it did not that night, however for the foreseeable future I’d slept with my lights on. I bought a noise maker to replace the chirping. 

I never did stay out until the street lamps came on from that point onward.My friends noticed but didn’t seem to question my resistance to breaking my mother’s rules. 

We never talked of that night again, but I swear I would see a slight change in their faces as it grew dimmer, and the summer show of sound started in the background. 

Eventually with age the delusions stopped. I had grown older and wiser, yet I still avoided the chirping. I don’t know if it was real, nor if anything I’d experienced was.

That was until I saw a missing persons poster in the local supermarket. A face that seemed eerily familiar. Age had done them in but even I could make out the faint smile lines of the friend I once knew. 

My gut sank, and my hands turned sweaty. This guilty feeling arose in my chest once more. I knew. I knew it was my fault. I shouldn’t have told them that story that night. 

The chirping returned with a vicious vengeance. It consumed my thoughts.

The chirping.

The chirping. 

The chirping 

Can’t you hear it? 

It grows quiter for me now

I’m so sorry 

But it will now grow louder for you
