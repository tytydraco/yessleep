I woke up in the dark, gag in my mouth, the sick stench of chloroform twisting my stomach.

I was lying in what looked like a basement, only a thin crack of light coming through, everything old and damp.

Even through the haze, I recognized the figure in front of me as the Uber driver who had picked me up from home. Tall man, broad shoulders, long jaw.

The first thing out of my mouth when he took the gag off was, *what do you want from me?*

“I just need to keep you here,” he said, voice shaky, uneven. “Pan made me. Don’t blame me, Ms. Sarah. Please.”

Tears streamed down his face. Before I could ask another question, he slammed the heavy metal door shut, locking me in.

That first week, every time he came down with food or swapped out the bucket, I begged him to let me go.

He never answered, just gave me that sad look, sometimes even crying. His arms and neck had fresh wounds, ones I figured he’d done to himself.

Every night I heard him upstairs, yelling at no one, banging the walls. It was clear something in his mind was broken.

By the second week, I tried getting through to the part of him that pitied me. He didn’t look at me with hate, more like he was stuck in something he couldn’t control.

I told him I’d forget about the kidnapping. That I’d visit, talk to him, help him figure out what he was going through.

He thanked me but said it wasn’t possible. Pan, the voice in his head, was in love with me. Pan wanted me close, and if he disobeyed, he’d be punished.

I asked him how long would it take, and he said he didn’t know. 

When I pressed for more about this Pan, he pulled away. I caught sight of the scratches on his arms as he stood. He muttered an apology through tears and left me alone again.

That’s when I knew I couldn’t count on his pity. His madness could kill me at any moment.

I was small, weak, no match for him physically. But I had to try.

In the third week, I faked a sharp pain in my stomach. My plan was to act like I had appendicitis.

Hearing my screams, he rushed down to check on me.

He asked to see my stomach. I let him lean close. When his head was near enough, I swung the hammer I had hidden away after he had let me use his bathroom for a shower.

The first hit barely fazed him. He froze, eyes wide with shock. I swung again, same spot. This time he collapsed, screaming, clutching his head.

It was my chance. I bolted for the door, slammed it shut, and locked him inside. His muffled cries echoed behind me.

Night was falling. His house was a creaky old cabin, dim lights, rotting wood.

On my way out, I understood the noises I’d heard every night. The walls were carved with symbols, marks I couldn’t make sense of. What I did notice was the red everywhere.

My hand was already on the doorknob to the front door when I heard a strange bleat. I turned and saw… a goat standing there in the living room.

He was white and black. It didn’t move. Just stared at me, like it knew something I didn’t. Every now and then it let out another weak cry.

His eyes locked on mine so intensely I felt almost hypnotized by that animal, staring back for a few seconds.

What snapped me out of it was when he suddenly rose on his front legs and began what I can only describe as a grotesque metamorphosis. Something I’ll never get out of my head.

His body twisted, his hooves stretched and reshaped into arms, his torso shifting as he screamed. Not an animal’s cry, but the sound of someone trapped in unbearable pain.

That was when panic finally hit me. I bolted through the house and out the door, sprinting down the dirt road in pure desperation until I reached a busy street, where a family stopped their car and called the police.

\*\*\*

That same night, three patrol cars went out to the cabin. The goat was nowhere to be found.

All they discovered was the man who had kept me prisoner. His body was torn apart, his insides scattered across the basement where I had locked him.

No investigator ever explained how that happened.

As for me, I’m trying to live my life again. I’m in therapy, on meds to handle the panic attacks that came after it all.

But the hardest part is still sleeping. Every night I wake up, sweating, [haunted by that scream.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Accomplished_Low7889/)
