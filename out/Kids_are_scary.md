I was on the road for around three hours before I decided to stop somewhere and grab a bite to eat. I was always told to try to take breaks on long car rides because of the dangers of falling asleep at the wheel. A sign for an upcoming exit blurred past the passenger window.  I didn’t want fast food; it would only make me feel bloated and miserable for the next stretch of the drive. Sometimes, even the smallest bits of service and hospitality of a diner can provide a sense of satisfaction that fast food just doesn’t relate to. Even if it’s the server's job, I still like the attention. I took the exit, slowing down, observing the restaurants listed on the signs.

The town was small. No large businesses to be seen; it was all local and rural. There weren’t any nice new cars parked on the side of the street either. Instead, it was mostly trucks meant for working and older, beat-up junkers that looked like they struggled to even get started. All the buildings lined up neatly, made of brick. Old.

I saw a group of kids laughing and jeering at each other outside of one of the stores. I smiled, thinking about how I used to play with my friends on the dirt mounds of our still-developing neighborhood. It felt like a million years ago. The diner is what I decided on. There really wasn’t anything else around, anyway; breakfast food is good at any time of the day.

I parked next to a red Chevy truck. It was stained with rust and dirt.

I got out and headed into the diner, glancing at the kids again before hearing the dangling bells when opening the door to the diner.

“Welcome in!” A pleasant voice rang out. She was a lot older than me and had bright red lipstick smeared on her lips.  She could have been everyone’s grandma.

I smiled, grabbed a menu, and sat in a booth with a view of the street and old vehicles that lined it. I hadn’t realized how hot it was outside until I felt the AC on my neck, snaking down my back, giving me a chill.

There was soft music playing. I couldn't make out the song, but it was nice and familiar. This town felt like I’d lived here my whole life.

The server approached, and my eyes were drawn straight to her mouth. So red. Wrinkled. Her voice drew me out of my trance. “What can I get for you, darling?” It felt genuine. Like she really wanted to help me. “Just a coffee for now, please,” I replied.

She nodded and wrote it down with her blue pen on her yellow notepad.

“Cream or sugar with that honey?”

“Just black, please,” I replied.

She smiled again and made eye contact before walking away to retrieve it.

I looked down at the menu. It was the same as any diner across the country. Eggs, bacon, grits, biscuits and gravy, etc. There were even milkshakes for dessert.

While I was still scanning the menu for something to fill my stomach, there was movement outside the windows. The group of kids had moved their way down the street, still laughing and jostling around with one another.

One of the kids was older than the rest. He looked to be the happiest. He was grinning ear to ear, and his teeth were glaringly white. One of the smaller kids in the group saw me staring and waved at me. I smiled and waved back.

What happened after that didn’t quite register in my mind.

The group of about seven boys then circled that small boy and joined hands. They still looked joyful, like they were playing around. They began spinning counterclockwise. Picking up the pace with every revolution.

I was confused but accepted it and looked back down at my menu.

The laughing grew louder and louder. It was childish belly laughter as if someone had just said the funniest thing in the world.

I glanced up again with a hint of a smile, the laughter almost contagious. 

That smile dropped just as quickly.

The boy who had waved to me was on the ground now. Lying on his side, looking at me with bright eyes and a sad grin on his face. I noticed the red and silver. A knife buried to the hilt in his gut, a growing pool of blood. Shock overcame me, and my jaw dropped. I hadn’t realized I wasn’t breathing.

The children continued spinning, except the older boy, who had stepped out. Still looking excited as if he had just won some kind of game. My eyes drooped back down to the young victim whose expression had yet to change. Still staring. Still grinning.

I heard a different kind of laughter now. The older boy was now pointing directly at me. He was laughing so hard it was like he was gasping for breath. The other boys followed suit, and the roar grew louder. My eyes sank back to the little boy who was now shockingly pointing and laughing, too. I could see the knife bouncing up and down while it was still perforating his gut.

The waitress returned, and I expected her to scream at the horror unfolding outside the restaurant in plain view. Instead, she just laughed, put a hand on my shoulder like I was an old friend, and said, “Oh, kids these days!” “Are you ready to order?”
