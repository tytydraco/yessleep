I don’t really watch TV anymore.  
Not after what happened.

It started when I moved into the old unit above the laundromat. Rent was cheap, too cheap but I told myself I’d make it work. I was between jobs, still trying to shake off a bad breakup, and the thought of living alone appealed to me. I didn’t mind the faint hum of dryers below or the flickering lights in the hallway. It was quiet up there, almost peaceful.

Almost.

There was an old CRT television sitting in the corner of the living room when I moved in. One of those chunky ones with static dials and a woodgrain frame. I didn’t own a TV, so I decided to keep it. The landlord said it was left behind years ago, and it didn’t work anyway.

But on my first night, as I was unpacking, I heard something.  
A soft crackle.

When I turned around, the TV was on—glowing faintly with gray static.

I figured maybe the power surge did it. I unplugged the cable cord, but the static didn’t go away. I actually had to pull the plug from the wall to make it stop.

That was strange, sure, but I laughed it off. Old wiring, maybe.  
Old building.  
Old me trying not to care.

The next night, though, it happened again.

Only this time, when I turned toward the screen, I thought I saw something moving through the static.

Not clearly.  
Just a vague outline—like a tall shape shifting behind a fogged window.

I stared for maybe thirty seconds, then pulled the plug again. I told myself it was my imagination. My ex used to tease me for overanalyzing everything.  
“Not every shadow’s got teeth,” she’d say.

But that night, when I went to bed, the sound followed me.  
Soft, distant static. Coming from somewhere in the apartment.

 

By the third day, I was ready to get rid of it.  
I dragged the TV toward the door, but it was heavier than it looked. I ended up leaving it near the wall, planning to call the landlord later.

That night, I woke up around 3 a.m.

The static was louder now—muffled, but constant. I stumbled into the living room, half-asleep.

The TV was on again.

Only this time, there wasn’t any static.

The screen was pure black.  
But in the reflection, I saw myself standing there.

And behind me—someone else.

I spun around, heart pounding. No one was there. When I looked back, the reflection showed only me again.

I didn’t sleep that night.

 

The next morning, I went to the pawn shop down the road. The owner, an old guy named Vince, said he’d take the TV off my hands for twenty bucks. I didn’t even care about the money—I just wanted it gone.

As he lifted it onto the counter, he squinted at the glass screen.  
“Man,” he muttered, “you sure this thing works? Feels warm.”

“Yeah,” I said quickly. “Just take it.”

He shrugged and gave me a receipt.

That night, my apartment was finally quiet. I poured myself a drink and put on some music, trying to unwind.

Then, sometime past midnight, I heard that sound again.

A soft hiss.

Like static.

I froze. The TV was gone. There was no screen left to blame it on.

The noise was coming from the wall.

 

I pressed my ear to it—just drywall and paint separating me from the unit next door. It sounded like faint whispers, layered under the static hum.

I banged on the wall. “Hello?”

No response. But the sound stopped.

For about five seconds.

Then a voice came through—crackly, distant, and low:

“You shouldn’t have given me away.”

I stumbled backward, knocking over my drink. The voice had come from inside the wall.

I called the landlord the next morning, demanding to know who lived next door. She told me the unit had been empty for years.

I didn’t argue—I just hung up.

 

By the fifth night, I was barely sleeping. Every sound felt like it came from the static. I even started unplugging every electronic I owned—router, phone charger, even the smoke alarm. I sat in the dark and waited.

At 2:47 a.m., my phone buzzed.

The screen flickered.  
And then the static started playing again from my phone speaker this time.

A faint image began forming across the glass it was too pixelated to make out at first. Then clearer.

A face.

Not just an face my face.

Except the eyes were wrong they were dark and wide.

And behind my reflection, barely visible, the same tall shape I’d seen in the TV static stood there, motionless.

I threw the phone across the room. It hit the wall, screen shattering.

But even through the cracked glass, I could see the faint glow of static still pulsing underneath.

 

That morning, I went back to the pawn shop.  
Vince wasn’t there.

The clerk told me Vince hadn’t shown up for work in two days. When I asked about the TV, she frowned.

“What TV?” she said.

I told her I’d sold him one—an old CRT, wood paneling, broken dials.

She shook her head. “We don’t take those anymore. Haven’t for years.”

 

I started packing that night. I didn’t care about the deposit; I just needed out.

While taping up a box, I heard something faint—like a hum from inside the power socket. I crouched down. The plug holes were dark, but the sound was there—soft static, rising and falling.

Then a whisper slipped through.

“Don’t turn away this time.”

The lights flickered.

The air felt heavy.

And before I could even stand up, the screen on my broken phone lit up again across the room—showing that same black void, that same tall figure.

But this time, he wasn’t in the background.

He was right behind *me.*

 

I woke up on the floor hours later. Morning light spilled through the blinds.

Everything was quiet again. My heart still felt like it was trying to climb out of my chest. I checked my phone—it was fried, the screen was completely black.

I told myself I’d imagined it. Stress, exhaustion, maybe some carbon monoxide leak. Anything but what I’d seen.

But then I noticed something carved into the wall near the socket.

Letters, jagged and uneven.

“LOOK WHEN IT BUZZES.”

 

I moved out that afternoon. Left the boxes, the furniture, everything.

The landlord didn’t ask questions when I dropped off the keys. She looked tired, like she’d seen this before.

After that I ended up crashing with a friend for a few weeks. I Tried my hardest to forget. Got a new phone, new job, new place. Life moved on.

Until last night.

I was half-asleep when the new TV in my apartment flickered.  
Just for a second—then back to normal.

But before it changed back, I swear I saw it.  
A black screen.  
A reflection.  
And over my shoulder—something moving.

Something tall.

Something smiling.
