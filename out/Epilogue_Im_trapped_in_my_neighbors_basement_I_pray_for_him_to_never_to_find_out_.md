Hello, reddit community! I am OP's mother. I've never used Reddit before; this will be my first time.

 A friend of mine came across this post and felt compelled to tell me about it. My daughter (who we'll call Tara, not her real name), never told me anything about what occurred, which troubled me a lot because she'd been missing for almost a year.

 She refused to speak with the police, her therapist, her friends, and even us. It was nevertheless alarming to see that she had given a detailed post of her kidnapping on an app full of strangers. I just want to say that last year was the saddest period of our lives. I just want to express that that year was the saddest period of our life. I can't express the terror, powerlessness and anguish I felt about not being able to protect and console my baby in those times of terror. 

I couldn't stop blaming myself, and reading the post only made me blame myself more. This may sound horrible, but there were nights when I wished she had died rather than suffered. The only thing worse than losing a kid is knowing she is suffering and you can do nothing about it.

 I couldn't sleep because my dreams were filled with the awful things that could happen to my baby. When police found her, I was relieved but also heartbroken. She was all bones and emptiness, her eyes a void without end.

 Even though she had thousands of relapses, sleepless nights, nightmares, and trauma during her difficult recovery, I was there for her in every step of the way.

I cried when she begged me to let her go, to die , but I found it impossible. I was afraid of losing her. Every day I felt that if something ever happened to her again, I would never be able to live with myself.

She didn't eat anything at all on some days, and she ate everything she saw on others. She has never been able to sleep alone since then. She had also developed  a severe fear of being by herself or in any dark room

 She is currently enrolled in online classes because she doesn't feel like going out, and she strongly refuses to stop studying. She is also back in therapy, but it doesn't appear to be doing any good so far. 

Every night, she cryes herself to sleep, and I feel unable to help her.

 I believe those posts to be the reason she has been spending days in her room with her phone for the past week. I'm glad she was able to finally share all of that experience. We had a very touching conversation yesterday, and I think this may be the  first big step in both her and our family's recovery. 

Finally, despite  not sure whether I can tell you everything, I think you should know. Before the cops arrived, the kidnapper and her son both passed away. Tim, the son, has been found guilty of the rape and Murder of more than fifty people, most of whom are young adults with some expetions like my daughter, anither couple of teens and a 5 year old year. 

It seems that his mother assisted him in hiding his whereabouts and assisting in most of kidnappings. It's unbelievable that there are so sick qnd troubled people in the world. 

Sadly, we're not sure how much my daughter was heard, and I'm afraid to find out. Though things are beginning to improve, I would really appreciate some guidance since I'm currently starting to feel very lost.

 If you've made it this far, thank you so much. My daughter would really appreciate it ❤️
