This post will get immediately taken down if I reveal the locations of the incident and the locations related to it, so I would refrain from doing that.

All of the readers here, if you have ever moved to a new place, and you had to go to a new school, most of you just wanted to fit in, didn't you? Sure exceptions are everywhere, but most of you did. Some would have been just too shy and would have been reserved, and some of you might have amazing at socializing. It would be easy for you to make new friends.

I, like most people, was at the middle. When I switched places because of my father's transfer, it was really awkward at first on the school. But, one thing about me(which I am not bragging about) was that I had good levels of confidence. Like if I had a speech to give in front of a 1000 people, sure, my hands would tremble, my legs would shake, but still, I would be able to give it.

Same was with me making friends. I was screaming and cursing at myself in my mind for every little mistake that I did, but outside I was as calm as a rock. Gradually, I got into the group of my class.

The problem starts here : I was not the only transfer student here.

For confidential reasons, we will call him X.

On like day 2, my socializing had become good. I was having casual conversations with everyone. It was going quite amazing.

But X . . .

The problem was he just seemed off downright creepy.

Like there was just something wrong with him.

And his ugliness did not really help him. And for some reason, he had to smile all the time. Did he really think that was helping him?

But by the end of the day, X realized something : Nobody liked him.

Looks play a major role in our society and if you lack them . . . well, life ain't so easy for you.

For X, it was the same. He didn't even look average. He was ugly, compared to all of us. Along with this he had those high-numbered spectacles.

At the 3rd day, I had finally become friends with most of the people in my class. I was good at describing incidents of my past school and mind you, they were funny. Everyone was laughing at my jokes, even the most beautiful girl in class. The recess was going good.

And then, just by coincidence, I saw X.

He was eating his food, but those eyes were just staring at me.

Just staring.

He was eating his food almost in a mechanical order, as if he was taught, this is how humans eat and was following it step by step.

But he was looking at me. Unblinking. Unwavering.

It sent a shiver down my spine and I choked on my food.

When I looked up again, X wasn't there. Maybe he had gone off to the washroom.

It wasn't that I had sabotaged him on purpose. He had tried talking with everyone, he had tried telling jokes . . . it was just that nobody wanted to be with him. Nobody did. He just gave off that creepy aura.

Imagine, you are playing a game. You and a guy start off at the same position, but somehow, the game gives the other guy an advantage for no reason and he starts winning. Won't that guy become your opponent? Won't you try to **eliminate** him?

From that day on, I became the opponent of X.

A week later or so, I was going to the washroom. There were open toilets in our bathrooms and then there were the closed doors ones. I always preferred the closed ones. There is a thing such as privacy.

So, I was in there, doing my thing and suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

"Occupied", I replied.

*KNOCK*

"Hey, its occu---", I never got to complete that sentence.

Suddenly, a hand grabbed my throat from behind. A black, rough, charred hand, as though it was burnt.

I was shocked at first and then I tried to struggle my way out, but the grip only got tighter.

Instantly, I was losing my breath, the world was spinning around me, getting darker and darker and darker.

And in between this, I was hearing soft laugh, chuckles. Whatever **it** was, **it** was enjoying this. Hearing me struggle and choke was giving **it** immense pleasure.

The last thing I remembered, was that I saw the hand coming from above the toilet door, not through it.

And then suddenly, my alarm went off.

I don't know when or how I had scheduled that alarm. Maybe it was out of habit. But I make sure that each time I set an alarm, I put in the worst possible ringtone, so that I immediately acknowledge it.

That is what saved me that day. A fucking alarm.

The alarm went off and suddenly, it let go of my throat, making unnatural noises and then I guess, it went away, as fast as it could.

5 minutes later, I woke up, by the sounds of the janitor banging the door.

As I got out the washroom, after being scolded, I was terrified as fuck, my whole body trembling. But I understood one thing and it sent a shiver down my spine.

There was **something** in this school and that **something** wanted to kill me.

And I had pretty good guess of who it could be.
