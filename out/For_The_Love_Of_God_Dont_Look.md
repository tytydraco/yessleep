[(Pt 2) I Shouldn't Have Looked ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/UmMAEavl6f)

Update: 1:44 p.m. Oct 9th. I must have collapsed from exhaustion. Somewhere along the path Jacob and I had made by tying markers to branches and such I completely lost consciousness. Then a nightmare ensued.

It didn't start out as such, it was actually one of those types of dreams in which you are at a point in your past. Of course it never plays out the exact same but it is more of the nostalgia than anything.

I dreamt of me and Jacob as young, dumb 12 year olds. Riding bikes through the woods near our neighborhood with a few other friends, including his girlfriend and mine. A pack of cigarettes tucked in Jacob's backpack. 

I remember their faces, smiling, cracking jokes and giving each other shit sitting at our hangout. I said nothing, I just watched them banter back and forth at one another. Then something changed.

All the sound stopped momentarily, and then the trees around us started to shift an coil, slowly moving away from us. Looking up, the sky darkened as thick black clouds moved in from each direction, eventually meeting to a swirling mass of darkness, of which we were dead center.

As I looked back at my friends they were silent, sitting completely still as if they were freeze framed. And that's when I realized that the trees has formed a circular clearing, one that I was familiar with. We were sitting in the center, right where the dilapidated shack had been. They were all staring at me 

At the edge of the clearing I saw everyone I know, staring at me the same. There was one face that stood out. Mine... My normal grownup self, walking towards me. But as he... I got closer, the face morphed into the same horrific face I'd seen since this all began.

The sound of the swirling black clouds became more prominent, all that could be heard is the wind and the ground beneath us shaking. Suddenly I noticed a red color cascading from the sky. 

As I looked up, I saw what I could only describe as the sky opening up within the encircling clouds. And with it revealed a vortex of red and swirling fire.  The ground beneath me rumbled and shook. 

The demonic version of myself was now standing in the middle of the circle, glaring at me with those impossibly horrific eyes, and the impossibly haunting smile revealing the familiar needle-like teeth.

The wind grew stronger as I then recognized the screams of everyone else that were present within this utter pandemonium. To my immediate horror, everyone except for myself, and the abomination standing before me were being pulled into the fiery vortex like a black hole. The only ones that weren't affected were me, and the thing in front of me. 

I could see the pleasure in it's face as it reveled in joy while listening to everyone I held close, screaming for my help. And there I was, completely incapable of doing anything to stop it. That's when the anger kicked in. 

My fear gave way to a sense of infuriation beyond anything I've ever felt. I stood and walked within inches of the ugly fucking distortion of my own face, to the point of my face almost touching his. 

I screamed in it's face with every ounce of animosity I'd ever had. And then I swore to it's hideous face, I wouldn't let it win. The smile disappeared, replaced by more evil than any human could even come close to feeling or witness. That's when I was suddenly conscious again.

I was standing directly in front of the latch that led to the corridor where it all started. I don't know why, or how, but I knew that something about being here was where I was supposed to be.

I walked down the dark corridor with the light of my phone to guide me. When I finally reached the end, for some reason I wasn't surprised at all at what I saw. An old chair, only completely empty, devoid of a corpse, and there was no bag that held anything. No. The old burlap sack sat empty in the chair.

I know what I have to do. I haven't eaten in days, nor have I drank any water. I feel so diminished and consumed. I was exhausted beyond measure. This chair has to be my resting place. I have to do this for the sake of everyone I love.

This is my last chance to give anyone who might read this a warning. If you happen to come across a peculiar clearing, with strange ornamental bones hanging from trees, an old dilapidated wooden shack, within which is a latch leading down to a long dark corridor, and find yourself in the presence of a corpse, surrounded by even more bones of a nondescript nature. You'll find an ancient looking burlap sack, which seems to have something inside... For the love of any deity you might believe in, please... DO... NOT... LOOK. 

I'm tired now, so tired. I need to sit down.
