The recollection of events is from memory. These events are not on any news source and any articles which have published these events have been silenced. The FBI and CIA still don’t understand how this took place so I will attempt to share the events as best as I can.

My friends and I decided to take a trip. We wanted to do something interesting as most of the trips we’ve previously taken were popular tourist destinations. We thought about it and after some consideration we decided to camp in the Amazon Rainforest. Little did I know this would be the worst decision of my life. The day before we departed we packed all the essentials you’d expect. Camping equipment, tents, flashlights, lanterns, and other things that may be useful. 

We departed the next day but I had an eerie feeling we were heading straight into the hands of danger. Some people in our friend group that we usually travel with were unable to come. This caused the group to be smaller than usual. The friends that were able to come were my good friend Twan, Ella, and my homeboy Bashir. We were driving for a couple hours, singing road trip songs, playing eye spy, classic things you’d expect on a good ol-road trip. 

Bashir was driving since he was the only one with an international license. We arrived at one end of the rainforest, the end that connects civilization with nature. There was a fence guarding the area which we were at. “Strange,” Twan said as he jumped the fence. “Bro what are you doing,” I said surprised. Twan looked at us and just decided to come back, “Let’s try the other side,” he said. We got back into the car and we drove a couple miles to another side we could enter from. We hopped out and entered the rainforest. 

We walked for a while. I’m convinced it was about five to six hours of constant walking. I was bitten by hundreds of little insects and my leg was beginning to get itchy. We continued to walk and finally reached the spot we would camp at. “OH MY GOD!” Ella screamed. We looked at her, confused. “What the hell don’t scream like that,” Bashir stated firmly. “I FORGOT THE SECOND TENT!” Ella yelled again. “There’s no way,” Twan said, annoyed. “Bro how do you forget an entire tent,” I said, pestering her. “Guy’s it’s alright the tent is pretty big,” Bashir stated. “Oh yeah the tent is huge! Bro do you hear yourself, how are we gonna fit four people in one tent,” I said frustrated. 

We didn’t really have a choice and we would have to do another 10 to 12 hours of walking just to get the tent. We decided to just cram in the one we currently had. It wasn’t terribly small. The tent was about eight by six. Four of us could possibly fit but it wouldn’t be comfortable. The night was quickly approaching and we had quickly got to what we wanted to do before we slept.

We started a fire and roasted some marshmallows. We began to tell some scary stories because, why not? Perfect place to tell scary stories. Dark rainforest, campfire, sitting with friends. Bashir wanted to tell one first, “In a dark rainfore-” before he finished the word we heard whooshing in the jungle. “What was that?” Ella asked. “Just the wind I guess,” Twan stated. We heard the sound for another minute or two. We began to get worried as it could have been a bear or some sort of wild animal. We were far too wrong. Right after the sound stopped we saw a shadowy figure behind two trees. It disappeared a couple seconds after we looked at it.

“Uhh did anyone else see that?” I asked. “Yeah… guys let’s go inside the tent,” Twan stated. I knew this trip was a terrible idea from the start. Now we had to deal with the consequences of coming into a random part of a huge rainforest. We huddled up in the tent. The sleeping bags felt cold… Or maybe it was the cold sweat that broke out. I was terrified of what could be out there.


“Ah I think we would be more comfortable if you didn’t forget the tent… ELLA,” I said while shivering from fear, or perhaps I was shivering from the cold. Ella glared at me and after a while decided to go to sleep. It was only me, Twan, and Bashier that were awake now. 

We heard the same whooshing from before. “Woosh”. It’s back. Ella instantly woke up, terrified as if she woke up from a nightmare. We didn’t know what to do so we all just decided to turn off the lantern and attempt to sleep. I woke up but it was still dark outside. With a groggy voice I said to myself, “Where am I.” I realized I was still in the tent but something was off. It was more spacious. I felt around and noticed the lantern. I flicked it on and pointed it forward. “What the…” Nobody was in the tent. We were four but now I was the only one there. “Maybe they’re outside,” I thought to myself. I stepped outside but it was pouring rain. We placed a tarp over the tent so we wouldn’t get wet. I checked the time on my phone and it was currently 2 am.

I noticed that it was impossible for them to be outside right now and I would have noticed if they left while sleeping since I’m a pretty light sleeper. I sat to myself and wondered why they would randomly leave. The last time I checked my phone was before I slept. If I remember correctly it was around 10 pm. This means in the span of four hours, somehow they were gone. I just wanted to sleep and wake up in my own bed and escape this nightmare. I knew it was going to be a long day tomorrow. I decided the best option was just to sleep and face whatever I was going to face the next day.
