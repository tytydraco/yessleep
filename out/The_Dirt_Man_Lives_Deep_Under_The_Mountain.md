In the remote town of Crestvail, nestled deep within the formidable embrace of the Black Ridge Mountains, a legend lurked, one that even the hardiest of souls dared not utter above a mere whisper; The legend of The Dirt Man

Beneath the towering peaks, where the earth's crust groaned and shifted under the immense pressure of countless eons, lay a labyrinthine network of forgotten tunnels and caverns. A sinister maze of darkness snaked its way into the very heart of the mountain, a domain where only the bravest dared to tread. It was within these desolate and forsaken depths that the Dirt Man made his accursed abode.

Forged from the twisted bowels of the earth itself, the Dirt Man was a creature born of nightmares, a grotesque entity whose very existence stood as an affront to the capricious whims of fate. His form, a monstrous amalgamation of decomposed flesh and withered bone, seemed to pulse and writhe with an unnatural life of its own, as if he were an extension of the very mountain that birthed him.

Few dared to venture into the stygian depths where he dwelled, for those who did were said to vanish without a trace, consumed by the insatiable earth that was his domain . The mere mention of his name sent scalding acid down the spines of even the bravest souls, and his legend cast a long shadow over the beleaguered town of Crestvail.

Legends spoke of the Dirt Man's origins, whispered in hushed tones around flickering hearths and over tankards of ale in dimly lit taverns. Some claimed he was the vengeful spirit of a miner who had perished in a cave-in, his soul forever bound to the depths of the mountain. Others spoke of a dark pact made with ancient forces within the earth, a bargain sealed in blood and darkness that cursed him to roam the tunnels for all eternity.

Regardless of his origins, one thing remained certain – the Dirt Man was not to be trifled with. His presence was a harbinger of fate, a vestigial reflection of the perils lurking just beneath our own shadows. And for if the Black Ridge Mountains stood sentinel over the land, his legend would endure, a cautionary tale for those who dared to tempt fate in the darkness below.

On an ill-fated evening, a motley crew of travelers, their weather-beaten faces etched with the harsh lines of countless journeys, stumbled upon the yawning maw of a cavern’s entrance. Among them strode Jack, a seasoned adventurer whose rugged demeanor belied a fierce resolve. Leading the group into the unknown depths with an air of reckless abandon, they sought respite from the biting chill that gnawed at their bones, their minds consumed by thoughts of shelter and warmth.

With torches ablaze, casting flickering shadows against the cold stone, they descended into the abyss of the mountain’s bowels. Their footsteps echoed through the cavernous expanse and the air grew thick and heavy, saturated with the unmistakable scent of decay and damp earth – a tangible foreshadowing of the perils that lay in wait beneath the mountain's ancient veil.

Then they felt it – a primal instinct, a creeping sense of dread twisting like a serpent in the pit of their stomachs. A low, rumbling growl reverberated through the darkness, sending shivers racing down their spines like icy tendrils. From the inky depths quickly emerged the dreaded Dirt Man, his eyes burning with a malevolence that pierced the very heart of their souls, a silent herald of the horrors yet to come.

His presence was suffocating, a palpable singularity pressing down upon them mercilessly, filling the cavern with an oppressive aura of helplessness. Jack and his companions stood frozen in terror, their minds reeling as they struggled to comprehend the grotesque apparition before them. The Dirt Man was a twisted demon of earth and flesh, his jagged features contorted into a twisted mask of primal rage and anguish.

With a guttural roar that reverberated through the cavern like the rumble of an avalanche, the Dirt Man lurched forward, his movements jagged and erratic . Jack and his companions scrambled frantically, their weapons jerking up in a desperate bid to fend off the encroaching terror, their movements rough and uncoordinated in the face of their own massacre.

The Dirt Man was relentless, his strength far surpassing that of mortal men. With a swipe of his gnarled hand, he sent Jack sprawling across the cavern, his body slamming against the unforgiving stone with a sickening dampened thud. The other travelers fared no better, their cries of fear and mercy drowned out by the cacophony of their ending.

As the last echoes of their screams faded into oblivion, the cavern fell silent once more, the only sound left was the ragged breath of the Dirt Man as he surveyed the devastation he had wrought. And as he retreated into the shadows, his malevolent laughter echoed through the darkness, a sound made to match the terror that lurked beneath the mountain's ancient facade.

In the town of Crestvail, where the Black Ridge Mountains loomed like silent guardians and the shadows held sway, the legend of the Dirt Man lived on, an aubade to a sinister darkness lurking beneath the surface of the earth, waiting patiently for the next unsuspecting soul to leave a little dirt under their pillow.

  
\*\*\*

My name is Carter, and I've always considered myself a pragmatic man. A father of two young girls, I've learned to navigate life's challenges with a sense of steadfast resolve. But there are some things in this world that defy logic, that elude rational explanation. And it was one such inexplicable event that would forever alter the course of my life.

Growing up in Crestvail, a small town nestled in the shadow of the Black Ridge Mountains, I had always been drawn to the rugged beauty of the landscape. The towering peaks seemed to stand as silent sentinels, guarding over the town with an air of ancient wisdom. As a child, I would often spend hours exploring the dense forests and winding trails that crisscrossed the mountainside, my imagination fueled by the countless tales of adventure and mystery.

As I grew older, I found myself settling into the familiar rhythms of small-town life, content to carve out a simple existence for myself and my family. My wife, Sarah, shared my love for the town and its people, and together we had built a life filled with love and laughter. Our daughters, Lily and Emily, brought boundless joy into our lives, their laughter echoing through the halls of our modest home like music to our ears.

But beneath the surface of tranquility of Crestvail, there lurked a darkness that few dared to acknowledge. Legends whispered of a wretched force that haunted the mountains, a creature born from the depths of the rotted earth itself - the Dirt Man. As a child, I had listened wide-eyed to the tales spun by the town elders, my imagination running wild with visions of monstrous creatures lurking in the shadows.

I soon dismissed these stories as nothing more than fanciful tales spun to frighten children into obedience. After all, in the light of day, the mountains seemed no more menacing than the gentle rolling hills of the countryside. As the years passed and the whispers of the Dirt Man faded into the background, a sense of unease began to settle over the town like a thick fog.

Rumors spread like wildfire through the streets, tales of disappearances and strange sightings in the dead of night. People spoke in hushed tones of pets that had ventured into the mountains and never returned, their fates forever buried. And though I tried to dismiss these stories as nothing more than idle gossip, I couldn't shake the growing feeling that there was something wrong with the mountains then.

As the whispers of the Dirt Man's presence grew, I found myself increasingly drawn to the history of Crestvail, my curiosity regrettably piqued by the tales of an ancient evil dwelling in the mountains. I began to spend hours poring over old maps and dusty tomes, searching for anything that might shed more details on The Dirt Man. That’s where I learned about the story of Jack.

But the more I delved into the town's dark past, the more I began to realize that some secrets were better left buried. The stories I uncovered regaled tales of unspeakable horrors, of dark rituals and forbidden pacts made in the underbelly of the forest. And at the center of it all loomed the figure, the monstrous legend, The Dirt Man.  
  
He has only ever been seen at night, and has been sighted over the decades around the base of the mountains.  I knew where to find him.

Despite the warnings of my wife and the pleading of my daughters, I became consumed by an insatiable desire to uncover the truth, an uncharacteristic obsession was born within me. I knew the risks of venturing into the mountains alone, but I thought I was willing to risk everything in pursuit of the answers I so desperately sought. Why was I so stupid?

And so it was on that fateful day, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the shadows lengthened across the landscape, that I found myself standing on the precipice of the unknown.

I set out into the mountains, my heart pounding in my chest as I navigated the treacherous terrain. The darkness seemed to close in around me, swallowing me whole as I plunged deeper into the heart of the wilderness.

The forest was eerily silent, the usual sounds of nocturnal creatures conspicuously absent. Each step seemed to echo unnaturally, amplifying my growing unease. As I moved further into the dense underbrush, a thick fog began to roll in, curling around the trees like ghostly fingers. The air grew colder, carrying with it the faint, acrid scent of decay.

My flashlight flickered, casting sporadic beams of light that barely penetrated the suffocating gloom. I felt eyes upon me, an unsettling sensation that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. Whispers seemed to dance on the edge of my hearing, erratic and unpredictable. Present, but unable to be focused on.  
  
Pushing through the tangles of weeds and thorned vines, I stumbled upon an old, dilapidated cabin, half-hidden by the encroaching vegetation. The sharp thorns clawed at my skin, leaving stinging scratches on my arms. I grew up in these woods, and I’ve never seen the hut before.  
  
The windows were shattered, shards of glass glinting in the faint light, and the door hung loosely on its hinges, creaking eerily in the faint breeze.

Inside, the remnants of a past life lay scattered: broken furniture covered in dust and cobwebs, rotting books with pages curling and yellowed, and tattered clothing that disintegrated at the slightest touch. The air was thick with the musty scent of decay, mingling with the earthy aroma of damp soil and rotting wood. The floorboards groaned under my weight, threatening to give way with every step.  
  
The silence was punctuated by the occasional rustle of some creatures skittering in the walls. A sense of foreboding settled over me as I sifted through the debris, my fingers brushing against the brittle pages of an old journal. I picked it up, observing the weathered leather binding. I opened the journal and found it filled with cryptic entries about a malevolent presence in the soul of the forest. The musty smell of the aged paper and the faded ink only added to the sense of unease.

The further I read, the more frantic and incoherent the entries became, detailing the author's descent into madness as they encountered the same darkness that I now sought. A chill ran down my spine as I realized I was not the first to venture into these woods chasing tall tales and bedtime stories. I put the journal in my pack and stepped outside, ready for the fresh air. Yet the air was no less suffocating than it was inside.

Leaving the cabin behind, I pressed on, my steps growing more hesitant with each passing moment. The fog thickened, obscuring my path and warping the landscape. Shadows danced at the periphery of my vision, and I thought I began to hear soft, mocking laughter carried on the wind.  
  
In my increasingly disoriented state, I tripped over a gnarled root, falling hard onto the damp forest floor. The impact knocked the wind out of me, and for a moment, I lay there, gasping for breath and staring up at the canopy of twisted branches overhead. As I struggled to my feet, a cold, clammy hand seemed to brush against my cheek, vanishing before I could react. Panic surged within me, a primal fear that sent my heart racing and my senses into overdrive.

I yelped, and my breath came in short, ragged gasps as I frantically scanned the shadows, the flashlight beam shaking in my trembling hand. Every rustle of leaves, every creak of the trees seemed amplified, echoing in the deadened silence. I could feel my pulse pounding in my ears, the blood rushing through my veins like an ode to my fears. The forest, once a place of serene beauty, had transformed into a nightmarish labyrinth of threats and unseen eyes.

I took a hesitant step forward, my legs feeling like lead, each movement slow and poorly calculated as I fought the urge to run blindly through the woods. The thought of being chased by something beyond my understanding sent shivers down my spine. I could feel my grip slipping, the rational part of my mind giving way to the overwhelming discordance  of the situation.

Every sound, every flicker of movement at the edge of my vision made me jump, my nerves frayed to the breaking point. I was alone, isolated in the heart of the forest while chasing fairy tales that didn’t want to be found. The realization that I might never leave these woods alive settled over me like a suffocating blanket.

I forced myself to move, each step a monumental effort against the crushing weight of fear. The cold night air bit at my exposed skin, the dampness seeping through my clothes. My only hope was to keep moving. I realized around this point in time that I had no plan for when I actually found The Dirt Man.

I came upon a strange clearing where strange symbols etched into the bark of ancient trees. Their meanings obscured by time and the elements. They seemed to pulse with a dark energy, as if whispering secrets only the forest could understand. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, stalked by unseen eyes that watched from afar.

And then, just as I began to lose my resolve, I saw him – the Dirt Man. His form was a twisted blur against the darkness, his eyes burning with an insidious light that sent a shiver across my body. In that moment, I knew that I had stumbled upon something far more sinister than I had ever imagined.

But even as my instincts screamed at me to turn and flee, I found myself unable to tear my gaze away. It was as if I were drawn to him, compelled by some unseen force to encroach upon it’s being.  
  
I felt like I was sleepwalking when suddenly I was struck hard from the side, the impacts of two smaller things colliding with my ribs and tearing the breath away from my lungs. I was sent in a semi somersault crashing to the ground. I landed sprawled out on my back, and laid still while I tried to catch my breath, and then I saw hit me.  
  
Some poor approximation of my daughters lay bent in unnatural angles just a few feet away from me. Their faces held the most awful look I’d ever seen. Complete and utter dread contorted the innocent faces of my beautiful baby girls.  
   
 I reached out a hand to Lily and Emily, but they crumbled into dust the moment before our fingers touched. I somehow knew I wasn’t going to hold them anyway. A low, raspy chuckle bled through the silence moments later and I was picked up like a toy by an unseeable entity and was set upright, left standing upon the edge of an endless descent.  
  
“They are dead.” The words yet again bled into the air. My girls are dead.

The voice demanded an absolute truth within me, I couldn’t not believe it. And so, with crushing resignation, I took a step forward, and plunged headlong into the abyss. Little did I know that my journey into the heart of the mountains would lead me to a fate far worse than death itself, as the Dirt Man emerged from the shadows to claim me as his own.

I awoke with a start, my heart pounding in my chest as I struggled to make sense of my surroundings. My body ached as if I had been tossed about in a tempest, and my head throbbed with a dull, persistent pain. Confusion clouded my thoughts as I tried to piece together the events of the night before, but the memories remained frustratingly elusive, like fragments of a shattered dream.

As I slowly rose from the hard ground, and I realized with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that I was covered in dirt, my clothes stained and torn from head to toe.  Fear coursed through me like a tidal wave as I realized it wasn’t a dream. I just needed my family then. I arose and searched our home for my family, but the only sound that greeted me was the hollow echo of my own racing breaths.

 As I called out their names into the silence, dread clawed at my chest, for there was no response.

With trembling hands, I staggered to my feet and stumbled through the dimly lit corridors of our home once more, my heart pounding with a mixture of fear and desperation. But the rooms remained empty, and my calls went unanswered, swallowed by the starving stillness of the night.

As I stood alone in the cold silence of our home, a rationalization began to dawn upon me - my daughters were gone, taken in the dead of night. And though I could not say for certain what had transpired during my time in the mountains, I knew with a sickening certainty that the Dirt Man was to blame.

The rage that had been simmering beneath the surface of my consciousness erupted with volcanic force, sending shockwaves of fury coursing through every fiber of my being. How dare the Dirt Man lay his foul hands on my precious girls, how dare he defile their innocence with his twisted machinations. My fists clenched at my sides, nails digging into my palms until blood welled up in angry crescents.

But beneath the fury burned a white-hot core of sorrow, a deep well of grief that threatened to consume me from within. The thought of Lily and Emily, alone and terrified in the clutches of that monstrous abomination, tore at my heart like a savage beast. Tears blurred my vision as I struggled to contain the tempest of emotions raging inside me, a maelstrom of rage and sorrow that threatened to engulf me in its relentless fury.  
  
Sara left me soon after the girls disappeared. She didn’t even pack anything. She just left me a voicemail that said “I hope it was worth it.”.

Brimming with wrathful hatred, I vowed to find my daughters and bring them home, no matter the cost. For in the sleeping town of Crestvail, where the shadows held sway and the mountains loomed like ancient guardians, the legend of the Dirt Man had claimed yet another victim. And as I set out into the darkness once more, my mind filled with visions of the horrors that awaited me, I knew that my journey had only just begun.

Each step I took was fueled by a burning resolve, a fierce determination to confront the darkness that had torn my family apart and reclaim what was rightfully mine. The streets of Crestvail lay empty and lifeless as I made my way through the town, the judgmental silence broken only by the distant howling of the wind and the pounding of my own footsteps.

As I ventured out into the chilly night air. The streets of Crestvail lay eerily quiet, the usual hustle and bustle replaced by an overwhelming stillness that seemed to weigh heavily upon my shoulders. Ignoring the gnawing fear in the pit of my stomach, I pressed on, determined to uncover the truth behind my daughters' disappearance.

With each step, the memories of the previous night flooded back with painful clarity. I remembered the darkness of the mountains, the unearthly presence of the Dirt Man, and the overwhelming sense of dread that had gripped me as I stumbled through the labyrinthine tunnels. But try as I might, I could recall nothing of what had happened to Lily and Emily, no clue as to their whereabouts or fate.

As I retraced my steps from that night for what felt like the hundredth time, my mind raced with a thousand questions, each more unsettling than the last. What had the Dirt Man done to my daughters? Were they still alive, or had they already become victims of his insatiable hunger?

But even as doubt laid raw at the edges of my resolve, I refused to give in to despair. For the sake of Lily and Emily, I would brave the depths of the mountains, confront the darkness that had claimed so many before them, and do whatever it took to bring them home.

With renewed vigor, I set out into the wilderness once more, my footsteps echoing through the barren trees like a lone beacon in the night. And though the shadows seemed to encroach upon me more with every passing moment, I pressed on, driven by a father's love and the desperate hope that somewhere, out there in the darkness, my daughters were waiting for me to find them.  
  
The image of Lily and Emily twisted and contorted into grotesque puppets by the hands of the Dirt Man, haunted me every time I closed my eyes. Their faces, once filled with innocence and laughter, now in my minds eye, stared back at me with empty eyes, their mouths frozen in silent screams that shredded the peace of mind I used to know.

Guilt clawed at the edges of my consciousness, a relentless reminder of my failure to protect my daughters from the horrors that lurked in the shadows. I should have been there for them, should have shielded them from the darkness that threatened to consume us all. But instead, I had led them into the very heart of danger, unwittingly delivering them into the clutches of the Dirt Man himself.

The reality of my failure pressed down upon me like a mountain, crushing me beneath its unbearable burden. I found myself consumed by a sense of overwhelming despair, my thoughts spiraling ever deeper into a bottomless abyss of self-loathing and regret. I was a failure as a father, a failure as a protector, and now my daughters would pay the ultimate price for my shortcomings.

 I tried to push the horrific images from my thoughts, to bury them beneath a facade of stoic resolve, but the memories clung to me like a suffocating shroud, robbing me of sleep and sanity alike. Every time I closed my eyes, I was haunted by visions of their lifeless bodies, their limp forms dangling from invisible strings like macabre marionettes in the hands of such a disturbed puppeteer.

But even as I wallowed in the depths of my despair, a flicker of determination burned within me like a tiny spark amidst the darkness. I refused to give up on Lily and Emily, refused to accept that they were lost to me forever. Somewhere out there, in the cold embrace of the mountains, they were waiting for me to find them, and I would not rest until I had torn them from the clutches of the Dirt Man and brought them home where they belonged.

With each passing day, my obsession with finding my daughters grew more all-consuming, demanding every waking moment of my existence. I prowled the forests of Crestvail, my eyes darting from shadow to shadow, searching for any sign of the creature that had stolen my children from me.

Still, the town remained eerily silent, its inhabitants whispering in hushed tones of the tragedy that had befallen our family. I could feel their eyes upon me, their pity like a knife twisting in my gut, but I paid them no heed. All that mattered was finding Lily and Emily, no matter the cost.

As the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months, my obsession with finding my daughters only grew stronger, consuming me from the inside out like a ravenous fire. I became reckless, heedless of the dangers that lurked in the darkness, driven by a single-minded goal to reunite my family at any cost.

But no matter how hard I searched, no matter how far I ventured into the mountains, my efforts proved futile. The Dirt Man remained elusive, his presence a constant shadow that loomed over me, taunting me with the knowledge of my failure.

And so I resigned myself to a life consumed by grief and guilt, haunted by the memories of my daughters and the knowledge that I had failed them when they needed me most. For in the end, the true horror was not the Dirt Man or the darkness that lurked in the mountains, but the darkness that dwelled within my own heart.

Time passed like a slow-moving river, its currents dragging me deeper into the floods of my own despair. Without Lily and Emily by my side, I was adrift in a sea of loneliness and grief, my once steadfast resolve crumbling like sandcastles in the tide. The relentless ache of their absence sat heavily upon my soul, leaving me hollow and empty, a mere shell of the man I once was.

In my despair, I sought solace in the only refuge I could find - the bottom of a bottle. Alcohol became my constant companion, its numbing embrace offering temporary respite from the pain that threatened to consume me from within. Each night, I would drown my sorrows in a haze of intoxication, losing myself in a fog of blurred memories and shattered dreams.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, until a year had passed in a blur of drunken stupor and self-destructive behavior. I had resigned myself to a life without my daughters, convinced that they were lost to me forever, swallowed up by the darkness that had claimed them on that fateful night.  
  
As I stumbled through the deserted streets of Crestvail, lost in a haze of alcohol and self-pity, I came upon her - the seer. She stood on the outskirts of town, her presence like a shadowy specter looming in the darkness. Her eyes held a knowing glint, and her words carried a truth that seemed to penetrate the very depths of my soul.

At first, I was wary of her, dismissing her as nothing more than a charlatan peddling false hope to the desperate and the gullible. But as she spoke of things long forgotten, of truths buried beneath layers of deceit and illusion, I found myself drawn to her in spite of myself.

I stumbled upon her, my eyes bleary from the alcohol and my heart heavy with grief, the seer regarded me with an intensity that sent a shiver down my spine. "You seek answers, do you not?" she murmured, her voice low and melodious, carrying a mass that seemed to fill the empty spaces between us.

I blinked, taken aback by her perceptiveness. "How do you know?" I asked, my voice rough with emotion.

She gave a small, enigmatic smile, her gaze never wavering from mine. "The whispers of the town carry tales of your sorrow," she replied cryptically. "And they also speak of the Dirt Man, the creature that haunts the mountains and takes what it desires."

My breath caught in my throat at the mention of the Dirt Man, the memories of that fateful night flooding back with painful clarity. "You know about him?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

The seer nodded solemnly. "I have seen the darkness that dwells within the mountains, felt its malevolent presence lingering in the shadows," she replied. "And I have seen the faces of those it has claimed, their spirits trapped in a never-ending cycle of torment and despair."

A surge of anger rose within me, mingling with the despair that had consumed me for so long. "What can I do?" I demanded, my voice tinged with desperation. "How can I find my daughters and bring them back?"

The seer regarded me with a knowing look, her eyes seeming to pierce through the very fabric of my being. "The answers you seek lie within you, Carter," she said softly. "But you must be willing to confront the darkness that dwells within your own heart before you can hope to face the darkness that surrounds you."

I recoiled at her words, the truth of them hitting me like a physical blow. "What do you mean?" I asked, my voice trembling with uncertainty.

The seer reached out a hand, her touch gentle yet firm. "There is a darkness within you, Carter, a darkness born of grief and guilt," she said. "But there is also a spark of light, a glimmer of hope that refuses to be extinguished. You must embrace that light, Carter, and let it guide you through the darkness that lies ahead."  
  
I had nothing left to lose, so I tried as she’d said.

I stood outside the liquor store, my hand hesitating on the door handle. For too long, I had sought solace in the bottles lining its shelves, using alcohol to dull the ache of losing Lily and Emily to the clutches of the Dirt Man. But today, something inside me shifted. With a deep breath, I turned away from the familiar temptation and headed home, my heart heavy but resolute.

The withdrawal was brutal. Nausea and tremors wracked my body, while my mind was consumed by a relentless barrage of cravings and self-doubt. Each moment without alcohol felt like an eternity, a battle against the demons that had held me captive for far too long. But with every passing day, I found strength in the thought of my daughters, their faces with me every waking moment.

As I fought through the darkness of withdrawal, a newfound will burned within me. I would not let the Dirt Man claim my daughters without a fight. With each step forward in my recovery, I moved closer to reclaiming my life and bringing Lily and Emily back from the clutches of the darkness that had stolen them from me.

It wasn't easy, and there were setbacks along the way. But with the support of the seer and the unwavering resolve to see this through, I slowly began to piece my life back together. I still sought out every lead, every whisper of information that might lead me to the Dirt Man's lair, though.

And as the months passed, I found myself emerging from the darkness stronger and more resilient than I had ever been before. I had sworn off alcohol for good, determined to live a life free from the shackles of addiction. But more than that, I was determined to bring my daughters home, to face the darkness head-on and rescue them from the clutches of the monster that had taken them from me.  
  
I sought out the seer again, hoping she would provide the guidance I so desperately needed. Her dwelling was deep in the forest, hidden away from the prying eyes of the modern world. The trees seemed to close in around me as I approached her cottage, their branches intertwining like skeletal fingers, shrouding the path in shadow.

I knocked on the weathered wooden door, the sound echoing in the stillness of the forest. Moments later, the door creaked open, revealing the seer. She was a beautiful woman, her eyes her eyes bright and piercingly sharp, as if she could see straight into my soul.

“Carter,” she said, her voice a soothing whisper. “I’ve been expecting you.”

“How did you—” I began, but she cut me off with a wave of her hand.

“There are things in this world you cannot understand,” she murmured, stepping aside to let me in. “Come, sit.”

I followed her into the dimly lit room, filled with the scent of burning herbs and the flicker of candlelight. Strange symbols and artifacts cluttered the space, creating an atmosphere of mysticism. I took a seat at a small wooden table, and she sat across from me, her gaze unwavering.

“You seek the Dirt Man,” she stated, her voice filled with a mix of pity and resignation.

“Yes,” I replied, my voice trembling. “I need to know how to summon him. He took my daughters, and I need to get them back.”

The seer’s eyes softened, and she sighed deeply. “The path you’re on is dangerous, Carter. The Dirt Man is not to be trifled with. But if you are determined, there is a way.”

“Tell me,” I urged, leaning forward.

She reached under the table and pulled out a small, worn book, its pages ragged with age. Flipping through it, she stopped at a page filled with intricate pictures and strange incantations.

“To summon the Dirt Man,” she said slowly, “you must sleep with dirt from the grave of a loved one under your pillow.” She paused to assess my reaction, and then continued, “The Dirt Man is a creature of the earth, sustained by the energies of death and pain,” she explained. “The grave dirt will act as a conduit, drawing him to you. But be warned, Carter: this act will bind you to him. Once summoned, he will not easily let you go.”

I swallowed hard, the surrealism of her words sinking in. “I need the dirt from a grave of a loved one?” I repeated.

“The cemetery on the edge of town,” she replied. “I believe you have a child there, your son. Take dirt from his grave,” she said, handing me a vial, “ and place it under your pillow tonight. The Dirt Man will come to you.”

I stood up, my legs shaking. “Thank you,” I said, turning to leave.

“Carter,” she called after me, her voice tinged with sadness. “Remember, the Dirt Man feeds on despair. Keep your wits about you, and do not let him consume your spirit. He is an ancient and devious spirit.”

I nodded, unable to find the words to respond. As I stepped back into the forest, the seer’s cottage disappearing behind me, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was walking into a trap. But my daughters’ faces haunted my every thought, and I knew I had no other choice.

That night, I would summon the Dirt Man, and I would face whatever horrors awaited me.

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the cemetery as I made my way to the plot where my son lay. The air was cool and crisp, carrying the faint scent of pine and earth. Each step felt heavy, burdened by the weight of the task before me. I had avoided this place for so long, the memories too painful to confront, but now I had no choice.

The cemetery was eerily quiet, save for the occasional rustle of leaves in the gentle breeze. The headstones stood like guards, watching me as I moved deeper into the grounds. My heart pounded in my chest as I dwelled on  the life lost too soon and the family I was desperately trying to save.

Finally, I reached the small grave. My son's final resting place. My breath caught in my throat, and for a moment, I could hardly move. The old wounds began to bleed, the feelings I had buried alongside him resurfaced, and overwhelmed me. I knelt down, the damp soil cold against my knees.

"Forgive me," I whispered, my voice breaking. "I have no choice."

With trembling hands, I reached into my pocket and pulled out a small, empty vial. I stared at the dirt, my mind flashing back to the day we laid him to rest. The sorrow, the loss, the helplessness. It all came flooding back in an instant.

I scooped a small amount of soil into the vial, the act feeling both sacrilegious and necessary. The dirt was cool and slightly moist, its texture gritty between my fingers. As I sealed the vial, I felt a tear escape and roll down my cheek.

"I'm so sorry," I murmured, wiping the tear away. "I promise I'll make this right."

The cemetery seemed to hold its breath as I stood up and slipped the vial into my jacket pocket . I took one last look at the grave, my heart aching with a pain that had never truly healed. The soil sitting heavily against my chest.

With a deep breath, I turned and made my way back through the cemetery, the shadows growing longer in the fading light. The path out felt endless, each step dragging me further into the reality of what I was about to do. But there was no turning back now. I had the dirt, and tonight, I would see the Dirt Man.

As I left the cemetery behind, the resolve within me hardened. This was the only way to confront the darkness that had stolen my daughters. Whatever the cost, I would face it head-on. For their sake, and for the memory of the son I had lost.

 With the dirt carefully placed beneath my pillow as instructed by the seer, I settled into bed, my mind buzzing with a mixture of anticipation and trepidation. The presence of the dirt beneath me felt wrong. Closing my eyes, I tried to relax, to let sleep claim me as it had so many times before.

But as the minutes stretched into hours, I found myself tossing and turning restlessly, the darkness of the night pressing in around me. Try as I might, sleep eluded me, slipping through my fingers like grains of sand. Each passing moment felt like an eternity, the silence of the night broken only by the soft rustle of leaves outside my window.

I tried to quiet my racing thoughts, to push aside the sense of unease that gripped my heart. But the image of Lily and Emily, lost and alone in the clutches of the Dirt Man, haunted my every waking moment, their faces etched into the fabric of my mind like a wound that refused to heal.

With a frustrated sigh, I sat up in bed, running a hand through my hair in agitation. What was I doing wrong? Why couldn't I sleep? I just needed to fall asleep already.

Closing my eyes, I took a deep breath, allowing the rhythm of my heartbeat to guide me into a state of relaxation. The darkness seemed to soften around me, its edges blurring into a hazy fog as I finally drifted into a fitful slumber.

And then the air grew thick, each breath became a struggle. I opened my eyes to find myself standing at an opening of a cave. An acrid breeze escaped its depths and carried with it the smell of death. And then, without warning, the ground beneath my feet gave way, and I found myself tumbling headlong into a yawning abyss.

I fell for what felt like an eternity, the darkness swallowing me whole as I plummeted deeper and deeper into its embrace. And then, with a jolt that sent my heart racing, I landed hard on solid ground, the impact knocking the wind from my [lungs](https://youtu.be/LJ796TV6VOs?si=L7E2-WhdzQyZsFyx)
