I recently became a homeowner for the first time in my life, finding a nice two story house that was at the time surprisingly affordable. I managed to find it in one of the safer neighborhoods of downtown Chicago that was a very small area with only a few other houses. The house had three bedrooms, two bathrooms, along with a basement besides the two other stories. The house felt like a dream come true, then I made the discovery that it had a hidden attic.

"This place is perfect for a new homeowner like yourself, especially since you may have guests over to spend a few nights." The real-estate lady told me when I first talked to her about the house a few months ago. "It was built recently, around 2018, so it's got modern appliances built in. The AC unit needs a bit of work but it's estimated to be under 100 to fix." She went on. She then tapped on her tablet and showed me the blueprints, showing me each of the rooms. After a tour of the house I settled on it and over the next few weeks I started moving in. During these few weeks, I started noticing things around the house.

I was unpacking my clothes and putting them in the larger bedroom on the first floor and was organizing everything in my closet when I could suddenly hear some type of grinding noise. It sounded as if a machine was malfunctioning and its internal components were struggling to get things working, *CRRK, CRRK,* I could hear coming from the wall. I ducked under the rod and put my ear up against the wall and could hear the sound coming through the hardwood wall that also a large layer of concrete.

I knew there were two AC units in the house, one upstairs in the bathroom and the one downstairs in a closet in the kitchen that led to the outdoor unit outside. The unit upstairs would pretty much be right above me, so that's what I thought the noise was, the messed up AC unit that was sending noise through the vents. But this was the only logical answer I would ever be able to give during the coming weeks as things got much more chaotic.

*CLICK, CLICK, SNAP.* Is what I heard while watching movies in the living room. It repeatedly was shoved into my ears, making me wince every time I heard the *SNAP* ring out. My TV was cranked up to 28 and I could still hear that racket, "What the fuck?" I groaned. I paused my movie and looked out the windows at the still lit up area, believing some assholes were messing with the new guy on the block. I've seen that kind of thing happen around Chicago so it felt right to me. But even after checking the cameras on my phone and seeing nobody around the house I could still hear that sound. *CLICK, CLICK, SNAP.* It was like somebody was cracking a belt inside my head, sending agonizing shockwaves into my cranium.

The sound played in my head long after it stopped like my brain was putting it on loop. It went on inside my head for two solid weeks and messed with my sleep schedule, I'd gotten maybe 30 hours of sleep in the span of two weeks. It was the fourth week and I'd finally gotten good sleep, I then decided to fix the second floor AC after getting the right tools and watching the right videos. I removed the panel to look at the unit when the next noise began drilling into me.

*CRSH, CRSH, SPLSH.* It was so loud it jolted me backwards and I almost cracked my head against the toilet. Even with the suddenness of the sound I noticed that it came down through the vent, but I was already on the second floor so where could it go? The sound then came through again, it felt like it was cracking my head against the ground. I replaced the panel and grabbed my flashlight and looked around for where the vent could lead. I was walking down the stairs when the sound came in muffled through the wall beside me.

I pushed in on the wall with all I could before it came apart, pushing in a panel of the wall for me to slide it over. A crawlspace leading up a slope that was big enough for me to squeeze through revealed itself with some sort of hooked wire dangling down it. Built into the wall was a switch that when I flipped it, the hook retracted up the slope. The dim flickering light showed some sort of trail leading up the slope that I then started crawling up towards. I climbed up the slope and popped my head out of the exit and looked around.

A wide open space with metal beams as supports was in front of my eyes, flickering lights in the ceiling lit up the empty attic for me to see that it covered at least 90% of the house. I climbed fully into the attic and stood up as I looked around confused, "This can't be possible." And that's when all of the lights went out. I tried shining my light around but it went out too, then I heard it. *CRRK, CRRK,* it was over in the left corner. The light came on and a wrench's shadow appeared against the wall where it was adjusted by a hand to create the sound.

The light went out and I heard *CLICK, CLICK, SNAP* before jumping as the right corner's light sprang to life. A crown's shadow appeared on the wall where the wrench cranked on it, *CLICK, CLICK*, before a clamp slammed together, *SNAP*. The light went out and I began shaking, backing up into the wall as all the sounds pierced my head. Finally the center light came on, and I saw a shadow of a man sitting in a chair with the crown on his head. The wrench started cranking on it as I both heard ear splitting screams and *CRSH, CRSH*, hammering into my skull. Then I heard the *SPLSH* and saw what it represented.

I fell to my knees as blood dripped from my nose and I could feel it coming out of my ears. I cried in pain as I heard, *CRSH, CRSH, SPLSH, CRRK, CRRK*. *CLICK, CLICK, SPLSH, CRRK, CRRK, SNAP.* I crawled to the slope and slid down it as the noises got louder and louder. *SNAP, CRRK, CRRK, SPLSH, CLICK, CRRK, CRSH, SNAP.*

I practically jumped out of the hole in the wall and rolled down the steps as I groaned when I hit the carpeted floor. I pushed myself up and looked down at the small puddle of blood that pooled around my head, I wiped the blood from my nose but it still drained from my nostrils. Just when I thought it all stop I heard more of the screaming, but it wasn't just in my head, I heard it coming through the hole in the wall. I collected myself and made a break for the front door as the screaming got closer and closer along with the skull breaking *CRRK, CRRK, CRRK* noise filled my ears and head. I shoved open the door and fell down my steps onto the path outside the house. I looked at the house as I finally heard silence.

I stayed at my Dad's house for a few weeks after I got back from the hospital, I just told him somebody broke into the house and I didn't feel safe anymore. I then moved out of that house and got a "refund" back, the lady who sold me the house seemed so regretful and ashamed. She knew what was in that house, what happened there, but she was forced by her boss to sell the house. I forgave her and she helped me find a new house where she did an in depth tour of a new house and let me stay there for a couple weeks before selling it to me. She even sold it to me for a discount, telling me to use the rest for my hearing aids. I'd been living in this new, albeit smaller, house for a good six months now. Still, when everything goes quiet I still hear those last few noises. *CRRK, CRRK, CRRK, SPLSH.* What do you think, what were those noises in that attic?
