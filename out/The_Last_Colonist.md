Seventy-two of us did resolve to embark upon the perilous journey across the vast sea. After months of toiling upon the tumultuous waves, only sixty-five souls did alight upon the untamed shores of the virgin land. By the grace of God, my dear wife, Edith, and our son Adam did endure the voyage. Yet, any trepidations concerning our new existence were swiftly quelled as the fleet of vessels was dismantled to build rudimentary dwellings.

 

The initial months proved bountiful: fish abounded in the rivers, game was easily ensnared, and our crops  
flourished in the fertile soil. Even our scant encounters with the indigenous people were amiable, as we traded goods and knowledge.

 

But as the seasons shifted, so did our fortunes. An early and harsh winter claimed much of our harvest before it could be reaped, and the game dwindled with the chilling temperatures. Nineteen souls succumbed during that bitter winter, a toll that would have been far greater were it not for the benevolence of the natives, who provided sustenance to see us through to spring. Alas, Edith did not survive, falling victim to illness amidst the snows.

 

Contact with the indigenous inhabitants waned as swiftly as the thaw arrived. Yet, with the warmth of spring, we thrived anew, welcoming the birth of the first children in this new world, though only one of the two offspring survived the ordeal.

 

It was with the onset of autumn that the onslaught began. Following close contact over the winter, many  
of the natives fell prey to a mysterious illness, laying blame upon us for its dissemination. Despite our superior arms, their mastery of the bow and familiarity with the terrain proved our undoing. It was not outright warfare  
but swift and calculated assaults that whittled away at our numbers. Adam fell victim to these attacks, and our attempts at retribution were in vain.

 

By the time we retreated from our coastal settlement deeper into the wilderness, only seventeen of us  
remained. Laden with whatever provisions we could carry, we knew it was insufficient. The frost had already descended, and the land could yield no more sustenance.

 

The youngest among us were the first to succumb, followed swiftly by the elderly. As the snows encroached, whispers of eating the dead arose, though to my knowledge, none dared to indulge such desperate measures. Yet, as the cold persisted, one by one, my countrymen perished, leaving me as the lone survivor.

 

Four nights past, the final ember of companionship was extinguished. I am now the solitary inhabitant of this desolate realm, surrounded only by the towering sentinels of the forest, bearing witness to my slow demise. The silence of the forest engulfs me, broken only by the lamentations of my empty belly. How I yearn for the  
indigenous people to chance upon this primitive encampment and relieve me of my agony. Once, I beseeched the Lord to grant me mercy, to deliver me from this anguish. But in the solitude of this alien terrain, I no longer plead for His cruel intercession; if a divine being exists, surely He would have taken me alongside my son. There remains naught but to yearn for the cessation of this existence
