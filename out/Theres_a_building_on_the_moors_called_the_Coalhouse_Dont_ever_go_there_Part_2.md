It disturbed me that Carly’s car was a Volkswagen Polo from the nineties. Sure I noted many differences from the car featured in my dream. The Polo was a small hatchback, whereas the dream car had the feel of an estate—quite possibly a Volvo. Carly’s ride was a dull maroon, but my car had been tomato red. And this time round Carly drove, while here I sat tense in the passenger seat. But how many Polos had survived from the nineties? It scarcely counted as a sturdy classic. It still felt spooky that we rode in a car out of the same era, while rolling over that familiar bleak landscape of our night terrors.

Carly interrupted my thoughts.

‘I hope you don’t mind me asking, but how did Malena die?’

I very much minded. Still, I understood her reasons—I too may have enquired if I was heading to the land of the dead with someone who meant to confront their dead spouse. I told her: ‘Malena had a rare blood illness. It was painful and protracted. The doctors gave her eight months. She got three-and-a-half years in the end. Before...’

No way I could finish that sentence.

‘It’s okay. You needn’t say more.’ She paused, before adding, ‘I’m convinced Beth’s dead, zero doubt in my heart, but I have no idea how she died. I’m not sure which is worse: knowing or not.’I said, ‘neither’s worse. They’re just different,’ In truth, my situation was direr. I’d give anything for an inch of uncertainty over how Malena died. But how could Carly understand? She was hellbent on learning Beth’s fate and it would go badly for her when she did. The thing about not knowing, though, is there always exists the possibility, however tiny, that the person’s not gone. Such hope will drive you mad. And for this reason we root out the truth—to kill hope dead once and for all. Carly was too far along the path to her own destruction for me to make any difference now. And I found myself too far down my own path.

Carly pulled the car to a stop on the verge. ‘That’s the turn-off for the Coalhouse.’ She pointed to a patch of moor. If you strained you could just make out the double ruts, majorly overgrown, wending off over the hills. ‘It’s getting late,’ she said. ‘I booked us into a place for the evening and we can set out properly tomorrow. I hope you don’t mind, I got us a twin room. The only place for miles is pricey and I haven’t been in work for a good while.’

‘I’ll chip in.’

I imagined us both in the same hole when it came to finances.

Carly set off again. It was only when we hit the village and everything started to look familiar that it dawned on me. ‘Where did you say you’d booked us again?’

I glanced at her and she glanced at me. Then she got what I was driving at and her face dropped. ‘Oh no! I didn’t think. Is it going to be the same place?’

‘It is. Of course it is. Like you said, there’s nowhere else to stay in these parts.’

‘I’m so sorry.’

Two minutes later we pulled up at the retreat where Malena died.

‘It’s okay, we’re here now. It’s just a hotel.’

‘You’re sure?’

‘Let’s just get in.’

The receptionist processing our reservation gave me a double-take and started acting awkwardly with us.

‘What was that about?’ Carly asked me as we went towards the lift.

‘Oh you know. I reckon I’d treat someone like that if their wife had died in a room, then I’d jumped to the wild conclusion they were back at the same hotel for a romantic break with another woman.’

‘But don’t I look, obviously…?’

‘I’d say so. Never underestimate people’s blindness to detail though.’

Not long after, we lay in our separate single beds, both admittedly wearing more pyjamas than we were used to. I tried my damnedest to block out that familiar flowery pattern now wrapped around me in sheet form, and to avoid thoughts of a certain fateful room located somewhere on the floor above us.

‘Do we have a plan,’ I asked Carly before we turned the lamp off. ‘In case we encounter anything?’

She sighed. ‘I’d genuinely just regarded this as a doomed voyage of discovery. I suffer these phantoms in the daytime now anyway; I’ve never thought to overcome one. Also Beth was full of schemes and they don’t seem to have helped. She had this crazy idea about slaying the Bull God, even got some kind of sacrificial dagger from somewhere. You should have seen it—impressive thing, gold handle, curvaceous. How do you kill a god though? What?’

She’d seen my features change as she described the knife.

‘Oh. Well. I think I actually have seen that dagger. In my dreams.’

‘Alright. Tell me every detail.’

‘Remember I said I saw the words “Angwynne, left hand of the Bull God” written? That knife carved them. It was stabbed into the floor where it was carved.’

‘But you know what that means? Beth might be sending us a message!’ She sounded frayed but on the edge of excitement.

‘Wait. Hold it. There’s more. There was blood everywhere, Carly. All over the floor. The knife was smeared in it too.’

She took a moment, then the corners of her mouth started to spasm. Seconds later she was sobbing with her head in her hands.

‘It was just a dream,’ I managed.

‘None of them are just dreams,’ she replied, red face peering up through waterlogged eyes. True. It felt crazy we might take such nightmares as evidence of someone’s death; on the other hand I couldn’t deny there was some sense in Carly doing so, at least in this instance.

After that it took me a while to sleep. I witnessed Carly setting out on fitful unconsciousness beneath her duvet before eventually an aching type of weariness dragged me under.

I snapped to. The air was heavy and damp to breathe. It was cold. I struggled to remember where I was in the dark. Oh yes, the retreat… but hold on. The bed was hard underneath me, a block of wood with no cushion. My eiderdown had been swapped out for scratching sack-cloth. I could make out no features of the room; it was dread black.

‘Carly? Carly are you there?’

I turned on my side and came up against a wall where before there had been none.

‘Carly!’

I tipped myself off the other side of the bed and was astounded to pace only once and hit another wall.

Where the fuck was I?

I groped frantically along the perimeter of the poky cell until I came to a door. I yanked and rattled at the handle but it wouldn’t give.

‘Oi!’ came a cry from the far side. I froze. The door sprang open and a man confronted me, raising a paraffin lamp in one hand. ‘What’s this? Thought we’d have a little lie in, did we duchess? Give me good reason why I shouldn’t pummel you well.’

I considered explaining he had the wrong person. However, I clocked the snake whip he was busy kneading in his other hand, while flexing the muscles of his forearm, and the words failed me. He caught my expression looking down, and laughed. ‘The whip’s for the ponies, ye great jessie. It’s my fists for you. Get down the cellars before I give them exercise.’

I tried to slip past him into the corridor and obey without a clue where the cellars might be. He grabbed me by the shoulder. ‘Your lamp hey?’ He motioned to the foot of the bed where a lamp similar to his sat. ‘I should suppose you want me to light it for you as well?’ I nodded mutely and retrieved the thing, not having the faintest idea how to get it going. He tutted, took out a small length of rag and opened the window in his lamp to set it alight. Then he lit the wick in my lamp and twisted a brass knob on the side to set the flame’s brightness. ‘Get going.’ Again I went to comply but this time he grabbed me by the throat. He pushed me up against the doorframe and squeezed hard, a mean and triumphant look about him. ‘I’m docking a day. Don’t be late again.’ Then he scoffed and let me free. I stumbled away up the passage, clutching at my neck, hoping to whichever god would listen that I had gone the right way. I turned a corner and it was close to déjà vu. The long, rotted hallway with the tumbledown ceiling stretched out before me. I had been here before; at least this time the lamp hung in my hand rather than on a hook in the distance. I picked my way barefoot along the floorboards until at last I came to the stairs at the end, where I descended.

No Malena guarded the iron doors this time. They whined as I heaved them open. Inside was a shaft dominated by a rude wooden lift, with a hand-crank mechanism built into its wall for operation. The thing was the living example of rickety. But it would probably lead to the cellars, though I had forgotten why I wanted to go there. What was I doing?

It dawned on me I had temporarily lost my mind. That grotesque slave-driver character had filled me with such terror that I had slipped into a type of stupor, forgotten who I was. Had he been sent to scare me out of my wits, to make me comply? I searched for a handhold of lucidity and grabbed on once more.

I had been at the retreat, now I was here.

‘Carly,’ I whispered.

Perhaps the powers of this place were leading me by the nose to my own demise. It could well be they wanted me to go down. And why the hell not? What else had I come for?

I stepped onto the beams of the lift and cranked the wheel. With horrendous creaking and clacking the elevator dropped. My lantern swung wildly with the motion, casting a merry-go-round of shadows. I kept cranking. The air rising from below reeked with smoky coal dust. Inch-thick cracks in the floor slats revealed nothing beyond blackness below. Same show through the roof.

The lift hit the bottom so hard I fell over. I groped out at once from my prone position and righted the lantern—the last thing I needed was another fire. Then I hauled myself up and smacked the dust off my pyjamas. My elbow stung. I checked and found blood seeping through the sleeve where I had collided with the ground. With nothing solid to gauge it on, I hazarded that I had descended five or six storeys into the earth. Another set of iron doors faced me; the only way on. Now that the cacophony of the winding mechanism had ceased, I detected the clatter of industry echoing from beyond. I leant on the doors and they juddered open.

I was met by an arched tunnel forged from dark stone. The tumult echoed louder now: the groaning of iron; indistinct shouts back and forth, the great clobber of rock piles being dumped one upon the other. I stalked in the only direction left to me—towards the activity. The passage gradually sank and led around a lengthy curve before opening into a vast, vaulted cellar.

Across the floor, mini-rails snaked between pillars, and on these rails trains of ponies hauled open-top hoppers piled with coal up to giant coal heaps on the dirt, where men secured leather straps underneath the wagons, heaved and tipped the coal. The men wore rags over their heads and mouths to protect from the heavy buffets of dust, dust which currently stifled me with every in-breath. Not wishing to be exposed in the tunnel entrance, I nipped behind the nearest pillar. From this vantage point I could see tunnels down at the lower end of the cellar, where the pit-pony convoys emerged. Far along the wall at the opposite end, bright daylight bleared in through a wide opening, two storeys high.

A way out of this hellspace.

The thought of being detected by any of the pitmen petrified me, though I could only guess what might happen. Would they grab me and put me to work? Would they haul me off and down the mines? Might they peg me as an intruder and descend on me en masse? The earlier brave notion of facing my doom had evaporated, and now my only certainty was that I didn’t fancy finding out.

I tweaked the knob on my lantern, dimming it as low as it could go without extinguishing the flame. I waited until I discerned no one looking my way, then flitted behind the first mountain of coal beyond the pillar. I figured I could hop from hiding place to hiding place, until I hopped my way right out that exit. I paused again before zipping to the next pillar, then I crept along the dark side of a chain of empty mineral wagons. Soon I crouched within screaming distance of the exit. Out in the bright light I could see billowing clouds of vapour, and through them the misty vision of a steam train, hissing and spitting as it lingered on the platform. This last part would be the trickiest—there was no way to get out without standing and walking a hundred feet through a wide open space.

In the main thoroughfare to the entrance, several men were dismantling a pony-train. The ponies were uncoupled one at a time and led in one direction, then the empty wagons were heaved along a sidetrack by four of the men tugging ropes. Once the men began to pull away, it occurred to me that no one’s focus currently lay on the exit. I jumped up and walked with as much of a casual gait as I could manage towards the daylight. I’d covered about two-thirds of the way when a pony-train came rolling through the steam outside and in via the entrance. I had failed to anticipate activity from this direction and now I found myself completely blocked. My options were to bolt off into the shadows—that way drawing attention —or to continue confidently on and hope that no one thought anything of a man in his pyjamas going about his business. As the odds stood against me either way, I gambled on the latter.

At least if it worked I’d be out.

The train crawled near and I saw that, unlike the previous convoys, the ponies pulled flatbeds. Bunches of barrels were strapped to the cars via leather straps, and stencilled on the side of each was a skull-and-crossbones, alongside the word “gunpowder.” The pony driver swung his whip with casual nonchalance, allowing it to lightly slap against the ponies before drawing it back in across their spines. We were close to passing when I recognised the driver as the same burly bloke who had hounded me out of my cell. How could he have arrived here so quick? He noticed me at the same time, and yanked on the nearest pony’s bridle to bring the train to a halt. He looked me up and down with a smirk. ‘Still not at your post? You’re looking for punishment it seems.’

I could only think to bargain now. ‘Look, I’m not who you think I am.’

He rolled his eyes. ‘Aren’t you, Peter?’

‘You know me?’

‘The Right Hand of the Bull God knows much.’ He gritted his teeth suddenly. ‘And let me tell you, you belong down here. And down here I am master.’

‘Would you just let me go?’ I detected an edge in my own voice that sounded unhinged. Overhearing the exchange, several of the workers had dropped their activities and wandered closer. I gawped around at them, daring to hope someone might take my side.

It was then I saw they were all corpses. Dark mummified flesh clinging taut to bone behind the rags. Their eyes had long rotted out. And yet they stared at me.

I wheeled away in fright and collided with a pony; it bucked in response. The Right Hand of the Bull God growled, angry. The pony knocked me sideways, my lantern falling to the ground. The Right Hand and the undead Pitmen closed in. I clawed up onto my feet and sprinted away, deeper into the hall, peering over my shoulder to learn if they followed. Panic had spread through the ponies and the Right Hand was caught up trying to calm them. Several of the beasts reared, jolting the flat cars behind them. A barrel of gunpowder slipped its leather strap and toppled directly onto my lantern.An almighty crack resounded around the cellar.

Massive splinters of wood flew everywhere, carrying bucketloads of dirt, bouncing off pillars and mounds of coal. A fireball bloomed in their wake. The ponies were screaming. I was thrown to the ground and winded. For a whole minute it rained wood and stone and dirt around the hall. As things settled, I gasped for breath and rotated myself with difficultly into a face-up position. Then I gazed through a soup of dust to the explosion’s origin point. The Right Hand of the Bull God stood there. The right half of his body was on fire, a straight line of flame cutting completely down his middle. He brandished his whip to one side, and that too was aflame. Through the cloud, he appeared to be glaring directly at me.

And he cracked his fiery whip.

For a third time I grabbed myself off the floor. I scarpered wildly, not a thought where I might end up if only far from the hellish vision. At the bottom of the cellar I bolted down the first tunnel I came to, ran along the tracks. Light was scarce, with a single wall-mounted lamp placed every thirty yards or so. Eventually the tunnel split at a junction. My feet were ready to take their own path, when I spied something down one of the passages, a person stood in the distance under the lamp. No doubt; it was Malena. I hurried in her direction but the damnedest thing happened. As I closed in she kind of melted away—that is, she became a trick of the light. What I thought was her became no more than a collection of shadows in the rock wall. I came to another fork and the same thing happened. Malena lingered down one branch… until she didn’t.

On and on I went. Deeper and deeper into the earth. At every crossroads the illusion of Malena dragged me this way or that. Each time I thought I would reach her at last; each time she dissolved like a mirage. I must have marched for well over an hour before the transport tunnels gave way to the wider passages of a mining operation. Much of the rock face became glittering black; shovels, picks and ropes lay scattered, waiting for miners to take them up. Behind, the tunnels boasted sturdy construction; here makeshift scaffolds propped the ceiling up.

I passed into a cavern hollowed out from pure coal three-sixty. A railroad led directly through it and I thought no more than to follow the track to the exit at the far side. But as I got to the centre a movement caught my eye. Malena hovered by the wall to my nine o’clock; I twisted to confront her. This time—instead of dissipating—she turned and bent, entering a cramped tunnel in the wall. Without considering calling out, I rushed headlong after her into the half-size entrance. There were no lamps in this hole, and almost instantly I found myself in sheer darkness, using my arms to feel out the way ahead. Then the passage gave way to a greater cave, still lightless. I stood my full length, completely lost as to how I might continue through the screaming expanse of void.Something large and inhuman exhaled somewhere in the cave.

My eyes, desperate now, rebelled at the absence of light, and I thought I could suddenly make out a shape at an indistinct distance, diagonally up in the blackness. But this was no residual hallucination; the form persisted. As a child I once possessed an illustrated book of Greek myths, and it seemed to me I could distinguish the outline of an object much like the shape of a Minotaur, sat up on some sort of daïs. The source of light illuminating this creature remained a mystery. Its skin glimmered and seemed to be made of coal, and I reasoned that I must be perceiving some type of statue in the gloom.

But then it spoke.

‘What business has a living creature here?’

The bass in its voice took all the hairs inside my ear and rattled them. The question was a command and I felt compelled to respond. ‘I don’t mean to be here. I’m looking for my wife.’

‘Malena.’

‘So you know.’

‘My realm is mine, and all within it.’

I hesitated, then sputtered out, ‘may I see her?’

It laughed, and that was a terrible thing. ‘The shivering vole asks the Mighty Roaring Bull. But the answer depends. You belong to separate realms. For now.’

‘But *Ang-win* brought me here. To your realm.’

‘*Ang-oui-nuh.* Yes. The Right Hand is force, the Left Hand is cunning.   Understand. Those above forgot us. They stopped sending their dead, long ago by your measure. Unnatural slayings may still arrive, but beyond those few it seemed our fate to stay an unchanging kingdom, on into eternity.‘However, Angwynne is industrious. Since the night our realm fell fallow she had other ideas. She casts her net, using a mortal’s anguish against them, manipulating torment to draw them in, to pull them down to us. Inch by inch, soul by soul. Under Angwynne’s steam we grow.’

‘Then add me to your number. Let me be with Malena, or at least share a moment with her.’

‘I could crush you in an instant; send you to the ranks of the dead. That said, such an act disrespects the hunt. My kingdom shall always observe the rites. Your soul must be allowed to take its path. I have spoken.’

He clapped his hands together and it sparked a shockwave of greater force than the gunpowder explosion.

I lost all sense.

Something or someone shook me. I tried to open my eyes, but the brightness of the world around proved excruciating. My entire body jarred. I felt like I hung upside down. I was shaken again.‘Peter. Peter are you alive?’

The voice was Carly’s. I could only moan in response. In drips and drabs I rose up into the world. I became lucid to the fact that I lay at the bottom of the valley below the Coalhouse, head pressed against the valley floor and feet sticking up the slope. Carly helped turn me the right way up.‘I had a Coalhouse dream last night,’ she told me. ‘When I woke up you were gone.’

‘Me too. But mine was no dream. When I woke was just now—the “dream” transported me.’

‘That’s crazy. Listen, you look like hell. Let’s get you up to the car, I’ve got your overnight bag in the boot.’

With Carly for support, I hobbled up the slope and out of the valley. Looking like hell was an understatement—I didn’t recognise myself in the wing mirror. To begin with I was caked head to heel in coal soot. My pyjamas were bedraggled beyond mending. My hair had been styled to match. I sported bruises all over, and those bruises had bruises. My elbow had been bleeding. My face looked drawn, dehydrated and weary, the eyes bloodshot. My bare feet had split open. Using bottled water and tissues, we scraped what grime we could from my skin. I changed into fresh clothes behind the raised boot lid, and finally slipped some trainers onto my sore feet. Then we sat with the car doors open and spoke.

Carly told me of her nightmare. A gaunt man had terrorised her in the hotel, by turns desperate to apologise for bad behaviour, then exploding into murderous fury at a perceived rejection. Angwynne had sprung out at some point and dragged Carly down the stairs by her hair. She’d woken to find her coccyx bruised and me missing. The night manager was adamant no one had left the building, at least not through the foyer. Carly had packed up, checked out and driven straight here.When she was done with her story, I recounted everything that had happened to me overnight.‘So there’s a Right Hand too? Guess that checks out logically. And you actually spoke with a god. I just can’t process what we’re saying here.’

I knew what she meant as I felt exactly the same. If I hadn’t woken up miles away from where I’d gone to sleep—all horribly banged up to boot—I still wouldn’t have believed it.

We gazed through the windscreen out over the valley at the hulking Coalhouse on the far side. ’There’s nothing in there for us but brutal injury, pain and death, is there?’ said Carly.

‘Looks like it.’

‘And can I also be honest about Malena?’

‘Go for it.’

‘I don’t think it’s her you’re following in your dreams, just the illusion of her.’

I locked eyes with the woman. ‘You could well be right. But they can show me the illusion of Malena because they have her. She’s there. That’s what I believe.’

‘There are no guarantees that even if we feed ourselves to that place, we’ll ever get to see our loved ones again. I mean, there’s no suggestion the Coalhouse’s dead get to socialise with each other when they’re not busy terrorising the living.’

‘What other points do you have against us going back over there?’

‘Well, you’re in need of medical attention.’

‘Yup.’

‘So. We’re going straight back in then.’

‘Yup.’

She sighed.

’Indeed.’

I’m sat overlooking the moors now, writing on an old tablet I stowed in my bag. I promised I would document events if I got the opportunity, and all odds favour this moment being my last chance. Once I’ve seen my writing safely uploaded to the internet, we’re heading back across the valley and into that building, awake and with our physical bodies for the first time.If you don’t hear from me again, I’ll see you in hell.
