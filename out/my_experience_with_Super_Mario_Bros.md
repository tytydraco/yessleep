Hi, my names Kyle I was a BIG fan of the Mario games, But now, after my experience. I want to stay away from Nintendo's Mario games... One day I was cleaning my house, I was moving, and my mom was helping me, I had cleaned the whole house, except the attic...

I had just walked in the attic and noticed all the boxes; then saw a NES. I remember playing it when I was about seven years old. Then I spotted a box of NES games. Two days after that, I was in my new house, I had found the original Super Mario game in the box of NES games and booted it up in the NES.

It started normal, and I picked one player. When I started playing, I noticed that I was Luigi, I thought that it was just some weird phenomenon or something. After a bit of jumping and all that, I spotted a Mario in his big version, he was taller, and his colours were darker. "Wha- what...?" I thought to myself as I made Luigi Walk towards to him. The screen turned black, and text appeared saying "Hello kyle...." ... What. how could've the game know my name?! From what I know this never happened when I was seven! The text continued. "RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN. The game returned to the actual game, Mario became deformed and started chasing me.

I ran as fast as I could Soon Luigi hit the flagpole, text then appeared saying, "Goodbye Kyle..." "FOR NOW." Luigi entered the pipe that brings him to 1-2....

Luigi was now standing is the leaking cave, Still horrified of what i saw. i went through the level with caution. Enemies were now just piles of bloody bones. I thought I had escaped the monster until.... I saw text saying, "PEPARE TO DIE." I realised that he was coming BACK. I RAN AS FAST AS THE GAME WOULD LET ME. He's gaining up on me.

I had finally reached the pipe to exit the underground, but... it wasn't letting me in. "What's wrong kyle? not getting things your way?" I pushed and pushed and finally it let me through, I ran to the flag hoping the Horrid Mario wouldn't get me, finally I got the flagpole all in one piece.

Now it was time for 1-3, I jumped on and off the trees and... well that's it. nothing was normal, the sky had turned a shade of reddish black. Luigi then sat down and face towards the sky. I could see tears going down his face.

There was more static than normal, Way more static. The static stopped as Luigi stood up, "I'm ready to go now..." That was the text that appeared on the screen, I assumed it was from Luigi because who else would say it? Anyways, Luigi ran through the trees of 1-3. As he passed by the bloodied corpses, he said stuff like "God, this makes me sick..." And whatnot. When I got to the goal the screen turned black, and text appeared. It was from *him.* "What do you want!?!" I yelled at the mere sight of him. Next to the Mario appeared princess toadstool, but her face was mangled. One eye missing, One eye bloodshot. "I gave the princess a makeover. Do you like it?" Said the red wearer. "You're sick." I said. "Toad too, but he's still getting ready..." He added.

A lakitu appeared "T-Toads ready sir..." Ah! perfect timing, isn't it kyle? "Now, where were we? Ah yes, Toad." He grabbed Toad's corpse, Toads legs were torn off, both eyes gone, and a hole in the chest. "He was annoying anyway. Now, I suppose I should let you go... At least for a little while..."  The game resumed.

1-4... Yay... The castle was... quiet. Nothing to be heard besides Luigi. More bloody corpses... Near the bowser arena was a Toads corpse, next to it is peaches body. He was here. I know he was. "Ah, finally! your here!" the screen panned to the Mario, "I've been expecting you... But I must ask, why are you still here?" "What...?" I asked, "I've done everything. but your still alive." The Mario grabbed the axe and threw it away, "You won't be needing this..." The Marios hight increased. "LETS-A GO." The Mario grabbed Luigi and threw him downwards, where the lava was supposed to do.

The screen followed Luigi as the background turned pitch black, the Marios eyes appeared, "How could you abandon me, Kyle?" The text appeared on the screen, causing my heart to race. Luigi was falling endlessly in the void, and Mario's eyes glowed menacingly in the darkness. "We were friends, Kyle. We had so much fun together." The game mocked me, knowing too much about my childhood.

I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The game knew my name, my past, and was taunting me with it. I felt a shiver run down my spine. My hands were trembling, but I couldn't stop playing. It was as if the game had a hold on me.

Luigi finally landed on a dark, eerie platform. "It's time to end this," Mario's voice echoed, and the screen flashed red. I could barely make out Luigi's terrified expression as Mario descended from the darkness, his form more grotesque than ever, with twisted limbs and a sinister smile.

I tried to make Luigi run, but the controls were sluggish. Mario was getting closer, and I knew this was the end. Just as Mario reached Luigi, the screen went black again, and text appeared: "You can't escape, Kyle. You can never escape."

The NES console powered off by itself, leaving me in a stunned silence. I stared at the blank screen, my mind racing. What just happened? Was it a glitch, a prank, or something more sinister?

I decided to get rid of the NES and the game. I couldn't take any chances. I packed them away and took them to a local game shop the next day. The clerk gave me a strange look when I handed them over but didn't ask any questions.

Since that day, I haven't touched a Mario game. The memories of that night still haunt me, and I can't shake the feeling that Mario is still out there, waiting for me to return. I've moved on to other games, but the shadow of that experience lingers, a reminder that some things are better left in the past.
