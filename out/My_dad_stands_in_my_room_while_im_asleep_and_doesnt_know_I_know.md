For context there was about 7 years there from early middle thru high school this happened. It hasn’t happen in a couple years and im 22 M but I need opinions and yes, he still doesn’t know. 

My dad who was early 50s when it started, used to check on me, 13ish and my siblings rooms at night, nothing crazy just checking if we were still awake or left a light on. One night he came into me & my brothers room and it was dark and quiet but I was still trying to go to sleep. As he got closer I was sure he would wake me up but he stopped and stood there. Like he saw something in the dark.
This happens a few more times like once every week or so. Then it got weirder. 

I would actually be asleep and he started lifting my arm?  So imagine being in REM sleep on a school night and wake up to someone hesitantly lifting your arm by your wrist and trying NOT to have a reaction. Oscar performance truly. 

My brother who’s a couple years older unlike me curious to know what he’s trying to do, speaks up and asks what he’s doing. But my dad just told him nothing and “not to worry about it”. He ALWAYS left immediately after my brother said something which was a couple times. Sometimes I would move as if I were “tossing or turning” in sleep and hear him b-line in the dark toward the door. 

I gotta say my dad’s never been creepy or weird, he’s the sweetest person I know which im grateful for and he does NOT play about his family. When my brother said something to my mom she just figured maybe he was praying in a weird way which he did before but this wasn’t that. 

He didn’t even mumble prayers like he does when he prays for us awake. Nothing. Just pulling the cover back and lifting my arm and scurrying at any sign of movement like he did he think I was in danger? I have no health conditions at all so that’s no plausible.

This happened for years, spaced out but consistent. To this day I act like idk that it happened or that I heard him tell my brother to not worry about it. He probably assumed I think my brother is crazy or lying since he lies alot and has always had behavior issues. I wanna ask but im almost sure he’ll play it off.

My very best guess is he had some nightmare that he felt I wouldn’t understand on a spiritual level since he is heavily devoted Christian’s for 30+ years. I know some will think “well that’s weird” but that’s fine. I’m more creeped out by him never talking about it and acting as if it never happened or like my brother is tripping. At this point my brothers told my sister too who has another room and never experienced this by the way. Since there’s no proof and I never came forward it kinda got brushed off and we all moved on. I cannot stop thinking about what he was trying to do no matter how much time goes by.
