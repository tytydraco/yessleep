One day, I'm laying on my bed and I go on my phone. I go to pictures and I decide to scroll all the way down. To see my pictures from awhile ago. 

I'm feeling nostalgic and I'm wondering how different my life was and how much I've changed. While looking through the photo's that I took. I see a strange man in the background.

He looks out of place, creepy, kinda grey, black hair and a brown hoodie. As I scroll to more of my pictures, I see him again and again and agian. 

I check the easiest photo's I have on my phone from 7 years ago, and he's there too. In the background. I check the photo's I took yesterday and he's their took. In the background. 

I stand up, a little frightened and confused. I don't know what to think about this. So I take a picture of my window. Then I see the photo on my phone and he's their too. Standing in the street. I look at my window and he's not there.

I look at the photo, he's their, I look at my window and he's not there. 

Mabye it's just a bug, with my phone. I shouldn't be worried. It's just a bug. A small problem. I shouldn't be worried so I ignore it. 

I go through my day, eating, watching, going on YouTube but I can't get the imagine of the grey man out of my head. 

The more I think of him, the more scared I get. I try to distract myself, playing video games and I eventually forget. 

Later at night, I'm laying in bed and the lights are off. Suddenly I hear a noise, and creepy noise of someone coming up the stairs. 

I lay in bed in terror. I hide under the covers pretending I'm asleep. The noise gets closer and closer. I'm panicking under my pillow. Hoping it'll go away. 


I hear it come in my room, closer to my bed. I'm also in tears, I don't know what to do. I feel it standing above me. 

I decide that, I shouldn't be scared, this is my home. I can't just let this thing attack me. 

So I jump up and grab onto it. It's the grey man from the photo's. I start to strangle it with all my strength.


With all my range, I hold tight onto its throat, Suddenly it grabs my waist and picks me up, and runs towards the window. 

Yet we don't crash, we phase through it. We come the other side and it's my room. 

Only its not night, its morning. I fall to the ground in confusion. I just teleported through a window. 

The grey man is standing above me, and just phases away. He disappears. 

I stand up and look around, I touch the window to see if I can phase through it, but it's just a window. 

Then I look through it and see that everything is off. It looks older. 

I look around my room and realize, it's different too. I look on the papers I have on my desk and realize, I'm in a completely different year, it's 2014. 

I traveled back in time somehow, I'm excited, then I realized there's no sound.
