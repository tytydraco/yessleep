I won’t tell you everything that happened in that room.

Not because I can’t remember—I do. Every second of it. Every cut, every smile, and scream. I will never forget. I don’t think anyone could. But, some details are best left unsaid. Here is what you need to know.

They took their time. Each step in the ritual introduced a new instrument from the pile, and with it, heightened pain. Their animalistic joy never wavered. The smiles grew larger as my protests turned to screams.

There was something about my response that was euphoric to them. I believe this empty grey world fed on it. It wasn’t malicious or vengeful, it simply was the way they worked. My fear ignited some deep dark hunger these creatures didn’t even know they had. And once they tasted it, no food, rest, or compassion for their own child would keep them away from it.

They were careful to sew me up every so often. They weren’t going to let me die in that chair. One would assume it was because, in some morbid way, they still cared about the child that would inevitably return to this body. I knew that wasn’t the case. I knew they simply never wanted these games to end. If that body was destroyed, that was it. No more fun for them. 

I thought I would feel the buzzing when the switch happened again.

But I didn’t.

The pain drowned out everything else. There was no warning, no transition—one second, I was there, and the next...I was back.

Curled on the center of my bed.

The shift from excruciating pain to the comfort of my room was nauseating. I stumbled to the trash can in the corner and vomited. When I finally stopped, I raised my hands to my face.

No blood.

I scanned the room. It looked just like it had after the last switch—overturned furniture, clothes, and electronics scattered everywhere. I reached for the lock on the door.

Still engaged.

I should have felt relief. Instead, the weight of what I had just escaped from pressed too heavily on me to feel much of anything. I slid down against the door and curled up, the marks on my surrogate still burning in my mind. I sat there, awake, until morning.

**Knock, knock.**

I knew my mom was checking on me. I hadn’t moved from my spot for hours. It had to be nearly noon.

I didn’t bother cleaning up the mess. I wasn’t going to hide it. I was going to tell her the truth. I was lucky the lock worked this time. She or my dad could’ve been hurt.

Or worse.

I tossed the lock aside and sat on the edge of my bed, eyes fixed on the floor.

My mom entered. A short bout of silence followed her before I raised my eyes to meet her.

She stood in the doorway, hands on her hips, eyes on the lock beside her. Worry and sadness radiated from her expression.

“Honey, have you been sleepwalking again?” She asked.

I didn’t respond. What could this have to do with sleep walking? Did she not see the room? The vomit? My swollen, red eyes?

She looked up at me, gave a look of sympathy, then sat beside me.

“I called Dr. Sullivan this morning and scheduled an appointment for you today. He wants to talk about what's going on.” She put an arm around me.

Dr. Sullivan? Last time I met him to talk about my “dreams.” None of this was adding up.

"I’m sorry you’re going through this again.” she said softly. "You don’t need to hide it. You know how dangerous it is. But it was smart to use the lock. Just… remember to put it on, okay? You scared me last night."

My heart sank.

"What happened last night?"

She hesitated, then forced a smile. "Nothing, honey. You just scared me, that’s all."

"Did I hurt you?"

"No, no. Not at all." She paused, her expression shifting as she recalled the night before.

"I was just catching up on some chores in the kitchen. The light just…turned off. Out of nowhere. Scared me half to death—I screamed so loud I woke your dad."

Her face turned sour.

"I couldn’t see at first. Then I saw you. You were just…standing there. Across from me. In the dark." Her voice broke slightly.

"You didn’t say anything. Just stood there. That’s how I knew it wasn’t really you." She let out a dry chuckle. "Well, it was you. But…you know what I mean."

She rubbed her arms, as if the room suddenly went cold.

"Your dad called from upstairs. I told him I was okay. Then you were gone. I heard your door close, so I figured you'd made it back to your room."

Silence settled between us.

She had left things out. I’m not sure what, but I could hear it in her voice. Whether for her sake or mine, I wasn’t sure. 

Either way, I felt sick.

*How did he get the lock off?*

My mom gave me another hug before heading to the door.

"It’ll be okay, honey. I’ll give you a few minutes to clean up. We’ll head to Dr. Sullivan’s in an hour." She offered one last smile before disappearing down the hall.

She left me feeling more lost than before. I had expected shock. Confusion. Maybe even fear. But she wasn't surprised at all? It didn’t make sense.

And yet, I couldn’t shake the feeling that maybe it did. Maybe I was losing it.

She seemed to know a lot more than I did about what was going on. What did that mean for me? Was this all just a symptom of something wrong with my head? The woods, the switching-had I imagined all of it? Was Raphael safe and sound? Or did I kill him in some manic episode and just can’t remember?

Shame washed over me. Embarrassment too. Had I really been in this position before? Dr. Sullivan helped me? I thought our last session was our first meeting, but if my mom was right, I had forgotten that entire part of my life.

What else had I forgotten?

The drive to the appointment was quiet.

When we arrived, I made sure to apologize to the doctor for not remembering him last time we spoke.

"Oh, don’t worry about that," he said with a chuckle. "You were much smaller then. And to be honest, I had a lot more hair and a lot less weight. I’d be disappointed if you did recognize me."

He shot me a warm smile, trying to ease my embarrassment. I felt slightly more at ease.

He pulled an old binder from the corner of his desk, flipping through its worn pages. "Your mom tells me you’re sleepwalking again?”

"Yeah, I think so. She said I was last night."

He nodded absently, notes still in hand. Questions started to bubble in my mind.

"Is it normal to have bad dreams when I sleepwalk?"

That made him pause. He set the binder down and looked at me. “What do you know about your condition? Has your mom talked to you about it?”

I hesitated. "Not really. I mean-she might have. I just don’t remember. All I remember is that I used to sleepwalk."

"Well, sleepwalking is just part of it," he said carefully. "Vivid dreams-or hallucinations-are another."

I swallowed hard.

"You know, sometimes our minds shield us from traumatic experiences. It’s a defense mechanism. You were very young, so it makes sense that you don’t remember everything."

His words settled heavily on my mind.

"Are you having these 'dreams' during the day?"

I nodded, the feeling of anxiety mounting. I started picking at my fingers to distract me.

"I see." He wrote something down in his notebook.

"The good news is, we’ve treated you for this before. When we spoke a few months ago, you were struggling with sleep. I have a strong suspicion that’s making your symptoms worse. Once we get that under control, we’ll schedule a sleep study, see if we notice anything unusual."

A shiver crawled up my spine. **The file.** I had almost forgotten about it.

"Have I done a sleep study before? The last time this happened?”

"Yes," he said, flipping another page. "Your symptoms improved not long after. If we follow the same course, I expect they’ll clear up again."

He smiled, reassuring. "We’ll get to the bottom of this. It’s been years since anything like this has happened, after all."

If it weren’t for the file, I would’ve believed Dr. Sullivan.

But until I knew what was in it, I wouldn’t be able to rest.

The drive home was as quiet as the one there. As soon as we pulled into the driveway, I went straight to my room.

The file sat there, waiting for me in my downloads folder. That wrong, familiar feeling came over me again**.**

I hesitated, but eventually, I clicked it open.

It was massive.

It took me a while to make sense of it. From what I could tell, it was an unpublished research paper from a group of PhD students at some state university. The study focused on unconventional sleep research conducted in the area. For confidentiality reasons, the medical facilities couldn’t reveal the identities of the participants.

At first, the information seemed harmless-just reports of people from various backgrounds seeking sleep studies for things like insomnia and sleepwalking.

Then I found something that made my stomach drop.

"Participants, having no familial, geological, or social connection, all reported identical sensations leading up to their episodes: a faint buzzing at the base of the skull, followed by a bright white visual across the eyes."

My pulse quickened.

This couldn’t be a coincidence.

I kept reading.

What started as a standard sleep study took a dark turn. At first, nothing unusual. Normal sleep patterns. No abnormalities.

Then, without warning, they slipped into “episodes”.

"Brain activity indecipherable..."  
"Subjects would awaken and perform acts of violence..."  
"Two participants committed homicide..."  
"Three others died by suicide..."  
"The remaining participants had no further episodes recorded."

The document ended abruptly.

I stared at the screen, the words sat heavy on my mind.

*Violence.*

*Murder.*

*Suicide.*

I messaged the person who sent me the file. They had no additional information-only rumors. Theories. Government experiments. Alien possession. Fringe conspiracies scattered across message boards. Nothing reliable. Nothing helpful.

I leaned back in my chair, my mind racing.

This wasn’t in my head.

If I didn’t stop it, I’d end up like them.

But how?

The medication? The therapy? Dr. Sullivan thought it helped, but I knew better. Something happened the last time I went through this. I may not remember what it was, but it stopped it. I stopped switching for years.

Until now.

I just had to remember what it was.

I weighed my next move carefully. My parents already thought I had some kind of disorder. There was no convincing them otherwise.

I was on my own now.

*My parents.*

I realized they may hold the key to remembering what happened.

They were sentimental people, the kind who kept everything-every drawing, poorly made birthday card, every scribble I’d ever made.

I was never much of an artist, but I drew constantly as a kid. If there was a sketchbook or a dream journal hidden in one of those boxes, maybe, just maybe, it could help me remember what happened.

Maybe I could figure out what stopped it.

The first few nights after the incident my parents would check on me constantly. Once things died down, I spent the my nights combing through the garage while my parents slept. 

The first few boxes were a bust-mostly macaroni art and crumpled school projects. But as the hours passed, my mind kept drifting back to the last switch.

Not the pain.

Not the torture.

I did my best to bury that drama. No, It was *him* that haunted me. What he did. How he moved through my house.

How did he get the lock off the door?

The window was wired to the security system. My dad installed it when we first moved here-now I am starting to realize why.

My mom said she heard me close the door after I ran up the stairs. I felt there was only one explanation.

He knew the code.

Somehow, over the years, through all those switches I couldn’t remember, he must have figured it out.

And worse...

Was he trying to hurt my mom?

Or just scare her?

The thought made me sick. I could just picture him parading my body down those stairs. Smiling in the dark while my mom yelled for help.

Something shook the thought from my mind. 

A small notebook caught my eye.

Judging by the date on the box, I must’ve been five or six when I last wrote in it. I wiped the dust from the cover and flipped through it.

At first, it was harmless-random words and messy scribbles. Doodles of superheroes and a crude drawing of Scooby-Doo.

Then, I saw it.

My breath caught in my throat.

One of the final pages was covered in black ink**.** Spirals and strange patterns filled the page, chaotic and frantic. It was a typical image you’d see a child draw in a horror flick. At the center were three figures**.**

Two were tall and wore bright orange.

The third was small. Sad.

The other two were smiling.

My hands began to tremble as I turned the page.

The next drawing was worse.

The smiling people looked the same, but the child was different. He sat on a pile of scribbles. Was he…restrained? There were flecks of red marker scattered across the page.

Blood?

Tears welled in my eyes. Memories of the last switch clawed into my mind from the deep dark place I had been keeping them.

I flipped to the next page, my hand shaking.

This page wasn’t what I expected.

The smiling figures were gone.

At the center stood two figures: the same small child and…something else.

Something tall.

Almost completely black.

Its face was blank. Expressionless. It had something sharp protruding from its head. A horn?

They stood inside what looked like a building**.** Black diamonds danced around the bottom of the page. 

*Black rooftops?*

Whatever this building was, it wasn’t one of the houses I had seen that night out on the street. This structure was tall. Gothic. If I had to guess, it looked like some sort of church.

Whatever it was, I had been there before.

I flipped to the next page.

Nothing. A blank sheet of paper.

The rest of the notebook was empty.

I packed up the garage and slipped back to my room, the notebook clutched tightly in my hands.

I popped a sleeping pill and laid in bed, staring at the ceiling as the pieces started to fall into place.

I found a way out.

Whatever happened in that place-it worked.

The switching stopped.

I didn’t know how.

I didn’t know why.

But whatever it is, I would find it again.

As I drifted off to sleep, a plan started to take shape in my mind.

If there was one thing I did know…

The next time I switched would be the last time.
