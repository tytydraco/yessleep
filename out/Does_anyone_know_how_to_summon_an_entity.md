Hi folks, it's Carl again. I want to thank all of you who responded to [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17p96ix/does_anyone_know_how_to_expel_entities/) with tips and advice on how to deal with my little problem. I've spent the last few hours following some of your suggestions, and things have gotten even stranger (more than they already were).  
  
To begin with, about the entity: I simply don't know what happened to it or where it went. It kept knocking on my door for a long time until it stopped out of nowhere. A few minutes later, the police arrived, with their bright and noisy sirens (I believe enough to alert the intruder to their arrival). Fortunately, they believed me since some of the neighbors claimed to have seen someone heading to my house regularly in the past few weeks, and, knowing my reclusive nature, they suspected. The inspection, however, was unfruitful, no sign, trace, or the slightest clue of the presence of the unwelcome guest. The officers reassured me that they would keep an eye on things, and two police officers decided to stand guard at the property's entrance (hey, the benefits of living in a small town!). I think the presence of other people helped keep whatever it was away from my house for the rest of the night, and who would have thought, you were right to say that maybe I just needed to make friends.  
  
I was definitely fed up with it; my productivity was dropping, and after that last scare, I had decided that I was going to do something about it. The first thing I decided to do was seek the help of a specialist in paranormal phenomena. I got in touch with a local medium who was willing to come to my house. He spent hours meditating and trying to communicate with the entity but couldn't extract any information from it. He mentioned that the presence was powerful but also enigmatic. Gradually, the figure took shape, as he said, and he gave a description: it was a man, middle-aged, who had died in this house a few years ago and was now stuck there. He seemed to harbor some vague feelings toward me, an "obsessor," as the medium put it. He added that his job didn't involve expelling these obsessors; it was something of great power and required specialized individuals, but he told me about a friend of his who had more experience.  
  
Believe me, it's really not cheap. He performed an exorcism ritual in my house, and during the process, the whole house trembled, and strange murmurs echoed through the air. It seemed like something was resisting being expelled, but finally, after hours of prayers and rituals, the sense of presence disappeared (along with the money in my account). Apparently, the entity had left. For the first time in weeks, I was able to relax and finally sleep without fear.  
  
But if it had ended there, I wouldn't be writing this. Earlier today, while I was lying in bed, shortly after falling asleep, I started hearing some noises. With no spirit or intruder in sight at the window, I gathered the courage and went downstairs, making sure to turn on the lights. When I was on the third step, however, I felt unwell. I felt that I should turn off the lights, and so I did, standing in complete silence, as if I felt that something was about to happen. This time, not one, but two shadows started to approach, coming from the dense woods. They weren't like the watcher's shadow; they were slender, stealthy, almost crouching, but with something even more different: their movement was accompanied by steps, heavy steps on the grass.  
  
They stopped at the front door, and I held my breath until I could hear one of them whispering:  
"Are you sure it's clear?" while the other replied, "Yes, that guy is not there anymore, the weirdo is alone in there now, so shut up and don't wake him up." My doorknob started moving slowly, and I could hear the click of the internal gears turning.  
  
A shiver ran down my spine. Whatever the watcher was, it seemed that I had made a grave mistake trying to expel it. I ran back to my room as fast as I could with light steps and placed a chair to block the door (not that I have much faith that it will work). Like an ironic remake of the incident from the previous night, I was locked in my closet again, trying to control my hyperventilation and waiting for the endless wait for the police cars (although this time they seemed less convinced of my urgent situation).  
  
I'm leaving this here as a record in case they don't arrive in time, and with a warning that sometimes it's better not to mess with forces beyond our reach.  
  
I know it's a little late for this, but does anyone know how to summon an entity?
