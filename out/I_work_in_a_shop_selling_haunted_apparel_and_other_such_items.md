As someone who works in a haunted item shop I see things happen often. The mirror that keeps telling me to kill my customers. The chair that occasionally is halfway in a wall and my co-worker Mark who won't shut the fuck up. 

"I'm telling you Jess there was a dark man in the break room!" 

I don't really care about the shadow man in the break room that's just John as I call him he honestly isn't the worst thing about that place. Its a cold miserable room with one barred of window in the roof. I'm not sure if the made it that way so people want to go back to work or of they just hate us. I will however not miss this opertuity to piss Mark off 

"Mark that's racist. You can't go calling your black Co-workers "dark people" as if they're imposing on your space they can go on break too." 

"I'm telling it wasn't human" 

" "It" his name is John has a name and black people have been people since like the 1900s or something so stop hating John we have a customer." 

A tall dark haired man stood in front of us. He wore a black trench coat, a cowboy hat and a red scarf covering the lower half of his face. He put a Crossbow on the counter. 

"Hi I'm a monster hunter I'm gonna use this to kill some motherfucking goblins."  

"OK that'll be £29.99"
Somewhat shocked he replied. 

"What? But I'm going to kill goblins I'm going to do good in the world can't I get a discount." 

"Do you have a members card." 

"No." 

"Would you like to sign up for one for £5.99 a month." 

"No that's so expensive. Why are you charging this much?" 

"Well when you threaten our accountants like that you get charged more." 

"Can to speak to a manager?" 

What a fucking asshole these god dam customers always want to see my manager for no reason. Just imagine someone asks for a weapon to kill one of your co-workers wouldn't you ask for a bit more money unless it's Mark. Fuck Mark. 

But now that he's said it here he comes my manager Elijah he's like a shit beetlejuice. If you ask for the manager he gets soumoned to yell at me. 

"Hello" 

He said in it distinctive voice. It almost raises halfway through every sentence. As if he's inquisitive about everything you say. I guess you have to be if you own a shop of haunted and other such items. 

"Are you the manager?" Asked the supposed monster hunter. 

"Yes I am what might be your issue?" 

"Your worker is charging me a fortune for this cross bow" 

"And why might that be Jess" 

"He's trying to kill goblins" 

Suddenly in a serious voice Elijah responded. 

"Dude, why are you trying to kill our accountants." 

"They killed my fucking sister!" 

The monster hunter responded angrily. 

"Did you offer them money? Because they would have taken it anyway so you should have just given it to them in exchange for your sister." 

"No they just killed her they didn't take anything. They just killed her!" 

He replied 

"Ahh. Common mistake that was probably trolls yeah they love killing women little misogynistic creatures. Yeah we have some of them in the vents apparently Jess won't go in and deal with them because. Oh "They love killing women" and " 
I'm a woman" and Mark. Yeah Mark ain't looking to good right now. But anyway more to the point we'll give you this cross bow if you kill those trolls for us." 

Elijah responds much to the shock of both the customer and Mark who really is pretty pale now that I look at him. 

"OK I'll finish this deal with our new exterminator freind and Jess you go find s chair for Mark he looks like he's about to die and possessed chairs sell for more or he survives we don't need to look for a new employee." 

So on I go to find a chair to let Mark either sit down or die on peacefully. The only somewhat non possessed chairs are in the break room so I go there first. John's just leaving as his half hour is up. 

"Hi John back to the adult section is it?" 

He responds in a manner somewhat reminiscent of the screeching in pain noise you hear when we put on the store radio. We don't really know what he's talking about but he's a good employee and as a woman some of the old men in the adult section some reason think that I would like to be treated like the succubus in their magazines. Nobody seems to think that way of John.
