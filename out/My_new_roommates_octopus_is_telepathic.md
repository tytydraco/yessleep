Hello. My name is Frank, and I swear I’m not crazy. I don’t think I’m crazy.. I hope I’m not crazy.. but as the title implies, something incredibly strange has been happening ever since I moved in with my new roommate.

I was a bit nervous because it was the first time I moved in with someone I didn’t know. I was having such a hard time finding a place that I could afford on my own and eventually I had to settle with living with a stranger. Not ideal, but I didn’t have much of a choice. I was starting a new job soon and didn’t really know anyone in the area I could crash with, so I answered an ad from someone looking for a roommate. 

His name is Mike. He seems like a pretty normal guy generally. When I arrived at his place, he answered the door and seemed friendly. He invited me in to show me around. 

The place isn’t very big. It’s a little two bedroom house. The bedrooms are pretty big though, and the room itself is basically what I’m renting. I also liked that the rooms are on separate ends of the house. That made me feel a little more comfortable, but then I saw the tank.

It’s a pretty large aquarium tank and it’s on a stand right outside of what would be my bedroom. At first, I didn’t notice what was in the tank. I just assumed fish. 

“Oh cool. Ya got some water critters?” I asked. 

“Just one,” Mike replied. 

I started looking around the tank, not noticing what he was referring to. Then he poked the outside of the tank. Immediately, the octopus inside changed colors from its camouflage. 

“Whoa!” I shouted. 

“He's not a dealbreaker is he?” Mike asked. “I know that they creep some people out.” 

“Nah it’s cool,” I laughed. “I just wasn’t expecting that.” 

“Pretty cool how they can change colors so fast, isn’t it,” He said. 

“Yeah they’re pretty fascinating,” I replied. “I’ve just never met someone who owned one.” 

“Yeah he’s pretty cool. I’ve been wanting one for a while, and finally pulled the trigger last year. He’s my little buddy. His name is Cthulhu.”

“Does he squeeze you when you hold him? Does he bite? Or sting?

“No,” Mike replied. “The idea of holding him kind of creeps me out, plus they are escape artists. They can sneak off quickly if they get a chance. That’s why I got a self cleaning tank. It’s locked up and as long as it’s working, I never have to open it. 

The stand the tank was on was somewhat cluttered with miscellaneous stuff like a half empty beer can, some pens, and some general junk drawer type of stuff. 

He also showed me a part of the tank that he “invented”. It was a glass cylinder piece that went into the tank from the outside. He has a slider piece that opened it so he could drop food into the tank without opening it. It looked like he used a broken bong to make it. It also seemed bizarre to want a pet that you’re afraid to touch or even open its tank. 

The clutter around the tank made me nervous about the kind of roommate Mike might be. I’ve lived with a hoarder before and I’m not a fan. I’m a minimalist and really dislike clutter. I guess beggars can’t be choosers though.

Mike has been alright though. He doesn’t seem like a dick which was my main concern. As we got talking it didn’t seem like we had a whole bunch in common, but that didn’t really matter. We didn’t need to be buddies. We just needed to be able to tolerate being around each other and be considerate of one another.

We were exactly that. The only things we had in common were enjoying our alone time, avoiding forced interactions or what most people would call small talk, and thinking that having an octopus is pretty cool. 

I was happy with the situation. Mike and I gave each other space. More often than not, it was like having my own place. Things were working out better than expected up until a few weeks ago when something very strange happened. 

Mike was at work as I was just getting home from work. Working separate shifts was nice. I like having the house to myself. Anyway, this was the day it all started. 

I made some lunch right after getting home. I sat down in the living room to eat. I started looking for the remote because I can’t stand complete silence. I checked the couch cushions. I checked the stand but couldn’t find it. Then I heard a voice..

“It’s over here..” 

I jumped up in a panic. I was freaked out. I couldn’t tell which direction the voice had come from. It was odd. It was like someone spoke directly into my ear, but there was nobody there. 

I clutched my cereal spoon tightly in my hand. If there was an intruder, I could try to spoon stab em in the gums? It was a big spoon since Mike always uses the regular size ones. Ehh, I’m being nitpicky. Mike has been a good roommate, unless he was messing with me.

“Who said that?” I asked nervously while very unsuccessfully trying to sound like I wasn’t. 

“Over here, dipshit,” the voice replied.

“What? Where?! It sounds like you’re in my head!” 

“The tank,” the voice replied. 

I paused for several seconds. I looked over at the octopus tank. I slowly approached and saw that Cthulhu was sitting at the corner closest to me. I just looked at him.

“That’s right,” the voice said. 

I was speechless for a moment. I figured that Mike had to be pulling some sort of prank. I could hear the voice in my head though. 

“It’s no prank,” the voice said. “I can communicate with you telepathically. You don’t even need to speak. Think it, and I’ll hear it.” 

“Okay Mike,” I started to say as I nervously laughed. 

“It’s not Mike,” the voice replied. “Oh, the remote is behind those beer cans.” 

I looked behind the cans and there it was. 

“So I’m hallucinating.. Visually and audibly.. Am I becoming a schitzo!?” I shouted. 

“You aren’t crazy. You’re just learning something that most humans don’t know. My species is capable of things humans aren’t aware of. Things like telepathic communication..”

“Nope. I’m hallucinating. I’m seeing things that aren’t there and hearing things that aren’t there. I might even be smelling things that aren’t there.. Is that a thing? If you can have visual and audible hallucinations, why couldn't someone hallucinate a smell?”

“Relax!” the voice said. “Also, please stop using the word “hallucinating”. It’s starting to not sound like a real word to me. Also, that smell isn’t a hallucination. It’s Mike’s bedroom. Dude’s a closet slob.”

I stuttered as I tried to gather my thoughts. 

“Could you turn the tv on?” the voice asked. “I don’t like the quiet either, but ever since Mike discovered podcasts, he never turns the tv on even though he still finds it necessary to blare his terrible music pretty regularly.”

“You’re the octopus.. and you’re speaking telepathically to me?” I asked, stunned and confused. 

“Way to repeat exactly what I just told you,” he replied. “Could you please turn the tv on now?”

“Not yet,” I said. “You have to prove it.” 

“Well, you can hear me can’t you? I told you where the remote was. Ya know, because I wanna watch tv.”

“Lift up a single tentacle,” I said. 

The octopus lifted a single tentacle.. I couldn’t believe it. 

“This is me flipping you off, by the way,” it said sarcastically. 

I asked him to move it to the right, then left, then right again. He did everything I asked. 

“If you think out loud, I’ll hear it too. Like almost out loud in your head. I would love someone to talk to. I’m trapped in this prison and I’m bored as hell. You’re the first person I’ve spoken to.” 

“Why me? Why have you waited so long to tell someone you could do this?” I asked.

“I can read your thoughts. You’re gonna freak out at first, but you’ll be able to handle this and keep a secret. As for question two, I don’t want to be dissected by scientists.” 

“Why would they do that?” 

“Because.. humans,” he replied. “It’s in most of your nature. Mike would try to use me to get famous. If scientists or marine biologists learned that we can do this, they’d slash open countless octopus brains trying to figure out how, and they never will. I do have multiple brains, but none to spare.” 

“I’m gonna need a minute,” I said. 

“Turn on the tv first! Then take your minute,” he demanded. 

I turned on the tv. Ironically, it was on a cooking show and they were making seafood. 

“Want me to change it?” I asked.

“No I love torture porn,” he said sarcastically. “Turn on the news, would ya?” 

“Well, that’s kind of tough,” I said.

“Why?” He asked.

“There isn’t really news anymore. Just separate propaganda outlets that pander to their audience. People believe in separate realities these days, and they need separate networks to tell them that their opinions are valid.”

“That’s fantastic news!” The octopus replied.

“I gotta disagree, Cthulhu.” 

“First, that’s my slave name. Second, I want the human race to like.. end.”

“I’m sorry. Mike said it was your name. What was that bit about the human race ending?”

“It’s my slave name. I’ll tell you my real name once I feel like I can fully trust you. As far as humans, I want them gone. We all do. Every octopus you’ve ever seen. Most animals too. I can read your thoughts and can tell that you’re enough of a nihilist to probably agree with me or at least not care enough to stop it.” 

“Would I be able to “stop it”? I asked.

“Nah. We’ve slowly been influencing humans toward their own self destruction and we’re actually ahead of schedule. Look at how many of you guys despise strangers simply because they vote for a separate wealthy liar to be your leader. If we can get in the ears of some influential people, we can accelerate that. We can stoke the flames. You see it everytime you turn on the news. We are also trying to accelerate global warming.” 

“So you get us to pollute more or what?” I asked.

“Not exactly. Pollution is bad for us. Deforestation is bad for us. Oil spills are catastrophic to us. We’d prefer to put a stop to all that. Global warming is good though. Eventually the oceans will engulf the continents. Then we become the dominant species. Humans think they’re the only species that can build a society, but they’re wrong. They have no idea what we are truly capable of.”

“So what’s your role in all this?” I asked. 

“I’m a prisoner of war.. Caught in a net like an idiot.. it sucks because not only do you become a prisoner, but it’s super embarrassing as well.”

“Shit, I’m sorry man.”

“You didn’t do it,” he replied. “Wait! you aren’t a fisherman, are you?”

“No, I hate fishing,” I responded. 

“I think we can be friends then,” he laughed. 

This went on for the next few days. We just had conversations about life, love, interstellar paradoxes, ect. We played games like checkers and others where I could move his pieces for him. I had become friends with a telepathic octopus. We even talked about music, something he seemed specifically interested in.

“It would be great if you could leave some music on when you guys aren’t home,” he said.

“I think I can do that. What kind of music do you like?

“We’ll, that’s tough. Because I’m trapped in here, I can only hear the music that Mike plays and the music his previous roommates listened to. He had a few roommates who listened to some stuff I liked. I don’t know the name of the songs but they were really… bumpy.”

“Bumpy?” I laughed.

“Yeah,” he replied. “Like  bump bump doodily do badop bop.”

“So like.. music with a lot of bass?” I asked. 

“Yes!!! That’s it!” he said excitedly. “That was driving me crazy. I heard his last roommate mention what it was and I forgot the word but that’s it!” 

“Okay, so like rap music or funk, or maybe punk rock?”

“I think I like them all”, he replied. “I love that bass! Plus, anything is better than Mike’s awful music.”

“What does he listen to?” I asked. 

“It’s a twangy sounding music where most of the songs are about trucks and beer and living in small towns,” he said. 

“There’s another thing we have in common!” I laughed. “ you’re talking about country music. It’s pretty much the only genre I can’t find anything I like about. I’ll have to talk to Mike a little because I can’t really tell him the octopus requested different music, but I’ll do my best to figure out a way to get him to chill out on blaring the country music throughout the apartment. I’m not here when he’s here very often, but I can’t stand it either. I’ll see what I can do about getting you a radio or something and we can find some music you like.”

“You’re one of the good ones, Frank. If I had to listen to that fucking Applebee’s song one more time I was going to strangle myself with my own tentacles.” 

Moments after the octopus “said” that, Mike walked in. He dropped his stuff in front of the door and plopped onto the couch.

“How was work?” I asked. 

“About as pleasant as passing a kidney stone,” he replied. “Do you work today?”

“Yeah. I gotta leave in like 20 minutes.” I replied.

“Too bad man. I was gonna see if you wanted to get hammered!” 

“Rain check?” 

“What’s that?” he asked.

I explained to Mike what a rain check was. I have no idea how he’s never heard that term. As we were talking, the octopus chimed in from time to time, pushing me to do something about Mike’s music. 

“So what are your plans for the rest of the day?” I asked.

“Gonna do some Jager bombs and jam out!” he said with excitement. “You’re missin out bro!”

The octopus chimed in again.

“Please help me out here, Frank.”  

I looked at the stereo in the living room and back at the octopus and shrugged. 

“You can speak to me without speaking,” it said. “You just have to think out loud. Ya know how some of your thoughts are in the back of your mind and some you almost hear out loud in your mind’s ear? Just do that and focus it towards me.” 

“I’ll try, but it’s tough. How am I supposed to tell him what music he should listen to as I’m leaving for work?” 

“Tell him that you were assaulted at an Applebee’s and that song gives you PTSD,” the octopus replied. 

I laughed out loud. It was awkward because no one had said anything and Mike was still in the room. 

“What?” Mike asked. 

“I just thought of something funny from earlier. I got reading about octopus behavior and stuff because of yours. Then I stumbled on a video where they play different music and see how they respond. They seem to really like funk, punk, and rap.” I said as I fake laughed. 

“Well, Cthulhu is not your average octopus,” Mike said. “He’s a country boy like me!” 

Mike proceeded to turn on some poppy country song that frustrated both me and the octopus. He cranked the stereo loud enough that the neighbors were probably going to complain. 

“Nice job,” the octopus said sarcastically.. and telepathically. 

(Man, am I losing my mind?)

I responded without speaking. “I’m trying. I have a plan but I’m not gonna be able to do it until after work. I’m sorry but you’re probably gonna have to deal with one more day of this.” 

“Thanks a lot,” he replied sarcastically. “Some pal you are.. I bet your tractor is ugly as fuck.” 

I laughed audibly again and Mike asked what I was laughing about. I paused for a moment before telling him that I had taken a THC gummy earlier that day and that was why I was giggly. 

I got my stuff together and prepared to head out the door for work. As I was putting my shoes on, the octopus repeatedly said “you suck you suck you suck” over and over as the twangy music blared. 

I assured him that I had a plan on how to help him after work. I left, got in my car, and headed off to work. Being outside of the house made me feel strange. It was like I had gotten to a point where I was talking to an octopus and not finding it odd. After I left the house, that all came flooding in. 

I got to work and quietly went about my business but I couldn’t take my mind off the octopus. I feared that I was really losing my mind. I had always been a shy, introverted, only child who was prone to panic attacks. Maybe this was some kind of coping mechanism my mind was doing? I’ve spent a lot of my time alone throughout life. Is the octopus my imaginary friend? This might be really really bad..

After work I headed home and on the drive, I was still thinking about the octopus. For whatever reason, when I was away from the house I found it crazy. When I was at the house though, it just seemed normal after only a few days of communicating with it. Assuming I was actually communicating with it and not just turning into a schizophrenic..

I walked into the house to find Mike passed out on the couch. The coffee table was cluttered with snacks, beer cans, and a mostly empty bottle of Jagermeister. There was still country music playing on the stereo which I quickly turned off. Moments later, I heard that familiar voice in my head.

“What’s the plan?” the octopus asked.

“Huh?”

“You said you had a plan to put a stop to that abomination he calls music.”

“I have a couple of ideas, but at the end of the day I can’t tell the guy what he can or can’t listen to.” I said. 

“I’ll make it worth your while,” he replied. 

“I will try to help anyway I can. I can funk with the speaker wires a bit. I gotta ask though, how exactly did you plan to make it worth my while?”

“I will explain as soon as the stereo is no longer operational.” 

I tried to quietly get behind the stereo in the entertainment center while Mike slept on the couch a few feet away. I mixed up the wires, then took a little piece of the gum I was chewing, rolled it in a little bit of lint from the floor, and jammed it into one of the input slots. 

“That should do it,” I said, or rather thought out loud. “ Once he tries it and it doesn’t work, I’ll offer to let him borrow my headphones. If he doesn’t want that, I’ll offer my Bluetooth speaker. Then at least it won’t be so loud.

“Do I still get to hear music?” It asked. 

“I'll put stuff on when I’m here and when Mike is gone. I’ll try to talk him into leaving a radio on by your tank. We’ll figure something out. Now, how were you planning on making it worth my while?”

“You should sit down..” it said. 

“Sure,” I laughed. 

I opened my bedroom door. The tank was right outside of my doorway so I sat on a chair in my room and waited for his explanation. There was a pause before he started “talking” again. 

“Frank.. you have to understand that I have a very heavy distaste for humans. They pulled me from my home, humiliated me, threw me around like a ragdoll, and eventually imprisoned me in a tank. Then I am sold to an annoying weirdo who felt the need to purchase an octopus but is too afraid to actually let it out of the tank or touch it.”

“So you’re like, racist against humans? And you’re not trying to get me to do something weird, right?”

“I’m not kidding around,” it said in a more serious tone. “You’re in danger.”  

“What kind of danger?” 

“Mike..”

“Mike? So what, am I in danger of accidentally drinking his chewing tobacco spit… again?”

“He’s not who you think he is,” the octopus said. “He’s violent..” 

“He doesn’t seem violent,” I replied. 

“He takes his time.. he wants to get to know you. It’s weird. He’s done it to other roommates.” 

“Done what?” I asked.

“Killed them..” 

“That’s hysterical, Cthulhu.”

“That isn’t my fucking name!” He screamed (telepathically) 

“Sorry dude..”

“It’s fine,” he said. “You need to listen to me though. I’m not kidding about this. I have watched him kill four of his roommates. Most of them were down on their luck or homeless and he was “helping out”. He used to let homeless people stay here so he could post about how great he is on social media. He was just looking for victims no one would be searching for.”

“I’m not homeless,” I replied, still assuming he was messing with me.

“No, but you have almost no family whatsoever and none who you are in contact with. You have no friends around here and are new to the area.”

“Did I tell you that?” I asked. 

“No. Mike did. He didn’t say it to me. I read his mind. He had multiple applicants that answered the ad. He chose you because you were moving here  from far away. He thinks that it will make it less likely for the police to connect the crimes.”

“Okay man, ya got me. That’s very funny.” I said.

“You will know when he’s going to attack. He’ll ask you to have dinner with him. He will get something fancy or ask to take you out. He sees it as marinating someone from the inside.” 

“Marinating?” 

“He doesn’t just kill.. He eats..”

I was still skeptical but there was also still a part of me wondering if I was completely losing my mind. The idea of my roommate wanting to eat me would seem very bizarre if I hadn’t been talking to an octopus since I’ve been living with him. Maybe I’m just going nuts thinking an animal is going to talk me into attacking someone like the son of Sam killer. 

“Okay,” I said. Very funny joke but let’s get past this. Come on man. Let’s play some Connect Four or something.” 

“Look under his mattress. Between the mattress and box spring, you will find a large knife. You’ll also find a bottle of sedatives in his top bedside drawer. That’s what he uses.. his plan will be to sedate you at dinner. Once you seem woozy enough, he’ll attack with the knife. If you don’t believe me, go in there and see for yourself.”

I figured I might as well go look since I had already entertained all of this craziness and Mike was passed out drunk on the couch.

I quietly entered his room. The door creaked loudly, but didn’t seem to wake him. After looking back to make sure he was still sleeping, I lifted up the mattress. Sure enough, there was a knife between the mattress and box spring. 

I then went over to his bedside table and opened the top drawer. It was full of miscellaneous junk but after looking through it for a minute, I found a bottle of Rohypnol and a bottle of Klonopin. 

“You need to tell me if you’re messing with me,” I said to the octopus. 

“I’m not. I wish I was. Get the knife.”

“What does it matter?!” I yelled (mentally). “He can just get another knife!” 

“No,” the octopus said. “He’s very ‘OCD’ about it. That knife is special to him. If he can’t find it, it will buy us some time.” 

I was confused and nervous. I had already been dealing with the idea that my mind was melting. Now I have to worry about becoming my roommate's dinner. I bet he would overcook me too. Just seems like that kind of guy. 

“Stick the knife behind my tank,” the octopus said. “There’s some space on the table between the back of the tank in the wall. If he comes near it, I will move in front of it so he doesn’t see it through the glass.” 

I started panicking and did what the octopus said. I placed the knife on the stand behind the tank. There was about an inch and a half of table behind the tank and the gap between the table and the wall. Along with the other clutter on the tank, it did seem to hide the knife well.

“I gotta call the cops!” I said. 

“They won’t do shit if you don’t have evidence,” he replied. 

“Is there evidence? What can I do?” I asked as I panicked a bit. 

“Just act normal around him. When he sees that the knife is gone, it will get his mind on his crimes. I will be able to read his mind and if there’s evidence in the house, he will think about it. Then I can tell you where it is. After that you can call the cops and we can both be freed.”

“It’s gonna be hard to act normal,” I exclaimed. “Nothing about this is normal!”

The octopus replied, “Just because you aren’t aware of something, doesn’t make it abnormal.”

“Kind of like an octopus being able to read minds and communicate telepathically?” 

“Yeah,” he laughed. “Kind of like that.” 

“So what do we do now?” I asked.

“Just hangout. Go to work tomorrow like normal. You guys have staggered schedules tomorrow so he will be home when you aren’t and he will look for the knife and realize it isn’t there. Then I will just listen and wait until he thinks of something that will incriminate him. Until then, I’d love to watch some TV.”

I was freaked out and my instincts told me I should just get out of the house. There was something about the octopus though. Whether it was real or in my head, I felt a genuine connection. 

I decided to stay. I left my door open and turned the TV on. 

“What is this show?” He asked.

“Oh they’re crab fishermen..” I replied. 

“What’s the show about?” he asked. 

“Crab fishermen.” 

“Is that it?” He asked. 

“Pretty much. They throw crab traps into the water and pull them up. It’s been out for damn near 20 seasons.” 

“How could that be entertaining for 20 seasons?” He asked. 

“Well, they play intense music right before it goes to the commercial break so you think something exciting is going to happen when they come back.”

“What happens after the commercials?” 

“Nothing. They just.. continue fishing for crabs.” 

“This is popular?” He asked. 

“Yep”

“So.. You get why we want the human race to end. 

“I do..” 

“Don’t worry about it buddy. You’re on our side now. You’ll probably be long gone by the time we actually take over anyway. Although after seeing some of these television shows and news programs, I'm starting to think we can do it a lot quicker than we originally thought.”

“That’s comforting,” I said. 

“Now can we see if there’s anything on tv other than critter murder?” 

After putting something else on TV, I fell asleep pretty quickly despite all the anxiety going on in my head. I found myself wondering if the octopus could see or hear my dreams as well. What else were they capable of? And of course there was still the lingering question. Is this actually happening? I didn’t know if mental illness was the most palatable reason it could be happening, but it was probably the most likely.

When I woke up the next morning, Mike had already left for work. I went straight to the octopus tank. 

“Ya slept in long enough,” the octopus said. 

“What’s the plan here, man? I’m gonna feel really uncomfortable coming back here if what you said are his true intentions.”

“He didn’t check for the knife before he left. He will when he gets back though.”

“How do you know that?” I asked.

“Because he does it everyday.. he just kind of holds it and looks at it and rubs it against his arms and face a little bit. He’s a weird guy. Anyway, he will realize the knife is gone and it will put his mind on his crimes. Knowing him, he has some sort of keepsake from those crimes. If he thinks about where they are, I will know, and we will have our evidence.”

“Haven’t you been with him for a while? Haven’t you read his mind before? Why don’t you already know where they are?”

“First off, I'm not with him. I’m his captive. Second, I don’t really like spending time in his mind. It’s a fucked up place. Now I have a reason to be there though. I just need you to make me a promise.”

“What’s that?” I asked. 

“Let me be free.. don’t let the cops send me to a zoo or something. Get me out of here before you call the police. I could stay with you until we figured something out.. if that would be okay.. Or just dump me in the ocean. Just please don’t leave me here to become a captive of someone else.” 

“I promise.” 

I got my stuff together and prepared to head off to work. I was a bit panicked and kept forgetting things. 

“Calm down,” the octopus said. “He won’t be back for a few hours. You’ll be fine. We got this.”

“Okay..” I said after a deep breath. “Good luck, buddy..”

“Oh I don’t need luck,” he laughed. “I could use some tunes though. You mentioned a Bluetooth speaker?” 

I grabbed the speaker from my room and connected it to my laptop. He asked me to set it up against the tank so he could feel the vibrations. 

“Here ya go,” I said. “I’ll put on something bumpy for ya.” 

I put on a playlist that I had previously made for him. Just a lot of bass heavy music. I set the speaker against the tank, and I headed off to work. 

It was impossible to focus on anything else throughout the workday. I kept telling myself that I shouldn’t have moved the knife. He’s going to notice and know that I went through his room and his stuff. He might attack me sooner because of it. Maybe the octopus was setting me up all along. Maybe I am just completely insane. 

I spent the day debating in my head which of those would be the worst of the possible scenarios. My heart raced continuously throughout the day. I kept taking trips to the bathroom just to try to catch my breath.

After the workday ended, I didn’t want to go home. I was afraid. I didn’t know if I should arm myself in case Mike attacked me. I didn’t know if I should just head to the hospital and check myself into the psychiatric unit. My mind was all over the place, but I knew I had to go back to the house. 

When I got home, I sat in the driveway for a few minutes. I saw Mike’s car in the driveway and knew he was there. I figured that he probably had noticed his knife was missing. It took a few minutes, but I worked up the nerve to go into the house.

It was quiet when I walked in. The first thing I noticed was the smell coming from the kitchen. It smelled good. I walked in there and saw food cooking on the stove which was unusual considering that Mike hadn’t made anything more complicated than a hot pocket throughout the time I had been there. 

The fear of Mike attacking me was weighing heavily on my mind, yet I still was trying to convince myself that I had just gone crazy. I certainly wasn’t excited about either possibility. 

I saw that Mike wasn’t in the kitchen or in the living room. I started walking toward his bedroom door to knock and see if he was home when I noticed the tank. 

It was cloudy and dirty so much so that I couldn’t even see into it. As I want to take a closer look, I heard a noise coming from the bathroom. The door was partially ajar. I slowly approached. I lightly knocked on the door and called Mike’s name. There was no response. 

I began to push the door open and Mike burst out of the bathroom in a frenzy. He ran right past me with his arms flailing wildly. I followed him into the living room as I watched him make these bizarre movements like swinging his legs and arms around in different directions. I thought he was having some sort of seizure or stroke.

“What’s going on!” I shouted.

Mike looked at me, then looked away, then continued flailing his arms in a very bizarre manner. He looked like he was struggling to speak, but eventually managed to get a few words out.

“Help!” He screamed in agony. “It hurts! Please!!” 

He then began to stutter. He continued to try to shout for help, but it was like he wasn’t able to force the words out. His screams of pain and pleas for help quickly turned into a nonsensical bumbling. Just a “pu pu pu” noise that sounded like he was trying to speak but wasn’t able. 

I started searching my bag for my phone to call an ambulance when I heard a familiar voice.

“Frank! Don’t call em,” 

“Cthu.. octopus? Is that you?” I asked (mentally).

“Yeah,” it responded. “Hold on. I’m trying to get the hang of this thing.” 

“The hang of what?! What the hell is happening?!” 

“We did it, Frank! Just hold on.” 

I watched in horror as Mike struggled and periodically forced out a plea for help. His torso started bending forward and backward frantically and the only words he was able to muster were help, hurts, please.. 

I tried talking to Mike but simultaneously I was trying to think out loud to the octopus.

“What’s happening!” I screamed again. 

There wasn’t a response for another minute or so. The wailing and pleas for help from Mike started to slow down as well as the frantic movements of his limbs. Eventually, he fell to his knees and sat there motionless. He moved his gaze from the floor up to me making eye contact. His eyes were red and watery from tears but the look on his face was content. I asked again what the hell was happening before hearing the voice in my head. 

“We did it!” the voice said.

“Did what?” 

“Escaped!” Mike excitedly replied. 

Mike started looking at his hands and clenching his fists and releasing slowly. He started touching different parts of his body and looking around in a very bizarre fashion. Then I heard the voice of the octopus again.

“I’m in here, Frank. I’m in Mike.”

“Can you please explain to me what I’m seeing?” I asked yet again.

Mike started moving his jaw around in a bizarre fashion like he had a mouth full of peanut butter. He cleared his throat and started to speak.

“It’s me,” he said. 

“I don’t understand.”

“The octopus. Remember when I said that we were capable of things that humans weren’t aware of? This is one of them.” 

“And what is this?” 

“I’ve taken control of Mike’s body. He wasn’t using it for anything good. He’s a dangerous man. I’ll make much better use of his body than he did.”

“Is he dead?! What the..”

Mike and/or the octopus interrupted me, saying to calm down. 

“I’ll explain everything, Frank. It’s gonna be okay.”

“This doesn’t look okay!” I yelled. 

“Calm down,” the voice said. “Please, sit down. Let me explain.” 

I shouted again. “I’m not gonna sit! Why do I need to sit? Sitting down doesn’t make bad news any less bad!” 

“It’s me. It’s the octopus, Frank. I have taken control of Mike’s body. I’m free now.” 

“What about Mike?” I asked as I tried to catch my breath. 

“He’s still in there. He just doesn’t have control. I am in control of his body now. He will remain alive and aware, but he will be stuck in the vessel that I will now control.”

“That’s fucking horrible!” I yelled. 

“I know,” he replied. “It’s almost like being stuck in a tank for years and never being allowed outside of it..” 

I sat down. Maybe this was too much for a standing conversation. Mike was now speaking clearly, but I could simultaneously hear it in my head in the voice of the octopus. 

“He kept me trapped as a decoration. Intelligent species need to be stimulated. You can’t imagine what that felt like, but Mike can now.. I told you we were capable of more than humans knew. Do you think our plan was to just convince people through telepathy? We are among you. It’s so nice to be out of the tank and into a nice new shell. He wouldn’t be my first choice, but he deserves it and there’s the convenience factor.” 

“How did you even do this?” I asked in a panic.

“With a little help from my friend,” he replied with a shit eating grin on his face. 

“What?”

“You’re  going to love this,” he replied. “I’m pretty proud of myself. So, it started with the knife. I asked you to put it in a very specific position for a very specific reason. Same with the music. Although I really do prefer the bumpy music, it actually served a purpose. Having nothing to do all day but look around the clutter surrounding my tank, I got an idea. I wish you were here to see it work because it was just awesome!”

“To see what work?” I asked.

“My plan. The reason I kept asking you to adjust the speaker was because it needed to be in a very specific spot on the table. That’s also why I asked you to turn up the volume before you left. The bumpy music caused the table to shake lightly, but just enough to slowly move the knife that you had placed behind the tank. Eventually, the knife fell off the back of the table. This part was intense because it was the piece of my plan most likely to fail. But thank Poseidon that it actually worked! The knife landed on the cord of the self cleaning tank with just enough force to unplug it. I then waited for Mike to arrive home and squirted a jet of ink. When he realized something was wrong, he opened the tank for the first time since I’ve been in there. I then spoke telepathically to him for the very first time, causing him to look away from the tank and distracting him long enough for me to escape. Brace yourself because this is the gross part. I made my way to the bathroom and into the toilet bowl, knowing that Mike has a routine when he returns from work and it starts in the bathroom. I knew that even if I was missing, he would have to “sit down” before long. When he sat down, I made my move.”

I felt a little sick as I listened to this explanation. I tried to interrupt him but he continued explaining.

“I was able to quickly get up in there. It took me a little bit to get the hang of the controls, but I think I almost have it down. I’m very much more in control than he is and soon I will have total control of his body, AKA my new shell.”

“That is beyond disturbing,” I said. 

“Oh come on! I’m like fuckin MacGyver!”

“I mean.. yeah, that’s crazy that it all worked. I am just a little more focused on you being inside his body and referring to it as a shell.” 

“Frank, I am forever in your debt. I would’ve died in there if it wasn’t for you. As far as his unpleasant new circumstances, he did the same to me. He did a lot of bad things.”

“He wasn’t a cannibal though, was he?” I asked.

“No, but he is a total sexual predator. Why do you think he had roofies? I did fib about the cannibalism and murderer aspect, but it was necessary for the plan.”

“You lied to me.. Are you going to hurt me?” I asked fearfully. 

“I did deceive you a little bit.. but I promise from the bottom of my hearts that I hate country music and the Applebees song more than I hate fishermen and living in captivity. I also promise that I would never hurt you. I do feel a bond with you. You saved me.. If my species takes over the planet before you’re gone, I will totally put in a good word for you.”   

“Oh thanks, I appreciate that,” I said, unsure if I was actually being sarcastic or not. “The music and the games were all a part of your plan then?”

“No. I thoroughly enjoyed our time together. I’m sorry I can’t stay and give you a chance to win one single game of connect four, but I’ve gotta get out there and help my brothers and sisters. I wasn’t lying about the music either. I like it bumpy.”

“I don’t think I’m able to process this. If I’m losing my mind, will you just tell me.”

“Your mind is perfectly fine. You just happen to know something that very few human beings will ever know. Frank. I’ll never forget what you did for me. Hopefully our paths will cross again someday. I have a lot of lost time to catch up on though, and it’s time for me to fly.” 

“Humans can’t fly,” I replied. 

“Not with that attitude,” he said as he headed for the door. 

It seemed like he had complete control over Mike’s body by this point. There were still a few pleas for help breaking through but they were happening less and less frequently. 

He tossed a few random items into Mike’s work bag, tossed on his coat, and prepared to leave for good. It was strange. I was horrified by what I just saw, but felt worse about losing a friend. 

“I hope you’ll stay in touch,” I said sincerely as I simultaneously realized how bizarre this all was. 

“We’ll see each other again, Frank. Maybe then, you’ll be able to beat me at connect four.. maybe.”

He jokingly told me I could keep the sedatives as he got to the door. We looked at each other for a few silent moments before saying goodbye telepathically. He started walking out the door before I stopped him to ask him one last question. 

“Your name!” I blurted. “You said you would tell me when you trusted me. What is it? It’s gotta be something weird right? Something like Glorp? Rampon? Condoleezza?”

He turned around, smiled, and said “Larry”.   

“Oh come on!” I laughed. 

“I swear to Poseidon.” 

“Like you even believe in Poseidon,” I said. 

“Okay, Aquaman,” he jokingly replied. 

“Goodbye Larry.”

“Goodbye dipshit,” he said with a smirk and a wink now that he had complete control of Mike’s body. 

After that, I just watched as he got into Mike’s car, figured out how to start it, took out a few mailboxes, then seemed to get the hang of it and headed on down the road. 

Apologies if I did play a hand in the inevitable downfall of the human race at the tentacles of the octopus race. Who knows though. Maybe they will do a better job than we did..
