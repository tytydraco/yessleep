“Dude, find a place to pull over. I’ve been holding in a gallon of piss for an hour now”. Isaac Hammered. “Just hold on for a few minutes, man. We should be nearing a gas station. I saw a sign”. I argued back. Isaac gives a low pained growl in response. 

We’ve been on the road headed to our camp area in the beautiful Hualapai Mountains, for 3 hours and Isaac can never retain his urine for long. “Come on man, hurry up. I know your little crown vic can go a bit faster!” Isaac yells, in frustration. 

“There it is, look! Jeez man, i told you we were close” i say, pointing at a crappy little gas station, sitting on the side of a desolate Arizona, 2-Lane highway. The old yellowed white painted brick walls, covered in dirt and grime, and the overhead pump covers falling apart. The old open sign flashing “O-EN”. 

“Josh, hurry the fuck up and pull over already!” Isaac yells at me. “God damn bro, what the hell do you think I’m trying to do, I can’t just swerve into oncoming traffic!” I yell in return at him. 

I turn into the driveway and park at a pump. I need gas anyways, i only have a quarter tank left. Isaac aggressively tries to pull the car door handle in frustration, realizing he didn’t unlock the door first. He leaves in a rush, grappling his groin. “Hehe, fuckin dickhead” i say to myself, watching his goofy ass rush inside the station. 

I open the gas lid, and pull my debit card out to pay at the pump. I put the card to the little card insert area, and wait to hear the iconic beeping sound you hear when you successfully tap to pay. I tried numerous times, not realizing that there is no option to tap to pay here. “Seriously, it’s 2025 and i cant tap to pay at the pump? How old is this place?” I say in frustration. 

I close the gas lid and head inside the Mike’s Rush Stop gas station, walking with slight frustration, gravel crunching under my feet on the old cracking black top. I pull the door and it doesn’t open. I pull harder and it doesn’t open. 

Isaac pulls the door open from his side of me, and laughs. “Haha, dumbass, it says “push”.” He walks to the car chuckling to himself at my expense. “Oh, and if you use that restroom, just know it’s got a weird vibe”. “Fuck off, and okay whatever.” I say. 

I walk to the register, grabbing a snickers bar to buy alongside gas. The clerk facing away from me, fumbling around with cigarette boxes. I stand there for what feels like 20 minutes, tapping the desk in hopes the clerk will realize I’m here. 

“Hey, uh, I’m trying to get-“ the clerk cuts me off, “How can i help you sir”. He says. I frown my mouth in a disrespected response. “Yeah…i need gas. Put $20 on pump…..3” “okay, will that and the candy bar be all for you today?” He responds. “Yeah that’ll be all”

I open the entrance door enough to yell over to Isaac. “Hey will you start the gas pump, I’m gonna take a quick dump!” He looks over at me from the open passenger door window with a dumb look on his face. “Huh?” “Can you start pumping gas? Its paid for and i have to take a shit!” I yelled back at him. He rolls his eyes and gets out of the car. 

I start towards the back of the station, for the restroom. The first thing i notice are all the old nasty stains on the floor in front of the messed up bathroom door with the dinted handle. It appears as if nobody does any kind of routine cleanup service here. 

I close the bathroom door, and lock it. I look to my right where the dirty mirror sits on the wall. I gaze upon my skinny 150lb body and 5-oclock shadowed face. My long-ish messy bright brown hair covering my left eye. I run some water on my hands and pull my hair over onto my head. Better. 

I begin to reluctantly sit on the old toilet. I put my hand in my pocket and realize i forgot my phone in the car. Great, now i gotta sit here in boredom while i crap in this old nasty public restroom. I stare at the old yellow walls and try to hurry my process. I put my face down in the palms of my hands frustratingly. 

*swish swish*. I look up in curiosity, as it sounds like something is shifting across the wall, like a hand being dragged along the side of it. I look all around. Nothing. My head goes back down to my palms. *shift shift* I quickly look up again, to see an old little painting of a farmer milking a cow swinging gently side to side on the wall. 

something just moved that painting.  I think to myself, “maybe there’s an air current” and finish my bowl movement. 

 I wipe and get off the decrepit toilet, and flush. I start towards the door but a thought of curiosity stops me. What if. What if there’s something behind that little painting. I walk the 4 feet to the wall where the painting sits. I put my hand to it, and around its edges. Theres a slight, cold current coming from behind it. Strange. 

I pull the painting off the wall, to reveal a soft ball sized hole in the wall. I gaze upon it in confusion. It appears to be infinitely deep, nothing showing up but pure darkness on the other side of it. A sound of a low breeze like wail, coming from within it like an infinitely lasting deep inhale of a dying animal. “What the fuck is this?” I say out loud to myself. 

Now i don’t know why, but something within me is tempting me to reach inside it. Maybe there’s something valuable or unique inside. I can’t figure out where this temptation is coming from, but it gets the best of me. I reach inside of it, and shift my hand around, feeling for something. Nothing. Like putting my hand in a hole with no walls or surrounding textures. 

I try to pull my hand out but cant. Im stuck. I start to panic and frantically try to pull my arm out of this mysterious hole. I start hyperventilating. The door handle begins to shift, and the clerk is on the other side. “What’s going on in there! Are you using drugs? Why do you all use drugs in there?! Im calling the police” I didn’t care, i needed help anyway and I didn’t respond. 

All i cared about was getting my arm out of this hole. It seems to be suctioning my arm stronger. I start getting light headed and dizzy, like i stood up too fast. The hazy green like noise starts to cover my vision, and i feel a pulling sensation towards the wall. I black out. 

I wake up in darkness, drenched in something liquid. I raise my head up in confusion, rubbing my eyes to try and gain some kind of visual focus. Nothing but darkness. 

I put my hand to the ground to raise my body up to stand. “What the hell?” I say out loud, as it feels like i stuck my hand in a puddle, my voice echoing all around. I realize I’m in some sort of 5 inch puddle, spanning as far as the darkness does, which appears infinitely, no source of light to be noticed. 

“I’ve got to be dreaming”. I think to myself, and i attempt my dream escape method, which consists of squinting my eyes as hard as i can, as when i open them i will awaken. Nothing. Still here in this abyss of darkness and mystery liquid on the ground. I stand up, and before i can think or react or even panic, a loud grumbling comes from somewhere above me. 

I stand still, in a sense of fear. I focus in on the noise coming from overhead. No…those are human yells. The grumbling i hear is thousands of human yells, an incomprehensible amount of voices, yelling from above me. Then it stops abruptly. I stare overhead, watching for the source, white cells in my vision dancing around in the dark above. 

Then i see it. Something grayish, breaking the darkness. It appears to  get  larger and larger as it comes closer to me. A massive closed eye lid. Im stunned staring at it. Then it opens sharply, with the speed of light. A ginormous orange iris goat pupiled eye. It shrieks with the 1000 voices of men, women and children, and shifts its position to reveal a human head the size of a mountain. 

No neck or body perceived. It shrieks that terrible sound as it opens its horrendous mouth, revealing endless rows of teeth. It begins its decent towards me, as if it wants to drop it’s mouth around me to consume me. I start sprinting ahead into the nothingness, liquid splashing beneath each frantic step. 

It lifts its upside down head to face my direction from behind its forward view. I keep running, periodically turning my head to watch behind me. As it shifts its gaze, it must have looked too far up, as it falls from the darkness into the liquid. 

It seemed to become submerged into the mystery liquid, gargling yells as it does so. Tremors beneath my feet as I continue to sprint. I run and i run until i can no longer hear the drowning screams of 1000 people. I begin to make out what seems to be a cubic shaped object ahead of me. I make a break for the formation. 
 
I jog over to the formation to witness what appears to be a bland 4 walled enclosure, with perfect matte grey walls, with one 4 pane wooden door sitting in the center of one side of this huge sized cube. I start towards the door, and wrap my hand around the perfect golden orb door handle. 

When i open the door, a dark blue light cracks from within the enclosure. I pull the door open all the way, and as i do so, the door pulls me in but i didn’t feel a pulling sensation, almost as if the formation moved around me. The door closes behind me with a loud slam that echoes around. 

I turn around to try and look at the door only to be left gazing upon an empty wall. The door is gone. I turn around to realize I’m inside of an incomprehensibly massive cube, the inside dimly lit up with a dark blueish hue. The light source is unseen, and seemingly non existent. It’s kind of beautiful, but heavily eeire. 

Along the back wall sits a huge stone throne with some kind of statue veiled in a cloak sitting upon it. I turn back around to feel along the wall, to see if maybe the door is just disguised. But as soon as i step forward to try, i become paralyzed and not by my own will. An overpowering hum and vibration envelopes my mind and body, as i lay paralyzed like a statue. 

 
“Cease your movement, creature” a deep guttural voice surrounds my being. Not coming from outside of my mind, but not coming from within it either. My mind seems fogged, i cant think clearly, and my perception is off, like a sleep paralysis type of ordeal. 
“Do not attempt combat. Do not attempt escape. Submit.” It roars once again. 
“You are within my domain. You are here accidentally. You are confused. You are scared.” 

I begin to feel a sensation in my skull, like a million worms writhing in my brain. My body rotates 180 degrees…or maybe the room does. I gaze upon an incomprehensible being, veiled in a cloak, pointing its long, grey and gaunt arm at me, the cloak falling around its pale elbow. It impossibly stretches towards my head, its long sharp nail touching my forehead now. 

The writhing worm sensation in my brain becomes more overwhelming. “You do not exist. Only I. I am the entity all beings search for. I am all that exists, and does not exist. I am you. I am the rest. Submit” i can only stare in a confused state, at this entity. No fear, no panic, no pain. I feel nothing but delirium. “You wish to return to your plain. I will grant your desire. In exchange, you are my subject. You are to collect souls, and fill my manifestation with them.” 

His other arm, raising to a point to its left. My eyes forced to gaze upon a glowing orb on the other side of the room. “Fill Yan with the souls of your plain. There is no denial. There is no deviation. You are the Neo Magus now. My servant.” A tear falls down upon my cheek. My breathing heavier. Its nails digging deeper into my skull. All i can feel now is a sensation of my brains melting. “You have been given the tools to do so. Once finished, you will be consumed. Be gone” 

 As soon as its overpowering voice finishes its sentence, i awake in the bathroom of the gas station, my head raising from the palms of my hands, as defecation leaves my anus. The light blinding my eyes as i regain focus of the old decrepit restroom. 

I frantically raise up and wipe my ass in a panic to leave this restroom. I bust out of there, without even flushing the toilet, the clerk reminding me “Hey, don’t forget your snickers!” On my way out. I push the door, but it recoils back into my face. “FUCK!” I yell out in anger, remembering that it is a pull from inside, and a push from the outside. 

I push it open and spring to my car, hastily getting inside my golden 1999 crown Victoria. Isaac sighs in relief. “Dude, what took you so long.” I ignore him, but not on purpose. I shift into drive and speed away from there. “DUDE, what the fuck happened!” Isaac yells at me. “What?” I respond. 

I realize as I’m speeding down the highway, that i cant even seem to remember. “What did happen?” I think to myself. It’s almost like a rapidly decaying dream once waking up. My muscles getting less tense as i become aware of this. “I…i can’t remember…Darkness…or screams maybe? I don’t know.” I muster back to Isaac. 

“What? Dude are you feeling alright? You’re creepin me the fuck out.” Isaac replied. “Let’s just get to the mountains, I’ll try to remember, and tell you when we get there.” I reply.
