It started with a smell. A faint, metallic tang that I first noticed on the bus ride home. I assumed it was someone else—a stranger with bloodied knuckles or rust-stained clothes—but it clung to me long after I stepped off. It followed me up the stairs to my apartment, trailing behind me like a guilty conscience.

Inside, the smell intensified.

My apartment was pristine. No dishes in the sink, no laundry piled up. Still, the metallic tang lingered. It reminded me of pennies, or the coppery taste of my own blood after biting my lip too hard.

I checked the faucets. Dry.

I checked my hands. Clean.

The smell wasn’t coming from anywhere external, and yet, it surrounded me, growing stronger with each passing hour. I opened a window, lit a candle, even sprayed air freshener, but nothing helped.

By midnight, the smell was unbearable.

That’s when the humming began.

It was so faint at first, I thought I was imagining it. A low, droning sound, like an electrical hum buried beneath layers of static. It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once, vibrating just below the threshold of audibility.

I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, the hum worming its way into my skull. It didn’t stop when I covered my ears. It grew louder, deeper, resonating in my bones.

And then came the voice.

Not a voice, exactly. Not something external. It was more like a thought—something that arrived uninvited, as though my mind had produced it without my consent.

"Are you sure you locked the door?"

I sat up, my pulse quickening. The question felt so real, so intrusive, that I instinctively glanced at my bedroom door. It was closed.

"Go check."

My chest tightened. It didn’t feel like my own thought. It felt alien, invasive. But the longer I ignored it, the louder it became, repeating over and over.

"Go check. Go check. Go check."

I stumbled out of bed, my legs shaky, and went to the front door. It was locked. I turned the bolt for good measure, then stood there in the silence, breathing heavily.

But the voice didn’t stop.

"The windows. Did you lock the windows?"

I checked them.

"The closet. Are you sure no one’s in the closet?"

I opened it. Empty.

By the time dawn broke, I was sitting in the middle of my living room, surrounded by furniture I’d pushed against every door and window. My body was trembling, my mind fraying.

The next day at work, I couldn’t focus. The hum followed me. The voice whispered, faint but insistent, intruding on my thoughts.

"She’s staring at you. She knows."

I glanced at my coworker, a woman sitting two desks over. She wasn’t looking at me.

"She knows what you did. Look at her hands."

I stared at her hands. They were perfectly normal. Typing.

"She’s going to tell. Stop her before she does."

I clenched my fists, fighting back the urge to yell. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real.

The voice grew louder over the following weeks. More intrusive. More specific.

"Do you remember that time you left him crying? Alone? In the dark?"

"What?" I whispered, my voice barely audible.

"You do. You remember how he begged. How his little hands reached for you, and you turned away."

"I don’t—I didn’t—"

But the memory came rushing back, unbidden. I was seven. My little brother was three. I had locked him in the basement as a prank and left him there, screaming, until our mother came home.

I hadn’t thought about it in years.

Now it consumed me.

The hum grew louder. The smell of blood returned, stronger than ever. And the voice wouldn’t stop.

"He cried for hours. You didn’t even care. You laughed."

"I was a kid!" I shouted, tears streaming down my face. "I didn’t mean it!"

"But you remember, don’t you? The sound of him crying? The way his voice cracked? He remembers too."

"No, he doesn’t," I whispered. "He doesn’t even talk about it."

"Because he’s dead."

I froze. My brother wasn’t dead. He was alive, married, living two states away.

"Is he?"

The voice laughed, a horrible, wet sound that echoed inside my skull.

By the end of the month, I had stopped sleeping. The voice was constant now, a relentless stream of accusations and questions. Every intrusive thought I’d ever suppressed was dredged up, magnified, twisted into something unbearable.

"You don’t deserve peace. You know that, don’t you?"

My reflection in the mirror began to change. At first, it was subtle: a flicker of movement when I was still, a shadow passing over my face. But soon, it became undeniable. My reflection smiled when I didn’t. Its eyes lingered, watching me even as I turned away.

I smashed the mirror, but it didn’t help.

I started seeing things in the corner of my vision: dark shapes, indistinct figures that disappeared when I turned to look. The smell of blood filled every room. The hum was deafening.

One night, my phone buzzed. It was a text from my brother.

"Are you okay?"

I stared at the screen, my hands trembling.

"I had a weird dream about you. You were... I don’t know. Different. Angry. I just wanted to check in."

I tried to type a reply, but my hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

Then, another text came through.

"Do you remember the basement?"

I dropped the phone.

I didn’t sleep that night.

When dawn came, I found myself staring at the kitchen knife on the counter. The voice was calm now, almost soothing.

"You can make it stop. All of it. Just one little cut."

For the first time in weeks, I felt a sense of relief.

"And maybe," the voice whispered, "you’ll finally deserve peace."
