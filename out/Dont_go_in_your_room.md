I'm still here, and I'm still scared. The fear just grows and grows, and I don't know what to do. Let me explain how it started.

It was a Friday night and I had some friends over at my place. We were just hanging out, watching some movies, and having a few drinks. It was a good time. But then, for some reason, we all decided to go into my bedroom. I don't know why, it just happened. As we approached the door to my room, I noticed that it was getting warmer. I didn't think much of it at the time.

We all walked through the door together, but as we did, something strange happened. I can't explain it, but it was like we were instantly transported to the other side. It was like walking through a portal, and it was scary as hell.

When we looked around, we realized that we were back in my room, but something was different. It was like the room had changed somehow. It was darker, and the temperature had risen even more. We were all confused and scared. We tried to go back through the door, but it wouldn't budge. It was like it was sealed shut.

We were trapped. The fear started to set in, and we didn't know what to do. We tried to call for help, but our phones didn't have any signal. It was like we were cut off from the rest of the world.

As the hours passed, the room grew even hotter. We started to sweat profusely, and the air was thick with humidity. It was like we were being cooked alive.

The strangest thing was that the room didn't feel like it was part of my house anymore. It was like we were in a different dimension altogether. The furniture had changed, and there were strange symbols etched into the walls.

It's been days since we first entered my bedroom, and we're still trapped here. Our supplies are running low, and the air is getting thinner. We're starting to lose hope.

But then, something strange happened. I noticed that my phone had started to connect to the Wi-Fi again. I don't know how, but it's like the room is allowing it. That's why I'm typing this out right now, desperately hoping that someone out there can help us.

I don't know what's going to happen to us, but I'm scared. I'm scared that we'll be trapped here forever. Please, if you're reading this, help us.
I’m trying to keep it together here, but I’m really scared. My phone is about to die, but I have to keep typing, maybe someone can help me. I have no idea what’s going on, but my friends and I are stuck in my room. We can’t leave. Every time we try to open the door, we just walk through it and end up back in my room. It’s like some sort of sick joke.

We’ve been here for hours, trying to find a way out. We’ve tried everything – pushing, pulling, kicking, and nothing works. The door just won’t budge. And every time we walk through it, it gets warmer in here. I don’t know what’s causing it, but it’s making me feel sick.

My friends and I have been talking, trying to come up with a plan, but we’re all just so scared. We don’t know what to do. We’ve tried calling for help, but our phones don’t seem to be working. The wifi is the only thing that’s still on. I don’t understand it.

The worst part is that we’re not alone in here. There’s something in the room with us. We can’t see it, but we can feel it. We keep hearing whispers, and it’s making my skin crawl. I’m not sure if it’s some sort of ghost or demon or what, but I know it’s not human.

I’m not sure what’s going to happen to us, but I have a feeling it’s not going to be good. I’m sorry for any typos or mistakes in this message, but I’m typing as fast as I can. My phone is about to die, and I’m not sure what’s going to happen when it does. I just hope that someone can help us before it’s too late.
