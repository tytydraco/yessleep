Hello first let’s get a few things out of the way I work for the government. I have worked for the government for almost 4 years. My first got the job. I wasn’t particularly excited. See I just moved from my small house and rural Oklahoma and moved far up into the mountains, I was given a job at a facility called FGP stands for the false God program basically, false gods are real well, kinda not in the sense that there are gods that are ruling over the world, but there’s a virus and this virus exist in the consciousness. It comes back find its way into peoples minds creates ideas makes them feel certain ways and they grow more followers more likely they are to end the world. As I see it there are 7 strains 


FG-1(trickster) Loki, the coyote tricksters are not particularly powerful false gods rather than gaining followers they gain power through the opposite the amount of people they can harm or make hate them this is where mythology comes into play tricksters in Native American culture often would curse those who have committed some form of sin this sin is the staring point for most trickster types to fester the virus is a free floating idea or as we call it (a Omni nondirectional consciousness string) yeah annoying but basically all false gods exist all the time no  matter what but they can’t do harm unless they have a vessel in order to infect the false god waits for a “needle” to thread basically if  a person or anything that demonstrates consciousness has a hole in their head because of a a sadness or in this case committing a sin puts a hole through what the False god would call the soul  and once taken ahold of a soul can’t be returned the false god can only be killed depending on how powerful it gets by destroying its body for trickster types this is particularly easy because tricksters work slow they plan everything so they don’t gain power as fast as the second strain 


FG-2(the salesman) often the most popular and influential type of false god I have made quite a few files on these guys they aren’t weak per say but they are very smart they often make deals with mortals by the shake of a hand the salesman will have already infected you once infected the subject may become significantly good at one specific area of study or talent this is where you often hear of legends like jimi Hendrix who die at 27 because we can’t actually track these false gods until they gain some notoriety unfortunately this leads to quite a few cases of unfortunate events and deaths across the world the reason the salesman is a pain in the ass to kill isn’t because it is dumb or weak it is because it doesn’t take full control of the vessel until 27 this is why the 27 club exists 


FG-3(creator) these are the rarest of the strains often only showing itself every so often we haven’t had a new creation myth ever since the earth was created but there are a few strains of threads hanging in the universe these are where main religions come from of course these are the most dangerous they can not be seen nor heard or felt but they will take control of not one but meany vessels all at once however these vessels don’t appear to hold any active strains of the virus they are all still free willed the only harm that comes from it is when it chooses a vessel to inhabit such as Jesus or others these false gods can implant the virus in unborn children basically creating a body for themselves and when these vessels gain followers then that’s when we need to kill them because a class 3 strain will be immortal and learns more about how it’s virus works unlike the other two strain 3 does not know they are infected in fact they feel like a normal person but these people are also a virus the last strain is the hardest to take care of because they show so much emotion and caring because they don’t know they are a creator they just think they are a person like anyone else until they die once dead the virus enters its second. Faze and “memories”  flood giving the FG a full power boost 

The symptoms of becoming a god: I have been walking through myself my body is everything around me and when I move I move between myself and my self I sweat a lot and I have nightmares of nothing I am typing this all rather sporadically so I apologize but I need to tell someone so that people know I will try and keep updating
