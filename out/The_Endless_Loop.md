The night began like any other: a quiet evening at home, the hum of my computer filling the small, dimly lit room. The rain outside tapped against the window, a steady rhythm that should have been soothing. But there was something off about that night, though I couldn’t place what it was.

I was scrolling through an obscure corner of the internet, the kind of place that felt like a secret, filled with threads discussing urban legends and forgotten mysteries. That’s when I found it: a link titled, "Watch This and You’ll Understand Everything."

Curiosity got the better of me. The thread was short, filled with comments from people who claimed their lives had changed after watching the video. "It’s not just a video," one comment read. "It’s an experience. But be warned: once you start, you can’t stop."

I clicked it.

The screen flickered to life with a low-quality video. The setting was a dark, empty room, lit only by the glow of a single lamp in the corner. At first, there was nothing remarkable about it—just silence and the faint hum of static. But as the video continued, I started to feel… watched. It wasn’t anything I could see, but the sensation was there, prickling at the back of my neck.

Suddenly, the camera panned sharply to the side, focusing on a figure in the shadows. It was humanoid but wrong. Its limbs were too long, its head tilted unnaturally to the side. I paused the video, a shiver running through me. Something about the way it moved, the way it stood there, felt all too real. Against my better judgment, I pressed play again.

The figure stepped forward, its face coming into view. Except… it wasn’t a face. It was my face. My exact likeness stared back at me from the screen, only the eyes were empty voids, and the mouth was stretched into a grotesque smile.

My reflection—the one on the screen—raised a hand and waved.

I slammed my laptop shut, my heart pounding. It had to be a trick, some kind of deepfake or algorithmic manipulation. But then I noticed the faint reflection of my screen on the black surface of the laptop. The video was still playing—my distorted double was still waving.

I threw the laptop open again, hoping to close the video, but the figure was gone. The screen showed nothing but static. I exhaled a shaky breath, trying to calm my nerves. “It’s just a prank,” I whispered, trying to convince myself.

And then my phone buzzed.

The notification was from an unknown number. It was a picture—of me, sitting at my desk, staring at my computer. The timestamp showed it had been taken just seconds ago. My blood ran cold. I looked around the room, but there was no one there. The rain outside had intensified, drumming harder against the glass, and the shadows in the corners of the room seemed deeper now.

Then the power went out.

My computer screen was the only source of light. The static had disappeared, replaced by the same room from the video—but this time, I was in it. I could see myself on the screen, standing in my darkened room, frozen in fear. Behind me, in the video, the figure appeared again, stepping out from the shadows.

I whipped around, but the room was empty. When I looked back at the screen, the figure was closer, its empty eyes locked onto mine. It pointed at me, then at the corner of the room. I turned slowly, my breath caught in my throat.

Nothing.

When I turned back to the screen, the figure was gone. But a single line of text had appeared on the video: "Look closer."

I didn’t want to. I couldn’t. But my body moved on its own, my trembling hands reaching for the laptop. The screen flickered, and suddenly, my webcam light blinked on. I saw my own face staring back at me—except it wasn’t me. My doppelgänger grinned widely, tilting its head the same way the figure had.

Then it whispered, “You shouldn’t have watched.”

The screen went black, and for a moment, there was silence. I sat there, paralyzed, waiting for something—anything—to happen. And then I felt it. A cold breath on the back of my neck.

I screamed and spun around, but the room was empty. My laptop powered itself down, the faint whir of the fan fading into nothingness. I sat in the dark, clutching my chest, trying to convince myself it was over.

But it wasn’t.

The next day, my computer refused to turn on. My phone wouldn’t stop buzzing with notifications from unknown numbers, each one showing distorted images of my face in places I’d never been. At night, I could hear faint whispers coming from the walls, growing louder whenever I tried to sleep.

And every time I passed a reflective surface, I could see it—my double, watching, waiting, smiling.

It’s been weeks now, and I can’t escape it. My reflection moves on its own, mocking me, whispering things I can’t quite hear. I don’t know what it wants, but I know one thing: it all started with that video.

So if you ever see a link promising to show you the truth, promising to change your life, don’t click it.

Some things aren’t meant to be watched.
