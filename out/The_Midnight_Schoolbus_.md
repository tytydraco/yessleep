When I was eight years old, I heard a tapping at my window. Now I was never a scared child. My dad was a self-proclaimed “weirdo” who had, maybe unwisely, shown me all of the slasher classics before my sixth birthday. This all led to the type of kid who'd watch Stand By Me and be inspired to go look for a body himself. So when I heard that tapping at my bedroom window, I swung myself out of bed. 

I was determined to investigate its source. The fact that it just turned midnight and I was awake later than I usually ever am only added to the mystique. I slid my dinosaur shaped slippers on, crept over the scattered piles of lego to the other side of my room. Just before I peeled back the curtains, the tapping stopped. This brought my curiosity to a fever pitch and I yanked the curtains open. 

The first thing I noticed was that the window was wide open, stretching the hinges as far as they could go. I was hit with a whoosh of cold air and tightened my bathrobe in response. The second thing I noticed was the long, yellow school bus in the middle of my street, parked silently at the end of my driveway. 

What compelled me next was more than childlike wonder and a keen sense of adventure. I almost felt like I was being dragged by my ear as I climbed onto the window sill and fell out of my room into the night. I was soaked by the dew-covered grass of the front lawn, it was early July and the sprinklers were on full blast, but I didn't care all that much. I got to my feet, brushing the dirt and dandelions off myself, and made my way over to the bus.

There was no hum, no rattle of the exhaust. The bus was completely silent. I stood in front of the doors and tried to peer through the glass panels. They were so thick with grit and grime that I couldn't see anything. While I had my face cupped to them, the doors swung open. I jumped back, startled. I collected myself, and finally saw the interior. 

Inside, it was barely lit enough to see. A single electric bulb dangled in the center of the aisle. I stepped onto the bus to get a better look. The seats were a maroon leather and battered within an inch of their life. The metal floor was covered in rust and black grease. As far as I could make out, there were six other children. All of them were my age, all dressed in pajamas and shivering. None of them spoke when they noticed me.

I was about to get off when a voice made me jump out of my skin. I thought the driver's booth was empty, but now I could make out the figure of someone sitting at the wheel, shrouded in shadow. 

“Are you staying on?” The person said in a gruff, genderless voice. 

The same feeling that had compelled me to climb out of my bedroom window and onto the bus likewise compelled me to reply “yes”.

The mechanical whirring of the bus doors closing snapped me back to reality. I suddenly realised my mistake. I rushed to the booth’s window and pleaded with the driver. 

“Wait, wait, I've made a mistake! It's past my bedtime! Please sir, let me off.” I argued. 

The driver sniffed and said “Can't, you've already paid your fare. Go take a seat with the others.” 

I stumbled back as the bus roared silently into motion. I ran between the seats, watching my house slowly fade into the distance. I climbed onto the back seat and saw it disappear around a corner. I realised that at the back of the bus there were two other doors. My plans of escape were smothered when I saw the red emergency handle. It was bound in chains. 

I turned to run back to the driver when I saw someone I recognised. I walked over to her seat and sat next to her. She turned to look at me and my suspicions were confirmed. It was Marcy. She'd been in my class up until the beginning of this year, when her parents pulled out to homeschool her. 

“Marcy?” I said softly. 

Marcy seemed perfectly calm. She was wearing pink pajamas decorated with a cartoon character I didn't recognise. She'd been humming to herself and swinging her legs back and forth. One of her unicorn slippers had fallen off, but she didn't seem to care.

“Oh, hiya Jake” She said, as if we'd just bumped into each other at a playground. 

“What's going on?” I asked. 

“Well, Mom and Dad told me that I had to go on this trip. They said something about a surprise party, but I don't know who's birthday it is.”

“Your parents know about this?”  I pressed her for more information. 

“Of course they do. They stayed up with me all night and brought me out to the bus when it came. Mom talked a lot with the driver. He seems nice. I think they're old friends or something.” 

I was oddly calmed by her explanation. If her parents knew, then maybe mine did. I sank into my chair as I began to accept what was going on. But there was one more question I needed to ask her. 

“Marcy?”

“Yes?”

“Do you feel sleepy at all?”

Marcy scrunched up her face in thought, then looked at me and replied. 

“No.”

I felt the same. I was up later than I had ever been yet I didn't feel tired at all. The opposite actually, I felt full of energy. Marcy started talking about something while she stroked her long, red hair, but I wasn't listening. I sat up in my seat, looking around at the five other children on the bus. From what I could make out, their emotions ranged from apathy to quiet terror. 

The bus rattled on for another twenty minutes. I felt the same feeling in my stomach as I did before a spelling test at school. I looked past Marcy and out the window. All I saw were trees. I didn't even know if we were still driving on an actual road anymore. I, and every other kid in the bus, jumped when the driver flicked on the radio. It played classical music, heavily diluted with static. After a while, the driver mumbled to himself and switched it off. 

Before long, the bus came to a halt. Instinctively, we all made our way out of the seats and up the aisle towards the door in a line. We all saw the man waiting for us outside. The doors began to open and, in single file, we made our way out. As I excited the bus, I gave a cautious glance back. The driver's booth was very clearly empty. 

The man waiting for us was surprisingly well dressed. His pinstripe suit made me instantly think of him as a banker. He looked young, but he was balding. What blond hair he had left was harshly slicked back against his scalp. I couldn't see his eyes past the circular, red lenses of his glasses. 

“Come on children”, he said in a soft, calming voice, “you're all going to come with me now. 

With that, he began to lead us deeper into the forest. The other children fired one question after another at him, who he was and why we're here. Finally, it came my turn to tug at the hem of his jacket and ask him the first thing that came to mind. 

“Excuse me, where are we going?” I asked.

He chuckled and ruffled my hair. 

“We're going to meet Oz.” He dutifully replied. 

Before I got a chance to ask him who Oz was, the particularly overweight boy next to me asked him his name. The man told us all his name was Horace, and that we should keep our questions to ourselves until we got to the party. 

I fell back a bit to walk next to Marcy. She still seemed as nonchalant about the whole thing as ever. 

“Hey Marcy, do you know someone called Oz?”

She thought long and hard and then told me that she didn't. We walked in silence for a while after that, until suddenly she spoke again.

“I know Horace though,” she said. 

I looked at her dumbfounded. 

“You know him?” I said, gesturing towards the man who was walking a few paces in front of us, now holding the hand of one of the other children. 

“Well, I don't know him,” she said with a shrug, “but he turned up at my house a few weeks ago. I'm pretty sure that was him. He just had a coffee with my parents and left.” 
She squinted her eyes thoughtfully and then said “Yeah it was definitely him. He had the same glasses on.” 

After that, Marcy went back to picking petals from a flower she'd torn from the ground. I was trying to think of another question for her when suddenly, the group came to a stop. Me and Marcy had been walking at the back, and didn't notice when the kid at the front burst into tears. Horace crouched down next to him, putting an affirming hand on his shoulder. When the boy didn't immediately stop crying, Horace grew irate. It was clear that he didn't know how to handle children. 

“What is kid?” He snapped. “Huh? Miss your fucking parents? Is that it?”

I'd gradually been desensitised to language like that at home, but the other kids around me, apart from Marcy, reacted like they'd been punched in the gut. Some physically recoiled. Horace stood up and continued. 

“Do you want candy? Will that shut you up? Here, I've got candy.” 

With that, he stuffed his hand into his jacket pocket. After some rummaging, he pulled out a crumpled packet of apple flavoured chewing gum and, in a brittle attempt to buy his silence, forced it into the sobbing boy’s palm.
Amazingly, this didn't stop his wailing. Horace sighed intensely and turned to face the rest of us. 

“Alright, everyone start moving.” He said with a wave of his hand. 

One by one, we started to follow him deeper into the forest, now driven by fear more than anything else. The boy at the front, who Marcy informed me was called Peter, had finally stopped crying. Horace kept a close eye on him. Every so often, he'd announce that we were almost there. I still didn't know what “there” was supposed to be. But as we passed through the tree line into a bizarre clearing, I found out. 

The grass was scorched. Etched into the ground was a symbol I would later learn was called a heptagram. This seven sided star must've been at least fifty feet in diameter, and was perfectly proportioned. Two dozen people in plain clothes were milling around the outskirts of the star, talking to each other or sipping from cans. They all stopped when they saw us emerging from the woods. Some clapped and cheered, all smiled. 

A man walked over to us, greeted Horace with a handshake and kneeled to talk to us at eye level. 

“Hey kids!” He said with a plastic grin “My name is Capnion. Are you all excited for the big night?”

When none of us replied, he stood up and said “I'm sure you are.”

With that he turned to Horace and whispered something to him. Horace laughed and the pair began to walk off. Capnion turned back to us and said “You all just wait patiently right there”, before following Horace to a group of men and women. I was so focused on the scene in front of me, that when Marcy spoke from just behind me, I almost had a heart attack. 

“That was my Sunday school teacher.” She said, staring blankly ahead. 

“Who?” I inquired “Capnion?”

“Yes. And his name isn't Capnion,” she told me, “It's Gary.” 

The group of us seven kids were waiting while the adults busied themselves, arranging small stones and sticks and lighting brass lanterns that dangled from every suitably sturdy tree branch. After some time, seven of the adults came over to us. They each took us by the hands and led us away from each other. The woman who came to me looked old, as far as I can remember. Her hair was a dark grey and tangled in unkempt dreadlocks. She wore a blue jacket over her floral summer dress and had more beads around her neck than I could count. Trying to put me at ease, she told me her name was Prasada. Even at the age I was then, I could tell she was lying, just like the rest of them. 

We came to a stop and I realised we were now standing on one point of the star. I looked around and saw that each point now bore a child. With that, the rest of the adults congregated in the center of the star. Prasada stood behind me, resting her hands on my shoulders. She began whispering her comfort, like my mother would if I had skinned my knee. I felt calm in that moment, like nothing could harm me. 

Prasada stroked my hair and in a low voice said “There, there Jake, don't worry. It will all be over soon.”

How did she know my name?

Suddenly, my calm facade died. I realised what I was doing and where I was. I became a bundle of nerves and started crying. Prasada tried to reign me in, but I was beyond her reasoning. I wiggled violently from her hold as the chanting of the adults reached a deafening tumult. Steam began to rise from the ground. I didn't look back when I heard the other children scream briefly, I just kept running. 

Deep and deeper still I ran into the forest. My slippers had been lost in panic and my feet were a pin cushion of pine needles. I could hear people chasing after me, barking obscenities I knew I could never repeat to my parents. Away from the light of the gathering, I was now running in pitch darkness. Every few seconds I'd be bathed in the torch light of my pursuers and I would be forced to set a new course. Finally, the darkness began to give way. 

I burst out of the treeline onto a road. Directly across from me was the neon embrace of a gas station. The automatic doors hid me inside and I didn't stop running until I reached the counter. I was met with a very confused looking woman. At seven, everyone looks like a giant. Thinking back on it, she must've only been in her late teens. I managed to articulate that I needed to call my parents. She took out her Nokia and asked me for the number. I panicked as I realised I didn't know it, but she calmed me down by telling me that we could just call 911.

A single police car turned up twenty minutes later. It was a long night only made longer by the policeman's poor attempt and trying to communicate with a child. Eventually, my parents arrived and showered me in warmth and kindness. The next morning, I woke up in my own bed, in my own house, happily thinking that the night before was just a bad dream. 

That night was the first time I feared death. It was a feeling that, thankfully, I would feel again. Until now. At the tender age of twenty-five, I have been diagnosed with stage four brain cancer. Glioblastoma multiforme. Only a quarter of those diagnosed see the end of the year. My doctor informed me bluntly that my tumor had no possibility of being removed, and the best they could do was regular chemotherapy sessions which would hopefully shrink it to a manageable size. At the behest of my already grieving parents, I took the offer. 

In this case, the treatment felt worse than the illness itself. It came with constant fatigue, mouth ulcers, the worst headaches of my life and more. A few days ago, my hair began to fall out. I opted to cut the rest off. My nurse came to me with a shaver and I joked that I'd like a number two. We laughed as she wrapped a towel around me and began to cut away the remainder of my once thick head of hair. 

Before long, she remarked “Quirky tattoo. Where'd you get it?”

I told her that I didn't have any tattoos and she joked that I must've been drinking a lot the night I got it. We laughed again, my sense of humour the one thing not affected by chemo, and she handed me a mirror. I held it out in front of me to admire her handy work. 

Engraved into my scalp was an incomplete heptagram. One of its points was missing, leaving it in imperfect symmetry. From deep within me, I realised what it will take to fill it in.
