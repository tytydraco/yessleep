I followed the same news that we all knew was so important. r/Save3rdPartyApps was my main source of information last week, and the internet actually increased my faith in humanity for just a moment as I saw groups specifically designed to tear each other apart uniting for a common cause. I loved the idea of admins experiencing shock upon learning that people resent their content being harvested for corporate profit. 

I did think that the first pop-up ads were a little strange, but the internet gremlins are constantly scraping data from my computer, so I shrugged it off.

“I’m looking at an ad for a site that claims it will explain why the Reddit Blackout is wrong,” I mentioned to my wife last week.

“What’s it say?” she asked.

“No way, I’m not clicking on it. I’m already creeped out by how closely they watch my browser history. I can’t have that on the list.”

I forgot about it until the next day, when I got a text on my phone. “Daniel, have you checked out this website? The Blackout isn’t what it seems. I’m scared.” The number was xxx-1913 [EDIT: I did *not* originally put an x in place of numbers, Reddit replaced them for me and sent a PM with a grim warning]. I don’t know who it was or how they got my number. 

That’s when I decided to stop following the Blackout news. I figured I would just hunker down and read squiggly ink lines on wood pulp until everything blew over.

I never realized that they had my address.

“Reddit: the front page of the Internet!” was emblazoned across the front of the postcard. One of those 1960s chipper-looking black and white cartoon men was smiling and giving me a thumbs-up. 

What *really* freaked me out was that he was drawn to look exactly like me, right down to the “Delora Farming Equipment” t-shirt that I only ever use for sleeping.

You know that feeling you get when you’re being watched? In a digital world, that can come in 360 degrees. No matter where I looked, I felt them from every blind spot. 

So I gave my wife a hand-written note. “Motel tonight?” Bianca gave me the exact same incredulous expression that she’d flashed on the night I drunkenly asked for a nasty salamander. But God bless her, she recognized my non-verbal urgency, so we packed and left within a few minutes. 

I didn’t want any digital footprint. So with no credit card and no cell phone, it looked odd as my wife and I checked into a fleabag motel without reservations and a wad of cash late at night. She’s much hotter than I am, so I know what the clerk was thinking, but I was beyond caring. 

I just wanted to fall asleep. 

Until I didn’t.

I had dental surgery a couple of years back, and took two Valium pills (instead of the recommended one) before the procedure, because fuck it. Lying on that motel bed, I recognized the effects of being drugged versus being sleepy.

My heart would have pounded in my chest if it weren’t so relaxed from the drugs. 

I wanted to let Bianca know that we weren’t safe, that the admins had tracked us despite no reasonable ability to do so. But I couldn’t jump up and blurt out the truth.

They were watching.

Nausea churned in my stomach like hot sauce fermenting in curdled milk. I fought to stay awake as I struggled to come up with a plan that we could execute in the middle of the night when they already knew our location and I was high as a fucking 747.

That’s when I heard the voices. 

Valium doesn’t make me hallucinate, and I know I wasn’t dreaming yet, so the sounds were definitely real.

“Yes, he just passed out. The drugs kicked in before he could start blabbing again.”

My gut froze for two reasons.

I knew that the admins were about to make their move.

And the voice belonged to my wife. 

Everything clicked into place in the worst possible way: as long as Bianca was with me, I would never be able to escape.

Our effort to show dominance over the admins has only angered them. 

I don’t know if Bianca is stalking me or is being threatened herself. I don’t know which is worse. But I had to let everyone know. 

I could tell that she was speaking on that weird-ass toilet phone they stick in some motel rooms, so I decided to check her bag and see if she’d snuck her cell phone despite my warnings. 

I don’t know why, but my heart sank further when I found it in her bag.

So I took it under the covers and typed this; from across the room, it looks like I’m still asleep.

I don’t know what to do. I’ve never been this scared.

Reddit admins, I’m sorry, I never meant to invoke your inexplicable wrath.

I will update soon if I’m able.
