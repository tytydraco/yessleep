I know I shouldn’t be writing this. I should be running. But my legs are trembling so badly, I can barely stand. My hands are slick with sweat, making the keys slippery as I type. My phone is at 3%, and I need someone—anyone—to read this before it dies.

This started three days ago.

I was coming home from my night shift at the hospital. I’m a nurse. Long hours, little sleep. I’ve always brushed off the weird stuff—flickering lights, cold spots—probably just my sleep-deprived brain. But that night was different.

When I pulled into my driveway, I saw the living room light was on. I was sure I’d turned it off before leaving. Still, I figured maybe I was wrong. Sleep-deprived mistakes. I walked in, tossed my keys on the counter, and froze.

The front door was still locked.

I moved through the house, turning on lights, checking every room. Nothing. No one. Just me, out of breath and shaking. I was about to convince myself I’d imagined it when I caught a glimpse of something in the hallway mirror.

My reflection… blinked too slowly.

I stepped closer, and my reflection didn’t move right away. I lifted my hand, and it lagged behind. Only by a fraction of a second, but enough for me to notice. I waved. It waved. A beat too late.

I don’t remember falling asleep that night, but when I woke up, there were muddy footprints leading from the front door to my bed.

I live alone.

I didn’t go to work the next day. Instead, I stayed home, triple-checking that all the doors and windows were locked. By midnight, I was sitting on the couch with every light on, scrolling through Reddit and pretending I wasn’t terrified.

That’s when I saw it.

My bedroom door—barely cracked open—slowly swung shut.

I stood. My throat felt like it was stuffed with cotton. I tiptoed to the door, hand shaking as I pushed it open. The room was empty. I let out a shaky breath and backed away—then bumped into something solid.

I turned around.

It was me.

I was standing in the hallway, barefoot, wearing the same oversized shirt I was currently wearing. Same messy bun. Same tired eyes. My chest was rising and falling in time with my own breath.

But she—it—was smiling. I wasn’t.

The copy of me reached forward, placing a cold hand on my wrist. Her grip was almost affectionate. That’s when I saw the nails. Black with dirt. The same dirt that had tracked across my bedroom floor.

She didn’t speak. Just leaned in close, pressing her lips to my ear, and whispered:

“You’re in here now.”

And then she turned and walked away, disappearing into my bedroom.

I ran. I didn’t grab my phone or my keys. I just sprinted out of the house and didn’t stop until I was several blocks away, barefoot and gasping for air.

I didn’t go home. I couldn’t. I went to my friend’s apartment and stayed there the next two nights, crashing on their couch. I didn’t tell them. I didn’t sleep.

But tonight…I came back. I had to. I needed my phone, my wallet, my car.

When I walked inside, the house was dark. Quiet. I tiptoed through the rooms, grabbing my things, ready to leave. But as I was about to open the door, I heard footsteps.

Coming from the bedroom.

And then I saw her.

Me.

She was standing at the end of the hallway, barefoot and smiling. Only this time, her face was rotting. Gray skin peeling in places. Hollow cheeks. Sunken eyes. And she was holding my car keys.

When I started to back away, she opened her mouth too wide—jaw cracking, skin splitting at the corners—and dropped the keys into her throat. She swallowed them.

I ran. I slammed the front door behind me. But when I reached the street and turned back to look at the house, she was already at the window, watching me.

Smiling with MY FACE.

I’m typing this from the gas station a mile away. My feet are bleeding, my throat is raw, and I’m shaking so hard I can barely hold the phone.

I’m afraid to go back.
But I think it’s too late.
Because when I looked into the station’s bathroom mirror just now…

My reflection didn’t blink at all.
