Hi everyone- this is my first time posting in this community on Reddit, and I’m hoping to get as many ideas/theories as possible.

This happened to me, about 6 years ago.  
I’m a very stable, late-forties, married mom of three.  I’m an American, but have lived in northern Germany with my family, in a small, relatively rural community, for 20+ years.  I know this environment very well, and am bilingual.

As I often used to do, I would load my female Labrador Retriever into my car, and drive about a mile outside of our village into the countryside a little, so my dog could get out and run free.  She was a wonderful dog, attentive and very devoted to me.  She stayed in my area when we were out in the country, and we both stayed relatively close to my car.  I would smoke a cigarette out there and she would run around.  We were always there in daylight, and sometimes there was a jogger, or a farmer on a tractor in the distance, but we were normally alone and again, this is a very safe area.  

Because I’m an American, (probably), I am nevertheless semi-hyper-attentive to my surroundings, and JIC, always carry pepper spray.  Plus, I have the big dog.   The landscape is low and sparse, brushy.  A few big scattered trees, but mostly flat marsh land- and you can see ALL AROUND YOU.  
You can see through and between the foliage, to see a rabbit run for example, and the land is vast, sparse, flat and marshy.  So we always drove down to the end of a dirt road, not into a clearing, just into a flat, low-brush, high visibility country field landscape.  

Ok.  So two things happened in this same location, with just me and my dog present, on two separate occasions.  They might seem like no big deal, but I don’t understand and although I was never frightened, I’ve always been “bothered”…. 

The first thing that happened was that I, with my dog, (she actively watched this event), observed a small brown leaf- just a regular dead, dry tree leaf, hang suspended moving only about an inch in any direction, in front of us for a least a full minute.  Let me explain:  there was no wind, no invisible spider web or filament holding it.  No tree or bush suspending it.  It “hung” moving slightly, independently, in the air in front of us, between us.  Directly in front of me, at my eye level, my dog looked up to it.  I plucked it out of the air, and we left- drove home.  
I wasn’t frightened, but it was memorable, and odd.  My dog fixated on the leaf as well.  When it was in my hand, I showed it to her directly, and as I said, we packed up and left.
But it was like watching magic, I stood there and watched it. 

Within this same time period, but on another trip to the same local location, in broad daylight, I heard someone call to me.  
Please, and I thank you for your patience, let me explain.  I won’t use my real name…
In this sparse, German rural countryside, with only my dog present, I heard this sentence:
“Julie, I can see you.”

I heard it from a specific direction, it was crystal clear to me, and I would say it sounded like “from a distance”, almost as if low-shouted, but not from too far away.  Like 100-200 yards away, was the feeling of distance/volume.  Obviously, no one was there- flat fields and low brush weeds.  Nowhere to hide or stalk.  No point of secret approach.  
Even worse, although I didn’t recognize the voice, (I would say it was “male”), it was absolutely in non-accented/native English, (so this was not a German person), and anyway there was NO person present.  If there had been, I would have of course been terrified, but my dog and I were completely alone, as far as my eyes could see.
I still can’t explain this.  
More than clearly hearing the voice, and even more than hearing my name, it was the perfect sounding neutral American English of the voice in that environment, apparently FOR ME, that freaks me out.  Do you guys get me?  I’m in the middle of nowhere in Germany…. I myself have a regional American accent.  This was a moderate tone, like a newscaster.  I know exactly what I heard.

My dog did not react to this call, this voice that said exactly what I wrote above.  She didn’t seem to register it at all.  We packed up, and went home.  
I can’t explain this.  I’m a spiritual person, open-minded, and a religious believer.  This hasn’t changed me, or even traumatized me…. But it happened just like I’ve written, and while both experiences did not feel frightening or threatening, they definitely felt strange and “other-worldly”, if you will.  
I can’t reconcile these moments.

Anything involving drugs/side effects of, mental health, audial disturbances, hidden stalkers, stress/trauma can (fortunately) be excluded from theories…. Believe me, I’ve thought about it all.
I’d love to hear what anyone thinks.❣️
