I was born an embarrassment, according to my mother.

Whenever she wouldn’t yell at me, chastise me, or starve me, she would beat me with belt buckles until their leather binds were frayed and worthless.  According to her, I was supposed to be exactly like her, and it was all my fault if I wasn’t up to par.  My mother was beautiful, slender, and was a rich, famous model.

Me on the other hand, I lost the genetic lottery.  I would always gain massive amounts of weight for no reason.

Nothing could control my endless weight gain.  

I tried keto dieting, fasting, exercising until my muscles were going to explode, everything including the kitchen sink.  There was even a time where I tried ingesting tape worms to suck the cellulite out of my body.

Escaping wasn’t going to work.  All of the staff were too scared of her to disobey and ensured I would stay permanently according to her wishes.  The last thing all of us wanted to do was piss her off.  Fighting back wasn’t going to work, either.  Whenever I called the police, they would just dismiss my claims, leading to more abuse.

I just wanted it all to stop.  The only way I could stop this was to please her.

But I couldn’t.

\---

I had forgotten how many days passed since my mom last fed me.  Even when she would provide me with meals, they were portioned so small that they couldn’t even feed an ant.

I had walked home from high school, last Tuesday, where my mother was waiting right at the door.  Her arms were folded and she was giving me a death glare that burned through me.  She handed me a jar of vomit inducing syrup.

“Drink.” My mother demanded, shutting the door behind me.

I took the opaque jar from her hand, letting its cool surface touch my lips.  Its taste frazzled and bit at my tongue, coating it in a film of pain.  I spit it back in.

“I can’t...” I said, meekly.  She rose her hand and struck me in the face.

“I’m YOUR MOTHER!  Do as you are told!  Drink, now!”

My stomach quaked and roared.  All I had to eat that day was cafeteria food so appalling that prisoners wouldn’t even give it a sniff.  

But I had to keep sustenance in me.  I couldn’t possibly last much longer if I didn’t eat.

“Drink!” She screamed.

Seeing I had no other options, I started chug the bottle.  I gagged, wanting to spit out the concoction as bad as I wanted to breath.  

My hand slipped on the edge of the bottle, suddenly.  It fell to the floor with a crack, spilling out the contents.

I pressed my back against the door, covering my head with my arms and bracing myself for what was going to come.

“You did that on purpose, didn’t you?!”  My mother roared.

In the heat of the moment, I couldn’t find any words to say and defend myself.  “M-mom! No, I-it was an-” she grabbed me by my hair, throwing me to the floor like a sandbag.  Before I could get up, she stomped on me and kicked at my ribs.  I crouched on the ground, arms around my chest, begging her to stop.  Her stiletto dug into my back, not unlike an archeologist’s pickaxe around a dinosaur bone.  

“Look at me!” She yanked up my snot and tear covered face, spraying saliva as she snarled.  “I gave birth to you!  Who fed you and took care of you every day ever since you were born?  Me.  And now you are going to pay back!  You are not going to be an embarrassment to my career!  I worked my fingers to the bone and I expect you to obey.  Do you understand?”

“Yes! Yes! Just stop, please!”

She slammed me down when she had enough with me.  “And wipe the gunk off your face.”

I ran upstairs and shut the bathroom door in a rage.  My hands turned red while I clenched the porcelain sink.  The blood and heat from my body congealed into my face.  Cold water cleansed my skin and made it turn back into its natural shade of apricot.  Rolls of fat from jostled around, their sound resembling taunting.  I bit my lip until blood was drawn.

“Worthless piece of shit!” I choked on my tears.

I would not deal with this mistreatment.  Fighting her was a no-go as I said before; she was thousands of times stronger than me.  Taking on her would be like a baby trying to take on Bruce Lee.

If I didn’t lose weight, this torture will only continue.  What was I going to do?

I ran into my room, shutting the door.  Cracking my cheap laptop open (my mom refused to give me anything useful unless I “behaved,”) I scrambled through the webpages, tears clouding my vision.

Every time I moved on to the next link, it would remain stuck for several minutes.  I shouldn’t have been surprised; my laptop was slower than a tortoise on ketamine. Each refresh would only bring up countless clicked web links.  

So many failed attempts at trying to lose weight.  

I pounded a fist against the bed sheet.  Hours passed.  

There was no solution in sight.  

After time flew by like an arrow, I finally found an unclicked link.  A black website pulled up with the words “Looking to lose weight?  Try spirit therapy!”  

There was still hope I could please my mother.  My tears dried.  A laugh bubbled up in me, but I shut my trap before I could alert anyone.  

In red, there was a list of instructions.

*STEP ONE: DRAW BLOOD FROM YOUR INDEX FINGER.*

My mom wouldn’t allow me to keep any knives in case I ever got any “ideas,” so I took out a nail clipper, pressed the razor jaws against the swirl on my index finger, bit down on my pillow, and snipped off a chunk of skin.  The metallic liquid covered the print in crimson.

*STEP 2: RUB THE BLOOD AGAINST YOUR HANDS AND KEEP THEM TOGETHER IN A PRAYER.*

I smeared the wound across the palms of my hands.  Liquid started to coagulate and turn into an almost gluey substance.  I put them in prayer, clicking my tongue in satisfaction.

*STEP 3: KEEPING YOUR HANDS TOGETHER, SAY THE FOLLOWING WORDS:* 

*Like the moon will eternally wax and wane,*

*I have been forced to live a life in unheeding pain,*

*Spirits from beyond the crimson veil,*

*Whose mission it is to help those who fail,*

*I summon you all and ask for a hand,*

*End my suffering at once as that is my command.*

After saying those words, I closed my eyes and let the magic do its work.  When I reopened them, nothing had happened.  I broke down in tears once again.  My nightmare was going to continue.

*POUND, POUND, POUND!*  “Get going, Nora!  Meet me in the bathroom so I can fix you up!  I have a photo shoot in a private park at 7:00!”  It was my mother.

“Coming!” I wiped the tears away and rolled my eyes at the door.  If I was caught crying in front of all those people, I was guaranteed a punishment.  

I got up, a blur shooting past the outside of my window.  It left a motion trail where it had passed.  I rubbed the tears out of my eyes.  The flash was gone.  The only thing that could match the blur’s color was the sunset.

\---

Twilight shined through the autumn forest.  A snow white drape covered the golden leaves.  Dozens of magazine photographers stood around her in a semi-circle.

I wore a slender ruby dress covered in glittering sequins while my mother wore a dress beautiful gold skirt with a dandelion yellow corset and sashes to match.  Flashes of cameras blinded me.  With each flash, she would strike pose after pose.

“This is how you are supposed to model, Nora!  Watch and learn!” She said, smiling at me and waving to the photographers.

It took everything I had for me to not punch her in the teeth.

I walked away, hoping to release some steam.  There was no way I was going to be anywhere near that two-faced whore any longer.  I took off my high heels and let my feet flatten against the ground.

*Rustle, rustle…*

Between the chatter far away, the leaves started to crunch while I was standing still.  I turned back to the crowd, hoping my mother was not looking for me.  I ran off until the crowd was not visible.

*Scratch, scratch, scratch…*

I did a double take at the canopies.  The sun was on the fringe of the horizon and darkness was starting to surround the park.

From the corner of my eye, a clump of bones, muscle and hair landed with a wet thud against the ground.  Its crimson form crumpled to the dry earth like an oversized raindrop.  

Then came another falling from the sky.  

Then another and another until half a dozen shriveled and bony figures peered at me.  Their sockets were empty with nerves hanging while their eyelids were permanently stitched open.  All their mouths were covered in sores.  Ribs poked out from their chests that cracked and rattled, similar to the bars on a broken xylophone, as they paced forward.

My muscles locked in place.  I turned to the photographers.  Making a blind move, I sprinted towards them.  I didn’t care about what my mother would do to me for my ignorance. 

The only thing I wanted was safety.

“Somebody help-!” stone cold fingers clamped my jaw shut.  Hands ripped apart my dress, pressing my back against the dead grass.  Like a pack of wolves bringing down an elk, they climbed all over me, covering my mouth to prevent me from crying out.

Once they had immobilized me, their lipless mouths opened into a white void.  The sound of deep inhaling whistled through my bones, passing through my cells not unlike a river passing through rapids.  

My breath was eaten away, slowly being erased from this world.  They opened their mouths further and further, trying to absorb everything from the atmosphere.  Their jangly heads creaked with each inch closer they drew.

I closed my eyes, hoping it would all be over.

To my surprise, the figures had left.  By the time I spun around to investigate, they already took off into the night.  My arms and legs were covered in thin purple bruises where those bastards had pinned me.  Activity from the photographers had vanished and the rest of the camera crew, too.

“Nora!” My mother exclaimed, observing those that might be watching.

Covering my middle finger with my other hand, I frowned.  She immediately embraced me in a hug.  

I was not going to accept anything from her.  It was always just another lie.

She then hissed into my ear.  “We will deal with your actions when we get home, missy!”  My mother looked around once more.  “I’m so glad you’re safe.”  

I silently groaned.

She ran her fingers across my waist, taken aback suddenly.  Her mouth was agape.  “Nora…My god…Look at your body!  You’re beautiful!”

My eyes turned down at my form.  The rolls of fat were flattened.  I felt my face.  The contours were in tune and no longer flabby.  My limbs were slender as twigs.

I began to giggle at my new form.  The treatment worked!  After every second, that laugh grew heartier and louder.

“Come on, sweetie.  Let me make you some soup when we get home.”  I gave her a nervous smile, trying to scout for any strings she might have attached to her proposal.  Even if she did live up to her promise, what was I supposed to do?  Was it going to be a trick?

\---

*FIVE DAYS LATER*

For once in my life, my abuse was going to end…

Or so I thought.

My mother proceeded to smack me with a ruler.  “You’re a fucking slut!” She barked.

“All you ever do is stand in my way!  Why don’t you ever obey the simplest orders?!”

After countless hours of abuse, she sent me up to my room for bed.

I didn’t understand.  

For once, I was able to give her what she wanted after years of being unable to please her.  Yet, now the abuse remained.  What was I going to do now?

As I retreated to my quarters, I tucked myself in and closed my eyes.  The pillow turned moist from the tears falling from my eyes.

The lights were shut off automatically some hours later.  I could occasionally hear the footsteps of the passing guards, but drifted off without minding them.

*Creeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaak…*

I awoke, jutting up from the covers to investigate the noise.  The window was ajar.  

“Didn’t I lock it before I went to bed?” I said to myself.  I quickly closed it and gazed outside.  Lights from the lamp posts illuminated the streets.  Outside from some yapping coyotes or stray cats, the night was still.

I blinked, lazily shutting the window and shades before crawling back in bed.  

My eyes were closed not for fifteen seconds when a depression developed on my bed.  Arising once again, I woke up, only to see the six rusty figures from five days ago at the park.  

Their mouths open and slobbering.  One of them was already nose to nose with me.  Their cold fingers wrapped around me as they all forced my mouth shut once again and opened their mouths to deeply inhale the air.  As a shroud of grey mist entered their mouths, I passed out.

\---

My fingers rested in between a ribcage of some sort when I woke up.  Were those bastards back for more?  I yanked off the covers, hyperventilating.

“No.  It couldn’t be…” I whispered.  My skin was shrink-wrapped around my frail frame.  I touched my head, feeling the notches on my skull.  My hair was left in clumps, my scalp resembling a worn out porcelain doll.

I ran over to the wall mirror, screaming in horror.

My beautiful form was gone.  All the muscle in my body had vanished, leaving me with nothing but a starved skeleton.  I sliced off some skin with the nail clipper, putting the blood on a glucose monitor.

My sugar levels were normal.  Those creatures were responsible for leaving me like this.  Doctors wouldn’t be able to solve my condition; I had to talk to a professional that knew about the demons that stalked me.

I typed in the location of the nearest psychic, clambering out the window and sneaking away from the cameras towards the city.  In times like those, I wish I were allowed to drive.  When I was a far enough distance away, I paused.  

Should I try and call the police?  I decided not to even bother.  My mother would just fabricate another lie to get them to buzz off and I would just be abused again.  The fact that the staff at the house were on my mother’s side did not help.  Besides, it wouldn’t help my situation with the demons.  I was certain that if I didn’t get everything figured out, the specters would kill me.

Before I continued further, I scanned my surroundings in case they would show up.  When they didn’t, I continued my search.

\---

I brushed aside the bead screen entrance, leading to a gold leaf coated room filled with exotic fabrics, cushions, and black curtains.  Surrounded by an igloo of pillows was an old woman in a hood with the symbols of the Greek Zodiac tattooed on her face.

“What brings you here?” The psychic inhaled a puff of smoke from her pipe and blew a ring at me.  I waved it away. 

“You know about the supernatural, right?  I’ve been stalked by these…I don’t know…scraggly, crimson…things.  Please help me!  I’m beginning to waste away!”  I turned towards the bead screen.  If I stared outside long enough, I could see their crimson shapes lurking outside and waiting to strike.  “Are you going to read my palm or look at a crystal ball or stuff like that?”

The woman just stared at me.  “Very funny.  Take a deep breath.”

I did as I was told.  A smooth rectangle formed from her smoke, bending around my face.  Ink from her zodiac symbols dripped off and tapped my forehead.  Then, the smoke cleared.

“Why the hell would you summon demons like that?!  Everyone knows demons hate humans!  There better be a good explanation!” She said, leaning in and taking off her hood.  Long silver hair draped from her scalp.  She was shocked, but her narrow eyes indicated that she wanted to hear more of my story.

“You see, I was trying to lose weight, but I couldn’t figure out any reason why.  I had to do what I could!  It worked for a while but now it ended up like-“

“Say no more.  I have an explanation.  You actually don’t have any physical conditions that led you to gaining this much weight.”

I rested my heart on my chest.  “Good to know.”

“It’s spiritual.  You see, humans sometimes have souls that are way too big and have to shed away access material.  Sometimes it comes up as nosebleeds, extra dandruff, and in your case, fat.  The demons helped stabilize your condition, so you won’t have to worry about weight gain again.  The bad news is those demons you summoned are not trying to help you,” she explained.

“Then what were they trying to do?”

The seer gave me a cold stare.  “Look for a meal.  They feed off of human souls.  Sounds like you were tricked by the website owner.”

I gasped. “Is there any way that I can stop them?”

“I wouldn’t say stop them.  More like repel them.  You must consume human flesh to ward them off.”

My blood dropped to my feet.  “I beg your pardon?”

“You have to consume just one bite in order to keep them away.  Keep at it until the beasts leave you alone.  You can either drink someone’s blood or eat any part of their body.  They can also be dead or alive.”

I was not about to turn into a cannibal.  Vomit rose up from my stomach, stinging the back of my throat.  “Well, there has to be other ways I can ward off those beings!  Please tell me that there is another way!”

She shook her head.  “I don’t know what else to tell you.”

I stared at my frail form, my eyes beginning to water.  There were no other options.  I clenched a fist.  I paid the fee for the psychic, and headed home, realizing it was getting late.

\---

That night, I snuck out of my window once more, heading into the garage and picking up a shovel.  Before any of the cameras could detect me, I ran off.

It took me a half an hour to reach my destination, the city’s graveyard.  Pausing for a moment to catch my breath, I paced towards the nearest grave stone.

In the distance, I could see the crimson forms plopping to the ground.

The demons were back.

Adrenaline made me dig up the hole faster than I thought was possible.  I turned around as three more dropped to the forest ground and ran through the foggy night.

“Come on!” I said.

Dirt flew away from the hole, leaving a pile right beside it.  I began to sweat as the last two fell to the ground like ripe fruit and sprinted towards me like quarterbacks in the Super Bowl about to score a touchdown.

*Clunk.*

My shovel hit the hard, polished, maple coffin.  I pried it open, revealing a bloated corpse that reeked of decay.  Maggots ate at his insides.

I puked by the side.  The monsters sprinted even closer, around fifty feet way.

Closing my eyes, I yanked out the dead man’s liver.

They were not ten feet away when I bit into the bitter, juicy slab of meat.  Purple vortexes surrounded the beasts as they were violently dragged back to the netherworld they came from.

I started sobbing.  I covered up the hole I made, taking the liver with me and hiding it in a plastic bag, and headed home.  It was obvious I was going to need to consume more flesh and I didn’t have the heart to perform that disgusting operation again.  I don’t know exactly if there is an afterlife, but I hope the dead man can forgive me from the heavens.

I pulled out my phone.  It was emergency services.  I hesitated for a second, until I developed the courage to pick it back up.  

To my luck, I found out that my mother got into a horrible car accident while trying to chase after me, and ended up quadriplegic.

And just like that, her life and reputation, shattered in seconds.

\---

Days later, I was able to take all the camera evidence and finally turn it in to the police.  Now that my mother was finally bedridden, she was powerless.  Those staff that once feared her now started to stand up to her.  Not long after, she was sentenced to prison for her atrocities and would remain in the jail hospital in intensive care for a long time.

I started having much more freedom than before.  I never felt like I deserved it, though.  For days after that accident, I felt like my mom would pop out of the corner, giving me another lashing.  But after dealing with her verbal abuse for so long, I began to get used to it, knowing now that she, for once, wouldn’t be able to do a damn thing.

As time went on, I began to run out of the dead man’s liver.  I needed a quick supply of human flesh, stat.  Despite being harmed by someone for so long, I would not dare hurt an innocent human.  The only reason why I ate that liver was because I needed to ensure that those demons did not consume the rest of my soul while it was still healing.

Then, I got an idea today.

I walked into my mother’s room, where she laid on her white sheet bed with several other beaten prisoners.  One of the prisoners I had tipped off gave me a shiv, which I hid behind my back.  How was I able to get it past the guards, you ask?  I don’t have a clue.

“Is it time to feast yet, darling?  I asked you to bring me a meal today since you were visiting,” my mom said, smiling and trying to perform an innocent act.

“Don’t call me that,” I returned a smile and took the shiv.  My brow furrowed.  I let out a chuckle, seeing her terrified expression.  I gripped her side, pinching off some of her skin on her side and covering my hand, holding the knife in my right.

“What are you doing, Nora?!  Stop it!” she ordered.  I put a finger on her mouth.

Aligning the knife with the skin, I stared at her sinisterly.  For those who are wondering why I don't regret using demons to help me lose weight, you are about to find out.

“You’re damn right mother, it is time to feast,” I smiled as I sawed off part of her skin and abdomen muscle and devoured it.
