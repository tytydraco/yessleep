I grew up in a small town set in a “bowl” of mountains in the Appalachians. There was one 30 minute drive over the east mountains that you could take to get to real civilization. But for the most part we stayed in Cat’s Head. No one could really say why it was called that, some said it was the name of an old moonshiner who had a cabin somewhere in the mountains, others said it had something to do with the Indians but didn’t know why. I didn’t know then but I know now that people didn’t get old here often, round here most people don’t know that there’s anything else besides blue collar work. You work here till you can’t work anymore then you take up your garden and live the simple life for the few years you got left.

CHAPTER ONE 

It was the beginning of fall, the time when we get a few lost tourists driving into town trying to find the Blue Ridge Parkway. I never understood how they wind up here in Cats Head you’d think at some point in the drive to nowhere you’d realize your mistake but I always supposed the parkway is a bit of a drive to nowhere.

I was 25 years old, sworn in the year before by the new Sheriff John Whitaker. He was the only candidate as he was the only Deputy at the time the old Sheriff had tragically passed away in a car accident . So he was a shoe in. Although young, John was a good man, we grew up together. He was a few years older than me and if it weren’t a town that you didn’t know everybody we might’ve been mistaken as brothers. Both blonde hair blue eyed and dimples that the our mothers always said ladies would love but seeing as I didn’t have a highschool sweetheart anymore I figured I was out of luck in that department in this town. 

I got to work that day and John was already in our patrol car, an old lifted jeep. Not great for transporting criminals but we didn’t do that nearly as much as we had to off-road to get to houses much like the one we were about to go to.
“Get in we gotta go up the mountain to the Johnson’s house. Had a call on the answer machine that sounded like Genny Johnson.” John told me as I got out of my car.

“Did he taste too much of his latest batch of moonshine?” I asked semi-jokingly as he was known to drink his product and slap Genny around. He used to be able to get out of jail by promising to give the old Sheriff a batch of shine. I suppose it was sort of posting bond but it wasn’t something John was gonna put up with now that he was Sheriff.

“No all she said was “He’s dead please get up here”

“Damn, no name or information? You’re sure we are going to the right place?” I asked as we pulled onto the road with the lights and sirens on.

“If I didn’t know her distressed voice by now I wouldn’t be much of a cop”

We drove up the small two lane that lead back towards the real civilization of Henderson County before turning off and heading up a small dirt road that lead to the Johnson’s. An abandoned car with out of state plates sat part way in the ditch beside the road a white shirt hung in the window.

“Was there a call about this car?” I asked 

“No but who calls 911 about running out of gas? Plus unless you know our offices number 911 calls go to the next town over so we probably would never hear about it. I’m sure they hitched a ride to town and will get back here when they can.”

“I suppose that’s true. Just figured tourists would be the first to call us over being the dumbass that forgot to fill up before the parkway.” I laughed.


We pulled up to the Johnsons house and got out of the car walked up to the house and knocked on the open door.

“Sheriffs Office!”

No reply. No movement in the house. 

“Go check the shed I’ll check the house.” John ordered.

I headed around the back walked up to the shed. It was a small plank barn with the door open. Normally Kenny Johnson kept it padlocked as his beloved still was in there. “Sheriffs Office!” I called as I walked to the door but there was no movement or response again. I walked in the door, the smell hitting me before my eyes realized what I was looking at. 

There was Kenny Johnson the moonshining wife beater. His body laying next to his still, his chest ripped open and his intestines were hanging from the rafters like streamers at a party. 

I’ve seen my share of bodies in the short time as a Deputy but this made me spew my breakfast all over the grass outside the shed. I ran back to the front of the house just in time to see John step out of the open front door and do the same as me. 

“J-john it’s bad, Kenny is-is, I-I don’t know what I just saw.” I puked again the image of Kenny’s body flashed in my mind.

John stood up wiping his mouth. “Gennys no better” he pulled his phone out and quickly put it away. “No service” he paused a moment before putting his hand to his nose and going back inside. I followed him in covering my nose. He went and got on the landline phone dialed 911 and began talking with the dispatcher as I turned the corner into the living room and saw Gennys open mouthed empty but terrified gaze right in front of my face. Her head had been skewered on a nail that had previously held their wedding picture that now laid on the floor broken frame. Her one arm hung limply by her side, her other arm now detached lay on the floor on the other side of the room looked as though it had been ripped clean off and thrown. The once blue nightgown she had on now was almost completely crimson from the blood that had poured from her empty socket. 

I stepped back consumed by shock and slowly walked outside. John followed after a while.
“Mike? Mike?” John shook me and I awoke from my thoughts realized he had been trying to speak to me. “I said they’re gonna send some guys from Henderson County hopefully should be here shortly.”

I- I’ve never seen anythi-“

“I have.” John interrupted

“What?” I looked John in the eyes.

“Sheriff Dunlap. The town was told it was a gruesome car accident. He was in his car when he ran off the road and hit the tree. But that’s not what killed him. I found his footprints heading back up the hill  before they stopped and then I found him in a tree about 50 feet back into the woods past the wreck. His body was mangled just like this. Bite and claw marks all over his body. 

“Bite and claw marks?” I asked. I hadn’t noticed anything at the time.

“There was bite marks on Gennys arm and her back had been clawed to ribbons.”

“I’m s-sorry I didn’t take a real look before I had to get out.” I stuttered.

“I get it Mike.” He said trying to keep me from going back into complete shock. “Anyways I tracked the beast that got Dunlap as best I could but I lost the trail about a mile from the wreck. The paw prints were huge. Bigger than any print I had ever seen. Just like these.” He pulled me back into the house and pointed at the floor. 

There was a few huge cat paw print about 12 inches around. Following the prints out the door I saw one print in the mud a distinctive “X” scar right in the middle of the pad. 

“What is that?” I asked.

“The Panther”

“Like a black panther that everyone has grown up hearing wives tales about?”

“Sort of. But this one is real and it’s not just some black mountain lion that people say they’ve seen. This one is older than even those myths. It’s the same monster that hunted the early Indians.”


“So it’s thousands of years old?” I asked sarcastically trying to make myself feel a little better about the scene I’d just witnessed

“I-I don’t know all I know is it’s old a lot older than is natural or even possible. When we get done here there’s something I should show you.”

Some Deputies from Henderson county came over and did the entire report for us knowing we weren’t equipped for an investigation like this. One of the Deputies told us if we need help hunting this beast down he could come out on when he’s off if we get any idea on where it lives. EMS took the bodies into custody and brought them back to Henderson county where the nearest hospital is. We thanked them all and left. 

On our way back down off the mountain I remembered the abandoned car at the bottom. 
“You think whoever’s car that is-is okay?” I stuttered picturing another scene like the one I had just witnessed.

“I don’t know we can take a look around”


We stopped past the car and John ran the tag as I got out and looked around. Nothing out of the ordinary. Really did just looked like he ran out of gas and presumably got a ride into town. I got back in the car.
“His names Christopher Murphy address listed out of South Carolina. You find anything?” John said.

“Nothing”

“Alright well let’s go.” John said turning back onto the road out of town. It was our policy to let a car sit for a week before we towed it as we had with many other cars along this road.

“Where are we going?”

“Something I found hunting that thing.”

“Is this where Dunlap died?”

“It’s close”

He pulled the car over about 5 miles down the road and got out grabbing the rifle from its locker. I got out of the car and followed him. We hiked in silence for about 30 minutes before coming up to the mouth of a shallow cave. John pulled his flashlight and lit up the interior. We walked in to the cave and John put the beam of his flashlight on the wall.

“Look familiar?” He asked 

An ancient painting of a paw I the middle of the pad was a very distinct “X” along with a picture of a black cat beside the print was a circle of stick figures around a fire maybe dancing or doing some other ritual. I nodded in acknowledgment.

“I saw the same print in the mud when I found Dunlap. I had hoped it was just a strange coincidence at the time but now I know it’s the same beast. I brought you up here to prove it to you and to convince myself. I hoped I’d find something I missed the first time.” 

“I don’t see anything else here.” I said.

“No but it did give me an idea. We can go to the reservation and see if they have any idea what this is.”

We hiked back down to the jeep. My head filled with the thought of some mythical beast hunting in our backyard.

“We have about 4 hours of daylight left and the reservation is 3 hours away. It may be a late night. I can drop you off at the station if you want but I’m going with or without you.” 

“I’ve never been out that way and I got nothing more important than this to do. Let’s go.”


Chapter two


“We’re here” John woke me up. I hadn’t realized how tired I was when we got in the car and I must’ve passed out immediately.

We went to the Tribal Police Department told them our story and although they did not seem to believe that it was some mythical beast they did give us a name and address for someone who might help. We thanked them and headed to the address and knocked on the door after a few moments an older man opened the door.

 
“Can I help you?” The old man angrily croaked. It was quite late I realized.

“Are you Mr. Gawonii?” John asked.

“Yes, is there a problem?” 

John held up his phone with the pictures of the painting in the cave along with the footprints from the scene.
“Do you recognize these?”

The old man stared at the pictures his eyes showing some recognition. 

“Come in and sit.” He opened the door and we sat at his table.

“He has come back.” Gawonii said solemnly.

“These are the third killing that I have found in two years.”



“If there have only been three that you have found then you haven’t been looking hard enough.” 

Hearing this my heart sunk. I thought of the bodies of the Johnson’s and then I thought of all the abandoned cars we had towed since I started. Were they all dead and we never searched for them. Why were we never told, did no one ever look for them? Were there locals that were mutilated in their homes like the Johnson’s were? Who had I not seen in town recently?


“We call it Anisahoni. It has been here even before my people claimed this land it was a mountain lion cursed by the Gods for reasons unknown turning it black as the night and giving it eyes of fire. It was a vicious monster that brought my people almost to extinction until the tribes Ayunini created a ritual to fend off the beast. But it had costs. The people of the land could not grow old. The Anisahoni would feed on their spirit instead of their flesh.”

“Has the ritual worn off? Why would attacks start again?” I asked.

“It is possible. It would not be the first time. The Anisahoni had attacked my tribe not long before we had been moved to this reaervation. It was believed that my great grandfather had finally killed the Anisahoni and done what others before him had failed to do. He severed Anisahonis head and the tribes Ayunini placed the head in the ground near where your settlers built the town.”

“Cats head.” I blurted out barely loud enough to hear. I recieved a glare from John. I apologized and looked down into my hands.

“They burned the rest of the body in one final ritual. With time my people began to grow older again and it had seemed like the Anisahoni was gone for good. But I suppose when the government moved my people they moved it off the Anishoni’s hunting ground. That’s why we recieved our old age back.”

“So how could it come back?” John asked confused.

“Do your people live long?” Gawonii asked.

“I mean I don’t think I’ve heard of anyone in our town living much past 70 so I suppose not.” John said.

“Perhaps the Anisahoni has been feeding on your peoples spirit since mine were sent to this reservation.”

“So what can we do?” I asked.

“We can try to kill it again. There was belief that it had worked the first time. Perhaps we can find a way to finally put the Anisahoni to death for good.” The old man said. “I will speak with the other elders and I will call you as soon as possible.” 

“Thank you so much for your help Sir.” John said as we got up and left the house. 
“You drive I need to sleep” John said tossing me the keys and getting into the jeep. The sun had set long ago. I drove home with much on my mind. My whole view on my life had changed in just a few hours. And fucking Genny Johnson’s face was burned into my brain.

I pulled into the station and went inside. I was exhausted. I went into our single empty cell and collapsed onto the bunk. John apparently also decided that he wouldn’t bother going home tonight either. He sat in his chair propped his feet on his desk and passed out. I noticed the light flashing on the answering machine as my eyes closed themselves and I drifted off to sleep.

Chapter Three 


“Get up Mike” John said sternly as he was scribbling on a map of the county. 

“What are you doing?” I asked rubbing the sleep from my eyes and grabbing a cup of the shitty coffee John had made. 

John said nothing and hit the answering machine.
“You have 3 new messages”
“September 29th 2014 at 09:44 PM Hey Sheriff it’s Don King, I heard some shit going on up at Roger’s house sounded like some woman screaming bloody murder I don’t know it just seemed like something you should check out. Beeeep”

“September 29th 2014 at 09:57 PM Hey this is Henderson County Dispatch we just got a 911 call that maps to a house on the far side of your county belonging to a Donald King it was a deadline so we attempted callback multiple times bur didn’t get an answer. Beeep”


September 30th 2014 at 0124 AM John it’s Erica I think something happened to Jessica she’s not answering my calls and I heard something down there about 2 hours ago can you check it out in the morning? Thank you. Beeeep”

“Fuck.”

“I already called Henderson county. They’re gonna send some Deputies out to help deal with this. I’m leaving this for them to pick up.” John said not looking up from the map.

“Where are we going first?” I asked still rubbing sleep from my eyes.

“Where do you think?”

Erica was John’s highschool sweetheart who had since fallen out of touch and Jessica was John’s sister. I knew the answer to my question before I asked it but he was taking this a lot calmer than I would have so I wasn’t sure. 

I knew what we were going to find while we were heading up there. John was silent. His white knuckled hands gripping the wheel.

We pulled up to the house John sprung out of the car and didn’t bother doing a callout as he barged into the house. 

I followed after him gun in my hand. 

I found him in the mess that was once a bedroom crouched over the crumpled remains of Jessica Whitaker a woman I had always looked up to she was a big sister to John and I both. She was a Marine and had been able to put up a good fight. As good a fight as you can put up in a cramped bedroom I suppose. There were tuffs of black hair and blood of the panther all over the room. She looked like she was sleeping peacefully. The pool of blood under her said otherwise. A large bite in her side was her only fatal injury. I picked up a bit of the hair. It looked as though it had been slashed off not ripped but there was no knife to be found. I could see the handgun that had been in the bedside table that now lay on its side in the middle of the room. The pistol had slid under the bed. 

“Are you gonna be alright?” I asked. 

“When this thing is dead.” He said standing up. I could see the tears in his eyes. 
“She probably saved a lot of lives. I mean we didn’t get anymore calls after her attack maybe she injured it enough to make it go lick its wounds for the night.”
He turned and walked out of the house quietly. I left him alone and got on the  phone and called in EMS to pick up the body. I went to the car grabbed the camera and took some quick pictures for the later report but I knew we wouldn’t be staying here too long.


When I exited the house all I could hear was the faint crunch of leaves up the mountain. John was already about 100 yards away tracking the blood and turned up leaves from the injured and fleeing panther. Before I could follow I saw a patrol car pulling up the Deputy rolled down the window and called out to me. 

“Hey bud I answered a call for you guys while we were there picking your map. Some guy from Cherokee said he needed you to call him something about a solution or something.” He handed me a scrap of paper with a number written on it.

I thanked him ran after John.

“John! John! Gawonii found a way to kill it.” 

John turned “What do we need?” Seemingly angry that I had inturrupted his hunt or possibly his thoughts.

“I-I don’t know he asked us to call him back” I spat out quickly.

I handed John the paper. He pulled his phone out and dialed the number.

“What do we need to do?. John asked 

“Uh-huh” 

“Okay see you soon”

He put his phone back into his pocket. John picked up a few sticks and made them into an arrow on the trail of the panther and then turned a walked past me back to the car.

I followed quickly and we both got in the jeep and head down the mountain towards town. 

“Whats the plan?” I asked scared to upset the man who was normally stoic but now looked like he could break down at any second.

“Do you have any silver? We need to make some bullets.” 

“I think so.”


Chapter Four 

I pulled the box from under my bed and retrieved a roll of silver quarters that had been given to me as a birthday gift as a child. I ran back outside and hopped into the jeep. John threw it into reverse and flew back down my driveway.
We were on our way back to the station when I asked again how he was holding up. 
John coldly said “I’m fine” 
I know he was lying but it was nice to know he was still with me and hadn’t  completely broken mentally.

We rode in silence the rest of the way to the  station. John got out and immediately went into the garage. I didn’t go in there much, never had much need. It was used as impromptu evidence storage and was full of boxes of reports dating all the way back to the 70’s. John threw some boxes out of the way exposing an old reloading press and beside it a metal kiln. He brought a propane tank over and attached it to the kiln and started it up. I opened the garage door without a word.

We had the bullets made before Gawonii arrived. We had 16 rounds of silver 30.06. I loaded up them up in our old riot control rifles from the 50s. Two surplus M1 Garands that the Sheriff at the time, a former paratrooper had “relieved” from the Army before he got out. I then loaded them into the Jeep.

Gawonii arrived escorted by a tall sturdy man with a knife in his belt named Kanati. Gawonii explained what he had found out to the group.

“The curse laid on the Anisahoni is similar to that set on the Wendigo so we will treat it as such. Silver bullets should kill it and if they don’t we will try fire.”

John called up Henderson  County.
“When your Deputies finish up the investigations over here ask them to spend the night at our station. If they do not hear from us by noon tomorrow they need to evacuate the town I’ll leave my list of all the citizens on my desk. Thank you.”


We all packed whatever gear we thought we might need and got into the Jeep and headed back towards Jessica’s house. 

“I’m sorry about your sister Sheriff.” Gawonii said solemnly. I had told him before we got in the car.

John glanced at me.

“She’s in a better place.” Gawonii continued.

“She’s in a broken pile on the floor in her bedroom” John said through gritted teeth. I could see tears building in his eyes. 

“She no longer belongs to this cursed world. Her spirit is free. She walks with your ancestors now.” 

“We’re here” John said coldly as he pulled into the driveway. 

“Please do not curse yourself because of  what this Demon has done.” Gawonii pleaded.

We got out of the jeep grabbed our rifles and gear and started up the trail passing the “X” John had made earlier. We tracked the long dried blood trail all day. We were deep into the mountain to the west of town when the sun finally set. Turning on our flashlights we continued on at a slower pace. 

By about 0100AM we arrived at the mouth of a deep cave. Inside the cave were large piles of leaves. John went in and kicked over the smallest pile nearly tripping when his foot hit something hard inside. He brushed away the leaves and revealed the half eaten carcass of a deer. I swept the leaves off a larger pile and quickly backed away bringing my rifle up to my shoulder. The face of an open mouthed black bear stared back at me. 

“It’s how big cats keep their kill fresh for longer.” Kanati spoke for the first time since he we left the station.

John swept away the last pile of leaves the feet of a human appearing from it. I helped him remove the leaves from the body. Neither of us recognized his bloated and bloodied face. I checked his pockets and pulled a wallet out. Flipping it open I read out loud “Christopher James Murphy”.

“Guess we gotta tow that car after all” John said making a morbid joke that I was still happy to hear.

We continued on our path into the den of the Panther.

Chapter Five 

Bones littered the floor as we walked deeper into the darkness. Some animal but some human. Some of the skulls looked ancient, yellowed from the pass of time. Others looked fresher still having hair and bits of dried skin left on them.
Had any of these people died doing what we were doing right now? Is there any hope for us? I thought to myself as I stared into the empty sockets of a skull in front of me.

The cave wasnt a smooth walled cavern you see in movies. The walls were jagged where the the mountains had collided into each other millions of years ago. Lots of corners where the beast could be laying in wait for us. 

As hard as we tried to be quiet the crunch of bones breaking beneath our feet echoed through the cave.

As the cave narrowed into a small arch John stopped and pulled his bag from his shoulder. Retrieving a package from inside. Opening the package he pulled out a stick. A road flare? No. Dynamite.

“This is our last resort and our fallback position” he said placing a stick at the base of arch. He carefully placed a few sticks around the area. 
“Gawonii if we fail to kill the Panther I want you to light this and run.” He whispered handing the old man a lighter and putting a fuse inside the last stick and placing it on a rock near Gawonii.

“I hope it doesn’t come to that. But good luck” Gawonii said. As we started through the arch Kanati began muttering something that sounded like it should’ve been a chant. 

The three of us continued on. The air was stale and moist and the stench of death was all around. We were here.

The beams from our flashlight moved around rapidly hoping to get a glimpse of the cat. It wasn’t here. I finally breathed for what felt like the first time since we entered the cave. I could feel my heartbeat in my fingertips as I slowly lowered my rifle.

“What do we-“ 

The blood curdling screech echoed through the cave loud enough to deafen us. Kanati began sprinting back the way we came. I could faintly hear the sounds of a man screaming through the ringing in my ears. John and I followed after Kanati.
Before we had made it back to the archway Kanati was thrown into the roof of the cave somewhere behind us in a quick blur of the panthers paw. 

My flashlight went to the beast. Its black fur seemed to dissolve the light. Its head was bigger than my chest. Ruby red eyes stares through my soul. Most shocking was its face. What little flesh it still had was rotten and barely clinging to its yellowed skull. Just behind the beasts right ear was a K-bar plunged handle deep into its neck. Jessica’s knife.

John had already begun shooting when I came out of my awestruck daze. I began to empty my clip into the black blur that now lunged  at me. I don’t know how many of my rounds hit it before I was thrown towards the wall. As I flew through the air I heard the distinct *ping of an empty M1 Garand. I hit the wall and lost consciousness.

I don’t know how long it had been when I woke up but I could hear a struggle still going on. I crawled to my flashlight that was laying 10 feet in front of me. Picking it up I found my now broken rifle. I turned too quickly, nearly passing out again from the blood rush. As I regained my senses I ran towards the back of the cave passing Kanati whose head had been caved in. 

When my light found them John was on the back of the Panther one arm wrapped around its neck the other K-bar in hand plunging it repeatedly into the Panthers chest. The Panther ran into the walls trying to get the Sheriff off his back.

“Blow the cave! I’ll be right behind you !” John shouted.

I turned and ran back to the arch. The dynamite sat on the rock where John had left it but where was the lighter? I flashed my light around the room trying to find Gawonii. I could still hear John cursing the Panther as I found Gawonii’s body faced down on the floor. I rolled him over and opened his clenched fist pulling the lighter from his grasp. 
“Come on John!” I called as I ran back to the archway. The panthers scream once again echoed through the cave disorienting me. I picked up the dynamite put my light towards the back of the cave and wait a second. 
“Do it!” I heard the Sheriff call out as he came into view in a full sprint. 
I lit the fuse gently placed it on the rock and began running back towards the mouth of the cave tripping after a few feet. My flashlight dropped and lit up behind me. I turned my head to see John making it through the arch. A flash of black consumed him. 

I picked myself back up and ran through the darkness until I could see the light coming through from the rising sun. I felt the quake from the explosion under my feet before the shockwave picked me up and threw me into the woods.

Epilogue

I don’t know whether or not we finally killed the Panther once and for all. My aunt celebrated her 80th birthday last month and we haven’t had any more gruesome deaths in 10 years so I’m hopeful.

When I woke up in the woods that morning the air was filled with the smell of sulfur and burnt flesh. My adrenaline had worn off and I finally felt the holes in my side where the Panther had slapped me into the wall. I hobbled my way back down the mountain to the jeep and drove back to the station catching the Henderson county Deputies before they began evacuating everyone. As we waited for the ambulance they informed me that Don King and Roger Williams and his family were all found deceased the night before. They would go check the cave to see if they could collect the bodies of my team. I  had passed out from blood loss before the ambulance arrived. 

I woke up in the hospital and the doctor told me I had a bad concussion along with a ruptured eardrum, 5 broken ribs along with 5 deep punture wounds on the right side of my chest. 


The day I was released from the hospital was the day of John’s funeral. It was an empty casket funeral as his body was still buried in the mountain. The whole town was packed into our little Baptist church. John’s parents were inconsolable as they watched their second child get buried in a week. I told them their children had saved the lives of everyone in this room. I had hope that it was true and the Panther was truly gone for good. I watched as my friend’s casket was lowered into the ground. I threw the first shovelful of dirt onto the casket before leaving. 


I’m writing this now because I’ve been told it would help deal with the trauma I’ve lived with for all these years. I don’t know if anyone will read it but it has been therapeutic for me. You can believe my story or not I don’t care. If you need to believe or not believe this story isn’t for you anyways. It’s for me and maybe it’s for others who have lived or are living through similar things. Appalachia is an old place and I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s more monsters out there. After all there’s lots of places that have had reported Black Panther sightings. I wouldn’t be surprised if mine isn’t the only one that’s true.
