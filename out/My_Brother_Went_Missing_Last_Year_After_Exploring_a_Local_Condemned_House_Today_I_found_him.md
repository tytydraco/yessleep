My brother went missing last year after going to the condemned house at the edge of our hometown. Today, I’m going to find him.

 

This letter is the last remaining thing I have of William, and as much as I don’t want to go against his final wishes, I *need* answers.

I *need* to find my brother.

 

“You read the letter, man. He told you himself not to come after him. I’m sorry, Rich, but I think he’s gone.” Maybe he was right, but on the off chance that he wasn’t, I needed answers.

“But look at what he wrote. He could still be alive.”

“God-DAMN IT, Rich! He told you that he was losing control of his body, he’s gone man. I’m sorry, but he’s *gone*.”

I wanted to tell him to get the hell out of my car, but a small part of me knew he was right.

“Sorry man, I just miss him.”

“Don’t sweat it dude, you’ve got that letter, and I think that’s good enough.”

“You know? I think it is.” It wasn’t.

And it was never going to be.

10 PM. Gives me more darkness and I can get home before I have to go to school. My only problem is that mom and dad have been on high alert since William went “missing”. So, I planned to do it on a weekend day. Saturday, specifically.

I had told them I was going to Dylan’s house, and that was my cover to leave and drive to the house on 22 XXXXX Drive. I had brought a flashlight, my phone camera, and my phone itself.

Leaving my car, I walked up to the house. It was just as frightening as William had said it was. One thing scared me more than the house, though. William’s car was parked haphazardly between the lawn and the driveway.

The keys weren’t in the ignition. I didn’t fret, though. He was still here; he had to be. Why would his car still be here otherwise? Looking around, I saw that I wouldn’t be able to get in very easily, as a wardrobe stood in the doorway.

 Luckily, I’m smaller than Will, and the wardrobe was shifted at an angle that would let me squeeze through. Looking through the first floor of the house, I decided to take the same route William did.

 I went into the kitchen first. The refrigerator was gone this time. I was a little unnerved by this, because it was very clearly there when William went last year. I checked the cabinets. Snack wrappers and some used mouse trap.

I chuckled a little bit at this. Yeah, mice couldn’t possibly be the worst thing in this house. Finishing up with the cabinet, I turned to the dining table. It was… *empty*? Looking to the floor, the cause became apparent. The dishes were thrown to the floor, their shattered pieces littering the hardwood. Only one fork remained on the table; the fork without a finger attached.

Determining that there was nothing of importance in the kitchen, I left and went into the living room.

The couch was missing all but one of the cushions, and that cushion was rotting. Springs and metal pierced through the fabric of the seat and jutted up in a dangerous manner. Not wanting to imagine what it was like to sit on that, I moved forward.

I wasn’t paying attention, so I nearly jumped out of my skin when my face brushed up against something fuzzy in the air. I flailed my arms and smacked whatever I ran into down. Instead of falling, it returned and hit me again. I backed up and shined my light on it. It was a fuzzy fabric keychain.

“You moron.” I whispered to myself, ashamed that a simple key accessory would scare me. It was hanging from the ceiling by a piece of twine, and I grabbed it. Something felt off about this. I looked a little closer and saw something that made my heart drop.

They were *William’s* car keys.

Who the hell could have done this? I began to panic. Whatever was in here had deliberately set this up, and they had done so for me.

The keys weren’t bait though, as nothing happened when I took them. They were placed here merely to scare me. I stuffed them in my pocket and continued exploring.

Leaving the living room, I decided I would look at the bathroom later. I headed upstairs. The steps creaked as my weight was put on them, but I wasn’t worried about alerting anyone.

 Worst case scenario—I could likely find a place to hide. Knowing what was in the first and second bedroom, I decided to look in the upstairs bathroom.

I didn’t know what I was looking to find, but this kind of thing just doesn’t happen under normal circumstances. The shower curtain was drawn, hiding whatever may have been lurking in the tub. Hesitantly, I took the left end of the curtain in my hand and yanked it to the right.

Before I could react, a blinding flash overtook me, and I stumbled back. After the spots in my vision disappeared, I looked back into the tub. A camera lay in the middle of it, a string tied to the photo-taking mechanism of the camera. Another scare tactic, I thought. I freed the camera from the string and examined it.

It felt… familiar. Flipping it around and looking through it, I was impressed; this was a good quality camera. What changed my view were the initials written on the bottom of the camera in reflective chrome marker.

‘W.P.’

William's initials. This was my brother’s camera. I looked at it and the camera began to shake. No—my hands were shaking while I was holding it. This—this had to be another scare tactic, right? I rushed out of the bathroom, panicking now.

 I suppose I wasn’t paying attention, because I ran headfirst into something and fell down. Rubbing my sore forehead and looking up, I saw the steps of a ladder. A ladder leading into the attic.

I decided to go up. I didn’t want to stay on the second floor for much longer. Climbing the stairs to the attic, I could feel a change in the air. It felt heavier. The attic was pitch black, and it smelled like a multitude of things.

 It smelled old, it smelled like chemicals, and it smelled like *rot*. Looking around, I soon found the reason for the rotten scent. Laying on the floor, was a skin suit. As I examined it closer, I was blown away by how intricate and detailed it was. The suit was a bit rough, but still soft. It was a bit wrinkly and bumpy.

 I breathed again through my nose and nearly threw up. This was the source of the rot. I peeled the suit off the ground and a sticky, brown liquid stretched from it and the floor, like glue.

Standing there, holding that pile of skin, it finally hit me: it was *real*. What scared me was not the fact that this was real, it was the physical structure of the skin. If I were to describe it on an actual frame, the person would look malnourished and sickly.

 They would look tall and gangly, arms too long for their body, and their feet bare. The head would have been bald. There was no mouth. Instead, it looked like there was a tube of skin with a hole in it coming out of where the mouth should have been. It was similar to the trunk of an elephant.

This couldn’t have been a normal person, but then, who would have done this? I put the pile of skin down and turned around. Leaving the attic seemed like the only good idea at this point.

Climbing down the ladder, I breathed a sigh of relief. The air felt heavy, so heavy I could almost *taste it*. Heading downstairs, I didn’t care anymore, I needed to get out of this house. I needed fresh air.

As I neared the entrance of the house, I was horrified to find the wardrobe stuck in the doorway. I *couldn’t* leave. I nearly screamed; I had to find another way out. I looked behind me and saw the bathroom at the end of the hallway.

 The room was illuminated by the moon outside. I sprinted to the bathroom and slammed the door, locking it as I did so. Looking to the right, I saw it, my way out. Grasping the bottom part of the window, I went to open it.

*Nothing*.

What the hell? I began to panic once more and looked down. The window was nailed shut. As I was attempting to formulate another way out, I heard something; *quick footsteps coming up the basement stairs*. As quicky as I heard the footsteps, I heard what I assumed was the basement door open.

I went back to the bathroom door and double checked that it was locked. After confirming that it was, I backed up to the cabinet. 

As soon as my back hit it, the thing from the basement was at the bathroom door. I heard whatever it was breathing. I didn’t know if it was my fear riddled brain, or if what I was hearing was actually real, but I could have almost sworn that it was *William* breathing.

“Will—is—is that you?”

“……”

“Come on man. Talk to me.”

“……”

“Will, it’s me, your brother. C—come on man.”

“…brother.” Something was wrong. He wouldn’t have been that formal. I suppose I should have come to this conclusion a long time ago, but I was now beginning to doubt that the individual in the other side of the bathroom door was my brother. My mind was divided further when it slid something under the door.

It was William’s *phone*.

The patterns were repeating themselves. William experienced this too, albeit in a different way. There was no way out now. If I opened the door, it would get me. If I smashed the window, it could find me. This thing likely did know the house better than I did, after all.

I had deluded myself so far to the point where I thought William was still alive. I knew the whole time that he was dead, I just didn’t want to accept it. I quickly formulated what could be called a plan.

I was going to unlock the door, bust through it, and hit whoever was on the opposite side of it. What I was going to do after that; I still had to figure out.

I psyched myself up and began to do it. I unlocked the door and took a few steps back.

*And then I began to run*.

When I burst through the door, there was resistance, which wasn’t surprising. My momentum brought me all the way to the side of the basement door, which was closed.

II turned around, seeing that what I knocked over was…… another old chair? Before I could put the pieces together, I felt a force slam into me from my right side. It sent me crashing through the basement door and I tumbled down the stairs.

 By the time I landed at the base of the stairs, I knew something was wrong. The pain in my ankle told me I had broken it during my fall. Grabbing my phone from my pocket, I turned the flashlight on and got up. 

Limping to the end of the basement, I could hear it coming down the stairs. It walked *agonizingly* slow. By the time it reached halfway, I was already to the end of the basement.

I looked around. Dozens of corpses littered the basement, although they were a little more decrepit now. They must have gone through the same fate William and Landon did. I imagined an apology for them and continued on.

 I was here for one person. I had nearly lost the strength to keep walking at the point I found him, but I didn’t need to worry about getting out now.

*I was going to die here*.

Withered, decaying, whatever words can be used to describe the condition he was in. it was William’s corpse. I had found him. I slumped down next to him and began to cry. Through all of our pain and misery, I had finally found him.

It was a pretty shitty family reunion if you ask me, but sometimes you need to take what you can get. I went onto the note app for my phone and began typing.

 If something was to happen, I would want somebody to know what happened to us. As I finish typing and remove the password from my phone, I can only think of one thing.

*Way to disappoint your brother, Rich*.

As I look at the thing wearing William’s skin, I put the last of my thoughts together and prepare myself for whatever is about to happen.

The edge of my hometown. There, a house lies, but you shouldn’t go. It’s a bad place. Something hungry lies dormant within, waiting to latch onto everything it possibly can.

I don’t know what this thing is, and I don’t think I ever will. It took my brother’s friend. It took my brother.

And it’s going to take *me* next.
