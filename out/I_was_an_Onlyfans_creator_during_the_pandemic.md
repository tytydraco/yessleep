My name is Nate.  
I used to do Onlyfans during the pandemic.

I was one of those thousands of desperate twenty-somethings who lost their jobs, ran out of savings, swallowed their pride, and decided: if men are already creeping in my dms, they might as well pay for it.

I’m not proud of it, but I’m not ashamed either. It was survival. Rent doesn’t care about your dignity.

Before covid, I was a barista and part-time bartender at a busy restaurant downtown. It was fine. Not glamorous, but I liked the noise, the flirting, the dumb drama. I had my gym routine, my little circle of friends, crushes and dates that went nowhere. I posted the standard gay boy content on instagram—locker room selfies, kitchen dancing, “accidental” underwear photos. Just one more thirsty gay among thousands.

Then the pandemic hit. The restaurant shut "temporarily". That turned into no shifts, no tips, no job. My roommate went back to her parents’. I didn’t have that privilege. I sat in an empty apartment and watched my savings dwindle to almost nothing.

With nowhere to go, I started living on my phone. Everyone else did too. People were more present online, more bored, more willing to talk. My DMs filled with the usual: flame emojis, "hey handsome", "you’re cute", "what gym do you go to?" and, more and more often, “do you have onlyfans?"

I’d always laughed it off. Sent a dumb emoji, said no. Then one day I opened my banking app and saw I had thirty-two dollars left. Suddenly, the question felt different.

If they already wanted to look, why not charge?

So I did it. I set up an account, picked a username that sounded hot but not too distinctive, posted a few teasers on Twitter and my IG story and pretended I wasn’t shaking while I did it. I told myself it was a temporary "pandemic side hustle".

The learning curve was steep and embarrassing. The first month, my content was awful—bad lighting, stiff posing, obvious nerves. People subscribed anyway. First eight. Then twenty. Then fifty. My first payout was more than I’d ever made in a week at the café. That hit me harder than any compliment.

After that, the months blurred. I figured out angles, bought a ring light, upgraded my phone and called it "an investment", Income climbed: one grand, then two, then three. My world shrank to my apartment, my phone, and the invisible crowd on the other side of the screen. I started doing small collabs with other guys in the same lane, but nothing huge. Just enough to feel like I was slowly climbing.

If you’ve never done that kind of work, there’s one thing you need to understand: when your income depends on strangers wanting to look at you, your whole life rearranges itself around the idea of being seen. What you eat, when you sleep, how often you exercise—everything filters through, "will this make me look better or worse on camera?W You’re never alone, even when you’re physically alone, because you’re always aware of a phantom audience.

I was deep in that mindset when he noticed me.

It happened on a Tuesday night. I remember because the taco place across the street had a special and I’d decided I couldn’t even afford discount tacos. I was lying in bed in old gym shorts, scrolling, trying to figure out what to film next.

A notification slid down: **Leandro Lux has replied to your story.**

At first I was sure it had to be a fake account.

Even if you’re not gay, you’ve probably seen his face. He was everywhere: “hottest men” pages, fitness accounts, travel content, brand campaigns. That perfectly calibrated kind of male beauty that looks good in every city, every outfit, every filter. He wasn’t "just" an onlyfans guy or "just" an influencer. He did modeling, sponsored trips, guest appearances, little background cameos in movies and music videos. Celebrities followed him. Designers dressed him. He’d even shown up at the Met Gala once.

And there he was in my notifications.

His message was simple: he told me I was "really bright".

That was it. But it hit like a truck. I checked his profile three times to make sure it was real: checkmark, millions of followers, perfect grid. He'd seen a story of mine—some dumb thirst trap in my kitchen—and responded like I’d stood out from a crowd.

You have to understand the headspace I was in. I hadn’t been touched in months except by myself. I hadn’t been out on a real date in even longer. My sense of self-worth was tangled up in subscriber counts and tips. Having him say I stood out didn’t just flatter my looks; it made me feel like the universe had briefly turned a spotlight toward me and said, this one.

I replied something awkward, the way people do when they’re trying not to sound overeager. He told me he watched more than I thought, that I had a warmth he liked, and casually asked if I’d ever thought about collaborating.

After that, things changed very fast.

Within a week, my socials exploded. Followers, tips, subs—everything spiked. I started getting messages from people saying they’d found me through his story; turns out he’d reposted one of my videos with a caption calling me "obsessed" and tagged my handle. One word from him and my life jumped to a new tier.

Brands were suddenly in my dms. Bigger creators followed me back. I was added to a group chat full of men I’d silently stalked and thirsted over for years. It felt like a door had opened and I’d finally been admitted to whatever was on the other side.

Then he called.

He used my full name like he’d always known it. His voice was lower than I expected—calm, smooth, practiced. He said he was putting together a tiny, exclusive retreat at a luxury rental: content, networking, relaxation. Everything taken care of, transportation covered, just a handful of male creators he'd personally handpicked. He said I had a glow he wanted to "nurture" and “work more closely with.”

Lockdown was still technically a thing, but people with money were already traveling, partying, pretending it was over. I hadn’t left the city in over a year. The idea of a house, a pool, meeting hot guys, being chosen by him—it was intoxicating. I said yes so fast I’m still embarrassed thinking about it.

I got the confirmation email ten minutes later. NDA attached. A glossy PDF explaining "house rules": privacy, no posting the location, no filming staff, no leaving the grounds without permission. It read like an official brand influencer trip, the kind agencies organize for big campaigns. My friends freaked out when I told them. Someone joked I’d be sacrificed. I joked back that if he was a vampire, he’d at least keep me hot forever.

I wish I could go back and slap the phone out of my own hand.

From the outside, the place looked like every luxury Airbnb you’ve ever seen on instagram: white walls, big windows,a mirror-like pool and plenty of spaces designed to photograph well. Beautiful in that sterile, expensive way that feels like no one actually lives there.

The driver didn’t talk much. My signal cut out long before we pulled into the driveway.

Inside, something felt off almost immediately, and I couldn’t articulate why.

The lack of mirrors was the first thing that stood out. Anywhere you’d normally expect one—entryway, above the fireplace, bathroom sinks—there was either bare wall or abstract art. When I asked about it, one of the staff told me they preferred "less distraction, more presence" with a tight smile that didn’t match their eyes.

The guest room assigned to me was gorgeous. Huge bed, high ceilings, a wall of blackout curtains, a bathroom bigger than my entire apartment. There was a little card on the nightstand with my name on it and a quote in looping script: "YOU ARE HERE TO SHINE". Underneath, in smaller letters: "Curated by Lux".

The other guys trickled in. I recognized a couple of them immediately in that embarrassing, heart-thumping way you do when you’ve seen someone in… well, *action* before.

Tyler, the all-American golden boy with the kind of body sports brands love, and Diego, a Mexican swimmer type who did bilingual thirst content and sent money home to his family. There were others—Carter, Ray—each with their own carefully curated appeal. All of them gorgeous. All of them a little more subdued in person than they were online. Some of that was probably nerves. Some of it wasn’t.

Leandro arrived last.

He looked *exactly* like he does on screen.

It’s hard to explain how unsettling that is. Most people look different off camera: softer, more textured, less precise. He didn’t. In person, he had the same flawless, seemingly poreless skin, the same carved jawline, the same almost-too-bright eyes. He moved like he was being filmed even when he wasn’t—always catching the light at the right angle without seeming to try.

He greeted all of us, said the expected things about connection and vulnerability and "letting our inner light come out". He called me "bright" again, told me he’d been excited to meet me in person, and when his attention was on me, the room felt like it was narrowing to just the two of us.

That first day was carefully structured to feel casual and organic. Smoothies in the morning, a "breathwork and yoga session" by the pool, light filming that looked candid but was clearly choreographed, group meals that were supposedly relaxed but always staged around long tables and good lighting. He floated through it all like a host and a brand merged into one person.

He was nice. I could see why people followed him. But there was something… off. Something I told myself was just nerves, or starstruck awe.

At some point after lunch, he pulled me aside.

He said he wanted to "test our chemistry" before doing anything big. No cameras, just the two of us, to see how we were together off-screen. He framed it as something professional, almost ethical, like he didn’t want to sell a fantasy that didn’t feel "authentic".

I went to his room before dinner.

You don't need me to tell you what happened in detail. It happened. It was intense and strangely quiet. What matters is how my body reacted.

Time didn’t feel right in there. Things flickered. I’d close my eyes and open them what felt like a second later, only to realize my muscles burned like I’d been moving for ages. My fingers and toes went numb and never fully warmed up again. The room felt cold from the inside out, like someone was slowly pouring ice through my veins.

He controlled my breathing the way a trainer does—told me to inhale and exhale with him. The more I exhaled, the weaker I felt. There were brief flashes where the air seemed to brighten unnaturally, like getting hit with a ring light to the face, his expression sharp and perfectly clear while everything else washed out.

He barely looked winded afterward. I felt like I’d run a marathon in the wrong body.

I remember lying there, trying to catch my breath, and feeling this strange sensation—like something had been siphoned out of me that wasn’t sweat or effort. He on the other hand, was… sharper. Brighter.

The next thing I knew, I was in my own room.

There was no memory of walking down the hall, no goodbye, no door closing behind me. Just his room, and then my ceiling. The clock said it was almost nine. I still don’t know how long I was actually in there.

The physical changes started small. Heaviness in my limbs. A dull ache in my joints. A kind of fatigue that didn’t match what we’d actually done.

At dinner, everyone looked rough. Tyler’s hands shook. Carter kept rubbing at the base of his skull. Diego moved like his arms and legs weighed extra. Ray looked half-dead: washed out, eyes sunk deep, lips colorless. We all kind of joked about being tired, about "long shooting days" and "getting old", but there was an edge to it.

Leandro looked fine. Better than fine, actually. He was bright, animated, almost glowing in the candlelight. He ate well, laughed easily, made soft, reassuring comments about how the first day of "deep work" always felt like that.

He ran group "sharing" sessions at night that felt like a mix of group therapy, confession, and content planning. We talked about trauma, money problems, family, shame. He listened with this hyper-focused attention that felt flattering and invasive at the same time. The more we opened up, the more energized he seemed.

By the third day, I didn’t feel like myself anymore.

I woke up one morning, turned on my front-facing camera because there were no mirrors, and the face looking back didn’t match what I remembered. Subtle things, but real: deeper shadows under my eyes, a slightly sharper jaw, a tiredness around the mouth that doesn’t belong on a mid-twenties face. When I turned my head, the image lagged for a second. My real head moved; the version in the screen stayed facing forward for a beat, eyes still locked on mine, and then snapped to catch up.

I dropped the phone.

Everyone else seemed to be deteriorating too. Complaints about weird sleep, time gaps, waking up in places they hadn’t meant to fall asleep. Diego mentioned that his tattoos looked "faded" and kept touching his chest like he’d been hit. Tyler said he felt like he’d aged ten years in three days. Nobody said it outright, but we were all circling the same fear.

Ray didn’t show up to breakfast on the fourth morning.

A staff member casually mentioned he’d "left early, overwhelmed by the intensity", like that was a totally normal thing to happen between midnight and dawn in a remote house in the woods. When I checked his accounts during our limited phone time, they were gone. Not in the usual way—no "user not found", no deactivated profile. It was like his handles had never existed. Cached links 404’d. Mentions redirected to nothing. Our DMs labeled him as "unknown user".

He disappeared from the internet in less than twelve hours.

Looking back, that should’ve been the moment I ran. Instead, I did what traumatized people do: I rationalized. Told myself it was a glitch, or a dramatic rebrand, or something he’d planned.

The storm that saved me hit on the fourth night.

It rolled in hard—black sky, sideways rain, wind that made the glass shudder. Sometime after midnight, the power flickered and the house dropped into emergency lighting. Red glows in the hallways. Alarm beeps. Staff moving fast.

That was the first time since arriving that it felt like the house itself wasn’t in control.

I got up, threw on clothes, and—without fully deciding to—headed for the back corridors. There was a service hallway behind the kitchen that ended in a metal door I’d noticed once and then promptly forgotten. In the red emergency light, it looked like the only real exit.

It was locked.

Of course it was.

I was still standing there, fingers slipping on the handle, when I heard him say my name.

He didn’t shout; he just spoke it like he was mildly disappointed to find me messing with something I shouldn’t. When I turned, he was standing at the far end of the corridor, barefoot, in casual clothes that somehow made him more unnerving. The red light flattened his features, made his eyes look too dark.

He told me I didn’t need to run. That I was "already half-gone". That if I left, I’d just fade: my body failing faster than it should, my online presence crumbling, my life getting harder in ways I wouldn’t be able to understand. He said if I stayed, at least the ending would be "beautiful".

When I demanded to know what he was and what he’d done to Ray, he sounded bored. He said he’d been doing "this"  for centuries. That people always asked that question. That the only thing I needed to know was that he was always hungry.

Lightning exploded outside, bright enough to turn the red emergency light white for a heartbeat. It flashed through the narrow window over the door and hit him full-on.

I will never forget what I saw for that one second.

His skin wasn’t that smooth, tan perfection I’d seen on my phone. It was a dead, bluish-gray, stretched too tight over sharp bones, mottled in places like old stone left in water too long. His cheekbones jutted out at an almost impossible angle, carving deep hollows into his face. His mouth was slightly open, and it was wrong—too wide, the lips thinned back just enough to show teeth that weren’t fangs but still looked predatory, uneven lengths and shapes like they’d grown wherever they wanted.

His eyes weren’t eyes at all in that light. They were pits. Two deep, black sockets sunk so far back they looked empty, like something had scooped out the living part long ago and left only hunger staring out.

His whole head seemed a little too long, a little too narrow, like the idea of a face stretched over something that hadn’t been designed for one.

Then the lightning faded, and the red came back, and he was just Leandro again—beautiful, human, perfect.

It was enough.

I hit the door with my shoulder. Pain shot down my arm. It didn’t budge. He told me, very calmly, that I was making things harder than they needed to be.

I hit it again. Something in the frame cracked. The latch snapped. The door flew open and real night air hit me—wet, cold, full of trees and mud and everything that wasn’t curated.

I ran.

I don’t remember much of that sprint except mud, falling, getting back up, the sense of something watching but not quite touching. I was sure, the whole time, that if I looked back I’d see that gray face right behind me, those empty sockets closing in. I didn’t look. Eventually I stumbled out onto the main road, half expecting to be yanked backward by invisible hands. Instead, a truck stopped. The driver didn’t ask too many questions.

At the first gas station, I saw myself in the bathroom mirror and finally understood just how much he’d taken.

I’d left home looking barely legal—round-faced, baby-soft, the kind of guy who still got carded for energy drinks. The man who came back could’ve passed as early forties on a good day. Jaw sharper. Lines between the brows. Skin duller. Eyes heavier, like I’d spent a decade learning how to be tired.

I didn’t go back to onlyfans. I tried to warn people.

At first it was vague, aimed at other creators: "Be careful who you work with", "Don’t let anyone make you feel special just to use you", that kind of thing. It didn’t help. The heaviness in my chest didn’t lift. So I got more specific. I wrote a whole thread about the retreat, about Leandro, about waking up feeling older, about Ray vanishing.

It ended as expected: I got dms calling me jealous, an attention whore, a hater, a bitter ex-collab. Someone told me to "go touch grass". Someone else said, "If he drained you, he did a bad job, you still look old af, bitch". Classy.

I deleted the posts.

My follower and subscriber count didn’t drop—it crashed. Overnight.

I woke up and half my subscribers were gone. By that afternoon, almost all of them were. Collabs I’d done vanished from other creators’ profiles. Men I’d become friends with, whom I’d talked to for months, blocked me out of nowhere. Videos I was featured in were deleted or re-edited like I’d never been in them. My digital footprint shrink until I was conveniently forgotten. And for the first time since the pandemic, I didn’t care in the slightest.

But the others were still missing. Tyler, Carter, Diego, Ray.

Tyler’s onlyfans? Gone. His twitter, instagram and tiktok? Nothing. No "user not found", just like his handles had never existed. When I searched his name, I got a football coach in Ohio and a realtor in Florida. None of the old reposts of his gym selfies came up. Thirst gay accounts that used to spam him now had other guys in his place.

Carter was the same. I tried every platform I knew he’d been on, plus Google, plus cached searches. Nothing.

Diego had told me at the retreat he'd shot a pair of scenes for a big-name studio—videos that should’ve lived online forever. Gone. I even contacted the studio, but they replied that they had “no record” of any performer by his name.

And Ray… God. No socials. No posts. No missing-person report.

No worried families. Just absence.

It felt like reality had deleted them and left him.

It’s been almost six years. I’ve built something resembling a normal life. I’ve learned to joke about my age, to frame the changes in ways people can accept—too much stress, rough pandemic, bad genetics. I tell people I’m older than I am so they’ll compliment me for "looking good for my age" instead of asking why my knees hurt and my face doesn’t match the year on my ID.

I have a steady job in customer support. A patient boyfriend who knows of my social media past but doesn’t care or asks questions. Most days, the horror of that week feels far away, like a story I’m telling myself about someone else.

Then, two weeks ago, I broke my own rule and looked him up.

He hasn’t aged a day.

Still flawless. Still gorgeous. Still everywhere. Still surrounded by new faces.

In his most recent post he was smiling on a beach somewhere in the south of France, the sunset framing him in gold. The caption was something bland and corny about being “grateful for this life.”

That phrasing—*this* life—made something tighten in my chest.

I scrolled.

A few posts down, there was a video.

“New collab soon,” the caption said. “He's so bright.”

In the clip, Leandro sat on a couch in a different mansion, laughing with someone just out of frame. A hand came into the shot—a young hand, tan, veined, a thin bracelet at the wrist. The camera tilted; there was a glimpse of a face, half-turned.

A boy in his mid-twenties. Soft around the cheeks, shy smile, eyes shining.

The kind of boy who would get a DM from a legend and feel like the universe had finally noticed him.

I watched Leandro look at him.

Just that. A glance. A turn of the head.

Even through the compressed little square of video, the air in my bedroom seemed to pull tight. For a second, it felt like all the oxygen was being drawn toward the phone screen.

I slammed the app closed.

My reflection in the black glass stared back at me. Older. Tired. Alive.

Beside me, my boyfriend stirred, half-asleep, and reached for me. I set the phone face-down on the nightstand and moved closer to him, grounding myself in the warmth of someone real.

That’s why I’m writing this here.

Because out in the normal world—in comment sections, fan pages, dms—nobody wants to hear that their favorite pretty face might be something terrible. People would rather call me a hater or jealous than consider the possibility that this could be real.

Believe that if you want.  
I’ve already lost enough.

All I want is for someone, somewhere, to remember this:

If you’re a content creator and you ever get a dm from Leandro Lux telling you he loves your glow, your warmth, your brightness…

If he offers to collab,  
if he invites you to some private getaway,  
if he tells you you’re special, chosen, different—

Ignore him. Block him. Run from him.

He will make you feel seen in a way you’ve been starving for, especially if you’re young and broke and lonely and living through a moment where the whole world feels unreal.

Then he’ll drink years out of you and walk away shining, while you’re left wondering why your body suddenly feels too old for your age—and why no one remembers the people who were standing next to him in last year’s pictures.

He almost took everything from me.

Leandro, whatever he is, is still out there.  
Still beautiful.  
Still hungry.

And I know, sooner or later, some poor guy out there will get a dm from him.
