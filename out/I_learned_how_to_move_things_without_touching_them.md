Okay, I’ve marked this spot for my hands on the floor, so you should be able to read this now. I need help, and I think this is my last chance to reach out before something truly unspeakable happens to me. I’ve tried everything else. So, if anyone who sees this has a way to break down a wall, I need you to find this house. Bring a gun, the police, or anything to demolish the building. If possible, bring fire. If you are unable to help me, it is then important that you avoid me at all costs.

My name is Jackie. I’m in a small mountain-side cottage that my friend rents out for ski-bums on weekends and things like that. I would give you the address if I had it, but considering we’re close and the place is hard to find, I got here via some backroad direction he scribbled down for me last time we hung out. I’d grab it and upload a picture, however the paper is out in the kitchen and… that’s just not an option for me anymore.

I’m getting mixed up, sorry. I’ve been stuck in this same room for a couple days now and I’m getting beyond desperate because it's starting to snow. I’ll start over and explain it better, I promise. Just bear with me, writing like this is extremely difficult.

I was wrapping up my final lectures at my school with my aforementioned friend, plus a few additional buddies that I see almost daily. His name is Sean, and he’s been one of my closer friends throughout college. 

We were all tuning out our professor’s wrap-up ramblings and spitballing what we’d be doing over winter-break after finals. Most of my friends included skiing or snowboarding in their list, and they all talked about it like heroin addicts between hits.

“Oh, I’ve got to go skiing at some point.”

“I heard lift-tickets went up but I’ll sell a kidney to make up for it.”

“I got new bindings and I’m thinking of getting my brother into it.”

That kind of stuff… I didn’t think it would be a big deal when I weighed in, saying, “I’ve actually never skied before.”

“Wait, actually?” Sean gasped, widening his eyes more than needed to get the point across. He was sitting next to his girlfriend, Charlotte, who I was also friendly with since we dormed together as sophomores. 

“You should try it!” she chirped with her cheerleader smile. 

She was always the perky enthusiastic type, which I guess meshed well with Sean’s steezy park-rat calm. Come to think of it, I was pretty laxed when I was a sophomore too, so maybe that’s also why she and I got along well. Or maybe they both just had rich enough families. Either way, I had never been good in the cold. I also didn’t like the idea of breaking a leg during my time off from school.

“I don’t really think I’m cut out for that. I’ll break something, plus renting equipment and everything is too expensive right now.” I responded, though it didn’t matter. Charlotte squealed quietly and excitedly as she flipped her hands onto Sean’s shoulder.

“Why don’t we all go back to your cabin some weekend? That could be fun!” she said to Sean. He cocked his head and his eyes lit up a bit at the thought.

“I mean we could.” He put a hand over Charlotte's and looked at me. “We’ve got tons of ski gear year round for when we rent it out to families, but I can check if it's vacant for a weekend.”

I had never heard of this cabin before, but it wasn’t really a surprise since Sean seemed to fill up each season with as much snowboarding as he could. 

“I just don’t know if I’d be any good at it though.” I warned them. Sean grinned as he immediately took out his phone and began texting his family I presumed. 

“Don’t worry, none of us are good.” He lied. “I mainly snowboard but skiing is a bit easier to pick up, and I’m sure we’ve got stuff that’ll fit you. Charlotte can teach you too.” Charlotte also smiled and began nodding quickly, her red curls bouncing up and down like maple leaves. I didn’t mind the idea of trying it out. Especially if I wouldn’t have to spend a couple hundred dollars to see if I liked it.

I didn’t really have to think about it too long in the end.

“Sure. I guess I’ll need to buy a bigger coat then.”

“Eh, you’ll get used to the cold pretty quick.” He added as he pulled Charlotte in affectionately.

Sean filled me in on the details of the rental house over the first week of winter-break. 

Originally, it was some tucked-away deal he found while browsing early in the season. After booking it with his family and loving the location, he told me they bought it outright to give the spot the luster it needed and get a few more people to rent it out.

He told me that he and Charlotte would get there a night early and ‘break the place in.’ which promptly reminded me of my spot as the Third Wheel on this trip. I would come the following night, but at least I’d get my own room.

As mentioned earlier, I was only able to find the cabin via some handwritten directions that veered me off the last named road on my GPS. I had already considered that road to be backwoods, but the twisting frozen mud trails that followed turned my van into a paddle boat in the middle of the ocean. My suspension groaned and creaked as the frosted bed of roots rocked me back and forth for what felt like an hour.

When I finally arrived, I was impressed by the sight of the cabin and actually began looking forward to my ski lessons.

Tucked away in a small pine tree outcove, the modest brick home sat quietly as a light flurry of snow drifted down in the moonlight. The ground was dusted, and I loved the ivy vines and earthy roots that caressed the cottage’s edges. The front windows were dimly lit with an orange glow, so I stuffed my clothing and water bottle into my bag and knocked on the door.

Nobody came, so I tried a few more times before the ripping cold began to sting. I scanned briefly for the hanging pot that Sean kept his spare key in. The harsh wind must have knocked it loose, and I found it had fallen into one of the pine shrubs beside the porch. I rumaged around in the roots and Ivy until my fingers gripped icy metal.

“Sean? Charlotte?” I asked into the cabin as I pushed the door open. I stepped out of the wind and slammed the door behind me. The draft dispersed, only the muffled sound of scattering snow howling outside remained.

One singular light was illuminated in the center of the room. It was one of those small bulbs that hung with a dangling chain to turn it on. It creaked side to side, all of the shadows it casted drifting as it swayed. 

“Guys?” I tried again. Still no answer. 

The place was small and quaint, with two bedrooms beside one another and a bathroom between. Potted plants lined every windowsill and table throughout the entire cabin, and it carried an earthy musk that reminded me of a greenhouse. Their roots were overgrown, spilling up over the edges of their containers as they searched for more unfrozen soil, bending and bulging at the knuckles to contort themselves until they looked like curled up spiders.

I was bewildered at how quickly they must have grown to not have been noticed. Why wouldn’t Sean’s family have thrown them out by now, or at least cut them?

It wasn’t modest either. A few of the larger pots had root extensions reaching up and inside of some of the tallest cabinets. Others reached off of the counter, and into a pantry beside it. 

Curious, I grabbed the door handle to the pantry, only to find the door hardly able to budge.

I pulled with all of my weight only to pry the door open a small crack and peek inside. My skin crawled as I saw an intertwining labyrinth of deep red roots latching onto the door from inside. They had anchored around themselves in some form of disgusting conglomerate, the sound of snapping twigs scrapping the floor as I tried to pull the door free.

With no luck, I let the door slam itself shut, and threw my stuff on the couch before looking around more.

My room was neatly made, lacking the cozy commodities of the rest of the cabin. The bed was nothing more than a plain mattress with a dense, scraggly blanket tightly pulled to the corners. Not even a pillow. The imposing brick walls were completely barren as well. No outlets, no paintings, and no windows.

I went into the other bedroom and found no sign of my friends other than their bags next to their bed with the sheets twisted in a frenzy, a stark contrast to my room. 

I sat on the foot of their bed, only for a cloud of dust to kick up beneath me as I did. I coughed, and took note of how dusty the whole place seemed. Looking back, I saw that I had actually been leaving a trail of footprints on the ground, and every movement I made left some form of impression in the dusty film.

I wiped my pants off and turned my attention to Sean and Charlotte’s belongings. They were also completely caked in dust. How long were they here for? Sean and Charlotte were only supposed to be here a day early but it looks like nothing had been moved in months.

My service was horrible, but I was surprisingly able to get a message out to Sean from this deep in the forest.



***Hey, I should be at the right place. I found the key where you said, but could you text me where you guys are? I’m alone at the cabin.***



I started unpacking my things while I waited for a response. I was glad to see the small TV on the mantle worked, though I could only get a few news channels and weather. I opted for the weather channel just before I heard my phone buzz.



***I’m with Charlotte. We went out for dinner but the snow’s starting to really come down and it’s gonna be slow driving.*** 

***Make yourself at home.***



I did. After an hour went by, I had successfully made myself some hot chocolate I found near the coffee machine and was watching some anime I downloaded on my laptop.

After another hour, my eyes started getting heavy and I decided to text Sean again before calling it a night.



***I’m getting pretty tired. Try and drive safe please.***



I slotted my laptop back into my bag and plugged my phone into a power strip near the TV to charge while I went into the bedroom, telling myself I’d deal with everything in the morning. Although the room was dark, save for the streak of light creeping in from the living room, I actually had a really easy time falling asleep. The sound of the snow, the stillness of the cabin… It only took a couple of hours for me to get woken up.

I heard a door slam loudly out in the living room and jolted upright, my heart already racing before my head could catch up. Feet slogged back and forth, the old wood creaking as a shadow moved past my cracked door. I listened to the careful shuffling in the room next door.

At first I just assumed Sean and Charlotte had hastily run inside to get out of the harsh weather, so I got out of bed to greet them. I started to open my door, but paused halfway through as I heard a rapid scurrying traverse across the house. With my hand on the doorframe, I felt it too. Fast, soft thuds reverberating through the wall before immediately pausing once out of sight.

My heart hammered against my ribs, and the sound of my blood pumping was comparable to a hurricane for how silent the room had become. I craned my neck, inching my forehead and eyes out from behind my door to look into the living room.

I saw the hanging lightbulb dancing around, whatever disturbed it no longer present. The once even coating of dust on the floor was now a mosaic tapestry of lines, imprints, and scrapes. As I examined it, I saw that the dust near the front door was notably less disturbed than any other door, and I realized that I was still somehow the only one who had opened it that day.

I continued to survey the room, but I wish I hadn’t. Now extending my head and shoulder out of my room, I could see that the pantry door was wide open.

The pantry was hollowed out. Thatchy vines and dead roots clung between the shelves like branches of wicker. Their fingerlike extremities had gripped all of the stored provisions, puncturing the containers and latching to their innards. The room smelled foul with a pungent odor like mold. My fingernails began to split from how hard they held onto the door, my whole body tensing up at the sight.

Despite how scared I was, I pulled my eyes away from the pantry and directed them towards the TV stand. I had my phone and keys right next to one another, no more than fifteen feet away from the front door. All I had to do was grab them and bolt. Even if I couldn’t do it quietly, I was sure I could be fast enough to get enough distance between me and whoever was here. At least enough to lock myself in my car. Then I could just start it up, it always performs fine in the cold, and drive away.

I swallowed. The plan was good, and I just needed to focus on running straight and not making any mistakes. I pivoted my legs, moving my hands to the edge of the doorframe to propel myself as I began running.

Then, just as I took a deep breath of the rank air before taking off, something pale and papery slipped through my field of vision. It brushed the space in front of my face and dropped to the floor with a soft, weightless rustle.

I snapped my head upward.

Something vast and tangled clung to the ceiling above me: a heaving lattice of blood-red vines, swollen and restless. As it shifted, dried husks sloughed free and fluttered down, shedding from it like dead skin.

It convulsed, and a wet, choking bellow tore out as a new length of root forced its way from the mass, splitting and unfurling into a crude suggestion of fingers.

I fell backward into my room and pulled the door back shut, encasing myself in darkness. I watched from the floor as the small sliver of light from under the door violently flickered as layers of thrashing vines reached down and felt about. A low, sickly moan vibrated against the wall while the wet roots caressed around and under it.

I saw the handle begin to twist, and I desperately crawled across the floor, throwing my body under my bed. I laid with my hands cupped over my face, dust stinging my eyes while the door slowly pushed open with a long squeal. I saw the silhouette of misshapen legs standing in the doorway and wormlike vines creeping across the ground.

I shut my eyes and waited.

I waited, then I waited even more. To my surprise… I just kept waiting, nothing ever happening past that. I eventually worked up the nerve to open my eyes, only to see the thing hadn’t moved an inch. I deadlocked my sight on it for minutes at a time, but it never moved. I waited more.

By the time I saw sunlight veering through the living room behind it, I found myself cautiously crawling out from under the bed. It stood in the door motionless besides the subtle swaying as it balanced on two thin stalks it used for legs. Like its legs, it had another entanglement of roots sticking out of its midsection in the rough shape of an arm, as well as a thin nub in place of a head. 

The whole thing was lopsided, its torso uneasily seated at a steep angle as its inner network of tendrils slithered with no real goal. The whole thing appeared… frail.

I heard my heart beating steady once again in my head, but I approached slowly. As I did, I noticed the distorted head lean slightly toward me as the thing shivered. I paused as it began to move for the first time in hours.

It shambled, using its web of vines tethering the doorframe to balance, and began adjusting its pose to place one leg forward and one backward. It shifted the crooked arm to the position of a walking gait, and I watched as more roots adjusted to define a pseudo-shoulder. It took on a new stance. My stance.

I took another step toward it and watched as it struggled to maneuver its legs in rhythm with mine. Seeing the pattern, I raised my right arm and watched it cheaply copy me. When I raised my left, a new tendril split free, forcing itself into bimanual symmetry. It stayed there for the rest of the day.

Unmoving, watching, improving.

I tried calling out for help, aiming my voice over its shoulder and around its newly proportioned head. I screamed and screamed until my voice turned to air, watching as the cluster of vines mocked me while I grabbed my throat in pain. Until that point, I didn’t dare touch it; but, with no voice left and craving water, I extended out my hand.

It had hands now too, and it mirrored my gesture confidently. I took two firm steps closer and exhaled steadily while I bridged the gap between us. It felt cold. The wet, fibrous makeup of its hand licked my palm and fingers as it pushed back against me. I pushed harder, and so did it. I raised my other hand, the thing doing the same to match my stance, and I began putting my weight into it. 

It was strong, but I heard the tension begin to tear away at the doorframe roots holding it in place. I pushed harder, then harder, and even harder until I felt my feet sliding behind me.

Our fingers interlocked, my nails digging into the back of its hands while it crudely attempted to do the same with its rough vines. I lowered my shoulders and shoved with everything I had. 

The roots snapped, and a bodily thud shook the ground as the thing settled its weight on its own two legs. Again, I stepped toward it and strained to twist myself through the doorway. Like trying to walk past your own reflection in a mirror, the thing was now matching me to the curl of my toes and blocking every attempt I made.

I stepped back while I panted in exasperation and glared at it with disdain. It stood, now able-bodied, breathing its shoulders up and down like mine. It didn’t need to though, I knew it wasn’t tired like I was. 

I tried it all. Getting a running start to shoulder-check my way through only sent us both equally crashing to the ground. I tried having it copy my position, maneuvering it behind the couch to trap it there, but it had no trouble shoving furniture aside whenever it got in the way. I threw my bedsheet over its head to blind it, only for it to calmly shake the fabric loose and let it fall to the floor every time

I watched the sunbeams creep across the living room until the sky outside grew fuzzy and pink once again. By then I was dog‑tired, just sitting on the floor. Of course it did the same, mindlessly showing me how pathetic I looked with no way to beat it. 

The feeling reminded me of high school whenever I’d fight with my parents. It’d never be fair. I was a kid and depended on them for everything, so it always felt like I had no ground to stand on in an argument. Anything I’d try to throw at them, they had ten times as much to throw back. I remembered slamming the door a lot during those times.

That’s when it clicked.

We both stood. I walked toward the doorframe, stopping just short of the threshold. The door was on the opposite side from me, but I mimed reaching for it anyway.

The thing copied me, its hand settling on the handle. I swung my arm through the air, and the thing kindly followed suit and slammed the door shut in my face.

I stood there in silence, savoring the sudden privacy. After a moment, I sidestepped a few times to be sure. I started to giggle when I saw its feet firmly planted on the other side of the door, not copying me for the first time in a whole day. Maybe with a bit of silence, I would be able to properly plan a way out of this hell.

The door shook abruptly as a thunderous bang struck it. I jumped at the sound and stood with my back to the opposed wall. The thing’s shadow thrashed around as it repeatedly threw itself at the door with shocking force. Getting faster, it began to moan once again as the door began to wobble loose on its hinges. With a final crash, splinters of wood broke free from the wall as the door toppled to the ground. 

A dark red stain overtook the door’s white paint, and I stared in horror as the thing slowly crept back into the room. Its head scanned around until fixating on me again, and slowly settled into the cowardly position that I must have been in.

It looked like its shoulder was broken, nearly flattened from beating against the door. A new surge of roots and vines reshaped the damaged area, and began making more tweaks to its figure. I watched as it developed breasts while thinning its arms and tapering its body to resemble a woman’s contour. Roots along its face shifted, opening a gaping maw and hollow eye sockets. It played with its new features, morphing its face randomly to get a feel for them.

“What do you want!” I screamed out, my voice still shrill.

It cocked its head like mine and smacked its lips as it tried to imitate my words. The hollowed out face made me gag, and I listened to the wet slapping of bloated face tendrils imitating my retching. I began to sob, and it formulated an uncanny frown as it tried to learn my idiosyncrasies.

I cried and cried as it continued to mock me. I couldn’t take it anymore. I ran to my bed and buried my face in the mattress to hide. As I did, I heard a heavy thud from the living room. When I looked back to the door, I saw the thing on its knees in the same way I was. The only difference was it was burying its face into a hardwood floor, not a mattress. 

I reared my head back and let it fall flat against the bed. It did the same, and allowed itself to fall to the floor. Again, only with force, I hit my head against the mattress. It copied, smashing its head into the ground and creating a notable dent in its flesh.

I slammed my head again and again, until my vision blurred, and it did the same. Dozens of times. I lost count. But it felt like the only shallow victory I could have against it. No matter how many times I repeated, even when its head was bludgeoned flat like an iron, it never slipped up its performance. 

This is about when I realized I wouldn’t be able to beat it myself. I feel canceled out, irrelevant. I had to change my approach to signalling for someone to find me.

When we stood up and approached one another, I noticed more. Tufts of hair sprouted above its hollow eye sockets, nothing like the red fibers below. Its flattened mouth reformed and small baby-like teeth wiggled themselves loose and fell on the floor. A few didn’t fall though, and I saw a set of developed molars had arranged ahead of its newly formed throat. I also noticed we were now the same height.

With the tears salting my cheeks, I wound up and punched it across the face with all of my remaining strength. It returned the favor, and I found myself waking up in the dead of night a couple hours ago with a sore jaw.

Dust coated my face and clothing as I strained to sit upright. My eyes adjusted to the darkness, and I saw the blurry shape of a woman sitting across from me.

“Charlotte?” I whispered. My mouth was bone-dry, and my stomach churned in need of food. “I need water. Please.”

I crawled towards her, and we met in the middle to join hands. Her skin was cold leather. It felt like shaking hands with soggy tree bark. I squinted and forced my eyes to focus. Charlotte wasn’t here, and that thing had grown more horrid than ever before.

I didn’t panic since I had no more energy to do so. I steadied myself on the bedpost as I got to my feet and observed this foul assimilation of my own face. It had skin. It still had a slight red pigmentation to it, but I could no longer trace the pattern of woven vines like earlier. The empty sockets on its face now housed a set of bloodshot blue eyes that locked onto my every movement. Tears raced down its cheeks as it hadn’t developed eyelids yet, and I watched as its hairy tongue struggled to find a comfortable position in its cheeks.

She opened her mouth.

“Ch-arrrr… lotte.” She stuttered with a voice like locust wings. Her chest expanded slowly, and I heard raspy air squeeze its way down her throat. “Wat-errr.” She continued.

I just stared at her mouth as she chewed on the words, practicing the shape of me. A thought surfaced through the fog in my head, and I mimed unscrewing the cap of a water bottle. She followed immediately, perfectly.

My backpack sat on the floor about ten feet behind her which was roughly the depth of my bedroom. I walked backward, guiding her with me until she stood over it. She watched me closely as I bent over and grabbed the air where my bag ought to be. She scooped the entire bag into her arms and carried it back to the doorway as I walked. 

I inverted my hands, and she dumped the contents of my bag onto the ground.

My laptop struck first with a solid crack, followed by clothes, toiletries, then my water bottle. I knelt so she would kneel, and had her pick up the bottle. I extended my clasped hand outward toward her, hoping she would hand the bottle over to me.

She stayed still, holding the bottle to her chest and copying every bit of my position except for that arm. It felt wrong, like for the first time I wasn’t alone with my own shadow. I was alone with a separate person.

I pulled my arm back and thrusted it forward again, making the motion obvious so it would know what it had to do, but it just stood there with its pinpoint pupils fixed on me. 

Hoping I could be quicker than her, I lunged for the bottle to rip it out of her hand. Her arm snapped backward ninety degrees, bending at the bicep as though she had extra joints, and held the bottle just out of reach.

I tried having her throw or kick the bottle over to me, only for her to sabotage the movement each time and avoid handing me anything. I tried to have her reach my phone, but the brick bedroom wasn’t deep enough for me to cover enough ground and position her near the TV stand.

I was able to get her to throw me my clothing or turn the light on and off, but she would never hand me anything I needed. Sometimes for fun, I would beat my head against the mattress again just to spite her, but she won. She’s intentionally keeping me here, and was just polishing her performance while I was still alive.

I have one more idea though, and that’s what you’ve been reading so far. She also refused to hand me my laptop, but I figured I could still get some use from it. I’m currently knelt at the threshold of the doorframe with her beside me. I’ve had her open the laptop and sign in while I watch the screen. It’s really tricky, but I’ve traced the position of the keys in the dust on the floor to mime typing. 

She’s slow to type, but I imagine this is the most complicated thing she’s had to learn to do thus far. It started as a word every minute or so, but now she’s getting the hang of it. She’s almost as fast as I am, and I’m scared she won’t have much left to learn from me once we’re done. She’s watched me scream, cry, sleep, speak, and even urinate in the corner.

I don’t know where Sean and Charlotte are. I don’t know why they left me, but please find them. Find this cabin. Find me. Snow piles are creeping higher in the windows and it's getting colder in here.

If you do ever meet me outside of this place, don’t trust what I say. I hate the cold, and I’ve never gone skiing nor do I know a good cabin to stay at. 

If you’re still unsure about me, hurt me.

Not badly, just suddenly. Make me bleed. Make me flinch.

If I don't, run.
