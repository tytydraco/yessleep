This subreddit went dark in my direst hour. It’s been a terrifying week.

“Route 11,” I said, after we’d been sitting in the van for hours.

I’d been reading your comments, and I agreed with the sentiment that the number 11 kept cropping up on our journey. Did it have sinister or safe significance? That was the question playing on my mind.

So, Sam flicked to Page 191, and I veered the van down a rough, rocky path through the forest. The story rambled for pages and pages about repeating scenery — endless fir trees — until the following passage:

*The forest approaches its end. You see the cluster of trees start to thin — something sits beyond the edge of the tree-line. A car park for visitors to the lake.*

“I think we should stop before the clearing,” I said. “It’ll give us time to read ahead and prepare.”

But what my son read next filled my entire being with a sickening sense of terror.

*“I think we should stop before the clearing,” You suggest.

But the forest hears you. The wind is its ears. Of course, a breeze cannot see. And you learn very quickly that the forest has eyes too.*

As Sam stopped reading, multiple noises erupted from either side of the van. I twisted my head and squinted out of the side window — it must’ve been around four or five in the morning, so the light of dawn had started to illuminate the mostly-darkened forest. Not much, but enough to see something that, days later, I still feel I can see in my peripheral vision.

An emaciated wolf on its hind legs.

The frightful figure peered around the corner of a tree, and then I noticed that there were dozens of the inexplicable abominations — each one peered around its own tree. They began to slink closer to the van, and their faces were horribly human. I wish I could describe them more effectively, but all I can really put into words is the sheer horror I felt upon eyeing those haunting creatures.

The way they moved was so terrifyingly unnatural, even for bipedal beings — they moved with a jolting, static, almost-lagging motion. It only deepened the churning sensation I felt in the pit of my stomach.

“Dad!” Sam screamed, as I realised I’d zoned out whilst he’d been screeching at me. “Page 230 or 235?!”

“What?” I fearfully croaked.

“Drive ahead or turn back?” Sam cried as the wolf horrors reached the edge of the trees, finger-like claws outstretched.

I answered my son’s question by slamming my foot onto the pedal, scorching past the mob of terrible creatures. Sam flipped frantically to Page 230 and continued reading.

*You drive through the clearing, hoping to put distance between your van and the wolves. This takes you along one final road, and your destination becomes clear as you round the top of the hill.*

“Dad…” Sam whispered joyfully.

“I see it,” I replied.

The lake.

It must’ve been about three or four thousand metres in length and a thousand metres in width. It was a phenomenal but petrifying pool of water. As the crown of the sun began to climb over the horizon, it caught the lake in a spectacular way. But it didn’t look beautiful to me. I didn’t share my son’s optimism that we’d reached the end. After all, wherever we were, it wasn’t real. We were still in the book.

“Keep reading,” I said, as I followed the road towards the lake.

*You park beside the water’s edge. A strange hum emits from below the surface. And, as you peer into the lake, you notice that there lies a road beneath the water. A road leading to a tunnel. Could it be the only way out of this strange place?

Drive around the lake to find another way — Page 240*

“I think we have to go into the lake,” Sam said. “If we look for another way, we might lose this opportunity.”

We did as the book said, and there was indeed an inexplicable road disappearing into the murky depths of the water. I couldn’t see a tunnel — it was too dark to see what lay at the bottom of the unfathomably deep lake.

“You always were better at these books than me, weren’t you?” I said.

“No, Dad. Like you said, Mum was the expert,” Sam replied. “I’m just as scared and unsure as you.”

“I actually agree with you in this case,” I said.

“Uh oh,” Sam gulped. “I think I want to change my answer.”

I smiled weakly and wrapped an arm around my boy’s shoulder. “Come on. Let’s get back in the van and pray the book takes us home.”

I started up the van’s engine as Sam flicked to Page 236. We were both breathing erratically, fearing whatever the book had in store.

*You gingerly dip your van’s wheels into the lake, finding that they miraculously stay glued to the underwater road. But the lake finds its way through the cracks of your windows, and you realise that time is of the essence.*

Sam and I screamed as water slipped through the edges of our closed windows. But we followed the road into the blackened unknown of the lake. And I hoped against all odds that the most terrifying route would be the truest one — the only way out, as the book suggested.

*You hear a mysterious tapping sound.*

As Sam read the words aloud, the sound of fingernails on a glass pane startled the two of us. Heart pounding, I moved my eyes to the rearview mirror.

And there, visible outside the van’s back door windows, was the Seafarer.

My son and I screeched as the man in the black raincoat smiled wickedly, scraping his razor-like nails on one of the back windows. I couldn’t physically make the van move any faster — I was already racing along the underwater road, aware of the fact that Sam and I were sitting in an ever-deepening pool of water.

There was the frightening sound of chipping glass, followed by a stream of gushing water. The man in the raincoat, face now seemingly rotting and eyeless, started to weasel his way through the glassless window. His body shouldn’t have been able to squeeze through such a tiny gap, but it did.

Sam and I wailed uncontrollably as the figure twisted around and around, spiralling through the gap into the van that was half-full of water. But something caught my eye through the front windshield. A deeper blackness at the end of the road — a tunnel.

Sam opened the glove box, pulling out the torch, and swivelled his body in the water to face the horrific man that was wading towards us. My son swung the torch for the Seafarer’s face, but the inhuman abomination grasped his wrist. Every urge in my body shrieked at me to stop and intervene, but I knew that we would surely drown if I were to stop driving.

I could only watch helplessly as Sam wrestled with the dead man — or what was supposed to be a man. The Seafarer seemed to be a pale, misunderstood rendition from that not-quite-earthly place.

The tunnel approached, but the Seafarer suddenly seized my neck with its free hand. I tried to scream, but no sound could escape my throat. I felt the corners of my vision blur as we neared the entrance, but then something unexpectedly and terrifyingly amazing happened.

I saw my wife’s face in the rearview mirror. Lara.

And suddenly, my neck was free. Sam fell back into the seat, floating in the neck-high water. We both watched as the Seafarer was yanked backwards by a spectral form in a blue hospital gown. I recognised that face. Those hazel eyes. That warm smile. There was nothing ghastly about Lara — the mother of my child and love of my life, who came to us at the edge of death and tore the seafaring phantom away.

I bawled silently at the undead form of my wife, disappearing behind us — arms wrapped around the Seafarer. But Sam and I couldn’t stop. We couldn’t turn back. We held our breath as we hurtled through the entrance of the tunnel.

We seemed to be trapped in an endless void, and I thought, for a horrible moment, that it had all been for nothing. I thought my boy and I would drown anyway. The only comfort being that we would find ourselves reunited with Lara. But that was a terrible thought. I didn’t want Sam to die. I wouldn’t let him die.

And then, when we couldn’t hold our breath any longer, a brilliant burst of light blinded us.

We were tipped forwards, and the van came crashing to the ground with a bone-shattering thud.

Water poured out of the open back doors, leaving Sam and I able to take massive gulps of breath. We found ourselves sitting in a drenched van at the side of the road on which our terrible journey began. A roadside sign to Carlisle was visible.

And I’m the final page of the book:

*You are free.*

We could’ve gone home, but we didn’t. I think the shock of events drove us forwards. We still had to scatter Lara’s ashes — after seeing her in that hellish world, it seemed more important than ever.

Of course, first of all, we needed another car. Phones. Everything that had been damaged or lost in the water-filled van. Then we burnt the book, so nobody would ever stumble upon it again. I just worry that there might be other books like it.

Earlier today, I was standing at the top of a beautiful hill in Inverness with my boy, and we were smiling. Actually *smiling* as we scattered his mother’s ashes.

Perhaps we’re both just happy to know that Lara is still out there. Somewhere.
