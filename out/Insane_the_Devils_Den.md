There's this house next door that has lied dormant for as long as I can remember.  Notice that I did not refer to it as a home.  That's because it never was and definitely will never be after last night.  Something happened last night. Something that is hard to really put into words.  It's more of a lived experience, but I'll try my best to communicate the feeling.

It wasn't a surprise that I'd end up in this situation.  Seeing as I have a curious nature that would kill even a lion.  That being said, I have lived next to this house for a solid 12 years.  In that span it has been vacant, well at least in the understood definition of the term.  I don't mean to imply squatters, but I didn't see anything of that nature.  

If there were vagrants in there they remain in there.  What I mean is that place is a resting grounds.  For what? I'll explain soon enough.  Try to explain at least.  I'm still processing it all honestly.  The fire department is still out there.  Damn flames just won't give up.  Figures...

Okay, enough stalling.  I've been what some may call obsessed with that house since I've lived here.  Ironically I've also been deathly afraid of it as well.  Last night was the night I decided to face my fears.  I just wish I knew what my fears face looked like before I did.

I waited until about 2:45 a.m. to make my way next door.  Stepping out of my front door with my flashlight in hand I scoped out the area before sneaking quickly into the backyard of the house.  As I rounded the corner I felt a snap under the weight of my shoe.  Looking down I was met with a bone snapped in two.  First thought was that it was animal bones.  Until I looked closer...

 At one end of the broken femur there was a foot.  A human foot.  Swaying like a Halloween prop in the wind.  My blood ran cold and I felt frozen in place.  Coming to my senses, I dropped the femur and I still don't know why but I entered the back door.  Maybe it was that voice...that cackle...what was so fucking funny.

 As I passed through the threshold the air became still.  Thing is the door was still open.  Accepting that strangeness I noticed an orange glow permeating the environment.  The windows were blacked out from the inside.  Explains why no one would notice.  Candles were littered everywhere. Along with cobwebs and the usual haunted house fare.

 Someone had to be lighting those candles though.  That's what got to me in that moment.  Turning around, the smartest thing I'd done all night, I felt a hand grasp my shoulder.  I felt my flesh melting away as my muscle lay exposed to the excruciating heat.  Biting my lips till they bled I turned my head.  "Leaving so soon..."was all I heard.  

 It was deafening, but at the same time a raspy whisper.  My eyes saw the claws ripping into my shoulder blades before rising to meet the yellow eyes above me with the diamond puplils.  Shrouded in darkness only broken up by the Orange candlelight that was suddenly becoming red.  The figure whipped me around so fast I felt my neck pop.

My head instinctively to the floor I noticed something.  Hooves...before I could think my head was forcibly pulled up.  Face to face with it, this creature grinned maliciously.  It had the head of a stallion with wings that looked like worn leather.  I'd go into more detail, but that's all I was focused on in that moment.  

I felt blood leaking down each side of my head.  Slowly losing consciousness, I felt my body hit the ground hard.  Through blurred vision, I could see the creature approaching.  I don't know what else to call it except adrenaline because the fact that I was able to get up let alone manage to have my necklace is a miracle.  The necklace has a crucifix on it if that helps.  

The creature seemed to retreat when in direct contact with the cross.  Taking advantage of this, I impulsively started knocking the candles down.  The crimson colored drapes lining the windows burst into a roaring fire in a instant.  I was out before I knew it.

 The fire department was there within twenty minutes.  I was in my bathroom looking at my wounds by 4.  The damage is concerning, but I'm too afraid to go to the ER.  What if they ask questions? What if I answer?  Why is there bones growing out of the wounds on my head?  That last one scares me the most

Guess that's what it's like living in the Pine Barrens.  I'm going to go try to sleep now if possible.  Maybe I've been asleep this whole time.  Come to think of it I feel more awake than I have in my life.  I'm not sure if that's a good thing.
