My wife and I have been happily married for 21 years, and she has always locked herself in her room at 5:00 every day since we got married, and she has never told me why. At first, I thought it was just a strange quirk of hers and didn't give it much thought. But as the years went by, her daily ritual began to weigh on me. 

I couldn't shake the feeling that she was hiding something from me. I would often knock on her door and ask if she was okay, but she would tell me she was fine and needed some time to herself. I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more going on. I started to notice other strange things as well. My wife seemed to be becoming more distant, and I often heard her talking to herself in her room. I began to worry that she was going crazy, and I was terrified of what might happen if I didn't find out what was happening. 

One night, I couldn't take it anymore. I decided to follow her and see what she was doing in her room daily. As I tiptoed down the hallway, my heart was pounding in my chest. I was terrified of what I might find. When I finally reached her door, I took a deep breath and slowly turned the handle. As I peered into the room, I was shocked by what I saw. My wife was standing in front of a large mirror, talking to someone on the other side. At first, I thought she was talking to herself, but as I listened more closely, I realized she was conversing with someone on the other side of the mirror. I couldn't see the person she was talking to, but I could hear their voice clearly. It was a strange, otherworldly voice that sent chills down my spine. 

I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I wanted to run, but something kept me rooted to the spot. I was terrified, but I also couldn't look away. As I watched, the conversation between my wife and the mysterious voice became more intense. I could see the fear and desperation on my wife's face, and I knew I had to do something to help her. I tried to step into the room, but as soon as I did, the mirror shattered into a million pieces. I was covered in shards of glass, but I barely felt the pain. All I could think about was my wife. As I looked up, I saw her standing there, looking at me with tears in her eyes. "I'm sorry," she said. "I didn't mean to keep this a secret from you. But I didn't want you to worry." I was confused and terrified, but I knew I had to stay strong for my wife. "Who were you talking to?" I asked. "It's my sister," she said, tears streaming down her face. "She died in a car accident 21 years ago. Every day at 5:00, I come in here to talk to her. It's the only way I can feel close to her." I was overcome with emotion and sadness. My wife had been carrying this burden alone for all these years, and I had no idea. I wrapped my arms around her and held her close as we both cried. 

But as we stood there, I heard a strange noise coming from the other side of the room. I turned to see a dark figure emerging from the shadows. It was a ghost, the spirit of my wife's sister, and she was angry. 

I tried to protect my wife, but the ghost was too powerful. The spirit flew towards us, her eyes glowing with hatred. I could feel the room getting colder and colder, and I knew we were in serious trouble. 

I grabbed my wife and tried to run, but the ghost was too fast. She flew in front of us, blocking our path. 

"Why did you abandon me?" she yelled, her voice filled with rage. "I've been trapped in this mirror for 21 years, waiting for someone to set me free. And you, my own sister, you left me here to rot!" 

My wife fell to her knees, sobbing uncontrollably. "I'm sorry," she said. "I didn't know. I thought you were gone forever." 

The ghost let out a chilling laugh. "Well, now you know the truth," she said. "And now you will pay for your betrayal." 

She reached out her hand and touched my wife's forehead. Suddenly, my wife's body went limp and collapsed to the ground. 

I was terrified. I didn't know what to do. But I knew I had to do something to save my wife. 

I gathered all my courage and stepped forward, facing the ghost. "Leave her alone," I said, my voice shaking. "She's done nothing wrong." 

The ghost turned to me, her eyes narrowed. "And what makes you think you can stop me?" she said. 

I didn't know what to say. But I knew I couldn't back down. I had to protect my wife, no matter what. 

I reached out and grabbed the ghost's hand, trying to break her hold on my wife. And to my surprise, she let go. 

The ghost let out a scream of rage and disappeared, leaving us alone in the room. 

I rushed to my wife's side and cradled her in my arms. She was unconscious, but she was alive. 

I knew we had to get out of there before the ghost returned. I picked up my wife and carried her out of the room, praying we would make it out alive. 

We made it out of the house and into the safety of our car. And as we drove away, I knew that we had escaped a terrible fate. 

But I also knew that we would never be the same again. The experience changed us both, and we will never forget the horror we faced. 

But as long as we had each other, we knew we could face anything. Together, we were strong, and nothing would ever be able to tear us apart. 

We drove through the night, trying to distance ourselves from the ghost as much as possible. But no matter how fast we went, we couldn't shake the feeling that she was still with us. 

As the sun began to rise, we pulled into a rest stop to rest for a few hours. I carried my wife into a quiet corner and laid her down on a bench, praying that she would wake up soon. 

As I sat there, watching over her, I couldn't help but feel guilty. If I had only listened to my wife and respected her need for privacy, none of this would have happened. 

But it was too late for regrets. All I could do now was try to make things right. 

As the hours ticked by, my wife's condition worsened. She was feverish and delirious, and I knew she needed medical help. 

I tried to call an ambulance, but my phone was dead. I knew I had to get my wife to a hospital as soon as possible. 

I gathered all my strength and picked her up, carrying her out to the car. I knew it was a long shot, but I had to try. 

I started the car and began the long drive to the nearest hospital. The road was long and winding, and I was terrified that we wouldn't make it in time. 

But I refused to give up. I kept driving, praying that we would make it to safety. 

As the sun began to set, we finally saw the hospital in the distance. I pulled into the parking lot and carried my wife inside, hoping it wasn't too late. 

The doctors rushed her into the emergency room, and I waited anxiously outside, praying for her recovery. 

But as the hours ticked by, my wife's condition only worsened. The doctors told me there was nothing more they could do. 

I was devastated. I had lost the love of my life, and it was all my fault. 

I sat by her bedside, holding her hand and crying, knowing she was forever gone. 

It was the saddest moment of my life, and I knew I would never be able to move on. I would carry the guilt and the pain with me for the rest of my days. 

But even in death, my wife was still with me. Her spirit stayed by my side, comforting me in my time of need. 

And although I knew I would never be able to hold her again, I was grateful to have had her in my life, if only for a little while. She would always be with me, and that was all that mattered. 

It took a long time for me to get over my wife's death. I was devastated and couldn't imagine ever loving someone else again. 

But as the years passed, I slowly began to heal. I started to open myself up to the possibility of love again, and that's when I met Alya. 

She was kind and caring, and she treated me with the respect and love that I deserved. She was everything my wife had been and more. 

As we fell in love, I knew I had finally found someone who truly cared for me. And as we walked down the aisle and exchanged our vows, I knew I had found a new home and family. 

But even as I moved on with my life, I never forgot about my ex-wife. She will always have a special place in my heart, and I will always be grateful for the time we had together. 

As I grew older, I learned to value the time I had with the people I loved. I never took a single moment for granted, and I made sure always to show my loved ones how much they meant to me. 

And even though my ex-wife was no longer with me, I knew she was watching over me from above, happy to see me finally find happiness again. 

I may have lost her, but I will always be grateful for the time we had together. And as long as I have the memories of our love, she will always be with me, in my heart and soul.
