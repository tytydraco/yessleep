It happened 8 years ago, and I still remember it to this day.  
I was very depressed after a bad breakup, and I will use the name J (alias).

We both live in a rural area, not in the center of a city, so there isn’t much activity anyway.  
I used high beam because the visibility wasn’t that great.  
I was taking a friend back to his house, it was at around 1am.  
Very dark outside, no pedestrians, a very eerie and lonely feeling, as expected from being outside at that time.

After bringing him back home, I drove back to my home and on my way back, I missed the turn I normally take on that route, so I decided to go forward and take the next turn instead.  
After a while, I noticed that where there was supposed to be a left turn (based on the navigation app), there was none. I kept driving forward, a little bit worried but nothing more than that.

After 5 minutes, the navigation app suddenly showed a blank map, no roads, no buildings, no streets, nothing - just an indicator with my position.  
I kept driving forward and after a few more minutes, the road became very foggy, I could barely see what’s on the road. I drove very slowly, beams on, until I decided to go back, I tried making a u-turn, very worried since visibility was poor, I started driving on the opposite direction, positive that I will get back to my friend’s house.

This is when things really started to get weird, I drove for around 15 minutes, the navigation app still showed that I am in the middle of nowhere.  I kept driving, expecting for the gps signal to fix itself, but nothing.   
I started to worry, my gas tank was at 1/4 of its capacity, and I have no idea where i am at.

I stopped the car, picked up my phone and called my friend, something answered, and I am saying something because the other side made noises, screeching, screaming and then it went silent. Then I heard, in a faint voice:

*”Welcome, J.”*

I immediately hanged up the phone, tried calling again but nothing, no answer.  
Trees to both of my sides, no cars near me (even though it was foggy and dark, I would probably see car lights if there were any cars in the area).

I decided to stay in the car, I locked my doors and tried to sleep inside , and wait for the morning.  
I turned my head to the side, trying with all my strength to keep the worries away, and just go to sleep. I then saw something, couldn’t even tell what it was, staring at me , I quickly change the sit position back to normal, panicking, and there was no one there, am I imagining things?  
I woke up 6 hours later, my phone says it’s around 8am now, but everything is still dark and foggy outside.

I opened the car door, went outside, slowly, silently… I looked around, no one to be seen. No owls, no birds, no humans, no cars, no buildings, just an endless road.

I looked around again, into the forest, then back at the car, and then I saw it - scratches on my car, 3 scratches that go for from the rear to the front of it, it was very deep, the car paint literally flaked from the scratches.

I decided to scream for help, but to no avail.  
I started going inside the forest, the only noise came from the tree bark and leaves that I stepped on. I was already panicking, worried and scared.  

It was then when I heard a familiar noise, I started walking towards that voice, it was my friend’s voice from inside the forest (It couldn’t be- I told myself, it makes no sense).

I decided to follow his voice, until I reached a stone, a brown stone, with very rough edges. His voice stopped, it was just me, the trees and that rock.  
I then heard something moving , not sure from where exactly, I started to run, panicking…. running with everything I have got, looking for the road back.  
There was no road, only an endless forest, it seemed like everywhere I go, is becoming a liminal space.  
I ran, and I stumbled on a rock, I saw something again, looking at me from between the trees.  

Broken leg, I can’t run, I decided to go slowly, maybe being quiet will save me. It was then when I saw my car in the distance, I did everything I could to reach it, but I passed out from the pain.

When I woke up, it was daylight and I was near the road with my car, and my friend’s house was right across.  
I then realized that this was all a dream, I haven’t slept much last night, and I was very stressed out, but what was the point of that dream? I had no clue, maybe it wasn’t supposed to have a point.

10am, I drove back to my house, later that day I looked at my phone, and in my pocket was a letter, written in red:

*”Dear J, we hope that you would visit us again.”*

It’s 3pm now, I went to the door, checked, and there was no one outside, it’s supposed to be sunny but instead, everything was dark.  
I opened my phone’s navigation app, it first showed me at my house (a sigh of relief), but then… it wrote:

 **”looking for a gps signal…”**

I opened the door, it was just me, my house and the road, the dark and foggy road.
