It was the last day of school before Christmas break and our teachers allowed us to use our phones in class. I was never really a bright student, so that was one of the only times I actually enjoyed school. At first, I was just messing around with my friend group: downloading and playing stupidly bad mobile games, watching these try-not-to-laugh videos on YouTube that were more of a try-not-to-cringe challange, as well as just taking stupid selfiesng . Suddenly, Emily, who was previously quiet and serious the whole time, spoke up:

"I-i have an idea... Might be stupid, but..." 

"Come on, don't be so shy.." - Said Ryan in his casual, sarcastic tone

"Ok... So I saw an urban legend that if you call your phone number backwards, something weird happens...You see a clone of yourself in crowded places, you reflection doesn't look right... I think it's fake, but it would be fun to try, right?" - she explained

  
I was always fascinated by urban legends, but really skeptical of them. Most of the time, I thought that they were more funny rather than scary. I even posted some of my own made-up ones to a forum. Looking back, they were pretty dumb, and clearly written by an 11-year-old who basically glued together Bigfoot, Bloody Mary and some other random thing. I liked Emily's idea, so i suggested we go to the bathroom with our phones and try it.

  
We asked our teacher, Ms. Willson for permission and she didn't even look up from her laptop. It was clear that she was counting down the seconds to the end of the school day, so that she can finally rest and spend time with her family. Being a high school maths teacher must be very tough, trying to teach brainrotted students who can't go 5 seconds without shouting some stupid meme. We went to the bathroom, closed the door, took our phones out of our pockets and called the backwards version of our phone number. Well, not all of us called, because Rachel, the "brave one" of our friend group, decided to back off. 

  
"I've got a bad feeling about this...It's weird, I've never had such a feeling before when I did risky stuff..." - She said in a very timid voice, unusual of her. I mean, she was the type who would explore abandoned mental hospitals in the middle of the night and not even flinch. But now... she clearly knew something we didn't, or her intuition was speaking to her and we were all idiots for continiuing on.

  
First, Ryan called. Then Kyle. Then Emily. Then me. We all got the "number currently unavailable" message. I mean, these phone numbers probably didn't even exist! We laughed in relief and scoffed at Rachel's growing concern.

"See? Nothing happened, silly!" - I mocked, foolishly, as I now know that she was right all along.

  
But that didn't ease her worry.



Coming back home felt like heaven. Like being released from jail after what felt like a life sentence. My mom made mac 'n cheese, my favourite meal. I enjoyed every bite. Say what you want, but mom's cooking is the best and I'm pretty sure no Michelin-star restaurant can replicate it, unless your mom is the cook. The phone thing was long forgotten, I just wanted to enjoy myself and my free time.

  
After dinner, I decided to play Minecraft on my computer. I really like Minecraft, but I'm not really the survival or hardcore type of player. I mostly build on creative mode and have gotten really good at it. i have entire themed worlds, like one is like a fantasy-type universe, another is post-apocalyptic, and another one is futuristic. I also really enjoy playing Bedwars, but I'm still new to it and pretty crap at it.

  
After about 2 hours of playing, my mom called me from downstairs. She asked me if I wanted to go to the mall to do some holiday shopping. I didn't have anything else to do, so I said yes. The mall was extremally crowded, typical for the holiday season. The lines were really long in almost every store we went to. Suddenly, i froze. In the middle of a crowd, I saw a face that looked very much like mine. Not in a "vague resemblance" way, not in a "same haircut and eye colour" way, in a "am I going crazy or is there a mirror somewhere here" way. I was quickly reminded of what I did earlier with my friends. The phone thing. Of what Emily said would happen. Seeing your face in a crowd. I looked over at my mom, who was casually browsing the magazines (it was a bookstore) like a scared child who just saw a big dog or a thunder cloud and asked her:

  
"D-did you see that... person in the crowd that looked like me... they disappeared already, but... I'm pretty sure i saw it."

  
"I didn't see it, I think your mind might be playing a trick on you, don't worry, it's nothing" - she tried to reassure me. But I knew that my mind wasn't playing tricks. That the legend was true. I knew it, but tried to push it down with rationalizations. 



When we got back, I was still terrified deep inside. I felt like I was in danger, even though I was safe. Like something was in my walls. And even worse, that I brought this upon myself. I called Rachel in a panic, explaining what had happened. I mean, she was "the brave one". But then I remembered her refusal to try the phone thing. The never-seen-before timidness in her voice, body language and facial expression. After a few minutes of silence, she speaks:

  
"I can't help you... sorry... But I need to tell you the truth. Emily, Kyle and Ryan all called me updating me on the challange we did earlier. They told me I was right. That I wasn't going crazy like they told me. That they were reckless, that they wished that they could go back in time and step away like I did... They reported seeing themselves walking on the streets, in the crowds, mirrors being out of sync... Scary. I haven't seen any of these things, which means that it was clearly linked to the challange. I think that it causes an interaction between you in this dimension and you in the mirror dimnesion. It causes them to cross over into your world...I don't know if it's harmful, but be careful. Avoid crowded places and mirrors, I guess..."

  
I was in shock. The realisation I have been pushing down hit me like a truck. It was REAL. It was happening. The mirror dimension was REAL. The alternate universes were REAL. And they could cross over into our world if you made contact with them. And we don't know about them. We don't know if they are malicious. We don't know if they are harmful. Like, we don't even know much about aliens from our own universe, let alone an alternate one! 



 I went to the bathroom to take a shower to clear my head, careful not to look in the mirror. But I still caught a glimpse of my reflection. It was just a little out of sync, enough to fully cement in my mind that this was REAL. After the shower I got dressed in my sleep clothes and tried to go to bed and pretend that this was all a bad dream. But i couldn't sleep. So i decided to play minecraft. But even on my creative worlds i saw a figure with my exact skin placing blocks. I watched youtube, but even that didn't distract me from my very reasonable fear of the alternate universe clone. 

  
My phone rings. It's Emily. She's crying. 

"It's real... I saw it... Please, tell me I'm crazy... tell me I'm going nuts..." - she said through sobs. I didn't know how to comfort her anymore. We had the same fear. We both knew this was real. No way to comfort her. It is 3AM now. She's still texting me, terrified, seeking reassurance. How do i comfort her? And how do I get rid of the mirror dimension twin?
