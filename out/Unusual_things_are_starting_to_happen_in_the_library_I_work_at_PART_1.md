I don’t know if I should go through with it, quitting my job that is. It’s a sweet gig. I get eight hours of silence per day, valued at roughly 14 bucks an hour. I sit on my ass all day, sometimes typing a few things into the computer if a client can’t find a book. If my instructions are unclear to the customer, it’s the only time I have to leave the desk ;

Just to disappear into the maze of bookshelves.

I honestly couldn’t believe it at first either. Why would a library pay someone so much ? I’m not particularly interested in books. And they weren’t really looking for a graduate either. So I guess it’s a win-win for all parties involved.

I clock in at 9 AM on the dot, and I have to clock at 5 PM on the dot too. It’s in my contract. Which isn’t out of the ordinary. But my employer insists on it. “It’s part of the rules,” he says. Once I clock out, I’m free to stay in the library and dick around or eat snacks before going home. The owner, my employer, doesn’t mind me staying, as long as I don’t get too loud.

Today, I heard a weird noise when I clocked in. I looked around, looking for its source… But there was nothing. Weird. It’s an old building, so surely, nothing out of the ordinary.

I made myself some coffee before sitting my pretty ass down behind my desk, trying to put on my best customer smile. I think my boss wants me to stop calling them customers. And I guess he’s right, we don’t sell anything, except maybe a subscription. But nobody asked about it yet. I’ll probably call them “regulars” going forward. I often see the same people after all.

I checked in some books throughout the morning. Not noticing it was the same blonde lady coming back each time, well that is until her fourth visit at least.

“That’s a lot of books, uh?” I said.

I tried to start up a conversation, which seemed to startle her a bit. She lifted her gaze to meet mine, which is the moment I took in the full features of her face. A somewhat healthy pale face, her hair in a cool braid, barely visible crow’s feet, naturally pink lips, and a cute mole under her left eye. Then she spoke in a broken voice, like she just recovered from a cold.

“Oh… So… You do speak.”

I was dumbfounded by her answer! And it must have shown, because as I tried to find my footing in this conversation thing I was apparently so inept at, her voice broke my train of thought.

“I mean, I tried to talk to you a few times in the last few weeks, yet you never answered,” she continued. “I thought maybe you couldn’t speak and stopped trying."

For all my faults, I had found someone who was probably just as bad as me at that whole socializing thing. But with a new angle of attack, I spoke up.

“I’m sorry ma’am. I must not have paid attention.”

“It’s alright, it seems to happen a lot with me, don’t worry,” she answered, with a hint of sadness in her voice.

But now that I think about it, I don’t remember that lady at all. I’m not bad at remembering faces, I should have remembered her. She’s pretty in spite of her age. And I’m a sucker for a pretty face. I took the time to get a good long look at her before answering. Which might not have helped the already awkward situation.

But I was sure of it now, I did not know that woman.

“Welp! If I can do anything else for you, please do give me a ring…” I caught myself. “I mean — there’s a bell. On the… On the desk.”

I pointed at the bell, blood creeping up my cheeks. I could feel myself blushing. Like the idiot I am. I quickly sat back down, taking her books for the fourth time, and logged them in — noting the return date, the titles.  
I noticed they were all borrowed in 1986. Oddly, no late fee.

I looked up at the woman, and she was already gone.

Odd. But no late fee implied I would keep my job even if she mysteriously disappeared in the library. Which she did.  
And my body was calling for food, so I did not give it much more thought. Surely she was just shy, and her task done, she went home.

Lunch time in the library was always a treat. The owner always brings a plate for me. And it’s really chef-level. I saw him reading culinary books when I stayed past my shift one time. So I guess he’s the one cooking? Today’s meal was marinated beef, with a julienne of carrots. And a delicious fudge cake as a dessert. Truly one of the highlights of my long day in the library.

During lunch break, the owner approached me.

“Miss Fay, you clocked in late today. Don’t clock out late.”

“Did I?” I wondered aloud.

I tried to find… Something in his eyes — annoyance, anger, a joke — anything. But it was only the cold realization that I did. He nodded. But didn’t really answer my question otherwise. After a few more moments of silence, he spoke.

“I hope you had a nice meal.”

He smiled, but didn’t really. His lips didn’t even rise. I’m still unsure what he meant. But it felt like suddenly I had been served my last meal.  
After this short interaction, he left, going to his office. Something he doesn’t often do when the library is open.  
I struggled to finish my delicious meal then went to clean the plate and tupperware for the fudge cake. At least, I wouldn’t leave dirty dishes behind if something happened to me.

Turns out, something would happen. Juste not to me. 6 books fell from their bookshelves, not all at once. For those who don’t know. That is not supposed to happen, either none of them fall or they all fall together. I made my way to them, and picked them up, one by one. I took some notes on my phone about which book fell down, in order :

\- 5 ways to sunday.

\- Prince's travel guide.

\- Me, myself and I, a self help book.

\- Roll tide : a southern encyclopedia.

\- Useful tips for cooking.

\- No way out.

After noting the titles, I wrote up a quick note to the owner. To have him take a look at those books and the shelves on which they were resting.

Then I watched and waited as the clock passed 4:59, and clocked out on the dot. Going home to my beautiful cat.

I took a nap, with him nuzzled up to me, and woke up in a cold sweat as a certain blonde lady screamed at me to listen in my dream.
