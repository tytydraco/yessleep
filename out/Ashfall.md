After not sleeping well if at all this past week, I think God finally gave me a sliver of peace. I found an old run down tunnel, too bad the sign was blasted off. I'm making a base here for a bit. I have to, it's getting bad again the *voices* the *smells* the way *i* was never the same again. I *need* more pills and quickly I'm not ready. 



**Rations**: 3 cans of ravioli's. 1/3rd of my water is left over. I'm still saving the 2 noodle cups.

Seeing the playground swings melted on the poles left me in a weird state. Its been days since I've seen someone let alone a kid. I'm a grown man yet I still wish I could feel the wind on my cheeks as I kick my legs to go higher just at least once again. 



I think it's really messing with me. Not seeing someone, **anyone**, I swear I saw a person standing next to the swings. They looked like static but as soon as I blinked it was gone. Maybe my mind is trying to fill the silence besides the constant humming in my head. 



I was walking back into my *troll base.* My personal name for it *I'm very creative*, too creative. Anyways i thought i heard footsteps, but when i turned around with my knife there was nothing but the rubble and the chill air.



*I need to up my dose.*



**Rations:** 2 cans of peaches. Full water, 2 noodle cups. 



**Needs:** winter coat, new gloves, boots, new gas mask.

I found a cabin in the forest nearby. It *has*….had a family. I knew what I was walking into seeing the dried blood that flakes at the touch on their doorstep. The air was so *thick* walking in. I saw the note one of them left i don't know what came over me but I took the note with me. Maybe its the simple words *‘still human’*. Burying their bodies I could see the marks and chunks of cannibalism on them. I buried them in a circle. It reminded me of the snake eating its own tail. *Was that wrong of me?* I can't tell anymore.  



I slept in the *troll tunnel* with my knife beside me. The nightmares came again. I woke up clawing at my arm. I don’t remember why — just the feeling that someone was holding me down. I hate that I still wake up like that. Even now, when there’s no one left to hurt me.

  


**Entry** 12: Night 30

I left the *troll tunnel*. Walking in the same woods I met someone today for the first time since…. 

His name is Chris, an older guy, we traded stories but it's clear we didn't believe each other. He told me about a pharmacy 5 miles north but I've heard that lie. 



*He asked what I'm running from.*



 I tried to play the clown and say “Radiation”. But he stared at me blankly. Right forgot these people existed.



 “Just kidding, like radiation exists. God truly is fearful”. After I told my favorite lie these days, he went back to normal. I'm not sure what scares me more, the things in my head or the unpredictable nature of humans. 



**Rations**: 1 can of peaches. Half a water. 2 noodle cups. 

**Needs:** winter coat, boots.

Chris patted my shoulder before leaving. For a second, it felt like a dead hand pressing into me — soft, damp, wrong. I yanked away before I could stop myself. Even at the end of the world, I’m still that freak who can’t stand a touch. I feel so lame for freaking out on him. Even in the end of the old world I'm still a weirdo in this new one. 



There's this voice I hear in the night. *“Demir, come home”*. I'm not sure what is saying it but it oddly comforts me till i spiral in my thoughts and it haunts me like the rest of my ghosts. 



**Rations**: 1 pb an j. Empty water. *Yuck*. 2 noodle cups.

**Needs:** winter coat.



**Entry** 14: Night 42



Found a broken mirror in some rubble on a trail. I didn't recognize myself for a solid minute. My hollow eyes that stare blankly. They say eyes are the window to the soul but nothing is there. 



*Like static.*



I smashed it more, can’t carry what you don't want to see.



**Rations:** nothing. Full water. 2 noodle cups.
