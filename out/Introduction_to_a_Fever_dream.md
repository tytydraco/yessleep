I am not sure to come here with my story or that I should go to the original subreddit channel, but I want to share my story in a whole. 

It all started yesterday around 8 o'clock in the evening when it all started to rise in my head, the floating feeling, dizziness afterwards so I went to my bed around 10 o' clock. I was in my bed until there was a nagging sound was heard in my head. I felt like falling down in my own clouds, as a spiritual person it was a normal feeling, I have many experiences in the lucid dreams and astral projection and this felt just the same.   
What was totally new for me is that I had a high feeling, my mind zoned completely out and this was a new feeling.   
I had before a wrong feeling of getting high in general, since my bad trip on cannabis I didn't use any THC, I am Dutch so this is no taboo, so before anyone would start about a usage of drugs or anything like that: I don't use since many I know fell victim of the stuff I am cautious especially with the help I receive from the shrinks. 

Yes I have multiple experiences with sleep paralysis and this wasn't even in the same context or looked like it. So I listen to music to calm down my nerves but what I listened I was surprised about it myself.   
I am a metal head so I normally listen to Epica, Nightwish, Ghost B.C. and such, but this night I repeated the song "Feel Good Inc" from the "Gorillaz" which was the whole other side from the sub-culture I am in. I didn't listen to the Gorillaz since 2020 and if I listened to some songs I needed the beat, which was in total in 2020 5 times over the whole year.  
Normally I am dressed in black with a band shirt or in a knitted dress, but never in a hip-hop street style, best part I loathed the culture due to bad experiences with these people. 

What happened the night when I listened to the song is that the song was in repeat in a weird way, like my body repeated the song over and over and over again, some tunes would pace up my whole bpm before it crashed down again.   
So I was wondering what was this band and who made this?   
The answer would still confusing as it is a "Fictional Virtual Band" which is in other words of science "Non-existent" but there are stories that the universe of Gorillaz takes place in the whole other universe.  
I read how the "creator" came up with the whole concept which was in one line told: "Stand out on MTV"   
the article said as well that he had an idea to create a fictional band in form of cartoons and so on the phases or chapters of this band, interesting to say the least but a rabbit hole if you want to understand, because of a heavy headache I stopped reading.

Here is where it went "wrong"  
I fell asleep with the song and felt like drifting off into a place no one would have the focus what is happening. My mind is normally a dark place, but this was completely out of context. I can remote my dreams since I was a little girl, and this was nothing I could do about it at all.   
What was this world everything seemed to be on crack or acid, the buildings were painfully bright colored and cladded with graffiti, weird on its own. We have in Holland  a theme park in the "kind-of" theme of what I try to describe, that theme park is Walibi Holland, nothing made sense in the world.   
I looked in the reflections of the windows as I saw myself, I stood out from anyone, everyone was high bright colored, bright pink, purple and blue hair would be normal, but I... I was in dull colors.   
Best example I can give is a commercial for washing products.   
Only thing was bright colored were my eyes, the rest was dull.   
Everyone was looking at me like I was a foreigner, everything was cartoony.   
The dream went on and on and on as the things were only weirder and less sense, they all called the place for who were there "Plastic Beach" or "Crackhead Island" alright never heard about these names but it would dawn on me that I wasn't at home at all.   
The smell were heavy as it was normal for the people to use, they were all high, on drugs or alcohol.   
Yes I drink but only ciders and other alcoholic beverages, nothing heavy on the day or in general, only in the weekends, alcoholism is in my family unfortunate.  
The people in the city were all into the love, sex, drugs and the Gorillaz, not knowing it was their Island. 

My skin was grey in my dreams, normally I would have freckles during the warm summer day's which was for them all day life. But my skin was grey, dull and weird.  
They pointed at me as I walked the streets.   
I was on point of rage and hurt as it wasn't my best experiences with the drugs, in this universe it was a way of life, culture, it was "use to fit in" one thing I refuse to do at all times. 

5 o'clock in the morning I would wake up in cold sweat, but didn't knew I continued listening the song over and over again, in these 12 hours I listened the song 40 times.    
I returned to my research to the band and what I found was weird, everything in my dreams was canon to the "story" Gorillaz had, I am still trying to come down from my sleep as I had migraines all over the day.   
I ate more than enough but still feeling if I am in a bad trip, I hope it will subside soon enough, my head is feeling like it would explode anytime soon, my focus is low as I can't work on my projects due to the experience.
