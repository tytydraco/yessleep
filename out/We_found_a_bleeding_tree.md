When I was younger, my older brother Theodore and I would spend most of our time in the mountains and forests just outside of town. There wasn’t much else to do in our secluded little neck of the country but that didn’t matter. We would play pirates, cowboys and indians, and even as Jedi after we saw *The* *Phantom Menace*. Eventually, as we grew older, we moved on to hunting and exploring. We would push ourselves deeper and deeper into the forest every time we went out.

It was late October when we went deeper into the forest than ever before and ever since. 

I had just turned thirteen and in the eyes of my parents, was able to graduate from bow hunting to using a rifle. It was an old bolt action that my grandad used but to me, it was like being given the keys to a Ferrari and I handled it as such. So when Theo knocked on my door and asked me if I wanted to try it out, I didn’t hesitate to jump on the opportunity; if only I hadn’t persisted in pushing so deep into the woods.

“See him right there,” Theo whispered. 

We were crouched down in a bed of leaves at the top of a small bluff. Through the uneven rows of trees, we could see the front end of a buck. 

“Yeah I see him,” I whispered, the rifle shaking slightly in my arms. 

I had shot before just never *at* something.

“Wait until-” Theo started.

A loud crack echoed through the barren trees and the buck jumped away. Its outline slowly grew more obscure as it darted through the trees until it finally disappeared.

“What the hell, John!” Theo shouted before shooting up and sliding down the bluff. 

“I’m sorry!” I whined. 

“You don’t shoot until you have a clear shot!” Theo’s voice echoed through the woods, “shit you hit it though.”

“Isn’t that good?” I asked, catching up to Theo.

“No! This isn’t bow-hunting rabbits! We don’t want it to suffer.”

“I’m sorry,” I shrunk back.

“Come on,” Theo said, “we’ll follow the blood trail.”

If I hadn’t taken that shot, if we had just gone home empty-handed, we would have never found it. Why did we have to go chasing after that buck?

Normally this time of the year, the trees still clung to at least some of their leaves like a blanket in the cold. This year was different. The trees stood barren with piles of leaves littering the ground. It made it easier to see farther away and this is how we were first able to see the structure. It was vague in the distance but as we drew closer it began to take shape. The fuzzy lines of nature gave way to the harsh lines of man.

It was a riverboat. The kind of multi-story floating hotel with a large paddle wheel on the stern. The paint was faded and peeling and every single window was shattered. I could just make out the name stenciled upon one of the side panels. *Roxanna*.

Only that wasn’t what kept us staring; a massive tree was growing in it. The shattered remains of the pilot house had been engulfed in its enormous trunk. Thick roots wrapped themselves along the decks and spilled overboard into the calm waters below. The tree was slowly absorbing the *Roxanna*, even the deck was beginning to buckle under its immense weight. 

But the *Roxanna’s* entanglement with the tree wasn’t what made the whole scene eerie and slightly terrifying to my young mind. It was the tree itself. Monstrously huge, the bark was a dark red that peeled away from the trunk like sheets of paper. Blood-red sap spilled from beneath these sheets, ran down the trunk, and dripped from the branches leaving bloody splatters across the frame of the *Roxanna*. Its branches hung off the trunk like massive arms and sprouting from the branches were thousands of bone-white leaves, each with the outline of an eye stenciled on their flesh. 

“Woah,” Theo muttered, seemingly forgetting about the wounded buck.

My gaze shifted from the wreck to Theo and back again. Theo’s bad shaving job left patches of peach fuzz that shined blonde in the setting sun's light.

“Can we… can we go home?” I felt uncomfortable there, like standing outside the open closet door at night. 

It was like we had trespassed on something hallow. We weren’t supposed to be there. Theo either didn’t feel the same or didn’t care. The fear of childhood being suppressed in his sixteen-year-old brain.

“No way we got to show people this,” Theo said, stepping closer to the wreckage.

“It’s getting late, we should really go,” I said, clutching my rifle close as it was the only thing that made me feel brave. Even then it felt small.

“Don’t be such a wuss, this is the coolest find I’ve seen. Might have to bring a lady out here sometime,” Theo said, shooting a wink back in my direction. 

I don’t think he had ever talked to a woman.

“Theo, can we please leave.”

“Hang on hang on, if I can get one of those branches it would prove this exists.”

“Who cares we can just tell people it's here.”

“If you see a ten-point buck, do you run home and tell Mommy? No. You get your rifle and shoot the son-of-a-bitch,” Theo said, walking a little way up the bank of the river. He was searching for something in the trees.

“I’m going to tell Mom you’re cursing.”

“I don’t care,” Theo said, spotting what he was looking for and trudging into the leaves.

“Theo!” I called out. 

The hairs on the back of my neck tingled as I stood there alone. A million eyes stared down at me from above. The sky was growing darker with each passing minute and there I was, alone with a monster. I felt cold staring back into those eyes. The wind blew past me whipping the fallen leaves into a frenzy.

Theo marched out of the woods again carrying a long, mud-covered log. He gave me a triumphant look as he wedged it into the rocky bank, the point just barely reaching the closest edge of the *Roxanna’s* hull. The water was dark and murky with a layer of red and orange leaves slowly moving downstream. It was impossible to tell how deep the water was. 

“I don’t think this is a smart idea,” I said.

“Just watch my stuff then,” Theo said, shrugging out of his jacket.

Carefully testing the log, making sure it was steady, Theo gingerly worked his way up on all fours. He made it to the *Roxanna* and gave me a thumbs up.

“See. No problem,” he said before disappearing into the bowels of the *Roxanna*.

“Theo! Theo, can we leave?”

Theo appeared on a walkway in the second story.

“It’s crazy in here!” Theo said with a wild smile, “Like crazy crazy you gotta see this!”

“No thanks.”

“Suit yourself,” Theo said, disappearing inside again before coming out, “I forgot my knife, can you get it to me?”

“Knife?”

“Yeah, the knife in my jacket pocket.”

“I don’t want to go over there.”

With a large sigh, Theo disappeared again before reappearing where he got on at the other end of the log.

“Just walk it up halfway,” Theo said.

“No, I-”

“Don’t throw the damn thing! Just walk it up you wuss.”

The eyes staring down at me watched my every move as I slowly grabbed the knife and approached the log. Carefully, on my knees and one free hand, I crawled my way up the log. It cracked and wobbled under me. If only I hadn’t listened to Theo.

My hand slipped. The thin layer of mud and decaying leaves took my one hand out from under me. I felt my nose crack as my face hit the wood. The world spun as the cold embrace of water enveloped me. 

Darkness. The next moments exist as a haze. I remember thrashing about. The leaves stuck to my body like a film. Water and blood shot up my broken nose. My clothes were waterlogged and dragged me down. I couldn’t breathe. 

The burn of water in my eyes wasn’t worth the blurred vision it gave me. I couldn’t see anything. Only dark water stretched all around. Then I saw it, tendrils unfolding from the deep, stretching out and slithering through the water like snakes toward me. If I could breathe, I would have screamed. The tendrils wrapped themselves around my ankles and dragged me deeper. I felt them bite into my skin and a cloud of red rippled from my ankles. I kicked and thrashed but was quickly losing energy. Darkness encroached on the corners of my eyes. 

Water crashed above me just as everything faded to black.

I woke up on the banks of the river what had to be several hours later. It was black outside and I was cold and wet. My whole body was sore, my nose was sensitive to the touch, and every breath I took felt like I had nails in my lungs. 

“What the hell, Theo!” I shouted causing me to break into a heavy coughing fit.

Theo didn’t respond.

“Theo! You jerk! I told you we should have left!” 

Still no response. 

“Theo?”

I was alone on the bank. Overhead the eyes stared down; hungry and wrathful. In all my youth and the years that would follow, I never once ran as fast as I did that night. Branches struck my face like whips as I crashed through the trees, tripping several times but not letting it slow me. My lungs were tearing themselves apart but I couldn’t stop.

As the lights of home began to shine through the woods, I began to scream.

“MOM! DAD!”

Dad burst out the back door with a shotgun in hand, Mom right behind him. The blood drained from their faces as they saw the blood that coated my clothes. It was far too much to have simply come from my nose or the deep slashes around my ankles. 

“Where’s Theodore?” Dad demanded.

I couldn’t say anything more except to point into the woods where I had just come from. My parents looked at each other before Dad sprinted into the woods. I collapsed into Mom’s arms and cried like a toddler. Every time I closed my eyes all I could see were those hungry red eyes staring at me. 

Dad never found Theo. The local sheriff put a search party together the following day. No one ever found anything. I tried telling them about the *Roxanna*, about the bleeding tree, about the tendrils dragging me into the deep. No one believed me. 

As the years passed, I was told it was an emotional response to a traumatic situation. My brain processed what I saw and turned it into a fairytale that would help me cope. That’s what they told me at least. I don’t know what to believe anymore. 

My parents put strict limits on how much I was allowed outside after that. I still snuck out without their knowing, but I never found the *Roxanna* again. After a couple of years, we eventually moved closer to the city and that’s where the story of my brother Theodore ended. 

I don’t know why I feel like sharing this now. Maybe because it is that time of year again. Maybe it’s because I went back home to the mountains. Maybe because I’m standing in the backyard of our old home, staring into the woods. Maybe what it really is is a selfish desire for the truth to be immortalized. That I am not coping. That the scars around my ankles were not made by jagged rocks or bears. That what happened to Theo is the truth. That after I cross the woodline, no matter what happens to me, the truth will be out there. 

Believe this if you wish. Whether or not you do, please take the story of Theo and me not as the ramblings of a madman, but as a warning. If you’re out in the deep woods, do not go looking for the bleeding trees.
