I don’t know how long I have left, I don’t know how long it will take for it to kill me, but it sure as hell won’t be fast…

I’m an eighteen year old male from Los Angeles, California. I’m your typical, run of the mill high school student, I do sports, go to the games with my friends, and have a boyfriend I love with all my heart ( yes, I’m gay ), but unlike everyone else I know, I seem to have a huge obsession with the medical field.

I thought, for fun, I would do a small project to boost my terrible grade in biology, on viral out breaks that have occurred in our city/state in the past century…

God…I shouldn’t have done it…

My bio teacher loved the idea, and said she would gladly boost my grade from an F to an A if I gather a certain amount of info from any hospital in the city.

For weeks and weeks I searched for a hospital that would allow me to go through their files, and try to find a pattern in viral outbreaks that they had dealt with, to no avail.

Most hospitals rejected me, “we don’t let anyone go through our files with our authorisation, sir”, they said…

But one…let me

One hospital, on the outskirts of downtown LA, actually let me go into their files and look, I was ecstatic, I was so happy that I could finally get my grade up! But something was off…

The file room stank, it stunk of rotting meat and dried blood ( but then again, it’s a hospital ) the room was littered with rappers and tissues, and even a snot covered face mask…disgusting
 
But I prevailed, I ignored the vile mess and went to look for any patterns…but something else…caught my eye…

“ project Achilles “ it said on its folder, in bold red letters, it’s author was smudged by coffee, but looking at the state of this place, that was the tidiest thing yet.

In my head, I thought “a little look won’t hurt, I mean, what if this will be enough to boost my grade”

My fucking head, it was wrong as usual..

I flip through the oddly bloodied pages, reading the recorded results of the project, from what I read, it was some sort of viral testing on humans, a cancer treatment with people with brain cancer, but something went wrong..

As I continued reading the texts, all written by different doctors, it got more…disturbing…

They had gathered twelve fourteen year olds, six boys and six girls, each with brain cancer, with which they would test a virus that they simply named “ Achilles”

Oh god…oh god, oh god, oh god

These poor children, I’ll read from what I remember to you from the files…

It said: 

“ All children have been changed into gowns and placed within their own testing chambers, separated from one another, injection will commence…now.

All children have been injected with Achilles, as soon as the needle touched their arms and injected a drop of Achilles into their blood stream, they began to seize, vomit and scream in pain, the test must go on.

Subject six has already died from exhaustion, but all remaining eleven have survived, it has been five minutes since the injection process began, and each child has grown exponentially.

Their once five foot five bodies have now exceeded the eight foot six mark, and still growing, as I write this report, the children are banging against the glass, as their eyes and mouth ooze a thick black substance, that seems to burn their skin, all children display a sense of anger and rage, as they bang on the glass, their screams don’t seem to be of pain, but of anger “

The report goes on to explain that, the cancer has been burned away, but something as replaced it, the virus had accumulated into a huge mass on their heads”,   

but what is next made me run from that hospital in tears, right the way home…

“ it’s has been exactly seven days since the project began, and we have already lost half of our staff to those…those THINGS, they have all been bitten and have transformed into the same things as the children, they are not human, WHAT THE FUCK ARE THOSE THINGS, their teeth are huge and sharp and they use them to rip apart anything that moves, I’m trapped, all I can do now…is beg for mercy…”

I beg of you, to whom ever reads this, DO NOT go looking for that file, its content goes much more dark, but I suppose that is what is killing me.
 
As I hang my noose and prepare my stool, the final thing I can write, to my family, friends and my precious boyfriend…

once hell is full, the dead will walk the earth…beware project Achilles…
