Hello, my name is john, I live in northern Maine kinda close to Canada, and I struggle with schizophrenia. I state that not to just stand out in the community here but also to provide context to my experiences. Growing up I had what you could call a normal American life, lived in the suburbs, my parents had a decent amount of money, and most of my younger years were in the 90s, for context I was born in '93. I loved all the clich√© things from the moon boots to the Pokemon games. to be honest, id say that those years were the golden ones before the madness, the anxiety, stress, and new age wars. but in reality, it could just be that we didn't have to deal with the very real-world problems you have to as a child.  before my dad died he was an astronomer who had his very own homemade telescope he would show me everything in the observable area in space with what his telescope could. my dad died in 2001 it was a cold winter night and they found his body two miles away in a ravine all cut up and broken, they chalked it up to hypothermia but that's beside the point. Everything seemed fine until about a month ago after I was diagnosed and started taking my medication. you see this was the start of what I would call the start of my descent into madness. about a week into taking my medication, I started to hear voices but not just regular voices they were in a dialect, and they sounded very old. At this point, I couldn't find the source of the voices but they started off whispering, at this point I really didn't think much of it. maybe it was my mind just playing tricks on me or my condition getting worse. fast forward two weeks later with no instances, nothing out of the ordinary happening. then the dreaded night came.

**Last Sunday Night**  
**2:45 AM**

I kept hearing the words repeat over and over my house was so dark in the lonely Maine wilderness with nothing but the bitter cold hissing through the air outside my windows like a vicious snake waiting to strike its prey. I slowly began to walk down the stairs to my living room looking around in the dark like a lost soul trapped in purgatory. my television springs to life like it was Frankenstein's monster and the words repeated over and over, stabbing my eardrums like a needle driving through flesh.

**"wanakuja, wanakuja, viumbe vya mwanga...mabwana juu ya anga"**

This happened for 15 minutes straight, then all of a sudden it stopped nothing but static filled the empty house. after about 10 more minutes I decided to turn off the television if I'm being honest something felt off the rest of the night.

For the past couple of weeks, I've been hearing the same thing play every night at the same time like clockwork. Nothing else has happened but that's why I'm writing this now I heard a giant crash in my backyard, It's midnight and the static hiss is pulsing but my TV is off and the sound is coming from outside. it's like something is calling to me inside the white void of noise begging, longing for contact.....
