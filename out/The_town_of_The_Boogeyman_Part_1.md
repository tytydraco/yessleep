Yes, you've heard many tales about him, the infamous **Boogeyman**, and you've grown old enough to know that it's fake.

What if I told you, *it's not.*

***October 17th, 2010.***

*Me and my wife* were looking for a new home, this was the time the internet was getting popular, and we got a computer. I found a sketchy website on a sketchy search engine, but we thought: to hell with it, what do we have to lose?

&#x200B;

Little did we know, we would lose ***everything.***

It was a sketchy town, on the outskirts of the state. 

But me and my wife were struggling with money, and it was a *cheap* house.

So there we went, we packed our stuff, bought the house, and moved in.

\-----------------------

***October 28th, 2010.***

I was starting to become friends with my neighbours. We were all getting along, and my wife had made some new friends. It was beginning to be time for halloween soon, and I asked my neighbours how they were gonna decorate their home, they gave me recommendations for a local store, it's name was **JJ's Big Guns,** which I thought was a little silly for a halloween store, and sounded like a Gun Shop name, and I drove on there. Turns out, it *was* a gun store. I was confused so I drove back home and asked him why he sent me there, and he told me: **"Oh yeah, I forgot. You're new here. Heard of The Boogeyman? He comes to collect a soul every halloween."** I laughed and told him, "Haha, *alright.* Now actually, do you know any halloween stores?" and he told me "**It's** ***not*** **a joke. I'm being serious, You haven't known?"** at this point I was just frustrated, and went back inside my home, I booted up the computer, and found a halloween store.

***2 HOURS AWAY?! I*** **exclaimed,** but, I didn't wanna seem like an asshole. So I told my wife that we should go on a little road trip to celebrate our anniversary early, since it was on halloween, yeah we got married on *Halloween.* It never worked for us to be on Halloween so we always celebrated early. So we hea**ded east, and I pretended to spot the place,** ***"Oh look honey, it's a halloween store! Let's go shop there."*** She agreed. 

So we bought the supplies. I decorated the house while she was writing emails on the computer. All my neighbours looked at me like I was a weirdo. I thought, *" They  must be extreme christians, who doesn't celebrate halloween?"*

\-------------------------

***October 31st, 2010***

The night has come, but no children have. I thought it's because nobody had decorations up except for me. All my neighbours had guns ready, the night fell.

Then all of a sudden **SCREECH!** 

It felt as if I moved to a new dimension. But I didn't, the sky turned red for a couple seconds, and then... *Back to normal.*  I went running to my room, to tell my wife what happened, except... I couldn't. **She was there,** ***wailing in pain*** 

Her limbs were chopped off- and, and... I'd rather not get into the gory details, but let me explain what I saw, Blood everywhere, a cross made out of blood on the floor. and only her torso and head were left. I passed out at the sight.

\---------------------------

***November 1st, 2010***

I woke up in a hospital, with all my family telling me "**WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? YOU SICK BASTARD" Then, I** ***remembered.*** My neighbours all telling me about this Boogeyman, and all of them were armed, I asked my family "Is she okay? PLEASE PLEASE TELL ME SHE'S OKAY!!" They told me, **"NO SHE DIED OF BLOOD LOSS BECAUSE OF YOU!!"** The doctors escorted them out, while they screamed at me.

I knew I was innocent. and I wanted to fuck up whoever did this to my wife. I told the doctors "It was the Boogeyman!!" They told me ***"how could you joke about this, you sick fuck!"*** I told them I needed to go immediately, and I jumped out of the hospital bed with all my might and pushed them away and made a run for the door. Every person in that hospital chased me down, even my family, and my short tempered father, but I ran with all my might and stole someone's bicycle, which wasn't even that useful, not compared to my father, who got in his car and chased me down, he almost crashed into me! Then, the bicycle slipped from a puddle into the depths of the woods, carrying me with it. I rolled over and over and crashed into a tree. By this point I had broken my leg, but didn't matter, I needed to run, and run quick. I hopped on one leg and after what felt like an hour of hopping, I finally found a place to hide. 

&#x200B;

3 hours later, Night has fallen. My father was the only one searching for me. and I heard him shouting through the woods, "**EVER SINCE YOU WERE A KID YOU WERE AN EMBARRASSMENT AND A LITTLE TROUBLE MAKER! YOU MISTAKE!"** 

After a couple hours, he gave up. It was survival of the fittest now. I needed to get back home, and kill whoever did this to my wife. I hopped around for what felt like hours, but I reached the town. I was a wanted criminal by this point. I found my neighbour and asked him, "How does one kill this Boogeyman?" and he told me that **"you need the blood of a victim and do a ritual by drawing out a cross, thats how you summon him, it's his mark."** I had *enough* I needed to kill him, I drove to the hospital, knowing that everyone was looking for me.

&#x200B;

I was gonna break into the hospital to find her blood.
