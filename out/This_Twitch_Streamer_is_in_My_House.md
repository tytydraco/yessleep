I (23f) need some help, I think I've had a paranormal event but no where on the internet has been any help in working out what is going on. 

Two weeks ago, I was constantly watching content on streaming platforms. This was because it was semester break, and most of my friends from university had travelled overseas for their break. I could not afford that luxury of seeing the world. So instead, I browsed trending streams from the comfort of my small apartment. One night, I came across an unusual stream.

The title read, “Streaming for 10 days WITHOUT SLEEPING.” Curious at how someone could physically do this, I started watching. The streamer, who had short, brown hair with dark eyes, sat at his desk in what appeared to be his bedroom. He must have had a bad web camera, as his footage was grainy. A slow hum could be heard in the background. The broadcast started a day ago, so the streamer was still quite engaged with the online chat.

“Hello everyone, for those who are just joining, as you can see from the title, I am trying to stay awake for 10 days straight.”

Checking the viewer count, I saw there were only about 50 people watching the stream. I stuck around for a few minutes, then decided to watch something else.

Later, I messaged my friend, Rebecca, about the stream. We both studied the same degree, psychology, and had just finished our first year. She, however, was back home with her family in the states. We talked about how it must be impossible to stay awake for 10 days straight.

Two days later and I had completely forgotten about the stream. It was only until I was on the explore page again that I saw his stream. Again, I was curious so I started watching. It was very different this time. Standing up with his head down, the streamer was getting gently pushed back and forward between two other people.  I assumed this was to keep him from falling asleep.  His body was limp and lifeless, like a puppet that was no longer being held up.

They were whispering something, as if they didn’t want the audience to hear what was being said. The usual “hum” was in the background, but this time, there was a “click, click, click,” then a pause, then the clicking would start again. Between the clicks and the streamer’s body motionless body being gently pushed back and forward, I decided to stop watching. Something didn’t feel right.

Three more days passed, and again, I found myself lying on my bed, looking for something to watch. I found the same stream, this time, however, it was titled, “HELP ME, I’ve streamed for SEVEN DAYS straight!” I clicked on the stream without thinking. This time, the streamer stood by himself, head bent forward, looking to the ground. He swayed slowly. There was no clicking but I could hear the blowing of wind.

Before I could leave, I received a message from Rebecca. I replied to what she had said, and I also mentioned how weird the stream was getting. She agreed it was weird, and after a bit of back and forth, she announced she would have to go to bed. I wished her goodnight.

I clicked over back to the tab. The tap opened, and there I saw him. The streamer was at his desk again, but this time, he was looking directly into the camera. His face was pale and his eyes were red. Two bags underlined his eyes. Slowly, the corners of his lips raised into wide grin.

“Hello Jane, how are you?” he croaked.

This made no sense; how could he know? My username didn’t have “Jane” in it. I paused. I didn’t know what to do.

“Don’t you want to chat?” he whispered, still with that unsettling smile.

“How do you know who I am?” I wrote in the chat box.

His eyes flickered to the left, reading the message, then looked straight ahead.

“I think we just share a connection. There’s something about you.”

Was anyone else seeing this? I looked over to the viewer count, and only saw the number “one.”

“I’m going to call the police, tell me why you know my name!”

Again, his eyes looked over to the left, then straight. “I think you should come here so I can tell you more, it’ll be easier.”

“I’m never doing that.”

Suddenly, his eyes twitched. He still smiled.

“You. Don’t. Have. A. Choice.”

I closed the tab. Horrified of what I had witnessed, it was a while before I could get to sleep that night. My brain was in overdrive. How did he know me? The rain gently landing on my window didn't help my uneasiness. It was a long time before I fell asleep.

The next day, I was determined to go to the police and report him. But I needed more evidence. Maybe I could get a recording of him explaining how he got my name. That'll give the police more information to work with. With my laptop in hand, I moved to the dining room in my apartment.

Opening the streaming platform, I searched for his stream intentionally for the first time. The title read "HELP ME, I've streamed for EIGHT DAYS straight!" Taking a breath in, I opened the stream. He was at his desk still, looking at his second monitor. He immediately snapped to look straight at the camera, again with that horrible smile.

"Hello Jane."

My fingers wouldn't move. It was felt like he was looking straight through my soul. Finally, I typed in chat.

"How do you know me?"

Again, his eyes darted to the left, then looked straight at me.

"You know how to find out. Come here." He leaned closer to the monitor.

"This is it, final warning, tell me what you know or I go to the police." I pretended to be brave.

Suddenly, his smile vanished.

"You won't be able to."

I had had enough. I closed my laptop in an instant, only to reveal the same face looking at me in my dining room. This time, he was smiling again.

  
I've never sprinted so quickly out of my house. After I had some distance between myself and the house I hurriedly called the police. They couldn't find any intruder inside my home. It's been two weeks now I can't move around my house without thinking that something is lurking around the corner. Has anyone else had any experiences like this? Or am I just going insane?
