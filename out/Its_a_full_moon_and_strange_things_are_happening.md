So I'm currently writing this in my living room, something is wrong with where I am at at the moment, I don't know whether it's the moon or the light or whatever it is but something is strange. I will tell the story.

&#x200B;

So, it started off like a normal evening, I was just on my phone watching Tik Tok listening to r/nosleep stories to which I then got bored and wanted to read them on my own, I went on r/nosleep which to I was greeted with a huge selection of stories, I read through a couple and I was already getting chills, until my page refreshed on it's own and I saw a new story titled... "look at the moon".

&#x200B;

Since it was already night time the moon would be out and I thought nothing of it, I started gazing up at the moon only to find out it was a full moon, but not regular, it was so beautiful and so bright, I've never seen it like this before, I mean of course I saw a lot of full moons but never one of such beauty.

&#x200B;

I was home alone so I couldn't get my parents or my sister to look at the moon with me, I kept gazing up on it until I stopped, something in my head was telling me to stop, I don't know what it was but I just had to stop.

&#x200B;

I went back on the page just to see that the story never existed, I tried looking for it, I refreshed it, I searched it up but such a story never existed.

&#x200B;

"Hm, weird" I thought to myself, how is it possible that such a story showed up for me but in reality was never there? But how come I saw it then? "Whatever" I thought to myself and walked to the kitchen and made myself some popcorn.

&#x200B;

While in the kitchen I heard something, like a footstep, it sounded like it was right by me but when I looked there was nothing, it was as if it never happened.

&#x200B;

It was barely 10PM so I didn't think about bed, I sat down on my couch, turned on the movie and started eating popcorn until I suddenly got a text from my Mother.  


"Hey! Did you see the moon already? It's so beautiful right?"

&#x200B;

I thought nothing of it because it was a normal text, then I went on her chat and I read messages that I didn't even get...

&#x200B;

The one that creeped me out the most was: "Hey I won't have any service until tomorrow, so if you need anything call me on mobile!"

&#x200B;

How come she sent me this message without any service? I immediately responded saying "You have service?"

&#x200B;

Not even 5 seconds later I get a response saying "look at the moon".

&#x200B;

"Alright that's it, first that fucking story and now my mom texting me this shit? What the fuck is going on!?" is what I thought to myself, well those were one of the thoughts, there were at least 500 thoughts flowing through my mind and I didn't know what to do anymore.

&#x200B;

I went in the hallway and locked the front door immediately, I locked every window and the backdoor.

&#x200B;

"Okay, I feel safer now..."

&#x200B;

The moment I said that I heard about 50 knocks at my front and backdoor, it felt like my head was gonna explode, I went to my room locked the door and started to cry like a child, the knocks didn't stop they just didn't stop... Then after 5 minutes they did.

&#x200B;

"Holy shit, thank god!"

&#x200B;

I felt safe until something whispered in my ear "look at the moon".

&#x200B;

I jumped up and ran into the corner while thinking to myself what I should do.

&#x200B;

"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??"

&#x200B;

But no answer...

&#x200B;

I grabbed my phone and called the police.  


"Hello?? Police? I need help NOW"  


"Yes hello, please describe the emergency and tell me your address"  


"Ok Ok my address is  █████ ████ ██████ and my emergency is that STRANGE FUCKING THINGS ARE HAPPENING OKAY? PLEASE JUST COME QUICKLY I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN THIS!!!"

&#x200B;

"Okay sir I will need you to calm down, officers are on the way but may I ask you to pass the time, have you looked at the moon yet?"

&#x200B;

I immediately hung up, WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME!?

&#x200B;

It was then something just made me walk out my room, everything was dark, the lights went out I don't know why, but despite that I was still able to see it, this face, smile as wide as a doorway, teeth as yellow as the sun, as sharp as a knife and as ugly as the devil.

&#x200B;

Eyes broken, bloody red with a bit of white and huge pupils, as big as rocks and I didn't know what to do, I kept looking at it and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't take my eyes off it, my ears were peeping, I heard static, my head was full of thoughts: "Am I gonna die now?", "What is this creature", "Why" all those thoughts and more at once, I didn't know what to do, I stood still, the static got worse the longer I kept looking at it, I heard a footstep, it came closer, I saw the eyes move, it was first looking at the ground now it was looking straight at me, I couldn't blink and I couldn't look away, another step, and another, and another, until it was face to face with me, it reeked of blood and death and then I passed out.

&#x200B;

The next day I woke up in a hospital I was speaking to a doctor and I was then assigned to a therapist, I spoke to the therapist and I told him how it was, nobody wanted to believe me, they all kept saying: "We've read the police report."

&#x200B;

"WHAT FUCKING POLICE REPORT" I yelled at the therapist, and then I barged out of his office.

&#x200B;

"Yeah, police report, try to argue against the guy who fucking LIVED IT, but noo don't believe me believe the STUPID FUCKING POLICE WHO DIDN'T WANT TO HELP"

&#x200B;

I was talking to myself while walking home, it was so tiring that nobody believed me, I walked home and nobody was home, I looked at the kitchen counter and saw a note, it looks like it was written in blood?? But the blood was already dried, almost like it was there for a longer period, I read the note which said:  


"Wasn't the moon oh so beautiful?"

&#x200B;

Police report:  


On  ██████, ████, 2018 a man has called 911 claiming he had an emergency, the police dispatcher was talking to him and he got the address, when asked what his name was he immediately hung up, upon that happening the dispatcher immediately sent 2 officers, Officer  ███████ and Deputy Hunningan, to the address, they arrived in about 15 minutes, they knocked at the door but no reaction, they knocked again, no reaction, they called out to the man but it didn't seem like he was reacting so the officers broke in his door and the whole house was dark, not a single sign of light, the officers tried to turn on the light but the power was out, one of the officers went to turn the power back on while the other one was investigating with a flashlight, he saw the man on the floor, mouth foaming and him unconscious, the power went back on and he kept investigating after calling an ambulance, after further investigation there was no sign of a break in or anything, the officers found nothing but Schizophrenia Medication.
