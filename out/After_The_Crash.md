At 50 years old, I never thought I would meet the love of my life, but I did. Although we had what some would call a large age gap, 14 year difference, it didn't matter to me. This man was every thing to me. He was kind, he was funny, he was so very smart, and my goodness was he handsome! We had so much fun together. Even the little things were a good time to us. We found romance in the simplest things. We would go for a walk and hold hands. Some evenings we would sit outside in front of the chimenea watching the fire and sipping drinks. Weekends in the fall we would watch our favorite football team. We had a simple, beautiful life that I wouldn't trade for anything.

On the afternoon of our 5 year anniversary, I was heading to our home after being out getting everything I needed to make him one of his favorite meals. I was going to roast a Cornish Game Hen for us and make all of the sides to go with it.... stuffing, green beans, corn, rolls.. Just a really nice simple meal. I guess I was about 7 miles from home when out of nowhere someone blew through the red light and t-boned my car on the driver's side. I didn't even see them coming. I don't remember anything from the crash, except the initial impact. I guess when they hit me I must have lost consciousness.



It's 3 weeks later. They tell me that's how long I've been in the coma. When I woke up I was so disoriented. I didn't understand that I was in the hospital. I didn't know where I was or why I was there. Then it came to me. The crash. Looking around it quickly came to me that I was in a hospital. I was only awake for a couple of minutes before a nurse came in. She started checking me out. While she was taking vitals and all of that I asked about my boyfriend. I asked if he had been here, and gave her his name. No, she said, no one had visited since I've been here. I asked her how long that was. She delivered the devastating news that it had been 3 weeks. I couldn't understand, surely someone had contacted him. I told her I knew I was in a car crash and that surely someone must have told him because the truck I was driving was in his name. She looked at me perplexed. Then she said something that changed my entire life. “Ma'am, I don't know anything about a crash. You came to use in an ambulance. Your husband had nearly beaten you to death. But don't worry. The cops have him in custody. You are safe.” I told her that couldn't be. I wasn't married. And there was no way the man that I love could possibly hurt me. She suggested we go over a few facts.



She asked my name. I gave it to her. Yes, that's what she had.



She asked my birth date. I gave it to her. Yes. That checked out.



She asked me, what was the last day that I remember. I told her December 6.



That was easy. I knew it was our anniversary.



She asked what year. I told her 2053.



She looked at me and asked me to repeat that. I told her 2053.



No she said. It's 2025.



What?



She said, “It's 2025.”



I insisted. I knew I was right. And time travel isn't real. I was born in 1998. I am 55 years old.



She asked me to wait for a second and then she returned with two items. She brought a news paper and a mirror. First, she showed me the newspaper. I read the date. It read, December 27, 2025. This couldn't be. I couldn't wrap my mind around it. Then, she handed me the mirror.



Even through the bruises, I could see the face from my youth, with tears streaming down my face. I remembered the man that I had been married to when I was in my 20's. He was a mean, cruel man. It took elaborate plans with the help of family and friends for me to escape him. I had never looked back once I was free of him.



My nurse could see how disturbed I was. She saw the anguish. The horror I felt was pouring out of me. She took a seat and asked me to talk. I explained that I had lived a whole life, that I had gotten free of that man and gone on to live a good life. I told her that when I was 50 years old I had met the love of my life and never wanted another day away from him.



She told me she had heard of this. That it had been documented before that person in a coma had believed themselves to have lived a completely alternate life.

Now it's not just my body that has to heal. It's my heart. I loved that man. I remember that love. I remember our closeness and everything we shared. He was the happiest time in my life. A life I hadn't lived. And now I am mourning a man that doesn't exist.
