Some things in life are, well, simply undeniable truths. Like the fact the sun rises each morning and sets each evening. Or that time moves forward and not backwards. I could go on and on.







But in my family of 5 children, our truth was the existence of a playfully devious imaginary boy named Thomas. At the age of 5, each of us would start to tell stories about a new friend we'd made, at which point the child who had previously told these stories would become inconsolable because their friend had disappeared. Imaginary friends were and always will be a normal part of growing up for many kids, so on the surface of it not much would seem awry to an outsider peering in. The lack of surprise or \*any\* emotion besides a steady underlying sense of unease between our parents probably would ring a few alarm bells, though. 







At least looking back it should have. I suppose a lot passes you by when you're a child. 







As the youngest and final child born into the family, Thomas naturally showed up for me last. I don't remember much of my younger years around when he latched onto me to be quite honest, but I never had much of a problem with him. My siblings were old enough at that point to let me know he was mostly harmless, but my parents gave me one rule. 







"\*If Thomas asks you to do anything, let us know. He can be mischievous and we need to make sure you're being safe.\*" 







Their reasoning was that my eldest brother broke his arm falling out of a tree after Thomas asked him to play together up there. I seem to remember something with one of my Sisters, too, but either way, the rest of my siblings were spooked enough by Mom and Dad's rule and how not following it seemed to get them hurt that it became an accepted thing. Don't get me wrong - they and I had plenty of fun with our collective friend and he remains a formative part of our lives even after all these years - but the rule made enough sense in our heads. 







Well, until it didn't. 







Thomas quietly slipping away from the psyche of one child and into the next whenever one of us turned 5 prevented something important from happening. He never actually \*stayed\* with any of us beyond the age of 10.







Until me. 







Years later, I've come to learn through absent-minded conversations my oldest brother had with my parents that they were trying for a sixth child. Another beyond me. Why that next child never came I don't believe I will ever know. 







Anyway, Thomas stuck with me throughout my pre-teen and early teen years even when I - influenced by the rigid maturity expectations thrust onto growing boys and girls - showed contempt at his persistent presence. I didn't \*want\* an imaginary friend anymore, \*I was too old for that\*, and yet he remained in his ever-whimsical state. At this point, he wasn't really something my mind conjured up in the flesh, but he lived within my mind. I only regret convincing myself he wasn't there, because for the years I ignored his existence, he never spoke to me. It was as if something had forbade him from doing so, yet kept him lingering in the back of my mind anyway. 





But as I grew into my later teens and longed for the simplicity of my earlier youth and all its lack of responsibility, I lay on the wide ledge outside my bedroom window on a clear night and began to think of Thomas again. And as if he had never left, he stood before me once again. I was old enough at 17 to know that this was no imaginary friend, but suddenly noticed something that had passed me by at first through childish ignorance and later simple disdain. There was a desperate sort of sadness lingering deep within the boy's eyes. It was like a filter had been lifted and I could at last glimpse beyond the joyous fa√ßade and stare into what had been in front of me for a great deal of my childhood.







And he knew that I'd finally seen it.







Because that same night he spoke to me for the first time in years, and he spoke plainly. 







No trying to bypass Mom and Dad's rule. No riddles. No secret treehouse climbs. Just a trembling finger pointing to a little patch of grass in the backyard and a sickeningly depressing sentence: "\*Please help me get out.\*"  







I spent an hour digging under the moonlight with my body shivering in a state swinging between fear and rage and Thomas stood by my side throughout my horrifying ordeal. I knew by now where this was going, despite my feeble and increasingly despairing attempts at rationalisation. My shovel hit something that felt solid and I dug some more. A small rectangular wooden box began to uncover itself with each outward flick of dirt. 







I don't know why I kept going. I wanted to call the cops. Have them deal with the next part. Perhaps Thomas' presence by my side - his desire for me to do so - made stopping an impossibility. 







Inside the box lay the remains of a child. Cold, bare, empty wood surrounding an existence prematurely snuffed out. I looked up at Thomas and began to weep. I mourned the brother I never had whilst he comforted me all the same. 







My parents never revealed why they did what they did. Not to us, the police or the judge and jury they faced. I don't think I or any of my siblings want an explanation, anyway. It wouldn't do anything to help. We just want Thomas to be where he should be. Here. With us. 







He disappeared from my life and subsequently our lives as a whole that same night. 







I pray he is finally at peace. 







So here's to Thomas. 







The brother I never met, but knew tenderly nonetheless.
