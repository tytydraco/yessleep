It was rumored to be haunted, and I had always wanted to explore it. So one day, I decided to gather up the courage and go inside.

As I approached the house, I noticed that the gate surrounding it was rusted and the windows were boarded up. The once-beautiful mansion now looked like a scene straight out of a horror movie. But I was determined to find out what lay within.

I pushed the gate open and stepped inside. The overgrown lawn was littered with broken bottles and discarded newspapers. The front door was slightly ajar, and as I pushed it open, I was greeted by a musty smell. The inside was dark, and I could hear the sound of something scratching at the walls. I was filled with a sense of unease, but I continued on.

As I made my way through the house, I noticed that everything was covered in a thick layer of dust. The furniture was overturned and there were holes in the walls. But the strangest thing was that there were no cobwebs or signs of any living creatures, like mice or insects. It was as if time had stopped inside the house.

I finally made my way to the staircase, and as I began to ascend, I heard a faint whisper. I paused and listened, but the whisper had stopped. I shrugged it off and continued up the stairs, but as I reached the top, I heard the whisper again, this time, it was louder and more distinct.

I followed the whisper down a long, dark corridor, and as I approached the end of the hallway, I saw a figure standing in front of me. It was a woman dressed in a long, white gown, and her eyes were black and empty. She whispered my name, and I felt a chill run down my spine.

I tried to run, but I was frozen in place. The woman began to float towards me, and as she got closer, I could see that her skin was rotting, and her hair was matted and tangled. I was filled with terror and I screamed, but no sound escaped my lips.

Suddenly, the woman vanished, and I was left alone in the dark hallway. I stumbled back, and as I reached the top of the stairs, I tripped and fell down the stairs, landing in a heap at the bottom. I tried to get up, but I was too scared to move.

I lay there for what felt like hours, until finally, I mustered up the courage to stand. I made my way back to the front door, and as I stepped outside, I felt a rush of relief. But as I walked down the street, I realized that the woman was following me, her ghostly figure appearing and disappearing behind me.

I ran as fast as I could, but no matter how fast I ran, the woman was always right behind me. I eventually made it home, and I locked the door behind me, but I could still feel her presence.

From that day on, I was haunted by the woman in the white gown. Everywhere I went, she was there, following me, whispering my name. I tried to tell people about what had happened, but no one believed me.

And so, I lived the rest of my life in fear, always looking over my shoulder, always hearing that whisper, always feeling the presence of the ghostly woman in the white gown.
