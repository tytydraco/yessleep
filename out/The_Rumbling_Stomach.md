My time as a surgeon has yielded many favourable benefits, good pay, a stomach of steel and of course helping those in need. However one particular patients case still lingers with me, and I’m thinking I might be the *one needing to be operated on..*  


Mr Steve was an adventurer, he’d climbed mountains, dived in bodies of water (which most probably had actual bodies), among other things. However his trip to an area not far from Chernobyl, left him feeling off, as if he wasn’t quite all himself, he had a rumbling stomach, but one that was more aggressive and if he did not feed it, it would cause him immense debilitating pain.  


We had to discover the cause of his torment. My colleagues and I were sure he had picked up some kind of parasite, a tapeworm perhaps, or perhaps the radioactivity was causing these adverse effects. We gave him medicine to kill whatever was inside him. But to no avail, so he came back begging us to make the pain stop, explaining that now he would wake up at night and devour the raw rotting meat in his trash can,We did a scan and there was something inside his stomach, and intestines, whatever it was we had to remove so we headed into surgery.   


As we peeled away the layers of flesh and opened up his stomach, the sight that befell me and my colleagues was disturbing. Attached to the entire stomach wall were creatures, like grapes on a vine,with humanoid faces, red fleshy rounded masses, with gaping mouths and eyes. Making a noise I can only describe as a sort of purring, perhaps a source for the rumbling noises the man had heard. The small bit of stomach we could see was devoid of colour, like all the blood had been removed. One of my colleagues ran to the other room and grabbed a piece of bread, feeding it to one of the creatures, it dissolved it in its mouth, it’s eyes turning bloodshot and mad before falling asleep, like a demonic baby.  


We began to cut away at the masses, the blood that poured out moving as if it contained maggots, but before we could even remove one, they all began to scream, a deafening scream, their eyes widening, their mouths gaping wider than before, And then they spontaneously exploded, like we were defusing a bomb and cut the wrong wire. We got covered in a hot substance, that stung like fire ants, me being the only lucky one to get some in my eye.   


The man unfortunately died during surgery. The creatures were I believe linked to all his major organs via some sort of connective tissue. I’m not even sure the man was even alive at the start, I think he was just their puppet, an incubator, a home for the hungry fetal masses. And after getting that fluid in my eye I sit here now writing this, my stomach rumbling, but *far more than usual.*
