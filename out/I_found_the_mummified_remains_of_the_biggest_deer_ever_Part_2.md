For a moment, it just stared at me. It stared at me with its flat yellow eyes that oughtn’t to have been able to see. And it ever so gently, keeping calm as it worked, pushed its antlers into my thigh. Not to disable me or try to kill me. To torment me.

I screamed in the way a person can only scream once pain makes them insensible. It pulled back and looked at me. Whatever murderous idiocy ruled over the black deer’s brain told it that hurting me slowly would bring it great pleasure.

It brought one of its front hooves above my ankle and let it hover there for a minute. I shook my head (stupid, I know). “No. No, please don’t.” Its hoof was the size of a small dog. I prayed to God even as I begged the idiot-monster not to hurt me any more. “Please don’t.”

It pressed its hoof down on my ankle.

Oh, how I screamed. You wouldn’t believe someone could scream like that. I felt and heard my ankle bone snap and the muscles in my foot and leg pressed like ground beef under a rolling pin. I screamed and I screamed.

The black deer pulled back in a sudden, jerky motion, like it hadn’t meant to. I realized I could hear a growl that didn’t belong to my torturer. I looked up. I saw Tooth. She was hanging onto the black deer’s back, biting it, dug into the top of its neck. The black deer roared.

I dug my keys out of my pocket. I crawled till my back was up against my front door. My hands were so shaky. I managed my key into the lock. I unlocked the door. I crawled inside and pushed the door shut. I saved myself. Tooth was outside, but I saved myself.

I reached up for the deadbolting jamb-to-jamb barricade, fingers stretching because if I got off my ass I got on my obliterated foot. I felt the barricade’s cold steel at my fingers and heard the satisfying, loud *thunk* as it went into place. 

And then I heard a loud, panicked whine from outside. And then I heard a terrible howl. 

Oh God. Tooth. Oh God, oh God…

Then a last, desperate yelp, and then the sound of bones and meat and something crushing them. After that, silence. So eerily quiet—I didn’t know there could be such quiet in the midst of blood and chaos. But God, it was so quiet.

The black deer roared again. A battering ram bashed into my front door. The wood moaned and crackled. As hard as the elephantine revenant was hitting my door, it would break through the barricade before it even thought to try the windows.

My gun. Where was my gun? Shit, I’d left it in my truck. I’d left it in the goddamned truck, back in the crew cab with the snow brush that stayed there even when winter was over.

When winter was over…

I had an idea.

I pulled the area rug aside off of the trap door. I opened the trap door and dropped down into the crawlspace just as I heard the black deer roar again. I hit the crawlspace floor at the same time as the monster hit my front door hard enough that it splintered, and signalled its end.

I knew it was still down here. I almost laughed as I thought of what the game warden had told me: “I think it’s a whole lot of overkill just for clearing snow. Like dropping napalm on a bee hive.”

My ankle throbbed. I thought my left hand was no good no matter what happened from there on out. It was hard getting the tank strapped to my back with just one hand. I had to roll around on the ground to position it just right. 

I got it on.

I crawled toward the access door that let out on the side of my house. Above me, I heard the door and the barricade break. It sounded like an ogre snapping a tree and a steel beam at the same time. 

I waited. I listened. I prayed. I don’t know if I said it out loud, but I prayed: “Please God, help that piece of shit learn to turn its antlers sideways.” 

And then I heard it. I heard its monumental hooves clomping on my wood floor. I almost started laughing. I had to cover my mouth. Tears welled in my eyes. I thought I’d lose my shit. The thought of that stupid satanic Bambi looking around the cabin, no idea where I’d gone to. It was either the funniest thing in the world or there was a fracture run through the fundament of my psyche.

I pushed out the access door. I crawled far enough away from the house so I wouldn’t burn. I saw Tooth. Her dead body was close to the house. She’d be taken up in the fire. I told myself I could cry later. I could cry when the deed was done. Yeah, I could cry when it was done. “I’m sorry, Tooth,” I managed to say. I bit my mouth shut before I’d lose my grip.

I crawled far enough away while the black deer searched my cabin for me. I one-handedly set the front grip on my knee. I wrapped my good hand around the valve grip. And then I let her rip.

My flamethrower vomited fire all over the house.

And then, my body spent and my mind unwilling to sit in the carriage of consciousness a moment longer, I passed out. I faded from consciousness to the score of that bloodthirsty idiot beast roaring as it burned to death. 

I don’t remember them, but I like to think that once I’d dropped off, I had very sweet dreams.

I woke up in the closest community hospital, almost a hundred miles away. The game warden was there. He told me that someone called in the fire when they saw it from the air. I asked him if it was a crop-duster or what. He said he didn’t know.

“Your house is worth shit now,” he said with the natural indelicacy of a man who regulates beer-swilling gun enthusiasts. “Truck’s okay, though. Hope you don’t mind, I looked around the cab and found clothes, whatever else I could find. Lucky you keep your license in the console. Probably saved yourself at least a little bit of trouble. Put it in your gym bag.” He nodded toward the hospital wardrobe. “It’s over in there.”

I nodded, unsure of what to say. I finally managed to say, “Thanks.”

“Sure thing.” He reached out and, as awkwardly as a boss consoling a little-known employee with a hug for their personal tragedy, patted the knee of my good leg. “You’re one of us.”

I laughed. I don’t know why, but I laughed. The game warden started laughing, too. I laughed and laughed and he laughed and laughed. Pretty soon a nurse put her head in my room to say, hey, didn’t we know there are people trying to rest in here?

“Sorry, sorry,” I said, waving her off, “we’ll keep it down.”

“Well, hell, you should be able to laugh,” the game warden said when the nurse went away. “Shit, if you can’t laugh after something like that, I don’t know…”

We sat there in laughter’s silent afterglow. I think about it now—that’s one of the great things our species can do; we can still laugh after it’s all over.

After a little bit longer, I asked the game warden, “You find a wolf’s body by the cabin?”

“Yes, I did.” He leaned forward in his seat and whispered. “I cleaned that up for you. Keep you out of trouble, you know.”

“What about the monster?”

The game warden screwed up his face in confusion. “What do you mean?”

“The black deer. The gigantic goddamn black deer. That fucking thing. I hope it burned up good. Goddamnit, I hope it hurt like shit when it did, too.”

“Alright, alright, take it easy now. Don’t get mad at me. I’ve got no idea what you’re talking about. What deer?”

“There was a huge black deer. The biggest deer ever, I’d think. It got trapped in my house. I burnt it up. I burned that goddamn idiot monster to death.” Disorientation and a morphine drip dragged me further down into my hospital bed.

I could see in the game warden’s eyes that he thought he was looking at a crazy woman. Maybe he was. I could tell, though, that they hadn’t found that black devil in the fire. Not that the game warden knew of, at any rate.

“I’m sure—hey, listen, I’ll talk to whoever they got investigating the fire. See if they found anything.”

“Yeah. Yeah,” I said, “sure thing.”

“I do got one question for you, though.”

My eyes were fluttering and the morphine felt like a heavy blanket. I slurred my words when I said, “What’s your question?”

The game warden stood up. He walked over to the hospital wardrobe. He reached down and picked up my gym bag. He came back over and sat in his seat next to my hospital bed. He unzipped the bag. 

And then, at least I knew that maybe I wasn’t crazy, because he lifted the dark green eggstone and said, “What the hell was this that you had in your [truck](https://www.reddit.com/user/DickinsonPublishing/)?”
