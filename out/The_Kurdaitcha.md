This is a pretty short story, and a simple enough tale at that. But it's something that's stuck with me for 30 years now.

The year was 1994. I was in 7th grade at the time, along with my cousins Carlos, Shanelle and Shailah. We went to school on Palm Island, but on the holidays we’d visit my Uncle, Aunt and my cousins out near Davenport in the Northern Territory.

It was on one of these visits that my story takes place. It was a normal day like pretty much any other. Me and my cousins, we’d spend our days out in the bush playing barambah gimbe and chuboo chuboo. During one of our games my cousin Carlos remarked about a set of prints in the dirt out by the tree line. We investigated and they were a bit odd, but I thought they must just be an emu or maybe an ostrich. We do get em out here occasionally, wandering off from the farms. After a tiring day of playing out on the plains my Uncle called us in for tucker. We had damper and a nice hot stew.

After dinner we just played a bit longer outside. We had big spotlights outside our place so it’s safe for us to play at night until bedtime. My Uncles just tell us don’t wander too far and we’re all good. So we played another few rounds before we end up getting tired and make our way inside for bedtime.

The way our house out there’s set up is we got the living area and the kitchen on the ground floor and also a bathroom and toilet down there. Upstairs there's Aunty and Uncle’s room off to the right and my other Uncle’s room on the left. Down the hall is a really big bedroom with bunk beds for all us kids. Back then, we had a telly set up in there with super nintendo so, we never really got much sleep after we went to bed.

We were up late that night playing games when we hear the dogs start barking really loud out the front of the house, around where we were playing earlier. And something else... something howling back at the dogs from out bush, maybe a dingo or something. We do get dingos out there so I quickly run downstairs to grab the dogs and bring em inside. I went out and grab them and, true God, I’ve never seen em' so scared like they were that night. I grab their leads and bring em' upstairs with us kids. They were all acting real strange, nuzzling in real close with us, sitting in front of us like they were shielding us from someone.

That was when I heard my Uncles talking from one of the bedrooms. They were real hush about it, but we could hear em' from our room. Then the door handle to us kids room starts turning, and the door slowly opened. It was my Uncle and Aunty. As soon as they saw me they grabbed me by the arm and pulled me up and hugged me. They told me they saw me go outside and not to do that again at night without asking. They then gestured for us all to follow them into the bedroom up the hall. My Aunty and Uncle’s bedroom it's got a big window that faces out the front yard. My other Uncle was standing there with them and everyone was just staring out there into the dark. I was real scared by this point and didn’t know what was going on so I ask my other Uncle and he just whispered to me... “Uncle think Kurdaitcha out there”.

I shivered when I heard him say that. A Kurdaitcha is like a witch doctor, kinda like a Skinwalker, to use a term you might be more familiar with. He’s known as the “executioner man” in our native language. That’s when I remember those tracks we seen earlier that looked kinda like emu. The old stories we were always told, would tell all about the Kurdaitcha and how he wears big emu feathers on his feet, stuck on there with dried blood. We can’t really see anything out there in the dark, so my Uncle tells one of the kids to run downstairs and turn on the floodlights. My cousin runs down there, and a minute later the floodlights come on.

Right there, in the middle of the front yard... was a huge looking dingo. That’s not what scared me that time though. What scared me was the fact this dingo was standing up on his back legs, the legs all straightened out, and thick like a person's. On his feet, big thick feathers. He just stares right at that window. It took us a few seconds of shock but my Uncle quickly shuts the curtains and tells us to get down on the ground. The Kurdaitcha had a bone in his hand, and my Uncle said no doubt, if we stayed there a minute longer, he woulda start pointin' the bone at us.

Point the bone is an ancient ritual in our culture. It is evil magic and it is forbidden. It’s carried out with a long, sharp bone. When it’s pointed at your enemies, they die. Might take a week, might take a year, but they always die.

What scares me most about what happened that night isn’t seeing the thing standing there in the yard, and it wasn’t the bone in his hand... although I’m thankful for my Uncle’s quick thinking. Nah, what scares me most is thinking back to when we were playing in the yard, and walking right over to that dark tree line looking at those fresh tracks. He coulda been right there the whole time. And later that night, when I run out to grab the dogs, for sure he was right there near me, looking right at me... I was totally exposed and vulnerable, and I didn’t even know it.

The land out here can be a scary place. There’s unseen things in the outback that we don’t understand, and could never understand. But they see us clear as day... And some of em' haven’t learned to tell the difference between friend and [foe.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Creepy__Oz/comments/1hc8ay2/my_stories_master_list/)
