(I just threw this together in half an hour but hey let‚Äôs see how far I can go with it, and I hope you enjoy reading my story and will stay tuned for the updates )

Late into the night George was tossing and turning in bed struggling to get to sleep, all that was on his mind was that there was something he hasn‚Äôt done or needed to do, he unwillingly got up out of bed and walked into the bathroom, he turned on the tap and splashed his face with water, 

he then walked downstairs into his kitchen and proceeded to pour himself a glass of whiskey to try and send him to sleep that way, after he finished his first glass he pours another and half way through drinking it he hears three loud spaces out knocks on his front door, the sound made him jump causing him to drop his glass shattering it on the wooden floor,

 angrily he walked to the door ready to start an argument but to his surprise his porch was empty. Looking around in confusion George saw nothing but his desolate suburban street, George walks back inside thinking it was some neighbourhood kids playing a prank on him and started cleaning up the broken glass, 

whilst he was moping up the whiskey he heard the same three knocks on his front door again, George got up and begrudgingly opened the door, and as before no one was there, being stressed and over tired George looks down to the floor and notices something beneath his feet, he reaches down and picks up a envelope, as he holds it he feels something wet on his fingers and when he looks at his hand, his fingers are covered in blood, 

in terror George turns the envelope around and written in blood says ‚Äúhelp me‚Äù seeing this George freaks out, dropping the letter and slamming his door shut, he stands there on the opposite side of the door until his silence is broke by the same three knocks. George waits a while before opening the door and when he manages to swing it open‚Ä¶ nothing. 

He decides to pick up the letter and take it inside, he takes it in his kitchen and being scared but also a bit curios he opens the letter and it says 

‚Äúhello, I know you don‚Äôt know me but I know you George, I am in danger and I need your help, there are ten other letters you need to find and in those letters are clues to help you piece together my location, and rescue me, I know you may be confused George but when they said to choose someone, the only person I can trust is you, I can‚Äôt say much more but you will understand more throughout each letter‚Ä¶ the first clue is (something you regret) please help me George. My life falls in your hands‚Ä¶‚Äù

Let me know if you would like part 2 cause I know I‚Äôm gonna enjoy writing it üòÅ
