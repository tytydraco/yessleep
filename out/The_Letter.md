Vroom, vroom! I was accelerating to nearly a hundred miles per hour. I had just picked up my new BMW M8. I couldn't contain my excitement. The thing was so fast.

"Woohoo!" I exclaimed.

"Take a right turn onto 495," my GPS said with its boring computerized voice. I knew the rest of the way home, so I exited Apple Maps and continued going at my speed. I arrived home to my son Yusuf, playing soccer in the backyard with his friends. I waved to him, he waved back and then I went inside. The first thing I smelled was food. I hadn't realized how hungry I was until just now. It was my wife cooking chicken curry.

"It smells really good!" I exclaimed to my wife.

"I'm glad"

"Dinner will be ready in ten," my wife replied. So, I called out to Yusuf from the kitchen window.

"Your mom says dinner will be ready in ten minutes."

"Okay," he replied.

I walked upstairs. to change, but then, I stopped myself realizing that I had forgotten to grab the mail. I ran back downstairs and outside towards the mailbox.

"Ahh more bills," I sighed. However, one of the envelopes stood out from the others. It didn't look like a bill. I think it was a letter.

"Who still sends letters?" I thought to myself considering all the technology around us. Couldn't this person send an email? I walked inside towards my bedroom, intrigued by the possible letter. I opened it first.

*Hey there. Do you want a happier life? I can make things happen. Things you never knew were possible. I can remove things that you hate most in your life. Just call this number: \[Blah blah blah\]*

This is probably some kind of joke. I was about to rip it up, but I wanted to see what would happen if I called the number.

"Dinner is ready honey," my wife called to me. I set the letter down and went downstairs. Yusuf was playing on his computer, mind you he is fourteen years old. My wife was setting the table by herself.

"Yusuf help your mom set the table," I said to him.

"Okay dad," he replied. Yusuf had an obedient demeanor. He would never talk back and always did what we told him to. Now, we were all sitting at the dinner table.

"I'm famished" I said. Yusuf was already gobbling his food down.

"You must be hungry," I said to Yusuf.

"Yeah."

"The school lunch wasn't really good."

"Some kid's food had mold in it so I decided not to eat," Yusuf replied.

"Smart choice," I said to him and then I begin to eat. The moment that the chicken touched my taste buds was the moment it became my favorite food. Everyone agreed that it tasted really good. When I finished, I hugged my wife.

"This chicken curry is just what I needed," I told her.

"Thank you," she replied. I went upstairs to change this time for real when I remembered the letter. I picked it up from my dresser.

"Maybe I should call it," I thought to myself.

"What could go wrong?" I dialed the number on my phone. Whoever this was answered immediately.

"Hi," the person said with an eerie voice.

"Um."

"Hi," I replied.

"I received a letter that instructed me to call this number," I explained to him.

"Perfect," he said again with an eerie voice.

"What do you want removed?"

"I'm sorry?" I replied.

"I said what do you want removed?"

"I don't understand sir," I said.

"If you read the letter then you'd know what I mean." I glanced at the letter. I reread this phrase.

*I can remove things that you hate most in your life.*

"If you can really remove things," I said.

"Then remove my alarm clock to prove it."

"Your wish is my command," he said and hung up the phone. When I glanced at my nightstand, the alarm clock was gone. I couldn't believe my eyes. I rubbed the several times astonished at what I just saw. My wife then came upstairs.

"Why do you look so shocked?" she asked.

"And where is your alarm clock?"

"I can't really explain it." I replied.

"I'll just show you." I called the number again. He immediately picked up the phone.

"Hello again," he said in the same eerie voice.

"Hi," I said.

"I want you to make my dollar bill disappear."

"Your wish is my command," he said and hung up once again. My wife and I looked at each other, and then the dollar bill, or at least where the dollar bill had been. It also disappeared. My wife was left speechless.

"H- How?" she uttered.

"I am just as shocked as you are," I said to her. I figured I look more into this tomorrow. I glanced at the time on my phone. It was 8:45 PM.

"Yusuf it is past your bedtime," I called out to him.

"Coming dad," he replied. I changed into my pajamas and tucked myself in. The next day at around 7:00 AM, I woke up and remembered last night. I was about to dial the number again until I glanced at my nightstand. The alarm clock and dollar bill were back in its place, but there was no sign of the letter. I looked at my bed, my wife wasn't there anymore. I went to Yusuf's room, he wasn't there anymore. I scurried downstairs and looked everywhere. They were nowhere to be found. I looked out the garage window, my BMW was gone. Finally, I looked out the living room window and there was a man standing in my front yard looking straight at me. He slowly picked up his cellphone and called me. I slowly picked up the phone.

"He- hello?" I spoke.

"You had your chance," he said in his eerie voice and then hung up. He morphed into a shadow that came straight towards me. He held out his hand with 10 sharp claws pointing at me on the other side of the window. I watched in horror as he somehow shot them out of his hand, through the glass like a bullet and straight into my neck. Everything went black all of a sudden. I woke up in a confined space. It is pitch black. My only source of light is my phone which I am lucky to have right now. I've tried calling for help but the location is impossible to trace. I am currently typing this from my phone, and I hear creeping footsteps every minute or so getting closer and closer. I doubt that I will make it out alive but wish me luck.
