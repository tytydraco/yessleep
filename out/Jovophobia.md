Phase One: The Brightening (Month 1)

No one remembers the exact day it began. Jupiter, long a fixture of telescopes and textbooks, brightened. At first, it was just beautiful. A dot with presence. A miracle in motion.

It was visible at twilight. Then just after sunset. Then during daylight. You could see the stripes—clearly—with the naked eye.

The moon dimmed in cultural relevance. The first headlines called it the "New Light." But by then it was already too late to look away.

Phase Two: The Shift (Months 2–3)

The tides began to linger.

Oceanographers called it "resonant displacement." The waves came in and didn’t fully leave. Coastal cities logged it as a nuisance:

Extended high tide

Slow beach collapse

Migratory confusion


And then there were the winds.

Meteorologists reported new upper-atmosphere drag fields. Jet streams warped. Storms moved like they were being watched.

Then came the birds. They flew in loops. They circled until they dropped.

Phase Three: The Pull (Months 4–6)

Everyone felt it before they named it. The subtle shift in gravity. The strange lightness in the spine. People reported:

Pressure headaches that pulsed in sync with the sky

Fluid pooling in the legs

Objects drifting slightly east when left undisturbed


Mirrors became unreliable. Not in their reflections—but in their delays. You moved, and the image followed a fraction too slow. People stopped looking.

By this point, Jupiter took up a quarter of the sky. It didn’t loom. It hovered. Color bled from its bands into the clouds on Earth. There was no longer night, just a rust-colored hush.

Phase Four: The Unbinding (Month 7+)

The crust began to crack in isolated regions.

At first it was coastal—pressure faults, geysers in the wrong places. Then midland zones began to slip. Buildings leaned. Streets bowed. People reported feeling taller.

Not metaphorically. Physically. They looked down and realized their arms were longer than they were the week before. Rings had to be cut off. Clothes stopped fitting upward.

Doctors called it fluid redistribution and skeletal stress. But scans showed something else. Bone lengthening. Disc expansion.

The planet was being stretched. And so were we.

Phase Five: Tidal Silence

The oceans left.

They did not crash or rise. They ascended.

The seas began to arc upward, curving into the sky like glass being poured too slowly. Marine life hung in vertical corridors, twitching gently as pressure failed them.

Cities fell quiet. People didn’t run. They slowed.

All movement began to take on the same rhythm: Slow... long... upward.

Phase Six: Atmospheric Distortion (Month 8)

The air began to separate.

It wasn’t visible at first. Reports described a mild disorientation, headaches, and shallow breathing at certain elevations. People on upper floors of high-rises experienced brief episodes of nausea and spatial confusion.

Barometric readings showed inconsistencies above 150 meters. Weather balloons stopped returning. Broadcast towers began failing. There was a soft hiss, like static, in the background of most audio recordings.

Sound changed. It moved slower. Echoes stretched longer than they should have. In open fields, voices faded before they reached the edge.

Phase Seven: Biological Drift (Months 9–10)

Animal migration ceased entirely.

Pets began behaving unpredictably—agitation, disinterest, hiding under furniture for hours. In some cases, they faced corners and did not respond to sound. Livestock refused to graze.

Human symptoms increased. Vertigo became common. A fixed upward gaze was often reported, especially upon waking. Those affected would stare at nothing until physically touched or spoken to.

Reflections no longer lagged. Now they sometimes blinked first.

Phase Eight: Environmental Suspension (Month 11–12)

Rain no longer fell. It accumulated in the sky—thin, clear sheets suspended in uneven layers, refracting light across fields and rooftops.

When birds or drones passed through, the water distorted, then slowly reformed. In remote areas, mist hovered indefinitely without descending.

Leaves extended at the tips. Trees leaned. Their growth followed an upward pull not aligned with the sun.

Objects left unattended were found meters away from where they were placed. One construction site reported a steel beam lifted fifteen centimeters over two hours, without sound.

Movement restrictions were advised in elevated areas. Schools began moving classrooms underground. Most people stayed indoors.

Phase Nine: Structural Deviation (Month 13)

Infrastructure began to warp.

It started with bridges—measurable elevation gain at suspension midpoints. Then buildings. Support beams in older structures bowed. Elevators stopped working reliably. Some ascended without prompting and failed to stop at designated floors. A few reached the top and remained there.

Engineers identified microfractures forming in concrete. Not stress fractures from weight or use—longitudinal stress from within. Steel reinforcement bent in uniform directions. Floors developed a measurable tilt.

Basements flooded. Not from rainfall. From pressure displacement. Groundwater was pushing upward.

Phase Ten: Detachment Onset (Month 14)

The first detachment occurred in the South Atlantic.

A fishing vessel recorded it on camera. A cargo ship, idling at anchor, began to tilt upward slowly, stern first. The crew reported no noise. No waves. The ship lifted cleanly into the air by several meters before folding at its midsection and breaking apart.

Within hours, satellite feeds showed other vessels rising in similar patterns—slow, vertical lifts followed by structural failure. Ships vanished into low-lying cloud formations and did not return.

No response signals were received. Black boxes failed to ping.

By the end of the week, maritime authorities ceased tracking non-military craft.

Phase Eleven: Final Load (Month 15)

Global coordination ceased. International bodies no longer issued unified guidelines. Advisory updates shifted to regional languages and focused on relocation procedures. “Upward deviation zones” were color-coded by severity.

Air travel remained suspended. Ground travel became restricted as structural shifts fractured roadways. Rail systems were discontinued. Tunnels collapsed. Cities implemented vertical stability protocols.

Satellite communications degraded. Signals were often delayed or refracted. Atmospheric density fluctuations disrupted long-range imaging. Ground-based observations continued for another three weeks before becoming unusable.

Jupiter’s upper atmosphere was now visible in sharp relief from nearly every location on Earth.

People stayed home. Windows were covered. Movement was minimized.

Phase Twelve: Failure Initiation (Month 16)

The first recorded full structure detachment occurred in the Andes.

A monastery, located at high elevation, was captured on drone footage lifting from the ridge on which it was built. No sound was recorded. The structure did not collapse. It rose intact, dislodging from its foundation over a span of four minutes. It gained altitude steadily, tilting once at the apex, then drifting into the upper air column and out of sight.

Within 48 hours, similar incidents occurred worldwide. Light towers. Outposts. Lighthouses. In some cases, entire sections of elevated roadway.

Some of the structures remained visible for several hours before atmospheric distortion obscured them. A few were seen breaking apart in slow arcs. There was no descent.

Emergency response units ceased deployment in upward deviation zones.

Phase Thirteen: Release (Month 17)

Detachment entered population centers.

The first civilian departures were recorded in La Paz and later confirmed in Kathmandu and regions of northern Alberta. Individuals were observed rising from streets, rooftops, and open fields. As with the structures, there was no noise. No acceleration. The lifts were slow, continuous, and irreversible.

Those who rose did not fall.

Reports described individuals ascending in upright positions, arms slack at their sides, eyes closed or half-lidded. Clothing distorted at pressure edges. Skin tension increased visibly in the upper limbs and neck. Attempts to intercept with harnesses or weighted anchors failed. The bodies rose through cloud cover and were lost to view.

Urban populations moved underground.

Reflection latency in mirrors ceased altogether. Glass surfaces no longer showed movement. Some reflected no one. Others continued to show occupants after they had left the room.

Light no longer fully reached the surface. Jupiter had expanded to occupy the majority of the visible sky, absorbing and refracting incoming solar radiation. Crops failed. Temperatures destabilized. The global food supply ceased formal tracking. There was no panic. There was no signal.

Coastal cities became unrecognizable. The oceans, still suspended in arcs, now stood at oblique angles, casting low shadows and generating deep, ambient pressure reverberations. The sound was constant.

On the seventeenth month, the last human broadcast was issued from a protected installation in southern Greenland. It was not a distress call. The transmission consisted of environmental data, gravitational variance graphs, and a closing log statement:

"The sky is so, so hungry.”
