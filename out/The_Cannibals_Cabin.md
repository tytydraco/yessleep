There's this old cabin back in the woods near the park in my town, maybe a mile or so in. It's not easy to find; you gotta know where to look for the patchy dirt path that leads right to it. Honestly, the cabin itself isn't anything to look at, just some beat-up place from the early 1900s. It was the legend about the place that made it important.

The cabin belonged to a lumberjack. Everyone thought he was sort of strange because he kept to himself. He never came to town, and if he did, he didn't talk to anyone. Most people just ignored him. Then, people started disappearing—a salesman here, a farmhand there. At first, no one put it together, sometimes people just moved on. It continued like this until one day, someone found bones close to his cabin, human ones. The town put two and two together, tied him up, sewed his mouth shut, and locked him in the attic to starve and rot away slowly. Some say that his angry, hungry spirit is still up there.

As a kid, it used to scare the shit out of me but growing up I knew that it was just a story made up by the parents and school teachers to discourage kids from wandering off into the woods alone and getting hurt. But my friend, Maryam, always believed it. She loved anything that was spooky. She was always trying to get me to watch some new scary movie or play Bloody Mary at 3 AM during sleepovers. I think it was freshman year I realized how much I liked her, and by junior year I was desperate to impress her. So, I was over the moon when she jumped up and down in excitement when I suggested we take an Ouija board to the cabin. 

My older brother, Nick? He wanted zero part of it. “Oh, come on!” I said. “It’s just an old house.” “Yeah, an old house full of mold and rabid rats,” he shot back. I finally got him to agree when I told him I’d tell Mom about the party he threw when she was out of town last month. He shut up real quick. 

So, there we were, standing outside the run-down cabin. It looked much worse up close. The windows were shattered, the roof was droopy on one side, and vines grew on the wood like veins on decaying skin. Nick hesitated on the porch when he stepped on a wood board that creaked loudly. Maryam just walked right in like she didn’t care.

The inside was worse. The air was musty and damp; everything was shredded to pieces - the wallpaper was peeling, old furniture was scattered broken across the floor, graffiti painted all over, bottles and cans were littered around, and cigarette butts were scattered everywhere. There was only a little bit of light from our phone and the broken windows. The place just felt… heavy. I must've been zoning out, because Maryam nudged me. “You okay, Vivian? We can just leave if you want. I'm sure your brother would be happy too.” I laughed and shook my head.

“Yeah right !,You’re probably just trying to find a way out because you're secretly  scared”, before walking into what used to be a living room. We set the Ouija board on the floor after clearing away all the leaves and dirt. Maryam lit a few candles she brought. We sat around the board, me on the left of it, Maryam on the right, and Nick at the bottom of it. In the end nothing interesting happened. The planchette didn't really move more than a few inches, which Nick accused me and Maryam of moving it ourselves; we both denied it, of course. I just chalk it up to one of us moving it subconsciously or something. Eventually, after a while, we all just got bored with it and did the proper thing and said goodbye. 

“This was a waste of time. I rolled my eyes. “Whatever, Nick, don't act like you didn't have fun, " he scoffed. I put the board away and tried to catch up with him. We could have done something better. Like, I don't know? study for that math test you two have on Monday? I elbowed his side as we walked down the path, crunching on the fallen leaves. “I don't wanna hear about math on a Saturday, Nick. You're weird,” he pushed me back, and I stumbled. “I'm weird? I'm not the one who wanted to go to a scary ass cabin.” I rolled my eyes again. “Okay, we’ll let you pick what we do next. Right, Maryam?”

No one said anything. All I could hear was mine and Nick's footsteps. crunching on the leaves. “Maryam?” I turned, but she wasn't there. It was just an empty, dark path. My heart dropped. How did I not notice she wasn't behind us?

Then, from the cabin, a scream. Nick tried to make me stop, but I ran back. I didn’t know we had walked so far but I got back there and felt out of breath. “Maryam? Where are you? Are you okay?” It just felt wrong, walking back into the house. Then I heard a noise upstairs, and ran up there. “Maryam? Are you up here?” I saw her at the bottom of the stairs that led to the attic. She was shaking. “Maryam! Oh my god, are you ok? Why did you scream? Are you…”

I froze when I saw her face. Maryam always had beautiful, light blue eyes that you could just get lost in, but now her eyes were pitch black, I couldn't breathe. Before I could move, she lunged at me. I tried to block her with my arms, but she bit my left arm. I screamed as she bit down harder. When I tried to pry her off, she just bit down harder. “MARYAM, STOP! GET OFF, YOU'RE HURTING ME!” I was crying when I heard a loud crack sound. Then, I felt blood running down my arm and off Maryam's chin. I must have screamed loud enough for Nick to hear.

Because as I wrestled with Maryam, trying to get her off of me. Nick came running up the stairs like a mad man. “WHAT THE FUCK?!” Nick sounded really scared. He tried to pull Maryam off, but she just growled at him. So he started hitting her with everything he had. “GET OFF OF HER NOW!” Finally, he grabbed her waist and tossed her across the room. I’ll never forget the sound of skin, and fabric tearing. But what I remember more is seeing my friend hunched over, eating that piece of skin like a starved animal.

I held my arm, trying to stop the bleeding. Nick grabbed my other arm and pulled me towards the stairs. We ran outside as the chewing sound got fainter. I couldn't see through the tears as we ran back to the park.

Nick called for an ambulance, and I just stared down the path, trying to breathe and understand. I don't remember much after that, just the lights of the ambulance getting closer. In the hospital, people kept asking me things, but I was so tired that everything started to muddle together. The next morning, I was finally able to ask Nick what happened.

He said mom was pisssed. My arm was broken where Maryam bit me, and I was missing a big chunk of skin. He told the cops and doctors everything. The cabin, the  Oujia board, Maryam. They didn't believe him and accused him of being on drugs, they still went to the cabin to investigate. They saw the blood, but found nothing else. Maryam was long gone. They said we were probably all high and got attacked by a wild animal and got confused about what had really happened. 

It’s been months. They closed off the cabin and the path. My skin grafts are healing, and Maryam is ‘missing and presumed dead,’ but I don't think she is. I think she's still out there…somewhere.
