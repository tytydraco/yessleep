I have always loved this house. From the moment I first saw it, sitting there at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, I knew it was my dream home. It had everything—a wraparound porch with a swing, a sprawling lawn with a giant oak tree in the back, and just enough space to feel cozy but not cramped. Pale blue siding, white trim, and flowers that Laura had planted along the walkway. It was perfect.

It was the kind of place where we were supposed to build our lives together.

We moved in when Sarah was born, and it felt like the start of everything. Me, Laura, Sarah, and then Michael came along a few years later. Our family grew, and so did our happiness. Every corner of this house was filled with memories—Sarah’s first steps in the living room, Michael’s messy paintings on the fridge, Laura laughing in the kitchen as she burned another batch of cookies.

It felt like a picture-perfect life. I told myself every day how lucky I was. A beautiful wife, two kids, a nice job—everything a man could want.

But lately… something’s been off.

It’s hard to put into words, really. Small things at first. Laura seemed distant, like she wasn’t really there. I’d try to talk to her about her day, but she’d shrug, barely looking up from her phone. The warmth that used to be in her voice, her laugh, it was gone. She still did all the usual things—made dinner, drove the kids to school—but something had shifted.

I told myself it was stress. We’d been married for years, and people change. Maybe she was tired. Maybe I was reading too much into it. But the feeling kept creeping in, like a splinter under the skin.

Sarah, my sweet little girl, was turning thirteen. She used to be so bubbly, always telling me about her day, excited about school. Now, when I asked how things were going, she just shrugged or mumbled something under her breath, then stormed off to her room. She started locking herself away for hours, barely coming out for dinner. The way she looked at me… there was something new in her eyes. Something cold.

Michael, too. He was always a quiet kid, but he seemed to be retreating into himself more and more. He’d sit at the breakfast table, staring at his cereal, not even looking up when I spoke. I’d ask him if he wanted to toss a ball around after school, and he’d just shake his head, muttering a vague excuse before disappearing into his room.

The mornings started feeling wrong. We’d all be sitting around the table, but there was no conversation, no life. Just silence. Laura would sip her coffee, staring out the window, lost in thought. Sarah would scroll through her phone, occasionally rolling her eyes at something, but never looking at me. Michael… well, he was just there, silent, like a shadow.

I’d sit there, sipping my own coffee, staring at the three of them, and I’d feel this growing distance. Like there was an invisible barrier between us, something I couldn’t quite name but could feel.

It wasn’t always like this, was it?

Then came the night when I came home late. I had been stuck at work, tied up in some project, and by the time I pulled into the driveway, it was already dark. The house was eerily silent when I stepped through the door.

“Laura?” I called out, my voice echoing through the hallway.

No answer.

I flicked on the lights, moving from room to room. The living room was empty. The kitchen—empty. I started up the stairs, my stomach knotting with unease.

“Sarah? Michael?”

Nothing.

I pushed open Sarah’s bedroom door. Her bed was made, her room neat and tidy, but there was no sign of her. Michael’s room was the same—everything in place, but no Michael.

I made my way to the master bedroom, expecting to find Laura asleep, but when I stepped inside, the bed was untouched. It looked like it hadn’t been slept in at all.

A strange feeling washed over me—something cold, heavy. I stood there in the silence, staring at the empty bed, my heart racing.

Where the hell was everyone?

I went back downstairs, pacing the living room, staring at the family photos on the walls. Pictures of us at the beach last summer, Laura holding Sarah when she was a baby, me smiling beside them. But as I looked closer, something seemed off about the photos.

In one of them, Laura’s face seemed blurred, her features smudged. Sarah and Michael’s faces were there, but something about them was… wrong. Their expressions seemed different, like they weren’t smiling anymore. I blinked and looked again, and the photo was normal, everything in its place. But the unease remained.

I tried to shake it off, tried to convince myself that I was overreacting. Families go through rough patches, right? Maybe I was just imagining things.

But then, the next morning, it got worse.

I woke up to the smell of burnt toast and walked downstairs to find Laura at the stove, but she didn’t greet me. She didn’t even turn around when I entered the kitchen.

“Morning,” I said, trying to sound casual.

She didn’t respond.

I sat down at the table, watching as she stood there, motionless, staring at the pan like she didn’t know what to do with it.

“Are you okay?” I asked, my voice quieter now.

Still, she didn’t answer.

The kids came downstairs eventually, Sarah storming past me with barely a glance, Michael trailing behind her like a ghost. They sat at the table in silence, both of them picking at their food, not looking at me, not looking at each other.

I could feel the distance between us growing, like a chasm opening up in the middle of the kitchen, pulling us apart. The house felt colder, emptier, as if the life had drained out of it.

I tried to talk to Laura about it that evening, after the kids had gone to bed.

“Something’s wrong, Laura,” I said, standing in the doorway of our bedroom, watching her as she sat on the bed, her back to me. “We’re not… I don’t know, we’re not us anymore. You don’t talk to me, the kids barely acknowledge me—what’s happening?”

She didn’t respond at first. She just sat there, her shoulders tense, her hands clenched in her lap.

Finally, she turned to face me, and when she did, her eyes were cold—colder than I’d ever seen them.

“You’re imagining things,” she said, her voice flat. “You’re always imagining things.”

Her words cut deeper than I expected. I opened my mouth to argue, to tell her that I wasn’t imagining anything, but something about the way she looked at me stopped me cold. There was a darkness in her eyes, something I couldn’t quite place, something I’d never seen before.

I slept on the couch that night.

After that, everything started to unravel.

The house no longer felt like a home. The walls seemed to be closing in on me, the air heavy with something I couldn’t name. The pictures on the walls looked different every time I walked past them—sometimes the faces were clear, sometimes they were distorted, unrecognizable.

I started hearing things, too. Late at night, when I was lying in bed, I’d hear whispers coming from the walls, soft, unintelligible, like someone was talking just out of reach. But whenever I strained to listen, the voices would stop.

The kids became more distant by the day. Sarah would lock herself in her room for hours, and when I tried to talk to her, she’d scream at me to leave her alone. Michael… he barely even existed anymore. He’d sit in the corner of the living room, staring at nothing, his face pale and blank.

And Laura… Laura was gone, even though she was still there. She moved through the house like a ghost, her eyes hollow, her words sharp and cutting whenever she bothered to speak at all. I’d catch her watching me sometimes, her gaze cold and full of something I couldn’t understand—resentment, maybe. Hatred.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I needed answers.

Then came that night.

I woke up to the sound of screaming—high-pitched, frantic, coming from Sarah’s room. I bolted upright in bed, my heart pounding, and raced down the hallway.

I burst through the door, my eyes wild, and saw Sarah standing in the middle of the room, her hands clawing at her own face, screaming like she was being torn apart from the inside.

“Sarah!” I shouted, rushing toward her. “Sarah, what’s happening?!”

But she didn’t answer. She just kept screaming, her eyes wide and terrified, her fingers digging into her skin until it bled.

“Laura!” I yelled, looking toward the door, but when I saw her standing there, my blood ran cold. She was watching me with that same blank, cold expression, like none of this mattered. Like I didn’t matter.

“Do something!” I screamed, my voice breaking.

But Laura just smiled—a small, cruel smile—and said nothing.

And then, it hit me. The realization came crashing down on me, so sudden and so intense that I nearly fell to my knees.

They hated me.

My family—my wife, my children—they hated me. The distance, the coldness, the silence—it wasn’t because they were tired or stressed or going through some phase. It was because they couldn’t stand me. My heart raced as the thought twisted itself deeper and deeper into my mind. The memories of their cold stares, their curt replies, the way Laura had started avoiding me altogether—it wasn’t paranoia. It was real. They wanted me out of their lives.

I could feel my chest tightening, my breath coming in shallow gasps. Sarah’s screams continued, but they seemed distant now, muffled, like they were coming from another room. All I could focus on was the hatred. The venom that seemed to ooze from every corner of this house. It was suffocating.

I backed out of Sarah’s room, stumbling down the hallway, my hands shaking. Laura was following me. I could feel her eyes on my back, that icy smile still curling her lips. I ran down the stairs, nearly tripping in my haste, my mind racing with panic.

I ended up in the kitchen, my heart pounding in my chest. The lights above flickered, casting strange shadows on the walls. The house felt like it was closing in on me, like the walls were breathing, watching, waiting for something. I grabbed the counter to steady myself, my fingers slipping on the smooth surface, sweat and fear making everything feel unreal, slippery.

That’s when I saw it—the knife block on the counter.

The thought came so suddenly, so violently, that it made my head spin. The idea of it, the need for it, was overwhelming. I could end it. I could end all of it. The hate, the distance, the emptiness. I could take control. I could make them pay for everything they’d put me through. Laura, with her cold eyes and her cruel smile. Sarah and Michael, with their indifference, their silence.

I reached out, my hand trembling, and pulled one of the knives free. The weight of it was reassuring, solid in my hand. I gripped it tighter, feeling the cold steel against my skin. My breath came in shallow gasps as I turned, the kitchen spinning around me.

And there they were.

Laura stood in the doorway, watching me, her face expressionless. Behind her, Sarah and Michael stood side by side, their eyes blank, staring at me with that same cold detachment. None of them moved. None of them said a word.

I took a step toward them, the knife held out in front of me. My heart was pounding so loud it felt like it would burst from my chest.

“I’ve had enough,” I said, my voice shaking. “I’m done. I can’t do this anymore.”

No response. Just those cold, empty eyes staring back at me. The hate was palpable, suffocating. I could feel it pressing down on me from all sides, thickening the air, making it hard to breathe.

“I’m going to end this,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “I’m going to end all of it.”

And then, everything exploded.

I lunged forward, the knife flashing in the dim light. Laura didn’t scream. She didn’t fight. She just stood there, watching me with those dead eyes as the blade plunged into her chest. I felt the resistance as it sank in, felt the warmth of her blood spilling over my hands. She crumpled to the floor, her body limp and lifeless.

But I wasn’t done.

Sarah and Michael… they stood there, still as statues, their faces unreadable. I turned to them, my vision blurring with rage and pain and confusion. I couldn’t even see their faces clearly anymore—just shadows, silhouettes in the dark. I swung the knife, felt it connect, heard the dull thud of bodies hitting the floor.

And then there was silence.

I don’t know how long I stood there, staring down at their bodies, the blood pooling around them, staining the floor. My hands were shaking, the knife slipping from my grasp and clattering to the ground. The house was so quiet now. Too quiet.

But something felt wrong.

The kitchen… the walls… the whole place. It was all wrong.

The house wasn’t my dream house anymore. The paint was peeling, the floorboards creaked under my weight, and the walls were covered in dust. I blinked, trying to clear my vision, but it only got worse. The pictures on the walls—they were gone. The frames were still there, hanging crooked on the walls, but the photos inside were missing. No. Not missing. Changed.

Where once there were photos of us as a family—me, Laura, Sarah, and Michael—there were only pictures of me. Alone. In every photo, I was standing by myself. No Laura. No kids. Just me, staring back at myself from every frame.

My stomach twisted into knots, a cold sweat breaking out over my skin. I turned slowly, looking around the room. The house felt… dead. There was no sign of life here. The dishes in the sink were covered in grime, the curtains hung limp and faded, and the air smelled musty, like it hadn’t been lived in for years.

I staggered backward, nearly slipping in the blood. My heart pounded in my ears, my head spinning. None of this made sense. None of this was right.

I rushed to the front door, throwing it open, desperate for air. But when I stepped outside, the world beyond the porch was dark, featureless, like a void. The street, the neighbors’ houses—they were gone. There was nothing. Just blackness. An endless, suffocating blackness stretching out in every direction.

I stumbled back inside, slamming the door shut, my hands shaking uncontrollably. I turned and looked at the house again, my mind racing, trying to make sense of what I was seeing.

And that’s when I saw them—the bodies.

Not Laura’s. Not Sarah’s or Michael’s.

They were mine. All of them. In the kitchen, in the hallway, in the living room. Different versions of me, lying on the floor, bloodied and broken, their eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. I couldn’t breathe. My chest felt tight, my vision blurry.

And then, the truth hit me.

They had never been here. Laura, Sarah, Michael—none of them were real. I had been alone this whole time. I’d always been alone. This house, this life, it was all in my head.

I collapsed to my knees, the weight of the realization crushing me. The walls around me seemed to breathe, to pulse with the madness that had consumed me for so long. I could feel it wrapping around me, choking the last bit of sanity from my mind.

I looked down at the knife, still slick with blood, lying at my feet. My own blood.

In the end, there was only one way out.

The house is quiet now.

Empty
