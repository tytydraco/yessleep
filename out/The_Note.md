The note in the clouded cabin in the woods:

The night, the balloted night, the sight of death, was too close.

Hello, my name is Mark my age is 35 and I read something I shouldn't of, why, why did I read the god dam note. I live with my grandma let's call her Stacey, so Stacey and I live in a small, belonged house at the end of my town. At the end of my town there appears a forest, never been there before, never want too really.

Me and my grandma are unemployed for her, mainly because of her age, for me, well I'm just shit at everything I'm told ha-ha. One night I am helping my grandma re-sought the house and change it up a bit, and my grandma needed help getting stuff out the attic, but the sight on my grandma’s face had the sight of retreat, she didn't want me going up the attic? I didn't know why but she instructed me to go in there to a specific spot or I'm out the house apparently, my grandma is 86 so I didn't really believe her, but her face said it all, so I obliged, and I went in the attic.

I went in the attic to realise a bang, yes, a bang I turn in confusion, and I see some books fell of a rocking chair? I didn't want to know any more I wanted to get out, but then a glimpse over and see a note with my name on it, I'm way to curious of a person so I don't retreat down the steps like my grandma told me to but, I scavenged round the books and collected the note. Once I told my grandma what the bang was, I just said some books fell, my grandma screamed,

“Which ones!”

I think should I tell her? I resist and say the one at the back of the attic and my grandma said,

“Ah okay dear, uhm anything else my dear?!”

“No, No don't worry Granny, nothing else!”

She retreats back to her old cragged seat falling apart the minute, I went into my room, you see my parents died and I became beavered at age 7, so I really don't know any relative's or really anything about them other than my mom's photos, old photos of her as a teen, from my grandmas living-room – and my grandma really had nothing and my parents left nothing to her not even a bit of money so we struggled, but we strived and survived, despite all this effort I'm still left with a 8x3 size room barely fits a small bed and a cabinet, and my bed state well: springs everywhere, dust, and a swanky smell always there, makes since we did get is for really cheap when I was 11 since my old bed broke from me training my self-defence since this kid bullied and beat me up as a kid for my parents dying.

So, I sat down, well really crouched down on my bed and read this note it reads:

‘To my dearest son, if you see this, we are dead, it's not your fault it's your grandmas! She trapped us and let me and your father rot and die for the reason of creating a magical thing like you! I'm righting this note with are last pen-ink in the room. Me and your father hidden it from her and stored it to right this note, oh shit wait wha-” It’s went all unreadable, I don't understand? What does she mean about grandma though I don't get it? She is lovely, yes mysterious, ominous, and weird sometimes but that's granny, nothing different from when she, she and I met...

Shit.

I see on the back of the note some coordinates, since my learning in school in geography I know how to read coordinate's, it reads a location to.

Fuck, no-way – it’s the woods next to my grandmas, no one goes there – why is it there?

It's after night this is one of 7 of grandma's golden rules this one is do not leave bedroom after 6, screw it I'm doing it, I leave through the window I clumpered to the ground to the sights of blood? Is it me oh... it appears yes, I'm bleeding from the drop must of scratched my leg somehow, oh well, I adventured towards the woods and see this shack sorts more really cabin lurking in the woods, the woods is dull kind of fuggy more around the cabin, as well of this I feel frigid here; never felt this way before is it me or does this house give the creeps?

I don't want to know so I turn, I turn and see trees. Trees? Yes trees it appears I have been located to the middle part of the woods, I wonder in confusion and run the opposing way from the cabin-home, and I end back at this rusty old broken, cabin, once I enter the cabin boundaries I feel a malodorous sense from the environment change, I didn’t care I felt like I was being stalked, watched maybe; however I did not care I ran into the cabin and smell the most ferrous and horrific smell I have ever smelt, it smells like rotten cow meat, I close the cabin door and lock it with the one lock on the door, I look away from the door and here a knock on the door I lunged backwards and retreated from the door, panicking I am, I ran away next to the window and see this girl in this white-cloth, dress, her eyes was a black absorbed ball with blood coming out of her eye-lids, I pounced back and seen her smiling grin and her stare, drenched with blood and clogs in her hair, she looks insane I think, no scratch that I know.

I said, “Fuck it!” -  And shouted through the door

“What do you want, and who are you!?”

The girl slowly stared back at my ass through the glass, then lunged to the glass and smashed a-bit on the edge, I said: “Fuck that, I will shoot!” - I didn't have a gun but she didn't know that, this ill girl stared with her horrifying grin and turned clockwise, she went further into the woods, eventually I did calm down and realised from the adrenaline I heated up, so I started to sweat, I didn't care, I realised that would be a stupid mistake on my end in the near the close future creeping ahead of me slowly.

I go out the cabin with a broken beer glass still thinking why am I sent here? I get some logs to heat the cabin up and heard a laugh, a screech, and a howling claw sound against the tree, I didn't want to see if it was a bear or this ill girl, so I ran, I ran I said faster than I ever had before, must of beaten a world record or something, because I made the cabin faster than a second locked the door and screamed:

“Fuck off!”

The beast, the girl maybe, slowly crept closer, I didn't want to know what would happen to me if left the cabin, so I went to sleep with the hearing of banning and laughing.

I awake in the morning its bright but still frigid I feel, also the woods look isolated with no bugs, animals, people.

Luckily, I felt safer without the women part but the rest, well no I mean I felt like I was in control of some higher forces, not the good kind. I lunged out of bed to see another note, why did I not notice this last night? I didn't care and went for it, it read:

“My son, when u see this your grandmother is coming for you now, you must run now son, run I say, run.” I read and said towards myself:

“Is that my dad?”

I didn't care and questioned the bigger picture, what did he mean run?

My grandma can't run what is he on about, but I didn't question it further on, I left the cabin to see the sight of this laughing girl, I look back at the note and see a picture of this girl and there is words stating she is my sister and I must save her from her hell, I realise this girl is my sister and she had escaped some sort of asylum or institute, so I slowly gained the strength to walk up to her, since its day I feel warmer and safer, No!

She lunged at me, tried to bite me? I said: “No” and ran back to the cabin but with the insight from what my dad said so I quickly changed direction and ran back home, I slip and fall, and I hit my head on a stone.

I awake and glimpse my sister walking, no jogging, no? Running! Towards me I get up with blood gashing from my head and I see the end, the end of the forest I see, I appear out the forest I was once trapped in and go back home.

Forgetting the part where my grandma will be chasing me I went back in home and remembered, so I went to the kitchen quickly, it's now 7 pm so I know my grandmas upstairs, I equipped myself with a kitchen rouged knife, and lurked upstairs slowly, I eventually see my grandmas mouth sobbing with foam and a needle in her arm, she killed herself? I wondered with tears pouring down my face, I see next to her a note.

A note from my parents stating for her to kill herself to become stronger to kill me if I left the house? I startled and confused left the house wondering who is the bad guy here, seconds later the police arrive and arrest me for murder?

The police suspect me murdering my grandma with a knife, I asked the police who called, and they stated:

“Your grandma said you were drunk and ill in the head son, and she then seconds later, Shes dead.”

I leap and say,

“That wasn't me!”

The police didn't care and put me to trial, I am now in a mental institute and am writing this note with my own blood, is this really my fate?

I wonder that thought alone.

Isolated I am, trapped I am, I'm next to be realised to the woods I am, I'm next to rot alone.

I know I am. End my misery God I plead.
