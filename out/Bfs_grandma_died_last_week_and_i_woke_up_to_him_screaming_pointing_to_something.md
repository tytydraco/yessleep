Hello people of this community. This is my first post and all i can say is that i relate to so many paranormal encounters ever since i was a kid. I did not see the ghosts near me until this week.  
i had some encounters like.. a ball being thrown in my chair (i was alone in the room and when i looked back, it only moved forward to me like physics, action-reaction, did not see anyone there). Some other minorities like hearing dishes move, seeing a teaspoon move in the cup, a random shadow on the wall, just looking like a normal person standing there ,watching me, another random shadow in the corner without a shape but the next night it was a shadow of a child sitting in a corner with his legs crossed and arms on the knees looking kinda sad... and so on.  
*I was also told that something is following me*, i do not feel weird all of the time but i can sense that there's something there. not threatning but sometimes helping me. (i once fell asleep while driving for a few seconds and i felt something move my wheel and i dodged hitting a wall). im mostly scared of these things

So last week my boyfriend's grandma passed and last night i slept at his place. We went to sleep around 3am and at 5am it happened. I am lightsleeper and i woke up randomly, facing the ceiling with the puffy blanket on me so i could barely see around. I noticed him slightly moving his head up, lift an arm directing to the right corner (i was on the right side of the bed) and screamed 3 times as if something was there. His arm was blocking my view as well, and all i could see through the blanket and his arm, **was a part of a shadow standing right in front of the bed**. NOT on it, but literally at the end of my side of the bed. i was too scared to look so i just put my hand over my eyes and pressed myself towards him, asking him if he's sleeping. He then woke up, did not remember any of this, but all he knew was that he was dreaming of his grandma's funeral.  
Just to mention, his apartment is in a new built building, next to a church, he doesn't know anything about the existence of a cemetry. His bedroom walls are white and i could easily distinguish the "thing" when it happened.  
He also felt like something was sitting next to the bed, on the right side, on the bed , on the blanket, or even pulling the blanket a bit *WAY before his grandma's death*.

Can this be his grandmother or some random spirit? things like this happen to me and i expect it to be anything since nobody died in any of the apartments and we had this encounter at his place. His grandma never went to his apartment and he's moved in 1 year ago.  
**Has this happened to any of you?** i did not encounter sleep paralysis ,i was literally awake at that point when it happened.
