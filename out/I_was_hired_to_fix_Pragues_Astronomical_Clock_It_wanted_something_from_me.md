 received the invitation at three in the morning, Chicago time.

It was a brief email, with the official letterhead of the Prague City Council. They addressed me by name, mentioned previous work with historical clocks, and quickly got to the point: the Astronomical Clock had been malfunctioning for weeks. Unexplained advances, brief stops, small “jumps” that local technicians could not justify. They wanted me to travel there, evaluate the mechanism, and, if possible, repair it.

They would pay for my flight, hotel, and fees. Anyone in my profession would have said yes.

It's not every day that you're asked to put your hands on a machine that has been defying time for centuries. What I didn't know then was that they were also inviting me to give something in return.

Before traveling, I looked for information, as I always do. Old plans, photographs of restorations, technical reports. The Internet, archives, forums. Among the serious documents, the same story kept cropping up, repeated with variations: the legend of the blinded master clockmaker. They said that after he built the clock, the city authorities had his eyes gouged out so that he couldn't reproduce it elsewhere. In some versions it was out of envy, in others out of fear. In all of them, the man ended up blind, mad, or dead.

I never believed in such things. I took it as folklore. People delighted in embellishing the story with medieval cruelty. I close a clock, turn off the light in the workshop, and I still see gears in my head; I suppose I also saw that legend as a simple narrative device. Something useful for tourism.

Until I arrived in Prague.

When I crossed over to the Old Town and saw the clock for the first time, I felt something that a technician accustomed to iron and screws shouldn't feel: a primal unease, the kind that doesn't come from reason, but from a more ancient corner of the brain. It wasn't just a machine, it wasn't just stone and gears: it was a gaze. A gaze that had survived generations, wars, and centuries, and that, for one absurd second, I could swear stopped on me.

The cold was brutal. Not that gentle cold that forces you to bundle up, no: that cold that seems to suggest you're not welcome to stay there for long. I adjusted my jacket and cursed. It wouldn't be the last time.

The official who came to meet me was called Jiri. He was a thin man in his fifties, wearing a cheap suit, with nervous hands. He gave me my accreditation, showed me how to access the building, and went over the security protocol. Just before leaving, when he had already turned towards the door, he stopped.

“I suppose you've already read about our clock,” he said.

“Reports, plans, articles. The usual.”

He smiled, but it wasn't an amused smile.

“I mean the other part. The stories.”

I didn't answer. I didn't need to. My face gave me away.

“The one about the blinded master, for example,” he continued. “The tour guides love that one. I won't waste your time, but...” He lowered his voice. "There's one thing they don't tell you. Ever since then, every time someone really interferes with the mechanism... something happens. A sudden illness, an accident, a loss. 

Nothing that can be proven, of course. Nothing that appears in a report.

“Are you trying to scare me before I even start?” I tried to joke.

He didn't laugh.

"I just want you to know that people here don't take this clock lightly. Nor the legends.

He left me the keys and left.

That first night, I went up alone.

The noise of the square faded with each step. When I closed the wooden door behind me, the sound of the city died away. All that remained was a metallic, deep, constant beat. It wasn't a ticking. It was slower, deeper. It sounded like restrained breathing.

I turned on my flashlight.

The interior of the tower was a huge skeleton of iron and wood. Blackened gears, wheels like rusty ribs, axles embedded in stone. Above, motionless figures seemed to watch from small secret windows. The air smelled of old oil, dust, and something I had only noticed in churches that had been closed for too long: a mixture of dampness, dead incense, and wilted flowers.

The clock had been malfunctioning: running fast, stopping briefly, “skipping” seconds. I had read the technical records at the hotel; the official explanation spoke of wear and tear and possible errors in previous adjustments. It seemed reasonable. I believed in that: in metal, in precision. Not in curses.

And yet, as I climbed toward the heart of the mechanism, the story of the blinded master came back to my mind. I imagined him climbing the same stairs, proud, convinced that his work would make him immortal. And then coming down without sight, guided by other people's hands, blindfolded or with empty eyes.

The back of my neck went cold.

I shook my head, annoyed with myself.

As I climbed the steps of the tower, the atmosphere became oppressive. The smell was unbearable: old oil, dust... and something sweet and rotten that shouldn't have been there.

For the first time, I felt something I hate to admit: the premonition that what awaited me up there did not entirely belong to the world I thought I knew.

Damn it! I tripped over a step I shouldn't have seen, although I could have sworn it wasn't there.

I finally reached the center of the machinery.

I was alone. Or so I thought. That's when I heard the first voice.

“Don't touch anything.”

I stood still. The voice came from very close behind me. I turned so quickly that I almost tripped over a cogwheel.

There was no one there.

Only the immense mechanism, breathing in its own way. I swallowed hard, aware of the absurdity: I was tired from the trip, influenced by the stories and by an official who was too prone to drama. The brain creates echoes, I told myself. I felt ridiculously scared for someone who had only come to check the gears.

I forced myself to work.

The first few hours were almost reassuring. I found what I expected to find: a worn axle, a loose part, a small crack in one of the main wheels. Nothing that a modern workshop couldn't fix. Nothing that justified such hysteria.

Until I saw the engravings.

They were on a piece of metal that, in theory, no one should look at closely except during a major repair. Names. Dozens of names. Each one accompanied by a date. Some were centuries old, written in ancient script. Others were recent, from decades that I could still remember in color.

One of them caught my attention because I recognized the surname; I had seen it in a restoration report from the early nineties. The technician responsible died the following year in an absurd accident, I vaguely remembered from a side note.

I continued reading names. Dates. Names.

The last one was incomplete. Just a first name and an initial; someone had been interrupted before finishing.

It was at that moment that the clock stopped.

It wasn't a malfunction. When a machine really breaks down, you notice it: it groans, it brakes badly, it makes a dirty noise. That wasn't the case here. It was a clean pause. Absolute.

Silence fell over the tower like a coffin lid.

The figures stopped vibrating.

The bells fell silent.

And I felt—in a physical, almost painful way—how the city held its breath on the other side of the stone.

I heard the second voice.

“One is missing.”

This time it wasn't a whisper. It sounded clear, sharp, right behind me. I turned around. And I saw her.

Tall, excessively thin, wrapped in a dark cloak that seemed to absorb what little light there was. She had no face, or I couldn't see it; it was like looking at an absence, a hole in reality with a human form. It wasn't a shadow, it wasn't smoke. But it wasn't a body as we understand it either. It was something earlier, inevitable, like the moment just before a machine starts up.

I didn't move. I don't even know if I could.

“This clock doesn't measure time,” she said without opening her cloak, without a mouth to articulate words. “It holds it. It keeps it tied to this city so that everything continues.”

Her voice didn't sound in my ears, but inside my skull.

“Every century, every decade, every cycle,” she continued, “demands balance. Nothing moves forward for free.”

I felt the absurd temptation to look at the engraved names, but I forced myself not to. I understood.

“I just repair mechanisms.”

“No,” he replied. “You repair the cage of the world.”

The metal groaned. It was a long, deep, almost animalistic sound. The wheels shook without moving. I felt my hand resting on the side of something enormous that was enduring an impossible effort.

“It stops when an offering is missing,” he said.

I heard myself ask, in a voice that didn't seem to be mine:

“What kind of offering?”

"Life. Memory. Sight. Blood. Something it can devour to keep turning. Before, kings. After, craftsmen. Now... whoever touches it.

I thought of the legend of the master clockmaker. Of his eyes being gouged out so that he could never create anything like it again. I had always heard it as a warning against human envy. There, in front of that presence, I understood another interpretation: they did not blind him to punish him, but to pay him. So that the clock could continue.

I looked at the list of names. I understood.

Every major repair had come at a price.

Every time someone meddled too much with that mechanism, the clock took its toll.

And now it was looking at me.

“I'm not going to do it,” I said.

I wanted it to sound firm.

It didn't sound firm.

“Then it won't move,” it replied.

And the night stopped moving forward.

I felt it before I saw it. A weight, a new density in the air. The temperature dropped, but not like when you open a window. It was a cold that came from time itself, from the idea of time.

I looked through a small crack toward the square. The streetlights were still on.

People were moving. But something was wrong.

Their steps seemed too slow. The lights from their cell phones left trails that took a long time to fade. Cigarette smoke hung in the air, twisting with grotesque slowness.

The figure spoke again.

“If you don't pay, time will stop here. First minutes. Then hours. Then years. This city will be trapped. It will rot standing up.”

I thought of Jiri. Of the tourists. Of the people sleeping, unaware. Of all those who, the next day, would look at their watches as if they were a charming spectacle of mechanical dolls.

“What do you want?” I asked.

I knew the answer before he moved.

The figure pointed at my eyes.

I felt a sharp sting in my eye sockets. I remembered the master watchmaker. I remembered all the versions of the legend. Blind, mad, dead.

I took a deep breath. I've never suffered from panic attacks, but at that moment I discovered what it was like not to be able to fill my lungs.

I closed my eyelids. I accepted. There were no knives. There were no hands.

Just a brutal pull inward. A white burn, then black, then nothing. I lost my balance and grabbed onto a cold shaft. I heard my own scream, far away, as if it were coming from another floor of the tower.

Then the clock started ticking again.

The sound of the mechanism filled the space with a new, voracious force. The wheels loosened, light, grateful. Above, I heard the figures moving. The bells rang out in the night, louder than ever.

And the city went on.

I don't know how much time passed after that.

When I opened my eyes, I saw nothing. No shadows, no light. Just a compact, uniform darkness. I heard voices. Hurried footsteps. Hands touching my shoulder. They asked me if I was okay. Someone said my name, with an accent, Michael, Michael. Another voice, perhaps Jiri's, ordered them to call an ambulance.

I smiled.

It's funny: at that moment, I didn't feel afraid.

I felt relief.

At the hospital, they talked about an inexplicable condition, a possible neuropathy, additional tests. They ran tests on me, bombarded me with lights I couldn't see. They wrapped my head in buzzing machines. They said long words that I won't repeat. In the end, they translated it into something understandable:

“We don't know why it happened,” they told me, “but the injury is irreversible.”

They didn't insist on the causes.

Neither did I.

Days later, Jiri came to see me.

He sat down next to the bed. He smelled of stale tobacco and rain. He didn't say anything for a while. He just breathed. I listened to the monitor, the slow drip of an IV, the footsteps in the hallway.

“The clock is working perfectly,” he finally said. “It hadn't worked like that in years.”

I noticed a nauseating mixture of pride and resentment in the way he spoke.

“They've been checking the machinery,” he added. “One of the technicians found something curious.”

Pause.

“There's a new name engraved on the metal. Very recent. Dated this week.”

My throat closed up. He didn't need to say it, but he did.

“Michael Turner,” he whispered. “And the year.”

I didn't want to know any more.

They offered to keep my open return ticket, but I insisted on going back. Before I left, I asked for one thing: that no one talk to me about the clock. That they not describe how it had been left, or what the press was saying, or if people had noticed anything strange those days. I told them I wasn't interested.

I lied.

I'm interested in every detail.

But I know that if I hear it, I won't be able to keep pretending that this was just an accident.

Now I'm back home. Learning to move in the dark. I hear clocks I used to ignore. The ones in the kitchen, the living room, the hallway. They all seem louder since then.

Then I know it's him.

The clock.

I can't see it, but I can feel it. It beats. It breathes. It waits.

Because for it to turn, someone always has to pay. And the legends, believe me, have never lied completely.

Today I'm still alive, yes. But I live in a darkness that doesn't belong to this world.

And when, in the middle of the night, I hear that metallic heartbeat that doesn't come from any wall, but from some remote place that may not even be on Earth, I know it's still there. Watching me. Reminding me.

Because I didn't repair a clock.

I served something that serves itself.

And if you ever travel to Prague and the clock stops, don't pray for it to start moving again. Don't invoke its mercy. It has none. That artifact does not belong to man.

And every time it turns, it does so with blood.

Just remember this: what continues to beat up there is not at our service. It is we who continue to be at its service.
