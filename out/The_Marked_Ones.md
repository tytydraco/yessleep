The last time I posted about this, I recounted the events of my early childhood growing up in an Appalchian town in Virginia. I briefly mentioned our unspoken rules, and what happened to me in the forest. But this was only the tip of a very big, very deep iceberg. If you didn’t see the first part, I’ll link it here:

Honestly, you can read this without knowing about that, but it does provide some useful context.

After the events I discussed in part one, life became relatively normal again. I continued my homeschooling with my dad, who I got most of my social interaction from. I spent my time indoors, mostly reading. In truth, I had become afraid to go outside. I had explained to the police and to my parents about that night- that Katie had led me into the woods - but I was shrugged off at every turn. 

My mom did take me to a doctor after it happened. She was worried I had hallucinated and that it was a sign of some mental condition. The doctor said it was probably a response to stress - that I’d imagined Katie because I felt isolated, and my brain filled in the gaps with something familiar. A defense mechanism, he called it.

I didn’t believe a word of it. I heard her voice. I felt her touch. Those were no illusions.  But I went along with their explanation anyway. It was clear I would get no support and I just wanted the whole thing to be over. This seemed like the easiest way for that to happen.

Like I said, I was afraid to be outside. My town was a tiny island in an ocean of green. There was no escaping the forest, it stood on every horizon - and so did the things that lurked within it. Being outside made me feel like one of those worms you feed to reptiles. Like I was trapped in a cage with something dangerous. Yet, unlike the worms, I had never seen whatever thing caused my nightmares.

My solution, as I mentioned, was to remain inside as much as possible. I figured that whatever was in the forest would leave me alone if I just hid myself away.

This created an underlying problem that my parents quickly picked up on: I was becoming socially awkward. Weird, frankly. 

So, when I was 11, they enrolled me in the same middle school that Katie was going to. I had mixed feelings. Being an awkward kid, I was terrified. But at the same time, my crush on Katie had only gotten stronger since the day we became friends. 

I held no resentment or fear of her, despite what had happened. She had told me earnestly it wasn't her that day- and I took her at her word. She had been my best and only friend, and I trusted her.

The first half of the year reflected my contrasting emotions. I was bullied quite often, only to have Katie stand up for me. Honestly, I didn’t make being friends with me easy. I often remember and shrivel up at how unaware and embarrassing I was. I can only imagine how Katie felt. 

She was tiny compared to the guys who picked on me, but that didn’t deter her in the least. She would, and on occasion did, flatten anyone who tried to mess with me. I had my own personal bodyguard keeping me safe. 

But one week, Katie wasn’t around. If I recall correctly, she had some far away relative’s funeral to attend. So for that week, I was a sitting duck. Something that the older kids took advantage of every chance they got. My armor was gone, and this was a golden opportunity to freely mess with the homeschooled kid. 

I remember coming home with a black eye only to get scolded by my dad for fighting. I thought I was going to die that week. I’m pretty confident I would’ve gotten worse than the eye if it hadn’t been for Micah. 

I met him on a humid afternoon during lunch period. I was sitting alone, as I had been all week without Katie, when a green eyed boy with an Avenged Sevenfold t-shirt made himself comfortable next to me. My mouth opened as I tried to form words, but my vocal cords failed me.

Without a word, he went through my lunch box as if it was his. I assumed he was just another bully, and I was hoping he’d simply take my food and leave me alone. I was content enough to go hungry if it meant I’d keep my other eye unblackened. But, after a moment of shuffling through my food he just said, 

“Your lunch sucks, dude. An egg sandwich and broccoli? Your parents hate you or something?”

I was dumbfounded - one part relieved he didn’t take my food or hit me, the other part offended by his attack on my lunch.

I offered a shy explanation, 

“Well it’s really not so bad. I like egg sandwiches and broccoli is good for you.”

He waved his hand dismissively to silence me. Reaching into his backpack, he brandished a bag of potato chips and gave them to me. 

I hesitantly took them from him as he spoke,

“You’re that new kid, right? I’m Micah.”

He looked me over. With a boyish grin, he added, 

“Y’know, you wouldn’t get beat up so much if you quit wearing that lame shirt.”

This left me even more dumbfounded than his previous comment about my food. My Ninja Turtles shirt was my pride and joy. I immediately felt foolish, untying the jacket around my waist and putting it over my shirt despite the warm weather.

Stuttering, I answered him, “Im Richard. But my friends call me Rich.”

He asked, 

“Friends? Don’t you only hang out with that other girl?”

I felt as if I was having my life examined. A popular kid was questioning as to why I only had one friend. I had no good answer, only an embarrassed, 

“Yeah.”

His expression took on a more friendly disposition,

“Well, now you can hang out with two people.”

Looking back, I realized that Micah was doing me a bigger favor than just giving me junk food. He was popular in our grade, and he knew that if he sat with me, my bullies would leave me alone. A sort of social credit by proxy.

We chatted throughout that week, getting to know each other. He wasn’t like me at all- he was bold and confident almost to the point of arrogance. There was one thing that allowed us to connect- Micah liked art. We spent much of that first week flipping through each other’s notebooks, admiring the other’s work. He was admittedly better at it than I was.

Still, I wasn’t nearly as comfortable with him as I was with Katie. But he was a good person, even if he was a bit more obnoxious than I was used to. His parents were going through a particularly nasty divorce that year. Looking back, I wonder if his bold personality was a way to mask his turmoil. I really wish I had been a better friend to him - he needed more help than I knew.

When Katie did return, he remained. We had added a new member into our little duo. His personality meshed well with Katie’s- they weren’t entirely dissimilar. Katie’s fiery attitude and his boldness led us to all types of adventures. Ones whose memories still comfort me despite what happened after. 

Just as we always had, we spent our time outside of school wandering the town. We had been everywhere multiple times, but it never got old with my now group of friends. 

But I never forget where I was - the forest was still there. I had insisted we stopped playing on its outskirts ever since the night I got lost. Where before the treeline seemed familiar and friendly, it now felt ominous and foreboding. Almost like it was alive. It stood watch on the horizon, yearning to reach out and take what it had lost that night - me.

I think Katie picked up on my fear of the forest, and she never pushed me about it. Micah, on the other hand, was quick to probe me about it as soon as he saw how uncomfortable it made me.

It happened over spring break. We would spend the mornings playing baseball or messing with the neighbors. Then we would go get lunch in town with the allowance Micah’s parents gave him and go watch whatever awful horror movie was playing that night. It was the happiest I would ever be.

But, one day, Micah could resist the forest’s allure no longer. He suggested we all go swimming in the creek. It was pretty hot given the time of year, and the creek was a popular spot. Unfortunately, it was in the forest- a bit less than a quarter mile off of the path. There was no way I would even entertain the idea. When I gave my nervous rejection of his plan, he saw the fear on my face and said,

“C’mon, man. Don’t be a pussy. It’s literally just trees, rocks, and water.”

I didn’t want to explain to him that he was wrong. I couldn’t put it into words, but I knew there was something in those woods. Something unnatural. I had felt it breathing down my neck, heard its calculated steps as it stalked me. 

I just wanted to stop talking about it, so I gave a lame excuse,

“My dad said I’m not allowed in the forest. And I have to work on my history presentation, anyway. Sorry.”

Micah scoffed with a smug grin,

“Allowed? You’re not ‘allowed?’ Do you hear yourself? Take the stick out of your ass and have some fun, man.”

In truth, I hated this situation. Not just because Micah wanted me to go to the one place I never wanted to be again, but because it was a perfect illustration of his courage against my own timid cowardice. And what’s worse, it was happening right in front of Katie. 

Still, as she always did, Katie came to my rescue, 

“Nah, he’s right. His dad’s a hardass. He doesn’t even want him hanging out with me.”

“Ohhh,” 

he said, dragging the word out. 

“Is that what this is? Strict dad doesn’t want his little boy dating the bad influence next door?”

I wanted to hit Micah. He was making a fool of me on purpose. Making me look bad in front of Katie. 

I stammered, immediately flushed,

“I-I’m not dating anyone.”

Micah snickered.

“Sure, sure. Whatever you say, lover boy.”

Katie shoved his shoulder playfully and my stomach turned with jealousy,

“Alright, dickhead, enough teasing. Let’s just hang out somewhere not in the middle of a creepy old forest. Arcade? Bowling?”

The playful tone made me forget the friendship I had with Micah. Right now, all he was to me was competition. And one I didn’t think I could win.

Micah shrugged,

“Nah, I’m good. It's like a hundred degrees. Think I’ll check out the creek anyway. I could use a swim.”

“Alone?” Katie asked with genuine concern in her voice. Even without my superstition, the forest was not somewhere to be alone.

I then said something I will regret until my death. I encouraged him,

“What, you afraid he’ll get eaten by a pine tree?” I said with a smirk. “He’ll be fine.”
Even as the words left my mouth, I hated them. They weren’t mine-they were borrowed, stolen from the part of me that wanted to seem brave. That wanted to impress Katie. That wanted to be more like Micah.

Micah gave me a smile. He knew what I was doing and instead of calling me out, he played along-because that’s the kind of person he was.

“See? Richie here gets it. You two go hold hands at the bowling alley or whatever.”

He was wing-manning me. He knew I had a thing for Katie and he knew I was insecure. It fills me with shame to this day. I did not deserve to be his friend. I only wish I saw it back then, too.

Katie shrugged, “Suit yourself.”

We walked with him until the woods were in sight, which was as close as I was willing to get. We agreed to meet up again the next day, as we had that whole week. 

With that, Micah turned and sauntered toward the trail, whistling as he disappeared into the trees. My eyes remained on him for a moment as the woods swallowed him up, and a chill ran down my spine. 

Katie and I went to the arcade several blocks into the town. The whole time after we had left him, I had been rationalizing to myself that I was being paranoid about Micah. I told myself he was right- that all I was afraid of were trees and rocks. I was lying to myself, and I knew it. Still, I remember genuinely having fun that afternoon- laughing and losing track of time. For a while, I forgot to be afraid.

Spending time with Katie like we had when we first met erased my worries and my petty jealousy. And when the sun set and it was time for us to go home, all I felt was grateful that I had someone like her in my life in any capacity.

But we didn’t see Micah again the next morning. Usually, we would convene at this old convenience store- the type that has barrels full of old fashioned candies and toffees. It was a nice center point between mine and Katie’s neighborhood and Micah’s. 

We waited for an hour, then 2. I was trying to stay calm, but inwardly, panic was growing like a fire. I was sure that the forest, or whatever was in it, had snatched him up. That I had let my friend stroll right into his death because I was too cowardly, or too jealous of him, to stop him.

My panic grew to the point that it outweighed my desire to keep up a cool front. And so, Katie and I went to his house to check on him. His mom answered the door- a tall, thin woman who looked very tired. She gave us a smile and told us Micah came down with a fever. He was resting and would be fine. I asked if I could see him- only to say hello. I wanted to see with my own eyes that he was alright. Nothing else would soothe the crushing guilt I felt. 

Micah’s mother insisted that we let him rest and sent us on our way.

We didn’t hear from him for the remainder of spring break. I obsessed over his health for the remaining 2 days, constantly texting him and Katie for any new information. I was treating it as if he had been in some sort of near fatal accident. It wasn’t until the following Monday, when Micah strolled casually into class, that I was able to let out the breath I had been holding for days.

I must have been smiling in relief, because the first thing he did was make a kissy face and say, 

“Aw, missed me?”

I answered, annoyance clear in my voice, “I spammed your phone all week. I thought you died or something.”

He shrugged, 

“Yeah, I came down with something hard. Maybe some germs from the creek or whatever.”

“Gross,” Katie muttered.

He turned to me.

“You missed out, by the way. Creek was great. Water was cold as hell, but still.”

I scoffed, 

“Missed out on what, some disease-water and a fever? No thanks.”

I hesitated before adding,

“Glad you didn’t die, though. How bad was it?”

He laughed,

“Same. Honestly, not so bad. Just a flu. I did have some weird-ass dreams while I was out, though.”

Katie perked up. 

“Like what?”

He leaned back in his seat,

“I was in the forest- in a meadow. And I could hear someone talking to me. It’s weird, but I felt really good. Like, safe, I guess? I don’t know how to describe it well. It felt like Christmas when you’re a little kid. But I woke up before the dream could end. It was like turning off a movie before it’s over.”

Katie snickered, “You probably got high from your tiny brain being boiled by the fever. I’m surprised there are any brain cells left.”

Micah rolled his eyes,

“Whatever, it was the nicest dream I’ve had in forever.”

I stayed quiet. I didn’t like the forest. I was terrified of it. I knew there was nothing inherently sinister about Micah’s dreams, but any discussion about that place made me uneasy. 

We went through the week as we always did. School, exploring the town, then going home when the sun went down. Life in the wooded town resumed as normal- continuing on as time left it lagging behind. 

The only exception to this was Micah’s topics of conversation. As days turned to weeks, Micah would tell us more and more often about the amazing dreams he was having. 

We were sitting at a lunch table on an overcast afternoon, when Micah asked excitedly,

“Do you guys believe in Heaven?”

Katie and I both blinked, but Micah continued before we could say anything,

“My grandma died 7 years ago. But I keep seeing her in my dreams. She keeps telling me she's visiting me from Heaven. That she's here to help me.”

Katie spoke up, I think with innocent intention,

“My mom said people don't come back from Heaven. Why would they even want to?”

This seemed to anger Micah,

“Well... she’s wrong. My grandma’s been there.”

I looked at him.

“She talks to you?”

He nodded quickly, eyes bright.

“Almost every night. She says she misses me. Says she can help. She can make my parents stop fighting. Make things go back to how they used to be.”

Micah’s parent’s divorce was a bit of an elephant in the room throughout our friendship. I could tell it ate at him, but I never wanted to pry. He seemed to prefer to ignore it. 

I asked, careful not to further upset him,

“How?”

He didn’t answer right away. Then, softly:

“She says I just have to tell her my name.”

I asked,

“Your name? Wouldn't he already know it?”

Micah didn’t look at me. He just stared at the floor,

“She said names are different where she is. You have to give them again.”

None of us really knew what to say after that. It felt like something too strange-and too sad-to push back on. Micah, despite his usual appearances, had suffered a lot during his short life. And if this gave him hope, I didn’t see the harm in it.

But after that conversation, something in Micah started to shift.

For the next few weeks, he was just off. He looked exhausted all the time. He would zone out mid conversation, and he wasn't doing well in school anymore. Katie and I confronted him about it more than once, but he brushed it off as nothing each time. It got to the point where the teachers began to notice. They called him to the student counselors office regularly, making him absent during our lunch hang outs. 

I can remember one time he fell asleep in science class. Mr. Jackson, our science teacher, stopped mid-lecture and quietly walked him to the counselor’s office, like he’d done a dozen times already. He always seemed concerned about Micah, more than the other teachers. But he never said much about it. The school blamed his home life for his behavior, and maybe they were right.

Looking back, this was all perfectly explainable. Expected, even. I mentioned that Micah’s parents were going through an awful divorce. What middle schooler wouldn’t be sad and tired?

Katie and I did our best to help out. We would do his homework for him when he couldn’t, we brought extra food to school in case he didn’t have the energy to make a lunch, we invited him out to his favorite spots as often as we could- anything to cheer him up.

In truth, I just wanted my friend back. I felt stupid for being jealous of someone who had been so kind to me. And, after a few weeks, that’s exactly what I got. 

Micah sat down at our lunch table one sunny afternoon, wearing a grin like nothing had ever happened.

Katie and I froze mid-bite. He hadn't smiled in weeks.
Then he said, “Hey guys!”-as if he hadn’t spent a month vanishing into himself.

Katie and I exchanged glances before she gave a hesitant,

“...hey. You feeling alright?”

Micah, mouth full of his PB&J, simply nodded and said, “Mhm!”

Katie pushed a bit further, “How are your parents?”

Micah gave a confused look, “My parents? What about them?”


She asked, “Isn’t that why you’ve been so…I dunno, depressed?”

Micah shook his head, “Depressed? Nah, I just had some trouble sleeping.”

Katie was fed up with him. With annoyance in her voice, she asked “Can you just tell us already? You’ve been dead quiet for a month. What’s wrong?”

Micah paused, like he didn’t want to say it. His plastic smile faltered slightly. Then he exhaled through his nose and muttered, “It was my grandma.”

Katie gave an outraged scoff, “Your grandma? The one who’s been dead for like a million years? Why would that make you so sad out of nowhere?”

Micah finally gave up what he had been hiding, “No. I told you she comes to me in my dreams. She kept asking me what my name was but I…I don’t know, I just had a bad feeling. So I never told her. She got mad. Really, really mad. She kept screaming at me. Hurting me. I could feel it. Every time I woke up, my body still stung. I'm really sorry I’ve been so quiet and tired. But how would you feel if your grandma ripped you to pieces every night in your dreams?”

I was horrified, “It’s that bad?”

Micah nodded, “It was. My mom said I was having night terrors. Like, really bad nightmares pretty much. Don’t tell anyone this, but she took me to a shrink. Didn’t help though.”

Katie asked, “So, why do you look all chipper today?”

Micah smiled again, “Cuz it stopped! Last night was the best night’s sleep I’ve ever had.”

I asked, “It just…stopped? Just like that?”

Micah seemed a bit distant in his response, like he was in thought,“No, not just like that. Last night I-” He hesitated. “I was just so sick of it. I told her my name.”

I questioned, “And then the night terrors just went away?”

“Yeah. When I told her my name, she got really calm. Still. She said it back to me… and then he asked me something. She asked me…”

Micah’s words faded. He stared through the table, like he’d lost track of the conversation.

Katie coughed to get his attention, which snapped him out of it. He blinked, smiled, and popped the last corner of his sandwich into his mouth.

“Anyway, I’m fine now. Best night’s sleep I’ve had in forever.”

We didn’t question him further. I was just happy to see him with some life in his eyes again. I think Katie was too. 

Even this was selfish, however. Inwardly, I blamed all of this on his excursion to the creek. I had sent him there, knowing what could happen. The fact that he was okay again made me feel like I was absolved. The bullet had been dodged and we could go back to being friends.

And everything was perfect, just as it had been before. I was so relieved that life was normal again, I had resolved to let go of my jealousy towards Micah as best I could. 

The only notable difference I can remember from that time is that Micah had developed a habit of scratching and fidgeting with this spot right where his shoulder met his neck. At the time, I don’t think any of us thought anything of it.

To my great sadness, this period of peace didn’t last long. As the weeks went by, I saw less and less of Micah. Not in the sense that I didn’t spend time with him, but rather that he seemed so distant- and not like he was before. 

There was a constant fog that separated his mind from us, and we had to struggle through it for any amount of interaction with him.

In school, he looked like he was sleeping with his eyes open- perfectly still save the scratching. Just as before, Katie and I decided to confront him in hopes of coming up with some type of diagnosis for his behavior. But any attempt was short lived, as he would respond with one word answers or simply grunts. 

I can’t stress how bad this got. It was like Micah was fading away. Katie and I were panicking. We went to parents, teachers, anyone we could think of. We even took Micah to the hospital, leading him like a drugged animal. Looking back, it makes me sick. Every single one of them either dismissed it as nothing or made us question ourselves. 

We had all but given up hope until a rumor found its way to us. 

It started as a throwaway conversation with some girl in Katie’s gym class- someone she barely knew, just passing the time during warm-ups. Katie had made an offhand comment about Micah, something to the effect of, 

“Yeah, my friend’s been acting weird lately. Like he’s not even there anymore.”

But the girl surprised her.

“Creepy,” she said. “Sounds like that kid from Edison last year.”

Katie asked what she meant, and the girl shrugged it off. 

“I dunno. My cousin goes there. Said some guy just started acting super weird. Like, freaked-out weird. Wouldn’t talk to anyone. Pretty much a walking zombie. Then one day he just stopped coming to school. People say he ran away or something.”

Katie told me all of this that afternoon, her voice low and nervous.

“His name was Dylan. He was the same as Micah-the sleepwalking, the brain fog. Apparently his friends even said he wouldn’t shut up about his dreams.”

I had never heard his name before. Neither had anyone I knew. A different kid. A different school. But the same signs.

“Do you know when it happened?” I asked.

Katie pulled out her phone. She’d already looked it up. “February eleventh last year. That’s the last day anyone saw him.”

My blood froze in my veins. I knew that day. It was the same day this nightmare had started- the night I had gone missing in the woods. 
I didn’t say anything at first. Katie just sat there, eyes locked on the ground like she was afraid of what I might say.

Something had tied us all together. Not with rope or chains, but with something older. Something malevolent.

After that, I started watching Micah differently. Not like a friend, but as a hospice patient. We had exhausted our options- asked everyone we knew to ask, checked every corner of the library and of the internet. No one had any explanation that could cure our friend. 

That didn’t stop us from trying, of course. But inwardly, I knew we wouldn’t succeed.

Towards the end, I would often catch Micah standing dead still, facing the horizon- the same, dark, looming treeline that I tried so hard to forget meeting Micah’s gaze. He did begin to speak more, but it was not any sign of recovery, only incoherent ramblings.

The school handled it as they had before- sending him to frequent but fruitless counselor meetings. It wasn’t unusual for him to spend most of the day in the school’s office.

I spent a lot of my time alone crying. Through the year that I’d known him, he’d really touched my heart. He stood up for me without fail anytime I needed him. He pushed my boundaries, giving me the bravery to leave my shell. He and Katie had been the best friends I ever could’ve asked for. 

I blamed myself for what he had become- this hollowed out version of the boy I knew. I couldn't explain it, but this was all because of that night in the woods- because of me. The forest’s eyes had never left me since that day. Not for an instant. And now Micah was paying for it.

We would sit with him during our free periods and after school and talk to him. I don’t think he really heard us anymore. Wherever he had gone, he was far away from us. 

On one afternoon like this, Katie, Micah and I were sitting by the front of the school. The day had passed and we were waiting for our parents to come get us. We were chatting half heartedly, trying to get Micah to react to something, anything. We had put a pen and notebook into Micah’s limp hands, trying without success to get him to draw like he used to. 

 Katie’s mom was the first to arrive. She hesitated, but I could tell she was glad to leave. Seeing Micah like this was hard on her, too.

After she left, I spoke to Micah. Casually at first, I mentioned schoolwork, sports, shows we used to talk about. But he didn’t so much as blink. The only movement was when he would scratch at his neck.

Eventually, I told him things I had been holding back- things I should’ve expressed to him long before,

“Hey, Micah. I never really told you….”

He didn’t move, speak, or do anything to even acknowledge my presence. 

“You’re my best friend.”

I had already begun to tear up. I paused, hoping for a response. But when none came, I went on,

“You should've just stayed away from me that day. You should've just let those 8th graders beat me up. None of this would've happened if you’d just ignored me like everyone else.”

My words were every bit as rambling as Micah’s, but I didn’t care. Tears were streaming down my cheeks. I didn’t know the words to portray what I wanted to say to him. But, even if I did, it wouldn’t have mattered. Micah was gone. He had been for weeks now. So, I said the only thing I could think to say,

“I’m sorry.”

Micah’s eyes never left the forest at the edge of town.

I should’ve screamed. Or shaken him. Or begged him to come back. But I didn’t.

I just sat there, hollow and quiet- same as him.

After a long silence, he started rambling again.

At first, it was just sounds- wet clicks of his tongue, breathless muttering.

Then words, but barely.

“The trees go down and never stop. Just more wood, curling like veins.”

I swallowed. Hard. I didn’t know what he was talking about. I froze.

It was the panic of a child faced with something too big, too strange. That useless kind of fear where all you can do is watch.

And then, without warning, his voice became frantic. A panicked yell, almost rabid.

“Throat full of pinecones… bark under my skin. Under my soul. Hollows them out. Fills them up with leaves. The roots…”

His hands  worked furiously. With one, he was scribbling madly into the notebook on his lap, shaking so hard I thought he might break apart. The other hand scratched at his neck as he raved on,

“A mouth with seven teeth and no tongue.”

He paused.

Then whispered, almost reverently:

“And under… empty.”

That’s when Mr. Jackson, our science teacher, approached. I guess Micah’s outburst had drawn attention from inside the building.

He crouched beside us, placing a gentle hand on Micah’s shoulder. It was so subtle, I barely noticed. Mr. Jackson’s eyes lingered for just a moment too long on the spot that Micah had been scratching all this time. 

I saw it too- a tiny mark in the center of his raw patch of skin. I only saw it for a moment. It wasn’t something I could explain away as a bug bite or a rash. It was like someone had left a tiny brand on him from within his skin.

Mr. Jackson hid his glance with a warm smile at me,

“I’ll take care of him. You just get home, OK?”

Then he turned to Micah, speaking softly, guiding him up like someone handling a wounded animal. The notebook fell from his lap to the dust below. Mr. Jackson didn’t ask questions- just led Micah slowly back toward the school.

I was still frozen in place. But I trusted Mr. Jackson. He had always been kind to me. After a moment, I looked down at Micah’s book, which I choose to believe he left for me intentionally. It gives me comfort to think he was still there. That he heard my words to him.

In his frantic episode, he had scribbled words into pages- nearly stabbing through them with the pen. Words that, like their predecessors from my first post, will never leave my mind,

“Speak low beneath the dreaming bark,
Or bear what cannot fade.
The ones who answer gentle calls,
Wake with roots now softly laid.

There are no walls of rock or stone,
Yet none shall ever leave.
For those who stray are called below,
And fathers wail, and mothers grieve.

Each name unspooled and softly sewn,
In cloth the woods have spun.
No hands can tear the pattern loose,
No thread will come undone.”

I put Micah’s notebook with me when my father came to pick me up. It felt important, like a piece of Micah himself. I didn’t want to lose it.

As we were driving up the hill away from the school, I saw Micah from a distance. He and Mr.Jackson were behind the school. Micah was being led into the woods. I saw the branches open like arms, welcoming Micah in.

I never saw him again. Not in person, at least.

That night, I dreamt of the woods. I was back there, the same night I had gotten lost. The footsteps behind me, the breath of something terrible wafting down my neck as I marched hopelessly onward with silent tears.

But this time, I turned around. 

I saw an army of silhouettes in the trees. Some old, some young. People I didn’t recognize. 

Their eyes were replaced with stones and wood. Soil and grass spilled from their mouths. Their skin was rotten and bloated. 

The only exception being Micah. He was the one breathing down my neck in my dream. Like the others, his eyes were missing. Only he had no earth, grass, wood or stones to replace his missing physiology.

He grabbed me by the shoulders and screamed at me with a thousand voices. Roots sprouted out of his arms- out of his veins- and dug into my flesh. He, and I with him, began to sink into the ground. The earth enveloped my legs, my torso, my neck. I tasted the dirt as it filled my lungs and covered my body. I woke screaming as the earth sealed over my head.

The search for Micah was brief. No one seemed to care other than me and Katie. 

No one believed me when I accused Mr. Jackson. Why would they? I’d already cried wolf once when I said Katie led me into the forest. I was just one kid with an overactive imagination. Or crazy. Easy for anyone to dismiss.

But I know the truth. They didn’t ignore me because I sounded crazy. They ignored me because I wasn’t supposed to be heard. 

They didn’t dismiss me to protect themselves from fear. 

They did it to protect the forest.
