I am a 23 year old male that lives alone in a decently sized house. It was about 2:30 AM when it first happened. I was asleep in bed with my dog and fish tanks filter making noise like always. I had rolled over causing my right arm to swing to the right side of my bed and felt a woman there she felt skinny but like she had been laying in mud, when I opened my eyes no one was there so I assumed I had a bad dream and thought it was real but man was I wrong. 

A few weeks later I got into bed close to my nightstand with my phone charging, I had reached over when I got a message but felt a hand with very sharp nails grabbing my wrist. The pain I felt when I opened my eyes was worse than when the hand grabbed me, I had multiple marks so deep into my wrist you could see blood trying to ooze out. I put a bandaid on it and thought it was creepy but went back to sleep and when my arm fell off the side of my bed it landed on what felt like a woman’s head. I felt around her head for a minute since my dog had hair that felt the same, when I opened my eyes there was nothing that I could have been feeling. I was creeped out and headed off to work but was tired from being afraid all night. 

I work as a FedEx driver so I’m alone for most of my day other than customers and random stops that I had to deliver to last second. While I was on break around 1:58 PM when it happened. I was sleeping on the floor with a blanket and pillow I usually bring for my lunch and got lunch early that day. I woke up to my boxes and envelopes falling on me. My truck was pretty empty and my area usually has teenagers that play pranks so I thought they had found a way to silently knock off the boxes off my shelves. When I went back to sleep after fixing the area and making sure no one was outside I had felt her again, I felt her ankles. The dripping wet feet, the skin peeling off with just a touch, and the dress. The dress felt like your normal wedding dress but when I opened my eyes I got a small glimpse of what I was touching. Her skin was dark like a bluish purple color her skin was dripping blood and the dress was brown from dirt and mud. This only happened in a small second but I saw it all in broad daylight. I finished my work and hurried home and washed my face. 

I new my dog would keep me company I had a few drinks and remembered I had no work the next day so I got drunk. Now I’ve never had problems while drunk before but I saw her, she was standing like the ring girl but had blonde hair, a dark green face, no hands, and broken legs. I was surprised she could even. I drunkly ran out of the house and here I am now, seeing that horror made me sober up. I have my eyes open but I hear the banging on the shed door. Im scared to blink since I do not know how she works and if she will appear with me when I do. Please help me I don’t know if I can have my eyes open for much longer and I think I just heard my dogs neck snapping
