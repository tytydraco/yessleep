I moved into a new apartment recently. My last one drained my wallet, the rent climbing steadily until I felt crushed beneath the relentless arithmetic of my dwindling savings. I craved something cheaper, a place where I could reclaim some semblance of control over my life. I hadn’t planned to settle on this unit when I first trailed behind the real estate agent, a wiry man with a clipped voice and polished shoes that tapped sharply on the worn hardwood. The building was dated, its corridors dim and tinged with the faint, stale scent of mildew, but then he flung open the door to this apartment. Sunlight poured through a broad window, illuminating a rugged expanse of mountains that stretched across the horizon like a jagged promise. The negotiable price was the final push—a steal in a city that thrived on squeezing tenants dry. I scrawled my name on the lease that afternoon, the scenic mountain view still vivid in my mind’s eye.

For the first few days, life hummed along normally—just my usual rhythm, a quiet routine etched into muscle memory. Out to the office by 11, the morning chill brushing my face as I turned the key in the lock. Back home by 4, the afternoon sun spilling gold across the bare floors and empty walls I hadn’t yet bothered to personalize. The apartment felt like a clean slate, a chance to reset. I unpacked at a leisurely pace, savoring the calm.

A week in, though, something shifted.

Nightmares crept in first—twisted, restless visions that slithered into my sleep. They were disjointed, a collage of unease: a low, buzzing hum, a far-off cry, a fleeting glimpse of something peering from the shadows. I’d wake soaked in sweat, sheets knotted around my legs, my chest heaving as I stared into the dark, pulse racing. Then came the doorbell. Always at midnight, sharp and unyielding, its chime piercing the stillness like a sudden slash. The first night, I bolted upright, heart slamming against my ribs. The second, I lay rigid, ears straining as it rang once and fell silent. By the third, the pattern was undeniable.

At first, I dismissed it as a prank—maybe a restless teenager in the building, or a faulty wire sparking mischief. But night after night, unease gnawed deeper, eroding my flimsy rationalizations. The exactness of it, the unwavering precision—it felt intentional. Someone was behind it. Someone wanted my attention, and the realization sent a cold prickle racing across my skin.

So I waited the next night, perched by the door on a wobbly kitchen chair I’d hauled over. My phone’s faint glow pierced the dark, its pale light washing over my hands as I gripped it, knuckles whitening. The clock inched toward twelve, each second dragging like a held breath, the silence thick and heavy around me.

DING-DONG.

Even braced for it, the sound jolted me. That crisp chime sliced through the silence, a jarring intrusion that spiked my pulse into a wild sprint. The chair groaned beneath me as I shifted, the sound lost in the bell’s lingering echo bouncing off the walls.

I rose, breath unsteady, the air sticking in my throat. My trembling fingers brushed the peephole, its cold metal biting into my skin. I paused, eye hovering just shy of the lens, dread twisting tight in my stomach.

And there it was...

An eye stared back. Black. Featureless. Void. No pupil, no iris—just a glossy, endless depth that seemed to drink in the light. It pressed so close it filled the peephole entirely, an unyielding presence I could almost sense through the wood.

My lungs seized, breath trapped in a mute gasp. Terror and disbelief pinned me in place, my body locked as if cemented to the floor. Then it blinked—slow, deliberate, the lid gliding down and up with a chilling calm that confirmed its reality, its awareness.

I stumbled back, slamming against the door with a thud that shook the frame. My heartbeat thundered in my ears, a deafening torrent that swallowed every other sound.[BREAK]Steeling myself, I leaned in again, my breath misting the peephole’s rim. Every instinct screamed to flee, but I had to see, had to know.

It hadn’t moved. Still staring and watching. That fathomless void fixed on me, as if it could pierce the lens, the door, my very skull, and rummage through my thoughts.

I wanted to call someone—but who? I couldn’t exactly rouse my neighbors at midnight with, “There’s an eye in my peephole,” my voice quivering as I imagined their raised brows and pitying glances. The police? They’d scoff, or worse, cart me off for a psych eval. Instead, I dragged myself to bed, legs leaden, my mind clawing at that slow, unnatural blink. I yanked the blanket tight, a frail barrier against the image seared into me.

You know how your mind replays the last thing you saw, like a stubborn afterimage that won’t fade? That’s what haunted me. Every time my eyes shut, it was there—blinking, methodical and relentless, an endless cycle I couldn’t break. My lids fluttered with the strain of pushing it away.

Somehow, exhaustion overpowered the fear clawing my chest. I slipped into fitful sleep, shallow and restless, pursued by shadows I couldn’t name.

Morning came, groggy and heavy, the light seeping through the curtains in a muted haze. I’d overslept, the clock flashing 10:23 in stark red numerals.

Shaking off the dread, I showered fast, the scalding water prickling my skin as I scrubbed at the night’s residue. I bolted to work, the day a slog of harsh lights and murmured conversations. The long hours sapped me, each task a weight until I could trudge home, craving only food and rest.

I locked the doors tight, every bolt clicked into place with a firm snap. The TV blared, its noise a shield against the silence—a jumble of canned laughter and ad jingles to drown the quiet. Silence breeds fear, and I needed the clamor tonight.

Midway through dinner—a lukewarm heap of pasta that tasted like ash—the screen flickered, a brief hiccup of static.

I froze, fork poised midair.

The eye.

Not in the peephole now. On the TV. It consumed the screen, that same black void gazing out, unblinking at first.

Then it began. Blinking. Its lashes curled long and unnatural, thick and spidery, framing the emptiness. The eyelids gleamed deep, angry red, raw and swollen as if pulsing with silent rage.

I lurched back, the fork clanging to the floor. The room tilted, walls bending in my vision’s edges. My breaths came quick and shallow, scraping my throat.

Then—blackness. A dense, suffocating dark that engulfed me.

I woke drenched in sweat, hands trembling, the sheets coiled around me like bindings. The clock glowed 11:59 PM, its light a dim lifeline in the murk.

That nightmare felt too vivid, too tangible. The eye in the TV… those red eyelids… they lingered, crisp and undeniable.

My gut twisted, a cold certainty taking root. It wasn’t just a dream.

I forced myself from bed, legs shaky beneath me. Despite the terror clawing at me, a raw need to know propelled me forward. I had to see.

I pressed my eye to the peephole, the metal frigid against my skin. My breath caught, clouding the lens.

Midnight hit, the clock’s faint chime lost beneath my hammering pulse.

And the eye was there.

It hadn’t emerged from the elevator, its distant hum absent tonight. It hadn’t approached the door, no steps whispering in the hall.

It was simply there, immediate and impossible.

Blinking—faster now, a staccato beat that churned my stomach.

In that frantic rhythm, I saw them. Red eyelids, vivid and furious, flashing with each blink.

Just like my nightmare.

The truth sank in, choking my breath. My mind screamed it meant something—a link, a message I couldn’t decipher.

I recoiled, heart hammering so fiercely I felt it in my throat. Something was wrong. My own eyes—they were blinking too, rapid and wild.

Frantic and Uncontrolled.

The room blurred as I staggered to my bedroom, vision stuttering like a broken reel, shapes smearing into streaks of shadow and light.

**Blink. Blink. Blink.**

It wouldn’t stop.

It wouldn’t stop.

That night, sleep evaded me, an elusive ghost I couldn’t catch. Work was impossible, the idea of facing daylight absurd.

I just kept blinking, my lids twitching in a rhythm I couldn’t halt.

Too frightened and paranoid before, I hadn’t grasped what was happening, my thoughts too fractured to see the thread. But now, accepting my fate, I focused on the blinks. Each one carried images, flashing in sequence like a film unspooling in my skull.

The first was hazy—a silhouette, likely a woman, her form soft and rounded against a foggy void. Another blink, and a man stood beside her, faintly clearer. Her shape alone marked her as female, a slender shadow; his clothes showed—dark fabric, heavy, maybe a coat—though his face stayed hidden, a featureless blur.

Then—nothing. Darkness swallowed everything, a thick, unyielding black. My eyelids fused shut, unyielding despite my clawing efforts, nails scraping at my face in blind desperation.

Two days now, and fear consumes me, a living weight in my chest. My eyes remain glued, sealed as if bound by invisible thread. Only my mental map of the house keeps me alive—each step a cautious shuffle, hands grazing walls, counting turns to find water, food, the sink.

Something whispers my eyes will open again, a quiet instinct flickering in the void. I don’t know when, the uncertainty a pressure that grows with each hour.

This darkness devours me, a slow unraveling of my mind. But I’m ready for the next blinking session, braced for whatever it might reveal.
