I must begin this continuation with an apology. Due to the length of the event being recollected, I will be unable to conclude it in this transcript. With any luck, I should need only one more transcript before I have fully documented the event. 

For those who either have not seen or do not remember the events leading up to this operation, I have included a link to it here:

TRANSCRIPT 1 - https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/i5pPVdg7vU

These are the details surrounding the opening hours of the Search and Rescue mission. 

Our official arrival on site was at 0730 hours on September 4, 2017. As had been instructed of them, our pilots had flown just beyond the one mile mark away from the compound, and hovered some 50 feet off the ground. As the craft came to a halt, Sticky was quick to slide open the door on the chopper’s side, flooding the inside with a sudden burst of sunlight. Even from inside, I could feel the oppressive desert heat slam into my face like a wall. 

Avalon was the first to move, dropping the thick nylon rope over the edge of the helicopter. I watched as the dim green line unfurled and came to a sudden stop on the sand below as I tried to calm my ever increasing heartbeat. 

“Rope’s secure! Everybody out!” I heard Avalon shout over the near all encompassing beat of the helicopter blades. Without a word, I slung my SAW over my shoulder and took firm hold of the rope before leaping from the helicopter, wrapping myself tightly around it as I began my descent. I could still hear the whipping of the blades as I slammed onto the ground, got down on one knee and aimed my weapon forward, scanning the horizon for threats. 

One by one, the rest of my team fast roped on site, just behind my periphery. My only indication they’d made safe landfall was the soft thuds of their boots landing beside me, just barely audible over the helicopter. There were still no threats I could see to my front, and, likely due to distance, no sight of our sister fireteam or their helicopter. They were, after all, almost two miles out from us. Only the barely perceivable frame of the hastily put together outpost was visible amid the distorting and warbled view of the desert. 

“Hermes, this is Midas-4, be advised we have boots on the ground and are preparing to move in on the target location, what’s your status, over?” I heard a new, noticeably younger voice say over the radio. While I hadn’t associated him with the callsign of Midas-4 yet, I did remember Bucky being assigned as the communications sergeant for the mission. It took only a few seconds for Lucky to respond to him, half shouting to be heard over the now gradually quieting helicopter. 

“Midas, this is Hermes-5, Hermes has successfully deployed and will begin moving out shortly, over.” By now the helicopter’s speed has created enough distance that world had mostly returned to silence, and I resisted the urge to turn behind me and watch it leave. 

“Midas copies, Hermes-5. Be advised, Midas-3 and Midas-5 have been assigned to overwatch and will NOT be joining us at the compound. Midas will be taking extra care while clearing the compound and may fall behind you, over.” I couldn’t help but find that odd, but remained silent. 

“Copy that, Midas, we’ll keep you posted on our progress, over.” Lucky replied. 

“Midas copies all, good luck gentlemen. Out.” With the conversation over, I turned to look behind me at the rest of my team, and saw Sticky and Avalon to my right, both wielding MK 18s as Sticky’s Mossberg dangled from a strap on his back. 

“That’s a lotta blind spots to be covering with just three people, Lieutenant.” I commented. Sticky didn’t turn towards me, but did shake his head in response. 

“Not the call I would have made, but I’m sure Big Eye has his reasons. Eyes forward, Oculus.” Doing as I was told, I got up and stepped slightly to the right, keeping my aim focused on the compound, and my view on the land surrounding it. 

“I got point, everyone else fall in behind me, you know your places. Stay frosty, boys.”  Our marching order was Sticky up front due to his shotgun in case of breaching, followed by Avalon as our No. 1 rifleman. Borat fell in behind him, just in case one of our first two guys took a hit, with me directly behind him for suppressive fire. Lucky held up the rear with his under mounted grenade launcher. 

I remember the march to the compound was slow and hot. The ground itself was solid, and seemed mostly comprised of a deep brown rock with only a thin layer of sand over it. Trekking through it wasn’t much challenge at all, it was just the heat that was so unbearable. Before they were destroyed, I remember one of the after action reports claimed it was 112 degrees Fahrenheit that day. Having marched through it for almost a half hour just to reach the compound, I certainly believe that number. 

The march itself was quiet and uneventful, which for us was a good thing. The last thing any of us needed was something unexpected shooting at us. The terrain, being mostly flat save for the occasional sand dune or rock outcropping, was mostly ineffectual for setting up ambushes or traps in the event the area wasn’t clear like we had suspected. Mostly, but not entirely. I still doubted Lucky’s PMC theory, but outright dismissing it was just as stupid as believing it whole heartedly.

A comfortable silence fell over the fireteam as we made our way forward, and we were a little less than quarter mile out before the silence was broken. 

“Hermes, this is Midas-4, Midas-3 and Midas-5 have broken off to set up an overwatch at a rock outcropping approximately 400 meters from the compound, acknowledge, over.” Midas 3 and 5, those were Fruity and Black Eye, I thought. That left Big Eye himself, Nutty, and Bucky for Midas. Without missing a beat, Lucky responded. 

“Hermes acknowledges Midas-4, over.” 

“Nothing more to report, Hemes. Out.” 

I still wasn’t sure it was a good idea for Midas to reduce themselves to just three men to clear out a compound, even with another team taking half of the structures inside. While there technically wasn’t a defined limit for room clear, odds improved significantly with teams of four or more. Still, room clearing could be completed by even a single operator if they knew what they were doing, and these guys had received the same training I had. I only hoped they wouldn’t come to regret losing two of their guys. 

By the time we arrived at the compound, it was just past 0800 hours. The entire outpost was assembled in a cube like formation, with a number of grey and white tents set up in rows surrounding a large, deep green tarp in the compound’s center. Each one looked no larger than twenty feet wide and roughly eight feet tall, with maybe three or four tents to any given row. The center green tarp was noticeably taller that the rest, standing maybe four to five feet higher if I were to hazard a guess, and while I couldn’t see how wide it was at the time, I knew immediately that it was likely twice as big, if not larger, than the white ones surrounding it. 

Sticky stopped in place and held up a hand for us to halt as we approached, an order we all complied with. He took a minute to pan over the tents, scanning the immediate area for threats. When he was satisfied there were none, he lowered his hand and turned to look back at us. 

“Lucky, inform Midas that we’ve arrived at the compound, everyone else stand by.”  Without looking back, I heard Lucky respond. 

“Midas, this is Hermes-5, we have arrived at the target location and are standing by, what is your status, over?” Silence again reigned for a brief time before the radio sparked back to life. 

“Hermes this is Midas-4, we are in position. We will begin clearing momentarily. Begin your own clearing operation and keep an eye out for any outpost personnel, over.”

“Hermes acknowledges, out.” In front of me, I could see Borat briefly look to the left, presumably at one of the sand hills enclosing us inside.

“Waiting on your go, Lieutenant.” Lucky said. Even from my position I could see Sticky nod and begin moving forward, leading each of us to the leftmost tent in the first row. Pausing for brief moment by the first path leading into the compound, Sticky glanced just beyond it, then began to advance down it with his weapon extended. The rest of us followed closely behind and followed suit when our lieutenant carefully stacked up to the door, or rather the static white flap that served as the door. I noticed that the flap, despite having a zipper to keep it closed, was completely open. 

At this point, Avalon carefully maneuvered around Sticky and moved ahead of him, with Borat taking his place directly behind Sticky. 

“Go.” Was all Sticky said, and Avalon nodded. With peak efficiency, Avalon raised his weapon and entered the tent on the right side as Sticky followed him going left, and Borat went center. After the door was clear, I followed behind him, moving as close to the right as I could and raising my SAW between Avalon and Borat’s lines of sight. 

The interior of the tent had a plain white tarp covering the ground. In my immediate line of sight I could see what looked to be four large several gallon plastic containers of water, one completely empty, one half full, and the other two seemingly untouched. There was not a single person inside. After a moment, I heard Sticky call out;

“Clear.” 

Looking around a bit now that the tent had been secured, I realized that this tent seemed to be a provisions area. In the left corner where Lucky observed was what looked to be several stacks of MRE boxes, and more water containers. By Avalon was another stack of boxes also containing MREs. It looked like enough food and water to last a good sized group for weeks. 

“How long do think they planned on staying here?” Asked Lucky as he plucked one of the food bags from an open box.  

“Clearly longer than they actually did.” I chirped back, wiping a layer of sweat from my brow. I heard Lucky stifle a chuckle as he tossed the bag back. 

“I hear that.” 

“Cut the chatter, you two. Lucky, inform Midas we have cleared the first tent and are moving to secure the rest. Everyone else, fall in with me.” Sticky ordered. 

The remaining tents in the first row went almost exactly the same as the initial clear. Perfect execution, no unusual details, confirmation with Midas, then moving on to the next one. All in all we cleared what looked to be an area dedicated to pumping underground water, a makeshift cafeteria tent, and what looked to be the public craphouse on the outer edge.

The second row of tents, in comparison to the first, all seemed uniform with one another. These contained hastily prepared generators and power strips that housed various laptops and science equipment I did not recognize. There was something else about them that gave all of us pause, however. In the first tents, there was no real indication that anything had happened, everything was neat tidy, and well kept. That wasn’t the case with this second row at all. 

Even with how quickly we were clearing these tents, we could tell the interiors were distinctively more lived in, and that something had happened. Half opened journals laid scattered at various stations, some metal chairs stood upright while others looked knocked over. One of the laptops even looked to be halfway through a lab report of some kind before just cutting off. Most alarmingly, one of the chairs in the second tent looked almost caved in, like someone had used it as a weapon against someone or something.

None of us had doubted the idea that something had happened to the staff here, but those tents solidified the idea that whatever went on, the staff didn’t go willingly. That confirmation only strengthened when we cleared the green tent in the center of the compound. 

We linked up with Midas before proceeding as normal towards the central tent. The plan was for Midas to enter first from the northern entrance, then follow up from the south to clear the tent more efficiently. As we approached, however, I noticed something distinctly different even before we entered. Every other tent in the outpost had been dead quiet, without even so much of the hum of idle electrical equipment. As we began to stack up beside the large green tarp however, I heard what sounded like a radio broadcasting something. Worse, I recognized it. 

A low metallic ringing, a strange and bizarre amalgamation of knocking, chirping insects and radio searching, and an odd pinging similar to that of sonar. This time the sonar was deeper, more resonant, sounding almost like an underwater church bell. 

“Anybody else hearing that?” I asked.

“We hear it sergeant, we all hear it.” Replied Sticky. 

“Think there’s somebody in there trying to get our attention?” Asked Borat, taking a second to peek just over Avalon’s shoulder at the tent flap before falling back in line. 

“No, we’d have heard them by now or they’d have seen us by now.” Sticky said back. I suspect we would have had more to say, if we didn’t hear the muffled voice of Big Eye from inside the tent say;

“Sweet mother of God…” I glanced back at Lucky and gave a concerned look, but he had nothing for me, just a shake of the head and the shrug of his shoulders. 

“Hermes, get in here and hold your fire.” Came the captain’s voice again. Looking over to Sticky, I saw him give the go ahead as he lowered his weapon ever so slightly and entered the tent in standard breach formation, followed by the rest of us. 

 The interior of the tent was some sort of central research hub with bizarre looking machinery and computers I couldn’t even begin to describe. Light green tarps hung from the ceiling and separated the entire base into three sections to the left, right, and middle. Across from us was the three man team of Big Eye, Nutty, and Bucky. Had that been all that was inside, maybe I could have forgotten all about this. 

But there was more, so much more. 

The first thing we noticed was the temperature. During our sweep of every other tent in the compound, the air felt just as hot inside as it did on the outside, if not slightly warmer. This central tent was colder, far colder. Where before I had been sweating and borderline swimming in my kit, I now felt a shiver running through my body. Honestly, I may have found it refreshing had it not been so jarring.

The second was the ground, stained in deep red, almost dark brown splatters. Spent shell casings of small caliber fire and shotgun shells littered the ground beside them. In one small corner I could see  upwards of ten or twelve spent rounds before more splatters coated the walls of the tent. All through the air I could smell something faintly metallic, a scent all too familiar to anyone that’s suffered a cut or similar injury. As horrifying as what we were seeing and feeling was, it was what was missing that disturbed me the most.

There were no bodies anywhere. No rotting or decaying scent from corpses left out in the sun, there didn’t even seem to be any visible bullet holes in the tent. We were witnessing something straight out of a one sided mass slaughter, and there were wasn’t even a single shard of fractured bone on the ground. Just spilled blood, spent ammunition, and some drag marks. 

For a time, none of us spoke or acknowledged what we were seeing, just took it in and tried to make sense of it. Clearly, the outpost personnel had made some sort of stand here against something, but who, or what? What could have killed them and left such a bizarre aftermath? There was no blood leading into the tent, no signs of a struggle outside of the physical evidence we were seeing, everything about the viscera seemed wrong. And why was it so unbearably cold? 

“What in God’s name happened here?” I finally asked as I tried to keep my hands from trembling. 

“I don’t think God had anything to do with this, Oculus…” Replied Borat as he looked around the tent. Almost numbly I looked up and focused on Midas, hoping to see how they were handling this. Big Eye was kneeling and observing one of the rounds, Bucky seemed to let his weapon dangle and stepped carefully and hesitantly as he took pictures with a camera for intelligence gathering, and Nutty knelt by the northern tent flap, his Mk 18 trained on it for anyone entering.

All the while, the same radio frequency played over and over from somewhere in the tent. Every so often, the sonar blips would stop, leaving only the ringing and strange amalgamation noise before starting up again. I wondered why this frequency seemed to repeat when according to our debrief, both previous instances simply cut off after a certain point. Subconsciously I began to count the blips as they returned, tallying thirteen before they fell silent again. 

“Alright.” Big Eye said suddenly as he stood back up and focused his gaze on Sticky, who was currently inspecting one of the spent shells and looking over his own shotgun. 

“Central area looks clear, but there’s still the two side sections. Lieutenant, take your team and check the dude on your right, Midas will secure the other.” He ordered. It took Sticky a second to register what Big Eye had said, but he still nodded and slid his shotgun back over his shoulder before giving us the universal sign of regrouping. Even as we fell in, however, I felt doubts build up in my head. 

This was a bloodbath, a pure, unadulterated bloodbath, and somehow we still hadn’t found anyone. Nobody, despite the fact that there was no way in or out of here except via helicopter, despite how massive of an undertaking whatever this was would have had to be, and despite the fact this was a site with the United States military backing it and in constant communication. This was not possible, it could not be possible. 

I was still hand lost in through as we approached the right side of the tent, and watched as Avalon carefully entered. The sonar was back again, and I counted as the rest of my team slowly entered. Again I counted thirteen blips before ringing and the amalgamation were all that was left. 

The right side of the tent was noticeably smaller than its main chamber, but was otherwise similar to the scene in the center, complete with the dried blood on the floor and even some of the machines. Unlike before, however, I recognized at least one of these as a radio. From the sounds of, this was the radio broadcasting the signal. 

“Avalon, get a recording of that signal then shut it down.” Sticky ordered. As I stepped out of the chamber to make room for Avalon, a strange thought came to me. 

“Lieutenant? How many people were assigned to this base, again?” Sticky rested his weapon across his chest and pointed it down as he turned to face me, a puzzled look on his face.

“Ten researchers and three security guards, why?” My heart sank as I had my worries more or less confirmed, or at least not seem as ridiculous. 

“Because that frequency has been blipping thirteen times before resetting.”  Sticky’s eyes furrowed in thought as he looked back towards the central chamber. In my periphery I could see Borat lowering his weapon too as he glanced behind him. 

“So, what’s that mean? That it’s some kinda SOS?” I heard Avalon ask from beside me. 

“Or a tally list.” Borat interjected as he turned back to us. Now there was an idea that frightened me. 

“Assuming that the blips mean anything at all, guys, come on.” Said Lucky as I saw him kneel just outside the chamber and rest his carbine against his knee. 

“Lucky, you gotta admit something weird is going on here, man.” I tried to say. He rolled his eyes and shook his head. 

“Yeah, something weird, not something unexplainable, let’s try and keep our heads on, alright? Lieutenant, back me up here.” Sticky just kept his head down, clearly lost in thought. 

“Sir?” I asked. 

“I don’t know. I don’t know what it means.” He eventually said, defeated. Before any of us could say anything else, we heard the voice of Big Eye call out to us. 

“Hermes, get over here, we have something!” 

As we approached the now open tarp, we saw that what Midas had was what looked to be a massive, almost ten foot wide fissure in the Earth. The edges of the hole seemed to fray and almost splinter, as if it had been blasted open from below or punched through. The fissure lead to what looked like a deep tunnel that seemed to slant ever so slightly downwards, and even at a glance I could tell it was wide and tall enough for two men to stand in and walk side by side comfortably. We could see maybe ten feet before the tunnel went pitch black. 

Due to the time of day we hadn’t been outfitted with night vision, but part of our kits include tactical flashlights capable of illuminating out to 250 meters, or around 800 feet. Taking my flashlight, I carefully attached it to a connecting piece on my helmet and looked up as I turned it on. The light revealed the edges of the tunnel, and to my horror there were more traces of dark red splatters along its walls, some of them looking like they were streaking along the ceiling. 

“Dear God…” I heard Borat whisper. Even with how far the flashlight reached, we couldn’t see how far down the tunnel lead. 

“What the hell made this?” I heard an unfamiliar voice ask, one I could only assume was Nutty. 

“I don’t know, sure as heck doesn’t look man made.” I replied. 

“Should we call this in?” I heard Bucky ask as he turned to face the captain. Before he could reply, we all heard something that froze us to our cores, or at least me to mine. 

Ever so faintly, we could hear voices screaming in the tunnel, and the sound of something squelching.
