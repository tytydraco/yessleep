I don't usually tell strangers my profession but unfortunately it's integral to my story here. So lets rip off the band-aid nice and quickly... 3... 2... 1...

I'm an influencer.

How many of you just rolled your eyes at that? How many points did I go down in your estimation the second I said those words? It's okay, you can tell me. I don't really mind anymore, I mean it's not like I'm going to live for much longer anyway. Oh, but I'll get to that later.

This isn't the job I thought I'd have ten years ago. At school I was breezing through my exams, working on little coding projects for fun and forming very extensive plan for how I was going to achieve the career I wanted. I managed to get onto the fiercely competitive degree course that I applied for and whilst I suddenly wasn't 'breezing' through anything anymore, I had a strong enough work ethic to rise to the challenge. I finished the course with good grades and whilst I didn't get onto the masters program I'd hoped for, I did manage to snag my second choice. Next up I finished my masters, sent out some applications and then finally...

Nothing.

None of the fancy jobs I applied for wanted me. I applied over and over and I did everything that I was *meant* to be doing but nothing ever came of it. Frustratingly, I couldn't even pin down what I was missing. It would have been easy to assume that if I'd gotten onto the slightly better master's programme I'd have what I wanted by now but Thea was on the programme with me and she walked into one of the jobs I applied for. I'd tried gently probing her for the reason she succeeded where I failed but as best as I can tell we really aren't that different from one another on paper. She was just luckier than me.

I ended up in a job that paid the bills but wouldn't really improve my CV in the eyes of the big tech roles I coveted. I'd never gone viral then I probably worked my way slowly up the ladder, applying to jobs I wanted and jobs I didn't want but were at least realistic. Then maybe half way through my thirties I'd have given up applying for the different iterations of my dream job and just settled into my depressing existence. Or who knows, maybe I'd end up transferred to a different country and falling in love not just with the hot bartender across the street but also with the culture and way of life. Given that none of these things have any chance of happening anymore it's almost nice to dream.

As it is, one of my posts did go viral. I don't know how much I need to be hiding who I am right now so all I'm going to say is that I made a post talking about a new feature in a product or service that our company provided that just so happened to catch a lot of people's attention. Basically this feature was a complete shitshow but did technically have a workaround. Having known all of this before the feature was even released, I was able to put out a happy, smiley explanation of how to avoid the key problems the second it made it out to the general public. This was enough to make the video popular and a few accidental little quirks about the way it was shot made it spread even further. The internet judged me to be charismatic and pretty enough to be worth their attention and the rest is history.

I neither loved nor hated the influencer life and if yesterday had never happened then I'd probably have stuck with it until public opinion moved on to someone else and I moved to back to a slightly different version of my old job. As it is, yesterday I was eating a sandwich and putting some final touches on the last review I'd written when my phone buzzed with a message and everything went to hell.

*"We should hang out tonight."* Thea messaged.

There becomes a point in your twenties where I think everyone has a friend or two who are only around because cutting them off would be slightly more effort. Thea was mine. I took another bite of my sandwich and then replied.

*"Sorry, I'm really busy tonight. Maybe some other time."*

My phone buzzed again before I'd even had chance to put it down.

*"That's a shame. I have something that could really help your little side project."*

Thea knows that being an influencer is my full time job at this point but never avoids an opportunity to belittle it. I'd told myself that next time she did this I'd call her out but unfortunately for me, Thea rarely lies to me. If she was saying that she had something helpful then the chances were incredibly high that she actually did. I sighed with frustration as I typed out my reply and hit send.

*"You know what, I can shuffle things about if you really want to meet up."*

The response was fast enough I suspect it was written before my message had even sent.

*"Is this just because I said I have something for you?"*

Obviously.

*"No, it's just that you're right - we haven't hung out in ages. Where were you thinking?"*

That evening I went to the bar Thea had suggested with about as much enthusiasm as I'd climb into a vat of boiling oil. We made a normal amount of small talk with subtle jabs given from both sides when finally, *finally,* Thea moved onto the main event.

"No, I'm not so much on the working on making AI side of things as the working on identifying side. That's actually what I wanted to talk to you about - we've made something really interesting.."

"Okay?"

"We can identify bots. All of them. Whether it's a post written by chatgpt or a bot that's a follower online or a piece of art or anything. Give it a month or two and nobody on the internet will have any question whether anybody at all online is a human or not."

*Oh, crap.*

If you feel like judging me for having some less than human followers then it seems useful to point out that everyone in my world does. It's simple psychology - people want something more when they think others are already enjoying it. Even celebrities who would have no issue grabbing truly incredible amounts of followers usually have some fake ones mixed in there so that it looked like their initial move to a social media platform was more sensationalised than it was or to counter a loss of followers after some bad PR or to add more likes and comments to a post about their brand of perfume or whatever. To Thea though, this was just more proof that my success was fake and superficial.

"So you're just here to tell me that my numbers are going to take a hit? If you launch something like that then everyone's will and that's still not exactly the 'help' you promised."

Thea laughed and I hated how much she was enjoying this.

"No, silly. I actually have the solution right here with me. A way to create more human followers."

"You mean followers that will still look human?"

She shook her head and removed something small from her purse.

"No, actual humans."

Thea placed a small, plastic object onto the table between us - a purple button with 'follow me' written in a simple sanserif font. Now it was my time to laugh.

"Bullshit."

"I'm completely serious. And I'll sell it to you."

Her face gave nothing away. With the benefit of hindsight there was a strange sort of intensity to the way that she was looking at me but there was no way I could've known why that was.

"How much are you selling it for?"

"Five hundred."

"O-kay... and how many followers would that get me?"

"There isn't an upper limit. As much as you press it. The longer you hold it down the faster it finds you new followers so theoretically you could get everyone online following you before the week's even out."

I sighed.

"Look, I'm not stupid enough to think this button can get me real people. I want to be clear about that. But I don't even know that it can get me bots that your new methods won't be able to track. Why should I trust you?"

Thea picked up my phone and pressed a few buttons. My own phone buzzed in response.

"I've emailed you the part of the research I was involved with," she explained, "it isn't all of it but it's some. Even if you don't understand it well enough to be convinced, the body of the email clarifies that the device I'm selling you will acquire you accounts that our software won't be able to track. So if I'm lying to you then it's just gone from a trick to actual fraud. We need initial user feedback that can be trusted to keep their mouths shut and you need to look like a legitimate online prescence. This way we both win."

Well, I suppose this post here means that she was wrong to trust me to keep my mouth shut but in my defense Thea was lying too. She just wasn't lying about the parts I expected her to be.

I paid for the cheap feeling button and left the bar without even finishing my drink.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I pressed the button a couple of times that night. If it did have an effect then it was small and delayed but given that both presses were just short little clicks that didn't necessarily mean I'd been scammed. I was saving the real test for when I uploaded my next review video. I'd scheduled it to go up the next morning and after a couple of my legitimate followers had shared it I decided to test the gadget for real.

Again, the effect wasn't instant. It didn't suddenly add a couple of hundred followers all in one go. But followers were definitely quite slowly being added from somewhere. It wasn't an impossible amount and it could have been that I'd gotten lucky and had a higher than expected level of engagement but for some reason I didn't really believe that. If this device was actually legitimate then Thea could definitely have charged me more for it. I wondered if perhaps her disdain for my liefstyle had finally worked against her and she'd simply assumed that I wouldn't be able to pay her a higher sum.

I took the button with me when I went down the road to get coffee. One more press couldn't hurt, I told myself after I'd sat down. Some of my 'new followers' had shared my last post by now so a quick click would make sense and additionally I should really be trying to get a sense of how many followers I'd get per length of click and how long it'd take them to finish turning up. I clicked it quickly and-

"Hey!" I yelled.

The man who'd just knocked into me apologised and walked to his seat. Thinking back on it, I can remember his friend pulling him away from me. I was just too angry to notice at the time. I stood up to go and get some napkins only to realise that someone else was already walking towards me with a stack of them.

"Here." the barista said with a smile, "I'll make you another coffee too. On the house, obviously."

I cleaned myself back up and only then did it occur to me to check on the button. It had gotten soaked. Shit. I glared passive aggressively at the man who had jostled me but he was facing away from me now. There wasn't even any excuse for him to have knocked me - there was *plenty* of space behind me for him and his friend to get past without even needing to risk brushing against me, let alone this.

"I assumed it'd be the same again," the returning barista said, "I've never seen you order anything else."

I nodded in thanks but for some reason it still took her a second to leave. I was almost about to ask her if everything was okay when she blurted something out.

"Would you like to go out sometime?"

"Er, yeah. That sounds great."

I pulled out my phone to get her number.

"I'm free after my shift tonight actually." she suggested.

Again, I agreed. Maybe I should have seen that eagerness as odd, if nothing else, but I don't really date much. My day was going suprisingly well.

&#x200B;

\------

&#x200B;

Back at home I had five different outfit choices sprawled out on the bed in front of me. I hadn't dated in over a month if we're counting one night stands and embarassingly longer than that if we aren't and I'd honestly forgotten how happy the prospect of a first date can make you feel. I didn't care that I my favourite skirt had somehow gone walkabout, I actually enjoyed putting my makeup on instead of the mechanical routine before filming myself and I couldn't even smell the weird mould odour that had been plaguing my bedroom since I first moved in.

I finished getting ready a good hour before I actually had to meet the barista, whose name I now knew was Izzy. I initially decided to walk in the local park in the hope that a stroll would get rid of the worst of my nerves but on seeing just how dark the park was I decided to give it a miss. Instead I sat in a competing coffee shop just across the road from where Izzy worked. The only table that was free was near the window and I'd been so worried that she might see me from across the road and decide that I was a total stalker. That's pretty funny now. What's the phrase, "if we don't cry about it, we'll laugh?" Something like that. And if I can bring myself to stop fucking sobbing for just a few minutes then I'm sure that I'll manage at least one chuckle at the painful irony of me sat in a cafe being so very worried that Izzy might be scared that *I* was too obsessed with *her.*

&#x200B;

\------

&#x200B;

The restaurant that Izzy took me to wasn't amazing but I generally find that a date in a mediocre restaurant is better than one in a similarly underwhelming bar. With a restaurant the music is quiet enough that you can hear your date talk, the lighting is bright enough that you can see them well enough to see if your jokes are landing or if they might be lying about something and as an added bonus, there's food. In the place we ended up the food was fairly tasteless and the lighting was weirdly dim but there was barely any music and the company was really quite lovely.

"So, do you do this often?" I asked with a smile, "Impulsive dates with people buying coffee from you?"

Izzy shook her head.

"I'm usually an overthinker, if you can believe it!" She then gave a cheeky smirk and added, "Maybe I just felt so sorry for you for getting coffee all over you that I felt you deserved a date..."

"Then I should get coffee poured on me more often!"

We laughed and I asked her how-

No, I don't want to do this anymore. It feels exploitative. I know what's going to happen to me and even though it is so much worse than anything that will happen to her that doesn't change the fact that none of what happened tonight has been her fault. Even if she doesn't get charged with anything, she's still not going to understand why she behaved the way she did.

So I'm only going to summarise the rest of the date in brief. Our meal was so enjoyable that we headed to a bar after dessert. Izzy then asked to come back to my place and whilst on a lot of nights that would have sounded like an excellent idea on that particular night I had personal reasons for wanting to end the evening there. I declined but told her I definitely wanted to see her again soon.

"No, come on." Izzy said but something about her expression made her feel more threatening than she did moments ago.

I stepped back and that's when she went as if to grab me. A healthy dose of both paranoia and self defense classes meant that my automatic response to bring my knee sharply up into her abdomen was as swift as it was forceful. The second I saw that she was too hurt to be an immediate threat I turned on my heels and ran to get away. I knew where there'd be taxis waiting near other bars nearby. I knew that it would be sensible to get home first and wonder what the hell had happened later.

When I replay the incident in my head I can see that she wasn't trying to grab me exactly. Izzy had been trying to place as much of her wrist against me as she could but even though she was close enough for her skin to be against mine, she never closed her grasp. She just wanted to be near me. This inner replay also shows me her expression and just how *confused* she was at what she was doing. I hope that she ends up realising that it wasn't her. She deserves that much.

The taxi dropped me off at the end of my road and I saw my landlord out walking two of his three dogs. I was initially glad that he was there, the streetlights were dimmer than usual and the dose of adrenaline I'd gotten earlier was telling me that a dark, empty street was very unsafe. Some people barely talk to their landlord but his almost constant dogwalking means that I've run into him several times. He's nice enough. Odd, but nice. The few brief chats I've had with him have shown that he has an enthusiasm for technology that is matched only by a frankly concerning lack of understanding but I've never had a real issue with him.

"Hello Amy!" Sam said brightly.

"Hi Sam," I said and when he started to walk next to me I added, "I'm sorry, I can't really talk right now."

"You should invite me in."

The line was delivered clumsily. On another day maybe I'd have been a moron and assumed he needed to come in for an actual reasonn related to me renting from him but with what had just happened and the way he spoke I just ran home. Slammed the door behind me. Locked it. Realised that as a landlord he had a key and shoved the heaviest thing I could find in front of it. Ran into the bathroom and locked *that* door too for good measure. When I heard Sam reach the door and bang on it I pulled my phone out of my pocket to call the police.

I never called them. The first distraction was a private message from a complete stranger saying he'd booked a flight to come see me and that he couldn't wait. He'd figured out my address "from the clues I'd left" for him. I've never given my address out to my followers through clues or anything else but whilst he hadn't quite gotten it right he was far too close for comfort. My instinct was to message him telling him not to under any circumstances come and fly to see me but for some reason my ability to send any messages had been frozen. 

A new message popped up. A message from someone who certainly was not a stranger.

"I'm sorry I made them follow you." the message from Thea read, "I'm sorry for all of this. It wasn't personal."

I hadn't put together the little button that Thea had given me and tonight's bizzare happenings. How could I have? The idea that a button that looks like it should come in a Happy Meal could somehow cause me to develop stalkers is crazy and at that point in the night I hadn't even really linked together the weird things that had been happening as any more than independent incidents. A look on the app I use to track my social media engagement across platforms showed me that my follower count had gone through the roof to a truly unrealistic level. That would probably be why one of the platforms had frozen me. Given how little I actually used the button, my best guess is that the spilled coffee broke it in such a way that it felt like it was constantly being pressed.

"I knew you'd use it but it isn't out of spite. I wouldn't have marked you for death if there was no other choice."

I tried to call Thea but she wouldn't pick up. There was somebody new joining my landlord to bang on my door now, a voice that I couldn't recognise.

"Tell me what you did or I'm calling the police." I messaged Thea.

I intended to call the police either way but I needed to know what Thea had done.

"You can call them but at least some of them will act the same way that you've seen from other people. I've seen your follower count and some of the things people have commented on your content online. The technology in the button is called Sirensong. I stole it from work."

It was getting increasingly hard for me to focus on the screen as Thea typed away. I thought the way it had blurred and dimmed was due to my own panic. I suppose that could've been part of it.

"I really was looking into recognising AI at one point," Thea continued, "but not for any company you'd have heard of. I don't think you have enough time for me to try to explain it properly but they'd found an energy only present on messages, content and accounts from real humans. Bots don't have it. Our little in-house tests confirmed that and the only data we received either showed this energy to be present or absent.

The problem was when we used Sirensong to get more traffic to our accounts. The idea was just to get more data, we weren't expecting to find anything strange. We didn't know there were accounts out there with a different energy. Corrupted, even. How could we have known that?"

There was a new voice at the door. Izzy. How had she even found me? It didn't matter now.

"We looked at this third energy online and found that it was drawn to popular accounts just like the humans and the bots. But if the human they were following died then they instantly unfollowed. Not just 'as soon as the news broke' but before anyone who wasn't personally involved could have even known. Phil was my coworker on the project and together we combed through reports of the last days. Everyone had reported losing their senses or things seeming less vibrant. Things that could absolutely be attributed to many illnesses and drugs.

Phil had used Sirensong more than me. I remember that once we'd read something like the fifth similar report he ran off to throw up. He'd had the same symptoms we were reading about and even though I kept quiet, so had I. We started looking for a solution."

Me. I was the solution. With a sinking feelign I became sickeningly aware of every time tonight that one of my senses hadn't picked up on a stimulus as strongly as I'd expected it to. I was already being targeted.

"We looked at the data of accounts that had a lot of these corrupted followers but that the followers had left. We realised that if a new account gained popularity somewhere physically nearby then these things would be distracted by the more attractive prey. Phil and I debated what to do with the information. Our company deals with strange things all of the time so Phil was optimistic that they'd be able to solve this.

Phil died three days ago so he isn't optimistic anymore. I stole Sirensong as soon as I found out. I just needed to create more attractive prey."

Her explanation of what was going to happen to me should have been the worst thing that Thea said. Instead, I'm more haunted by the next message she sent.

"I only picked you because I needed someone that I knew would press that button. You'd have done the same."

I want to say I wouldn't have. I want to think that in Thea's place I'd have been the Phil of the situation and would have waited in hope of a reasonable solution. I want to think I'd have done the right thing. 

Instead, I know that she's right. In a few minutes time either my house will be flooded by people desparate to be close to me or my life and senses completely away and despite all of that, I don't even get the luxury of thinking that the person who did this to me is truly evil. Even now, if I could pass this along to one of you then I'd do that in an instant.

But I can't and so here lies Amy -- finally dying with the popularity she wanted in life.
