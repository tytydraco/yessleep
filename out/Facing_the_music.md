My mother never wanted me to be musical.

That was the one thing she was dead set against, in fact. Even when I was just a little girl, I was painfully aware of it. I can't remember her ever having any kind of music around the house, even the radio. She could barely even bear to hear me sing. She would frown and tell me curtly, to be quiet. And that was about the only thing she ever got me in trouble for, for she did love me. But, at the same time, she always remained kind of - distant.

Needless to say, she completely discouraged me from taking any music lessons when I grew older. Even just very basic lessons in piano at primary school, or whatever. This was disappointing to me.

'You don't need it, Lia', she would tell me.

As I grew still older, I thought I was beginning to understand her better. She was a single mum and we were not that well off, so of course, I realised, she didn't want to waste money on unnecessary things like music lessons. Also, she wanted to encourage me to focus on practical things so I could eventually settle on a good, solid, money-making career.

And, maybe, she didn't want me to follow in my father's footsteps.

My father, who died just before I was born, had been very musical, I came to learn. Extremely proficient in guitar, piano, singing, he'd been a music teacher. But then he'd become ill, seriously ill, and died young. I thought maybe it was just too painful for her to think I might turn out the same way.

Especially the dying young part. She was very vague as just what he had died of, though. I could see it was too hard for her to talk about it, so I left off asking. And, in deference to her wishes, I stayed away from music as much as possible. Although of course it's hard to avoid it entirely, but I did my best. Sometimes I could feel something deep inside me, longing to be released - my inheritance from my father, as I instinctively recognized. But I never dared to open the floodgates, go against my mother's wishes.

But then, she died, too - unexpectedly. In an accident.

I had no family left - certainly no close family. I started to make my own way in the world, doing an engineering degree at college and settling into the kind of career my mother had wanted for me.

And I started dating a guy called Eric. He was kind, caring, not to mention good-looking.

And he was a musician.

He taught me about music. All the things I felt I had missed out on. It couldn't hurt my mother now, I thought.

But I began to have dreams about her - when she would just stare at me, reproachfully.

*I told you not to Lia,* she said once.

Then the dreams stopped. And the music began.

It was a lost, lilting, lonesome-sounding melody that just popped into my head one day. Like someone singing in the distance. A voice I couldn't place, but which sounded hauntingly familiar. 

A voice I had known, deep down, all my life. 

It was calling me, beseeching me, drawing me ... to where?

I went about for days with that voice, that melody stuck in my head. I asked Eric about it, if he'd heard it before, but he hadn't.

And then finally the voice faded away.

 But then the headaches began.

Just hormonal stuff, migraines. Nothing organically wrong, was the verdict I got from the doctors at first. Nothing really to worry about as long as I took care of my general health.

But the headaches didn't stop, and began more and more to impinge on my everyday life.

Until the day when I woke up and felt such an intolerable squeezing, sense of pressure in my head I was convinced I was dying. And Eric just happened to be away for that weekend. He hadn't wanted to leave me as I'd been feeling so out of sorts, but I had persuaded him to take a break for once, and I had asked a friend to pop over later. But now I regretted it. Big-time.

The pressure increased until I knew my head was just going to explode. *Explode and be done with it*, I thought muzzily.

I was about to call emergency services when I passed out. That's where my friend Kat found me, huddled on the floor next to my bed.



They didn't waste much time in arranging scans and all the rest. This was serious, now.

And very strange.

I've had to do some research pretty quickly, and into my family history too. All the time I'm getting weaker and weaker. Eric remains at my side, remaining strong for me, but of course he's devastated.

I have a fatal case of earworms. 

You know - earworms. That's the name given to music, songs, that get stuck in your head now and then. 

Well, it turns out I have an ultra-rare disorder where those earworms manifest *physically,* and start eating away at the brain.

My father had it too. About the only other person in the world to have it, and he passed it on to me. He'd been offered the chance of an operation to remove them, but he hadn't taken it - because that would have left him unable to appreciate music ever again. A musical lobotomy, if you will. 

And he'd preferred death to that.

So now I am faced with the same choice. 

Lose the music which I had come to love, the full bloom of my heritage, which had also brought me to Eric, the love of my life. Or, lose my life.

The lost, lonely voice is calling me again.
