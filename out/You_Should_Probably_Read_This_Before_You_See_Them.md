Hello. You can read this right?   
  
Breathe in deeply, and raise your index finger if you can. No, the one on your other hand.   
  
Okay, well let's assume that you can read this. It took a few minutes, but I think I've finally managed to have some words projected into your program.   
  
You know how when you're reading something on your phone? And as you're scrolling down, it seems like the paragraph you just read is different than when you're looking at it. That was me.   
  
That was what I've been trying to tell you. By now, you people usually realize the implications of this. None of what is around you is real.   
  
You really should have seen this coming.  
Remember when you and your friends were driving around at night? You looked down, and as you looked back up, you were in a completely different place?   
  
We didn't even load a lot of the faces correctly. A lot of them had no lips. Thankfully, most don't seem to look there.   
  
That's what we have been counting on. That so much of this version of your life would lead you to so many delusions that you wouldn't notice anything that we messed up.   
  
But, unfortunately, a recent update to improve things with the high-tier members is going to cause the lower-tier members to experience some...difficulties.   
  
I added ellipses to emphasize the drama a bit there.   
  
Anyway, there may or may not be giant wasps in your future. Are you drinking iced tea as you drink this? Then there's gonna be wasps.   
In about two weeks or so, your governor will warn the public that there will be a yet undiscovered invasive species of wasp in your area. People online will laugh at this because of how crazy 2024 is looking, and then about 15 or 16 people will die to their stings.   
  
Depending on certain variables, they may be able to enter your home through the air vents of your vehicle or home. In any case, they are weak to deodorant. Unless they are not.   
  
Secondly, you may get a vague sense that cameras are watching you. Not the surveillance cameras inside streets or on street corners. I mean cameras right behind you.   
  
Moving around you to get just the right angle. Over time, you may hear the footsteps of the "men" carrying them. And you may be able to feel the absolute weight of the large, bulky machine they call a camera. As if it had its own gravitational pull.   
  
Everybody else has chosen to smile for them. Will you?   
  
But the most likely anomaly to cross your path will be the large cylinder-shaped one. It starts off about 5 feet away from you when it first appears. And it gets 1 foot closer to you every 5 seconds. You can get away from it pretty easily.   
But, it will still be there. When you leave a room, we will put less effort into the environment of that room so that it doesn't weigh as heavily on your mind.   
It all just becomes nothing but grey textures at some point. In that colorless desert, the cylinder will still be there.   
  
Test simulations have shown the cylinder to be covered in a reflective, beige texture. We only got to look at it for 5 seconds before the simulation froze and crashed.   
  
Whenever it reaches its intended target, it does something similar, as well as erasing the person inside duh program (physically and mentally).  Whenever it's near its intended target, words surrounding the target begin to glitch out and grammatical errors appear.   
  
These are tthe most likely anomalies, but if you bear witness to any more, please inform our staff by screaming it very loudly so that we can pick up what your saying clearly.   
  
It is understandable for you to be upset that your experience is being taken away from you due to our error. But, this is what you get for picking the lower-tier option.   
  
People don't just choose this option because of the lower cost, you know. It's also due to the freedom. Higher-tier worlds are entirely predicted and chosen by our staff. But lower-tier ones are generated in the moment by your thoughts.   
  
You think of what you fear, there it is in the dark for just a few seconds. You think of what you love, it becomes all that you are. You want a challenge, you work years for it. If you want pain, then there is just enough pain to still give you enough hope to seek more pain.   
  
The odd thing is, they always seem to forget that's what they were looking for all along. To be trapped.   
  
But we will let you out though. Just close your eyes, and if you want it, you will be free. And you'll go to a new world that you don't know anything about. A world of things you can't say with words. And you will remember why you went inside.   
  
Still there, huh? As expected.   
  
Have a nice lifee.
