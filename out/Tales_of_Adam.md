Hi guys! I wrote alittle something, got inspiration from alot of my fav authors, this is something ive writthen, just a sort of trial run. Didnt know where to post it lol but i hope you guys enjoy! Any and all feedback is welcomed!


(Prologue)

In the beginning, there was nothing. And I don’t meaningless “nothing” in the poetic, deep, pseudo philosophical way people use when they try to sound smarter than they are. I mean *actual* nothing. No space, no time, no sound, no void to scream into just absolute zip, nada, a whole lotta squat. I know it doesn’t make sense, but what does? Nothing makes sense. Like why some people microwave their leftover pizza instead of using an oven. Anyway, I’m getting off track here. Let’s try this again, okay?

(Chapter 1)

On the edge of the universe, there was a planet a real dump of a planet, honestly. And on the edge of one of its shittiest towns, you could find me. Not sipping a drink at some dive bar or laying low in a motel, no. I was in a cage. I wish I could tell you this was the weirdest situation I’d ever been in. Last week, I spent forty eight hours locked inside a fridge don’t ask, that’s another story. But you're probably wondering how I ended up here, aren't you? Well, buckle up, because this one’s a doozy. 

So... Where to begin? Guess we gotta hit the big *beginning* the *Beginning* beginning. 

You know, before the stars, planets, and overpriced iced coffee, there was just... nothing. The same kind of nothing I was talking about earlier no rules, no meaning, just pure uncut absence. If you’re having a hard time wrapping your head around that, join the club. It’s like trying to imagine a world where people don’t hit reply all on emails. It just doesn’t compute. But, in one climactic moment, everything exploded into existence: time, space, matter, that annoying song your coworker hums every day all of it, just poof. And from this glorious mess came the universe. 

And with the universe came *Dad.* 

Dad well, you might know him as God, but around here we call him Dad wasn’t really what you’d call a "details guy." He liked the big picture. The grand scheme of things. The cosmic vision board. But after a few billion years of stirring galaxies and hurling comets through space, even the divine gets bored. So Dad decided to retire and settle down in a cozy little corner of the cosmos. Found a gas cloud that would eventually turn into our solar system, gave it a nod, and said, “Yeah, this’ll do.” 

For reasons beyond my comprehension seriously, *why* he fixated on this backwater rock we call Earth. Honestly, Mars would’ve been the better choice. Nice scenery, plenty of room for a patio. But Dad isn’t known for his taste in real estate. Every now and then, he’d throw a space rock full of random chemicals at the planet just to see what stuck. And somehow, after a few billion years of trial and error, oceans appeared, continents rose, and *life* clawed its way out of the muck.  

Then Dad got an idea. See, he didn’t want to micromanage this dirtball forever. So, he made something a successor, someone to eventually take over the cosmic throne and govern the universe. Big shoes to fill, right? But in the meantime, Dad gave the new guy a trial run on Earth. "Figure out life, manage some creatures, create stuff," he said, like it was a casual summer internship. And this guy, well… let's just say he got real ambitious with it. Mountains, rivers, trees, animals the works. 

He sculpted the first land based life, and for a while, things were looking pretty good. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned about this universe, it’s that good things don’t stay good for long. I mean, just look at the rise and fall of Blockbuster. 

But hey, I’m getting ahead of myself.
