My mom was on her routine shift at the hospital and I knew I wouldn't see her til the next morning, in a deep sleep on her bed, likely still in her uniform. I always made her breakfast before I would leave for school in the morning so she could wake up to a nice meal. I use the word “nice” loosely, it’s the best I could do considering I’m sixteen and failed my home economics class last year. But my mom never minded the toast, scrambled eggs, and turkey bacon platter left on her nightstand.

We had said our goodbyes around 10:15 and I got myself comfortable on the couch with my dog to watch some TV. I turned the lights off over us to set the scene and make it feel more like a movie theater. I had got through one *Dateline* episode when I decided that I could enjoy the experience a little more if I grabbed my bong. So, I went upstairs and down the long, narrow hallway that led to my wing of the house. I was the only occupied room on this side of the house, the other rooms were my dad’s old office and the guest room. Though that room hasn’t had a guest in it for years, ever since my dad’s passing, my mom and I haven’t even wanted to host other people here. Instead, it hosts the overload of clutter I find at the end of every school year: clothes that I no longer want and plan on selling or donating, paintings I worked months on but never hang up, and other miscellaneous items that aren’t used but can’t seem to be let go of either.

I opened my bedroom door and grabbed the piece off my nightstand. It was almost a sculpture rather than a cheesy bong you imagine when you think of a stoner. It was about sixteen inches tall made completely out of this blue, hand blown glass that resembled the light blue the ocean looks after a series of rough waves. The glass swirled in an upward motion towards the mouth piece that made it look like it was water, frozen in time. My favorite feature of this prized possession is its ability to glow in the dark. After letting it sit in the sun for a bit, at night flecks of the glass would glow a bright green.

I walked back down the hallway with it, then back down the stairs until I was sitting down on the couch next to Pepe, my dog. He was sound asleep as I started to grind up the green, sticky plant matter. Which was genuinely what the name was, “Plant matter”, it was this new strain I had just bought from my regular plug in the next town over. He had told me he just recently got a limited supply of this stuff and asked me if I could be one of his test subjects to see if he should buy more. Without hesitation, I agreed. Discounted weed to just give my feedback? I’d be a fool not to take that offer, so I did.

Holding it in my hand I saw a multitude of colors that reflected off its crystals. It’s common to see colors like purple and orange but this stuff had red, blue, and pink.

“Odd”, I thought.

But I was taken over by more intrigue than suspicion so I continued to put some in the bowl and pack it down with my lighter. After the first inhale, I got the taste of regular weed, but with a slight trace of citrus. It was pleasant, and I was paying extra attention to its experience so I could give a good, detailed report back to the plug like he had asked.

About fifteen minutes went by, *Dateline* was still playing and this specific episode seemed to be extra interesting to me in my new hazy state. The cushions beneath me started to almost mold to my body, I felt as though I was sinking yet weighed as light as a feather at the same time. My eyes started to get dry, keeping them open became a task more so than a natural ability at this point. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

As I slowly started to move my eyes behind my lids, I realized that I had fallen asleep. It must have been for quite a while because I felt so sluggish, like it used all the strength within me just to be able to fully open my eyes. The lights above the living room were still off, like I had left them, but the all others on the downstairs floor were too. It was now pitch black everywhere except for the surrounding area where the light emitting from the TV could reach, which was not very far. 

The second thing I noticed was what sent a cold chill running through my body and caused my heart to start racing.

I was paralyzed.

I was physically unable to move any part of my body other than my eyes, tips of fingers, and toes. I was only able to produce slight twitches but it took so much strength out of me to do so.

So there I was, almost completely paralyzed, unable to move or scream for help while the TV numbingly continued the program like I was still an attentive, consenting viewer. Pepe was still soundly asleep beside me, blissfully unaware of the living hell I was experiencing just inches away from his sleeping head.

I tried reaching for him. Maybe he would sense my distress and…

“Then what,” I thought to myself “what the hell would happen next that could possibly help this situation?”

The answer was nothing.

I felt as though Keith Morrison was now mocking me and the couch cushion below me that once felt made for me was now stiff and cold. As if every fiber in the fabric were rejecting my body. 

I started to panic.

Not because the realization of this situation was settling in, but because I heard a creak from upstairs.

I knew this house like the back of my hand. It’s the only house I have ever lived in so I knew that each floorboard had its own creak and this one, this one I recognized as the top of the stairs. Someone was in my home and they were standing at the top of the staircase that led down directly to the room I was in. 

Each crack that followed the last made my eyes water. The sound resembled what I might imagine a rib being snapped in half would make, at least that's what jolts of pain felt like. Hearing the footsteps descend the stairs made my stomach turn, it made my body writhe in pain from the inside out. 

Staring at the one visible stair from my position on the couch made me want to recoil into my skin. I did not want to see the intruder, the person who would be able to have their way with me in such a vulnerable state. Though I could not rip my gaze from the stairs. If someone was going to do whatever evil they intended, I was going to see it coming.

Seconds felt like minutes, my heart sped so fast that each beat felt seconds apart. I was shaking and dripping in sweat. The sound from the TV faded away as a long, piercing ring filled its place.

A hand gripped the side of the wall that was obstructing my view of the stairs and the person attached to the hand.

I now only heard the shallow scream coming from the back of my throat, the only level of sound I could muster up in my frozen state. I was a deer in headlights, the perfect victim for any predator. It was hard to say what was if I was still paralyzed or if the sheer terror I felt in that moment was responsible for my immobilization.

The hand methodically lifted its fingers and tapped each one of them back down making a sickening drumming noise. Once, then twice, then three times before the rest of the body was slightly illuminated when the thing moved to the last and final stair. 

As it revealed its form, my eyes trailed up to at least eight feet in the air. It was gigantic. Its limbs were as long as its height and the creature’s face had a mouth that stretched from side to side. It wore a gut-wrenching expression that could only be described as a smile due to the fact that it had no teeth. Just a huge mouth stretched agape with bleeding gums that dripped down to my wood floors, an indication that this was not a figment of imagination but a real, dangerous threat and I needed to step into action immediately. 

It produced a menacing, horrid laugh as it witnessed me using every ounce of energy I had in my body to just cry out. Anything, something to alert anyone. But all I could do was cry silently, my eyes streamed with tears while I stared unblinking at the creature slowly approaching me like a lion would their prey.

It made it off the last stair now. Its long arms dangled behind its moving legs, dragging along the floor still drumming its fingers.

It was moving at a slow pace because it knew I couldn’t move. It knew that dragging out this hellish scene would make the kill all the more satisfying for its demented desire.

It was mere feet away from me and I was able to see its face fully illuminated now and it was horrifying.

Still smiling with its red gums, its small eyes were as wide as its anatomy allowed and they never left mine. It had a nose but it was just two holes that looked like they were hand poked into this God awful creation. It was almost as if it were human, but the devil seemed to have poisoned this one.

It was now close enough to smell my fear and see the glint of hope for survival fading in my eyes. I had to do something, anything that would make me feel like I at least tried to fight for my life.

That’s when I saw it in the corner of my eye. This faint green glow just inches away from my frozen hand: my bong. 

Amongst all the chaos I forgot about it, but something within me clicked and told me to try to move again. So I did, I focused all of my energy toward moving my hand to grabbing my newly chosen weapon and it worked. I was able to grab it and within moments I had swung the thick glass vase over the creature's head again and again and again.

Its blood wasn’t red like the color dripping from its toothless smile, instead it was dark black. The black tar-like blood was everywhere. I felt it hit my face, go into my mouth, and saw it cover the couch, floors, and walls.

The scene was brutal. The once terrifying creature was now smashed and bent in a multitude of ways. Its face was no longer distinguishable from the other battered parts of its body and I smiled. I smiled now that that thing no longer had his.

I stood over its body with a mix of shock, adrenaline, and joy that I almost laughed if it were not for my intense panting. I could not stop breathing. I thought I was going to pass out.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I awoke to the feeling of bed sheets and my head laying on a pillow.

The relief that this was all a dream showered over my body as I went to stretch my limbs and slowly opened my eyes.

But I couldn’t.

The sound of metal hitting against itself brought my attention to the handcuffs around my wrists. The slow beeping that was hidden in the background got drawn forward as I scanned my surroundings.

I was in a hospital room, still covered in that sticky, metallic smelling goo. Though it was not black like I dreamed, it was crimson red.

The voice of an unfamiliar man brought me back to the present.

“Miss,” the officer said in a low and careful tone, “do you remember last night?”

Of course I did. I don’t think I will ever be able to get that disgusting smile out of my head. The immense fear I felt can still be present if I just closed my eyes.

“Y- yes,” it was the first time I heard my own voice in hours, “there was this…*thing.*”

The officer gave an unamused look to his colleague as he let out a deep breath and threw a stack of images on my lap.

My *mother* laid violently killed our living room floor. If it weren’t for her nursing uniform I wouldn’t have been able to tell that it was even human. Before I was able to even process what the officers were insinuating I had done, I screamed.

I screamed so loud that I felt my vocal cords rubbing against each other as it was followed by a flood of tears.

Out of my guttural screams I heard a hauntingly familiar sound: I looked up to see the officer drumming his fingers on his notepad and watched as his mouth stretched into that distinct, disgusting, toothless smile.
