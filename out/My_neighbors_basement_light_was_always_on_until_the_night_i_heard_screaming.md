I live in an old apartment complex with thin walls. Most of my neighbors keep to themselves, except for the guy in 3B. Mid-40s, quiet, never speaks. I don’t even know his name. He doesn’t make small talk in the hallways, never picks up packages from the lobby, and as far as I can tell, he has no friends or family that visit.

But the weirdest thing about him? His basement light is always on.

From my bedroom window, I can see the small, dirt-streaked window of the basement. It glows with that same dim yellow light every night, every morning, every hour of the day. At first, I thought maybe he was forgetful, or just didn’t care about his electricity bill. But after weeks of seeing that light never once turn off, I started paying attention.

No one ever went into that basement. No one ever came out.

I asked my other neighbors about it once, casually bringing it up during an elevator ride. Mrs. Patel, the elderly woman from 2A, just shook her head. “That man gives me the creeps,” she muttered under her breath.

I pressed her for more, but she only said one thing before stepping out:

“I’ve lived here for twelve years, dear. That basement light has never turned off.”

I laughed it off at the time. But then, last Friday at 2 AM, I saw something that wiped the smirk right off my face.

The basement light turned off.

At first, I just blinked at the dark window, confused. That light had been on for as long as I’d lived here. Why now? What changed?

Then, I heard it.

A muffled scream.

At first, I thought I imagined it. I sat up in bed, ears straining.

Then, another sound a loud thud.

And then, a dragging noise.

I sat there, frozen. My apartment was dead silent, but I could feel my pulse hammering in my ears. My brain scrambled for a reasonable explanation. A dropped box? Someone moving furniture? But deep down, I knew better.

I reached for my phone. Thought about calling the police. But what would I say? That my neighbor turned off his basement light for the first time and now I think he’s murdering someone?

My gut told me to wait. So I did.

And that’s when I saw him. He stepped out from the basement door into the cold night air. He was carrying something.

A large black bag. The kind you’d put garbage in. But this wasn’t just trash.

It was stained. Wet patches of something dark seeped through the plastic. And worse? It was leaking.

Thick, slow drips of something dark trailed behind him as he walked toward the dumpster.

I wanted to duck away from the window, but I couldn’t. I was frozen, breath shallow, watching as he made his way across the lot. He moved slowly, deliberately, as if making sure no one was watching.

Then, just as quickly, he dumped the bag inside, wiped his hands on his jeans, and walked back inside like nothing had happened.

The basement light flickered back on an hour later.

I didn’t sleep that night.

By morning, I had convinced myself I was being paranoid. Maybe it was just trash. Maybe the stains weren’t what I thought. Maybe I had let my imagination run wild.

But when I went outside later that morning, the bag was gone.

No trash pickup had come. No one else had been near that dumpster. It had just… disappeared.

I wanted to believe it was all in my head, but my gut kept twisting with unease. So, I did something stupid.

That night, around 1:45 AM, I turned off all my lights and sat by my window, waiting.

At exactly 2 AM, the basement light turned off again.

I held my breath, every muscle in my body tense.

And then I heard it.
The same muffled scream. The same loud thud.

Only this time, it was closer.

I felt my stomach drop. It wasn’t coming from the basement. It was coming from the hallway outside my apartment.

A soft shuffling sound followed. Slow, deliberate footsteps.

Then, a knock.

Not a normal knock. Not one you’d expect from a neighbor asking for sugar or a maintenance worker doing rounds.

A soft, deliberate knock. Three slow taps.

I didn’t move. I didn’t even breathe.

Then, after a few moments of silence, I heard it the sound of something being slid under my door.

I waited until I couldn’t hear footsteps anymore, then, heart pounding, I crept forward.

A single sheet of paper lay on the floor.

In shaky, desperate handwriting, it read:

“HELP ME.”

I locked my door, grabbed a knife from the kitchen, and stayed awake until morning.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know who wrote that note. But I do know one thing my neighbor in 3B is not just a quiet guy with an always-on basement light.

And I’m starting to think I might be next.
