**The Backward Man**  
It started as a local urban legend, the kind of story kids whisper at sleepovers to scare each other. A tall, thin man who moves entirely in reverse—jerky, unnatural, like a video played backward. **The Backward Man.**

The rules were always the same: **if you see him, don’t react. Don’t scream. Don’t run.**  
He only follows those who acknowledge him.

They say he appears in dark alleys, empty parking lots, or the far end of a lonely street just after dusk. You’ll hear a strange, wet clicking sound, like joints popping in the wrong direction, like someone dislocating every bone just to walk.

If you turn to look, you might see him moving toward you, each step perfectly mirrored—his foot landing before he lifts it, his fingers curling open before they clench shut. His face never changes. Slack-jawed. Pale. Eyes milky and unfocused, like he’s watching something else. Maybe a different version of you. Maybe the *before* version.

A friend of a friend swore she saw him once. She was walking her dog late at night. The dog froze mid-step, whined, and backed into her legs. Then she heard it—the sound—like wet bones and broken gears. She turned.

She said he wasn’t just moving backward—he was **undoing**.

There was a stray cat in the alley, freshly dead, hit by a car. She watched as it un-died. Its flattened body peeled up from the pavement, bones unbreaking, fur smoothing. It meowed and ran. But she didn’t move. She remembered the rules.

“He didn’t care,” she said. “He only watches. He only rewinds. Until he notices *you.*”

At the time, I thought it was just a creepy story.

But then came **last night**.

I was walking home from a closing shift. The street was empty. Streetlights buzzed, flickering like dying fireflies. I had my earbuds in—some late-night playlist to keep the tired away. Then, halfway down Wexler Avenue, my music cut out with a *shriek*—like static tearing itself in half.

The air shifted.

It was subtle at first. But wrong.

Everything smelled like burnt hair and wet earth, like something buried deep had been unearthed too soon. My breath fogged even though it was warm. And then I heard it—the sound.

**Click-pop. Click-pop.**  
Wet. Mechanical. Unnatural.

I turned around.  
I don’t know why.  
I *knew* the rules.

He was there.

Taller than I imagined. Dressed in a long, gray coat that fluttered in a wind I couldn’t feel. His arms jerked upward, elbows bending the wrong way, fingers splaying open before clenching into fists.

He moved again.  
A step closer.

The pavement beneath his foot **healed**—a crack sealed itself. A dried leaf reattached to a branch. A burned-out streetlamp above us flickered and glowed again.

I stood still.  
Didn’t breathe.  
Didn’t blink.

He kept coming.  
Another step.  
Another.

I noticed things around me changing. My coffee cup, crushed and tossed in a trash can, was back in my hand, full and warm. A bug I had stepped on earlier scuttled past me, whole and fast. A billboard across the street shifted from an ad I’d seen a week ago to one from months before.

I squeezed my eyes shut. I wanted to scream. To run. But I *remembered.*

Then… silence.

I counted to ten. Twenty. Forty.

When I opened my eyes, he was gone.  
But something was wrong.

At first, I couldn’t place it. My phone buzzed with a message from my mom—**“Please be careful walking home. I had the strangest dream.”** But I’d talked to her earlier. I *remembered.*

Except the call log was empty.

I checked my texts. There were messages I don’t remember sending. One said, **“I saw him.”** Another said, **“I think he’s inside me now.”**

I didn’t write that.

I got home and went straight to the bathroom. My shoes were soaking wet, but it hadn’t rained. My pants had dried mud on them, like I’d walked through a park, or worse. My keys were in the wrong pocket.

Then I looked in the mirror.

My reflection stared back.

But it didn’t move right.

There was a hesitation, like lag. I tilted my head slowly. It followed—but a fraction too late. Like it had to remember how to be *me.*

Then it smiled.

**I didn’t.**

The changes kept coming.

I woke up this morning and my clock was set two hours back. My cereal box had a different design. I checked my emails—half of them were unread, even though I *remember* reading them yesterday. Some were dated last week but I swear they never existed before.

I tried to talk to my roommate. Asked him if anything felt off. He just gave me a look and said,  
“Dude, you moved out two weeks ago.”

No. I live here. I *remember* the layout, the closet full of my stuff. But when I opened it, it was empty.

No clothes. No photos. Nothing with my name on it.

Now, every night, I hear the clicking.

Closer.

Sometimes I catch my reflection watching me when I’m not moving. Like it's waiting. Testing the rules.

And yesterday—God, yesterday—I saw a man across the street, standing still. Just staring.

And *he looked like me.*

But older. Or maybe just… **worn down.**

I think the Backward Man didn’t just rewind me.  
I think he split me.  
Or replaced me.  
Or started something over that was never supposed to be undone.

And now I don’t know if I’m the original…  
or the rerun.
