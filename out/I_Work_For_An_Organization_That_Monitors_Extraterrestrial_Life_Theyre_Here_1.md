&#x200B;

“Please understand that it’s not a question of *if* my employers will be recovering their property. It is when.”

&#x200B;

The man in the black suit spoke in a calm but friendly voice, although it did nothing to put me at ease. At a glance, he looked like a fairly unremarkable young man with brown hair and pasty skin. But that smile of his… that smile with too many teeth… everything about it seemed *wrong*.

&#x200B;

He’d called himself ‘*Mr. Frost*.’ Although I’m not entirely sure that he was actually human. Too much was wrong with him. Too much seemed off.

&#x200B;

I kept my gun trained on him as we stood amongst the burned skeletons of the trees his ‘*employers*’ had torched as a ‘*warning.*’ Although to be honest, I wasn’t entirely sure if the gun would even do anything. He certainly didn’t seem to notice it.

&#x200B;

“Tonight, they will return to claim what is theirs,” He continued. “Your only choice in this matter is whether you give it to them willingly or not. While I am certain that you are aware of their… capabilities… you can also see that they’ve left you a generous reminder. Think of it as both a warning and an olive branch. Despite your… rocky, previous encounter my employers do not wish to harm you, or anyone in your organization. They only want what is theirs. That specimen…”

&#x200B;

‘*Specimen*’ was that what they were calling her? The way he talked about her like she wasn’t even a person left a bitter yet familiar pang of rage flaring up in my chest. Her name was Bea. Not ‘*The Specimen*’ not ‘*B-921’*,  ***Bea!***

&#x200B;

We’d found her only a few weeks ago. Currently, she was our best source of information on Mr. Frost’s enigmatic ‘*employers*’ We’d known they were looking for her, and we’d done everything in our power to keep her safe. We just should’ve known it wouldn’t last forever. But I’d be damned if I let them take her away from me! Not because she was a good source of information, but because that girl didn’t deserve to go back into whatever hell Mr. Frost’s employers had kept her in! I wouldn’t let her!

&#x200B;

“She doesn’t belong out here,” Mr. Frost said as if reading my thoughts, “She belongs back with them. Where she will be truly safe!”

“Your ‘employers’ have a lot of nerve claiming that they own that girl,” I said.

“And as long as I’m still alive they aren’t going to lay a single slimey green finger on her.”

&#x200B;

Mr. Frost chuckled.

“*Girl*… you think that she’s human?” He asked.

&#x200B;

My heart skipped a beat, although I forced whatever questions came to mind out of my head immediately. I had no reason to believe that this man wouldn’t say whatever he had to in order to get what he wanted. Anything he said to me could have been a lie.

“She’s human enough…” I said.

“My employers might just consider that a compliment,” Mr. Frost said. “And I suppose I would too.”

&#x200B;

Of course he probably wasn’t human… of course.

“I suppose whatever decision you make is up to you,” Mr. Frost said. “You’ve been warned of the consequences. But personally I’d consider it a shame to see you dead, Miss Vogel. You’re quite the interesting specimen yourself!”

“Get the hell off my property,” I said. “And tell your Employers that if they come back, I’ll kill every single last one of them. I don’t care what I have to do.”

&#x200B;

Mr. Frost’s grin widened.

“As you wish,” He said before turning to leave. “It was a pleasure meeting you, Audrey! A shame that we won’t meet again!”

&#x200B;

With that, he was gone. I barely even saw him leave… I just blinked and he disappeared. There was no light, no sound… nothing. I glanced up, watching the sky for some sign that anything was out of place, but I saw nothing.

&#x200B;

My grip on the gun remained firm. I could feel my pulse racing. But the oppressive that silence surrounding me told me that nothing was there. Slowly, I lowered the gun and turned to go back inside the cabin, only to see Bea watching me from the doorway.

&#x200B;

My heart sank as I saw the look on her face, and I knew that she’d heard everything. It seemed that we had a lot to talk about.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

In a sense, I suppose I’ve been preparing for this my entire life. My Grandfather always thought it was inevitable that one day, we’d come into direct contact with an extraterrestrial species, and given what we knew about the species that was watching the earth, he suspected that such an encounter would likely be violent.

&#x200B;

To that end - both my grandfather and my father took every precaution to ensure that we were ready for the inevitable first contact. They turned The Vogel Institute into the first line of defense against the coming threat. And when that first contact came… we fought them back.

&#x200B;

When we recovered Bea and realized that she had firsthand knowledge of the extraterrestrial species we knew as ‘The Supremacy’ and whatever twisted operations they were carrying out, we knew there was a risk that they’d come for her. We just didn’t expect them to launch a full out attack.

&#x200B;

I suppose it’s probably a credit to my father and my grandfather's planning that we were able to fight them off, although it was by no means an easy victory… we lost more people than I would be comfortable with. Friends, colleagues, partners…

&#x200B;

I suspect that we only came away triumphant in the end because the Supremacy underestimated us. They didn’t think we would be as prepared as we were. I doubted they’d make the same mistake twice.

&#x200B;

I didn’t think I’d get a warning before they came again… but The Supremacy are full of surprises. I didn’t even think they could send an envoy, but they did. And now we had only a scant few hours before they came back, this time in force.

&#x200B;

To say that I was terrified would be an understatement.

&#x200B;

I’d seen what the Supremacy could do. I’d investigated the messes they’d left behind. I was there at the London Office when they came for Bea the first time. I knew that this wasn’t a fight I could win. But I didn’t have much of a choice either.

&#x200B;

After Mr. Frost had left, Bea and I sat quietly in the kitchen, neither of us quite sure what to say. Her hands were shaking. She looked as if she’d gone a shade paler… and I was at a complete loss for words on what to say to her. What do you say to someone who just found out that they aren’t human?

&#x200B;

“I knew they were hybridizing children…” She said softly, “But I didn’t… I didn’t think I was… oh God…”

“This doesn’t change anything,” I said, trying very hard to keep my voice level. “We’ve still got about seven to eight hours of sunlight left. If we move now, we can be back in Toronto and in a secure location. They’re not going to attack us in the middle of Toronto.”

&#x200B;

“That’s a four hour drive,” Bea said. “You don’t think they can intercept us? They’re watching us *right now*!”

“Then we call for backup here,” I said. “Get someone in from the Toronto office to escort us out. We should still have enough time in the day to get out of here before they show up!”

“You don’t think they’ll kill us the moment they realize we’re calling for help?” Bea asked.

“Well we’re not just going to fucking sit here and wait for them to come!” I snapped, “So let’s think of something, okay?”

&#x200B;

I took out my phone.

“Let me at least call my contact at the University. We need the help!”

“And risk them killing him too?” Bea asked. She got up to try and stop me but I was taller than her, stronger than her and had longer arms. All it really took to stop her was a firm hand on her shoulder as I dialed the number.

&#x200B;

The phone didn’t ring.

“The hell…?” I said under my breath, before checking my signal.

Nothing.

&#x200B;

Our power wasn’t out anymore. I should have had some kind of phone signal.

“Landline…” I said, before going toward the house phone.

Still no luck.

“They’ve cut off all communication to the outside,” Bea said. “They don’t want us calling for help.”

“Then we drive to the University ourselves,” I said. I grabbed my car keys from beside the door and stepped out of the cabin.

&#x200B;

“Do you even need me to tell why that isn’t going to work?” Bea asked.

I didn’t answer her. I just went out into the detached garage. Bea waited by the door as I headed for the car. The key fob didn’t unlock the doors. I had to unlock them the old fashioned way. That still didn’t stop me, though. I got in the driver's seat and slid the key into the ignition. The engine didn’t even turn over. I tried it again and again, with no luck.

&#x200B;

“COME ON!” I snapped, pounding on the steering wheel and trying again. “It was working just fine yesterday!”

“Before they found us,” Bea said from the doorway.

&#x200B;

I pounded on the steering wheel again before getting out. I checked the cabinets on the far wall on the off chance that there was something that could miraculously fix the car, but none of the tools there would have been of any use to me.

“Fine, we’ll just walk,” I said. “Maybe a neighbor can give us a ride into town. Then we get the hell out of town, we go back to the city and we get underground.”

“We’re not going to be any safer in the city!” Bea argued as I stormed out of the garage. “Keeping me in London didn’t stop them, remember? You think taking me to Toronto is going to be any different?”

&#x200B;

“Well what other options do we have right now?” I asked, harsher than I’d intended to. I saw Bea shrink back a step. I hesitated for a moment, before reaching out to take her hand.

“I’m not letting them take you back,” I said. She closed her eyes, struggling for a few moments to put together a response.

“And I’m not letting them kill you,” She finally said. “I was doing okay on my own before… if I left, maybe I could lure them away.”

&#x200B;

“Absolutely not,” I said. “You’re just going to get yourself killed or caught!”

“Then at least one of us makes it out of this,” She said. “Look… I’ve told you and your organization everything I know. At this point, I’m just dead weight. You don’t need to stick your neck out for me like this! Apparently, I’m not even human so you shouldn’t-”

“No,” I said. “No. We are *not* having this conversation. I don’t give a damn how much of you is human and how much of you isn’t, it changes nothing!”

&#x200B;

Bea just stared doubtfully back at me.

“Are you sure your organization is going to see it that way?” She asked.

“They’ll see it the way I tell them to see it!” I replied. “Whatever happens next, we deal with it together, okay?”

&#x200B;

She didn’t answer.

“Okay?” I repeated, putting a hand on her shoulder. Slowly, she nodded.

“Okay…” She finally said. “But I want to go on the record, that I don’t think walking to town is going to be an option either. Assuming they don’t try and stop us, they’ll be watching our every move.”

“Well, we’ll figure something out,” I said. “What about that device of yours? Maybe we can use it to throw them off.”

&#x200B;

Bea raised an eyebrow

“The radio I was working on? That’s what us into this mess,” She said. “If I hadn’t been screwing with the frequencies, they wouldn’t have found us.”

“Well, at least we know it’s on the right frequencies,” I said. “Maybe we can still use it. Worst case scenario, didn’t you say it could trigger that failsafe on their equipment?”

Her eyes lit up.

“Of course…”

&#x200B;

She headed back downstairs, into the safe room and I followed her. She’d taken the time to repair the device (not that she’d done much to break it aside from ripping out the batteries) while we’d been down there.

“I still can’t guarantee it’ll work,” She admitted as she picked it up again. “But if we were able to send a signal they could pick up…”

“We could really screw with their tech,” I finished. “We could bring it with us as a backup plan. If they try anything, we could use it. It might create an opening for us to escape.”

&#x200B;

Bea shook her head.

“I don’t know if I’d risk using this on the fly,” She said. “I’d need time to properly calibrate it. Getting it wrong on the first go could be deadly. It’d be better if they were coming to us.”

“So what, you’d rather stay here?” I asked suspiciously. “That sounds just as risky. We’ll be sitting ducks!”

&#x200B;

“I know. And I don’t think they’ll realize that they’re walking into a trap until it’s too late,” Bea said. “They’re going to come after us one way or another. If we do it this way, then they’re going to come in thinking they’ve got the advantage and then, when they’re in close I just need to press one button and… bam.”

She mimed an explosion with her hands.

“They won’t know what hit them!”

&#x200B;

Considering what I knew about the Supremacy’s little failsafe, they probably wouldn’t and that was just fine by me. I’m well aware that the primary purpose of the Vogel Institute is to research extraterrestrial life, however I knew I’d still take an inordinate amount of satisfaction in watching those little bastards burn.

“Alright,” I finally said. “Let’s see if this works.”

&#x200B;

I guess it wasn’t as stupid as our other ideas had been. At least this way, we’d probably put up more of a fight. I went over to the far side of the safe room, where we kept a gun locker and opened it. We’d been given some emergency supplies in case a situation like this arose. There wasn’t a hell of a lot in there, but there was enough. A hunting rifle, a .45 revolver, and a couple boxes of ammunition. Not quite enough to hold off the kind of assault we were expecting by themselves, but maybe just what we needed to mop up anything that survived after Bea activated the failsafe.

&#x200B;

There were still a million things that could go wrong, but I still almost felt like we had a chance.

Almost.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

My Father said that I was born to work for the Vogel Institute, just like he was. For as long as I can remember, he’s been preparing me for this life. When I was younger, that meant private schools with one on one tutoring on the weekends. In fact, most of my free time was devoted to preparing for the day I finally joined the family business and followed in my father's footsteps.

&#x200B;

By the time I was 16, he already had me taking some University level courses. Meteorology, sociology, astrobiology, and business management to name a few.

&#x200B;

I won’t pretend that it all came easy to me. I worked my ass off studying, trying to make time for everything, trying to excel at everything because I knew that I had a job to do. For as long as I could remember, my father had told me that the Vogel Institute was the first and last line of defense against the horrors that were out there in the void. So I worked, I studied, I learned so that if the day ever came where I needed to face down the Supremacy… when the day came… I would be ready.

&#x200B;

When I was eighteen, I started on weapons training. By the time I was twenty, I was accompanying my father’s former partner, Gary Whitlow on investigations.

&#x200B;

When I was twenty five, I was more than capable of overseeing those investigations myself.

&#x200B;

All my life, I’ve been preparing for the day I finally had to face down an enemy who had remained faceless ever since I was a child. After 27 years of preparation, I always thought that when that day came, I’d be fighting to protect the earth or to protect humanity. Something important. Something priceless. Yet there I was, watching the sun set on the day I’d been waiting for, knowing that there was a good chance I wouldn’t be alive when it rose again, ready to fight for just one girl.

&#x200B;

I guess in the end, I was right. I was fighting for something priceless.

&#x200B;

As Bea and I watched the sun set over the lake, she leaned against my shoulder. Despite everything we’d done to prepare, she was still afraid.

So was I.

&#x200B;

I saw a light move across the sky. It was too slow to be a shooting star. My body tensed a little at the sight of it, and I knew that Bea saw it too.

“In case I don’t get to say it later… the past couple of weeks have been the best of my life,” She said softly. It came out a little suddenly and I looked down at her, unsure how to respond at first.

“The next ones will be even better,” I finally said. She smiled at me, even if she knew I might not be able to keep that promise.

&#x200B;

A thick fog was drifting in off the lake. Something in my gut told me that it wasn’t natural. It was moving too fast, and something about the way that it moved seemed deliberate. The air around us seemed to get colder. A moment ago, the air in that room had felt normal for July. Now, it felt like December with the air conditioner on.

&#x200B;

I reached for my hunting rifle before moving away from the window and into the kitchen.

“They’re earlier than I expected,” Bea said.

“They’re just setting up,” I replied. Looking back, I could see that the fog had already completely obscured the window facing the lake and I could see it creeping past the other windows as well.

Bea went to the coffee table where she’d been tinkering with her device and turned it on. She adjusted the frequency to get it ready.

&#x200B;

The fog kept moving, drifting ominously past the other windows until even mine was blinded by it. We could see nothing. Only white. The cabin was silent. I swear I could even hear my heart racing in my ears as we waited for whatever would come next.

&#x200B;

Then I felt my phone buzzing in my pocket. I looked down, feeling my body tense up slightly. I hadn’t had a signal before and it didn’t make sense that I’d just gotten it back now either. I took my phone out of my pocket. The screen read: ‘*UNKNOWN CALLER.’*

&#x200B;

I looked at Bea, before answering it. I already had a good idea of who it would probably be.

*“You were smart not to run.*” Mr. Frost said, *“Things would have gotten messy if you tried… am I to assume that you’ll be cooperating with us this evening?”*

&#x200B;

“If you want Bea, you’ll have to get through me,” I replied. Mr. Frost just chuckled.

*“You have no idea how pathetically easy that would be,”* He said. *“I realize that you have… reservations, about complying with us. But think very hard on what you’re doing, Audrey. Resolving this with further violence would suit neither of our purposes. You and your organization are clearly formidable. But do not make the foolish mistake of believing that you can stand against the full might of the Supremacy. Give us the Specimen. We’ll even let you retain the information that she has shared with you. Let’s end this amicably.”*

&#x200B;

I hung up on him, before tossing the phone onto the counter.

“What did he say?” Bea asked.

“Exactly what I expected him to say,” I replied. “Get ready.”

The fog outside changed, taking on an electric blue color. Bea paused, before grabbing her device and heading toward the window to join me. I could see the shadows of the burned trees through the fog, lit from behind by the blue light. And between those shadows, I could see thin dark figures.

&#x200B;

They were here.

&#x200B;

Bea stared into the fog, before she adjusted the frequency of her device. More and more figures seemed to appear in between the trees.

“Here goes nothing…” She said under her breath before hitting the button.

&#x200B;

Nothing.

&#x200B;

More figures appeared, and I could see a few of them starting to get closer.

“No…” Bea said, looking up frantically as she adjusted the dial on her device, “No, it’s supposed to…”

&#x200B;

I felt my heart sink. I’d known that hinging all of our plans on that device of hers might not have been the brightest idea… but I’d still hoped it would work. Oh well… that’s what I got for being optimistic. Time for Plan B.

&#x200B;

Rifle in hand, I approached the window and took aim. There were already more figures in the trees than I could count. The rifle in my hands only held five rounds. Maybe I could get a reload in before they started shooting back, but I knew it wouldn’t be enough. We were outnumbered. Well… I suppose I can’t say that I was surprised that this was how I’d end up dying. I hoped that my father might at least be proud of me.

&#x200B;

I took the first shot, blowing out one of the windowpanes and hitting one of the figures square in the head. I watched them fall back, before hearing the hiss of returning gunfire. The kitchen windows shattered as I felt a ripple of heat wash past me. Bea screamed and dove under the counter, taking her device with her. She was still fumbling with the dial. I did the same, getting down so they couldn’t see me through the windows.

&#x200B;

The front door of the cabin was blown off of its hinges and I could see the silhouette of a figure standing in it. I saw its head turn toward me in the moment before I blew it off. I chambered another round to take care of the next one.

&#x200B;

I felt the cabin shake as a hole was blown in the wall behind the kitchen. They’d probably just gotten into what was supposed to be my bedroom. As I shot the next figure who came through the door, I saw two more coming into the kitchen from my right hand side, no doubt the first two who’d come in through the hole in the bedroom wall. Their guns were already raised. I took aim, gritting my teeth in cold defiance, hoping to kill at least one more…

&#x200B;

Then I heard it.

&#x200B;

A high pitched, electronic whine. The figures who’d just entered the kitchen seized up, almost as if they were in pain. I saw the gun drop out of one of their hands, before bursting into blinding flames. Sparks flew from the gun as it burned away to nothing… and I could see the owners body starting to smoke too.

“YES!” Bea cried, a split second before the two creatures who’d entered the kitchen violently caught fire.

&#x200B;

I half expected them to scream, but they didn’t make a single sound remaining eerily silent as they burned. They didn’t need to make a sound though. I could tell from the way that they thrashed and writhed that they were in *agony* and it was exactly as satisfying as I’d thought it would be.

&#x200B;

Light shone in through the windows as the others the Supremacy had sent after us burned. If I didn’t know any better, I would have said that it was as bright as the sun. The smell of burning filled my nostrils as I crawled over to the sink, pulling open the cupboard beneath it and grabbing the fire extinguisher we kept there. As satisfying as it was to watch the bastards burn, we were still in a cabin that was mostly made of wood.

&#x200B;

The extinguisher didn’t stop the bodies from burning. Whatever charge that they’d used as a failsafe to destroy their dead and lost weapons burned too hot for the fire extinguisher to do much about. But it kept the fire from spreading and in a few seconds, after whatever charge Bea had detonated finally died down, I was able to get the fire out completely. Finally, there was silence again. I looked over at Bea, who had an expression of both joy and complete bewilderment.

“Great timing,” I said.

She didn’t reply, just gave a hasty nod.

&#x200B;

I took the chance to reload my rifle before peeking out the broken window. It was hard to see anything through the fog, but the silence spoke volumes. There was nothing alive out there.

&#x200B;

On the counter, my phone buzzed again. Bea and I traded a look before I grabbed it to answer it.

“*That was a clever trick you pulled just now, but if you think it changes anything you’re wrong!*” Frost said. There was a hint of irritation in his voice. It almost sounded like I was getting under his skin. I wondered if he was still smiling.

&#x200B;

“Well, from where I’m sitting it changes the number of troops you’ve got to throw at us,” I replied. “You wanna send in your reserves and see how that goes for you?”

“*You aren’t the first to think that you can defy us, Audrey and you will not be the last either. Countless individuals from countless species before you have believed that they were taking a stand. All of them died meaningless deaths. You will be no different. We were here long before you. We will be here long after you decompose, and when you are gone we will not even remember your name.”*

&#x200B;

The blue light shone through the trees again.

“*See where your bravado gets you now,*” Frost spat before the call ended.

&#x200B;

“Now what?” Bea asked.

I had no answer for that. The light began to fade again, plunging the forest back into quiet darkness. I kept my gun at the ready.

&#x200B;

Bea hit the button on her device, before adjusting the dial.

“Nothing…” She said, after trying again. She tried the dial one more time before hitting the button and looking over at me.

I wasn’t sure what to think yet.

“What else could they send out?” I asked.

“I don’t know,” She admitted. “I never-”

&#x200B;

A distant scream coming from somewhere in the woods cut her off and I stood at attention, taking aim at the window. I still couldn’t see anything out there. The scream came again. It was hard to tell if this one was closer or further away.

&#x200B;

I looked over at Bea again, hoping that maybe she’d have some kind of answer. But she remained silent. Judging by the look on her face, she didn’t know what was out there any more than I did.

“Safe room,” I said quietly. “Now.”

&#x200B;

She didn’t need to be told twice. Standing up quietly, she made her way through the ruins of the kitchen and toward the stairs leading down to the basement. Outside, I heard something groaning and paused, turning in the direction of the noise. I saw a shadow lumbering past the windows, although I couldn’t clearly make out just what was out there. I could hear its labored breaths, though. It almost sounded as if it were in pain.

&#x200B;

Bea’s footsteps on the stairs told me that she was headed for safety, but I stood my ground. The shape lumbered toward the broken door, and I watched as it stopped in front of the doorframe. Even granted a proper view of it in what little light was available, I couldn’t definitely say what it was.

&#x200B;

It stood on two legs like a person, although its body was engorged and swollen. Its arms were long and thin, with fingers as long as its forearms. I could see patches of scales on its skin… or was it patches of skin among its scales. This whole thing looked cobbled together. Just *being* seemed like some form of torment for it… what the hell had they unleashed on us…

&#x200B;

The Creature wheezed before its pale yellow eyes fixated on me. Thick, wet drool dribbled out of its jaws and it was only when I looked at those jaws, that I saw something I recognized. Behind the thinly stretched skin of this creature's face, I recognized a human skull… and that was what made it all click.

&#x200B;

If Bea and Mr. Frost were among the more successful results of the Supremacy’s efforts at hybridization… this must have been one of the failures. Although this thing bore no resemblance to what a member of the Supremacy’s species should have looked like. It looked as if it were merged with something else entirely!

&#x200B;

Mr. Frost’s words crept back into my mind.

‘*Countless individuals from countless species before you have believed that they were taking a stand. All of them died meaningless deaths.’*

&#x200B;

Oh God… what the hell was this thing?

&#x200B;

The Abomination let out a guttural howl before it lumbered toward me. I raised my rifle and fired two shots at it. The first one tore off its lower jaw, although the creature didn’t even slow down. It just barreled forward mindlessly. I dove out of the way as it crashed into the wall where I’d been just a few moments before and shot it again. To my left, I heard another animalistic cry and through the door to what used to be my bedroom, I could see a second creature stumbling in through the hole in the wall.

&#x200B;

This one was different from the first, but just as horrible. It was scrawnier, with long forearms and a loping gait. Long, insectoid spines jutted out of its back. This one let out an animal hissing noise as it dragged itself through the door. The first Abomination was turning toward me again. Black blood dribbled down its bloated chest.

&#x200B;

I fired two more rounds at the bigger creature as it broke into a run again, charging blindly toward me. I only barely had time to get out of the way before I saw the second one coming for me as well. This one was faster, and the claws on its hands seemed sharper. Its bulging white eyes fixated on me as it let out an ear splitting shriek.

&#x200B;

I fired the rifles final shot into its head and watched one of those bulging eyes pop and only barely got out of the way as the thrashing creature hit the ground. I let the rifle drop from my hands as I grabbed my pistol. I put two more bullets in the scrawny creature, while the big one turned to charge at me again.

&#x200B;

Two more bullets aimed at it did nothing to dissuade it from continuing to lumber after me.

&#x200B;

Three gunshots echoed through the cabin. The large creature's head erupted into a cloud of gore, although it still stood. Two more bullet holes appeared in its chest, and I could see its skin ripping a little.

&#x200B;

I looked and saw Bea standing in the stairwell leading down to the basement, the .45 trembling in her hands and her device tucked under her arm. The larger creature continued to stand, before stumbling back a step, while the smaller one picked itself up again. It jerked erratically, its spines raking across the stomach of the larger creature and leaving deep gashes in its flesh.

&#x200B;

Its remaining eye fixated on me as it charged.

&#x200B;

Bea fired again, and I did the same. The creature just kept charging into the hail of bullets, but I saw its legs buckling as they gave out beneath it, I sidestepped it as it collapsed to the ground and skidded into the kitchen, crashing hard against the counter. Its body twitched, before finally going still. The larger creature was still standing, seemingly oblivious to its wounds. Bea and I looked back at it and watched it take a slow step forward. Its belly sagged outward as its skin split. It let out a weak gurgling noise as its entrails spilled out of it. The foul stench of decay filled my nostrils as it came undone at the seams and collapsed. I’m not sure if that killed it or not. But it wasn’t coming after us anymore.

The blue light from outside shone again and Bea and I looked back over toward the window.

“No…” I said under my breath, before heading for the window again. I looked up at the sky and saw whatever that blue light emanated from shining above the treeline. It levitated about fifty feet off the ground and it was difficult to properly make out the shape of it.

&#x200B;

Through the fog beneath the ship, I could see more shapes appearing amongst the trees. Fresh monsters to hunt us, now that we’d spent most of our ammo. I could see them wandering, trying to catch our scent. And I knew that we only had a few minutes before they did.

&#x200B;

Bea grabbed me by the arm, trying to pull me away from the window.

“Come on, we need to get downstairs!” She said.

I didn’t budge. The door to the safe room was sturdy, but I didn’t think it would hold against what was coming for us.

&#x200B;

“Audrey!” She begged, grabbing my hand to try and pull me with her. “Please!”

I looked back at the device under her arm, then my eyes met hers. Maybe it was the adrenaline. Maybe it was the desperation. Maybe I really was just an idiot.

&#x200B;

“The failsafe,” I said. “The ship would have one too, wouldn’t it?”

“What?” She asked.

“The ship, wouldn’t it have a failsafe, in case it went down?”

“Y-yes? I don’t know!”

“Find it, and trigger it!” I said.

&#x200B;

“But… I don’t know what frequency it’s on! That could take hours!”

“Just do it,” I said before pulling her into a kiss. As our lips met, I took the revolver from her.

“Go downstairs. I’ll buy you some time up here.”

I pushed her away. Bea looked at me, unsure what to say in response before running for the safehouse again.

&#x200B;

I checked the cylinder of the revolver. One bullet left. I didn’t know how many were left in my other pistol. This wasn’t exactly a lot as defensive options went… I’d need to get creative.

&#x200B;

I turned and headed for the door, firing a single shot from my pistol to try and get the attention of the things in the woods.

“Hey!” I called, “Over here, assholes!”

I could see the shadows moving in the dark and knew that they’d heard me.
