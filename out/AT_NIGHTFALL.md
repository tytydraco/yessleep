The sun slowly sank behind us, painting the sky with faded shades of gray and yellow, while the cold wind brushed against the back of our necks. Teresa walked with her head down, silent, just behind me. Mathias Santiago strode beside me, gripping his AK-47 as if it were an extension of his own body. The way he handled the weapon, with the confidence of a seasoned war veteran, spoke more about his past than any conversation ever could. I glanced at him for a moment and then shifted my gaze to Maria.

Maria was a brunette with deep brown eyes, tan skin, and straight hair that fell long over her shoulders. She was almost my age, perhaps around 20. Despite her youth, her eyes carried a burden that shouldn’t have been there. Nothing about any of us seemed young anymore.

We stopped at an old store in Mexico City. It was once one of the largest cities in the world, but now it was as empty as any other. The cold was biting—one of those days that should have been celebrated: January 1st, New Year's Day. But there was no celebration. No fireworks, no parties, no music. Just the silence of dead streets.

As we entered the store, I noticed there were still Christmas decorations scattered around: a dusty toy Santa Claus, a forgotten box of chocolates on a shelf. I carefully picked up the box and forced the lid open. Inside, I found a few chocolates and a chocolate Santa Claus.

“Want one, Teresa?” I asked, offering the chocolate.

“No, thanks, Ricardo.”

“Alright.”

I continued to explore the store. It was strange to see those Christmas promotions for a Christmas that never happened. On one of the old...

 I found a beer. I picked it up, but it was warm. I hate warm beer. Maybe I could cool it down in the river—a trick my uncle taught me when I was 14. We were on a farm when the power went out for two straight days. He showed me how to place the bottles at the bottom of the river to chill them.

The smell inside the market was the same as in almost every city we’d passed through: the stench of death, of decomposition. That odor seemed embedded in the air, impossible to escape. The cold was intensifying, and I glanced out the window as the sun sank slowly on the horizon. It was twilight, the moment when light dies to make way for darkness.

“Teresa, want a beer?” I asked again.

“No.”

Teresa looked about 30 years old, but after all she had seen and endured, she might have aged 50. She had lost everything: her family, her children, her husband... even the dog. Before all of this, she was a teacher, a kind woman who would never hurt anyone. Now, her eyes carried the weight of profound depression, a trauma that could never be healed.

I had been a psychologist before the Red Flu. I recognized the signs—not just in Teresa, but in Mathias too.

Mathias, at 30 years old, had the face of a 60-year-old veteran. He had lost everything. A former soldier in the Mexican army, he had watched his friends die in combat, saw his two-year-old son suffocate to death, and then lost his wife. It had shattered him inside.

“Mathias, let’s go.”

“I’m done grabbing the supplies.”

We exited the store, and I glanced at the sun, now almost gone beneath the horizon. The sky was gray, tinged with a faint yellow hue. It was cloudy, heavy, as if mirroring the emptiness around us.

On the street ahead of us, bodies were still scattered. We walked past them, stepping over the shadows of people who were once like us. Mexico City, once a vibrant, pulsing heart of life, was now an open-air cemetery.

Corpses were everywhere: inside houses, stores, restaurants, police stations. It didn’t matter where we looked—there were signs of the death that had swept across the world. We didn’t know if we were the last people alive, but since December, we hadn’t seen planes in the sky. No sign of life, no news—nothing. 

"Do you like beer, Maria?" I asked, trying to break the silence.  
"I don't drink."  
"More for me, then."

I shrugged and took a sip. I don’t like warm beer, but now it doesn’t matter. It’s what we have. Before the Red Flu, I would never have touched something like this. My habits were different. My life was different.

I was rich. Not just rich—filthy rich. My family owned several companies. Those glass towers in city centers? Some of them were ours. Our businesses employed thousands of people, and even at such a young age, I was already one of the wealthiest men in the country. We had mansions, luxury cars, private jets. My name was always in the society columns as the "promising young heir."

Money wasn’t an issue. If I wanted something, I got it. Expensive clothes? I bought them. Travel? I went wherever I wanted. I’d been to Tokyo, Paris, London. I’d been to places most people only dream of visiting. I’d had experiences that seemed straight out of a movie.

But now… now, money is absolutely worthless. It’s not even good for starting a fire or wiping your ass.

"Why do you carry that AK-47?" I asked Mathias, trying to push my thoughts away.

He didn’t have to think long to answer.  
"In case we meet someone."

I chuckled softly. It was a bitter laugh.  
"Someone? I find that hard to believe."

Mathias looked at me seriously.  
"It’s not impossible. We found Teresa and Maria, didn’t we?"

I didn’t want to argue, but deep down, I didn’t believe anymore.  
"It’s possible... but unlikely."

We kept walking. We left the empty streets behind and moved into the countryside, crossing forests and rivers. We decided to stop by a local river. The sound of the running water was almost comforting—something so simple, but now it felt precious.

As we set up the fishing rods, I sat by the riverbank. The smell of dampness was strong, mixed with the freshness of the trees. The air had never been so clean, so pure. It was ironic. Now that almost no one is left to breathe it, the air is perfect. I thought about this as I felt the fresh oxygen fill my lungs.

My mother used to say the world was a gift from God. A deeply religious woman, fanatical to the core. She believed everything had a... 

I looked at the fishing rod, the line moving with the current. I felt mosquitoes biting my hands, arms, neck—one after another. It reminded me of vacations in Acapulco, back when everything was different. My mother used to take us to the most luxurious hotels. Suites with soft beds, hot water, cold drinks. I remember my father joining us, always paying for the best as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

Now here I am, covered in bites, trying not to die of malaria while fishing for a measly fish. Maybe, with luck, one big enough to share.

My thoughts drifted back to that day in Acapulco. I remembered how that place felt. The warmth of the sun on my skin, the white sand, the salty smell of the sea. My mother loved that destination and made it a point to take us every summer. I was just a teenager the last time we were there.

We stayed in the best suite at the hotel. It had a view of the ocean, enormous beds, sheets so soft they felt like clouds.  
I remember sitting on the balcony, looking out at the sea. The hotel pool was full of laughing children, families having fun, couples walking hand in hand. There was music in the background—a band playing something light and cheerful. We ordered non-alcoholic cocktails, and I was fascinated by the way the waiter decorated the glasses with fruit and tiny colorful umbrellas.

One evening, we went to a seaside restaurant for dinner. The smell of grilled seafood mingled with the sound of waves crashing on the sand. My father ordered expensive wine. My mother smiled at him in a way I’ll never forget—a smile full of love and complicity. I watched them and felt safe, invincible. My younger sister, still a child, laughed while eating an ice cream that dripped down her fingers.

It was one of the happiest days of my life.

Now, sitting here surrounded by mosquitoes, I looked at my hands. Once, they held decorated cocktails. Now, they hold an improvised fishing rod in a desperate attempt to find something to eat. Back then, my biggest worry was which car I’d drive when we returned to the city. The days were so bright and sunny. I remember the happy families on the beach, the couples walking hand in hand, the parents playing... .with their children. And now, as I thought about it, a terrible thought crossed my mind: maybe all those people are dead. Maybe they’re just ghosts now, shadows that walked this world before the end.

Maria approached and sat down next to me.  
“Maria, do you think the world will ever go back to the way it was?” I asked, breaking the silence.

She looked at the stars shining in the sky, more visible than ever—a spectacular, seemingly infinite display of white dots.  
“No,” she replied simply.  
“Why not?” I pressed.

She took a moment to answer, as if arranging the words in her mind.  
“Because we won’t live long enough to see it happen.”

I fell silent. She rested her head on my shoulder, and I let her. There was nothing more to say.

I had everything once. Cars, private jets, trips to the other side of the world. My friends and I laughed, saying life was a party that would never end. My father, a cold and authoritarian man, used to tell me that money was everything. “The world revolves around money,” he’d say. Turns out, he was wrong.

He was one of the first to fall. Then my mother. Shortly after, my younger sister. Before I realized it, the entire city was dead. The plague spared no one: children, women, the elderly. It was relentless.

I looked at the river, watching the water carve winding lines into the earth. Everything felt so still. I touched Maria’s face and kissed her. It wasn’t passion, it wasn’t love. It was necessity—a lifeline to the humanity that still lingered within us.

As I kissed her, I remembered my parents. I remembered seeing them kiss in Europe, during family vacations. I remembered Tokyo, Rome, Venice. I remembered running to hug them, telling them I loved them. Now, all of that was gone.

The world will never be the same again.

I kept my eyes on the fishing rod, even with Maria leaning against me. The line started to pull. A jolt ran through my body, and I pulled hard. It was a big fish—big enough for all of us.  
“Looks like we’ll have dinner tonight.”
