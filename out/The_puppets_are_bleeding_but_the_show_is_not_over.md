 My mother was throwing a party. The Sicklers were over, as were the Wangs, and the Fertidas. That meant me and my sister Madeline were stuck cooped up in the basement with all of their offspring. 

It meant there would be an abundance of junk food at our disposal: large bowls of candy, popcorn, and chocolate were laid out on the coffee table accompanied by every type of soda you could imagine. 

It also meant there would be minimal supervision, so I guess it wasn’t all so bad.

The parents were getting loose. It was a sleepover night.

It was also an extra special occasion. My mother had just finalized her divorce from my father. The technicalities were still being ironed out, but I learned later that it was quite the messy settlement, with my mother set to make a killing off of alimony. Only the grown-ups were privy to this at the time, it was an adult matter for adult minds. But looking back, it made sense how the night unfolded: the jumble of priorities and lack of awareness, the release from the bitter entanglement, the particularly joyous celebration, and the reason for the show. Every mother has an off night. 

My father was gone, likely licking his wounds around a bottle of brandy. Travis was also gone, like most Friday nights. He had an active social life and was much older than Madeline and myself. It was his first year of high school so we rarely saw him on the weekends. 

The names of the children do not matter; I’ve all but forgotten their faces now. But I often wondered how the flurry of events affected them, whether they thought about that day late at night when the hidden undertow of our trauma tends to resurface. For me, it’s never gone away.

We used to live in an old Tudor manor. I still remember the lofty, white security gates and the cobblestone driveway. We were fortunate. We lived lives of privilege with all of the luxuries and protections that money could buy. That night, none of it could protect us.

We heard the doorbell ring a couple of hours into the party. Laughter erupted and waves of cheers flooded in from upstairs. There was banging against the countertops. All of us children stopped what we were doing and gravitated toward the foot of the stairs. 

The door swung open and there was my mother. She bolted down the stairs with a grin on her face and a familiar boy's hand interlocked with hers. 

“Are you kids ready for the surprise?” she asked with glee. There was a strange odor on her breath that I now understood as vodka.

The boy stumbled down the steps. His backpack bunched up the sparkling vest he was wearing. The black top hat teetered atop his head. With one hand, he was haphazardly clutching pieces of a wooden contraption to his chest and under his arms, the glimmering red drapes tied to the wooden planks swishing from side to side. 

The words slurred out of her, “I present to you, the star of the show!” She nudged the boy. “Go on, Pete. Introduce yourself.”

“Hi kids. I’m Peter, the Puppetmaster.” The boy's intro carried an underwhelming breath of uncertainty.  

Madeline cheered along with some of the other children. My mother clapped so hard that her hands were a blur. 

She said, “Enjoy kids!” before she barreled back upstairs. The music and laughter dissipated with a definitive thud. Peter was left to entertain us. 

He scoped out the location, eventually circling back around and setting up the stage by the entrance of the stairs. As the rest of the kids fought for prime seating, he slotted the blocks of wood into various notches and grooves and unfolded the characters from his pockets, laying them on the shelf hidden behind the drawn velvet curtains. The stand looked make-shift: there were oil stains on the wooden legs and the drapes looked like they had been ripped from old curtains, dusty and frayed. Rusty nails jutted out of some of the planks in twisted spirals.

He stared at the ground. “Um…So could everyone please gather round?”

The rest of the kids sat cross-legged by the set. I remained on the sofa, the cartoons blaring in the background. 

“Why?” I asked. “You’re not magic or something.“

The boy was jittery. Still looking down, he politely repeated his request.

“Why?”

“Because you’re going to miss the show.”

“So what?” I said, combatively. “You go to my brother's school.” I pointed at him, chuckling, “This is going to be lame. He’s just a dumb high schooler.” 

A couple of the kids snickered.

“So you’re going to miss out on the fun?”

“Yup,” I nodded. “It looks boring.” More giggles came from the crowd. 

Madeline glared back at me. “Dillon—come on. Be nice.”

I ignored her and focused on the television. 

Peter stood up and snatched the remote from the table. He killed the power and strode back to the theatre. “Suit yourself, kid.”

I sat there like a stubborn brat, all of the jelly beans and M&M’s to myself. I fiddled with my brother’s 3D puzzle while the show began. But out of the corner of my eye, I watched with curiosity. 

The jungle backdrop taped to the back wall looked like a low-resolution image clipped from the internet. Peter hid behind the backdrop, only the tip of his hat poking out. A golden lion wobbled on stage, its googly eyes bouncing back and forth, its tail bobbing with every clumsy step. 

“Hi everybody. My name’s Leon.” He was hardly a trained voice actor, but he tried his best to elevate his voice in a cartoon-like cadence. 

The group clapped excitedly, waving to the sock with the stitched smile and string-filled mane.

“Has anyone seen my family?” 

One of the boys shouted from the back row, “What do they look like?”

“Hmm…good question!” he replied.  “Well…they are big. And furry.” The lion turned around and shook his behind. “And they have a big long tail, just like me.” The yellow fabric flopped around to hysterical laughter. I caught a thin smile spreading across my face before I tightened up my lips.

“Shhh. Not too loud. Or they’ll find Leon.”

“Don’t you want to find them?” Madeline asked.

“No.” The lion’s voice softened. “Leon’s hiding. Can you help me hide?” Leon darted from side to side on stage, bending over and popping back up from crouched positions. “How about this tree?” Some of the kids giggled as the lion let out hushed, tired growls. “Or this one? Does it look safe?”

A kid with a booger in the front row asked, “Don’t you miss your mom and dad?” 

The lion let out a low growl and seemed to shrink. I looked at the other's puzzled faces. 

Madeline stood up and rushed the stage, gripping the lion to her chest. “Don’t cry, Leon.” A couple of the other children joined the embrace. 

“Aww. Thank you, kids. Thank you.”

They sat back down, and Leon whispered, “Can you all keep a secret?”

We replied, “Yes.” I tossed the puzzle to the floor and watched intently from the sofa.

“Are you sure?”

“Yes!” we screamed. 

“Okay, stay seated everyone, and please be quiet. I’ll tell you the story of why Leon is so afraid.” Peter’s other hand swiftly yanked the curtain shut across the stage. We waited patiently, sounds of shuffling coming from behind the veil. In a quick blur, the curtains were drawn again, and the forest was replaced by an inky black canvas.

“You see, Leon’s father was the leader of the pride. He was the biggest, meanest lion of them all.”

A photo of a group of lions—the alpha male in the middle with his jaw stretched in a mighty roar—popped up from the corner of the stage. It was attached to a popsicle stick.

“A lion was supposed to be fierce. He was supposed to have courage. He was supposed to be strong. To survive as a lion, you needed all of these things that Leon never had.”

On the other side of the stage, a puppet crept up slowly. Its head drooped down to the floor in a defeated stance. It was a white sock with familiar googly eyes, sharp ears, and sharpie-drawn whiskers. “You see, deep down, Leon never was a lion. But he tried his best to play the part.” The white cat disappeared and the puppet we knew as Leon popped up in his place. He roared in a loud bellow that startled the front row of children. 

“Leon grew up with the other lions, protected by his father’s prowess and his mother's love. But the day would finally come when Leon had to leave the pride. It would be his turn to find a pride of his own to lead.”

Slowly, the picture of the lions disappeared. Only Leon and the darkness remained. 

“Leon was supposed to be strong. But he wasn’t. He was scared. And when the day came for Leon to be on his own, the more he traveled through the jungle alone, the more the voices frightened him.” 

Erratic whispers crawled from behind the jungle. Too many voices for one man to make. They started soft like white noise, steadily morphing into unhinged ramblings and shrill shrieks. A few of the girls screamed. 

I tried my best to focus on the words, but they were jumbled and incoherent. As quickly as they floated in, they disappeared, and Leon the lion continued across the stage in a cautious traipse. 

“Leon searched the jungle tirelessly for a pride where he could belong. But no one gave him a chance.”

Another photo of a group of lions popped up, their backs turned toward Leon.

“I’m going upstairs,” a young boy with shaggy hair said.

“Nobody moves!” Peter hissed from behind the curtain. 

“I need to use the potty,” he pleaded.

“Sit down. Now.” 

The boy dropped like his legs gave out. 

We stared, wide-eyed at each other, hoping that an adult had heard the commotion. The bass from the speakers upstairs kept pounding. 

Peter cleared his throat and his words rolled back into Leon’s goofy tone. “For this next part, I’d like a volunteer. Would anybody like to assist poor Leon?”

Nothing but frightened gazes looked back at him, all of us frozen in our seats. 

“How about you, young lady? This is your party, correct?”

He pointed to Madeline. She said yes, pausing in contemplation before finally drifting toward the stage with tiny, wary steps. 

“Thank you, Miss. Would you step back here for a moment?”

Madeline nodded, vanishing behind the backdrop. 

A beige sock appeared from the corner of the stage. It had a crude drawing of gnarly teeth, the flat snout of a dog, deep brown spots, and impossibly dark eyes. Its round paper ears were missing glue, barely clinging on to the cotton by the corners. Strands of hair were glued in tufts around the sock like a cancer patient’s withering hairline.

Leon approached from the opposite corner. “See, Leon had been sheltered his whole life. He soon discovered that there existed more than lion problems in the world. In the big, bad jungle, there were animals of many species. Many breeds, which were crueler and meaner than any of the lions he had ever encountered.”

In a quick burst, a glimmer of steel flashed the stage. The savage swipes were direct, too quick for the poor hyena to react to. 

Madeline squealed helplessly. The polished blade shone with a thin layer of blood.

“Can’t you see that Leon is a lion?”

Madeline cried in agony. Wiild growls came from behind the backdrop as Leon swayed with each stabbing motion of the knife. 

I sprinted from the sofa, side-stepping the stand and stomping up the steps. 

“How does it feel? You’re not laughing now!”

The kids' screams were deafening.

“Have you learned? That is not how you treat a lion!”

“What is going on here?” my mother's voice cried from the top of the stairs. I stood behind her, grabbing the back of her leg. 

Madeline couldn't speak, she just opened up her palms and ran. The blood soaked my mother's white frilly dress, the one she wore solely to parties. 

The puppet was still attached to her little hand. She winced as my mother removed the drenched garment carefully; her palm had gouges as deep as canyons. A river of blood leaked from the wounds, dripping to the floor as quickly as the tears that fled from her eyes. 

Peter emerged from behind the makeshift puppet stand, his hands in the air. The right hand that hid in Leon’s sock now was covered in blood. Deep gashes were protruding from the shredded wool.

The words shakily traveled from his lips, “I tried to stop her, Miss. Clarett. I tried…” 

“Everybody upstairs!” my mother ordered.  

The music died. The parents held their precious, quivering offspring in their arms. My mother held us too, a hand towel wrapped around my sister's hand. The bleeding wouldn’t stop. 

It would be the last time the other families ever associated themselves with my mother, the last time their children would ever speak to us. 

Peter pleaded his case, but the jury of concerned mothers and fathers offered skeptical expressions. There was no way the gravity of the wounds could have been caused by the safety scissors he was wielding. But he stuck to the story. 

Peter didn’t want to leave. He kept saying there was one more act; he wanted the children to see the finale. 

My mother paid the boy his money and he left in the back of his father's squad car. They took down the information, and we were rushed to the hospital to stitch up Madeline’s hand. 

It was a good thing, too, because my mother received the call around midnight that Travis had been admitted. He had been attacked in the park hours before the party, walking to his friend's place as night fell. He was spotted in the bushes by a stroke of luck, the curious snout of a canine. The dog walker called the ambulance, afraid for the boy's life. The blood loss was substantial. 

My parents were reunited in the emergency ward in an awkward embrace, juggling their time between the two rooms.

The timeline seemed to match up perfectly–Peter living a block away from the park and the warnings Travis had received for his less than deferential treatment of the boy at their school–but the story just seemed to go away. The last thing we heard about Peter was that he had been shipped to military school by his father. Madeline would never be able to forget him due to the scars she had suffered.

Years later, when I was in high school, I received a direct message from an unknown account. It was the day of my mother’s funeral. My siblings and I receive these messages now on occasion: burner accounts with random arrays of letters and numbers as display names, email accounts with strange addresses. 

The communication medium is different, but the sentiment of the messages is all the same. 

*The show is not over.*
