My name is Axel and I manage the Drowsy Spectre, a café positioned in a place that should get little business. Well, little human business, that is. But even our kind of clientele can become mundane once you figure it out. Wink at the store cat if she is staring at you for more than ten seconds, give the fly man shit (not literally, you’ve just got to make fun of him). Everything becomes somewhat normal only to be flipped when someone breaks the rules, or when something new comes by.  

I would much prefer things stay mundane in a place like this. New customers are the most common offender. Sometimes, however, problems appear from seemingly thin air.

\--------------------------------------

For the record, I have tried to get rid of the candle. It hasn’t done anything, but no matter what I do it comes back. Tossed it in the trash, threw it out the window, drove it down the highway and tossed it into the woods; it didn't matter. I was even going to try to give it away or sell it but I swear no one ever drives on this highway. No one is answering their damn doors in my apartment complex either.

Years ago I owned a doll that would grant wishes. I got it because I willingly accepted it from someone else and those rules apply to most supernatural objects, cursed or otherwise. Ownership occurred voluntarily. Staring at the candle, however, makes me wonder about the morals of handing off something that filled me with such dread. I took the candle of my own free will, after all. Figuring out how to manage it was my job. As far as I could tell, it wasn’t inherently dangerous. Owning it, having it around; that was fine.

Amber wanted me to light the wick. So I got rid of all my matches, lighters, and anything else that could possibly be used to produce a flame.

I mean, I kept my oven. I am being reasonable. 

Anyway, we have four employees working behind the counter at any given time. Back when Selene was manager, there were five of us *in* the building– she stayed in the office– but staffing is difficult these days. No more clocking in and sitting at my desk the entire shift. It was better that way in the long run, I suppose, as I can keep much better tabs on the shifting rules of the shop. 

I suppose it would be best to give you the new list as you follow along. Plus, who knows if you might end up here yourself. Though, most of these won’t apply to you even if you were here.

First; don’t open the drive thru unless there is a customer in a car. There is a giant, Tall Ben, that will try to lure you to break this rule. An extension of said rule includes not going outside if he is around. Second is to not open the door unless you hear five knocks. Anything else will undoubtedly get you killed and put everyone else in danger. Third, open and close the store on time. That one is for me. 

Fourth is to not buy candles from Amber, or even speak to her. Obviously I screwed that one up. Did that on day one, actually. Spoke to her the moment we met. I guess, all in all, I am a poor pick for manager.

Fifth is to roast the fly when he is leaving. Just once per person, any more and it gets bad. Six? The bathroom is for employees and paying customers only. 

Seven is about an old coworker. No one is to speak to the man named Barrow. I wrote that one myself. You know about number eight, telling Smiles goodbye when he is leaving.

But the most recent addition is number nine. Count heads on the hour. Like I said earlier, we have a set number of people working. So, when I was designating stations at the beginning of the day, I put Jessie in the kitchen, Henry on the drive thru, Carlie on front counter, and James on dishes. I was working the bar, of course. 

All five people accounted for. It was a dead shift, as per usual, and if we were a regular cafe by any measure then I would have sent a few people home. Richard didn’t really come by his shop anymore. In fact, I hadn’t seen him in years. He managed distantly and I found that, as a manager, I had more power than I would have expected. I felt more like the owner than Richard did. How long had it been since the man did anything himself around the cafe? It was a phone call that saw me ascend to store manager. I’m the one that hired new staff, paid them, handled inventory. 

Had Selene done as much work as I was expected to? No wonder she was so closed off.

Typically, on most shifts, drive thru handled dishes. Considering how dead it was, I sent our front counter worker to sweep and then had Henry work on cleaning in the back. Keeping things tidy wasn’t just part of having a job; some customers *really* cared about the state of the cafe. Just because some creatures weren’t consistent enough to make the rule list doesn’t mean they aren’t dangerous. There is one particular woman– I don’t know her name, so we just called her The Maid– who will restrict entire rooms until they are cleaned to her satisfaction. Obviously that can be dangerous if closing time comes and we are trapped behind the counter while she scrubs baseboards. She’ll scrub anything that doesn’t belong, including people. Seen one poor new hire scrubbed down to the bone, screaming all the while, his bones dissolved into suds before being washed away with a sponge.

Every hour saw everyone go over their chores. Clean tables, sweep, check if anything needs mopping. Those sort of things. Keeping up with cleaning so often meant there was little to actually do. Dishes should have been a quick finish and I was beginning to wonder what the hold up was. Dishes were a quick finish too but for reasons unknown they were taking a long time to finish up.

Smiles finally left and I was certain to tell him goodbye. Being so distracted keeping an eye on his movement, I had forgotten the hourly head count. Not that big a deal. Hourly was overkill anyway but I called everyone up just to be safe.

Carlie was the first to answer. “Yeah?”

“Head count.”

“Uh, duh.” When Jessie didn’t come up, she raised her voice. “Jessie! Head count!”

Jessie removed her earbud. “What?”

“Head. Count.”

“Oh!” She dropped the earbud on the counter and sprinted up front. Well, she *tried* to sprint. Jessie was hardly the first person with allergies to work at the cafe, but hers were the most extreme. No matter her station– which was typically kitchen– she insisted on wearing her strange outfit to protect herself. Even the slightest traces of anything she was allergic to (something she remained vague when asked specifics), and I do mean miniscule, can cause severe burning. She comes in looking like she is going to see the elephant’s foot down in Chernobyl.

She’d only be missing a mask.

Plastic wrapped gloves tapped tight to her wrists, a coat protecting her body that was taped to her pants. Her shoes were wrapped too but that was only because she didn’t want anything staining them. We all told her she should just avoid bright, brand new white shoes but she insisted on wearing them anyway.

Each step came with the sound of crumpling plastic.

James showed up behind her. Was he finally done with dishes? “Alright. One, two, three. And I am four.” With our numbers double checked, I was satisfied.

Movement to my left caught my attention. Out the window stood Tall Ben, looming at the corner to peer inside. He waved, saying something I couldn’t hear in a bid to lure me out. 

“James, if you clean the bathrooms I will finish your dishes.”

James shrugged, accepting Carlie’s offer. “Sure. But… uh… I wouldn’t use the dishwasher. Isn’t cleaning properly.” I didn’t know anything about that. Was probably just clogged or something. James just stood there awkwardly after Carlie left. 

“Mind doing that now, James?”

“No problem.” He looked down at his hands, then wandered off without grabbing the proper supplies.

“James? Forgetting something?” I pointed at the cart where there was a tupperware with gloves. “Were you going to clean the toilet bare handed?”

He tried laughing back but it came out nervous. “No, no. That would be weird.” James snatched up the gloves.

Carlie appeared in the kitchen doorway, her face pale. “Um… Axel?”

Her tone served as a terrible preview to the coming news. “What happened?”

“You’ll have to come see.”

The dishwasher was indeed clogged. A whole person, all bent up and crushed, was stuffed into the square machine. It was no small feat as the washer was no larger than one you’d find at home. Blood seeped out of the corners, mixed with suds and water so that it ran freely. Someone had tried to run it after the body was stuffed inside.

“What the hell?!” James had his hands in his hair. He was new and hadn’t seen the worse things that came with the job. “Who is that?!”

While I couldn’t recognize the person at all, their clothes were familiar. Being no stranger to violence and gore, I gave what I thought was an arm a good tug. With a gross crunch it came free, the body slumping slightly, but the corpse wouldn’t come out that easily. 

“They’re still warm.” I thought aloud. “But I don’t remember anyone else coming in. Did someone open the back door?”

Everyone shook their heads. “And we’ve done the head count. There are only four of us here.” Jessie added. “Is this a new… thing? Like a new rule or something?” She leaned forward to peek inside the machine. “You said not to wash the little glass things. Did someone put the wrong dishes in there or something?”

Trying to be helpful and being helpful were two different things. A wrong dish wouldn’t cause a whole body to materialize inside the dishwasher! “I don’t think that’s it.”

The front door opened, sounding a chime. I sighed and closed the dishwasher. “Look, just… don’t use the dishwasher for now. I’ll figure it out in a minute.”

I headed back up front. It might seem cold, but I don’t know which was worse; finding a dead body in a dishwasher, or seeing Smiles waltz back through the door. 

“Hey Axel!” His tone suggested they shared some grand secret by having the same name. “How’s it going?”

I ignored him as he went about his motions. Checking the gift section, wandering around the shop, changing what table he sat at. Despite already having come in that night, he made sure to ask the same questions. Did we have any seasonal specials? Any monthly specials? Anything secret that I would recommend? Almost recommended he go say hi to Tall Ben. I’ve no doubt that the giant would make short work of the reverse vampire should Tall Ben have any interest at all. 

Most of the supernatural creatures around here did not capture Ben’s eye. Regular humans were his favorite, but he’d go after anything that was considered an employee.

I could just hire smiles and then get rid of him. That was an entertaining idea.

His questions grew too irritating, so I tried something. “Goodbye, Axel.”

“See ya, Axel!” He replied, leaving immediately. 

It was a silver lining to the night, knowing I could actually banish him at any time of my choosing. With no more customers in the building, I returned to the dish pit to investigate the corpse. Though I had told them to leave it alone, I found Jessie yanking the body free of the machine. One last tug saw the man wrenched out, his mangled remains toppling to the ground like a tangle of twigs and mud. Only it was bones all knotted together and squishy, blood-soaked guts rather than mud. 

“Done!” She chimed and, at my irritated stare, lifted her blood-soaked gloves. “I’m the only one geared for this.”

“You’re geared to make food.” I corrected. “And you can’t make food like that.”

She looked down and past her hands, realizing just how far the gore had gotten on her. “Oh… oh yeah.”

I rubbed my eyes. “Go and clean up in the bathroom.” Though I knew there was no way she was going to actually get it all off.

“Okay.” She hissed at her own mistake. “Sorry.”



\--------------------------------------



Without the ability to identify the body, it became an inconvenience rather than a mystery. There were other rules to follow, after all, and more customers filtering in one at a time. After another head count on the hour, I sent my two coworkers back to their stations. Kitchen and dishes shared by James, while Carlie oversaw front and drive thru. It might have been more convenient with more people but, more times than not, it was dead at the cafe. I get that it was an expense without return but I still made a mental note to call Richard. It wasn’t like he was making money off of the business anyway; most of the customers didn’t even pay with any usable currency.

When the door chimed, I expected some oddity from the dark. Instead I saw what seemed like a completely normal person. Sometimes normal people *were* easy to tell apart from the supernatural thanks to one key attribute;

They were unreasonably rude.

“Bathroom.” The bald man snapped.

“It's in the back.” I replied, not resisting him. There were rules to follow, however. “It is for paying customers only, I am afraid.”

“Really, man? It is, like, 2:00am. Just let me take a piss!”

“Buy literally anything. Can’t budge on this one.”

From his perspective, I was being stingy. If only he knew that a dollar stood between him and oblivion. “Fine. Fine! Here!” He tossed a few coins on the counter.

Money wasn’t all of it. He needed to *buy* something.

“What do you want?”

“I don’t care!” He threw his hand. “A cookie, or whatever! Give me the key!”

“It isn’t locked. Go ahead.”

His eyes seemed ready to pop from his head but he couldn’t stay and chew me out. The man sprinted to the back and the bathroom door slammed shut. Carlie came to the front from cleaning the far room windows, staring towards the bathroom. “What’s his deal?”

“Didn’t want to pay.”

She sneered. “Should have just let him go in there anyway.”

Carlie voiced my inner thoughts. “Yeah.” But, in reality, I feared what would happen if too many people disappeared. We were already responsible for multiple deaths. Well, not responsible in the sense that it is our fault, but this location has seen its fair share of disappearances. No cops, though. No government authorities, no local investigations. It was like no one cared at all. That, or they didn’t notice, and both were the same thing in my eyes.

James arrived from the kitchen. “What’s his deal?”

I was struck with deja vu. “This guy wanted to use the bathroom.”

“Why make a fuss over it?” 

People forgot the rules so easily. “He didn’t want to buy anything.”

“And that made him mad? Or… *you* mad?”

“Well, you know the rules.”

“Ah, of course.” James tapped his forehead. “Duh.”

The customer came charging out of the bathroom, his pants sagging as he hurried in a rage. “What the hell?!” He pointed backwards. “What is leaking from the ceiling?! This place is disgusting!”

He stormed out of the cafe but I paid him no mind, instead turning to the bathroom. I approached it cautiously and heard the thick plop of fluid falling from the ceiling. To be fully honest I expected red. In my experience, strange fluid that didn’t belong was almost always blood. Though I can’t say I was pleasantly surprised to find a puddle of pure white gathering on the floor. An askew ceiling panel was soaked above me, steadily dripping down. 

“Hey Carlie?” I shouted. “Can you bring me the ladder?”

I climbed up with the two of them watching. With all the caution I could muster, I tried to move the panel. It wouldn’t budge as I could feel a heavy weight resisting me. A wobbling of the ladder saw me under a different panel and I lifted it to get a peek inside.

As it turned out, my original instincts had been correct. There was a mangled body staring back at me but rather than bleeding red, she leaked white. After finding the man inside the dishwasher, seeing another dead body wasn’t a shock. The white blood was weird but not weird enough. I gave the corpse a few tugs and she came toppling out of the ceiling, crashing to the floor with a sick thud.

There was an odd crunch too and only then did I notice she was almost completely wrapped in plastic. Shoes, jacket, gloves, even part of her head. Most of the plastic was torn apart thanks to her mangling but that gave me an unexpected clue; for some reason she was dressed in the plastic wrap *before* her violent demise. Her neck was torn open, her face gouged, her body and arms maimed, and the only thing left untouched on her body were a set of unreasonably white shoes. Just like the boy in the machine, I didn’t recognize her at all. 

I raced through my brain trying to remember what in mythology could bleed white but nothing came up. 

“Two in one night.” James clicked his tongue. “That is abnormal, isn’t it?”

“Yeah.” My brain was busy.

“Want to just toss her outside?”

I looked at him. He was cold. Then again, so was I and he probably learned it from me. “No, not until I have a chance to find out who–”

The woman took a shuddering breath. With it came a horrible popping sound as her broken body resisted her. Wide eyes danced around the room, making contact with first Carlie, then me, then James. They froze on James, then kept going between him and I. She was trying to form words but, thanks to her shattered throat, nothing would come out. Gurgling and sputtering, completely unable to move her arms, she tried to communicate something that I could not understand.

Carlie shoved James. “And you wanted to put her outside!”

“Look at her!” He countered. “There is no way she is surviving that! How the hell is she alive, anyway?”

“She’s not human.” The conclusion was obvious. And, just as obvious should have been my suspicion of her. Strange bodies, inhuman things needing help; these usually ended in trickery and someone getting hurt. My instincts, however, told me that the woman– whatever she was– had no such intentions.

She looked truly afraid.

Despite the obvious mess, we moved her to my office. She cried out all the while as it became apparent that being non-human did not spare her from pain. How I was supposed to help her get better at all was a complete loss to me. Could she be the cause for the bathroom rule, or a symptom of it? 

I had to go behind the bar and trust she wouldn’t try anything in our absence. Another customer came in, one with a simple rule of getting a very hot drink. I mean, like, to the point that the milk is evaporating. They thanked me, stuck it in their coat pocket without spilling one drop, and left. In the absence of either workers or customers, I got to thinking. If the woman wasn’t part of the bathroom rule or some symptom of it, then how did she get in there in the first place? I would have seen her buy something. If she didn’t buy anything, she wouldn’t exist anymore. There were no exceptions to that rule.

That is, unless she was clocked on. Obviously that was impossible, though, as she wasn’t an employee. I would know. We did head counts for a reason.

With that thought, and it being almost 3:00am, I called James up. Honestly, it was a stupid requirement. There were only two of us on any given shift. Me up front and James in the kitchen. Super short staff, I know, but it is very slow. Why did we even have a head count rule? James would come up, I’d count one, and then he would go back. What a dumb idea.

Rules were rules, however, so when James didn’t come up at my call I went looking for him.

Nothing in the kitchen, which was odd.

The dish pit was separated by a wall. There was silence. In my line of work, complete silence was a bad sign.

My feet froze at the doorway.

Carlie was held aloft by long appendages. Fingers stretched far too long than should have been possible, wrapping around her arms like vines, only if the vines had bony joints that moved in total silence. Even my own feet didn’t make noise. There was some sort of spell on the room that sapped all noise away, muting everything.

Including me opening the knife drawer. 

At first I thought it was James’s fingers that were bent and stretched out but, upon a slow approach, I realized it was his ribcage that had opened. The ribs formed long appendages that bit into Carlie’s skin, latching on to the bones inside. 

She was bound in silence, slowly being broken as he bent her arms backwards. It was James! He stuffed the man in the washer and then the woman in the ceiling. I raised the knife and hoped that it would have some effect on him. It was made of metal, after all, and most supernatural things from across the sea didn’t like iron.

I sank it into his back, slipping between the bones to find soft organs.

The spell lifted immediately.

Carlie slammed to the ground as James’s ribs retracted. He went completely normal, turning around as if there wasn’t a knife protruding from his back. 

“Axel, I found her!” He tried. “I don’t know how she is doing it, but she killed the man and the woman! She’s got to be some kind of mimic, or something. It has been Carlie the entire time!”

That much was true. She looked up at me, bleeding from multiple holes, and she was afraid. The thing is, she is a mimic, and she’s been working for me for two years now. She’s a survivor where most failed. But mimics were among the most dangerous threats from out in the dark. Untrustworthy, devious, and long suffering if it meant a good meal in the end. She knew I didn’t trust her, not fully. She saw it on my face and was once again reminded that she was not human, no matter how hard she tried, she just wasn’t. 

And no matter how long she tried to convince me that she shared some sense of human morality, that she wasn’t out to kill us all, that she wanted a friend, there was still that doubt.

I blinked. “Who is Carlie?”

The mimic drew a long breath. “Me.” She tried. “I’m Carlie.” Her voice was hurt, and not just from the wounds.

“Look.” James began. “I get the confusion so, uh, don’t worry about this.” He gestured at his back, where the knife was still stuck. Had I done that, or was it the mimic on the floor? James seemed to be breathing fine despite the wound. Of course he was; I hired non-humans more often than not. “I… I think I should just go take a look at this real fast. Take it out, or whatever. Then you and I can discuss this whole thing in my office?”

His office. Of course. I would need to give my account and, if it *was* me that stabbed him, he’d probably write me up to Richard even if it hadn’t truly harmed him. Even if I was just confused amid all the chaos, violence between employees wasn’t warranted. It made me dangerous.

“Right.” I sighed. “Okay. Want me to wait for you there?”

“Why don’t you watch the front for a minute while I get this out and, uh, we can talk about your insubordination afterwards?”

I nodded and hoped my easy compliance would smooth things over. “Right. Sounds good.” I turned to go up front as James made his way towards the nearby bathroom. Before I went, however, I looked down at the mimic on the ground. She hadn’t changed forms, which was abnormal for a severely wounded mimic. Their true form was that of the forest– wood and vines, all tangled together as if their mimicry was the fault of odd shadows cast against the faint outlines of the wild and untamed. 

But the mimic, whatever her name was, didn’t turn back. How odd. Sure, my manager told me to go up front and keep an eye on things, but it felt odd to leave a dangerous mimic just sitting in the back of the shop. 

“He’s… he’s…” She tried, but couldn’t get the thought out. 

Whatever she had to say was probably bad for my ears, so I turned to leave. I’d get things smoothed over with James in the office and then finish off the shift as normal. They certainly weren’t the first threat to grace the cafe and they wouldn’t be the last. I’d gotten through a lot of trouble throughout the years. Sometimes it was from enemies in the dark, and other times it was friends in the light. Barrow, Selene, Em, John. The old crew. Sometimes they got me into it, sometimes they helped me out. I missed them.

I had a good feeling about the meeting with James. A *really* good feeling. Just… felt like all my problems would be gone once we got it over with. Maybe it wasn’t a reprimand, but instead a raise. I did take action after all.

The sound of the bathroom door clicked shut.

I turned around. Carlie was on the floor, bleeding from the many holes throughout her arms. I hurried to help and she flinched, trying to scramble away at my approach.

“What happened?!”

“The… the other mimic.” She grinned and laughed. “He went into the bathroom.”

“Other mimic?”

“James. He isn’t an employee and didn’t buy anything.” Carlie spat out blood. Her injuries were internal, too. “Now he’s gone. He almost had you, Axel. He almost had you.”

No, he *did* have me. I was completely under his spell. “But…” It was starting to come back to me. “How? How did he get here? We do head counts every hour.”

“And how many heads did we count?”

Four! It was always four! “Where is everyone else?”

Henry was stuffed by the back door, crushed beyond recognition. Only his clothes allowed me to identify him. James manipulated me with some strange spell, forgetting him completely until he was taken. There was no helping him but I remembered the woman in the office, the one that we left in a very similar state.

She was still there, albeit a bit better than before. Jessie wasn’t bleeding as badly as she had been. 

“He’s gone.” I promised. “It is over.”

“W-water…” She managed to get out. “R-running w-w-water.”

I wheeled her chair into the sink area. Carlie was, all things considered, recovering quickly. I turned on the tap of the hand sink, the mop sink, and the dish sink to create as much flowing water as I could. 

Jessie closed her eyes as her body was wrapped in a strange cocoon, as if invisible spiders swaddled her in silk from head to toe. 

We closed up the shop but the three of us stayed in the lot at dawn, guarding the Jessie-cocoon as she finished whatever process she was going through. I hoped she didn’t need to stay around the running water because that was impossible considering the hour.

It appeared that wasn’t a requirement, however, as by noon she was breaking free of the hardened silk blanket. Her plastic wrap was still torn, her clothing coated in what looked like dried paint, but she was. Her body was made new. No more broken joints, no more snapped legs, but her voice came out very weak. 

“I’m…” She began and paused. “I am not human.”

“Yeah, we gathered as much.” I laughed. 

“You’re a fairy.” Carlie revealed what we had assumed. Though she was the sort of fairy that I had seen before. Those bled red and certainly didn’t get wrapped up in cocoons, at least not that I’ve heard of. 

Jessie shrugged. “Yeah.”

“And that is why you wear all the stuff in the kitchen, because of the metal!” It seemed so obvious to me and I felt stupid. She was hardly the first fairy I've worked with.“Fairies have an aversion to iron.”

“It is more than that. I have an allergy.”

“What?”

“Like… the regular fairy stuff with iron, but worse. I have an iron allergy too.”

“Oh.” I didn’t know that was possible. “Fairies can have allergies?”

“Apparently."

And that explained the plastic wrap in the kitchen and her insistance on using plastic knives. Still, with all the wrapping, I would have thought she'd be safe from any allergin– supernatural or not. 

Back home I thought long and hard regarding what happened. We had a few years where things were good. Hell, damn near normal. Sure we had some deaths but they were never due to my negligence. I can’t stop people from breaking rules. We had done head counts, though. We followed the rules and, despite that, we had almost died. Henry *was* dead. We did everything right and we still failed. I didn’t even beat the mimic! He just happened to go into the bathroom and that just *happened* to be a bad thing for him to do. Random chance saved us and that wasn’t something I could rely on. Twice this month we had severe events and it was getting worse. While Carlie might not be the same kind of mimic as James, she was still of the same order. Maybe she would know their weaknesses? Would she share them after I turned on her under James’s spell?

I wouldn’t blame her if she didn’t.
