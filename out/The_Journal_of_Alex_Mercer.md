The journal was found partially buried beneath a thick layer of moss and pine needles, its pages stained and warped. Despite extensive searches, no trace of Alex Mercer or his companions has ever been found. Forest rangers reported unusual phenomena during the recovery, including disorientation, unexplained whispers, and a pervasive sense of being watched.]

## The Journal of Alex Mercer

Day 1:

I can't believe I let Jake talk me into this hiking trip. "It'll be fun," he said. "A chance to disconnect from the world and reconnect with nature," he said. Well, Jake, if you're reading this over my shoulder, you're an idiot. But I guess I'm an even bigger idiot for agreeing to come along.

So here we are, the four of us—Jake, Sarah, Mike, and yours truly—about to embark on a three-day trek through the Whispering Pines. They say these woods are some of the oldest in the country. Looking at the gnarled, ancient trees looming over us as we set up camp for the night, I can believe it.

There's something about this place that sets my teeth on edge. Maybe it's just my imagination, but the silence feels... heavy. Expectant, almost. Like the forest is holding its breath, waiting for something.

But hey, it's probably just first-night jitters. I'm sure things will look better in the morning. 

Right?

Day 2:

Woke up to a thick mist blanketing our campsite. It's eerily quiet—no birdsong, no rustling of small animals. Just silence and that damned mist. Jake seems unfazed, already poring over his map and planning our route for the day. Sarah's making breakfast, but the smell of cooking food seems wrong somehow, out of place in this forest.

Mike pulled me aside while we were packing up. "Hey, Alex," he whispered, glancing nervously at the others. "Does something feel... off to you?" I nodded, relieved I wasn't the only one feeling it. We agreed to keep an eye out, but didn't want to spook Jake and Sarah.

We've been hiking for hours now, and I swear the sun hasn't moved. The mist has thinned, but the light filtering through the canopy is dim and diffuse, making it impossible to gauge the time. Jake insists we're on the right path, but nothing looks familiar from the trail guide.

Sarah tried to lighten the mood by singing, but her voice sounded muffled, as if the very air was swallowing the sound. She trailed off after a few bars, her smile faltering.

I'll be glad when we make camp for the night. Maybe things will seem clearer in the morning.

Day 3:

Something is very wrong here. We should have reached the midpoint of our hike by now, but the forest seems to be getting denser, not thinning out as the map suggests. Jake's trying to hide it, but I can see the worry in his eyes as he consults the map and his compass.

The compass is another thing—it's spinning wildly, never settling on a direction. When I pointed this out, Jake snapped at me, insisting it was just a malfunction. But I saw the fear in his eyes.

We're starting to hear things. At first, I thought it was just the wind in the trees, but there's no breeze. It's like whispers, just at the edge of hearing. Sarah says it sounds like her name sometimes. Mike is jumping at every sound, his eyes darting around constantly.

I suggested we try to retrace our steps, to go back the way we came. Jake refused, saying we've come too far to turn back now. I'm not sure he knows which way "back" is anymore.

The trees seem to be closing in around us. Their branches reach out like gnarled fingers, seeming to grasp at our clothes as we push through. I swear some of them have moved when I wasn't looking directly at them.

We're setting up camp now, in a small clearing that feels more like a cage than a refuge. None of us want to admit it, but I think we're all afraid to fall asleep tonight.

Day 4:

I don't know how long we've been in these woods. Our watches have stopped working, and the sun... the sun doesn't move. It just hangs there, a dim orb barely visible through the canopy, casting long shadows that never seem to change.

We should have reached the end of the trail by now. Jake's map is useless - nothing matches up anymore. It's like the forest itself is shifting around us.

Sarah's gone. We woke up this morning and she just... wasn't there. Only her shoe remained, lying at the edge of our camp as if it had been carefully placed there. We've been searching all day, calling until our voices are raw. But there's no sign of her.

The whispers are constant now. They're saying our names. Calling to us. I catch Mike looking over his shoulder constantly, his eyes wide and frightened. At one point, he started talking back to them, and Jake had to shake him to snap him out of it.

Jake is trying to keep it together, but I can see the fear in his eyes too. He keeps insisting we'll find our way out tomorrow. I'm not so sure.

Our food supplies are running low. We've been rationing, but at this rate, we'll be out completely in a day or two. The thought of what we might have to do then... I can't even bring myself to write it down.

As night falls—or what passes for night in this eternal twilight—the shadows seem to move of their own accord. I keep seeing shapes flitting just at the edge of my vision, but when I turn to look, there's nothing there.

We're huddled around our campfire now, none of us willing to sleep. The flames don't seem to push back the darkness like they should. Instead, the shadows dance and writhe, taking on forms that make my mind recoil.

I don't know if we'll make it out of these woods. But I'll keep writing, keep documenting what's happening to us. If anyone finds this journal... maybe they can avoid our fate.

Day 5 (I think):

The fruit appeared today. God, I don't even want to call them fruit. They're... wrong. Pulsing, glistening things hanging from the trees. We're out of food, and the hunger is gnawing at us. Mike wanted to eat them. I stopped him. For now.

Jake isn't doing well. He woke up screaming last night, clawing at his skin. Said he could feel the forest trying to get inside him. I thought he was just having a nightmare, but now... now I'm not so sure.

The whispers are getting louder. They're promising things. Terrible, wonderful things. They say they know where Sarah is, that we can join her if we just give in. Part of me wants to believe them.

We tried to leave the clearing today, to keep searching for a way out. But no matter which direction we walked, we always ended up back where we started. It's like the forest is toying with us, herding us like cattle.

Mike's taken to talking to the trees. He claims they're answering him, telling him secrets. Jake and I tried to snap him out of it, but he just stares at us with this vacant smile now.

I've started noticing changes in my own body. My nails seem longer, harder. And this morning, I found a patch of skin on my arm that looked... bark-like. I'm scared to sleep, scared of what I might become if I close my eyes.

The fruit is looking more tempting by the hour. We're so hungry, so tired. Maybe if we just had a little, just enough to keep our strength up...

No. No, I have to stay strong. Have to resist. But for how long?

Day ???:

We ate the fruit.

Oh god, we ate the fruit.

I don't know how long it's been. Time has lost all meaning here. The changes started slowly at first—heightened senses, a feeling of euphoria. We thought we'd been saved.

How wrong we were.

Jake was the first to fully transform. His skin hardened into bark, branches bursting from his flesh. He screamed for hours as his body twisted and contorted. Now he stands at the edge of our camp, rooted to the ground, his face frozen in a silent scream.

Mike... Mike embraced it. He laughed as the changes took him, his body elongating, limbs stretching into branches. His laughter turned to creaks and groans as leaves sprouted from his skin. He's part of the canopy now, his face barely recognizable in the knots of a trunk.

I'm changing too. My fingers are longer, bark-like patches spreading across my skin. I can feel the forest in my mind, calling to me, promising an eternity as part of something greater.

Sarah... we found her. Or what's left of her. She's become a twisted hybrid of woman and tree, her lower body fused with a massive trunk, her arms reaching out as branches. Her eyes are gone, replaced by knots in the wood, but somehow, I know she can still see us.

I'm writing this as a warning. If anyone finds this journal, please, don't come looking for us. Run. Run as far and as fast as you can. The Whispering Pines are alive, and they are always hungry for new saplings to join the grove.

I can feel my mind slipping away, replaced by something vast and ancient. Soon, I'll be one with the forest, my consciousness spread through root and branch.

We are the forest now. And we are waiting for you.

[The journal entries end here. The remaining pages are filled with an increasingly illegible scrawl, interspersed with crude drawings of trees with faces and human-like figures merging with plant matter. The final page contains a single sentence, written in what appears to be a mixture of sap and blood:

"The Whispering Pines welcome you. Join us."]
