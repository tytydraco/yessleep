(This is actually a true story believe it or not and I had to witness it all so I've decided why not write a post about it from Billy's Pov.)



I, Billy, 18 M, like feet and now everybody knows.

So I started dating this girl two months ago, Nicola, 18 F, but we split after a month of dating.

Me and Nicola rushed into our relationship quite fast. Whilst Nicola was over my house I had confessed my love for feet. She looked shocked but kept giggling.

After everyone had found out, I had learnt that Nicola had told Carly, that I had a foot fetish and allegedly sucked Nicola's toes. Carly had told Lexi, and then Lexi told Jess about this situation so it had gotten spread around Nicola's friend group. 

Jess ended up telling everyone in the "big" friend group and kept making jokes about it in the group chat then proceeded to kick me from it, as if she was trying to assert power and control over me.

Oh I was fuming I wanted to give her a piece of my mind, so I told Tim and then I found out Tim had told Jess about it. I was enraged, so when we went back to college I pulled Jess aside for a chat.

How smart I am, I locked her in the quiet room with me and turned on the dimmest light in the room, to give it an intimidating vibe. I started off by saying that I wasn't there to argue with her I was there to resolve problems and if we construct conversation that clears things up I felt like I guess it would give me a peace of mind and I wouldn't have to worry about what's going on. 

Before hand I wanted to get a few things straight, they weren't up for dispute they were things that happened. I mentioned how she found something out that happened between me and Nicola, private acts and how she posted about it to her private story and how she kept antagonising me in the group chat, constantly making jokes and then removed me from the group chat, just to make jokes about it behind me back.

  
Jess said that she told people because she was shocked that it had happened and that she found it funny she also said how she wasn't the only one and that everyone was making jokes, not just her. I said I know violet was saying stuff but, I've been there, done that and dated it. 

I said how I felt like it wasn't fair, even if I do like feet what does it matter? She said she did it just because it was funny because you don't expect to hear it. I said you don't expect to hear it from any man, but so what if its true what has it got to do with her? So what if we did do that, so what if I did do that to her, it was a private act, both parties had consented.

I said it's nothing bad, it's not like I strapped her to the bed and did this and that, there's way worse stuff our there. People have shit, piss and vomit kinks, horrible stuff. People even like armpits, it doesn't make sense to me but if it floats their boat so be it.

I felt like it wasn't right, like I was being done off. It was the way I felt and I felt like I couldn't change the way I think, because I can't. I said why I broke up with Nicola and we ended on good terms and then she goes and does that. I just feel like it's wrong, like there was nothing I could do.

She had a trust or thought she has a trust in Carly and what she said to her was confidential and that's obviously proved to not be the case, because Carly went to Lexi, then Lexi went to Jess and Jess told everyone. Jess was explaining everything to me, yap, yap, yap. I then said stuff about Nicola and how careless she was in this situation. I said I felt embarrassed, like I had my trousers down, I felt ashamed to show my face in college. I stayed away from where everyone hangs out for a while. This is wrong and society doesn't think this is right, then I thought fuck what they think.

The point is I didn't want any animosity with Jess and how we got on for a while etc, then we spoke about her removing me from her private story etc. 

It's not even that big of a deal, I think it adds character personally. Even as a young boy I realised they fascinated me, then as I became a teen they started to sexually arouse me. But not ugly men feet, I like nice women's feet preferably white or black polish. I explained I had never told anyone only my online friends and Nicola was the first person I told and she never let me anywhere near them again. We did it, and I remember thinking how they don't move around this much in the pornos ffs.

But making fun of someone for liking feet is like making fun of someone with aids, it's funny at first but it's serious and not nice. I proceeded to yap and said as long as she takes accountability it would be okay and she also apologised and said she didn't realise how it could've impacted me mentally and only thought about how funny it was.

Anyways, thats my confession Iâ€™ve lost sleep about, I needed to rant about it.
