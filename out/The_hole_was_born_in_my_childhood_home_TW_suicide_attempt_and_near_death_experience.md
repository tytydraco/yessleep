Two weeks ago I survived a near death experience, from myself. I can’t sleep knowing that death felt similar to my childhood house’s carpet floor. 

having a near death experience was like witnessing, being able to confirm there is something in the darkness. I don’t mean a darkness in as death but the darkness around us. how we don’t feel alone in it. I don’t mean god or the devil- angels and anything following. but the darkness is a existing thing by itself. 

I thought it would be painless but it wasn’t. I panicked and called 911, begging for the pain to be gone. they arrived and they surrounded me and lifted me under my arms. they helped me to the ambulance 
but suddenly blackness began creeping into my vision until it consumed any light. everyone touching me suddenly vanished. But their touched lingered, in a numbing way. I felt like I didn’t even fall, I had no motion in the darkness. I could simply see. My eyes didn’t feel connected to my body; to anything. this lingering touch of numbness completely enveloped my body. 
I had no voice or feeling of a body, but I could see darkness. It felt like genuine seconds were passing by as I only could see darkness but there was a hole. it was so dark it could be distinguished from my surroundings. it was coming closer and I had no conflict to its existence. I was waiting, as if this unexpected familiarity was known to myself. I felt the space around me become soft somehow, like a carpet. like I was back in my childhood home, on that same carpet. Feeling it on my knees and hand. Until I heard a murmur and it became so painfully bright. I woke up in the hospital, a tube down my throat and already my hot tears assured me I was alive and in pain.

all I know- feel is that that black hole is inside me. Not in a depressing way but the hole, what will take my mortality is alive. it’s waiting in a sense I feel. 
every time I sleep, that darkness feels like it’s looking at me. if I have dreams it’s of people, but I can feel that black hole is watching me through their eyes. It feels angry yet calm, but waiting. I have this urge to visit back home, a feeling deep inside from fear of this thing. There are answers back home, in that house. Not only that one, but my grandparents too, where I had another unexplainable feeling but familiar. For an odd reason I believe the hole was born in my childhood house. I haven’t decided if I’ll visit either or both houses yet. I can continue, keep updating for people that are interested. 

this story isn’t glamorizing suicide, I’ve genuinely come to regret my decision and have irreversibly affected my relationships, mental and physical health. 
call a suicide hotline or text. 988 before it’s too late, save yourself and your loved ones will understand. don’t feel ashamed or feel as if it’s the only answer because it isn’t.
