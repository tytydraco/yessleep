This is the full story all put into one post.


It all started with an ad on the internet, buried deep in a forgotten corner of a job board. I had no real intention of responding to it when I clicked, but there it was: "Overnight Caretaker Needed" $500 for a night’s work, light duties, no experience required. I was desperate, so I applied on impulse. Two hours later, I received an email with just a time and an address: Avery Estate, 9 PM. Instructions will be provided upon arrival.

The estate was about an hour’s drive outside of town, nestled in the woods, almost hidden behind a veil of thick branches and vines. The house itself was enormous, but not in a welcoming way. It loomed in the night like something out of a gothic novel—tall, dark, and imposing. The front door stood ajar, a single dim light flickering inside.

I hesitated at first, but I needed the money. I pushed the door open and stepped inside. The air smelled stale, musty, like the house hadn’t been aired out in years. The wooden floors creaked beneath my weight as I moved cautiously through the hall. Nothing moved, nothing stirred. Just the faint hum of the house’s aged structure.

The entryway was barren—no furniture, no warmth. But there, in the center of the room, was a small table, and on it, a sheet of paper, weighted down by a heavy brass key.

I reached for the paper, the cool metal of the key cold in my hand. The note was scrawled hastily in a hand I didn’t recognize, but the words were clear:


Caretaker Rules – Follow Exactly

1. Lock the front door as soon as you enter. Use the silver key hanging on the hook by the door. It’s the only one that works. If the key is missing, leave immediately. Do not look back.

2. Do not enter any room with a lit candle. If you see a candle burning, close the door immediately and lock it. Wait until 3:33 AM. before unlocking it again.

3. Every hour on the hour, wind the grandfather clock in the parlor. If the clock stops, leave the house. Do not take anything with you.

4. Ignore any knocking you hear. It doesn’t matter if it comes from a door, a window, or even the walls. Do not acknowledge it.

5. Avoid the west wing after midnight. If you hear footsteps coming from that direction, go to the kitchen and wait. Do not investigate.

6. If you see her, don’t run.** She doesn’t like it when you run.

7. The job ends at 6:00 AM. At 5:59, leave through the back door. Do not look behind you. If you feel cold air on your neck, run.


The last line made my stomach twist, but I pushed the feeling aside. It was just an odd list of instructions for some rich person’s house, I assumed. Maybe they were just paranoid or superstitious. But I wasn’t about to back out now.

I turned around and found the silver key hanging on a hook by the door, just like the note said. It was old, worn, but unmistakable. I took the key and looked at the door behind me, and then glanced back at the brass key. It didn’t seem to serve any purpose now, so I pocketed it as a curiosity.

I started my rounds as instructed. The first rule seemed simple enough—lock the door as soon as you enter. I felt silly for even worrying about it, but I did it, locking the door behind me with the silver key. I moved deeper into the house.

The second rule was the first one that made me uneasy. Do not enter any room with a lit candle. It seemed random, but I kept my eyes peeled for any candles. As I passed one of the rooms, I saw a soft glow from the crack in the door. I crept closer and peeked inside.

A small, flickering candle sat on an old oak table, casting long shadows across the room. I swallowed. The second rule was clear. I wasn’t supposed to be in here.

I slowly stepped back, gently closing the door. I turned the lock with a quiet click and moved on, leaving the candle burning inside. My heart was pounding a little faster now, but nothing seemed too out of the ordinary. After all, this was probably just some rich person’s eccentric rules. Right?

The hours passed with nothing too strange happening, just a couple more flickering candles in random rooms. I kept following the rules—locking doors, staying away from lit candles, and minding my business as much as I could. 

Then, at 11 p.m., I reached the grandfather clock in the parlor, standing tall and foreboding against the wall. It was a thing of beauty, all brass and dark wood, but its ticking was unsettling, too loud in the silence. I checked the time: 11:00 PM on the dot. I had to wind it.

I pulled open the glass case around the clock and grabbed the small winding key. As I twisted it, the clock groaned, the gears turning reluctantly. When I finished, I checked the time again. It had barely moved. Strange. I made a mental note to check it again at midnight.

By 12:15 a.m., I was starting to feel like I was just wasting time. No one had shown up, and the house remained as still as a tomb. The silence was deafening, and yet, I was becoming more aware of how often I was checking the time. Something about the quiet unnerved me.

Then it happened.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

It was soft at first, the sound echoing from behind one of the walls. I froze, my mind racing. The fourth rule flashed in my head: Ignore any knocking you hear." I shook my head, telling myself it was just the house settling. I stepped forward, my footsteps slow and deliberate, trying to push the unease out of my mind.

But then, the knocking grew louder.

*Knock. Knock. Knock.*

It was coming from the wall behind me, distinct, too deliberate. I should’ve listened to the rule and ignored it, but it was too much. I turned around.

Nothing.

I swallowed hard. It was nothing. Just the house, the old pipes, the wind. I turned back around, ready to leave, but that’s when I heard it again:

Knock. Knock. Knock.

I covered my ears, fighting the urge to stare in the direction it had come from. I wasn’t supposed to acknowledge it. The rules said not to, but it felt like the walls were closing in.

I moved on, finally making my way to the kitchen. I had to breathe. But as I entered the room, the door slammed shut behind me. I whirled around, my breath shallow. I stood there, staring at the door for what felt like an eternity, the rules echoing in my head.

I checked the time—3:33 AM. I could have sworn it was just midnight. I’d broken the knocking rule, but the next one hit me like a brick to the skull: Avoid the west wing after midnight.

I’d passed the west wing earlier, but now that I was closer to it, I could hear faint footsteps coming from behind the door. Panic surged through me. My heart thudded against my ribs.

 a sudden scratching noise came from the direction of the west wing. It was faint, almost imperceptible at first. I froze, holding my breath. The footsteps from earlier hadn’t stopped. They had only grown fainter, but now they were accompanied by this strange, unsettling sound, like something—or someone—was dragging itself across the floor.

I tried to follow the rule. Avoid the west wing after midnight. I didn’t investigate. But the scratching... It felt like it was calling me. Something deep in my bones told me to go check, but I pushed it aside, refusing to break the rules. Still, the sound lingered in the back of my mind, gnawing at me like a rat in the walls.

By 4:30 AM, I was pacing the hallway, jumping at every little sound. The house was creaking, groaning, the windows rattling with each gust of wind. I checked every door. Every room. I even peeked inside a few with the faintest glow of candles, but the moment I saw that light, I turned away and locked the doors behind me as instructed. But the house seemed more oppressive now. Every step I took felt heavier.

Then, at 5:00 AM, the door to the west wing creaked open. I hadn’t touched it. It had simply opened, and for a split second, I thought I saw the shadow of a woman flicker inside. I stumbled back, my breath catching in my throat. The air grew colder, sharper. I felt a presence, an intangible force that seemed to be drawing closer. The scratching, now louder, echoed from within. My instincts screamed at me to leave, to break the rules and run.

But I couldn’t. I wasn’t done yet. The clock was ticking down, and I was still bound by the rules.

It was 5:45 AM now. I moved back into the parlor to check the clock one more time, the ticking now louder than ever. The time read 5:45. I only had 15 minutes. But the house was closing in on me. My heart raced, my mind frantic. I thought I saw something move in the shadows, but when I looked closer, nothing was there.

Then, I heard it—a voice. It came from the west wing, a faint whisper, soft but unmistakable.

“Run.”

I froze. My heart thudded in my chest, the cold sweat trickling down my spine. I had to go. The rules said not to look back. The terror was overwhelming. I was seconds away from breaking.

The clock struck 5:59 AM.

Without thinking, I ran.

My feet hit the floor hard as I bolted down the hallway. The cold air from the back door hit me as I flung it open, stumbling into the night. My breath came in ragged gasps, my legs burning as I sprinted. The gravel crunched underfoot, the trees around me bending and twisting in the wind. I didn’t dare look back, but I felt a presence behind me, chasing me. The house seemed to breathe with me, its windows dark and empty, the door I had locked now standing wide open.

I threw my car door open and put the pedal to the floor. I didn’t stop driving until the distant glow of the city lights was visible on the horizon. Only then did I dare to slow down. My legs trembled, my body exhausted, but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop.

And I didn’t look back.

I sat in my car, still shaking, the events of the night replaying in my mind. My phone buzzed on the passenger seat. For a split second, I thought about ignoring it—another rule I’d follow long after leaving the house. But curiosity got the better of me.

The notification was an email.

“Subject: Payment Confirmation.”

My breath hitched. I opened it.

"Thank you for completing your shift at the Avery Estate. $500 has been deposited into your account."

That was it. No apology, no explanation—just cold, clinical confirmation. I refreshed my banking app, and sure enough, the money was there.

But something was off.

The email came from an address I didn’t recognize, something generic like caretaker at generic job portal .com. The sender field didn’t link to a company. It felt… anonymous, almost like it didn’t want to be found.

For a brief moment, I thought about replying, demanding answers. But as my fingers hovered over the keyboard, I remembered the house, the knocking, the whispers.

No.

Whatever had just happened, I didn’t want to know more. The money was there, and I wasn’t about to ask questions that might drag me back into whatever nightmare I’d barely escaped.

I closed the email and deleted it from my inbox, along with every trace of that job. But even as I sat there, trying to convince myself it was over, a single thought kept gnawing at me:

Who—or what—paid me, and did I want to know?


A week had passed since that night. I tried to put it behind me, to write it off as some bizarre, elaborate prank, or the twisted eccentricities of a wealthy recluse. But the memories lingered—the knocking, the footsteps, the cold breath on my neck.

And then there was the brass key.

I had completely forgotten about it until I reached into my jacket pocket while cleaning up my apartment. My fingers brushed against the cold metal, and the weight of it dragged me back to that house. I pulled it out, holding it up to the light. The key gleamed dully, its surface etched with strange, swirling patterns that I hadn’t noticed before.

It was heavier than I remembered, almost unnaturally so for its size. I turned it over in my hand, the ridges biting into my skin. I couldn’t explain it, but the moment I touched it, a faint hum buzzed at the back of my mind, like the static from an old TV.

I told myself to throw it away. To chuck it into the river or bury it somewhere it could never be found. But I didn’t. I couldn’t. Instead, I left it on my kitchen counter and tried to go about my day.

That night, the dreams began.

I found myself back in the house, standing in the darkened parlor. The grandfather clock ticked loudly, its sound echoing through the emptiness. In the dream, I was holding the brass key, and the hum was louder now, almost deafening. I turned, and there she was.

The woman.

Her face was obscured, shrouded in shadows, but I could feel her watching me. She didn’t move, didn’t speak. She just stood there, her presence oppressive and suffocating. I woke up drenched in sweat, the image of her burned into my mind.

The dreams continued every night, growing more vivid and more disturbing. I stopped sleeping, terrified of what I might see if I closed my eyes. The brass key remained on my counter, and every time I tried to get rid of it, my resolve faltered.

Then, one morning, I noticed something new.

The key had moved.

I was certain I’d left it near the sink, but now it was on the edge of the counter, teetering dangerously close to the floor. I stared at it, my pulse quickening. I hadn’t touched it. I knew I hadn’t.

That evening, as I sat in my dimly lit apartment, I could feel it watching me. Not the key, but something through the key, as if it were a window and not a solid object. The faint hum grew louder, filling the silence.

And then, the knocking started.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

It came from my front door, slow and deliberate. My stomach dropped. I stayed frozen on the couch, staring at the door as the sound echoed through the room.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

I couldn’t breathe. I knew better than to answer, but the urge to open it was overwhelming, almost irresistible.

I stood, trembling, as the knocking grew louder. I took a step toward the door and stopped. Something wasn’t right. The knocking wasn’t coming from outside.

It was coming from inside the apartment.

I turned toward the counter, where the brass key sat. It was glowing faintly now, pulsing with each knock. My heart raced as I backed away, but the knocking didn’t stop.

I grabbed a towel, wrapped it around the key, and shoved it into a drawer, slamming it shut. The knocking ceased immediately, leaving only the oppressive silence behind.

But I know it isn’t over.

The brass key is still in my apartment, and I can’t bring myself to destroy it. I’ve tried to leave, but every time I do, something pulls me back. It’s as if the key has become a part of me, and I’m terrified of what will happen if I let it go.

I became obsessed with the brass key. Every waking moment, my thoughts revolved around it. I needed to understand why it had such a hold over me. Sleep was no longer an option; every attempt was met with the same haunting dreams, her shadowy figure standing silently, watching, waiting.

On the seventh night, I decided I couldn’t endure it anymore. I had to know the truth. The dreams, the knocking, the hum—all of it pointed to one conclusion: the key wanted to be used. But where?

My mind kept circling back to the Avery Estate. I hadn’t thought about that house since I’d fled, but now it felt inevitable. The key had come from there. It had been left for me—whether by design or mistake, I couldn’t say.

So, at midnight, I drove. The road to the estate felt different this time, the trees looming closer, their branches clawing at the night sky. The house came into view, just as foreboding as I remembered, its windows like dark, unblinking eyes.

The front door stood ajar.

I hesitated, clutching the brass key tightly in my hand. My breath fogged in the cold air as I stepped onto the creaking porch. Pushing the door open, I was greeted by the same stale, musty air. The table in the entryway was gone, the space eerily empty.

I stepped inside, and the door slammed shut behind me.

The hum returned, stronger now, vibrating through the air, through my bones. I held up the key, its glow faint but unmistakable. It seemed to tug me forward, guiding me deeper into the house.

The hallways stretched on endlessly, twisting and turning in ways that didn’t make sense. I should have reached the parlor by now, but the house seemed to shift around me. I kept moving, my footsteps echoing unnaturally, the key growing warmer in my hand.

Finally, I stopped in front of a door. It wasn’t one I remembered from my previous visit. The wood was blackened and warped, the handle rusted. But the brass key seemed to hum louder, almost eager, as I held it toward the lock.

My hand trembled as I inserted the key.

The lock clicked.

I pushed the door open and stepped inside.

The room was small, barely larger than a closet, with walls covered in old, faded wallpaper. At its center was a pedestal, and on it, a box. The box was ornate, carved with the same swirling patterns as the key. It called to me, the hum now a low roar.

I stepped closer, my breathing shallow, and lifted the lid.

Inside was a mirror.

I stared at my reflection, but it wasn’t me. The face staring back was twisted, hollow, eyes sunken and mouth twisted in a grimace. It leaned closer, its movements not matching mine, and whispered:

“You shouldn’t have come back.”

The mirror shattered, and the hum turned into a deafening scream.

In my panic, I accidentally dropped the key,causing it to fall into the broken glass.

The walls of the room began to close in, the house shaking violently. I turned to flee, but the door was gone, replaced by solid, featureless walls. The room was collapsing, and I was trapped.

The walls pressed closer, and the air in the room seemed to vanish, replaced with a suffocating weight that clawed at my chest. Panic surged as I clawed at the featureless walls, my nails scraping uselessly against the smooth surface. The shattered remains of the mirror glinted on the floor, the brass key lying untouched amidst the shards, its faint glow dimming with each passing second.

I dove for it, snatching it up. As soon as my fingers wrapped around the brass, the walls froze, their relentless advance halting just inches from crushing me. The hum returned, now deep and resonant, filling the air with an ominous pulse.

The house was alive, and it wanted me gone—or worse, wanted me to stay forever.

With the key gripped tightly in my hand, I scanned the tiny space, my breath ragged. Something whispered just on the edge of hearing, the words indistinct but insistent, coming from nowhere and everywhere all at once. It grew louder, an eerie chorus of overlapping voices, until one word cut through the noise:

“Clock.”

The grandfather clock. The realization struck like lightning. The clock had always been central to the rules, its steady ticking a lifeline in the oppressive silence of the house. If the key belonged anywhere, it was there.

The room shuddered violently, and the walls began to move again. I didn’t have time to question it. Holding the brass key like a talisman, I closed my eyes and thought of the parlor.

When I opened them, I was no longer in the room.

I stumbled into the parlor, the grandfather clock looming ahead, its brass pendulum swinging in hypnotic rhythm. But something was wrong. The clock’s face was cracked, its hands spinning wildly. The hum was unbearable now, louder than ever, resonating through the room.

The shadows in the corners of the parlor writhed and stretched, shapes forming and unforming as though alive. From one shadow, I saw her.

The figure from my dreams.

She stepped forward, her hollow eyes fixed on me. Her mouth opened, but no words came out—just the same, endless hum. I backed away, but her gaze pinned me in place.

The clock’s erratic ticking faltered, and the pendulum slowed.

I didn’t think. I couldn’t.

I lunged forward and shoved the brass key into the small keyhole beneath the clock face that I had previously used to wind it. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, with a deafening click, the clock groaned.

The pendulum froze mid-swing, and the room plunged into silence.

The shadows evaporated, the oppressive hum vanishing with them. I turned to find the figure gone, the parlor bathed in an eerie stillness. The brass key now felt cold in my hand, its glow extinguished.

I stumbled back, breathing hard. The house, for the first time since I’d entered it, felt lifeless—no hum, no whispers, no shifting walls. Just silence I had been gripping the ley so hard it came out of the clock with me, but the house still seemed quiet.

I didn’t wait to see if it would last.

I made my way to the back door, the final rule still fresh in my mind. My steps felt heavy, my ears straining for any hint of movement. But the house remained still.

The back door creaked open easily, the cool night air washing over me like a balm. I stepped outside and didn’t look back.

As I reached my car, the brass key burned hot in my pocket for a brief moment before crumbling into ash.

I left that night alive but forever changed. The memory of that place etched into my mind. I don’t know if the house still stands, or if anyone else has fallen prey to its rules.

But if you ever find yourself on the road to the Avery Estate, turn back. No amount of money is worth what I saw.
