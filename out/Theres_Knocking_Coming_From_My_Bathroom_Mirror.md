I remember when I first joined the military. My grandfather had served back in Vietnam, and ever since his passing, all I could think about was graduating boot camp and serving my country. To think that a kid like me would actually have what it takes to pass boot camp still amazes me from time to time.

I was always the quiet, religious kid who spent his days in school drawing alone and playing video games instead of doing what most kids, I assume, would do—volunteer for ROTC or play sports like football to build physical strength. What they don’t tell you is that you can be the most physically capable person in the world, but your ability to lift heavy objects means nothing compared to the strength of your mind. The military demands that kind of mental resilience. Unfortunately for me, it seems like I'm losing mine.

I remember the first time I heard them—the voices. They were angry and bloodthirsty. It started when I was no older than ten. Growing up in a Catholic household, I was taught to treat people with respect and kindness. A simple concept, I know. Unfortunately, there are people who see kindness as weakness. Back then, I believed they were wrong.

I used to draw quietly in the corner of the classroom, enjoying my art, until one day a kid approached me. I don’t remember their name, but I do remember what they did. They made fun of me for sitting alone and snatched my drawing from my hands. I felt frustrated, but my teachings told me to turn the other cheek—even though the voices were telling me to hurt him. I treated the voices like bad thoughts: just ignore them, and they’ll go away.

That worked—most of the time. But when I went to bed, the voices became stronger. So strong, in fact, that I could still hear them in my dreams, scratching their way into my brain. Eventually, I began sleepwalking, always waking up in the bathroom with no memory of how I got there. My dreams, once a place of escape, turned into hellish visions of blood and bodies.

I told no one—not about the voices, not about the dreams. I feared retaliation from my parents or the authorities. Over time, the voices and nightmares became second nature. They slowly faded, becoming no more than a whisper as I prayed every day for the Lord to save me from these thoughts. What a fool I was.

June 12, 2018. The day my entire view of the world changed.

I was about three and a half years into my military contract, working as an F-18 jet mechanic. It was a pretty boring job, filled with mind-numbing repetition—turning wrenches, tightening bolts. It slowly drained my motivation and willingness to put in effort. Then an opportunity presented itself: crash and salvage. It was a volunteer duty, and in the rare 1% chance a plane went down, you’d be pulled from maintenance to search for the wreckage. It was a way to escape the monotony—and that 1% could be pretty exciting, as long as the ejection seats worked.

But this time, it wasn’t a regular jet aircraft. It was a C.O.D. (Carrier Onboard Delivery aircraft)—no ejection seats. They’re usually used for transporting mail and Amazon packages, but sometimes they carry new personnel straight from boot camp. I must have been the unluckiest person on duty, because not only did we have a crash, but it was a plane carrying thirteen new service members.

Then the voices started screaming.
When we arrived at the crash site, I saw it—a flaming scar carved into the earth. At the far edge of the wreckage lay the burning remains of the plane. The smell of death and charred flesh hung heavy in the air.

That’s when I saw him. He couldn’t have been older than nineteen. Bones and viscera were splayed out from what I assumed had once been his lower half. His eyes were still open, locked in a look of terror, as if he was still screaming for help.

Then the screaming began—not in my head, but from the plane itself. From that mangled, burning metal corpse, I could hear the cries of the remaining passengers. Shapes thrashed in the flames like fish desperately trying to return to water. And then—silence. Only those poor, charred bodies remained, twisted in grotesque positions, frozen in horror.

That night destroyed something inside me. I asked myself, Why? Why would God allow this? Why would He let children burn alive, screaming for Him to save them?
I tried praying—tried to hear His words—but all I could do was cry. From my childhood to my adult life, I had prayed for salvation, and each time, it felt like no one was listening.

And then, like a cruel twist of fate, I heard it.
*Knock* *Knock* *Knock*
