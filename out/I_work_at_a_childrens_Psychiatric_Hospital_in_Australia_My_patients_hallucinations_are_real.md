   


I know it sounds crazy but it’s true.

I was assigned to a young male patient with schizophrenia. He had been a voluntary admission because he heard voices telling him to hurt people around him, and he admitted himself because he was afraid of actually going through with it.

Anyway, I went into the room alone one day, as usual, and did the usual introduction and asked how he was doing. 

He was at a desk drawing creepy, hideous monsters—each monster had its own page, and there had to be at least half a dozen of these pages scattered around him. 

I asked him what they were. He answered that those were the monsters he saw. They were the monsters that whispered to him and told him to hurt people and do awful things.

Guarded, I asked him, ‘Are they telling you to hurt me?’

He answered, ‘Yes.’

I didn’t stay very long in that room.

\*   \*   \*

The following night I had a few nightmares from the creepy drawings my patient drew. 

Unfortunately, I couldn’t take pictures of them. Let’s just say he prefers not to let anyone see them; not to mention take photos of them. 

Describing them, I can do. 

One of them has an exceptionally long neck, with what looks to be an elephant’s trunk for a head and a single eye on the tip of its trunk-like head. The torso is completely human but the legs are not there.

The next creature is more creepy and unsettling than the first.

It’s a normal male man. But his facial features are all corrupted and unnatural. 

The mouth is upturned into a grotesque smile, no teeth. The eyes are mouths as well, upturned into the same weird smile as the “normal” mouth is. 

There are numerous others that look like something out of a rated R horror movie.

One that has no visible limbs or head; another with legs of children protruding out of its mouth and onto the floor, and many more of these “hallucinations”. Yes, I have set off the word “hallucinations” with quotation marks because they aren’t really hallucinations.

A couple of days ago, I saw one of those creatures.

And no, I have no history of psychological disorders in my bloodline at all; which is further evidence that what I saw was goddamn real.

It all started when I had a talk with my boss.

I came into the room to talk to him regarding an event that happened with that young male patient. The event was nothing serious, he just got a little aggressive because  he claims the demons were threatening him to hurt me.

I grabbed the seat opposite to where my boss is sitting and caught him scowling at me.

“Is there anything wrong sir?” I asked.

He seemed to scowl worse, if that’s even possible. 

“So you come into my office, sit down in MY seat, and ask if there’s anything wrong?”.

“Sir I’m not—”.

“No no, don’t “sir” me! You let a patient get aggressive in YOUR care for the first time in what, 10 years?”

“11 and a half”, I corrected.

“Proves my damn point”.

“What even is your point, sir?”, I asked.

My boss sighed at this. “You need some rest. You have been working at this facility for more than 10 years! You need a break.”

I was taken aback by that. Is he implying that I’m not doing my job properly? The patient I was in charge of was just a bit jumpy that’s all.

“Sir, you can’t do that. It was just one incident and it won’t happen again, I promise”, I begged.

He sighed again. “I’ll give you a paid month off, how’s that?”

I started to say something, but something stopped me. A paid month off sounds like 

(rest)

a good deal.

I got up from where I was sitting and looked up at him.

“Ok sir, I’ll do just that”.

“Good, now you have some rest at home”.

(home)

(couch)

(TV)

(food)

What is going on with me? What’s with these thoughts suddenly popping up in my head? I’m an extremely productive person and I don’t exactly like to sit on my ass all day and watch TV while stuffing myself with junk food.

As I left the room, I could have sworn I saw a figure with the head of an elephant’s trunk staring at me from one of the rooms down in the hallway.

\* \* \*

As I went for my morning jog the next day, I found myself standing in front of the local café.

The thoughts got

(need food)

worse and worse to the point I was listening to them.

Last night I found myself ordering 2 large margarita pizzas when I usually order one medium. Not to mention I don’t eat the whole thing.

I found myself eating the entire thing in one sitting!

And the goddamn thoughts I had. It was like someone was controlling me from the shadows.

Anyway, as I entered the shop, I sensed something was wrong with me the second my eye had laid on the various sweets and cakes in the shop.

It was as if nothing else mattered but the food 

(eat)

in the shop.

The food lit up in a strange hazy glow as if it had come from heaven. Everything else around me; the people, furniture and vehicles were all in black and white. My mind was in a trance as I charged for the food.

I was faintly conscious of the elephant trunk head figure on the left side of the café.

Its whole body glowing like the food in front of me.

(eat)

(crunch)

(stuff)

(munch)

(scavenge)

(pump)

(swallow)

I threw myself onto the glass containing the food and smashed it. The screaming around me was muffled but not silent.

Covered in glass, I grabbed wads of cakes and sweets and stuffed myself. 

Minutes seemed to go by and I was still on the floor, eating almost all the food in the café. I was a mess but I didn’t care. 

Glass and wads of food fell to the ground as I stood up. The screaming had ceased and the food no longer shone its heavenly glow. The elephant figure seemed to have disappeared. 

I was no longer in a trance, and the chaos hit me like a shot from a hunter’s rifle.

“H-Huh”, I stammered, not able to assess the situation and accept it. All those people…my boss, co-workers, they’re going to think I’m a lunatic!

A heavy cloud of anger and sadness washed over me as I dropped to the floor again and wept.

Why? Why is this happening to me? This isn’t supposed to be real.

I sniffed, tears streaming down my cheeks and onto the floor, joining the wads of food and glass.

(kill)

What?

I looked up to see more than a dozen creatures standing over me. I choked back a sob.

(kill)

(hurt)

(vandalise)

(break)

(attack)

(upset)

(crush)

So many voices.

What do they want from me?

The demon with the smiling eyes and tuxedo reached out and gently stroked my right cheek. His smiling eyes and mouth seemed to grow wider until the uncanny crescents covered his entire face.

(mine)

The thought reached my mind before it said anything. 

The other demons were now squirming and making noises that resembled a fox in distress. 

(no he’s mine)

(NO MINE)

(ARGHHHHH)

(animals animals, relax. We all know he’s mine. I touched him first.)

(well i controlled him first, i made him get here in the first place so he's mine. MINE)

(hmm, how about we all have him. Ours)

(ours)

(ours)

(ours)

(ours)

(ours)

(ours)

(ours)

(ours)

(ours)

(ours)

(ours)

Make it stop. Please go away. 

The demons all stepped forward and, with their limbs, tentacles, bodies or heads, all gently touched my face.

\* \* \*

I walked through the street of my house, ignoring everyone and everything. My body was twitching and shuddering at each step. I was walking like a zombie.

I unlocked the door to my house and almost tripped my way to the kitchen.

(ladies and gentlemen, let us commence our first party)

(ours)

(ok so what’s the plan)

I grabbed the largest knife I could find and swooped at the keys on the table with a swift motion.

(let's pay the so called “boss” a visit)

The car unlocked with a click.
