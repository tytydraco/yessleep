I always thought grief came in waves. Loud ones. Crushing ones.
Nobody warned me about the quiet kind—the kind that makes you open drawers you shouldn’t, power on devices that were meant to stay dead.

My father died three months ago. Heart attack. Sudden. Clean. That’s what everyone said.

Last night, I finally turned on his old phone.

The battery somehow still worked. No SIM. No notifications. Just a lock screen photo of our house, taken from across the street. From the shadows.

That should’ve been my first warning.

I went through the usual things: photos of groceries, blurry sunsets, accidental screenshots. Then I noticed a folder I didn’t recognize.

No name. Just a gray icon.

Inside were audio files. Hundreds of them.

All labeled with dates. Going back years.

I tapped the most recent one.

At first, I thought it was static. Then I realized it was *breathing*. Slow. Controlled. Close to the microphone.

And then I heard it.

My voice.

Not talking. Sleeping.

I recognized the sound immediately—the slight whistle from my nose, the way my breath hitches before settling. I’d heard it on road trips when I fell asleep in the passenger seat.

But this recording wasn’t from a car.

There was no engine. No radio hum.

Just my breathing… and the faint creak of floorboards.

I paused it, my thumb shaking. Checked the date.

Two weeks before my dad died.

I live alone.

I told myself there had to be an explanation. Maybe I’d sent him recordings as a joke. Maybe it was something he used to help me with insomnia.

I clicked another file.

This one had movement. Fabric shifting. A soft *thump*, like someone sitting down on a bed.

Then a whisper. Barely audible.

“Still does that thing with his hands.”

My stomach dropped.

I do a weird thing when I sleep. I curl my fingers into my palms like I’m holding something invisible. My dad used to tease me about it when I was a kid.

I locked the phone and threw it on the couch like it burned.

I didn’t sleep last night.

This morning, I checked my bedroom.

Nothing out of place. Windows locked. Door secure. No signs of anyone being there.

Except… my closet door was open.

I *never* leave it open.

I went back to the phone. Against every instinct screaming at me not to.

I scrolled further back. Older recordings. Years old.

Same sounds. Same breathing.

Different rooms.

I could tell by the acoustics. One had the hollow echo of my college dorm. Another had the dull carpeted quiet of my first apartment.

My dad had been recording me sleep for *years*.

I felt sick thinking about the logistics. The travel. The access.

Then I found the last file in the folder.

Not the most recent.

The *oldest*.

I almost didn’t play it.

This one started differently. The breathing was uneven. Panicked.

Mine.

I was crying.

A child’s voice—my voice—choked out words between sobs.

“I can’t sleep. He keeps standing there.”

There was a long pause.

Then my father spoke.

Calm. Soft. Reassuring.

“I know. That’s why I’m here.”

The recording ended there.

I don’t remember that night.

I don’t remember *him* standing there.

I checked the date.

It was from the year my mother died.

I’m sitting in my bedroom now, typing this. The phone is on my desk, face down.

I just got a notification.

A new audio file has been added.

Dated today.

I haven’t pressed record.

And I’m not asleep.

Yet.

But I can hear breathing behind me.

Slow.
Controlled.
Close to the microphone.
