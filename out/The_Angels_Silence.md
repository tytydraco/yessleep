Oh, for Christ's sake! Here we go again, with this shrieking. She's jumping up and down like a dervish on speed, right above my head.

Every hour or so, the racket starts up. Sometimes it sounds like she's hopping around on one foot, other times like she's hurling herself from sofa to chair in some kind of deranged, adrenaline-fueled freakout.

It's interfering with the concentration I need to bang out this godawful childhood memoir.

The noise isn't letting up, but I try to drown it with my pen, write this so it makes some semblance of sense.

\*\*\*

*So me and Rocky, a boy whom I thought was my pal, we were sitting on a cracked-up wall. In front of us there was this decrepit church. Made out of bleached-out stone that's almost white, sort of grayed and gross, and the roof is a mellow red. It's got a cross tower sticking up in the sky. And a big old tree covered in deep purple moss, looming over it, its thick branches hanging down.* 

*The clouds were so low they've turned the world a dingy gray, but at least it wasn't raining. Mid-September and still warm.* 

*There was a cemetery behind us on the hill. We couldn't see no tombs from where we were sitting, they're down below. But a few meters away, at the entrance of the cemetery, there was that statue, some crusty white stone angel thing, with long strands of hair and no pupils in its eyes, looking up at the sky.*

*"That angel gives me the heebie-jeebies", I told Rocky.*

*But he wasn't paying any attention to me. Rocky was busy jamming his finger into his nose, then pulling out globs of nasty shit, rolling them up into little balls and flingin them onto the dirt path that runs between cemetery and church.*

*I had these morbid thoughts. An urge to give him a push, making his body roll down that steep hill.*

*But instead I just asked "Rocky, do you ever wonder what comes after we die?"*

*He continued looking away, oblivious, wiping a smegma-covered finger on his trousers.*

*"I find myself amazed," I screamed loudly to pierce his thick skull, "I mean why do we exist now and here. Why not before or after, in all eternity?"*

*He looked at me, his eyes dull and vacant, the same unthinking stupidity I've seen on his face countless times before. Why do I bother?*

*After a few long seconds, "Let's go pelt Miguel's house with stones, yeah?" he said out of nowhere.*

Ah, you bastard! there's banging again. Sounds like a jungle up there, a wild beast ritual or maybe a herd of elephants? Is she having a party now?

In a fury of rage, I tear out of my place and make for the stairs.

When I reach her door, I start bashing it with all the force of my impatience.

"What's going on?" she asks when she opens up. As she recognizes me she follows with "Hi, Ian. What's the matter?"

She's standing there at her doorway, cute in that robe. Her long golden hair spilling down.

"You... eh... you gotta keep the noise down," I spit out while peeking inside at her empty living room. It's eerily still.

"What noise?" she asks. Her gaze is steady, clear. But there's something in it. Too wide, too blank, like pupils etched away. 

She genuinely doesn't seem to get why I'm upset. "Havenâ€™t heard anything".

"This shrieking racket is driving me round the bend!" I tell her. "How are you not hearing this?"

Her eyes widen as she tries to decipher my state of utter frustration. "Can you describe the noise you're hearing?"

"It's loud... " I try, "sounds like a demented jackrabbit tearing its legs off."

"Uh, well... maybe it's just the house settling or something?" She suggests, but her words don't convince me.

"Ian, maybe you'd like to come in..." Her voice fades off with a note of concern.

I hesitate. "No thanks. Never mind," I reply, turning away.

I glance back at her, but she isn't even watching me leave, already stepping back inside, closing the door.

I slop back into my flat. My mind races, churning out the same tired thoughts and ideas as I plop down at the table. I cannot even remember where I left off.

I take my work, reread it. A mess of half-arsed attempts at creating something. I roll the paper into a ball and hurl it into the bin, miss the gaping maw by inches. Nerves strung tight, still jangling like electric wires.

I try to centre myself. Sit back in my chair, close my eyes... and bang! The pounding again.

Up I jump, roaring at the walls, the ceiling, "Rocky? Is that you, you bastard?" 

Tears streaming down my face. "Swear I didn't mean to shove you off that wall, pal." 

Sobbing now, full-on blubbering. "I swear," I whimper, my voice cracking, but the noise just gets louder, right through my skull.
