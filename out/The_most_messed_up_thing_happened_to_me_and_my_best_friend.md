When I was nine, I met my best friend, Lyle. We shared the same classroom, and the moment we introduced ourselves, we realized we were wearing the same t-shirt. For years we grew up side by side, until after graduating eighth grade, when we went off to different schools. I had a few other friendships outside of Lyle’s, but none were as strong. Most were shallow—selfish, even—and one was somewhat obsessive. Like many childhood bonds, Lyle’s and mine eventually faded with time, until one day I received a call out of the blue.



The line clicked, followed by a pause.

“Hey… it’s been a while, hasn’t it?”

“Lyle?” I sat up straighter, gripping the phone. “Wow, I didn’t expect to hear from you. How’ve you been?”

A faint laugh slipped through the receiver. “Good. I mean—yeah, good enough. Things change, you know? But I was just thinking about old times. Figured I’d call.”

“Yeah, it’s been forever. What are you up to these days?”

“Not much. I’m back in town for a bit. Kind of strange being here again. Everything looks smaller, you know? Same streets, different feeling.”

I smiled despite the unease creeping in. “Yeah, I know what you mean. Feels like another lifetime.”

“Exactly.” There was a beat of silence. “Anyway, I thought maybe we could meet up. Catch up properly.”

“Sure, I’d like that. When?”

“How about tonight? Grab a beer, say… eight?”

“Eight works for me. Where should I meet you?”

He hesitated just a moment too long. “I’ll text you the place. Just… yeah, it’ll be good to see you again.”

“Yeah,” I said softly. “It will.”



I finished out the rest of my shift in a fog, barely aware of the work in front of me. Every few minutes my mind drifted back to the voice on the phone. It sounded like Lyle, sure, but there was something… not quite right. Still, the thought of seeing him again after all these years kept me moving.

By the time I clocked out, dusk had already started pressing against the windows. I drove home, showered off the day, and threw on a clean shirt. My phone buzzed as I was lacing up my shoes—an address, short and blunt. No name of the place, just numbers and a street I barely recognized.

The GPS led me there soon enough: a squat little bar crouched between a laundromat and an empty lot. The neon sign out front sputtered and buzzed like it was fighting to stay alive. Paint peeled off the doorframe, and the windows were so grimy I couldn’t see inside.

I took a breath, pulled the door open, and stepped into the haze of stale beer and low light.



Inside, the place was nearly empty—just a handful of tired faces hunched over their drinks. I scanned the room, expecting to spot Lyle right away, but nothing clicked. Then, from the far end of the bar, a man raised his hand and gave me a small wave.

For a moment, I thought he had the wrong person. The man was a stranger—his hair was longer now, scruffy and unkempt, his shoulders heavier, his face marked with lines I didn’t remember. But when he smiled, when his eyes met mine, something stirred. It was Lyle. Different, off somehow, but still carrying the faint echo of the boy I used to know. At least I thought.

I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding and pushed the doubt aside. A lot of time had passed, after all. People change.



I made my way toward him, unsure if I was imagining the familiarity in his face.

“Lyle?” I said, forcing a smile.

His grin split wide, almost too wide, and his eyes sparkled with a kind of manic energy. “Hey! Oh man, it’s so good to see you! You have no idea how long I’ve waited for this.”

I raised an eyebrow, taken aback by the intensity. “Yeah… it’s been a while.”

He leaned in, voice dropping slightly as if sharing a secret. “I’ve been through a lot lately. Just got out of prison.”

My stomach dropped. “Prison? Wait—what happened?”

Lyle waved a hand dismissively, like it was nothing. “Huge misunderstanding. Totally blown out of proportion. I’ll explain later. But, uh… I actually had a favor to ask.”

I tensed, unsure what was coming.

“I need a place to crash for a week or so. Just somewhere to lay low, you know? Thought maybe… you could help me out?”



At first, I wanted to say no. The thought of letting someone I barely knew—or someone who had just been in prison—into my space made my stomach knot. But then I looked at him, at the familiar spark in his eyes, and I remembered all the years we had spent growing up together. Lyle had been my best friend, my constant through childhood, and no matter how many years had passed, I couldn’t turn my back on him now.

“Yeah… yeah, of course,” I said finally, forcing a smile. “You can crash at my place. A week’s fine.”

Relief washed over him, almost visibly. “Thank you, man. You don’t know how much this means.”

I nodded, but a small knot of unease lingered in my chest. Something about him felt… different.



We finished our drinks and then left. I pulled onto the road, keeping my headlights low, and fumbled for my phone. Even though I didn’t have a social media account myself, I needed to know—needed to make sure this was really Lyle.

Scrolling through profiles with one hand while keeping the other on the wheel, I typed his name into search after search. Finally, I found a profile that matched his name. No pictures of him, just a single photo: a car. The same make and model, down to the dent on the driver’s side fender. That had to be him. That had to be Lyle.

I glanced in my rearview mirror. A car followed at a careful distance. It wasn’t hard to recognize—the same scruffy, long-haired figure at the wheel. Lyle. Somehow, he was driving his own car, tracking me home while I ran my own investigation.

My stomach knotted. Part of me felt relieved—proof he was who he said he was—but another part recoiled at the thought of how easily he had shadowed me, unnoticed.



We finally pulled into my driveway, the night quiet around us. I unlocked the door and led Lyle inside, motioning toward the couch. “Here, this’ll be fine for tonight.”

He flopped down and gave me a quick, tight hug. “Thanks… really, man. I don’t know what I’d do without you right now.”

I nodded, forcing a smile, and left him to settle in. We both fell asleep to the low hum of the city outside.

Hours later, I woke to a weight on the bed. My heart skipped a beat as I realized Lyle was lying there, sprawled out as if he belonged.

“Lyle! What the hell are you doing?” I shouted, shaking him lightly.

He blinked up at me, a sheepish smile tugging at his lips. “Sorry… I must have sleepwalked.”

I exhaled slowly, trying to calm the surge of anger. “It’s… okay. But you need to get out of my bed.”

He let out a soft sigh, sitting up reluctantly. “Yeah… yeah, you’re right.”



The next day, I barely saw Lyle. He slept all day, curled up on the couch as if the world outside didn’t exist. I left for work, trying not to think too much about him, telling myself he just needed rest after everything he’d been through.

When I returned home that evening, a chill ran down my spine. Lyle’s car was now parked in my garage. I hadn’t asked him to bring it in, and he hadn’t mentioned it. I opened the front door and froze—my clothes had been rummaged through. Drawers left ajar, socks and shirts pulled out and tossed carelessly.

“Lyle… what the hell?” I called, my voice tight.

He lifted his head from the couch, bleary-eyed. “I was asleep all day. I swear. I didn’t touch anything.”

I shook my head, trying to process it, and then I noticed something else: the box in the garage where I had kept my childhood belongings—old trophies, comic books, and school projects—was gone. Pieces of my past were now scattered across the living room and kitchen, strewn like someone had rifled through them for no reason at all.

“Lyle… what did you do?” I demanded, my stomach twisting.

He looked at me, expression blank, and said nothing.



I dropped my hands onto the scattered belongings, frustration and disbelief tightening my chest. “Lyle… if this is how you’re going to treat my place, my stuff—friends or not—you’re going to have to leave.”

He remained silent, lying on the couch like nothing had happened.

Gritting my teeth, I began picking up the pieces, shoving trophies, comics, and old papers back into the box and carrying it to the garage. My mind was spinning, trying to make sense of his behavior, but nothing prepared me for what came next.

As I passed by Lyle’s car, a strange, sickly odor hit me. Frowning, I crouched and sniffed near the wheel wells. The smell was unmistakable—rotting, pungent, unbearable. My stomach churned.

Cautiously, I circled the car, following the source to the trunk. My hand trembled as I lifted it.

Inside was a body. Partially decomposed, the flesh mottled and gray. And then I saw the face. The unmistakable face. Lyle. The real Lyle.

My knees buckled, heart hammering in my chest. I barely had time to react before a heavy thud from behind slammed into me, and the world went black.



I woke to a blur of pain and panic, my arms and legs bound together. The room spun, the dim light casting long shadows across the walls. From across the room, a figure leaned against the doorway, watching me with an unsettling calm.

“Do you… actually recognize me now?” the figure asked, his voice soft but edged with malice. “Now that you know I’m not Lyle?”

My stomach dropped. “W-what…? You’re not Lyle?”

The figure stepped closer, a crooked smile spreading across his face. “No,” he said. “I’m Greg. Remember? That obsessive friend I mentioned years ago? The one who was always… there, just a little too interested in you?”

I tried to speak, but my throat felt dry, my mind racing.

“I grew obsessed with you,” Greg continued, pacing slowly. “Watched you, learned your routines, figured out everything about you. I stalked you for years. You never even noticed… until now.”

My chest tightened. “Why… why would you do this?”

“I went to prison,” he admitted, voice low, almost regretful. “A small stint, nothing serious, but it gave me time to plan. The moment I got out, I knew exactly what I had to do. Pose as Lyle. Get close to you. Be welcomed into your life again. And here I am.”

The horror hit me in waves. This wasn’t Lyle at all. The childhood friend I trusted, the one I thought I had just reunited with… had been replaced by someone else entirely.

“And now,” Greg said, his smile widening, “we can finally be… together, like I’ve always wanted.”



Greg’s smile twisted into something darker. “You know… maybe we should just end it. Together,” he murmured, reaching into his jacket.

Before I could react, a glint of metal caught the dim light. He drove the knife into his own chest with a gasp, then lunged toward me, pressing the blade against my side. “We’ll die together,” he whispered.

Panic surged. My bonds strained, but I wriggled, desperate. Inch by inch, I managed to slip my hands free. With a sudden surge of strength, I swung an elbow into his temple, and he crumpled to the floor, unconscious.

Gasping, I scrambled to the phone and dialed 911, hands shaking. “There’s… there’s an intruder,” I managed, voice trembling. “He’s armed… he tried to—he’s here at my house!”

Minutes later, the wail of sirens pierced the night. Police flooded the driveway, and officers swarmed inside, taking Greg into custody and tending to his self-inflicted wound. I stepped back, breathing hard, watching as they finally secured the scene.

For the first time in hours, maybe days, the nightmare ended.



After everything was settled—after the police had taken Greg away and the paramedics had tended to his injuries—I wandered through the living room, exhausted and hollow. On the floor, tucked into the folds of Greg’s jacket, was a small, folded piece of paper.

Curious despite myself, I picked it up and unfolded it. The words were scrawled in his messy handwriting, and at the top, in larger letters, it read: *To My World.*

A chill ran down my spine. The note was meant for me. Me, the object of his obsession.

I held it for a long moment, my hands trembling. Then, with a deep, shuddering breath, I ripped it into pieces, watching the fragments scatter across the floor. Pieces of him, pieces of his obsession—gone.
