I'm a detective and I'm investigating the recent child abductions that have taken place in my city.

Today, the 8th child was reported missing. However a vague description of the car was released.

"Black sedan"

This is a relatively big town, well as big as a town could get in rural Northern Australia. So we had to go house to house to everyone who has a neighbor with a black sedan.

No luck.

No one reported anything suspicious, dead end.

Three weeks later the 9th child was abducted we finally got a lead. A neighbor of someone who owns a black sedan called.

"My neighbor has been on the road for over 16 hours, he came home just now with a kid I've never seen before."

This was our first lead in a while, we needed to see it through. As we made the half and hour drive to this neighbor me and my partner  passed by 3 candles lit on the sidewalk. They  were a memorial to the first kid that got abducted. They had a picture of the kid on a lamppost. The 7 year old's name was Jimmy Brant, he had messy brown hair, green eyes and red glasseseven though the abductor probably changed all of that.

When we got to the suspects house we knocked on the door and a red haired well groomed man opened the door.

"Can I help you?"

"We are with the police, you match the description of the child abductor we are looking for... well your car matches the description. Are there any children in this building?"

"Yes, my son, he's been with his mother, my ex wife for the summer, I just got him back today."

"Could we speak to him?"

"Donny, some men want to speak with you."

"Yes dad? Why are the police here?"

"Hey, Donny is it? Do you mind if we call you that? We're with the police, we need to ask you some questions. Do you know this man?

"Yes, he's my dad, he just picked me up today from my mom's place, he's not the bad man you're looking for."

I then asked the dad to give us the mom's phone number to which he abliged. I told my partner  to call it and make sure everything checks out. I then went home and went to sleep.

At 2 in the morning I get a call from my partner.

"Someone just reported that a kid is screaming from their neighbors house, their neighbor drives a black sedan.

I didn't have time to waste. I didn't even change out of my pajamas. I lived close to the house so I got to it minutes before any backup.

"This is the police, open the door."

A gruffy overweight individual opened the door.

"Why are you here!" He snapped.

"There are reports of screaming coming from your house, are there children in this building?"

"That screaming is what my parrot does when I won't give it more food. Even though I rescued it from my backyard it's still ungrateful."

"Can I see this parrot"

A small green parrot was brought to me

"Hey polly I said."

"Let's go to the forest and play." the bird responded.

I was shocked.

"Come on, let's go, I'm not going to hurt you." The bird kept repeating.

By the time it said this my partner arrived.

"Watch this guy, I need to go to the forest I said."

The house's backyard ran into the forest.

I saw bootprints in the dirt on the forests floor. I followed them for half a kilometer when I heard screaming deeper in the woods.

The screaming was coming above from a parrot. There were a bunch of parrots, the looked at me and hopped from tree to tree deeper into a forest. Then they started mimicking.

"It's okay, you can trust me." The parrots squealed.

I followed them.

"This won't hurt I would never hurt you."

"Don't even think about screaming!"

"No one can hear you."

"Take off your clothes"

"This is where I kill you"

"Do what I say!"

The parrots kept repeat these phrases until I stumbled on a poorly dugged grave.

There was a fresh body in it. Forensics claim the body was 30 minutes dead when I found it. There were 8 other bodies. All children. All strangulation and sexual assault marks on their bodies.

The man was arrested as he admitted to his crimes.

The judge gave him 10 consecutive life sentences. Too bad he didn't get to serve them. He got killed by another prisoner on his 2nd day in prison.

The parrot got put in a shelter and eventually got adopted by another owner who took good care of it.

This rural town in Northern Australia was never the same.
