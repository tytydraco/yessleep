I’ve always struggled to express my feelings. Always been the type of guy to hold them in, bottle them up until they burst out all at once. I don’t know why, I just was. I wasn’t a lonely kid, and my parents made it clear to me that if I ever needed to talk, they were there. I never took them up on the offer. I just preferred to keep to myself.

  


This method of containment had worked up until around the start of secondary school (pardon my Britishness) where the stresses of school, worsened by the influx of hormones all teenagers suffer from, became too much to handle. I’d lash out at friends and family, when all they were doing was trying to help.





So, to try and combat this issue, at the beginning of the year, fuelled by a particularly strong case of New-Year motivation, I grabbed myself a journal on Amazon. 





I allowed myself to spend a little extra - If I was going to write in this thing everyday I wanted it to be something nice. A dark green, 365 page, dated journal was my choice. I ordered it new on next day delivery and waited.





At around noon the next day (the 9th of January) my journal arrived. I hacked through the cardboard box with a pair of scissors, ripped open the clear plastic sleeve protecting the journal and opened it to the first page.





I’d made a promise to myself that I would write in it everyday, and I intended to keep it. The first few weeks were tough. I would sit staring at a blank page for 30 minutes, scribble the most seemingly profound sentence I could think of, read what I’d written and cross it out. I always felt as though I needed to write something that was suitable for the potential audience, if it fell into the wrong hands. Nothing too risque, nothing too personal, just keep it PG, *today I went for a walk and fed the ducks* oh 





yes, that’ll do. *The ducks moved across the lake like magical little boats.* Calm down there fella, don’t get too ahead of yourself. 





After those first few weeks just getting into the routine of writing everyday, the ink started to flow. Instead of those banal, sentence long explanations of my day, I started to really write how I felt. Paragraphs and paragraphs of my real thoughts, my real troubles, unfiltered and unedited. Writing only for myself.





And with this, my mental clarity, and general happiness started to improve. The human brain has a tendency to exaggerate. Problems that had seemed unbeatable within the confines of my mind, looked a lot more manageable on paper. 





 All was going well until yesterday.





I grabbed my pen and sat at the desk I used for my writing and turned to the day’s page, only to find it had already been written in.





My first reaction saw it as nothing serious; I’d probably mistakenly written on this page and just forgotten about it. 





As I read through the entry, however, my concern began to grow. Written in my own scrawly handwriting was a description of the day I had just lived.





*Today I met with Mia* (not her real name) *for lunch. We talked about school, our plans for the future and general lighthearted nonsense. Afterwards, I came home and watched some football. I’ve always wondered what the…* 





Then it went off into one of those personal ramblings, that I would rather not have published on the internet.





How was it possible that I had written this whole page within what must have been the last few hours and had no memory of it? There was no point in suggesting it was an older entry on the wrong day; me and ‘Mia’ had never before met outside of school before. Even stranger, was how the time (yes I write the time of my entries) was at 21:37, several hours after the time at which I was reading it. I closed the journal, and went for a walk to try and clear my mind. I went to bed that night with an uncanny feeling in the pit of my stomach.





The next day I returned to my desk to write, not intending to let the events of the last day - something my brain had attempted to rationalise as some sort of prank from my parents -  discourage me from keeping up my daily writing. I turned to the day’s dedicated page, and there it was again. Written in my exact handwriting was something I had no recollection of writing. It was a lot shorter this time, which gave me hope that it could be a misplaced earlier entry. What it said chilled me. 





*Today I walked down to the centre after school, went to Waterstones and grabbed a copy of ‘Yellowface’ by RF Kuang. I didn’t realise at the time, but The Friend was watching me, just out of sight. He’s very shy. He wants to meet me soon and I want to meet him too.* 





What the fuck was this? Sure, I’d walked to town and had a look around the Waterstones, but I hadn’t seen any friends. ‘*Watching me just out of sight*’ That was what really creeped me out. How could someone have been watching me closely enough to see the book I’d bought, but discreetly enough for me not to notice them? The time for this one was 17:54, a few hours before the time at which I was reading it. I had not been at home at the time the entry was supposedly written, so myself writing it was completely out of the question. After quickly confirming with both of my somewhat puzzled parents that neither of them had written in my journal, I started to ponder what my next action would be. 





I sat at my desk watching over the book for some time before deciding to check something; had other pages been written on? I opened to the page for the next day (the day on which I’m writing this post) and saw what I had feared the most. 





Written, still in that sloppy, barely legible handwriting I called my own, was somehow my entry for the next day.





*Today I attended School. I got home and my parents had gone out for dinner unannounced. Lucky for me, The Friend came knocking on my door at 21:03. He’d been out there watching me for a while, keeping me safe. I let him in and he kept me company, he listened to my problems. We had a lot of fun together.* 





Well today I did go to school they (me, it?) had gotten that much right. And my parents have gone out for dinner, travelled down to London (some anniversary or something) Should I have told them about the journal? Of course I should have. But I didn’t, and here I am. 





My phone reckons it’s 20:32. That gives me just over 30 minutes until The Friend comes knocking at my door. I don’t know how I know, but I know he’ll be on time.





What do I do? Sit and wait? Run for it? Call the police? All three seem tempting, but I could use some company. I’ve always struggled to talk to people, kept my feelings shut off from the outside. The journal says he’ll listen. Maybe it's right.
