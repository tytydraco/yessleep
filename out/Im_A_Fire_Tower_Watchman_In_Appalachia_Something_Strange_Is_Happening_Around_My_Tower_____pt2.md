Hey everyone, sorry about the long wait to hear from me again. Fires in the area have been keeping me pretty busy so its been a second since Ive been back to the tower. I usually wouldn't come down from the tower but the fires are extremely close and its all hands on deck. We finally stopped the main fire so I have some time to myself. Thanks to all of you out there for messaging me on my last post. A lot of good ideas for me this time around. 

Ive been gone for about seventeen days now on fire duty. I camped with a crew of three others, Moe, Jc, and Miranda. It was about night six when strange things started to happen. Jc woke up in a cold sweat screaming at the top of his lungs "IM SORRY IM SORRY IM SORRY IM SORRY" over and over again until Moe could shake him out of it. It shook us up pretty bad as well but that was just the beginning. The next night it happened again but Jc wasn't in his tent this time. His screaming was coming Forty feet away in the woods now. The same horrible thing he was screaming last night. When we found him he was weeping into his hands begging us not to let the man take him. We looked at each other and goosebumps formed on my body. When we snapped him out of it he had no recollection of what just happened in fact he asked us what was going on when he finally looked at us.

The next morning we called In for medical to come get Jc out of there for his own good. We weren't sure what was going on but he was in no state to keep watch with us. Nothing for three days and then Moe started to act funny. I woke up to take a piss and noticed Moe's tent was open. I looked around and seen no trace of him. I called out with reluctance not knowing what I was calling out to in the dark exactly. I stood there for a few minutes waiting to hear anything but it was silent as a library. There were no sounds whatsoever. No crickets, no owls, no nothing, and out here that's not a good sign. I zipped up my pants and turned back to my tent. I turned around and noticed Moe standing in front of his tent with his head down. "Moe" I called out but no reply. I walked over to him and put my hand on his shoulder. When he turned towards me his face looked different. Eyes white, face stretch and mouth agape.  I stepped backwards in terror and fell onto my butt.

I jumped to my feet and looked back at Moe. His face was completely normal and now he just had a look of confusion on his face. "What are you doing" He asked. I asked him what was wrong and he said nothing, he had just got up to go to the bathroom like I had. I didn't mention his face to anyone. I just chalked it up to late night hallucinations. I went back to my tent and laid around for an hour or so with that face stuck in my head. Over the next few days there was a shift in the teams mood. Over the course of these fifteen days we went from happy, helpful, and kind to standoffish, mean, and rude. Not to mention no one wanted anything to do with one another. I could almost feel something dark clawing at me from the woods. The feeling of a weight on my chest and the cold damp feeling in the air made it very clear to me that whatever it was probably visited me at my lookout that night. I put the feeling behind me and we got to work. 

On the morning of the sixteenth day things really hit the fan. I got a call on the Sat phone from the Fire Captain that a family of 3 had gone missing and the camp was torn apart a few miles from us. I asked what they thought it was and he replied "We have no idea but just to keep an eye out for anyone." At about 8 A.M I woke up to Moe and Miranda fighting about which direction we should go to place the next marker. I told them about the missing family but they continued to fight. It got so bad I had to get between them. I got everyone to calm down and we started to head back to the meet up to get picked up. No one said a single word the entire 6 mile walk to the spot. Thankfully our ride was there waiting for us and everything was starting to feel better. I got back to my lookout and got unpacked. Since Ive been back I can just feel somethings off. I haven't heard anything about Jc and still I haven't heard back about the missing family yet, I'm hoping for some good news. These woods hold onto something dark and I'm gonna find out what. Ill check back in soon. T.
