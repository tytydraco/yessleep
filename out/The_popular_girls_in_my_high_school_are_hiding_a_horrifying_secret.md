In our school, there was a small group of “popular girls” but the three that everyone was crazy about were Avery, Julia, and Mady. 

I remember me and my best friend, Lenore, would both obsess over them. 

Life has been tough ever since my best friend Lenore, disappeared. No ones been able to find him. 

Our town is in Northeastern Ontario, and just like our high school, the town was small. It had a population of around 4,000, and was entirely surrounded by wilderness. 

I could never understand why anyone would want to live here. So remote, anyone could just disappear.

When Lenore went missing last year, I felt like something inside of me also went missing.

Lenore was my only friend since 6th grade. We were both outcast’s and would sit alone together at a lunch table.

The other kids would make fun of Lenore, for having a more feminine name.

Lenore was the only one in the entire town that actually understood me. 

 Ever since he disappeared in 11th grade, we’d always talk about where we’d go once we finished high school. 

We’d always fantasize about going somewhere tropical, with palm trees and warm clear water. 

Late at night, when I think of Lenore ,and all the good times we had, I begin to smile and cry at the exact same time, and it’s drove me insane. 

Now that I’m in the middle of my senior, I’ll be graduating alone. 

It’s currently the dead of winter. The temperature was about -15 as I was waiting for the bus.

At school that day, I went to the bathroom, and I saw two boys remove a mirror from the wall. Behind the mirror was a window which looked into the girls bathroom. Somebody had installed a two way mirror in the girls room, and those boys were looking at the girls from the other side. They then turned to me.

“Your not gonna tell anybody about this, right” one of the boys said.

I told them I wouldn’t, and after the girls left on the other side, the boys placed the mirror back on the wall. 

The next day when I was walking to my next class, I saw the 3 popular girls walk into the girls bathroom. 

I then sprinted to the men’s room and then locked the door behind me. 

As sick as this was, I wanted to see those girls. I lifted the mirror off the wall, and then could see the girls right in-front of me, and I could hear them too. 

They were looking even more attractive then they usually do, and I wish Lenore had been here to see this. He was always fascinated with Avery’s body. 

“It’s been over a week since we last fed him” Mady said.

“Yeah he’s probably eating his own skin by now” Julia said

What the fuck were they talking about, I thought. 

Avery then said “we’ve had him for almost a year now, If we want him to stay alive then we need to give him something to eat” 

She then pulled out a kitchen knife from her backpack, and cut off a piece of flesh from her leg. 

She then handed the knife to Julia. Julia did the exact same thing, and Julia handed the knife to Mady. 

I was absolutely horrified as I watched them put their skin in their backpacks. 

I then put the pieces together, they’ve had this thing that they were feeding, for almost a year. Lenore went missing last year. 

I couldn’t help but wonder if that was fucking Lenore. How would he survive though, the temperatures here are in the negatives. The snow gets to be about 6-8 feet deep. 

After I got home from school today, I decided I would walk across town to Avery’s house. The town we live in is so small that everyone knows each other. 

It was about a 40 minute walk on the cold and icy streets, when I arrived in-front of her house. Sure enough, Julia and Mady were also there. 

I decided I would sneak into the backyard, and hide in the tree line. I had a good view into her room. Fortunately the snow was only about a foot deep that night.

I didn’t see anything suspicious, it looked like a normal hangout.

During the winter here, the sun begins to set at around 3:30 and it’s dark by 4:00.

By 6:00 I grew tired and cold, and I was ready to do more investigations tommorow, when the back door slid open. 

The three girls were standing in the doorway, and they had the skin in their hands. They began to put their flashy jackets on and they began to walk straight into my direction.

 I got into a prone position and covered my body with snow. I could hear their voices as they entered the woods. 

They were about a hundred feet ahead of me when I emerged from the snow. They were walking straight into the heart of the forest. 

It was pitch black outside and the only light source was the half moon, which illuminated the snow. 

I began to follow in their footsteps, until I could no longer see their house. 

They kept walking deeper, and deeper, as I followed close behind them. 

It even began to snow and the girls still didn’t turn back. 

It was after what felt like an hour when the girls finally came to a stop. 

There was an opening in the woods, there were a few pieces of wood and metal scattered throughout the area, so it looked like it used to be an old hunting camp back in the day. But in the middle, was a giant hole in the ground. It was about as wide as a small living room. The girls stood right at the edge of the hole.

I then heard Avery say “We brought you something, Lenore”

After hearing that, I ran out from where I was hiding. 

“What the fuck!” I screamed.

The girls then turned to me with their hands covering their mouths. 

I looked down into the hole. It was about 30 feet deep, and at the bottom of the hole was Lenore.

I then turned to the girls. They then shoved me into the hole.

My back snapped once I hit the bottom. My arm was mangled, and a few of my ribs were poking through through my chest. 

Throughout my agony, I looked to Lenore. His eyes were dark like the night sky.

“Lenore” I cried out. 

“Don’t they look like goddesses” Lenore said while looking up at the girls.

“Why do you eat skin” I said while blood oozed out of my mouth. 

“It’s all they’ve been feeding me, human skin, animal skin” 

I was disgusted by his response. 

He then said “when you eat the exact same thing for an entire year, you start to grow an appetite for it”

“Lenore, what does that mean, your freaking me the hell out” I yelled, unable to move. He then crawled over to me.

He whispered into my ear “you’ll keep me fed for a long time”
