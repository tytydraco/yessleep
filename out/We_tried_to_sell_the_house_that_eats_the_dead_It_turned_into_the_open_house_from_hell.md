“I can’t live here anymore,” I told Aaron. “Not after what it did to Amy. [What I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1110bck/we_bought_a_house_that_eats_the_dead_we_started/).”

We were laying in bed with the lights off, ready to go to sleep. It was my least favorite time in the house, the hour when it was at its hungriest. All through every hall and room, I heard the sandpaper scratch of its invisible teeth on anything dead. There would be no hairs in the drain to fish out, no flakes of dead skin to turn to dust.

“It saved her,” he said. “Don’t forget that. If not for you doing what you did. If not for the house–”

“Maybe,” I said. “Maybe not. We’ll never know.”

I took his hands and looked him in the eye. It was a gesture we’d learned from our therapist when we did pre-marriage counseling. It was supposed to center us, to make sure the other person *really* heard.

“We need to sell this house,” I told him. “I can’t be in that position again, playing god for my sister or anyone else. We need to sell it.”

Aaron nodded.

“I’ll call the realtor in the morning.”

Aaron was as good as his word. We started looking around town for a new place, and in the meantime, ours went on the market.

Thanks to the changing interest rates, the new places we checked out were all downgrades–too small, too close to a freeway, barely any yard to speak of. But they all had one significant advantage over our current place: they weren’t fucking cursed.

“Did they even clean this place?” asked Aaron, examining the baseboards in a little ranch style place down by the railroad district.

“I don’t mind a little dust,” I said. “We’re just not used to it anymore.”

“It’s small,” he added. “Grace and Derek would have to share a room.”

“It’s good to learn to share,” I told him. “It’s perfect.”

Of course, to buy the new house, we needed to sell the old one. And that’s where things got complicated.

Whenever we discussed the sale inside, I noticed a kind of wrongness that followed, as if the house had overheard us and grown angry. Its eating became more aggressive. Food that had once taken hours to disappear was now gone in minutes. One day, sitting in a practically brand new wooden chair, it practically imploded around me. By the time I landed on the floor, the legs had turned to sawdust.

“We can’t talk about the sale inside anymore,” I said one day as Aaron finished talking through final details for an open house with the realtor. “The house isn’t happy. It doesn’t want us to go.”

“You’re projecting,” said Aaron. “The house doesn’t have… you know, a mind? It’s just a tool like we’ve always said. It’s up to us to use it smartly.”

“When the fuck did you become the world’s expert on haunted houses,” I suddenly blurted out. I had never really talked to Aaron like that. We were always mindful of each other, always a team. “I’m sorry,” I said after a few seconds. “I just–”

“You’re stressed,” he said. “I get it.

“Just, can we make sure we don’t talk about the S-A-L-E inside anymore?” I asked.

Aaron chuckled and shot me a teasing smile. “You don’t think our haunted house can spell?”

And then came the open house from hell. Our realtor, Janet, told us to stay away, but I couldn’t resist. I promised to pretend I was a prospective buyer. She didn’t like it, but after all, she worked for us.

People started trickling in around noon. Dozens of them. Janet’s eyes went wide as she mouthed, “I should have baked more cookies!”

The more I looked at the buyers, though, the more nervous I got. Most of them were single men, all shifty-eyed and nervous. Why were they looking at a single family home?

Apparently, the house attracted a certain kind of buyer. It couldn't have been the way we worded the listing–that was all boilerplate. Maybe it was the pictures we posted online. If you ask me, though, it was the house itself, calling to the type of masters it desired.

The first man I noticed couldn’t stop fidgeting. He had one tic going on in his face, another with his hands. I followed him discreetly around the kitchen, watching him slyly pocket my knives and forks. I didn’t say a word, wondering what he’d do next.

But ultimately he was small-time. After a few minutes, he excused himself and walked excitedly to his car, his pants jangling with silverware.

He turned out to be the best of the bunch.

Another man was so large he could barely walk. He ate the entire tray of cookies Janet had baked for the occasion. He left chugging a bottle of cheap wine from our pantry. I had no idea how he even got it open.

And then there was the man in the white suit. He made a beeline for Grace’s room and stood there, barely moving for maybe fifteen minutes. He breathed deeply, as if trying to inhale her lingering scent. Above him, an elephant mobile danced gently in the breeze from the air conditioner. Finally, he left, talking briefly with Janet on the way out.

As soon as he was gone, Janet sprinted up to me, practically jumping with joy.

“He *loves* it,” she said. “Willing to go full asking!”

“He only looked at the one room,” I said, trying to understand what the hell had just happened.

“Well, I guess he really liked that room,” she said.

She seemed just about ready to pop a bottle of champagne when another man approached. He was wearing filthy overalls, like he’s just put in a long day as a mechanic and hadn’t bothered to change or even shower.

“I couldn’t help but overhear,” he mumbled. “Whatever he’s offering, I’ll beat it. All cash.”

Janet raised her eyebrows.

“So then it’s… a bidding war,” she said. I could almost see her eyes turning into dollar signs. “What agent are you working with?”

“Representing myself,” muttered the man. “You tell me the price.”

He wiped his brow and then watched as the sweat disappeared off of his hand completely, the house consuming it. He smiled like a child and wiped his brow again.

“It’s a lovely home,” he told me quietly, though I didn’t recall telling him I was the owner. “Very clean.”

That night, I couldn’t sleep. After a while, I shook Aaron awake.

“We can’t sell to either of those men,” I said. “It’s… it’s not right. If either of them had the house…” A shudder went through me. “They… they can never have this house.”

“So… what then? Do we pull it off the market? Take a lower offer?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “I just know it can’t be them. It’s like you’ve always said, this house is a tool. And if the wrong person got control of it–”

I might have said more, but at that moment, we heard the sound of breaking glass downstairs, followed by the creak of a door opening. Footsteps quickly followed. Whoever it was didn’t spend more than a few moments in the entryway before heading to the staircase.

I fumbled for my phone to call the police, for all the good it would do. If someone was there to do us harm, we’d be dead long before they arrived.

“The kids,” I said jumping out of bed, but Aaron was already way ahead of me. He was at his closet door, quickly bringing down a box from a high shelf. He opened it with precise movements and then withdrew a small gun. Before I even knew what was happening, he’d loaded it and headed for the door.

“Aaron,” I whispered. “Since when do you have a–”

He held his finger to his mouth, then listened at the door as the footsteps proceeded up the stairs. We heard two, three, four steps, and then the door to Grace’s room slowly opening.

Aaron didn’t waste another second. He burst out of our bedroom door.

The next thing I heard was two gunshots and Grace’s scream.

“Aaron?” I called, but there was no response. I looked around the room for any kind of weapon and found nothing. But there was no time. I had to get our there.

I ran out of the room to find Aaron standing over the body of the man in the white suit.

“Daddy!” Grace shouted. “Daddy!”

“Shhh,” said Aaron, walking into her room. “It’s okay, honey. It’s just a nightmare, that’s all.”

Later, after Grace was sound asleep, we dragged the man to the basement. We didn’t bother to clean the trail of blood he left behind. The house would do that for us. It took everything I had to keep it together. I’d seen bodies before, but never like this, never a corpse leaking blood on my hardwood floors.

And I found I could barely look at Aaron. My heart ached with gratitude that he’d spared Grace the worst of all fates, but at the same time, I couldn’t quite comprehend the speed with which he’d shot the man. He hadn’t hesitated even a second, unloading two shots before the man’s body hit the floor.

Finally, we got the man’s body to the hot spot where we’d once put Carter’s ashes.

“Now what?” I asked.

“Now the house does the rest,” said Aaron.

“But we’ll remember.”

“But no one else will. And if no one else ever reminds us, we’ll eventually forget.”

“How the hell am I supposed to forget this?” I asked, almost crying. “Aaron. You–you killed somebody. Doesn’t that make you feel–”

“Fine,” he said. “I feel fine. Good even. Who knows how many little girls that creep got to before he–” He trailed off. “Look, maybe we could use a drink.”

And so we shared a bottle of Zinfandel as we watched the man wither and decay.

“So much for the bidding war,” said Aaron, trying to lighten the mood.

“You know what he would have done with this place,” I said with a shudder.

Aaron nodded. “I know.”

After maybe an hour, the man was gone, white suit and all, leaving nothing behind but the contents of his pockets: a small gun of his own and a set of keys.

Aaron picked up the weapon and examined it under the basement’s fluorescent light.

“Figure he must have come in planning to use this on us, then take Grace with him,” he said. “Or maybe worse.” He sniffed at the weapon, his eyebrows twitching. “Recently fired.”

He picked up the keys. “We should check his vehicle.”

We walked out into the night together. Key in hand, Aaron pushed the button repeatedly until we saw a new Subaru sedan’s lights turn on. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and peered inside. Everything was impeccably clean, almost like our house. No wonder he’d wanted to buy it.

“Check the trunk,” said Aaron, and I realized he was still holding his gun, his eyes darting back and forth around our dark suburban neighborhood, looking for threats.

As the trunk opened, I almost gagged. Inside, was the man with the overalls. He must have been dead for hours, based on how stiff he was. The man in white must have shot him in the head and then torn his eyes out with some kind of crude instrument.

“Figures,” said Aaron.

“What do we do?” I asked, fighting the rising panic.

“We take him in.”

“Can’t we just leave him?”

“In a car outside our house? Murdered by a man that the cops are going to think doesn’t exist? Who is this car even supposed to belong to in this new reality? We don’t know! So here’s what we do: we have to take him into the house and let it clean up this mess.”

I wasn’t sure if I quite followed the logic, but I knew I wasn’t emotionally equipped to deal with any of this. Already, I felt like I had stepped outside my body, that I was watching my own life play out like a movie:

We each grabbed one of the man’s hands and dragged him into the house. Had a neighbor seen us do it? Who cared? Once the house finished its works, those memories would be gone along with the dead man.

Finally, we got him down to the basement, right in the same spot we’d used just minutes before.

Aaron and I sat in silence, finishing off the rest of the wine bottle, then opening another.

“When did you buy a gun?” I asked after a few minutes.

“I’ve always had it,” he said. “I told you, I did ROTC back in college.”

“You never told me you had a gun.”

“I never wanted to use it,” he said. “Good thing I had it though, right?”

“Right,” I said, taking another drink. And for the first time in years, I looked at Aaron and saw a stranger.

“We can’t sell this house,” he said after a few minutes. “The house takes care of us. You see that now, right?”

I hugged him tight. I didn’t want to seem ungrateful for all he’d done. “If it means selling to people like them, we’ll keep it til we die.”

Later, Aaron went to bed and I decided to take a bath.

Except I didn’t run the water. I didn’t need to. All of the blood from the two dead men that had once painted my arms and tshirt was already gone. I was completely clean, just as if the night had ever happened, as if they’d never existed.

And I just lay there and lay there, waiting for Aaron to fall asleep, not wanting to hear him speak another word.

Later that week, I found myself driving though Pamela’s neighborhood. I hadn’t spoken to her since our coffee the day my nephew died. I wasn’t sure what it was, but something compelled me to walk up the steps to her door and knock.

“Welcome back,” she said. “More questions, I take it?”

“Just one,” I said. “Why did you sell the house to us? You must have had other buyers. Probably a lot of them. Why us?”

A knowing smile crossed her lips.

“Naturally with a special house like that, there are some people you just *can’t* sell it to,” she said. “And there was you two. Of course, you were just along for the ride, weren’t you? I thought maybe that was a good thing. Your husband was the one who *really* wanted the place.”

I thought back, and it was true. I hadn’t loved the house or hated it. I’d just thought it was priced pretty well. But Aaron had been head over heels, insisting we outbid a slew of other buyers.

She closed her eyes as if remembering something, and then nodded her head. For a moment, I couldn’t tell if she was afraid or amused.

Finally, she just whispered, “It does attract a certain kind of buyer, [doesn’t it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)”
