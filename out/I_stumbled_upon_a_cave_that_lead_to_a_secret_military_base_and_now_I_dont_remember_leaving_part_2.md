The drive home was quiet. I stared out the window, my reflection in the glass faintly distorted by the passing streetlights. I tried to push everything out of my mind, but the silence felt too heavy, too overwhelming. I glanced at my mom in the rearview mirror. Her eyes flicked back to the road, but I could feel her gaze linger on me for a moment longer than usual, like she was looking for something, trying to find something in me that she could recognize.



I turned my head, focusing on my reflection, forcing myself to breathe through the tightness in my chest. The soft glow from the streetlights cast strange shadows on my face, making the dark circles under my eyes stand out. My gaze locked onto my own eyes in the reflection. The moment my pupils shifted—elongating, distorting in a way that made my stomach churn—I gasped, the air catching in my throat.I felt my heartbeat spike, and my hands gripped the seat, my breath quickening. No, no, no... this isn’t real. This isn’t happening.



My mom glanced at me then, startled by my sudden movement. “What’s wrong?” she asked, her voice frantic.

I shook my head quickly, trying to push the panic down. “It’s nothing, Mom,” I said, forcing a smile, though it felt wrong, like my face couldn’t even move the way it used to. “I’m just... really tired. I think I’m just exhausted from everything, that’s all.”



She didn’t look convinced, but she didn’t push it. She just nodded and kept her eyes on the road. I tried to relax, but I couldn’t. My heart was still racing, my mind spinning, the image of those eyes burned into my brain, the shape of them like nothing I had ever seen before. I practically jolted into my room as soon as we got home, barely waiting for the door to close behind me before I threw myself onto my bed. I could feel my pulse racing again, the same panic from earlier still thrumming beneath my skin. The weight of everything felt suffocating, and I just needed to be alone.



I heard my mom’s voice calling from the hallway, faint but insistent. “Sweetie? Are you okay? Talk to me.”

But I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. I rolled onto my side, curling into myself, pulling the blanket over my head like it could shield me from the world. The door creaked open a moment later. I could hear her footsteps, slow and cautious, and then the soft sigh that followed when she saw me lying there, still as stone.

“I don’t think you’re okay,” she said, her voice full of concern. "I’m worried, honey. You’re just… you’re not yourself."

I didn't move, didn’t respond. I didn’t want to talk, didn’t want to explain any more of this mess. 

Mom sighed again, but I could feel her sitting on the edge of my bed, her weight pressing the mattress down. "I made an appointment with the doctor for tomorrow. I think we need to get to the bottom of this. The seizure, the memory loss, all of it. It’s too much to just let go."



I felt the knot in my stomach tighten. "Mom, no," I muttered into the pillow, my voice muffled. "It’s not necessary. I’m fine. Really, I am."

She paused, clearly not convinced. "You fainted, sweetie. You had a seizure. That’s not something you just brush off. We need to get it checked out, especially if it’s something serious."

I sat up, forcing myself to look at her. “It wasn’t a seizure, Mom,” I said, trying to sound convincing, even though the words felt like they were suffocating me. "I just passed out. It’s no big deal. Maybe I just didn’t eat enough today or something."

She raised an eyebrow, skeptical but still worried. “You didn’t eat enough? That doesn’t explain the seizure. I don’t care what you say, we’re going to the doctor.”

I threw my hands up in frustration, feeling my temper start to flare. “There’s no way I had a seizure! I would know if I had one, Mom... for heaven's sake! It’s not like that...damn!” I shook my head, trying to clear the fog in my mind. "I just got dizzy, and I passed out. It happens sometimes. I didn’t eat lunch, okay? I felt light-headed, and everything got blurry. That’s it."

She seemed unconvinced, but there was a quiet firmness in her expression that made me realize I wasn’t going to win this one. “I’m still making the appointment. We’ll go tomorrow.” Her voice softened. "I’m just... I’m just scared, okay? I don’t want you to be in pain, or something worse happening, and me not knowing how to help."

I could see the worry in her eyes, the tension in her shoulders. It hurt to see her like that. But I couldn’t let her know how much worse things really were. Not yet. Not when I couldn’t even make sense of it myself.

I let out a long breath, running my hands through my hair. “I’m fine, Mom. Really.”

She didn’t respond right away. Instead, she reached down and tucked the blanket more securely around me, smoothing it out like she used to when I was younger. “Okay,” she said softly. “But I’m still taking you to the doctor. I just want you to rest, alright?”

I didn’t answer. I didn’t know how to answer. She kissed my forehead gently, the warmth of her touch a stark contrast to the cold weight that settled deeper inside of me. "You’re going to be okay. I promise."

I heard her footsteps retreating, and as the door clicked shut behind her, I let out a long, shaky breath, pulling the blanket tighter around me, hoping it could somehow block out the thoughts swirling through my mind. I lay there, the blanket cocooning me, trying to ignore the chaos in my mind, trying to just rest. I squeezed my eyes shut, willing myself to drift off, but then a strange warmth washed over me. My skin prickled, and when I opened my eyes, I could see… everything in a way I never had before.



At first, it was subtle, just a slight shift in how the light looked but it didn’t take long for the world around me to change completely. I could see it. I could see it all. The soft, dim light filtering through the curtains, no longer just light. It was heat. The glow of everything around me. My mother, the furniture, the walls, everything had a layer of warmth clinging to it, like I was seeing through some strange lens. And then, I looked at my mother.



She was sitting in the doorway, her silhouette faintly glowing in hues of red and orange, her body radiating warmth in a way I couldn’t explain. The red in her form intensified, brighter than anything else in the room. Her heartbeat, her blood, everything was pulsing with this raw, vivid color, as if she were burning from the inside out, her body a live wire of heat. I gasped, the sound catching in my throat. My breath came out in a soft, panicked whimper. I quickly slapped my hand over my mouth, my fingers pressing so hard I could feel the tremor of my hand as I fought to steady my breathing. 



I didn’t want her to hear me. I didn’t want her to know that I was seeing this, that my body—my eyes—were doing something that shouldn’t be possible. The blanket over me suddenly felt like a thin veil separating me from the world, because I could see through it. Not just the dim outline of my body beneath it, but the warmth of my skin—of everything—like the fabric had become transparent to me. I could see the heat moving around me, the soft pulse of it like a map drawn in red and gold.



I squeezed my eyes shut again, trying to block it out, but when I opened them, it was still there—this new vision, this infrared sight. I could see my mother's body heat glowing brighter, brighter still, as if she were the only source of light in the room. I focused harder, trying to ground myself, but the panic kept rising, a pressure building in my chest. What is happening to me? I curled my fingers into the blanket, trying to quiet the rapid beating of my heart.



 It’s not just my eyes. It’s... it’s everything. My vision was warped—warped in a way I couldn’t control. I didn’t know how to make it stop. But I didn’t dare make a sound. If my mom knew, if she saw the fear on my face, she would think something was really wrong. And I couldn’t let her know that. 



I couldn’t let her see me like this, like something else was happening to me, something that I couldn’t even explain. I had to keep it together. I had to keep my face still, my breath even. I had to act like nothing was different. Even though everything was. I lay still, desperately trying to make sense of what was happening to me, why everything looked so... different. The warmth of my mother's body, the outline of her figure glowing through the blanket, it was all too much, too overwhelming. 



But as I tried to focus, something else happened. A sound. A whisper, faint but clear, like someone was calling my name from a distance. At first, I thought it was my imagination, but then it came again—closer this time. My ears perked up, instinctively locking onto the source of the sound. I could hear it. I could hear everything. My head snapped toward the window, my body moving without thinking, my attention laser-focused. \*What’s taking over me…\*
