Hi, this is very out of the usual for me. I'm Joshua Riley. I'm a junior in high school, have a part time job at a mini-mart in my town, very run of the mill. I'm not really sure what to say, I just found out about this place when I was looking for something to share whatever this is.  
  
I'm getting ahead of ourselves, let me start over. I'm sorry all this is so unfocused and scatterbrained, I hope to fine-tune it the more I post.  
  
Ever since I've been little very imaginative and have always had extremely detailed dreams that feel like they go on for ages. Most of the time these dreams are actually realistic (or at least random shit like flying or anything like that, even if the people in them act a little weird sometimes.), but always have me in different scenarios, jobs or different people (I don't know how I'm not me, I can tell I'm just not me). I also usually fully remember my dreams too (at least with events).   
Ya-da ya-da, I have a strong imagination, you get the point.  
  
But within the past month or so I've been noticing this weird fugue when I'm in-between consciousness and sleep, like I can sense and feel my dreams starting in my head. And when I sense this happening I'm always a on looker in my mind, like I'm watching these people and settings form, but if I keep watching I fall asleep and can't pay attention or if I look harder I become self aware and it fades with my consciousness coming back.  
  
Many times before I've thought of starting a dream journal but it always felt weird, like I'm writing someone else's story, not my own or one I've created. But now I'm going to start documenting because I feel like this is some weird phenomenon or something, I don't know.  
What do I even call these things? Liminals? Fugues? Fuminals? If you have a better idea let me know, I'm just gonna call it a Lim for now. Unlike most of my dreams, I can't remember almost anything from a Lim after a couple minutes (whether I fall asleep or regain consciousness) I just know that it happened, so I'll just put in the time whenever I wake up from one so you know, you know?  
  
  
\[this is a note from the future (may 2nd, 2024, 9:45 P.M), letting you know that I write what happened in the Lim  i always write that first, anything that doesn’t talk about the Lim directly is written afterward because there is no way I’d be able to remember it if I went in chronological order.\]

I just decided to go to bed after going fugue(?) while talking to some friends online, I'm so tired.  
  
So in the Lim I imagined two people talking, one was a man in a suit while the other was a woman in a dress. I don't know the colors or even their faces, but I know they were in the street at night and the whole time they talked just very muffled. When I decided to focus and listen in this is what I heard \[this is from memory so some of it has faded in the past couple minutes unfortunately\]:  
  
  
Man: Walked through the meadow plain.  
Woman: Is the forest clear of frogs?  
  
Man: Blind to frogs, but the <      >  
  
Woman: Fear the meadow trees see.  
  
Man: <     > but blind to frogs, if seeing trees, frogs leap.  
  
Woman: In fact. <    > interchange, I feel the trees gaze.  
  
Man: flames in the forest.  
  
After that they just stood in the street staring. I’m starting to think this whole thing is stupid, what the hell even was that? I can’t even remember it myself now, just the writing. I’m not going to post just yet, obviously when I do, I do, I’ll just just jot shit down if anything else “happens'’ or if I feel anything is important, I feel like there is something big that I forgot in the Lim though.   
  
Night.

Currently in the last hour of my shift in the mart, my friend Sam came by to bullshit some, he’s your average dimwitted stoner, about 5’9, a medium on the whiteness scale with short brown hair and chronically single, (since we’re on the topic, I’m a intellectual myself, about 5’7, tan as printer paper, have long, straight olive green hair \[colored for style of course\] and am a bachelor 17 years in the making.) when he came in he was going on about how “they don’t know how to make good sitcoms anymore”, something about how when you smoke it makes the show 10x funnier but they’re so bad that he still doesn’t laugh. Probably a third through his rant I began dozing behind the counter. This time, (still hearing his muffled rambling in the background) I was me, I was in a room that was probably 5ft by 5ft, had white painted walls and a wooden floor and was completely empty (no door either). One of the walls had a window that I decided to look out of. The outside was a grassy forest that seemingly stretched forever, but where the house I was in casted a shadow, it was completely void of grass, there stood a tree (a pine tree I think?)  that was completely barren, the ground where the grass would’ve been looked almost purplish.  
I felt like there was someone behind the tree so I tried to focus harder before I felt the presence of something behind me. When I turned around the room was gone and I think I started to hear a deep voice boom from all around me, for the life of me I can’t tell if it said “I” or “you”, both feel completely correct. Then I awoke from the fugue by a shithead blowing pot smoke in my face, then laughing his ass off because he thought he scared the shit out of me.

I don’t know what all this is, I don’t know if it means something, if I’m going crazing or if I just completely passed the perfect explanation online, but this is weird and I want to share everything for as long as it goes on.  
  
And can someone find a better name than “Lim”?
