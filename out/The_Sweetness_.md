"When your a grown man and still have yet to feel a woman's touch, I beseech you to never stray off of your morals and principles As in waiting a whole lifetime will always in the end be stronger and more pure in the way we think about and experience true love."



Its been a grueling last two weeks, but finally, I'm home. It was a duplex on a quiet little street on the outskirts of our small community here, Hudson. The duplex had 2 other tennants a woman and a man. The landlord didn't really tell me much about them except that the man has been here for a while and the woman has taken residence here right before I did. A woman. As a 33 year old virgin the idea of living in the same house with a girl excited me. Maybe I'll get to know her overtime I thought. Maybe we'll become friends and hang out sometimes. Maybe this new chapter of my life will turn out good for once, I could only hope.


The sun was setting on a beautiful October 9th sky. A nice breeze flowed through my new home from the opened windows all over the apartment. The smell of the autumn air filled my lungs as I sat on my recliner and relaxed with a cold beer and some pizza while watching playoff baseball. The Detroit tigers had a nice 3 run lead against Cleveland guardians. In this moment everything seemed pretty perfect. It felt so good to be in a new home. My own home. After the game ended I turned off the TV and went to my bed to sleep. But when I went to turn off my lamp I heard a knock on the door.



I got up and answered the door. But to my surprise no one was there. I looked down the hall both ways. To my left was the front door and my right was the stairs that went to up to my neighbors apartment. Ahead of me across the hallway was where the woman lived. As I looked back and forth a couple times I went back inside and locked up and called it a night. Hmm maybe some kids or something I didn't think much of it and layed down and drifted peacefully to sleep.

I woke around 8:30am. The sun rays coating my upper chest and face was a pleasant way to greet the new day. After a nice long shower I went to my kitchen to get some food, leftover pizza. After I was done I headed to the front door. There was some stuff I needed for the new place. As soon as I entered my living room I heard something. It was quiet but I knew exactly what it was. It was the sound of people having sex.


A quick glance to my left I found the source. It was my TV. And after studying the screen for a few seconds I realized it was my porn that was playing. I didn't remember watching this last night. I drank quite a bit but I remembered the end of last night. The knock. Nobody there. And then brushing it off and hitting the hay. I guess I just don't remember it, not that part. I concluded. I Then popped the DVD out and turned everything off. After that I left. On my way out I seen only my car was here. When will I get to meet my neighbors? I thought as I drove away from the property.



I got home 2 hours later and seen that nobody was still here. While walking up to the front stoop, a car pulled in. A Toyota corolla. I watched them park and gave them a friendly wave, it was hard to see the person through the window glare. After a few seconds a man got out. He had a hat on backwards with Levi jeans and a red faded shirt, covered by a red checkeredless flannel. In his hands he held his keys and a bag of groceries or something. I waved again, thinking he didn't see me the first time. He waved back and I waited for him as he walked up to the house.



"Hi there" he said while approaching.

"Hey, how's it going" I replied

"Its good, I take it your the new guy?"

"Yea just moved in last night." I said while shuffling my bags around in my hands.

"Cool nice to meet ya, I'm upstairs, my name is Vore." 

"Nice to meet ya man I'm dennis."
 I propped the door open with a door stopper with my feet for him to enter. After we both got inside we put our bags down In The narrow hallway and shook hands. A group of kids walked by outside and distracted both of us as they were being loud and goofing off. I grabbed my bags while watching them pass by through the doorway. 

"Hey, umm later on around 1 I'm gonna be popping a bottle and watching the game, so if you get bored or whatever your more than welcome to come down and chill out if you want man."

He was already walking away on his way upstairs when he turned around and said "Okay, I'll keep that in mind friend."

He continued up the stairs and I heard him shut his door behind him. 

I walked into my home, feeling significantly better that I finally met one of my neighbors. Then I wondered when I'll meet the girl across the hall. Just let it happen naturally like my encounter with vore did. I thought what a strange name, never met someone with that name before. After putting away my groceries and new home items I realized one of the bags weren't mine. The contents were just one item, a bundle of short flowers. With a closer look it seemed they were freshly pulled with roots and all.


I quickly understood why I had this bag. It was vore's. I must have accidently grabbed it while collecting my own. On my way to his apartment I seen another car pull in from my living room window. It's her I bet. I contemplated taking vores bag to him right away as I might miss the chance to meet her. Eventually I decided to say screw it, she fucking lives here! I will meet her at one time or another inevitably so I just took myself to vores door. As I was walking up the stairs I heard the front door open up. I kept walking to vores door though determined to return his bag to him.
When I got to the landing that led 10 feet towards his door, I heard the noise of sex again. 


As I creeped closer to make sure I actually heard what I heard, the sound diminished. And then it was silent, until the sound of a door closing downstairs broke it. I decided to just walk up and knock on the door. When I got there it felt very warm, light shined through the cracks of the door and it smelled different than downstairs. It smelled sweet. Right when I went to knock I heard a sound inside. It was a gasp, loud and defeating. Then a long loud exhale. I stood there with my fist in the air. Then all of a sudden the warm air got chilled. Like a ac was blowing directly at the door. A few seconds went by and I heard talking. 


As I stood there ready to knock I listened hard. And the voice said, "have you seen it?"

It was solid and medium in volume, continued over again. The cold air kept creeping through the door. And the hallway was silent except for that one phrase repeating again. "Have you seen it?" 

It was vore. Talking to himself, and just repeating that same line over and over again.

"Have you seen it?" "Have you seen it?" "Have you seen it??"have you seen it???"
The whole time his voice seemed weak. But still loud as he delivered the words with innocence until they turned to malice. Until he stopped altogether. This is freaky I thought. Should I just drop the bag at his doorstep? Or give it to him in person? I went for the former and just left. The cold air mixed into warm as I left in the upstairs hallway. Then went back inside my home.


A couple days passed since that weird situation. And still no random meeting with the woman of the house. She seemed to be avoiding me I thought. O well

The next day I was off again. Full week vacation is beautiful. And finally I can have a friend come by. Still haven't met mystery girl from across the hall. It was too much so I decided to hang with some guys. Some friends.  We met up, at a bar outside of town. A nice low lake pub, about 10 miles from my home. We had some drinks and decided to take the small party back to Hudson. When we got there as usual the others cars were absent. So we fumbled into my home while being quite drunk during the time. As we got in and settled my friend chilled out on the couch while I got drinks.  Until a knock happened upon the door. 


Me, yelling from the kitchen said "get the door will ya?"  And a view downrange showed him answer the door. I continued shuffling around the kitchen until I was ready to return to the living room. When I did return he was gone. So I checked the bathroom and he wasn't there. I checked the master room just incase he passed out on my bed for some reason but he wasn't there. So I went into the hall.


When I looked out into the hallway I seen feet climbing the stairs. It was cut off and I nonchalantly called for him.

"Jake"
" yoo Jake what are you doing man?"
He kept walking up
As I walked towards the stairs I kept calling his name. "Jake, hey jake?" 
When i got to the base of the stairs I seen the back of a head retreat into the darkness of the top hallway. 
"Jake what the hell are you doing man?"
No response from the dark.
"Jake" cmon man" 
Still nothing
At that moment I heard it again, it was faint but making it's point. It was sex sounds again.
I look back at the long hallway that connected everyone here, but the sound was muffled. As I backtracked, the sound got louder. Until I was in front of my door.



I left my door cracked, and from the room the sounds of passionate lovemaking seeped through the opening like it's been waiting a lifetime to expose. When I checked, it was mine again, set up and playing full blast. The other dvds from the set layed on my coffee table, all face up. I looked around, trying to find someone. Someone who shouldn't be here.  
"Alright show yourself here right now before I call the cops" I had no weapons or guns. 
 that was easy to say until I realized my friend is still upstairs alone. I hope he was alone.


No matter how scared I was at this moment I had only one obligation. It was to get my boy back from the upstairs. So I trudged upstairs to confront the situation first hand. After pounding on the door for a minute i heard a voice from the bottom of the stairs. It's said loudly "are you okay?"

I turned back, and ran back to the top looking down the stairs a shadow ridden woman, her body cloaked in dark shade as her face popped out with soft light gently revealing her face from the hallway glow. When she stepped forward closer, I knew it had to be the neighbor girl. 


" your the neighbor? I need your help quickly!" She looked at me confused then slowly started walking up the stairs. 

"My friend walked in here earlier, this is vores home, I don't know why he went it or how but he's in there. Please help me get him out."
She keeps slowly ascending the stairs while locking eyes with me. 
"the door is locked, idk why but I know my friend came up here."
The girl continued climbing the stairs, are you gonna help me? I thought, her eyes stood still while the rest of her body seemed to move. 
"Did you see it?"
She asked calmly 
"What?"
"See what?"

"Did you see it?" She said while slowly walking towards me

Each step she took throught the dark stairway, she revealed herself more.

Shirt and pants dropping, as she walzed towards me, each time she stepped she seemed more motivated while slowly dropping her clothes. Through the darkness. 

Eventually she was completely nude. And approaching me.

"What?" I splurted out, now backing up the stairs.

"He saw it. Why can't you?

After a few seconds I realized I was trapped with my back to vore's door.

"Please my friend, he needs help." I pleaded hoping for a peaceful resolution 

"You will see it." 
"Come with me"
"Come be with me and forget all this"
She flaunted her naked body at me
I kept backing up until I hit the door
She moved up on me
"No" 
I exclaimed while dodging her hand
She reached out and I fell backwards
The door opened
I fell straight to the floor
My head snapped back while falling, then I   Twisted myself straight to see
I rubbed my eyes and looked foward
Old music flooded my brain while the smell of deep sour assaulted my senses. The ground had normal carpet, until I looked  farther.
And then I saw it.




 The end.
