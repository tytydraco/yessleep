# PART ONE

# Journal Entry — June 3rd, 2024 — 8:42 p.m.

If anything ever happens to me, I want there to be a record—my own words, unpolished and unedited. Maybe this is dramatic, or maybe it’s just nerves from starting over my entire life. Still, something inside me insists I track everything, beginning to end. Today I moved into a new apartment. A new chapter, a new season. I keep telling myself I’m shedding my old skin the way trees shed their blossoms in spring—messy, but hopeful. I’m exhausted from the move, but also relieved to finally have a space of my own. The exhaustion lingers, but so does a small, growing sense of comfort. I think this place could finally feel like mine. —Nora

  


The first thing I noticed about Oregon wasn’t the green—everyone talks about the green—but the *weight* of the air. The sky here sits low, almost like it’s trying to rest its chin on the rooftops. When I stepped out of the rideshare with my last suitcase, the wind smelled faintly of moss and cold metal, as if rain were always waiting just behind the clouds.

I stood on the curb for a moment, staring up at the apartment complex. Hollow Creek Residences. The building was simple: beige siding, forest-green trim, balconies dotted with plants, a few wind chimes that moved even when the air was still. 

The manager, Mr. Halstrom, met me at the bottom of the stairs. He looked like he was built out of rectangles—square shoulders, square jaw, square glasses, even a square patch where his hair refused to grow. His voice rumbled like distant thunder.

“You must be Nora,” he said, shaking my hand with both of his. “Welcome to Hollow Creek. If you need anything—maintenance, parking adjustments, replacement keys—my office is the one with the orange doormat. Hard to miss.”

“Thank you,” I said. “I’m just glad to be here.”

“Well,” he nodded, “people usually are, at first. The rain chases some away, but others find it… comforting.” He tilted his head. “Which type are you?”

“I guess we’ll see.”

He laughed, a single booming note, and helped me haul my boxes up the stairs to Unit 2 B.

Inside, the apartment greeted me with the scent of new paint and empty cabinets. The walls glowed with morning light; the carpeting felt smooth and beige beneath my feet. A tiny but charming balcony overlooked a hedge of pine. In the living room, all was bare but for the soft hum of the refrigerator and the echo of our footsteps.

“This’ll do nicely,” he said. “Quiet neighbors. The woman next door, Ellie, is very friendly. Works from home most days. I think you two will get along.”

I didn’t know then how important Ellie would become. Or how much trouble that would bring.

He gave me my keys, left me with a final square handshake, and returned downstairs.

Alone in the apartment, I let out a long breath. Relief replaced the tension I hadn’t realized I was holding in my body. My muscles slowly uncoiled—only then did I notice how much I’d been bracing myself for months.

I unpacked for hours. My belongings felt both too sparse and too heavy. Isn’t it strange how life fits into boxes, but splits apart when you try to spread it out? I stacked books on the kitchen counter because I didn’t know where the bookshelf should go. I propped my mattress against the wall until I could figure out the bedframe. My plants lined up near the balcony door—little survivors, like me.

But one corner of my bedroom remained stubbornly empty. A slanted angle of the wall is illuminated by the afternoon glow. It somehow looked *hungry*, as if it expected something to fill it. I didn’t think much of it at the time. Just interior-design frustration.

By late afternoon, I heard a soft knock.

When I opened the door, a petite woman with honey-brown curls stood smiling at me. She wore a soft blue sweater, the sleeves pushed up unevenly, and her expression radiated warm, easy energy.

“You must be the new tenant,” she said. “I’m Ellie. I’m your neighbor directly across the hall. I brought coffee because everyone needs caffeine on move-in day.”

She handed me a paper cup with a little heart drawn on the lid.

“Oh,” I said, startled but grateful. “Thank you. I’m Nora. And I absolutely do need this.”

“Thought so.” Ellie peeked past me into the apartment. “Need help unpacking? I’m great at organizing, terrible at assembling furniture, but I can definitely hand you screws and cheer you on.”

“Honestly? Yes. Please.”

She grinned. “Perfect. Let me grab my slippers. My real shoes are a lie.”

Ellie returned a minute later in fuzzy slippers shaped like sleeping foxes.

We unpacked together. I learned bits of her in the way people reveal themselves when their hands are busy. She’d lived here three years. She worked remotely, editing articles for a travel website. She knew every coffee shop within ten miles and which ones had the least pretentious barista. But she also seemed lonely in a way she tried to mask with big smiles and louder laughter. Even as we joked, I recognized the surface cheer hiding a familiar emptiness. Loneliness can spot itself in others like a reflection; feeling this, I shifted from comfort to quiet understanding.

As we arranged my bedroom furniture, Ellie nodded toward the empty corner.

“You planning something there? A reading nook? Plant corner? Shrine to your future successes?”

I sighed. “I don’t know. It feels too empty, but I can’t think of what should go there.”

She tapped her chin dramatically. “Mirror? A big decorative one? This room would look twice as big with one.”

“You think?”

“Oh, totally. And there’s this place downtown—Second Chances. They sell old furniture and restored antiques. Sometimes weird stuff, but fun weird.” She wiggled her eyebrows. “Want to check it out? I can drive.”

I hesitated. I’d barely moved in. But the idea of filling that corner, of settling the room properly, tugged at me.

“Sure,” I said. “Let me grab my wallet.”

Ellie clapped her hands. “Adventure.”

We left the apartment as the sky dimmed toward evening. In Oregon, dusk appears as if someone has dipped the world in watercolor—soft blues blend into purples. Building edges blur beneath settling clouds.

In Ellie’s car, she talked the whole way, her voice bouncing between topics.

“So what brought you here?” she asked.

“A fresh start,” I said simply.

She glanced at me. “Running from something or running toward something?”

“Maybe both.”

She nodded like she understood. “Same.”

We pulled up to Second Chances, a wide, dimly lit storefront with mismatched lamps in the window and a bell above the door that sounded like it had smoked for most of its life.

Inside, the air smelled of old wood, dust, and lemon polish. Warm but patchy lighting left pockets of shadow. In those shadows, tall wardrobes loomed like silent sentries. Every piece of furniture seemed to have a story, even if the stories never actually happened.

“Isn’t this place great?” Ellie said, spinning slowly to take it in.

“It’s… something,” I murmured. It felt like a museum of forgotten lives.

We wandered past shelves of trinkets and towering armoires until Ellie stopped so abruptly I bumped into her.

“There,” she whispered, pointing.

Against the far wall, half-caught in the glow of a mismatched lamp, stood a tall, antique mirror. Its frame was dark walnut, carved with curling floral designs and slightly uneven, giving it a handcrafted feel. The glass was clean, but the reflection looked deeper than it should have, as if I might fall forward into it instead of just seeing a copy of myself.

Ellie nudged me. “That. That is the mirror for your room.”

I stepped closer. My reflection stared back—tired, hair a mess from moving, dark circles under my eyes—but the glass softened me, as if it forgave my exhaustion.

“It’s beautiful,” I said.

“And perfect,” she added. “Let’s get it.”

A man in a green flannel appeared beside us. I swear he moved too silently for someone wearing heavy boots.

“Interested?” he asked.

“Yes,” Ellie said immediately.

“I… think so,” I added.

He smiled, but his eyes didn’t. “It’s an old piece. Hand-carved. Came in a few weeks ago.”

“Do you know where it came from?” I asked.

He shrugged. “Estate sale. The usual. But it’s sturdy. Good craftsmanship. Most people don’t make things like this anymore.”

I nodded, running my fingers along the carved wood. It felt warm, as if it had been sitting in sunlight even though this part of the shop was dim.

Ellie bounced on her toes. “We’ll take it.”

The man wrapped it carefully in quilted pads and helped carry it to her car. The mirror barely fit diagonally across the backseat.

As we drove home, I kept glancing at it in the rearview mirror. The surface caught bits of passing headlights, stretching them into long streaks as if they were being pulled inward.“You’re going to love it,” Ellie said. “It’s going to make your room feel alive.”

“Alive,” I echoed quietly. A strange word choice, but I didn’t mention it.

When we got back to the apartment, we carried the mirror upstairs—carefully, slowly—and placed it in the corner of my bedroom. It fit the space perfectly. Almost too perfectly, like the corner had been waiting for it.

Ellie exhaled dramatically. “Ugh, look at that. A masterpiece.”

“It does look good,” I admitted.

“Text me if you need anything tonight,” she said. “If you get lonely or spooked or whatever. I’m right across the hall.”

“I will. Thank you.”

She smiled, warm and sincere. “Welcome home, Nora.”

After she left, I stared at the mirror longer than I meant to. My reflection stood quietly, tired and small. Something in the image felt… expectant. I shook it off. Moving fatigue. Too much coffee. Too much emotion for one day.

I brushed my teeth, crawled into bed, and listened to the soft Oregon rain finally starting to fall. It tapped gently against the window like fingertips drumming a lullaby.

The mirror is in place now. The room feels balanced. Strange how one object can settle everything. I’m exhausted, but in a good way. I’ll write more tomorrow—my eyes won’t stay open. Nothing weird to report. Just rain and quiet and the sense that I’ve done something right today. For once. —Nora

  
  


# PART TWO

# JOURNAL ENTRY — June 18th, 2024 — 9:42 PM

The apartment still smells faintly of paint and sawdust, like the place itself is trying to pretend it’s newer than it is. I’m not sure if that’s comforting or deceitful. I’m writing tonight because the mirror feels… wrong. Not overtly—nothing dramatic enough to sound sane when put on paper—but off, like a song almost on beat but not quite.

Last night, I swore the reflection lagged a fraction of a second when I walked past it. It was the kind of delay you’d blame on a bad video call. I stood there afterward, watching myself breathe, telling myself I was imagining things. I’ve been stressed. Exhausted. Moving does that.

I haven’t told Ellie. She’d just laugh and say I need actual sleep.

Still… something feels strange. Maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m overreacting.

But writing it down makes me feel like I’m anchoring myself to something real.

—Nora



I had almost forgotten about the weird feeling around the mirror. Almost.

The morning light came in pale and slanted, filtered through clouds that never fully lifted in June. Oregon summer always takes its time arriving. The air smelled like damp pavement and someone’s distant laundry detergent. I made coffee, sat on the couch, and told myself I’d get used to living alone again. That I just needed a routine.

But the mirror kept pulling at the corner of my attention.

It didn’t help that every time I walked past my bedroom door, I caught myself glancing inside—not fully on purpose, not fully by accident. It was as if my eyes were checking for something before I had time to think about what.

I avoided the mirror for the first few days. Not intentionally, not as a rule—just the way someone avoids a sour memory. Every time I nearly caught my reflection, I felt a little pinch inside my ribs, like my body wanted to warn me before my mind understood why.

Everything else in the apartment felt normal. The pipes clanked at predictable hours. The creaky stairwell outside my door kept its same old rhythm, like an elderly dog pacing up and down the hallway. Mrs. Harrington watered her plants on the balcony and waved at me even if we made eye contact for only half a second. Familiarity was settling in.

But the mirror was the one unfamiliar thing, the one object that didn’t seem to belong to the apartment or to me. It felt like a guest that hadn’t been invited, sitting too close, listening too intently.

Ellie showed up mid-afternoon wearing a yellow raincoat even though it wasn’t raining. She said it “felt like rain,” and sometimes in Oregon that’s enough reason to carry one.

“Noraaa,” she sing-songed as she knocked twice and then twice again, her signature rhythm. “Open up—your favorite person is here!”

“You weren’t invited,” I joked as I let her in.

She strutted inside anyway, plopping onto my couch with the confidence of someone who had purchased it herself.

“I brought you pastries,” she said, holding out a small bakery box. “You looked like you needed sugar last time.”

I rolled my eyes. “I don’t *look* like I need sugar.”

“You always look like you need sugar,” she said. Then, squinting. “Also… sleep. And possibly therapy.”

“That’s just my face,” I muttered.

She laughed, her voice bright enough to push the shadows in my apartment back a few inches.

We talked for an hour—about her new coworker (“*He smells like arrogance and expensive cologne*”), about her cat’s recent vet visit, and about whether or not I was adjusting. She asked to see the mirror again.

“You haven’t decorated around it yet,” she said. “It needs a plant. Or maybe fairy lights. Or—OMG—we should put one of those vintage scarves over the corner, dramatic fortune-teller vibes—”

“I don’t want anything over it,” I said too quickly. I felt the stiffness in my voice right away.

She blinked. “O-kay, mysterious,” she teased. “I didn’t know your mirror had boundaries.”

I forced a smile. “It just looks better clean.”

“Well,” she said, clapping her hands together, “let’s get you out of this weird mood. Fresh air. Walk. Now.”

And because Ellie has the emotional force of a very cheerful tornado, I let her drag me outside.

That night, alone in the apartment again, I noticed it for the second time.

I stepped into my bedroom to set my phone on the charger, and as I passed the mirror, my reflection… hesitated.

Not much. Not dramatically. A sliver of a second, just long enough for my heart to roll over in my chest like a startled animal.

I froze. Slowly, I lifted my right hand.

My reflection followed.

But the lag—subtle as a whisper—was there.

I stood staring at it for too long. My eyes watered from not blinking. My breath stuttered.

When I stepped away, the reflection seemed to finish the motion a hair late, as if it were adjusting into place.

I backed out of the room.

All night I kept telling myself I’d miss. The human brain invents motion in stillness, fills in gaps, and tricks itself.. That I was just tired.

But the seed of dread had already been planted somewhere deep—like a thorn under skin you can’t reach.

I didn’t sleep well. Every dream felt like walking through fog with someone’s footprints appearing just behind mine.

The next morning, I put a blanket over the mirror.

I didn’t plan to. I didn’t even think about it. I was brushing my teeth when I saw the corner of the mirror through the doorway and felt my stomach twist. I grabbed the nearest thing—an old navy-blue throw blanket—and thumbtacked it across the frame.

It wasn’t graceful. Or even a good solution. But I felt better immediately, as if a wound had been covered.

Ellie stopped by later that evening to bring me soup because she decided I “sounded weird over text.”

She wandered into my room and stood there staring at the covered mirror.

“Nora,” she said, “did you seriously put a blanket over your very fancy antique mirror? Where’s the aesthetic? The drama?”

“It’s temporary,” I said.

“Why?”

I shrugged. “Just didn’t feel like looking at myself lately.”

Ellie’s face softened. “If it’s that depression thing again—”

“It’s not depression,” I said quickly.

“You sure?”

“I’m fine,” I lied. “Just tired.”

She accepted it without pushing. That’s the thing about Ellie—she can read people, but she doesn’t pry unless you ask her to.

She patted my arm. “Okay. But if you start covering other reflective surfaces, I’m staging an intervention.”

I laughed. It felt stiff in my throat.

I went to bed feeling more at ease than I had in days.

The blanket over the mirror helped. It made the room feel more normal, like I had shut something out. I fell asleep quickly.

I don’t know what woke me—maybe the wind rattling the balcony railing, maybe my own heartbeat, maybe something else entirely.

When I opened my eyes, the room was dim, lit only by the soft blue of the streetlamp outside.

And the blanket was gone.

Not fallen.

Not on the floor.

It was folded. Neatly. Precisely. Sitting on the edge of the bed, like someone had prepared it for the morning.

My breath caught. For a moment, I couldn’t even move.

The mirror stood uncovered across the room, reflecting my small, trembling shape sitting up in bed.

I stared into it.

My reflection stared back.

But I couldn’t shake it—the sense that it had been awake longer than I had.



# JOURNAL ENTRY — June 25th, 2024 — 1:17 AM

I didn’t want to write this, but I have to. The blanket came off the mirror. Not just came off—someone folded it. I can’t explain that. I don’t know how to make that make sense.

Maybe I’m sleepwalking. Maybe I’m stressed. Maybe my brain is trying to tell me something.

But the mirror is uncovered now.

And I swear—when I looked at it tonight—I wasn’t alone in the room.

I don’t know what to do. But writing it down makes me feel less like I’m slipping.

—Nora
