I have a few preferences. The faster it pours, the better, almost always. Where it lands matters too. Windows are fine. Leaves, absolutely not. Roofs, yes. Car roofs… no answer; I’ve already dozed off.

It’s the low vibrations I want. The thud of each drop, not a hiss. And above all else, no thunder. Thunder ruins everything. It yanks me out of the trance, hands flailing for my phone in the dark. What’s worse, though, are the *other* sounds. The ones I can’t quite place. They sit beneath the track, too faint to name, either intentional or a sloppy mistake left in a cheap recording.

I’m three-quarters asleep when it happens. My thoughts aren’t words anymore, just loose images. The rain settles into my ears, and the tension drains from my neck. Behind my eyelids, memory sharpens. I’m a kid again, asleep in the back of a Honda Odyssey, a Game Boy warm in my lap. I don’t remember ever feeling safer.

Then something cuts through the rain.

Not loud. Not clear. Just enough.

A voice, reduced to its thinnest consonants, slipping between the drops.

“Sit still while it sinks in.”

It’s a single motion. I lift myself up and throw the CPAP off my face. My eyes peer into the dark where the face should be, an intruder at my bedside, something poised over my stomach, meant to sink in.

My arm rises. My knuckle taps the control panel on my headboard. The lights flick on. I’m alone. The rain continues, its crispness dulled by the whoosh of my nasal mask.

I turn off the CPAP, shut off the rain, and stand at my apartment door, listening for voices. Maybe it’s neighbors in the hall—late-night conversations softened by insulation into something that almost sounds like a whisper meant for me. 

There is nothing. Nobody. My building feels lifeless. The lights in the hall set to dim without presence.

There’s only so much investigating I can do before I catch sight of the time and realize I’ve got to get back to bed or I’ll be late to work in the morning.

\*\*\*

I’ve never caught the specific track that’s playing. Before bed, I tell my Google Nest to “play rain sounds,” and it pulls something at random from Spotify’s endless library. When I open Spotify on my phone, it’s often out of sync with the speaker, so the track itself has no meaning at all.

There’s a *Rain Sounds* playlist Spotify claims it “made for me,” sitting at the front of the app in the recommendations. If it’s really built from metadata, it should reflect what I actually listen to at night. The same names keep appearing: NATURALIS, Find Your Balance, Xeo Xu, and Napt1me Therapy.

It used to be easy to learn about artists when music had to come through a major label. Now Spotify lets in a flood of indie work through low-barrier aggregators, some of it effectively anonymous. I tried to find what I could about these artists.

NATURALIS was the easiest. It had a full website explaining the project, a recordist activist nephew and uncle raising money for conservation. Given that I usually skip anything too earthy or naturalistic, I ruled it out quickly.

Find Your Balance had dozens of albums on YouTube, all clearly labeled royalty-free music for yoga classes and meditation studios.

Xeo Xu felt like it might actually be a name. Searching it turned up rap beats for sale on BeatStars. I pictured an entrepreneur building synthetic rain in Ableton, hoping to make a few dollars from sleep playlists.

The most unsettling of the four was Napt1me Therapy. Outside Spotify, it barely existed. The artist’s photo was an AI baby. The eyes were too big, too blue. A single blond tuft looked painted on.

The album covers didn’t help. Cribs in dark rooms. Rain streaking windows. Illuminated by moonlight, porch lights, or passing headlights. Sometimes the light came from inside. Doors cracked open. Shadows shredded the glow into unrecognizable shapes of AI-slop.

Then there were the titles. Innocent at a glance, but resistant to context. Any connection I tried to make bent toward something darker.

One album was called *1*. Three tracks: “Something Has Changed,” “Describe It In Detail,” “You Left the Window Open.”

Another followed the same year: *It’s Functioning as Intended*. Four tracks: “It’s Functioning as Intended,” “Is It Meant for Me,” “Cornered Again,” and “Stop Looking Concerned.”

I played this one from the beginning.

The rain was perfect. Like marbles dropping onto paper. I lay back, a nap suddenly plausible. The sound splashed through my cochlea. My cat climbed into my lap. It felt good to be alone.

Then the artifact returned. That sibilant murmur. It could have been anything if I hadn’t just read the words twice in the last fifteen minutes.

“It’s functioning as intended.”

I tested it. Played it for a friend. He heard nothing. Just a finger scraping a live microphone.

“Interference,” he said. “Like those ghost-hunter shows. You’re assigning meaning.”

Maybe I am.

But I’m begging you. If anyone out there knows how to isolate this, how to detect it, I need help. I messed around with Bandcamp as a kid. I barely know what I’m doing. I don’t even know how to record audio off Spotify.

And I need to know whether that voice is really there.

Edit: To those who reached out, thank you. I got it downloaded now and I think this stem splitter program should do all the work for me.
