I'd like to first apologize if my grammar mistakes were all over the place; English wasn't my first language.  
I'd also like to say that I don't have any religion and I am currently working as a researcher in a neuroscience lab so I don't believe in ghosts. However this truly happened and everything I said was true.

Here's the story:

When I was in middle, my parents sent me to a Christian boarding girls high school, not cause our family is Christian but simply cause they thought a boarding school would be nice for a misbehaving girl like me. Auyways, every Thursday around sunset, all students and teachers will gather in a big hall to pray and listen to talks about Christ. I remember I had this urge to leave so I lied to my teacher that I need to go to the bathroom cause I was feeling uncomfortable, and I left early.

The entire school was quiet and it felt nice to just be alone. I wandered around the campus and suddenly I saw this girl in long blue dress, dancing weirdly on the grass. She has really long black hair, all the way to her hips. And she was short, I couldn't see her face but judging from her height, she is definitely younger than any students in the school.

It was extremely weird cause our school barely opens for outsiders, and our entire school is in the mountains, with tall walls surrounding the entire campus (I mean, it is a Christian school with female students only), there's no way people could just sneak in. But I thought she must be the daughter of one of the teachers. I walked towards her cause I wanted to tell her that it is forbidden to be on the grass, but before I could speak, she ran all the way across the grass field and ran up the stairs. I have never in my life seen anyone run that fast by the time I notice she's already on the second floor. (the stairs are on the side of the building so I could see her from the ground).

I have no idea why but at that moment I decided to chase after her. I ran as fast as possible and I could see her already on the highest floor of the building when I was still at the second floor. When I finally got to the top floor, she was gone. I searched every room in that floor but all the rooms are either empty or locked. There's only one staircase in this building, how did she just vanish? Just when I was standing in front of my classroom in shock (my classroom happens to be on the top floor), my classmates who just come back from the hall saw me and asked what happened. I told them exactly what happened and they went mad and started yelling at me "WHY DID YOU FOLLOW HER? YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE CHASED HER! SO STUPID! WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?"

7pm to 9pm is "evening study time" in our school, everyone needs to be in the classroom to study (ugh asian schools). My seat in the back of the classroom right next to the door. Usually I just read novels or doodle, but that night I couldn't focus myself doing anything, cause I can feel that the girl who sat next to me was just staring at me. We are not allowed to talk during our evening studies so I tried to ignore her but it get to a point that I start feeling uncomfortable, so I turn and look at her, try to use my facial language to ask her to stop doing whatever she's doing, but then I realize, she was;t staring at me at all, she was staring at the door behind me. I was too afraid to ask her what did she saw so I just wave at her and trying to get her attention, but then her face started to turn white, and she made this scary face that I have never seen anyone had in my life, her entire face was squeeze together and her eyebrows were doing this / \\ shape, her eyes was filled with tears and her mouth was open and she was panting, I can see her teeth trembling.  
  
And then she started to scream. She covered her ears with her arms and she was just screaming and crying and pointing behind me. I was stoned and I was so afraid to move cause whatever she saw, I did not want to see. One of the girls who claims that she can see "supernature things" said calmly "there's someone standing at the door."  
A teacher heard the scream and came to see what happened, she had two girls to bring the screaming girl to the teachers' office to call her parents to come pick her up and she left to get help. The entire classroom went quite cause none of us are aware of what's really going on, until that girl who claims she saw someone at the door spoke again "that thing is still there it haven't left yet". And then the entire classroom went crazy, everyone was crying or screaming, many of them start praying, after a couple minutes that girl spoke again and told us that it has left. Not long after tow more teacher and our school priest came to our classroom and start praying for us, one of the teacher even gave me a cross necklace cause I was shaking. After we prayed the teachers warned us to not tell anyone else about what happened cause they wouldn't;t want the entire school to freak out, and we all went back to our room. Even till now I still thank myself for not turning to see what's behind me.

Of course once we went back to our room we told the other class about this. Funny story, I remember that night I was so afraid to sleep I asked a friend who's in the same dorm with me to not go to bed until I fell asleep, snd she agreed. But I was so afraid that night I hide myself in the blanket. Suddenly I  heard sth next to my bed, I peeped form my blanket and saw someone staring at me right next to my bed, I screamed "GHOSTED AHHHH" and throw my pillow at it, but turns out that was my friend who was really tired and just came to check whether I was asleep so she can go to sleep too. I still apologize to her about this every year on her birthday.

This might be the end of the story but except another small thing happened a few days after that, I was at the wind Orchestra practice and I was telling one of the girl who plays the flute about what happened at our classroom the other day (note that I did not tell her about the girl I saw cause I still believe there could be an explanation). She immediately tell me that she also had the ability to see "supernature things" and she has been noticing something "not human" has been standing in front of the gate of our school for a while.   
"What does it look like?? Is it monster-like or a dark shadow?" I asked  
"It's just a little girl in blue dress with really long hair"

So that's it, nothing extremely scary but was my only supernature experience. I had heard or seen other girls in my school had those too but I'll probably share next time. 

I remember my grandma used to say that every girl will have at least one supernature experience before 15, and asian culture had this thing that I always heard the elders believe that females have a more "yin" constitution and are more easy to attract supernatural things. 

As an atheists I still try to believe there is an explanation for what I experience, but till now I did not know how to explain what happened, I'd be glad if anyone could share their guesses.
