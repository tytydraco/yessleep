The dust is still settling when I make the decision.

Jim's unconscious in the back of an SUV, his hand blackened and necrotic where he crushed the stone. The tactical team is securing the perimeter. Joseph's on the satellite phone coordinating containment—helicopters, heavy equipment, imaging drones. I hear him say "thirty minutes" and "full lockdown" and I understand with cold clarity what comes next.

Quarantine. Documentation. Then we disappear. Structural casualties. Acceptable losses. Line items in a report that gets filed and forgotten.

Leo's beside me, coughing into his fist.

When he opens it, there's black phlegm flecked with those blue threads. He sees me looking.

"I'm not waiting for them to box us up." Voice raw but defiant. The kind of defiance that comes from having nothing left to lose except the pretense of choice.

I should argue. Should tell him we're already boxed, already inventoried, already filed under "acceptable losses."

But I'm looking past him. At the rubble.

The collapse exposed something. Where the shaft's edge crumbled away, there's an opening. Not new excavation. Old. Ancient, maybe. Timber supports rotted black but still vertical, still load-bearing after decades of waiting. Rusted narrow-gauge rails disappearing down into darkness like a tongue retracting into a throat.

Warm when it should be cold. Humid when it should be dry. Metallic, like blood, like copper wiring, like the taste in my mouth when I cough.

A guard paces the perimeter, eyes locked on Joseph’s barked orders, radio pressed to his ear. He never turns as we duck behind the supply crates and slide into the dark mouth.

Into the tunnel.

Down.

___

The walls change as we descend. Sheer cut stone gives way to something messier—crushed rock mixed with rusted metal shards, compacted coal dust, all of it pressed together until the seams blur. I can't tell where one material ends and another begins.

The floor is narrow-gauge rails, slick with black oil that never seems to dry. The air gets thicker the deeper we go, warm and wet, smelling like rock and rust and something organic I don't want to name.

We find things along the way.

A boot with the leather gone hard around foot bones, the whole thing fused to the rail like it grew there. A lunch pail from the 1940s, rusted shut—when Leo kicks it, something inside thuds with a weight that tells me it's not food anymore. Something denser. Heavier.

There's stenciling on the wall: "SHAFT 7 - DEPTH 220m - YEAR 1953"

Scratched beneath it in different handwriting: "GOD IS A MINERAL"

We keep going because the tunnel only goes one direction. Down into the mountain's gut, following rails that haven't seen a cart in seventy years, breathing air that tastes like the inside of someone else's mouth.

The walls keep changing.

Scratched beneath it in different handwriting, frantic and deep: *GOD IS A MINERAL*

"We should go back," Leo whispers.

"Where?" I ask. "Up there where Joseph's waiting? Where they'll process us?"

He doesn't answer. We keep descending.

The tunnel only goes down.

Two hundred feet. Maybe more. Hard to tell. Time gets elastic in the dark, measured only by the rhythm of our footsteps and Leo's worsening cough.

The chamber is vast. Cathedral-vast, but wrong. The walls aren't stone anymore—they're something alive. Blue stone with veins that glow cold and phosphorescent, bright enough that our flashlights are useless. The hum we've been hearing for months is deafening down here. It vibrates in our teeth, in our bones, in the base of our skulls where thoughts turn into static.

But it's not empty.

There are bodies everywhere. They're arranged along the walls at regular intervals, embedded in the stone at chest height like specimens in a museum display. Not skeletons—these men are still whole. Their flesh has turned to grey stone, every detail preserved perfectly. Wrinkles. Calluses. The dirt under their fingernails.

They're posed in the middle of work. Swinging pickaxes that have fused into their hands. Holding surveyor rods that pierce straight through their palms. Bent double, catching breath they'll never finish taking.

Their mouths are frozen open in silent shouts.

Their eye sockets are filled with glowing blue crystal.

___

Leo stops walking. His breath comes in short, sharp gasps that fog in the cold light. "Oh my god," he whispers. "They're all still here."

I start counting. Twelve bodies along the near wall. Twenty when I turn my head. Then I stop because I realize they go all the way around the chamber, spiraling up into the darkness above where even the blue glow can't reach. Dozens. Maybe hundreds.

This ain't a graveyard. It's a fucking trophy case. Mountain's showing off its collection like 'look what I made with these useless meatbags. They turned people into fucking building materials.

"Oh my god." Leo's voice cracks. He's staring at a face embedded in the wall near us. "That's John. From the second week. And that's—wait, I recognize that one from the first month. And him. They're all here. Everyone who ever worked this mountain, they're all—"

"Keep moving," I cut him off, because if we stop to process what we're seeing we'll never start again.

The center of the chamber rises into a platform where the blue stone grows thicker, denser, where the light pulses with something like a heartbeat. Something that makes my own pulse try to sync with it.

Someone's sitting there.

Not embedded like the others. Not turned to stone. Just sitting, back against the central column, legs stretched out.

Alive.

"Plato."

He's changed since I last saw him. From the waist down, he's fused with the stone. His legs, his hips, all of it merged with the black stones growing out of him. His clothes are still intact, still recognizable as the Carhartt work pants and thermal shirt he wore topside, but they're becoming part of the stone too. The fabric blurs into the stone. 

But his eyes are open. Tracking us. Aware.

Leo's looking past Plato now, back at the bodies in the walls. "The God Stones," he says, his voice shaking. "They're growing out of them. All of them. Look."

He's right. Each embedded worker has stones jutting from their backs, their shoulders, their spines. Black obsidian, the same stones we've been hauling up for months. Growing from human bodies like fruit from a tree.

"Quiet, Leo." My voice comes out harder than I intended. "Let me think."

But thinking is difficult because Plato's still watching us, and his mouth is moving now, forming words.

"Took you long enough." His voice is calm. Conversational. The voice of a foreman reviewing timecards. "Shift started an hour ago. I was beginning to think you'd called in sick."

"We're getting you out."

He laughs. Not cruel. Genuinely amused. "Out? I am out, Thomas. I'm further out than I've ever been. This is the pension plan. The ultimate union job. You don't retire, man. You get promoted to infrastructure. Full benefits package - permanent employment, zero turnover, maximum efficiency. Ultimate job security."

Leo's backing away, hand over his mouth, eyes wide. I step closer.

"Plato, this isn't you. This is—"

"Contamination?" He smiles. That serene, empty smile. "Integration. There's a difference. The mountain's not evil, man. It's optimized. Zero waste, maximum utilization. It's been running this algorithm for millions of years. We're just the latest iteration."

His hand, still flesh, gestures at the crystallized workers on the walls. "They're not dead. The mountain thinks through them. Calculates. Plans. Dreams, in its way. And it's beautiful, Thomas. It's the most perfect system I've ever seen. No waste. No inefficiency. No one is useless."

"They want you." Plato's eyes lock onto mine. "Your clarity. Your contamination. You'd be a foreman down here. A coordinator. Never useless. Never afraid. Never broke and desperate and wondering if you matter." He looks at Leo. "Your friend could be stabilized. His sickness cured. He could be safe. Protected. Part of something eternal."

The offer hangs in the air between us, thick and humid and impossible to ignore.

Purpose. Safety. A place to belong. All the shit I've been starving for since I first climbed into that van. The stuff that makes you get out of bed when you're broke and broken and don't know why the fuck you bother.

Leo's looking at me with eyes that are too wide, too desperate. He's terrified and dying and waiting for me to make the choice that determines whether we both walk out of here or whether we become exhibits in this museum of labor.

The math was fucking perfect. Join up and Leo gets saved. Say no and we both die down here. Two plus two equals 'eat shit and take the deal.' No third option. Never was.

I look at Plato. He's peaceful, fully integrated, safe in a way I've never been safe in my entire life. But he's also empty. Whatever made him Plato, the calm reason, the hippie wisdom, the man who tried to warn me. It's gone. He's a node now. A component. Essential but interchangeable.

Then I look at Leo. Terrified, coughing blood into his fist, shaking with fever and fear. Still human. Still capable of being hurt. Still capable of making choices, even stupid ones, even desperate ones.

Still himself.

"Fuck your promotion."

Plato's expression doesn't change. "Thomas—"

"You're not essential, man. You're a fucking fossil. A tool they left in the box too long. And I'd rather be a dead man than a living wrench in your twisted toolbox."

His face shifts, but not into anger. Into disappointment. The kind of disappointment a manager shows when an employee fails their performance review, when they've demonstrated they're not a good cultural fit, when it's time to discuss other opportunities.

"Then you're a liability," Plato says. His voice stays calm. Reasonable. "The system purges liabilities."

The chamber reacts before I can. The hum rises to a scream that makes my teeth ache. The blue veins in the walls pulse brighter, faster. The stone around us shifts, and I realize with sick clarity that it's not just stone—it's alive, it's aware, and it's responding to Plato's assessment like a body's immune system identifying a threat.

The walls begin to close.

Not quickly. Deliberately. The stone growing inward with the patience of something that's been doing this for decades, that knows we can't outrun it, that has all the time in the world because it is the world down here.

Plato's still watching us with those empty eyes. "He could have saved you, Leo," he says conversationally, like he's explaining a minor policy change. "Now you'll both feed the roots. The mountain's hungry. It's always been hungry. And you—" his gaze slides to me "—you taste like potential wasted."

I don't think. My hand finds a rock on the ground, heavy and jagged, probably fell from the tunnel ceiling during our descent. I swing it at the nearest crystal node jutting from the wall, a fist-sized cluster that pulses brighter than the rest, that seems to be coordinating the constriction.

It shatters. Not like glass breaking. Like bone cracking. The sound is wet and wrong.

The chamber shudders. The constriction stops mid-motion, the stone branches freezing in place as the whole structure flinches like I just hit a nerve. Like I hurt it.

"Run!"

___

We scramble up the tunnel. Behind us, a sound like tectonic plates grinding, like the mountain realizing it's been injured and deciding whether to pursue or heal. Leo's ahead of me, moving on pure adrenaline despite his failing lungs. 

The tunnel seems longer going up. Steeper. The rails slick under our boots. Leo slips, catches himself, keeps climbing.

Behind us, something cracks. A support beam giving way. Rocks tumbling. The chamber collapsing or compacting or doing whatever mineral consciousness does when part of it dies.

We erupt into evening air. The sun is setting. The first Company helicopter is landing, rotors whipping dust into spiral patterns that look almost intentional.

Leo collapses. Coughing. Hacking. Black fluid pouring from his mouth onto the dirt. But his chest is moving. His eyes are open. Alive.

Tactical team is on us immediately. Hands grabbing. Voices shouting. Someone pressing me to the ground, checking for weapons, for stones, for anything that might make me a threat.

Joseph walks over. Looks down at me. His expression is something that might be vindication or might be pity.

"I told you," he says quietly. Just for me. "You can't terminate your employment, Thomas. The work has been fully integrated into your operational parameters. It's part of your biological architecture now. Part of your core competencies."

They load Leo onto a stretcher. His eyes are open but he's not seeing me, not seeing the camp, not even seeing the sky he's staring at. He's looking through it all to something beyond, something I can't follow him to. The sickness is permanent now. The contamination has rewritten something fundamental in him. I got him out of the Garden, dragged him back up that tunnel and into the air, but I didn't save him. Not really.

The others didn't make it out at all.

Two helicopters idle on the cleared ground, rotors still turning, blades cutting the dusk light into red and gold ribbons. Between them, hazmat-suited figures stack body bags like they're loading freight. Black zippered bags, each one the exact length and width of a man. No names visible. No tags. Just inventory being processed and logged for transport.

I watch the tactical team seal the tunnel entrance. Industrial foam pumped into the opening, then metal plates bolted over that, then warning signs screwed into the rock face. Hazardous materials. Unstable ground. Do not enter. Like that will stop anything. Like the mountain cares about OSHA regulations.

The Garden is still down there. Still growing. Plato's still sitting on his crystal throne, waiting for the next crew to descend, for the next shift to clock in.

Joseph's twenty feet away, back turned, phone pressed to his ear. I can hear fragments of his conversation. Words like "asset transfer" and "specialized observation facility" and "long-term contamination study." He's already moving pieces on the board, planning the next site, the next operation.

The shift never ends. You just get reassigned.

I don't understand why they're leaving me. Everyone else is being loaded onto the helicopter, the living onto one, the dead onto the other. But I'm still standing here in the dirt with my tent and my gear and nobody's called my name. Maybe they think I'm already dead, already processed, already part of the mountain's inventory. Maybe leaving me here is the cleanup protocol for contaminated assets who are too aware, too much of a liability to transfer.

The site empties. The helicopters lift off, their downdraft kicking up dust and ash that coats my tongue. I watch their lights disappear over the ridge.

The camp is silent now except for the generator's hum and the wind through the pines and the distant, persistent sound of the mountain breathing through the sealed tunnel. They left supplies. MREs stacked in the mess tent. Water jugs. A working Starlink terminal sitting on the table like they knew I'd need to send a message eventually, like they're waiting for me to call for extraction when I'm ready to accept the terms.

I find it in my tent, tucked into my sleeping bag where I'd left Plato's notebook months ago. A single torn page, his handwriting still recognizable even though it's shakier now, the letters formed by a hand that was already half-stone.

The poem is written in careful script:

*And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark*  
 *They think they have done me no injury:*  
 *And are gone to praise God & his Priest & King*  
 *Who make up a heaven of our misery.*

I read it three times before I understand.

They didn't leave me here to die. They left me here to make a fucking choice. Call for extraction and accept whatever 'specialized facility' means, or stay and join Plato's twisted stone collection. The Garden's still hiring. Always hiring. And I'm apparently the only applicant who didn't get the memo that this is a lifetime gig. 

I fold the poem, tuck it into my pocket, and stare at my cracked phone. 

Thumb hovers.

The worst part isn’t the fear, it’s the relief that someone still wants me, even if they shoot horses.
