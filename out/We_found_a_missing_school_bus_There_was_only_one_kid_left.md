This is creepy as hell. 

That was my first thought as I look aroumd the school bus. It's all banged and scratched up with claw marks all around it. Windows shattered and you can see a few hints of blood. 

I am a journalist that works for the local paper. When we caught word that the missing school feild trip bus has been found they immediately sent me to take a few pictures and cover the story. 

But looking at this bus it looked like it has gone through hell and back.

As the cops got done looking inside they allowed me in. One of the cops Officer [Redacted] told me that everything found inside will be kept confidental. 

I was confused as to why since I am a journalist. There's also that old saying," curiosity killed the cat".  

I walked into the bus, immediately starting to feel a strong feeling of dread and fear. There was a cop talking to a little boy of around 12/13. The boy looked scared out of his mind. 

"So your telling me you don't have any idea on what happened to your classmates?" The officer asked him. 

"N..no I don't sir. The, the only thing I kept hearing were the screams. The screams oh man I knew who the screams belonged too except that thing". 

"Thing?" The officer said confused. Are you sure it wasn't just your bus driver doing it since he's also missing. 

The little boy shook his head no vividly. "No it got him too i know because his scream was the worst". 

As I was taking pictures from inside the bus, goosebumps started going down me. Obviously something happened in here that made the kid traumatized. 

As I was taking a picture of a small blood splatter on the window my eye caught something. A piece of notebook paper folded between the edges of the seats. Here's what it said after I took it out of the seat. 

I…I don't know what's going on. It took Mr. Charles first. We we're all driving to the feild trip to the zoo. Suddenly a loud scream from Mr.Charles seat up front made us all jump and yell. Then we saw a big splotch of blood all over the front windows. 
Then the bus skidded on the road till it crashed into the tree. Some of the kids are hurt. Mrs. Laramie and Mr. Hopkins are helping us as best as they could. 

So was the kids story true? I thought as i his the note in my pocket while avoiding suspicion. I went over To the next couple of seats and saw another folded up piece if paper. This one had blood on it which made it hard for me to open it and trying not to gag. 

We're we're all scared ok. That thing it got Sarah and Tommy. They were both crying and sitting by the windows when suddenly long elongated white hands came out from the window and grab their heads and… and I can't describe it. It was all too sick. 

That one made me chill down to the bone. As I was taking more pictures the cop came up to me. 

"We're going to take this kid outside. If you see anything make sure to yell for us". 

I nodded. Trying to keep my composure. The cop then shakes his head at me and calmly leads the boy outside. The sounds of an ambulance approaching makes this all sound like a bad nightmare. 

It didn't take me long to find another note. 

Mrs. Laramie is now in shock. That's what Mr. Hopkins called her. She is just sitting in a ball and rocking back and forth. I'm scared of that thing and I just want to go home. 

All of these notes were in different handwriting. The next onw that i found was in the exact same one as the first. 

I'm trying to comfort my friend Jake. He's all messed up. Saying that if we All looked at the windows that we all would be saved. Mr. Hopkins is, gone now, he tried to to out the bus doors and get some help. 
As soon as he got to the doors the arms came back again. We all looked away as we hear his screams. Once they were over we looked back and screamed in shock and fear. 
Mr. Hopkins laid on the floor looking like a broken pencil. 

I held my mouth as I felt like coming up. I looked back at the front doors. The only thing i saw was a big blood puddle. 

As i got to the end of the bus I found a final note. 

If anyone see's this note just tell my parents that i love them. There's only 5 of us left. Marcus can't see so we hope him the best. We're gonna look in the windows. 2 of us on each side holding hands. Maybe we all doing this will let Marcus live. 
See you on the other side, 
John. 

Tears we're going down my face as I put the final note in the other pocket. As I got out of the bus there was a whole bunch of commotion going on. I saw the cop from before and went up to him. 

"Hey, what's going on?" I ask my lips shuddering. 

He looked back at me with a scared expression. "One of the EMT's went to check on the kid. As he went to check on him long elongated hands with claws came out from the right back window and just… squished his head!" 

"The kid then fell in shock. We took him in a police cruiser and raced to the hospital. How did you not hear all of that?!" 

What he said left me speechless. I quickly got in my car and left. I don't know what type of creature this is. Maybe you all can help? There's got to be a perfect explanation for what happened in that school bus.
