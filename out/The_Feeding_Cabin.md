I despise the city, it’s always been a place that holds no good memories for me, from my troubled family to my stressfully overwhelming studies, never getting me not even a speck of self-fulfillment I was promised of back in my childhood, so the moment my father, apathetically I may add, mentioned my weird uncle had passed away inside his far away cabin, which now needed a new temporary owner, it felt like a blessing in my crumbling life. 

After some very slow talks and arrangements, I packed my bags, climbed in my old car and set forth to the small town of Pelthwith, where the cabin was located. The path was uneventful, and the view was quite a good change of pace compared to the usual homeless guy or the endless buildings covering up the blue sky that has been robbed from us. I arrived a little over 6 PM, barely making it before sunset, being winter and all, so I climbed down from my parked car in front of the old wooden cabin in the middle of a small hill around the outskirts of the town.

 It was an oddly cozy looking shack, built with strong mossy logs and walls covered in mud to protect against the cold, for which I’m grateful, considering I had to be in almost a half meter of snow.

 So I grabbed my traveling bag and headed towards the door illuminated by the dimly lit sky, not being able to see the sun anymore as I stepped on the wooden porch and looked for the key my father had given me, and unsurprisingly, the door unlocked with a satisfying click. The inside of the cabin consisted of four small rooms. 

The main hall, a bedroom with a queen size bed, a bathroom and the kitchen. It was freezing so I set down my bags, locked the door and quickly got a couple of logs to light the fireplace to life, feeling much better about everything the moment I felt the welcoming heat and the firm softness of the sofa in front of it, which immediately made me quite drowsy, so I closed my eyes for a brief second before opening them up again, trying to not fall asleep. 

After taking a short breath, I got up and headed to the bedroom with my bags, and started unpacking everything for tomorrow, but that’s when I noticed some specific details about this room, for starters, the window aiming at the woods had no blinds, and the big wardrobe in front of the bed had little animal bones inside it, which isn’t exactly odd considering my uncle was apparently an avid hunt. Not giving it much of a second thought, I got changed and headed to bed, promptly falling asleep right after. I kept having weird dreams related to my family and the cabin, as well as waking up a few times thanks to slight noises outside the window, though I associated everything with animals and understandable stress. 

The next morning I woke up, got changed and cooked myself some breakfast and a cup of coffee as I headed out for the day, noticing the snow had not melted at all since it was still freezing outside, making me look like a headless city girl covered in coat over coat, boots not exactly built for snow and a soft scarf, which made me scoff at myself before getting in my car again and heading to the main town, looking to get in touch with the place and do some much necessary shopping. 

All of this took roughly 4 hours as I was constantly stopped by people that supposedly knew my uncle, mentioning how unfriendly and isolated he was, something that seems all too familiar to me as I’ve heard the same words coming from my father countless times. I thanked them for their welcoming words and warnings about living in the woods before finally getting back “home”.

 I sighed the moment I stepped inside the cabin, setting down the groceries and lighting up the fireplace once again, sitting down on the sofa to read a book when I suddenly noticed something curious. There were small scratch marks around the wooden floor heading towards the kitchen from the bedroom and back there again. Furthermore, I decided to check it out, slightly alarmed thinking some small animal had crawled inside, and my suspicions grew as I noticed those claw marks all over the wardrobe, with the small bones having been moved slightly. That creeped me out, but I decided to not worry about it for now, choosing to believe a hungry animal had gotten in, looked for food, found nothing and crawled back out, and looking back, I was nothing more than a gullible idiot.

 The rest of the day was uneventful, and I went to bed having completely forgotten about the afternoon. That night I kept hearing noises and more scratching, which didn’t let me sleep at all, so I got up and headed for the dark window, looking back at the endless abyss of the woods beyond, finding nothing but some more claw marks on the glass, easily visible due to the cold. That’s when I felt this was more than just a lost animal as I listened to the front door being knocked slightly, only for moments later to be aggressively hit over and over with a loud blunt thump. 

At that moment, I decided to lock the bedroom door and hide in a corner, holding my breath as I heard the front door swinging open alongside the sound of shattering wood, fearing it’d be a bear or another wild beast I had never dreamed of ever seeing outside a zoo. Then loud steps that entered the cabin sounded…almost intelligent yet too irrational and heavy to be a human as my confusion grew from hearing deep gnarly growls. I thought my heart had stopped as I kept holding my breath close to passing out, not being able to handle the agonizing silence that followed the loud entrance of this…thing, only for it to suddenly scratch my bedroom door, which made me yelp, yet I’d have never been ready for what I heard right after in a deep voice… 

\-Food… Food…! Promise, it’s time, where food?! Arthur! 

 As I heard the deep, inhuman yelling, I couldn’t help but hide under the bed, crying and trembling as I tried my best to stay silent. That’s when my racing thoughts came to a halt the moment I heard the door swing open with more wood shattering just as the front entrance had. 

 The creature entered the room, violently demanding for food and scratching everything with his giant furry-looking claws that I caught a glimpse of under the bed. The beast opened the wardrobe and sniffed inside, before madly knocking it over following with a deafening roar that made my beating heart jump more and more, thinking I was going to pass out, when suddenly the thing stopped, turned around and exited the room with heavy steps that grew farther and farther, hearing them reach the front door, then the porch, until everything went back to normal, a dead silence that seemed all too comforting now, yet deadly.

 I don’t remember much after, just the faint noise of cold wind and my fading consciousness, probably causing me to pass out until the morning. I woke up alarmed and scared, feeling like it must’ve been a dream if it weren’t for the fact that I could see the broken pieces of wood scattered all over the floor as I got out from below the bed. The room was a mess of scraping and the knocked over wardrobe, while the rest of the cabin was more of the same, looking like a tornado had passed the area, but it was no tornado. 

 A beast that could talk, demanding food from my deceased uncle, which filled my mind with hundreds of implications as to why he’d be feeding that thing…or what. 

Following the next hour, I didn’t bother to grab anything but my bags as I got changed hastily, climbed on my car and started the path towards the city yet again, leaving that damned cabin and woods behind. 

I didn’t tell my father the truth of what happened back there, fearing he’d lock me up in a madhouse, so I made up an excuse about some bear bursting in the cabin during the night, which earned me a dubious look from him but nothing more. I am now living in a small apartment in the middle of the city, with a crumbling life that I now have come to appreciate all too well.

 I never found out what that creature was, but I sure as hell don’t want to ever see it again, or that cabin…or whatever my uncle was doing back there, and now that I think about it, those bones looked small yet oddly…human, too human.
