Part 1 

THE RETURN

The rain is pouring down hard creating small thumping sounds as it hits my windshield; my wiper blades trying to keep up at the speed of the rain as the sky cries out in pain. All of the sudden that bone chilling sound of a low rattle comes over the radio. My heart stops; as I’m sure everyone’s hearts stop in that same moment as the sound bellows throughout the region over all the radios, tv’s, and even the advertisement screens on the city skyscrapers. The sound stops and there’s a few moments of deafening silence until an automative voice starts listing off names mechanically. “Elizabeth Johnson, Miranda Stiller, Carl Gramble, ...” The names keep coming in uniform fashion as if it’s a never-ending receipt. Except it’s a return receipt of your life. “Angela Lawrence”. Now my breathing has stopped. They said MY NAME! NO! NO! NO! I must have heard that wrong! There’s no way that was right, is it? The names keep listing off until it stops. There’s a moment of silence as I am still holding my breath. The automated voice states “The names listed are listed at www.lifereturn.gov Please note that the names listed have only 24 hours left to live. May God be with your souls.” The announcement ends and music begins to play like tragic news hadn’t just been announced for 35 people! I immediately pull my car over and go to the government website hoping and saying a quick prayer to a God I don’t even believe in that my name wasn’t called out today. The website loads and I scroll the list of names and see very clearly “Angela Lawrence-Shoreline Region”. That’s me. Or was me 24 hours from now I won’t be ME anymore.  The website shows a large analog clock stating in bold red letters that I have only 23 Hours and 42 Minutes left of my life...

I push my front door  open stepping inside a house that no longer feels like a home. Patches my rescued tabby is lounging on the sofa and ignores my exhausted entrance. I go to pet him and he immediately jumps into my lap and rubs all over me while tears begin to fall down onto his soft fur. “Patches...I...I won’t be here to take care of you anymore. You’re going to have to go live with my sister...” Patches purrs as if he understands. I finally dry my tears and reach to grab my phone with shaking hands. As I am looking at the screen of a dozen missed calls another call comes through. “Yeah....” I answer my sister’s call bleakly. “Angela....was it really your name they announced today during The Return?” My sister Amber asks in complete disbelief. “I’m coming over” She answers my dead silence. 

My sister walks into the living room and she’s so stunning. Normally you can tell we are sister’s because we have the same smile but today her face shows only glooom and dread. I can tell she’s breaking on the inside; just as I am. We check the time: 22 Hours and 56 Minutes. Until I have to return my life.
