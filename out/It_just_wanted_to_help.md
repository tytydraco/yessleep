It started with laughter. That stupid, unfiltered kind that only happens around people who knew you before the world made you small. Do things like this always start that way? Maybe they do, maybe the universe knows what's going to happen and i gives us a single kindness. A memory, a good memory, before everything and everyone that made that memory so, so good is ripped away. Maybe it doesn't understand kindness like we do. Maybe nothing really does.



The fire was crackling, hot and high, spitting sparks up towards the night sky. Lightning bugs danced and flickered through the trees above. Jules, of course it had been Jules, had decided that was the perfect time to tell everyone why they lit up, "You know," He called over to Marcy, who'd been rhapsodizing about how beautiful they were, "All they're doing is yelling 'Want some fuck?' at anything that can see them. Like, mostly other lightning bugs, but I reckon some of them might be open to new things."



Marcy, having lost her last fuck to give somewhere earlier in the evening, reached out to smack him in the shoulder with a marshmallow stick - sans marshmallow, drawing an exaggerated yelp from Jules in the process.



“Jesus, dude, shut up! Let me have this!” she snapped, she was laughing as she spoke though, an open full bellied sort of thing, the kind of laugh she usually tried to hide. Never around us though, not us. 



Nico, possibly taking Jules words as gospel on the matters of lightning bugs...or maybe just very, very drunk by that point, chimed in, "No, no, he's right Marcy. Like, everything in nature wants to fuck. Birds chirping? Time for some fuck? Fish...uh, fishing. It is the fuck. All the fuck." He continued nodding even after he'd finished adding in his words of wisdom, only stopping when he nearly fell out of seat trying to find some wood to toss on the fire, and came up empty, "Fuck."



Connor snorted as he watched the two of them, rolling his eyes as he stood up from his log, "You people need Jesus, or something. And to sober the fuck up, goddam." He suggested as he eyed the tree line, "I'm gonna grab some wood, you all...try not to flirt with the wildlife I guess, Jesus Christ." With that parting remark, he grabbed a flashlight from the haphazardly piled equipment and headed off into the forest.



"That better not be weird boy scout slang for jerking it! Grab some actual wood!" Jules shouted after him, raising his beer in a mock salute. 



Connor raised a hand, giving Jules a middle fingered salute, before disappearing into the dark armed with the flashlight and a small hatchet.



I leaned back against my own log, idly scootching my feet closer to the fire in an attempt to warm them. Anna sat next to me, her arms tucked into the pockets of her hoodie, watching tendrils of smoke drift up and slowly away.



"Feels almost weird." she said quietly, eyes still watching the trails of smoke.



I glanced at her. "What, the camping? The, uh, \*fascination\* with the mating habits of insects?"



"And birds!" Nico called out, earning grin from me and a little nod.



"And birds." I dutifully repeated.



Anna grinned at that. "No, I dunno, just, we're all here. Together. It's nice."



"Yeah, yeah it is." I agreed, before leaning over to gently bump my shoulder against hers, "And look at us, together we're at least two fully functional adults."



A laugh burst out of her at that, her eyes wide as she grinned, like she hadn't expected to laugh and delighted by it.



Across the fire Jules was valiantly fighting to put his marshmallow out, shaking his stick around until the marshmallow came off, launching the sticky missile directly into the fire. As he stared mournfully at the cremated remains of his marshmallow I looked back to Anna, "Maybe one and half." 



Marcy tossed a pinecone at his head and missed, despite being less than three feet away from him. Nico was lost in his sketchbook, oblivious to everything around him.



Beside me, Anna's shoulders were shaking with silent laughter. When she finally looked back to me, I knew in that moment that the all the planning and frustrations to make this trip possible had been worth it, she looked happier than I'd seen her in a while, "I think I missed this."



I smiled at her, "Yeah, I did too."



We were quiet then, Anna and I, just soaking up the heat of the fire, and listening to Marcy and Jules increasingly heated argument about Bigfoot. I wasn't paying too much attention, content to just listen to them, and lean against Anna. 



As we all sat gather around the fire, something off in the woods snapped. A sharp, cracking sound that had all of us, even Nico, looking up to peer into the darkness. When no other sound came, I slowly rose from my seat, "Connor?" I called out. I didn't see any signs of a flashlight, but maybe he broke it. Maybe he was trying to find us, following the light of our campfire and stumbling blind in the woods.



That... it didn't sound at all like something Connor would do, but it was dawning on me by then that he'd been gone a while. Longer than he should have been, it felt like.



When no one replied, I frowned before calling out again, "Hey, Connor!"



Again, silence...complete silence I realized, no crickets were chirping, no bugs were buzzing. There was just the unnatural silence., until from just beyond the tree line, a low, grumbling sound began. It was a peculiar sort of noise, it reminded me of someone muttering under their breath - no words actually heard, just a voice low and hoarse.



At first, we all just stared out into the woods, none of us wanting to be the first to say anything.



"He's probably just messing with us." Jules said, but it was easy to see he didn't believe that anymore than I did. Connor wasn't like that, never had been.



A tense moment passed before I tried again, hesitantly calling out his name, "Connor?"



There was still no answer, nothing beyond the grumbling that had begun to fade, like whoever was making the noise was walking back deeper into the woods.



Anna reached out then, wrapping ice cold fingers around my wrist as she looked up at me, "David...David, I don't like this." She said quietly, as if afraid to be overheard. I pulled her closer in response, tucking her against my side as I continued to stare out into the woods, trying in vain to see through the darkness that shrouded the trees.



"It's okay. Connor, he probably just got lost." I didn't believe that for an instant, but it was instinct to comfort my little sister even in the face of my own anxiety.



"Should we try to find him? What if he's hurt?" Nico asked, long since having put his sketchbook aside as he too stared into the woods.



I'm ashamed to admit it, I am, but every part of me wanted to say 'No'. Connor could handle himself. Boy scout turned park ranger - he was built for this shit. He could absolutely take care of himself out there. 



Before I could say something I'd regret, probably even hate myself for, Marcy spoke up in my stead, "Of course we should! You all know this isn't like him, he treats this camping shit seriously." Came her firm reply as she rose from her own log and snatched up the spare flashlight before looking to me, then Jules, "You two come with me, Nico can stay here with Anna."



I hated, \*hated\*, the idea of leaving Anna behind. I trusted Nico, of course I did, but she was my baby sister and Nico was...Nico, he was like the annoying baby brother I'd never had, or known I wanted. I knew it wasn't fair, but in my eyes neither of them were up to the task of looking after the other. 



Still, I couldn't abandon Connor. He was one of my best friends, and Anna would never forgive me, especially if something had happened.



"Goddam it, yeah. If we find him and he's just jerking it to the sounds of nature though, I'm gonna be fucking pissed. The man better have a broken leg." I groused, flinching away when Anna reached up to smack the back of my head.



"That's not funny, David!" She hissed out, offended on Connor's behalf.



"I mean, it's a little funny." Jules contributed, before raising his hands up and stepping back when Anna turned her glare on him.



Anna looked back to me then, the glare softening into something more fond, more worried, "Please, \*please\* be careful, okay? I just...something feels wrong." As she spoke Anna turned her gaze back to the woods, wrapping her arms around herself before stepping closer to the fire.



"Nico and me will be fine here, just find Connor and be careful about it." I wanted to be annoyed with how much she was hammering home the need to be careful out in the woods. It was night, and the woods would be all the darker for how dense they were, and how little moonlight would get through. But I understood her worry, too. We were all each other had left in terms of family, and I'd likely be doing the same to her if our roles were reversed.



"I promise, Banana," I said, intentionally using the childhood nickname to irritate her - irritation was far better than the growing worry that had been building up in her, "We won't be gone long, and we'll be careful."



Marcy and Jules nodded their agreement, before Marcy flicked on the flashlight, carving a path of light into the tree line as the three of us made our way towards it. We paused, just for a moment, as Marcy slowly shifted the beam of light back and forth, illuminating bushes and grass - and showing not a hint of where Connor might have gone to - before we headed into the woods.



We couldn't have been more than ten minutes into our search when Marcy let out a wordless yell, and immediately bounded forward, leaving Jules and I to chase after her, while calling out, "Marcy, Mars! Hold up! Slow down, man!" Jules yelled as we chased after her, the pair of us tripping over more than one root in the process.



I was wheezing like I'd just run a marathon when we finally caught up to her, Jules, on the other hand, sounded like he was actively dying as he gasped out, "What...and I cannot stress this...enough...the fuck was that?" at Marcy, sounding equal parts baffled and annoyed as he stared at her.



For her part, Marcy didn't say anything, not right away at least, instead she just raised the flashlight beam and pointed at the tree she was standing in front of. The steel glinting as the beam revealed a hatchet, the one that Connor had brought with him, wedged deeply into the tree trunk. Rivulets of grey liquid had trickled out of the hole the hatchet made, and solidified in a disturbingly wormlike form along the bark of the tree.



"What the fuck..." I muttered as I stared at the hatchet, "Is that, like, tree rot or something?" I asked as I reached out to touch the grey goop, only to have my hand smacked away by Marcy, "Don't fucking touch it, you idiot! It might be tree rot or, or...I don't know, a fungus or something, but you don't just go poking at it!" She snapped at me.



She looked ready to launch into an entire lecture - her go to form of self soothing when she was stressed - when from deeper in the woods we heard a voice calling out. Connor's voice, except...it sounded off. Something almost like static worming it's way in the undertones.



Marcy didn't seem to notice that weirdness, or maybe she just didn't care, because the second she heard it she was charging off further into the woods, leaving Jules and I to chase after her. Much like the previous time, we were tripping almost immediately over roots and branches as we fumbled our way through the dark, following the beam of light.



Unlike last time, however, no matter how fast we ran, and we were running fairly fast despite being practically blind, we couldn't catch up with her. The light from the flashlight just seemed to get farther and farther away until it simply blipped out of our line of sight. 



We slowed down then, turning and looking, trying to figure out where the hell she could have possibly gone. Jules and I were both yelling for her, calling out into the darkness, but no matter how much or how loudly we yelled, there was no response.



"Fuck...okay, okay, okay. Marcy has the flashlight so, wherever she is, she's fine. We though," At this Jules circled his hand around gesturing to the two of us, "Can't see shit in this, so we need to, I dunno, retrace our steps or something. Get back to camp, we can figure out what to do from there."



The only thing I could do at that was just nod, because what other choice did we have? Continue stumbling around in the dark, hoping we didn't fall down a hill, or stumble into a hole and break our legs? Turning back was the safest option.



"Right, yeah...so we came from...that way?" I guessed as I pointed directly behind us, and prayed to whatever god might be listening that I wasn't going to get us deeply lost. Jules just shrugged and without a word started hiking in the direction I'd pointed, leaving me to follow along behind him.



The walk back felt like it took forever, between tripping over roots, and at one point getting caught on a pile of brambles we hadn't seen in the dark, it seemed like we'd never get back to camp.



Eventually we stumbled out way into a dark clearing and saw our tents, and the remains of a campfire. No embers smoldering, not even a hint of warmth came from it, it was cold and lifeless and felt like it had been out for hours, and we hadn't been gone for any longer than an hour, maybe an hour and a half tops.



"Anna!" I called out, desperation tinting my voice as I practically screamed for my baby sister, "Anna Banana!" I tried, hoping that maybe using the annoying nickname might make her appear from nowhere to scold me. It didn't happen though, no matter how much Jules and I yelled we couldn't find either of them, not even a hint of where they might have went, or why.



"Where the fuck are they?" I blurted out as I checked the tent for the fourth time, as if this might be the time they'd finally be in there - they weren't, of course. But I was desperate, terrified. My little sister was missing, two of my best friends had gotten themselves lost in the woods, and I didn't know what to do.



"How the hell should I know?" Jules snapped at me, though he seemed to regret it almost immediately, "Sorry, man, but like. I know as much as you right now." He said as he looked around the empty camp, "Maybe...fuck, I don't know. We should look for them right? We should, for sure. But someone has to stay here, in case they come back, right?" 



I could immediately see where he was going with this, and I hated it, "Jules, what the hell? We can't just fucking split up dude!" I might have been yelling at him by the end of it, but the idea of splitting up, of either us being utterly alone right now terrified me. I hated it the thought of it, and was shaking my head vehemently at him as if through will alone I could change his mind.



When Jules decided something though, nothing short of a wrecking ball was going to get through to his stubborn ass. Normally I loved that about him, right now I kinda hated it as he slowly wore me down.



We decided - well, he decided and I eventually agreed - that I'd stay here just in case any of the others came back, and he'd go looking in case any of them were hurt. In the meantime I'd stay here, restart the campfire so they'd be able to see the light, and hope someone showed up.



I hated the plan, \*hated\* it, I need to be clear about that. I was desperate though, my friends were missing, my sister was missing, and I had no fucking clue what to do. So when Jules took charge, yeah I hated the idea, but a part of me was grateful for some hint of what to do. I think that's why it was so easy for him to convince me.



I watched his shadowed form head towards the treeline until I couldn't see even that anymore, then went to work on the campfire. It took some doing, my hands were shaking and the harder I tried to steady them the more they trembled, but eventually I got decent fire going.



After that all I could really do was hurry up and wait. I took a seat in front of the fire, and kept my eyes trained in direction Jules had left. I had no way of knowing where anyone might be coming from, but it seemed like the best choice. I was so focused on keeping watch that I didn't stop to think that might come from behind me until I heard the snapping of twigs being crushed beneath foot, and whipped around to see Anna. She was okay, she was here and she was okay.



"Anna, oh my fucking god, oh thank fucking god!" I gasped out, suddenly feeling breathless as I pushed myself up, tripping over my own feet and nearly faceplanting into the dirt in front of her. My own clumsiness is the reason I realized anything was wrong.



I'm a clumsy individual by nature, I've fallen down every set of stairs I've ever come across. It's a running joke between us that gravity itself is my nemesis - despite the jokes she's always rushing to help prevent me from breaking any more bones.



This time, though, she stood completely still. Standing exactly where I'd first caught sight of her and just...watching, head tilted to the side like she was confused by what she was seeing, which was impossible, because again, this had been a pattern my entire life.



I found myself staring at her right back, just looking her over for any obvious injuries at first, then just staring as I tried to figure out why she wasn't moving, "...Banana?" I eventually tried as I began to slowly edge closer to her, waiting for her to snap out of whatever was going on to yell at me. 



All she did was smile though, just smile and reach her hand out to me.



I've never been scared of my sister before, still haven't been for that matter, what I was though was intensely unnerved. Still, she was my sister and I reached out for her hand, only to stop as I something came to my attention that I'd failed to notice before. Dripping from her hands and arms were these thing...strings. Not really strings, though. Too wet. Too wrong. The more I stared, the more they pulsed - organic, like a heart beat, like nerves, not thread. They were embedded into my sisters skin at various points, and rather than dangling limply, they were drawn back like something behind her was literally pulling the strings.



"What the fuck? What the fuck, Anna?!" I yelped out as I took an unsteady step backward. It was only then, when I moved away from her, that she finally showed any sort of emotion. Confusion. She looked genuinely confused as she watched me freak out.



"Afraid. Always afraid. Why?" The first words she'd spoken since she'd turned back up, and they didn't even sound like her. It was her voice, but it was....I don't now how to describe it, layered maybe? Like she spoke, but a dozen other voices whispered with her when she did so.



"What the fuck." It was all I could think to say as I took another step back from her, then another only to trip and fall back onto my ass, leaving me staring up at my sister in horrified confusion as she finally began to move. 



As she approached me, I caught a glimpse of what was behind her, holding the strings...and I promptly vomited.



It was simultaneously grotesque, and the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. It was horrific and it was wonderful, and I couldn't tear my eyes away from it, no matter how much my mind screamed at me to, as it drew closer as well.



I can't...I don't have the words to describe it, I don't think any language on earth, even if we combined the entirety of them for the effort, would be able to. It was...it was a mass of flesh, only it wasn't. It was brilliant lights that danced, but it was a black hole that drew in any light, it was everything and nothing, and as I continued to stare at it I felt tears streaming down my cheeks. 



"Why?" Anna asked, only, now I understood it wasn't really Anna asking me that at all. It was that...thing, that creature. Could it even be described as a creature? The entity, it asked, plaintively. It sounded almost like a child in how it asked, like it couldn't comprehend my actions and was...pouting about it.



As it asked this, a face began to form in the flesh, not flesh, the side, the front, the mass of it. A familiar, dear face that had me gagging. Jules looked at me from within it, but he didn't look, couldn't see. His face, the eyes were closed, but the mouth opened and Marcy's voice came out, "What are you? What are you?" Her voice asked, flat and lifeless as it repeated the question over and over, the voice growing fainter with every repetition.



"What...what did you do to them?" I asked, somehow managing to form the words despite how my mind was screaming and my body was shaking, "Why...what did you do?"



Anna stared at me...the thing that controlled her, saw through her eyes, it stared at me, "Joined. Become. Apart, now whole." It answered, but the answer only left me with more questions.



"What?" Was my only reply, and that seemed to frustrate it as it pushed Anna forward, her legs moving almost robotically as she stepped closer until she was standing directly above me, close enough that she was able to slowly lean down and grasp hold of the hand I lifted - an attempt to shield myself that was futile at best, stupid at worst.



As she grabbed hold, I noticed her skin was cold, ice cold. And spongy and...then I didn't notice anything at all as thoughts rushed through my brain. Dragging a scream out of me as the sensation felt like a thousand white hot needles were stabbing their way through my skull. Through the pain, through the alien intrusion, I saw, and in the tiniest possible way I could understand.



It was using her to speak, what little remained of my sister, not out of malice but out of a misplaced desire to protect and preserve something it saw as lovely, and sad. It had watched us, seen how we all interacted together, it had seen the depth and breadth of love we held for each other, seen the affection twisting and twining around each of us and branching out to the next...and it saw that we were tragically separate, apart.



To this being separation, individuality was...maybe not horrifying, but wholly alien. Why be apart from what you so deeply loved? So it...it sought to correct that. To make us whole, and joined, and one - it was incapable of understanding what was lost in this process because it didn't understand the tragic beauty of individuality, it didn't understand why it's gift left each of the remnants screaming out, an unending cycle of terrified shrieks that cried out against what had been forced upon them....and now, finally, it thought to ask, and when I didn't understand what was being asked, it peeled the answers from my brain one layer at a time, leaving me screaming until I blacked out.



When I came to it was morning, and I was alone - I was still just me, and the being that had...taken my friends was gone as well. No sign, no trace, no nothing that could hint that it had ever been there.



It took me hours to hike back to our cars, and another hour on top of that to reach the nearest ranger station where I reported my friends, my sister, missing. Missing because the truth would never be believed, and I'd seem guiltier than I already did.



I was the main suspect, the only suspect, in their disappearance. Even after the campsite and surrounding woods were investigated, and offered no evidence to what happened to them, or that I could have had something to do with it. It was like they had just vanished into thin air.



I'm alone now, utterly, and completely alone. Anna is gone, my best friends are gone. The friends that remained dropped me like a hot potato even after my name was cleared. I have nothing, and no one, and I'm so, so tired of being alone. I don't know why it left, why it didn't absorb me into them. A small, insane, part of me wants to go back, to find it and beg it to take me too... a small part that gets louder every single day.
