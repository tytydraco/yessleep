“Remember, don’t open the basement door,” a familiar voice warned. A hand appeared, setting down a new stack of my favourite Manner Schnitten beside my colouring books on the wooden table. “There are monsters.”



Hearing the same old warning every day for five years was enough to make my eyes roll upward, but I wasn’t about to be rude to him.



“Jo eh, Papa,” I recited, like a cassette tape on loop, nodding my head up and down. My blue eyes shifted back to the drawing on a sheet of DIN A4 white paper, my hands carefully guiding the colouring pencils under the white glare of the red swing-arm table lamp.



“Good boy,” Papa’s kindly, Santa Claus–like voice replied, setting down a cassette tape next to my Walkman and cheerfully blurting, “Alles Liebe zum Geburtstag, Franz!”



Papa might have worried too much about the monsters, but he never forgot my special days, especially my eighth birthday. The sight of a new tape triggered a beaming “Danke schön, Papa!” from me. Happiness took over, and I gave him a bear hug before returning to colouring.

His back arched as his gaze lingered on my sketch, and his hands lightly stroked my combed blonde hair.



My hands moved the blue pencil left and right, bringing vibrancy to my sketch of a photo from the 5 June 2023 Der Standard article. It showed an Austrian Federal Police Porsche Taycan patrolling near a Porsche showroom in Vienna.



“Franz, this is a very beautiful drawing,” Papa said. “Just like them, but even better,” he added, pointing to the wall above my desk, where a handful of completed sketches watched me silently. Compared to them, my drawing of the street scene with the police car had finer details, more refined shadows, and realistic blue light rays.



The corners of my mouth curled into a smile. “They wouldn’t have been possible, Papa, without your wonderful gifts.” I glanced at the small mountain of newspapers and National Geographic magazines I had read. Papa had given them to me after discovering my intellectual abilities at five, wanting me to expand my German and English vocabulary. A few months earlier, he’d begun encouraging me to strengthen my memory and artistic skills by sketching photos from memory.



A small, cheerful laugh echoed from Papa. “You definitely like the police car,” he commented as I nodded. Over the weeks, I had drawn many pictures from memory: a ladybug, a pigeon, a ginger cat, a golden retriever, a Alpine Dachsbracke, a red deer, an elephant, a whale, a New York City taxi, a few Wiener Linien buses, and the Wiener Riesenrad.



But nothing could surpass that awesome photo of the Austrian Federal Police Porsche Taycan, complete with cool, flashing blue lights, or what Papa called sirens.



“The cake is still in the oven, so I’ll go to the kitchen to wait. As requested, it’s your favourite chocolate Mozart Torte,” Papa said, patting my back.



As the sound of his footsteps faded, leaving me alone with my drawing, his usual parting reminder cut through the air: “Remember, if you open the basement door, nothing will stop the monsters from getting you. Servus!” He waved his hand as he left.



“Servus, Papa!” I called back as I turned and waved.



Once I was alone, I slipped the cassette into my Walkman, my prized possession since my seventh birthday. Draping my headphones over my head, I closed my eyes and swayed to the melancholic, relaxing music.



My ears filled with the pleasant singing of the 1978 song Honesty by Billy Joel. It was a welcome respite after repeatedly listening to the same Mozart tape I’d received the year before.

As the final lyrics “Honesty is hardly ever heard, and mostly what I need from you” faded, I looked up and realized I’d forgotten to cross out the day’s date on the calendar. Uncapping a red marker, I drew a bold X over 6 October 2025.



Seeing that the date was only a few days before Papa’s forty-second birthday, my thoughts drifted away. I remembered his fortieth, two years ago. After the candle on his Maulwurfkuchen cake went out, he told me his wish was to grant any of mine within reason. I had taken the chance to ask, “Papa, can you tell me more about the monsters? What do they look like? And what happened to Mama?”



He paused, cupping his chin, before his voice returned, low and careful.

  
“I don’t really want to talk about what they look like,” he said. “Only that they’re ugly. You’ll know if you ever see them, but you won’t, as long as I’m around.”



A sad sigh escaped him, his eyebrows drooping. “As for Mama, well… when you were three, I accidentally left the basement door unlocked one night. The monsters came and took her.”

“You were lucky, Franz,” he continued softly. “I managed to fight them off before they could take you too. I was glad you slept through it all.”



Papa said that ever since that night, he’d become the monsters’ Boandlkramer. That was why only he could open the basement door if needed. The monsters wouldn’t dare confront their boogeyman.



“They’ll never touch me, but they’ll do anything to get to you, much like the Habergeiß,” he finished, stroking my cheek. “But you’re Papa’s Schatz, and Papa will make sure no one ever takes you.”



His arms wrapped around me as he lifted me onto his lap. When I asked what Mama was like before the monsters killed her, he smiled sadly. “She always called you Maus, because, to her, you looked like a little mouse when you were born.”



The mention of Maus stirred faint memories of Mama’s face: Her comforting smile and beautiful blue eyes, the soothing voice that still echoed in my mind. If only the monsters hadn’t taken her.



As I sat back in my chair, I decided to pause my sketch. Grabbing a colouring book, I flipped to an uncoloured page showing a street scene filled with houses. Just as my green pencil was about to land on a tree, my ears perked up. A faint shout cut through the music from my headphones. 



Puzzled, I took them off. The shouting was unmistakable.



“Papa?” I called out.



His loud cries echoed through the house.



Instinctively, I flicked the switch of the table lamp to ‘OFF’ and scampered under the wooden table. Beneath the cover of darkness, my palms pressed against my ears as the shouting grew louder. The words were too distorted to understand, but I recognized Papa’s voice.



A strange, battle-like cry erupted from him, followed by a deafening bang that silenced everything. His voice never returned.



That was when the realization hit me.



The monsters.



They weren’t afraid of Papa anymore. 



He’s gone.



Rapid footsteps thundered closer, each one heavier than the last. The monsters who had killed Mama were coming for me.



I closed my eyes and covered my ears, silently praying. The footsteps halted, and for a moment, silence hung heavy, until a violent thud shattered it. The wooden door burst open, slamming against the wall as broken bits of metal clattered to the floor with a harsh metallic clang.



They had figured out how to break in. 



My teeth chattered, and I swallowed hard, trying to force down the rising panic while the sound of trampling grew louder, closer and heavier.



The footsteps stopped in front of the desk. My eyes reopened, and I could barely see anything except the faint outlines of two legs. They were motionless. Deliberate. Waiting



I held my breath and sent a silent prayer to God.

  
Please God, don’t let them spot me. 



A reassuring silence lingered in the air for a second or two before leaving for good.



The pair of legs bent down, and I could vaguely make out the monster’s horrendous face. There was no mouth, ears, nose, or chin. Just blackness with a white plate and two green glows that passed for eyes. A faint static-like hiss came from where its mouth should have been.



After staring for a second, black, warm, leathery hands shot forward and clamped around my waist. As the monster lifted me into the darkness, I screamed and thrashed, hammering my fists against its back. My nails raked its hide, and my teeth sank forcefully into its leather-like shoulder. It didn’t even flinch.

  
“Please don’t eat me!” I cried. 



The monster carrying me darted away like a shadow slipping down an alley, followed by others exchanging strange, wordless gestures. Its black hand clamped over my eyes, plunging the world into darkness. Through a tiny gap between its fingers, I caught a glimpse that froze my blood.  


Papa lay motionless on a brown carpet, round patches of red blooming across his shirt. A pistol rested loosely in his right hand.



“Papa!” I screamed, reaching out as quiet tides of tears slipped down my face.



They were taking me to their lair to eat me, my terrified mind repeated over and over.



My body trembled like crockery in an earthquake at the thought of meeting the same fate as Mama. Then the darkness over my eyes lifted, replaced by a flood of blinding white light.



My eyes squinted, then slowly widened as fear melted into wonder.



This is what the outside world looks like?



Fences. Trees. Street lamps. Power lines. Parked cars. Colourful houses. I had seen them in my colouring books, newspapers, and magazines, but never in person.



I lifted my head toward the sun hanging in the blue sky. It was breathtaking, seeing it for the very first time.



My awe didn’t last long. The monster’s hand pushed my head down, just as my eyes began to sting.



I kept stealing glances, drinking in every detail. My ears didn’t register the strange radio chatter or the nearby, familiar tearful female voice calling, “Maus!” before it traded hurried words with a man about abduction and divorce.



When the monster noticed me staring, it covered my eyes again, as if it didn’t want me to see anymore. A small wave of disappointment washed over me.



Those flashing blue lights were really as cool as they looked in that photo from Der Standard.
