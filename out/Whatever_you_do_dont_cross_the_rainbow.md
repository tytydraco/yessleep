There’s a fly buzzing around my head. It zigs and zags across my vision until it finally lands on my cheek and crawls its way up to my eye. Its pinprick legs float over my iris, but I can’t feel them. I can’t feel the grass I’m lying in either. I can hear the creek babbling next to me, but there’s no moisture in the air.

“Have you heard of the rainbow?” That’s how I remember it starting. One day, Natalie came into the school library and slapped her hands down on the table I was sitting at, a pearl white smile carving dimples into her cheeks.

“Have I heard of rainbows?”

She rolled her eyes. “No, I mean *the* rainbow, Graham.”

Something about hearing my name on someone else’s lips made me light up a little. It was a small reminder that I was still here, that there was at least one person who cared enough to remember me.

“I’m lost,” I told her.

She groaned, “It’s because you didn’t grow up here. Every kid in town knows about the rainbow.”

“Okay, so what is it?”

“It’s like an urban legend. Supposedly, there’s a stream deep in the North Woods, and if you follow it up far enough, you’ll find a waterfall. If you go there after a heavy rain, the most beautiful rainbow you could ever see will shine off the rocks.”

“That’s it?”

“No...” Her cheeks flushed pink, and her eyes fell to her feet. “People say that if you walk under the rainbow’s arch, something magical happens.”

“Like what?”

“People say different things. Some say it grants wishes.” She swallowed. “Some say it takes all your pain away.”

Her eyes flicked up to meet mine just briefly. I wish I had realized the truth of that look at the time. I thought she was worried she’d offended me, but that wasn’t it. She was looking for my reaction but not because she was worried about upsetting me.

“How do you even cross under a rainbow?” I asked, trying to deflect. “Isn’t that impossible?”

“I don’t know. It’s just a story.”

“Why’d you tell it to me?”

“Do you need me to spell it out to you, Mr. Mopey?” she teased, and I appreciated it because that’s what friends do to each other. They tease. It was good to still have at least one friend who would do that with me.

At some point, I came to the realization that I was a bomb. One of those cartoon ones where a ropy fuse trails off of a shining black ball. A couple months ago, a spark lit the fuse, and I didn’t even realize it. Most of my friends cleared out before the explosion. Natalie was the only one who stayed.

We’d been friends by circumstance, two people that preferred the silence of the library over the roar of the cafeteria during lunch. Eventually, we’d spent enough time in close proximity that we started talking. It started with asking each other about the books we were reading, and then we were venting to one another about the teachers we hated, and before long, we could talk about anything. But that didn’t mean we talked about everything.

I don’t think people are ever fully honest with anyone. How easy is it to lie when someone asks you how you’re doing? *I’m fine* is the easiest lie of all. It’s what people want to hear, but no one’s ever just *fine*.

“I really don’t think a mythical rainbow is gonna be the answer to all my problems,” I told her, and I remember wondering why she looked disappointed. “That’d be nice though.”

“I still don’t get why those assholes did that to you,” Natalie huffed. “It’s so unfair. You didn’t deserve that.”

My wrist stung with the truth I was hiding from her. I slid my hands beneath the table to silence it. “You never know what people are really thinking I guess.”

“I know what you mean,” Natalie sighed.



There’s a second fly now. I can hear it buzzing around my ear. It gets so loud at one point, I think it might have crawled inside and gotten itself stuck. I don’t bother to dig it out.

The sky is getting darker. Waves of gray sprawl beyond the edge of sight. I can smell the acrid scent of looming rain. I swallow my nerves, and there’s a sensation like gravel running down my throat. There’s a whisper of fear in the back of mind, telling me the rain won’t come, that there’s no going back.

“It’ll come,” I say aloud. I talk to myself more often these days. I’ve started to think I only exist inside my own mind now, so I talk to myself. I’m afraid I’ll cease to exist if I don’t.

Thinking helps too. My mind goes in circles, always taking me back to that day. The day the spark was lit.



I started wearing bracelets the summer of my sophomore year. I found a basket full of vintage leather bands at a local thrift store and bought enough to cover nearly half my forearm. They were uncomfortable at first, but I wore them every day and eventually got used to the way they wrapped and rubbed against my skin.

I don’t know why I took them off that day. A year after I started wearing the bracelets, I took a trip to the beach with my old friends. I didn’t want to ruin the leather in the water. I was with friends. I guess I thought it would be okay.

It was the first time I let anyone see my scar. A single, ugly line running down my wrist. One that I’d given to myself.

There was a strange atmosphere as we sat together at a picnic table in the park that evening, cooking frozen patties on a rusted charcoal grill. Everyone was looking at me with pity and confusion in their eyes. They asked questions, and I did my best to answer them. The hardest to answer was the simplest of all: *Why?* Because it’s hard to quantify why, to explain how the loneliness builds into worthlessness or how the apathy mounts into exhaustion until the weight is too crushing to lift anymore. People who don’t feel those things all the time don’t realize how heavy they can be, how tempting it can become to just let it all drop.

It almost felt good to talk about it, like finally some of the weight had been lifted. Until I looked up and saw their eyes again after my story was finished. I didn’t find worry there anymore, just discomfort. They were looking for a way out of this conversation, every one of them. And just like that, the spark was lit.

They treated me differently after that. They kept more distance from me and were quieter when I was around. I wanted to think they were just trying to figure out how to approach me now. But they weren’t keeping me at arm’s length because they were worried I was fragile. No, to them, I was already broken.

But I wasn’t willing to believe it was over. Not until the rumors started.

*Did you know that Graham Dean has a scar the length of a football down his arm?*

My heart went ice cold in my chest. Those words were reverberating down the hall. My secret, the one I had fought so hard to keep, was out. The scar on my wrist stung as if it was laughing at me, mocking me for being naive enough to think I could keep it a secret. There was only one way the rumor could have started. My friends really did abandon me after they found out what I’d done to myself, and then one of them must have told someone why they did.

Imagine you’re in the woods in the middle of the night. You’re standing in the center of a ring of trees, and beyond them, there’s nothing but black. All of a sudden, something glints from the dark, two small orbs spaced just a few inches apart. It takes you a second to realize they’re eyes, looking straight at you, and just as you do, another pair shines out of the dark. More and more begin to appear until you’re surrounded on all sides.

That’s what it was like at school that day. Everyone staring, whispering. I could feel every ounce of blood rushing through my veins, getting hotter. My whole body started trembling with some combination of rage and sorrow.

And then all I could think was that I wanted to talk to Natalie. I knew it was the only thing that could make me feel better because it always did. I hadn’t realized how much I’d come to rely on her for my own happiness. I suppose that made me pretty selfish.

I rattled out a quick text, my fingers still uneasy with the emotions overwhelming me. *You going to be in the library at lunch?* I pressed send, then tacked on, *Kinda need to vent.*

I watched the *Delivered* tag pop up beneath the messages and waited. Sometimes it took Natalie a while to text back, but I could always count on her to eventually. I clicked off my phone and shoved it in my pocket, trying not to count the seconds until I felt it vibrate.

Hours passed, but a text never came. Then the bell was ringing for lunch. I went straight to the library, hoping to find Natalie there anyway. I waited for ten minutes. She never showed up. So, I went looking for her.

I tried texting her again. *Everything okay?*

No response. 

I tried to rationalize why she was ignoring me, but no matter how hard I tried, I was simply having too shitty of a day for my brain to come up with anything more positive than *she hates you.*

I must have searched the entire school before I finally found her sitting alone on a stone bench in the courtyard. It was pouring rain, and I hadn’t thought to check outside. The bench was nestled safely under a veranda, just close enough to the edge that Natalie could reach her hand out and feel the raindrops fall against her skin.

“Natalie?” I said, my voice barely carrying over the rain.

She looked up at me without saying a word. I stepped closer so we could hear each other better over the rain.

“You kinda freaked me out,” I half-joked. “You didn’t reply to my texts.”

“Sorry,” she smiled. Looking back at it now, that smile was so strained. I should have realized it then. “It’s been a crazy morning.”

“Tell me about it,” I said. “I’m sure you heard the rumors going around.”

Her brow furled. “No...”

My wrist burned like it had caught fire. She didn’t know. And yet, part of me wanted her to. Now that everyone else knew, it didn’t feel right to keep Natalie in the dark anymore. She was the only person that cared enough to stand by me when my friends all left. She was the only one that deserved the full truth.

I reached deep inside, dragging the words out of me. “Do you think I could talk to you about something?”

Her chin fell to her chest. She didn’t even look at me when she said, “Can it wait? I really don’t know if I have it in me right now.”

Her words were like a bolt of lightning hammering straight into my heart. My body stiffened. I didn’t know what to say. It hadn’t been easy to dredge up the confidence to tell her, and I was afraid if I shoved it back down now, I’d never be able to summon it again. “It’s kind of important.”

Natalie rubbed her eyes with her fingertips. “Graham, I just can’t right now, okay? I’m sorry.”

“Did I do something?”

She threw her arms out in frustration. “It’s just too much for me right now. Why can’t you understand that?”

“Okay. Sorry. I understand.” I slinked back inside, leaving her alone. My heart felt hollow, my mind empty except for one thought. *No one wants you around. Not one person.*

Natalie was the last person that cared about me, and now I was nothing but a burden to her too.

Thunder rumbled overhead, and suddenly a new thought rose into my mind. Natalie had told me that the rainbow could take all of your pain away. Maybe I just wanted an excuse to get out of school for the day. Maybe I was just that desperate to feel better. I grabbed my things out of my locker and set off for the North Woods.

The rain pelted down against my skin and left my hair clinging to my scalp in mussed strands. I pressed on blindly through the woods. Natalie had mentioned a stream, but I couldn’t hear any running water over the rain battering the leaves. I searched and searched until my legs screamed and my breaths came in ragged gasps. When had I become so frantic?

I pushed through another layer of brush, and the ground fell out from beneath my feet. I rolled down an embankment, dirt stuffing my mouth and loose roots scratching at my skin, until I landed in a shock of cold water. My body pounded against a layer of stones beneath the surface, and I knew I would be bruised later. The freezing water gently flowing around me helped soothe my discomfort, and I realized with a snap where I was.

I sat up and stared up the stream. It stretched further than I could see. Could this be the one Natalie was telling me about? If I followed the water upstream, would I find a waterfall? Would a rainbow shine off those rocks when the sun came out?

There was only one way to find out. I trudged up through the water. I was soaked to the bone and shivering, my body threatening to break down, but I wouldn’t stop. Crimson ran down my left arm from where I must have cut it open during my fall, yet I hardly noticed. By the time I reached the waterfall, most of my body was numb from cold. I crawled onto the bank by the stream and watched the water crash down the rocks.

*Should I think of a wish?* Natalie mentioned some people say the rainbow grants wishes. Would I wish for all my friends back? No. No, I only had one friend worth wishing for. Would I wish for her forgiveness if I could? It almost didn’t seem fair to.

Of course, at the time, I was still pretty convinced I’d come out here for nothing. The rainbow couldn’t be real. Boy, was my face red when the rain finally let up and a hole in the clouds opened up just large enough to cast a ray of sunlight down on the rocks. The waterfall glowed, the wet sheen on the rocks sparkled like diamonds, and the light in the air twisted into a colorful pattern.

My jaw fell open. The most beautiful rainbow I’d ever seen was casting itself off the rocks, so vivid you’d swear you could reach out and touch it. It arched over the sunlight peaking through the clouds and sloped down into the river like a magical slide. You could almost see a trail of color running down the water where the rainbow met its surface, like it was being washed away down the river.

I pulled myself to my feet, marveling at the sight in front of me. I’d never seen anything quite like it. It shouldn’t have been possible, but somehow I knew that rainbow was more than just an optical illusion. It was really there, physically in front of me, inviting me in.

*Some say it grants wishes. Some say it takes all your pain away.*

Either option would have been good.

I inched forward. When my feet re-entered the water, it wasn’t cold like it was before. It was warm, relaxing. Another two steps and I was directly under the rainbow. It was how I imagine surfers feel when they ride the barrel of a wave. This isolating feeling, time slowing down, existing in a fleeting moment somewhere no one was ever meant to be.

My mind finally went quiet about how impossible this was. After all, it was happening. Logic would just have to find a way to accept the rainbow for what it was. I continued forward, pushing through to the other side of the rainbow. There was an urge to stay under it forever, but I knew the rainbow wouldn’t last. The clouds above were moving, and something inside me was afraid of what would happen to me if I didn’t come out the other side before the rainbow vanished. Would I disappear with it?

I fell onto the opposite river bank before I knew it. My entire body was radiating warmth. When I turned around, the sunlight had retreated back behind the clouds, and the rainbow was gone.



I’m lying in that same spot on the river bank now, though the feeling is completely different. The warmth from the rainbow is long gone, replaced by nothingness. If I had known then what I was doing to myself, would anything have changed? Would I have still crossed the rainbow?

The rain is falling again now, growing harder by the minute. I sit up and watch the rocks. The waterfall gushes with excess rainwater. I gaze up at the clouds, looking for a break in them. My breathing is heavy and purposeful as I watch. *The rain came. The sun will follow. Just like it did then.*



I woke up in my own bed the next morning, not remembering how I got there. Everything was a blur after I crossed the rainbow. I rose up and pulled the sheets off of me, expecting my body to be exhausted. Instead, I felt light, not a trace of soreness in my muscles.

*Some say it takes all your pain away.*

There was still a part of me that didn’t want to believe that the rainbow’s power was real, but it was hard to ignore the lack of bruising on my arms. I should have been covered in them after my fall yesterday, but my skin was clear. The cut on my arm had scabbed over, and when I pressed on it with my fingers, it didn’t even sting.

It didn’t seem to do anything for the dread stewing in my stomach over going to school, though. As I walked through the doors into a hallway packed with students, I braced myself for the stares.

No one even noticed me.

I walked to my locker, put my things away, and didn’t hear a single person whispering my name. It was bliss. I was floating on a cloud through all my morning classes. No side-eyes from any of my classmates. The teachers never even called on me.

I avoided Natalie at lunch. It felt immature, but I didn’t know how to face her. I wanted to tell her everything about the rainbow, but I was afraid she wasn’t ready to talk to me yet. I didn’t want to bother her, so I sat alone in an empty classroom during lunch, hoping maybe she would text me wondering where I was. She never did.

I swallowed a bite of my turkey sandwich and felt something catch in my throat. I coughed, but whatever it was didn’t dislodge. I swallowed a few gulps of water, but I could still feel it there, stuck against the back of my throat. *Squirming.*

I rushed to the nearest bathroom and bent over the sink. My lunch was forcing its way back up my throat. I let it erupt into the sink and felt the squirming come free from my throat. Through bleary eyes, I looked down into the basin and watched something twitch inside the pool of vomit slowly running down the drain. I wiped my eyes and looked closer.

A maggot. It was *a maggot*.

How had a maggot gotten into my throat? Was it in my sandwich? Was I eating rotting meat? I had to swallow down another round of vomit. I flipped on the faucet and drained my sick and the squirming creature along with it.

I decided to call it a day after that. I didn’t think I would be able to focus much in class after puking up a maggot, so I went home sick.

My stomach was still swirling as I walked home. I used to walk this route with a few of my old friends every day after school. We’d walk together up through Union Street, stop at the corner store and buy some snacks, then we’d go our separate ways for the day. I hated how much I missed that. Even after they abandoned me and told the whole school my secret, I still looked back on those days wistfully.

A fly buzzed around my ear. I tried to swat it away, but it seemed undeterred. It was driving me nuts, distracting me so much I didn’t even see the car coming as I stepped out into the crosswalk.

Eventually, I heard the whirring of an engine and the grinding of tires against pavement, and I turned to see the car rapidly approaching me. The driver wasn’t slowing down. It was like they couldn’t even see me. I jumped out of the way at the last second, my breath suddenly vacuumed out of my lungs. As I heaved in air, I watched the car continue down the road without a care.

*They had to have seen me.*

As if to add insult to injury, the fly continued to buzz around my head.



I did get used to them pretty quickly after that, the flies. More and more seemed to come every day. You wouldn’t think coughing up maggots would ever get easier, but eventually, it just started to fade into routine. It helps now that I can’t feel them wriggling inside of me anymore—though sometimes, if they crawl up far enough, I can taste them.

I hadn’t noticed the first time I came to the waterfall how quiet it is here. Aside from the sounds of the water, the forest is silent. No birds chirping, no squirrels scurrying through the trees, no deer trotting through the brush. Life seems to avoid this place. Even the trees surround the waterfall in a wide ring as if trying to get away.

These things all seem so obvious now, after what the rainbow has done to me. This place is not a miracle, it’s a curse.



I decided I was going to tell Natalie about the rainbow. Time crawled as I waited for the lunch block. The anticipation was killing me, and constantly glancing up at the clock after what felt like hours only to realize just ten minutes had passed only made it more excruciating.

No one was paying any attention to me again that day. It’s funny how quickly that lack of attention went from feeling like heaven to feeling like loneliness. It was like the entire world had forgotten me. Natalie would make it better. I just needed to talk to her, even if she wasn’t ready to talk to me.

When the bell finally rang, it took every ounce of restraint in me not to sprint to the library. I walked, my steps gradually hastening, down the hall. My nerves were so tight it felt like they might snap when I walked through the doors and saw her sitting at our table, her nose deep in a book. I sat down across from her and noted the title on the cover. We were planning to read that one together. She started it without me.

My mouth was dry as I opened it to speak. “Natalie.”

She didn’t look up. She didn’t even flinch.

“Natalie, I need to talk to you.”

Nothing. This wasn’t right. This wasn’t just Natalie ignoring me, giving me the silent treatment. This was something else.

I stood up and rounded the table. I tried calling her name again and again, but she wasn’t hearing me. I waved my hand in front of her eyes, but she didn’t see me. She *couldn’t* see me. I collapsed back into my chair, tears pooling in my eyes and blurring my vision. A fly buzzed through the room and landed on my hand.

I ran out into the hall, feeling bile rise into my throat again, and I could swear there was something squirming in there with it. I threw open the door to the stairwell and stumbled inside, clutching a hand over my mouth as if I could stuff my sickness back down. My feet were unsteady as I descended the stairs, and after a few steps, I felt my ankle give way beneath me. I crashed down the steps and came to a screeching halt at the bottom where my head smacked against the wall.

Everything went dark for a second, and as I regained my vision, the walls swirled around me in dizzying blurs. My head should have been pounding, but I didn’t feel a thing. I reached a hand up to feel the back of my head. My fingers were numb, a sensation like TV static under my skin, but I could just barely make out what felt like a loose flap of skin on the back of my head.

I yanked my hand away quickly, checking my fingertips for blood. They were clean. I felt the spot on my head again. There was something there. I knew there was. I slipped my phone out of my pocket and used it to take a photo of the back of my head.

I was right. The skin had split. There was a gaping wound on the back of my head. But no blood. No feeling. But there was something inside. I zoomed in on the photo and recognized two little maggots crawling across the back of my skull. I threw up then, and when I looked down at it, a half dozen more maggots were squirming inside the bile.

I don’t know what possessed me to do it. I think I was still trying to understand what exactly was happening to me. I found myself in the bathroom after that, staring at myself in the mirror. The reflection was still me, wasn’t it? *I* could still see me. Why couldn’t anyone else?

My frustration boiled over in that moment, and I smashed a fist against the mirror. It shattered, and fragments rained down into the sink. Slivers of glass were embedded in my knuckles. I couldn’t feel them. I just wanted to feel *something.*

I took off my leather bracelets and looked at my scar. I’d felt so alone when I had given myself that scar. I hoped I would never have to feel that kind of loneliness again, and I tried so hard not to. But that loneliness has a way of creeping back in.

A flash of light glimmered off one of the mirror shards in the sink. I picked it up and squeezed it tight. Then I plunged it into my scar and dragged it down my wrist. I didn’t feel a thing. I knew what this was supposed to feel like, and yet I still felt *nothing*.

I threw away the shard and gazed down at torn open flesh. There was so much blood last time. This time, there was none.



I’ve got theories about what happened to me when I crossed the rainbow. The first is that I died. That one’s pretty simple, though it doesn’t explain why no one seems to remember me. It would also mean that I can’t ever come back.

The second theory is that I’ve crossed into some other plane of existence, like the rainbow was some sort of gate, and now I’m stuck in the fourth dimension or something. But that doesn’t explain why I no longer feel or bleed or why my insides seem to be crawling with maggots.

At the end of the day, I think maybe there’s no real logic to it. Maybe I’m just cursed, and that’s all there is to it. Or maybe it did grant me a wish, one from the far reaches of my mind, a wish I thought I’d left behind but had maybe started to creep its way back in. A wish that I was dead.

It’s been weeks since I crossed the rainbow now. After that day with the mirror, I shut down for a while. I closed myself in my bedroom for days, trying to process what had happened to me. I didn’t eat that entire time, yet I never felt hungry. My parents never came looking for me, like they’d forgotten me too.

Eventually, I started to wonder what would happen if I crossed the rainbow again. Could I reverse what happened to me? Could things go back to normal? It was just my luck that we’d be in the middle of a drought. With no rain, the rainbow wouldn’t form, and I would be stuck like this.

I waited for days, swatting away flies and throwing up maggots. The cut I’d made on my arm didn’t seem to be healing on its own, nor was the cut on my head, so I stitched them closed myself. It was pretty easy considering I couldn’t feel the needle passing through my skin.

Finally, the forecast called for rain. A thunderstorm just a few days away. I felt a spark of hope for the first time in weeks. I didn’t know what would happen to me if I crossed the rainbow again, but I had to try. But before that, I wanted to see Natalie one last time.



I’d been to see Natalie a few times since crossing the rainbow. Most times I just sat in the library with her while she read. Sometimes I tried talking to her. The conversations were one-sided, but in some ways, it helped me feel less alone. And in others, the loneliness was crushing.

When I went to see her that day, she wasn’t alone. Two girls rushed over and sat at the table with her while Natalie was trying to read. I’d never seen Natalie with either of them before, and it didn’t take long for me to realize that they weren’t friends.

One of the girls plastered on a fake smile and said, “So, this is where you go during lunch?”

“Don’t you ever get bored sitting in here alone?” said the other girl with a needle-like voice. “Honestly, you couldn’t pay me to read for fun.”

Natalie tried to ignore them, lifting her book closer to her face as if to hide behind it.

“Oh, sorry. Are we bothering you?” said the girl with the ponytail.

“We just want to talk.”

“Yeah, you won’t ever make friends if you don’t talk to people you know.”

Natalie huffed and slapped her book shut. She gathered her things as quickly as she could and got out of there, the two girls pretending to beg her not to leave the entire time.

The one with the needle voice covered her mouth to laugh at Natalie as she walked away. “Oh my God, she’s gonna go cry again.”

I wished I could say something to the girls. Instead, I followed Natalie out to the courtyard, to the same place I’d found her the day I crossed the rainbow. I sat down next to her on the bench, even though she couldn’t see me. She cried silently for a few minutes, then wiped her tears.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I was a really shitty friend. I was so lonely when I met you. Lonelier than I even realized, I think. Even when I had my friends, it’s like there was no one I could really connect with.” I clutched the scar on my wrist. “I guess that’s why I did this.

“But then we started talking and getting closer, and that feeling started to fade. You have no idea how exciting that was, having someone to really talk to. Because some of the stuff we talked about—it’s stuff I never could have told anyone else. But it was just so easy with you. And I guess I took advantage of that. I started using you to make myself feel better, and that wasn’t fair. Because you were going through something too, and I was too wrapped up in myself to see it.

“That day you told me about the rainbow, that wasn’t just for my sake. It was for you too. I see that now, even if it’s way too late. You wanted an escape just as badly as I did. But I’m glad we didn’t cross the rainbow together. I hope you never do.”

Thunder rumbled in the distance, and I knew it was time for me to go. I stood, taking one last look at Natalie. I didn’t know if I would ever see her again.

“I wish I had been a better friend. Maybe it’s for the best that you don’t have to remember me, but if this works, if I ever do get another chance, I promise to do better. I’ll be a real friend this time.”

With that, I left her, and just like I had that day, I made for the North Woods to find the rainbow.



The rain is slowing down. The flies have come back, practically swarming now. I can taste the maggots in my mouth too, crawling through my teeth. I’m rotting from the inside out. Even my skin is starting to turn a sickly gray. I think maybe I don’t have much time left. If the sun doesn’t come out now, if the rainbow doesn’t appear, I don’t think I’ll last until the next rainstorm.

But just then, like a wish being granted, the sky splits open. The gray clouds part, and a beam of light shines through. It dazzles off the rocks and morphs into a wave of color. The rainbow is there.

I get to my feet. My body is so weak now, it’s a miracle I made it out here in the first place. I resolve myself and take the first step into the water. I cross the rainbow.
