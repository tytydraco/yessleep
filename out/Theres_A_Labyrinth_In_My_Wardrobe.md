The wardrobe had been purchased from an old antique shop that my mother frequented. It was an old wooden wardrobe, with brass handles, and the name, Simon (presumably the former owner) was etched into the back.

For the first few days things were relatively normal, despite the wardrobe doors seemingly opening on their own.

But then came the noises, always late at night, that sounded very similar to a horse's hooves on a stone floor, coming from the wardrobe, along with a chilly breeze blowing out from the cracks of the wooden doors.

*It's just your tired brain playing tricks on you!* I tried to convince myself. *It's all in your head!*

I told myself that for four nights, as I ignored the quite frankly *terrifying* sounds coming from the wardrobe, which I never had enough courage to open.

But on the fifth night I had had enough of the sleepless nights, I was tired of the absolute terror every night, due to my brain filling in the blanks of the many horrifying possibilities waiting for me behind those wooden doors.

I got up from my bed, with only the moonlight beaming through the open blinds. My heart was racing fast, as I slowly made my way towards the wardrobe, feeling that now familiar breeze through the cracks, only now much more intense, like a strong wind was blowing from the other side.

Slowly reaching out, I pulled the brass handles, the doors *creaked* loudly, moaning as they opened.

The darkness inside the wardrobe was so heavy and dense, that it was like staring into an absolute void of nothingness.

*Anything could live in that darkness!* I thought, which didn't do much to help my nerves.

I slowly, and hesitantly reached out both arms, plunging them into the wardrobe – reaching out far – yet never meeting the back.

I then stepped into the wardrobe, just as Lucy did in C.S Lewis's, The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe.

Only this was certainly not Narnia, there was no snow, or friendly Fauns offering cups of tea, only a narrow arched, stone tunnel greeted me.

*What is this place?* I thought, not having a fucking clue what was going on. *Am I dreaming?* I wiped my eyes in disbelief, then stared down the long passageway, which was heavily blanketed in darkness.

It felt endless as I blindly felt my way down the narrow passage, my breathing heavy, my heart beating like the drums of war inside my chest…

To say that I was terrified would be an understatement.

*I don't think this is a good idea!* The rational part of my brain said. *But it's not everyday you find something like this!* Said the more curious side.

Continuing on through the passage, my eyes finally began to adjust to the darkness a little, and I noticed the walls were dripping with some kind of moisture, which upon closer inspection felt way too thick between my finger and thumb to have been water, and smelled strange.

After a while I finally approached a bend in the passageway.

Looking down the new hallway, which was just as dark, and narrow as the last, I felt a sense of unease, like something was watching me in that darkness, I could feel it in my bones.

I debated whether I should continue on, or head back to the safety of my bedroom, and forget this place even existed…

But that wasn't going to happen, I needed to know what this place was, so curiosity drove me forward, down the new passageway.

As I continued on, I came to realise the absolute silence of this place, an unsettling quiet, that brought many terrifying thoughts to mind.

*Maybe I should turn back!* My eyes were endlessly darting around the darkness, my breathing was growing heavier, as my heart raced faster.

Each step I took became slower and slower, as I hesitantly continued on.

After a while, I reached a dead end.

*All of this for nothing!* I thought, as I stared at the stone wall in defeat.

Feeling exhausted, I leaned against the side wall to rest a little before heading back.

As soon as I leaned against the wall, a hidden door opened behind me, causing me to fall onto my back, and knocking the wind right out of my lungs.

*What the?* I slowly sat up, confused. *Where am I now?*

This hidden passage was much wider than the others, a lot taller too.

I got onto my feet, and brushed myself off, squinting in the darkness, as I took in my new surroundings.

Ahead were three arched tunnels, which each appeared to be branching in a different path – one left – another right – the last headed straight on from what I could see.

*Which way?* I thought, scratching my head.

Before I could make my decision, I was startled by a noise in the darkness behind me. It sounded like footsteps – bare feet on a stone floor – slowly getting closer.

I suddenly screamed, as a hand grabbed my shoulder.

"Shh! Be quiet!" Came a whisper.

I turned around to see a podgy boy standing there with his finger pressed against his lips.

"W-who are you?" I replied.

"Sorry to scare you!" The boy replied, still whispering. "My name is Milo."

"Why are you whispering?"

"It would be best if you also whispered too!" Milo replied, with a serious look in his eyes. "We don't want that *thing* finding us!"

"What thing?" I asked, confused, and a little terrified.

Milo's eyes suddenly looked frightened. "A monster!"

"W-what?" I muttered, feeling a strong urge to turn back.

Milo changed the subject. "How did you end up here anyway?"

"My wardrobe," I replied. "How about you?"

"Same!" He said. "I just walked into the wardrobe, and ended up stuck here in this maze!"

"What do you mean *stuck?"*" I asked.

Milo chuckled nervously. "Haven't you figured it out yet?"

"Figured what out?"

Milo suddenly looked serious. "There is no leaving this place!"

I couldn't fully understand what he was saying, or maybe I didn't want to understand, maybe it was better I didn't hear any of this.

"I'm going home!" I said, eyeing the walls, trying to remember which way I had tumbled in?

"Good luck with that!" Milo said.

I tried to find the way I had come in, but couldn't. My hands felt blindly along the cold walls, trying hard to find the escape.

"You won't find it!" Milo said. "Besides, even if you did, it wouldn't lead you back the way you came."

"What?"

"This place shifts around all the time," Milo replied. "When one door closes, another opens in its place."

"What are you talking about?" I said.

Milo moved closer. "What I am trying to say is that there is no going back!"

"How do you know all of this?" I asked.

"I have been here for hours now!" Milo looked down to the floor. "I tried going back, and all it did was lead me somewhere else!"

"There must be a way!" I said, feeling desperate to be back safely in my bed again.

"If there is, I haven't found it," Milo replied.

*The tunnels!* I thought. *One of them could lead to a way out!*

"We need to go down one of these tunnels," I stood in front of the three passageways. "But which one?"

"Well I came in here through the right one, so either the left, or the middle," Milo replied.

"Let's try the middle," I said.

We wandered the narrow tunnel for what seemed like hours before meeting another impasse, two more diverging passageways stood to the left and the right.

"Which way?" I asked.

"Uhh… left?" Milo didn't seem so sure.

We turned left and made our way down another same old tunnel, which I was already growing tired of seeing.

"Are all the tunnels identical?" I asked.

"Pretty much,"  Milo replied.

We continued on for a while, until a noise emerging from the darkness ahead made the both of us stop dead in our tracks.

"W-what is that?" I timidly said, almost inaudibly.

Milo's chubby face had gone as pale as a ghost – a look of pure terror – a lost boy who wanted his mummy.

The noise was getting louder.

*I recognise that sound!* I thought.

The clopping of hooves on stone continued to echo from ahead, followed by a sound, much like that which a Bull makes with its nostrils before a charge, a *huffing* sound.

"It's the monster!" Milo said, his eyes wide with fright.

Two angry, crimson eyes peered from a huge, horned silhouette ahead, still too obstructed by darkness to see, yet the monstrosity of that outline was enough to make me run.

Milo began running too, all the while the *clopping* grew louder, and heavier behind us.

"Keep going, don't stop!" I said, looking over at Milo, who was beginning to tire.

I caught one quick glimpse over my shoulder at that creature chasing us, and screamed, before quickly picking up my pace.

"I-i c-can't-keep up!" Milo shouted, barely able to catch his breath.

A bullish *bellow* erupted from behind, as its hooves began to quicken – moving at a frightening speed – too fast for poor, fat Milo to outrun.

"Keep going!" I shouted, as a turn appeared ahead.

Milo was struggling, as we turned the corner, his breathing very laboured, and wheezy.

"Don't stop Milo!" I shouted.

We had been running for a while before either of us realised that that thing was no longer chasing us – it seemingly retreated back into the shadows – waiting for its opportunity to strike again.

"I-i really thought I was a gonna then!" Milo said, collapsing to the floor exhausted.

"We need to keep going!" I said, before helping Milo back onto his feet. "I don't like how it just stopped chase like that!"

"I'm so tired!" Milo's breathing was still heavy.

"We can rest once we know it's safe!"

We both continued on down the narrow tunnel.

One thing was for certain, Milo was right about this place shifting. That thing had caused us to turn back the way we had come, yet now there were different bends, and labyrinthine tunnels branching in all directions…

In fact this was the most disorienting place of them all.

"Didn't we just take this turn?" Milo said.

"I'm not even sure anymore?" I replied.

As we tried to gather our bearings, a sound echoed from one of the tunnels, it sounded like a dog barking, followed by a girl's voice.

"Rocko, get here now!" The girl's voice echoed.

"Can you hear that?" Milo said.

"I think it's coming from down there," I pointed to the tunnel to our right.

We followed the sound, until it eventually grew louder.

A golden Labrador suddenly leaped out from the darkness, and ran straight towards us – tongue out – tail wagging.

I knelt down to greet the dog, but Milo kept his distance.

"You're a friendly boy ain't ya," I said, scratching behind his ears.

The girl's voice was now very close, as she called out again. "Rocko, where are you?"

"Over here!" I called.

A confused, blonde haired girl walked out from the darkness. "H-hello?"

The dog immediately ran over to her.

"Don't you run off again!" She scolded the dog, before turning to us. "Who are you?"

We introduced ourselves.

"I'm Ruby, and this is Rocko," she said, patting the dog's head. "What is this place?"

"I don't know?" I replied, just as baffled as she was.

"How did you get here?" Milo asked.

"I left my wardrobe door open, and Rocko ran inside," she paused for a moment, trying to wrap her brain around the very strange situation. "I ran after him, and here I am, wherever *here* is?"

"That's so strange!" Milo said.

"What is?" Ruby replied.

"That is how we got here, in the wardrobe!"

"How do I get back home?" She asked.

"We don't know!" Milo, and I both said in unison.

"Anyway, getting out of here is the least of our concerns," Milo said, looking frightened once again.

"Huh?" Ruby was confused.

"Don't worry!" I said, not wanting to frighten her.

"What are you not telling me?" She demanded to know.

I looked over at Milo, who looked back at me with fearful eyes.

"Uhh… well, you see, we ain't alone here!" I mumbled.

"Well duh!" Ruby replied, rolling her eyes. "I can see that!"

"No, you don't get it!" Milo piped in. "He is not talking about us!"

"Still not making any sense?" Rubby shrugged.

"There's a monster here!" I blurted, feeling dread building in my stomach. "It chased me and Milo earlier."

"Yeah, right!" She chuckled.

Rocko suddenly bolted from Ruby's side, and disappeared in the darkness ahead.

"That dumb dog!" Ruby sighed. "ROCKO, GET HERE NOW!"

"Be quiet!" Milo said, nervously.

Ruby ignored him, and started to chase after Rocko.

"Hey, don't go off alone!" I called out.

She was already beginning to disappear into the darkness.

We chased after her, hearing Rocko's playful barks ahead, followed by Ruby's voice calling out to him in a foolishly loud tone.

"That thing's gonna hear her!" Milo panicked.

It was already too late.

Rocko's playful barks were now frightened whimpers echoing from the darkness.

"ROCKO!" Ruby shouted.

The whimpers had now turned to a growl, which was followed by a *screeching* yelp.

"ROCKO!"

The dog's yelp soon died down to a deafening silence.

"We need to turn back, right now!" Milo grabbed at my shoulder, his hand trembling violently.

"We need to get Ruby!" I said, trying to gather enough courage to venture further down the tunnel.

The clopping of hooves had now replaced the silence with an atmosphere of dread.

*It's found us!*

My heart was beating so fast in my chest as I ran ahead to get Ruby, I genuinely believed it was going to explode out of my chest at any moment.

Milo tried to call me back, but I couldn't just leave her.

I continued on without him.

I finally found Ruby, who was standing like a deer in headlights.

"Ruby, we need to run, now!" I said, grabbing her hand.

"I'm not leaving Rocko!" She said, tears welling in her eyes. "I won't!"

She broke free of my hand, and started to run ahead, yet soon paused when two crimson eyes appeared in the darkness ahead.

"What is that?" Ruby muttered, her tear filled eyes full of fear.

A blood curdling *bellow* suddenly permeated the tunnel, like that of a raging bull.

The clopping quickened in pace, shaking the ground with a tremor.

Ruby, and I ran back to Milo, who was still standing nervously where he had been.

"Run!" I screamed.

We ran as fast as we could, all the while that thing was hot in pursuit behind.

"Keep going, don't look back!" I shouted, panicking.

We ran through the labyrinthine tunnels, with their enclosed twists and turns only serving to disorient us amid the chaos and panic of the heavy, *thudding* clops behind.

"It's catching up!" Ruby screamed.

Milo's podgy face was red with fluster, and his breathing like that of an asthmatic having an attack.

"I c-can't k-keep going!" The fear in Milo's wheezy voice was very evident.

"Don't give up!"

Milo suddenly collapsed to the floor.

"MILO!" I screamed.

"G-go on w-witho…."

Ruby and I both watched in horror as two large, hairy, clawed hands emerged from the darkness, and wrapped around Milo's ankles, dragging him screaming into the shadows.

I tried to run after him, but Ruby pulled me back.

"Don't leave me!" She said, crying.

Milo's screams became more distant, until eventually there was only silence.

Neither Ruby, or I said a word, as we quietly tiptoed down the identical tunnels.

*You could have saved him!* The guilt in my brain said.

Ruby would occasionally wipe away tears and snot, as we made our way through the nightmarish maze.

"We need to rest," I said, feeling exhausted.

I sat down and rested against the wall in defeat, I no longer had thoughts of seeing home again, didn't think there was any escaping at all, this was to be our tomb.

"We're going to die here aren't we?" Ruby sobbed.

I could do nothing to reassure her, when I too believed the same thing. There was no way we could outrun that beast forever, besides, even if the creature didn't get us, thirst and starvation definitely would.

*I'm so tired!* I thought, my eyelids becoming heavy, as I rested more into the wall.

I didn't remember dozing off, but I was suddenly awoken by Ruby shaking me.

"Can you hear that?" She said, pointing to the end of the tunnel "It's coming from down there!"

In fact, I could, it was like the *whooshing* of water.

I quickly got up to my feet, and rubbed at my eyes, before looking into the dark veil ahead.

"It's a way out!" Ruby said, grabbing me by the arm. "Let's go!"

"Wait!" I said, releasing my arm from her grip. "We don't know what's down there?"

"It's our only hope, we have to try!" Ruby pleaded.

I reluctantly went ahead, as Ruby followed behind.

A draft whistled from around the bend, as we inched closer to the source of the sound, which was getting much louder now.

I timidly peeked around the bend, expecting to see another identical arched tunnel, yet finding a spacious expanse.

"What the…" I was jaw dropped.

The sound was a waterfall, beating down hard upon a river flowing between trees that bore fruit, as well as a broad array of foliage, and sharp looking thorns twining around black rocks…

But best of all, there was light, though where it was coming from remained a mystery.

"Wow!" Ruby's eyes held the same amazement as my own.

For just a brief moment that sadness in her expression was a glimmer of hope. I watched as she barged past me, and went straight towards the river, knelt down, cupping her hands into the flowing water, before bringing it to her lips for a grateful gulp.

"It tastes funny!" Ruby said, gagging a little. "What the fuck is that?"

"Don't drink anymore!" I said, approaching the river for a better look.

The water was clear, and *semi* clean looking. I say semi because there were tiny black specks floating around in it.

*What did she just drink?* I thought.

"The fruit has to be fine, right?" Ruby said, as she approached one of the trees, and picked one of the few apples that she could reach. "I'm so hungry!"

I watched as she took a big bite into the apple, and once again her face *scowled* as a red liquid dribbled down her chin.

She quickly spat it out, then began to vomit. "It tastes like blood!"

I took a look at the discarded apple on the ground. The flesh of the fruit looked like *literal* flesh, all meaty, and gristly, with blood spurting from a tiny vein which Ruby had severed with her teeth.

*Jesus fucking Christ!* I couldn't have hid the horror on my face if I tried.

"What the hell is this place!" Ruby was still heaving.

Something etched into one of the tree trunks suddenly caught my eye, something was written into the bark. It read…

**Tina**

*Who is Tina?* I thought, making my way over to one of the other trees, and seeing the same etching into the bark, only this one read…

**Nathan**

An uneasy feeling rose in the pit of my stomach, telling me that this was a place we never should have found.

"I don't like this place!" I said, looking over to Ruby. "I think we should leave!"

Before Ruby could reply, a sound from the tunnel ahead made my heart almost jump out of my chest.

*Clop, Clop, Clop,* echoed from the dark veil of the tunnel.

"Quick hide!" I whispered, pulling Ruby behind a bush.

With just the sound of our panicked breath in our ears, we both watched as the creature emerged from the tunnel, carrying Milo's body in one huge clawed hand.

This was the moment where I actually laid eyes upon the creature in full light…

The only way that I could truly describe it would be, that it resembled a Bull on two legs, with huge twisted horns that looked sharp and jagged, and crimson eyes that glowed like embers, all atop a body all hairy, and ape-like despite the two hooves for its feet.

It carried Milo over to a heap of soil, where a hole had been dug already, then carefully – like a gardener planting some flowers – it lowered Milo's limp body into the hole feet first.

"What is it doing?" Ruby whispered.

"Shh!" I hushed her.

It then began to pack soil into the hole, while ensuring that Milo remained in an upright position as it did so.

Ruby, and I both watched as the creature then stood over Milo, who was half protruding from the soil, now standing upright on his own.

That thing then began to perform a gesture into the air using one of its claws, drawing some kind of symbol, which caused Milo's (or should I say *not* Milo's) now whitened eyes to open, before letting out a deafening, inhuman shriek.

His head then began jolting left to right, up and down, all the while that ear piercing shriek continued.

(Not) Milo's lifeless gaze fell upon the bush in which we were hiding behind, and the shrieking suddenly stopped, leaving behind an uncomfortable silence, his gaze curiously scanning the area, like a cat seeing a mouse scuttle out of the corner of its eye.

Ruby, and I ducked, hoping we hadn't been seen.

His gaze had caught the creature's attention, as it too turned to face the bush.

"Shh!" My eyes wide with fear, as I looked at Ruby, with my finger pressed to my lips.

*We need to get out of here!* I thought, tapping Ruby on the arm, gesturing for her to keep low, and head for the tunnel behind us.

I watched as she went first, crouched as low as possible, as she quietly crept over to the tunnel. All the while Milos gaze was still in our direction, like a searchlight scanning every inch of ground for an intruder.

Ruby was almost to the tunnel, when all of a sudden Milo began to shriek again, before screaming in a voice not his own…

"OVER THERE!"

The fire in the creature's eyes suddenly grew more redder.

The creatures gaze had now found Ruby, as it watched her for a moment, before kicking up soil with its hooves, readying for a charge, as it *bellowed* with rage.

"Run!" I screamed to Ruby, as I quickly got up from behind the bush, and ran for the tunnel.

(Not) Milo's inhuman voice now carried with it a mocking tone. "There's nowhere to hide!"

The creature began its charge, dashing straight for us at a frightening pace.

We ran for the tunnel, each time looking over our shoulder to see that thing not far behind.

"You are going to die here!" (Not) Milo's inhuman voice continued to taunt. "Nobody escapes the Labyrinth!"

The tunnel was just ahead as we picked up our pace to reach it before that thing caught up.

"The Minotour will get you!" He continued, his laugh like that of a cackling witch. "Just like it got me!"

Just as we made it to the tunnel entrance, the creature bounded with an unnatural leap, and landed in front of our escape, blocking it.

"No running away this time!" (Not) Milo chuckled.

Ruby and I backed away from the huge monstrosity which was standing dominantly in front of the entrance. It then began to slowly *clop* towards us, no longer with haste, but with a casual stride, inching closer and closer.

We continued backing away, knowing at any moment that thing could tear us to shreds. All the while it continued to menacingly approach at a slow pace. It was enjoying our fear.

I grabbed the biggest rock from the ground, and held it tightly in my grip. *I'm not going down without a fight!*

Ruby stood behind me shivering with fright, and crying in panic.

The redness of the creature's eyes brightened, glowing like two angry suns, as steam angrily escaped from its nostrils.

It was directly in front of us now. I readied the rock high, prepared to strike, to do as much damage as I could before I was killed.

The creature *bellowed,* standing dominantly tall above me, as it raised  its huge clawed hand, ready to swipe my head clean off in one swoop.

With fear in my eyes, and my heart beating like crazy, I clenched my teeth, gripping the rock harder in my grasp, ready to go out with a fight.

Just as it was about to strike, it suddenly paused, listening intently to a sound echoing from the tunnel to our left.

It was the sound of a dog barking, getting closer.

"Rocko!" Ruby's eyes widened.

Suddenly emerging from the dark tunnel was a golden blur darting from the shadows, teeth bared, and growling, as Rocko leapt at the creature, biting down hard into its arm.

The creature let out a rageful bellow, then flung Rocko hard against a tree.

"NO!" Ruby screamed.

Rocko struggled to his paws, whimpering as he did so.

The creature then began to approach the wounded dog, ready to finish the job.

Ruby picked up a rock and charged, flailing it around in the air. "LEAVE HIM ALONE!"

Before I could stop her, she lunged at the creature.

I watched as she ran at the creature in a blind rage, and repeatedly hit it in the leg with the rock to no effect.

Before Rocko could make it to her aid, the creature gored Ruby straight through her eye with one of its horns. She dropped like a sack of potatoes to the ground.

"RUBY!" I screamed.

Rocko growled more fiercely than before, and with what little strength he had left, he leapt at the creature once again, biting hard into its face, ripping and tearing in a frenzy of rage, as the beast bellowed in pain.

Then with a loud *clack* Rocko's teeth clamped down hard onto one of the horns, before *crunching* down hard, and snapping the horn off.

The horn dropped to the floor, and Rocko jumped down, then proceeded to bite down hard into its leg.

The creature kicked Rocko away, bellowing in frustration, but the dog got straight back up, and lunged once again.

*I have to help him!* I thought, my eyes suddenly falling on the sharp horn laying on the ground, still dripping with Ruby's blood.

I picked up the horn, readying it like a spear. "HEY, OVER HERE!"

It kicked Rocko away again, then turned to me.

Rocko got back up, and was back on its leg, ripping pieces of its flesh away.

Without thinking, I charged, holding the horn out in front of me, and plunged it deep into the side of the beast, who bellowed in agony, before collapsing to the ground with a great *thud.*

I watched as the crimson ember eyes of the beast gradually dimmed, dying down to darkness as it took its final breath.

Rocko limped over to Ruby's body, then curled up next to her, whining with grief.

"I'm sorry boy!" I said, patting Rocko's head, tears welling in my eyes.

"IT CAN'T BE!" (Not) Milo's white stare shot in my direction. "NOBODY CAN BEAT THE MINOTAUR!" He screamed.

I approached (Not) Milo, who was flailing around in the hole, panicking.

"Well guess what?" I said, looking at the thing which had once been Milo. "I just did!"

"FUCK YOU!" (Not) Milo screamed, his white eyes completely lifeless.

*I can't just leave him like this!* I thought, before picking up a rock. *But first I needed to know that he was not there anymore!*

"Milo, if you are still in there somewhere, let me know!" I said, hoping that he was.

"Milo's dead!" (Not) Milo chuckled. "Gone forever!"

With a sickening *crunch,* I repeatedly bashed his head in with the rock, until it was nothing but a green *mush* of fuck knows what?

I then turned away, and went back over to Rocko, who hadn't moved from Ruby's side.

"Come on boy, let's find a way out of this place!"

Rocko limped by my side through the labyrinthine passageways for two days, before finally a *literal* light at the end of the tunnel guided me back to the safety of my bedroom, where I emerged from the wardrobe, with Rocko limping behind.

What was days in the Labyrinth, had only been mere minutes in reality. And lying to my mother about how I had suddenly got a dog in the middle of the night was not easy. But she did let me keep him. And he went on to give me seven loving years before passing away peacefully in his sleep.

I have never told anybody about the Labyrinth before, in fact this has been the first time I have thought about that place in a long time, almost twenty years to be exact…

It feels good to *finally* get it off my chest.
