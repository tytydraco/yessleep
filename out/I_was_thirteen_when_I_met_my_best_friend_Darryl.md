He was tall, with unkempt blonde hair, a sparkling white smile, and bright blue eyes that lit up his acne-ridden face. He did not hide his feelings about me the first time we met.

My older brother, Karrion, was like a father to me. It felt like my mom was always working, so Karrion had to step up and play dad at 15. It wasn’t fair to him, but it didn’t bother him. My father was never in the picture, but neither my mom nor brother would tell me why. Unfortunately, I couldn’t leave well enough alone and did some digging behind my mom’s back. To this day, I regret it more than anything else. My father, my blood, was locked up at the Iowa State Penitentiary for crimes relating to people under the legal age. He was locked up in 2014, and I was two when he was doing these terrible acts. I pray that he never gets out. 

I met Darryl in the park while I was on a walk with my older brother. I remember this day so vividly. Karrion and I had been at the park for only forty minutes to an hour when Karrion had to use the bathroom. So he did what any responsible brother would do and made me stand by the door so that nothing would happen. As my brother went into the bathroom, Darryl was coming out.

 Darryl didn't skip a beat when he asked, “ What’s a perty lil thang like you doing outside the men’s bathroom?” He continued, “Aren’t you a little young to be out here on your lonesome?”
 
My face turned red, and instead of responding, I stood quietly, as if I was too embarrassed to answer. Darryl gave me a dirty look, as if I had said something rude, and walked away. Karrion finally got out of the bathroom after what felt like ages. He seemed concerned about me talking to some random guy, but I convinced him I was fine. He decided we were going straight home after that. I wish I had told him what I had seen when we left.

 Behind us, Darryl was barely out of view, staring. Somehow, he had managed to make it behind the park’s bathrooms without me or my brother noticing. Every time I looked behind us, he was in a different spot, as if he knew I had seen him in the last place. After leaving the park, I didn’t see Darryl, but I still felt his eyes burning a hole through the back of my head.

When my brother and I made it home, he went to the kitchen and started dinner. The layout of our house is peculiar, to say the least. Our welcoming living room greets you when you enter the front door. Going straight through the living room after entering, you’ll reach a short hallway with three doors on the right side. The furthest from the living room was my brother’s room, the middle door was the bathroom, and the door closest to the living room was my room. My mom's room was at the end of the hallway, and a small walk-in closet was across from the bathroom door. Our rooms did not have closets, so we shared the closet across from the bathroom. We always try to keep the bathroom door closed because we have had problems with rodents getting in through the broken window. The kitchen was straight to the right after you walked into the house. While my brother worked on dinner, I got our TV dinner trays set up in front of the couch so we could watch TV while we ate. After I set up the trays, he brought in our scrambled eggs and bacon, and we ate and cleaned up with little to no conversation. 

Shortly after cleaning, I made my way to my room. My brother and I don’t bond over many things, but one thing we do bond over is music. My room contains posters of bands like Killswitch Engage, Ingested, Mushroomhead, Seether, and Staind. I use music as an escape from reality sometimes. The music lets me feel any emotion I want. I decided I wanted to try to be in bed early, so I turned on Isolate and Medicate, closed my window, and slowly started to drift to sleep. 

I woke up to the front door slamming like every other night. My mom was home. I removed the covers and got out of bed. I felt a cool breeze, so I went to my window and closed it. I left my room expecting a light or two to be on in the kitchen or living room, but it was pitch black. I went to the bathroom, and the door had been left open. I paid no mind to it and went in like normal. Everything was as it was the last time I had gone in, except my hairbrush was on the back of the toilet instead of in my drawer. 

“I probably forgot to put it back,” I mumbled.

I grabbed the brush and opened the drawer, but as I went to put it in, I realized there was blonde hair in the bristles. I dropped the brush and immediately ran to my mom’s room. She wasn’t there. My brother came rushing into the room after hearing my footsteps in the hall. 

“Are you ok, Kenz?” Karrion blurted out. 

“Mom’s not here,” I murmured. 

“Mom’s not supposed to be here for another hour or so,” he replied.

I weakly responded, “The front door just slammed, though.”

Karrion convincingly explains, “I think you were having a bad dream. I didn’t hear the front door at all.”

“You’re probably right. Do you mind sleeping in here with me until Mom gets home?” I asked.

“That’s fine, do you want me to get the CD player?” he questioned.  

“Please,” I said. 

He went to my room, grabbed my CD player, and grabbed my favorite album, One-X. After returning to my mom’s room, he closed and locked her door, turned on the CD player, and skipped to my favorite song, Pain. Shortly after, I drifted back to sleep.
