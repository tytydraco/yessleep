No one hated war more than I did—I was as pacifist as they come. Which was great, since war wasn’t something I had to worry about.

I’d watched my fellow classmates signing up for the military in our final year of high school, the way in which military recruiters would ply them with promises of honour, duty or money. None of that came close to working on me. I was grateful to be from a country that didn’t have a military draft. I wasn’t going to trade my freedom, serenity—or possibly, life—for anything.

The notion of young men and women going away to faraway lands to violently kill others, many of them innocents, disturbed me to my core. On my college campus, I was always out campaigning against war crimes and advocating for peace. I was a regular hippie archetype, right down to the long hair and sandals. The furthest thing you could imagine from a soldier.

Yet, like so many hippies from decades past, my world changed one day when I received a letter in the mail.

The envelope was ordinary, save for one detail. The stamp on the top right corner was a mixture of strange symbols that I had never seen before. Pulling it out of my dorm mailbox, I wondered how a stamp like that had even been accepted by the post office.

I pulled out the letter inside, and instantly assumed from the layout of the words that I’d gotten some kind of fine. I must’ve run a red light without even realising, I cursed to myself.

Then I started reading the letter and my frustration turned into bewilderment.

The wording was formal, and addressed me like it was coming from the government. But there was no way that the Australian government had sent me this.

*“Greetings Mr Allen,*

*“Please be advised that, in light of our nation’s escalating war with enemy nations, we have reinstated mandatory conscription for our pool of able citizens.*

*You are hereby notified that you, a male citizen of the nation of Extorvis between the ages of 18 and 30, have been selected for military training and service herein.”*

I scoffed in disbelieving amusement. What a silly prank. I had a reputation on campus for being a peacemaker refusenik and someone who saw me probably thought this was the perfect gag. Good to know at least people are paying attention even if they’re assholes, I thought.

Yet, even despite the clear absurdity of the letter, something about it felt so real, so authentic. It was just how government letters were written in real life, down to the font and formatting. I kept reading.

*“You are to report for active duty in two months’ time of receipt of this letter. Enclosed is one map and token for the purposes of your travels to said induction station at the location listed below.*

*It is your obligation to inform any relatives, loved ones and employers of your conscription and make arrangements for the duration for which you will be deployed. This period is subject to high command discretion, and may range from 2 to 2,000 years.*

*Willful failure to report promptly to this location at the hour and on the day specified in this notice will violate the Mandatory Training and Service Act of 103,472, and will subject you to immediate arrest, imprisonment and corporal punishment.*

*Be warned that no leniency will be granted to any who choose to ignore this directive.*

*Signed, Extorvis Military Commander ______”*

On the signature line, instead of a legible name was an indecipherable scribble in purple ink that cannot have been in English. Hell, it didn’t look like any other language I’d seen either.

And that country's name: Extorvis. In all my education, I’d never heard of it before. I certainly wasn’t a citizen of it. 

“What’s that?” asked my preppy roommate, who had been regarding my befuddled expression at the letter with curiosity.

“Just more evidence that not even our delinquents are smart here at Melb U” I said.“Dumbasses don’t even know any real countries to prank me with.”

I showed him the letter and his reaction was just as incredulous as mine had been.

“Godspeed in Extorvis bro” he joked, slapping the paper back into my hand. “I know you’ll be their finest soldier.”

That night, I looked up the nation of Extorvis on Wikipedia just to be sure and, sure enough, it was as nonexistent as it was ridiculous. Nor was the strange, ominous nation anywhere on the globe in the campus library.

A few weeks passed by and I tried to forget about the bizarre prank letter. I knew it was fake, knew it had to be fake, and yet, every day that passed made me feel uneasier. As if some invisible clock was ticking down and my drafting date really was drawing near. I brushed it off as concern about the prankster escalating this and sending me something worse.

To put my mind at ease, I took the strange letter to the local post office. Surely they could tell me if the letter was actually sent from there and, if so, who had really sent it. The sender’s address on the envelope had just been another mixture of strange symbols like the stamp and signature, besides the word Extorvis, so I was in the dark.

I’d half-expected the post office worker to laugh me out of the building when I showed him the letter. I didn’t expect him to go quiet and stare at me like I was a walking missile target.

“Can you tell me who really sent this or what?” I asked impatiently.

The balding postal worker steadied himself and explained in hushed tones.

“Look, this letter is indeed a real government order. The sender was the party marked on the address. If I was you, I’d report for duty like it says. It’s…much worse for those who don’t. You might have a chance if you do. Also, it is a federal offence to disobey it.”

“Are you kidding me? How can I report to the military of a fictional place? Extorvis doesn’t exist.” 

“It doesn’t exist in *this* reality” was all he hissed back to me.

And before I could get another word in, he was on to the next customer. What the hell.

Now I was definitely feeling anxious about the mysterious draft letter. Could what he said really be true?

I hopped online again but, this time, headed straight for the Internet forums instead of academic sources. If this letter had really been sent to others before like the postal worker implied, then someone would have asked the same questions I’m asking now:

*“Where is the country Extorvis? Why am I being drafted by them? How dangerous is serving in their military? What exactly is it I’ll be fighting? When will I be discharged? Who has successfully evaded their draft?”*

My forum posts were only live for an hour when I received a short, private message from someone in response.

*“Are they drafting you too?”*

I hurriedly messaged back my confirmation. Their next message came almost instantly.

*“Can we meet?”*

Meeting up with a stranger over the Internet, who I’d only briefly messaged with, who might be potentially crazy, was not the smartest action in the world. But I knew that no one else would believe me, that going to family and friends would just get my fears dismissed. To them, I would be the potentially crazy one.

Hermit99 sent me an out of the way address to meet him at, an empty warehouse on the outskirts of town.

It was every bit as dodgy as I thought it might be as I walked into the cramped, abandoned space filled with packing crates. Through the rays of sunlight that streamed in from the rafters, I saw a decrepit figure crouched over a laptop. That had to be him.

“You—you’re Hugo, right?” he snapped at me, looking up from his charging laptop. “I’m Leeroy. You shut the door behind you, right?”

I nodded, starting to wonder if this was a bad idea.

“Show me your letter!” he barked in a panic. He practically snatched it out of my hands, skimming it over like someone who had spent many hours doing the same before.

“Dude, what gives?” I asked in frustration. “Why don’t you tell me what the hell is happening to us? Why am I being drafted by some weird country that I have nothing to do with?”

He looked at me incredulously.

“Nothing to do with? If they sent you this draft letter, then you’re a distant descendant of a being that was. That makes you a citizen, in their eyes. Like me.”

“So, you’re a citizen of this place too, then” I ask, trying to wrap my head around the idea that one of my ancestors was an interdimensional being.

“Yes. Unlike most descendants, my family always knew we had a drop of Extorvis blood. I dedicated years to trying to research that realm. And then my letter came in the mail…”

Leeroy trailed off for a moment before startling out of it and continuing.

“Extorvis exists in another dimension. From what I’ve learned about it, it’s…not like Earth. It’s vast, and dark, and brutal. Conflict between civilisations in that plane is constant. Wars there are massive in scale, comprising millions upon millions of beings battling with ancient weapons for years. Death there takes…longer.”

“When things there get really bad, they recruit from their pool on Earth. Ergo, us.”

My tension growing at what he just told me, I decided to speed things along.

“Okay, gotcha, we’re both in the firing line for some spectral war in hell. So how do we get out of it?”

Leeroy flipped my letter over and pointed at the fine print on the other side. 

*“Persons due to report may be disqualified from service due to inhibiting injury or active service in a separate military.”*

Injury? Were we really about to start giving each other bone spurs? It seemed like it. 

“I need someone to torture me, so badly that I’m deemed unfit for active duty” he said, gesturing to an array of construction tools on the bench next to him. “My draft date was yesterday and I’m overdue—we need to act quick!”

I picked up a bolt cutter and tried steeling myself up to what I was about to do.

Before I could go any further, however, a whirling wind knocked it out of my hands. Almost on cue, shadowy, humanoid figures began appearing throughout the warehouse. Everything he said was right. Leeroy’s time had run out.

Petrified, I ducked behind a crate. From there, I witnessed it. The vague, darkened beings grabbing Leeroy’s screaming frame, hauling him to his feet and vanishing, undoubtedly back to whatever incomprehensible punishment awaited him in Extorvia. What’s worse is they’d waited to detain him until I was there, to show me firsthand the consequences of desertion.

I sat there for hours in the empty warehouse, alone and thinking. There was no way I would be able to injure myself badly enough to be excluded from the draft. Which meant I had only one other option remaining.

That day, I returned home and enlisted in the Australian army.

It took several weeks for the process to go through and my confirmation to return to me. I waited with bated breath, every day expecting those shadowy soldiers to appear in my dorm room and take me away. But, two days before my drafting date, there came that miracle letter.

Another government letter telling me I was to be a soldier. But this time, a welcome mercy instead of a death sentence.

My drafting date came and passed without incident as I prepared, and departed for, military training at the bootcamp.

As per the drafting notice, I couldn’t be conscripted if I was an active member of another nation’s military. All this time I had hated the thought of serving my country, and in the end, it had been the loophole that saved me. 

Truth be told, serving in my human military over the following changed my attitude about war here on Earth. It gave me purpose, discipline and focus that perhaps I had lacked before. The people I met were friendly and loyal, and I developed bonds with them that ran deep. I was grateful to be able to serve in this mortal realm instead of the demonic Extorvis one.

After several years of contented service, my leg was eventually injured in an IED bombing. Thankfully, I didn’t lose my ability to walk, but the injury was bad enough for me to be honorably discharged. I returned home a physically changed, but mentally improved, man.

And that’s when another conscription letter came along from Extorvis. I’d considered the possibility of this.

I hadn’t considered that the appeal letter I sent them—on account of my injured leg—would be rejected. I am still expected to report for active duty in Extorvis in two months. According to the appeal letter, I hadn’t read the fine print about disqualifying injuries.

Finally, I understand why Leeroy had specifically wanted me to torture him instead of just cripple him. He’d wanted me to injure his *soul*, not his flesh.

Wars in Extorvis aren’t fought with soldiers’ bodies. They’re fought with souls.
