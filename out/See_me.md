1 week. It's been 1 whole week since thing's have changed again in my life. Not a good change, mind you, but a terrifying one. Either something is wrong in this house or something is wrong with me. Being a lone 24 year old man, living alone, no girlfriend or friends, no family except for a brother. I've been on my own since dad passed a few months ago. My only sibling living all the way in florida. We havent talked since dad died. We were never really close anyways. But my pleas for his help in my situation were ignored. No text back and no returned calls, he's all I had in this world who could listen and hear me. But i knew he wanted nothing to do with me. 

I truly believe he blames me for what happened to dad. I know I was supposed to be home that night after work. Supposed to be there with him. But I wasn't. I went to the cemetery that night, and stayed there for hours. Until I got a call that woke me up from a heavy drunk induced sleep. My brother calling me crying, and clearly very upset.

"Where are you michael!?" 

I still remember the pain in my eardrums from his loud words. Once my eyes adjusted, I seen the sun rising up in the horizon, faintly greeting the land. Before I could respond, he spoke again.

"Dads dead. He burned up in a fire at your guys house. Why weren't you there? You know he can't stay alone there. What the FUCK were you doing?" He brokenly said.

His cries hurt, but the realization of what happened, made me instantly feel frozen, and it was as is I felt the burn as well. Choked up, tears swelled in my eyes. 

"I... I don't understand... what happened?"

"That old dumb fucking dog knocked over the kerosene heater, The mutt got excited from something apparently, causing the fire."

"How.. how do you know this?"

"Fire Marshall said there was no other way for it fall over like that, dad definitely didn't do it, since he's bed ridden, now answer me, where were you? Where are you now?"

His voice calming a bit.

"I'm at the cemetary."
 I managed to choke out, feeling everything hit me at once.

"You mother fucker, this is your fault. This is because of YOU, it's all gone, the entire house is gone. All because you can't seem to let go, you piece of shit, I bet your hungover right now too, am I right?"

I didn't respond
He was right

"Big surprise, I'm coming up there, don't worry about shit on this, I'll take care of all the arrangements you pathetic drunk." 

His voice cracked then he exhaled a heartbroken sigh, sniffling as well. 

Then the line went dead.
I dropped my phone to the ground, tears now streaming down my face, the birds sang and the wind gently brushed my face. Like it was trying to console me. Feeling a cold damp spot, I looked down and seen a piss stain on my crotch. Then I looked over to my left, a couple feet away was a 5th of whiskey with a few drinks still present inside. So I picked it up, and slammed it. Then trudged to my car.


Every night since that horrible morning was a deep cry session, every night. Working and drinking, even more now than ever, was all I did. The pain and tears seemed to combine and smudge together like painting a broken picture in the rain. A picture of death. A canvas of grief and sorrow, that no matter how hard I tried to color light and happiness, it was always washed away.

 Sure being a crumbling shell of a human, all alone, all the time, had it's own incentive, but when I saw it for the first time, I was sure it meant something. But now I don't know anymore. Maybe I'm just losing it. Maybe I'm just being messed with. Or maybe, it was something meant to be. Either way, my heart stopped everytime it occured. And there's nothing I can do.

Unless.

I need someone here to witness this as I do, my brother, who gave zero shits, I couldn't rely on him, he's too far away anyways, so I need someone else, a stranger I guess. So I picked up my phone and ordered a pizza from my local pizza place. I was getting hungry anyways. And so I waited at the front door, with my back turned to the rest of the house. 


Knock, knock, knock 

Well they're here. I thought to myself, I was still standing in front of the door, and waited until he knocked once more. And when he did I opened the door, and was greeted with a smile from the delivery guy. 

"Hello sir, how are you doing?"

I stepped back, and opened the door wide, with bloodshot eyes and a clenched jaw, I invited him inside. 

"Fine" 

I spurted out, sounding a little weak, as my back still faced the rest of the house. 

thats good he said

"Alright that will be 20.95$"

As I grabbed my wallet from my back pocket, I opened it and stopped. Then looked up at him and said,

"Do you see it?"

The pizza guy was taken back, and asked

"Excuse me?"

"You see it right?"

He chuckled and said

"I'm not sure what you mean, 20.95$ please."

"Look behind me, in the window, you see it don't you?"

He flashed a weird chuckle and leaned his head to the side as he acted confused.

"Uhh no, I don't see nothing."

I clenched the two 20 dollars bills now in my hand, and looked up at him my eyes swelling up again, he looked back, fear in his eyes.

"Please you have to see it. You have to, please look again, look harder..."

Tear drops splashed on the old ragged bills, while my hands started shaking.

"Listen man, I don't have time for this shit, just pay me so I can g..."

He stopped talking, and when I seen his eyes they reminded me of my own when I first saw it, like a hollow mannequin, he stared hard right behind my shoulder. The once friendly face turned askew. And he quickly snatched the money from me, while shoving the pizza into my arms. 

"Wait!

I cried out as he hurried out of the door. Following him onto the sidewalk.

"Come back! Please!, you saw it right?"

He ignored 

Then jumped in his car and drove away.

Burning his tires as he sped away down the twilight lit streets

He saw it
I know he did

While he turned the corner down the street, I heard his car Rev up even more and speed away

Now, me standing alone, on the sidewalk it went silent. Even the evening night bugs ceased to chirp. My back still to the house, The windows, the doors, the walls, the roof, the floor, the foundation, the chimney, the swarm of bats overhead I heard squeaking. Everything. Loomed on my back like a giant shadow. Heavy. Dark. and still. So I turned around. And there it was. In the front door window. Clear as crystal. With dark enveloping it slowly, she was there. Crying. I followed suit, and dropped the pizza on the ground, sweat dripping off the tips of my fingers. And just at that moment, I knew why. My phone in my pocket rang loud, and I as scrambled to grasp it with a slippery touch, I answered. It was my brother. And he said

"Michael..."

While sobbing

"Moms gone, she's gone mike."
