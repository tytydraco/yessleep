When Ellie vanished, she was 19. My best friend’s sister, full of fire and dreams too big for our small town, left for Europe to become a model. 

Her messages stopped after a month. Search efforts went cold. Life moved on, as it does, leaving her absence like a scar.

The whole town and family had their theories—runaway, fresh start, maybe something worse—but no answers. My best friend drowned himself in denial, while her parents faded, shrinking under the weight of not knowing. For everyone else, she became a ghost.

I never forgot her, though. Not her laugh, not the way her eyes lit up when she talked about Paris. That’s why, years later, the moment I saw her, I knew.

It started on a sleepless night, rabbit-holing through the backroads of the web.

A click here, a link there, until I landed on a grainy video titled *‘Untitled Performance #87.’* 

The thumbnail—a dimly lit room, a figure bathed in shadow—piqued my morbid curiosity. The video began with a haunting, discordant melody, evoking the eerie charm of 1930s animations.

Then, she appeared.

Ellie.

At first, I wasn’t sure. Her hair was matted, her skin pale, almost translucent under the harsh spotlight. But her eyes—vacant, drugged, yet unmistakably hers—stared straight into the camera.

Her body moved, jerky and unnatural, like a marionette. It took me a moment to understand why. 

Thin, glistening wires snaked from her limbs, embedded deep into her flesh, pulling her into grotesque, doll-like poses. Her arms bent backward with a sickening grace, her legs extended far beyond any human limit.

I froze, bile rising in my throat, unable to look away.

A shadow shifted at the edge of the frame—her puppeteer. The wires jerked, and Ellie collapsed to her knees. The camera zoomed in as her mouth opened.

A scream.

Or it should have been.

Instead, there was a faint, metallic whir. Machinery hidden beneath her skin clicked and churned, her mouth forming a silent cry as the performance dragged on.

At first, I wanted to pause the video, but... I just couldn’t. 

Details I didn’t want to see became horrifyingly clear: the jagged scars where the wires pierced her wrists, the way her fingers trembled, still trying to resist.

Her eyes met mine—or maybe just the camera’s lens—and for a moment, I saw something behind the emptiness. 

Recognition? 

A plea? 

I didn’t know.

The video cut abruptly to black, leaving only a single frame: a close-up of Ellie’s face, her lips stitched into a grotesque imitation of a smile, the title “Property of the Artisan” stamped in blood-red letters.

My heart pounded as I scrambled to trace the site, but it vanished like smoke. Gone.

I spent days combing through forums, tracing the video’s breadcrumbs. The only clue I found was a whispered name: *The Artisan.* 

A rumor, they said. „An ARG”. But I know what I saw.

Ellie is still out there, trapped in a living nightmare, her body no longer her own. 

And I will find her.

Even if it kills me...
