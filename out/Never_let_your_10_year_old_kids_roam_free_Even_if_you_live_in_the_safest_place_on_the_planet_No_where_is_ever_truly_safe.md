On a mild, dark mid-November night in 2002, 3 of my closest friends and I attended our local scout group. To provide some context. We resided in a very middle-class, rural, suburban village on the outskirts of a major British city. I can't stress how quiet and safe our peaceful dwelling was; we were all 10 years old, and even then, our parents seldom worried about us being out in the dark, as long as we were back at a reasonable time.

 It was me, Tom, Dave and Harry. Back then, we were inseparable, constantly around each other's houses, and we all partook in the same extracurricular activities, the scouts being one of them. 

We arrived at the scout hut at 7:30p.m., our headquarters. We joined the rest of our group, who'd already arrived. We mingled for a while, and then a few minutes later, the scout leader came and enthusiastically greeted us all. He began to explain tonight's activity. As it was a clear night, he wanted us to split into teams of 4 and collect various items in a scavenger hunt. 

Naturally, we joined forces. Tom was grinning as he brought a new, powerful, expensive torch his parents lent him for that night.
 "This is perfect," he remarked. A few moments later, he'd beckoned us outside and demonstrated the range of the powerful beam, illuminating the night sky, a car parked 50 or so yards away lit up in bright visibility. We were all naturally jealous but excited about the harmless mischief we could get up to while on our hunt.

The rest of the scout group joined us outside as our scout leader asked us to return at half 8. We were given a list of items to acquire. I am trying to remember exactly what was on the list, but all of them seemed easy for a 10-year-old to obtain. The remaining teams split off and ventured in different directions; we naturally were the last to leave. The leader shooed us along. "Come on, boys, there's a prize for the group who can collect the most items; you've got less than an hour!". Taking this as a sign to hurry up, we gleefully embarked down the road towards the village. 

Our village was small; there was a small high street with 2 pubs, a convenience store, a salon, butchers and opticians. It all centred around a large church from the 16th century surrounded by a creepy cemetery. The basic blueprint for anyone familiar with rural British towns and villages. The roads surrounding the heart were narrow and winding, with some parts completely uninhabited, just woodland and no streetlights. 

For a short while, we harmlessly ambled around the village; it was quiet, just the chatter of the various groups of scouts searching for the items on their lists. Tom constantly flashed his torch into hard-to-see areas. A couple of cars drove past us on the high street as we approached the church. The voices of the other groups began to soften as we walked further away. "We'll be fine", Tom reassured us as we passed the last streetlight. Harry inquired whether we were bothered about collecting the items on our list, and we all agreed that we weren't; as long we collected a couple, we'd probably avoid any trouble. 

We had about half an hour before we were expected to return. We'd spent the last 10 minutes shining Tom's torch into the church's dark, stained-glass windows and the large, domineering gravestones surrounding us. Dave, the quiet one of the group, began to worry about getting into trouble for not participating. 

"Come on guys, let's go back towards the village, we shouldn't be here". 

We all scoffed at his apparent anxieties. 

"Fuck off, Dave", I replied, "let's go a little bit further along; there's a stream about 100 yards up that road". 

I pointed towards an eerily dark road in the distance, with giant, looming oak trees aligning each side. In my mind, I pondered and fantasised about the potential treasures we might find using Tom's torch. Dave looked worried, but Harry and Tom readily agreed with my daring plan; Dave, with no other choice, reluctantly agreed, and off we went.

I started to regret my idea almost immediately; there was no footpath, and the branches drooped over us ominously, like they were ready to reach out and grab us at any moment. Tom led the way confidently with his torch whilst we shuffled behind. Although we could see clearly before us, the road appeared to lead us straight into the abyss. It was like we were walking blindly into a dark tunnel without knowing the potential consequences that might await us. 

And then, as my fears expected, the sound of a car revving in the distance was obviously driving towards us. Immediately, two large headlights came into view and then, without warning, it slammed on its brakes. Stopping bang next to Tom, who was a couple of yards ahead of us. He instantaneously turned off his torch and froze. We nervously moved towards him. The headlights dimmed, and we were in complete darkness. We couldn't see into the windows, and for a split second, there was no sound. It was a silver hatchback, a small car ordinary for young people at that time to drive. 

My heart was pumping, and the apparent fear quickly engulfed me. I glanced around and noticed an identical look of dread on my friend's faces. The driver and passenger doors opened simultaneously, and two prominent figures slowly emerged. The passenger walked around the back of the car to join the driver. They were both men in their mid to late 20s, and a wiry, sinister smile greeted us on both of them as they edged towards us. I can't remember much about their appearances, but the passenger's smile glinted due to his possession of a gold tooth.

We all froze. Our village was so small, so we were familiar with our neighbours; we'd never seen these men before. 

"Evening, boys", 
the driver remarked with a foreboding chuckle. His eyes fixated on Tom's torch.
"Nice bit of kit that, mate; where'd you get it from?" 
His eyes moved upwards; he was now looking straight down at Tom. The passenger suddenly reached forward ferociously and snatched the torch out of his hand. "Don't worry, we're both policemen". They both glanced at each other and, in unison, let out a lip-curling snigger. "yeah, yeah, Policemen". The passenger threw the torch into the car and began to inspect us all, still grinning that evil grin.

 "It's not really safe, is it?" he continued, "does anyone know you're out here?" 
His smile became increasingly sinister. Dave immediately piped up nervously, "Yes. Yes, they do; we're just going back into the village, actually." The driver turned to us, "Do you want us to give you a lift back?" his voice was now more authoritative; the smile had vanished. "I think it would be wise" he continued.

 "No, No, Dave replied." His voice was shaky but somewhat confident; we were still frozen. As Dave was about to continue his ramble, the passenger all of a sudden sternly interjected, 

"Shut the fuck up". 

Panic took over. Both of them suddenly made a beeline and grabbed Tom by his arms. They pulled him towards the car, and he was screaming, telling them to let go,

 "Please, please let me go." "I haven't done anything". We instinctively grabbed him, trying to pull him away, but it was useless. They bundled him into the front seat, and the passenger swiftly pushed him into the passenger side. Tom was in hysterics, "please help me!" he cried. We didn't know what to do. We needed to get back asap. The car was a small grey hatchback; we could recognise it, see their faces, point them out, and provide a description to the Police. I didn't want to leave Tom, but we needed to get help. We were stuck. Then, out of nowhere, Harry yelled, "RUN!" we instinctively ran in the opposite direction towards the village, leaving Tom behind, crying and pleading for help. 

Adrenaline kicked in as we sprinted down the road in complete darkness. We heard the sound of loud footsteps running behind us, all too scared to look back. I suddenly heard a loud, screeching cry as we neared the church. The footsteps behind us had stopped. I glanced around and noticed it was just me and Dave. Harry's voice was behind us in the darkness, screaming. They'd got him. "FUCK FUCK FUCK" I cried. Dave looked at me, tears streaming down his eyes. Fear had now left me, and for the first time in my life, survival mode had kicked in. "We've got to get the fuck out of here, Dave" I screamed. Harry's cries became more muffled. Then FLASH. The headlights on the car immediately lit up the whole road. The car began to start. "Dave", I bellowed, "Fucking run". We sprinted as fast as possible, puffing and wheezing; we returned to the village. No one was around except a couple outside the pub smoking a cigarette. Both of us, in tears, collapsed at their feet. 

"What the hell going on?" the man cried. "Are you ok?". We frantically scrambled to our feet as more and more patrons poured out of the pub. "Silver car, chasing us", I panted frantically. Dave crying uncontrollably next to me, his sobs preventing him from saying anything at all coherent. For the first time that night, I knew I was safe. We were ushered into the bustling pub's warm cosiness, and the loving landlady gave us each a warm cup of hot chocolate. Our parents arrived immediately, alongside Harry and Tom's parents. A group of male pub-goers had formed a vigilante group just prior and scoured the village from top to bottom, with no sign of my friends and the sinister car that had stopped to greet us.

Obviously, the Police tried their best; there were national appeals all throughout the UK, and it was headline news. Two white, middle-class 10-year-olds were abducted in a seemingly quiet village. But to no luck. The case is still a mystery. You might watch a documentary on it occasionally if you watch British TV.

We never saw them again.

A few months later, my parents moved us to Canada; they didn't feel safe and felt the events were too damaging for me to relive in the village we then called home. 

I'm 31 now. I have no children, and the events have made it difficult for me to contemplate, but my partner is great and supportive and understands my anxieties. Anxieties, copious therapy, and SSRIs have yet to ease. I've got Dave on some social media, but I have no idea what he's doing now. We lost contact after the move. From his Instagram posts, he has a wife and child and seems to be doing ok. But you can never really tell.

I blame myself for my stupid idea to go exploring. I wish we had returned and done the task we were asked to do.

Tom and Harry. I'm sorry.
