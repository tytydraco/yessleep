It’s right in front of me. Its teeth have cracks with blood seeping out. Clotted up. Its eyes have no iris. They are black but they just changed to blue. No red. I can’t make any sense of it. Has four legs. It's like a dog or a wolf. But its legs are warped. They aren’t all the same. Its underside… dear God I am going to be sick. It's somewhat tore open. I can see a part of its intestine hanging out of it. Pulsating. 

&#x200B;

I am in my home’s closet right now. Need to keep a track of this. I will live. I will live. I will live. I will-It just… it took its claw… and moved it into through its tear on its the underside. The claw… moved past the intestine… so much puss fell on the carpet. It’s tearing through it. It’s… it’s looking at me. It knows where I am. And it’s still moving it’s claw within itself. I can see its skin bulge. A toothy grin is there. It’s jutting its head. As if it can’t seem to rein in its emotion. Pain and joy. The green puss has went through my floor.

&#x200B;

It just stopped moving its claw within. The claw is out now… it’s red. Like iron from a crucible. Glowing. Little specks are about it. Specks to those around a campfire. I am glad. Finally a somewhat pleasant, let alone beautiful- it’s growling. Still looking at me. I…

&#x200B;

It jumped straight through the hole in the floor it created, and dug deep with its claw. Created magma of sorts. Its gone.

&#x200B;

Driving now. I am driving away from this evil. At a stoplight.

&#x200B;

At my friend’s. She doesn’t believe me. I told her she could see my place. She doesn’t believe. I began to cry. She doesn’t believe me. I asked why. She said she can’t right now- I heard a howl from her basement.

&#x200B;

She is down there. She is my best friend.

&#x200B;

I see her with the beast. She is gently petting it. I am in pain. Trying type out everything. She laughs. People must know. She- she said something. Oh god. “Time is done. Eat my limbs please. Thank you again.”

&#x200B;

It did. She was smiling. Her eyes quickly matched mine. “This is how I will achieve immortality. They want slaves of only minds and hearts. No need for us to do work. The beasts handle that. They are wise though. They can make us wise like them.” As she finished the sentence the dog picked her up by the neck. With her torso dangling down. Its teeth seemed to have cauterized.

&#x200B;

“I am doing you a favor. Find somebody else like you and me. You have a year to decide. If you say no, which I doubt, and I really wish you won’t, then everything here will leave you alone. Me. The beast. Others. If you do, you will undergo what you saw here-“

&#x200B;

The beast clamped down on her neck and relaxed again. It broke her vocal cords. 

&#x200B;

She kept smiling at me. Eyes wide with joy. The dog did the same with the claw. But before it started digging, it took another normal claw, grabbed her torso, and placed her within it, through its underside tear. Then it came up to me. It took its crucible claw up too. I was frozen. It came close to me. Could see the saliva drip from it mouth. I heard muffled screams from its insides. It grabbed my

&#x200B;

It branded my hand. Then it dug. Still here in her basement.
