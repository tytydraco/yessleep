I always liked to die. Yeah, you know what I mean. But no matter I try it all just all goes to nothing. Hang myself, I still have air. Strike myself with a knife, I don't bleed. It kept on happening like this until I discovered I was immortal. Now, before you guys could grill me that I was a witch, I swear I am a Christian, I don't practice witchcraft and never will be. It all happened behind the curtain. Let me explain.

I've been depressed my whole life. The first time I tried to die, it didn't go pretty well. I was 9 years old and I was biking, when I got the sudden idea to commit suicide by falling off a cliff. However, I landed in a tree instead of meeting my end. My dad saw me and said, "Zane! Thank goodness you survived falling."

5 years later (this year), when I discussed my suicidal thoughts to my smoking boyfriend, he said, "Don't do anything stupid". I jumped off a , but landed in the pool instead of a hard floor. You should be dead if you were having hypothermia, but it didn't happen. Everyone at the pool was making fun of me and taking pictures, and I became the sensation of derision when I appeared in the front page of the Harrisburg Newsletter.

Next, I faked a death penalty crime, which of course, sent me to the electric room. However, I survived the shock. Guillotine (I live in a French diaspora district), didn't surpass the skin. And lethal injection, these acted like placebo. Eventually, they took me to the hospital where I was studied by doctors. It was when the doctors proved me immortal.

The next week, things got weird when I went to my school. A crowd surrounded me and began trying to make "supplications" to me, as if I was some god. Apparently the news of my immortality reached the school. Even the teachers were getting into the act. When I got home, I lashed out at my Reimu Hakurei plushie by squishing it with my fist before aiming a shotgun to my face. "This wasn't real this wasn't real" were my last words. However, the bullet bounced like my head was made of metal. But at the same time, I heard a knock on the door and a bunch of doctors swarmed in and kidnapped me from my house. They were going to do more tests. But this time, I survived.

A day after I was discharged, I was sitting on my computer watching a Keanu Reeves audition for a movie. However, the peace didn't last long. I saw a letter in my doorstep after watching, which was from a part of the United States government called the United States Department of Metaphysical Sciences. No, not the fictional Minecraft kind. It was a real letter addressed with my name and address. I wouldn't show you because you guys, the con guys, could just come and get me. I just have to say I live in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

I opened it expecting for a trap. I saw the contents of the letter, which was about my immortality. Turns out the doctors of Harrisburg Hospital went and sent it to the higher ups of the government. I was scared that it wouldn't be a secret any longer. It would be a secret hidden with the power of judicial law. What was my choice? Run away. These fools would just come and get me.

I packed almost everything into a car before hightailing it off. Under the floorboards I hid my tuition fee, and went to the hospital to pronounce me dead. Until somebody snitched.

"I thought you are immortal!" he said. "I'm using it to gain my popularity." 

When I came back to the car I forgot my Reimu Hakurei plushie. However, it was too late. The DMS were already closing in, and they chased me through the highways and through states like O.J. Simpson before I came to a stop in Boston. It was 1.6 days since I departed from Harrisburg. It was winter and I was severely freezing. 

I drunk a few shots of alcohol in a bar before going to a horse bar and going to Maine. In fact, I was going to run from the DMS not in the United States but in Canada as well. Also, I had to worry about my hunger and energy, meaning that I had to steal from other people. And you know that it's time to fight back.
