Question: If the love of your life were dead, how far would you go to see them again? Break the law? Sacrifice yourself? Kill? Most of you, I’m sure, would do at least two of the above.

Before I continue, I want to be clear: I don’t want judgment. Any one of you would go to the end of the earth to see the person you loved one last time.

I didn’t believe in ghosts, an afterlife, or any of that until Emma happened. The words that hissed from her mouth, “I can help you talk to Hannah again,” bounced around my skull as I sat behind my steering wheel, frozen, trying to decide what to do next.

And those words are what pushed me to go back inside the ER and talk to her. As soon as I walked back in, I heard someone faintly humming the song Frère Jacques. I looked around and no one was humming. No one was even looking in my direction. Still, the tune threaded through my head, faint and off-key, like it was being played on a broken music box. 

It hit me — I was hearing it in my head. Out of context this specific song might not mean anything to you but it’s the song that Hannah’s dad used to sing to her when she was a baby. 

I kept on further into the ER. The closer I got to Emma’s room, the louder the humming got in my head, taunting me. 

I turned the corner into her room and Emma’s eyes met mine. She was sitting comfortably upright, staring at me. “Ryan’s planning on burning the jacket. He’s buying lighter fluid right now,” she said in that gruff voice that wasn’t hers.

“How do you know that?” I asked.

My phone rang, no number, no name, a blank screen. but it was ringing. “Answer it,” Emma instructed.

I picked up and Emma was talking to Ryan on the other end. I don’t know how, she was sitting there in bed staring at me, her mouth not moving, but they were talking.

I shouted into the phone, demanding Ryan tell me where he was. “He can’t hear you,” she said as their conversation continued through the phone. “Be quiet and listen,” she said. 

“Drop the lighter fluid,” I heard her say to Ryan. 

“Why should I listen to you?” He pushed back.

A deep, unsettling laughter rose through the other end of the phone. The tone had completely shifted into the voice of the Old Man. “If you burn the jacket, Emma burns.”

Ryan went quiet, I could only hear him faintly breathing on the other end. “Who are you?” he said weakly. Then the phone cut out.

“He won’t try and burn it now,” Emma said with a sick smirk.

I stood there, questions I wanted to ask on the tip of my tongue. But I was terrified of the answers. I asked anyway.

One: Where is the jacket from? Two: What do you mean I’ll talk to Hannah again?

“It’s from a thrift store,” Emma said “Hidden Gems. Not far from here.” 

Then she leaned forward, the restraints binding her to the bed taut, catching her against her own weight. “Put the jacket on, don’t fight it,” she rasped, “and you’ll see her again.” She stayed in place, her stare pinned me where I stood. 

The sterile white lights above flickered wildly. The heart monitor crackled and screamed static. In between the burst of lights I saw Emma changing. 

One moment, Emma. The next, an Old Man. His skin looked wet, riddled with gooey open sores. Folds of flesh hung loose on his face, like a snake shedding its skin. She was switching back and forth with every flicker of the lights until it stopped and the room went dark.

There was a few moments of silence until I realized someone was right next to me, breathing in my ear. Their hot breath brushing my face. I jumped and the lights came back on. Emma was in the bed, her restraints still on. I knew what I had to do.

—

The overhead bell rang out in the otherwise impossibly quiet thrift store when I walked in. It was empty, no one in sight. “Hello?” I called out. I took a few steps inside when I heard whispering. I couldn’t make out what was being said or where it was coming from, but I heard talking. “Hello?” I called again. 

I could feel someone watching me. I spun around, still no one. 

That’s when I heard another whisper. It was like I was trying to understand a conversation being carried through the wind. 

The scent of stale mildew hung in the air as I walked even further into the store. I stopped when I noticed a tag hanging from a pair of shoes. Written in black sharpie on the tag: “William: 10/21/21”. 

It was at that moment that something moved on the clothing rack across from me. I caught a glimpse of what looked like a shadow. 

“Can I help you?” A voice said. I jumped and turned. A lady stood behind the front counter where no one had been moments before. It was odd, unsettling, but she was smiling at me and looked pleasant enough.

I needed answers, so I came up with the best story I could. I told her that Emma had come in the other day, that she had to gone to the hospital because there was something on the jacket that had made her sick. 

“Oh,” she said. She asked me my name and introduced herself as Agatha. 

“Do you remember selling it?” I asked. 

“A jacket made her sick?” She said skeptically. “Yes,” I confirmed. She clearly didn’t believe what I was saying.

She grabbed a long overcoat off of a nearby rack and walked over to me. “That sounds pretty unbelievable if you ask me.” Without hesitation, she draped the heavy coat over my shoulders. “Feel sick yet?” She teased.

I felt crazy. But I knew I wasn’t. I knew what I had seen. 

Then, I felt the overcoat tighten around my shoulders, a faint vibration across my chest. Agatha’s expression changed. Her lip curled, exposing brown rotting teeth, something I hadn’t noticed before.

The thrift store lights dimmed, their steady hum slipping into a low, pulsing rhythm, like a heartbeat echoing through the walls. 

Before I could even ask what was happening, the jacket got tighter. It felt like cling wrap around my torso. It felt like it was writhing.

It began to burn, my skin was being grated raw. I screamed out for help, but Agatha didn’t move. She just watched me. 

I blinked and the store was gone. In its place: a narrow hallway, walls yellowed and peeling. I had been transported somewhere, somehow. 

I heard faint cries nearby. I started toward the sound. I thought to myself, *I should stop*. But my legs wouldn’t obey. My mind screamed to stop, but my body moved ahead. It was as though my body and mind were disconnected. I was like a puppet on a string.

I passed a mirror, I caught my reflection. My stomach dropped. It wasn’t me I was looking at but someone else, a man I didn’t recognize. The only thing I did recognize about him was that he was wearing the overcoat Agatha had put on me.

I continued on against my own will,  turned the corner where the cries were coming from and froze.

A man was standing over a woman, his hands clenched around a butchers knife. He brought it down again and again into her chest, the sound dull and wet, like a shovel striking mud.

I wanted to scream for help, to run, but I couldn’t. My feet were rooted to the spot.

Then the man stopped and lifted his head. No face. Just smooth featureless skin where features should have been, like someone had erased them. Even without eyes, I could feel him staring at me.

I stumbled back, trying to get away. But before I even had a chance, he was right on top of me. He swung the knife upwards, driving it into my jaw. I felt a hot rush of pain and shock.

The lights flickered and I was suddenly back in the thrift store, trembling on the ground as I ripped the overcoat off. I felt an intense sting as I yanked it away from my body. 

Agatha stared down at me. “So the jacket made her sick?” she mocked. 

I frantically felt around my jaw, feeling for knife wound. 

“That death wasn’t yours,” Agatha said. She picked the overcoat off the ground and read from the white sales tag. “It was Michael’s.” She turned the tag around for me to see, “Michael: 06/21/71”

“What was that? What’s happening?” I demanded.

“Thank God you got it off in time, otherwise it would’ve bound itself to you,” Agatha said with a smirk. A fierce burn ran across my chest. I lifted up my shirt and my skin was raw in several places across my torso. 

“These clothes need a new home. I’m here to facilitate a way for them to live on.” She continued, “None of them are priced. They're tagged with names and dates. Just as Emma’s jacket was.” A chill washed over me. 

I asked her why this was all happening. 

“Because it does. It doesn’t have to involve you. But I think you want it to.” 

Maybe I didn’t need Emma’s jacket, maybe I just needed Agatha. So I asked. “Can you help me see Hannah again?”

“No,” she said. 

“But the Old Man told me he could,” I said.  

“Well then that’s the deal he made with you. I don’t make the decisions, I balance the books.”

Her eyes stayed fixed on me, like she was staring into my very being. I could feel her inside my head, swimming around my thoughts. It felt like a rush of ice water in my skull. 

“If you want to know who’s responsible for her death, he can show you that too.”

This is hard for me to talk about. But I should tell you this so you fully understand, because it’s what has led me to where I am now. Hannah was killed in a hit and run. She went for a jog and never came back. They don’t know who. They never found the car. Whoever did it got away with murder, and this could be my chance to find them.

That’s when my phone rang. No number, no name, but it was ringing. I answered and Frère Jacques was being hummed on the other end. “Ryan’s at home now,” The Old Man’s craggy voice whispered. He gave me the address. “Go. Before it’s too late.”

And I did. 

I can’t tell you the rest of what happened. Not on here. But what I can say is that none of this is my fault. It was self defense. And everything I’ve done, everything I’m going to do, is for Hannah. 

What I will tell you is this: I have the jacket now.
