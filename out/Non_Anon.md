Me and Beck hid in the closet, eyes shut. The sound of footsteps, defeaning, as we covered our mouth, we heard the closet door creak, thinking, *what if*, in another life, we didn't have to live through this nightmare. The door opened, *and then..*

-January 5th 2017- 

I'm just a *normal 14 year old guy*, getting ready for school. I went into the bathroom, washed my face and brushed my teeth. My older sister Beck who is 15 shouted that the bus had arrived so I just finished up, ran into the living room and then.. I *tripped on the carpet and hit my head*. I looked up and saw my crush, *Love*, urging me **"Get up! Get up!"** and I blinked and my sister was there again, **"Get up now Joe!"** I got back to my senses and stood up and went outside and on the bus.

&#x200B;

We arrived and I went into the 9th grade classroom waiting for the teacher to arrive. My phone buzzed in my pocket. I got a text from an anonymous account **"I'm watching you."** 

What the fuck was this? Who is this? **"I don't care."**, I texted sarcastically. 

**"You should. Run away as fast as you can."** The person texted. Now I started getting creeped off, so before the teacher arrived, I walked into the bathroom. I went into one of the stalls, and sat. **"Who the hell are you?"** I texted.

**"Just wait and see."** they texted. Now I was actually scared. Then, the bell rang. I went into chemistry and forgot about the whole ordeal. **"Open page 46 class, we need to get the work done otherwise it will be homework."** *Oh shit*, not homework... I got to work and was confused about one of the questions, **"Teacher I need help!"** I yelled, and she helped me, but then, she whispered in my ear **"I'm watching you, Joe."** the fuck? what did she mean by that? I remembered the texts. and thought that there's no way it could be her. 

Fast forward a couple hours, school finished, me and beck got on the bus and arrived home. I threw my bag on the floor and took off my socks and threw them on the floor. Layed in bed from exhaustion. Just grabbed my phone and scrolled on instagram. Then I saw a new post from the anonymous account. It was a picture of me in my room, captioned **"Hello, you."** I jolted from my bed, and that same second, I got a text from them. **"I know you like Love, and if you don't do what I tell you, I'm gonna expose you to the whole school."** I freaked out and texted **"Okay what the hell do you want?!"** 

&#x200B;

*The* ***doorbell*** *rung.*

**"Open up."** they said.

I opened the door before Beck got a chance to.

It was a package.

Beck came, **"What's this?"**

**"Something I ordered."** I said.

**"Just cause mom and dad are away for this week means you can order whatever you want without permission?"** She said.

**"It's none of your business"** I said and went in my room.

I opened the box, it was a bloody finger, literally. It was a finger covered in blood, I gasped and my stomach dropped. I ran to my bathroom and puked. I stood there for a good 10 minutes before I convinced myself it was probably a fake and it's some sort of prank.

I went on my phone, avoiding the shitty smell coming from the box.

**"what the fuck did you send me?"** I texted, 

**"Won't you spare me some indignity? you know what to do."** They said

**"NO I don't know what to do with this finger which smells like ass and is probably fake, so tell me now."** I said.

**"drop it off at Love's house."** they said

**" I don't give a fucking shit! I'm not doing this. I'm 14 you** ***psycho!*** **YOU are fucking crazy i'm turning you in."** I replied.

**"You might not wanna do that."** he sent, attached a picture of my sister making out with her teacher.

What the fuck is going on? I ran to my sisters room and asked her **"Are you, or were you ever, doing something with the chemistry teacher!?"** 

**"ofcourse not!"** she said.

I showed her the picture and she stared in disbelief. **"Why the fuck are you taking pictures of me you creep?!"** she replied. **"Fuck you!"** I replied and slammed her door not knowing what to feel. My phone buzzed.

**"You have till 6PM"**

I had no option, he was gonna ruin my and my sisters reputation. I really didn't wanna do this but I kept telling myself **"it's fake. it's fake, it's fake. it's fake."** I walked over to Love's house, dropped the package, rang the doorbell, and ran for my life.  


**"Good boy, now, you won't be ready for tommorow's task."** he texted.

All of a sudden, mom called me. **"We're coming back into the neighbourhood, it's a tragedy!"** she was sobbing. **"Your aunt had been robbed and the robber shot and killed your uncle. he cut off her finger!"** I was fucking shocked and dropped my phone to the ground. **"Shit!"** I yelled. I picked up my phone, it was decimated. **"DOUBLE SHIT!"** I yelled. I walked back home with my broken phone and showed Beck. **"If you don't buy me a new phone before mom and dad come, I'll tell them about the thing with the teacher."** I said. **"Oh fuck off! I'll tell everyone about what I found under your bed."** She replied. Shit. Now how am I gonna get a new phone. I walked out of her room, accepting that I won't have a new phone 'til my birthday. And she seemed to be unfazed from my uncles death.. I really was grieving. but *maybe*, the phone cracking was a blessing in disguise. Now I didnt need to do the Anonymous person's shitty tasks. 

Mom and Dad arrived, it was 8:00 PM now and I was playing fortnite with my friends. 

**"Mom, dad.. I cracked my-"** 

**"yeah we know, Beck told us."** they said, "**we got you a new one on our way, which is** ***TEMPORARY*****."**

Thank god, it was iPhone 7. I put my SIM card in and had it setup, before going to bed.

**"Tommorow you'll be having school off to attend your Uncles funeral, okay Joe?"**

" **Okay mom! send my prayers, it's super sad.."**

I kept hearing dad bawling over his loss, because it was his brother.

I dozed off to sleep.

It was *another day huh,* but it's not another day. Uncle Adam just got killed by this monster following me. Why? WHY me? I'm just a normal 14 year old. Why use me to cover your crimes you imbecile? Anyway, We drove to the funeral and were in line, saying our speeches. After dad finished, I was last in line. After we finished, my phone vibrated. I tried to not be disrespectful so I secretly checked it without anyone seeing.

**"Look behind you, Don't say goodbye."** 

IT WAS  A GUY WITH A HACKER MASK POINTING A HANDGUN AT ME FROM AFAR!!! 

I tripped on a tablecloth and all the food fell everywhere,

I ran into the woods and heard gunshots..   


WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING? HOW DID HE GET MY NUMBER? WHO IS THIS? WHY ME? IS THIS A DREAM?

I ran and ran for what seemed like hours. Phone vibrated, Shit! 

**"I'm gonna frame you. Nobody is gonna believe you."**

I threw my phone on the ground and destroyed it. I ran South towards our neighbourhood. There was a power outage. I entered the neighbourhoods and ran through the homes and into mine. I locked all the doors and windows. I barricaded myself. A killer was on the loose, It was my fault, why didn't I just be a good boy and follow his orders? then, I froze in my place. I heard footsteps, I turned around and ran at the person behind me, they fell and went on top of them. **"Joe! Thank god you survived, it's me, Beck!"** I stopped, and hugged her. I was so relieved, all the fights we had, but now we came together and got emotional. Then, BOOM! The door swung open, Doctor Anonymous burst through and had kicked it open with his bare leg! We crawled on over to her bedroom.

**"This is going to be so much fun!"** He yelled.

Me and Beck hid in the closet, eyes shut. The sound of footsteps, defeaning, as we covered our mouth, we heard the closet door creak, thinking, what if, in another life, we didn't have to live through this nightmare. The door opened, and then..  
***A scream***, it wasn't becks. She jumped at him and beat him up, Both rolled over on the floor hitting each other, Dr. Anon with a gun, I froze and didn't know what to do. **"Run, Joe!"** she shouted, and I did. I ran for my life. I jumped out the window, because every other thing was locked, The window broke and I bled everywhere, pieces of glass everywhere. I heard gunshots, I ran into the distance and then Love shouted for me, "***Joe! Im so sorry, I heard about your Aunt, You won't believe me but-"*** 

***"Love, you need to get the fuck out. I'm serious."***

***"What's your problem Joe?"*** and then... a gunshot. Dr. Anon shot her. I was fueled with anger. But I couldnt do anything. I tried running but my leg was full of blood. ***"I loved you Joe."*** Love said. I tripped over a branch and told myself this is how it ends, and I wish it did. I watch the moon, and let it run my mood. Darkness was falling over. It was like a movie. Dr. Anon came up to me.

***"Haha,*** **i'm sorry."** he took off his mask. It was... *Dad.* **"What... Dad? Why... why would you do this..?"** 

&#x200B;

**"Im really sorry son, but, I just hated this life, I decided to just.. kill my brother, and take his wife's finger and blame it on you, no loose ends huh? The vacation thing was staged. Someone hit your mom with a car, she was in a hospital, and I decided this was the best time to commit the murders. But now, this is where it ends huh?"** *and he pointed the gun at me.* then... Love jumped at him and took him to the floor, **"Run Joe! Run!"** *I ran* into her house and none of her family was in. I looked at the car outside and got an idea. I looked for the car keys and thankfully they were on top of the drawer next to the front door. Then, I heard a gunshot, Love ran in and searched for bandages. **"Wait what happened?"** I said

**"I killed that asshole."** she told me. 

**"I love you so much, Love."** 

**"Me too, let's go now."** she replied  
We got in the car and I turned the engine on. I pressed on the gas pedal and headed to Vegas. I asked her **"What now?"** she told me **"Baby, I have a plan, lets run away as fast as we can."** And we did, we told the cops everything, they didn't believe us but DNA said otherwise. My sister and most people at the funeral died. My father died, life flipped upside down

Love's parents followed us to Vegas and I live with them now, they already had plans to move away.

I moved out and married Love at 21. Everything fine right? Happy ending.

Until, one night, on our honeymoon. I saw a post. from an anonymous account, it was a picture of me and Love on the balcony, captioned "**Hello, you."**

**How the fuck?**
