Every pit has a bottom. One of the guys in the yellow suits told me that, every pit has a bottom. I talked to one of em, back before I was desperate, don't know why I remember him saying that. Maybe it's cause you don't talk much here, not a whole lotta people to talk to anyways, and around these parts, if you hear a scream for help, it's either a trap or a meal. 

People pop outta the ceiling like it's some kinda portal, there's a buncha places it happens, but it's always the same places, and the people always come in confused, looking around wide eyed, like deer in the headlights. It's pretty easy to take em without much noise, don't wanna bring any attention. Get em quick and get em away, make sure not to leave a trail, people here follow trails, especially from where they pop in. Sometimes one of the yellow guys will pop in, carrying a camera more often than not, heard em screaming about monsters and elevators. They're harder to kill, the suit kinda protects em I guess, but it makes not leaving a blood trail easier, so it's a trade off really. I've heard folks talk about monsters in other places, but not here, nope, no monsters here cept the human ones, just yellow walls, buzzing lights, and teeth.

I try to stay away from the pools unless I've gotta go near em, water there tastes like chlorine but it tastes better than the crap you can suck outta the carpet. Never go near slides unless you want to end up on somebody's menu. I get going crazy cause of hunger, I mean obviously, but it's the Buzzers that I don't get. Some folks just can't handle those lights always buzzing, drives em a different kinda crazy. They don't eat what they kill, but they always take the ears. 

 Then there's the Droolers, boy let me tell ya, I don't care how hungry you get, never eat the brain. Not even a little, you throw that crap away fast as you can, temptation is a hulluva thing. Looks like Jello when your stomachs stops rumbling and starts eating itself, but don't do it. Eats holes in your head, makes you shake, go a different kinda crazy, drooling and howling, they can't talk cause they ate their tongues. That happens a lot to the old timers here, nibble by nibble they eat their tongues away. Better to eat your tongue than sombody's brain.

I don't know if anybody will ever read this, hoping it might help out some poor bastard, keep em alive longer at least. If you're reading this, keep moving, try to stay alive as long as you can, stay away from noise, and go as long as you can before you start eating people. Once you cross that threshold, you don't go back. Good luck at the bottom of the pit. I truly hope I don't end up eating you.
