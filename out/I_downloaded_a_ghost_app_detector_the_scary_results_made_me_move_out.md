Hi, The app read “Would you like to begin” I read it with ease and excitement. Oh but I was horribly wrong by a mile, My name is Jon Velds, 25, I am living with my parents This is My story. Without hesitation I clicked on the “continue” button, then the app showed a prompt it read “How to use iGhost - the lines you will see while ghost detecting is spirits malicious or not it will detect and most important of all proceed with extreme caution” Ok I thought will anything else what” what could possibly go wrong. Late that night I opened up the app on my burner iPhone XS. Soon after I started hearing faint footsteps i thought it was my own mother or father but when I checked they were asleep. I could see they’re integral structure of there body’s like a stickman “Cool I thought” I went to the kitchen afterwards And pointed my back camera at my kitchen and living room. Nothing for a second a mere second until i pointed my camera a bit down it was there a tall  blackish whitish slenderly structure, which i assumed the colour because of the lines showed . Now of course I couldn’t see it BUT THEN… 

it transformed to a straight line, then a quadrupedal figure like a dog or cat much different from the bipedal character it had prior. My neighbours dog could be heard barking through the wall and the fence. then it noclipped through the door and ran outside “HOLY F#CK!NG SH!T A WITCH” - (a skin walker basically) I went to sleep shocked and scared to my core bones, sweat shredded me with fear, but no, the surprise was nothing happened a app glitch I thought the next day while stirring my coffee with a SPOON and sat down thinking while my mum and dad where gone to best buy for a new television. My dinner table or a dining table was big enough for fit 4 persons or 4 people or 4 animals or 4 entities… 

My chairs moved and fell like a unseen ghost or poltergeist was controlling the chairs. But worst of all one came and appeared out of nowhere, I was already cover in wet sweat shivering violently. it was cleverly placed adjacent to my chair i was sitting on right now through the window i saw it a happy and creepy looking dog. It struck me even more. smiling oddly with a malicious look it terrified my bones shaking even more violently. It turns out the history of house was even more or equally freaky as this experience the pages of the old soggy newspaper read “a… a… dog died here its name Jo - a stray rescued dog from a severe heart attack at the park “Hens burg Reserve”

The heart attack was luckily saved by the vet “Lala Per” The dog - Jo later died due to internal bleeding and complications. “It was sad and tragic He could’ve been saved if we noticed earlier” - Emily Carter and Owen Carter, the previous owner wrote via a SMS message to a Telegram group - called Instate-able Real A State Agency of Berlin Germany. But they both later died to due to heart complications

Laying heartbroken in there death bed at the hospital. the legend has it a skin walker moved in and magically consumed they’re bodies there grave in unknown, I dismissed the rumours at first but i”m a heavy believer in the supernatural now. And will never forgot this traumatic experience at 31 Petersburg St. Now I’ve moved with my parents The rural/suburban area in the city on Munich Germany. All I’ve heard of about my old address is that 31 Petersburg St  is it still remains unoccupied at in wrecks of ruins with the aim of building a motel. I am now a certified skeptic and believer.
