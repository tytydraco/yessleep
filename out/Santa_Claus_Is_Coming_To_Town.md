The Christmas season is the most wonderful time of the year, all the candy, presents, the decorations, and Santa Claus. The jolly old elf that brings gifts to all the good boys and girls of the world, with his big belly and red suit. I used to love this time of the year but you will soon read why that changed. 

I was 11 years old, and it was the first of December. I laid in bed as my mother scolded me about something I had done that day and she ended with the cliché “you are getting coal and switches for Christmas this year!” As I drifted off to sleep, thought to myself “if she thought I was bad today she has another thing coming!”

 I was awakened  in the middle of the night by the sounds of heavy breathing, so as most children would do I hid under the covers then, I Heard a raspy voice say “hello naughty boy, I’ve come to take you far away, there is nothing you can do or say, there is no need to scream and no need to fight because one way or another you are going with me tonight.” It ripped away the covers and stood, a monster of a creature with twisted giant black horns and draped with an old grotesque crimson coat. His face looked of old dry leather with hollow eyes and long crooked teeth. Next thing I know it shoved me in a basket with other children, then everything went black

.
When I came to I was freezing cold with others around me sobbing we were in a makeshift cage, there must have been 30 other kids besides me. Everyone was confused and scared, Then the creature came into the room unlocked the cell and snatched one of the other children and as he did, he snarled  “The bad for the good, it's all about sacrifice you see, your sins are delicious and you will all feed me” and just like that he sunk his teeth in to his victim and as he wailed in pain, the creature left with him. .

Throughout the days the Monster would send these little creatures in for the next victim, you could see the sorrow in their eyes as they carried out his work. From time to time the monster would come in to hand pick his next meal and every time he did he was a little fatter and his hair began to grow it was almost as if we were witnesses to the dead coming back to life. It started out with one child every couple of days, then to one a day and now he would take two or three at a time.
We made our plans and tried to escape but to no avail and the days drug on and on and I was the last child left in the cage and I knew that today would be the day the creature would eat me. It had been awhile since he himself had came to collect his meal and I could only imagine what he looked like now. Visions of the monster with his grotesque grin spun around in my head, then I heard the now familiar sound of the lock opening and I saw him walk in.
 
 I knew my time had come and I would be the next meal for the monster, as he approached me I noticed something was different, his beard was full and his cheeks where merry the coat that once was way too big fit him perfectly he was fat and happy he looked like a jolly old man not threatening at all but then he spoke “Its Christmas Eve child there is no need to be frightened” I cried out in anger “what kind of monster are you!?” “Santa Claus” he chuckled. He saw the look of confusion on my face and he laughed his deep guttural laugh and began to speak “it's all about sacrifice it’s simply to see, I take the bad and reward the good and it pleases me. I'm  Krampus to the bad, but Santa to the good ,this part of my life is misunderstood.” It made sense to me now, I had always wondered how a man living in the North pole stayed so full and healthy with no vegetation or any other source of food. He smiled at my realization and said “December is my month, my time to thrive, and I bet you are wondering why you are still alive?” I nodded as he bent down and he removed his hat, the horns shone bright,  “Every year I do this, Every year it's the same, every year I release one so the world will remember my name.” I looked at him puzzled and he picked up on my confusion and continued “The reason I Live, the reason I survive,  is that all the children believe I’m alive. All the other old gods like me, have gone out of existence and cease to be. the world forgot who they are, but not old Santa Claus not so far. You will tell your story, you will tell your tale, though many won't believe some of them will”

I passed out and woke up on my front porch, I beat and beat on the door with all my might and my parents came down we were United again. I told them what happen but just like Santa said “though many won’t believe you, some of them will.”  The only part they seemed to believe was I was with Santa they forgot about him looking like a monster or eating children, so the spirt of christmas lives on.  

The only reason I’m writing this after all these years, is because my neighbors little boy was taken last night from his bed and that little feller has been a holy terror all year, he didn’t heed my warnings no matter how sincere they were; I did all I could for him but boys will be boys and he will answer for it I’m afraid. I’ll leave you with this, he sees you when you sleeping, he knows when you're awake, his mouth waters when you’ve been bad, so be good for god sakes, because he is coming to town.
