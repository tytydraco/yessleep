In the world of a private reporter, one can and likely will be subject to a variety of strange occurrences. The allure to this, for me at least, is that I strive to be the first to document them and decode the underlying mysteries.

The story I’m working on at the moment is unlike anything I’ve seen before. Truly, it’s the most bizarre incident I’ve ever had the pleasure of investigating. Well, maybe pleasure isn’t the right word to describe yesterday’s events, but I would be a liar to say that this one hasn’t got me riled up.

.

My name is Lewis Amar – that’s “Ay-mar” – though most refer to me as “Lou” in person. Perhaps excessive syllables aren’t worth the time for most, but I’ve never objected to the name. I’ve been a private reporter, investigator to an extent, for the majority of my adult life. I suppose that, in some ways, my passion is similar to that held by mountain climbers, cavers, and other such hobbyists, in the endless search for virgin territory, to sink the teeth into.

But, as evidenced by my experience, some things are not worth the intrigue, and are better left alone, to stagnate outside of public awareness.

I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me begin at the beginning, at the flame which ignited the trailing fuse.

I live in a relatively large town in Utah, you know, the red-rock type of place, broiling summers and usually mild winters. The cold is dispelled much by the town’s surroundings, sheltered by hills and mountains – though, on the flip side, it turns into a greenhouse out of hell in the hotter months as a result.

All of this started yesterday. I’ve been running dry on juicy stories to dig into for a few weeks, and was just going about my weekly routines.

I found myself ambling down the cracked pavement, heading to my favourite grocery store to stock up. I mean, there wasn’t anything massively special about Rockamart, but I always found the staff there to be the friendliest of all, often finding myself late to other deadlines for the day as I lost myself in conversation with Jimmy, the store clerk.

My usual venture was cut short when I spotted a boy stumbling down the road. Not the pavement, the road. He couldn’t have been more than 17, and he seemed to be in a fugue state. This wasn’t a huge shock to me, seeing as the heat could quickly force heat stroke on a person if they aren’t careful about sunscreen and water intake, even in the Spring months.

I slowed my pace, scuffing my trainers on the asphalt, and whipped out my phone to take a recording of this, just in case anything concerning happened. It took a considerable amount of time for the teen to wobble his way close enough to discern anything else, but when he did, my worry started to blossom upon seeing the details.

The first thing I noticed was his eyes. He didn’t seem to have any control over them whatsoever, instead lazily rolling around in his sockets, like poorly-fitting glass eyes. Full-on googly-eyes. I’m glad I decided to film him in retrospect, because it became apparent that he was babbling about something. His words were messy, as if haphazardly plucked out of an alphabet soup. The only words I caught at the time were, “we take, it takes”, “can’t, stop knowing” and “give it back”.

Of course, all this meant nothing to me at first. Simply the sun-beaten ramblings of someone who needed assistance. I moved toward him with the intention of helping, which seemed to draw his attention. He almost tripped over as he turned toward me, before messily walk-jogging his way over. In an instant, he had his dry, almost scaly hands wrapped around my shoulders, uttering further nonsense in an apparent attempt to tell me something of utmost importance.

I kept recording, though the footage consisted only of the boy’s dusty tank-top and frayed jean-shorts. Other than his previous phrases, I wasn’t able to catch onto much else, other than his frequent repetition of variations of, “stop thinking!”.

I tried to pry myself from his grip, but his hands were white-knuckled in determination to tell me something, an effort which in the end amounted to nothing. I started to panic, fearing he might accidentally hurt me in his stupor. Images of my skull cracked open on the curb flashed across my mind, when a strange movement within his eyes caught my attention.

It looked like his eyes were reflecting some dazzling light source, dancing around on their glassy surfaces. I only saw this for a moment before the kid’s eyelids drooped, and he loosened his grip. He proceeded to stumble his way down the road a while longer, before catching his foot on the curb and meeting the fate I had previously imagined awaiting me. I heard a sickening crack as his forehead struck the dry pavement and the shape of his head notably shifted on the inside.

Of course I was stunned at what I had just witnessed, but I was present enough to notice that despite such a fatal head injury, blood leaked from his head as infrequent droplets, leading to bright crimson splashes against the contrast of the drab asphalt – normally, such an accident would leave a miniature, sanguine pond in its wake, but not this time.

The weight of the situation hit me and I resisted curiosity, to reel myself back from dissociated awe. My camera app was still recording, so I ended the video and pulled up the keypad, dialling 911 and requesting immediate medical assistance.

During the 5 or 10 minutes before the ambulance arrived, I made my way over to the boy and rolled him onto his side. With his hair hanging back, I could see the injury in full, and it was not as bad as I had suspected. Still, no signs of life were left in the eyes of this poor kid, and his chest remained still. What lay before me was no longer a person, no thoughts or hopes bounding around in that dead skull.

The paramedics were quick to swipe him up and ship him away, but the futility was evident in their expressions, eyes hanging low. After they drove away at the solemn speed of a hearse, I was left standing alone, with no evidence for what just happened other than a few stray red drops on the road and, of course, my footage.

I went about my grocery shopping without any attempts at socialising, and hurried home so as to review the footage, though most importantly to back it up. A mobile phone can be a fleeting thing in comparison to the online storage service I’d been subscribed to for some years now.

So, I got home, unpacked, then set my focus on rewatching the video, over and over, in hopes I could unearth something I hadn’t at first noticed.

Honestly, the guy was so out of it, I wasn’t able to decrypt very much other than a few things.

First, I noticed a detail that had been glossed over before. Around the upper portion of the kid’s head, there was a very faint mark, circling the perimeter of his skull. It was no surprise I hadn’t noticed it, seeing as how faint it was, but it looked something like pink scar tissue. There was no point in going any further with this, with no background on this guy, but it went into my notepad nonetheless.

Second and lastly, I was indeed able to make out some more of his words, but the rest remained a nonsensical tumble-dryer of letters and sounds. Most of what I could discern is irrelevant to my writing here, but at two points in the video I distinctly made out the words:

“North… north, west, no-wes, western. In the up, hills, at the... the, between these peaks, the red and the dust and the red and the rust.”

This may seem useless to even consider building upon, but as a journalist those words made a big difference in this new project. Well, not at first, at the end of the day it was just a tragic event, a life removed too soon, but my loose transcript proved its true worth after meeting with one of my good friends, Davis, who just so happened to be in the local police division.

I’d contacted him about what had happened, and to my surprise he replied with an invitation, rather than the fleeting interest I’d expected. Apparently, an autopsy was required as the boy’s death couldn’t be sufficiently explained by his head injury, which was found to be minor. Davis asked if I was free to meet in a local park later in the day, so we could discuss the mystery surrounding this kid. Something about a staggering post-mortem discovery.

So, as planned, I met with Davis on the Jerusalem Green. I found him smoking on a park bench overlooking the park, but he didn’t seem overjoyed upon seeing me. He looked more, well, paranoid than anything. After finding my seat, he skipped any formalities and was straight to the point.

“So, uh, you know I could get in a LOT of shit for this, Lou. I don’t wanna be here too long.”

“Yeah, yeah of course. I really appreciate your help here, man.”

“Okay, I’m gonna make this quick. This the kind of case that gets the attention of the higher-ups, so I’ll tell you this once, and once only. Kid’s name was Aiden O'Leary.”

His serious tone quickly had the same effect on me, and I lowered my voice, glancing left to right a couple of times to make sure we had no unwelcome eavesdroppers.

We sat in silence for a moment, as I stared at Davis expectantly.

“So, you know how they had to do the autopsy? Couldn’t determine a believable cause of death, so they cut him open, yada yada… well they, erm… they ended up examining his brain, sawing through bone, you get the picture.”

“Damn. That’s… did they figure out what happened to him? Brain damage, stroke, something like that?”

“They found nothing.”

“Oh, well that’s unfortunate, I guess- “

“No, Lewis, they found *nothing*. Literally. Kid was hollow-headed, and not in the metaphorical sense. No brain, not even any residual parts. Some evil fuck cut his head open, most likely.”

Even being second-hand to this revelation, I was shocked, and appalled that anyone could do this to an adolescent. It dawned on me after processing what I’d just heard, the glaringly obvious sore thumb about the whole thing.

“Then… how was he alive? And how long for?”

My question garnered no response. Instead, Davis just sat there, dead-eyed, and slowly shaking his head. I relented, and just sat with him, sharing a moment of baffled silence.

“I can’t tell ya anything else, man. I’m already risking my job, so if you don’t mind, I’ll be off now. Nice seeing ya.”

And with that, he was gone, back on his daily schedule.

The walk back was slow, energy redirected into my thoughts as I ran through the endless possibilities of explanations which might change the pure impossibility of the incident. Even after getting back and sitting at my desk, my fingers lay idly on the work surface as my mind raced in a desperate effort to understand.

I haven’t come to any adequate conclusion yet, so I’ve decided I’m going to look into the kid’s identity. See if I can’t find his socials, figure out what he’s been doing, where he was last seen… you get the idea.

I’ll be contacting my partner in crime, Annie, also a journalist. Hopefully she’ll help in having a different perspective, something like that. Hopefully she’s not busy, but honestly, I have a feeling she’ll shelf whatever she’s working on in favour of looking into this, so if it works out we’ll be spending the rest of today doing research.
