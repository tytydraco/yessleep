I’m typing this from an airport bathroom stall because I don’t know who is waiting for me outside my gate, and I don’t think it’s the person I thought it was.


I’m not new to long-distance relationships, but this one still haunts me.
At 18, I met “Evan” (not his real name) online. He was 20. I lived in the city; he lived deep in rural North Carolina, one of those towns with a single gas station, no Uber, and woods that didn’t allow a phone call to go through for miles.


We talked constantly. TikTok, Instagram DMs, FaceTime.
After eight months, I flew down and stayed with him and his family for almost a month. It was weird but sweet. Quiet house, polite family, everyone praying before every meal. His grandma said things like, “A good woman tames a restless man,” and, “Evan dreams… loudly.”
I thought it was Southern religious quirkiness.


When I left, he broke up with me a week later.
Blocked me on everything.
No explanation.


He disappeared.


Two years passed. I’m 20 now. Out of nowhere, I got the urge to text him, not because I wanted him back, more like… unfinished business. Trauma nostalgia or whatever.


I still had his number saved, but I expected the text to send green or bounce back with an error.


I literally typed:


“hey. idk why i’m sending this. hope you’re good, ev.”

I hit send.

It sent blue.

It was read within seconds.

My stomach dropped. I almost threw my phone.

Then he replied:

“is this really you? i’ve been waiting for you to text me back.”

And I’m like text me back? He hadn’t texted me once since he blocked me.

Maybe he meant “reach out again,” whatever. I didn’t overthink.

We started talking. And he was… perfect. Kind. Warm. Apologetic without being weird.
He said he never dated anyone else after me.
He missed me.
He still had “my side of the bed.”
He said his mom and grandma asked about me for months.

Looking back, that part bothers me the most.


We didn’t FaceTime. He said his phone camera was cracked.
(Old excuse. Familiar. I let it slide.)

We only called at night.
The connection always sounded… thick. Like he was covering the mic with a pillow. Or calling from inside a closet. Sometimes I’d hear shuffling or breathing beside him, and when I asked, he’d say:


“Just my dog. He sleeps weird.”


Like okay sure, they had a dog when I visited. But it was a *she* and she clung onto his younger brother like all the time. She never went into Evan’s room, let alone slept in his bed so at this point I’m a little weirded out. 

But every time something felt off, he’d say something perfect, something nostalgic enough to disarm me.

And I let myself believe him.


Finally, we decide I’ll visit again.

He sounds thrilled, too thrilled, and begs me not to tell anyone I’m coming. He says he wants it to be a “special surprise.”

Stupidly, I believe him.

I book a flight.

Today.

This morning.

I’m on the plane, descending, excited and sick at the same time. I haven’t traveled alone since I was 18. I take a photo of the clouds through the window, cliché airplane shot, and impulsively tag him on Instagram.

I write:

“Almost there.”

Within a minute, he sees it.

Then he DMs me:

“why did you tag me”

“what the hell is wrong with you”

“why are you flying here”

“stop. seriously. STOP.”


I freeze.
My stomach hits the floor.
I click his profile.

A public Instagram I haven’t checked in years.

Pinned post, his engagement photos.
Dated one year ago.
Recent story, a video of him and his fiancée decorating a Christmas tree last night.

They look happy.
He looks the same.

So who have I been talking to?

My hands are shaking so hard the typing is blurry.

Someone, or something, has been using that number.

And they knew everything about me.

As I’m standing up to leave the plane, my phone vibrates.

From the old number:

“can’t wait to see u”

“i’m right here by the exit like last time”


I look toward the front of the plane.

Someone is standing silhouetted in the narrow hallway. Tall. Still. Facing the door. Not moving even as passengers tell him to step aside.

Just waiting.

I’m in an airport bathroom now. The flight attendants asked if he was with me. I said no. They said he wouldn’t answer them, just stood there breathing through his nose like he was trying not to smile.

I don’t know what to do.

If this posts, please tell me what to do.
My connecting flight home isn’t for six hours.
And someone is still texting me:

“i missed u so much the first time”

“your side of the bed is ready”

“come back. come home.”


I hear footsteps outside the stall.

Not airport footsteps.

Slow.

Bare.

Dragging.

I don’t think that dog ever really went near him if I remember correctly.

But something was always in that room with us when we called.

And it remembers me.
