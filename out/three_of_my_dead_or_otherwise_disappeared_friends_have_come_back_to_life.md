This one might be a little bit different than some of the other posts on this subreddit. So I apologize if it's not what people want to hear and by all means go ahead and delete it if that's the case.

My story revolves around the idea that there are "humans" that are not entirely humans. They're just human-like. I think these human-like non-humans exist in the real world and also exist online. They look like us, talk like us, and do everything that we do... But they're not one of us. I get a lot of hate because of my YouTube videos on this matter. People think I'm just being insensitive but over the years I've collected some evidence at least in the form of my own experiences.

Over the course of the past two months, three of my dead or otherwise disappeared friends have come back to life. I can't explain it. I've been talking about it, trying to rationalize what is happening but I just can't. Maybe you can help. Sorry this is kind of a long post, I'll get right into it and I'll make it brief so as not to take up your whole day. 

A couple months ago I was looking for one of my good friends who had moved away from where I was living. We had a lot of friends in common and even did some shows together. We talked a lot and we're all in all good buddies. After he moved away, I also moved away. It's probably been about 5 years since I've spoken to him. So I get online, and I attempt to find him on my social medias because that's how we had been keeping in touch prior to his disappearance. I find absolutely nothing. No evidence of him whatsoever. He's not even on the apps at all. He had some health complications that were pretty serious, so I started searching obituaries. Nothing. I even made a post about him, asking all of our mutual friends too sort of help me find him. But nobody had any clue where he was.

Only a couple days after finding nothing and giving up entirely... I just assumed that he had unfortunately passed away. That's when it gets weird. Because out of nowhere he materialized on my social medias again. I shot him a message, not thinking too much about it; just excited to see him alive and well. He tells me this tragic story about how he died several times in the hospital but now he's back better than ever. Weird. I had no idea how to respond to that but I just applauded his strength and resilience and told him I was happy he was still here with us and would like to stay in touch. We still do.

Now, I move around a lot. Because of this, I sometimes fall out of touch with people. Because of verious instances of being reminded of my own mortality over the past couple months I've been trying to reconnect with some of these people from my past. So in the same month or two that my dead friend came back to life, I reached out to two other people. Same story. Same exact story. They had vanished without a trace. Nobody knew where they were. Nobody knew where they went. And nobody knew why. And then, as if they were just waiting for me to look for them, they appear a day or two after I search for them.

The other two are kind of strange too because their posts don't exactly seem like things they would post. The things they say are odd, for anybody to say, and especially them. This is a long story but I'm not trying to take up a ton of time and real estate here so I just am giving the briefest description of my "encounter" as I can. 

I'm not convinced that these are my friends. The bizarre behavior. The disappearance and reappearance immediately after I search for them. The admittance of death and essentially reincarnation... The weird and uncharacteristic form of speaking after returning to "life."

Has anybody else experienced this sort of activity? Cuz I'll be honest, it does make me feel like I'm going a little crazy. I just feel like every day I'm being surrounded by more and more people who aren't exactly people anymore. They're like flesh puppets. And in the case of the internet, they're like skinwalkers that inhabit the accounts of my dead friends.

Anyway that's all for now. Thanks for reading.
