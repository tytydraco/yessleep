I can’t believe I'm writing this down, let alone online, but no one else believes me. I’ll start by saying I only moved into this apartment a week ago and I never thought in a million years something this outlandish would happen, but here we are. It’s just a simple two bedroom apartment in Tucson, Arizona. Music and flashing lights blare from underneath my pantry door at night and only when I'm alone. My brother stayed with me the first night and nothing weird happened. It wasn't until he left that this all started. At first I thought it was the intense summer heat causing me to hallucinate, but that’s not the case since I have physical evidence now.

It’s a candy bar. Nothing special. Just a king size Snickers like the kind those wealthy neighborhoods would hand out during Halloween as a kid. I always begged my parents to take me to those houses and I always left with my pillow case nearly tugging me down to the pavement. I would later use that same surplus of king size candies to barter with other classmates at school who had the best lunches.

I was in no hurry to eat this candy bar. It sat on my kitchen table, unopened as I mulled over all the ways I could be making this up. It was a prize from the game show in my pantry…at least I think so. Maybe it was the move? Maybe I was overworked? Or maybe it was something I ate? I’d been on a consistent diet of fast food, take out, and microwavables for over a week now until I was able to unpack my cookware and go grocery shopping. So, perhaps I bought this without thinking and the entire experience last night of my pantry leading to a bright, colorful gameshow was just a GMO sludge induced dream.

I would've happily continued to believe that until the music started again and the glowing lights peaked from just underneath the pantry door. I tried to ignore it and finish unpacking a box of books when I heard a muffled, feminine voice call out to me from beyond the door.

“Aaron! Your fate calls out as you are the next contestant on: RISK! OR! REWARD!”

An invisible audience cried out the name of the game show, but last night there was no audience. I entered through the pantry door into a black box theater where there were empty seats behind me. Massive letters hung above a red and gold podium, spelling the name of the show in round, incandescent bulbs. Behind the podium stood a tall, slender, and angelic looking woman dressed in a dazzling, green sequined, pant suit that glinted under the stage lights. She smiled wide, holding a microphone close to her ruby lips with her sharp, freshly manicured nails. They were painted black, save for the tips that were as red as her lips and looked as though they were dipped in blood.

Behind the Host were thick red curtains and in front of me was a clear podium with a second mic attached to the top of it. That was all. No speakers where the sounds could be coming out of. No audience members. No crew to help run the show. No camera to record or televise it. It made no sense what this place was. Who was this game show host and why was she in my pantry?

She gestured to the clear podium and called to me again. “Aaron! Come on down! It’s your turn to try your luck on: RISK OR REWARD!” She cheerfully beckoned followed by the unseen audience. The room grew silent then. So silent I could’ve heard my sweat droplets hit the floor. I slowly approached my podium and leaned into the mic.

“Um, h-hello?” 

“Hello, Aaron! Thank you for joining us on our glamorous show! Now, seeing as this is your first time on the show I’ll make it simple. On my command, the curtains will open and a request will be shown on the screen. You can either answer the request and take your REWARD orrrr…take your current winnings, but accept a RISK! The choice is yours!” The host’s smile only brightened as she motioned toward the curtain and then the exit back to my apartment.

“Well, since I don’t have any winnings I guess I’ll see what’s behind the curtain? Um, why are you-” I shrugged.

“Perfect!” She cut me off. “You heard him, lovelies! DRAW! THAT! CURTAIN!” She commanded and the curtain let out a rolling hiss as it revealed a wall made up of high end OLED screens. Displayed on the screen were shiny, wavy words that spelled out a simple question. “Aaron! Your first request is easy! ‘State your favorite color!’ Wow! I wish I was you right now!” The host read off the screen and her emerald eyes glinted with excitement, but could be mistaken for…hunger? No, that wasn’t it.

“Uh…purple.” I muttered.

Alarms and bells went off. Flashes of multicolored light circled all around the theater. 

“Congratulations, Aaron! Your reward iiiiis…” Just then, a hole in the floor opened revealing a rising pillar. The white, marble pillar stopped at waist height in the center of the theater between me and the host. Atop the pillar sat a single king size Snickers bar. “A delicious snack! Go on and take your prize!” 

I scratched my head, walked over to the pillar and picked up the candy. I examined it for any irregularities, but saw none.

“Thanks?” I looked back at the host and raised an eyebrow.

“Anytime! Thanks for playing, Aaron! Come back again soon for another thrilling round oooof…RISK! OR! REWARD!” She called out again and with a loud Thunk! The lights in the theater went out leaving me in complete darkness. 

I jumped and bumped my head on something light and hollow. I reached above me and felt a string of metal beads. I pulled and was nearly blinded by a single bulb lighting up the square foot of space I was now in. As I blinked and regained my vision I stared at a can of refried beans on a shelf. I was back in my pantry.

That was last night and I have to admit that I’m incredibly curious to see what the request is this time. If they continue to be this easy, who knows what kind of reward awaits me? But a small voice in the back of my mind keeps nagging me: This isn’t possible and it’s too good to be true.
