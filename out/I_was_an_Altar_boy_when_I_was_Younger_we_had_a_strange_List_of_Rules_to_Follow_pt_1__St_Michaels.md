I'm sitting down and writing this story now because the weight of my past still haunts my dreams, and I need an outlet to confront the darkness that lingers from my days as an altar boy. As I type these words, I'm an atheist, a far cry from the faithful child I once was.  
Writing this seems like a therapy of sorts, a way to purge the demons that cling to the corners of my mind. You see, I was an altar boy, and the memories of those days are a heavy chain around my soul. But my reasons for sharing this story extend beyond personal catharsis.  
I want the world to know my story, in the hopes that it might serve as a warning or offer solace to others who've walked a similar path. I've shed my belief in the divine, but some events from my past remain unexplained, continuing to haunt my thoughts.  
Stepping into that dimly lit church for the first time, the scent of incense heavy in the air, I was just an innocent, impressionable child who believed in the stories they told me. I believed in a benevolent God watching over us. But my belief shattered, piece by piece, as I was initiated into a world of strange rules and rituals that extended far beyond the altar.  
As I write now, the tension of those memories hangs in the air, the fear and unease etched into my heart. I may have lost faith in a higher power, but I know that something dark and inexplicable touched my life during those years. So, despite the anxiety and pain that may come from it, I share my story, knowing that there's no turning back once I begin.  
When I was just eight years old, my life took a dark and unexpected turn. My mother, a devout Catholic, who had taken me to church regularly, had been committed to the nearby Evergreen Mental Health Center after a harrowing incident. It was a foggy November evening, and I can still vividly recall the chilling screams that pierced through the walls of our home. Shadows danced wildly in our living room as I huddled in a corner, my heart pounding. My mother's eyes had been wide with terror, her voice trembling as she muttered something about "the eyes in the darkness." It was a nightmarish episode that defied explanation, leaving her committed for her own safety, or so they said.  
Left without a guardian, I found myself in the care of St. Michael's Church and Orphanage. St. Michael's, a massive, centuries-old stone structure, loomed over the small town like a silent sentinel. It had always been a place of solace for my mother and me, where we sought refuge from life's trials, attending mass every Sunday without fail. Now, it was to be my temporary home, a refuge of a different kind.  
The church was run by a stern priest named Father Matthias, a man with a reputation for his unwavering dedication to his faith. He had a presence that commanded respect, but his eyes held a hint of something deeper, something that unsettled me even at such a young age.  
As I arrived for my first day at St. Michael's, the church seemed to greet me with a sense of eerie familiarity. Its towering stone walls held countless secrets, and the stained glass windows filtered the dim sunlight into an ethereal mosaic of colors that danced on the ancient pews below. The silence within was profound, broken only by the soft echo of my footsteps on the cold, polished marble floor.  
Father Matthias awaited me near the altar, his stern expression softening slightly as he caught sight of me. His gray cassock billowed as he approached, revealing the crucifix that hung from his neck, casting a faint shadow on his lined face.  
"Welcome, young one," Father Matthias said in a deep, soothing voice. "I am Father Matthias, and you may call me Father Matt. You'll find that St. Michael's is a place of solace, even though it may seem imposing at first."  
I nodded hesitantly, my heart still heavy with the weight of recent events. "I'm Andy," I replied, finding solace in the simplicity of my own name.  
Father Matt gave a small smile and gestured for me to follow as he began the tour. "Come, Andy, let me show you around. St. Michael's has a rich history, and it has been a sanctuary for those in need for centuries."  
As we walked through the church, Father Matt shared stories of the church's past, its stained glass windows depicting scenes from biblical tales, the ornate statues of saints lining the walls, and the organ that had played its haunting melodies for generations. Despite the priest's attempt at making me feel at ease, an inexplicable chill seemed to persist in the air, as if the very stones of the church were keeping some ancient secret.  
We continued our tour through dimly lit corridors, passing doorways leading to mysterious chambers I could only imagine. Father Matt spoke of the strict routines and rituals that would become a part of my daily life, each one designed to strengthen my connection to the church and its faith. He spoke of the sacristy where I would prepare for mass, the choir loft where I would sing praises to God, and the confessional where secrets were laid bare.  
As we stood before the confessional, Father Matt turned to me, his gaze unyielding. "Andy, remember this," he said in a hushed tone. "What is said within these walls must never leave them. The sanctity of the confessional is paramount."  
I nodded, his words sinking in like a stone dropped into the depths of my soul. The sense of foreboding that had accompanied me to St. Michael's intensified, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I had entered a world far more complex and unsettling than I had ever imagined, although my young mind felt ill-equipped to understand the weight of this revelation.   
Father Matthias continued our tour through the labyrinthine halls of St. Michael's, revealing the few other orphans who called this place home. We came across a small group of children, their faces etched with a mixture of curiosity and uncertainty. Most of them were younger than me, their eyes wide and innocent, contrasting sharply with the stern atmosphere of the church.  
"This is your new family for the time being, Andy," Father Matt announced, introducing me to each child in turn. "This is Mary, she's nine," he said, gesturing to a shy girl with auburn hair. Mary offered a timid smile in response.  
"Michael, who is seven," he continued, pointing to a boy with freckles and a mop of unruly blond hair. Michael greeted me with an enthusiastic wave.  
"And this is Sarah, just a bit older than you, at ten," Father Matt said, indicating a quiet girl with long, dark hair who seemed to regard me with a mixture of curiosity and caution.  
There were a few more children that Father Matt mentioned but didn't introduce personally. He rattled off their names and ages, but they remained distant, like shadows in the background of my new life.  
As we moved on from the children, Father Matt's demeanor shifted, becoming more solemn. He led me to a small, secluded chamber near the rear of the church, its dim lighting casting long shadows across the ancient stone walls.  
"Now, Andy," Father Matt began, his voice dropping to a hushed tone, "there are a few more things we need to cover. These are not just routines and regulations; they are sacred rules that must be followed without question. Do you understand?"  
I nodded, a growing sense of unease gnawing at my insides. It was as if I had crossed a threshold, entering a world where the rules were not simply guidelines but absolute commandments.  
Father Matt's eyes bore into mine as he prepared to unveil these mysterious rules that would govern my life within the walls of St. Michael's Church and Orphanage.  
Father Matthias regarded me with a solemn expression as he began to list the rules, aware of the need to reassure my young, impressionable mind.  
"Rule number one, Andy," he said, his voice steady, "is that lights-out is at nine o'clock every night. You must never leave your room after that hour. It's important for everyone's safety and for maintaining a peaceful atmosphere."  
That seemed reasonable enough, and I nodded in understanding.  
"Rule number two," Father Matt continued, "when we are in mass, you must never stare at the statue of Saint Agnes, the one to the left of the altar. It's a matter of respect. Looking at it during the service is considered disrespectful."  
I nodded again, making a mental note to avoid the gaze of the stern-looking saint.  
"Rule number three," he said, his tone becoming more serious, "sometimes, you may hear a voice outside your room at night, beckoning you to play or leave. Ignore it, no matter what it says. You must stay in your room until morning, remember rule number one."  
The idea of a mysterious voice outside my door made my hair stand on its ends, but I nodded once more, resolved to follow this strange directive.  
"Rule number four," Father Matt continued, "is about the confession booth. If you ever enter the booth and then come out, and things seem... different, close your eyes and enter the booth again. Say nothing until you hear my voice. It's a matter of spiritual protection, Andy."  
This rule struck me as particularly odd, but I didn't question it. Father Matt's authority was absolute in my eyes.  
"Finally, rule number five," he said, his voice heavy with a sense of finality, "under no circumstances should you go into the basement. It's a place that's off-limits to all of us. It's a dark and foreboding place, and it's best to avoid it."  
As he concluded his list, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of unease settling over me. These rules, especially the ones about the basement and the confession booth, left me with an unsettling sense of mystery. But Father Matthias had presented them as essential for our well-being, and I knew that as a young boy in this unfamiliar world, I had no choice but to abide by them.  
Father Matthias nodded in approval as I acknowledged the rules, and then he gently led me towards the heart of St. Michael's, where the everyday life of the church and orphanage unfolded. We soon arrived at a small classroom, where a stern-looking nun with a habit and a ruler in her hand was organizing books.  
"Andy," Father Matt said, "this is Sister Margaret. She'll be your teacher and guide during your stay here. Sister Margaret, this is Andy."  
Sister Margaret's expression softened slightly as she offered a tight-lipped smile. "Pleasure to meet you, Andy. We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other."  
Father Matthias continued, "And now, Andy, I'd like to introduce you to Sister Catherine. She's the head nun of St. Michael's and keeps everything in order. If you ever need help or guidance, she's the one to speak to."  
Sister Catherine, a much older nun with a serene demeanor, nodded at me kindly. "Welcome, Andy. We're glad to have you here."  
With that, Father Matthias and Sister Catherine exchanged a knowing glance, as if there were things left unsaid between them. The head nurse arrived at our side, and I realized that my time with Father Matt was coming to an end.  
Father Matthias placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder. "You're in good hands, Andy. Follow Sister Margaret's lead, and remember the rules we discussed. You'll do just fine here. Sister Catherine and I have some matters to attend to. We'll check in on you later."  
As they left, I couldn't help but feel a growing sense of isolation in this unfamiliar place. I watched Father Matthias and Sister Catherine disappear around a corner, leaving me alone with Sister Margaret, who regarded me with an expectant look, ready to begin my new life at St. Michael's Church and Orphanage.  
The first few days at St. Michael's were a whirlwind of new faces, routines, and the constant presence of Sister Margaret. While the rules and the cryptic warnings from Father Matthias still weighed heavily on my mind, the presence of other children my age brought a degree of comfort to the otherwise intimidating environment.  
It was on the third day that I properly met Michael, the seven-year-old boy with a mop of unruly blond hair whom Father Matt had introduced during my tour. Our paths crossed in the small courtyard behind the church, where a patch of overgrown grass and a single gnarled tree served as our modest playground.  
I watched as Michael tried to climb the tree with all the enthusiasm and recklessness that only a child could muster. He slipped and tumbled to the ground with a thud, dusting off his clothes with a grin that revealed a missing front tooth.  
"Hey, you're Andy, right?" he asked, flashing me a mischievous smile as he approached. "I'm Michael."  
I nodded, relieved to find someone my age to talk to. "Nice to meet you, Michael. You okay?"  
He shrugged off his fall as if it were nothing. "I fall all the time. No big deal. Wanna play a game?"  
I hesitated, glancing around to make sure Sister Margaret wasn't watching. It was the first time I had been given any semblance of free time since my arrival, and the idea of playing was too tempting to resist. "Sure, what do you want to play?"  
Michael's eyes sparkled with excitement as he explained a game he called "Shadow Tag." It involved darting around the courtyard, trying to step on each other's shadows while avoiding being tagged. It was a simple game, but it offered a much-needed break from the strict routines of St. Michael's.  
As we played, Michael shared stories about the other children, like Mary and Sarah, whom I had yet to meet. He spoke of their personalities, their likes and dislikes, and the pranks they sometimes played on Sister Margaret when they thought they could get away with it. His tales painted a picture of camaraderie and mischief that gave me hope in the midst of the eerie rules and unfamiliar surroundings.  
Despite the strange and sometimes ominous nature of St. Michael's, my budding friendship with Michael began to anchor me in this peculiar place. It was a small ray of light in a world that seemed increasingly shrouded in shadows and secrets.  
One afternoon, as I played with Michael in the courtyard, I noticed a tall, dark-haired girl standing near the entrance. She seemed older than us, and something about her demeanor gave me pause. Her name, as I had heard from father Matt, was Sarah.  
As we approached her, her cold gaze met mine, and she sized me up with a critical look. "You're the new kid, right?" she said, her voice tinged with an edge of superiority.  
I nodded nervously, my excitement from playing with Michael fading quickly in her presence. "Yeah, I'm Andy."  
Sarah's lips curled into a condescending smirk. "Well, Andy, you better watch your step around here. St. Michael's isn't a place for kids who can't follow the rules."  
I didn't know what I had done to earn her disapproval, but her words made me feel uneasy. Michael glanced at me, clearly uncomfortable with Sarah's attitude.  
Ignoring her, I turned my attention back to the game, hoping she would leave us be. But as we continued playing, something peculiar happened that sent shivers down my spine. Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw a shadow move behind one of the church's windows.  
As I steadied my gaze, I saw what looked like a person glaring at me through the glass panes. Except, it couldn’t have been a person. It was as tall as the whole stained glass window, and it was paper thin. Although I could see its legs, its slender arms reached so far that I couldn’t see any hands. I could see 2 faint, glowing spots where its eyes should be, it was as if the gaze of this creature was piercing me down to my very soul.   
My heart raced as I tried to make sense of it, my gaze fixed on the window. The boney, jagged joints of its arms filled me with an ominous, overwhelming sense of dread. Just as I was about to ask the others if they had seen it too, Sarah gave me a sudden shove, sending me sprawling to the ground.  
I landed hard, the breath knocked out of me, and I struggled to regain my bearings. Before I could react, one of the nuns, Sister Margaret, came rushing over, her expression a mix of concern and sternness.  
"What's going on here, children?" she asked, her eyes narrowing as she surveyed the scene.  
Still shaken from the fall, I stammered, "I... I saw something in the window, Sister. A shadow."  
Sister Margaret's gaze followed mine to the window, but there was nothing there now, just the fading daylight. She sighed and helped me to my feet. "Sometimes our minds play tricks on us, Andy. There's nothing to be afraid of. Now, go inside and wash up for dinner."  
As I walked away, the feeling of dread lingered, and I couldn't help but wonder about the shadow I had seen and what secrets St. Michael's held within its ancient walls. I took a final glance at the stained panes and to my dismay, the shadow was gone. I had no choice, but to put this in the back of my mind and continue my day.   
Night descended upon St. Michael's, casting long shadows throughout the ancient hallways. Sister Margaret, after our evening meal, directed us to our rooms for the night. It was during these quiet hours that Michael and I had a chance to talk, free from the watchful eyes of the nuns.  
We sat on the edge of our beds, whispering in the dim candlelight. Michael, who had always appeared cheerful, leaned in closer, his expression more serious.  
"You know, Andy," he began, "Sarah might act all timid in front of the adults, but she's a real bully when they're not around. Be careful around her."  
I nodded, grateful for the warning. I had already sensed something unsettling about her.  
Then, Michael's voice dropped to a hushed tone, and he cast a cautious glance at the room's window. "And about that shadow you saw," he said, "I've seen it too."  
My heart raced as I leaned in, eager to hear more. "You've seen it? What is it?"  
Michael shook his head slowly, his expression haunted. "I don't know, but I've heard whispers from the other kids. They say there are things in this place, things we can't understand. That's why we have to follow the rules, Andy. We can't afford to look into things around here."  
His words sparked an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach, and I couldn't help but think about Father Matthias' cryptic rules and warnings. "What do you mean, follow the rules?"  
Michael glanced around nervously before continuing. "You saw how Sister Margaret and the others act. They pretend everything's normal, but it's not. There are secrets here, things they don't want us to know. So, we have to be careful and stay out of trouble."  
I nodded, my mind swirling with a mixture of curiosity and fear. St. Michael's had transformed from a place of refuge into a cryptic labyrinth of mysteries and ominous shadows. As Michael and I settled into our beds for the night, I couldn't shake the feeling that our journey into this enigmatic world was only just beginning. I’d soon find that my suspicions were right.   
The night was silent as I lay in my small bed, the moonlight casting eerie patterns on the walls of my room. Despite the unsettling events of the day, I had managed to drift into a fitful sleep. That's when I heard it—a faint, distant whisper calling my name, like a gentle breeze through the cracks of the room.  
"Andy," the voice murmured, barely audible. "Andy, come and play."  
I stirred in my bed, my eyes darting around the room. Michael lay nearby, peacefully asleep. The room was still and bathed in shadows. The voice couldn't have come from there.  
I tried to dismiss it as a dream, closing my eyes and attempting to return to sleep. But then, I heard my name again, more insistent this time, like a distant plea. My heart raced, and I realized the voice was coming from beyond the door.  
I sat up in bed, my pulse quickening as I strained to listen. The lock to my door slowly unlocked with a distinct click. The voice persisted, soft but persuasive, beckoning me to open the door and join them in a game.  
Curiosity overcame my fear, and I swung my legs out of bed, making my way toward the door with caution. My hand hovered over the knob, and my breath hitched in my throat. The voice continued its siren call, growing stronger with each passing second.  
"Come on, Andy, don't be shy. Let's play shadow tag together. It'll be so much fun,” the voice beckoned, “come out and play.”   
I couldn't resist any longer. My fingers closed around the cool brass handle, and I slowly turned it. The door inched open, revealing a sliver of darkness on the other side.  
Just as I was about to step through, the door slammed shut with surprising force. I let out a startled gasp and stumbled back, my heart pounding in my chest. As soon as the door shut the lock clicked instantly, locking the door from the outside again.   
I turned around and saw Michael standing there, bathed in the dim moonlight. His eyes were wide with terror, and his voice trembled as he scolded me in a hushed, frantic tone.  
"Andy, what are you doing? You can't open the door! You can't listen to the voices!" Michael's fear was palpable, his grip on my shoulder like a vice, “have you forgotten the rules?”   
I was taken aback, the intensity of Michael's reaction sending a chill down my spine. "But I thought it was one of the other kids," I stammered, my voice barely a whisper.  
Michael shook his head, his expression grave. "It's not a kid, Andy. It's something else. Something that's not supposed to be here. You have to promise me, you won't listen to those voices. You won't break the rules. You’d be putting us all in danger… the last kid to wander out during the night never returned. Father Matthias told us they were adopted, but I knew better.”   
I nodded, my heart heavy with fear and confusion. Children have gone missing here? My stomach swelled as I contemplated this disturbing revelation. St. Michael's had become a place of endless secrets and hidden dangers, and I was beginning to understand that there was far more to fear within these walls than I had ever imagined.  
The following morning, the echoes of the previous night's eerie events still lingered in my mind. I awoke to the soft but firm voice of Sister Catherine as she made her rounds, rousing the children from their slumber and sending us off to begin the day.  
"Come along, children," she said with a warm but authoritative tone, her presence commanding respect. "It's time for morning classes."  
Michael and I followed the other children, our footsteps echoing through the ancient hallways of St. Michael's. The classrooms were dimly lit, and Sister Margaret stood at the front, ready to impart her knowledge. Despite the shadows that clung to the walls, she began the day's lessons with a smile, her stern exterior giving way to a genuine passion for teaching.  
The lessons passed quickly, and soon it was time for mass. The children filed into the church, where the familiar scent of incense filled the air. I took my seat alongside Michael, the solemnity of the occasion washing over me.  
As the ceremony progressed, a strange sensation washed over me, a feeling that I was being watched. It was as if a pair of unseen eyes bore into the back of my head, urging me to turn and look. My gaze began to shift from person to person, trying to identify the source of this disconcerting feeling.  
Minutes passed, and the sensation intensified. My unease grew with each passing moment, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. I continued to scan the congregation, desperately searching for the source of my discomfort.  
Then, as if drawn by an invisible force, my gaze settled on the statue of St. Agnes, just left of the altar. The statue's cold, stone eyes seemed to pierce through me, locking onto mine. It was an unnerving sight, leaving me feelings helpless and mortified.   
I couldn't tear my eyes away from the statue. It was as if a powerful force held me in its grip, commanding me to stare. I felt a strange, unsettling connection to the figure, and it was as though the statue's gaze held some unfathomable secret.  
Just as I was about to lose myself completely in its stony visage, Michael grabbed my arm suddenly, jolting me back to reality. He leaned in close, his voice barely audible over the hushed prayers of the congregation.  
"Andy, stop staring," he whispered urgently. "Remember the rules."  
I blinked and tore my gaze away from the statue, my chest pounding. The rules Father Matthias had imparted upon me echoed in my mind, and I knew that I had come dangerously close to breaking one of them. St. Michael's was a place where even the statues seemed to hold mysteries, and I couldn't afford to forget the consequences of curiosity, whatever they may be.   
Mass continued, the solemn rituals unfolding as the congregation joined in prayer and reflection. I did my best to keep my gaze fixed on the hymnals, avoiding any temptation to look back at the unsettling statue of St. Agnes. But the feeling of being watched lingered, and it was a constant battle to keep my eyes forward. Eventually, my eyes did wander back to the statue, however briefly, and I saw that the statue was no longer staring at me. It was as if its head had turned to face another orphan while I was looking away. I shook this off, convincing myself that my eyes were merely playing tricks on me, but the sense of dread lingered.   
As the mass neared its conclusion, Father Matthias rose to address the congregation. "After today's service, I encourage all of you to visit the confessional booth," he announced, his voice carrying through the hallowed space. "It is a time for reflection and cleansing of the soul. Please, take this opportunity to unburden your hearts."  
The minutes stretched on as the congregation filed out of the pews, making their way to the confessional booths. I stood in line, my heart pounding with anxiety, the image of St. Agnes' statue still etched in my mind.  
Finally, it was my turn. I entered the confessional booth and sat in the small, dimly lit chamber. The wooden panel separating me from Father Matthias seemed impenetrable, but I knew this was the place to reveal my deepest secrets.  
The confessional booth seemed both comforting and foreboding, its walls embracing me like a cocoon while also trapping me in an unfamiliar darkness. I shifted on the hard wooden bench, my small frame hardly filling the space. The scent of old wood and incense clung to the air, a mixture of sanctity and solemnity.  
Father Matthias' voice emerged from the other side of the wooden partition, his tone gentle and inviting. "Speak, my child," he said softly, "what burdens your young heart?"  
I hesitated, uncertain how to put into words the fears and anxieties that had been weighing me down. But I knew that I had to share the truth about my mother, about the eyes in the darkness, about my own fear.  
"It's about my mom," I began, my voice quivering. "She had a... a breakdown, that’s what the doctor told me. She said she saw 'eyes in the darkness,' Father. It scared her so much."  
The confessional booth seemed to cocoon me in silence as Father Matthias absorbed my words. There was a profound understanding in his response. "I'm deeply sorry to hear about your mother's struggles, Andy. Such experiences can be frightening, especially for a young child."  
Tears welled up in my eyes as I continued. "But, Father, there's something I've never told anyone, not even the doctors. I saw those eyes too. In our old house, when it was dark, I saw them. But I didn't tell anyone because I was afraid they'd lock me away like they did with my mom."  
The confession felt like a heavy burden lifting from my young shoulders, and I waited anxiously for Father Matthias' response.  
There was a thoughtful pause on the other side of the partition. "Andy," Father Matthias finally spoke, his voice filled with compassion, "we all bear our own burdens, and sometimes, the truth can be a daunting thing to share. By opening your heart today, you've already taken a significant step toward healing."  
I wiped away the tears that had spilled onto my cheeks, grateful for Father Matthias' understanding. "What should I do, Father? How can I make up for being dishonest?"  
Father Matthias offered a suitable penance, instructing me to recite a particular prayer a certain number of times and to seek guidance from the Lord in moments of doubt and fear. We continued our conversation, delving into the depths of my soul and my struggles with faith and the inexplicable darkness that seemed to haunt me.  
As we spoke, time seemed to blur, and the confessional booth transformed into a sanctuary of understanding and solace. Father Matthias' words provided a comforting anchor in the turbulent sea of my fears.  
Finally, as our conversation neared its end, Father Matthias offered his absolution, and I left the confessional booth with a newfound sense of hope and determination. I knew that the shadows and secrets of St. Michael's were far from over, but perhaps through faith and confession, I could find a path toward understanding and salvation.  
After the confessional, I left with a heart lightened by my confession to Father Matthias. The day continued with classes and prayers, but I couldn't help but feel a newfound sense of peace and clarity within me.  
When the time for play in the courtyard finally arrived, I joined Michael and the other children in a game of tag. We darted around the overgrown grass, our laughter filling the air, momentarily erasing the ominous weight that seemed to hang over St. Michael's.  
However, my brief moment of happiness was shattered when Sarah, as if seeking an opportunity to torment me, joined our game. Her cold gaze fell upon me, and I knew that trouble was brewing.  
Sarah didn't waste any time; she pushed me roughly, sending me sprawling onto the uneven ground. Pain seared through my palm as it scraped against a jagged stone, and I clutched my injured hand, a searing cut dripping thin lines of blood.  
Michael rushed to my side, his face etched with concern. "Andy, are you okay?"  
Tears welled up in my eyes as I nodded, my injured hand throbbing. I knew I needed to seek help. With Michael's support, I made my way to the medical office of the church.  
Inside the small, dimly lit room, the head nun, Sister Catherine, waited for us. Her demeanor was as stern as I had come to expect, but there was a hint of warmth in her eyes as she assessed my injured hand.  
"What happened, Andy?" she asked, her voice carrying a maternal concern.  
I recounted the incident with Sarah, how she had pushed me, causing me to cut my hand. Sister Catherine nodded, her expression a mix of sympathy and disappointment.  
She gently cleaned and bandaged my wound, her touch surprisingly tender. Then, as she worked, she began to speak, her words revealing a startling connection.  
"You know, I knew your mother, Andy," she said, her voice softer now. "She came here when she was pregnant with you."  
I blinked in surprise, the mention of my mother catching me off guard. "You knew my mom?"  
Sister Catherine nodded, her gaze distant as she continued to treat my hand. "Yes, she sought refuge here during a difficult time in her life. She was carrying you then, and we provided her with shelter and support."  
I was overwhelmed by a rush of emotions. My mother, who had been the source of my earliest memories, was connected to this mysterious place in ways I couldn't have imagined. It was as if St. Michael's had been a part of my life since before I was born.  
As Sister Catherine finished tending to my hand, she offered me a reassuring smile. "Your mother faced many challenges, Andy, but she found strength here, just as you will. You're not alone in this journey."  
With her words, I felt a newfound sense of belonging, as if St. Michael's Church and Orphanage held the key to unlocking the mysteries of my past and the enigmatic shadows that seemed to follow me.  
I left the medical office with a bandaged hand, a swirl of emotions and questions whirling in my mind. The connection between my mother and St. Michael's was a revelation, but it also deepened the enigma surrounding this place. As I exited, another nun entered, giving me a tender smile as we crossed paths.   
As I rounded the corner of the doorway, I stopped to tie my shoe, the mundane task providing a brief moment of distraction from the mysteries that had unfolded. Unbeknownst to the nuns in the medical office, I overheard their conversation as they spoke just inside.  
The younger nun, her voice tinged with curiosity, asked Sister Catherine, "Is that boy the son of the woman who was here eight years ago?"  
There was a pause, and I could almost feel the weight of Sister Catherine's memories as she spoke. "She was a troubled soul, Mary. She struggled to follow the rules of this place. It was a challenging time for her."  
My heart sank as I listened to the conversation. It seemed that my mother's presence had left a lasting impression on St. Michael's, and her struggles were still remembered by the nuns.  
Curiosity gnawed at me, and I couldn't help but stay a moment longer, my ears straining to catch every word. Sister Mary hesitated before finally asking, "And what about the basement? I've heard rumors that she went down there."  
Sister Catherine's response was stern, and she cut off the conversation abruptly. "We do not speak of the basement, Sister. It's forbidden."  
I strained to hear more, my curiosity pushing me to listen. However, the nuns' conversation seemed to have ended, and I couldn't risk being caught eavesdropping.  
Scurrying away from the doorway, I made my way down the corridor just as I heard the nuns start to exit the medical office. The mention of the basement only added to the growing list of mysteries surrounding St. Michael's, and I was determined to uncover the truth, even if it meant breaking the rules.  
During the next class, I found myself sitting next to Michael, the ever-present sense of curiosity gnawing at me. The events of the past days had only deepened my need to understand the mysteries of St. Michael's. I leaned toward Michael, my voice a whisper.  
"Michael, can you tell me more about these rules Father Mat mentioned?" I asked, my eyes narrowing with intrigue. "Why shouldn't we stare at the statue during mass?"  
Michael hesitated for a moment, his gaze darting around the room. Finally, he leaned in, his voice barely audible. "Andy, the rules are... they're strange, but they're meant to protect us. Father Matthias says they keep us safe from things we can't understand."  
I nodded, absorbing his words, but my curiosity wasn't satisfied. "What about the rule for the confessional booth? What does Father Matt mean that things could seem.. ‘different’?"  
Michael glanced at me, his expression troubled. "In the confessional, Andy, you have to be careful. It's like... like a doorway, and if you're not careful, things can change. Always look around when you leave a confession.. if something’s.. off, you’ll know. Just shut your eyes and go back inside."  
My heart raced at the cryptic answer, but I pressed on, my voice trembling slightly. "And what about the basement, Michael? I heard the nuns talking about it, and it seemed important."  
Michael's face turned pale, and he shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He seemed reluctant to speak, his eyes avoiding mine. "The basement, Andy, it's... it's a place we're not supposed to go. It's off-limits for a reason. It's not safe."  
My curiosity burned brighter than ever, and I was determined to uncover the secrets of St. Michael's. But Michael's reaction to my question about the basement left me with an unsettling feeling that some things were better left unexplored. Despite the growing unease that hung over the church and orphanage, my determination to understand its mysteries remained unwavering.   
That night, my mind was filled with questions, curiosity burning like a fire within me. I wanted to learn more about my mother's time at St. Michael's, about the creation of the rules, and about the secrets hidden within the forbidden basement. Determination fueled my desire to uncover the truth.  
As Michael and I settled into our beds, the room plunged into darkness, the only source of light being the faint glow of the moon seeping through the curtains. The quiet of the night surrounded us, broken only by the soft rustling of the bedsheets.  
I couldn't sleep. Restlessly, I tossed and turned for what felt like hours, my mind consumed by the mysteries that lay just beyond my grasp.  
And then, in the dead of night, I heard it—a new voice, soft and haunting, echoing from the hallway outside our room. It whispered my name, trying its hardest to lure me out into the unknown.  
“Andy… come out and play… Andyyyy,” the voice cooed playfully.  
My heart raced, and I lay frozen beneath my blanket, my breath held. The voice continued to beckon, “Andy, come out. We can talk about your mother. I know all about her, Andy.”  
The door to our room unlocked from the outside, and it creaked open just a crack, letting in a sliver of the eerie, moonlit hallway. My instincts screamed at me to stay hidden, to resist the lure of the voice, but the desire to know was overpowering.  
I considered emerging from my hiding place, my curiosity threatening to overwhelm my fear. But instead, I chose to remain hidden, hoping to catch any information the voice might reveal.  
Slowly, the door inched closed and locked once more, and the voice retreated into the darkness of the hallway. With bated breath, I lay in my bed, my mind racing and my heart pounding. The secrets of St. Michael's were no closer, but I knew that the path to uncovering them was fraught with danger and uncertainty. Eventually, exhaustion claimed me, and I drifted into a restless sleep, haunted by the whispers of the night. Little did I know that this restless night would be nothing compared to what [St. Michael’s] (https://www.malevolentsin.com) had in store for me…
