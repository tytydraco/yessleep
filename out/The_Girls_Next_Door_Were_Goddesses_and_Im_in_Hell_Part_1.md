My beautiful wife, *She Who Remains Upon the Earth*, finally left me alone again.  It’s been about an hour and I don’t know when she’ll be back.  If you’re reading this, please let me know you’re real.  I can’t talk to anyone I know with her around, not my old friends, not the police, not even our parents.  She won’t let me, at least not in any way that matters.  I just need someone to know what happened to us and talk to someone without feeling her behind them.

I don’t even know where she is right now, just that she’s out doing something in town and could be back at any time.  Usually, this leaves me a few hours to breathe and finally move my body like it’s my own again.  I could go workout in the sun room.  The snare heads on my drumseat in the basement probably have dust I could clean off.  The hot tub on the back deck has a great view of the valley.  I know she’d love to join me if she finds me there when she gets home.

I still can’t leave though.  The doors are all unlocked, but I can’t make my hand turn the knob.  Once, I even tried breaking the front door down with an axe.  Got one good hit in on the mahogany just for my body to freeze up mid-swing.  She wasn't happy about that one.  Even when she’s gone, she won’t let me go.

I need to breathe.  She won’t let me leave, but I wanted to see if I can type.  My fingers seem to be moving fine so far, so that’s a good sign.  It’s so peaceful for now.  You won’t be able to save me anyway, so there’s no need to rush.  I can't open the door, so she probably already knows I’m doing this.  She won’t kill me though.  When she gets back, I’ll just apologize and wait until she’s gone again, not that she's ever been gone since we met.

It’s been almost twenty years since I first met the twins.  Looking back on it now, I think that was the earliest clear memory I have of my childhood.  Makes sense.  Everything always leads back to them.

It was an early summer morning, right after my elementary school let out for the break.  My friend Caleb, the only other kid my age in our neighborhood, was already away with his family on vacation, leaving me to play on my own.  I didn’t mind though.  I was already hard at work building dirt fortresses for my dinosaur toys in the backyard, the muddy rut by our tree filled with hose water for the armies to fight each other in.

“Nathan,” my mother called from the back porch.  “Having fun?”

“Yeah, Mom.  Just making a river.”

“Just try not to get muddy,” she said, knowing full well it was going to happen.  “The new neighbors should be here in a bit.  Dad and I are gonna see if they need any help, so stay in the yard where we can see you.”

“Okay, Mom.”

She went back inside and I looked through the short chainlink fence into the next yard over.  The grass had gotten overgrown in the summer weather, making it look like the woods out back were creeping up to the deck.  The old couple who used to live there had left I don’t know how long before, leaving the house on the corner of our block dark and empty.

I was so wrapped up in my own little game I almost didn’t notice the sound of the moving trucks pulling in next door.  The voices of several people, including my Mom and Dad, started chatting near the front.  Metal doors opened and shut for a while, mixed with sounds of men saying “Careful with that” and a woman shouting “Delila, wait for your sister!”

Barely a few seconds later, the back door to the house burst open.  Out ran a young girl about my age, dressed in grass-stained shoes and overalls.  Her fiery red hair was partly pulled back into a messy ponytail like she wouldn’t sit still long enough to finish it.  I was probably right because she jumped all the way down the steps and took off sprinting through the yard, arms out like an airplane and laughing with the widest grin I’d ever seen.  She leapt and spun and looked to the woods out back like she couldn’t wait to explore every inch of them.

Then, she looked at me.

“Hey!”

She dashed over to the fence, rattling the metal when she bounced onto it.  I was shocked, both by her energy and how fast she made it across the yard.  Both her smile and stormy grey eyes were wide and shining when she looked at me.

“You have dinosaurs?!” she shouted.  “That’s awesome!  Do you wanna play with me?”

“I-”

“Lila.”

A different, softer voice called out across the yard.  Another girl stepped out of the backdoor, this one in a blue dress with a head of wavy, raven hair.

“Mom said not to-” She stopped when she noticed me.  Her eyes, the same grey as the girl at the fence, met mine and she started to walk over to us.

“Come on!” said the redhead, turning her back to me.  “I just wanted to see everything.  Look!  We have a new neighbor, and he’s got toys!”

The other girl slowly walked across the yard to the fence line, holding her hands behind her back and stepping with more grace than a kid our age should have had.  I thought she looked like a princess.  She made it over to us and looked at me with curiosity.  Her face and eyes were the same as the first girl's, but she didn’t have the same wild energy.  Her expression was focused and calculating, her eyes studying me.

“I’m Lila!” the first one said, pointing a thumb at herself.  “This is my sister, Nora.”

“Hello,” she said softly.  “It’s nice to meet you.”

“... hi,” I finally spat out.  “Mom and Dad said the new neighbors would be here today.  My name’s Nathaniel.”

Lila laughed.  “That’s not a kid’s name.  I’m gonna call you Nate!”

“Don’t be rude, Delila,” Nora said, scowling a bit while her sister stuck her tongue out.  She looked back at me with a small smile.  “I think Nathaniel is a great name.”

“Thanks, but it’s okay.  Most people call me Nate or Nathan anyway.  Whatever you want to say is good.”

“Nathan.”  As if to prove my point, my Mom called to me from the neighbors back porch.  Next to her stood a woman with black hair like Nora’s.  She was young, probably younger than my parents, but just the look in her eyes betrayed how tired she was.

“Girls,” she said, sounding exhausted.  “I told you not to run off.”

“Sorry, Mom,” said Nora calmly.  “Lila ran outside without asking again.”

“No I didn't!" Lila shot back defiantly.  “I asked if we could look around!”

“That doesn’t mean you get to run off.  What if you got hurt or broke something?”

“I was just having fun!  Isn’t that right, Nate?”

“Uh…” I wasn’t sure how to respond, or how I got into the middle of the sister’s bickering.  The two kept at it, the annoyance in Nora’s voice making it through her mature tone, while Lila made it very clear she thought she had done nothing wrong.

Their mom ran both hands through her unkempt hair, mouthing something to Mom that looked like an apology.  Her face was trembling like she was about to cry.  Mom smiled at her and said something I’m sure was reassuring, but it didn’t seem to help much.  The girls just kept arguing, so I decided to try something.

“Do you both wanna come over?”

The twins finally stopped to look at me.  Their mom raised her head and wiped her misty eyes, surprised but thankful for the silence.

“I just made a river for my dinosaurs, and I’ve got a swing in my tree you can use.  We can play other stuff too if you want.”

“Yes!” Lila shouted excitedly, clasping her hands together.  “Can I be the Spinosaurus?  Please?”

“You cried while watching that movie,” Nora said with a sigh.

“I’ll let you,” I said, making her wild smile even bigger, “but you should ask your mom first.”

Lila turned back and ran to the porch while Nora whispered *Thank you*, barely audible yet crystal clear, like she was talking right into my ear.

“Please can we play with Nate, Mom?  I’m sorry I ran.”

“That’s okay, sweetheart,” she said with a sniffle.  “I know you were just excited.  And I don’t want to impose…”

“Not at all, Ellen,” Mom chimed in.  “Nathan’s been cooped up since school let out.  It’ll be good for the kids to let out some energy.  Now, let’s get some more of your stuff put away.  They’ll be safe in the yard.”

“Thank you, but I’m not sure if-”

“Mom,” Nora said gently.  Her grey eyes stared directly at her mother.  “Please.”

It took her just one second too long to respond.  “Okay, girls.  Just be careful.”

“Stay in the yard,” my Mom added, “and don’t climb the big tree.  I’ll come check on you guys in a bit.”

“We’ll be careful!” Lila said, her eyes beaming.  She gave her mom a tight hug before they went back inside.  Our moms had barely shut the backdoor when she dashed and vaulted just over the top of the fence, landing right in front of me.

“Wow!” I said, stunned.

“Thanks!” she replied before laughing loudly and sprinting over to the muddy river.

Nora sighed and walked over to the gate between our yards.  I beat her over to the door and held it open the way I’d seen Dad do for Mom.  She let out a gentle laugh and hummed while we walked toward where Lila was already ankle deep in mud.

“Your parents are really nice,” she said beside me.  “They’re helping Mom in the house.  She doesn’t usually talk to new people, but they’re good.  And you’re good too, Nathaniel.  I can tell.”

“Thanks,” I said, embarrassed.  “Is your dad over there too?”

Her expression lowered and I immediately knew I shouldn’t have asked that.

“He’s not here.”

I didn’t ask what she meant.

“Come on, slowpokes!  Nate, you’re on my team for Dinosaur War!”

“I’ll just watch for now,” Nora said, walking towards the swing.  “You’re just gonna get dirty.”

“Too late for that,” said Lila.  “You wanna be the T-Rex, Nate?  I won't eat you too much!”

I looked at her, a living fireball that jumped between the riverbanks with a surprisingly good roar, and smiled.

“Sure, sounds fun.”

We played together for hours.  Lila and I clashed our toys together in the stream, making a huge mess I knew Mom wouldn’t be happy about.  I didn’t care about that though.  Laughing and playing with her was the easiest thing in the world.

Nora watched us from the tree swing, often asking me to come give her another push.  I carefully wiped the mud from my hands and pushed her until she was laughing too.

Lila would make up new games for all of us when she got bored, which happened every few minutes.  Tag.  Hide and seek.  Swordfighting with sticks.  Eventually, Nora suggested cloud watching, which Lila agreed to if the game was to find the coolest looking cloud.

“That one looks like a flower.”

“That one’s a racecar.”

“That’s a giant snake eating the sun!  I win!”

“Not everything has to be a competition,” said Nora.

“True,” I agreed.  “Her’s was the coolest though.”

Lila smiled and jumped up to her feet.  “New game!”  She scanned the yard looking for what to do next before looking up from the swing to the top of our tree.

“Lila,” said Nora.  “Don’t.  His mom said not-”

“Let’s go, Nate!”  She pulled me up and towards the tree.  “Highest climber wins!”

She was off in a flash of red, scurrying up the branches so fast the squirrels my Dad hated would have been jealous.  I watched wide-eyed while Nora stepped beside me with a disapproving look.

“You’re like Spider-Man!” I yelled up to her.  She looked down from her branch with a proud, toothy grin.

“You bet I am!  Come on, Nate.  It’s your turn!”

I felt a hand on my arm.  “Nathaniel, don’t.  We’re gonna get in trouble.”

“I… I’ll be fine,” I said with as much confidence as a six year-old could muster.  “Watch.  I’m a good climber.”  One branch at a time, I slowly made my way up while Nora said something about ‘idiots.’

It took me a lot longer to reach Lila than I would have liked.  By the time I got up to her branch, she was hanging upside down and letting out a yawn I couldn’t tell was real or not.

“Slowpoke.”

“I still got to the same one,” I said, trying my best to balance and fighting the urge to look down.  “That means we’re tied.”

“Okay then.  Next game… is the best landing!”

Before I could stop her, she pulled herself up and swung out.  She flipped through the air and landed with a clean somersault, jumping up next to her sister with a twirl and a bow.  Nora just pinched her brow and both looked up at me.

“Beat that!”

“Do NOT beat that!”

I was still so in shock from Lila’s jump I almost didn’t realize how high up I was.  Despite my boast, I really wasn’t much of a climber.  The ground looked like it was swirling below me and the girls were little more than a pair of red and black spots.

Both of them were yelling.  Jump.  Don’t jump.  I’ll catch you.  You’ll get hurt.  Do a flip.

I made up my mind.  Boys have been doing stupid stuff to impress girls since the dawn of time.  This was just my turn.

I jumped.

And I tried to do a flip.

The ground came at me faster than I realized it would.  I braced myself for the impact that honestly may have killed me, if something hadn't slowed me down.  I couldn’t move anything, but it felt like being scooped up in Dad’s arms when he would pretend to drop me and catch me at the last second.  A warm, invisible pressure trying to hold me in place.  Nora was covering her mouth, looking up at me in fear, while Lila gritted her teeth and held up both her arms.  I still hit the ground with a thud, but it was much softer than it should have been.

When I finally looked up, my breathing was ragged, my vision still blurry.  Lila dropped her arms and fell to her knees breathing harder than I was.

“Idiots,” Nora said with a mix of anger and concern.  “I told you not to do that.  Both of you.”

“H-he’s fine,” Lila said between breaths.  Her eyes were wide and her forced smile was filled with worry.  “You’re fine.  Right, Nate?  P-please be fine.”

I tried to move when a sharp pain came from my knee, a thin line of blood coming from a good-sized scrape.  The stinging made my fear worse.  My breaths got shorter when Nora knelt down beside me, holding my hand in hers and placing a finger just above my knee.

*Shhh.  You’re okay.  Everything’s okay.  I’m right here.*

Her lips didn’t move.  Her voice was clear as day while she smiled at me, but no words came from her mouth.  Her touch was cool and soothing.  The panic in my mind and the pain in my knee fell away, drowned in a wave of calm like I’d never felt before.  I looked down to see the wound was still open, but the sting was completely gone.  I tried to say something when I heard the sound of sobbing.

“I-I’m sorry!” said Lila, tears welling in her eyes.  “I shouldn’t have done that.  I… I was bad.  I was bad and I got you hurt!  Please don’t be mad at me.  Please!  I didn't mean for you to fall.  I don't want to be bad.  I’m sorry!”

She was a sobbing mess when she told me “I’ll never let you get hurt again!”

“It…it’s okay, Lila.  See?” I said, pointing at my knee.  “It’s like a cool battle scar.  Plus, you won, and you don’t cry if you win.”

It took a few seconds, but she smiled, for real this time, and wiped her tears on her sleeves.  “I… I did beat you, didn’t I?  Was I cool?”

“The coolest.”

I started to smile back at her when Nora looked at me, her grey eyes focused and sharp.

“You can’t tell anyone.”

“You mean Lila catching me?” I asked.  “How did she do that, and how did I hear you talk?  I feel-”

“Please, don’t tell anyone!” Lila added, grabbing my other hand.  “We’ll get in a lot of trouble.”

“Now you’re worried about getting in trouble?” Nora said dryly.  “Please, just promise you won’t tell.”

“I-”

“If you promise,” said Lila, “we’ll promise to be your best friends forever!”

I looked at her and then to Nora, who smiled and nodded her head.

“Okay.  I promise.”

They both smiled and spoke in unison.  “Then we promise too!  Forever!”

We all had dinner together at my house that night.  My parents asked the girls what their favorite foods were before they went to clean up.  Nora told Mom she liked chicken and noodles while Lila asked for the biggest steak we had.  Their mom told her to pick something else, but Dad looked proud of the answer and said he’d make the best steak she’d ever tasted.  The girls cleaned up back at their house and Mom gave me a bath while Dad started on the food.

“So,” she said, putting a bandage on my knee from when I ‘tripped’, “you look like you had fun with the girls today.  Which one do you like more?”

“Mom!”

“Nora is so polite and sweet, like a little grown up.  But you had such a big smile while you and Lila chased each other.  So cute.”

“Mom, I don’t like them.  Girls are gross.”

“Oh, you think they're gross?  I’m gonna tell them.”

“No!”

She just laughed.  I miss when she did that.

Dinner was delicious.  Their mom brought over a pot of breaded mac and cheese I still have the recipe too.  She apologized for not having more stuff ready to make, but Mom and Dad told her she didn’t have to make a thing.  Lila, now not covered in mud, devoured her steak like an actual dinosaur.  Nora told her mind her manners, but she smiled when she said it.  

We all played games in the living room that night.  Checkers and puzzle pieces were everywhere.  Dad eventually brought out his old guitar and played a few lines from some old song while Mom played on the piano.  I clapped along to the beat while Lila danced across the carpet.  For someone so high-energy, she moved perfectly, like she had choreographed the whole thing beforehand.  Nora sang along with my Dad, who let her take over after hearing her voice.  She didn’t just look like an angel, she sounded like one too.

And, through it all, their mother watched her daughters, and I heard her laugh for the first time.  She wiped a tear from her tired eyes at the girls' finale, hugged them tight, and told them they were both incredible.  She complimented us as well, but my parents said the girls stole the show.  I agreed.  I couldn’t stop watching them either.

That night, after the girls had said goodnight and gone home, I had the first dream I remember having.

I stepped into the hallway to get a drink of water, but I didn’t step onto our wooden floors.  Instead, my foot sank into something cold and wet.  My ears rang with the muffled sounds of men shouting echoing from both directions in the dark.  I turned back into my room just to see it wasn’t my room anymore.

A young woman with black hair and a blood-stained uniform was bandaging what remained of a man’s leg. He laid silent, his blank eyes staring into mine.  She told me to grab something from the next room, so I did.

I opened it and stepped onto a cobblestone street.  Smoke and soot from chimney stacks filled the night air and a girl with ragged clothes, hair like fire, and bloody knuckles grabbed my arm.  She handed me a golden chain and told me to run back to our hiding spot, so I did.

Every room was a new scene, a new place, and new, terrible orders wrapped up in loving whispers and joy-filled laughter.

I climbed on the ship.  Go below deck.
I ran through the woods.  Go to the church.
I walked through the halls.  Go to her room.

I did everything I was told.  I still do everything I’m told.  I am so sick of doing everything I'm told.

Eventually, once my legs felt like they would fall out from under me, I stopped and sat.

The smell of rain and wet grass filled the air while I sat on a rock.  Behind me in the distance, small hearths burned in a village I couldn’t remember the name of, if it even had a name, but I knew it was mine.  In front of me was a field giving way to rolling foothills and mountains.  Their silhouettes stood out like a void against the bright blanket of stars filling the sky.  I had never seen so many while I was awake, and even more appeared as the last rays of sunlight fell behind the horizon.  I laid on my back and looked up to the heavens, mesmerized.

Then, heaven fell.  Stars showered across the sky, dancing in a performance just for me.  Most faded back into the darkness, but two, burning silver and more beautiful than the others, struck the mountain.  I grabbed my crook and left my flock.  I walked to the place where the stars came to Earth.

When I reached the base, two lights glided down from the peaks.  One traveled slowly while the other danced among the trees.  Both headed towards me.

When they neared me, I screamed.  They had twisted, shimmering forms like water and smoke clouding my eyes.  Staring at them cracked my mind like stone.  The sound of river rapids rushed in my ears and my bones felt crushed by the air itself.  One reached out to me, the light so bright it didn’t matter how hard I closed my eyes.  I fell on my face and begged them to leave or kill me or whatever they would do as long the pain stopped, my cries coming out in a language I didn't know.  They whispered to each other in voices like thunder.  The light dimmed and the pain went away.

When I opened my eyes, the figures my mind wouldn't let me remember we're gone.  In their place stood two young women, their bare skin glowing like dawn and dusk.  Their eyes belonged in the skies, their shifting faces beautiful and just human enough to fool me.

“I’m very sorry,” said *The Burning One*, a name I knew but hadn't heard.  “I didn't mean to hurt you.”

“You do not think, sister,” said *The Shadow Out of Heaven*. “Must I follow you everywhere?”

“I didn't know they would be so… weak.”

“You have watched them.  They are fragile and…” She rubbed her arms while her sister shivered. “...freezing.”

I offered my cloak to one and what furs I could spare to the other.  They huddled close while I prepared a fire.  I gave them food from my pack and bowed before them.

“Are you goddesses?”

*What is a goddess to you?* came a voice in my mind.  I looked up at the two of them, the light from their bodies dimming further, save for the eyes that stared through my soul.

“A god is…” I hesitated, unsure of what to say to them, “... something powerful.  Something to be worshipped.  Their chosen ones leave them offerings and the gods give blessings and gifts.”

“You may call us that,” one said, stones twirling in the air between her fingers.  “Are you a god then?  You’re the one giving gifts, not us.”

“No, I’m a man.”

“We have watched you all for a time,” said the other, her eyes fixed on me. “My sister wanted to know more, and I am curious too.  These forms are… interesting.”

“There are many of us down the mountain.  I can lead you there.”

“Not without a gift from us!” Her voice wasn't threatening, but it boomed throughout the valley.  The cool wind itself followed her voice, rustling against the furs I'd given her. 

“Gods give gifts, right?!”

“You are too loud, sister, but you are right.”

“As always!”
 
“Though, we have nothing to give for your kindness,” she said, wrapping my cloak tighter around herself.

“Then we will find things!” She turned to me, her smile beaming.  “And you will be my chosen!

“Perhaps he would choose me instead, sister.”

The light began to shine in their eyes and the pain in my mind and bones began again.

“I… can be both.” They looked at me, eyes dimming.  I bowed to these living things the way the elders bowed to their idols.  “It would… be an honor.  If it would please you.”

They looked to each, then back to me, and nodded.  We would wait for daybreak to move, so I closed my eyes while feeling theirs on me.

I woke up to the sound of a doorbell ringing, tucked into bed like I’d never left it.  I walked downstairs to see Lila and Nora standing with their mother while she gave a quick thank you to Mom and ran out the door.

“Nate!  Mom got called into work today.  Let’s go play!”

“We should eat breakfast first, Lila.  Thank you, Nathaniel's Mom.”

“No problem, girls,” Mom said with a smile.  “Nathan, change your clothes and come downstairs.  We're making pancakes.”

“Be fast, Nate!”

“Don't keep us waiting.”

I did what I was told, my dream fading from my mind when the smell of sugar and syrup filled the air.  It's amazing what a kid’s mind will just accept and move on from.  Ignorance really is bliss.

Their mom worked at the hospital and always picked up shifts when she could.  There were times the girls spent more nights sleeping over in our living room than their own beds. Mom and Dad never said a word though.  I think they knew how hard their mom was trying.  I once saw her try to give my parents a piece of paper from her wallet, but they smiled and told her to keep it.

They quickly became the center of my world.  Summer was riding bikes around the neighborhood, Lila always seeming to rebalance herself on a turn where she should have fallen, and Nora telling us to slow down while she smiled.

Fall meant rides to school in Dad's car, jumping into piles of leaves, and Nora wanting to watch scary movies next to me on the couch while Lila hid behind me.

Winter was filled with snowmen and snow angels.  I’d throw a snowball at Lila and it would orbit her like a planet before shooting back at my face.  When Nora stood next to me, I didn't know if it was her gift warming me up or something else.

Spring brought back warmer weather, swimming down at the river, and a huge birthday party with all our friends.  We shared a birthday.  What are the odds?

I’d give anything to go back, even if it meant ending up where I am now.  Seeing Lila's smile when she made a goal in the backyard.  Hearing Nora read a story to me under the shade of the old tree.  They were just girls then, their names were just Lila and Nora, and I was just the idiot boy next door who didn't know what was coming.

We were us.

The air feels heavy.  *She’ll* be home soon.  I’ll make her something sweet, warm up the tub on the deck, and get the wine glasses ready.  My offerings to her.

I don't know what’s gonna happen to me now, what she's gonna do to me, but I’ll hope for the best and write again when I can.  

My goddess is almost here.

Don't waste your prayers on me.
