I need to write this down while I still can. I don’t know if they’re coming back for me, or if I even have much time left before… something happens. The truth is, I’m not even sure what did happen.

My name’s Henry Striker. I’m 34. I guess you could call me a YouTuber, though that’s not really true—I never posted anything. I had plans. Big ones. But after this, I don’t think I’ll ever hit upload.

I’ve always loved the outdoors. I grew up camping, hiking, all that Boy Scout stuff. Being out there always felt natural to me, like I belonged. So when I decided I wanted to start a channel, I figured solo camping vlogs would be perfect.

That’s what brought me to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I drove in, stopped at a little town on the edge of the park to grab some last-minute supplies, and then headed into the wilderness—my “home away from home” for the next week. Or at least, that was the plan.

I hiked deep into the forest, further than most people ever bother to go. The air was alive with birdsong, and a cool breeze cut through the heavy summer heat. The scent of moss, dirt, and sun-warmed grass clung to everything. It was the kind of air that fills your lungs and makes you believe, if only for a moment, that you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be.

I found a clearing about half a mile from a small creek—secluded, quiet, perfect. It felt like mine the second I saw it. I pitched my tent, set up camp, and told myself I’d start recording tomorrow. Tonight would just be about soaking it all in.

By the time I gathered enough firewood, the sun was already sinking behind the trees. I built a fire, simple but steady, and cooked myself an easy meal over the flames. As I ate, the sky darkened, and one by one the stars began to pierce through the twilight, until it seemed like there were more of them than I’d ever seen before.

It was beautiful, the type of beauty that takes your breath or makes your heart skip a beat. But one star in particular caught my eye. It wasn’t like the others. It pulsed, almost like it was breathing, flaring bright before fading to nothing, only to return again. I told myself it was just a plane, but deep down, I wasn’t convinced.

Eventually I doused the fire and crawled into my tent. I didn’t want to fall asleep under the open sky and wake up half-eaten by mosquitoes. I zipped myself into my sleeping bag, warm and comfortable, and for the first time in a long while, I drifted into a deep, easy sleep.

The kind of sleep I haven’t had since that night. The kind of sleep I may never have again.

When morning came, I unzipped the tent, GoPro in hand, ready to film my first introduction video. I wanted to capture the moment. The start of what could be my breakout moment. But as soon as I stepped out and looked around, the camera slipped from my hand and hit the dirt.

Because what I saw waiting for me… was impossible.

My campsite was a wreck. At first I thought an animal had gotten into it, but the longer I looked, the less sense it made. Nothing was torn apart or chewed through. Instead, every single item I owned had been moved—arranged.

My gear was scattered across the clearing like someone had laid it out on display. Pots and pans balanced on tree branches, my portable stove propped perfectly upright in the dirt, tools lined up in a row. Each thing placed with a strange, deliberate care.

No animal could’ve done that.

I gathered everything up, trying to convince myself it was just some prank, though I knew that wasn’t true. I should have packed up right then and left. Looking back, I still don’t know why I didn’t. Maybe I was stubborn. Maybe I was stupid. Either way, I stayed. I stayed one more night.

The rest of the day passed in uneasy silence. Nothing else happened. Not until the sun set. That’s when the nightmare began.

I lay beneath the stars again, pretending it was all normal. But that star—the one that pulsed—was back. This time, it wasn’t just flickering. It looked bigger. Closer.

A sharp crack broke the quiet, and I whipped my head toward the treeline. For a moment my heart nearly stopped—then a deer stepped into the clearing. It saw me, froze, then bounded back into the forest.

I let out a shaky breath and turned my eyes back to the sky. The star was gone. My chest tightened until I spotted it again, a little to the left, shining brighter than ever.

That’s when I realized it wasn’t twinkling.

It was moving.

And it was getting closer.

Then it came. A sound I’ll never forget. A horrible, ragged scream. The kind of sound an animal makes only once, right before it dies. It was coming from just beyond the treeline. The deer. The same one I had just seen.

I turned toward the noise, heart hammering, and that’s when I saw them.

Lights.

Glowing orbs drifting between the trees, weaving through the dark like they were alive. At first there was just one. Then another blinked into existence. Then two more. Four of them now, gliding silently, heading straight for me.

One broke free of the trees and slid into the clearing. The moment it did, my campsite was swallowed in a blinding, white light so bright it erased the world.

I must have blacked out, because the next thing I knew, I was already running. Barreling through the forest, lungs burning, sweat pouring down my face. I don’t know how long I’d been at it—minutes, maybe longer—but I couldn’t stop.

When I finally dared to glance behind me, my stomach dropped. The orbs were there. Following me. Keeping pace, floating effortlessly between the trees.

I screamed and whipped my head forward—just in time to collide, full force, with something solid. For a split second I thought it was a tree.

But it wasn’t.

What stood in front of me was not human.

I’m 5’10, but this thing towered over me—easily two, maybe three feet taller. Its frame was impossibly thin, almost skeletal, but when I slammed into it at full speed it didn’t so much as flinch. It was like hitting a stone pillar.

It wasn’t wearing clothes. Its skin was bare, a grayish-purple that seemed to shift and ripple in the light of the orbs behind it. The head was wrong—too big for its spindly body, stretched and elongated. And then there were the eyes.

They were massive, jet black, but not smooth like glass. Fine white lines crisscrossed through them, forming perfect hexagons, as though I was staring into a hive that went on forever.

I screamed. I screamed so loud my throat tore, praying someone—anyone—might hear me, that somehow I wouldn’t be alone in that forest with this thing.

It didn’t move. It just lifted one long, stick-thin arm, ending in three elongated fingers. Slowly, it reached forward and pressed a single fingertip to my forehead.

The instant it touched me, everything collapsed into darkness.

When I came to, I was strapped to a table in a vast, empty room. The walls seemed to stretch forever, featureless and smooth, humming with a low vibration I could feel more than hear. My vision was blurred, my ears muffled, like I was underwater.

And then it leaned over me.

The same creature, its enormous head just inches from my face. I broke down, sobbing, begging—pleading—for it to let me go. I didn’t care how pathetic I sounded. I wanted to live. I kept asking why me? I’m a nobody. Just a guy with a camera. Why would something like this want me? Was it just because I was there? Wrong place, wrong time?

It didn’t answer. It didn’t even blink.

Instead, it raised one hand and waved it slowly over my face. Instantly, my body went limp. My panic didn’t fade—not in my mind. In my head I was still screaming, thrashing, clawing for escape. But my body betrayed me, going silent and still, pinned down by something I couldn’t fight. Even my eyes resisted. I could only move them a fraction, and the strain made tears leak down the sides of my face.

I had no choice but to watch.

The creature lifted its arm. With a deliberate twist of its wrist, the skin along its forearm split open, and something slid out—thin, metallic-looking, like a needle growing straight from its flesh. At the tip was a dark opening, hollow and waiting.

Then I saw movement.

From within that opening, something alive began to emerge—a wormlike appendage, branching into several writhing heads, each snapping and curling independently as it reached for me.

And it was coming closer.

The thing shoved the needle-like appendage straight up my nose. The pain was immediate and indescribable—sharp and searing, like my skull was being drilled from the inside out. I could feel the worm-like growth writhing through my sinuses, twisting, burrowing deeper.

When it finally slid the needle back out, my nose and upper lip were slick with blood. The tip of the thing was crimson, dripping. If it noticed, it didn’t care. The appendage retracted into its wrist with a wet, sucking sound, vanishing beneath the skin as though it had never been there.

Then the real pain started.

A crushing pressure exploded in my skull, like a demolition derby was happening inside my head. My body convulsed violently, every muscle seizing at once. I couldn’t breathe. My jaw locked tight, tongue threatening to block my airway. My vision shrank down to a tiny, trembling tunnel of light. I thought I was dying.

And then—just as suddenly—it all stopped.

Air rushed back into my lungs. My body went slack. I could feel myself again, even tried to sit up, but something invisible still pinned me to the table. My chest heaved as I turned my head toward the creature.

It was staring into me with those impossible, hexagon-filled eyes. Studying me. Measuring me.

Then, for the first time, it spoke.

It touched one long finger to the side of its head and a voice—not from its mouth, but inside my skull—said:

“Implantation complete. This one is compatible.”

My throat was raw, but I forced the words out: “Compatible with what?”

The creature didn’t answer. It just raised its hand again, touched its temple, and spoke once more:

“Proceeding with full DNA extraction.”

The words echoed in my skull like a verdict.

The alien didn’t move for a moment, just stared at me, unblinking. Then a section of the wall behind it rippled open as though the metal itself had turned to liquid. From it, a set of instruments emerged—sleek, silver, impossibly thin. They floated into the air on their own, humming softly, their movements precise, deliberate, like scalpels guided by invisible hands.

I tried to fight, to twist free, but the invisible weight pressing me into the table only grew heavier. My chest rose and fell in shallow, panicked bursts.

The first instrument lowered toward my arm. A fine beam of white light scanned the skin, then made a soundless incision. No blade, no blood—just a seam opening up as neatly as if I were no more than fabric being cut. My nerves screamed, but there was no physical pain. Only the unbearable pressure of being opened.

Another tool descended, sliding into the incision, extracting something I couldn’t see. A sickening tug deep inside my bones, like they were being hollowed out molecule by molecule. I couldn’t look away.

The alien remained still, its enormous eyes locked on mine. Those hexagonal patterns in its gaze seemed to shift and rearrange, like data being processed.

“Sample integrity confirmed,” the voice said in my head, flat and clinical. “Proceeding.”

More instruments descended. My veins lit up like fire as something was drawn out of me—blood, marrow, essence, I didn’t know. All I could do was stare into those black, perfect eyes, paralyzed, while they stripped me apart with the efficiency of a machine.

There was no malice in it. No cruelty.

Just procedure.

Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore. I shut my eyes, tried to block it all out. The instruments, the pulling, the sensation of being hollowed out. At some point, my mind must have broken, because I slipped into unconsciousness.

When I came to, I was no longer on the table. I sat upright in a chair, my wrists and ankles still restrained, in a room that looked almost identical to the last—smooth walls, featureless, sterile.

Across from me sat three of them. Identical. Each the same height, same skeletal frame, same impossible eyes threaded with hexagons. No markings, no differences, nothing to set them apart. They might as well have been copies of one another.

My voice cracked as I begged them to let me go, to tell me what was happening.

Their reply froze the blood in my veins.

They told me they had implanted one of their own inside me. That the worm-like creature wasn’t a tool or a parasite—it was one of them. And now it had fused with my brain. That was why I could understand them. I wasn’t hearing their voices. I was hearing the one inside me.

I started sobbing, shaking my head, but they continued with perfect calm. They explained that most humans—earthlings, they called us—aren’t compatible hosts. That’s why they needed my DNA. To replicate me. To make more bodies they could implant with their own kind.

When I asked why—why they would do this, why they would use us like this—they tilted their heads in eerie unison, almost puzzled by the question.

“To integrate with your kind more easily,” one of them finally said, its voice cold and flat inside my skull. “Conquering a planet is far simpler from within. Less damage to the resources.”

My chest tightened. “What resources? Please—we could work something out. You don’t have to conquer us.”

The three of them leaned forward at once, those endless black eyes reflecting me back a thousand times over.

“You creatures are the resource.”

I broke down, pleading, screaming anything that might change their minds. But they were already finished with me. One raised a long finger to its temple again.

“Now we will return you. Go, and spread our seed.”

That’s the last thing I remember before waking up in my truck, parked just outside the entrance to the park. My clothes were clean. My gear was packed neatly in the back. The sun was coming up, like nothing had happened.

But I know better.

I wanted to believe it was all just some bad dream. It wasn’t. I know it wasn’t. I know because I can feel it in me.

Every word I speak I have to fight for against the thing in my head. Write this was a struggle of its own. But the dead give away is my head. Under my hair I can feel it. Like veins bulging out from under the skin. And I can start to see the lines forming in my eyes when I look in the mirror.

They’re coming for us and we’ll never even see them coming. Soon, we will be walking among you unnoticed.
