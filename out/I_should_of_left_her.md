Genea is my girlfriend. She's 23. I’m 22. She was born on December 31st. I’ve always tried to be the best boyfriend I can be.
But the smallest mistakes set her off. If I forget to make the bed, she’ll sarcastically thank me and go silent. Then she’ll turn around and flirt with other guys right in front of me—laughing, complimenting them, acting like I don’t exist.

And still, I stay. I don’t even know why. I feel empty without her. I know it’s pathetic.

Eventually, I get tired of the emotional rollercoster. I start pulling away. That’s when she starts pulling in—being nicer, softer. It’s like the less I care, the more she does. That shift... it does something to me. I start feeling powerful. The worse I treat her, the more addicted she seems to become. And honestly? I get off on it. I feel like I could have anyone. I feel untouchable.

But then her birthday rolls around—December 31st—and I don’t even say happy birthday. No gift. Nothing. My ego’s inflated like a balloon ready to pop. I’m texting other girls, playing it off as “just friends.” One girl starts crying and screaming at me. Genea just smiles.

She hugs me and whispers, “I’m happy I have you.”
She kisses me. Acts like everything’s okay.
I assume shes just idealizing me again—but I couldn’t be more wrong.

She starts cooking my favorite meals. Overfeeding me. Treating me like royalty. Meanwhile, I keep being cold, cruel. And then she starts growing this massive plant in the garden. I’m 6’2”, and it’s almost as tall as me. It looks... alive. It has trumpet-shaped flowers—white and deep purple. The leaves alternate in a way that makes it stand out. I find myself staring at her taking care of it for hours. The way Genea takes care of it, talks to it— Im falling harder for her again.

But I’m scared. Because if I treat her well, I know she’ll go back to treating me like shit. So I stay cruel.
She starts giving me my favorite snack bars—daily. I love them, even though they leave my mouth dry. But like I tell myself, even roses have thorns. I gain weight fast. Every day, she gives me more.
When I’m without her, I get angry. I can’t sleep. My anxiety spirals.
But when I’m next to her, I become weirdly focused. Creative. I start drawing all over the walls—beautiful art I didn’t even know I was capable of. I felt alive and complete because of her, however I can’t stand for long. My heart races like it’s trying to escape my chest.
One day, as I’m painting, she asks, “Hey love, can you draw me?”
I say, “Sorry, I only draw beautiful things.”
She says nothing.

Later, she hands me more bars, more than usual, and a frozen bottle of water. She leans in and whispers in my ear, “Baby, please love me.” Her voice is soft, sultry. It makes me twitch.
“Why should I?” I snap.
She backs away, furious. “FUCK YOU. I try so hard. WE’RE DONE.”
She storms out. I try to call her back—“I’m just joking!”—but she doesn’t return.
I lose it. I throw a plate at the wall. I feel hollow. I crawl back to the bars and devour them. They taste like her.
Then there’s a knock at the door.
I open it. I see three Geneas.
Not just lookalikes—her. All of them. Same voice. Same eyes. Same smirk.

They tell me she cloned herself, because one of her wasn’t enough for me to love her. I talk to one, while another is—doing things to me—and the third just watches me from afar, eyes burning with jealousy.
Suddenly, their faces distort. One of them flips upside down. I scream and point. The others turn to look, then spin their heads toward me, laughing in unison.
Then they shrink.

Children. Three tiny Geneas now giggling and saying in sync, “Catch us, and we’ll give you a reward.”
I run. I strip—sweating, panicking. They dash off into the dark corners of my home.
And then there’s a man in my bedroom. He stares at me calmly.

We start talking—about geography, of all things. I ask him about Genea. He looks confused.
“What are you talking about? They don’t exist.”
I point to a pile of clothes. “She’s hiding in there!”
I hear her singing—some lullaby that makes my heart ache.

“Open it,” he says.
I do. Nothing inside.
“Who are you?” I ask.
“I’m you,” he replies. “But I’m not real. And neither are you.”
“What?”
“What are you looking at?”
I pause. “You.”
“No. Look again.”
And that’s when I realize—I’ve been talking to a mirror.
He laughs. Melts.
Then the shadow people arrive.
They have Genea’s voice. Taunting. Singing. Telling me to catch them.

I haven’t slept in days. I’ve been talking to shadows, to her. I bleed when I shit. When I piss. When I cough. My house bends and twists like a funhouse nightmare. I try to put on clothes—they turn to sand in my hands.
I cry in the corner.

They surround me. Genea’s everywhere. Mocking me. Telling me I can’t win.
I grab the gun. I shoot at them. The bullets pass right through. They laugh.
“Missed me! You can’t catch me!”
They close in.

I’m hot. Naked. Sweating. One bullet left.
The gun becomes sand and falls through my fingers.
I don’t want this anymore.
I scream.
Darkness.

Then light.
I wake up in a pure white room. It’s peaceful. Beautiful. Everything feels... clean.
There’s a woman in a mask. Her voice—it’s so familiar. My heart races. It feels like i know her, but I don’t know how.
“You’ll heal,” she says.
And I believe her.
I feel free. No chains. No games. Just this strange, serene paradise.
And this woman. Her voice.
The grass really is greener on the other side.
But if I never treated her badly… this wouldn’t have happened
