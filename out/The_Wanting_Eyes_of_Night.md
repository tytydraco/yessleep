If on some strange night you find yourself amongst the formless dark, and in that darkness you feel the wanting eyes of some distant observer, you would be wise to hurry on your journey home, for you would not wish to end up as I.

It was a night much like this one when I found myself wandering the black abyss, and in that silent darkness I foolishly ignored the red beam of danger rotating in my mind. I felt the observation, and I took the sensation with no greater seriousness than a passing shiver.

Quietly, I travelled along the quayside, absent of tungsten street lamps and rays of moonlight, guided only by the faintest proof of reality: the ground beneath my feet, and the last crashing breaths of a recent storm.

If I could scarcely make out the crescent of the forms before me, then surely I, too, could only be observed in fragments. I orbited these thoughts in an elliptical fashion, my path tightening as the sensation of being watched intensified, and when I could no longer bear to be a satellite to such an unpleasant body, I felt compelled to project my thoughts aloud, if only to dispel them from my uneasy mind.

“Who goes there?” I offered to the dark, louder than intended. Then louder still: “If someone’s there, you ought to make yourself known!”

That strange darkness, indifferent, replied in silence.

Even the waves had fallen quiet, swallowed into the void.

And in that silent void I felt an aching terror, as though the precarious light of civilisation itself had been extinguished. I was alone, lost in an unfathomable night known only to our most ancient ancestors, and to the vague creatures that came before even them.

In my fear I dropped to the ground, searching with my hands and straining eyes for the faintest indication of reality, and when my fingers met the cold paving slabs of the quayside, I began to crawl - desperate to find any way out of the night.

That was when I felt the silent laughter, and I knew that if I raised my head, I might see, etched in anti-light, the many patient eyes of the dark watching my struggle with cruel amusement.

“What do you want from a wretched thing such as I?” I cried into nothingness, grasping at the stone as I dragged myself forward. “Does it give you joy to watch me suffer?”

Gradually, with each forward motion, the crescent shapes of reality began to seep back in. I scrambled faster, cursing the night aloud, hoping that if the darkness had language, I might distract it from realising my plan.

But the silent laughter only magnified in my mind as the world returned in pieces.

Then, in a swell of confidence, I pushed myself up and ran. One step, then two—then the third fell upon nothing but open air. I tumbled into the black water of the black night, still laughing its silent black laugh.

Somehow, I survived the freezing plunge. Somehow, I clawed my way back to shore, shivering and sick with dread.

So hear me now:  
  
if ever you find yourself on some strange night with the wanting eyes of an unseen observer upon you  
  
do not linger.

Hurry.  
  
Before the dark decides to take a closer look.
