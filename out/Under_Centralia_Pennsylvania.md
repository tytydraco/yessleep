I used to live in a small mining town in Pennsylvania called Centralia. It was back in the late 50s back before the coal mine was set on fire. To this day I am the only person who still knows the reason why!

I kept this secret for 62 years for the right time. And now it is that time so here’s my story. I moved to Centralia Pennsylvania in 1956. I was 3 years old at the time. My parents worked in the mines that this town used to get coal from!

I always found it odd that this town still mined coal in the late 50s and early 60s. because I thought all mining towns were just a thing of the past. But nonetheless I met a young boy named Dirt Smith. he couldn’t read or write. But he taught me the most valuable advice.

Dirt smith told me “I hear the mines crying at night”! Looking back on it, Dirt Smith was a lot smarter than I used to think. But nonetheless me and Dirt Smith became friends even though our parents seemed to hate each other!

So me and dirt smith would sneak out at times to play together. We would play ghosts in the graveyard and hide and go seek in the forest. until we could hear the wailing underground. It always happens during night time!

But then one day in 1961 Dirt Smith disappeared! When i went over to his parents i asked them “um Miss and Mr Smith have you seen Dirt Smith”? Miss Smith started crying but Mr Smith then yelled at me “that damn boy ran away” and I then walked home!

As I arrived at home I could hear the crying below me. It was honestly scarier because it was far lounder! So I didn't sleep that night. Then March 3rd 1962 came and it was my birthday. My parents gave me permission to use the house's only rotary  phone!

I was overjoyed by this because I was always curious as to what the thing my parents would talk to at night! I was given a copy of our country's phone book and called the closet library. I asked them “do you know what the screaming in Centralia is”?

The liberation on the phone said “there is a legend that during the great depression after many mining companies pulled out of the mines, they forgot their workers down in the mines and so they died, and now they haunt the mines”!

After I learned this, I began to believe that the miners stole Dirt Smith! So, I was going to rescue him! So, I packed myself a lantern and waited in my parent's trunk! When my parents got to the car, I could hear a conversation!

My mother said “ I can't believe they took our son”! my father then told my mother “i know he’s not nearly as dumb as those other kids”! My mother after a few seconds said “I wish that this wasn’t happening”! After this my father said in an annoyed voice “it's for the town honey”!

After they arrived at the mines. I waited for them to go in! Before unlocking the trunk and going into the mines! As I walked though I could hear more of the crying but it sounded like children crying!

And then I reached a lift! It looked old and unsafe but I had to save Dirt Smith. So I turned it on and I went down into the mines!

I could still hear the crying but I could also hear the mining! As I descended down into the mines I heard my father yell “god dammit Dirt you are shit at mining coal” followed by my friend Dirt Smith sobbing saying “please don’t put me in the hole again”! And then i reached the bottom i

I could see my father and 2 other men dragging Dirt Smith somewhere!

I began to follow through the labyrinth of the coal mines. It felt like I was being watched as I followed the people who were taking away my friend. And then I saw where they took him to a pit with iron bars on top of the hole!

My dad threw Dirt Smith into the hole! At that moment I felt as if the love for my parents died that day! And as soon as they locked Dirt Smith in there they left. I made my way the the hole and when Dirt Smith saw me.

He said “you need to get out of here” i said “not without you” so i found a piece of flint and unscrewed the bars! And then I heard footsteps. I lifted Dirt Smith out and we ran down the other tunnel! The men must have heard us because one of them yell “pillar robbers are in the mines”

Me and Dirt Smith holded hands so we wouldn’t get separated! But unfortunately we were lost in the catacombs of the mines! And the footsteps approached us!

And just as we were about to be dead meat. But then we saw a light and we ran into it causley and we went outside in the forest! As we got farther away from the mines but i could hear footsteps approaching. i told Dirt Smith “run away from this town don’t come back”

Dirt Smith told me “you should come too” i told him “i can’t i need to distract them” Dirt Smith gave me a sober head nod and ran away! When the man who was making the footsteps approached me it was our town's sheriff.

I was about to tell him what I saw in the mines! But he said “why are you out here kid”? It was the same voice from the man who yelled “pillar robbers”! I lied to him and said “just taking a hike”. The sheriff must have believed me because he let me go home.

When I got home my parents said “we missed you sweety”! I felt disgusted at them and I went to my room! And stayed there the whole night! When I heard the crying below me inserted of fear I felt disgusted! So I called the nearby town's sheriff. I told him about the horrors in the mine!

The people running the operation must have heard. since the mine caught on fire! I don’t know if the kids got out or they burned with the mines! But after this my parents said we’re moving! I was sad not because i was leaving this town but because i will never see Dirt Smith agian

After we moved, Centralia Pennsylvania never recovered! The trains stopped coming into the town. The local government has started destroying the town's houses. And only a few people now live there.

And now after 62 years can I finally tell people what really happened. It took a long time but I wanted to make sure my parents died before I told people!

And my father 2 years ago from covid and my mother just died of cancer so i think everyone who was involved with the operation is probably gone so i feel safe in exposing why the Centralia mines burned down!
