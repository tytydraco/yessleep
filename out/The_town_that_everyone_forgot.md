Does anyone else remember the town Crow's Peak? I do as I was born there but when I ask any locals no one seems to remember. Going to the location from where I remember it being located it is now covered by seemingly endless farmland as if no life had ever been there.

I know what was here though, I can remember it like yesterday. I was born in Crow's Peak in 1956. The town was nothing spectacular just a simple small town that would easily be passed by without a second glance from any travelers.. To me though for the first twelve years of my life Crow's Peak was my home. The town consisted of a small general store, a local fire station,  a bar and other small mom and pop shops. The biggest talk of the town I can remember was when there was talks of  large department store wanting to open a location in us, I remember the protests against this. The town believed that this store moving into our town would be the beginning of the end for our local stores which people believed would then cause our town to fail.

I had extremely fond memories of Crow's Peak, I had a good amount of friends that I would spend everyday after school with playing outside until the sun went down. My parents were also extremely proud of Crow's Peak little town charm, having shirts, mugs and other memorabilia with the towns name plastered across it. However after we moved from Crow's Peak it is like my parents thought I was crazy whenever I mentioned the small town, constantly telling me we have never lived in a place called Crow's Peak that we have always lived in our small two bedroom house in Ottawa.. to this day I still do not understand my parents complete confusion at any mention towards Crow's Peak. One day I remember my father lashing out at me because I mentioned to him that for summer break I wanted to visit Crow's Peak, He yelled on and on about how I need to stop talking about this imaginary place and start focusing in reality.

My parents both passed away several years ago now, Crow's Peak was a long time ago now and the town really has not bothered me at all.. until a week ago now. I was going through my parents old belongings when I came across a mug, it was dirty and worn but the label on it was just legible enough to make out... We love Crow's Peak....

&#x200B;

At that moment I nearly dropped the mug in shock, why had my parents called me crazy for all these years for mentioning Crow's Peak? Why had they made it seem as if this small town was all but an imaginary place that my childhood memory had made up?..

After this discovery I visited my local library and began to do research on nearby towns and settlements of the past, My library had it well organized in a A-Z category. A...B..C I looked through the entire C category but there was not a single town in there called Crow's Peak.. I looked on the internet for hours after finding several Crow's Peaks but none in Ontario.. none in the location that I remembered it being. This is when I decided that I would go to the location myself.. to finally unbury the secret as to why my parents hid my childhood town from me, why there is no documentation of  it...

&#x200B;

That Friday I packed my car and traveled four hours west from Ottawa, to the exact location where I knew Crow's Peak was located.. to my utter shock, nothing.... Just bare unkempt farmland, I couldn't understand. How is this possible, how could a place I remember so vividly and well just.. not exist? I spent hours after this asking many older locals from nearby towns about Crow's Peak and every single time I received the same answers and looks that were so familiar.. it was the same reactions that my parents gave me so many times throughout my younger life.

I need help, am I going mad? I know this town existed I just know it.. I wont stop until I uncover the truth about Crow's Peak, I can't stop.
