I’m writing this in an attempt to make some sense of the past week’s events. For some background to this story I am a former competitive swimmer as well as having been a coach for a short period of time. In addition to this I have a general interest in urban exploring. 

One of my friends who for anonymity’s sake I’ll refer to as John, is an avid urban explorer. While I did have an interest in it, i never had actually done it. John on the other hand seemed to go out nearly every weekend exploring abandoned places. I was no stranger to his stories of creepy encounters and met them with a reasonable sense of skepticism. 

It was Saturday roughly 5 weeks ago when I was drinking with john and a few other friends. He brought up a urban exploration story as usual but this time with special attention to me, being the only one of the group that was a swimmer. He described how he had heard from a friend in the hobby about an abandoned house in our area which had an extremely large pool in the basement. Much larger than the size of the house above. 

John described how he got directions and had went to visit it himself and was amazed that it was true. He did describe an erie feeling while being there but that was it. No scary monster, no crackhead with a knife, just a pool. Being drunk and interested I asked if he would take me to it one of these weekends. He laughed and agreed as he had been trying to get me into the hobby for a while. The night continued as our drinking nights normally do. 

About a week had passed and I got a text from John asking if I wanted to go the upcoming Saturday. I nearly had forgotten about it but said yes. I asked him what to pack and he told me just a bag with a flashlight, maybe duct tape, and some food. I asked if I could bring a handgun as I am licensed to concealed carry. John told me that due to the nature of urban exploration, it was unwise to bring a gun as urban exploration itself is trespassing, and getting caught trespassing with a firearm was a much more serious charge. I said I understood and got a bag ready and went about my week. John picked me up Saturday at around 10:00 pm. We made small talk as he could barely contain his excitement about getting me into the hobby.

The drive was about 45 minutes with the majority of it being through wooded areas. The last eight or so minutes were on a dirt road deep in a forest I had never been to. Our small talk and bullshitting stopped when we reached it. A clearing in the forest holding one abandoned house. It was pitch black outside and as a result the house was only illuminated by the headlights of John’s Jeep. I stared at it for a few second before John snapped me out of it by saying “There she is”. I looked at him and chuckled. We got out of the car with our bags and holding our flashlights. 

The house was definitely abandoned. Some windows having been boarded up. It looked like a typical two bedroom home, just neglected. John told me that the way in was through the backdoor. I followed him until we reached it and opened it. The house was as dark as the outside forest around it. Oddly enough though. The house was entirely empty, clean barring the dust. The walls were entirely bare, no stains, no pictures, nothing on the countertops. The furniture was also removed. This was odd to me as I had imagined abandoned homes to be cluttered messes. 

Before I could make a comment about it I heard John’s voice saying “the basement is this way”. I followed him to the door with the stairs leading down. I stopped at the top of the stairs expecting to feel some sense of dread, there was none. We descended the stairs for what felt like an eternity and what I saw had amazed me. 

He was right. In front of my eyes was a massive pool. Rough 50 meters long with enough width for twenty lanes. The floors were tiled and there even stood a lifeguard chair. I was too busy being in awe of the size of the pool that I didn’t even notice the lights were on until John made a comment about it. “Pretty crazy how none of the lights upstairs work, but down here they’re on full blast”. I looked up and noticed incredibly high ceilings with functioning lights running the whole length of the pool. 

This facility was large and nice enough to make other natatoriums I had been to seem tiny. I couldn’t understand why this would be under a regular house, why the power was on for only this part, why the water looked crystal clear and maintained. I asked John “what the fuck is this place, does some team practice here and use it?” He returned my question with “No idea, I cant find anything about this place online. The guy who told me about it said he heard about it from a guy who heard about it from a guy but nobody knew anything except the location”. 

We continued to walk along the pool deck when I stopped to look at my reflection in the water. I stopped and stared and felt an urge to jump in. To touch the water. I started to squat down when John yelled back “Stop! The guy before me said not to go into the water ever.” I asked him why and he again returned my question with “I have no idea, just what he heard from the guy before him and so on”. I stood up but the urge to jump in and touch the water never left me as we continued walking. 

We explored storage rooms, a lifeguard room, and even locker rooms. All entirely empty yet clean. When we were going through the locker rooms I stopped to look in one of the mirrors and saw my reflection. I stared for a few second before blinking and my reflection changed. I was the same except it was as if I had been dunked underwater. My hair and clothes soaked. I nearly jumped in shock and when I blinked again my reflection was back to normal. 

We quickly finished exploring the locker room and wrapped up our trip. As we walked back to the stairs we talked about how cool the spot was and how odd the nature of it was. As we got closer to leaving the urge for me to jump into the water climbed but I did my best to ignore it. Oddly enough once we reached the stairs and my foot left the tile floor the feeling subsided entirely. Almost like it switched off. 

We left the house and got back into John’s Jeep. As we drove back to my house I was filled with so many questions. John dropped me off, I thanked him for taking me out and he left. When I got inside I went to googling anything I could about a pool in the area with no relevant results. I decided to drop the search for answers for the time being but the pool stayed in my mind. 

I went back to it on my own the next day. I didn’t tell John. I don’t know why. I got to the house and went to the backdoor. The house remained unchanged. I descended the stairs and as soon as my foot touched the tile floor of the pool deck the urge to jump in returned. Stronger than before. 

I walked along the pool and just took it all in. About thirty meters down the length of the pool I heard something. On the wall to my right. It sounded like a tapping noise. I put my ear to the wall and as soon as I did, a loud bang came from the other side causing me to fall backwards. I shot my foot back to catch myself. I looked back and noticed how close I was to falling in. I laughed it off but couldn’t shake the feeling to just touch the water. I collected myself and kept walking. I stayed for about ten more minuted and then went to leave. 

As i got to the stairs I heard something that was new to the pool. A voice. It was soft, almost like I imagined it but i could have sworn it said come back. I left and again as my feet left the pool deck to ascend the stairs the feeling to jump in left me. 

The drive home started normally but about ten minutes into the drive I got a text from John. It read “you should go back” i texted him back asking what? And after a few minutes of no response i called him. He greeted me as usual and i questioned his text. He said he had no idea what I had meant, even sending me a screenshot of his texts with me showing no message that I described. 

I hung up and pulled over on the dirt road with a feeling of dread in my heart trying to rationalize the events. I sat there for a few minutes before driving home. I drank to calm my nerves and went to sleep. I will post again continuing my story later as I am currently doing what I did that night.
