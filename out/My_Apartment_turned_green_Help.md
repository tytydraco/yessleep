"Since when does Mr.Wei's class started at eight? eight o clock is Miss Li's history class." I asked my classmate.

"Since forever? Dude, you are really close to him. You should know this."

I didn't know. I had always remembered his class to start exactly at ten o clock. Mr.Wei was a very disciplined teacher, and his routine matches the schedule down to the nano second.

I wanted to argue back, but it was already nearing eight o clock. Miss Li would came up from that door, and shut my classmate for good.

The door opened, and the first thing I saw was the signature black jacket that Mr.Wei had always wore.

"See?"

I couldn't reply. Perhaps there were some changes in the schedule? Or did I forget the schedule of my own favorite teacher after studying with him for a year?

I decided it was the latter.

I had a pretty bad memory after all. I had studied in this high school for almost a year, yet I had only remembered five or six people from my class, and a handful of teacher.

In fact, I had already forgotten the name of the classmate who was sitting right beside me. I could remember the fact that his family came from another city, and the fact that he has an unhealthy obsession with trains, but I could not remember his name at all.

Still. there was that feeling of wrongness that keeps lingering in my back.

"Whats wrong?"

"Nothing much... Yong?" I answered sheepishly.

"Its Tao." He smirked. "You know I just told you that yesterday, right?"

"I know, sorry."

"Nah, no need. I had already expected it."

My terrible memory wasn't exactly a secret.

Mr.Wei class finished right as the clock hit nine fifty-five. When I say right on time, I meant that. Right when the long arrow of the clock mounted on the wall hit the number twelve. He would walk out of the class with exactly five steps. Sometimes me and Tao would joke about how he was a robot in disguise.

Except that I had always remember that the short arrow was on the number twelve, not ten.

The school went on like usual. I did all my work and study, then went home with a bus. A normal day overall.

The bus was crowded, as it normally does.

I exited the bus and began walking toward my apartment.

The lingering feeling of wrongness was still there. creeping from behind and clouding my mind. It was hard to describe. It was as if I had traveled to another dimension, or a parallel universe, and my brain was desperately telling me about the shift.

I reminded myself to stop reading too much sci-fi novel. The culprit seemed obvious.

I wondered about sharing this feeling with my father. But he would probably just told me that I had misremember it. My father was a good father, but can be to dismissive sometime.

Though perhaps he would be right.

I turned around the corner and cross the street, but my leg stop right on their track.

My body froze, I could not move. The scooter from behind me honked as I suddenly stop right in the middle of the street. "Crazy kid!" I could faintly hear him shout. I did not care.

The wrongness grew louder. It began hitting my brain like a butcher.

Since when was the apartment green?

I had lived in that apartment for all sixteen years of my life. I vividly remember that the apartment walls were brown, with white square windows and black balconies.

The white square windows were there, and so were the balconies. But there were no brown walls in sight!

I ran straight toward the apartment, ignoring the convenience store which i was planning to buy some snack earlier.

Maybe the walls were having a new paint? No that couldn't be right.

I rushed inside the fences, through the menacing security guards, through the empty stores with "SELLING QUICK" sign on their door, and dashed straight toward the elevator. The parking lot looked the same as I remembered, and so was the elevator.

Was it possible that I misremember?

I entered the key to my room.

"Dad! Since when did the walls turned green?" I asked my dad, who was relaxing on the couch, watching a soap opera. Shirtless with only a short.

"It has always been green. What are you talking about?" His eyebrow raised.

Louder, it was even more louder. I thought there was an earthquake. I feel like my head was being put on a blender.

I wanted to vomit.

I ran to my bedroom, ignoring my father question, and jumped right toward the bed.

I hugged myself.

For a moment, I thought it was my memory. I was just having a relapse in my memory. Just a simple error in my brain.

But that would be denial--running away from the truth.

There were simply no way that I could misremember that. Sixteen years I had lived in this place. It has always been brown.

Wrongness. The cloud was now slowly turning to a storm.

I exited my bed and went straight to my computer. I tried to look for anything that was related to this.

It grew louder and louder. It wasn't a voice, but it felt like one. How could something that doesn't have a voice be this loud?!

My computer turned on.

Since when did my wallpaper changed to a mountain?

Louder.

I re-opened my browser and went looking.

There were nothing. Some articles mentioned schizophrenia, or insanity. But I felt sane. I could still think, talk.

I was mentally well. I thought. Perhaps...

A million thought rushes toward my brain. Thunder starts striking. I desperately went pages after pages, trying to silent the scream.

I found something, but it wasn't the cure.

Reddit popped up on my search result.

Why were there Reddit in my search result? My VPN had not been activated yet.

I went looking for the censorship law.

There were no mention of it at all!

My head was so hot it felt like I could explode at any moment. There was nothing that I wanted to do more than to shrivel up and tore my head up to remove the wrongness.

I was desperate.

I opened deepseek AI, and begin pouring the events that had happened. Cure, I need cure.

It told me that it could "feel it" and that my "story" was great. It told me I should ask for help in r/nosleep (The AI wrote ask for help with quotation mark around it)

So here I am, sorry if my English is bad. But I am desperate. My head hurt. I couldn't think clearly. Its hard to describe. I am not really good with words.

Please help.
