This is a story you probably won’t be used to, but it’s one I needed to write. Ever since I was young well… I’ve had dreams and been able to see things. Sometimes it comes in the form of nightmares, I wake up from a dream of being in another’s body. Sometimes I wake up after experiencing someone's death. This one was unique. Maybe I will continue sharing my experiences, but this one is just for Donny. There are things he needs to know; however he might view it. It’s not directly from me, but there's darkness around him.

We know the city doesn’t sleep, not in the early morning for a quiet hour. Not when the student sets his laptop down to rest. The city doesn’t sleep when the sun rises, nor when the ill catch the busses on quiet streets. When the sun rises and shines on the seats, it falls into the hair of slickened scalps and tight ponytails. The faces of the people who come in different phases. A drunk, on their way home from a long night. The middle-aged woman is on a brisk walk, jaywalking the road. Sometimes it shines on the homeless man, turning and pulling the blanket over his head. The light shines from the tall buildings and reflects on everyone. The concrete blocks identify themselves as a person does at their first meeting. Everyone knows what the blocks mean when they say to them, *“Hello this is what I am”.* Then the people spend their day keeping up with the world, waiting for the sun to go back down.

\*\*\*

He stands from the seat and I watch, waiting for him to see his shoes. The bus waits for people to get off, its doors open, and Donny is tying his shoes. Tired and late for a meeting a woman behind him taps her fingers on the back of a chair. The voices and chattering of those behind dull into a blur. Everyone tumbles onto the pavement together, seemingly in rows and he jerks aside.

We walk together down the street, and a slew of heavy-headed pedestrians exit a building spreading apart. Maybe for a moment, he feels like a piece of straw or grass, collected in a field and shapeless; but I see his eyes and how he tips his head up at the sky, gazing at the tall buildings. The buildings above him reflect, and the heat of the sun touches his cheeks. He breathes in until his entire chest is filled. 

*‘Like a clean avalanche,’* I say.

\*\*\*

*‘Here we are.’*

He's sitting down pulling his bag off, just as Anne comes to sit in her chair. I know what he's thinking sometimes. In silence, he feels the bumps from under his skin as if paper were over his bones, or as if some elastic material was stretched over him. I watch his hands clutch the elbows tightly. Underneath the fingers are white, like the flesh is holding on to a mark.

*“Stop that.”* I wait for him to stop, and he puts his hands in his lap.

'Donny, where are you?' A calm female’s voice protrudes into the thick room.

A breath escapes, hazardous from throat congestion. His eyes dart and glaze over the office, they fall on me. I look back, studying him.

'Sorry, what did you say?’ he stops and sighs. He puts his face in his hands as if trying to wipe away dirt, or the hair in his eyes. He says, ‘I'm sorry I don't feel well lately.’

'Donny?’ Her eyes probe. ‘How has your medication been?' She checks the clipboard in her hands.

'I came off them since two weeks ago,’ he says.

I scoff. ‘*Two weeks ago.’* He looks at me wide-eyed and I stop speaking.

'You didn't consult me before you did this? I wonder why you stopped taking them when you seemed to be so doing well on them,' she says.

'I’m not sure why I stopped, I was feeling- I didn't need them anymore,' he says bluntly. 'I came off them quickly. I thought it would be easy, but I felt like I was losing something.'

His fingers are shaking at the memory of our weekend together, after that first night when I waited for him to flush his pills from the toilet bowl.

‘*Do you miss being alone with me now?’*

'Well, I would imagine so, that is not nearly enough time. You may still feel the effects now.' She says it disapprovingly, crossing one leg over the other in some frustration maybe.

'I felt better after a time, this is new.'

'You’re feeling anxious,' she states.

'It's worse than anxious, I feel…' he trails off. 'Someone is always in the room, but now more than ever I fear myself.'

'Why are you afraid of yourself?'

*‘You must be crazy; you think she knows you’re crazy?’*

 His chest rises and falls, eyes twitching towards me.

'Because I'm losing myself again, and this time it isn't a problem with medication- I feel crazy, but that isn't who I am is it? Are you afraid of what your mind does?'

'I have known what crazy is, Donny, you are not crazy.' She pauses. 'Sometimes we’re triggered by something that’s happened, has anything happened to you recently?'

'It doesn't have to be much.' He sits back and sighs. 'A cold stare, or a confused look, reminds me I'm different. But I’m not that different, am I?’

'Sometimes people can detect fear, just like an animal. What are you afraid of?' She asks.

'Making a mistake,' he says thinking. 'I’m afraid of... Maybe something more, something with me. I haven’t made up my mind yet.’

'Perhaps you don't want to disappoint people, that is common for people suffering from your illness,’ she points out.

‘*It’s common for you, to disappoint.’*

He ignores me. 'Yes, that too... I'm afraid of being alive and I avoid it, I avoid living. I haven't gotten my license yet; I took a bus here. Aren’t you afraid of being alive?'

'Most people are afraid of death. You have many years left to live Donny, for now, it is okay to spend time working on yourself,' she says simply.

He looks at the wall, the frustration on his face. 'I don't think I’ll live a very long life.'

'Why do you believe that?'

He looks at his feet, at the loose laces on his sneakers. 'I have this feeling like someone is waiting for me.'

She shifts forward listening.

He shakes his head steadily. 'I feel it, something out there. There’s something they can’t see, pulling me in. I know things, I see things.’

Sitting back again, she says, 'Why do you think you’re afraid? Last week you mentioned your mother was disapproving of you as a child.’

'Yes, I might find some answers from the past, but I still don't understand why I am this way.'

*‘You don’t even remember your past do you, your life.’*

'Does the fear have a face?'

'This fear is unknowable to me. It shifts and morphs. Fear must be buried deep inside of me somewhere. I think maybe it's stored in my bones, unreachable.’ He pauses. 'Sometimes, I imagine a black face staring out from around a corner when I’m alone in the dark. When I am lonely, I become afraid of the dark. If I asked you why that is would you have a real answer for me?'

\*\*\*

He kicks his shoes off and lays down slowly. He stares at nothing for a moment.

*‘Is it you who’s pointless or is it me?’* I ask.

‘Isn’t my torture your point?’

*‘I’m not doing it.’*

‘Then who is?’

*‘Doesn’t she say it’s you?’*

‘No.’

*‘Who?’*

‘My mind?’

*‘Yes.’*

‘What are you doing?’

*‘I’m help.’*

‘Are you helping me? Am I shiny new?’

*‘A friend just remember that I try to help.’*

‘I need a friend.’

*‘Yes, you did.’*

‘When will I go?’

*‘It’s not time yet.’*

‘Why?’

*‘One day you will have a beautiful son.’*

‘I will?’

*‘Yes… and a family. Perhaps you will.’*

‘Perhaps?’

*‘…Yes...Perhaps.’*

‘What will happen?’

*‘It’s not for me to say.’*

It’s a Thursday when it drags us through a thick black veil, bound together. First what flashes in your mind is Jesus, bleeding at the cross, eyes wide, looking down at you in disbelief. He reaches out like a bloody handshake, his eyes peering through a glowing crown of thorns. But you whip us away, through a vortex of colours and light. Like when you closed your eyes at night and opened them in the morning to somewhere new. Soon suburbia sits, a little yellow house you grew up in. The smell of soap and candle wax in the air. Together we walk into the empty place, sandwiches are set on the table with the succulents. It looks like they are made of wax. We enter a blue room and see a little boy, turning a plane in his hand through the air. I watch him stop. He twists around to look up at you and fear brims his eyes. I crouch down, resting my hand on his shoulder, and his eyes dancing with a million stars winding through the abyss. Constellations build themselves and stars die. Worlds implode and a million drops of rain fall, all in the form of tears.

Here the streets of suburbia reflect the lines of your face. And you know everything here, the houses, the sun, the moon, are the creations of a god. The place they go sometimes; to the empty buildings, or the cakes left on the stands. The empty computer rooms, the uncapped bottles, rows, and rows of books stopped half off the shelf. Some find the pearly gates of an empire, and some find hell. The decidedly eternal punishment, the dark pits that dwell in the back of every human experience.

The empty expanses are a weight you feel you wore on your shoulders heavily, a hard weight. The weight, though choosing, a life in humanity. They, writhing in the dark cloak, in the fear of the chaos they are bound by. Seeking comfort and clarity. Subverting at every turn, through a fumbling mass of children who swear to have answers. Humanity: the collection of experiences through uncertainty. An experience that forces us to collect stones and build walls around ourselves for safety.

 So Donny, please… let me beg and ask…what if we live, and what if we die?

After all, we’re all stardust baby.
