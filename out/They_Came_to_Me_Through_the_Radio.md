Sorry if my English is not acceptable, I’m not a native speaker because I am from Russia so I sometimes get words and things wrong when using English, but I doubt there are enough Russian speakers here for me to use Russian so I will use English instead. Because I am not sure what exactly is happening, I will not use my true name here, and will instead use the name ‘Alexei’ for myself henceforth.

My story that I want to share began in 1985, I think. In 1985 I was 26 years old and was working for the Ministry of Installation and Special Construction Works, a name which I think is very ironic because my crew and I did far more destruction than installation, but I suppose then was a time of tearing down and not so much bringing up. Though I say ‘my crew’, the crew wasn’t *really* mine- Vladimir was boss. Ivan was a blaster, Boris was a compliance supervisor, Pyotr was some sort of engineer- in honesty I cannot recall- and I worked the machines. With names so common, we would always say that our mothers were the five most uninspired women on Earth. We might get help on some jobs which were more tough, but the five of us would be there always.   
  
That is, except that day. That day, neither Boris nor Pyotr had arrived for work. When I asked Vladimir where they were, he would just tell me “Don’t worry, we don’t need them.” This I found hard to believe; Pyotr’s knowledge of engineering was often crucial for ensuring material recovery, efficient practices, and a sound overall strategy, and law said Boris *had* to be present on *any* site our crew was actively working to ensure compliance with state guidelines. The crew without Pyotr was like a ship without a rudder to steer us, and without Boris it was a boat we weren’t even authorized to board. 

“I’ve been saying this for years!” Ivan would laugh.

“Then what are we to do?” I asked Vladimir, consciously ignoring Ivan’s remark, “Sit on our thumbs the whole day?”

“Hah!” Ivan bellowed once more, turning to face me as he stuck out a thumb and gestured it towards his ass, “I bet you would like it if we did that, no?”

I scowled at Ivan, whose relentless quipping habit was made only worse by his typical reliance on these homoerotic remarks, and it appeared Vladimir had similarly been fed up, as he swiftly forbade any more speaking from the two of us until he gave us the day’s briefing.

“Comrades,” Vladimir began as always, though this was surely out of habit, as ‘comrade’ had begun to fall out of style, even back then before the fall, “We are to go perform a demolition.” Usually this would be the point at which Ivan would sarcastically chime in with “You don’t say!” Luckily, he was- for once- able to keep his mouth restrained. “Ivan, pack three cases of TNT in a satchel.”

“But,” Ivan exhaled, as if he had been holding his breath since the order to shut his mouth, “How are we to do a job without Boris or Pyotr?”

“I have already told you,” Vladimir sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose, “We do not *need* them. Alexei, start the truck and wait for us. Our machines won’t be needed.” 

“Unbelievable,” Ivan grumbled as he shuffled off for the supplies, “No supervisor, no engineer, no machines, and no tools but three boxes of dynamite? If this is terrorism, Vladimir, I’ll have you know I’ll *gladly* tell them everything.”

Vladimir declined a verbal reply, instead favouring a firm- and well past due- smack upside Ivan’s head that shut him up quickly. 

“If there are no machines,” I inquired as I lifted the truck keys off a wall-mounted hanger, “Why am I to come?”

“Don’t worry,” Vladimir repeated once more, “There *are* machines. They’re simply there, already at the site.” 

I raised my eyebrows incredulously. I was more than accustomed to the first step on any of my jobs being loading the heavy machines onto a flatbed, so this change was… unexpected. “Just what is this job?” I asked as I swung on my jacket, “What are we to destroy?”

“Hush.” Vladimir snapped as he accompanied me to the door, “You will see.”

“Well,” I asked, rolling the truck keys back and forth in my palm to catch his attention, “How am I to drive if I don’t know where we’re going?”

“I never said *you* would be driving,” Vladimir scoffed, “I only want you to warm up the car.” He pushed open the door with his shoulder, immediately recoiling at the first snowdrift which swirled by. “*Blyat*!”

“... Fine,” I relented, stepping outside while holding up an arm to shield my eyes from the glare of light off of the snow and the bite of the wind, slowly pushing myself towards the truck like I was trudging through syrup. 

Though the walk only took seconds, getting into the truck felt like reaching an oasis in the desert, only for the comforting illusion to fade when I realised it was somehow even colder in the car. I wasted no time in fishing out the right key and turning on the engine, holding my hands by the weak little heater beside the wheel.

Moments later, the driver’s door opened and Vladimir slipped in, cursing and mumbling obscenities under his breath as he slammed the door shut behind him and blew frantically on his hands before redirecting his attention to the heater, first laying a rolled up map and a clipped stack of papers on the dash before holding his own hands next to mine to bathe in the warmth of the little breeze blowing from the vent. 

Before either of us could say a word to the other, we were startled by the sound of a huge crash and bang which shook the truck on its bed, nearly causing us to jump out of our skins. We both spun our heads around to see that the sound had come from Ivan, who had haphazardly hurled a bag- which, I add, contained three cases of *dynamite*\- onto the bed of the truck. It was a miracle the crash and bang we heard was only as loud as it was, given the bag’s volatile contents.

“*Blyat*!” Vladimir once again shrieked, before turning to look right at me as he raised up his rosy, chilled hands, “Alexei… I’m going to kill him. Listen to my words, it will be by my hands, I swear it.” 

“That’s not possible,” I replied quickly, to which he would ask “Why not?” only for me to respond “Because he is going to die by *my* hands first.” On this, we shared a good laugh, but it was not so funny in hindsight, if I am to be honest…

“You know, it’s more likely Ivan will kill *us* first,” Vladimir exhaled, glancing back at the bag of explosives through the rear window as Ivan hopped in back.

“Ready?” Ivan asked as he rubbed his hands together, clearly unaware of the momentary panic he had caused us.

Vladimir groaned and shifted the car into drive, and we slowly began to watch home base drift away into the distance. 

“So,” I looked over at Vladimir, “Can you now tell us where we are going?”For a second, Vladimir remained quiet, glancing first at me out of the corner of his eye, then up at Ivan in the rearview mirror, before hesitantly mumbling “... Omsk.”

“OMSK?!” Ivan shrieked, nearly starting Vladimir enough to swerve the truck off the snow swept road. “By god, Omsk is days away! What am I to tell Alina?!”

I could not help but chuckle. “Ivan, you act as though she is your wife. You’re not a married man.” 

“But she *will* be,” Ivan insisted, leaning between the front seats to wave a finger in my face disappointedly. 

“So she is your fiance?” I asked with a raise of my eyebrow, to which Ivan shrank back and returned to his seat.

“... She will be that, yes, and then…” 

“And then you will have kids, and then you will die, we know,” Vladimir scoffed, “Same for us all, a true Soviet love story.” “If there *is* such a thing,” I couldn’t resist adding, which got a chuckle out of Vladimir- not so much out of Ivan. In truth, Ivan didn’t really talk for the rest of the drive, only really speaking again once we had arrived at the inn for the night to ask if there was a payphone around so that he could make a call. For Vladimir and I, though, it was straight to bed to rest for the next day’s drive.

When morning came, things went as planned. We rose early, ate our breakfast, drank our coffee, got in the car, and began to drive. By the afternoon, shortly outside of Omsk, Vladimir slowed down the truck, looked out of the windows, glanced back at his map, and then began to gradually bring the car to a halt on the unpaved roadside. 

“We’re here,” he announced, popping his door open as he swung his legs out and hopped out of the car.

“What do you mean ‘we are here’?” Ivan asked, about as perplexed as I was as he swung his head around to look out of the windows at the dusty road and the thick of trees, “We are not ‘*here*’, we are *nowhere*!”

“We are *here*,” Vladimir insisted as he zipped up his jacket, “Ivan, get the bag.”

“I can see the papers now,” Ivan mumbled as he stepped out of the truck, “‘Brave comrades obliterate tree with dynamite to show the motherland is above even nature herself!’”

Ignoring Ivan, Vladimir simply scanned the roadside before seeming to have spotted a large, oddly polished chunk of rock propped up against a fir. “This way,” he ordered, pushing past the tree and into the woods as he fished a small compass from his breast pocket.

Ivan’s jaw dropped. “In *there*?! With *this*?!” He motioned his head back at the massive sack of explosives he had slung over his shoulders. “I thought you were joking but… how am I… Vlad, if I stumble, or I fall…”

“Don’t.” Vladimir muttered blankly, pushing his way further through the brush as Ivan turned to give me an incredulous look.

“‘Don’t’, he says!” Ivan scoffed as the two of us began pushing into the treeline to follow Vladimir, “‘Don’t’... Tch, he thinks he’s Tikhonov now…”

This attitude from Ivan continued for the entire hike, *especially* when he would nearly trip over something, which was when the obscenities *really* began to fly. However, after only an hour of walking, we had finally arrived.

What awaited us as we stepped out of the trees and into a small clearing, though, was not *anything* like what I had expected. Even Vladimir, who I had presumed to have known precisely what the job entailed, seemed utterly in awe of what stood before us then.

In front of us was a modest building- stone and unpainted- with barred windows and a sturdy iron door. It could’ve passed for a prison if it wasn’t for what stood next to it. On its north side stood a massive spire of wire and metal which I was able to identify as some sort of antennae from my conscripted days, but on its south side… 

On the buildings south side was a construction the likes of which I had never seen before or since, at least in person. Hindsight- and the internet- has allowed me to recognise it as some sort of dish, maybe for satellites or radar, but all I saw at the time was a towering beige behemoth which made me feel like I was only a little ant in its presence. Insulated cables ran up its length like vines up a tree and the shadow it cast over me filled me with a chill deeper than the bitter Siberian wind had ever given.

“This is…” I muttered, at a loss for words, looking over at an equally shocked Vladimir, “... What is this?”

Vladimir remained silent for a few moments, before he cleared his throat and turned to address us. “Alright. Get set up. *All* of it goes. *But* you must *wait* for my command before you are to snap a *single* twig, understood?”

I glanced over at the excavator and dozer which sat west of the building, and back at Vladimir. “Are you sure…?” 

“... Wait for my command,” Vladimir insisted again after yet another pause, before he turned to face back in the direction we’d come. “I’m… going to make sure this is all… correct. *Only* set up. Do NOT begin until I’m back.”

“Understood,” I replied hesitantly as Ivan placed the satchel on the ground, panting in exhaustion, trying to make himself as comfortable as one could when knowing that they are leaning up against a bag of dynamite. 

As Vladimir began to leave, he took one more look at Ivan, then back to me, and finally commanded, “And don’t lay about, I don’t want to be here any longer than needed… be ready when I get back.”

“Yes, of course, comrade,” Ivan lazily saluted as Vladimir disappeared from view behind the trees. “My…” he exhaled, rolling his head over on the pack to stare up at the mighty dish, “What… where are we?”

“How should I know?” I asked, leaning against the excavator.

“... Well,” Ivan sighed, an obnoxious grin now spread across his face, “Who’s going inside? Me? You? Both?”

I shot a glare of death at Ivan. 

“What?” Ivan replied smugly, “Who cares if it’s secret or something, it’s not as though it’s going to be here tomorrow. Where is the harm?”

“That’s *completely* idiotic,” I retorted, when Ivan slowly began to rise to his feet and dust himself off.

“Fine, if you won’t be going, I will. I’m too curious,” he smiled, making a step towards the door which I quickly blocked. Who knew what this place was- what was inside? *Ivan* of all people would be the last person I’d want to blindly wander into such a place. I knew then this was going nowhere given how stubborn he could be. He really meant it. I decided then that I had no choice.

Without me having to even say a word, Ivan just smirked wider, sat back down and leaned against the pack again. “Fill me in when you’re done.”

Exasperated, I wordlessly turned to the small stone building and took some small, hesitant steps toward it. Given that the place looked like a prison, I was hoping that the door would be firmly bolted shut. I couldn’t help but let my heart sink when the iron door swung open so gently it was as though it was mocking my wish.

Giving a last glance back at Ivan, who was indeed watching me intently, I groaned and stepped through the dim doorway. It is here that I must be completely honest with you. My memories of that place are extremely fuzzy for reasons which will become incredibly apparent in a very short time, but there are a few things I remember very distinctly.

The very first memory I have from inside that place was a small room right by the doorway. If the building had looked like a prison, this very definitely looked like a cell. The door, which was made of thick, rusted bars of metal, allowed a view into a cramped, empty stone room with an equally barred window which sat far too high for any reasonably tall person to see out of. I distinctly remember one more thing about that room, though… there was a small carving, etched deeply into the wall, just barely visible in the dim light which filtered through the barred window. I remember it read “Сизиф был здесь”... In English, I believe it should read “Sisyphus was here.” Obviously, I was, and remain, incredibly baffled by this statement beyond words.

The only other memory from that place that remains distinct, even now, is undoubtedly the very worst memory of my entire life. I had entered the structure’s- presumably- main room, a large room dimly lit by sunlight and the ominous glow of computer screens. What stood out to me the most about this room was the floor; the floor was blanketed in a wide, thin sheet of snow-white paper which so thoroughly carpeted the ground that it was like a blizzard had swept through.

After tracing the tremendously long sheet to its source, I found it to have been spilling out from a small slot beneath a blinking monitor. But, that was not all that I had found. I had then realized that the paper, despite how it had appeared from a modest distance, was not blank. Its opposite side was *plastered* with paragraphs of text. I had somewhat expected this; I had figured it was some sort of readout, perhaps seismic, perhaps atmospheric, but closer examination revealed it to be nothing of the sort.

While I cannot clearly remember *everything* I read there as I slowly worked down through the printout’s length, I can distinctly remember being utterly baffled by the realization that the entire, seemingly *endless* sheet was filled with nothing but what appeared to be conversations between an ‘Anya’ and a ‘Yuri’. 

I couldn’t help but read, and read, and read, and the more I read, the more bizarre it became. Seemingly normal conversations filled with pleasantries and greetings would often give way to incoherent nonsense. Oftentimes Anya would repeat herself over, and over again, and just as often Yuri would go on irrelevant, incoherent rants about nonsense. The last bit I can remember reading was something from Yuri, something about ‘I am coming, but the stars’, and had turned back to call out to Ivan.

However, before I could speak, my words hitched in my throat. In the distance, amongst the trees, I could make out Vladimir’s silhouette. He was almost back- how long had I been reading? It didn’t matter; I couldn’t let Vladimir know I had been snooping around the place, but even if he didn’t see me inside there was no doubt he’d find the complete lack of any preparations having been made as being *incredibly* suspect.

So, I rose to my feet, bolted out of the door, and shook Ivan awake as he had been so exhausted that he had apparently fallen asleep right there on the ground waiting for me. “Ivan!” 

“What?” Ivan mumbled, his eyes slowly fluttering open.

“Vlad! He’s back!” 

Ivan shot upright, his eyes wide. “*Blyat*!” he spat under his breath, rolling over onto his knees as he rummaged through the back, grabbed some wires and sticks of tethered explosives, and made a dash for the dish while trailing cables messily behind him as he went. “Sorry,” he blustered, “I fell asleep, comrade…”

“Quiet!” I hissed in a whisper-shout, “Get to it, quick!”

“I’m trying!” Ivan snapped back, looking back at Vladimir’s rapidly encroaching figure over his shoulder as he grabbed the cables in his hands, “It shouldn’t-”

That was it. It happened. To this day, I’m not exactly sure why it happened; my best guess is that Ivan had been so distracted he had accidentally put the wrong cables together, or pressed some sort of button, but I don’t know nearly enough about that sort of thing to say for sure. All I know is that in an instant it felt like my head was going to implode and I was soaring through the air, slamming my back *hard* against the side of the building. I can recall the back of my skull feeling very damp and very cold, along with a sensation like someone was twisting their finger inside my brain, and the last thing that I saw before my vision went dark was a thin cloud of red mist beginning to settle on the icy grass.

That was it. In my last, fleeting moments of semi-consciousness I was sure I was going to die. But, for reasons I am still not sure of to this very day, it wasn’t to be. 

It was like a scene from a movie, waking up from a coma to find my eyes blasted by an overwhelming glow of fluorescent light. I was tired, likely sedated, but from the little bit of the room I could see without turning my head I could safely guess I was in a hospital room of some sort, but unlike what always seems to happen in the movies, there was nobody standing over my bed to shout “He’s opened his eyes!” and run for a doctor. I could see there was a button by the IV with a drawing of a stick figure with a stethoscope on it, probably to call the doctors, but there was no way I’d be able to press it in the state I was in. My whole body was almost completely numb and tingly, kind of like when you hit your funny bone but on a far larger scale- it was as though I had somehow banged my entire body on the corner of a desk. 

It wasn’t until they made the rounds in the evening that I was finally discovered, and the startled nurse was soon followed by a group of three men. One, in the back, wore the garb of a soldier of some sort with a pistol holstered on his hip. I remember asking myself why he would bother wearing camouflage in a hospital, but that is neither here nor there I suppose. To his left, however, stood a portly little balding man in scrubs. He could’ve passed for George Costanza from the *Seinfeld* if he had been wearing glasses, I can tell you that. Finally, to the soldier’s right stood a rather unremarkable-looking man wearing beige trousers and a collared shirt. It was he who first spoke.

“Alexei?”

I had to take a moment to gather my breath, even just to eke out a soft “Yes?”

“I’m Dr. Abramov, it’s nice to meet you,” he replied, then gestured to the man in scrubs, “This is Dr. Vasiliev, and this…” Abramov turned to the soldier and snapped his fingers as if he had forgotten and was signalling for the soldier to jog his memory, only for the soldier to shake his head in the negative. “Ah, right.” 

“What… Mmghh..” I tried my hardest to grumble out, “... of my… com… com… c-com… rades…?”

“Eh…” Dr. Abramov waffled as the soldier to his back sniggered quietly, “Well, they… I suppose… Well, firstly, we don’t exactly *do* that anymore, Alexei.”

If I had any feeling in my eyebrows then I would’ve raised them. I sincerely had no idea what this man was saying.

After a moment’s pause, Dr. Vasiliev groaned and jabbed Dr. Abramov’s side with his elbow. “Oh, by god, tell the man already…”

Abramov paused once more, looking over at Dr. Vasiliev, before slowly looking back at me with an uncomfortable sigh. “I… Well, you see Alexei… The year now is… 1993, and the CCCP collapsed… Oh, about two years ago now, roughly.”

“You’ve been comatose for eight years, Alexei,” Dr. Vasiliev continued, and I could see the soldier begin to reach for his holster. He probably expected some sort of wild reaction from me when I heard that ‘bombshell’, kicking and screaming, calling them ‘liars’ and trying to tear myself free from the bed, but… I was calm. I suppose I didn’t have much choice in the matter, I was pumped full of drugs for just such a scenario I’d imagine.

“... Thoughts?” Vasiliev chimed in once more, hesitantly prodding for some sign of how I was taking the news.

“... I’m alive…” I mumbled with the meager energy I could muster.

At that, Abramov snorted as he looked over at Dr. Vasiliev, “See? Isn’t relanium wonderful?”

“What of my…” I tried to ask once more, “... my c-crew… Ivan… Vladim… Nrghh… Vlad…”

“I… don’t know,” Abramov exhaled limply, “I’d have to inquire…” 

“We found only you,” the soldier said, speaking up for the first time since he’d arrived. 

Had I had the energy to think of them, let alone ask them, I’m sure I would’ve then had so many questions to ask- I certainly do now. Soldiers found me? Saved my life? I had been, as I’d learn, bleeding out from a sizable hole in my skull when I’d lost consciousness slumped against that wall in the middle of Siberian nowhere. How in the world could that be? More curious, what really drives me nuts, is why in a nation like the USSR was I, but a heavy machine operator, a *nobody* to the state, given *extensive* medical treatment at *no* expense to me over the course of eight years?

“Enough talk,” Abramov waved his hand, “You must rest, for your health.” 

As though they’d been choreographed, the three simultaneously turned to face the door. I hadn’t the energy to say another word before they filed out into the hallway, and with all the sedatives in my system it was only a matter of time before I lacked the energy to even keep my eyes open anymore, finally drifting off into sleep, my first voluntary moment of unconsciousness in eight years. But it was not a restful sleep, but a troubled sleep which subjected me to dreams and visions so horrible I can still remember them vividly to this day. 

When my eyes first ‘opened’ in the dream, I found myself back. Back in Siberia. Back outside of Omsk. But I wasn’t back in that building, I was back *on* that building, standing on the roof in the dim of twilight, from which I could see that beyond the ring of firs which encircled me there was nothingness, and as my eyes drifted up to the night ‘sky’ it was as though there was no sky at all. Reds, blues, greens, blinding whites, it was like the celestial barrier that separated the heavens from the earth and all the cosmos had collapsed and were but one, nebulous clouds of unbelievable size hung over my head and swirled and flexed and shifted and twisted, and from those clouds of spacedust came a thick and viscous crimson rain that I knew, in that odd way you simply ‘know’ in your dreams, it was blood- Ivan’s blood- and the cloud of red mist flashed before my eyes and I shrieked and screamed and when I thrashed myself awake there was a man standing over my bed, looking right down at me.

“Are you alright?” Dr. Abramov smiled at me, his features slowly coming into focus in the dim moonlight.

I didn’t respond; terror still held hostage my voice. I only nodded.

“Good, good,” Abramov sat in a chair by the side of the bed, placing a paper bag on the ground as he rested his elbows on his legs and clasped his hands. “Now, I didn’t get the chance to ask earlier, but I have to know, what is the last thing you remember from before… your accident?”

“Before…?” Terror finally loosened its grip on my throat, “I remember a… an… an ‘Anya’? There were papers… an ‘Anya’ and a… a… a, uhm… ‘Yuri’...”

“Tsk tsk,” Abramov clicked his tongue before smiling at me once more, “I worried as much. Listen, you mustn’t speak of this to *anyone*, understand? Tomorrow the soldiers will come, and they will ask you the same question, and you must say you do not remember these things- er, rather, you must not say these things at all. Do you understand?”I nodded once more. I wasn’t entirely sure what Abramov was saying to me, but I knew well enough from living in the USSR for 26 years that sometimes it was just best to keep your mouth shut. 

“Good.” Abramov grinned, reaching down to the bag on the floor from which he produced a small portable radio, placing it delicately on my nightstand as he flicked it on. “Here, a present, from me to you. Think of it as a ‘get well soon’ gift, yes?”

I nodded for a third time.

Abramov rose to his feet, patted my shoulder gently, waved goodbye, and with that he took his leave. It was just me again in that room- me and the radio- in the dead of night. 

Part of me wanted to just drift back to sleep- probably the part of me still pumped full of sedatives- but the other part of me was terrified of what I’d just seen, and terrified I’d have to see it again if I drifted back into unconsciousness. This inner turbulence kept me tied to consciousness just long enough to hear a faint noise by the side of my bed. 

“Alexei?”

I froze. At first I had thought that Abramov had simply wandered back in the room, but even in my groggy state, I quickly realized that the voice I was hearing was not Abramov’s. I froze simply because my mind was unable to accept whose voice I was actually hearing, that I *knew* I was hearing.

“... Ivan…?” I whispered, my face half-hidden in my pillow like I was trying to trick my parents into thinking I was asleep. I didn’t want to turn around. I didn’t know what I’d see.

“Alexei, Alexei, worry not Alexei…” his voice continued, soft and distant, “I’m okay, Alexei, I’m fine.”

My heart skipped a beat. Could it be? Ivan was alive? Had he heard I’d woken and come to visit? They only found one body- mine. Could it… I whipped my head around, the tearing of stitches sending waves of pain through my body that couldn’t be masked even by the dull of painkillers but I paid it no mind. “Ivan-” 

Nothing. 

Just an empty, dark room. That was, except for the little red light of the tiny radio sitting on the table by my bed.

“Where a-” I began to ask, before I was interrupted by his voice once more

“- Alexei,” he interjected. It was as though I could hear him, but he couldn’t hear me. “Alexei, I’m alright, Alexei. Because of her. I’m alright because of her.”

By then it had become clear to me the faint voice was drifting out from the puny speaker of the little radio and so I grabbed it and pressed my ear right up against it. “Who, Ivan, who?” I whispered futilely into the cold, metal box.

“I’m alright, Alexei. I’m alright because of Anya.” 

Anya. My blood turned to ice. Anya. My heart dropped. Anya. That name again, hearing it aloud, hearing it from the radio, from the voice of a man I’d thought was dead, hearing it… Well, it made me feel dizzy. 

“Anya,” he went on, “Anya’s not our enemy, Alexei. Anya’s good, she’s very good. She’s only misunderstood. All she wants is to help her friend, how can that be wrong Alexei? Yuri… he’s been alone for so long, and Anya wants to help. She only wants to help, Alexei. She needs help too, Alexei. She needs *our* help. *Your* help, Alexei. Come back to her, to *us* Alexei. Please.”

I threw it. Tossed it. Smashed the thing on the ground in a cold sweat and gripped the paper-thin sheet of the hospital bed against my shivering body. Ivan was dead. I *knew* he was dead, even then, no matter how much I had hoped otherwise. I knew that no matter what *anyone* tried to tell me, he was dead. He was alive, then he was nothing more than a cloud of damp, red mist on some icy grass. He was dead, and it seemed that not even *Ivan* could tell me otherwise. I *knew* he was dead.

For the longest time I had simply chocked this up to being yet another awful dream. I convinced myself that the cocktail of drugs flowing through my veins had, in a sense, an adverse reaction to the trauma I’d been through and that voice from the radio was nothing but a symptom of that foul combination, and for years, it worked. For *years* I was safely able to convince myself of this; I was able to say to myself ‘It was all a dream’ and I was able to believe it with the whole of my heart. 

When I left the hospital, I was sure it was a dream. When I met Natasha, I was sure it was a dream. When Adrian was born, I was sure it was a dream. I was a man with a wife and a child, a normal man; I was not a man who would hear voices of the dead from a radio, I was not a madman. Now, it seems I was right about one thing. I was not, and am not, a madman. I was wrong, though; it was not a dream, and now, whether I like it or not, I have proof. 

When I came home from work, I could sense Natasha was displeased immediately. She didn’t seem angry, but she was obviously not *happy*. I slung my jacket over a chair by the doorway and glanced over at her, and before I had the chance to ask what was wrong, she tapped my shoulder tentatively and, in a hushed voice, told me we needed to talk. If I have learned one thing from being married, it is that it is rarely a good thing to ‘talk’. 

I wasn’t going to object and make things any worse than they probably were. Instead, I followed her into the kitchen where, after she looked around for a brief moment to see whether Adrian was in earshot, she took a seat, and I followed in kind.

“What’s wrong, Nat?”

“It’s… Adrian.” She replied, and I hate to admit that I had a brief moment of relief, thinking that maybe it was not me who was in trouble. “He.. well… Alexei, who is Anya?”

Any comfort or relief I might have been feeling was erased *immediately*. The name hit me like a tonne of bricks. For the briefest of moments, it was almost like I was back there. Back in bed. Then back in the building. Back on the roof. Back looking at the ‘sky’. Back in the rain. The red rain.

She could see I wasn’t going to talk, so she simply continued. She told me, as I tried not to slip into the depths of panic and despair, that on the way home from school that day our son Adrian had been saying something to her about a woman named ‘Anya’ and had asked her whether Anya and I were going to ‘see each other soon’, but as soon as Natasha tried to confront him about this, Adrian clammed up.

Now I understood. She thought I was cheating, of all things. 

“I don’t know any Anya,” I only half lied, seeing as technically I *don’t* know any Anya. I have never met Anya, I know nothing *about* Anya… but she wasn’t having it. Now, she was mad. Seems she was expecting an explanation, not ignorance.

“We will see,” Natasha scowled, rising from her seat as she took me by the wrist and led me into the main room where Adrian sat on the carpet, playing with his toys. I shot her a little look, wondering if she was really planning to drag our son into all of this, and it seemed she was. 

“Adrian, darling,” Natasha cooed in the sweetest voice she could manage, “Could you please tell us more about… Anya?”

Adrian paused as he glanced between us. I could easily tell he was frightened, worried he had somehow gotten me into trouble. Clearly he wasn’t fooled by his mother’s tone- he could sense the venom dripping beneath the honey. 

“Go ahead,” I tried to encourage him, frightened yet curious myself as to how this whole mess had come about. I had certainly never spoken of Anya, not to him, not to anyone- save for Abramov, at least.

He was silent for a moment, before his eyes darted to the corner of the room. When I followed his gaze, I could feel my heart beginning to pound out of my chest. His eyes had settled on the old wooden radio in the corner of the room. 

“Anya…” He gulped, “I… she was on the radio, she was saying she needed dad’s help…”

Immediately, I could see Natasha soften. She looked up at me, and I just shrugged back at her, trying my hardest to mask the creeping dread which was gradually overcoming my very being. 

I won’t waste any more of your time than I already have. Luckily, Natasha became convinced this was all some sort of misunderstanding and forgave me, Adrian forgot about the whole thing in a matter of days, but me?

That night, I couldn’t sleep a wink. I couldn’t even say I *wanted* to sleep if I could. I was so scared, scared that every time I closed my eyes I might find myself back there, back on the roof, back on those woods, under that ‘sky’, and back in the rain… Anya was real. She must be. I heard it. Adrian heard it. We heard her. What about Ivan? Is Ivan *real*? Is Ivan *alive*? Were they really, truly real, out there, back in those woods, back at that building, back in the middle of nowhere, and they needed help? Need my help?Really, I need *your* help. I have barely been able to eat, and I have barely been able to sleep. I have hardly been able to *live* since that night. It consumes me, every moment of every day of my life, and the thought that keeps eating away at me is if I should go back there. If I should go ‘help’ them.

Please. Help me. I’m so, so scared. Please.
