I was the victim of a break-in, someone came to my house and took something so important from me that my life is empty without it and it could happen to you too. 

About a month ago, in the early days of December, I was awoken by a sound in the night. My mind went into an overdrive, however not because I was scared but because I had always been prepared for an intruder. I picked up my gun and slowly went to confront the thief in my home. 

I lived alone and while I was not in a particularly dangerous part of town, break ins did occur here. So I bought my gun for safety a couple of years ago, being only twenty seven years old I needed to be able to defend myself. However what I didn't know was that It wasn't possible to defend myself from what was in my home

I was only able to put this together recently but I learnt that we live in a three dimensional world. In a three dimensional world we can interact with other three dimensional beings, but we also have power over two dimensional beings. To them we are God's. 

Picture for a second a drawing of a little Girl, We'll call her Sally. In the drawing Sally is holding a box, in the box she has her candy because she doesn't want anyone to steal it. The problem is that because she is two dimensional she can only guard four sides of the box. 

The top, the bottom, the side directly facing her and the side facing away from her. However as a three dimensional being we have access to six sides of the box, the four sides Sally is guarding and two extra sides that she doesn't know exist. Which means we can sneak in and steal Sally's candy from her without her even knowing, from the sides of the box she can't even comprehend. 

I slowly made my way down the stairs and towards the sound, sneaking around every corner because the intruder could have been anywhere in my house. The thought of someone I didn't know, looking through my things made me sick so I checked every room and even though I could hear the sounds, I couldn't see anyone. When I finally got to the kitchen I came to the realisation that there probably wasn't any intruder in my home. Instead a small animal like a rat or squirrel must have broken in. I had become all defensive for nothing. 

The pain I felt next was nothing like I ever felt before, I can't begin to describe it accurately but to put it simply it felt like someone had shoved their hand into my back and was pulling out my internal organs. I knew what this was, I was dying. I had either been stabbed or shot in the back and the world around was slowly fading from bright to black. Than there was nothing for a while.

Death is exactly what you imagine it to be, I awoke in my kitchen in our world, but it was different. There was a tint of blue all around, I felt empty inside and it was incredibly cold. By that point I didn't know how long I had been dead for but they had probably already taken my body away and put me in a morgue freezer. That would explain how I was feeling, there was probably some mortician poking around my insides, taking out my organs and trying to find out my cause of death. My conscience, most probably linked to my soul, was just floating around in the place I died. The only thing left now was to figure out what to do next.

I was terrified of being dead, there was so much I hadn't done yet, there were so many people I wanted to say goodbye to. I would never be able to do those things or see those people because as you know, the dead can't communicate with the living. I could feel the fear deep in my bones.

Now, according to pop culture, the only thing I had left to do was find the light. 

I searched every room in my home but there was no light to be found. So I stepped outside into the early morning. It was empty just like I expected it to be, but it was still unmistakably blue. Maybe this wasn't home, maybe this was purgatory.

When I reached the street in front of me I pondered which way to go, the light at the end of the road or tunnel could be anywhere in this town, anywhere in this world. I could be searching for years.

I was startled once again by the sound coming from next door, something was stepping out the door, would it be a monster, a ghost. Maybe it was a demon who would torture me and I was actually in hell being punished. 

It was none of those things, instead my neighbour Jim stepped out, his work uniform on. Just like every morning he made his way to his car, turned it on and reversed out of his driveway. Stopping in front of me he let out a Polite "Hello".

"You can see me" I said, a little more panicked than I should have.

"Yes of course" He smiled back "Which is unfortunate because you're in your boxers, you may want to change kid".

He drove away and I found myself embarrassed, I literally overreacted and thought I was dead. I hurried inside and checked my home for an intruder once again. There was no one there and I couldn't figure out why I passed out. I would soon find something though as when I went to change for work I noticed a strange mark on my body. 

On my lower back, where the pain had first hit me, there was a dark red mark with scarring all over it. I don't remember ever being hurt in that area.

The day went on as usual and everyone could see me, I spoke to everyone and nothing was out of the ordinary for them. For me however the world remained blue and cold, and since that day, that's how it's always been. 

I saw a doctor later that week and he did confirm that it was a burn mark, nothing more and nothing less. When I told him I had never been injured in that spot he said it must have happened as a child and that I probably just  didn't remember it.

In the weeks that I followed I desperately tried to ignore the changes in my life but I couldn't. I couldn't ignore feeling freezing cold, I couldn't ignore the blue tint around me and I couldn't ignore the empty feeling inside. Something was stolen from me that night but it wasn't a physical object. 
 
About a week ago I was finally able to put together a theory and my conclusion was that even though I was alive, I was still dead. You see the cold, the missing parts of me and the shades of blue were all signs that even though I was present in the human world, I was missing the thing that made me human. That being my soul.

Without my soul I was just a corpse walking around.

The invisible intruder that entered my home a while ago had stolen my soul from me, without me even knowing, the only evidence being the burn mark on my back. As far as I can tell there is only one type of being that can steal something without the victim knowing. 

As three dimensional beings we can steal candy from Sally, a two dimensional being, without her knowing. We are like God's to her. However what if we are not the last dimension. What if there was something above us, that could steal things from us without us knowing, with access to parts of us that we can't comprehend. A fourth dimensional being.
