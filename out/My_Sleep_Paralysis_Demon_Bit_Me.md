I have suffered with sleep paralysis since I was a child. Through out all my years of dealing with this, I have had some truly horrific experiences. However, the one I had a couple of days ago has been the worst one yet. 

I woke up not feeling the greatest. I was up a few hours and after not feeling much better, I decided to lay back down and try to nap it off. 

I was turned on my side facing away from our bedroom door on the far side of mine and my husband's king sized bed. I felt my body relax and I fell asleep rather quickly.

Next thing I remember is slowly opening my eyes and seeing our bedroom wall and the door that leads to our bathroom (as the bathroom door was closed). I then tried to move and couldn't. As I've been through this many, many times, I was already mentally telling myself I was in sleep paralysis and I needed to focus on trying to move a little (such as wiggling my fingers - a tip I learned online). However, I'm already feeling scared and I can feel my heart racing. 

I then hear the sound of our bedroom door open and close behind me as our bedroom door makes a very loud and distinct "popping" noise. I immediately thought it was my husband coming in to check on me and thought he'd be able to get me to snap out of this horror. 

That thought quickly vanished as I heard heavy stomping running around the bed until they stopped directly in front of me and I see a very large and tall black figure standing in front of our bathroom door. This is the same figure I encounter in almost all of my sleep paralysis experiences. I can never make out any features. 

Before I can register any other thoughts, the large figure lunges at me! I feel the heavy weight of this thing on my body and it feels like it's crushing me! Especially in my ribs!

As previously mentioned, I'm still laid on my side with both my arms pulled up and my hands are tucked under my pillow. 

By now, I've closed my eyes and I'm trying so desperately to move! That's when I felt teeth burying into my ribs! I don't know how to truly describe the awful feeling! It's an intense feeling of pressure, pain and almost a tickling sensation and it's one of the worst things I've ever felt!

At this point, I'm trying to thrash away and trying to scream but I'm still completely paralyzed and I feel like I have no air left in me and I never am able to make a sound. 

I can literally feel this thing's mouth opening and closing in different spots along the side of my ribs!

At this point, I'm mentally screaming and pleading to snap out of it!

Next thing I know, I sit straight up in the bed. My heart is racing, I'm broke out in a cold sweat and I can still feel tingles in my ribs on my left side. 

After my eyes dart around the room and I find it to be completely empty, I lift up my shirt to inspect my side. The skin is not broken, but the whole left side of my ribcage is bright red. 

I've done a good amount of research on sleep paralysis and I understand the scientific explanation for it, but waking up with physical marks from these experiences is brand new to me. 

I have had a ton of anxiety when it's bedtime every since this experience. I have truly come to understand "no sleep".
