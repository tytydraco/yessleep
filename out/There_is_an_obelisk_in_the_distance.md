It is steely gray and surrounded by swirling clouds of the same color. Where they meet, there is cold darkness, periodically permeated by flashes of strange light. I cannot remember when it first came to me. Perhaps it has always been there, just out of sight. 

It can still pass from my vision. When I’m surrounded by tall buildings or dense trees, it is obscured. But when the buildings aren’t tall enough, or the tress dense enough, the top of it, penetrating into the swirling gray clouds… taunts me. And when there is nothing between me and the horizon, it looms. 

I do not think I am the only one who can see it. I once noticed an old man staring in its direction outside of a grocery store. I too looked for a time, its tip peeking over the rooftops of the surrounding shops. He turned to me and smiled a strange smile. I wanted to ask if he saw what I saw. But I did not.

Sometimes it emits a low hum. A deep bass that rolls over me. It causes animals to cower and hide. It affects birds the worst. Causes them to circle in strange and intricate patters, squawking wildly, before always, inevitably, forming up and flying directly toward the obelisk in the distance. 

When I stare at it for too long, my mind begins to slip. I become disconnected from myself. From reality. Time does strange things. I can lose myself for what feels like hours, only to come back after mere moments. Or the inverse, I look for what seems to be a few seconds, only to have my shoulder shaken by a passerby who says I have been staring at nothing for an extended amount of time. 

I feel it growing closer. I don’t know if it’s possible to tell by looking. It is still so far away. But its presence… it grows. I always feel it. It tells of something to come. I do not know what, or how I know this. But I know. It is a harbinger.

What’s strange is… I have come to yearn for it. I’ve taken to going out on my balcony at night, and finding the monolith in the darkness. I gaze upon it for an unknowable amount of time. Until I lose myself in a formless haze. I always come back in the middle of my subsequent day. Not passed out on my balcony, or even in my bed. No, I find myself going through the motions at work, or around my house, not knowing how I came to get there. The time is just… lost. 

But when I do come around, I am almost immediately filled with the desire to see the obelisk again. It consumes me. 

Please, if you know of this obelisk, or hear its low call, reach out to me. I do not want to witness this alone anymore. We can gaze upon it, experience the obelisk in the distance, together.
