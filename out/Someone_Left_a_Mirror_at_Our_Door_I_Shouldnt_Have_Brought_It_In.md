As I stand in front of my brother’s tombstone, I wonder if it was my fault that he’s gone.

I try to erase it from my head but it seems to never leave. I can still hear my brother’s screams echo through my head.

I was ten and he was six. My brother was short and rawboned and a slow runner when it came to seeing who got on the tire swing first.

He had a great imagination, whether it was dragons fighting an army of lightning-covered chickens, mighty buildings growing legs, or goblins hatching from eggs that were scattered over thick tree branches.

I took my brother's creative thoughts and used them out in our backyard. I would screech like an owl holding a sword in its claws and my brother would laugh until he fell onto the grassy ground. Sometimes we would use props, like sticks as wands and dad’s scrap boards as sleds.

Mom would catch us and tell us to put them away or else we could get hurt. And out of nowhere, my brother would shout that mom was a crazy alien-half-tiger trying to trick us, and I would start laughing until I fell to my knees.

One night when we were all eating dinner, the doorbell rang. We didn’t get many visitors.

I excused myself from the dining table and scurried to the front door. I opened the door and I was greeted by a tall mirror leaning against the wall. The frame was black and had carvings on each corner of the mirror that were shaped like moths.

“Who is it?” Dad called from the dining room.

I peeked out of the door and looked around. There was no one. I examined the mirror. No note or anything. Dad came up behind me, nearly startling me.

“Did you see anyone?” he asked.

“Nobody,” I replied. “Someone must have dropped it off. Maybe they got the wrong house?”

Dad tilted his head back. “Honey, did you order a mirror?”

“I didn't,” mom responded.

“What are we going to do with it?” I asked dad.

“Leave it there,” he said, and walked back to the dining room. “Maybe the owner will come back for it…”

But I had other plans. Who wouldn’t want free stuff? I grasped the mirror with a grunt and lumbered towards the stairs. Dad and mom were too busy eating their meal to notice me taking the mirror upstairs. However, my brother saw what I was doing and gave me a long glance.

Climbing up the stairs felt like walking up a steep dirt hill while holding a heavy backpack. I kept bumping the corners of the mirror on the plaster walls, knowing that it must have made a dent. Once I reached the top of the stairs, I waddled toward the end of the hallway and entered our room. I placed the mirror right next to the closet door.

Suddenly, I saw my brother appear in the mirror.

“Jesus!” I gasped.

“You brought the mirror?” my brother questioned. He walked over to the mirror and brushed his fingertips against the glass.

I shrugged. “Dad and mom won’t mind. If the owner does come back, we’ll return it.”

My brother just smiled in response.

\*\*\*

That was the night when something happened.

As I tried to fall asleep, I could hear footsteps shuffling around the bedroom. But I ignored them, thinking it was just my brother or mom or dad in the hallways. Then the footsteps stopped, right next to me. Suddenly, I heard a whisper:

“Samuel.”

My eyes opened quickly, wondering who woke me up from my sleep. I propped myself up with my elbows and saw my brother scrunched up in the corner of his bed, his back against the wall. He was shaking like a leaf terribly.

“What is it?” I groaned.

But my brother didn’t answer. His eyes were just focused on the mirror. I looked too, but I only saw our reflection. I stared at myself with a disappointed face. My brother, however, was trying to scooch back further like he was about to dissolve into the walls.

“Get it away…” my brother muttered. “Get it away…”

“Get what away, exactly?” I asked.

“It’s so tall, its head is touching the ceiling,” he gulped. “It’s just standing there, big white eyes and it's smiling at me...”

I shook my head. “I don’t see anything. Don’t you imagine things too seriously and actually see things?”

But my brother shrieked and snuck underneath his blanket, huddling like a roly poly. I stared deeply look at the mirror, but all I saw was myself staring at me.

\*\*\*

The next morning, I tried to calm my brother down by being in our backyard, away from the mirror. I was watering mom’s purple and yellow flowers while Parker was swinging on the tire swing.

“Are those Things real?” Parker questioned.

*Things?*

I scoffed. “*Your* imagination is too real. They can’t be real. Maybe you’re just being too paranoid.”

Parker stopped swinging. “But... are you sure?”

“Trust me,” I responded. “We’ll return the mirror back to the owner anyway. If it really bothers you, sleep in mom's room.”

My brother sighed and pouted slightly.

“Okay,” he said, and he ran into the house before I could react.

Honestly, I did feel bad. So I put down the watering can, looked up, only to see someone just in the corner of the wooden fence. It just stared.

And stared.

And stared.

Its wide and white eyes looked like it was trying to vacuum me in. Pearly sharp teeth with red sap between its teeth. My brother was right, it was horrifyingly tall. I twirled around and ran into the house, not looking back.

I opened the door and shut it, my sweaty and dirty palms against the door. But I was too curious. Was it really there? So I got on my tippy-toes and peeked through the glass. It was gone.

\*\*\*

Outside the window, the darkness ate up the bright blue sky and splattered twinkling white stars. Dad made us pasta and mom prepared lemonade. I sat very still on my seat. My brother was upstairs being creative.

“He's is not coming?” dad asked, sitting down.

“He said he’s not hungry,” mom sighed, scooping up some baked pasta on her plate.

I stared at the glass cup. For a few seconds, I thought I saw it again. I snapped my head around. There was nothing. Hallucinations. I must be hallucinating.

I scooped up some pasta and smacked them onto my plate. Suddenly, the lights went off. I froze and it went quiet.

“Dad!” yelled my brother from upstairs. “I can’t see!”

“I know!” dad shouted. “I thought I paid the bills…”

I couldn’t see anything, until something appeared in the corner of my eye. I looked up.

It was crawling on the ceiling.

I screamed and fell out of my chair. Mom cursed and dad shouted something. The Thing was crawling like how a lizard would, legs and arms bent and curving its body. It looked at me and snapped its head ninety degrees. The Thing then skittered away without hesitation. Rattling and creaking noises croaked throughout the house.

“Where’s the flashlight?” dad growled, moving around.

It suddenly went quiet. No more drawers or cabinets opening, no more footsteps. Was the Thing still here? Where was it?

That’s when my heart dropped.

I ran out of the living room, bumping into walls. But I didn’t stop. I found the mountain of stairs and started to run. I hurried down the hallway and reached the bedroom. I collided against a rigid wall and immediately tried to find the doorknob, but it was like finding a needle in a haystack.

“Help me open the door!” I cried loudly. “OPEN IT!"

My hands were moving wildly around the door. I could hear dad and mom screaming at each other. Finally, I felt something cold and round and twisted it.

The door swung open and a cold breeze brushed against my face. I ran across the room, tripping against stiff blocks and soft piles. I felt another knob and pulled it.

I shoved my hand into the dark box, frantically trying to feel a thick stick. When I finally did, I pulled it out and flicked the switch. A great golden light shone out of the stick, aiming towards the closet door.

I swayed my hand, trying to find my brother. Then the light glimmered onto a body laying on the ground with a blanket stained with red, tightly wrapped around its face. The figure stayed still.

“What are you doing?” I asked weakly.

And then with a click, the lights turned back on. I froze. It was crouching in the corner of my bed, watching me.

Its mouth had red and pink gunk hanging between its teeth.

My mattress was smeared with dark red.

I looked back at the figure and grasped the blanket from them. He was still limp. I dropped the flashlight as I stared above my brother's neck, where a pile of ripped flesh laid on the carpet, staining it slowly.

\*\*\*

So it was my fault.

This is why I’m standing in front of this tombstone that reads my brother’s name.

I open my umbrella and keep staring at my brother’s name, engraved deep in the stone. Slowly, a puddle forms next to my feet. I step away, look over at the puddle, seeing my worn out face look back at me. I only stare.

And the Thing stares back too.
