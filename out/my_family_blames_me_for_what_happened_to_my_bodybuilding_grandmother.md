If I remember correctly, it all started with a gallon of milk. 

“Oh my stars, this is heavy. Be a good lad and help your Nanna with the milk.”

I was in the kitchen of my grandmother’s ground-floor apartment, helping her unload her weekly shopping. She waddled over to another bag, in search of something lighter. Nanna always reminded me of a snowman, what with her spherical cap of white curls, twig-like arms, and a shuffling, bottom-heavy gait. In a single, thoughtless moment, I lifted the milk container  one-handed and placed it in the refrigerator. Nanna’s eyes lit up with wonder. 

“Ah! Thank you, dear. You’re so strong! You’ve always been such a strong, strong boy.”

“Not really, Nanna.” I said, embarrassed. “It’s only a milk jug. That hardly makes me Arnold Schwarzenegger. Anybody could do it.”

I wasn’t expecting to see the twinkle leave her eye. I didn’t mean to make her wrinkled face sink with sadness. I was only trying to make her feel better. 

Lying in bed that night, I was too depressed over Nanna to sleep. What I said might’ve been careless, but was I wrong? Practically anybody *should* be able to lift a milk jug. Nanna included. After all, the woman hadn’t yet reached 80, and she was still living on her own. Hardly helpless. I did some research on my phone and found that a gallon of milk weighs less than eight pounds. Eight pounds. 

I came up with a plan. Then I went looking for my credit card.

“I love you dear, but this all seems a bit silly to me.” 

We were standing in the center of Nana’s living room, the glass-topped coffee table with its cargo of candy dishes and old National Geographics shoved aside to make room for us. I was wearing my gym clothes; Nana was decked out in a colorful, baggy tracksuit that hadn’t seen much wear since the 1980s. 

“Come on Nana, it’ll be fun. Now pick up those dumbbells. It’s time to PUMP YOU UP!”

Without laughing at my hilarious impression, she trepidatiously hefted the pair of pink 2.5lb weights I had ordered for her online. I shot her a confident smile and hit play on my workout mix. The opening beats of True Faith filled the vanilla-scented apartment. 

“Ok,” I said, picking up my own 20-pounders, “let me show you how to do a hammer curl.”

By the year’s first snowfall, Nanna had graduated to a set of 8lb dumbbells that were lime-green and had to be specially ordered. I almost laughed for joy, standing in the cozy apartment that morning, watching my once-frail grandmother executing standing shoulder-presses as Alanis Morissette screamed encouragement from the bluetooth. 

After our second session with the green weights, I decided to spring it on her: 

“Nanna, I have a surprise for you. Wait here.” 

I ran out to my car and returned with two gallon-jugs of 1% milk. 

“Can you help me with these?” I smiled.

The video we made that day didn’t go viral, but it was certainly shared by all of our friends and family who still used social media. I’m proud to say it even reached the feeds of some friends-of-friends and forgotten former co-workers. The video was great: tracksuitted Nanna, her arms no longer so stick-like, curling a milk jug in each hand as KC and the Sunshine Band insisted she *shake shake shake*. 

Unfortunately, the publicizing of my and Nanna’s triumph wasn’t all happy comments and crying-while-laughing emojis. Uncle Erline called to yell at me for trying to give his mother a heart attack. 

“You think this is funny? A woman her age bodybuilding. You should be ashamed! You want she should have a stroke while you make another funny video? I’m sure that would get you all kinds of karma-memes and super-likes from your internet friends. Is that what you want?!”

My mother was almost worse with her passive-aggressive emailing: medical articles about the dangers of intense exercise for the elderly and cherry-picked news pieces on people who had died at the gym.

I had initially thought we’d be done once Nanna mastered milk-weights, but the old girl was more game than ever, insisting that we continue with training. So I ignored my family and kept the sessions going, not sharing their concerns with Nanna. At least, at first…

“Since when do you eat protein bars?” I asked, unloading my grandmother’s weekly shopping. 

“Can I borrow your 20s, dear?” She asked, ignoring my question. “These twelve-pounders feel like air.”

“Uh, maybe. I don’t know. That’s kind of a big jump. I can get you some fifteens for next time,” I offered. “Or 17.5 pounders,” I quickly added, shriveling under Nanna’s snowman glare.

The next time I came over to visit, I found Nanna already in her tracksuit, sweating and hefting my 20lb weights while antique dance music emanated from her stereo.

“Nanna! Wha– Are you using my 20s? Is that Chubby Checker?”

“Oh! Hello. Dear.” She said, grunting between rows. “You were. A bit late. So I got started. Without you. I can’t. Can’t kill my gains.” 

“Nanna, I’m really proud of you and all, but, um…” 

“Spit. It out.”

“Some people are starting to worry. Mom and Erline, you know?” I said, turning the music down as Nanna continued her reps. “They think that what we’re doing isn’t exactly safe. What with your age, and intense exercise, and…” I trailed off, feeling absurdly intimidated.

Nanna gave one last grunt and dropped the weights. The whole floor shook. 

“Well isn’t that silly,” she said, giving me her full attention at last. “Look at me! I’m fit as a fiddle. Now come on and let’s try out the Romanian deadlift!”

“Hey, what are those?” I asked, pointing to an unfamiliar pharmacy bottle on the coffee table.

“Oh, it’s nothing,” Nanna said, sharply. “They’re Mrs. Hannick’s, across the street. For anemia.” She waved a hand dismissively. “They threw out a bunch of her things when she passed.“

I examined the bottle: Anadrol 50mg. My blood turned to ice.

“Nanna, this has gotten out of hand.” I said, trying to keep my voice firm. “What you’re doing isn’t healthy anymore. Everyone agrees. We need to slow down.”

“Absolutely not, young man!” She exclaimed, her face hot and red beneath snowy curls. “Those fools have always been worryworts. But you! You’re just angry that poor frail Nanna doesn’t need you to carry her goddamn groceries anymore.”

“Oh my god, Nanna, it’s not that. You’re going to hurt yourself.” I said, shaking the pills. “You need–”

“I’ll tell you what I don’t need: I don’t need you slowing me down anymore!” 

I was starting to get truly scared. Who was this woman?

“Nanna,” I stuttered. “I can’t be a part of this anymore. No more training sessions.”

“Boo hoo,” she spat, with a bitter sarcasm I had never heard before. “I certainly didn’t need your expert training this morning.” 

“Fine. You’re a grownup,” I said, fighting a hot rush of tears. “I wash my hands of this.” 

Her nostrils flared. Nanna’s glare was enough to make me cower. I let the bottle of steroids drop to the floor and nearly ran back through the snow to my chilly car.

Even after everything, my family still blames me and the training sessions for Nanna’s death. I don’t know if they’re wrong. She didn’t have a heart attack or stroke while pumping iron. Nothing like that. In fact, all we really know for sure is what was included in the police report: a mugging gone horribly wrong, a small group of gang-affiliated youth…
