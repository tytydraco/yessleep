Part I

I was a socially awkward kid, the kind who ate lunch away from everyone and rarely said a word. Making friends seemed like something everyone but me could do, until I met Seth. We were at school and I happened to hear him talking about the new game his mom bought him. It was a game I happened to be really into so I jumped into the conversation before I could talk myself out of it. We bonded over our love of the game and he invited me over. We’ve been best friends ever since. Lately though—because of everything that’s happened—I’ve been looking back on these early days a little less fondly.

Seth and I spent most of our summers talking about things we’d never actually do. We made big plans and never followed through. But one day, we decided we were really going to build a treehouse. After convincing both our parents, all that was left was finding the right spot. Behind Seth’s house was a dense pine forest, so that was the obvious choice. We searched for about half an hour through the humid, sticky, air. Trees of all shapes and sizes surrounded us as the crickets and birds sang. Eventually we stumbled into a clearing.

It looked almost too perfect—a circle, maybe fifty or seventy-five feet across. Right in the center stood an old stone well, nearly swallowed by moss. The moss was reminiscent of a giant snake, slithering its way up and down the well. The moment I saw it, I felt something shift. Not fear exactly, but a pull. Like it had been waiting for us.

“Dude, this is perfect!” he said walking up to the well as if it was another blade of grass, “We can build the tree house over there—away from the creepy stone thing.”

I wasn’t looking at the tree line though, I was still staring at the well. Seth kept rambling about treehouse ideas, but I kept drifting toward the well. As I got closer, I noticed the stone around the rim had been chiseled in a ripple pattern that spread toward the water hole. The well was about ten feet deep before dropping off into an even darker pit. I almost missed it—but as I stared at the far wall, transfixed, I saw something. There, on a narrow ledge of dirt jutting from the inner wall, sat a single black dahlia.

“Travis, what’re you doing?” Seth’s voice broke me from the trance as I staggered backwards.

“I was just looking at this well. It’s beautiful.”

“The well is beautiful?”

“Yeah…” Seth gave a short laugh, but it didn’t sound amused. “You’re kinda freaking me out man, are you getting enough sleep?”

“Yeah,” I said, not even sure if I believed it myself. “I’m fine.” Seth walked up to me and looked at the well. “Is there anything down there?”

“Nothing really, just a flower and water.” Seth walked closer and peeked into the hole. “What flower?” I blinked. The flower was gone. Not fallen—gone. No trace of it on the stones below, no sign of it ever being there at all. I didn’t answer him. My eyes were still locked on the place where it had been. My skin crawled. “Let’s just go back to your place, we can do this tomorrow. You’re not looking so good.” I nodded, still not fully looking away from the well. It felt like turning your back on something you’re not sure is real—or worse, something you were sure was.

We walked back to my house in near silence, occasionally breaking it to point out an animal or make some half-hearted comment about the woods. The summer heat was still heavy, but it was suddenly a lot less noticeable. The trees whispered above us, branches swaying as the wind blew across them. The air felt different—not colder or thicker, but wrong. Like something had shifted in the clearing. Something I couldn’t name, let alone understand.

When we got to my place I told my mom I wasn’t feeling well. She offered me some soup and ginger ale but I declined. My room was familiar—posters on the wall, controller wires tangled together on the carpet, the ceiling fan clicking with every rotation, but I couldn’t settle. My mind kept circling back to the well. The flower. The way it vanished, like it had never existed at all. Seth booted up Mortal Kombat and handed me a controller. I lost every match we played. I couldn’t focus, I felt anxious, like I was being watched.

That night, I dreamt of the clearing and the well. The sky was grey and dreary and the forest was covered in shadows. I looked around and saw nothing strange so I started walking towards the well. As I approached it, black, thorny vines started slithering out of the well and approaching me. I tried to run but vines came up from the ground and wrapped around my feet. I was stuck in place as the vines started to wrap around me, cutting into my flesh. Hundreds of thorns poked into me as I collapsed into a bed of vines. The vines slowly made their way up my body.

I screamed as thorns tore through my skin, sharp and endless. I thrashed and struggled but it only pushed them deeper into me. I eventually gave up, tears rolling down my face as I accepted my fate. Right before I was completely swallowed by the vines I saw something. A silhouette behind the tree line, human-like in shape. There was something off about it though. I stared at it as the vines slowly engulfed my entire body.

I jolted upright, chest heaving, heart slamming against my ribs. It took minutes to steady my breath, to remind myself I was safe. I grounded myself, counting each breath until I felt stable again. As I got out of bed I looked around my room. Nothing was out of the ordinary and there was nothing going on. I let out a sigh of relief before turning around. What I saw still haunts me. Sitting right there on the outside of my window, was a single Black Dahlia.

Part II

I opened my windotw, heart still pounding from the nightmare. The flower was still there. I reached out and grabbed it, my fingers brushing the petals—and I felt dizzy. My knees buckled slightly as I placed the flower on my nightstand and sat back down. I took deep breaths until the black dots faded from my vision.

When I stood again, the flower was gone. Not wilted or on the floor. Just… gone. My heart sank. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe the heat had gotten to me yesterday and now my brain was playing tricks. I told myself that over and over as I got dressed—trying to believe it. I called Seth. We agreed to hang out at his place that afternoon.

Until then, I just lay around the house, trying not to think about the well. About the flower. About the way it vanished right in front of me—again. As time passed I looked at the clock, 10:07, I sighed heavily as I waited for time to pass. It felt like maybe ten minutes had passed—but when I looked again, it was 11:02. I was confused—how had so much time passed in what felt like a moment?

As 12 o’clock approached I got my shoes on and got ready to leave. As I was about to walk out I saw my cat, King, eating out of his food bowl. I walked up to him to try to pet him but his tail raised up as he slowly backed away. He hissed repeatedly before running away incredibly fast. I had known King since he was a kitten, he’d never hissed at me before, not even when I’d accidentally stepped on his tail. I stared down the hallway that King had vanished in, there was a shadow, a black figure that dragged something behind it as it disappeared into the darkness. I tried to shake it off and as I walked out the front door.

The sky was cold and grey when I stepped outside. By the time I crossed the street, the drizzle had turned to a downpour. Then thunder cracked, low and heavy, and rain fell in sheets. I walked into Seth’s house soaked to the bone, water dripping from my sleeves. I shivered as I climbed the stairs, only stopping to wave at his mom who was making her famous French onion soup. He laughed when I stepped into his room and tossed me a towel. “You look like you got hit by a wave,” he said. I forced a smile as I started drying off.

“The weather hates me. What can I say?” I peeled off my coat, letting it hit the floor with a wet flop. “I think this thing’s done for.” Seth slid further onto his bed, getting comfortable.

“You’ve had that coat since, what—sixth grade? Just burn it already. Put it out of its misery.”

“I can’t. It’s sentimental.”

“Dude, it smells like that well water from yesterday.” I tried to laugh, but it came out thin. “I’m surprised mom even let you in the house looking like that,” Seth added.

“She offered soup. I said no.”

“Bro. You turned down my mom’s soup? You’re actually crazy.”

“Maybe.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Maybe?”

I shrugged.

“I don’t know. I didn’t sleep much.”

“Nightmares?”I hesitated.

“Sort of.”

“About the well that freaked you out?”

“About what was in the well.” He didn’t respond instantly. He just looked at me for a second—longer than usual—and then handed me the game controller.

“Nightmares are weird man, try not to think about it too much. One time I dreamed about my dad with a horse head. Freaky shit. What you should think about is who you’re going to play while you lose like ten times in a row.” I tried to shake it off and sat across from him while he started navigating the menu; talking about new combos he discovered. I wasn’t really listening though, I was letting my attention wander around the room. It was all familiar—posters we’d both picked out, a bookshelf full of comics we collected, and on top sat photos of summers and birthdays gone.

One picture caught my eye. It was us—maybe ten or eleven—standing in his backyard. I remembered that day: water balloons, grilled hot dogs, the rusty old trampoline with a few broken springs. But something was off.

The background looked darker than it should’ve. The trees behind us—too many. Thicker. Tangled. And near my leg, in the bottom corner of the frame, I saw something I didn’t remember: a line of black, like vines creeping through the grass.

I leaned closer. One of the vines curled upward, almost touching my ankle. “Hey, Seth,” I said, my voice low. “When was this picture taken?”

“Uhm… I’m not sure, years ago.”

“You need to see this.” I walked over and held the frame up to his face. He took it, glanced down, then back at me.

“What’s the big deal? This looks fine.” I blinked, the vines were still there, plain as day.

“You don’t see those thorny vines?” His brow furrowed.

“What are you talking about? I don’t see anything, man. Maybe you’re just—y’know—still wound up from yesterday?”

“I’m telling you, they’re right there. You seriously can’t see those vines?” Seth hesitated for a moment.

“No. And you’re kinda freaking me out.” I opened my mouth, closed it, then stared at the frame again. The vines were still there. Crawling. Twisting. Almost reaching me. Why couldn’t he see them?

“I had a dream last night…” I said, the words fumbling out of my mouth faster than I had intended. “The well was there. The flower. Black vines—these vines—coming out of the ground, wrapping around me. Cutting into me.” Seth stayed silent, expression on his face still as I talked. “They had sharp thorns. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. They squeezed tighter as they moved higher up my body. And right before they covered my face-“ I looked up at him. “There was something in the trees… watching.” Seth shifted in the bed as he spoke.

“Okay… maybe you need to just-“

“And this morning,” I interrupted. “There was a black flower sitting on my window ledge.” I held his gaze as he looked at me confused. “It disappeared. Twice.” Seth exhaled slowly while rubbing the back of his neck.

“You really didn’t sleep much last night did you?” I didn’t respond, I just stared at the photo. The vines seemingly got longer with each glance I took.

“Maybe you shouldn’t go back there,” he added. That’s when I stood up.

“No. I have to.”

“What?”

“I need to see it again. The well. The clearing. All of it.”

“Dude—why?”

“Because I’m not crazy,” I snapped back. “Or if I am, I need to know for sure.”Seth stood up.

“Think about what you’re saying. If the well really is what you think it is, then there’s no point in going straight to it.” I opened my mouth to argue—but nothing came out. He wasn’t wrong. Not exactly.

“So what do I do?” I asked.

“Start small,” he said. “You wanna know what it is? Then figure out where it came from first.” I looked at the photo again, the vines still twisting toward my leg. I knew what I saw.

“Fine,” I muttered. “But I’m not letting this go.” I didn’t argue. Not out loud. But even as we sat back down and the game flickered on, my thoughts kept circling. The dream. The flower. The vines crawling into that photograph like they belonged there. Seth couldn’t see them—but I could. And I didn’t care if it meant I was losing it. I had to know why. I left an hour later, walking home under the dull gray sky, the wind pushing dead leaves into the street. The clearing was off-limits—for now—but maybe there was another way to get answers.

When I got home I opened my laptop, typed “old stone well Pinewood Forest,” and hit enter. And there it was—on the first page: “The Mouth of Dahlia—Urban Legends and Vanishing Boys.” I stared at the blue website name—scared to click on it. The page loaded slowly. It looked like a blog—basic white background, outdated fonts, barely readable. The article was dated 2009.

“Hidden deep in Pinewood Forest sits a moss-covered well known to some locals as ‘The Mouth of Dahlia.’” It talked about disappearances—three boys in the ‘40s, a hiking group in ‘78, another kid in the ‘90s. No bodies. No signs. Just a black flower found near where they vanished. I kept scrolling. “Some believe the well isn’t a structure but a living thing—a mouth that feeds on people. A boundary between our world and something older. Others claim the well to be a portal to hell or an otherworldly plane.” My stomach turned. A figure in the trees. Dreams. The flower. “The flower doesn’t grow naturally in this region. But it keeps appearing. Those who see it—never forget.”

I sat back in my chair, hands clammy. I wasn’t crazy or delusional, I was being hunted. It wasn’t just a nightmare anymore. I had seen that flower, and now I knew its name.

I couldn’t sleep that night. I kept seeing the flower every time I closed my eyes. By morning, I’d memorized the article. But it wasn’t enough. I needed something older. Something real. The local library opened at 10:00. I was waiting outside by 9:45.

I was at the library when the doors opened. No sleep. No appetite. Just a buzzing need to know. The reference section smelled like dust and forgotten things. The librarian barely looked up when I asked about Pinewood’s history—just pointed toward a shelf marked “Local Archives.” Most of the books looked untouched. Brown covers, warped spines, handwritten call numbers in faded ink. I scanned titles until one caught my eye:

“Structures of Significance: Settlements and Monuments of Pinewood County.” I pulled it down and flipped through yellowing pages until I found a section labeled: The Dahlia Well

“Constructed in 1885 by Harold Millen, a local stoneworker, the well was originally intended to supply water to the southern edge of what was then known as Millen Farm. It was named after his wife, Dahlia Wren Millen, whose favorite flower inspired both the name and the carved vine motifs still visible on the structure today.” I paused. Vines. “According to local accounts, Dahlia Millen died under unclear circumstances shortly after the well was completed.”

“After her death, strange reports began circulating—missing animals, inexplicable dreams, and sightings of a ‘woman in black’ near the forest’s edge. Though never confirmed, these incidents led some to believe Dahlia’s spirit had become bound to the well, either by grief, or by something darker.” There was no conclusion. No resolution. Just a final line: “While skeptics dismiss these tales as rural superstition, the well has remained a source of quiet fascination—and quiet fear—for over a century.”

I closed the book slowly, my fingers tight around the cover. The carving. The dreams. The flower. Maybe it was just a story. But maybe she was still there.

Part III

I walked out of the library in the hot hours of the afternoon. The clouds parting and sun shining reminding me of what life was like before the well. I should have felt comforted by the warmth. But I didn’t.

The air felt too bright, like the world had overcorrected. Everything was golden and gleaming—too clean, too alive. I blinked into the sunlight, and for a second I felt like I was looking at something I didn’t belong in anymore.

People walked past me without noticing, laughing, talking, chewing on the ends of iced coffee straws and complaining about the heat. I wondered if they’d ever seen the flower—if they’d remember that they had. Or maybe I was the only person to feel this way.

I didn’t go home. I walked—no direction in mind. I passed a broken streetlamp with a vine coiled around it. One of the leaves looked… different. Almost shaped like a mouth. I stopped walking. I took a photo. Zoomed in. It was just a leaf. But no—was it?

When I got home I laid everything out. Notes, print-outs, hand-drawn maps I had made. I circled the location of the well, my house, and the street lamp. I drew a line—and then another. The intersections didn’t mean anything yet, but something in my bones said they would. I stood back. looked at the angles. Measured distances with a ruler I hadn’t touched in forever.

The paper didn’t give answers, but it started to hum. Not literally. Not out loud. Just beneath the surface of the silence, like the house itself was listening. That’s when I remembered the archive box.

Last week, tucked in a back room of the library, there had been a stack of unlabeled cartons—donated by the First Presbyterian Church when they’d cleared out their basement. Most were full of hymns and yellowed bulletins. But one had older material. Parish logs, burial certificates, handwritten sermon notes. I’d flipped through it without care. It wasn’t catalogued. Not even alphabetized. I’d only opened it because the box was broken and sagging at the corners.

There’d been a letter inside, folded between two brittle sheets of cemetery records. I don’t remember reading the whole thing at the time—just the date, the name of the author, and the strange scrawl of handwriting like he’d written it with a broken nail. I only brought it home because it looked out of place. An instinct. Or maybe the well had already started nudging. Now it was on the table, waiting. I unfolded the page, and read the letter in full for the first time.

14 August, 1872 Rectory of St. Bellamy's Parish Crook’s Hollow, County Wexford To whomever should, by Providence or misfortune, come upon this missive— I write not as a man of sound standing, but as one—

by knowledge that ought never have been touched. I have seen a thing which the earth has no name for. The villagers speak of a woman. They say her spirit lingers in the old well—that her sorrow poisons the ground, that she hungers for company. I have heard the tales, and I tell you now: they are wrong. The well is not haunted. It is—

…I have stood upon its stones and felt a warmth rise that is not the lord’s doing. I have looked into its depths and dreamed things I do not believe were ever mine to dream. Prayers spoken near it echo strangely, as though some other mouth repeats them with a voice just slightly behind my own. It listens. I have seen vines grow in spirals that mimic the shapes I later found—

I am watched. I am used. I have tried all rites known to me. Salt, fire, the blessing of the ground, the breaking of stone. It returns. It always returns—

…I dare not speak of this to the bishop. Let them think me mad. Perhaps I am. But if you are reading this—if this letter still breathes in your hands—then it is not yet satisfied. It waits. Do not trace its paths. Do not name it. And above all— In dwindling faith, Fr. Elias Grange

I read the letter once. Then again. Then again. I tried not to assign meaning to the parts I couldn’t read, but that only made them louder. I filled in gaps with instinct, with memory, with my own thoughts. I didn’t write anything down, but I started repeating certain phrases in my head, over and over: It is not haunted. It listens. Do not name it.

At first I told myself it was historical context—just context, that’s all. But I knew better. I felt better. This wasn't a coincidence. This wasn’t superstition. The priest had seen the vines too. He’d felt that same wrong warmth. He’d drawn something, or dreamed something, or spoken words that didn’t sound like his own.

And now he’s gone. Just a cracked letter, buried in the wrong box, misfiled in the basement of a library where no one ever looked. I laid it out beside my maps. The ones I’d drawn. I looked at the spirals again. I didn’t remember drawing them either—not consciously—but there they were, repeating across three separate pages. The lines converged near the well, but more than that… they grew. Each time, the spirals were longer. Thicker. As if they were spreading.

I pulled the light closer and started sketching again. Carefully. No ruler, no measuring. Just my hand. It felt natural. Almost like copying. When I blinked, it was almost dark. I hadn’t eaten. My phone buzzed—four unread texts, missed call, low battery. I didn’t answer. I barely registered the names. Instead, I turned the priest’s letter over. Nothing written. But the paper was warped, stained in one corner like it had been held too tightly in a damp palm. I touched the spot. Cold.

That night, I dreamt of the well. But not like before—not a memory. Not something I could rationalize later as a reconstruction. The dream was inside the well. There was no light, no ground, no sky. Just slow movement, like being suspended in something thick, something not water. Something that labored up and down in a near perfect rhythm. Then, a voice—not loud, not sharp. A whisper, just near the edge of my ear, as though it were spoken from within me. “It’s waiting for you.”

The morning after the dream, I found a crack in the living room wall. It started near the ceiling and curved downward—not jagged, not haphazard. It curled. A wide, deliberate arc, looping once like something hand-drawn. Like something I’d drawn. I didn’t touch it. I didn’t even go near it. Just stared at the shape for a while, half expecting it to keep growing right in front of me. When I blinked and looked again, it was just a crack. Drywall split from heat or pressure or old age. But I could swear it hadn’t been there the day before. I could swear it was growing.

I got a pencil and sketched the shape in my notebook. That was the first entry. By the end of the week, I had filled four pages with notes. Strange sights, small sounds, shapes that reappeared in places they didn’t belong. There was a vine outside the bathroom window, coiled in the same spiral I’d drawn on one of the maps. Dust gathered in the corner of the kitchen that looked—if I stared too long—like the shape of a mouth. A floorboard near the hallway seemed to pulse, just slightly, like something was breathing under it. Sometimes I felt it at night when I walked barefoot to the kitchen. The house began creaking at odd hours, but never the usual kind—this wasn’t the random shift of old wood in heat. This was rhythmic. Intentional. Like footsteps or a slow drag of something heavy just beneath the floor.

I started writing down everything. Not because I thought it would help me understand, but because I was afraid that if I didn’t, I’d start forgetting what was real. Some nights I’d wake up not knowing if the dream had ended. Other times I’d be completely awake and hear things I couldn’t place. Low, scraping sounds like something was clawing at the pipes. The voice came back too. Always in dreams at first. A woman’s voice—soft, urgent, whispering close enough that I felt the warmth of breath on the back of my neck. She said things like “deeper,” or “closer,” or “you’ve already seen it.” She never shouted. She never begged. Just said those things again and again until I woke up soaked in sweat, heart pounding, unsure whether I’d screamed.

Eventually, I stopped trying to sleep. The cracks were in every room now. Most were small, just hairline fractures, but some had started curling into distinct shapes. Spirals, mostly. I measured a few of them and compared them to the ones I’d drawn in my earliest sketches. They matched exactly—same size, same curve, even the same direction. That shouldn’t have been possible. I hadn’t used a compass or ruler for any of them. They were just instinctive drawings. But something about them was being mirrored in the house itself.

I began keeping field notes. Every incident had a time stamp. I noted what I saw, what I heard, where in the house it happened, and what I might’ve done to trigger it. Sometimes I could hear the voice during the day too, not just in dreams. Whispered just low enough that I couldn’t catch every word. I wrote those down too. Sometimes just fragments: “It’s hungry,” “We remember,” “You’re close,” “He failed,” and once, just once, “Don’t leave.”

One night while going through the pages again, I remembered something from the archive box. Buried beneath the priest’s letter and the church logs, there had been a bundle of handwritten sermon drafts—most of them incomprehensible—but one of them had a different handwriting and included diagrams. Badly drawn circles, strange patterns, and Latin phrases scribbled in the margins. At the time I’d dismissed it as nonsense, but now I found myself digging through the pile to find it again. And when I did, I realized it wasn’t just a sermon. It was something else.

The handwriting matched the priest’s signature from the letter—Fr. Elias Grange. A final note from him, possibly unfinished. One page near the end had been marked with a faint ink circle and the words “Counter-Circle” underlined three times. There were references to a ritual—elements of protection, maybe. It wasn’t clear. The Latin was fragmented, and the diagrams seemed incomplete. But I pieced together enough to try it.

I waited until night. Cleared the living room, pushed the furniture to the edges, and chalked the rough shape of the circle onto the floor. I placed salt where the lines met, as best I could make sense of it. I read the incantation aloud, quietly at first, then louder. My voice cracked during the third repetition. By the end of it, my vision had gone blurry and my hands were shaking. I felt like I was on the verge of throwing up.

But then—nothing happened. The room stayed still. No whispers. No cracking walls. No strange movements in the shadows. I sat there for hours, waiting for something to shift. Nothing did. It was the first quiet I’d experienced in days. That night I slept straight through. No dreams. No voice. Just sleep.

The next morning I found blood in the bathroom sink. It was faint—almost diluted—but real. I checked myself over. No cuts. No dried blood in my mouth. The drain wasn’t rusted. It wasn’t some old residue. It was fresh. I turned the tap on and watched it swirl down.

When I stepped outside, I noticed something I hadn’t before. Every house on the street—every single one—had a vine growing near the base. Most people probably wouldn’t have noticed it. Just one thin strand curling around a pipe or sprouting from a crack in the driveway. But I looked closer. They all curved the same way. All spiraled in the same direction.

I opened my notebook and flipped back through the pages. My earliest maps had started warping. The ink was thicker now. The spirals are darker, fuller. The paper almost felt damp in some places, like the lines were still alive. Still growing. Even the ones I hadn’t touched were changing, reshaping themselves slightly when I looked away. The lines were converging on something. A center point I already knew. The priest’s letter said it always returns. He tried fire, salt, and prayer. All of it failed. His letter had survived. But he hadn’t.

That evening, while I sat at the kitchen table, I heard the voice again. This time I was fully awake. It didn’t come from a dream, and it wasn’t outside. It was in the room with me, just behind my ear. No warmth this time. No breath.

“Why would you do that?” Then silence.

But I could feel something beneath the house. Something scraping from underneath the floor boards. It wasn’t scraping the flooring though—the sound was coming from deeper in the earth. It sounded like grinding. Like two pieces of iron scraping against eachother

I packed a bag. The letter. My notes. A flashlight. A map. I took matches. A knife. A jar of salt. I don’t know what I thought I’d need. But I knew staying here was no longer an option. The lines were crawling toward me now, not outward. Inward. Always toward where I stood. The spirals in my drawings had started looping into themselves like they were folding reality.

The well had been whispering. Now it was listening. And whatever was at the bottom was finally awake. I was going back. I had to. Not to stop it. I don’t know if that’s even possible. But I had to see it. I had to know what it wanted. Because I think it’s always known what I am. And it’s been waiting.

Part IIII

I returned to the edge of the pine clearing just before dusk. The woods were quiet—too quiet. The usual buzzing of summer insects and rustling of small animals seemed to have stilled. I felt like I was being watched, and I suppose in a way I was, because Seth was already there, sitting on a fallen log with his arms crossed and an expression somewhere between worry and disappointment. He stood as I approached, and I could see that he’d been waiting a while. “You’re serious about this,” he said flatly, not even offering a greeting.

I nodded, not slowing my step. “I have to go back. Everything leads here. I’ve seen the symbols, the vines, the way the cracks form in the house—they all converge. It’s not random. It’s real. I think it always was.” Seth stared at me for a long time, like he was waiting for a punchline that never came.

“You hear yourself? You’re talking about cracks and vines like they mean something. Like they’re some kind of sign. You don’t think maybe you’re just... seeing what you want to see?”

“It’s not what I want to see,” I snapped, more sharply than I intended. “Do you think I want to believe any of this? That I want to be haunted, sleepless, surrounded by symbols that keep growing every time I look away? You didn’t read the priest’s letter. You didn’t hear the voice. You didn’t see the flowers on your pillow at night.” Seth rubbed his face with both hands and let out a breath.

“Jesus. I thought this would pass. I thought maybe if you just let it sit, it’d fade out like a bad dream. But you’re only getting worse. This is a suicide mission.”

“I’m not going to die,” I said. “Not if someone’s up here to help pull me out.” He looked away and shook his head, muttering something I couldn’t hear, then sighed.

“Fine. But if anything goes wrong, I’m pulling you up. No arguments. No excuses.”

“Agreed.” We walked to his house to grab some rope, not speaking much. There was tension in the air, the kind that didn’t come from fear but from resignation. I knew I couldn’t explain it well enough for him to understand. And he knew I wouldn’t be talked out of it. He fetched a long coil of sturdy rope from the garage, along with a flashlight and gloves. We each carried one end as we made our way back toward the clearing. The forest felt tighter this time, the trees leaning inward, the light dimming faster than it should have. We barely said a word the entire walk.

At the well, we paused. The stones looked the same, but I could feel something else—like the very air around us had thickened. The birds had gone silent. Even the insects had stopped. Seth tied one end of the rope to a heavy branch nearby, anchoring it securely, then looked at me. “This is your last chance to not be a complete idiot,” he said. “You sure about this?” I tightened the straps on my backpack and took a breath.

“Yeah. I need to know.” He tied the rope around my waist and gave it a few strong tugs, testing the tension.

“I’ll be right here. If you shout, I’ll pull. If the rope jerks, I’ll pull. If you’re quiet for too long, I’m pulling.”

“Understood.” I climbed onto the edge of the well and slowly began my descent. The rope held firm as I lowered myself hand-over-hand into the dark shaft. At first, it was just damp stone and the faint echo of my breathing. Seth’s voice drifted down after me.

“You good?”

“Yeah,” I called back. “About ten feet down.” The stones started to feel slick, and the smell hit me—moisture and rot, like wet meat left out in the sun. After another few feet, I saw small holes in the stone walls—perfectly round, about the size of golf balls. They were spaced irregularly, as if bored into the well after its construction.

“I see holes,” I called up. “They weren’t in the old construction. Maybe... something bored through.” “Don’t start speculating down there,” Seth called. “Just keep track of where you are.”

I nodded to myself and kept going. At around twenty feet, the stone gave way to something else—dark, reddish, and fibrous. It wasn’t just damp. It glistened. The texture shifted beneath my hands, pliable but firm, like hardened muscle. My flashlight beam caught threads of some kind of tissue running along the walls in spirals. The air got denser. Every breath was harder to take, like I was inhaling steam laced with copper and mildew.

“I think I hit the bottom,” I lied. “Going a little farther.”

“Be careful.” Another five feet down, I saw a ring embedded into the wall—a full circle, maybe three feet across, made entirely of the same fleshy material. It pulsed, slow and steady, like the beat of a buried heart. And then I heard it. A sound like breathing—not mine, not wind—something deeper, heavier. Inhale. Exhaled.

I felt a gust of hot air from below. I jerked the rope. “Pull me up!” There was no response at first. Then the rope shifted, tightening. As I ascended, I passed the holes again, and something shot out—vines. Slick, fast, they darted from the holes and lashed toward my legs. I kicked hard, trying to swing out of the way, but more shot up from below. I screamed to Seth. “Vines! They’re coming! Pull faster!”

I felt the rope jerk violently. Seth was pulling with everything he had. As I cleared the edge of the stone section, the vines thrashed and whipped, lashing at my boots and legs. I was nearly out when I saw Seth’s face at the top, strained with effort. “Come on! You’re almost—” he started, then screamed.

A vine had wrapped around his ankle. He kicked at it, shouting as he lost his grip on the rope. I tried to grab his arm as I neared the top, but another vine coiled around his thigh and yanked. He fought, cursing, eyes wide with panic. I pulled at him, but there were too many—vines snaking from the well, wrapping his arms, his chest, dragging him toward the mouth. “Don’t let go!” I yelled, clutching him with both hands.

His grip slipped. I tried to hold on. I tried. But he screamed my name as the vines yanked him into the dark, his voice echoing down the shaft before it was swallowed whole. And then there was nothing. Only my ragged breath and the faint creak of the rope swaying.

I ran. I stumbled through the trees until my legs gave out and I collapsed against a moss-covered rock. I sobbed there for what felt like hours. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t think. My friend—my only real friend—was gone, because of me. Because I believed in something I didn’t understand. Because I thought I could face it.

When I finally made it home, I climbed into my window and collapsed on my bed, still wearing the same dirt-streaked clothes, hands trembling. I didn’t sleep. I just stared at the ceiling, listening to the silence.

The police questioned me for days. I told them the truth, or at least a version of it. That we’d gone hiking, that Seth slipped. That I couldn’t reach him. They searched the woods, the well, everything. They found no signs of foul play. They found no signs of Seth.

The case was ruled accidental. A tragic fall. Maybe a cover-up. Maybe they didn’t want to know the truth. Maybe they couldn’t. His family stopped speaking to me. Friends from school distanced themselves. I became a pariah. The boy who got his best friend killed. I told myself I’d never go back. That it was over. But it wasn’t.

It’s been eight years. I’m twenty-five now. I’ve kept quiet. I’ve moved twice. I tried to live a normal life. But I never really escaped that clearing. That well. Not really. The guilt has followed me like a shadow I can’t outrun. I see Seth’s face in dreams. Sometimes I hear him screaming. Sometimes I see him staring from the bottom of the well, not screaming at all. Just watching

I’m going back. Not because I think I’ll survive it. Not because I believe I can stop it. I’m going back because I can’t live with what I did. Or what I didn’t do. Seth deserved better. And I think whatever’s down there knows that. Maybe it’s always known.
