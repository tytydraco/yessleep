So for some background, I've had sleep paralysis consistently for as long as I can remember, and it'd consistently have the same 'demons.' Tall, lanky black figures, like those people in Vantablack suits if you've ever seen them, and they'd always come in a group of 3 or 4. The events that followed are very consistent as well; my bedroom door would slowly creak open, disrupting the moonlight shining through my window and casting a shadow on my doorway. The figures would get into their respective positions, one to my right, bending down as if to get a better look at my face, in which I could smell its sour, alcohol-ridden breath. The second would crouch at the foot of my bed, tying my ankles to the bedposts. The third would go to the left side of my bed and start rummaging through my dresser, pulling out items I have been looking for but never found, and stuffing them into its abdomen effortlessly, like its entire body was made of an extremely dark jelly. On the off chance a 4 came as well, it'd come in on all fours, moving very erratically, until it jumped on my bed and put a rag over my mouth and nose, causing me to fall back to sleep.



That is the general rundown of every incident of sleep paralysis I've experienced for the better part of my life, until just a few nights ago. I had another episode on Sunday, and it went as usual: the three came in my room and took part in their routine. The demon on my left started rummaging through my dresser once again, pulling out my AirPods case, backup house keys, and my old digital camera I haven't seen in years. Oddly enough, it didn't shove the items into its abdomen; it acted as if something outside my room caught its attention, and before I knew it, all 3 demons were sprinting out of the room, slamming the door behind them. After lying in silence for about 10 minutes processing what happened, I finally returned to sleep. The next morning when I woke up, I saw all 3 items on my floor, the dresser still open. I chalked it up to sleepwalking and it being expressed through my reoccurring sleep paralysis. After looking through my old photos on the camera and putting my spare keys in a harder-to-lose spot, I proceeded with my daily routine.



That night was pretty uneventful, a few faint dreams but nothing more. The night after is where I really start getting disturbed. The same events happen, but instead of leaving through my doorway, the demon on my left retreats into my dark, open closet and closes the door; the one at the foot of my bed crawls to the underside of it; and the demon on my right leaves my room and closes the door like usual. Every time I attempted to sleep, I'd hear shuffling under my bed, movement in my closet, or drawers being opened outside my room. I couldn't tell you the time I actually fell asleep, but I do know the first god rays of the morning sun were peeking through the blinds. When I woke up, I initially checked under my bed and found nothing. I felt relieved for approximately 8 seconds, that is, until I remembered the one that scuttled away into my closet that I had consciously left open the night before. Of course now it was closed. I approached the door in fear of what I might find. My clothes I had hung up were rearranged and scattered across the different racks designated for specific apparel. I decided to put my clothes back on the racks properly before heading downstairs to further fuel my feelings of anxiety or unease, and in doing so I uncovered a single, small scratch mark on the back wall of the closet. At that point I didn't know what to think, as my nails are far too dull to engrave anything into drywall. I was denying the thought that simple hallucinations produced by fear could cause physical change to my room, and if they could damage my room, what's stopping them from damaging me?



I wish I had stayed in my room all day, because as soon as I laid eyes upon my kitchen, I was distraught. Cereal boxes torn open, dishes and smashed plates all over my floor, drying milk at the seams of my counters, and, speaking of counters, every drawer was pulled out of it. Silverware, pots, pans, other kitchen ingredients, and appliances piled on my floor. The best simile I could think of is asking a genie to empty a week's worth of trash and some poor old motherfucker's kitchen onto my floor. By the time I had fully cleaned my kitchen and put everything back together, the sun had set, and as I was about to go upstairs, I heard my front door handle rattle. Instead of trying to be a hero and investigating, I climbed up my stairs on all fours and sprinted to my room while screaming, "Oh, fuck no, this shit got me fucked all the way up!"



Once I got to my room, I slammed the door and locked it, jumping on my bed and covering myself with sheets and blankets, turning on my phone to type this out. I'm terrified, and the door sounds like it's opening. I think I forgot to lock it. I'm unsure of how to proceed. If these are the demons from my 'hallucinations,' then what can the cops do? Do I attempt to defend myself? Am I going insane? Or is this some extended nightmare? I need all the advice I can get, and as fast as possible. I hear my stairs creaking.
