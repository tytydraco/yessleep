I need to feel like I'm talking to someone. I've never been an overly online person. I only have facebook to talk to family. I deleted it not long ago because I didn't know how to answer all of the damn questions about where I was.

Alright. A week ago my life was falling apart and I was a day away from entering rock bottom's basement. My girlfriend, Angela, called me because she wanted to go on a hike with me. It broke my heart because that was our thing before everything went to shit.

Anyway, Angela came over as bright and bubbly as ever. She carried her own bodyweight in a backpack. When I opened the door I was met with a glowing smile of perfect white teeth. Her cute lips were painted red. Her long orange hair was pulled back in a ponytail that sat under her cap. She had a feline face splattered with freckles. She was the cutest woman I'd ever met. She was perfect. She was clingy, but we liked all of the same things so it fit naturally.

We had a bit of an age gap but it didn't bother us too much. My friends and family loved her, and her friends loved me. I hadn't met her family yet but it was a long drive.

We got into my truck and talked about nothing until we came to a trail we hadn't gone on yet. I was saving it for when I proposed but that would be moot by the next day.

We got out of the truck and began our hike up the mountain. She slipped her soft, warm hand into mine and like always I felt I could run for miles. We could hear the crunch of the rocks and fallen autumn leaves with every step. The evergreen trees parted in spots to display the flaming leaves and clearings where squirrels darted through the flora.

Toward the peak of the mountain my lungs carried a dull burn that amplified with each intake of chilly air. We could see the lake beyond the base of the mountain, and the highway far behind us. 

We stopped and dropped our bags. Angela pulled out the soup she'd made us and poured some for me, then for herself. I sipped it. It tasted earthy. The heat spread throughout my chest and placed a cushion against each side of my head.

"Are you worried about tomorrow?"

I licked my lips, "Yeah. You?"

"A little."

I put my hand on her shoulder and she looked up at me with soft eyes, "Are you sure you can wait?"

"It's only a few years. You'd do it for me."

"Yeah, well, you're out of my league."

She rolled her eyes and shook her head. I dropped my arm. We finished off our soup and sat for a moment in the silence.

"You don't have to put your life on hold for me."

"I do," She said, and I froze, staring at her with shame, "You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. You make me happy. You understand me. That's hard for a person like me to find."

Angela was perfect. It made me sad that others may not look past her quirks. Especially now that I'm gone.

"Anyone would be lucky to have you."

"Stop," She said softly but firmly, "I'm not staying with you because I can't get anyone else. I'm staying with you because I love you."

I leaned in and kissed her cheek. We stared into each other's eyes until a haze washed over me. I laid my cup in the tiny dirty dishes compartment of her bag before gently holding her shoulder and guiding her onto the ground. I held her in my arms. I kissed the top of her head.

It wasn't safe to nap on the trail but we'd done it now and then. Only this time I woke in a bed. I'd forgotten the day before, only remembering that I spent it with Angela. I reached out for her. My heart leapt and I sat up, looking around and finding myself in a place I couldn't recognize.

"The fuck?"

I jumped out of the strange bed. Facing the bed, against the far wall was a dresser with a mirror. To the right was a large window with the curtains wide open. Through it I could see miles and miles of wood and nothing else. My heart sunk when the picture of my childhood came into view but I did what I could to push it away. It was a generic house. 

I turned and left the bedroom. To the right I found a bathroom. Down the hall, past the L shaped staircase were two children's bedrooms. The room to the right was identical to what mine had been when I was a teenager. I stood in the doorway, my blood ice as my eyes roamed over every surface. 

When I finally pulled myself away from what couldn't have been my old room I walked down the stairs and found myself in a cheap dining room connected to a small kitchen. To the right was a living room with a sliding glass door leading to the back porch.

The pictures on the walls were blank. Notes were stuck to the refrigerator but they had been smudged. The home looked just as I remembered it otherwise.

I ran to the front porch and threw open the door. Trying to step through I felt needles penetrate my flesh, swirling inside me as if to gather my nerves together for a satisfying snap. I fell to the floor and writhed, screaming and swearing. My foot accidentally penetrated the threshold and again those fucking needles entered my skin. I could hear the pop of each layer of flesh breaking. I pulled back my leg. I threw off my shoe and removed my sock. I looked at the bottom of my foot. It appeared unharmed. I wanted to vomit and my head was spinning but otherwise I was fine.

I stood and walked for the back door. I slid it across and reached with one hand into the unknown. It took a second but fire seared down to the bone. I clutched my hand to my chest and fell to my knees, emptying my stomach onto the floor.

I sat there, quivering like a leaf on the floor, for an unknown amount of time. Eventually I sat on the couch. I pulled out my phone and saw fifty texts and twelve missed calls from Angela. I also got well wishes from family that obviously didn't know what had happened.

I dialed Angela and she picked up immediately, "Baby? Where are you?"

"I just got back from the police station!" She sounded out of breath, "What happened? I woke up and you were gone!"

"I... I don't know. I'm in this house but I can't get out. I don't know where I am or..."

"What do you mean you can't get out?"

"Please don't call me crazy."

She paused, "I'd never say that. I'm scared. Please tell me."

"I tried to go out both doors but something feels like it's stabbing or burning me. I don't know how."

"Okay. Turn on your location and I'll see if I can help."

"Alright," I said, and did what she requested, "Done."

There was silence on the other end until I heard a defeated, "Fuck."

"What?"

"It can't pinpoint you. The location keeps changing."

"Fuck."

"It's okay. Look out the windows and see if you can see a street name or anything that could narrow down where you are."

"Freshmen street."

"That was fast."

"It's the street I grew up on."

"Anything significant about it?"

I cringed, "There was a crazy old lady that lived next to me. People said she was a witch. Other than that it's in a shitty part of town. I don't know."

"That's it?"

"I don't know," I rubbed my face so hard it was more like I was just hitting myself, "Regardless of this damn town it doesn't make any sense why I can't use the fucking door."

"I'm gonna pack my things and see if I can find you. I love you."

"I love you."

We hung up. I tried dialing 911 but the line was dead. I could call family and friends but I couldn't call emergency. Just like it was when I was a child I found a laptop slid under the couch. Now here we are.

I'm waiting on Angela. It's been a long damn time but I'd moved across the country.

I can't imagine what had happened. Maybe I'm in a coma, maybe Angela thought she would be funny and put shrooms in my soup, I don't know. I'm just hoping to fuck she can get me out of here.
