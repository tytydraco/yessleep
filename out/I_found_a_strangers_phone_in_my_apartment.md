My name is Marcus. I'm 27. **I don't have people in my apartment.**



I work from home, which sounds lonelier than it is. Truth is, I like the quiet. My routine is simple: wake up, work, microwave something vaguely nutritious, work more, sleep. Sometimes I realize I've gone days without speaking out loud. My most meaningful human interaction is with the cashier at the grocery store—we have entire conversations that consist of "Crazy weather" and "Paper or plastic?"



I don't date. I don't host game nights. The last time someone crossed my threshold was two years ago, when the landlord came to fix the sink.



That's why the phone made no sense.



It was under my bed, half-buried in dust and a lone sock I'd been missing. The crack in the case ran diagonally across the corner, like a bolt of lightning frozen mid-strike. At first I thought it might be mine—some old device I'd forgotten about. But when I picked it up, the case was all wrong: soft pink silicone, slightly cracked at the corner. I don't own anything pink.



The screen lit up with a generic sunset wallpaper. Normal enough. Then the notifications appeared:



**Angie**: *Sarah, call me when you can!*  
**Mom**: *Did you land okay?*  
*3 Missed Calls – Jake*



Names that meant nothing to me. I swiped to unlock, but it demanded a passcode. 1-2-3-4? Nothing. 0-0-0-0? No luck.



Then I noticed the camera icon.



The most recent photo was taken three days ago. There I was—my face, my apartment—but smiling in a way that felt foreign. And pressed against my side, her head on my shoulder, was a woman.



Dark hair. A silver nose ring. The edge of a tattoo peeking from her sleeve.



I didn't know her.



Scrolling back revealed more: us at a restaurant I'd never visited, curled together on an unfamiliar couch, in my kitchen where she laughed while I brandished a spoon like a comedian. The dates stamped each photo: last week, two weeks ago, a month.



The laugh coming from my mouth in the recording sounded right, but my eyes were wrong - the crinkles at the corners weren't mine.



My palms went damp. I set the phone down carefully, as if it might bite. Maybe I'd hit my head. Maybe this was some bizarre prank—though I couldn't imagine who'd bother pranking me.



I grabbed my own phone, searched for texts from "Sarah." Nothing.



But my mom's messages... those gave me pause:



**Mom**: *Congrats, sweetheart! You sound happy for once.*  
**Mom**: *So when do I get to meet her?*  
**Mom**: *You've been quiet lately. Everything okay with Sarah?*



I rarely check messages, so I must have skimmed these and forgotten. Now, reading them properly, my skin prickled. Happy for once. Like she'd heard proof.



My gallery held worse evidence.



There she was—Sarah—in photos I didn't remember taking. Asleep in my bed, her hair fanned across my pillow. A video of her gasping at the twist in my favorite movie, her hand flying to her mouth. "No way," she whispered, while my own laugh echoed off-camera, warm and effortless.



The timestamps didn't lie: three weeks ago, two nights ago, yesterday.



I needed into her phone.



Scrolling back through my gallery, I found the earliest photo of us: a year ago, our hands clasped tight against a lake's backdrop. Just our intertwined fingers, her thumb brushing my knuckle with practiced familiarity. June 14th.



Her phone had the same photo, same date.



\*06-14.\*



The unlock chime sounded too cheerful.



Her wallpaper was another shot of us—this time full-face. She was mid-laugh, nose scrunched. I looked... relaxed. Like someone who didn't overthink every interaction.



New notifications popped up:



**Mom**: *Please call me, sweetheart. You can't keep ignoring this.*  
**Jake**: *Where are you?? You missed the appointment again.*



Most apps were locked behind biometrics, but the notes app yawned open. Hundreds of entries spanned years. A diary.



This felt like trespassing, but so did finding proof of a life I didn't remember. I searched for June 14th.



The note was titled "Moving Forward."



I hovered. This wasn't meant for me.



But I had to know.



That's why I'm posting this here. If any of this sounds familiar—if you remember her—please tell me.



What follows are Sarah's words. Not mine.



(And if you're reading this, Sarah... I'm sorry.)





**Moving Forward**  
\*06-14\*



Marcus invited me to the lake tonight. I'm bringing two things:

1. The awful peaty whiskey he pretends to hate
2. A decision

If he asks me to be his girlfriend today, I'm done. Done with Jake's voicemails about my "sleep study results." Done with Angie's lectures about how I've changed. Done staring at my own fingerprints like I could find the missing days in them.



My editor would kill me if she saw my light pollution article draft right now—every margin filled with lake sketches instead of fact-checks. But Marcus gets it. When I told him how drowning cities in artificial light steals the stars from millions of eyes, he didn't fake interest like most people. Just said: "Sounds lonely." Then made me that terrible cinnamon coffee in a stolen diner mug.



That's why today matters.



If he says the words, I'll throw my medication in the lake. I'll block Jake's number. I'll apologize to Angie by actually showing up to bad-movie night for once.





**2:18 AM**



The label curled as it sank: 'Lorazepam - Dr. Chen - DOSE AS PRESCRIBED' dissolving into blurry streaks. Marcus kissed me after. He tasted like whiskey and something darker, like the air before a thunderstorm.



I didn't mean to bite him.



(But when he gasped, for one bright moment, all the static in my head went quiet.)



Now he's asleep in the tent, breathing slow and deep. I keep counting the spaces between:  
one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three—



The moon had fractured into perfect thirds on the water's surface - a broken coin still glinting. I swear I hear whispering in the waves, but it's probably just Jake's last voicemail playing in my head: "Sarah, the sleep lab results show abnormal REM cycl—"



Deleted.



Marcus murmured a name in his sleep. Not Sarah - something that clattered to the floor of my mind, familiar and wrong. My shoulders tensed before I remembered I shouldn't recognize it.



I should wake him. I should run.



Instead, I'm lacing our fingers together, studying how our palms fit. His skin is so warm it almost burns.
