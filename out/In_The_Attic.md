The year was 2001 and I was staying the night at my friend Catherine's for the first time, we had met the summer before at the local skating ring and were inseparable ever since. A weekend over the summer, I was invited to stay and so I did. Pulling in the driveway, I noticed that Cat lived in this old two story house, surrounded by woods and dirt road. The house itself gave me an uneasy feeling when I first seen it; The shutters were falling off and the paint on the house seemed to be fading. It was an old piece of shit now that I think about it but I was excited. 

I sat there for a minute with my dad, contemplating on whether or not I wanted to get out. After what seemed like 10 minutes, I smiled at my dad and gave a thumbs up. My little legs felt like I was walking in sinking sand with each step because I was still trying to talk myself into knocking on the door. Surprisingly the inside was alot nicer than the outside, so I pushed that uneasy feeling down and just shrugged it off as nerves. I remember the smell of the house, I can't pinpoint it but it was different, kind of like a musty rotted smell. I started to walk around, just to explore my surroundings but noticed Cats mom watching me. I simply smiled and waved but she just stood there, starring at me wide-eyed. “Hi!” I exclaimed, “I’m April, you must be Cats mom.” She didn’t even budge or say anything back. I've never met her before, but why was she starring at me like that? Suddenly, cat flew around the corner and tackled me. We both fell and started to giggle, I noticed cats mom out of the corner of my eye, start to turn around and walk off. She was gone, just like that. 

A couple hours, Cat and I are laying on a bean bag in her room watching Children Of The Corn. Which, by the way, was one of my favorite movies at the time because I grew up watching horror movies because I love the feeling that a good horror movie gives you. Cat felt the same way and thats why we clicked so much. 
Back to the story. We were sitting here watching the movie and suddenly the open door opposite us slams closed. Cat screamed and we both jumped, giggled and brushed it off because we were kids. Until the second time, when it creaked open and slammed again, not even seconds after the first time. 
“Does that door do that all the time?” I asked Cat. She didn’t reply but just shrugged her shoulders. Now, I'm sitting there starring at this door, trying to figure out how in the hell is this door opening and closing by itself. In the midst of all that, the only other person in this house is her mom. Which I figured out earlier, was just a tad bit creepy. 

"You think it's just your mom?" I asked her. But she just shook her head. "You sure?" I asked again but she said something that gave me chills then and still gives me chills just telling this story. "My mom isn't home, its just me and you silly." I just stare at her while she's starring at me, trying to wrap my head around what she just said. Who leaves their 9 year old, home alone, with a friend, in a two story house? "Where is your mom?" I asked her. "She's at work." I giggled, thinking she was just trying to trick me. "She is at work! She only works for a couple hours so she leaves me here because she trusts me!" At this point, I'm just looking at her and she noticed this look of worry on my face. "What's wrong?" She asked. "If your mom is at work, then who was that lady staring at me earlier?" As I said this, we heard what seemed like footsteps at the time. But thinking about it now, it sounded like shuffling in one spot, above us. 

I'm completely scared at this point, every hair on my neck is standing out and I just want to leave. I start to get up when Cat pulled me back down, “Did you hear that?” I nodded. It was silent again, until the footsteps were back but louder and faster. We both stared up at the ceiling and she grabbed my hand. "This happens every day." She whispered. I look over at her and can truly see the fear on her face. The footsteps stopped and she looked at me, her face flushed white. "Is there an attic?" I asked, she pointed up towards the ceiling. “Well, maybe it's just a squirrel?”, I asked, hoping that’s what it was. You ever notice when you're really quiet? That's when you can hear almost everything around you. Imagine if you're sitting in a house, with your best friend, alone at 10 years old and you hear the giggle of a 3 year old child. Mind you, she has no younger brothers or sisters. We are completely alone. 

Cat was just as scared as I was, I remember thinking that I just wanted to get out of this house. Just grab her and run out the door, at least we would feel safer and less scared outside the house than we would in. "Wanna hear a story?" Cat asked, pulling my mind back in reality and I nodded reluctantly. “Well, this house use to be a daycare. There was this lady that would watch the kids and one day she just locked them in the attic and then hung herself from a rope in the kitchen. They all died because the kids were hungry and thirsty and no one found them for months afterwards.” Her face was expressionless, “In this house." She finished. My heart started to pound, my eyes wide with fear and I just looked at her. "Its true." She said, "I've seen them. The little kids. Everyday. But I've never seen the lady, but I guess you have. Earlier."

My body froze and I stood there contemplating on how I wanted to leave this house, safely. It’s 2001 and I don’t have a phone at this point, the only way of contact is the house phone in her house but I was reluctantly trying to not stay for longer than I have too. With all my strength, I smile at Cat and say “Thank you for inviting me but I need to go.” A look of sadness was plastered on her face. “Please don’t leave.” She begged but I couldn’t stay in the house much longer. “May I use your house phone?” I asked of her, she nodded and pointed towards the kitchen. I sighed nervously because I know that’s where SHE was. 

I stare at the door to the kitchen, trying to move my feet but I felt like I was glued to the floor. “Are you going to use the phone?” Cat asked. I said nothing and concentrated on the movements I needed to make to reach this phone. Finally, my feet began to move and I walked slowly towards this phone that sat on the counter begging me to call my dad to come get me. 
As I was walking towards it, I hear loud groan towards the kitchen. Assuming what I knew it was, I run towards the phone and grab it only to be met with a dead tone. In that moment, I was more scared than I have ever been then I hear a honk outside. 

“My mom is home!” Cat said excitedly. A sigh of relief left my lips as I ran towards the door, swinging it open and running outside to be met by her mom smiling. “You must be April, it’s nice to meet you.” I was visibly shaking and she knew something wasn’t right. “What’s wrong sweetie!” She asked. “She met my friends and the hanging woman.” The hanging woman? I thought to myself. “Uh, honey. Don’t scare her.” Her mom said to Cat while patting me on the head. “Can you call me dad? Your phone doesn’t work inside.” I begged of her, I just wanted to leave. Cats mom nodded and went back towards her car and phoned my dad. “I’m sorry if I scared you.” Cat said, giving me a side hug. I smiled and nodded. Something felt off in that moment, the air around me felt cold. I felt a strange sensation on my shoulder and thought it was Cat wrapping her arms around me but the little voice in my head told me to look over me. 

There stood the same woman from the kitchen, her eyes were piercing black with emptiness and she was smiling. Not a normal smile either, her teeth were rotted and her mouth was open. Her hands were cold and her nails were long and split down the middle, on her throat was a red ring from what I assume was from the rope. I was frozen inside and didn’t know what to do. Cat and her mom didn’t react so I figured I was the only one seeing this. Suddenly, I fell and everything went black. I don’t know how long I was like this for, I heard a familiar safe voice leading me back to reality. “April!” Is that…my dad? My eyes open and my dad’s face was inches from mine with a look of worry. “Dad!” 

Fast forward years later. That day was the last day I had seen or heard from Cat. I'm now 33 and I can't seem to find any proof that she exsits. All my friends that I was friends with then, I'm still friends with now even after all these years. But why not her? I've drove by that house maybe 15 times and still wonder if maybe, she was just one of the ones that never made it out.
