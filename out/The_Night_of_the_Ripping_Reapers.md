Cold wisps my hair as I ponder lucid thoughts.

A simple thought, I wander but try not to stray. To be or to not to be, my knowledge of Kant

seems to elude me. For even the swiftest of hearts are reminded of my undoing's.

"Hey, you, you, yes, you!" I turned my head, swiped at behind me... Chop.

My head. Oh not again.

The migraines are kicking in and I can't see. It's like a blur and also not.

\* Sensors Recalibrated \*

It's a kick in the nuts every time it happens.

My eyes drift between like a mad cyclist. \*click\*

I see what it means now, "Hey, you! Woah. How the fuck did you do that?" said the thief.

I broke his neck before he could get out another word to his co-conspirator. Cooperation

of thievery is usually required even for the most skilled huntsmen. Solo artists are few of

a breed in the modern, apocalyptic age.

Weird I thought, this guy's thermal isn't popping up. How did he do that, I thought to

myself quietly... He must've shifted somewhere, hm, a fluke.

Granted, the king is happy and I've completed my task. The only time to reap rewards

is when they're granted by our bearers. Grim truths and death follows where he walks, but

in good ends were good meetings held for greater intentions.

Even death himself is weary during these times, wise bastard.

Oh, the call of the Void. Cold and dark--it is. But a true sense of clarity that I can always return to.

Shit. They found me. What are we going to do knowing this...

Well, fear kicking in is telling me to run or hide. I thought standing my ground is whatever

I was told to do, so let's try that instead.

"Pst! I know you didn't leave, you're tricking out my system but there's one place you cannot hide from!"

ME! Woah. How did he do that? Creepy.

Is this some sort of joke the higher ups are playing on me? I can't tell since it is Holiday season soon.

"Alright jokes over kid, come on out. We know that your doing something, we don't know what, but show's over."

Silence...

"Come on! I'm standing right here! You want a piece of me!", I shouted angrily.

Silence...

"Alright... You got me! Hahahah! Funny man over here! Ha... Ha.. Okay. Where are you?!" as I started looking through the tree-line, the darkness started to envelop.

What the fuck? I thought to myself. I'm immortal! I can't die! No! NOOOO!

Click. Experiment one complete. Patient zero has been recorded.

"Doctor, what do you think?" I said as I pull off the interface.

Dr. Unknown #1: Well it's a mixed bag we're dealing with here, er, we can't say really. We go off symptoms this is medicine, you know this.

Dr. Unknown #2: Jesus Christ already! Come on! We know it's just politics for politics sake, there's the answer sitting right in front of us. Anonymity is priceless.

Dr. Unknown #3: Shut up! You say too much you'll get us all killed. This is the Game.

Dr. Unknown #4: N/a

Dr. Unknown #5: Male. How about this, we can just all relax, smoke a lil doobie and call it day. I'm tired man.

Dr. Unknown #6: Female. Shit. You want to talk about tired dude! Come the fuckin shit on ! Bout to puke over here!

Dr. Unknown #7: Let's all calm down, this is great, we're all doing great. Maintain your posture, we are

all people at the end of the day. IF we can't talk about this over a cup of coffee, glass of wine, whatever, then what else can we really do?!

Dr. Unknown #8-#13: N/a

Patient, verified.

"Jesus Christ, you aren't really saying...", #1 turns to #2.

"Yes, yes I am."

"Alright, well this is going to be your fall if this thing doesn't work."

"I know", he said.

"Load him back in." I said peacefully.

"Ready? 3... 2... 1... Now!"

This is intense. Never had the memory get slated and then reloaded like that before. Intense! Phew, jesus Doc!

"Told ya kiddo, we're the best around - you know this."

Ripping a ripper doc doesn't come easy, know the price and never forget it.
