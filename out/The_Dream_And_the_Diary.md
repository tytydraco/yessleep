My thoughts are disoriented. I don’t like to look at my face in the mirror anymore. I hate myself. I wish I were dead. Yes, dead. But I am not suicidal. If I were, I would've been dead already. But I am not suicidal. Not yet. I can’t die without telling my part of the story. I don’t think anyone will read this.

I am not a writer; I am just a disoriented kid. I can write anything here; it wouldn’t matter. Charlie likes dick. Charlie jumps with his eyes closed and his mouth open. See, it doesn’t matter. I don’t matter. And I used to think my story mattered, but it doesn’t. Because no one believes me. At this point, even I don’t know if I believe myself or not. I think I am blabbering again. I should stop. So what if no one is going to read this? I will still write it with full focus. At least I'll try my best.

Before I start, let me set some ground rules first. From now on, I will refer to you as ‘friend.’. I am not sure if you’d want to be my friend if you knew me, but I can call you anything because no one will ever read this. God, I am blabbering again.

You know what, let's restart. I’ll refer to you as a friend, and you can refer to me as “the narrator.”. Even though I am also a character in the story I am going to tell you, but still. Alright, I admit, I like the name narrator. I'm a novel freak (if you haven’t noticed already), and it just seems really cool to be called “the narrator”. You know what, I think I’m being stupid; I'll just tell you my name. I’m Mark. Not Mark Zukerberg. I wish I were, though. I would have a shitload of money. But I’m not. Anyways, back to our main point, ‘the story.’. Before your hand comes out of the computer and starts to choke me for talking too much, I’ll begin.

Beware, this is a real story.

Or at least I think it is. I’m not sure about anything anymore.

It started with a dream. It was more of a nightmare, actually. And every night was worse than the last. It would usually start something like this. I am at a beach, sitting on a chair. It's that peaceful time just before the sunset when the world feels magical. I see a girl running on the beach, laughing. I am sitting so far away from her that I couldn't see her face. There is a man running behind her, maybe her boyfriend. They look happy. And I feel peace just by looking at them. But soon, he starts to run faster. Her facial expression changes. Now she's scared and almost running for her life. When I try to get up to help her, my hands and legs are tied. I try to scream, but my lips are stitched together. I try to close my eyes, but I can't. I feel like I’m paralyzed. He’s faster than her. He catches her. And then I wake up. The dream was the same every night. I would always wake up before I could see what he did to her. I dreaded going to bed every night. Then one night, everything in the dream was the same, but this time I was the guy running behind the girl. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I didn't have any control over my body. Over his body. I was just a silent observer. It's the part of the dream when she goes from laughing to screaming. I feel like a monster. I am still chasing her. Before I could see her face, my eyes opened. I had pissed myself that night (I'm not very proud of that).

It had come to a point where I was sure that this dream meant something. I didn't know this girl or this guy. I had never gone to this beach (or any beach for that matter). The more I saw this dream, the more obsessed I got with it. Was this dream just a figment of my imagination or something more?

I did everything to find out about that beach, but I couldn't. I still dreamt about it but couldn't find it. I eventually gave up. And I think my dream gave up too. I stopped dreaming. I wouldn't dream anything at all. My life went back to normal.

But about after one month, when I was cleaning my room (which I rarely do), I found a loose floorboard. When I pulled it aside, there was a small box hidden there.

When I opened the box, I found a diary in it.

I was confused. When I opened the diary, I found something scribbled in it. It was my handwriting.

“The girl is dead.”

“Don't run.”

“call police”

And there were some images too. But it looked like a child drew them.

There was also a number written in the back. And below the number, it was written 

“Don't call this number.”

I am a human being, and human nature always prevails. Maybe it was me who wrote all this even if I don't remember it (I have a lot of gaps in my memory).

If it was me who wrote the warning, then maybe I had already called this number. I quickly took out my phone and searched this number in my call history. And there it was. 19 days ago. I called this number twice, at midnight.

I had a lot of questions, and all of them were unanswered. And the only solution I saw that time was to call this number. So I did. And she picked it up.

“It's been a while, Mark.”
