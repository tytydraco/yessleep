Antônio was a 74-year-old man who used a wheelchair and lived with his daughter Laura and her two children in a farmhouse. Until one of the grandchildren, only three years old, died suddenly. Antônio, already in an advanced stage of Alzheimer’s, did not fully understand what had happened.

Laura, on the other hand, fell into depression due to the loss of her child and her father’s critical condition. Her other child was her safe haven, the only thing that kept her will to live alive.
Because she was psychologically shaken, she decided to return to the city, where she would be closer to a mental health clinic and have more human contact—something she lacked while living on the farm.

At first, she planned to take her father Antônio with her, but he screamed nonstop every time he left the house, and this affected her deeply. Not only because of his condition, but also because, before the disease worsened, he had asked not to be taken away from the house, as he did not want to be far from his wife (she had died in that house and was buried very close to it).
With no other option, she contacted the company where I work, asking for an in-home caregiver for the elderly. By sheer bad luck, I was the one chosen. She called me with a trembling voice and offered me a lot of money to take care of her father.

I was still reluctant to accept because of the distance and the lack of signal at the house, but she told me the whole story, which moved me. Besides, it was my job, so I accepted.
I arrived early in the morning at the farm and found Laura waiting for me at the gate with her son. She was very kind, showed me around the farm, and when we reached the house, there was a banquet waiting for me. Before eating, she wanted to show me where my room would be. It was very clean and smelled nice, but I felt uncomfortable because of some creepy paintings on the walls—one of them being a portrait of an old woman with white eyes.

When we left the room, she introduced me to Antônio. He was very pale and thin, with a deeply sad look, and could barely speak. She gave me his medications and explained the times he needed to take them.

After so many instructions, we went to eat. After breakfast, she said goodbye to Antônio and told us she would return as soon as she recovered a bit of her mental health. She promised to call every day to check on him.

With tears in her eyes, she and her son left by bus for the city that afternoon, leaving only Antônio and me in the house.
It was still daytime, and I already felt a very heavy energy, accompanied by chills and almost a panic attack. I gave Antônio his medication and waited for him to fall asleep. When he did, I went outside the house and started taking deep breaths to calm myself down. My mind went into a state of alert, and I didn’t know why.

I began walking in front of the house, trying to distract myself by looking at the trees. When I turned back toward the house, I saw Antônio watching me from the second-floor window. Terrified, I went inside to check. When I opened his bedroom door, he was still asleep, which filled me with an overwhelming fear.

I ended up calling the company, asking for help to take care of Antônio, but they claimed that all the other employees were already assigned and ordered me to fulfill my duty.

As soon as the call ended, I tried to focus on my anger to “forget” the fear. To pass the time, I sat in the living room and turned on the television until nightfall. When night came, I started preparing dinner. When I took the food to Antônio, I saw him sitting in his wheelchair, staring fixedly at the window. One detail: there was no lighting outside the house at night, so he was staring straight into the darkness.
After watching him for a few seconds, I entered the room, placed the blended food on the table, and pulled his wheelchair toward it. Since his Alzheimer’s was already at an advanced stage, I had to feed him myself, scooping the liquid with a spoon. It was tedious and time-consuming, and I still hadn’t eaten.

When I finished feeding him, I went downstairs to the kitchen to eat. While I was having dinner, I felt a cold wind accompanied by whispers moving around me. Even so, since I was very hungry, it didn’t ruin my appetite, although the fear remained.

After finishing dinner, I went to sleep, hoping the day would pass quickly.
I fell asleep fast, but woke up in the middle of the night with Antônio screaming in several different languages. When I went to his room to calm him down, I saw that he was sleeping. I didn’t understand anything. As I returned to my room, I saw a grayish creature watching me from the staircase. Terrified, I ran to my room and locked the door.
I ended up sleeping under the covers in fear, and this time I woke up the next morning. However, I saw that the door was unlocked and slightly open, which intrigued me because only I had the key to the room. I went to check on Antônio and didn’t find him in his room or anywhere in the house.

I went down to the first floor and couldn’t find him. I opened the door and went outside to look for him. The day was overcast, and the wind was blowing hard. 

I walked around the house, but there was no sign of him, until I began to hear loud banging sounds coming from the barn, which was locked. I couldn’t get inside because I didn’t have the key to the padlock.
I knocked on the door and shouted, asking if there was anyone inside.

Immediately, the noises stopped, giving way to absolute silence. The problem was that Laura had never told me where the barn key was; in fact, it was an area she avoided showing me.

I went back to looking for Antônio and headed to the front of the house. When I looked up at his bedroom window, I saw Antônio watching me. At that moment, I realized I wasn’t being paranoid and that something was truly wrong.
I returned to the house to check on him. When I reached the bedroom, I took him to the living room, where I could watch him more closely. He looked at me more than he looked at the television.

I tried to communicate with him, but he didn’t respond, which was strange, because during the night he had been able to scream and speak several different languages. Somehow, he had the strength to speak.
When he began to fall asleep, I took him back to the bedroom and laid him on the bed. Taking advantage of the fact that he was asleep, I went to take a shower.

In the middle of the shower, I started to feel watched, and the doorknob began to move on its own. I finished showering, got dressed, and tried to leave, but I couldn’t open the door, it had locked itself. My phone was in the kitchen, and I panicked because I had no way to ask for help. I began to press my shoulder against the door and, fortunately, managed to force it open.

I felt an overwhelming sense of relief, as if I had been reborn. However, as soon as I stepped out of the bathroom, I saw Antônio in his wheelchair, watching me, standing near the door. At that moment, I could only wonder how he had managed to go down the stairs by himself and how he had brought the wheelchair along with him.

I had already given up trying to communicate with him, but I realized something was very wrong and asked how he had come downstairs. He didn’t respond. He just kept staring at me, with a cold, empty expression.

I decided to call Laura and told her everything that had happened. I asked her if he knew how to go down the stairs, and she replied:

— No, absolutely not. I was always the one who helped him go up and down.

Right after that, she asked if he could have had some kind of miraculous improvement. I told her that he was still the same, but that he had these inexplicable moments, and that they always happened when I wasn’t around. She seemed confused and said she would try to come back as soon as possible.

In the middle of the call, I heard someone calling from the gate. I said goodbye to Laura, hung up the phone, and went to see who it was.
It was a tall young man named Thor, who said he had been Laura’s neighbor for several years. He asked if she had sold the house to me. I explained that I was only there taking care of Antônio while she handled some pending matters.

He seemed somewhat suspicious, as if he didn’t trust me. I noticed it right away, so I showed my identification and handed him my card, saying that if he knew of any elderly person in need of help, he could call me. After that, he began to trust me more.
We talked for a bit, and I asked if he had noticed anything strange about the house. He told me that he saw Antônio going to the barn every night at dawn. Hearing that, I immediately remembered the noises I had heard coming from inside it.

As soon as we finished talking, I called Laura and asked her about the barn.

She told me she hadn’t been in there for years, because only Antônio knew where the key was, and since he had lost his ability to speak, it had become impossible to find out where he kept it.

I asked her if I could try to open the door, and she allowed it.

I kicked the door several times trying to break it open, but without success. I ended up going back into the house to look for the key. Antônio was sleeping, so I searched his room calmly, but still found nothing.

I checked his pockets, but there was no key. I left the house and went to Thor’s place to try to understand more precisely the path Antônio usually took before opening the barn. Thor told me that before going to the barn, Antônio always walked toward his wife’s grave.

After hearing that, Thor asked if I intended to try to enter the barn and offered to help. I agreed, and we headed toward the grave before it got completely dark.

When we arrived at the grave, which was close to the house, Thor began digging. At that moment, I thought we might be going too far, but I wanted to uncover what was really happening.

Thor suspected that the key might be inside the coffin along with the body and decided to open it. I was completely against going that far, but I let it happen.

And the worst happened: when he opened the coffin, there was only the key inside. No body. Just the key. We were completely shocked by what we saw.
As the shock began to fade, Thor took the key and went to open the barn. Night was already falling. When we opened the door, we were confronted with something inhuman: animal remains were scattered everywhere.

As we moved further inside, we saw something watching us. It was very dark; all we could see was a shadow with glowing green eyes.

At first, we thought it was some animal still alive, but as we got closer, we realized it was a person.

 When I turned on my phone’s flashlight, I saw that it was Antônio’s wife.
However, she was completely feral. When we tried to approach her to help, we noticed that from the waist down, her body was half horse, and her hands looked like pig’s hands. She seemed like the result of some kind of scientific experiment. She also had tusks and appeared extremely aggressive.

Faced with that scene, Thor began to feel sick. I didn’t know whether to approach and help or stay away.
I recorded everything with the flash on and stepped back to call the police, but there was no signal. We left the barn and ran to Thor’s house to get reception.
When we reached the gate, Antônio’s wheelchair was thrown out of the window, crashing onto the ground. We immediately returned to Antônio’s house to see how he was.

Suddenly, the power went out. Everything went completely dark; the only light came from my phone’s flashlight. As we approached the stairs, we heard the sound of a gun being loaded. Thor shouted, “Get down!”
As soon as we crouched, a shot was fired in our direction, but fortunately it missed. After the shot, we ran out of the house without seeing anything, jumped over the gate, and went straight to Thor’s house.
The first thing he did was call the police. The first thing I did was send the video of Antônio’s mutated wife to Laura.

Laura was in disbelief and panicked, asking about her father and how her mother had become like that. Before I could answer, someone began trying to break down the door.

I turned off my phone, and together with Thor, we pushed the couch against the door. We stayed like that for hours while the killer tried to get in, until we heard the police sirens followed by gunfire.

When the police called us out, we left the house. When we saw the killer’s body, we realized it was none other than Antônio himself. As I looked at his body, I began to question everything: whether he was really sick, whether Laura could be trusted, or whether she had deliberately put me in that situation.

After giving my statement, Thor took me to the city, and I managed to return home. I called my company and resigned without explaining the reason.
Laura later called me asking about her father. I told her he had tried to kill me and was shot by the police. She became furious and screamed at me as if it were my fault, saying I would pay for everything.
Days passed, and I remained curious about the barn, since Thor and I had left it open. As far as we know, the police searched the entire area and found nothing.

To this day, I still wonder if the creature managed to escape.
