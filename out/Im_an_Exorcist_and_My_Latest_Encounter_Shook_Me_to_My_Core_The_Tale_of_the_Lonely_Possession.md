In the dirty and dimly lit, night streets of 1976 Chicago, where the air was filled with cigarette smoke and the distant sounds of sirens, I made my way to the address written on a piece of paper. The city was filled with whispers of the supernatural, and as an exorcist, it was my duty to confront the darkness lurking in the shadows.

I knocked on the door of a brownstone home, feeling a tense shiver run down my spine as I awaited a response. The door creaked open. I stepped into the house and was met with a horrific scene. The air was thick with the stench of death, and blood stained the walls like macabre paintings. In the center of it all stood a figure of a man, their body contorted in strange and unnatural angles with eyes as black as coal. I knew that the person that stood before me was possessed by something I had never seen the likes of before.

Next to this figure had laid two policemen from an earlier time in the night who had attempted to intervene. They were no match for the force that inhabited this place. The possessed had slaughtered them with no mercy, leaving behind a trail of only horror in their wake.

As I approached the man, I could feel his malevolent presence watching me, studying me with a curiosity that sent a chill down my spine. 

"Who are you?"

I demanded, my voice steady despite the fear crawling at my insides.

The possessed figure smirked; a cruel twist of its lips sent a shiver down my spine. 

"I am no demon or angel, neither Satan nor God like you may believe." They replied, their voice echoing with an otherworldly resonance. 

"I am something beyond your comprehension, something older than time itself. I am a remnant of a forgotten age."

I raised my crucifix, invoking the power of the divine as I began to recite an ancient ritual of exorcism. But with each incantation I spoke, the possessed only laughed, mocking my attempts to banish them away.

"Why do you resist?" I demanded, desperation creeping into my voice.

“I do not resist. Do you believe that your words hold power over me?" it taunted in a chilling voice into the darkness.

In my many years serving the ministry as a certified exorcist for the Catholic Church, I have never encountered such a powerful being. Something that could resist the power of me and my God.

“What is your name?” The possessed demanded with a powerful voice.

“I will not tell you my name.” I replied with a shake in my voice.

“Okay then, John.” He replied with supreme confidence.

How did he know my name? And why did he ask me in the first manner if he already knew the answer?

“I know every person’s name, John, and I asked you your name, simply to be polite.” He replied.

This man, or supreme being not only knew my name, but could also peak into my thoughts, violating my very own mind. I tried to maintain my composure as I spoke.

"What purpose do you seek in this world?"

The possessed man paused, their eyes meeting with mine in a quiet exchange.

“I wish only to converse with someone. I wish to do so with you, and you alone.” The being stated in a calm manner.

Knowing that I had no other choice but to oblige with this powerful being, I sat down in front of it on the floor while saying,

“Okay, I'll submit. I know that I cannot best you with my own power, but I will try so with my words of conversation. Although, you already knew this was the case due to your ability to understand my thoughts, right?”

“You are a keen one, John. Yes, that is exceptionally correct.” It said, almost with a chuckle, as if we were lifelong companions who were meeting after decades of no contact.

"I am lonely, John.” they confessed, their voice tinged with a sorrow that echoed through the home. 

“Lonely?” I questioned. The room now filled with a feeling of despair that I have never experienced before.

It replied, “Yes, I am lonely, and have been so for my entire existence.”

Not understanding his purpose for this comment, I asked, “May I ask your name, then?”

“Name, you ask? I do not have a name, I think. However, thank you for asking me this. You are the first to do so.” He replied, with more of a chuckle which hid his true feelings.

I continued the conversation, “No name? Well then, what is your purpose here, and why do you claim to be alone?

He replied,
"I have come here tonight in a desperate act for purpose. I am not sure what my reason for being is. For eons, I have wandered the void, an eternal observer amidst the chaos of existence. I have witnessed the birth of countless galaxies, their fiery birth illuminating the darkness with fleeting moments of brilliance before succumbing to the inevitable pull of entropy. And yet, amidst the vast expanse of creation, I have remained alone, a wanderer adrift in the emptiness of my eternity.

I have watched as civilizations rise and fall, their ambitions and dreams ultimately consumed by the hunger of their own greed and desires. Worlds that are born from the ashes of remnant and forgotten stars, teeming with life and promise, only to be swallowed by the abyss of their own hubris. And in their demise, I have felt the weight of my solitude grow ever heavier, a silent witness to the folly of mortal ambition.

I have seen the beauty of individual lives, each one a story waiting to be told. I have watched as souls ignite with passion and purpose, their dreams reaching towards the heavens with a passion that defies the confines of mortality. And yet, even in their moments of triumph, I have seen their tragedy looming on the horizon, waiting to extinguish the flame of their own humanity.

For all my power, I am bound by the immutable laws of the universe, unable to intervene in the affairs of mortals. I am condemned to bear witness to their triumphs and their tragedies, to watch as they stumble blindly through the darkness in search of meaning amidst the chaos. And though my heart aches with the longing for connection, I am resigned to the solitude of my existence, a silent sentinel amidst the flow of time.

John, I have come here tonight to speak with you. To prove to myself that my existence has meaning, to abolish my sorrow of loneliness. You wish to understand why I am truly here? I do not fully have the answer to that, and I am not sure what will happen to me after this.”

I wasn’t sure what to say. My resolve was crumbed in the face of such profound words of concern and loneliness. I was completely and utterly stunned by the words that had been uttered from its mouth. Could it be that even a being as ancient and powerful as this could feel the ache of isolation?

“I understand your sorrow and frustration. I too do not feel the presence of the meaning of my own existence. I wish to know the answer to that question as well. However, what I do know is that I am never alone. I know that there are others who care for me, who mourn for me when I am sad, who cheer for me when I am happy. I know that there are good people who do good things in this world. If you ask me, you are not alone, at least not anymore. Find understanding and comfort in that I will now cherish your words and pray for your existence and purpose. I truly hope that you will find the answer to this difficult question.”

As the night began to end, I extended a hand of compassion, offering solace to the lost being before me.

"Return from which you came," I stated, my voice soft yet resolute. 

"Find peace in the embrace of the cosmos, and may you journey forth with the knowledge that you are not alone."

And to my astonishment, the possessed being before me smiled, and ascended. Their once present form of existence dissipated into wisps of ethereal energy as they departed this plane of existence. In their wake, a sense of tranquility settled over the home, the echoes of our conversation lingering like whispers in the night.

As this happened, the two once lifeless corpses of the cops were suddenly filled with life once more. I could not explain how this was so, but I was glad.

As I emerged from the house unscathed, I knew that I had witnessed something beyond the realm of my mortal comprehension. And though the mysteries of the universe remained as enigmatic as ever, I found solace in the knowledge that even the darkest souls could find redemption in the embrace of understanding and compassion.

In the end, it was not my strength or my faith that saved this being, but something far more unexpected. As the possessed man lay vanquished back inside the house, I did not see a monster, but a lost soul yearning for purpose in this cruel world of existence.
