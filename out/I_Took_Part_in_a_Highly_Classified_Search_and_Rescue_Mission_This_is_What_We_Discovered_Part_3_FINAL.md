The duty of any good soldier is to bravely and loyally serve their country. That means doing things that keep you awake at night so that others can sleep. It means ignoring almost every survival instinct you have and entering the lion’s den so others don’t have to. None of us wanted to enter that fissure, not after all we’d seen and experienced. But we were soldiers, we had a mission to find the outpost staff and bring them home. So as much as I and every member of my team may have hated it, none of us protested when Big Eye gave the order to move in and secure the hole. 

Big Eye himself took point, having attached a tactical flashlight of his own to his carbine as he lead the way. Both Nutty and Bucky followed closely behind him, weapons lowered, but ready. Sticky had positioned us some ten feet back from their last man, with the rest of us following behind in our standard formation. We were moving slower than we had on our approach and during our clears. If you had asked us why in the moment, we’d have insisted that an unfamiliar and unexpected pathway with limited visibility and movement required extra care. The real reason was that we were all scared out of our minds.

The tunnel itself was almost completely unnatural. It didn’t look man made by any stretch of imagination, but it was too straight and uniform to be something that naturally occurred beneath our soil. There were no bumps or jutting rocks in the ground, and in fact the rock looked almost completely smooth past a certain point. Of course, the streak marks of dried blood along the walls and ceilings were also dead giveaways. For some time it didn’t even bend in the slightest, remaining straight at a slightly downward angle for what felt like forever. 

The faint and muffled screaming had stopped once we entered, as had the squelching noise. I hated that fact at the time, and tried to ignore the dread feeling that something inside had only used them to draw us in closer. 

I’m not sure how long had passed before we finally found some deviation in the path, only that it gave me both profound relief and unnerved me at the same time. Said deviation was a smooth curve leading downward at a more intense angle than the one we’d been trekking since we’d stepped through. Still traversable, but certainly more treacherous. 

“Anyone else feel how cold it’s getting?” Asked Avalon as we watched Midas carefully shift towards the bend. Until that moment I actually hadn’t felt it getting colder, but Avalon mentioning it seemed to make the temperature drop all at once. Stepping into the central tent had felt like entering an air conditioned home after a day in the sun. This felt like being shoved outside on a rainy autumn day with no coat. 

“Yeah, I’ve felt it for a while now.” Lucky said from behind me. 

“If we’re going deeper down, shouldn’t it be getting hotter? Cause we’re getting closer to Earth’s core or something?” I asked. 

“After how long we’ve been going? Yeah, we should have felt it getting warmer.” Borat replied. 

“Stay focused, boys. Stay focused.” Sticky ordered. I still wonder if he shut down that conversation for the mission’s sake or his own. 

We stepped carefully as we rounded the curve and made contact with the deeper slope, and I found myself feeling grateful that the blood had dried enough that the cave floor was neither sticky nor slippery. 

That thought gave me another idea. 

“Hey, Borat?” I asked. 

“Yeah, Oculus?” 

“These blood trails have been going on since we saw that central hub, is there even any chance these poor SOBs are still alive?” 

“Dear God, Oculus…” I heard Lucky grumble from behind. I ignored him and observed Borat, watching as he looked up and around at the floors and ceilings, his helmet light illuminating everywhere he looked. After a few seconds, he inhaled sharply before rolling his shoulders ever so slightly. 

“I mean, I can’t say for certain how much we’ve seen. If it’s all the same person obviously not, but I don’t know if it’s just from a few people, all thirteen, maybe some is from whoever-“ 

“Can it, all of you. I said stay focused.” Sticky said curtly, interrupting Borat before he could finish his thought. Having now been instructed to shut up twice by a warrant officer, none of us made a sound. That silence left me time to wonder about what little Borat had said before being shut down. 

Thirteen people. Thirteen people had been stationed at this outpost according to Sticky. Had I seen enough blood for me to justify thinking these people were alive? How could they be? Sure I had heard the screaming, but we had to have been moving for at least half an hour by this point, and I was still seeing the remnants of viscera even now. The idea that something was luring us down here reentered my thoughts, and I felt sick to my stomach. 

The temperature continued to drop as we moved deeper, eventually coming to the end of the massive slope before it evened out onto what looked like stable and solid ground. This new path seemed perfectly straight, but still had no sign of any human life outside of my squad. Before long it began to feel like we were wading through a meat locker with how cold it was getting, and every breath I took appeared visibly in front of me as I walked.

I began wondering how far down we were now. A thousand feet maybe? Two thousand, a mile? Just how deep did this tunnel go? I would find out soon that we had not much farther to go at all. In the beams of light from our flashlights I could see Big Eye come to a stop, holding up a hand to instruct us to do the same. 

“Hold up, you guys hear that?” He asked. I tilted my head down ever so slightly and focused, trying to listen for any sound the captain might have been referring to. It didn’t take long for me to realize what it was he heard. 

The squelching was back. It was faint, barely even there at all, but it was back. One by one I saw the looks on my teammates faces harden as they realized what I had. Whatever it was we were searching for at this point, we were close, very close. I inhaled deeply and tried to steel my nerves as unpleasant images filled my mind. 

“We hear it.” I heard Sticky say after a small delay. Big Eye lowered his hand and began slowly moving forward. 

“Keep your voices low, if the researchers are still alive, we don’t want whoever has them to know we’re coming.” He ordered, voice trembling from either the cold or the fear I’m sure he was hiding, I’m still not sure which. Whatever it was, it did little to instill much confidence in any of us. 

Slowly, an opening came into view, and I could see the cavern opening up into a wide open space. I was too far back and had too many people in front of me to get a clear view at what lay inside, but the steadily increasing volume of whatever was making the uncomfortably wet noises told me I wasn’t going to like whatever it was we found. One by one I watched the members of my squad enter the chamber, each stepping in tandem with room clearing protocol before stepping out of view, and piece by piece, I saw what was inside. All I could say was;

“Sweet mother of God…” 

I understand how absurd what I am about to document is going to sound, so please let me assure you I am telling the whole, honest truth, and nothing but the truth. 

Inside a chamber about the size of a football field was a pulsating mass of human flesh and bone. The mass was at least half the length of the chamber and was maybe two-thirds the height, with additional tendril like growths spilling out of it that snaked between stalagmites and uneven rock. Some even curved and bent around the walls of the chamber, forming smaller pockets of flesh that sloshed and tore as it stretched out. Bits of bone became visible with each sickening rip before being hastily stitched back up by tendrils, replaced with skin from its main body. As horrific as the thing was to behold, it was what we found inside of it that still gives me nightmares.

On each of these patches of flesh was a distinctly human shape. Many of them were too distant to get a clear look at their condition, but the few that were close enough for us to see were absolutely mutilated. Fresh blood oozed from open wounds as their bodies bent and twisted in ways no human body should. Some were even so badly bent that I could see shards of bone sticking out of their limbs. Each one of them had cold, dead eyes, looks of horror or despair frozen on their faces. Even still, I swore I could hear the sounds of pained moaning coming from their mangled bodies. I counted thirteen patches in total. 

“Captain… what the hell are we looking at?” I heard Sticky say in a quivering voice. For a time, Big Eye said nothing, slowly shaking his head as he stared at the Mound and its tendrils. 

“I… I don’t know, Lieutenant… I don’t…” He stammered, unable to even finish speaking. 

“I mean, what do we do? Do we try shooting it?” I heard Lucky ask. 

“How’d that work out for the security detail upstairs?” Avalon replied in a numb voice. Beside me I could see Nutty shaking his head. 

“But we’ve got explosives, full auto weapons, higher calibers, that’s gotta mean something, right?” He asked. Even all these years later, I still don’t know if he was genuinely asking or if he just wanted some vague reassurance we could defend ourselves if it came down to it. Either way, he didn’t get an answer from any of us. What could we have even said? 

Making sure not to step on one of the tendrils, I carefully moved closer to one of the patches of flesh and looked more closely at the person stuck there. The patch itself was maybe ten feet off the ground, with the man himself stuck square in the middle of it. His arms and legs seemed to be infused into the patch, hiding most of his underbody and his forearms. The rest of him seemed to almost protrude out of it like some disturbed garnish on a dish.  

Every so often, the patch itself would pulse, tearing bits and pieces of the sorry soul off before slowly forming small lumps in the tendrils. The lump would then travel down the patch and into one of the tendrils, then back to the main body. When it arrived, the Mound would make a deep grumbling sound that would fill the chamber, sending shivers down my spine. Each time this happened, the victim would whimper in pain before falling silent again, and back into what I pray was a near catatonic state.

“What is it even doing to them?” I wondered aloud. I hadn’t realized I’d vocalized my thought until I heard Big Eye respond.

“We’re not sticking around to find out.”Turning away from the trapped man, I watched as the captain shook his head before turning to face us. I could tell he was trying to put on a brave face, but the trembling in his eyes gave away his true feelings. 

“I’m aborting the mission and getting us out of here. Bucky, grab a few pictures of… whatever this thing is then pack up. Everyone else, get to the tunnel entrance and be ready to move. We are leaving.” He ordered. Bucky obediently, if shakily, obliged and began to take photos of the monstrosity. The rest of us almost eagerly began to shuffle back towards the tunnel we’d entered through. The only man who didn’t immediately follow Big Eye’s order was Borat, who glanced back at the researchers restrained by the Mound.

“What about the outpost personnel, sir? I mean, they’re right here, shouldn’t we at least try to help them somehow?” He asked, turning back to look at each of us as Bucky continued taking pictures. Big Eye stared at Borat sympathetically, and gently shook his head. 

“Look at them, sergeant. Can you think of any way we could help them in this state?” He replied. It was a fair question by any metric. Putting aside the question of how we would even get up to them, how were we supposed to get them free? Cutting into this thing with nothing but combat knives would not only take a painfully long time, but it would almost certainly alert this thing to our presence, if it didn’t know we were here already. Add onto that, there were thirteen of them, clearly in no position to walk or even crawl out of here, and eight of us. Were we supposed to just pick out eight of them and leave the rest to rot? Maybe I’m just justifying my own cowardice, trying to give any halfway understandable excuse as to why we left them there in hell. I don’t know. 

Borat’s expression dropped as Sticky gently pushed past me and walked over to put a hand on his shoulder. I saw Bucky take one last photo before putting away his camera, and as he walked towards the rest of us, I heard a noise, a noise that by this point I’d grown to recognize all too well. 

Knocking, chirping, radio searching. I didn’t even need to look to know that it was the Mound.

Even so, my attention turned immediately to the meaty lump at the center of the chamber, and I watched as it expanded and began to retract the tendrils snaking around it. The patches of flesh seemed to close up, encasing the trapped people within as they were dragged into the mass as it grew to almost the entire width of the chamber and seemed to scrape the ceiling. Without a word, Big Eye, Bucky, Borat, and Sticky raised their weapons, training their sights on the mound as it trembled. I desperately wanted to ready my own weapon, but from my angle I didn’t have clear sight without also putting my squad mates in the line of fire. Even so, I kept my weapon ready, as did the rest of us who’d fallen back. 

Slowly, the amalgamation of sounds began to grow louder. Sticky carefully stepped ahead of Big Eye and Bucky, ushering them behind him with a single hand before moving slightly closer to the Mound. Big Eye took several steps back and stood beside Bucky, who also steadily took steps back towards the tunnel until he was behind even Borat, who likewise aimed his weapon forward. It was probably what saved their lives. What came next happened in an instant. 

Suddenly the Mound sprang to life, tendrils the size of a minivan shooting out like bats out of hell towards the four stragglers.  The order to open fire was said almost immediately, their reactions were quick, but not quick enough. The tendrils tore apart as the mutilated bodies of the researchers lashed out, each screaming high pitched wails with the voices of numerous people. Borat was the first to be taken. 

I watched in horror as his arms were torn violently toward, sending a hail of bullets into the ceiling as the ripped flesh of a woman seemed to extend and wrap around Borat’s arm, and an unnaturally sharp bone jammed into his stomach. I’m sure Borat tried to scream, but I could see the woman’s skin leap from her face, leaving behind only a patchwork of muscle and tendon as it stuck to Borat and pulled him into her with a series of sickening pops and squelches. 

A tendril likewise opened up to consume Big Eye, but his draw was ever so slightly faster. With a few well placed shots I saw him nail the frame of an emaciated man in the cranium, ending its screams and sending it tumbling into the tendril it came from. A third tendril went after Sticky after the second closed in around the now dead body and retracted. I didn’t see the body that reached out for my lieutenant, only the wall of flesh it produced to protect it from Big Eye and Bucky’s fire, and the lanky arm that grabbed him. 

“GO! GET OUT OF HERE!” Was the last thing I ever heard from Sticky before a string of muscle wrapped around his head and pulled him, screaming, into the tendril.

I wish I could say I stood my ground, that I refused to leave my comrades behind and found some way to save them. But I didn’t. I, like every other man there, turned and ran. My mind became a haze as I ran as fast as I could, the sound of pounding of boots becoming almost deafening as I saw the others sprinting forward as fast as their legs could carry them. 

“B-Borat! It got Borat and the lieutenant!” I heard someone shout. 

“I know! Just shut up and keep running!” I yelled as I heard the sound of squelching behind me. My head swerved, and to my horror I saw two more tendrils fast approaching. 

In a panic I turned and sprayed wildly at the tendrils, yelling in a craze as the sheer volume of fire ripped and tore chunks of flesh from the advancing appendages. One was so badly decimated that it folded into itself and began to retreat back down the tunnel, while the second balled up for a brief second before tearing open. I saw the mangled frame of a man I didn’t recognize leaping out at me, arms outstretched with a deep fear in his eyes. 

One, two, three bullets hit the man dead center in the chest, and a fourth in his head as he flailed before tumbling onto the ground, my heart pounding as I continued to unload into the tendril. It began retreating, but I could still hear more squelching and slithering coming from the darkness beyond it. I let off a few more rounds before turning and running back, using the faint lights of my squad mates’ flashlights to follow them. 

When we came upon the incline I took another second to look behind me, weapon extended as my squad began the climb. Visually, I couldn’t see anything, even as my hands shook and my flashlight bounced around in the dark, but I could hear them. Squelching, chirping, knocking, and all getting closer. Hoping I had time, I turned and let the weapon dangle as I began the long climb, seeing Big Eye holding position some several dozen feet above me. I watched as he glanced at each remaining man and urged them up and past him. 

“We gotta keep moving, keep climbing, all of you!” He yelled as Avalon nearly stumbled before the captain caught hold of him. I didn’t remember him passing me, but in the moment I hardly cared. I could hear Lucky grunting as he half jogged up the incline, only just slow enough to keep his footing, Bucky not far behind him. Nutty wasn’t so lucky. I watched as he tried to take a step only for his ankle to roll, sending him careening down to the ground with a pained yell. 

“Nutty!” I cried out as I extended a hand, trying to grab hold of him as he slid past. I nearly stumbled myself from the sudden movement, only just barely keeping my footing and clasping onto a small rock jutting out from the wall. I looked down and breathed heavily as I watched Nutty tumble, landing with a hard thud on the ground below. He rolled on the ground in pain for a second before he slowly pushed himself off the ground and looked up, then back to the tunnel. 

“Oh no, oh God oh please OH GOD-“ He was swallowed up in a second, the broken frame of a haggard man dragging him into the tendril as his broken rib cage dug into his sides. I raised my weapon and opened fire on the man’s frame, but I was too late. Nutty’s scream was muffled in an instant as he was enveloped by the wall of flesh, my bullets chipping away bits and pieces of the flesh protecting him, but unable to hit the man itself as the tendril pulled away. 

“Oculus come on!” I heard Big Eye yell as I felt something forcefully pull at my rig, compelling me upwards. Hearing Nutty’s scream grow fainter and the squelching grow louder was all I needed to convince me as Big Eye half threw me up the incline, his hurried footsteps mirroring my own. 

The climb up was an arduous one, made all the worse by the unceasing noises coming from behind. I’m not sure how long it took us to climb, only that I practically leapt for joy once we saw the bend and made the turn. We were almost there, almost there, I thought. 

Then I felt something latch onto my foot. My balance gave way immediately as I crashed onto the ground, just barely covering my fall with my arms as I whipped around and saw a bony hand latching onto my ankle, the flesh ripping off and rapidly inching farther up my leg as the massive tendril began to open up.

“It’s got me, somebody help me!” I yelled frantically as I haphazardly took my weapon and fired. The spray seemed to delay the tendril’s opening as it extended more flesh to protect its host within, leaving only the bony arm exposed as it inched closer. For a moment I felt the grip loosen and hoped for the briefest second that maybe I would be able to fight this thing off before I felt the worst pain in my life emanating from my foot. 

I screamed and held up my weapon as the tendril leered over me and opened. I froze as I saw the mangled, hateful stare of Sticky glaring down at me, blood oozing from bloodshot eyes. I remember being so shocked to see him. He had only just been grabbed and he was already one of this thing’s puppets? How? Why?

My shock wore off just in time for me to see Sticky’s mouth, or rather what was left of him, opening his mouth as more squelching filled my ears, and what looked like tendons began filling his open maw. I raised my weapon just in time, causing the tendrils to wrap around the hot metal as I strained to keep the hijacked body of my lieutenant off me, fire still raging in my foot as the walls of flesh closed around me, small pieces of bone jamming into my leg. 

I remember feeling a sudden hunger come over me as Sticky stared at me with angry eyes. Hunger. I don’t know how else to describe it, just a deep, painful hunger like I hadn’t eaten in decades. The hunger only grew as I felt the will to fight diminish, the pain extending into my opposite leg. I felt so… so hungry…

All at once I felt something rattle my whole body, a deep boom loud enough for me to hear even within the wall of flesh. My ears began ringing as my vision blurred, the frame of Sticky’s body screamed as the walls opened and retreated, and the weight  on my legs vanished. Weakly looking up from my prone position, I saw the upside down frame of Lucky reloading his under mounted launcher as Big Eye, Bucky, and Avalon opened fire. 

“Oh hell, it’s got his legs, his legs are completely gone!” I heard Lucky shout. My legs, gone, I thought? 

“Yeah I see that! Just grab him and get him out of there! We’ll cover you!” Someone yelled back. No, no my legs couldn’t be gone, I still felt then burning. They were in so much pain, of course they were still there, I reasoned. 

But when I looked down, more than the retreating mass of flesh, I saw two oozing, bleeding stumps cut off at both of my ankles, my left leg even having the soaked remains of some bone sticking out of it. 

Call it shock, call it pain, call it whatever you want, that’s when I passed out. 

That’s my recollection, my full documentation of the operation that went down on September 4, 2017. If you want to know what happened next, I’m sorry, there’s not much more I can tell. The next time I woke up, it was a day later, I don’t know how everyone else got out of there. No one else died from what I was told, so that was good I suppose. 

Over the next several weeks, I was interviewed several times by doctors, psychologists, lawyers, you name it. Most of it was either incredibly boring, incredibly mind numbing, or some combination of both, so I won’t subject you to any of that here. What I will tell you is that over that period of a few weeks, some bullcrap story came out about a mining expedition in the Mojave after some unnamed nobody found signs of oil. That so called expedition was called off after a total of thirty-seven miners got trapped down there, and lost their lives. 

I remember I tried asking one of the lawyers what happened to the “oil” the expedition was going after. She assured me it was “taken care of”, and not to worry about it. I asked if Sticky was one of the miners who  were killed. My heart sank when she confirmed that he was. 

Like I said, the rest is mostly boring crap I won’t bother you with. Myself and every man involved in that op were sworn to secrecy under threat of treason and conspiracy, as I mentioned at the top of my recollection. I guess Uncle Sam must have felt pretty bad about how whole thing went down though, because from what Lucky’s told me, they were each offered a generous sum of cash for their compliance. On my end, I wound up with a slightly smaller lump of cash, and getting outfitted with two new state of the art prosthetic legs completely free of charge. Said prosthetics were so advanced I was even able to return to active duty once I figured out how to walk again. I still feel aches and pains in my fake legs from time to time, even if I take the things off. Just something I learned to live with I guess. 

So the million dollar question then, why break my silence now? I took the money, got some new legs, and I kept silent for going on eight years now. What changed? At the top of my documentation I told you I had a contact who told me about the initial radio signal and what was done about it. Technically, that wasn’t true. I did talk to someone about the signals, but that’s because they reached out to me, not the other way around. 

I can’t give anything away about my contact I haven’t already said, but they did reach out to me a few weeks back. They gave me all their credentials, every official piece of documentation that would prove who they were, even met with me in person to make sure I trusted them. All I’ll tell you about this  person is that they work for one of those stations that monitors radio signals in space, watches the sky, that kinda thing. 

This person, upon our meeting, asked me if I recognized a radio signal that they wanted to play for me. I’m sure I don’t have to tell what that signal was by this point. When I confirmed that I did in fact recognize it, she informed me that signal had been discovered about five times over the course the past year from somewhere in outer space. Worse, a similar  signal, minus the odd sonar noise, was discovered about a mile under the Earth in five distinct spots of the continental United States. Just like the first set that I was sent in to investigate, these signals each predated the radio waves from outer space by a period of exactly one year. These locations included the Rocky Mountains, somewhere deep in the Grand Canyon, the Everglades, the middle of the Red Desert in Idaho, and most alarmingly, the city of Cheyenne in Wyoming. 

I didn’t want to believe it, but after hearing the same thing five times in a row, something no ordinary person could just get a hold of, it was just too hard to deny. I asked why they were telling me this, what they thought I could do. They asked me if I could help. Find a way to get the word out, provide a document detailing the event so they could use it as evidence, stop something terrible before it happens. So that’s exactly what I’m doing. 

I understand this is a lot, and to those of you who live near these landmarks, or within the city I mentioned, I genuinely don’t wish to alarm you. But I’ve seen what lurks beneath. I don’t know what the signals from space mean, or how they activate those hideous Mounds under the Earth, or even why. All I know is what they can do, how a torturous fate awaits those who get caught by them. The hunger that I can still feel in some of my deepest nightmares. I can’t let that happen to anyone else. You needed to be warned. 

I don’t expect I’ll be free much longer. So I’ll say one last thing. I love this country. I don’t know what’s happening, I don’t know why it’s happening so much after so many years of silence, and I don’t know why it’s happening to begin with. All I know is that something out there is making those things, telling them to do unspeakable things to our people, that it’s becoming more frequent. That it killed my friends, men I’ve served with for years. And the powers that be want to hide it from the public. No more. 

You have my transcripts, my documentation. Make use of it. 

Stay safe, all you. And God bless the United States of America.
