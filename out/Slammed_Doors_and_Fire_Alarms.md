 I hate people especially kids my age. Human beings are unpredictable creatures more so when they are teenagers. All the backstabbing and lying and gossiping. Even just thinking about it makes me border line furious. It broke my heart that we took pleasure in the destruction of our comrades. I even felt great sadness whenever i thought about my existence. Why am i doomed to a life that ends the same way as every other piece of shit on earth. This feeling would be the strongest before and after school. I had one more week left starting this Monday. I was almost excited to be done with it until i remembered i still had high school and maybe college. 

I lived in a close knit community but I wouldn’t exactly call it small. Almost all the kids my ages went to the same school so seeing a new face was extremely rare. So when I saw a new kid sitting alone at his own table my kid brain was overwhelmed with curiosity and for the first time in a while, excitement. Why is there a new kid during the last week of school? I walked across the lunchroom and sat myself down across from the boy.

“ I’ve never seen you here before did you just move?” I said to him wonder seeping into my voice. 

“I’ve lived here all my life. I know who everyone here is including you, Derek.” I didn’t quite hear him though, I was more fixated on his face. 

“Hey how come you look like me?” I said harshly. The kid just smiled at me.

“That’s for you to figure out” 

“Uh okay dude” I said picking up my lunch and going to my own table of isolation. I barely touched my food. All I could think about was how that boy looked exactly like me. Did I have a twin no one told me about? My mom is definitely answering some questions when I get home. My mother was a hard working woman. She always offered her unbiased opinion which means her sugar coating skills were non existent. She was a tall woman with beautiful black hair that touched her shoulder blades and jade eyes that sparkled when the sun caught them just right. 

“Mom, do I have a twin brother?” I said from the kitchen table. She stopped putting dishes away and turned to face me. She had a very solid look of confusion on her face before it turned to what I’d call judgmental.

“Aren’t you to old for imaginary friends?” She said poking fun at me. I was not amused. I fake laughed it off as convincingly as I could and retreated back to my room. I became increasingly worried that I’d gone crazy but the more I thought about him the more relaxed I became. I checked the clock on my bedside table before crawling into bed for my afternoon nap. The next time I checked my clock it was 545 am the next morning. I had slept damn near 15 hours and I felt great.

The next day at school was terrible. Although it had gotten better this last week, I had a bullying problem. This wasn’t your typical movie bully’s though. They were vicious for 8th graders. Like little piranhas that fed off of shame and insecurity instead of meat. By the time end of day came around I’d been missing a shoe and a shiny swollen eye. On my way out the doors I saw that boy again, or I guess in better words, the other me. He was standing around the corner of the building waving me over. I looked around and pointed to myself just to make sure he was talking to me. He nodded and beckoned again. 

“What do you want dude.” I said annoyed and hostile already over this shit hole of a school. 

“Soon my friend. You will be lifted up and your sorrows stomped beneath your feet.” He said as he pulled me in to a firm embrace. Usually I’d freak out and run away but this time was different. I stayed in that embrace for what felt like hours. It’s the safest I’d ever felt. He walked me home that day. We didn’t speak a word the whole way there. When we got to my house he simply patted my back, gave a short nod and walked away. 

“Hey kiddo how was school?” My mom said oddly cheerful. She’s a defense attorney so her leaving work in a good mood is always a shock. Before I could answer she stormed over to me and crouched down until she was face level. 

“What happened to my baby’s face?!” She said almost shaking with sadness and rage. 

“Don’t worry mom it’s nothing I promise” I said with a smile on my face. After about a 30 minute window of straight prying she finally dropped it. As I walked up to my room I felt nothing but security. For some reason my usual feelings of disdain and annoyance weren’t there. I felt happy. Excited. So excited in fact I didn’t sleep a wink that night.

The next day was awful. I didn’t see the strange boy at school today and a wave of sadness covered my body as I left the building. My tormentors were rather relentless today. When I got home I realized my mom wasn’t there. I raced to my room, seizing the opportunity to cry unbothered and undetected. I cried and cried clutching my privates. They made me expose myself to them while they recorded. At the time my brain thought that was a better alternative then getting my face beat in but now I’d rather have the latter. The tears kept coming until no more water left my eyes and I fell asleep. 

I woke up to the sound of a knock on my bedroom door. I sat there frozen in fear until I heard a voice, my voice, coming from the other side. It said to me-

“Don’t be scared Derek. You’ve been waiting for tomorrow your whole life. It’s time to get ready.” I had no idea what he was talking about but for some reason I understood him completely. Tomorrow is the day. It’s finally time.

Im writing this last segment before I execute my plan. Im so excited I can barely contain myself. I felt the urge to document my experience of this past week not from confusion but out of pride. After today all I will know is peace. Thank you guys for reading and I’ll talk to you all soon. ❤️  




UPDATE PLEASE READ  


  


im sorry it took me so long to address the post but the grieving process has been extremely difficult for me. After reading my son’s blog I feel so stupid I didn’t see it sooner. I can’t sleep or even clothes my eyes without hearing that phone call. I’ve never felt so much pain and fear until I pressed that phone to my ear. It was my son and he said-

“Hey mom it’s Derek! Im not gonna be home in time for dinner I got some stuff to take care of at school. I love you and I’ll see you later.”

The phone fell from my hand in shock. My son is 27. He’s been out of school for at least 9 years. But it’s almost because of what I heard. In the background of the call I heard something that will haunt me as a mother the rest of my life. I heard the blaring of fire alarms blended with screams as doors slammed in the background. I ran to my son’s room and searched around when I found something that solidified my realization. My son’s medication. He hadn’t taken it in 7 months. 

23 lives were lost today including my sons. I wish I could have seen the signs. I could have saved them. I could have saved my son. please pay close attention to your loved ones. you never know what they are going through. To all the families of the victims I understand my words mean nothing but im truly sorry and destroyed by your loss. and to my son wherever he was sent after this life- why?
