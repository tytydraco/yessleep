I need to preface this by saying that what I’m about to share is deeply unsettling, and I haven’t been able to sleep since it happened. I don’t know if anyone will believe me, but I have to get this off my chest.

It started with a stain.

I’m meticulous about keeping our home spotless. My husband, Mark, helps out with mowing the lawn and taking out the trash, but the rest is on me. So, when I noticed a dark, wet smear on the siding while tending to the garden, I was immediately concerned. It looked like someone had wiped their hand across the house. I grabbed an old towel and wiped it off, but the substance clung to my fingers. No amount of scrubbing at the sink or in the shower could remove it.

The next morning, I inspected the exterior walls again, my fingers still feeling slick from the residue. Near our bedroom window, I smelled it—a ripe, earthy, almost animalistic odor. The wetness stretched from the ground up to the window, vaguely human-shaped. I thought we might have a severe mold problem.

That night, I woke up and found myself standing by the back sliding glass doors. My fingers tingled with that same sensation. Mark was sound asleep upstairs. I didn’t intend to open the door, but I did. Something moved toward me, then on me. It slid over my skin, cool and gentle. My clothes clung to me, soaked.

I turned and saw it standing in the dark kitchen—a tall, slick figure with a bulbous head tilted in silent knowing. Its skin was taut, like stretched latex over bony ridges, wet and gleaming in the moonlight. No face, no eyes, just empty black holes where features should be.

A sound emerged from one of the holes—a moan, a whisper, something in between. A wet, sucking noise that made my fingers clench and my stomach tighten.

I should have screamed or run, but I couldn’t. Something pulled me toward it. I slid across the floor, not moving on my own but being drawn in.

My breath caught. It approached.

The black void of its mouth dilated, not to consume but to take.

I let it.

My nerves tingled as its wetness enveloped me like new skin, pressing and sliding everywhere. I moved, arching against the gentle pressure. There was no pain, no fear, only it. I trembled.

It didn’t consume me. It didn’t hurt me. It penetrated me.

I felt like I was overflowing, my skin growing tight. It was too much, too slick, too intense.

In the moment between ecstasy and obliteration, it was gone.

I collapsed on the kitchen floor, trembling, my clothes and skin drenched and hollow. Something was taken from me but I wanted it to take more. 

Silence. The air was heavy, like a storm was coming. My body ached for it, but I was alone.

Mark slept peacefully upstairs.

Some nights I go to that door and leave it open. Just waiting for it to come back.
