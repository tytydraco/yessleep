The tea scorched my throat like venom.

The world reeled. Walls dissolved into syrupy shadow and brick by brick, another place assembled around me. Older. Wetter.

My heart seized.

The basement.

I was back in the basement.

This moment, I remembered it. It was my birthday. I only knew because Carol had promised me a present. A little surprise. Something handmade. But then the Ma’am said she needed her help with the Red Queen’s story.

When I asked if Carol could still give me the present, the Ma’am smiled—tight and teeth-bared.

“I suppose not,” she said. “Considering you’ll be in bed by the time we’re finished. And by then it won’t be your birthday anymore, now will it?”

I cursed. Or rather, I heard myself curse inside the memory.

The Wither Tree answered.

It grew up out of the dirt of the basement floor, up through the entire house. It groaned in the dark, low and guttural like a dying god. It always made noises—shifting branches and creaking bark, but sometimes... sometimes it spoke.

Sometimes it said my name.

I stepped forward, lantern in hand. The flame stuttered in the damp. This was my least favorite household duty: braving the dark. Fetching practically ancient cans from the sagging shelves, while shadows curled across the walls like watching things.

*Beans. Soup. Peas.*

I mouthed the list like a prayer.

The tree pounded, throbbed like a heartbeat.

Groaned.

“Boy…”

A breathless voice. Rough as coals.

“Such a sweet child… won’t you come closer?”

I froze. The lantern trembled. Shadows breathed.

*Beans. Soup. Peas.*

Not this shelf. Not that one.

“Just a taste,” it crooned. “Just the heart…”

I bolted.

Cans clattered from my arms and spilled across the floor, rolling like teeth as I flung the door shut behind me. My breath came in panicked bursts.

And there she was.

The Ma’am.

She stood waiting in the hall, silhouetted against the light of her study. Her hand cracked across my face.

**Smack.**

“Don’t slam doors.”

I winced. “...I’m sorry.”

**Smack.**

“You are not sorry.”

**Smack.**

“You are malicious and unruly.”

I clutched my cheek, eyes stinging, lip trembling.

“It was the tree,” I stammered. “There’s something inside it. A monster. It said it wanted my heart—”

“The only monster in this house is you.”

She stepped closer. Her breath smelled like copper and ink.

“And you haven’t got a heart to give.”

She glanced down at the spilled cans. Beans. Soup. Peas. Rolling in circles.

“Clean those up.”

Then she turned and vanished into her study. The door clicked shut. The lock slid home.

I busied myself with picking up the cans, dreaming of the day all of this would end. The day the Ma'am could be a mother to me. The day we could all be happy, like the families Gran told me about. 

The Red Queen. 

That's who we were waiting for. We couldn’t leave until she showed up, otherwise the Hungry Things would get us. 

But the Red Queen would save us. 

**Clack-clack-clack. Ding.**

I paused. Her typewriter.

And underneath it, faint: 

Carol. Rasping.

She sounded exhausted. Weak.

“…It’s his birthday…”

“Quiet,” the Ma’am snapped. “I’m nearly finished the draft. Your squirming is making the ink run.”

“He deserves a happy birthday…”

“He deserves what I say he deserves.”

A cough. Wet. Weak. “He’s kind, you know. He isn’t like your other monsters…”

Not like her other monsters? My breath caught. Is that what I was—another monster?

Silence.

Then the floor creaked.

Footsteps. Slow. Deliberate. And the Ma’am’s voice again—soft now, almost sweet. But sweet like spoiled fruit.

“Would you like to know a secret, Mother?”

I pressed my ear to the door, heart racing. 

“He was never meant to be my monster. You were.”

A pause. A shiver in my spine.

“The Boy is just collateral. A little leverage. Because if you don’t behave his story won’t have a happy ending. And I know you can’t stomach the thought of that. Not after what happened to your dear Gretchin.”

My stomach twisted. Tears burned hot in my eyes. Grethicn. My older sister, the one that Ma’am had exiled to die in the Thousand Acre Wood. 

I always knew I’d been born from the Ma’am’s imagination. But I always thought I was here to help her save the world. From the Disorder. And the Boogeyman.

But it turns out I was just a living ransom note—a child raised to bleed the one person the Ma’am couldn’t break. 

Gran was never meant to love me. 

She was meant to suffer me.

The memory flickered, straining under the weight of my emotions. The peeling wallpaper gave way to the flicker of emergency lighting in Chamber 13, then shifted back again. I heard myself, not in the memory, but in the present. Groaning. Mumbling in delirium. Fighting back against the Hatter’s magic.

I'd nearly pulled myself out when I stepped back in the memory.

The floorboard creaked.

Inside, the Ma’am’s footsteps retreating to her desk stopped dead. My heart stopped with them.

No. No no no—

The door flung open. She stood in the frame, eyes wild, words sharper than a knife. “Eavesdropping are we?”

She lunged. Fingers twisted in my hair. I yelped as she dragged me down the hall, boots clapping hard behind us.

“Selfish. Ingrate. *Rotten*.”

“Carol!” I sobbed. 

Gran's voice rasped behind us. “Don’t…” she groaned. “Please don’t hurt Levi…”

I think she tried to follow, but there was a thud. The sound of her frail body hitting the floor.

I twisted in the Ma’am’s grip. “Lemme go! Carol—!”

The Ma’am shoved me forward. Toward the only door in the house not boarded up with timber and nails. This one had locks instead. A dozen of them, steel and brass and rusted iron. She set to work on them, her movements frantic, furious.

I tried to back away. Her hand yanked me close.

Her eyes blazed—not just with anger, but with something worse.

Hate.

“There’ll be no more disobedience from you,” she seethed. “I’ve given you chance after chance. Each time, you disappoint. Each time, you prove what an ungrateful little brat you are. Just like your sister.”

Her fingers dug into my shoulder like talons.

“So now you’ll get exactly what you want—a life without a family.”

Click. Clack. Snap. The locks tumbled open, one after another.

“You can live it out in the woods, alongside all the corpses you call your siblings.”

“Please, Mama, I didn’t mean to—”

She raised her hand.

I flinched.

But the blow didn’t come.

“Do *not* call me that,” she hissed. Her voice had dropped. Cold now. Measured. “You haven’t earned the privilege of calling me mother.”

She crouched, face inches from mine. “Now stay where you are. Move an inch, and I’ll send you to get chopped up by the Woodsman instead. Would you like that?”

I shook my head so fast it made my neck ache.

The Ma’am gave the final lock a savage twist and flung the door open.

Light.

Blinding light.

I staggered, shielding my eyes. Wind whipped past my cheeks. Real wind. For a moment, the sunlight caught me fully and I forgot everything—forgot the grief, forgot the yelling.

And it was beautiful.

But then I saw ahead the gnarled stretch of haunted wood. The twisting boughs. The shifting branches. It felt like a hundred eyes watched me, hungry and waiting beyond the dark of the leaves. 

And that’s when it truly hit me—I wasn’t walking into freedom. 

I was walking to my grave. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I opened my eyes with a groan.

The wind was gone. So was the Thousand Acre Wood.

It was just cold steel and blinking red emergency lights. The stench of blood and fear. I blinked blearily, my head pounding as I took in the circular stone walls of Chamber 13. 

My prison looked the same as ever. Same pretentious typewriter. Same scuffed chairs. Same cracked ceiling opening to—

Okay. 

That was new.

The floating shards of mirror-glass were gone. Now there hung a full moon, round and pale, squinting down at me with a yawning face. “Oh, you’re awake. If you’re looking for your friend, I’m afraid he’s gone and left.”

The moon was telling the truth.

The room was empty. There wasn’t any sign of Mister Neither anywhere—and not only that, but the door was *open*. Cracked ajar. It was like Mister Neither had gone out for a smoke and forgotten to lock it behind him.

I rose on shaking legs, hardly believing my luck. Freedom. 

Actual freedom.

Then my heart pounded—ears prickling for any sound of an ambush. 

This felt like a trap. It had to be one. Why would he just let me walk free? He’d just murdered Edwards to keep me for himself, hadn’t he? 

Unless...

Maybe it wasn’t the Hatter showing me mercy. Maybe it was the Hare.

Had Jekyll finally overpowered Hyde? It seemed unlikely, but I didn’t have time to run a full analysis on the situation. Trap or not, I had to try the door. It was my one shot at surviving this. 

“Did my—err—friend, say where he was going?” I asked the moon, hoping to at least get some bearings on the situation.  The moon gave a wide yawn. Smacked it lips. “Fraid’ not. Only mentioned he had ‘other’ business to attend to.” Another yawn. “Then he told me to watch over you… or else.”

It snorted. “As if I’d let a rabbit boss me around.”I blinked. “Right. Well, I’ll uh… see you around, I guess.”

“Ta.”

I hurried for the doorway—then stopped.

Edwards’ playing card was still there, pinned to the wall by his knife. I pulled it free with a grunt, hoping—praying—it might shed some light on my situation. 

No such luck.

The card was blank.

No scribbled escape route. Not even a handful of tips for defeating bloodthirsty rabbits.

Nothing. Just plain white card stock, like the machine forgot to add a suit or rank. I needed a trump card, and all I got was a misprint.

Typical. 

Still, I pocketed it. If nothing else, it was something to remember Edwards by. The man sacrificed his life to buy me a little more time, and if I somehow got out of this, I’d make a fucking shrine for this stupid card.

I took a deep breath. Cracked the door. Stepped out into the corridor.

And it wasn't what I remembered. 

The hallway was different. Gone were the scarlet bricks that spiraled into infinity. They'd been replaced with a sprawling expanse of white nothingness. Sterile. Blinding. Like a freshly-scrubbed hospital room. 

So it wasn’t just the layout of the Sub-Vaults that changed during Realignments. It was the aesthetic. Like someone was plucking pieces from different realities and pasting them together down here hour by hour.

Which begged the question—how long had it been since the last Realignment? I didn’t know, but the last thing I needed was to get caught out here when the next storm tore through. 

Better hurry. 

I jogged through endless, liminal corridors like a man looking for a grocery aisle that didn’t exist. Left. Right. Up. Down. Soon I couldn’t even tell which direction was forward anymore. 

Rows of cells lined the walls—thick glass and black bars. Some empty. Others... not.

Creatures twitched behind the glass. Whispered in dead languages. One sat hunched in the shadows, rocking back and forth, eyes like raw pearls. Another pressed its face to the bars and hissed my name.

One reached through the bars as I passed, long fingers brushing my sleeve. It coaxed me toward it. Told me I looked lost, that it could help. The wild thing is it looked human—maybe *too* human. Perfect teeth. Crystal smile. But one look at the label beside its cell told me everything I needed to know.

**CONSCRIPT: 452 - PLAYTIME PETE**

**THREAT CLASS: 5 - MASSACRE**

**STRATEGY ID:  213 - 'FREE CANDY'**

It gripped the bars, smiling after me like a maniac.

Still—Playtime Pete was right about one thing. I *was* lost. And I did need help. Every minute that ticked by dragged me closer to the next Realignment, and one step closer to making Edwards' sacrifice meaningless.

I had to find somebody. Anybody, really. 

An Inquisitor. 

A Warden. 

Hell, at this point I’d even settle for Julia, the office gossip—and she screwed me out of my last promotion.  

Just not an Overseer. The Jack of Clubs’ warning still echoed in my mind: *They want to dissect you.* 

I'd already had my fill of being a monster's science experiment. If the Overseers wanted to gut me, then they could take a number and get in line. 

The floor shook. Just a little. Barely noticeable, but familiar enough to stop my heart. 

The Sub-Vaults were starting to stir. Just like they had when Edwards was torn away. Already I could see Conscripts shifting uneasily beyond the bars of their cages. Some watching me with morbid anticipation, others howling like wolves before a storm. 

Faster, Reyes.

This couldn’t be how it ended.

I pushed harder, heart hammering, but a pair shadows stretched ahead of me—and with them, the tinker of metal footsteps across tile. Two figures emerged from the far end of the hall.

Porcelain masks.

Vanta black armor.

Heart-shaped shields stained with ancient blood.

The Overseers met my gaze.

Shit. 

"Halt, interloper."

I froze, instinct slamming the brakes before my brain even caught up. The playing cards pinned to their chests said it all: the 3 and 9 of Hearts. Unlike the other suits, the Hearts weren’t just damaged—they were broken beyond repair. They’d been healers once, guardians for the traumatized, those clawing their way back from contact with urban legends and other Negative Narratives.

Then Alice disappeared. And whatever compassion the Hearts had been built for... shattered. The Order tried to put them back together—but like Humpty Dumpty, it didn’t work out so well.

Now the Hearts had one job: interrogative torture.

And they were very, very good at it.

I staggered backward, my mind scrambling for options. An arm shot through the bars behind me and yanked me tight against the cage.

"You should’ve taken my offer to help," whispered a bizarrely cheerful voice against my ear.

I twisted in the Conscript’s grasp—and froze. 

Fuck.

Playtime Pete.

How many times was someone going to abduct me today?

"Get off," I snarled, struggling against his grip, but it was useless. A Threat Class 5 entity could tear apart a SWAT team without breaking a sweat, and here I was, squirming like a toddler.

Meanwhile, the Overseers closed the distance, porcelain masks gleaming beneath the sterile white lights. Their painted faces wept crimson tears. They weren’t as massive as the Jack of Clubs—not by half—but what they lacked in size, they made up for in creative cruelty. The Hearts didn’t kill you quickly. They took you apart like a clock, savoring every broken tick.

"This is he," hummed the 3 in a broken melody. "The Analyst. The one the False Dealers seek. We are decreed to retrieve him at all costs, Brother."

The 9 nodded, pale cloak rippling off his jagged pauldrons. "We will honor the Inquisition’s request. Excise the spare."

The 3 lifted her arm, blood-red shield catching the light. Her gaze shifted past me, locking onto Playtime Pete. The Conscript stiffened—then, without warning, released me. I stumbled free, hands splayed, heart hammering.

"Hold on," he blurted, that uncanny smile still stitched across his lips. "Pete was just trying to help. Y-You told the little rat to halt. Pete halted him!" The 3 cocked her arm back, shield clutched tight in her black gauntlet.

Playtime Pete yelped, scrambling back from the bars. He cowered against the back wall, fire-red hair, childish blue coveralls. If it weren't for the fact his eyes kept sliding down his face, and his smile never broke, you'd never guess he was a monster.

"I let him go!" Pete shrieked. "I did as you told me, ya daft bitch!"

"For the Mother," intoned the 9, his voice low and final.

The 3 hurled her shield. It whirled through the air with a shriek of rending metal, the heart-shaped blade curving perfectly between the bars—and burying itself in Playtime Pete’s chest. He looked down in slow, stupid disbelief as the shield split him nearly in half, intestines spilling out in looping ropes onto the cell floor. His legs kicked once, twice. Then fell still.

The 3’s humming rose into a thin, warbling whistle. With a wet *thunk*, the shield tore free and snapped back into her hand. She fastened it to her back with a soldier’s precision, then turned her painted mask toward me.

"Rejoice, Analyst Reyes," she said sweetly. "You have been granted salvation this day."

The Hearts clinked forward in perfect step, their black armor stark against the glaring white of the hallway. I hesitated. Maybe—just maybe—they were actually here to help. The Spades had wanted me dead, sure, but maybe that was *personal*. Maybe the Hearts were different.

"Thank you," I gasped. "I really *really* need to get out of here. There’s an evil rabbit after me and—"

The 9’s porcelain mask shifted mid-step, the painted sorrow hardening into something colder. Calculating. The 3’s humming faltered, dipping into a low, almost mourning key.

"He is the one," the 9 said slowly— "—the Spades warned of," finished the 3.

Oh no.

"The variant," murmured the 9. "The wild card."

The 3’s voice lifted, almost reverent. "If he’s shuffled into the Deck—"

"—the False Dealers lose control," finished the 9. “It will bring chaos to the Deck.”

Wild card. False Dealers. Chaos. 

I had no idea what they were talking about, but I got the sense it wasn’t friendly. 

My feet moved before I could think. A slow, instinctive shuffle backward.

No Jack to protect me this time. 

The 3 tilted her head up at the 9, the painted grief on her porcelain mask warping into something grotesque—like a child begging for a toy. "May I open him, Brother?" she whispered. "Before the Shuffle? His eyes sing wrong songs, and I should like to hear if his heart sings the same."

"For the Mother?”“For the Mother.”The 9 reached for his shield. "Then proceed."

The 3 turned back to me, and the mask melted into a grotesque caricature of glee.

I bolted.

Their footsteps slammed against the floor behind me, a thunderous rhythm underscored by the tangled, manic humming of the 3 and 9. An asylum choir chasing me down. Hearts were sadists, sure—but they weren’t built for speed. In their iron suits, they were only slightly faster than me.

Slightly.

But unfortunately, that still meant I was about ten seconds away from being pinned to the wall like Playtime Pete’s sadder sequel.

A hiss cut the air behind me. I ducked just in time as a razor-edged shield screamed past my head, shearing a chunk from the wall. 

Left. Hard left. Down a side corridor, sprinting blind—

And there, just ahead: a figure about to step through a doorway.

Black suit.

Silver pocketwatch.

Inquisitor.

"Wait!" I shouted, sprinting full-tilt toward her. 

The woman jerked back, blinking fast as she caught sight of me. Recognition hit first—then disbelief. "Analyst Reyes? Holy shit. We’ve had teams tearing the Sub-Vaults apart looking for you! Where the hell have you—"

A shield screamed past my ear, embedding itself in the wall inches from her face. She flinched hard, color draining from her cheeks as the Overseers thundered around the corner.

"They’re trying to fucking dissect me!" I gasped, reaching out to her. "Stop them!"Authority straightened her spine. "Analyst Reyes is not to be—"

The shield wrenched itself free from the wall with a disembodied shriek and slashed across her cheek. She staggered, hand flying to her face, eyes wide with disbelief.

"You have blasphemed, Sister," hummed the 9—right behind me. 

"I disagree, Brother.” Steel fingers clamped around my collar, yanked me off my feet. I dangled helplessly in the grip of the 3 of Hearts. “Our blasphemy was ever bowing to the False Dealers.”

So the Inquisition was the False Dealers. 

"For the Mother," the 9 intoned.“For the Mother.”

And I could guess the Mother was Alice. 

Inquisitor Tallis looked shellshocked as she scrambled for her pocketwatch. Flipped it open. Twisted the dial at the top, then brought it to her lips. “Owens,” she said, speaking into it. “This is Inquisitor Tallus. I’ve located Reyes but he’s about to be—”

Alarms blared. Long. Aching. 

Familiar. The PA system crackled to life, that same pre-recorded message rolling out.

**"STANDBY FOR REALITY REALIGNMENT."**

The ground shook. 

The walls began to pulse, like they were falling inward then backward. Inquisitor Tallus cursed, shouting—begging—for the Overseers to release me, but they ignored her commands. I’d never seen an Overseer disobey an Inquisitor before.

It was almost like the Deck was beginning to rebel. 

Was the Order losing control of its Overseers? Is this what the Hearts meant by bringing chaos to the Deck—were they trying to usurp the False Dealers?

**“PLEASE ENSURE ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS ARE CLOSED.”**

The air thundered, slow and sickening. I thrashed. "Let me go! You’re gonna get us all killed out there!"

The 3 only smiled, her porcelain face crinkling into something almost maternal. "Our souls belong to Mother. Death cannot claim them."

The 9 placed a heavy hand on my shoulder. "We will be shuffled into the deck. Together. And—""—redrawn anew," finished the 3, tightening her arms until I could barely breathe.

The wind whipped at my collar, screaming through the crumbling hallway. The tiled floor rippled and heaved, like the world itself was being shaken apart from waking up far beneath.

Across the widening breach, Inquisitor Tallis still stood in the doorway. Her hair lashed her face. Her eyes locked onto mine—haunted. Regretful. Her lips shaped a familiar phrase.*I’m sorry.*

I nodded, numb. There was nothing she could do.

No one could stop what was coming.

The Order wasn’t just losing control. It was crumbling. Dying. 

Mister Neither was loose.The Hearts had rebelled. And all around us, thousands of caged nightmares were waiting for their chance to break free and deliver a bloodbath on their captors. 

Tallis gave me one last salute—a final, broken acknowledgment—then slammed the door shut, leaving me alone with the 3 and 9 of Hearts. Helpless.

The 3 lifted me like a sacrificial offering, arms locked beneath my shoulders. She cried out, voice cracking with joy. "Hold fast, Brothers! The shuffling comes!"

I turned my head into the gale and saw it—a monstrous wall of debris, roaring down the corridor like the apocalypse given life. It wasn't just a storm. It was erasure, a tsunami made from the ruins of countless broken realities—from wonder itself. 

Terror bricked my limbs. 

The 9 staggered forward to meet the end, arms spread wide against the storm, cloak snapping like torn wings. "To shatter the Deck!" he bellowed. "We offer our Brother, the Joker!”

The word hit me like a stray round. 

The Joker. 

The missing card the Hare had hunted for, the second of the pair, had it been me all along? 

My mind flailed for proof, for any scrap of—

I dug into my pocket. Edwards blank card. It blazed to life in my fist. Ultraviolet ink surged across the stock, outlining a grinning court jester, and my jaw dropped.

It was true. 

All this time—

*I* was the second. 

**DING!**

Not an alarm. A typewriter bell. The entire hallway lurched right, as if someone yanked the carriage of reality sideways.

The 3 hoisted me higher.  “Mother, we offer chaos for—”

The storm hit. 

Wind sheared porcelain from her mask, disintegrating it into dust.

My ribs imploded inward, shattering my thoughts as my breath folded into a paper-thin whimper. My body sloughed apart like a sentence being unwritten.

The storm unmade me, atom by shrieking atom, until all that was left was the ache, and the empty page I'd been written upon.

The broken boy.

The failed draft.

The storm never killed me. It did something worse.

It peeled back my armor—my decades of repression, the jokes I cracked to stay sane, the lies I told myself just to keep breathing. It dug up every guilt I’d buried under cleverness and control, and showed me the truth: I’d never stopped being that scared little boy in the basement. I’d just gotten better at shutting him up.

When it was done, the storm left me one final gift: the chance to witness what my survival cost.

Because of me, the Hearts succeeded in collapsing the Deck. I knew that meant Overseer rebellion. Which also meant unguarded Vaults. Which also meant that soon enough, thousands of caged nightmares would be set loose upon on the world—hungry, violent, and free.

And all I could think was that Owens had been right. She'd told Edwards over the PA that either the Order ended tonight, or I did.

Unfortunately, I survived.
