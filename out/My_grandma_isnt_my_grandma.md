I haven’t seen my grandma in three years. My mom and I moved across the country after the divorce, and we didn’t have the money for a plane ticket. (At least, that’s what my mom claims. I think it’s just because she hates my grandma.)

Well, funny how her attitude magically changed when her boyfriend presented her with plane tickets to Costa Rica. *Ava, your Grandma’s so much fun. She’ll teach you how to knit. She’ll teach you how to bake butterscotch cookies. She’s the best!*

She did warn me about something, though.

“Her mind has gotten bad,” my mom told me. “She has trouble remembering things… recognizing people.”

“Is she gonna be okay?”

“Yeah, but… just be patient with her, okay? And if she seems really out of it, call Mrs. Dempsey down the street. I put her number in your phone.”

“Okay.”

“But you’re going to have a great time!” my mom said, plastering on a smile. “It’s going to be wonderful!”

Two days later I was getting off at Pittsburgh airport. Funny how my mom said I was too young to go to the diner alone with Shireen—*the world is dangerous for a thirteen-year-old girl,* her words\*—\*but she had no problem sending me off on a plane alone.

My grandma wasn’t great with cell phones—she didn’t pick up when I called—but as soon as I got to the pickup line, I saw her silver Subaru Outback at the curb. Grandma stood beside it, smiling widely.

“Grandma!” I said, running up to her.

She didn’t open her arms to hug me. She just stood there, looking down at me.

“… Grandma?”

“Hello, dear,” she said, after a pause, as if just noticing me for the first time now. “How have you been? I’m so happy to see you.”

Then she opened the car door and gestured me inside.

The car smelled like old-person smell. I’m sorry that’s mean, but it’s true. I crinkled my nose as I pulled on my seatbelt, and she drove us back through the city, out into the Pennsylvanian countryside.

“Get comfortable, dear,” Grandma said as she led me inside. The house looked the same as it always did: a little stale, a little outdated, but also oddly comforting compared to the ‘minimalistic’ style of my mom’s house. I glanced at the needlepoint hanging in the foyer, of a large pitcher of lemonade.

“Make yourself at home. You can eat anything you find in the fridge or the pantry,” she told me. “Oh! Except, I almost forgot. I do have one rule. The basement is off-limits.”

“Why?”

“It’s a little dangerous down there, dear. Wouldn’t want you getting hurt.”

I frowned. The basement had never been off-limits before. It was finished on one side, and she had a bunch of board games and a sofa down there. I liked hanging out down there. It was the only place that didn’t smell like old people.

“It wasn’t dangerous before,” I protested.

“Well, it is now,” she said—in a significantly firmer tone. Then her smile went right back on, and she asked me: “Would you like some butterscotch cookies?”

“Yes, please!”

My mom was right—Grandma was kind of fun. I helped her with the cookies, and she told me she’d send me home with the recipe. I did some reading and talked to my friend Shireen on the phone. Then it was bedtime.

Tall and thin, Grandma looked like a ghost as she paced down the dark hallway to her bedroom. “Night-night,” she said, poking her head out and giving me a wave.

“G’night, Grandma.”

Her blue eyes glinted in the darkness. Then the door snicked shut.

I fell asleep quickly, despite the bed that was a little too soft and the loud cricket outside my window. I woke up with a start, however, and looked at my phone to see it was almost 2 AM.

My throat was parched, so I headed out to the hall bathroom to get some water.

As I walked across the hallway, I noticed Grandma’s bedroom door was open.

And as I looked harder…

*What the hell?*

Grandma was sitting on her bed in her nightgown. Staring out into the hallway, head tilted slightly. Blue eyes glinting in the darkness.

I stopped in my tracks.

“… Grandma?”

Was she… *smiling?*

“Grandma!”

“Ava, is that you?” she called out.

No, she wasn’t smiling. At least not anymore.

“Yeah, it’s me,” I replied, my voice wavering. “Why are you up?”

“I thought I heard something,” she replied. “So I was just sitting here to make sure… it was nothing.”

I got my water, feeling unsettled. When I got out of the bathroom, Grandma was poking her head out of the doorway again, waving. “Night-night.”

“…. Goodnight.”

The next day, when I asked her about it, she didn’t even seem to remember the interaction.

“I don’t remember being up,” she said, looking at me. In the sunny light filtering through the window, she looked much less… scary. White hair tied back with a silver barrette, pale wrinkled skin, tired blue eyes. “You saw me up?”

“Yes,” I said, firmly.

“Huh.” She rose from the seat, still in her nightgown, and shuffled towards the stove. “Would you like pancakes this morning, Alison?”

My heart sank. Alison was my mom’s name. “Ava,” I corrected, following her into the kitchen.

“Right, of course. Ava.” She shook her head. “You’re just a spitting image of her, when she was your age. The dark eyebrows, and the curly hair…” She shook her head again. “It’s like going back in time.”

She made the pancakes in silence. The tines of the fork, hitting the bowl. Another egg *glooping* in, cracked eggshells set by the counter. A sharp sizzle as the viscous batter hit the cast iron pan.

“I have chocolate chips I can add,” she said, riffling through the counter. “Oh, wait… these expired a year ago.”

“It’s fine,” I told her.

After breakfast, I thought maybe we’d play a game of Go Fish like old times, or take a walk; but Grandma had other plans. “I’m afraid I’m feeling rather tired,” she told me. “Is it okay if I go rest, and you just hang out here?”

“That’s fine. I brought my Switch,” I told her. “Video games.”

“Oh! Okay. That’s nice. Well, get me if you need anything, okay?”

I nodded.

I found myself surprised that I was disappointed. I thought I didn’t miss all those things we used to do, boring things like playing cards or walking. But I did. *Whatever. I’m here for a whole week,* I told myself, going up to my room. I booted up my Switch and started playing Pokemon.

A few hours went by. When I got hungry, I went back down to the kitchen; but Grandma still wasn’t around. *I hope she’s okay,* I thought.

I poked around the fridge and found some leftover chicken, dated two days ago. I popped it in the microwave and sat down to eat.

I’d only been eating a few minutes when I heard it.

A scuffing sound.

Coming from the basement.

I got off the couch and walked towards the basement door. *She told me not to go down there.* What was down there, then? Rats? An illegal, exotic pet? *Yeah right.* The scuffing sounds continued; I pressed my ear to the door.

And then I heard it.

*“Help me.”*

Spoken *in my Grandma’s voice.*

Every muscle in my body froze. *She must’ve gotten trapped down there. Maybe she fell down the stairs. That’s why I haven’t seen her for hours.* I undid the deadbolt and swung the door open. “Grandma?” I called.

The lights were off, but from what little I could see, it didn’t look like she was lying at the bottom of the stairs. *Thank God.* “Grandma?” I called again, louder this time.

*“Help me.”*

“I’m co—”

Hands grabbed me from behind and yanked me forcefully back.

The door slammed in my face. Then my grandma was in my face, her eyes wild. *“I told you not to go in the basement!”* she shrieked, so loudly my ears rang.

“I—I heard you down there,” I said, my voice trembling.

“No you didn’t,” she snapped back, her face twisted in this awful, vicious expression of anger I’d never seen before. “I’m right here. I was upstairs lying down when I heard you calling for me. There is no one down there.”

“But… but I heard you,” I said, tears starting to prickle my eyes.

She just shook her head and walked away.

For the rest of the day, Grandma sat in the living room, knitting. Every time I passed by the basement door, her eyes followed me. I started to feel incredibly uncomfortable. When I went up to my bedroom to talk to Shireen, I could hear her footsteps outside my door. She was trying to be as quiet as possible—her footsteps were slow and light—but I still heard them.

When I came down for dinner, Grandma was all smiles. She served me a dish of warm lasagna, cheese melty and gooey on top, smelling of garlic and onion. “Thanks,” I said. It felt like she was trying to make amends for yelling at me.

But when I sat down to eat it, she just *stared* at me.

“Aren’t you going to have some?” I asked, hovering the first bite next to my mouth.

“No, it doesn’t fit my diet. This is just for you, Alison,” she replied.

“Ava,” I snapped back.

I set the fork down. This was feeling like all kinds of weird. I stared at my Grandma’s face, a chill going down my spine. Her blue eyes were so intense, so cold. She seemed so… *different…* from three years ago.

“What kind of cake did you make me for my ninth birthday?” I asked.

She tilted her head, staring intently. “I don’t remember, dear.”

“You spent all day on that cake. Of course you remember.”

Her mouth became a thin line. She paused. “I don’t remember.”

“What’s my birthday, then?” I pressed.

She blinked. “It’s… October, isn’t it?”

“September 14th.”

“I’m sorry, dear,” she finally said, breaking eye contact. “I don’t remember things as well as I used to. And I mix up names, and words. It’s not because I don’t love you.”

I stared at her.

And then I forced a fake smile.

“I know, Grandma. I love you.”

Then I got up from the table and started up the stairs.

“You haven’t finished your lasagna, dear!” Grandma’s voice came, from the bottom of the stairs.

“I’m not hungry,” I called back.

I hadn’t taken a single bite.

\*\*\*

“I think my grandma’s a skinwalker,” I whispered into the phone.

Shireen gasped on the other end. “What?”

“She doesn’t remember anything about me. I think she’s keeping my real grandma locked away down in the basement.”

“What?”

“I heard her voice. Calling for help.”

A heavy sigh. Shireen was not the superstitious type. “Are you *sure* you heard her voice from the basement?”

“Yes.”

“What are you going to do?”

“I’m going to go down there,” I replied. “*Tonight.*”

“Maybe you should just wait for your mom to get back.”

“My grandma could be dead by then!”

“Maybe you should call the police.”

“What if my grandma tells them I’m a liar, that I made it all up? Are they going to believe her, or a thirteen year old girl?”

“I still think you shouldn’t go down there.”

“Well, I’m gonna.”

“Okay, well, give me your address or something. If you don’t call me back, I’ll call the police.”

“Good idea.”

I gave her my address, she tried to talk me out of it for another ten minutes, and then I hung up. Then I swung the door open and crept out into the hallway.

Silence. Darkness under Grandma’s (or Not-Grandma’s) door.

I was safe.

I tiptoed down the stairs and walked over to the basement door. Then I waited for a few minutes, to make sure Not-Grandma wasn’t following me.

Silence.

I slowly, quietly, slid the deadbolt. Then I swung the door open, creaking slightly on its hinges. I winced, hoping that didn’t wake her up.

No scuffing sounds. No voice, calling for help.

*Maybe she’s already—*

I swallowed the thought and started down the stairs.

The light didn’t seem to work, but I had my phone with me. The flashlight illuminated each step beneath me. I slowly made my way down—when my feet hit the cold, concrete bottom, I swung the light around.

All the blood drained out of my face.

Sitting on the floor, chained to a support pole, was my grandma. Her head hung limply in front of her, white curls hanging over her face.

“Grandma!” I called, my throat tightening.

*I hope she isn’t already—*

Grandma lifted her head.

The phone fell out of my hands.

Her face. There was something horribly wrong with her face. Pure-white eyes. A wide smile, full of pointed teeth. Skin that seemed to slough off her face in patches, revealing bone beneath.

*No. No, no, no—*

A horrible cracking sound filled the air.

I watched, in horror, as the *thing* transformed. Bones twisted and contorted. The face opened its mouth in a silent scream. And then… I was staring at *myself* chained to the post, white eyes fading to match my brown ones.

It cocked its head.

“Hello,” it said in a voice that matched my own.

I let out a scream.

And then Grandma—real Grandma, from upstairs, not this horrible thing—was grabbing me and shoving me up the stairs. The door slammed shut and I found myself on the floor, panting, looking up at her.

“What did I tell you?! *Don’t go in the basement!”*

“What… Grandma...” I choked out.

She double-checked the door was locked, then led me to the kitchen.

“That *thing* showed up a year ago,” she told me, as she pulled out my leftover, now congealed, piece of lasagna from the fridge. She draped a thin blanket over my shoulders and sat down across from me. “At first, it took the appearance of an old friend of mine. I let it in. I fed it. Not just food,” she said, glancing down at the lasagna in front of me, still uneaten. “It started eating my memories.”

“How…”

“I don’t know how. But I found myself forgetting simple things. Names. Dates. Birthdays. And then one day, I woke up to the thing… looking just like me. I don’t think it was aware that I would not respond well to a person looking exactly like me. I tricked it into the basement by pretending to relive a memory of the basement being a very important place, over and over again. It eventually ‘ate’ that memory, and went down there. I locked it in. With the help of someone I met online, someone who believed me, I was able to chain it to the post. And I’m keeping it there so it can’t hurt anyone else.”

I stared at her.

“If you knew you had this dangerous thing in your basement, why did you let me stay here?”

“I missed you, and I foolishly thought you’d listen to me.”

Scuffling sounds came from beneath us. And then I heard my own voice, reverberating through the floor: *“HELP ME! GET BACK DOWN HERE AND HELP ME!”*

“Will it eat my memories, too?” I whispered.

“No. It needs physical contact for that.”

Our talk was interrupted by three short knocks on the door—and that’s when I realized I never called Shireen back.

And couldn’t, because my phone was at the bottom of the basement stairs, down there with *it.*

“Uh, I’ll take care of this,” I told her, getting up from the kitchen table.

Thankfully, the police bought my tale, and because I didn’t let them in, didn’t hear the clone of me screaming the basement.

Then I used Grandma’s old computer to send Shireen an email.

There’s still the matter of the thing in the basement, of course. But that’s another problem for another day.

For now, I’m going to eat some lasagna, and then go straight to bed.

And Mom was right—
