It started with a late night message I wasn’t expecting.

**Unknown:** *Hey. Been a while.*

I squinted at the screen. The number wasn’t saved in my phone, but something about the message felt uncomfortably familiar.

*Who’s this?* I replied, keeping it short.

The three dots appeared almost immediately.

**Unknown:** *You probably don’t remember me. But I remember you.*

I stared at the screen, my stomach twisting. It wasn’t uncommon to get random texts from guys I’d talked to on apps—old conversations resurfacing after a drunken night of scrolling. But something about this one felt different.

Another message came through.

**Unknown:** *You tapped me on Grindr 13 months ago. You said you liked my dog.*

The words hit like a punch. Memories of a late-night conversation flickered to life. We’d chatted for a week or so, then I’d stopped replying. I didn’t even remember why. Maybe I got busy. Maybe I just wasn’t into it. But he clearly hadn’t forgotten.

*Okay… and?* I typed back, unsure what he wanted.

**Unknown:** *You ghosted me.*

I sighed, guilt bubbling up. This kind of thing happened all the time, didn’t it? People drifted apart. It wasn’t personal.

I started to type an apology, but another message interrupted me.

**Unknown:** *I was really into you.*

My chest tightened as I stared at the words. For a moment, I considered blocking the number and ignoring the whole thing, but the guilt kept my fingers hovering over the keyboard.

*I’m sorry,* I typed back. *I didn’t mean to hurt you.*

The dots appeared again, then vanished.

Before I could process what to say next, my phone buzzed—not a text, but a notification.

**Grindr:** *New message from \[Blank Profile\]*

My blood ran cold. The app had been uninstalled months ago, but somehow it was back on my phone. My thumb hovered over the notification before I reluctantly tapped it.

The profile had no name, no picture—just the outline of a grey avatar and a distance marker: **21 meters away.**

**\[Blank Profile\]:** *That’s a nice apology, but it’s too late for sorry.*

My stomach churned. *Is this you?* I typed.

**\[Blank Profile\]:** *You can’t block me here.*

The distance marker still read **21 meters away.** My pulse raced as I stood up and locked my apartment door. My eyes flicked toward the window. The curtains were open, letting in faint streetlight from outside.

**\[Blank Profile\]:** *Close the curtains if you want, but I’ll still see you.*

I froze. My hands shook as I yanked the curtains shut, then backed away from the window.

*How do you know where I live?* I typed.

*\[Blank Profile\] is typing…*

**\[Blank Profile\]:** *I’ve always known.*

My heart pounded as I deleted the chat and blocked the profile. My breaths came fast and shallow as I sat on the couch, staring at the now-blank chat list.

I should’ve stopped there, but I didn’t.

I reopened Grindr. The profile was back.

Another message appeared.

**\[Blank Profile\]:** *Blocking doesn’t make me disappear. 13 months is a long time to wait.*

The distance marker shifted: **9 meters away.**

I scrambled to pick up my phone, dialling the police with trembling fingers.

“Police. Someone’s stalking me,” I whispered. “They’re outside my building.”

The dispatcher’s calm voice steadied me for a moment. “What’s your address?”

I opened my mouth to respond, but my phone buzzed again.

**\[Blank Profile\]:** *Look outside.*

“No,” I whispered to myself, refusing to obey.

The message came again, this time with a photo.

It was my window. The curtains were drawn, but the photo was taken from the outside, angled toward the light spilling out from underneath.

Tears stung my eyes as I yanked open the curtain an inch.

A figure stood on the sidewalk, staring up at me. He was holding a dog leash, but there was no dog.

“Someone’s outside,” I told the dispatcher, my voice trembling. I recited my address.

“Stay on the line. Officers are on their way.”

The figure didn’t move. He stood there, perfectly still, head tilted slightly as though he were waiting for me to say something.

My phone buzzed again.

**\[Blank Profile\]:** *You owe me more than an apology.*

I stared at the message, barely able to breathe. The figure’s head tilted further, his hand tightening on the leash.

Another buzz. This time, it was the distance marker refreshing. **6 meters away.**

My heart slammed into my ribs as I stumbled backward, my phone clutched tightly in my hand. I turned toward the door, checking the locks again, my fingers fumbling over the deadbolt.

The phone buzzed once more.

**\[Blank Profile\]:** *You shouldn’t hide your spare key in such an obvious place.*

My knees buckled as the words sank in. I’d always meant to find a new secret hiding spot for my key but had never gotten around to it.

When I glanced back at the screen, the marker had updated again: **3 meters away.**

The dispatcher’s voice crackled in my ear. “Stay where you are. Police are close.”

But the distance marker wasn’t done. The final refresh came as a shadow flickered beneath the door.

**0 meters away.**

The locked doorknob rattled violently, the sound sharp in the silence. Then I heard it—the unmistakable click of a key turning in the lock.
