My head still ached from an uneasy night sleeping rough in the bookshop doorway when the Housekeeper approached to offer me a job. A slim man in a brown suit with a gaunt face and greying hair, he spoke with a degree of calmness which I confused for kindness. Living on the streets you get used to people ignoring you, or if they do talk you get used to the disdain. But he didn’t seem judgemental at all. He offered to buy me breakfast and we went to the nearby greasy spoon cafe. I had a full English breakfast, he just had a cup of tea and explained the particulars of his offer. £15 an hour, full time, paid cash-in-hand to do manual work on the house and grounds of the Grimstead castle estate, the picturesque stately home in the countryside just outside of town. There was even accommodation to stay on site if I wished. It was a no brainer. We shook on it there and then.



The Housekeeper (I call him that because I never got his name, he wore a laminated name tag that just said ‘Housekeeper’ in faded lettering) took me by car up to the estate. I was driven through the rolling green hills of the English countryside until we turned off the main road at a black iron gate tipped with gold painted spikes. The Housekeeper got out, unlocked the gate, and drove us through before locking it shut behind him. From the black gate there was a long gravel driveway which cut a straight path through immaculately trimmed grass gardens and led to a large courtyard at the front of Grimstead castle.



It was a house really, the castle that originally sat on top of this hill was long gone, replaced by a grand and imposing limestone Georgian house, arranged with square towers on each corner with crenellations along the roof. Tall windows were symmetrically arranged across its broad front, with black spiked iron railings arranged in their defence. It was the sort of house English aristocrats inherit then complain about how much it costs to maintain. They used to have visitors within the grounds to make some money towards maintenance, I remember coming with my mum when I was a lad, but it all closed up a few years ago, back while I was away with the army.



The Housekeeper drove me up to a small wooden outbuilding filled with gardening tools, had me leave my stuff there and change into a set of red overalls. I noticed some people behind a wall in the distance watching us, but nobody ever came close. He passed me a soft bristled broom and a dustpan and guided me through a door to the side of the house, told me to start sweeping up and shut the door behind me. I expected some kind of tour, or training, at least an introduction and a guide as to where the fire exits were, but I have worked at disorganised places before so it wasn’t too strange. It may be my military background that gives me greater expectations of organisation and preparedness, but let me tell you, any new job that expects you to start work without adequate training is a red flag, run for the hills! Those places will chew you up and spit you out!



I should have ran for the hills.



I started sweeping. I convinced myself that maybe this was a test of my initiative and someone was secretly watching through eye holes cut in one of the large portraits hanging on the walls, like something from a Scooby Doo cartoon. The wooden floor constantly creaked, every step sent a ripple of sound echoing down the corridor. Behind the grand, gold framed paintings, the walls were covered with a faded red fabric which frayed around the edges. The brass light fittings spaced out throughout the corridor were topped with a fine layer of dust, suggesting the place hadn’t had a thorough clean for a while. That’s where I would have got someone cleaning if I were in charge of things. The floor itself seemed a bit dusty around the edges, but there wasn’t really much to sweep up.



I worked my way down the corridor, past a succession of closed white doors, until I came upon an open doorway leading to a large, empty room. It could have been a ballroom once, there was enough space here, but any dancing would have taken place a long time ago. A series of tall windows opposite the entrance illuminated a chandelier of cascading crystal teardrops in the centre of the ceiling, its sparkle dulled with dust. I went in and swept up, the wooden floorboards shuddered and creaked as I moved, then I heard a gentle creaking and a click of closing door. When I turned I noticed the ballroom doorway was closed. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but as I continued to clean up and my dustpan became full I went back to open the door, to find no door at all, just more red fabric covered walls. I doubted myself and must have lost my bearings. I looked around the room and saw the door, but it seemed different, narrower. But I must have been wrong. A poor night’s sleep and this drastic change of scenery must have been playing tricks on my mind.



The ballroom looked clean so I decided to move on, heading out of the doorway and back into the corridor, or so I expected. But the door didn’t lead to the corridor. It led to another room, smaller and windowless. It had various pieces of furniture covered with blankets. They were coated with dust and connected by cobwebs which swayed loosely from the gust of the opened door. I backed out of there and back into the ballroom. I spotted another door I hadn’t noticed before, on the wall adjacent to the windows, so I decided to try that one. It was certainly smaller than the door I had initially entered the ballroom through, but it was my only other option. This led to the corridor, or, a corridor. I noticed the floor was mostly covered in a thin layer of dust, only gently swept clear in the centre where there was a clear trail. It wasn't the same one which I had swept earlier, it didn’t lead to an exterior door like the one I had entered the house through but other white interior doors. I glanced one way up the corridor, then the other, in a flash I thought I saw a man in a brown suit walk around a corner. The Housekeeper.



“Excuse me!” I called out, trying to be heard, but without causing too much noise for anyone I might be disturbing.



Nobody came back. I jogged up the corridor with the broom still in hand, past half a dozen doors to look around the corner, but there was no corner. The corridor ran straight to another closed white door. I tried the handle, but it was locked. All the doors were closed, even the one I had come out from, whichever one that was I couldn’t be sure. I worked my way back down the corridor trying every handle I could, all locked. For an old building the door handles seemed surprisingly solid, the doors didn’t even rattle at all on their hinges as I tried to open them. I know they built things to last back in those times, but for a place that seemed so neglected it felt wrong.



Eventually I found a door that opened, it was on the opposite side to the door I came out of. Or at least, I think it was. I was becoming disorientated and everything felt as if it shifted around me. It felt like back when I would polish off a bottle of vodka and suddenly even basic things became difficult and confusing. But I had been sworn off the stuff now for almost a year. Suddenly this grand old house felt small. I was feeling claustrophobic and increasingly agitated. I started to feel like if the next door didn’t open I would be kicking it down.



I twisted the next doorknob and I felt it give, it turned and clicked, the door opened. Inside the room was bright and I noticed the wooden floor was cleaner than other rooms, the floor was clear of dust and looked almost polished. Some old wooden chairs and a four poster bed were arranged against the wall to the left. Three tall windows dressed with long velvet curtains illuminated the room, long shadows of the black iron railings were cast across the room, and an elderly man stood looking out of the middle window which overlooked the front courtyard. Yes - overlooked, I had gone up at least one floor without ever walking up any stairs. Then I heard a clicking, skittering noise, and a black Labrador appeared skidding to a stop in front of me. The dog watched me, hackles raised, as uncertain of me as I was of him. 



The old man turned to look at me. He wore a flat cap and glasses. His face had a few days of stubble around a grey moustache. “It’s OK, boy.” he said gently to the dog. The Labrador’s demeanour instantly calmed and its tail began to wag cautiously.



I walked up beside the man and asked, “Excuse me, I’m lost. Can you show me the way out?”



“I’m afraid not.” The man said. His dog sniffed around my feet. “I don’t know the way.”



Looking at him closer he looked gaunt. His clothes seemed too big for him, his sleeves hung off thin wrists, the wide collar of his white checked shirt gaped from his neck exposing the pale skin of his chest. “It’s just, I can’t find the way. It’s like the doors are moving…”



“Only the windows don’t move.” He replied. 



“Are you lost too?” I asked.



“No, I'm just waiting.” he said softly, glancing down at the dog. 



I didn’t understand the answer. He didn’t turn away from the window. Outside I couldn’t see anyone. The wind gently swayed the trees that lined the long gravel driveway. The garden was green and lush all the way to the black gate in the distance, yet something was missing from the landscape. It all looked normal but eventually I realised that nothing outside moved beyond the plants in the breeze. There was no wildlife. No deer, no rabbits, no birds. On the distant road beyond the gate a car occasionally drove past.



“Waiting for what?” I asked, “How long have you been here?”



He paused in thought, his brow furrowed, “I’m not sure.”



I walked away towards the door, a new door I thought, as if to momentarily check that this situation was as insane as I thought. I opened it, and beyond was a hallway leading to a sweeping mahogany staircase lined with red carpet descending back to the ground floor. It was tempting to go and explore, but I thought that was what the house wanted. It was trying to lure me away. Maybe it had sent me towards this man to try and sap my hope, to make me become resigned to be adrift in this labyrinth like he was. But I wasn’t trained like that. Escape was worth a try.  I backed away from the door and back towards the old man and his dog.



“I don’t know what the fuck is happening here, but I’m getting out.” I decided aloud, “I’ll go for help. You said the windows don’t move?” The old man looked at me blankly, either unwilling or unable to reply. “Fine.” I said, grabbing a handful of red velvet curtain and pulling it with my whole body weight. The curtain rail broke, dropped on one side and the curtain came loose. I pulled the other curtain loose, then looked out of the window to gauge the drop to the ground. The curtains may not be long enough but it would get me low enough for a survivable jump. 



I tied the two curtains together in a thick reef knot then tried to open the windows. They felt sealed shut and didn’t budge at all. So I picked up one of the heavy and expensive looking dark wooden chairs by the wall and I launched it at the glass which smashed easily. The old man looked at me but he didn’t seem shocked or surprised. The dog however barked with excitement, its tail wagging, and he dashed around me as if he was keen to help. I tied one end of the curtains to the iron railing and checked that everything was secure. Then I tossed over my makeshift rope, climbed over the railing, giving it one last tug to check it would hold me. Satisfied, I began abseiling down. 



I made my way slowly. It was quiet except for the occasional distant roar of a passing car and the shuffling of my boots against the limestone wall. I descended towards another window with black iron railings below. As I got to the top of the window frame I felt the curtain shift above me. It dropped with a sudden jolt, only by a centimetre or two, then again, then finally the railing above gave way. It swung me out, away from the house, then helplessly back towards the window and the iron spiked railings. I had no time to avoid the spikes. One pierced through my left foot before my momentum crumpled my body and sent me crashing through the glass and sprawling on the floor inside. I looked up in a daze to see the old man in his flat cap looking down at me, his dog appeared, licking at my face.



My foot pulsed with pain. I tried to move it and it squelched in my boot, slick with blood. The old man looked at me stupidly, barely seeming to register what had happened. I couldn’t understand it either. He said the windows didn’t move. But the room must have. I fell one floor down yet landed in the same room I had climbed out of. I didn’t know if I had hit my head, or lost too much blood, but nothing was making sense. I pulled myself up on the curtain, the curtain which was still in place despite being pulled down just minutes ago, and I hopped over to look through the smashed open window. The makeshift abseil rope still dangled from the railings on the floor above, railings which were still fixed securely after I thought I had pulled them completely from the wall. I looked at the courtyard below and I was closer than before. I had gone down a floor level, but the house inside had followed me down.



I looked over to the door I had opened earlier, it was still open, enticing me to leave via the sweeping carpeted staircase. I resisted the temptation of an easy descent, choosing instead to return to the window. The courtyard below was mostly gravel with a ring of grass surrounding an old stone fountain at the centre. Directly beneath there was some kind of narrow trench around the bottom of the building with a grey stone border separating the gravel of the courtyard and a dark drop six to eight feet below the ground, some windows were set in the walls beneath ground level. This gap was only a couple of feet wide, so I had no concerns about being able to clear it, even with one injured foot. 



Then I heard footsteps. Hard leather heels clicking on a polished wooden floor. The footsteps echoed throughout the room and grew steadily louder. The old man looked away from the window, facing the door, afraid.



“Who’s coming?” I asked him. 



His lips trembled, eventually the words came. “The Housekeeper.” The old man shuffled across the room and into the corner. The dog followed him. Both cowered like they had been scalded by the Housekeeper before, and never wanted to suffer that again. I wasn’t so easily intimidated. Even with one foot in agony I fancied that I could grab him by his scrawny throat and have him lead me out the front door. In case he was armed I quickly smashed a chair against the wall so I could use a leg as a club if it came to it.



I pulled down another curtain as the heels clicked their way closer, just one would have to do this time. I hobbled over, tied it to the railing and threw the rest over the edge. It didn’t reach the ground but it would have to do. If it came to it I’d be wary of the railing giving way this time, it won't catch me by surprise and break my grip, hopefully. Even if it did I wouldn’t have too much of a fall and I would be out, unless the house was able to pull any other tricks on me.



The footsteps approached the door then came to a stop. I waited for the Housekeeper while the old man cowered in the corner, away from the solace of his unmoving window, his black dog stood by him. I checked the grip on my chair leg club and moved to the doorway so when the confrontation came, I could try and seize the initiative. 



“Yes, yes.” I heard the Housekeeper say dismissively to someone unseen. He came around the corner and stopped in the doorway, looking at me in silence the way a disappointed parent looks at a child who had failed to tidy their bedroom. I stood with blood trailing from my pierced foot, wielding a chair leg and ready to fight.



I broke the momentary silence, “Show me the way out, now, or I’ll kill you.” I twirled the chair leg in my hand to emphasise my threat. He seemed completely unconcerned.



“That would not please the Lady of the house.” The Housekeeper said, looking past me at the ruined curtains and smashed windows. “You have already made enough of a mess.” 



“I’m serious!” I replied, “I’ll kill you. You wouldn’t be the first, and they deserved it less than you!”



He finally looked me in the eye, I think he started to take me seriously but he didn’t seem afraid. He took a slow deliberate step backwards, out of the doorway, then the door slammed shut. I lunged forward and pulled the door open instantly, but the Housekeeper was gone. The staircase had gone, replaced by another long corridor lined with doorways. I looked up and down it while taking care to keep my body in the windowed room hoping that would stop it changing on me, but saw no sign of him. I turned back into the room and a gloom had descended. The old man had retaken his place in front of the window, looking out at a darkening sky. The black Labrador came over to me, watching me curiously.



“I’m getting out of here.” I announced. “Are you coming?”



It was a big dog, but I thought I could carry it as I climbed down. I tested the strength of the curtain and the railing I had tied it to, climbed over, then picked up the dog under its front legs. I climbed down carefully, rappelling from the wall of the house. Then I began to feel the curtain drop. I looked up and saw the railings coming loose from their fixings on the wall, as it must have done on the floor above. In the low light I thought I could see the black painted bolts unscrew themselves. I looked down, and we didn’t have much further to go to reach the ground, maybe ten feet. Below was the deep trench that bordered the front of the house, but we dangled over the ground-level gravel of the courtyard. I lowered myself a bit more, watching the railings above for any sign they would give. When I saw the black iron shudder, I let go. As I had hoped, I dropped straight down over the gravel with only about six feet to fall. I braced myself for impact, holding the dog to my chest so he at least would be able to have a soft landing. I bent at the knees, preparing to roll when I hit the floor as I had once been trained to do with a parachute. I heard a swoosh of what I thought must be wind, but later realised it was a wave of gravel being pushed away from the house. When my feet hit the ground I landed on stone at a steep angle. I fell to the side and saw the trench had opened up beneath me like a gaping mouth before my head thumped the stone. The dog jumped free of my arms. I lost consciousness to the sound of grinding stone, sliding into darkness.



I awoke to the echoes of rhythmic wet slaps. My mind was spinning, probably from both the fall, and the blood that had been oozing from my foot, so I couldn’t quite place the sound. My eyes opened to darkness, slowly adjusting to a dim light flickering at the end of a corridor. The light glistened off damp stone walls. I thought the slaps were footsteps, but they seemed too fast and they never got closer or further away. Eventually the slapping slowed and ended with a distant sigh. At the end of a corridor a gaunt silhouette appeared, adjusting his belt around his narrow waist. Footsteps clicked down the corridor towards me then stopped for a moment.



“Are you awake?” The Housekeeper asked.



I didn’t reply, partly because my senses hadn’t fully returned, and partly through fear. He continued to walk towards me, then around to my feet. He grabbed the stretcher that I laid on and rotated it around to wheel me down the corridor and towards the room he came from. I felt bindings securing my wrists and ankles. I peeked out to see the light  growing and we entered a windowless room with an ancient vaulted ceiling made from large dark stone blocks from which I could see just the bottom of faded red banners hanging from the ceiling.



“Here, my lady.” The Housekeeper said. He paused for a moment, then as if responding to a silent question he said, “No, he’s still alive. I know that is how you prefer them.”



I ventured to open my eyes slightly and look around the room. It was sparsely furnished, on one side I saw the edge of a filthy bed on a rusted metal frame, and the other was an old wooden writing cabinet coated in dust. On the desk was a machine, like a typewriter but without any paper, unfolded from its black case, brass keys glittered in the light of a nearby oil lamp, and above the keys a series of small circular windows displaying letters. Beside it an old radio which seemed untouched in years judging by the dust, let out a gentle fizz of static from its speaker.



The Housekeeper stood at the foot of my bed, his back to me, talking to someone I couldn’t see. Muttering then pausing for a response that never seemed to come. Then I heard him say, “Would you like to see?”



He came around to my head and grabbed the stretcher near my shoulders. The Housekeeper stunk like a teenager’s bedroom, of cigarettes, mouldy clothes and unwashed semen. I was turned so she could see me, and I could see her. 



The Lady of the house looked at me, small eyes set within deep black sockets glinted in the lamplight. She was impossibly old. Her face was carved by wrinkles like deep rivulets scored into a pallid landscape. Thin grey hair ran in wisps from her scalp so fine that it seemed to float in the still air of her chamber. She reclined on a bed, her lower half beneath a clean bedsheet, laying slightly upright so she looked down upon me on the stretcher. She wore a thin grey gown around her shoulders, stained and rotten over time, possibly because it seemed impossible to remove. Her arms were thin cords that almost seemed tangled and gnarled like the roots of a tree and at the shoulder they had twisted and grown like roots, spreading around her bed and slipping within the cracks between the stone blocks on the walls. Her skin looked hard and dry like the bark of a silver birch yet it writhed and twitched showing its softness. Her whole body seemed painfully pinned to the bed by the growths anchoring her to the stones of this old house, the bed trapped beneath her like how a root or branch will slowly envelop anything in its way. She looked dead, but forced to live through whatever unnatural thing that sprouted from her. 



The Housekeeper spoke, breaking my stunned horrified inspection of the Lady’s twisted form, “It is a rare honour to meet the Lady of the house in person. Few guests survive to this point, but you have been unusually persistent.”



A thousand questions flowed through my mind and almost came out of my mouth at once. Then in that moment, what was possibly the least important question shot out, driven by anger. My rage at being trapped, reliving the trauma of being ambushed in Afghanistan. I wanted to hurt him. Humiliate him. “That sound… have you been fucking that thing!?”



The Housekeeper froze, shocked, offended, and a bit embarrassed. The house above rumbled and the dark walls around us flexed gently. He instinctively adjusted the front of his belt as if I had caught him with his pants quite literally down. “Tone down your language.” he tried to say calmly, but his voice quavered. “This doesn’t have to be painful for you, but I can ensure that it is. Your compliance is recommended.”



“What is going on?” I hoped to ask in a more commanding tone, but it sounded more like I was begging, pleading for mercy.



“A blood debt must be paid.” The Housekeeper replied, “It’s nothing personal, we all have our part to play, this is yours.”



He walked over to a dark wooden cabinet, slid open a drawer and pulled out a bundle of cloth. He placed the cloth on top of the cabinet and unrolled it to reveal an array of metal instruments. He picked up a tube with a thin metal needle on the end. 



“A blood debt? You actually need my blood?” I asked. “For her? Whatever skin care routine she’s got going on isn’t working!”



“Not for her.” The Housekeeper replied, irritated. He continued, attaching the tube to a glass jar, “The blood is merely the currency to pay for the agreement made eighty-six years ago now. The blood is for the void, and in return the void protects the Lady, and her house. We’ll keep you for as long as your blood still flows. You should prove a good investment.”



As he spoke I tried to wriggle free of my thick leather bindings. There was some play in my right wrist which gave me hope. He kept working with his needle and jar, and I was keen to keep him distracted. “86 years ago?” I asked. “That was…”



“1938.” he said with a smile. “Difficult times for everyone.  Her sons were already killed fighting in the war. The Lady wanted protection, for her and her house. Who wouldn’t?” The Housekeeper kneeled, then I heard a clink of keys and rattling metal, which turned out to be the removal of a padlock from a trapdoor beneath. Once the wooden trapdoor was opened warm air surged up into the chamber. I turned to look, and I could see the deep blackness of the pit. The Lady twisted slowly on her bed, creaking like a tree in a breeze, her gaping lips turned slowly upwards into a satisfied grin.



The Housekeeper watched me struggle, and seemed so confident in his bindings that he made no effort to stop me. “Crisis can lead to wonderful opportunities. On the outbreak of the war the Lady sought to make a bunker of the old cellars beneath the house and uncovered this chamber, and the pit. They sought refuge from the evil around them, but found salvation, sadly too late for her boys. In the pit is the void, and the void called out to her, offering protection in exchange for-”



“Blood.” I finished. “So she is willing to sacrifice me, and god knows how many others to be… this!?” I waved a bound hand at the Lady of the house, laying on her bed, bound by the disgusting growths that had woven themselves amongst the cracks between the stones at the foundations of the house.



“To be eternal!” he smiled, “She is one with the house and both are safe. You are a price she is willing to pay to maintain that.” The Housekeeper said with a sly smile.



I had managed to squirm my right hand within its bindings to a point where I thought one last pull may get me free. The Housekeeper approached with his needle in hand and began to roll up my sleeve. I looked upwards at the ceiling where the grimy red banners hung down and caught a glimpse of a white emblem in the middle, at its centre I glimpsed a black right angle. Then I realised.



“1938?” I asked, “Wait… who did she want protection from? Who did her sons fight for?”



The Housekeeper just smiled. I let him push the needle into the artery, hoping that he wouldn’t notice the loosened leather straps at my wrist. He didn’t. As soon as he turned away to check that my blood dripped into the jar I suddenly jerked my arm to pull it through the binding. Once I had my right hand free I thought I could release myself, but that last pull against the strap partially dislocated my wrist. My right hand was free, but felt limp. I immediately reached over to my left hand to undo the leather strap but I had no strength, my fingers fumbled with the metal buckle, struggling desperately to loosen it.



Then the Housekeeper saw me. He turned, saw my free hand, then with an almost animalistic cry he wailed, “NO! No! No!” 



He grabbed my free arm. I had fought for my life before. I had shot at point blank range. I had fixed a bayonet. No pain or injury would stop me. I couldn’t make a fist, but I still had a club of a forearm to swing at him, thumping it across the bridge of his nose. He fell back, his eyes watered and his nose bled. For a moment I hoped he was sent sprawling into the pit, but he stumbled a metre or so clear, back into a bedside table and knocked one of the lamps over and its light guttered out. I sat up as much as I could and leaned over to release my left arm, now barely visible with the light of just one remaining lamp. The Lady watched me, her expression frozen in anguish, the walls of the chamber shuddered. My numb fingers worked at the buckle and had just started to lever it open. Then the Housekeeper appeared over me, slamming his hand down over my fight hand and the buckle. A searing pain shot up my arm and I screamed. 



In what I thought was a moment or delirium, I saw from the darkness of the far side of the chamber two pale lights appear, floating low in the void. For a moment in my agony I thought that whatever thing was living in the pit had arisen, the void itself coming to claim its debt directly. The eyes moved closer. Then I heard a snarl and saw a glimmer of spittle shoot out. The eyes shot forward and a black flash leapt up at the Housekeeper. The black labrador's large paws pushed him to the ground and bit at the arms he raised in defence, tearing at his brown sleeves.



I hurried to loosen my left arm again and worked the buckle open. I pulled the tube from my arm, and threw it away, the needle skittered across the floor and down the pit. An appetiser for the void at least, but I wasn’t going to be a full meal. Not today. I sat up and was able to release the bindings on my ankles while the dog fought the Housekeeper on the floor. Then I heard the dog yelp and it scrambled away. I looked around but in the dim light I couldn’t see the Housekeeper or the dog. I hopped off the bed, suddenly reminded of the pain in my pierced foot.



I stumbled over towards the desk with the strange typewriter to grab the lamp that sat on top of it and turned to scan the room. I couldn’t see him. The Lady of the house creaked in her bed, the walls rumbled, shuddering like the building was nervous. Shadows danced across the chamber as I turned, trying to spot where the housekeeper was hiding. Even amongst the shadows, the sheer darkness of the pit stood out, blacker than black. So did the dog. I saw it standing by the wall to my left. 



“Come on boy.” I said, “Let's get out of here.”



I started to limp across to him when I felt my left leg being grabbed and a sharp stabbing pain in my thigh. I brought the lamp down and saw the Housekeeper laying on the floor where he had crawled out from under the Lady’s bed. His gaunt face looked up with ferocious intensity, his hand still on the scalpel he embedded in my leg, “The debt must be paid.” he snarled through gritted teeth, then started to pull the scalpel down my thigh, slicing through muscle. 



Out of instinct I punched down at him with my right hand, ignorant of my injured wrist. The punch was enough to send him sprawled on the floor, but he kept hold of the scalpel. I recoiled my fist in pain and fell back against the desk, my left hand fumbling for balance as it landed on the heavy typewriter-like machine, I now think it was some type of decoding machine, in glass windows some message was displayed, something which I later translated as ‘Immediate readiness’. I grabbed the machine pulling a wire from the wall with it, brass letters, including some german characters glinted in the gloom as I threw it down at the Housekeeper. The heavy machine glanced off his forehead with a crack before clattering across the floor. Then I dropped on him, grabbing his knife hand with my left, then proceeded to drive my right elbow into his face. I don’t know how many times I hit him, but I hit him until he stopped moving. He lay still on his back, facing upwards, gargling on his own blood. His mouth agape as if impersonating the Lady he served. He faintly said in stilted, garbled breaths, “The debt… must… be paid.”



“Pay the debt yourself.” I told him, as I kicked out my good leg, and pushed at him, edging him across the floor until he fell limply over the edge of the pit, and down into the void.



The chamber shuddered, the walls started to shake violently. From between the cracks in the dark stone blocks the roots which sprouted from the Lady began to reach out towards me slowly and desperately, in a futile effort to defend herself. It seemed whatever ability she had to move walls and doors wasn’t present amongst the stone blocks of this ancient chamber. Beside the desk was a small tin of lamp oil and a box of matches. I unscrewed the oil lid, dumped it on the blankets which covered the Lady, then lit a match and tossed it on the bed. The flames took hold and the dog rushed over to me. He led me away down a dark corridor, away from the room where I had been kept earlier, which curved around in an ascending spiral before reaching a stairwell. Smoke followed us up.



The stairs rose into a basement storage room littered with stacks of chairs and a long table coated in dust. The house shook more violently up here. Dust rose from the furniture like steam. We hurried up more stairs until we reached the ground floor of the house, coming out in a dining room illuminated by morning light through tall windows. The dog led me towards a large door which suddenly moved before my eyes, then flickered back, as if the Lady was struggling to maintain her illusions anymore. When the door appeared back in place we dashed through. 



I could see slick wet patches on the dog’s black fur, on one side I saw bright pink gash in its rear leg, and it left faint bloody pawprints across the white marble floor of the reception hall and towards the front door. The house shuddered and plaster rained down from the ceiling as cracks appeared in the walls, then the cracks began to fill with flame. The Lady’s roots permeated the whole structure of the house, and now she burned. The house still moved, but not with the deftness and purpose it had when I first entered. Now it convulsed, writhing in the agony of the fire. Doors flung open, splintering as they slammed against their frames. Walls twisted and buckled, chunks of wood and plaster fell from crumbling ceilings, and floorboards curved up like spasming fingers. Yet the black dog refused to leave.



He turned away from the front door, sniffing the increasingly smokey air, then followed a scent up the sweeping mahogany staircase. I called him back but he ignored me, then I realised he was looking for his master. I followed up the stairs but I had lost a lot of blood, my foot and thigh were in agony, and I barely made any progress before the dog returned, tugging on his confused master's sleeve and leading him to the stairs. He saw me stood beneath him and froze, staring, trying to figure out what had happened to me. To be fair to him, I must have looked a right state.



“Come on mate, we need to go.” I called out to him, “there’s been a fire.”



He started walking down the stairs and replied, “Oh, terrible news.” and he continued slowly down the stairs.



When we made it to the thick dark wooden front doors they seemed strained, holding themselves shut. They bowed and creaked with the effort, relented, then strained again. The reception hall started to fill with smoke, and the flaming cracks spread across the walls around us. I tried the door handles, but they didn’t turn, as if someone on the other side was trying to hold them shut. But as I kept trying, the resistance weakened. Then the house seemed to sigh, the walls bulged then sank like an exhaling chest, and the doorhandle turned. I flung the door open and pushed the old man out before the flames or the house could lash out at us. 



The dog and I led the man up the long gravel driveway that led out towards the main road and safely away from the burning house. Behind us smoke billowed from the collapsing roof and flames licked out of the upstairs windows of the once stately home. When he looked back the old man seemed sad.



“Oh, how terrible.” He said softly, “So sad for the family.”



“Nah.” I replied, “I heard they were Nazis.”



“Oh.” the old man said in deep thought, “How terrible.”



Overcome with weakness I sat on the gravel once we made it to the padlocked black gates beside the road and passed out. I didn’t hear the fire engines arrive, and I don’t remember being picked up by the ambulance. I write this in the hospital, waiting for the police to return. I told them the truth when they first visited, I don’t really have anything to lose. I can’t blame them if they think I had some manic episode and burned the place down while hallucinating about some bloke fucking a supernatural nazi tree-lady in her symbiotic house of illusion. But I wanted to get my account of events out in public. Not for my sake, but because even if the Lady of the house died, under the burned wreckage of Grimstead castle the pit remains, and something terrible lies within.
