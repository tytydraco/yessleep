I stepped inside, the door creaking shut behind me with a finality that sent a cold shiver down my spine. The air was thick with dust, a musty smell that clung to my skin, mingling with something else something foul. The lights flickered, casting erratic shadows on the walls, which seemed to close in on me with every step.

The floorboards creaked underfoot, groaning in protest as I made my way through the small hallway. The walls were covered in peeling wallpaper, yellowed and stained, as if the house had been abandoned for years yet there was no sign of decay, no sign of time passing at all. Everything felt frozen, suspended in the air, as if I had stepped into some place that existed outside of time.

The silence was oppressive, like a blanket smothering my every breath. Every step I took echoed too loudly, bouncing off the walls and magnifying my anxiety. I glanced over my shoulder, half-expecting to see something lurking just beyond the doorway, but nothing followed.

A strange, guttural sound suddenly filled the air low, like the growl of an animal, but distorted, almost human. I froze, my heart leaping into my throat. Was it the sheep? Was it something worse?

The light flickered once more, casting a fleeting shadow across the hallway. The temperature seemed to drop, the air growing thicker, colder. And then, a soft rustling sound a dragging noise, like something scraping across the floor came from somewhere deeper in the house.

I tried to move, but my legs were rooted to the spot, as if the house itself was holding me in place. The walls seemed to breathe, pulsing gently, and the floor beneath my feet felt... wrong. Unstable. Like it was alive.

Then, from the darkness ahead, a shape emerged.

At first, I thought it was a man a tall, gaunt figure, its back hunched unnaturally, its arms hanging too low at its sides. Its skin was pale, sickly, stretched tight over bone. The thing’s eyes were wide and vacant, black as coal, gleaming in the dim light. Its face was contorted, too wide, its mouth too large, filled with jagged teeth that gleamed in the flickering light.

It stopped just short of me, its breathing slow and shallow, like it was savoring my fear. The silence in the house was now broken by the wet, raspy sound of its breath, a horrible noise that made my skin crawl. It tilted its head, as though studying me, the way a predator eyes its prey.

I backed away instinctively, but the thing didn't move at least not in the way I expected. It was like the creature was floating, gliding across the floor, its limbs twitching, snapping into strange angles, too quick, too jerky. One moment it was in front of me, and the next, it was standing just behind me, its breath hot on my neck.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry, my heart pounding in my chest. The air was thick now, suffocating, and I realized I was gasping for breath. Get out. I have to get out.

I turned to run, but the house itself seemed to shift, the walls warping, the hallway stretching impossibly long. I stumbled, disoriented, as the thing laughed a sound so deep, so guttural, it felt like it came from the earth itself. The walls around me pulsed, the house closing in as if it were alive, feeding off my fear.

The sheep’s distant bleats faded as I sprinted down the hallway, but the creature’s laughter followed me, echoing through the house like a curse. I was trapped. There was no escape.

I reached for the door the door I came through but when my hand touched the handle, it was cold, slick with something wet. The door wouldn’t open. I pulled harder, but it wouldn’t budge. The thing was right behind me now, so close I could hear the wet drag of its feet on the floor, the sharp, broken gasps of its breath as it closed in.

I turned to face the creature, my back pressed to the door, but the terrifying shape was gone. In its place stood something far worse a black sheep.

My heart nearly stopped. This wasn't just any sheep. I had seen it befor back in the field when the herd had scattered, its wool a pitch-black contrast to the purity of the white sheep. The black sheep.

The oppressive weight of Rule 7 crashed down on me like a thunderclap. “There are only white sheep in the village. If at any moment you notice a sheep with black wool, you are in danger. If you don't get it away from the herd before night comes, you won't reach the village.”


The black sheep stared at me with those hollow eyes, its presence suffocating. I felt the room grow colder, the shadows thickening like they were closing in, trapping me here with it. Its eyes, black as coal, glowed faintly in the dim light of the house. Its slow, deliberate movements made my legs shake.

I backed away instinctively, but the sheep moved with me, its head tilting ever so slightly, following my every movement. The air became thick, and the shadows seemed to swirl in unnatural ways, almost as if they were alive. My chest tightened, and my breathing grew shallow. I could feel my heartbeat in my throat, loud and erratic.

The sheep took another step forward, its grin widening far too wide for a creature like that. Its mouth stretched in an unnatural way, revealing sharp, jagged teeth. "You shouldn't have come inside," it whispered, its voice low and cruel, like nails scraping against the walls of my mind.

The house around me seemed to distort, the corners of the room darkening as though being swallowed whole by the shadows. The sheep’s presence seemed to make the walls breathe, closing in with every step it took toward me.

I wanted to scream. To run. But I couldn't. I had broken the rule.

I could feel the house itself beginning to shift, twisting in ways that didn't make sense. The black sheep's eyes never left mine, its unsettling grin widening even further, and the walls seemed to press against me like they were going to swallow me whole.

I could feel the house breathing, alive with the darkness that surrounded me. I couldn't breathe. The shadows closed in on me, suffocating, and then… everything went black.


The oppressive darkness swallowed everything, and I couldn't breathe. The black sheep's eyes glowed brighter, its smile stretching even further as it advanced. I backed away slowly, panic clawing at my chest, but the walls of the house seemed to shift and contract, pushing me further into the corner. I was trapped.

But then, something some instinct, a tiny glimmer of hope pushed through the fear. I remembered Rule 7: "If you don't get the black sheep away from the herd before night comes, you won't reach the village."

But I had failed. I had broken the rule, and now there was no escaping the consequences. Or was there?

I reached down, fumbling for the staff I had dropped earlier. My hands trembled, my vision blurred with fear, but I knew I had to act. As the black sheep took another step toward me, I swung the staff at it, shouting, “Stay back!”

The moment the staff made contact with the sheep, the room seemed to shudder, the shadows recoiling for a brief moment. I didn’t stop, swinging again, this time with everything I had. The sheep hesitated, its glowing eyes flickering for the first time. For a split second, it seemed almost… vulnerable.

That’s when I saw it an opening. The door. It was ajar, just a crack, and the outside world seemed to beckon me. Without thinking, I rushed toward it, adrenaline fueling every desperate step.

The black sheep let out a low, guttural growl, and the shadows surged after me, but I didn’t stop. I dove through the door, feeling the cold air hit my face, the night’s chill wrapping around me like a blanket.

I glanced back as I sprinted into the field, the house behind me warping and twisting in the darkness, but the sheep its grin now a twisted, distant memory didn't follow. The village was still far off, but I didn't care.

I ran without looking back, my legs burning from the exhaustion, my breath ragged as I pushed myself harder. The village wasn’t too far now, or so I thought, but the night was pressing in around me like a weight, every step making it harder to breathe, harder to stay focused.

The cold air from the house still clung to my skin, its oppressive darkness lingering in my mind. I could still feel the presence of that black sheep, the memory of its hollow, glowing eyes following me, even though I knew it wasn’t there anymore.

But I couldn’t shake the fear. I had broken Rule 7. I had failed. And I had no idea what that meant for me.

I glanced over my shoulder. The field behind me was quiet, eerily still, as though the very air was holding its breath. My heart pounded in my chest as I forced my legs to move faster. The shadows around me seemed to stretch and reach for me, as if the night itself were coming alive, closing in.

Then, just as I thought I was free, the familiar shape of the sheep herd appeared in front of me, standing in a perfect line across the path. Their blank eyes were locked on me. The white wool gleamed eerily in the moonlight, the peaceful grazing now replaced with an unsettling stillness.

I froze, my pulse racing. Something was wrong. The air seemed to thicken once more, and the sheep too quiet, too motionless stared into the depths of my soul.

They weren’t just sheep anymore. They were something else. I could feel the weight of their gaze like a judgment. They knew what I had done. They knew that I had broken the rules.

Then, one of the sheep took a step forward. Its wool shimmered for a moment, and before my eyes, it began to change, to distort, the once innocent face twisting into something far darker. A human-like smile formed at the edge of its mouth, too wide, too twisted to be real. Its eyes locked with mine, glowing faintly, almost mocking.

I stumbled back, my breath coming in shallow gasps. I could hear the sound of the others shifting around me, their quiet bleats morphing into something more like whispers, voices that I couldn’t quite understand but that felt threatening nonetheless.

"You broke the rules," the transformed sheep whispered, its voice echoing in my mind. "Now there's no going back."

A chill ran down my spine as I turned, my feet moving before I could even think. I ran, but the sheep followed me, their presence hanging over me like a storm cloud. I had to get to the village. I had to make it back, or whatever this was would consume me.

As I approached the village, the familiar sights should’ve been a relief, but instead, they only made my skin crawl. The houses stood like silent sentinels, their windows dark and cold.

I wanted to tell myself that everything would be fine now that I had survived the worst. But a creeping suspicion gnawed at me. I wasn’t sure if it was the fear of what I had done, breaking the rules, or something else something deeper.

As I neared the village square, I saw figures moving in the shadows villagers watching me from doorways and windows. Their eyes weren’t filled with sympathy or relief, but cold, calculating curiosity. They knew. They had to know what I had done.

I walked past the well, where a small group of people had gathered. One of them, an older man with a gaunt face, stepped forward. His eyes never left mine.

"You broke the rule," he said, his voice barely more than a whisper.

I froze. "What... what are you talking about?"

His smile was slow, like he already knew the answer. "The black sheep. You failed. And now, you must face the consequences."

Before I could respond, another villager, a woman this time, stepped into view. Her face was expressionless, but her eyes betrayed a deep, unsettling understanding of what had happened. "You didn't just break the rules, you stepped into the darkness. And now, the darkness has claimed you."

I tried to back away, but it was too late. The villagers closed in, surrounding me. The fear was suffocating now, the realization that I was never meant to leave the fields alive. They had always known the cost. They were all complicit, all part of the same twisted cycle. And I had just become another piece in it.

As the villagers closed in, their cold eyes staring at me, I knew that escape was no longer a choice. I had done everything wrong. But then just as I was about to succumb to whatever fate they had planned for me a loud, frantic bleating broke through the silence. My heart raced as I looked up.

The sheep.

They had come. But these were not the docile animals I had seen before. Their eyes gleamed with an unnatural hunger, their bodies moving in eerie unison as they stampeded toward the village. The ground shook beneath their hooves, the bleating turning into an overwhelming cacophony of terror.

The villagers froze. The look on their faces shifted, from smug satisfaction to an almost primal fear. They knew what was coming.

I watched, helpless, as the first of the sheep reached the outskirts of the village. It rammed into one of the villagers with terrifying force, knocking them to the ground. The others followed, flooding the streets like an unstoppable tide. The villagers tried to scatter, but they were no match for the relentless force of the sheep.

And then, something worse happened. As the sheep tore through the village, they didn’t just attack they absorbed. I saw one villager, screaming, their body being swallowed whole by the flock. The sheep didn’t eat them; they became them. The figure that emerged from the chaos was something… different. Twisted. The villagers weren’t dying they were merging, becoming part of the herd in a horrific new form.

I stumbled back, my pulse pounding in my ears. I had to get out. This was no longer just about survival it was about escaping a nightmare that had no end.

I turned and ran, not knowing where my legs were taking me, just that I needed to get far away from this madness. As I fled, I could hear the chaos behind me the screams of the villagers, now joined with the relentless bleating of the sheep. The ground seemed to tremble beneath my feet with each thunderous step the herd took. I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. All that mattered was getting out.

The village was fading behind me, swallowed by the flood of twisted sheep and distorted villagers. The last thing I saw was the church, its doors wide open, as if inviting the darkness inside. I pushed myself harder, my chest burning, my legs aching. But I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t let them get me.

I ran through the fields, my heart racing, the night closing in around me. And then, just as I reached the edge of the woods, I dared to glance over my shoulder one last time.

What I saw froze me in place.

In the distance, where the village used to be, the now-destroyed villagers twisted and deformed by the sheep were kneeling. Their bodies were bent in unnatural ways, their faces twisted into grotesque expressions of worship. And before them, standing like a dark god amidst the chaos, was the black sheep.

It stood tall, its eyes glowing with an unnatural light. The villagers no, the herd were bowing to it, their bodies contorting as if in reverence. They were part of it now, no longer human, but something far darker.

The realization hit me like a wave: the cycle had always been the same. The village had never been real. It was all just a twisted game, a sacrifice to the sheep. And now, it was my turn to join them.

But I was free.

I turned my back on the village, and I ran into the darkness of the woods, knowing that the nightmare would never stop chasing me. The sheep had claimed their prize, and I had managed to escape for now.
