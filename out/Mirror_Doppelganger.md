I’d finally scraped enough money to leave my parents’ place. Between them charging my rent and my dad constantly berating my laziness, despite me working a combined total of sixty hours a week, it was a welcome change of pace. It didn’t take long for me to realize I would be met with new struggles. These came namely in the form of my roommate, Barney. If he wasn’t coming home three sheets to the wind, he was getting fired from different jobs over petty reasons.  
  
  
In short, he was as far from a people person as one could get. That left me to deal with the majority of the expenses. The silver lining to this is the brief period he was working allowed me time to seek better job opportunities.  I still had to juggle several jobs, but at least things weren’t as stressful or so I thought. If there’s anything I’ve learned in the service industry it’s that some mother fuckers need to be punched in the face.  
  
  
Of course, if I did that I’d be short on employment. Then I’d either have to move back in with my parents or see if any of my friends, who live several states away would agree to let me crash. Even if they did, I didn’t have the means to get to them, not with my junk heap of a car. Therefore, all I could do was get by and hope the shitty-ass economy would one day improve. Expenses didn’t leave me much surplus income and I was trying to hold back money for emergencies.  
  
  
I held onto every penny. However, even my frugality had its limits. One day, I decided to treat myself or as close to it as I could afford.  I visited the local thrift store to find something to spruce up my room. I spent half an hour or so browsing. Not seeing anything, I got ready to leave until I happened upon a full-body mirror.   
  
  
Its frame was carved with gargoyle faces. After inspecting it and not finding even a scratch, I wonder who’d give something like this away.  I should have noticed something was wrong when I first picked it up. I smiled into it and then glanced away. Some kid was throwing a tantrum over a teddy bear.   
  
  
From my peripheral, I could’ve sworn my reflection was still grinning. However, when I was once again focusing on it, all appeared to be normal. Shrugging this off, I made my purchase and headed home. Another reason I wanted the mirror in my room was I didn’t trust my roommate. He once got so drunk he tried to fist-fight the bathroom mirror.   
  
  
This incident resulted in me having to brush my teeth while staring at a web of cracks. Somehow, I didn’t think we’d be getting back our deposit. With the mirror under my arm, I went to my room. Passing my roommate on the way, I overheard him trying to hook up with a girl. He was on voice chat and told her he was making six figures and had a six-pack.  
  
  
In addition to his trouble holding a job, he was about a hundred pounds overweight and rarely showered.  Once in my room, I turned the lights on and then spent time deciding where to put the mirror.  After some time, I settled on hanging it from the wall near the foot of my bed. Tired from a long day and with another ahead of me, I did my nightly bathroom routine and crashed.  A loud knock woke me up in the middle of the night.  
  
  
I was already stressing about having to work another twelve-hour shift. This did not help matters. Thinking my roommate was up to some horse shit again, I got up to confront him. Upon getting to his room, though, I saw that his door was cracked. Peeking in showed me beer bottles were covering his floor.    
  
  
He was fast asleep with a bottle of lotion and a box of tissues next to him.  Scrunching my face at the smell and the yellow stain on his boxers, I closed the door.    
  
  
“Where is that noise coming from then?” I wondered.  
  
  
I went back to my room and listened again.  Silence met me and I thought that was the end of the matter. I climbed back into bed and was eventually on the verge of dozing off. Then the knock happened again. My eyes flew open and I kicked my covers off.   
  
  
Now beyond pissed off, I set out to search for whatever was causing this and smash it with my own two hands. It repeated, growing steadily louder. I followed it and to my confusion, realized it was coming from my mirror.  
  
  
“What the hell?” I murmured.  
  
  
I didn't have any explanation as to how this was happening, but the mirror trembling indicated it was indeed the case. I could make out my reflection under the moonlight. I didn't notice anything off about it and touched my fingers to the glass. When I did, my reflection went from matching my expression to suddenly grinning ear to ear. Freaked the fuck out, I attempted to back away only to realize my hand was somehow stuck.  
  
I tried in vain to pull it back. Instead, it went into the mirror as if it were liquid. The next thing I knew, my reflection was grabbing my wrist and yanking me in. All I could do was scream with a mixture of confusion and terror as I was flung to the ground. The space I was now in was incomprehensible.   
  
  
  
Different objects expanded endlessly under a pulsating void. As I was trying to find some rationale in all this, demonic cackling came from behind me. I spun around to see someone who was the spitting image of me except evil and I knew he was evil because he had a goatee.  
  
  
“What’s going on? What is this place?” I demanded to know.  
  
“This is the place of things that have yet to be and never were. It’s also where you’ll be…Forever!”  
  
  
I still didn’t know what the fuck was happening. All I know is that I wanted out of there. Behind my doppelganger, I could see the mirror. In that, I saw my room.  My mouth fell open as my roommate entered it still in a drunken stupor, got a one-hundred-dollar bill from my wallet, and left.  
  
  
“I know what you’re thinking, but it won’t work. You have no idea how long I’ve spent here, waiting for someone to finally switch with.”  
  
  
He then explained his past. I think he mentioned something about him getting trapped in the mirror during an exorcism. Truthfully, I wasn’t paying much attention as I was busy trying to inch my way to something I could throw. In this case, it was a shoe with laces that came from the sole.  
  
  
“Unfortunately, I have to live out the natural life of the person I possess until I can select a new host. Nonetheless, I’ll still be able to have some fun.”  
  
  
As he kept yammering, I chucked the shoe, hitting him square in the face. He cursed, holding his nose as I rushed past him. I was almost to my mirror when the back of my shirt was grabbed and I was tossed through the air. My doppelganger stared down at me with eyes that burned with fury. I’m not exaggerating.  
  
  
His eyes were literally on fire and horns were sticking from his head. I attempted to get back up. His arm shot forward and I could hardly get a breath out as my throat was squeezed. He lifted me with one arm and spoke with a snarl.  
  
  
“You actually thought that half-assed horse shit would be enough to get past me?”  
  
“Kinda…” I managed to choke out.  
  
“Well, allow me to show you what that got you.”  
  
  
The doppelganger’s demonic form granted enhanced strength which he used to beat the monkey piss out of me. It was by far the worst thrashing I’d ever received. Not even that one time when I was jumped by four muggers on my way home from school compared.  It lasted roughly six minutes and ended with me groaning as my ribs were being stomped on.   
  
  
“As much fun as I’m having, I must bid you farewell. Enjoy your stay.”  
  
  
I could only watch as he went to the mirror. He touched it and similar to when I had, it rippled. He climbed through it and then stood in my room, laughing triumphantly. By some miracle, I found the strength to get to my feet, and then stumble to the mirror. I pounded desperately on it while demanding to be freed.  
  
  
My doppelganger who was surveying his surroundings, turned around. He turned around, feigning surprise when he noticed me. Then he faced one of his ears to me and put his hand to it.  
  
  
“Fuck you, I know you can hear me, asshole!” I shouted, still hammering on the glass.  
  
  
He grinned and gave the finger before throwing a sheet over my only window to the outside world, leaving me all alone. There wasn’t a lot for me to do. I mainly kept myself busy with exploration. Wherever I went, the mirror was always nearby. The only silver lining was that I gathered different items, golden statues, and jewels that I thought would be worth a lot if I ever got out of there.  
  
  
I put them in a burlap bag I had found. It was the only thing I could do to stop myself from losing it. There was no indication of time. For all I knew, a second could’ve been a century or vice versa. It wasn’t long before the bag was filled and I was back to facing my crushing reality.  
  
  
“Fuck this. Fuck everything,” I heard.  
  
  
I looked to see my doppelganger coming back in. He walked up to me.  
  
  
“Out,” he told me, cocking a thumb to the mirror.  
  
  
I stood there, blinking a few times.  
  
  
“I thought you were going to live as me.”  
  
  
“I was until I learned your life sucks ass. How the hell are you working two jobs and still living in that dump?”  
  
“Yeah, wages and the housing market have been pretty fucked for a while. Anyway, so I can just leave now?”  
  
“That’s right.”  
  
  
I turned to do so when he placed a hand on my shoulder.  
  
“Hang on, I want to teleport this mirror somewhere people aren’t broke.”  
  
  
“You can do that?”  
  
“Yes, but it requires the sacrifice of a soul.”  
  
  
I hesitantly took a step back.  
  
  
“Relax, it has to be someone who’s currently outside of this realm.”  
  
“Oh, so what are you suggesting then?”  
  
  
When I asked that, my roommate once again staggered into my room. My doppelganger smiled.  
  
  
“I hope you enjoyed your stay,” he said, patting me on the back.  
  
  
My roommate’s back was to the mirror as I exited back into my world. Something I hadn’t noticed the first time passing through it due to the suddenness was how cold it was like an ice shower. I tripped and grunted as I hit the floor. My roommate jumped in surprise and whirled around. He was holding my wallet.  
  
  
“Hey, I didn’t realize you were here,” he told me and tossed it onto my dresser.  
  
  
His eye fell on the bag.  
  
  
“What have you got there?” he asked and walked forward.  
  
  
When he did, my doppelganger's arms emerged from the mirror and seized him. What followed next was him being pulled in as I had. My doppelganger had changed and now resembled him, again, except with a goatee. His jaw unhinged, showing pointed teeth and he tore into my roommate.   
  
  
The sight would have been enough to make even the most iron-stomached people lose their lunch. I know I won’t be forgetting it anytime soon. Ironically, life turned around for me after all that. I. of course reported my roommate missing.   
  
  
Due to the fact, he treated most people like shit nobody cared enough to seriously investigate, and that went cold.  I was right about the stuff I collected. I was able to sell them off at hefty prices.  Thanks to that, I own a private spot of land and life’s been good.  Some people have tried in the past to get me to invest. However, I’m content to live comfortably with what I currently have.   
  
  
I think that’s the lesson in all this. My roommate was only selected as a sacrifice because he was greedy and kept stealing money from me. This led to my doppelganger having a chance to claim him as a sacrifice. Therefore, the moral of the story is if you don’t want to end up screaming as you are eaten alive by some demonic entity, don’t be a douche. Lastly, if you end up in a place like where I did, take what you can from it.
