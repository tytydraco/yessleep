I'm a researcher working for a secret government space exploration agency. For my personal safety I won't be revealing any more personal information, though I'm not sure if it will matter soon. I found some disturbing files hidden deep in our backups.

&#x200B;

I intend to share these files with the world. If the situation is as dire as it seems, humanity deserves to know the truth. I only hope this post can stay up long enough before they find it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

THE FOLLOWING FILES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS

&#x200B;

**\[TOP SECRET\]**

&#x200B;

LEVEL 7 CLEARANCE REQUIRED

&#x200B;

**\~WARNING\~**

&#x200B;

Any non-authorized personnel found attempting to access these files will be terminated immediately in accordance with **Starfall Protocol.** If a data leak has occurred, report immediately to the senior present Commanding Officer.

**SUBJECT: OPERATION ECLIPSE**

&#x200B;

**DESCRIPTION:** The following is a partial transcription of the files recovered from the remains of the Site 1-A Lunar Research Facility. Multiple recordings seem to be absent. Following implementation of Starfall Protocol after the failure of Operation Eclipse, all information deemed to be cognito-hazardous has been redacted.

&#x200B;

**BACKGROUND:** Operation Eclipse was a joint excursion with the Space Exploration Administration (SEA) following the discovery of an >!\[REDACTED\]!< on the far side of the moon. A team of Anomalous Defense Force (ADF) field agents (Designation: Epsilon Squad) was dispatched to accompany SEA scientists in their goal of studying the>!\[REDACTED}!<.

&#x200B;

Epsilon Squad consisted of four agents, designated Epsilon One through Epsilon Four. Their primary directive was to assist SEA scientists in construction of Site 1-A and to ensure safety of all team members during preliminary exploration of the >!\[REDACTED\]!<. Team Lead Epsilon One was given the secondary objective of ensuring the elimination of any potential threat posed by the >!\[REDACTED\]!<.

&#x200B;

The following files are transcriptions from recovered body cam footage and short range radio transmissions between Epsilon Squad members and SEA scientists. Transcript has been compiled in chronological order for convenience.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**-BEGIN TRANSCRIPT 1-**

&#x200B;

*Body cam footage from Team Epsilon and SEA scientists simultaneously begin.*

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Mic check.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Two:** Epsilon Two, checking in.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Three:** Epsilon Three, checking in.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Four:** Epsilon Four, checking in.

&#x200B;

*There is a momentary pause. Epsilon Four is seen tapping Dr. Allen on the shoulder*

&#x200B;

**Dr. Allen:** Oh…um…Bryan Allen, checking in.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lee:** Kelly Lee, checking in.

&#x200B;

*There is another momentary pause.*

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Dr. Gusev, please give us a mic check.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Gusev:** *Sigh* Aleksandr Gusev…begrudgingly checking in.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Three:** There’s a good lad.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Gusev:** \[Expletive\].

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Three:** Oh come on, you grumpy old \[expletive\]. You know we don’t speak Russian. What, you missing earth already?

&#x200B;

*Epsilon Three can be seen making a drinking motion with his hand.*

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Enough, Three. Dr. Lee, can you please brief everyone again on what we’re heading into.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lee:** Sure, Car…I mean…Epsilon One. As you all know, recently one of the SEA’s satellites picked up a strange radio transmission originating from the far side of the moon. Upon further investigation, we were able to photograph what appears to be a >!\[REDACTED\]!< in the lowest point of one of the many large craters present in the lunar region. Previous mappings of this area did not show any such structures, it has seemingly appeared out of nowhere. Now that we have finished construction of Site 1-A, we will be conducting our preliminary expedition to explore the unnatural structure to attempt to discover its origin and purpose.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Three:** I’m already getting the creeps. I say we blow the thing to bits and all go home for a-

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Three, I said that's enough. Thank you Dr. Lee for the briefing.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Four:** I still don’t get why we can’t just send in a drone or something. Why do we have to risk our butts dumpster diving in some >!\[REDACTED\]!<.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Allen:** Ooh, I can answer that. We have discovered that the >!\[REDACTED\]!< interferes with all kinds of electronic signals. Closed circuit technology seems unaffected, so our suits wont suddenly die on us. But that means the only transmissions we will be sending are short range radio waves. Not enough to keep in touch with earth, but enough for us to communicate within a kilometer or so of each other.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Thank you Dr. Allen. Alright, Two, how far out are we?

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Two:** Map shows roughly five kilometers to drop.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Ten four, Two. Let’s keep idle chit chat to a minimum on approach.

&#x200B;

*Epsilon Squad and SEA scientists remain silent for the rest of the journey. Approximately five minutes before arrival, all body cam footage suddenly ceases functioning. Epsilon Squad and SEA team members seemingly do not notice this anomaly.*

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Two:** We’ve arrived.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Three:** Where is it? I don’t see anything except gray rock for miles.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lee:** It’s at the bottom of the crater, remember? We won’t be able to see it until we are at the edge.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Four:** Idiot.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Three:** Wanker.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Alright, everyone out.

&#x200B;

*There is a momentary radio silence.*

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Four:** Holy mother of God.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lee:** Looks a lot bigger in person, huh?

&#x200B;

**Dr. Allen:** It’s…beautiful.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Three:** You’re a weird dude, Allen. That thing aint natural.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Let’s start the descent. We’re on foot from here on out.

&#x200B;

*For convenience, 43 minutes of idle radio chatter has been removed from the transcript. Occasionally, at seemingly random intervals, some of the body cameras would start to record again before quickly shutting off. Footage only briefly shows team members approaching the* >!\[REDACTED\]!< *before moving around the perimeter to study the structure.*

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Three:** Is that…a door?

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Four:** Sure looks like one.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Three:** What the hell is a door doing here.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Two, why have you stopped moving?

&#x200B;

*Radio silence.*

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Epsilon Two, respond.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Two:** Sir I…I think I recognize the door.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Elaborate.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Two:** It’s nothing…it’s just…the door…it looks really familiar.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lee:** What do you mean familiar?

&#x200B;

*Radio silence.*

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Answer the question, Two.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Two:** My dad…he was…not a nice man. When he got angry with me he would bring me to the basement. Lock me in there for days. I spent a good deal of my childhood looking at that basement door. This one…looks just like it.

&#x200B;

*Radio silence.*

&#x200B;

**Dr. Gusev:** I’m sorry, malyshka. That is…no way to treat a daughter.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Two:** Thanks, Aleksandr. It was a lo-

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Four:** Dr. Allen!?

&#x200B;

*At this point Epsilon Four’s body cam was recording properly. Dr. Allen can be seen approximately 40 meters in the distance, standing in front of what appears to be a beige wooden door.*

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Three:** Jesus, he just kept going when we all stopped. Allen, what the hell are you doing over there?

&#x200B;

**Dr. Allen:** It must be opened.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lee:** Bryan?

&#x200B;

**Dr. Allen:** Can you hear that? It’s speaking to us. From the other side of the door.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Gusev:** There’s no air here. What do you mean it’s speaking?

&#x200B;

**Dr. Allen:** Can’t you hear it?

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Dr. Allen, step away from the door.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lee:** What is it saying?

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Kelly-

&#x200B;

**Dr. Allen:** >!\[REDACTED\]!<

&#x200B;

*Radio silence.*

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Three:** What?...

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Four:** Was that…language? What the hell did he just say?

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lee:** Gusev?

&#x200B;

**Dr. Gusev:** That was no language I know of.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Allen:** We can’t stop it.

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Allen, away from the door. Now.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Allen:** The world will be consumed by the nightmare. Billions will die. We can’t stop fate.

&#x200B;

*All body cameras suddenly turn on. Epsilon One can be seen raising his rifle, the other team members begin approaching the door.*

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Dr. Allen this is your final warning. Step away from the door, now.

&#x200B;

*Dr. Allen can be seen quickly grabbing the door and throwing it open. Bright light is briefly visible from behind the door. All body cameras cease functioning simultaneously.*

&#x200B;

**Dr. Gusev:** Allen you idiot-

&#x200B;

*Dr. Allen can be heard screaming incomprehensibly.*

&#x200B;

**Dr. Allen:** >!\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]\[REDACTED\]!<

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Three:** \[Expletive\]

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Four:** The colors…what is-

&#x200B;

*A muffled gunshot can be heard over Epsilon One’s radio.*

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lee:** No! Carter, what did you do!?

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** Two, close that door NOW!

&#x200B;

**Epsilon Two:** I…I can’t. Please don’t make me-

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lee:** CARTER!

&#x200B;

**Epsilon One:** NOW IS NOT THE TIME, KELLY! Two, get a \[expletive\] grip, dammit! Three get to the door and-

&#x200B;

*An incredibly loud high pitched whine can be heard briefly and team members can be seen clutching their heads before all video feeds cut out. Radios are silent for approximately 7 hours before the recording ends.*

&#x200B;

Unfortunately I don't have the time to post the rest of the transcripts right now. I'm having to manually type everything in reddit myself and I think they already know what I'm doing. Trust me, this whole thing goes so much deeper. Until then, spread the word. And whatever you do

&#x200B;

DON'T STARE AT THE MOON.
