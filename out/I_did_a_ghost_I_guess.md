Alright so, this is gonna sound crazy. And, I'll admit. I might just be stupid. But y'all need to explain to me.

This happened a couple years ago. I was at a party, one of my friends was hosting it. I'm just chilling, getting something to drink. My friend, we'll call him Steve. He was pretty cool. I was hanging out with him, drinking, and eating a lot of flamin' hot chips.

Now, I don't have too high standards for my ladies. If she's got a pretty face, and a somewhat skinny figure, she's hot to me. Mostly worried about personality more. But, the girl I saw at that party? Hot, hot hot. I mean HOT. Gorgeous. Absolutely the most beautiful thing my eyes have ever seen.

I mean, she was pretty damn hot! Like, I'm pretty confident in myself. I believe that I could easily pull most single girls, even the more above-average ones in terms of looks. But this girl? I almost just assumed she had a boyfriend, and if she didn't, I thought for sure I wouldn't be able to pull her.

Okay. So, I'm staring at this girl, right? And she is just so epic. And, as I'm staring at her, I get the feeling she looks at me a couple times. Like, we even grinned at each other some. And I'm thinking, "Woah, this is crazy!" 

So, when things are settling down a little bit, I notice she is standing alone over there. So I go over to talk to her. 

She sees me coming, and she is just grinning at me so much. It's that cute, in love with someone kind-of grin, y'know? So I go up and start a conversation with her.

And I'm talking to this girl. And it's epic. And I think we can tell we are both into each other. I'm making it known, too. Like I'm saying shit like "I mean, you looking so hot today..." Or something like that. So I ask her to go on a date with me!

She says yes. Now, I need you to understand how I'm feeling right now. This hot, smoking hot, once in a very long while kinda girl is going on a date with me. My mind is racing. So, I kinda brushed it off when she didn't give me any socials. She didn't give me her number, or social media, or anything. Just told me where to meet her and all that juice.

I don't really make a big deal out of it. I'm like, "Hey, I'm lucky to be in this situation, right?" So, I go out with her the next day. And it's not anything crazy, like we just go to this cool restaurant, and its not too crazy or nothin. 

We talk for a while, eat some food, and it's pretty cool. And then like, she asks me to come over to her house. And woah, that's crazy to me.

Like, if I could explain the feeling I was getting, in this moment. This hot lady was inviting me to her little house. Like, damn, am I that hot or something?

So, I drive her over there. It's pretty cool. And we get to her house, and she's like, let's just watch some Netflix and stuff right? Okay, so I watch Netflix with this hottie.

And it's pretty epic. Like, she's clearly making moves on me, and I'm just enjoying the moment. But then, she turns off the movie. And then invites me upstairs. I'm like, "This is insane! Woah!" And so guess what?

We go to her room. And we do stuff. It was awesome.

And I'm really attracted to this lil female her, okay? Like, this was not a one-n-done thing for me. I definitely wanna get into a relationship! 

Okay, so I sleep with her. That's cool. But this is where things start getting a little trippy.

I woke up the next morning and realized one thing immediately: This chick was gone. Whoosh. Spoof. Disappeared.

So, I'm assuming she probably got up, right? Wrong. I go downstairs, looking for her. Absolutely no one. 

And then, this woman, who at the time I assumed was a sibling or something, (maybe mom?) Came down from upstairs, just got up kinda thing. And she sees me, and she is scared! Like she is screaming, asking who I am, and demands me to leave.

I'm scared now. I get out of there and get in my car, drive off as fast as I can. Cause I'm scared I'm about to go to jail or smth. 

Okay. I get back home. I'm a little confused. But it's all chill. First thing I do? Realize I never got that girls number or anything really to contact her with.

So I go to my friend! Steve! And I call him like dude, invited any hot chicks to that party?

Steve? Yeah, totally clueless. He didn't invite more than a couple chicks to that party, and neither match my description. Crazy.

So I look up this woman's name instead. And, I find nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

So now I think I'm tripping. We ask everybody who was at the party, and everyone is claiming that I am insane. I don't know what to do. And I'm kinda sad actually. I thought I might have a chance at dating that girl.

Okay, so fast forward. Why does this matter at all, Happyman? Did you just tell us a weird story just to do it?

Yes. But also no. See, this woman I was talking about now seems to be stalking me.

I might just be going crazy. But I keep thinking I'm seeing her pop up in random places. Just seemingly at random. And I'm like, spooked.

It's only happened 2-3 times that I've thought I've seen her. So I guess I'm just tripping or smth. Whatever.
