I've been feeling really down lately. Losing my job hit me harder than I thought it would, and on top of that, my girlfriend isn’t picking up my calls. She’s in another city, busy with work, and I keep telling myself that's why she hasn’t reached out. But it still makes me feel uneasy.

To cope, I’ve been watching old movies and eating ice cream. For a little while, it helps calm me down, but there's still this emptiness I can't shake. No matter what I do, it feels like something’s missing, and it just keeps me stuck in this sadness.

I thought about seeing a shrink, but with no job, I can't afford it. My savings have to go toward rent and basic necessities. I tried reaching out to friends, but they’re all busy with their own lives. Chris is the only one who checks in on me and makes sure I’m okay.

Nights are the worst. I can't sleep, and my mind won’t stop racing. Even eating doesn’t help like it used to; nothing seems to fill the void. I keep telling myself that finding a new job will fix everything, but I’ve lost the motivation. It feels like life fell apart all at once, and I didn’t see it coming.

I haven’t talked to my parents in a while because we don’t see eye to eye, and they’ve told me to figure things out on my own. I can’t rely on my friends either; they’ve got their own problems. So, here I am, with no backup plan and just trying to get by.

It’s been three weeks since I lost my job, and most of my days blur together. I spend them on the couch, watching old movies and snacking. I found some stand-up comedy online, and it’s been a bit of an escape. For a few minutes, I can laugh and forget how messed up everything is. But when the video ends, the emptiness comes right back. The comedy has become my way of keeping the darkness at bay, at least for a little while.

One night, I was on the couch again, scrolling through more comedy clips. I lost track of time, and suddenly it was almost 2 AM. I should’ve been tired, but I was too hooked to stop. Then, I came across this old stand-up video. The quality was bad, grainy, like it was from the 80s or 90s. The stage looked old too, like something from a forgotten TV show.

I felt a little nostalgic as I hit play. The sound of an old tape filled the room, and I noticed the video was an hour long. I was tired, but I figured I’d listen to it until I fell asleep. I put my phone on my chest, eyes half-closed, waiting for the laughter.

But after about five minutes, the video went silent. At first, I thought I’d forgotten to hit play, but when I picked up my phone, the video was still running—it just seemed frozen. Unnerved, I tried to fast forward, dragging the red timeline forward, but my phone wasn’t responding. The screen stayed stuck on the stage, with a man just standing there.

A cold shiver ran through me. Something felt off, like I shouldn’t be watching this, but I couldn’t look away. I tried to turn off my phone, but nothing worked except the volume button, I pressed hard the increase volume button to see if the video got audio, but it’s just silence. The power button didn’t do anything, and I started to panic. The only thing moving was the camera, slowly zooming in on the man on stage.

My hands started shaking. The closer the camera got, the more terrified I became. It was like I was trapped in a nightmare, unable to move. The camera kept zooming in until the man’s face filled the screen. Closed up, really close.

This wasn’t a comedy. It was something much darker. His eyes—empty, black and void-like—stared straight into the camera, straight into me. The room felt colder, emptier, and my skin crawled. It felt like he was looking right through me, like he knew everything about me. I was paralyzed with fear.

Then, my vision started to blur. The room grew darker, like vignette in a way that everything dark except for the light from my phone. Everything felt like it was closing in on me, and I couldn’t look away. My heart was pounding, and I could barely breathe. I was trapped, staring into the eyes of something evil. Menacing.

Suddenly, my phone rang, the sound blaring through the silence and making me jump. My heart was racing as I answered it—it was Chris. His voice brought me back to reality. I tried to explain what happened, but my words were jumbled. He told me I was probably just exhausted, that my mind was playing tricks on me. Maybe he was right, but it all felt too real.

I can’t forget it. The man’s face, his eyes, the way everything seemed to close in on me. I tried to find the video again, but it was gone. No trace of it in my history, no sign of the channel. Maybe the uploader deleted it, or maybe it was something else. But whatever it was, I can’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t just a bad dream.
