Ever since I could remember myself, I was a cowardly person. Or, to formulate it in a lighter tone, I am prone to be scared.

Living in a rural area with few kids around my age to play with, we all knew each other in the town and our families were either relatives or friends. My childhood friends had noticed my fidgeting when we would go to darker places. The quickening of my breaths when entering an abandoned townhouse. Or, when going to the farms late at night to play hide and seek. While they picked on me from time to time, they didn't give me a hard time about it. They understood also that the world is dangerous enough so, having one person in your group who is too careful, keep the careless people in line.

I was very good in games; throwing stones with precision on target cans, chasing, dodgeball. However, I was exceptionally good at hide and seek and, being a scrawny little dude, was easy for me to fit in unlikely places. During the day I would go exploring on my own and, at night, I knew where the best hiding spots were that were not *too* dark or far from an inhabited house. Yet I could feel the fear once in a while. A sudden gust of wind whistling through broken branches, would be enough to make me very scared.

When I was around 8, I told my parents about my fear of the dark. They initially told me that I think too much of it but, as the months went by and they saw my everyday efforts to avoid dark corners and always having the lights turned on in my room, they grew concerned.

They asked me on whether I had a negative experience in my past while being in the dark. I didn't. I always had this fear that, in the dark, no one is truly alone. That *something* is there always, waiting to drop my guard. My grandmother, who happened to be in the house during this conversation, she was looking at me concerned and, at the same time, nodding at me. As in a way to tell me that my concerns were valid.

In the following years, I put a lot of effort in my academics and fitness. I signed up to a couple of self defense classes that boosted my confidence in myself, although I still remained thin and short. This fear of the dark, while it lessened, it never vanished even when I finished high school and was about to study at a college a bit too far from my homely town.

My grandmother, bless her soul, had visited us that fateful morning when I was preparing to move to the Uni dorms. She asked my parents that she wanted to talk to me in private and, while initially surprised, they did as she asked and went to carry my stuff in their car.

'My boy' she said with a calm tone, her brown eyes losing their usual joyful gleam 'living alone in a dark, cold city is different. I worked in that city and other cities for many years to bring food on the table. You dear grandfather also was a hard working man. He taught me how to protect myself. I never needed to use what he taught me. But, he also knew that there was one more thing that made me scared. Yes' she admitted as I looked at her surprised.

'The dark' she continued as I didn't interrupt her 'has always been a fear for me. I never had anything bad happen to me in it, but it always made me wary. You know how some stories go. Demons, ghouls, ghosts etc. We often hear that the true monster under the bed is human. But, what if it actually *isn't*?'

I nodded at her, my hands trembling a bit 'even going to a psychologist for this didn't help. Session after session, my fears got little yet they still are there.'

She nodded at that she gently took my trembling hands in hers. She was trembling a bit too.

'Maybe I have an issue or a curse that I passed it down on you, my darling Lukas. We all have problems. However, a few years ago, when your grandfather was in his deathbed for over two weeks, he told me to keep the lights open when it was night, every single night. He never liked to have them on next to his bed, which is why I had a night lamp always on my side of the bed and not his. Right there though, in that hospital room, he asked me that. I did so. He then told me he could sometimes see shadows in the hospital. And sometimes, those shadows didn't neither natural nor friendly.'

'Before he passed away, he gave me this cross to wear around my neck. It was a gift from his godfather. He told me, even during the war, that cross was his candle in the dark. He never took it off and he always felt that it gave him courage.'

She opened her woven bag and took the cross out. I inclined my head, understanding. She wore it on my neck and kissed the top of my head.

'Ever since I wore this cross, I felt more at ease when it would be dark. I stopped using my lamp from time to time. The fear was still there yet, I felt as if your grandfather was next to me, guarding me against whatever was lurking behind the dark curtain of the night. May it be your candle now, a small reminder that dawn always comes even after the darkest of nights.'

I thanked her profusely and we shed tears of farewell. I love her a lot and now I know one more reason why. She understood me completely.

It wasn't easy getting used to the city life. Working part time at a bakery and hustling through my engineering degree was taxing on my body. Yet, I had two cool roommates at the dorm and we kept each other good company in and out of the dorms.

I was on one hand, way of my surroundings, especially late at night when I could return home from a party. But I never got rid of my need for exploration. So I knew which routes and shortcuts to use at night, because I had already explored them during the day.

One such route however, was next to an abandoned, soon to be demolished hotel. While it was open for visitation as a soon to be demolishes historical landmark, that place gave me the chills since the first time I laid my eyes upon it. It had a very creepy vibe, the same type of vide I felt towards darkness; only this place made me feel  actually nauseous when I was near it.  As if something or someone really dangerous was lurking in its shadows of the night.

I tried to explore it during the day, to face my fear within its dusty beige and flowery decorated walls that started to smell of mold. Yet, that place was making me feel pure dread, even during the day. Its basement was the creepiest place I had visited in my life. Even during the hours of the day, I felt pure fear just being in there. In its gray walls and emptiness, I could feel a resounding presence.

What also didn't help were the local news, which were reporting disappearances of people every couple of months near that area. Since I heard those news, I never went to explore that building again. I even bought a pepper spray can, just in case, when I had to go even remotely near that place. It was right in the middle of my quickest route back home from the city center.

Every night, I used a different route to go home after a party. Every night.

Not that night two months ago. Because that was when I met some monsters.

It was a Friday night. The third year engineering students at Uni made a collab party with the philosophy third years. It was an interesting party and people really hit it off. My roommates, Josh and Chris, were also there, dancing and meeting new people. I was there just for the vibes. I had the next morning off at the bakery, so I just wanted to drink a couple of beers and chill. It was almost summer and we had no written exams except for written projects, to it was all good.

I decided to stroll back home at around 02:30 AM. My mates wanted to stay more so, I wished them a good time and went back on my own. It wasn't the first time I did that and I never encountered problematic strangers on the way home. Not this night.

I was halfway through on one of the paths I was using to go home. This path was dimly lit by a couple of street lights. Not many houses were around, only some shops that were closed for the night. I saw from afar three large looking men nudging a person between them. When I took a closer look, I felt terror in the pit of my stomach. That person was a young woman, no older than me. Under the street lamp, I could see that her hair were a mess and something was tricking down from the mouth. Blood. One of those brutes were choking her strong enough to make her not scream for help.

I was frozen stiff in fear. Quickly, I moved to the side, behind another street lamp. I sent my GPS coordinates to my mates and told them to call the police right now. Thankfully, they saw my message instantly. I then took pictures and a short video, showing how they were dragging the poor woman with them and I sent them to my friends.

While I was about to call the police myself, I stood appalled and terrified at what I was witnessing. She was putting up a fight and at one point, one of them punched her in the face.

That's what took me out of my terrified state. That woman was suffering and God knows what else those assholes would do to her. I couldn't rely solely on the police. Friday nights were the worst, the police department would have their hands full of burglaries and other crimes. It would take them at least ten minutes to respond and that might be too late for her.

So, I looked around me and saw some large stones. I put some in my pockets and threw the largest one at the direction of the men.

It hit the arm of one of them with a loud noise. As he turned around to see what was that, I threw another one that hit him square on his temple and he dropped on the pavement, unconscious.

'Come take on someone your size' I shouted as I threw one stone after another at the other two, hitting him n the shoulder.

I was good at aiming, too many games of dodgeball taught me how to be accurate with my throws.

The two assholes dropped the woman like a sack of potatoes on the ground and raced straight at me.

I felt the adrenaline hit me and, before I realized it, I was running full speed away from them, while glancing back and throwing them more stones.

They were screaming in anger as they were approaching me but I was speeding up. I could feel the vibrations in right pocket from my phone, but I couldn't answer right now. They were gaining on me, so I turned abruptly to my left and used a different path.

That path was leading near where the woman was lying and the third man was still down. I ran and saw that the young woman wasn't there anymore, but the man was still on the ground.

She escaped, I thought with glee as I ran and ran in the routs ahead of me. At one point though, I saw only one of them behind me.

Oh crap.

I then realized I was in the lot where that damn hotel was. And it had two ways out, if one of them was right behind me the other was right across me. The lot had no other ways out, it was like a cage because of smaller demolitions that needed to be done in some service buildings right outside the hotel. I looked at the threatening figures gaining on me. I froze for a second.

I could escape them by entering the hotel and exiting via the door in its basement. Yet I *knew* something dreadful was in there, in that basement.

Yet I thought, if something dreadful was in there, I shouldn't be afraid, not now. I needed to be strong. I lunged towards the hotel's entrance, my sudden change of course disorienting my pursuers. They soon followed after me.

I was faster than them now in the dark. Under the dim city lights, I could see quite clearly in front of me. I followed the dusty corridor to my right and went down the only set of stairs leading to the basement.

That's when I felt it. *That's* when I knew. Someone was in here, in the almost complete darkness of the basement. The only light that was entering was from the almost closed exit door. No windows, no lamps. When I ran towards the door on the right side of the basement, my feelings of dread and panic multiplied; there was a lock and chain on the door. I tried to open it but it wouldn't budge. I felt the darkness around me like a thick blanket ready to strangle me while also hearing footsteps on the floor above. The assholes were coming down here.

In that moment, I felt as if my life passed in front of me. There was no way out other than those stairs. If I tried to use them now, there was a high chance they would get me while they would come down here. And if they got me, I was a dead man, I knew it.

I felt my grandmother's cross over my beating heart. I wasn't alone. I felt a soft feeling of relief and bravery engulfing my trembling limbs. I took a deep breath and, in the pitch black darkness, the city lights showed me a bunch of desks and chairs towards the left corner of the large room.

Those weren't here two years ago. I ran towards them, despite an alarming feeling of fear that hit me when I looked towards the dark, left corned. I hid in between some of them offices. They were large and heavy desks and I found a small nook between two of the ones further to the front to hide in it. People in hide and seek always look for the furthest, darkest corners, not the up front, obvious hiding places.

I held my breath. I then took deep breaths to calm myself down. Beads of sweat feel on my forehead, my shirt was drenched. I felt the ground beneath me and felt something like a heavy brick. I took it in my right hand. If they were to find me or catch me while running away, I wouldn't go down without a fight.

I took my phone out, texted my location to my friends but I had no signal. Damn it. I checked my other pocket. I had a couple of stones left. Maybe I could use them to distract them.

The steps got closer to the stairs. I breathed shakily, then slowly, then silently. My heart was pumping in terror as I saw the two men enter the basement.

In that moment, my vision got darker. As if, the darkness in the basement was thicker, heavier. I felt the cross on my chest become heavy and warm. I raised my left hand and, to my amazement and horror, I felt that the cross was almost too hot to hold. Something was very wrong in this place.

The men entered the basement. One of them was lighting up the place and checking the desks one by one, while the other was guarding the stairs.

I didn't think that far, they did. If they find me-

The cross was now burning in my grasp but I didn't let go. I was suddenly feeling all my senses to scream at me to run away from something infinitely more terrible than those two monsters.

'Come out you piece of shit' the dude in front of the stairs shouted, gasping for air 'we will find you and we will have our sweet time taking turns beating you up, little punk.'

His voice was deep and was threatening, but it didn't matter. I wanted to shout at them to run away. I didn't know what it was. I looked through the small crack in front of me.

I froze. My limbs felt suddenly paralyzed. On the left corner of the room, from where I was standing close to a few minutes ago, was a figure. It was tall, abnormally tall. It was wearing a top hat and a tux, yet I couldn't see arms from the sleeves. It had its back towards the room. But I felt it. It wasn't human.

'Whoa' I heard the dude standing in front of the stairs when his phone's light centered on that figure. His buddy also audibly gasped.

'Who the fuck is that' one of them asked and the other just shrugged his shoulders.

The room's felt darker and darker by the second, the light from their phones started to flicker.

'Sir, we are looking for a scrawny ass punk. He is our friend-'

'Is he a friend like that woman you were planning to have your way with a few minutes ago?'

My body now was completely numb. My hand was on my cross and I felt it burn. It was the only thing that reminded me that this was real. That male voice was smooth, almost intoxicating to listen to. But it also felt as if it was a guttural growl from a beast.

'Or that poor old couple you killed two weeks ago? Or that young father you found near your turd and shot on the back? Should I go on?'

The two dudes looked suddenly terrified. One of them pulled a gun out of his pocket.

'Who the fuck are you?!'

The figure slowly turned and that's when I screamed.

There was unending darkness in those empty sockets for eyes, except for an alarming gleam reminiscent of the light of a hunter's moon. The nose was abnormally big and sharp, the face of the skin gray, wrinkled and decaying. And, its mouth was terrifyingly wide, with countless black teeth forming a horrific smile that was pointed towards *me*.

The men gasped loudly, one dropping his phone, the other looking towards my direction and then towards that thing.

In the last flicker of his phone's light, the figure disappeared from the corner and appeared in front of the two now terrified men.

As they started screaming and shooting at it, I saw that thing's upper limbs exiting the tux's sleeves, boney and black from rotten flesh, piercing the head of the dude with the gun. It then tore off the head and threw it to the side, while its mouth took a bite from the headless corpse's neck.

The other man screamed bloody murder, but the beast pierced his chest with its limbs and dragging him towards it, muffled screams and blood gurgling and bone crunching were the only sounds in the basement. The screams were soon gone, the gurgling was gone, the bones crunching sounds disappeared. That thing ate both of them and I saw it all, under the dimness of the city lights from the basement's door and under the flickering of their phones' torches.

Not even the bones remained, not even a drop of blood. I was trembling in fear, tears coming down my eyes. I was next.

The figure stood. It looked at me, those horrific eyes piercing my own. I felt it hated me in that moment. That thing wanted to tear me to pieces.

In an enraged voice, stripped from all the smoothness and the inviting tone of before, that thing growled.

'If it wasn't for that thing you have around your neck, I'd have *you* for dessert.'

The figure disappeared in a black smog.

I don't know how long I was in that nook. I don't know how many hours of shock my brain tried to process. It was way after 6 AM that I saw the light of dawn piercing through the basement door. I mustered the courage to crawl out of my hiding spot. I stood up, my mind hazy and dizzy, my limbs trembling from weakness and tiredness. I approached the stairs, not daring to look to my left.

Not even a drop of blood was there. Only their dropped, crushed phones. Their torches were still on. I left them there.

I looked behind me, towards that corner. I could feel it was there. Now invisible under the light of day, but waiting.

'Goodbye, Lukas'.

I felt terror again in my heart. It knew my name. I ran as fast as I could up the stairs, not looking back, I ran and ran and ran, until I reached in front of my dorms.

I entered my room and my friends were there. They looked at me relieved and came to hug me.

I hugged them back, crying harder than I ever did before. The terror gave its place in overwhelming relief. I don't remember how I got into the shower and then went to the police station to give a testimony of the events.

I met the woman who was assaulted at the police station. Thankfully, she wasn't severely injured by those brutes and she was already treated at the hospital. When she saw me, she rushed to come close to me and hugged me, thanking me for helping her. She had managed to run away to a nearby pub and soon after, she contacted also the police.

The police had already arrived on the spot where my friends had instructed them to go, based on the coordinates I sent to them in that message. They arrested that man. After I left the basement and my phone gained signal, my friends sent them the coordinates of the hotel that they had just received. They also checked the hotel, except for the phones, they found nothing from the other two criminals.

I knew though. As I recounted with the woman and the police the events of that night, I knew what happened to those two. Yet I didn't say anything about what that thing did to them. No one would believe me. Those men were wannabe monsters who met their end by the hands of an *actual* monster.

I am now in my room, the lights turned on. Every whistle of the wind outside, makes me flinch and look around. Every shadow I see in the corners makes me terrified. I still remember those hollow, dark eyes with that horrible orange gleam. I don't know if I ever feel ok.

But suddenly, I reminded myself. I looked at my left palm. The burnt imprint of my grandmother's cross was there, the only reminder of the reality of what happened. And the reminder that in my hour of need, in that thick, murderous darkness, I wasn't alone. I touched the cross over my chest, my candle in the dark. I pulled it towards my temple and, for the first time in my life, I prayed.

I prayed in gratitude. I was alive. That woman was alive. The two criminals were dead. The third was behind bars.

But the monster was in that basement, lurking, waiting for its next victim.

I just hope that, when that building is demolished, that thing will stay in the shadows under the rubbles, forever.
