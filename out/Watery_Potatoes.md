I live far off in the middle of nowhere, nothing, and no-one. A little off grid camper, with an old Ford next door basically sinking into the dusty western ground. Ain’t nothing but dirt and dead bush ‘round where I live. 

My job’s at a lil’ farmers market. I gotta go ‘bout hour forty walk into town to get to work in the first place, a straight shot through some prickly-ass brush, and a bit of a skip along a highway that connects into town. I’d get a bike, but I ain’t got that kind of money.   
  
I was a drifter, but found myself stuck in that lil’ town way longer than I thought I woulda been. The folks round there liked me enough too, set me up in an old camper and a car to move it with. Car didn’t last long. Broke down when I was makin’ my way out. Thas why I stayed so long I guess. But, I didn’t mind. It was a kind town, as I said before.   
  
But it ain’t matter how kind you are, hell always finds its way to ya.   
  
It started off stranger than a barrel full of cats and donkeys. Or however that saying goes. Is that even a sayin’?  
  
Boss man started sellin’ these new taters. Not any specific brand, ‘parently harvested nearby, by a little river or creek or sumthin’, but they ain’t no creeks round here. It’s all dry, dry dead trees, dry dead bushes, dry dead dirt, dry dead birds.   
  
“They magical potatoes I tell ya, got them from the creek nearby.” He says to me.  
  
“Ain’t no damn water for miles round here, Boss man,” I tell him.   
  
“Yeah well these potatoes say otherwise.” He laughed, handing me a tater.  
  
It was like a water balloon, all plump and ain’t holdin’ no proper shape. You could hear and feel a mixture of potato guts and water on the inside. I ain’t sure what the hell made these so magical. They seemed more nasty to me than anything like a wizard would care about.  
  
“They gonna make me rich I tell ya, and they gonna make this town somethin’ special, too. I can see it already!” He took the tater out my hand and waddled off to God knows where, and I continued my shift that day.   
  
He was right about both things: it made him rich, and it turned our quiet town into somethin’ else.   
  
Both for the worse.  
  
Well, at least at the start, all that business comin’ in for a bunch of water balloon potatoes was great. We were raking in so much money, I was able to get a bump in my pay! Nothin’ tiny either, a few dollars. In no time, I was gonna be able to buy a proper place to live.  
  
Our quiet little hick town was bringin’ people from all over. My commute to work along the highway was once empty, and quiet. But all the sudden, it was bustling with cars honkin’ at one another, tryna get into town to buy them “magical potatoes”.   
  
I stopped really seein’ the bossman round the store though. He became a bit of a shut-in. Always in his office. You’d walk by the door and your feet would splash a little in a small lil’ puddle of water comin’ from underneath the door. It was strange. You could hear gurgling sounds inside too. Freaky shit.   
  
On the latest nights I’d stay, cleanin’ up or taking stock of stuff. I would see him waddle out covered head to toe in winter clothes, grab a shit-ton of them water potatoes and go back to his office. I don’t think he ever left to go home.  
  
In time, we only stocked those potatoes. Not sure how there were so God damn many. People would come into the store like a pile of zombies charging towards the stacks of mushy taters. All the regulars became a lil’ strange lookin’ too. They started bloatin’, and always looked a little wet. Like they ain’t leave their clothes out long enough to dry. Just stepped outta the pool or something. And when they’d speak, sounded like they were tryna talk through a mouth full of water, using mouthwash while they talkin’ to ya.  
  
In time, all the people in town became like that, too. Everyone in our town kinda just crowded around the market, I’d come out and those who didn’t get potatoes that day would beg me like a dog for any scraps. You’d find the kindest old lady of the town, rummaging through the dumpster for the rotted, deflated ones that we hadda throw out. It made me sad, seeing all these people who helped me, turn to whatever this was. A bunch of junkies, is the best way to put it.  
  
That lil’ puddle from the front of the boss man’s office eventually covered the floor of the store. Started damaging everything. Every time I tried to mop it all up, it just kept coming. I’d fill buckets on buckets, just chock full of water.   
  
I went to knock on the boss man’s door to confront him about it. Even the door was wet, when I knocked a little water splashed on my face. It was freezing cold I tell ya. Shrunk my balls right up, and it ain’t even touched my balls.   
  
“Come in!” Boss man gurgled at me.   
  
Openin’ the door a little flood flushed out, the water had actually been higher up in here than it was out on the main floor. So the leak musta been in there. And I was right, but the leak wasn’t what I was expectin’. The leak was the boss man himself.  
  
I didn’t, I couldn’t even get a word out. I was stunned. It was like I just came face to face with Satan himself. Just couldn’t believe what I was seeing!  
  
He was all bloated and purple. His eyes were leaking water, like he couldn’t stop crying. And every time he talked, a little waterfall of fluid spewed out his mouth.   
  
“What do you need, kid?”   
  
“Uh, we, uh. We’re runnin’ low on taters, Boss man.” I made up on the spot. We weren’t.   
  
He waddled out, wavin’ me along. Every step he took sounded like water sloshing around in someone's stomach. I wanted to puke man, but I was hungover that day and dry heaving.   
  
At least to me, it didn’t seem like we needed more potatoes. Every stock was about half full, and we still had a bunch more in storage. He wandered around, poking at the watery potatoes and then waddled to the storage in back. Putting his hands on his hips, his bloated water body kinda shaped around like the potatoes do when you poke ‘em.   
  
“You’re damn right we need more taters! These won’t last through the next day! I’ll get right on that.” He threw his arms out and his bubbly skin flapped like old lady wings. I coulda sworn he had some bumps that spat out a little water when he moved his arms too.   
  
It was mid-summer, and I watched that man throw on like, five winter coats, and two extra pairs of socks. Which all got wet the second he put that shit on. Then, he walked out onto the back dock, and just walked out into the woods. I’ve seen enough horror movies to know it ain’t the right idea to follow him. So I just clocked out, and made my walk back home.  
  
When I stepped out of my trailer the next day, the ground was wet. Splashin’ mud onto my work boots, I cursed God, but there were no signs of rain.   
  
The trees were dry, and the few spots of tall grass round my property were dry too. The tops of rocks weren’t wet, ain’t nothing wet, but the mud. There was no water on top of my trailer, or the rust bucket that had sunk further into the dirt it had been sittin’ on.  
  
Going forth on my path to work, I approached the highway. There was no line of cars. Instead, maybe a half mile back, a bunch of cars were parked, and a parade of them bloated customers waded their way down the highway, towards town.   
  
The cars didn’t come much further, ‘cause a puddle started formin’ across the length of the highway, and eventually, the puddle got to about ankle high. Whole town had that blanket of water coverin’ every spot. Peakin’ into the stores, they too had filled with water. But almost half way. There's a little barber shop nearby the market, and lookin’ inside, the barbers were about waist high in water, while the sitting customers were almost neck deep in water.  
  
Every door from every store leaked a little. The old brick and wood walls leaked. Even the people walking around town leaked. But most everyone was heading towards the market.   
  
It was like the epicenter of the storm. Towards the market. I didn’t even dare go into work that day. I kinda just stood and stared at the market. Wonderin’ what the hell was going on. What happened to the boss man, what happened to the town?  
  
I watched all them poor people wander into the market like they were magnets pulling towards another magnet. You could barely make out what was going on inside the market. The windows were covered in potatoes. All mashed and mushed together. I couldn’t even imagine what it was like on the entire inside, might be like moving through quick sand. Except the sand is potatoes.    
  
The sight of the market wasn’t the worst part. It was who was going into the market.   
  
All the old grams and gramps, kind ladies and misters, who had helped me thrive even for a little bit, priceless people, turned into, basically, zombies. Bloated, almost like living victims of drowning. Purple, clogged with lake water.   
  
It was almost sad. I could feel tears wellin’ up in my eyes, but I held them back, didn’t want to add the ever-rising flood. 

While I was off in space, some lady bumped into the back of me. Knocking me down and completely just trampling over me. Face first into the water. She had the strength of a bodybuilder, but from the single look I got of her, she maybe was running towards seventy and running even closer towards dead. 

Once I finally managed to recover, I was all the sudden in the middle of the ocean. Face down, looking at a black abyss. And something, something was coming up from it. I could barely make out what, but I didn’t want to know. I fumbled and flailed in a panic, as the thing got close. Almost looked like a bunch of worms. Slithering fast as shit towards me. 

I managed to get a hold of myself before they got any closer, and I was able to swim back out the water. And there I was, smack dab in front of the market again. 

I ran all the way back to my trailer, hindered greatly by the thick layer of water that was ever growing. By the time I reached my house, there was a very small layer of water on the mud around my trailer. I climbed inside, and didn’t leave until the morning. 

While I was smart enough not to follow the boss man to who knows where earlier that week, I wasn’t smart enough to not be curious about the state of the town. The water had been drunk up by the mud around my house through the night, and I wondered if it was gone in the town too. I hoped maybe I was just dreaming that whole time. 

I took the same walk I always do to work, but I never came across my town. Where the highway exit was, it just exited onto more roads. No cars, no people, no homes, no market. Everything just vanished. 

There were really only remnants of what once was there. A few street signs, grandma’s cats and a dog or two. Maybe a mailbox here and there. But the rest of it just completely vanished. 

So, I am back again to just wandering around. Looking for the next place to make a little money. I wonder where they went. Where it all went. Maybe down to that abyss. I can only hope that wherever it all went, it ain't so bad, but from what I saw, it might as well have been hell.

It’s about time I wrap this up, the public library I’m writin’ this at is closin’ soon. I guess, in the end, I’m grateful for their small part in my life. I will also be forever grateful that I’ve never had a stomach for potatoes.
