 

My name is Amanita, and I am 17 years old. Before you say anything, I know it’s a bad name, it wasn’t my choice, but it *is* my name. my parents are of the interesting sort, always in some form of plight, or in a fight with each other, and I hide in my room, without the light, but never sleep through the night. I live in a perfectly normal house, two floors, 3 bedrooms, but one is an office, two bathrooms but one is only half, and a mildewing basement with the most egregious grey carpeted floor. I go to school every day, except of course on Saturday and Sunday, and every day the bus takes the same path. I wake up at seven each morning, no earlier, and no later, for the most to avoid begrudged moaning from my parents, but there is some sense of comfort in the uniformity of every day.

The bus always takes the same path, it begins at a school, close to my house, and take about 20 minutes to bring us to school. Most of the time it takes the same route -never driving by the pool, or the officious drool of a homeless ghoul that always begged on 9-mile road- instead, we always drive past the fast-food restaurants, the Kroger stores and the small middle eastern markets. One time, I remember my grandpa, who is one of the most interesting men you will ever meet, told me that whenever you go past a cemetery, you should hold your breath, else ghosts would make you a new host to their pearly foax gaseous flow. My favorite part of the impartial drive is passing the cemetery, with its green spun holly, and blood-soaked flowers, the cracked gravestones that burn black with void, and the silver-gray fence that is a brutalist message to stay out.

Living in Detroit, there is a form of community that one can’t find anywhere else. We all hate it here, but there is nowhere else we would rather be. I can think of being in the swim team locker room. Someone’s cap goes missing, and it’s almost unanimous to all of us, “can’t have shit in Detroit,” and we all nod in indignant interest that intercepts the boundaries between hate, and home. I don’t much like talking about school, so I won’t. what I will talk more about, is the bus ride. Home. A cemetery looks so different in the afternoon, the mists that dipped drearily over the dew-raised grass drops away, leaving a new vibrant ground of lime-colored greens, and sticks that poke gently out of the ground. Even though it is so different, I’m not entirely sure which I prefer. I always daydream that maybe one day some kind of imp or impish animal is crawling around, or a long-haunted spirit is floating softly with their misty skin faux.

I will not acknowledge the oddity of my favorite part of my day is driving past a cemetery, you can call me weird or abnormal, but I don’t really care. Think of all the dumb things that make you happy, and revel in the joy of there being so many, because I just have one. Eventually, I arrive at a swim practice, which again I find comfort in the conformity, everyday after school for three hours. Sometimes I work, sometimes I just go home. And when I get home, I work on homework for a few hours, study for the rest, and sleep until the next morning, where I wake up at precisely seven, and you know the rest. Often, I find my friends asking me what my music taste is, or who I listen to, and I’ll give the answer they want, whatever rapper is popular, though I don’t hate rap, I even listen to it often I would say, its far from my favorite. Its just easier than saying I listen to Neutral Milk Hotel, or Fountains of Wayne, and then they say, “who’s that?” and I say, “oh its just a folk band,” or “they do power pop,” and they chuckle a little to break the awkwardness and the conversation moves on.

When I have time, I’ll play on my computer with my friends, but not always. Sometimes I’ll just sit and stare at my screen. I don’t know what I’m looking for, but one day I’ll find it, and on that day *I’ll be unstoppable.* I like to cook, and I’m pretty good at it, in fact, I would even go as far as to say I might be one of the best 17-year-old cooks (at least in the US). Call that cockiness, or honestly call it whatever you want, if you are a 17-year-old cook in the US, I’m better than you, and you just must deal with that. I also play too many instruments, and to be honest, I don’t even know where I find the time to practice; still, I’m first chair trumpet, a damn good double bass player, and an absolutely dogshit guitarist. But none of this really matters, does it? You can know as much as you want about me, but you still won’t know me. To be honest, if you knew me in real life, you probably wouldn’t like me. Plenty of my friends do, sure, but you aren’t my friend. You don’t know me, and I want you to remember that. I probably wouldn’t like you either. There are very few people I actually like, even among my friends, fuck, even among my family.  

I’m not religious, but I believe in ghosts. And if that’s not ironic than I don’t know what is. And I know what you are going to ask, “well what the fuck are ghosts then?” and I’ll just shrug my shoulders. To be honest, my shoulders are tired from shrugging so much. I’m running out of (“it is what is”)’s, so I guess I’ll have to find a new phrase soon. Most of my melancholic family is religious. I say melancholic because it’s really the only way I can describe it, no one in my family is OK, and I think we have all come to terms with that. I’m telling you all of this, because I think its important, for whoever you are, to remember me. Legacy is all we have left when we die, and when we die without anyone to remember us, we die in more than one way, and I already said I don’t believe in an afterlife.

Anyway, my apologies for the shift in tone. When I said our house was perfectly normal, that was a lie. There is one difference that I haven’t seen in any other. Our stairs to our basement are completely out of character for the rest of the house. A spiral staircase of dark stained oak that connects to our kitchen. The grain on the wood flows softly in black streaks, like skid marks on the street. The varnish sometimes scrapes off slightly, raising a gummy substance that for some reason is so satisfying to scratch at.  The wood on the stairs is left bare, looking like one solid block of wood carved down, with cat hair that digs into the crust filled crevices and baren corners. Rarely you can find a piece of dogfood or kibble that made its way to the bottom, and crunches cringingly as to concentrate on not dying while going down the stairs.

Today is December 5^(th), a Thursday.  I just got home from a swim practice, and I’m not OK. To be honest, I haven’t for a few weeks now. I’ve been hallucinating. But not what you imagine, far worse. It started off exactly two weeks ago. It was morning and I was riding the bus to school. As normal, we passed by the cemetery, and as normal I had some music on while solemnly staring at the silent and sterile cemetery.  The mist sat low and rolled like clouds softly stepping over each grave. The dirt seemed to almost be alive, slightly moving with what I guess was every little slip of wind. The grass stood still and tall, yet it still flowed softly, with a few taller blades that had been missed by the groundskeeper. We were almost passed when I saw her.

She was a pale woman, almost as pale as the mist that swirled near her feet. Her skin seemed to almost shine as small rays of sun began sneaking over the skyline. Her eyes were wide eyed, almost frantic, but she was completely still. Her hair didn’t even move with the wind. But instead laid completely still, long and black, but stained gray and brown with twigs and all sorts of small things poking out. It seemed frail, and shaggy, like it could be pulled out with gentle tugs. She was very skinny, you could see the bones in her lanky arms, and the ribs pressing against her slightly translucent dress.  Strangely, her skin seemed too, perfect. Like she had polished them with sandpaper.

She was standing perfectly still with her head pointed slightly down, as she was staring at a grave. Just as we were about to drive past, her face jerked and pointed directly towards me. Her face seemed almost hollow, like there was nothing behind her eyes. Her mouth opened to a jet-black abyss that seemed to be infinitely deep. Just as we had almost passed, she started screaming. Her voice was shrill, and so high pitched I could barely hear her. It was full of cracks, and all I could make out were two words. “Find me. Please.” And we drove past. I frantically looked around the bus. No one else was looking up, glued to a phone, or homework that they forgot to get done for their first hour.

The whole school day felt like it lasted forever. I told my parents I had a school event, that was a lie. Instead, after school I walked the mile to the cemetery. The black gates that seemed like they would be guarding something horrible were unlocked. Their spikes imposed down on me and seemed to grow taller as I staired. Though the day started off sunny, as it passed the sky became covered with dark clouds, the kind before a dreadful thunderstorm. I pushed lightly and it seemed the gates swung open on their own. I slowly walked through the graveyard, as I had at least an hour and a half before my parents would be expecting me at school. Most of the graves were too old and dust crusted to see the names or dates, but I caught a couple here and there, though no names of note. I wasn’t alone in the cemetery. A few old women locked, perhaps widows remembering their husbands, or mothers who lost their children. Eventually I arrived at the grave she was staring at. It was close to the fence, and shadows from the fence casted down even though there was no sun shining.

I walked around the grave, kicked lightly at the dirt, and eventually I sat down for a second when I finally realized I wasn’t going to be able to read the grave, as it wasn’t just dirt, but the name was seemingly scratched off. After a minute or so of desperately hoping something on the grave would be visible, I sat down, and held my knees to my chest, staring at the grave. I began to wonder if it was just a weird dream, but I don’t remember waking up, and it just seemed so vividly real. When I sat down, I realized there was something I missed. Covered in dirt and a tuff of grass was a small piece of paper. When I grabbed it and dusted it off, I realized it was yellowed and crinkled as if it was very old. The note read:

*help me help me* help *me help me* help *me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me*

*-I’ve found you. Did you find me?*  *Did you find me?*  *Did you find me?*  *Did you find me?*  

It was at this point I began to wonder if someone had put this as a prank, at least I did until the note completely crumbled to dust in my hands, and blew away, and in the whisper of the winds, I heard one last time *I’ve found you.*

I walked back to school silently, and without music. Slowly as I walked to the parking lot of the school, the skies seemed to clear, at the time I didn’t know but that was for one of the last times I would see the sky. I was waiting on a bench in the school parking lot for a few minutes, when my brother, whose name is Panaeolus (I know, our parents are really bad with names), picked me up in his dark gray civic. We drove home quietly; I think he knew something was off. To be entirely honest, I think he noticed more than I did. When I got home, I was greeted by one very excited dog, two cats who kept their distance because of said dog. I immediately went up to my room and laid down. I had homework to do, but the chance of me doing that was slim to none.

After dinner, I fell asleep as for some reason this wave of exhaustion had rolled over me. The next morning when I got up and looked out my window, it was very dark, But I could still tell those dark clouds hung heavy over the sky. As I walked to the bathroom, I walked up to the toilet, and without warning, I began throwing up. I noticed I was being rather loud and wasn’t surprised to find a gentle hand laid on my back. I kept throwing up and retching for at least another couple minutes, and when I stood up and turned around, I saw that same woman staring at me, all I remember is she started shrieking once again. That’s the last thing I remember before I woke up in a cold shiver in my bed. My forehead was sweating, and I felt like death, my brother noticed I had woken up from the room over and came over to hand me a glass of warm water and scanned my temperature. *102.* “You need to rest.” He spoke. “Tell us if you need to go to the bathroom, we don’t want you fainting and hitting your head without us noticing.” And I nodded slowly, agreeing with him. He then asked me “how’d it happen you got a giant clump of your hair in the toilet?” and I sat for a second, not knowing what to tell him as I don’t remember anything involving my hair, and in fact my hair was the only part of me that seemed OK.

The rest of the day passed slowly. My fever never went down, and I suppose I needed some rest anyway. I swear, every time I would look around, she would be in the corner of my eye, for just a second, before she would disappear. Due to my fever, I would ever so often fall asleep, before waking back up, and just in the second after I would wake up, I could ever so faintly her voice saying, “I found you.”

The next morning, I was supposed to have work. My fever had gone down to 99 overnight, and I felt much better, but I work with kids, and it would break my heart if I was the reason any of them got sick. My boss was surprisingly understanding and said she would be able to find someone to sub for me. My computer is setup in the basement. It’s cold, dark, and miserable, which is exactly why I like it. I was playing some single player games, but the whole time, I felt this impending sense of doom, which just would not dissipate, no matter what I did to take my mind off it. Eventually I fell asleep to some pleasant dreams in my computer chair and must have slept for a couple hours. When I woke up, I don’t really know how to describe it, but I wasn’t *home*. No, it was different. The rooms were in a different order, the staircase was much grander and larger, even my computer was a different color. Everything was just, off.

I got up and walked around the basement for a little bit. Everything seemed the tiniest bit off, even the littlest things had changed, down to the color of the shirt I was wearing. I walked upstairs to try to gain my senses back a bit and found my mother cooking. She stared at me, but something still seemed, off. When she saw me, she seemed a bit shocked. “Amanita, what are you doing? You should be in bed, your fever!” I replied with a dismissive “I feel fine” but she insisted on checking my temperature. 102.5. it had gone up. She led me by my hand to my room, and sat me down, telling me to stay in bed or she will make sure I do.

I asked where Panaeolus, but she just looked at me confused, at told me to go to sleep.

I must have slept through the rest of the day. As I woke up Sunday morning. Well, I was supposed to be Sunday morning. Instead, my phone said December 3^(rd), 8:41am. I don’t remember it ever being December, it should have been November. It was at this point I began to wonder if my situation was worse than I had previously though. That woman, was still there, but now she stayed. I would look at her, and she would shriek or scream or yell or whatever the fuck she was doing. I noticed now she was holding a pen and paper. But she wrote anything, it just sat at her side limply. My door was closed. As I got up to open it, it felt as if my body was being ripped to the ground and pulling me. I almost got to the door when I fell on my carpeted floor and landed on my arm.

Though I thought it was rather loud, no one came for me; well, except for that woman. She came over, and helped myself get up, her boney hands dug into my flesh, but at this point, I was too delirious to care. She pushed me into my bed and disappeared once again. I think I fell asleep again, but I’m not entirely sure. Eventually, I head a knocking on my door. Three short and deep knocks that seemed like they rattled my whole world. And again, three more knocks, this time more veracious, almost like they had a sort of hunger to them. I curled deeper in to my bed, burring my face in my blankets, tears began streaming down and reddening my eyes. After a minute the knocking started again, but it was constant, I saw my door shake, but there were no shadow out from under it, despite the light pouring in from underneath. When the knocking stopped, I lay perfectly still, and staired at my ceiling. I’m not sure how long I looked, but I remember seeing these weird arms, thin and lanky almost like spiders’ legs. They would flicker back and forth across my ceiling like spaghetti noodles falling from a fork.

When my attention finally broke, I looked to my side, and was surprised to see my brother staring back. Something was, different. Then I realized, it was the same look my mom had earlier, and the woman, who now stood perfectly still in the corner of my room. There eyes were so hollow. There skin was taught against their bones, and their hair fell in a tangled mess. I blinked and he vanished. I looked at my phone, and it read December 3^(rd), 8:41pm. 12 hours had passed in what felt like minutes. Suddenly, I heard a scream from outside my door. I don’t know why, but something about it was so calling to me. I got out of bed, this time without the dizziness or the weight of my body stopping me, and I opened my door.

Looking back at me I saw my mother. My father had her pinned against the wall by her neck with one hand, and a pair of plyers in the other hand. It didn’t take me too long to realize that he was slowly pulling out one tooth at a time. Each time more blood rushed out of her mouth, and she would scream louder and louder. On each tooth I could see the sinew and meat dangling off, blood dripped on to the floor, and she smiled. She smiled.

I woke up once again in my bed. but it was like I never even left. I looked at my phone again, and it read “8:42pm.” The date didn’t show, or my vision was too blurry to see it. Not five minutes later, (it could have been much longer or shorter, my sense of time was near nonexistent by now) I fell asleep.  When I woke up again, I was feeling slightly better. The knocking was back now, but it sounded like it was coming from everywhere around me. I saw massive spiders crawling across the wall and ceiling. Their fury abdominal seem to wiggle and change shape as I looked at them. They would crawl for a little bit, and then they would disappear, but they would disappear, instead I could see the same spider a few feet away, crawling in a different direction.

At one point I remember my dad coming into my room. He opened my doorway, and stared at me. Eventually, I watched as his eyes started to melt in their sockets, the white cornea liquified and splashing on my carpet before soaking in. His face seemed to be constantly changing shape, but it always looked like him. Suddenly, he brought his hand up to show me, his palm facing him. With his other hand, he dug in and began ripping his fingernails out one by one. the noise was the worst part, it would make this squelching noise like a sponge being squeezed. I could see the blood pouring out of the now exposed skin, and he held all five fingernails in his other hand, he brought them up to his abyss like mouth and swallowed them like pills. This time, he walked out and closed the door, I don’t remember waking up.

The woman finally came over to me and talked. She handed me her pad of paper. And pressed with the pencil against my chest. She said “write” and I asked, “write what?” and she disappeared, but she left the pen and the paper. I fell asleep one last time. And when I woke up, my phone said 10:54pm, December 5^(th). today. I saw my door creak open, and the woman beckoned me to follow. For some reason it was like I wasn’t in control of my own body. My legs moved but I didn’t move them. I think if I had tried on my own, I would have fallen over many times. She sat me down at the kitchen table, which was a much darker colored wood that I remember. she said “write”, and I began writing. I wrote for hours and I’m still writing. Now I’m watching her stare at me, gesturing with her hands. It’s almost like she is slightly vibrating and flickering in and out of different positions as I look at her. If I look at her long enough, she seems to get older, her skin dryer and more taught, and her hair degrading, but when I look away, she always goes back to how she was.

The knocking is back now. Every wall seems to shake with its intensity. I don’t know how much longer I can take it.  The walls drip crimson with what I can only assume to be blood. The sky outside is jet black, and I can only see inches past the window, like the very world itself is closing in on me. I feel sick. Like when you have a fever and the waves of dysphoria poor over you. The spiders are back, crawling everywhere. I can feal their hairy legs pricking my skin as they crawl over me. Every so often I close my eyes, and go on small journeys, whether its walking to the bus in the morning, or brushing my teeth before bed. But the spiders and knocking are always there, and every corner turned, every peripheral of my eye, she is there. Watching and waiting.

The woman is looking at me right now and holding a rope. And is beckoning me to the staircase. I set the note down on the kitchen table, and finally give in. I can’t take this anymore.

*help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me help me.*

 *Did you find me? Did you find me? Did you find me? Did you find me? Please brother.*

*\*The following writing was discovered in a suicide note written by Amanita. Her parents are still in denial that she is dead. I, her brother, am not, I’m the one who found the her note. And I fear very soon, I may end up the same.*
