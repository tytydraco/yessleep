Grand Lake is picturesque. I’ll give it that.

My dad’s doing this professor-in-residence gig at the Grand Lake Lodge, giving lectures a couple of times a week on technological innovations in corporate accounting— exciting, right?

Honestly, it’s kind of weird being here for the whole semester, especially since I’ve been used to hanging out with my friends on campus. But it’s only one remote semester, so the toughest part hasn’t been the isolation or even missing out on the social stuff—it’s the fact that I’m not much of an outdoorsy person. 

While everyone else is out hiking or kayaking, I’ve found myself pretty bored. Though I have found some solace by holing up in the brand-new library in town. 

It’s actually been a bit of a lifesaver. 

There’s something about being surrounded by shelves full of books, some of them barely touched, that feels comforting. The library’s modern, but somehow still feels like it’s been here forever—like it’s seen generations of readers come and go.

Usually, there’s a little lively group of people at all of the desks in the middle of the library. Studying, watching shows on their laptops, catching up over coffee. The noise level of the place is a little unusual for a library.

I’ve been spending my days tucked away in the quieter corners, knocking out some lectures and course work, then losing myself in the kinds of books that I’m a little embarrassed to admit are my favorite. I’ll inject cozy fantasies into my veins if you’d let me. But lately, there has been this weird feeling, like someone else is here with me, watching me and only me.

Maybe it’s just the strangeness of being in a new place, or maybe it’s all of the fantasies I’ve been reading, but the sense that I’m not alone? It’s hard to shake.

I’ll get the strongest tingle of someone gazing at me when I get up to get a coffee or take a bathroom break. Like someone’s been watching me read.

But I always trudge on… 

Nobody’s going to keep me from churning through some good books.

\*\*\*\*\*

One day, hungrier than usual, I decided to call it early... around 11 am.  I exited the library and pulled up food options on my phone. 

By the time I found a pizza place that sold slices, I could feel that someone was standing next to me. Too close to me in my personal space. As I looked up, I could feel the hair on my arms suddenly raise. A man was staring right at me. From less than an arm’s reach away.

He appeared to be a well-dressed gentleman in his mid-30s, with piercing forest green eyes, but there was something uncanny about his demeanor.

“You have exquisite tastes in literature,” he said to me with a big smile.

I was more than a little caught off guard.

“Thanks,” I finally said after a few awkward moments of silence.

“*Harry Potter*. *The Hobbit*. *Earthsea*.”

I started wondering how many times he had watched me read.

“Nice, light reads, yes. But the worlds within can be quite dark.”

“I guess… I’m sorry, have we met?” I finally asked him.

“Marek,” he said, shaking his head.

“Marek? That’s a unique name.”

“I’m looking for an intern with your background,” he said confidently, as if he was bestowing a great honor upon me.

“My background?”

“I’ve seen you read about worlds unlike your own and accept them willingly… and I’ve seen you solve difficult math problems with ease.”

I think he was talking about my Calculus I homework.

“Are you a stalker?”

“No, as I have already mentioned, I’m a potential employer, and to be forthright with you, I haven’t prepared anything more than this. So do you mind if I get to the point?”

“Sure,” I nodded.

“I’m from a place called the Down Under.”

“Australia?”

Marek laughed. 

“It’s a little like Australia… But imagine Australia if it were ruled by the terrible things in Tolkien’s Middle Earth. Or from the forbidden forest in Harry’s fateful coming-of-age tale. A place in between the beginning and the end. Not for the faint of heart. Everyone and everything you meet is out of your nightmares.”

“Okay… How -”

“Even me,” he said, cutting me off.

Even him? He looked like a fairly normal guy. 

I think he could sense my confusion. He then raised his right hand with an outstretched finger, gesturing towards a large shop window that had us both in its reflection.

I looked the same.

But Marek didn’t. 

His reflection was a blurry, hulking figure. Maybe seven feet tall. With the unmistakable features of a faun—horns, fur, the works. Except his eyes were gone, replaced with deep, black, empty sockets. His fur patchy, scarred, and missing in places, exposing raw, sinewy flesh.

I felt like my blood froze solid.

“Whoa…” I finally said under my breath.

“I’ve recently started a business. Customers are piling into the pipeline, but I need a human intern. I have some issues in the Down Under that only a human can solve.”

“For your customers?”

He nodded.

“I’ve figured out just how much money one can make by retrieving humans from the Down Under. Some humans here where you live have the means to write blank checks.”

“How do people get to the Down Under?”

“They die, of course.”

I was still staring at Marek’s reflection as he spoke. He noticed, raising his right hand and giving me a little wave in the reflection.

“I need a human to help bridge the worlds. I have limits,” he continued. “Listen… I can offer you a one time opportunity to see the Down Under today. And then we can talk about the internship.”

“Today?”

“Right now, yes. A day’s visit. But you must decide now.”

“I’d get to see the Down Under and return here?”

Marek nodded. 

I considered his proposition for about two minutes. 

The allure of adventure was a little too tempting for a person who secretly wishes she received a Hogwarts acceptance letter when she turned 11.

“How would I get there?”

Marek smiled. Then pulled out a small, black travel bag, one you would carry your toothbrush and toiletries in if you were going out of town.

As he unzipped it, small streaks of vibrant lights began to spill out.

He rummaged around and pulled out a small vial filled with a luminescent liquid. Then gave me instructions as he swirled it around, remixing whatever liquids had separated.

“Drink this, and you must die within thirty seconds to cross under temporarily, then I’ll find you.” 

“Within 30 seconds. Are you -”

Marek was already in the midst of pulling out a long, glimmering blade from his jacket. An ancient looking sword. 

“For your head. It should be painless.”

“Should be?!” I shot back.

Marek nodded.

“I’ve never done it myself, but for others, they’ve told me it’s painless.”

Fair answer, I remember thinking. I held the vial of liquid in my hands. It looked vile.

“What’s it taste like?” I asked hesitantly.

“You’ll find out soon enough,” he replied with a hint of mischief in his eyes.

Bracing myself, I uncorked the vial and downed the liquid as a shot.

The taste was absolutely horrendous, like animal urine mixed with the bitterness of strange medicinal herbs. I gagged, struggling to keep it down.

I finally finished swallowing it, but it was too late.

Marek’s face had twisted into some state of panic. His form shimmered violently, something was going terribly wrong.

"Wait—no! I didn’t —" His voice faltered, growing distant. "You must die!" His last words, sharp and urgent, hanging in the air as he vanished, dissolving like smoke in the wind.

I was alone. I had just drank a strange liquid.

The silence rushed in, cold and suffocating. My heart raced, drumming against my ribs. The reality of my situation crashed down on me. 

*You must die*. 

Marek’s words echoed, but how? 

How was I supposed to die without him, without his guidance— 

*What would happen in 30 seconds if I didn’t die?*

My breaths turned into wheezes as my mind raced for a solution. 

I stood at the edge of town, outside the library, at a crosswalk alone.

And I needed to die?!

I was very worried that if I didn’t follow his directions... I don't know, it didn't sound like a good idea.

My eyes darted around, desperate, and that’s when I saw it—a truck, its headlights cutting through the twilight, barreling down the road.

The truck was close, fast, and I could feel my pulse slowing in contrast to its roaring engine. 

I stopped breathing, focusing.

This was it.

There was no time to second-guess. 

I leapt in front of it.

The truck’s blaring horn drowned out everything else as my world’s end rushed toward me.

I felt something… I think it was the impact. 

But it’s not what I expected. It felt like a wave of jello washing over me.

Then blackness.

\*\*\*\*\*

It was bone-chilling cold.

I opened my eyes, gasping as frigid air filled my lungs. 

The air was thin. It took me multiple heaves to catch my breath.

The sky was a burnt orange, but I didn’t see a sun or source of light.

I then realized I was high up on a cliff. Behind me was a forest of trees, a darker green than I have ever seen, almost black.

I went to the cliff’s edge and saw it.  

A twisted landscape of horrors—

Hordes of rotting skeletons and monstrous beasts locked in violent struggles with humans. Everywhere. As far as I could see. 

The air was thick with the sounds of gnashing teeth, clashing bones, and people dying. 

I shrunk back instinctively, pedaling backwards, trying to make myself invisible.

I felt safe for the moment.

But my god, I could see heads being ripped off. Rotting skeletons stabbing humans as their prey with long spears.

*Where the hell am I?*

It took me a moment to remember the truck, to remember everything.

Then I felt something approaching me. I turned–

It was moving rapidly towards me. It was a shadowy human-like figure, enveloped in a black mist. It stopped and knelt down in front of me.

It stared at the ground as it held up something I’d never seen before.

Some brown organic thing. It almost looked like a fruit.

It gestured over and over for me to take it, but I was staring at the figure itself. I could see a white skull floating within the blackness.

It gestured one more time aggressively.

I just kept staring at its floating skull. 

The figure then screeched, launching the brown thing to the side.

Then pushed me down to the ground and jumped on me.

Its hands started searching for my neck.

It was on top of me. 

I could feel the pressure of its hands grasping my throat.

I tried to fight back, but it was too strong. I couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t even think.

*THWACK!*

The shadowy figure took off flying into the air, landing twenty feet away. 

An arrow had pierced through its white skull.

Then a voice called out, distant yet familiar. 

"Welcome to the Down Under!"

I scrambled to my feet and saw him—Marek, but not the human Marek I first met. 

He was fully transformed into what I saw in the window reflection. The same but in perfect clarity now. Though I now noticed blood dripping from his black eye holes.

Marek rode towards me in some sort of dune buggy, some grotesque contraption made of bones—some animal, some looked disturbingly human. On it was mounted a sort of crossbow. 

I couldn't tell how it was powered.

I was shaking. I think it must have been from shock. Why would I ever agree to any of this?

Marek slid up next to me, dismounting whatever it was with an eerie grace, leaving behind a crossbow in the driver’s seat.

“Arm,” he said without preamble.

“What?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

“Arm. Left or right, please.” 

His voice was cool, almost businesslike, as if this is the most natural thing in the world.

Unsure, I extended my left arm, trembling. 

In a flash, faster than I could process, Marek unsheathed the same blade he had as a human and made a precise cut across my skin. The sting was brief, the pain oddly muted, but blood started to rise in a slow, deliberate trickle.

“Why?” I managed to ask, queasy at the sight of my small gash throbbing.

“I need us both to remember how many times you’ve crossed over,” Marek replied, as if it was obvious.

“There’s a limit?” I press, more confused than ever.

“It’s theorized,” he muttered, already distracted. 

Marek knelt over whatever he killed and began inspecting its remains. The hollow clattering of bones echoed as he rummaged through what was left of it.

“They’re further out than they used to be,” he muttered, his brow furrowed in concentration. “Humans here used to have time to prepare. They had a chance.”

I couldn't help but ask.

“Prepare for what?”

Marek stuffed the skull into a worn sack, then tossed it casually into the back of his dune buggy thing. He turned to face me, his eyeless, bleeding black sockets looking directly into my eyes.

“What do you think?” he asked, a grim smile tugging at his lips.

I took another look out at the surreal, demonic landscape that surrounded us. 

I was dark, chaotic, and otherworldly. 

“Is this hell?” I asked.

Marek shook his head. 

“No. Far from it.”

He sighed, his shoulders slumping, and suddenly, he looked weary— more vulnerable than before.

“Listen, I fucked up,” he admitted. “We’re out of time. It’s why I vanished in front of you. I had 8 minutes, and was supposed to have 8 hours. Another reason I need an intern...”

He paused, glancing around. 

“My math sucks”

“What happens next?” I asked.

“I need to work with Draven on these shitty doses of trisage.”

But I felt something was changing. Like I was already leaving this new world behind. 

“I'll meet you at the library on Monday! I have to do the paperwork!” Marek yelled, his voice trailing off into the blackness that took over my sight.

“I haven’t -” I tried to yell back, but it was too late.

Total blackness.

Then I could hear the sounds of Grand Lake returning. 

The cars, the shops, the people. 

I opened my eyes. 

I was back standing in the middle of the street, right in the place where the truck hit me. It almost felt like no time had passed. An involuntary shiver went down my spine. 

What the hell just happened to me?

I held up my left forearm in the light. The precise little cut was still there. 

My arm was still bleeding…

Then I thought about next Monday... 

Did I accept the job without realizing it? And what exactly had I gotten myself into?
