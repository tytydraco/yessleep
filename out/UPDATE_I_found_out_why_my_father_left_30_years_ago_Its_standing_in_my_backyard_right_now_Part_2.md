It hasn’t moved.

It’s been standing in the backyard for an hour. Just... standing there. Between the old oak tree and the fence, staring up at my window.

I’ve been refreshing the page to keep myself sane. Reading your advice about calling a priest, moving out, or just "going to sleep".

I wish it were that simple. But my legs won’t work. Fear has this way of nailing your feet to the floorboards.

I can’t see its eyes, but I can feel them. Burning.

*Buzz.*

My phone lit up. A text from Mom.

Mom: "Don't let her inside."

I looked down at the screen for a split second. Just a second.

When I looked back up at the yard, my blood turned to ice.

The spot under the oak tree was empty.

It wasn't gone. I knew it wasn't gone.

*CRASH.*

The sound of breaking glass from downstairs exploded in the silence. The back door.

It’s in the house.

That sound snapped something inside me. If that thing gets upstairs, it gets Mom first.

I threw the covers off. I grabbed the heavy brass lamp from my nightstand and yanked the cord out of the wall. It was heavy enough to crack a skull.

I crept to the door.

*Don't do it,* a voice in my head screamed. *She told you to stay.*

Then I heard it. Heavy footsteps on the stairs. Fast. Wet. *Slap... slap... slap...*

It was coming for me.

I threw the door open. The hallway was pitch black.

"Mom?" I whispered.

Nothing but a wet, gurgling sound.

Then I saw it. A dark silhouette rushing toward me from the shadows, arms reaching out.

I didn't think. I just swung the lamp with everything I had.

*CRACK.*

It collided with the figure with a sickening thud. We both crashed to the floor.

I didn't stop. I scrambled on top of it. I slammed the brass base against its head. Again. And again. Until the wet, crunching sounds stopped. Until there was no face left to look at me.

I sat back, gasping for air.

It was over. I killed it.

But as my eyes adjusted to the dark... the thing on the floor looked different.

It looked... small.

Without the shadows, it just looked like a frail, broken body in a nightgown. It seemed so pathetic now.

"It's over," a voice whispered behind me.

I slowly turned around. Mom was standing there.

"Mom?"

I walked to her.

She wrapped her arms around my waist. Then she wrapped them around my back. And then, she wrapped them around my waist again.

A double knot. To keep me safe.

"I'm so glad you're okay," I whispered.

She pulled back just an inch to look at me.

And then, she smiled.

It started as a warm, loving smile. But it kept stretching. Pulling back wider and wider, past her cheeks, until I heard the faint, wet sound of her skin tearing to make room for it.

"I'm better than okay," she said.

"Now sleep."
