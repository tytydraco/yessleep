I never really thought about mirrors much until last month. Now, I can’t look at one without feeling like something is looking back, something that isn’t me.

It started when I moved into this old apartment downtown. The place was cheap, probably because of the outdated fixtures and weird layout, but I didn’t care. I was just happy to finally have my own space. There was only one thing I didn’t like. The massive antique mirror bolted to the bathroom wall. It was old, the glass slightly warped, and no matter how hard I cleaned it, the surface always looked… off.

The first time I noticed something wrong, I was brushing my teeth. I glanced up and, just for a second, I swore my reflection was delayed. Not by much, just a fraction of a second, but enough to make my stomach drop. I told myself it was in my head. Sleep deprivation, stress, whatever. But then it happened again. And again.

One night, I decided to test it. I lifted my hand, watching closely. My reflection followed… but just a beat too late. I laughed nervously and waved. Again, just a slight hesitation.

Then it smiled.

I hadn’t smiled. My face in the mirror did.

I screamed, stumbled backward, but when I looked again, everything was normal. My own terrified face stared back at me, wide-eyed and trembling. I convinced myself I had imagined it, maybe a trick of the old glass or my own paranoia.

But it kept getting worse.

The more I paid attention, the more I noticed things weren’t right. My reflection’s pupils were just a little too large sometimes. Other times, it blinked when I didn’t. And once, just once, I saw its lips move even though mine stayed perfectly still.

I stopped using the mirror. I covered it with a towel, but every morning, I’d find the towel on the floor.

Then, last night, I woke up to a noise. A soft tapping sound.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I sat up, heart pounding, listening. It was coming from the bathroom.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Like fingers drumming against glass.

I wanted to pretend I hadn’t heard it. I wanted to pull the covers over my head and wait for morning. But I couldn’t. I had to know.

I crept toward the bathroom, every nerve in my body screaming to turn back. The door was slightly ajar, and the dim glow from the streetlights outside cast long deep shadows.

The towel was on the floor. The mirror was uncovered.

And my reflection wasn’t in it.

The bathroom was empty, but the mirror showed something else. A figure, standing just beyond the frame.

It grinned.

Then it stepped forward.

I ran.

I don’t remember grabbing my keys, don’t remember sprinting down the stairs in my bare feet. I just ran. I didn’t stop until I was outside, gasping for breath in the cold night air.

I’ve been staying at a friend’s place since then, but I know it’s not over. I woke up this morning and caught my reflection in her hallway mirror.

It smiled.

And this time, it winked.
