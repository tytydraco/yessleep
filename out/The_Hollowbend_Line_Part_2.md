The next morning, the sunlight leaking through the thin curtains was too bright, too clean, like the kind of light you see in a painting rather than in real life. I blinked against it, my neck stiff from the unforgiving mattress.

Grace was already awake, sitting cross-legged at the end of the bed. On her lap was a phone book, and she was staring intently at it, flipping through it.

“Whatcha doing, Grace?” I yawned.

“Great, you’re awake, there’s a cup of coffee on the nightstand for you.” She said it with her neutral tone, the one she used when she was in thought.

“I’m going through the phone book, trying to find an address for my parents’ place, but I’m struggling to find anything.”

I took a sip of the coffee, slightly lukewarm. It had been sitting there for a while.

"Nothing under their last names?" I asked, peering over her shoulder.

"That's the weird part." She ran her finger down a page. "There's no McDuffie. No listings at all. And it’s the same with my dad's family name, Moore.”

"Maybe they lived with relatives? Or used a different address?"

Grace closed the phone book with a frustrated snap. "Maybe. I don't know. They never really talked about their living situation here. Just that they grew up in Hollowbend and left before things went bad." She paused. "I think my dad said something about a railroad accident.”

“Maybe a train derailed and killed everyone in town in one swoop,” I said between sips of coffee, making a big swiping motion with my hand.

Grace smiled slightly, “I doubt it’s that simple.” She started again, looking through the book furiously. I could see that the lack of information was driving her crazy, so I thought of something quick to give her drive.

“How about we just ask people about your parents? Surely someone in this town knows them. Small town, right? Everyone knows everyone.” I said optimistically.

“Yeah,” she said, “If they grew up here, there has to be someone who knew them.” She paused. “Unless people are just going to keep dodging my questions the way they always did.”

We cleaned up as best we could in the tiny bathroom, which had a mirror that showed our reflections slightly darker than they should be, like we were looking at ourselves through tinted glass. The shower had only cold water, and the soap smelled like it had been sitting there since the motel opened.

We made our way back downstairs. Alastair and Everlyn were gone, but the front desk bell sat gleaming, polished so much it reflected like a mirror.

Outside, Hollowbend was already busy. People swept their front porches, cars from another era trundled down the street, and kids pedalled past on bikes with streamers fluttering. Everyone moved with a kind of precision, like they were each hitting marks on an invisible stage.

Grace squinted toward the church spire at the end of Main Street. “We’ll start at the records office. If my parents really lived here, we would find something there.”

We made our way down, returning all the greetings we were collecting from locals all the way down Main Street, each one offered the same identical warmth. The town had seemed to grow slightly overnight. There were extra buildings that we hardly noticed the previous day.

A jazz club now dominated the block, its art deco facade towering over the modest shopfronts around it. Neon tubing spelled out "**The Encore**" in sweeping cursive, dark now in the daylight but unmistakably present. The building looked like it had always been there, worn into the street's memory, yet I was certain we'd walked past this exact spot yesterday and seen nothing but a vacant lot.

The records office sat tucked between a barber shop and a laundromat, easy to miss if you weren't looking for it. The building was narrow, almost apologetically small, but when we pushed through the door, the interior stretched back impossibly far. The front desk dominated the cramped entryway, an enormous oak monstrosity that seemed salvaged from a building three times this size.

Grace reached out and rang the small brass bell sitting on the desk's surface.

A woman erupted from behind the counter so suddenly that we both jumped. She hadn't stood up, she'd launched herself upward, like she'd been coiled beneath the desk, waiting. Her black hair was pinned in a tight bun, and her smile was wide, too wide.

"Oh my!" she exclaimed, pressing her hands together. "Visitors! How wonderful!" She moved around the desk with that unnatural speed we'd come to expect, closing the distance between us in what felt like a single step. "I'm Dorothy. I live just down the street. Betty mentioned you two at book club last night."

“Oh wow, that’s nice,” Grace said, trying to be polite.

"Nice indeed! Now, what can I do for this lovely young couple?"

“Oh, we’re not a…” I started to say before Grace pushed me aside. "I'm trying to find some information about my parents. They used to live here. I don't have an address, so I thought maybe the records might help."

Dorothy clasped her hands together, practically vibrating with enthusiasm. "Well, of course! In a small town like Hollowbend, everyone knows everyone. What are your parents' names, dear?"

“Graham Moore and Marcee McDuffie!”, Grace said, the names tumbling out quickly, like she'd been holding them back.

Dorothy stopped and started thinking. She stopped for so long I thought all that thinking broke her brain until,

"Moore and McDuffie..." She drew the names out slowly, "Nope, I don't think I know anyone by those names."

Grace's face fell. "Are you sure? Graham Moore, he would be in his twenties. And Marcee McDuffie…."

"McDuffie," Dorothy repeated, her brow furrowing slightly. "That's an unusual name. I don't recall it at all, and I've lived here my whole life." She said it matter-of-factly, just stating what she believed to be true.

"But you said everyone knows everyone," I pointed out.

Dorothy nodded pleasantly. "Oh, I do know everyone, dear. But I'm afraid I don't know those names. Perhaps they lived here before my time? Though that seems unlikely, I've been here since I was born in '54." She paused, tapping her chin thoughtfully. "Have you tried asking Mr Holloway? Holloway might know. He's been around longer than anyone. You can usually find him dancing it up at The Encore." She then did a small little jig, getting caught up in her own words.

Grace's hands gripped the edge of the massive desk. "They lived here. They grew up here in the '70s and '80s."

"Well, I was certainly here then," Dorothy said, sounding genuinely apologetic now. "I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. She gave a small, sympathetic smile.

“Can we still check the records, just in case?” I stepped in, trying to offer a solution while Grace quietly spiralled.

Dorothy gave that same enthusiastic smile, “Why of course, not everyone’s perfect. Especially me.” She laughed a little too loudly at her own joke, the sound echoing off the walls of the cramped office.

She bustled over to the filing cabinets lining the back wall, pulling open drawer after drawer with practised efficiency. "Let's see... Moore, Moore, Moore..." Her fingers walked through the tabs. "Ah! Here we are. Moore family records."

She pulled out a thick folder and brought it to the desk, spreading it open. Inside were birth certificates, school records, property deeds, a whole family tree's worth of documentation. Grace and I leaned in, scanning the names.

Moore, Albert. Moore, Catherine. Moore, Douglas. Moore, Elizabeth. The list went on, a dozen different Moores spanning decades.

But no Graham.

"And McDuffie..." Dorothy returned to the cabinets, her fingers searching. She paused, pulled out a drawer completely, and peered behind it. Pushed it back in and tried another. "That's strange. I don't see a McDuffie file at all."

"Maybe it's misfiled?" I suggested.

"Perhaps." Dorothy didn't sound convinced, but she began methodically checking each drawer, pulling out folders and flipping through their tabs. Grace and I watched in silence as she worked her way through the entire wall of cabinets.

Ten minutes passed. Then fifteen.

Finally, Dorothy straightened up, wiping her hands on her skirt. "I'm afraid there's nothing here. No McDuffie records at all. And while there are plenty of Moores, none named Graham in the right age range." She looked genuinely troubled now, like the absence of these records bothered her on some fundamental level. "That shouldn't be possible. Everyone who has lived in Hollowbend is included in these files. Everyone."

Grace's hands were gripping the edge of the desk so tightly her knuckles had gone pale against her brown skin. "They were here," she said quietly, but firmly. "My parents grew up here. They met here. They left together in the early '90s."

Dorothy tilted her head, considering. “The early 90s? Isn’t that right now silly?” She then let out a chuckle. Dorothy's expression remained sympathetic but puzzled. "I wish I could help more, dear. It's just so strange that there's no record at all. In a town this size, everyone leaves a paper trail." She glanced back at the filing cabinets as if they might have hidden the files from her. "Perhaps they used different names? Or maybe they lived just outside town limits?"

Grace and I exchanged a glance. We both knew that wasn't it.

“Well, thanks for your help, Dorothy,” I said, trying to hide the disappointment.

“Any time, dears. Hope you find what you’re looking for.” She said, smiling once again.

We walked out of the records office, sitting down on the small stairs, and just sat in silence for a moment, waiting for an idea to come to us. I looked over at Grace; she was clenching her hands so tightly her knuckles had gone pale against her brown skin. She looked like she was wrecked from that conversation.

“I know they lived here; I know it.” She whispered to herself, voice raw. “Why would they lie to me?”

"Hey, hey," I said, reaching out to grasp her hands, trying to pull my friend back from the edge of her spiral. "It'll be okay. We'll find them, I know it."

"You don't know it, Marc," she snapped, pulling her hands free. The stress, the dead ends, the pure strangeness. It had finally broken through her control. "You don't know anything right now."

The silence that followed was heavy and sharp. I had no response, no comforting lie left to offer. I was staring blindly at the dusty street when Grace stood up abruptly, pointing across the road.

"We can't just sit here," she muttered, her eyes landing on a blank neon sign above a heavy wooden door. "We need a move. Any move."

 

We pushed through the double doors of The Encore, a desperate, anxious energy propelling us forward, convinced the answers to our mounting questions must lie within. Whatever we'd pictured, a dingy bar, a bustling community centre, this town, as always, had a surprise waiting.

A small, hand-painted sign near the entrance declared: **"Ballroom Dancing: 1:00 - 2:30 pm."**

The main space was vast, dimly lit, and hushed, the air thick with a faint, musty scent and the quiet, melancholy strains of Shostakovich’s *“Suite for Jazz Orchestra No. 2.”* Instead of a crowded dance floor, we found a scattering of elderly men in stark, black suits. They moved with agonising slowness, their polished shoes gliding across the worn parquet.

Each man held an empty black dress. The fabric, heavy and formal, was draped over their arms, the high necklines resting near their chests. They didn't just carry the dresses; they danced with them, swaying and leading the lifeless material with an almost painful tenderness, as if a genuine, breathing partner was nestled in their embrace.

The entire scene was a deeply unsettling, private ritual. It was certainly the most off-putting and profoundly lonely sight we had encountered in a town that seemed determined to peel back the layers of normalcy and replace them with something deeply, irrevocably strange.

The sudden, grizzled voice scraped against the quiet melancholy of the ballroom, making both Grace and I jump.

“Do you care to join us?”

We spun around. Behind us stood a man, late seventies, with a patchy grey beard and long, slicked-back hair pulled into a thin ponytail. He was as skinny as a lamppost, and his black suit, clearly made for a man a few sizes larger, seemed to weigh him down, making him move slower than he already did. A thick silver ring glinted on his index finger.

“We’re looking for a Mr. Holloway,” Grace said, her voice strained but direct. She was clearly ready to get this painful day over with.

“That would be I.” He stepped slightly to the side and carefully placed the empty black dress he had been cradling down onto a nearby velvet chair. He smoothed the skirt and adjusted the neckline, propping the dress up so it looked like a woman was sitting, waiting for him to return.

“What can I do you for?” He asked grimly, his eyes narrow and assessing.

Grace took a small, steadying breath. "We were hoping you could tell us about some people who might've lived here. Graham Moore and Marcee McDuffie?"

Holloway inspected our faces for a couple of seconds, taking every detail of our faces into his head, trying to place us. The silence stretched, filled only by the quiet, funereal music and the rhythmic *shh-shh* of gliding shoes.

“Moore and McDuffie.” He grumbled. “Moore, I know, funny fella, but a bit yellow. McDuffie, I don’t, but it must be that girly I’ve seen him run around with.” He gestured dismissively toward Grace.

Grace and I looked at each other. Finally, we had a tangible piece of information. A flicker of hope ignited in Grace’s eyes.

“Do you know where they’re staying or live?” I asked with confidence.

Holloway scuffed his face up a bit.

“Odd thing to say, don’t ask stuff you already know ‘bout.”

My heart seized. "We don't, though. We wouldn't be here asking if we did," I insisted, the confidence draining away fast. "They're Grace's... relatives. We just need to know if they're still in Hollowbend."

Holloway smiled, but it was a cold, humourless expression. He looked back at the empty black dress on the velvet chair, his gaze lingering. “They all settle eventually. Maybe in Friendly Pines, they always kept better records than I did. Or maybe, they’re still here, waiting for their turn on the floor.” He subtly nodded toward the dancers, each man now a portrait of lonely devotion.

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Grace let out, taking her frustration out on the man.

With that same smile, Holloway took a step back and, with a subtle bow, retrieved the empty black dress from the chair, smoothing its fabric with painful devotion.

"Go ask about the Davises at the motel," he said, turning away, his voice now formal and final. "They always seem to check in at the same time as you." He began to sway, leading his lifeless partner back into the slow, endless orbit of the dance floor.

I grabbed Grace and motioned her to the door. We fled The Encore, leaving the unsettling music and the dark, knowing gaze of Mr Holloway behind us.

We stumbled out into the street, lungs dragging in the sharp night air. It had been noon when we entered The Encore. Harsh sunlight had poured down, bright and relentless. Now the sky was deep indigo, the lampposts humming faintly, their pale-yellow glow too weak to chase away the sudden dark. Time had slipped past us like water through open fingers.

The streets were still crowded, but quieter than before. People drifted in slow, deliberate patterns, sweeping porches, walking dogs, leaning in close to share unheard jokes. Their mouths moved, but their voices never carried. It was as if the night itself swallowed every sound whole.

Grace’s face was pale and tight, her jaw working as if chewing words she couldn’t bring herself to spit out. “That man…” she muttered. “He knew them. He *knew them*, Marc. But the way he said it… I don’t even...” She cut herself off with a sharp shake of her head.

I glanced back at the skyline, my chest tightening. “Grace… shouldn’t it still be early afternoon? We weren’t in there *that* long.”

She didn’t answer. Her eyes had already locked on the neon-green sign of the Friendly Pines Motel, glowing like a sick beacon at the end of the street. Whatever had just happened with the sky didn’t matter to her anymore. She just needed answers. She just needed her parents.

We walked in silence, the air thick with unspoken dread. The motel loomed larger the closer we got, its flickering sign buzzing like a dying signal. Each step toward it felt heavier, as though the pavement itself resisted our weight, pulling at our shoes, trying to hold us back.

Entering the motel felt completely different from how it had previously. Gone were the eccentric welcomings of the flamboyant Mr. DuPont. The grand staircase remained, the chandeliers still swayed slightly overhead, but the place felt hollow, like a theatre stage after the audience has gone home. The air was stale, faintly sweet, as though the lemon polish smell from before had curdled. Shadows pooled in corners that should’ve been lit, stretching longer than the lights allowed. The ticking of the grandfather clock in the lobby echoed too loudly in the stillness, each beat hammering.

Everlyn, still in her usual attire, stood at the front desk, smoking out of a long black cigarette holder. The sequins of her dress caught the chandelier light in fractured bursts, but they looked dulled somehow, like reflections off tarnished glass. She didn’t acknowledge us at first, just exhaled a slow stream of smoke that curled upward and dissolved before it ever reached the ceiling.

When her eyes finally met ours, gone was her usual contempt; instead, there was a look of vague melancholy.

“What do you two want?” she said, her voice flat, drained of its previous venom. She tapped the cigarette ash delicately into an empty glass.

“We were told to find the Davises; they might be staying here as well?” I asked.

Everlyn barely acknowledging our question, took a long drag, and quietly thought about the question.

"Yeah, they're here. Room 6. Up the stairs, second floor, end of the hall. Can't miss it." " She said, and went back to staring at nothing in particular, her cigarette burning down between her fingers.

"Thank you," Grace said softly.

Everlyn didn't respond. Just took another drag, her eyes distant, watching something we couldn't see.

We climbed the grand staircase, our footsteps muffled by the thick red carpet. The chandeliers above swayed faintly, though no air stirred. Halfway up, I glanced back, Everlyn hadn’t moved. She was still at the desk, frozen in that same posture, smoke rising steadily from her cigarette like a motionless painting.

The second-floor hallway stretched longer than it should have, lined with identical doors, each with a brass number plate. The wallpaper here was the same faded floral pattern as our room, peeling at the corners where moisture had crept in. A faint hum threaded the silence, like power lines carrying too much current.

Room 6 was at the very end, just as Everlyn had said.

Grace knocked. Three soft raps.

Silence.

She knocked again, louder this time. “Hello? Mr. and Mrs. Davis?”

Still nothing.

Her hand closed on the knob. Miraculously, it turned.

She looked at me, exhaustion hollowing her features, then pushed the door open.

The room was nearly identical to the “Suite”: same chair, same bed, same nightstand. Same faded wallpaper peeling at the corners. Same thin brown carpet worn through to the backing. But it lacked all the subtle signs of life. No clothes draped over furniture. No stack of books. No travel bags. No imprint of anyone ever staying there.

Except for one glaring thing.

Wrapped in a cloth on the bed was a baby. Brown skin. A tuft of black curly hair. She couldn’t have been more than a few months old.

Grace’s breath hitched. She stepped forward as though pulled by an invisible thread, her eyes locked on the child.

“Marc,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “That’s… me.”

I blinked, staring between her and the infant. “Grace, it’s just a baby. You don’t know that.”

But I did know. The resemblance was too sharp, even in miniature. The slope of the nose, the heavy-lidded eyes that seemed to carry more weight than they should. And when the baby stirred, stretching her tiny arms, her mouth curved into a half-formed expression I’d seen on Grace a hundred times before: that quiet, knowing grimace she wore whenever she was about to call me out.

Grace crouched at the bedside, hands trembling as she brushed the edge of the cloth. The baby didn’t cry. Instead, she blinked up at Grace with calm, unblinking focus.

“She knows me,” Grace whispered. Her voice cracked on the words. “She is me.”

I swallowed, my throat dry. “If that’s true… then what the hell is she doing here? What’s she doing with the Davises?”

Grace didn’t answer right away. She lifted the baby into her arms, her movements instinctive, protective. The child settled against her chest, small breaths rising and falling in perfect rhythm with Grace’s own.

Grace lifted the baby closer, her voice breaking as she whispered, “Why leave her here? Why would they just abandon her?”

Before I could answer, a sound shivered through the room, a low, distant rumble that seemed to come from under the floorboards. For a moment, I thought it was a train, but the sound dragged too long, metallic and grinding, like iron against stone.

The baby stirred, letting out a sharp cry that sliced through the silence.

Grace froze, her arms tightening around the child. “Marc… that wasn’t normal.”

I nodded, my stomach churning. “Yeah. Sounded like… something heavy. Like… tracks?”

But there were no tracks near the motel. The nearest line ran miles out of town. Even if a train passed, we shouldn’t have felt it this strongly.

The chandelier above us swayed faintly, its crystals chiming together like teeth clicking in the dark. Then, as suddenly as it began, the tremor died, leaving only the faint sound of the baby’s breathing.

Grace looked at me, her face pale, drawn tight. “This place… nothing here makes sense.”

She cradled the baby against her chest, rocking her instinctively.

“We can’t stay here,” I whispered.

Grace tore her gaze from the infant, blinking as though she’d forgotten I was in the room. “We’re not leaving her.”

“Grace, we gotta….”

“She’s me, Marc. Don’t you see? If the Davises left her, if they left *me*, then I have to know why. I have to find them.”

The baby had stopped crying now, and for a moment, I swore she looked right at me with Grace’s same tired expression. A shiver slid down my spine.

We left Room 6 and stepped back into the hallway. Except it wasn’t the same hallway. The wallpaper pattern had shifted, curling vines now where there had been faded roses. The brass numbers on the doors had tarnished to black. And the hall stretched on longer than before, so long that the chandelier lights dwindled into pinpricks.

Grace held the baby close as we walked. Her breathing was quick, shallow, as though the air itself pressed against her lungs. I trailed half a step behind, my eyes darting from door to door, every one of them shut tight, brass numbers blackened as if scorched.

The further we went, the more the hall seemed to resist us. The carpet thickened underfoot, dragging at our shoes like wet moss. The air grew warmer, heavy with a cloying perfume that reminded me of funeral parlours.

“Grace…” I murmured. “We passed that door already.”

“No, we didn’t,” she shot back, her voice hard. “We’re almost at the stairs. You weren’t paying attention.”

But I knew she was wrong. The number **4** had appeared twice now, crooked on the frame, dark with tarnish. I didn’t argue. Her knuckles were pale against the swaddle of cloth in her arms, and I could see where her fingernails had dug tiny half-moons into her skin.

Finally, the hallway opened onto the staircase, just as suddenly as if we’d stepped through a curtain. I looked back, but the corridor behind us was gone. Only a blank stretch of faded wallpaper and two identical doors faced us, like we had never walked that distance at all.

Grace didn’t pause. She started down the stairs, the baby held firm against her shoulder. I followed, each step groaning under my weight, though Grace’s feet made no sound.

The lobby waited below, the chandelier swaying faintly, throwing restless shadows over the walls. Everlyn was still at the desk, her cigarette holder balanced in her fingers, but the smoke curled upward in perfect spirals, unnaturally neat, vanishing before it touched the ceiling.

She didn’t look at us. Didn’t speak. Just tapped ash into the glass, eyes fixed on some invisible spot far above our heads.

“Grace,” I whispered. “Something’s wrong with her.”

“Everything’s wrong here,” she hissed back. “We need the Davises. They’ll know what this means.” She glanced down at the baby; her face caught between awe and despair. “They *have* to.”

For a second, I thought she might confront Everlyn again, demand more answers. But instead, she walked straight past the desk and into the street, the automatic doors parting with a sigh.

Outside, night had deepened. The streetlamps hummed, halos of sickly yellow light flickering against the dark. People still moved along the sidewalks, but it was wrong.. Their movements had lost all naturalness; each step too measured, each turn of the head too smooth. Their faces were pale in the lamp-glow, skin waxy and translucent, turned slightly away from us as if they couldn't quite bear to look directly. Like mannequins arranged in lifelike poses by someone who'd only read about human behaviour in books. None of them looked right. The once inviting townsfolk were now decaying and fading away right before us.

Grace pulled her jacket tighter, shifting the baby into the crook of her arm. “We’ll ask around. Someone’s seen them. Someone has to know.”

I swallowed, staring at the people on the sidewalk. None of them looked right. The once inviting townsfolk looked like they were decaying and fading away.

“Excuse me, can you please help me? We’re looking for the Davises.” Grace said desperately to one of the almost people. The man slowly turned to Grace, smiled a half-toothless grin, "Love...ly da..y," he rasped, the words coming out in segments, like a recording played at the wrong speed.

Chunks of skin were missing, revealing patches of something grey and papery underneath. His smile, when he offered it, showed gaps where teeth should have been, the remaining ones yellow and loose in receding gums. His clothes hung loose on frames that were growing thinner, more insubstantial. Fabric bagged and sagged over which reminded me of Holloway. Holloway.

“We need to find Holloway; he might know something,” I said.

"The Encore," Grace said. "He was at The Encore."

Without warning, a tremor came again, faint but unmistakable, rattling up through the soles of my shoes. The streetlamps flickered. Somewhere far off, metal screamed.

Grace’s eyes found mine. For the first time all day, she looked afraid.
