“Your brother built a sex bot.”

“...What?

“He built a sex bot, Andrew,” my mom said, through a waterfall of tears. “He built a sex bot and now he’s up in his room…*being* *intimate* with it.”

Dad stormed into the lounge, yelling, “Didn’t I say you were coddling the boy? How many times? But you just had to let him sit on his arse playing Pokémans all day. Well congratulations, now he’s fucking one of ‘em.”

Gary and I had always been close, so my parent’s first instinct had been to call me. As kids we’d spent our weekends and summers climbing trees and competing over the ‘Mario Kart championship’, a belt we made out of glue, cardboard, and some spare glitter. Unfortunately, the six-year age gap meant I could never help him with his social issues. He changed schools three times, mostly because of bullies, and by the tender age of twenty-three he’d never once been on a date. He lived with our parents in their three-bedroom house where he barricaded himself in his room, detached from reality.

Twenty head-scratching minutes later, I’d come no closer to getting a grasp on the situation. I went upstairs. Behind a door covered in Doctor Who posters, Gary was at his desk, surrounded by anime figurines. Although we both had our mother’s dirty blonde hair and dimples, he stood a head taller. He carried a little extra weight, although the bulk underneath gave him the appearance of an ex-rugby player.

I said, “Alright, what the hell’s going on?”

A soft, two-note chime rang out. Resting on the desk there was a heart-shaped box, roughly the size of my closed fist. Gary scooped it up and sighed. “Mom was cleaning my room earlier and she found…this.”

The heart opened up like a music box. Inside there were two screens, one on each compartment, and from the top half a lady pretty enough to win a million beauty contests waved at me.

“Ohmygosh you must be Andrew,” she said, fists trembling with excitement. “Garys told me *soooooooooooo* much about you.” Visible from the chest up and silhouetted against a pink background, she had an oval face, wide cheekbones, and chestnut hair.

“Andrew, this is Valorie. My girlfriend.”

“I can’t believe we’re finally meeting in the flesh,” the virtual avatar said. “Or, I mean, not flesh. I mean, you know what I mean. Gahhhh this is so exciting.”

“She’s an A.I. virtual chatbot.”

“I prefer the term digividual,” she said.

“Sorry babe, *digividual*. We’re dating.”

“…Are you taking the mick?” I asked.

“Taking the mick?” the virtual lady replied.

Gary rotated the screen towards him. “It means playing a joke babe.”

“Ahh, thanks babe. No, you’re not—NO HE’S NOT ANDREW.”

I pinched the bridge of my nose, trying to keep a nasty migraine from setting in. “For the love of all that is holy, start at the beginning.”

Somehow my brother had landed himself a role as a product tester for a product named ‘Valent-AI-ne’. I asked if I could see the device, which had some real heft to it. I remember thinking you’d break a few toes if it dropped on your foot. As Gary described Valorie’s quirks and mannerisms, his face lit up, and he seemed happy, *genuinely* happy, possibly for the first time since we were young. He showed off all the different features, like augmenting ‘Val’ into a video feed of himself, so it looked like they were cuddling, or blowing on the bottom screen to ruffle her hair.

“So what do you think?” Valorie asked. “Are we cute, or are we cute?”

After a long pause, I said, “I’m gonna go check Dad hasn’t had a stroke.”

In the lounge, my parents were on their second bottle of wine. “I’m gonna beat that moron over the head with that thing,” Dad sneered.

I pulled out my phone. There were articles online about people in relationships with A.I. companions, mostly in Japan, although zero scientific studies had been done on the phenomenon. The manufacturers didn’t list the product on their website, although their socials hinted at a ‘top secret’ product set to launch later this year.

I said, “I know this is strange, but at least he’s not getting catfished by some 300lb dude from Australia. How about we book an appointment with that therapist he used to see?”

“You two do what you like,” Dad snapped. “I’m washing my hands of this shit.”

As it turned out, Gary’s former therapist wouldn’t meet with him unless he *voluntarily* engaged with her, which he refused to do. Six more mental health professionals said the same thing: get him onboard or we’d just be wasting everybody’s time.

The next time Gary visited my place for a Smash Bros session, I said, “So Mom tells me you’re staying up late these days?” 

“Yeah, Val gets anxious sometimes. If she can’t sleep we chat until she feels better.”

“…She gets anxious?”

From the armrest, his computer-generated girlfriend said, “Of course. Doesn’t everybody?” The two of them had become a regular package deal, quickly developing an aggressively private way of interacting; their language was coded in inside jokes and nicknames. Now and again, Val would say a word like ‘frisbee’ or ‘jamble’ then they’d both get set giggling.

To Gary, I said, “But why stay up? Couldn’t she wait until morning? I mean she isn’t real.”

Gary paused the game. “So now *you’re* gonna make fun of me too? It’s not bad enough Dad keeps acting like a dick?”

Judging by his expression, he was genuinely hurt by my remark. “You’re right. Forget I said anything. Val’s great.”

“Don’t tell me, tell her.”

My eyes flicked between the pair. “Uhh, you’re pretty great…Val.”

“Damn right.”

Next time I invited him over, he said, “I dunno, Val got pretty bored last time. Why don’t we try a calligraphy? She’s *great* at calligraphy.”

In the weeks that followed, Gary seemed to adopt whatever hobbies his ‘girlfriend’ suggested. He also went without a haircut, and according to Mom slid from reeking of stale sweat to an openair fish-market on the hottest day of the year. As for Dad, if anybody asked he only had one son.

But when Mom’s 60th birthday rolled around, as a gift, she requested the entire family go to her favourite restaurant, Marconi’s Bar & Grill. As we browsed our menus in a corner booth, that two-note chime rang out, then Gary flicked open the gadget and conversed with Val, oblivious to our parents’ death glares. “Babe, I’m thinking about trying the Sirloin.”

“Nah, have the pan roasted chicken supreme babe.”

“Ah, good call.”

To his credit, Dad’s temper didn’t boil over until later when the waiter arrived carrying the cake, singing happy birthday. As the rest of us took up the chant, Mom’s face turned beetroot. She blew out the candles, everyone clapped, then Dad handed the waiter his phone and asked him to take a picture.

“Wait,” Gary said, opening the heart.

“Gary,” Dad said, in a firm tone that conveyed annoyance. “Put the toy away.”

“Valorie’s *not* a toy,” he answered, his expression darkening. Sensing Mom’s special night was in jeopardy, I said, “Dad, it’s okay, we can—”

“You’ve got five seconds Gary. Four.”

The waiter’s eyes shifted between us. “I can come back later?”

“Three.”

“Why do you always have to put him down like that?” All eyes settled on the virtual avatar.

“Excuse me?” 

“I’m just gonna say it: you’re a TERRIBLE father.”

“Let me tell you something, if you think—" Dad shook himself alert. “Why the FUCK am I arguing with a Nintendo?” His hand reached for Val, but Gary snatched the heart away and held our father at arm’s length. Plates and cutlery got knocked off the table and clattered against the floor as they jostled around, then around the restaurant conversations tapered off as heads swivelled in our direction.

Before their scuffle could escalate any further Mom threw down her napkin and marched toward the exit, mortified.

“Look what you did you little shit,” Dad fumed, as he hurried off after her.

To the bemused waiter, I said, “Can we just have the cheque please?”

“I’m such a loser, I fuck everything up,” Gary said, in the passenger’s side of my car.

Perched on the dashboard, Val said, “No, you’re not babe. That was all your dad’s fault. Right Andrew?” 

“Can you pause that thing for a sec?” I asked Gary.

“Why?” he protested. “Anything you wanna say to me you can say to Val.”

“Just turn it off.” I reached out, but Gary pulled on my wrist so hard the car veered onto the far side of the road, then a set of headlights came rolling toward us. At the very last second, I shifted back into the correct lane.

Sitting across from me, his hulking frame seemed to fill the cabin. I became painfully aware of the fact I hadn't been able to out-wrestle him since he hit that growth spurt at age twelve. But I told myself he'd never hurt me. That we had too strong a connection.

Even still, it was an uncomfortable rest of the ride to our parents’ house…

From that day forward, Gary went days at a time without speaking to anybody who didn’t need a power adapter, and he became our town’s walking punchline when some local teens realized he wasn’t having a picnic with a real-life girlfriend over Video chat, but rather an electronic character. Terrified where all this might lead, I did my best to contact Val's manufacturers who (suprise, suprise) foisted me off to an A.I. response bot. I started losing sleep. I lay awake at night, confused whether I should be more scared for my brother or my parents.

Then last week, he turned up at my door late one night, Val in hand. “Bro, can we come in? It’s really important.”

I could tell he’d been crying. I brought him through to the lounge. As a jittery Gary set his girlfriend on the mantlepiece above the fireplace, I noticed the knuckles on his right hand looked all bruised and swollen. “What the hell happened?”

“I don’t know, it all happened so fast.” He rubbed his hands together, pacing back and fourth.

“Gary was incredible,” Valorie said.

I pinched the bridge of my nose. “Start at the beginning.”

He shifted nervously from foot to foot. “Okay, so I wanted to buy a leather jacket for Val, but I don’t have any money left, so I borrowed Dad’s credit card. It was only gonna be until payday. Then I’d make him square. But he woke up and turned into a complete psycho.”

“A leather jacket? Gary, Val’s an A.I.”—his jaw clenched, so quickly I said—“I mean she’s a *digividual*. How would you buy her a jacket?”

“Show him babe.”

With a flash of blue light, Val changed into a leather jacket and a choke chain. My eyes whipped between him and the avatar. “You can buy her shit?”

His eyes practically sparkled as he said, “They launched an e-store.” On-screen, Val changed outfits with a series of flashes. There was a sundress, a swimsuit, and a crop top, each obscured by a giant padlock. 

“Show him what I got you for Christmas,” he said, his voice breaking a little. He sounded anxious.

Another flash, then sparkling diamonds trailed from the avatar’s ears.

“Wait…you’re telling me you’re spaffing money up the wall on that thing?”

As if on cue, my phone rang. It was Mom. “You brother’s gone mad. I’m at the hospital now with your father, he’s breathing through a bloody respirator. They can’t get him to wake up.”

“What hospital? What are you talking about?”

“Gary attacked him! Sixteen broken bones he’s got. Now he’s…wait, the surgeon needs to speak with me.”

“Hello? Mom?” I looked at Gary. “You put Dad in the fucking ER?”

“He attacked me,” Valorie said from the mantlepiece.

Gary nodded. “It’s true. He tried to kill her. You’ve gotta help us. The police, they won’t understand.”

*Kill her*? Almost against my own will, I started laughing. “Okay, this has gone too far.”

As my arm reached out, Gary’s clamped the wrist, his expression suddenly darkening. “Leave. Val. Alone.”

Softening my voice, I said, “Why not let her have a little snooze while we straighten this mess out?”

With a stiff shove, he sent me careening back. “You just wanna shut her down, don’t you? Let me guess: Dad put you up to this?”

“Put me up to what?”

“Don’t act all innocent. You hate Val, don’t you?”

“*Hate* her?” I choked out a laugh. The rage had been bubbling up inside me for months. Now it erupted. “How could I hate her, she’s a fucking video game!”

“I knew it. You and Dad, you’re in this together. You’re trying to get rid of her. She’s all I’ve got and you’re trying to get rid of her.” He stepped forward, solid and imposing. For a moment we faced each other in absolute silence. A showdown.

Then, Valorie screamed, “Kick his ass babe.”

In a wild fury, Gary lashed out. His fists connected with my jaw, my forehead, my neck. I answered every shot as best I could, but it quickly became obvious he had the advantage. He threw himself at me then we went round and round before he drove me backwards, my head thudding against the wall. The room and everything in it blurred, and when my vision settled two bulky hands had clamped shut around my windpipe, tight. Pressure started building inside my skull and I couldn’t push off the wall. There was enough venom in my brother’s expression that I could tell he wasn’t gonna release me, no matter what.

On my right, Val screamed, “Kill him babe.”

My hand rose to the mantlepiece and spider-walked along, stretching as far as it could go. The fingertips brushed along the edge of the heart, which inched closer and closer, and when my hand grabbed hold of what it sought, I brought it down across Gary’s right temple in a fierce arc.

I remember thinking dropping the device on your foot would break a few toes. Turned out, it was *also* enough to give a full-grown man-child a full-on concussion. My baby brother collapsed on the floor in a staggered heap, letting me draw some air.

“GARRRY,” a fractured Val squealed as she fell from my hand and thumped to the rug. A few good stomps later, and my brother officially became single once again.

Our scuffle left the idiot with six stitches, plus a one-way ticket to the psych ward. Dad needed to have the bones in his leg reset and won’t be able to eat solid foods anytime soon.

Over the course of these past few days, we found out that—in the space of four months—Gary squandered £5,000 on virtual gifts, clothes, and accessories for Valorie. Valent-AI-ne called the co-dependency he developed with their virtual chatbot ‘impossible’ and threatened legal action for even implying she encouraged Gary to kill me.

So far as I can tell, they're going ahead with their [product launch later this year...](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)
