Before starting this story, I highly suggest reading my previous post that states the rules for surviving the night shift at the call centre. This post will make a lot more sense afterwords.

My name is u/kinky_boy69, and I'm a first year college student in Tokyo, Japan. 

I recently shifted to a new building complex and took an apartment for rent, but 3 months later the owner had to move in for reason blah blah blah and I had to move out. But, thankfully he didn't leave me homeless, and offered me another apartment on the ninth floor, apartment 999. 

This had me confused, because even though there were 10 apartments a floor, they usually followed the format 100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109. So it was very weird to find apartment 999 and not apartment 909.

But being a homeless and broke college student, I decided to leave my paranoia with my old apartment and accept whatever came my way. Apartment 999 was going to be my new home. 

This brings me to today, the movers and packers had just finished shifting my luggage to my new apartment, I hadn't even seen this apartment from the inside yet, but from what id heard it was to be better than my old apartment. My old apartment had 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a kitchen and a living, this was way more than enough for me as I was living alone and didnt really invite people over. 

As I was about to enter my new home I saw the landlord outside and had an.... Interesting conversation with him. 

"Maa, ichiyo kiyotsukete,ne" (Well be careful for one, okay) 

"Heh? Nande? " (What? Why?) 

"Sorewa... Miruba wakaru. " (Well.... You'll understand when you see) 

"Sou desuga.... Nanka kowakunarimashita" (I see... I'm kind of scared now) 

"Hahahaha soitsu wa ii koto da" (That's a good thing) 

"Sumimasen-? " (Excuse me-?) 

But before I could get an answer my landlord was inside the elevator and waving goodbye. Weird. 

*that was red flag number 1*

Now as I was standing right in front of my new apartment, ready to enter it and spend all day doing with it what I wish, I got a call from my boss. 


I work the evening shift at an American company called *Rodeo Electronics* and mainly handle their calls and customer service. My shift usually starts at 6 and ends by 9:45pm. The store stays shut from 9:45 to 10:00 so I've never really gotten to see who works the night shift. Anyway, back to the call from my boss. 

"Ahh u/kinky_boy69-kun! Warui kedo ima hatarakenaikana? Kanade-san wa na.... " He basically asked me to fill in a shift for a coworker Kanade-san. Kanade Hana is my senpai(senior) at this company and honestly the prettiest existence in this world. She is always nice and kind and her smile lights up the room. This kanade-san calling in sick? Impossible. 

*this was red flag number 2*

My boss asked me to fill in for the night shift but as I had work to complete for my college courses, I kindly rejected his offer. He said he would pay me 6x my hourly wage for covering the shift but if there's one thing I've learned from being a broke college student, it's that if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 

Okay, now back to the apartment. I whipped out my ginourmous nine inch co- sorry I meant keys and opened my house door. 

"Uwaaaa sugeee" (Wowww amazinggg) was ny only reaction to this absolute beaut of an apartment. It had 3 bedrooms and a study, a living room the size of my old apartment and a well furnishes kitchen! The only thing was that there was only one bathroom in the apartment. 

*that was red flag number 3, if something is too good to be true, it probably is.*

That's when, after keeping my handhelds down on the living room table, I found a note. 

. 

* Howdy chump! 

I'm so sorry to do this to you but you're the idiot who thought renting an apartment with the number 999 was a good idea. So listen up, you may think you're living alone but you're not. From now on you will have a roommate, a room mate named Ana! 

Now see, ana is a little special, but she's our pride and joy here at Rodeo Electronics. So if you do anything to upset her and she does retaliate, you will not come out alive and neither will your family. 

That being said, here's some rules to make sure everything goes hiddy-ho between the two of you! 
Do note, refer to rule number if anything goes wrong or if you miss any steps. 

1) Ana will be out of the house between times 9: 50pm and 6am. You MUST say goodbye and welcome back to her both times. And you must completely bow down in a submissive position. She will dissapear after you do so, and will go for her shift. 

2) do not, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, look ana in her face. She will not have her makeup on and will not appreciate someone looking at her in her messes up state. 

3) Ana will not interact with you. On the off chance she does, it will be because you made her mad. In that case just say your prayers. 

4) ana will be in her room most of the time. And she will cry a lot. Very loudly. If you react to it in any way shape or form, consider yourself dead. 

5) ana has your phone number. And once at about 5pm every day she will call you. Be sure to pick up her call and tell her exactly what you are doing and where you are that exact moment. 

6) after you do so, within your proximity 1 person will have a cardiovascular failiure. You must watch them die. Interfering with ana's work may turn you into her next victim. 

7) Ana will walk around the house twice a day. Those 2 times that she does, you will see her. But you won't see her, what you will see is- the first time, the person you love the most in this world. The second time, the person you hate the most in this world. 

8) while she is moving, if you so much as make a sound, consider yourself dead. 

9) there is no escape. You must live in this apartment for a minimum of 33 days. You're stuck. 

10)the event of having to read this should only occur if you fucked up. If you have, then don't worry, you will be completely safe! But, the day after you disobey the rules, one person you care about will die. The next day another two will die, the next another three, until on day 7, you are the victim. 

Good luck chump!*

As I held this note I started to tremble all over. My world began spinning at my feet and I started feeling light headed. And then I heard it. The crying. It sounded shallow, like the heart of the creature singing it. It sounded like what I imagined to be the cries of lost souls from hell. It sounded bad enough for me to write this.
