I’ve been working at a small, independent record shop for years now, so I’m no stranger to weird trades. Most of the time, it’s just the usual—old records, scratched-up albums, and some oddball items that never seem to have much value. But the trade I received last week, well… it’s something I’ll never forget.

It was a quiet afternoon when he came in—a man I can only describe as unsettling, though I’m not sure I can pinpoint exactly why. He was about average height, maybe a little shorter than I’d expect. His face was pale, a little gaunt, and he wore these dark, round sunglasses that made him look like he was trying to hide behind them. His hair was thin, receding, and he had a pencil-thin mustache. He was wearing gloves too—dark leather gloves, even though it wasn’t particularly cold outside.

He walked up to the counter, moving quickly but not hurriedly, like he was just trying to get something done and leave. Without saying a word, he placed a stack of records on the counter. He didn’t make eye contact, and I could tell he wasn’t interested in chatting.

“Just these,” he muttered.

I looked through the records as part of the store policy. We check the condition of everything before we accept trades to make sure people aren’t trying to rip us off with broken or scratched records. The first album I pulled out was Thriller. It’s a classic, sure, but it’s also one of those records that gets traded in all the time, usually in perfect condition.

But when I pulled the disc out of the sleeve, I immediately saw something was wrong.

It wasn’t Thriller at all. The record itself was black, no label. Just a crude, hand-drawn smiley face in the center, like something a kid would scribble in their notebook. The eyes were uneven, the smile too wide. It looked almost… wrong.

I looked up to tell the guy I couldn’t accept this record, but when I glanced around, he was already gone. Just the sound of the bell ringing meaning the door opened, no footsteps. He had just vanished.

I thought about going after him, but I didn’t. Something about him seemed off. It wasn’t like he’d shoplifted or anything; he’d just left behind a bunch of junk records. But still, I felt weird. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.

I decided to check the rest of the stack. Most of the records were typical—nothing too out of the ordinary. But then I found a Beatles for Sale album. The sleeve and cover were in perfect condition, but all the text on it was in a language I didn’t recognize. I didn’t bother looking too hard at the rest of the stack, but there was also a Bob Dylan record—Highway 61 Revisited—with no label at all. Just a blank black disc.

I felt a little uneasy about it. Why would someone trade in records like these? What was the deal with the Thriller album, and why did he leave it with that creepy smiley face on it?

Still, I couldn’t resist. I pulled out the Thriller record and put it on the turntable. I needed to know what it was.

The second the needle hit the vinyl, I heard a loud, distorted buzzing. Static, almost like it was coming through a broken speaker. Then it cleared up a bit, and I heard a drill. A low, whirring sound, followed by a scream. It wasn’t the kind of scream you hear in a movie, but something real.

“Please… stop…” I could barely hear the words over the noise. The sound of the drill started again, then more screaming. The audio was clear enough that I could make out the sounds of something—someone—in distress.

I pulled the needle off the record as fast as I could, but my hands were shaking. My heart was pounding in my chest. I turned the record over, hoping it was just a weird prank. But no. There was nothing. No label. No writing. Just that damn smiley face staring back at me.

I called the police right away. I was barely able to explain what had happened. They were skeptical at first, but when I played them the recording, they knew something was wrong. They seized the record, and then they took the rest of the stack too.

The next few hours were a blur of questions and paperwork. They didn’t tell me much, but I could see they were disturbed by what I had shown them. They didn’t know what the hell they were dealing with. They just told me to sit tight, that they’d be in touch.

I haven’t heard from them since.

They’re still looking for the guy. The man with the sunglasses, the pencil mustache, and the gloves. But they haven’t turned up anything. No prints, no clues. It’s like he was never even there.

The thing is, the police seized all of the records the man left behind. I don’t even want to think about what could be on the rest of them. If they’re anything like that Thriller disc, I’m not sure I want to know.

So now, I’m left wondering: What was this guy’s game? Did he want someone to find these records? Was he trying to send a message? Or was he just a complete idiot who thought nobody would notice what was on them?

I don’t know. But the thought that he’s still out there—and that I might have been his target—keeps me up at night.

Has anyone else had strange or terrifying experiences with records, or in a record shop? Please, if you have, tell me. I need to know I’m not the only one.
