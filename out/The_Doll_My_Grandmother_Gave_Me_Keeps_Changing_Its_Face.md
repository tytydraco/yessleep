When my grandmother died, she left me three things: a ring, a letter I was told never to open, and a porcelain doll named Lily. The doll had always sat on the mantle of her Georgia farmhouse, unmoving and pale, with glassy blue eyes that followed me a little too well when I was a kid. The day after the funeral, the lawyer handed me the box with Lily inside, swaddled in lace and wrapped so tightly it was like someone was trying to keep her from escaping.

I didn’t want it. I didn’t want her.

But I took her anyway.

At first, I kept Lily in the box in my closet, unopened, buried beneath a stack of old coats. But the dreams started three days later. I’d wake up in a cold sweat, remembering flashes—white fabric, long halls, wet scratching. Every time I opened my eyes, I’d find the closet door cracked open just an inch more than I remembered.

On the seventh night, I heard whispering.

Not words. Just breath and rasp.

I finally opened the box.

Lily looked the same at first—porcelain skin, delicate features, tiny red lips. But her eyes weren’t blue anymore. They were brown. Exactly like mine.

I thought I was remembering wrong. Dolls are creepy, sure. They play tricks on your brain. I laughed it off, told myself I was sleep-deprived. I put her on a shelf in my office.

She was facing the wall when I came back the next day.

I didn’t touch her.

That night, I dreamed of teeth.

Not falling out. Pulling out. One by one, like petals. Every molar wrapped in doll hair. And when I screamed in the dream, I swear I heard her voice echo from my own throat: “Aren’t you beautiful now?”

I woke up with hair in my mouth.

I tried getting rid of her. Drove Lily five miles out to a gas station dumpster at 3 a.m. Tossed her in. Came home, took a shower, cried for half an hour.

She was back on the shelf the next morning. Wearing a different dress.

I called my mom. She went quiet when I asked about the doll.

“She gave it a face once,” she whispered. “That’s why I moved out at 15. I told her not to pass it down.”

“What do you mean a face?”

But the line went dead.

The letter—the one I was never supposed to open—was in Lily’s lap now.

I don’t remember putting it there.

Inside was a single sentence, handwritten in my grandmother’s shaky script:
“Don’t say yes when she asks what you see.”

I didn’t sleep. I watched the doll all night. Her mouth twitched just once, right before dawn.

Then she asked:
“What do you see?”

I said nothing.

She grinned anyway.

Now everything is warping.

My walls are breathing. Colors smear like wet paint. Time loops. I’ll walk into the kitchen and come out of the bathroom. My reflection moves a second too slow. And Lily—God, Lily—has my childhood face now. Gap-toothed. Dimples. The one from old photos no one ever took.

Sometimes I hear my grandma’s voice through her, like she’s wearing her skin inside-out.

Sometimes Lily is bigger.

Sometimes I’m the one on the shelf, staring out.

This is the last thing I’m writing before I try to burn her. I don’t know if it’ll work. I don’t know if she’s fireproof or if I even still live in the world where matches exist. But if you ever find a porcelain doll with your face—and she asks what you see—

Lie.

And never, ever open the letter.
