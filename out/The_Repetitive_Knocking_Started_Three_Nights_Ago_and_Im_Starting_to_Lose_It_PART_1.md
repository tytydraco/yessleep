It started subtly, just after midnight three nights ago. A soft, almost hesitant knock coming from somewhere inside my apartment. I live alone on the third floor of a relatively new building, the kind with thin walls and even thinner promises of soundproofing. Still, the idea of someone being *inside* without me knowing sent a jolt of ice through me, a primal fear that clawed its way up my throat.

I froze, every sense on high alert, straining to hear anything beyond the frantic thumping of my own heart. Silence. The kind of oppressive silence that follows a sudden, sharp noise, amplifying every tiny creak and groan of the building. I told myself it was just the building settling, a normal occurrence in any structure finding its equilibrium. Or maybe a particularly strong gust of wind had rattled something outside, though the night had been eerily still. I tried to rationalize it away, to convince myself it was nothing, so I could finally succumb to the exhaustion pulling at my eyelids. But the image of a shadowy figure lurking in the corner of my room, unseen and unheard until that faint knock, kept my eyes wide open.

The next night, it happened again, almost the exact same time – 12:17 AM. This time, the knock was a little louder, more insistent. Three distinct taps, clear and unmistakable. *Knock. Knock. Knock.* It resonated through the quiet apartment, seeming to emanate from the wall directly behind my bed.

I couldn't dismiss it as easily this time. My breath hitched in my chest as I slowly, cautiously, swung my legs out of bed. The floorboards groaned under my weight, each sound amplified in the stillness. I pressed my ear against the cold plaster of the wall, straining to hear anything on the other side. Just the faint hum of electricity and the distant drone of city traffic. I checked the hallway, the small, dimly lit living room, even the cramped walk-in closet, pulling back hanging clothes with a trembling hand. Nothing. No sign of forced entry, no unusual shadows, just the familiar layout of my solitary existence. I went back to bed, leaving the bedside lamp on, its weak glow doing little to quell the growing unease. Sleep was a fractured, fitful thing, punctuated by every imagined sound.

Last night was worse. The knocking started earlier, around 11:45 PM. It was more frantic this time, a series of rapid, uneven taps, like someone impatiently drumming their fingers. *Knock-knock-knock-knock. Knock.* And then the unsettling realization: it was moving. I could hear it travel along the wall, a faint percussive sound tracing a path from behind my bed towards the corner of the room, near the window.

Panic began to bubble in my chest. I fumbled for my phone on the nightstand, my fingers clumsy and uncoordinated. I opened the contacts, hovering over the emergency number, ready to call the police. But what would I even say? "There's a knocking in my wall, officer"? They'd think I was delusional, a sleep-deprived mess imagining things. The embarrassment held me back, the fear of sounding insane outweighing the immediate terror.

Tonight, the anticipation is a heavy weight in the pit of my stomach. Every creak of the floorboards, every distant siren that pierces the night, makes me flinch, my nerves stretched taut like violin strings. I've been sitting here for hours, propped up against the headboard, the harsh overhead light casting stark shadows across the room, listening with an almost painful intensity. It's 12:05 AM now, and the silence is deafening, a thick, suffocating blanket. It feels like the deceptive calm before a violent storm.

Then I hear it.

A single, soft tap. Right behind my head.

I didn't move, didn't even dare to breathe. My eyes darted around the room, searching for any sign, any explanation. I held my breath, every muscle in my body coiled tight, waiting.

Another tap. Closer this time, more distinct. It sounds like it's coming from *inside* the wall, a hollow, resonant sound.

And then, a third tap. But this one isn't on the wall. It's on the headboard, inches from my ear, a light, almost playful rap.

A strangled gasp escaped my lips. I finally scrambled out of bed, backing away slowly, my eyes fixed on the wall, on the innocuous wooden headboard, as if they held some malevolent entity, some unseen presence that had decided to make itself known.

The knocking started again. A slow, deliberate rhythm, each tap measured and purposeful. *Knock... Knock... Knock...*

But this time, there was something else. A faint, sickening scratching sound accompanying each knock. Like brittle fingernails dragging against dry, aged wood. The sound sent a shiver down my spine, a primal revulsion that transcended mere fear.

I'm typing this now, hunched and trembling in the corner of my living room, the lights on full blast, every shadow seeming to writhe with unseen movement. The knocking has stopped, at least for this moment, but I can still hear the faint, persistent scratching from the bedroom. It's a dry, insistent sound, like something small and desperate trying to claw its way out of a very confined space.

I don't know what to do. Sleep is a distant memory. My mind races, trying to find a logical explanation, but the rational part of my brain is losing the battle against the growing, irrational terror. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? Could it be animals in the walls? But the precision of the knocking, the way it seems to respond and move… it feels intentional. What could it be?

Please, if you have any ideas, any advice, I'm begging you. I don't think I can handle another night of this. The scratching is getting louder. I think it's moving closer.

I just heard another tap. It's coming from the ceiling now.
