I don’t remember much of the house fire that killed both my parents. I lived on the first floor, but the gray smoke had grown so thick that I stumbled blindly for what felt like hours before finding a door. My throat felt like sandpaper and my eyes constantly streamed tears of irritation and pain. Strips of burned and mutilated flesh hung from my poor hands, though I knew it would heal rapidly, within a few hours. A firefighter appeared like a ghostly silhouette before me.

I remember the flashing lights of police and fire trucks and the far-away echo of deep voices. From the direction of the house, I remember the dying screams of my parents as they burned alive. My childish imagination could never have predicted what would come next.

Behind the flurry of ambulances, fire trucks and cop cars, I saw a single black sedan with tinted windows. Compared to the bright colors and strobing lights of the emergency vehicles, it looked like little more than a shadow. The windshield, too, looked dark and opaque, nearly impossible to see through.

I sat in the back of an ambulance. The EMTs had already cleared me, saying I only had a few scrapes and some mild smoke inhalation and eye irritation, but that I didn’t require urgent care or hospitalization. 

Abruptly, the doors of the black sedan flew open. Two men in black suits stepped out, wearing sunglasses even in the middle of the night. I stared, open-mouthed, as they swerved their way through the jumble of emergency responders and vehicles. They came straight at me, unsmiling and grave. Their faces looked extremely pale, almost vampiric in a way. 

“Hey there, Ghosten. Ghost-inn. Quite a unique name,” the one on the right said calmly, stretching my name out as he dropped down on one knee. His sunglasses looked like mirrors, but they reflected the world darkly.

“Hi,” I whispered in a tiny voice. “Who are you?”

“We’re here to bring you to a good home,” he responded in a voice as soothing as balm on a wound. He put a hand on my shoulder, trying to be comforting. But through the thin fabric of my T-shirt, I could feel his skin burning as if with an inner fever. I tried to draw back, but his grip tightened, the fingers digging into the thin bones.

“Where’s mom and dad?” I asked. “Why haven’t they come out?” He just shook his head.

“We’ll explain everything on the way, son,” he said, rising to his feet. He gently patted me on the shoulder a few times for good measure. No one else paid us any attention. With the two strange men beside me, we started off toward their sedan.

\*\*\*

“My name is Keller,” the leader of the two men said as he slid smoothly into the driver’s seat. He motioned at the silent one next to him. “This is Vlad.”

“Where are we going?” I asked. He turned in his seat, jerking his head to face me. The veins on his forehead and neck seemed to pound in time with his heart.

“You sure do ask a lot of fucking questions, kid,” Keller hissed, his teeth gritted as his lips flew into a snarl. Taken aback, I sat as silent as a statue as he started the car and slowly pulled away from the jumble of emergency vehicles.

We traveled in silence for hours, down winding roads and past dark forests. I remember we eventually came to a small airfield in the middle of scattered corn fields. A man with a black rifle stood at the front gate, looking bored and tired. Keller showed him a silver badge in a black leather case, and the gate started to roll to the side.

Keller pulled into a dark corner of the airfield. Together, the two agents quickly got out, slamming their doors closed. I had tried the handle a couple times along the trip, hoping I could jump out when the car slowed or stopped, but it was locked from the outside somehow. Now I frantically grabbed it again, shaking the door with as much force as my small body could muster. I only saw the grinning, pale face of Vlad outside. A key jiggled outside, and both doors flew open. In Vlad’s hand, I saw a needle filled with clear fluid. They held me down as he injected it in my neck. I felt sick and weak as black waves clouded my vision.

\*\*\*

I fell into a dreamless sleep. By the time I woke up, things around me had changed drastically.

I was handcuffed and thrown into the back of an SUV. With a pounding migraine, I looked up front, seeing Keller and Vlad still in the front seats. But now, the windows outside showed jagged mountain peaks covered in thick drifts of snow. The night outside looked freezing cold. Endless forests disappeared into the shadows off in the distance. I could feel the car rapidly accelerating uphill as hail peppered the windshield and roof. Vlad glanced in the rearview mirror. His eyes reminded me of those of a Siberian husky, ice-cold and predatory. 

“Ah, you’re awake? That’s good,” Vlad hissed in a thick Eastern European accent. “We’ll be there soon, Ghosten. There are few things you should probably know before we get there.

“Escape is impossible. Anyone who tries gets shot by the snipers. Some who lose hope might take it as the easy way out. Perhaps those are the smart ones.

“When you get there, you and the other newcomers will take a test. Those of you who fail will be euthanized. Do you know what euthanasia is, Ghosten?” I nodded. “Every month, the bottom 10% of the class will be taken out. At the end of nine months, those left alive will be offered jobs with the CIA and the military.

“All the kids there are freaks, just like you. They don’t all heal burnt, blackened skin in a few hours, though” Vlad continued. “That is impressive.” I felt a cold shudder run down my spine as I realized these men knew far more about me than seemed possible. “What else can you do, kid?”

“Nothing,” I muttered. “My hands weren’t that badly hurt. I think you’re exaggerating.” My voice felt weak and small.

“Uh-huh,” Keller said sarcastically. “Oh, look at that. What a sight, huh?” 

I remember that moment like a screenshot to this day. I gazed open-mouthed in horror up the steep mountain slope. Dark patches of evergreens surrounded the small, snow-covered road on both sides. Their boughs reached out toward the SUV, their overgrown needles scraping the sides with a faint screech. I could smell the overwhelming presence of pine coming in through the vents.

Above us loomed something like a massive high school surrounded by rolls of razor-wire and multiple layers of tall, electrified fences. A dozen jet-black sniper towers were placed equidistant around the perimeter of the property. The enormous brick building at the center looked like it had no windows at all. Sheer concrete walls rose to a flat roof a few stories high. Large industrial-sized smokestacks scattered over the top constantly belched black smoke into the crisp Alaskan air. Behind it, dozens of snow-capped mountains stretched off towards the horizon.

\*\*\*

We pulled up to the gate. Spotlights converged on the SUV from all directions. A guard dressed in all black stood there with a large rifle strapped to his chest. On his face, he wore a silver mask. It had long, slitted eyes and metal lips tightly pressed together in a grimace. My first thought was of the Man in the Iron Mask. Two more guards stood in a nearby guardhouse wearing identical masks, though they varied in height and build. Keller rolled down the window. The guard in charge spoke in an electronically-distorted voice. It sounded inhumanly deep with a subtle hiss of static writhing under his words.

“What is your business?” the guard hissed.

“We’re dropping off another subject for the tests,” Keller said calmly, showing his silver badge. “The Department for the Cleansing of Anomalies.”

“We have another shipment coming in by train from the capital,” the guard said, his mask revealing and distorted voice revealing nothing of what lay hidden under the surface. “The Cleaners are unloading the train now. You can drop the boy off over there. He needs to get an identification number.” I didn’t like the sound of any of this. Most of all, I felt unnerved by the way they talked about me as if I were a sack of meat getting delivered to a butcher shop.

The SUV slowly pulled off from the front gate, following the freshly-plowed road that wound its way around the exterior of the strange, prison-like school. I could hear far-away screams, a combination of many dissonant voices that rose and swelled into a hellish cacophony. I saw a platform of bare, gray concrete swarming with hundreds of kids, most of them looking like they were in the range of nine to thirteen. More armed soldiers wearing the same silver masks screamed orders. Some held black German shepherds on long chains that snarled and snapped at the kids, pulling against their restraints with wolfish ferocity.

“We’re here!” Keller exclaimed excitedly, pulling up next to the concrete platform. They pulled me out, taking off my handcuffs and shoving me into the surging crowd. The men in the silver masks pushed us forward relentlessly towards the building.

\*\*\*

“Males to the right, females to the left,” one of the guards said in an electronically-amplified voice, repeating it over and over. More guards had black truncheons, which they used to beat kids who they thought moved too slow or, sometimes, for no reason at all. I looked down the line of people, wondering where it led. Hundreds of boys disappeared into a dark hallway, while the line of girls veered off to the other side of the platform where another similarly black threshold waited to swallow them up.

“Keep moving forward,” another guard said, smashing his truncheon down over and over on the backs of boys ahead of me. I heard bones cracking and panicked screams. People tried to run past the sadistic guards of this hellish place, but they timed their shots with practiced ease. I saw quite a few kids get bit by the dogs as well. Drops of fresh blood stained the ground leading forward, mixing with darker, older stains eaten into the pavement. I shivered uncontrollably in the freezing Alaskan winter, wondering if I had somehow ended up in Hell. Maybe I had died in the fire along with my parents, and this was eternity.

I tried to slink into the center of the crowd, letting the boys on both sides of me take the brunt of the blows, though a few glancing strikes still hit me. I felt immensely grateful when we moved into the black hallway, which at least had some heat. Bizarre slogans in gold paint lined both sides of the wall. “Welcome to Stonehall, the School of Eyes,” one read. “A hurricane of souls spirals out of the chimneys, rejuvenating the planet,” read another. It was almost as if a schizophrenic in a psychotic state had written their thoughts down, though they seemed to connect in any eerie way I couldn’t yet understand.

Next to me stood a small boy with jet-black hair and a nose that looked like it had been broken and badly set. Unlike the others, he wasn’t screaming or upset. He looked calm. He glanced over at me, meeting my eyes.

“Hello,” he said over the wailing and cries of the confused, hurt kids. “How are you?” I laughed at that.

“Not very good, to tell you the truth,” I answered. “I think we might die tonight.” The boy shook his head once, the serenity never leaving his eyes.

“No, not you and not me,” he said simply. “Others, yes. But people die here all the time, after all. Like the signs said, a hurricane of souls spirals out.”

“How do you know we won’t die?” I asked, confused. He leaned close to me. There was an odd smell around the boy, almost like ozone with a note of panicked sweat. Yet his expression reflected no perturbation in his mind.

 “I can see the future, sometimes,” he whispered, looking around to make sure no one was listening. “Just in small doses, and it’s not always right. It’s like… imagine if reality was a beehive, filled with millions of cells rising above you. Those are all the possible worlds. But some paths are straighter heading upwards, and these are the more likely realities. Other paths would have to swerve and curve in insane ways, and these realities almost never come true.”

“Well, I sure hope you’re right,” I said, “because today is not a good day to die.”

\*\*\*

I found out that the boy’s name was Dean. I stayed close by his side as all of the boys were herded, one by one, into a room. After waiting for nearly half an hour, it was my turn. A guard in a silver mask took my arm and put it on top of some sort of machine that reminded me of an X-ray. A metal clamp closed around my wrist and elbow. Two other guards watched, armed with black rifles. Suddenly, red lasers shot out, sizzling into my skin. I screamed, trying to pull away, but seconds later, it was over. I looked down at my arm, seeing a number tattooed there in black copperplate: “A-20101.”

After that, we were led into a large auditorium with hundreds of velvet-lined seats facing a stage. A man in a black robe wearing the same iron mask as all the other guards stood there waiting, not moving in the slightest. For a moment, I thought it might be a mannequin. Dean stood behind me in line.

“Find seats!” the guards screamed in their amplified voices. People scrambled to the nearest open seat. Dean and I found two seats near the front, only a stone’s throw away from the still figure on the stage, looming over the crowd like the angel of death.

On the right arm of each seat, there was a tablet. The screens stayed dark for now, but once the hundreds of boys had taken their seats, all of them in the room turned on at once.

“You know why you’re here in Stonehall,” the black-robed man on the stage said, taking a long step towards the students. “Each of you are different, capable of great things. In this school, we will weed out the weak and feeble. Only the strongest and smartest will survive.

“The first round of elimination will take place by test. Enter your identification number at the top of the screen. The test will begin in ten seconds.”

The questions that came up on the screens seemed bizarre and nonsensical some of the time. The first strange one had to do with Tarot. It read: “In front of you, you see the Fool, the Hanged Man and the Devil. What card comes next?” In a flash, I somehow knew what they wanted me to say. “The Death Card,” I typed on the small touchscreen keyboard.

The questions varied wildly. Some topics focused on astral projection or out-of-body experiences, while others asked about ancient types of torture. Strange wildcards continuously came up, non-sequiturs like the Tarot question. I still remember another bizarre one.

“If the National Socialists had won World War 2, in what year would Adolf Hitler have died?” it asked. I thought about what Dean had said, how he could see different realities above him like the cells of an eternal beehive. I wrote down, “1949”, and the test was over.

\*\*\*

The screens all went black simultaneously. Spotlights overhead came on, shining down on us from all directions. The white glare blinded me temporarily. On the stage, I could just barely see the silhouette of the robed man. He raised his hand, his pointer finger extended upwards, reminding me of the ISIS salute.

“The tests are being scored now,” he rasped. “Please stay in your seats.” I nervously looked around, seeing the other students sweating heavily. The doors at the back of the auditorium flew open. Dozens of guards with rifles walked in, their masks gleaming under the harsh fluorescent light. In pairs, they walked over to some of the boys, pulling their arms out and checking the tattooed numbers. They passed by me and Dean, but the boy on the other side of me had failed. Sweating heavily, I saw him stumble to his feet as the black-gloved hands of the guards forced him up.

“What’s happening?” he asked, his voice weak and uncertain. “Where are you taking me?”

“Shut the fuck up,” a guard hissed, pushing him forward onto the steps. The boy went sprawling, smashing his face into the hard steps with a sickening thud. A moment later, he raised his swollen head. Streams of blood flowed from his nose. He spit up frothy blood and a piece of a tooth. After a few minutes, they had lined up a few dozen of the boys out of the few hundred people in the class. At gunpoint, they marched them out and into the hall.

“The rest of you will be shown to your rooms,” the black-robed man at the front of the hall said. “Every month, you will have a test, though not all will be based on knowledge. Some tests may be based on your skills and abilities. You will be honed over the months, strengthened and shown amazing sights.”

\*\*\*

We were led out into the hallway. It split off into four corridors, and off in the distance, I saw it split off again. The halls had been decorated somewhat like a traditional school, with tiled floors and brick walls. Fluorescent lights hung overhead, casting the pale, terrified faces below in a white glare. Stairs going up six or seven levels opened up intermittently.

They sectioned us off in groups of a dozen, sending us into rooms with cold steel bunkbeds covered in thin mattresses. I was thankful to see Dean in my group.

I laid down immediately, feeling bone-tired and weak from all that happened and the long distances I had traveled. I heard Dean weeping in the bunk below me. And then, far below us, the screaming started. At first, it came through muffled. I saw air vents in the room, square grills at the corners. The sound seemed to come from them. The wailing intensified, the notes of agony and terror growing stronger.

“What is that?” I whispered, not wanting to know the answer. I had a sick feeling in my stomach. My heart was racing.

“You can’t see it?” Dean asked. “I can. They get locked in concrete rooms. Then the vents start whirring, and the poison comes through. They see their nails turning blue as they pile up into pyramids of bodies, coughing up blood from screaming so loud and so long. Can’t you see it?”

“No, I can’t,” I said. After about fifteen or twenty minutes, the intense, agonized wailing began quieting down. One by one, the voices died out like stars winking out at the end of the universe. 

\*\*\*

I fell asleep sometime in the pitch-black night. I dreamed of pyramids of naked corpses with dilated pupils and blue lips. Men in hazmat suits came in, but when they turned to look at me, I realized their suits were fused to their skin, their plastic masks melted to their blood-red, grinning skulls.

I woke up screaming as something like a tornado siren rang out above me. Bright lights turned on overhead, humming with an incessant tinking sound. I thrashed in my bed, falling off the side of the bunk and landing on the floor. The other boys looked at me like I was insane. Dean got out of bed and helped me stand up.

We were marched single-file back down the hallway. Classrooms opened up on both sides of us, filled with a mixture of girls and boys. A silent guard with a silver mask pointed us toward a classroom on the right, where a dozen girls sat at tables, their eyes looking tired and haunted. A man stood at the front of the class with strange, blood-red irises. He had a shaved head and a reddish hue to his skin, as if he were at risk of exploding from hypertension at any moment.

“Sit down!” he yelled. “Sit down! We don’t have much time here.” I quickly found a seat at a table with three other boys. On the chalkboard, the man had written, in large, spiky letters: “PYROKINESIS”.

“My name is Mr. Antimony, and I’m here to teach you little shits about pyrokinesis,” he hissed, walking in circles with a manic energy. “Most of you will fail. The art of harnessing the deathless self within the heart and bringing heat from it is a rare one. It has been practiced by Buddhist monks and practitioners of Advaita Vedanta for millennia, along with the other higher arts like telekinesis, mind-reading and astral projection. A few of you may be worthy enough to realize the source of this power.

“In the drawers in front of each of you, you will find a variety of objects: cotton balls, rubbing alcohol, paper and a book titled ‘The Art of Living Fire’ written by the ancient seer, Hermes Trismegistus.”

In the first class of this bizarre place, we were taught how to heat objects with our hands until they exploded into flames. The two other boys at our table, Kim, a young Asian kid with magnified glasses, and Tommy, a little, malnourished-looking kid, instantly proved to be adept at the lessons. I hadn’t succeeded in lighting even the smallest cottonball when something went horribly wrong in a flash.

Kim had succeeded in igniting a Bible on fire when a ball of flames shot out of his hands, causing the bottle of alcohol to erupt. It melted in an instant, dripping a blue inferno over the table. It soaked into Kim’s shirt and pants, and the red flames that emanated from his hands exploded. He screamed, running in circles as his skin blackened and dripped. I saw his eyes melting out of his head. He fell to the floor, and someone grabbed a jacket and tried to smother the flames, but it simply ignited. The student dropped the jacket, backing away from the screaming, writhing body on the floor.

\*\*\*

During the next few weeks, we continued to learn at the nightmarish classes of Stonehall. Regular casualties occurred, and deaths frequently happened during accidents. Yet these deaths did not go towards the quota that would be enforced in another week. Another 10% of the class would die, and this time, they said the tests would include practical demonstrations of powers that would be ruled by a team of judges.

“We need to get out of here,” Dean whispered one night. Tommy lay at the next bunk over, his small face looking pinched and mousey in the dark. 

“They’re going to start the executions again soon,” he said. “The path to the concrete rooms down below.”

“The path to the gas chambers,” Dean agreed. “We need to find a way to break out and tell the world about this place.” All of us had grown exponentially in the last few weeks, our latent abilities coming to fruition under the constant watchful eyes of the teachers. 

“Why don’t you use your precognitive abilities to see a way out?” I asked Dean. “There has to be weak spots. Maybe we can kill the guards and take their suits. If we had the masks on…”

“We’re too small,” Tommy said. I shook my head.

“You’re too small,” I said. “Dean and I might be able to pass. Not all the guards are tall, after all.”

“What if the students rebelled?” Tommy asked. “Maybe we could ask around, see if other kids want to fight back and try to escape. If all of us attacked them at once…”

“They have precognitive abilities, too,” Dean said. “They’re going to see the most likely paths just like I can. At least the ones at the top, and a few of the teachers…”

“So it comes down to my plan, I think,” I said. “And we don’t know who we can trust. The three of us could probably kill and overpower a guard. What do you think?”

“They killed my parents and kidnapped me,” Tommy spat with venom. “I would love to see some of these fuckers dead.”

“I hope it doesn’t come to that, but I think it might,” Dean said, and then everything went quiet.

\*\*\*

On the day before the scheduled test, Tommy came running up to me and Dean after the class on assassination techniques had finished. His scarecrow-thin face shone with a wide grin. I had never seen him so excited.

“I think I found a way out,” he said. He looked around furtively, making sure no one else stood close enough to hear. “Do you guys remember the day you came in here?” I nodded. How could I forget?

“I got dropped off by two agents,” I said. “They claimed they were from some non-existent government agency called the Cleaners.”

“I came on the cattle cars,” Tommy said, frowning at the memory. “Well, they drop off more kids out there every day. They need constant fresh meat for the tests, after all. There are guards all over the place, and cars out there.”

“We need to find a weak spot in the guards’ defense,” I said, “where we can overpower a couple of them and kill them and steal their uniforms. After that, you think we could just walk out of here?”

“The medical ward usually isn’t heavily guarded,” Dean said. “We need to do it tonight, though. This is the last chance.” We made it sound so easy, but in reality, I knew it would be an almost impossible task.

The rest of the day passed by in a blur. Before I knew it, the classes had finished, and we were being led back to the chambers. We waited in the darkness, whispering so the other boys wouldn’t hear our plans. When 3 AM rolled around, Dean indicated it was time to go.

“The hallways outside are empty,” he whispered. “We need to move now, as quickly and quietly as we can.” I saw his pupils constricting and expanding rapidly, as they always did when he tried to tap into the multiverse of possibilities. I wondered what it looked like, staring up into the beehive of realities. Despite his attempts to help me learn some precog abilities, I had failed in every attempt so far.

Whether day or night, the hallways always looked the same- windowless, with every inch of them illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights overhead. Dean lead us successfully down turn after turn. I heard the guard’s steps missing us by mere seconds. Afraid to even breathe too loud, we made our way towards the medical ward.

\*\*\*

“Are you guys ready?” Dean whispered. Using his abilities seemed to take a toll on him. His face looked pale and sweaty, his dilated pupils gleaming manically. “We need to fight. There are two guards up ahead.”

“Fuck,” Tommy whispered back. “I can’t believe we’re doing this.”

“They’re going to murder us if we don’t, maybe,” I said. “We have to kill them first.”

“Hey, stop right there!” a guard exclaimed abruptly, coming around the corner. He had an automatic rifle slung around his shoulder. I froze like a deer in the headlights, staring dumbly at the guard. Luckily, Tommy went into action immediately, running at the guard before he could aim his gun.

Tommy raised his small hands, causing a swirling vortex of flame to erupt from his hands. With lightning-fast reflexes, the guard grabbed his rifle as Tommy’s hands wrapped around his bare throat. There was a flash as the rifle fired. At the same moment, the skin on the guard’s neck started to drip and blacken. There was an echoing of pained screams as my ears rang.

Another guard came around the corner seconds later, aiming his rifle at Dean’s head. Dean shot a flash of blue lightning from the tips of his fingers, using his telekinetic powers to send the rifle flying upwards. The bullet smashed harmlessly into the ceiling, causing dust and debris to rain down on our heads.

Tommy fell on the guard’s body, a torrent of blood pumping from the massive hole in his chest. I ran at the second guard, a flash of blue light sparking from my fingertips and sending him sprawling backwards. He grabbed his rifle, shooting blindly in the direction of me and Dean. I heard bullets whizzing past my head, missing my brain by inches.

“I’m hit!” Dean screamed. I looked back, seeing a ragged hole eaten into his right shoulder. Blood spurted from the wound in time with his heartbeat. Tommy had stopped moving as he lay on the writhing body of the other guard. The flames spread down his body. He kicked and clenched with all of his strength, looking like a poisoned hornet twisting on the floor.

I knew I was alone now. Focusing on the spinning vortex of energy within my heart, I tried to bring out the fire I had never succeeded in creating before. The guard lay stunned for a moment, but I knew he would rapidly recover. I leapt forward, putting my hands around his throat. I felt something freezing cold running through my blood, but when it emerged from my skin, it grew burning hot. An acrid smell like ozone and burning metal surrounded me, pouring off my feverish skin. The guard screamed as his throat melted. His gurgling grew low and distorted. I felt his windpipe collapsing under the heat and assault.

Breathing heavily, I looked around, expecting to see a platoon of guards running in. Someone must have heard all the gunshots and screaming. Dean’s eyes had started to roll up in his head by this point. I crawled over to him, slapping his face.

“Stay with me, man,” I whispered. Rapidly, his lips took on a bluish cast. His paleness grew vampiric, his skin chalk-white. I knew it was useless.

I got up, feeling dissociated and unreal. I looked around, seeing an empty, dark room down the hall. It was one of the rooms for the medical ward, filled with unoccupied beds and equipment.

With a rush of adrenaline, I leaned down, dragging the body of the guard I had killed over to the room. At first, his body seemed too heavy, impossibly heavy, but my telekinetic powers came rushing out. I felt drained from using my powers so much, and I hoped that, soon, I could rest.

I rapidly stripped the guard of his military gear and silver mask. Underneath, I saw a young man, probably in his early twenties. He had a soft, child-like face. He seemed on the border of life and death as his gurgling breaths came slower and shallower. I wondered how such cruelty could hide behind such a mundane exterior.

\*\*\*

It took me a few minutes to change, breathing heavily in the dark. The gear all felt far too large on me, especially the boots. I saw a nearby medical closet with linen, slip-proof socks and hospital gowns. I put on pair after pair after socks until I could walk in the black boots.

The gear smelt of burnt flesh and blood, with drops of blackened gore still staining the bullet-proof vest and tactical vests. I put on the mask, whispering a few words. The built-in voice distortion system caused them to come out low and predatory, like the hissing of a snake.

“Stay with me, man,” I whispered, feeling the echoes of past atrocities spreading around me. “Stay with me.” I slowly opened the door, looking both ways but seeing no one. Close by, I heard heavy footsteps rushing in our direction.

I came around the corner as a dozen guards ran up with rifles. The one in front froze, holding his gun with practiced ease. I stared into the unreadable silver face, wondering if this was the end.

“I found two boys dead,” I said. “Some guards, too.”

“We heard gunshots,” he responded. I nodded, pointing behind me at the pools of blood and the broken bodies laying strewn about like garbage.

“It looks like a couple kids attacked some guards,” I said. “I was just about to go report it and call for back-up.”

“Go get the Principal,” he hissed. “We’ll secure the area.” Gratefully, I crept past the still, eerie figures of the soldiers, unable to believe my luck.

I made my way outside, hearing panicked screaming and pained sobs. A new round of kids stood next to the cattle cars of the train under a cloudy, black sky. A thin layer of cracked ice covered the ground. Seeing these kids beaten and pushed forward brought back horrifying memories of my first night here. Looking around, it grew worse when I saw the black SUV of Keller and Vlad. It stood empty, the engine running. In the line of kids, I glimpsed their two pale faces dragging two girls toward the hallway.

Blending in with the crowd of guards, I quickly made my way over to the SUV and got inside. Without hesitation, I put it in drive and slowly started pulling away. No one had noticed anything yet in the chaos of the moment. In the parking lot, I saw dozens of other similar SUVs used by Stonehall for trafficking kids. I hoped I could blend in and get out before anyone raised the alarm.

I pulled slowly up to the main gate, my heart twitching like a trapped rabbit. The iron mask of the guard revealed nothing as I rolled down the window. He held his rifle tightly in his hands. Through the eyeholes, I saw two red irises staring out.

“Identification?” the distorted voice said. Even through the distortion, I could hear the boredom in his voice. I checked the pockets of the dead man’s uniform, finding a wallet. I pulled it out, flipping it open and showing the silver badge in the center. The guard nodded, moving back to the guardhouse. The gate slowly started ambling to the side.

“Wait! Stop him!” a voice shrieked from behind me. In utter panic, I glanced in the rearview mirror, seeing Vlad and Keller heading in my direction, sprinting blindly toward the SUV.

“Fuck!” I shouted, slamming the gear shift into drive and accelerating rapidly. The tires spun on the ice for a long, heart-stopping moment. The guard ran out of the guardhouse, raising his rifle at the SUV. Then the car took off in a flash as the tires caught, sending me flying through the open gate.

I accelerated at dangerous speeds down the slick slope of the Alaskan mountains, leaving Stonehall behind. A few minutes later, a voice came over a radio next to the steering wheel. I recognized the voice of Keller.

“Ghosten, stop! This was all a test, and you passed. You escaped from Stonehall,” he said urgently. “You were the only one in the last five years to successfully get out. Your training is done. We’d like to offer you a job.”

I glanced in the rearview mirror, seeing cars far behind me. A few black SUVs flew out of the gate, looking as small as fruit flies. Swearing, I accelerated as fast as I could, fearing I would skid right off the road.

After making it to the bottom of the mountain, the road split off into four directions. I saw thick forests to the left and right. Nervously, I pulled right and sped around the corner, nearly sliding into a tree. I looked in the rearview mirror again, but I didn’t see my pursuers.

I pulled over, abandoning the car and fleeing that place of horrors. I walked for days before I found a small town where I managed to blend in. But I still feel hunted to this day.
