I know this sounds ridiculous, but the elevator in my building sometimes has an extra button.

It’s always the same one: B2.

There isn’t supposed to be a B2. The basement stops at B1—that’s where the laundry room, boiler, and maintenance closets are. But sometimes, when I come home late—usually past midnight—there it is. A small, faintly lit B2 was tucked below the usual panel, almost as if someone had scratched it into the metal and then backlit it from behind.

It doesn’t always show up. I’ve lived here for three years, and I’ve seen it maybe seven times.

The first time, I just stared at it, trying to convince myself I was overtired. The light looked sickly—greenish-yellow, like old teeth. I pressed every other button to see if it was a glitch, but they all worked fine. When I blinked, it was gone. The panel was back to normal.

I told myself I imagined it.

Until the second time.

It was raining, the kind of heavy, suffocating rain that drowns the sound of your own thoughts. I was soaked; my shoes squished as I got into the elevator. I hit “4” for my floor, and then—I swear to God—it flickered. The “B2” glowed faintly again, just below the “B1”.

I couldn’t help it. I pressed it.

The doors slid shut without a sound. The elevator jerked downward, harder than usual. The light overhead dimmed, then flickered like a dying candle.

The ride felt longer than it should have. There was a groaning sound, like the cables were straining under too much weight. My ears popped, and I started to feel this deep, crawling unease—like the air was thicker down there, heavier somehow.

When the doors opened, the light from the elevator spilled into a concrete corridor. It wasn’t finished like B1—it looked more like a construction site that had been abandoned halfway through. The walls were wet. The air smelled like rust and something sweet rotting.

The corridor stretched out farther than the dimensions of the building should’ve allowed. Pipes were running along the ceiling—some dripping a dark, viscous liquid.

I stepped out.

Just once.

My foot landed on something soft. I thought it was a piece of insulation or a cloth rag until it squelched.

But when I looked down I nearly vomited at what I saw. It was a hand, not attached to anything.

Just a pale, bloated hand lying palm-up on the floor.

I scrambled back into the elevator, and slammed the “Close Door” button until my thumb went numb. When the doors finally shut, I didn’t breathe until I was back on the first floor.

When I told the supervisor of the building the next day, he just looked at me too long and said, “That elevator’s old. Sometimes it plays tricks.” Then he smiled—like he’d practiced it in a mirror.

Two weeks later, I found a note taped inside the elevator.

Just a torn piece of lined paper with shaky handwriting:
“Don’t go below B1. She doesn’t like visitors.”
No signature.

I tore it down. I didn’t want the supervisor thinking I was the one who wrote it, trying to scare the other people living in the building.

But later that night, when I got home from work, the button was there again. B2, glowing faintly in the dark.

I didn’t press it.

I pressed “4.”

And the elevator went down anyway.

I hit every button—“1,” “2,” “3,” “4,” even the panic button. None of them worked. The panel lights flickered like fireflies dying out.

When the doors opened, I was staring into the same concrete corridor. Only this time, there was a sound—soft, wet breathing from somewhere deep in the dark.

I could hear something dragging itself across the floor.

Slowly, deliberately. Something that didn’t need to be rushed.

The air smelled worse—like spoiled meat, mildew, and the underside of a wet carpet. The elevator hummed faintly, a mechanical heartbeat that seemed to sync with the dragging sound.

I pressed myself into the corner of the elevator and just kept hitting “Door Close.” My hand was slick with sweat. The light flickered, and for half a second, I saw something just outside the door at the end of the corridor.

It looked like a woman—but her arms were long and so skinny you could see the edges of her bones. Her fingers dragged behind her, bending backwards like broken branches.

Her legs were bent in every direction, she doesn’t use them, they just drag behind her as she uses the back of her wrists to drag herself around.

She was smiling, but the skin around her mouth looked stretched with cracks around her lips that allowed blood to seep out, it was like the edges of mouth were permanently stapled to make her smile allowing her lips to dry out and crack.

She didn’t move for a bit, just stared at me in the elevator with those bloodshot eyes that were oozing black sludge from the corners.

It wasn’t until I blinked that she started to move towards me, but it wasn’t slow, it was like she was sprinting down the corridor towards me. Every movement was followed with a loud cracking of bones that echoed through the corridor.

She was using her long arms to pull herself towards me faster and faster, I have no clue how her wrist wasn't snapping in half from all the weight.

I started to press the “Door Close,” button faster, glancing out the door to see how close the abomination was getting.

The doors finally closed just before she could reach them.

When I got back to my floor, I threw up in the hallway. My neighbor heard and came out, but when I told him what had happened, he just stared at me, as if he wanted to believe but couldn’t.

That was two months ago. I’ve taken the stairs ever since.

Until tonight.

The stairwell was taped off for maintenance, so I had no choice but to use the elevator. I stood in front of it for a long time, watching my reflection in the dull metal doors. My face looked gray, tired, like it didn’t quite belong to me anymore.

I stepped in and hit “4.”

The elevator began to move, slowly and steadily.

Then it stopped.

The light flickered, and the B2 button appeared again—brighter than ever, pulsing faintly like it was breathing.

And this time, I didn’t touch it.

It pressed itself.

The button clicked in on its own, and the elevator shuddered violently, dropping faster than it ever had before. My stomach lurched, and I screamed—but the sound didn’t seem to go anywhere. It just bounced back at me, hollow and thin.

When the doors opened, there was no corridor this time—just a narrow hallway lined with mirrors—floor to ceiling, stretching into darkness.

Every reflection was me.

Except one.

The one at the end wasn’t moving.

It just stared at me with that same smile she had.

The elevator began to fill with a fog from the air vents, the head began to heavy, my vision blurred, and I passed out.

The last thing I remembered hearing were the cracking of bones with a high pitched screech that shattered every mirror.

After I came too, I found myself still in the elevator. Both ears and nose were bleeding, and when the door opened it was my floor.

I packed up everything I could and checked out, and left that city and building behind.

It's been a year since all that happened, I’m currently writing this in a new city across the country in a brand new apartment. It was hard leaving everything behind but life here has been good. Well it was good until today.

I came back from my new job and entered the elevator to head up to my floor, when I pressed the button to head up that’s when I saw it. 

Tucked beneath B1 was B2, glowing bright just like it did back then. I immediately jumped out of the elevator before the doors could close. 

I don’t use the elevator anymore, I only take the stairs and if they are blocked I just sleep in my car because I’m not gonna risk my life with whatever is down there.

So I’ll leave you with a warning. If you are ever in an elevator and a button appears that wasn’t there before, don’t press it, don’t give it the attention it wants because if you do it will follow you into every elevator you go into waiting for you to press it and bring you down there to meet her on floor B2.
