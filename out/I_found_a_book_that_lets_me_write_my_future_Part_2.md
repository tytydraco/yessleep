Chapter 2: The Rules of Reality 

The next morning, Kai awoke with a clear purpose. The strange book now felt less like a curse and more like a tool he could manipulate. He sat up in his chair, grabbed the pen, and wrote in the book:

*"After waking up, Kai sat in his chair and wrote in the book. He then stood up and walked into the bathroom, where to his surprise, he found $10,000 cash sitting on the sink. Filled with joy, he ran back to his room and found a beautiful model sitting on his bed."*

He finished writing, closed the book, and stood up, feeling a rush of excitement. He walked briskly to the bathroom, anticipation growing with every step. But when he reached the sink, there was nothing. He scanned the bathroom, confusion setting in, but the only thing waiting for him was disappointment.

Sighing, he sat down on the toilet, trying to process what went wrong. Suddenly, the sink started making a strange noise. He approached it, and just as he tried to inspect it, the faucet burst open, narrowly missing his face and smashing into the wall. A sharp pain stung his cheek as he realized a small cut had formed, blood trickling down his face. Before long, water began gushing out, flooding the bathroom.

"Great, now the sink's broken," Kai muttered in frustration as he quickly turned off the water beneath the sink. To his surprise, a few coins clattered out of the pipe along with the water.

"Coins? Were they stuck in the pipes?" he wondered aloud. "This has to be the book's doing. I wrote $10,000, and I get... pocket change?" He counted the coins, realizing it was just enough for a simple breakfast. "Well, at least it's something."

As he headed back to his room, a loud bang startled him. He rushed in to find the rat from the previous day sitting on his bed. Furious, Kai grabbed a picture frame and hurled it at the rodent, but the rat scurried away unscathed. Exhausted and bewildered, he sank onto the bed, trying to make sense of what had just happened.

A knock at the door interrupted his thoughts. The knocking grew more insistent, almost as if someone was trying to annoy him on purpose. Irritated, Kai stormed to the door and flung it open, ready to confront whoever was there.

"What?" he snapped, but his anger quickly dissipated as he saw the person standing before him. She was stunning, with a voice as soft and calming as her appearance.

"Hey, I'm sorry for knocking like that, but I think you have a leak," she said, her concern evident.

Kai was momentarily speechless, taken aback by her beauty. "Uh, what? Oh, right, sorry. Hi, how are you? What can I do for you?" he stammered, trying to play it cool by awkwardly leaning against the doorframe.

The girl gave him a puzzled look. "Okay... I don't know what that was about, but you have a leak, and it's messing up my apartment," she explained.

"Oh, right! Sorry about that. My bathroom sink just got seriously damaged—it almost took my head off, as you can see from the scratch on my cheek," Kai replied, pointing to the fresh cut.

"Wow, that looks painful," she said sympathetically.

"Yeah, it stings a bit, but it would take more than that to bring me down," Kai said, attempting to sound tough as he nervously scratched the back of his head.

"Right... so, the leak?" she reminded him.

"I'll fix it right away. By the way, what's your name?" Kai asked.

"Elsa. I just moved into the building; I live on the floor below. That's why I came up about the leak," Elsa explained.

"Okay, well, it's nice to meet you, Elsa. I'm Kai. I haven't been here long myself," he said, his mind racing with thoughts about his dwindling finances and uncertain future.

"Nice to meet you too, Kai," she said, glancing at her phone as it beeped. "Oh no, I'm late for my shoot! I have to go."

"Wait, a shoot? Are you a celebrity or something?" Kai asked, intrigued.

"Not exactly. I'm a model, or at least I'm trying to be one. I just got into the industry recently," Elsa said, backing away as she spoke. "But I really have to go now. Please, get that leak fixed!"

With that, Elsa rushed down the stairs, leaving Kai in a daze. "A model... wait a minute, model, $10,000 in cash... and ten coins? What the hell is going on?"

Kai closed the door and walked back into his apartment, his mind racing. "I was supposed to find $10,000 in cash in my bathroom and a beautiful model on my bed. This is all wrong. I need to check the book again."

He hurried to his bedroom, and to his surprise, the book was glowing. He grabbed it and quickly flipped to the back cover, where more words had appeared, forming what looked like the third and fourth rules.

"Two more rules... Do they only appear when I mess up? Yesterday, I didn’t write the events in detail, and the book filled in the gaps. Then, the second rule appeared, telling me to be specific. So, is this book guiding me, or is it just messing with me?"

He read the new rules aloud:

*"When the events written in the book are out of reach and too unrealistic for the holder, the book will modify the events and find a way to fulfill each one in a more realistic manner."*

*"When the holder writes about their future, the holder must follow the written events word for word. If not, the book will record what the holder does instead and find a way to fulfill the written events in another way as the holder goes about their day."*

Kai sighed. "So, not only do I have to be specific and realistic, I also have to follow what I wrote in the book exactly, or it won’t happen as I described it. That explains why nothing went as planned—I ran to the bathroom instead of walking like I wrote."

Determined to test the new rules, Kai grabbed the pen and wrote:

*"A man who was a plumber, looking for customers, happened to be in Kai's apartment building. Kai put down the book and walked into the living room. He heard a knock, walked to the door, and opened it to find the plumber, who introduced himself and offered free plumbing work in exchange for future business. Kai agreed."*

He closed the book and followed his own instructions word for word. When he opened the door, there stood the plumber, just as he had written.

"Yes, it worked! So that’s how the book operates, and I don’t even have to pay for the repairs!" Kai laughed, feeling victorious.

The plumber introduced himself and got to work, just as described, leaving Kai with a sense of newfound power and understanding over the mysterious book.
