I’ve always been a history buff, drawn to the eerie beauty of old buildings with stories etched into their walls. Nursing homes, where I’ve spent years as a CNA, usually feel predictable—sterile halls, faded wallpaper, the buzz of routine care. But Stonerise was different. From the moment I stepped into its looming red-brick facade, something felt *wrong*. The building, a former tuberculosis hospital built in 1927, was massive: a four-story main building (B unit) with two three-story wings (A and C units) sprawling from either side, framing a courtyard that faced the sleepy town. It became a home for the elderly in the 1970s, but its past clung to it like damp rot.

Orientation was a slog—HIPAA videos, dementia training, and fake-friendly faces that turned cold when you asked for help. The only break came when Bill, the grizzled maintenance man, offered a tour of A unit, where we’d been holed up for training. The upper floors of A unit were off-limits to everyone except maintenance and the facility’s administrator, its secured elevator a silent gatekeeper. The first floor was mundane: a few offices, a resident shop for snacks and mail. Bill mentioned the building’s history as a TB sanatorium, and my curiosity stirred. I’ve always loved the macabre, but nothing could’ve prepared me for what came next.

We took the elevator to the second floor of A unit, the oldest part of the facility. It was the main patient ward back when TB ravaged the state, before B and C units were added to handle the overflow. The air was thick with must, the walls scuffed, tiles chipped, paint peeling in long, curling strips. A faint smell of water damage lingered. Bill pointed out old doctors’ offices, exam rooms, and, at the end of the hall, the morgue. My heart raced—I had to see it. I thought that’d be the highlight of the tour. I was wrong.

The elevator carried us to the third floor. As the doors slid open, a cold breeze hit me, raising goosebumps. I stepped out and froze. The hallway was lined with rusted jail cells, some chains bolted to the floor, others dangling from the ceiling like grotesque chandeliers. Bill’s voice was calm, almost bored, as he explained: prisoners with TB—rapists, murderers, and lesser offenders—were sent here to recover or die. The coughing disease didn’t discriminate. The cells, corroded and skeletal, seemed to watch us. I felt a chill that wasn’t just the draft. We didn’t stay long.

The next night, I started my first shift at 11 p.m. on 2B. The resident I was assigned to sit with one-on-one had been rushed to the hospital after trying to attack an elderly woman. With no one to monitor, I was told to help the other CNAs and answer call lights. I hit it off with Julie, a young CNA with a sharp wit. We bonded over the building’s creepy history, swapping stories about the constant feeling of being watched, like eyes were boring into your back. Emboldened by our shared unease, we decided to sneak into A unit to find the morgue.

Using our phone flashlights, we slipped past the double doors from B to A unit. The second floor was as dilapidated as I remembered, the air heavy with decay. It didn’t take long to spot the morgue—a cracked door letting in a sliver of parking lot light. I pushed it open, and a foul stench hit me, like something long dead. Julie swore she didn’t smell a thing. Inside were old cabinets, a steel table where countless bodies had lain, and a wooden wheelchair, its cracked frame slouched in the corner. We froze at a rustling sound down the hall—probably a rat. As we turned to check, a metallic *clank* echoed behind us, like a drawer slamming shut in the cabinet. An icy cold enveloped the room, sharp and unnatural. We bolted, speed-walking down the hallway, our footsteps loud in the silence. But there was another sound—another set of footsteps, heavier, deliberate, not ours, not an echo. We reached the double doors, panting, relief washing over us.

Then I felt it again—that prickling sense of being watched. Something screamed in my gut not to look back, but I did. Through the windowpane of the double doors, a pale, gray face stared back, its lips curled into a wide, menacing smile. It wasn’t human—not anymore. Its eyes were hollow, but the grin radiated malice. I stumbled back, heart hammering, and forced myself to focus on work.

Later, during my lunch break, I realized I’d left my food in my truck. I headed to the staff elevator on 2B and pressed the button. The display showed it was already on the second floor, so I braced for the doors to open. Instead, the elevator hummed, ascending. 3… 4… *Ding*. The faint sound of doors opening echoed from above. My stomach dropped. The fourth floor was off-limits, empty, a husk of unused space. No one had been near the elevator before me. The hum started again as it descended. 3… 2… *Ding*. The doors slid open. Nothing. Just an empty elevator. I stepped inside, and that same rotten stench from the morgue filled the air, thick and suffocating. I jabbed the button for the first floor, my skin crawling. I wasn’t alone. As the doors opened, a cold breeze rushed past me, like something brushing by.

I made it to my truck, heart pounding, and sat there, gripping the steering wheel. The cab felt too small, the air too heavy. I glanced at the passenger seat, half-expecting to see that gray, smiling face. Nothing. But the feeling never left—a certainty that something had followed me, was *still* with me, waiting. I don’t know if I can go back to Stonerise. Not after what I saw. Not after what I felt.
