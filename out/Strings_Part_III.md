Ever since that night I don’t think there’s been a day that’s past that I haven’t seen Colleen’s car parked at the house. According to my mom, Colleen has been excited to talk about her sitting gig for the Kinseys.

“I don’t think at any point I’ve heard her talk about her own boys at all. All she talks about is little Rowan,” Mom said.

Logan has been asking me to keep tabs on the house. He’s been showing me books that he’s been reading. Along with notes he’s taken on various extraterrestrial and demonic forces. I got to admit, the notes are really thorough. I’m certain Logan is going to make a great conspiracy theorist one day. Then again, Logan’s wild ideas might be the only thing keeping me safe right now.

I’ve made it a point to always put salt around the house when I get home. I sleep with my handmade cross under my pillow along with a pocketknife from my dad’s collection. I asked my dad if I could borrow one of his cameras that he uses for birdwatching. I told him it’s because I want to capture the migrating birds as they head south for winter.

“Say no more, fellow ornithophile.”

Despite the personal embarrassment I got giving my dad the slightest inclination that I’m actually getting into his hobby, he lent me one of his nicer models. A Canon EOS Rebel. I can change out the lens if I want. From my mom I asked if she could get me a planner. Something that I could use to keep track of the Kinseys’ movements. Of course, my mom brought home a nice one from the library that no one was using. Just as expected from a librarian’s planner there was a poem on the first page. I’m not much into poetry. But I felt like the one on the planner was pretty fitting.

“What of the hunting, hunter bold? Brother, the watch was long and cold,” I read.

I’ve been sharing my own notes with Logan at school. The Kinseys have been leaving the house around noon when my mom leaves for work and Colleen arrives to babysit. Every time I’ve seen them come back it’s five or six in the evening.  

“Do you know where they go?” Logan asked.

I shook my head.

“I don’t think I want to,” I said.

Logan made a note in his own journal.

“What about the child?” he asked. “Have you seen him?”

I shook my head again.

“The curtains are closed most of the time. I know Colleen is there to watch him. At least, I think she’s watching him.”

Logan seemed disappointed with my answers. I know that it’s hardly anything to go on but I don’t know how to get a good look on what’s going on without going into the house on my own.

“What about Colleen? Is she different in anyway?”

“Different how?” I asked.

“You know? Avoiding the sun? Keeping out of a full moon? Moving around stiff? Saying things in Latin?”

I thought back to each time Colleen left the house.

“She always smiles,” I said. “And she still has a bandage on her arm. Like Mrs. Kinsey has on her neck.”

“Maybe they’re puncture marks,” Logan said.

“Or a bad bruise,” I suggested.

Logan rolled his eyes as he started to zip up his books and notes.

“You really think that, Miles?”

“I don’t know what to think, dude.” I slammed my planner shut and got up from the lunch table. “I just know that my neighbors are freaking me out and I don’t know if knowing anything is going to do anything and my parents are acting like everything is fine—”

Logan grabbed my shoulder. “Miles. It’s alright man.”

I sighed. “I just want to get out of here. Out of town. I don’t want to think about ghosts or ghouls or…or…”

“Fools?” Logan offered.

“I deal with one of those all the time,” I said pointing at him.  

Logan smirked. I felt a little less paranoid when he did. At least I wasn’t dealing with this alone and Logan was probably the best person too share it with.

“We’ll figure it out. If my folks saw bigfoot on their first date then we’re bound to find an answer to your neighbors.”

Maybe I’d spoken too soon about my friend’s competency. But he’s the best I got. I’m going to die, aren’t I?

When we got off the bus, Logan decided he wanted to do another stakeout with me. He texted his mom saying he’d be doing homework at my place. As we were walking though, we noticed someone waiting outside the Kinsey House. It was Colleen. She had an eyepatch over her left eye.  

As she waved at us, I expected her to start doing a pirate impersonation. I gave a weak wave back. Logan watched her suspiciously. His hands clasping on the straps of his backpack.

“Hi, Miles!” Colleen said.

“Hi..hi Colleen,” I said sheepishly.

She walked to the picket fence. I started to feel my neck begin to sweat. We were outside the salt circle I’d put around my house.

“Coming back from school?” she asked. A dimpled smile on her face that felt wrong with her one eye covered.

“Yep,” Logan said. “Did something happen to your eye?”

Colleen touched it. Her smile vanishing. The wind picked up causing Logan and me to hold ourselves up straighter. Colleen’s hair waved wildly over her face. Seeing her hair flying around at different angles reminded me of the Kinseys. Their arms flailing while their hands remained limb. For a moment I thought she’d lost her eyepatch. But it was still on when the wind died down.

“Brrr.” Colleen shivered mockingly as if she were speaking with a child. “That was a chilly one. What was that you asked? My eye?”

She was smiling again. The brightness of her teeth noticeable even under the cloudy sky. Logan nodded. I was uncomfortable with how close she was to us.

Why am I scared of Colleen all of a sudden? I thought. I’ve known her since I was little?

But I knew that whoever was standing on the other side of that picket fence was not the Colleen I’d known. This didn’t feel like my mom’s friend chatting with us. This felt like something trying to be my mom’s friend.

“I got a bad eye infection. Just some pink eye. Harold thought I should’ve stayed home but I told him that the Kinseys, well, they really need me to watch the little guy.”

I knew it was a lie. I suspected that underneath the patch was a blue eye. The same as Mrs. Kinsey. The same as the child. I couldn’t be sure though. Part of me wanted to snatch the eye patch and see for myself. Thankfully I still had a grasp of personal boundaries.

“Where’re the Kinseys at?” I asked. “They leave a lot lately. I haven’t seen them since I moved in.”

Colleen’s hair went wild again. I saw her tilt her head one direction, then tilt it again the other. Her hair shielded her face but there was definitely no smile as she started to groan. It was what I expected a fish to sound like out of water. Logan started to pull at my jacket sleeve. I felt him tug harder as the backdoor to the house opened.

It was Rowan. He was laughing.

“Shit,” I said.

We started to run for my house. Colleen had leapt over the fence. Her arms were loose at her side and her legs bounding on the grass. I only saw her for a second but I could hear her. The thumping of her feet coming closer as Logan and me got to the door. I put in the code, Logan pushing me in, me pushing him in, and both of us slamming the door shut. Colleen slammed into it. A furry of knocks coming at the other end as Logan and me caught our breath.

When the knocking stopped, I checked the window to see Colleen standing on the back stairs next to Rowan. Both of them waved at us. Their faces in large smiles. The child’s brown eye winking in mockery of Colleen’s covered one. I shut the curtain.

“Did you notice that?” Logan said.

I looked at him. My heart still pounding.

“I didn’t notice anything. I was too busy running for my life.”

Logan gazed seriously at me. “The salt. The salt didn’t keep her out.”

I felt dizzy again. One of the things I’d been consistent about was the salt. It was one of the few protections I thought I had against the neighbors.

“No. No, it didn’t,” I said.

\_\_\_

I was quiet at dinner. A lot was going through my head at that time and the weather wasn’t helping. When the wind smacked hard on the house, I had to force myself not to flinch. The wind had gotten worse. I could hear the waves crashing on the beach’s rocks. I felt like a lighthouse keeper in our house. The lights flickering at times as a tree branch must’ve snagged on a powerline. I hoped that the lights wouldn’t go out. Not after what had happened that afternoon.   

Dad cooked hamburgers with some French fries. I only took a few bites. I wasn’t feeling that hungry either. Take note health influencers, fear and anxiety is a great way to eat less. My parents definitely noticed my poor appetite. Mom looked at me after she’d finished her burger.  

“You and Logan have an argument, Miles?” Mom asked.

“No,” I said. Trying to sound calm. “Why?”

“You’re just hardly eating,” she said. “Logan was less…”

“Loud?” Dad offered. Mom gave him a short stink eye that Dad shrugged at and apologized for as he took another sip of his beer.

“Lively,” Mom corrected. “That’s the word. He’s usually a lot more lively when he’s over.”

I’d given up on telling my parents the truth about what’s happened. There’s no way I can explain it without them thinking I’m having some mental problem or that I’m experimenting with drugs. I needed them to see it. That’s the only way they’ll believe it.

“We’re both just nervous about exams,” I lied.

“Oh, Miles,” Mom said. She patted me on the back. I don’t want to admit that getting a sympathetic pat from my mom didn’t feel nice. But it did. I really felt my mom’s concern for me. If only she knew what I was really frightened of.

“You’re so hard on yourself,” she said. “I’m sure you’ll both do just fine. You’ve been studying so hard with each other.”

Dad nodded in agreement.

I gave my best confident smile. It was probably as pitiful as a puppy dog begging for scraps.  

Exams were far from my mind. Logan and I had talked about what we could possibly be dealing with after escaping Colleen. I looked over Logan’s notes again. He inspected the photos I had on my camera of the Kinseys and Colleen. Of course, there was no child in any of them. After hours of watching and reading, neither of us could come to a definitive answer. Both of us can only give our best guess. We’ve landed somewhere in the ballpark of mind controlling aliens and a coven of shapeshifting witches.  

Don’t ask me to present the evidence. Because there’s none.

We saw Colleen leave the house after Mr. and Mrs. Kinsey returned. She didn’t act like the rabid feral woman from hell as she left. At least not from what we could tell. I wanted to know what she did when she wasn’t at the Kinsey House. Maybe her family was noticing things too. Or maybe the Kinseys had already gotten to them.

“Is Colleen doing alright?” I asked.

Mom and Dad shared a glance. I knew there was something in that look. I got a little hopeful thinking that perhaps they were noticing something off.

“Why’re you asking, hun?” Mom asked.

“Logan and I saw her today. She seemed…” I saw her crazed blonde hair, the overstretched smile, and the missing eye coming at me. “She seemed *different* when Logan and I saw her.”

Dad nodded. He looked again at my mom who gave him a silent nod. The lights dimmed and brightened again.

“Harold told me at work that she’s been having a lot of issues lately,” Dad said.

“What kind of issues?” I said.

Dad deferred to Mom. Her face frowning as she thought for a moment. Considering how best to tell her teenage son about her friend’s personal life.

“She’s been away from home a lot with this babysitting she’s been doing and I think it’s very nice of her to be doing it. But Colleen hasn’t been managing her time well.” Mom sighed. “I guess she forgot to pick up her sons from football practice and the day before.”

“Forgot them?” I said. “Her own sons?”

Mom shook her head. “I don’t think she forgot them. Just forgot the time.”

I didn’t think this was true. I was certain that the Kinseys had done something to Colleen’s mind.

“She also gave away all the forks I heard,” Dad said.

“The forks?” Mom asked.

Dad nodded. “Harold was mad about it. Pissed, actually. All the nice forks and spoons and knives. Even some plates that they’d inherited from his mom. All of it. Colleen gave it to Goodwill.”

My mom seemed concerned. She clearly hadn’t heard this and from the way she scratched her head I could tell it was making her worried for her friend. I was less worried from news my dad shared. Far from it. It was probably the best bit of news I’d heard. I could see the lightbulb going off in my head.

The Kinseys had also been nervous about our silverware when they came over. They’d washed their hands raw in our bathroom. It had to mean something. It had to mean there was a weakness. I looked at my fork, spoon, and knife on the dining table. All of them untouched as we ate our burgers and fries with our hands. As God intended.

“I don’t know how to feel about those neighbors,” Mom said angrily. “They leave their kid alone all day with Colleen. I should tell her to stop wearing herself so thin.”

I took a chance to ask a question Logan and me had been searching for.

“Where do they even go?” I asked. “Aren’t they retired?”

“I think Mr. Kinsey told me they visit friends from their old town,” Dad said.

I was feeling my excitement starting to grow. After weeks of recordkeeping, note taking, and photographing like a hyper-obsessed freak, my parents were giving me everything that neither me or Logan could figure out.

Who knew listening to your parents really can be rewarding. Sometimes. In moderation.

“Tinsdale,” my dad said. “I think the old man told me they came from the Tinsdale Lumber Town.”

Finally. I had a source. I managed to finish my burger which I think alleviated some of my parents’ worry. I excused myself from the table to go to my room, a knife from the kitchen table concealed in my shirt sleeve. When I was alone, I started to text Logan. I told him about the strange behavior around silver, Tinsdale, everything I could remember.

It didn’t take long for him to reply back.

“Werewolves!!! they gotta be werewolves!!!”

I was about to tell him we needed to find a way to Tinsdale when I caught sight of movement in the window. My excitement went cold. I went closer to the window, the knife in my hand. I expected the wind to have blown something across my field of vision but then I saw the lights in the living room next door.

The house’s curtains were open. I could tell there were two bodies standing on the other side. I grabbed the binoculars from my window ledge. It was the Kinseys. Their bodies stiff as they stared back at me. Their lips thin and straight. I waited for them to move. I felt my hand start to shake. I held my breath to keep the binoculars focused.

That’s when the bang came on my window. I flew back. My face sweating as I saw the blue and brown eyes looking up at me. His small hands smacking against the glass.

“Play with me,” Rowan said. “Play with me, boy. Play with me.”

I didn’t scream. I shivered with each breath I took. Rowan was deeply pale in the dark. His skin making him look like he was covered in white snow. His red hair was blowing crazily with the gusts of air beating it back and forth.

I raised the knife in my hand. That’s when the child’s joy vanished. For a moment I could see him snarl. His teeth black against his white skin as he raised his lip. I kept the knife raised at the window. All the playful joy he’d had was gone. Now he was threatened.

“Die,” he said. “Die on me, boy. Die.”

He backed away from the window. His movements predatory as he backed away. Never breaking eye contact. I kept looking. With each step he took I felt my courage rise. I smiled at him as he returned to the backdoor. The door opening on its own to let him in. The Kinseys fell to the floor and the curtains closed. The light flicked off. All was quiet again.

I kept my eyes on the living room window. I watched it until I was certain there was no movement. When I heard my parents go to bed, I went into the kitchen and grabbed some more forks, spoons and knives. I set them in a line on the ledge. A few more in front of my bedroom door. Hopefully I don’t forget about them if I have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.

When I was sure I had made a safe enough perimeter, I contacted Logan. I advised him to do the same thing in his room.

We have a way to defend ourselves. Now we need to form a plan. Some way to end the Kinseys. We need to find a way to Tinsdale. We need answers. Hopefully this can be over soon.

I’ll post again soon. In the meantime, stay safe.
