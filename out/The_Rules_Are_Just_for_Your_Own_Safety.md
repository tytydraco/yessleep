I’ve been working at this supermarket for about three months now. It’s nothing special, just a way to make some cash while I figure out what the hell I’m doing with my life. Most nights are slow, and the worst thing I usually deal with is an old lady trying to use an expired coupon or a teenager sneaking beer into the self-checkout.

But last night… last night was different.

My shift started like any other. My manager, Mr. Thompson, handed me a laminated sheet of paper as soon as I clocked in. “New overnight protocol,” he said, his voice tight. “Read it. Follow it. And for God’s sake, don’t break the rules.”

I frowned but took the list. It wasn’t unusual for him to make up weird rules—he once banned blue Gatorade because he thought it looked “untrustworthy”—but this was different. The paper was old, stained at the edges, and the rules… well, they made no damn sense.

**Overnight Supermarket Rules**

1. At exactly 11:15 p.m., make sure all shopping carts are inside. If any are left in the parking lot after this time, leave them. Do not go outside to retrieve them.
2. The security cameras will glitch between 11:30 and 11:45. Do not attempt to fix them. Do not look directly at the monitors during this time.
3. If you hear someone whisper your name in the frozen food aisle, do not respond. Do not turn around.
4. A man in a black hoodie may come in around midnight. He will not buy anything. Do not acknowledge him. Do not meet his eyes.
5. If you see a child alone in the store after 12:30 a.m., do not approach them. No matter how scared they look, no matter how much they cry, do not take their hand. They are not lost.
6. At 1:00 a.m., the intercom will turn on by itself. You will hear static, then a voice. It will sound like a loved one. It will beg you to open the stockroom door. Do not open the stockroom door.
7. If a customer tries to buy raw meat and milk together after 1:45 a.m., refuse the sale. If they persist, tell them, "We’re out of stock.” If they smile at you, leave your register immediately.
8. The lights in aisle 7 will flicker at 2:30 a.m. If they go out completely, leave the store. Do not look down aisle 7 as you exit.
9. If you hear the sound of heavy breathing near the break room, do not enter. Call Mr. Thompson immediately. If he doesn’t answer, wait outside until your shift ends.
10. Never, under any circumstances, look at your reflection in the freezer doors after 3:00 a.m.

I laughed at first, thinking it was some elaborate prank. But Mr. Thompson didn’t laugh. “Just follow the damn rules,” he said, rubbing his temples like he had the worst migraine in the world.

By the time 11:15 rolled around, I was already on edge. I had my hands on the door, ready to grab the last few shopping carts, when my phone buzzed. A text from Mr. Thompson.

**Leave them. NOW.**

I froze, my eyes darting to the parking lot. The carts sat there, gleaming under the flickering streetlights. And then—I swear to God—one of them moved. Just an inch, just enough to squeak against the pavement. There was no wind.

I stepped back inside and locked the doors.

At 11:30, the security monitors glitched. The screen warped, turning black and white, then static. For a second, I saw something—a shape, tall and thin, standing in the cereal aisle. The screen flickered again. The shape was closer. Right at the edge of the camera’s view. Another flicker. The screen went black.

At midnight, the man in the black hoodie arrived. He didn’t shop. He didn’t even pretend to. He just stood near the entrance, watching. His hood was pulled low, his hands stuffed in his pockets. I kept my eyes on the register, my breath shallow.

At 12:30, a child appeared near the candy aisle.

She was small, no older than six. Her dress was torn, her hair matted. She sniffled, rubbing at her eyes. “Mister,” she whimpered. “I can’t find my mommy.”

My hands trembled. “I can call someone for you,” I said, reaching for the phone.

“No.” Her voice was sharper now. “I just need you to take my hand.”

Something was wrong with her face. Her eyes were too dark, too deep, like two pits carved into her skull. My stomach churned.

I turned away.

At 1:00 a.m., the intercom crackled.

The voice that came through was my mother’s.

“Sweetheart,” she said. “I need you to let me in. Please, baby. I’m outside the stockroom.”

I gripped the counter, my heart hammering. My mother had died five years ago.

At 1:45, a man tried to buy raw steak and a gallon of milk.

When I refused, he smiled.

His teeth were too sharp.

At 2:30, the lights in aisle 7 flickered. Then they went out.

I grabbed my keys and ran. I didn’t look at aisle 7. I didn’t stop running until I was outside, gasping in the cool night air.

I wanted to quit, but something inside me needed to know more. The next night, I was scheduled with a new coworker, Jason. I asked Mr. Thompson why we suddenly needed two people on shift. He hesitated before saying, "The last guy who worked with me disappeared. We found that list of rules in his locker."

Jason was skeptical. He laughed at the rules and broke one on purpose.

He looked at his reflection in the freezer door at 3:00 a.m.

And then he started screaming.

I turned just in time to see him clutching his head, his mouth gaping open in a silent howl. His reflection didn’t move the same way he did. It smiled, stepped forward, and pulled him into the glass.

Jason was gone. His reflection walked away.

And then it turned to look at me.

I ran.

Now I understand why we follow the rules.

But it might already be too late for me.
