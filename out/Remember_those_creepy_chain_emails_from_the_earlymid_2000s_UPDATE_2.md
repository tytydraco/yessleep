Last night I ended up passing out on the motel couch. I woke up maybe about an hour ago with a dry throat, a sharp headache, feeling nauseous. Which actually wasn’t so bad. Because at least it managed to draw focus away from everything else.

My immediate instinct was to head for the shower. But then I stopped before entering the bathroom.

I began arguing with myself in my head. What could really happen? The moment I turned the water on, she’d be right there behind me? It wasn’t possible.

But then again, none of this should’ve been possible.

I decided to text Brito about it. Not sure how I was expecting him to respond, or whether he was going to take it serious.

But he told me that he was heading over. To just stay put. And absolutely do not enter the shower.

While waiting around for him, I started wondering about the logistics of it all. I’d never entered my room and the woman had never got to me.

So what if I just never took a shower? Would I be alright?

At the very least, I should’ve been okay to use the sink. I splashed my face with cold water until the grogginess had become something manageable. Then I made myself some instant coffee and stared out the window, tried to dissociate.

Brito showed up a few minutes later. There were three others with him. One was a middle-aged man wearing a polo shirt, slacks. The other two were hulking SWAT officers outfitted in what looked like full sets of gear.

The officers stood quietly by the door while the man in the polo shirt flashed an FBI badge, introduced himself as Stephens. His expression was hard to read. He was smiling, but for what reason I couldn’t tell. It certainly wasn’t friendly but it also didn’t seem malicious.

Brito asked me if I had taken a shower yet. I told him that I hadn’t. He nodded.

Stephens then asked if he could look at both emails. I said sure and then gave him my phone. His expression stiffened for the five or so minutes he spent looking them over. But as he handed the phone back to me, the smile had returned.

He said it was very important that I co-operate with what he was about to tell me next.

I was going to take a shower while they monitored me. I’d shut the curtains but they’d be there in the room with me.

This was probably the only situation where I would’ve ever agreed to something like that. Even though I wasn’t fully convinced that anything would happen.

They told me that there shouldn’t have been anything to worry about, since they still had a visual of the woman in my apartment. Apparently she still hadn’t moved. And it was pretty clear that neither of them were really entertaining the possibility of her teleporting over. The prevailing theory was still that the woman had somehow found a way to enter my apartment without me noticing. How she did that, I couldn’t begin to fathom. But I suppose that in the absence of any other explanations, it had to be true. 

So I asked them what reason they had to want to monitor me. What were they expecting?

They told me that they weren’t entirely sure. But the situation was bizarre enough that it had forced the need to confirm certain truths. To test some theories.

Suddenly there came this gnawing feeling that it wasn’t worth the risk. After all, I could just take a bath.

But was I only going to take baths from now on? What was I actually afraid of? The woman was still in my apartment. I had armed SWAT guarding me. What the fuck could possibly happen?

There was no way in hell I was going to live paranoid, looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life. I needed to confirm something as well. That I wasn’t in danger. That I had nothing to fear.

The plan was to have one of the officers stand out in the hallway by the front door while the other stationed himself right outside the bathroom.

Brito and Stephens both turned away as I stripped down, entered the shower. Doing so felt ridiculous enough that it managed to inject a bit of levity to the mood. But then I turned the water on and that disappeared almost immediately. Replaced by dread and uncertainty. It should’ve felt euphoric to scrub the dirt and sweat off of my skin. Instead my heart was beating heavy as I stared down at the drain.

I squeezed some shampoo into my hands and began massaging it into my scalp, though I continued to force my eyes open, keeping them on the drain.

But soon the stinging became too much and I closed them for just a few seconds as I wiped the shampoo away.

When I opened them back up, it looked like the water had taken on a brownish-green color.

At first I thought it could’ve been the shampoo. But then I could smell something rotten floating through the steam. Suddenly the spray plate from the showerhead dropped to the floor in front of me. The stench intensified.

It took me a few seconds too long to realize what was happening. I turned the water off and opened the curtains but before I could step out, I could feel something grab my hair. I tried yanking my head away but whatever was holding me had some kind iron grip. I couldn’t move. Both Brito and Stephens seemed frozen in place as they stared somewhere above me. Their eyes were wide and their mouths were slack. They looked shell-shocked.

I asked them to tell me what they were looking at cause I sure as hell didn’t want to turn around and find out for myself. But they didn’t tell me anything. Instead they yelled for the officer outside.

The bathroom door swung open but the officer stopped himself before entering. Though his mask was concealing his expression, his body language was telling enough. He shook his head, backed away. Then he ran out of the room.

I could feel whatever was holding my hair beginning to pull me up. As if it were trying to rip my scalp off.

Brito and Stephens continued to stand there, looking dumbfounded. I started to scream. But then the officer who had been out in the hallway rushed in. He also stopped at the doorway, hesitating for a moment before grabbing the knife from his belt and lunging towards me. Soon I could feel the pain and pressure alleviate. And the second I did, I leapt out of the tub.

Once I was out the bathroom, I turned around to see a pale arm retracting back into the showerhead.

It’s been a few hours since that happened. A chunk of my hair’s missing from where the officer had cut it off. My scalp’s been bandaged up and I ended up using the sink to scrub away whatever sewer water was left on my skin. Mentally I haven’t begun to recover at all.

I’m back at the police station now. I can feel everybody staring at me, though they all turn away whenever I try and look at them. A strange tension hangs in the air. Still no updates on Jackson. He might be out of the country by now. But they did give me an update on Elisa.

They can’t find her. She hasn’t been into work. Nobody’s seen her.

I know it’s my fault. I could’ve warned her. But would she have believed me? Would it have been too late anyways? How the fuck could I have seen this coming?

I've also learned that the woman is no longer in my apartment. From what I've heard, she disappeared right in front of the cops who had been watching her. They just blinked and she was gone. They think she's still in the motel. Somewhere in the pipes.

I’ve deleted all my emails. Every single address. The cops insisted I do so and I didn’t fight them on it.

But then I received a text message. From a number I didn’t recognize.

I should’ve paid more attention, been more careful. I shouldn’t have opened it. But I did.

*THE NEXT TIME YOU FALL ASLEEP, SHE WILL BE STANDING OVER YOU.*

*SHE WILL TAKE YOU. NO ESCAPE. NO ESCAPE. NO ESCAPE.*
