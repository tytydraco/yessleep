I prayed every night. I have my entire life, even when my faith faltered. Especially when my faith faltered. I kept the ritual up not because God ever answered my prayers but because it was nice to have someone I could tell everything to. A loving parent who doesn't judge me for fucking up.  

It was late winter, it must have been early February because the sun set later in the day, I wait until the sun is below the horizon to pray when everything changed. I kneeled down like every other night in the corner of my bedroom and I opened up to God. Everything I felt, everything I regretted. It was like a celestial diary. This time was different. I crossed myself but before I could stand my knees buckled and wouldn't move. A voice like a waterfall spoke to me, “Rachel, I have chosen you”. The voice radiated in my head, in my chest. The words wrapped around my insides like a snake.  

I wept until the sun rose. Years of faith validated in a single sentence. God was pleased with me. It was the acceptance I never had before and so desperately craved. I called back to God asking for what purpose He selected me, but it would be a long time before I heard Him again.  

Spring and summer turned to fall. I prayed even more. I could feel God with me everywhere I went. There was this feeling of levitating six inches into the air. Those were the best days of my life. Filled with mysterious purpose and unassailable confidence.  

My faith was transformed that fall. It is a time of transition and the drawing thin of barriers. Another nightly prayer, filled with endless praise and pleas for forgiveness. I placed my forehead on the ground and asked God to tell me what I was to do. Vibrations slithered from my stomach to my skull like living electricity. “You are going to kill for me,” I had no doubt that this was the holy and irrevocable decree of the King of kings and Lord of lords.  

My eyes pushed hard against my closed eyelids, the pressure in my skull was unbearable. I cried out in pain, prone on the floor to my Lord, “Who, Heavenly Father?” Tears were flung from my lips as I wailed. My muscled lost all sensation, I was not in control. I stood. Walked to my dresser and with one of my rosaries carved the name Father Thomas Blanton. I crumpled to the floor, my muscles still useless to me.  

The sensation of thousands of ants stinging my brain faded. There was a tremendous, wet pulling sound and then the vibrations descended to my gut. All that remained was a dull ache and unshakable resolve to do the work of the Lord.  

It was very easy to buy a gun. It was even easier to carry it under my dress into Mass. I watched intently. When Father Blanton held up the Host I stood. Pain racked my entire being, sharp ringing filled my ears. My muscles were numb again. The priest faced the altar, the back of his balding head pulsed and squirmed like there was some malevolent entity inside, pulling the strings.  

In the lowest whisper I have ever heard God spoke to me, “No man shall see me and live.” I saw the Host glisten in the stained glass light, I focused. Millions of hair-like worms writhed and churned. “If you will not obey me I will bring terror upon you, consumption and fever that waste the eyes and cause life to pine away. You shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. I will set my face against you, and you shall be struck down by your enemies; your foes shall rule over you, and you shall flee though no one pursues you.” 

I had no choice, I raised the gun and obeyed.  

It was easy to exit the church in the chaos. God has kept me safe from repercussions, though it's been weeks since I have heard his voice. I can feel something resting deep in my gut. The presence of God.
