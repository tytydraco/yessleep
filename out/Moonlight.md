The first night I met Him, it was His breathing that caught my attention. The sound was raspy and labored, yet wet, as though He was breathing through a punctured lung. There was a distinct gurgling noise that reminded me of my infant niece. I remember the last time I held her. She looked up at me with her bright, curious eyes and made a happy giggling sound that sounded like several bubbles popping in her throat. It’s fuzzy after that, most likely due to the concussion.

Through the crack in my curtains, the dull glow of the moon reflected off His eyes, forcing them to look as if they were giving off their own light source. 

I squeezed my eyes shut in the hopes that He would go away, that I might wake up to the brighter light of the morning sun gliding across my bed. Another body warm and real next to mine. 

No such thing happened. There was a sound, barely audible but easily identifiable. The shuffling of fabric, and the soft creak of a floor board. They broke through the silence of the night paired with the sounds of my own frenzied panting, each sound layered on top of each other in a haunting triad. 

Meeting His eyes, I saw that they were bigger. Closer. I was delirious with sleep and fear, uncertain if what I saw was truly there, so, just to be sure, I closed my eyes once more in a move of irrational stupidity. More shuffling. More creaking floor boards. It then occurred to me that it did not matter if I was dreaming or not. I opened my eyes and saw that those twin lights were almost to my bed, that rusted, bubbled breath a deafening siren in my ear. 

I did not blink for the rest of the night, and neither did He. I did not blink the night after either, nor the night after that. And neither did he.

Every night, when the sun dances away and out of sight over the horizon, He emerges with His glowing eyes and His wet breathing. 

I’d tried locking the closet door once, foolishly thinking myself a genius as I slipped into bed and closed my eyes without fear. I was halfway to falling asleep when I heard the squeal of the door and opened my eyes with a panicked gasp, finding Him already halfway across the room. 

He wheezed with every inhale, sometimes choking on his own air. With his face shrouded in darkness, my curiosity yearned to know what he looked like. My more rational brain tells me I would never be able to forget. 

How long has it been since I’ve slept?

He waits. For the incessant tugging on my eyelids to grow too aggressive for me to ignore. 

Sometimes I catch myself drifting off, only to be roused by the soft creaking of His steps. I cannot tell if He’s getting faster, or if I am sliding further and further. 

If anyone finds this—please know that I tried. 

I’m sorry.
