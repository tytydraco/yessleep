Don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I’ve been hearing some weird things coming from the living room and was hoping to get some help

For context, I'm 17, been living in this house since we moved when I was 5. I have 2 dogs, a fish, and a 13 year old little brother. I stay up pretty late usually just playing games or eating food and go to bed around 2 am on the weekends.

The house is pretty old, there’s a lot of creaks and squeaks that just happen through the day and when you walk around and stuff.

I’m pretty much the only one who stays up late because my parents have work in the morning and my brother has a strict bedtime, but I’ve been hearing some weird noises lately at night.

It's not with every noise I make. Sometimes I'll go into the kitchen and cook some noodles in a pot or crack open a hard boiled egg and there’s nothing, but every time I walk out of the room I hear what’s almost like a second pair of footsteps behind me that follow me all the way to the bedroom

It's been freaking me out a little bit but I know it's nothing because my dogs would go crazy if there was something there but something else happened last night that made me wanna post about this.

My dogs were whining a bunch, which sometimes they do because they hear my neighbor's dogs barking or a car driving down the road, but anyways I came out of my room to calm them down. Both of them are in a kennel because it helps them get calm before bedtime, and all the lights are off, so it's pretty dark.

When I left the hallway I started gently shushing them but it wasn't working. They just started getting louder, which I thought was weird because I didn't hear anything that could be causing it before. But at one point I did my usual "shh-shh-shh-shh" again and they immediately went silent.

Then I heard a "shh-shh-shh-shh" back.

I instantly froze because it sounded like it came from behind the couch next to my dogs' kennels. I know nobody else was awake so I didn't know who it could be. I nervously said "Hello?" and instantly heard a "hello" from the same place back. It kinda sounded like me but more like if a parrot was trying to copy my voice or something.

I didn't really know what to do I was so scared. I was basically a statue. Then I heard the footsteps I usually hear, but this time I wasn't moving.

I immediately just turned around and started running back to my room. It was horrible. I could hear them getting closer with every step I took.

When I made it back to my room I immediately turned on my light and slammed my door and it was all quiet again. I haven't heard anything since but even during the day today I feel like something is watching me and I’m too scared to find out what happens tonight. My parents told me they got woken up by me slamming the door last night and asked me why I did that but I don't think I can tell them, I’m too old to be scared of monsters. What should I do???
