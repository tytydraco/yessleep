Has God always condemned my people and I to die? Has He cursed the waters of Lake Titicaca as well? 

“This lake has fed my ancestors since the days they tracked time using the stars. They fed me when Mother Pachamama birthed my soul in the womb, but will they now feed off the body of my infant son?” 

Father Ramirez gave me his typical crass expression and did not respond immediately. I waited for him to insult me but he just kept glaring angrily at a golden plaque which read “BUILT IN 1582”. 

“Dear Ruben, I owe you an apology.”

“Father, with all due respect, are you playing some sort of game? The main source of food for our village is in peril. We cant…”

“Shut up and listen mortal. For years, I have insulted you and the last remaining Uru people for continuing your indigenous traditions. Even you mentioning your deity Pachamama reeks of blasphemy. However, I see now your traditions and this anomaly are linked”

He passed me a copy of the local paper and its horrifying new headline.

DOCTORS PERPLEXED AS CHILD GROWS HANDS OUT OF STOMACH AND DIES AFTER EATING LOCAL FISH

I almost fainted at the sight of a picture of the child and the putrid, scaly black hand in his abdomen along with a fish with many similar smaller hands. I could not hold tears back. 

“Father, my family has been fishermen for over six generations, it can’t end like this.” 

“I do not think it will Ruben. You may be the only one who can find the source of this fish and the vessel of the infection. Follow me, I must show you the secret of this cathedral.” 

Father Ramirez lit a torch and took me to an underground level I did not know existed. This place resembled catacombs, and went so far we had to get a 10 foot ladder and climb down over an edge. 

As I struggled to find my way in complete darkness, Father Ramirez’s torch illuminated a stone wall with several crude drawings on it.

“Did you know that it was your people, the Urus, who built this cathedral and not the Spanish conquistadors?” 

“My grandfather once told me a rumor any Uru who resisted the influence was buried below the cathedral, but I know nothing else”

“Correct, the Spanish punished all rebels by forcing them to build this cathedral, then threw them in this pit of darkness. Before they ate each other, they must have found minerals to make these things.”

The embers of the torch revealed two crude carvings. The first showed several figures in traditional Uru garment singing with some sort of tall, winged, and beaked figure. Interestingly, this bird entity had something resembling gills in its wings and sat in water. 

The second carving showed armored men and carrying crosses and slaying the winged figures, particularly targeting the gills.

“When my predecessor showed me these carvings, I thought they were the drawings made by men gone insane due to the darkness. He also said only two drawings existed, he lied.”

“What do you mean he lied?”

“Look below you.”

Father Ramirez walked and illuminated the ground below. I screamed when I saw I was standing over the carving of a scaly black hand, except this one had an eye on it. 

As it stepped back and the catacomb became illuminated, the fire revealed an eel like figure with ten arms sitting in some body of water. Each hand had that same eye on it. 

The only other detail on this figure was a moon above it with no traces of any figure from the other two carvings. 

“The doctors from the capital are calling the report of the fish and the child a black magic sham and they refuse to even investigate. However, we both know what we saw. You know your people better and if you want to protect your livelihood, this may aid you.”

With his advice, I decided to sail around the basin of the lake after midnight. My child even questioned why I went to “work” so late. If only he knew that this was for him. 

Because some fish species become more active at night, I have a lot of experience fishing at night. I set up my lights, and decided to test and catch a net of fish to see how many had this infection.

As I reeled up a net with some fish caught in it, I shined my light to almost vomited at the sight.
Several species of fish had grown the same hands, along with some snails that were trapped in the net. While the snails had it coming out of their shells, the fish all had the hands coming out of their eyes. 

How far could this infection have reached? How could it spread to other species in the lake? 

Suddenly, something sliced through my next. As all the fish came down, whatever this thing was began attacking under my boat. 

I started my engine and began to drive it away, but it became relentless in its mission to try damaging the boat. 

However, even this creature had predictable attack patterns, almost like it had optimized its boat destruction skills.

As it attacked, my hands waited for the perfect opportunity to drive a spear through. However, this creature rose from the waters and revealed its sharp wings as it tried to stab me with its beak.

The velocity of this creature should have beaten my reflexes ended my life. However, the creature began to violently choke, as if sick.

My lantern illuminated the creature’s pink plumage. Its wings had pulsating gills where a black hand with two fingers missing grew out of the left wing. The towering flamingo-like creature dropped to its knees, and stuttered as it spoke. 

“Your face…Our tribes never fought each other. Remember, Uru? We had an agreement.”

It began to cough more black sludge out of its beak. 

“I was never part of any contract. Why did you release the fish?”

“So either the old Urus have died or you have betrayed us to the armored men. It doesn’t matter now, my kin have all perished to its influence, and we will be next.” 

“The armored Spanish men have long left these lands. They no longer have influence here.”

“That is where you are mistaken Uru. Those men interfered with our duty and released The Creator of this lake.”

“You’ve been around since the creation of this lake?”

“The Creator made this lake to feed off the creatures which inhabited it. That included us ancient beings. My kin have devoted themselves to containing its gluttony while your people used rituals to seal it at the depths of this lake. The armored men called it blasphemy.”

“What does The Creator even look like? Is it a colossal beast?”

“I don’t remember Uru. I haven’t seen it ever since its essence died.”
 
The creature released a bellow as it pecked on one of its wings. A finger grew back on the hand of its left wing.

“How can I help you? I think we have the same interest in protecting the lake and those who benefit from it.”

“I will succumb to this infection soon. You need to figure out how to destroy the body of the Creator.”

“What do you mean?”

“The armored men were wicked savages who slayed anyone who did not resemble them, Uru or ancient being. They also had powerful rituals, calling to their so called God. However, they made a mistake with The Creator.

No matter how many spears or gunpowder they put into it, they could not pierce its scales. Eventually, they called upon their deities, who promised to slay the beast. 

The Creator, however, only died in essence, not in body. The armored men thought they could just dump the corpse at the bottom of the lake, thinking it has died. The malevolent essence may have died but the body putrified and created a new type of forbidden life. The Creator lives in death and it is trying to recreate its essence by using other beings.” 

“If I could then find a ritual to destroy its body. Could the Creator’s infection vectors seize? Its soul can no longer exist, can it?”

“I cannot… say… Uru. End my life and show me mercy so I may rejoin Pachamama. Its influence caused me to release the fish. I am now a vector. You must go to the resting place of the armored men.”

“But they escaped ages ago, how could I find them.”

“They’re under a cathedral that says 1 5 8 2” 

As the creature began to bellow more, I drove a spear through its chest, and in its eyes, I saw the creature finally felt real freedom. 

I decided to march back to Father Ramirez as he probably knew the ritual to end The Creator.

I found him eating his lunch.

“Ruben, did you find answers about the infection?”

“I thought priests were not supposed to lie.”

“Ruben, my oath forbids me from sin… I have never…”

“Shut the fuck up. You said the old Urus were buried at the bottom of the cathedral, not the Spanish conquerors.”

“Oh, so one of the guardians lived huh. I thought my old body wiped them centuries ago. The Urus locked away the Spanish because they also could not resist the influence. It is why you were born, to serve.” 

“You caused this, didn’t you?” 

“You see this meal? The body and blood of Christ never served me. The flesh of the animals of the lake tastes so much better. It is why He chose me as his new vessel.” 

If you see a fish with a hand, the influence has reached you. Don’t resist it. It is the next step of transcending our bodies to the gods. 

Join us, eat with us, transcend with us.
