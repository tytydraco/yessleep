I cannot *believe* that I’m going through this right now. This cannot be happening to me…in fact, it *shouldn’t be happening at all*. It’s impossible. I think I’m posting this on the internet with whatever hope I have left that someone -- anyone at all-- can help me make this stop. I have lost sleep, I’m on probation at work, my girlfriend has left me, my life is in shambles.   


All because of *her*.   
  
*She* shouldn’t be here. It’s just not possible. After all, she’s been gone for fifteen years…  
  
And yet I see her every night now. Staring at me from the darkest corners of my house, or peering through half-closed doors. Even right now, as I write this, I can see half of her face in the doorway to the hallway, her wide eyes on me. And, oh God, she’s doing that horrible teeth-chattering thing that she always does…  
  
*“Chutchutchutchutchutchut…”*   
  
I just want it to stop. That’s why I’m here. If I write it all out here, maybe someone reading this can tell me what I can do to get my life back to normal, to make her go away.   
  
Please, just make Emily go away. All I wanted was closure…I never wanted any of this.   
	  
Ugh, there she goes again.   
  
*“Chutchutchutchutchutchut…”*  
  
Jesus. I can’t take this anymore. 	  
  
  
Let me at least try to explain to you guys what happened.    
  
This whole nightmare started about two weeks ago when I was in my bed scrolling through TikTok, which I typically do right before going to sleep. I was home alone, as my (now ex-) girlfriend was spending the night at her mom’s. As I was scrolling through a couple slideshows of early 2000’s nostalgia, an ad for a self-help app came up. I feel like these types of ads are pretty common nowadays, promoting therapy websites and self-improvement gurus. Chances are if you’re reading this, you probably scroll past these all the time. This one was for an app that the spokeswoman pronounced as “Closure”, but was stylized as “CL0SUR3”.     
  
I’m going to try to be as precise as I can so that, should you come across this ad while scrolling, you can swipe right past it and save yourself from literal torture.   
  
Wait. There it is again.   
  
*“Chutchutchutchutchutchut…”*

  
Ugh.    
  
Anyways…the ad for CL0SUR3 is very fast-paced, like most TikTok promotions are. You know the style: a lot of camera cuts and quick talking. The spokeswoman was the only person featured on-screen. She was absolutely stunning: smooth skin, blonde hair, sharp blue eyes, an infectious smile full of dazzlingly white teeth. This woman was angelic, and I found myself stopping on the video just to look at her. What can I say, I’m a sucker for a pretty face.   
  
Her voice was cheery and confident, practically hypnotizing, as she spoke:   
  
“Smiling comes so much easier to me now that I’ve downloaded CL0SUR3. I used to be someone who let their problems stew and bother them for *years*…but now all of that dead weight is behind me. Using CL0SUR3, I’ve confronted my problems head-on, so I can be--”   
   
A cutaway showed her in a rather revealing Wonder Woman-esque outfit.   
  
“--a SUPERHERO!”   
  
It cut back to her in civilian clothes, but she still wore that delicious smile on her face.   
  
“Download today and leave all of your past troubles, your dead weight, behind! You owe it to yourself to be happy. You owe it to yourself to find closure!”   
  
A little link at the bottom of the video opened up to the App Store. The app’s icon was a little white “C” on a field of dark gray.   
  
The TikTok cycled through again: “Smiling comes so much easier--”   
  
I paused it and contemplated, staring hard at the little link to the App Store. My thumb hovered over it.   
  
*Leave all of your past troubles, your dead weight, behind!*    
  
That sounded pretty nice to me, at the time. You see, as I’m writing this, we’re coming up on the anniversary of something traumatic that I’ve had to deal with for quite a while. This time of year it always feels a little more raw. It used to eat away at me constantly, twenty-four seven, but these days it’s usually just around late summer when my mental health declines.   
	

Not to say that I’m perfectly fine the rest of the year -- I’m not. I don’t particularly think very highly of myself. Ever since this particularly traumatic event happened to me--  
  
*FUCK!* She’s not even pretending to hide in the doorway anymore. Her whole head is poking out, looking at me. The light from my desk lamp is the only thing illuminating her face…  
  
God, those eyes. They’re the widest I’ve ever seen, and so bloodshot. Even after two weeks I can't believe this. It’s just not possible.   
  
Oh man, and there she goes with the teeth again…   
  
*“Chutchutchutchutchut.”*  
  
Alright, let me get back on track here. This is getting worse by the minute, but I need to stay focused so I can get someone here to help me out.    
	  
So, without going too far into detail, something happened to my neighbor Emily when we were kids. Something that really just fucked me up for life. I’ve always been too chickenshit to seek any help for it. I’ve never seen a therapist, never even talked to a family member about what I’m going through.  
  
Like I said before, this time of year it gets extra bad. As summer starts coming to an end, as autumn rears its cold, gloomy head round the corner, the more the incident with Emily bothers me. It never got so bad that it interfered too much with my day-to-day, but there would be horrible dips in my mood when the memories came flooding back and I wouldn’t feel like myself. All I felt was numbness.   
  
At the time, I figured that maybe an app like this could stop that numbness.   
	  
I followed the link to the App Store and tapped the “download” button. I now wish to God I hadn’t, but how was I supposed to know then?  
  
CL0SUR3 installed onto my phone and I opened it up right away.   
  
Again, I am going to try to give you guys as many details as I can about all of this so that you can avoid it (and so that you can help me).   
  
Like its logo, CL0SUR3’s interface was dark gray with white lettering. The first thing it had me do was make an account. Simple enough. Then, it got right into the nitty gritty with a short survey to “calculate the amount of closure” I needed.   
  
The first question of this survey was presented to me: “HOW BADLY DO YOU FEEL YOU NEED CLOSURE WITH A SITUATION IN YOUR LIFE?”  
  
Normally with apps like these, they’ll have a couple of options to choose from, but not CL0SUR3. To my surprise, a little microphone icon popped up underneath the question. I pressed and held it, and the app started to record.   
	

I answered, “Uhh, pretty badly.”   
  
Question Two popped up: “DO YOU OFTEN HAVE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS OR FEELINGS?”   
  
The microphone icon again. I pressed it and held the phone up close to my mouth.  	  
  
“...yes.”   
  
Question Three: “CAN YOU TRACE BACK YOUR NEED FOR CLOSURE TO ONE SIGNIFICANT EVENT?”   
  
“Yes.”   
  
“PLEASE STATE YOUR FIRST NAME AND LAST NAME OUT LOUD.”   
  
I frowned. Why would they bother to ask this after having me register an account?  
  
I replied, “Kirk **\[removed\]**.”   
  
  
“HELLO, KIRK! NICE TO MEET YOU. LET’S GET YOU GOING ON YOUR QUEST FOR CLOSURE!”   
  
I sat up in my bed, readying myself. Maybe this could be it, the beginning of the end of this wretched numbness I felt.    
  
Question Four. “YOU STATED THAT YOUR NEED FOR CLOSURE CAN BE TRACED BACK TO ONE SIGNIFICANT EVENT. CAN YOU TELL US THE YEAR THIS EVENT OCCURRED?”  
  
“Uhhh…2008? Wait, no -- 2009.”  Same year I graduated high school.   
  
Question Five. “DID THIS EVENT DEEPLY INVOLVE ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL?”   
  
“Yes.”   
  
“PLEASE STATE THEIR FIRST AND LAST NAME.”   
  
I frowned at Question Six. Why would they need the details here? This was all starting to feel like some sort of weird scam, like they’d ask for my credit card number after wasting my time.   
  
Welp…nothing ventured, nothing gained…or so I figured.   
  
“Emily **\[removed\]**.”  
  
“THANK YOU,” the app replied. A little loading wheel came up before the next prompt arrived: “IN THREE SENTENCES OR LESS, GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION TO SUMMARIZE THIS EVENT AND HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT.”   
  
My heartbeat quickened. This was gonna get real uncomfortable, real fast. I supposed, however, that if I wanted to be comfortable, I wouldn’t have gone this far already. Maybe this app really could be a step in the right direction if I just finally got this all out. Maybe this app could actually help me if I just pushed through my comfort zone.   
  
“I, uh…when I was in high school…my next-door neighbor, Emily, was assaulted and killed at her job. She and I were pretty close. I feel really, really sad about it because I…I was deeply in love with her at the time.”  
   
My thumb lifted from my phone screen, and with it a weight lifted off my chest.   
  
I had hardly spoken those words to anyone in the past fifteen years.   
  
*Whew*, I thought. *That actually felt good to get out.*    
  
It definitely did, but what could this app actually *do* with the information I had just given it? What could it possibly have to say next -- “sorry, bro, that sucks to hear”?  
  
Question Seven shook me.   
  
“WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO EMILY IF SHE WERE STILL HERE?”   
  
The mic popped up again, waiting for me to press it and reply.   
  
*How the hell does it understand me so quickly?* I wondered. I chalked it up to AI -- after all, isn’t AI getting more complicated and useful every day? Maybe this app was utilizing some sort of high-functioning AI…  
  
No matter how the app knew, I couldn’t help but be floored by its question. What a crazy thing to ask, and an even crazier thing to answer.   
  
I still did, though.   
  
“I would say…I would say that I’m sorry for what happened to her, and that I wish she were still here. She was my best friend, and I really did love her. I have never felt anything with anyone else that even came remotely close to the love I had for her. I might even *still* love her, even though she’s gone.”   
  
Another weight lifted off of me as I began to cry. Let me tell you, I *never* cry…even in my miserable numbness, tears never find their way out. This was more than a sense of relief, it was ecstasy; had I known for sure talking about this even a little would help me out, maybe I should have started therapy years ago.   
  
“THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL ANSWER, KIRK. THANK YOU FOR SHARING IT!” The little loading circle came up again, as if the app was processing something, before it continued on to give me the next Question: “CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU FELT WHEN EMILY WAS MURDERED?”  
  
  
Wow. This was some AI. It was like I was talking to an actual person. The fact that it had specifically written “murdered”...it was taking in everything that I was saying.   
  
It took me a while to collect myself and reply. “Scared. Alone. Like I wasn’t myself. I haven’t been myself in so long.”   
  
“I UNDERSTAND, KIRK.   
  
“CAN YOU DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL WHAT HAD HAPPENED? PLEASE TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED. THIS IS FOR CLOSURE, AFTER ALL.”   
  
I’ll be honest to you guys, I can’t recall what I had said VERBATIM at this part, but I can at least para*FUCK!*   
  
*OH FUCK!*  
  
Sorry, all. Emily just full-on *sprinted* from the hallway to the closet in my office here. Slammed the closet door shut super-hard. Let me collect myself for a minute before continuing, that scared the absolute shit out of me. That was the closest she’s gotten to me since this all started.   
  
Okay, I’m good. I hear her teeth chattering in the closet and it’s freaking me out, but what *isn’t* freaking me out about this? Might as well just keep pushing on, here.  
  
Anyways, like I was saying: I can’t recall what I said VERBATIM at this part, but I can at least paraphrase what it was. This is a lot of details, and the recording I left on the app must have been over five minutes long, and there was a lot of crying in between it all, but I’ll do my best to give you the gist of everything I said.   
  
Basically, I had a crush on my neighbor Emily all through high school. We were the same age, grew up together, but I hadn’t really noticed her in “that way” until I saw her my freshman year. With the removal of her braces and the purchase of some contacts in lieu of glasses, she had gone from a quiet, timid little thing to a confident and beautiful young lady. I wasn’t alone in my admiration-- *all* the guys liked her.   
  
Young, too scared and inexperienced to flirt, I got close to her by becoming her friend. It started with simply doing homework together, but soon we were chatting at one another’s houses every night. When it got late and one of us would go home, the other would IM to keep the conversation going. The more I spent time with her, the more I started to fall for her. I loved the way her nose crinkled when she laughed, the shine in her bright blue eyes when something excited her, the casual bun she’d tie her beautiful blonde hair into when she didn’t feel like styling it. She must have known back then that I liked her…I was red in the face anytime she was around. I could hardly even maintain eye contact with her. She *must* have known how much I…  
  
*“Chutchutchutchutchut…”*   
  
Ugh. She’s chattering her teeth even louder in the closet right now. She did that back when I told the story out loud to the app…at the same part. That’s weird. Can she read what I’m typing from in there, somehow?   
  
Either way, let’s keep going. Almost done.   
  
Emily had her fair share of boyfriends, and not all of them were great. Pretty girls can attract trouble, and teenage boys are trouble incarnate. There were a lot of petty fights and breakups. But whose shoulder did Emily cry on when the boys broke her heart over and over and *over* again?   
  
Mine. And I was happy to do it. At first.   
  
When sophomore year came, a lot of angst came with it. I started to wonder -- if I was such a good guy, such a good *friend*, why didn’t Emily ever seem interested in dating *me*? Was something wrong with me? Was she messing with me? Someone so beautiful, picking on her dorky little next-door neighbor. That had to have been what it was, so I figured. Resentment started to brew.   
  
I began to pull away from her and isolate myself. She’d IM me and I’d ignore it. She’d try to say hi in the hallway at school and I’d blow right past her. How could she dare do this to me? Parade around with all these other guys while I sat on the sidelines like a benchwarmer, waiting for any modicum of romance to spark between us? It wasn’t *fair*.   
  
Junior year came by and I isolated myself even further. What little friends I had distanced themselves from me as my anger towards Emily bordered on obsession. I stalked her social media. I wrote journals professing both my love and hatred of her. With any guy that she dated, I went out of my way to know everything I could about them, to compare myself to them. Most nights were spent up late, tirelessly hating other people by following them on social media. Deep down I knew I never could hate them as much as I hated myself…but I still tied it all back to Emily. It was self-destructive.    
  
Senior year, Emily started dating this real piece of work named Dylan. The guy was a dropout, a townie with a bad rep that locals hated, but the guy had a flawless face. Big brown eyes that I remember a lot of the girls talked about. By the time Emily started dating him, I was so deep in my self-pity that it took a while for me to hear the rumors about them: that Dylan was beating her, constantly yelling at her, that they were doing drugs together.   
  
Then came the night that changed everything. It was after school, and I was, as always, mulling about alone in my room, hating the world. Hating myself.   
  
There was a knock at my door -- Emily. Crying hysterically.   
  
Before I could even speak, she unloaded on me. Telling me how she felt terrible that we had drifted apart over the years, that she didn’t know what she had done to make me so mad, that she was sorry, and that she really needed a friend in this very dark point of her life. She looked *terrible*. Paler, skinnier, one bruised eye. I figured then that maybe there was some truth to the rumors about her new relationship with brown-eyed Dylan.   
  
Do you want to know what I said to her then? To this poor girl that just wanted to reconcile with her friend, to simply get some help?     
  
“Shut up, Emily,” I said, and shut the door in her face.   
  
Four years of self-inflicted pain, but I felt so vindicated in the moment. I felt like, for the first time, I had stood up for something for my own sake--  
  
*“Chutchutchutchutchut…”*  
  
Shut up, Emily.   
  
Anyways, that evening, after stopping at my house and getting the door slammed in her face, she walked to work at the small local restaurant that she waited tables at. She worked the closing shift and was responsible for locking the place up at the end of the night, leaving the restaurant at a little before 11pm.   
  
Nobody ever saw her alive again.   
  
The authorities questioned a lot of people, including me. I told them upfront everything that had happened right before Emily went into work that night, and what I had said to her. I told them why as well. The cops that talked to me weren’t exactly subtle in expressing their distaste for what I did. I remember one of them even saying something along the lines of, “If you had kept that door open, your neighbor might be home safe by now.”   
  
The day after they questioned me was the day they found her body. Dylan’s father had an icebox in his garage, and found poor Emily shoved into it. She had been violated before being suffocated with a plastic bag. Dylan, a town pariah already, was immediately arrested. He was convicted for Emily’s murder not too much longer.   
  
And I’ve lived with that entire experience ever since.

That was my answer to CL0SUR3’s Question. Again, not verbatim, but the gist. And now you all know the story too.   
  
Imagine my surprise when the app only responded to my story with one last message:   
  
“THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER. CONNECTION FINALIZED. CLOSURE IS ON THE WAY.”   
  
And with that, the CL0SUR3 app disappeared. The window closed, and the app icon was gone. Frowning, I pulled up the app store to redownload, but my search brought up nothing.   
  
*What the hell?* I thought. *What just happened?*   
  
I opened TikTok and scrolled to find and replay the ad. To my relief, I was greeted with that video of the blonde spokeswoman, and she once again she started:   
  
“Smiling comes so much easier to me now that I’ve downloaded CL0SUR3. I used to be someone who let their problems stew and bother them for years…but now all of that dead weight is behind me.”  
  
The spokeswoman took a step forward, still smiling into the camera.   
  
“Is it behind you too, now? Is that dead weight behind you, too?  
  
“Is it? Is it behind you?   
  
“Is that dead weight behind you, Kirk?”   
  
My phone, despite being charged well enough, died. I was looking at my own horrified face in the reflection of the black screen. My heart pounded in my chest.   
  
*What the fuck…?*  
  
*How the fuck…?*   
  
And that was when I heard it for the first time, from the hall outside my bedroom, the clicking off teeth:   
  
*“Chutchutchutchutchutchut…”*   
  
\_\_\_

  
She follows me everywhere I go, now. A lot of times she does things just to startle me, with her gray-blue face and her large, bloodshot eyes. At work she’ll wait until I’m alone, like in the bathroom, to show her face. If I was on a date in public with my ex-girlfriend, I’d see Emily out of the corner of my eye, sometimes contorted into spaces no person could ever fit into (one instance comes to mind in which I literally found her hunched under a dining room chair at a restaurant). She never lets me sleep…it’s like she’ll wait until I’m just about to fall asleep before she comes right up to my ear, teeth chattering.   
  
No one believes me about her, or about CL0SUR3. Not my co-workers. Not my ex-girlfriend, who thought I was a lunatic. I have no one now.   
  
No one except Emily.   
  
*“Chutchutchutchutchut…”*   
  
God, I wish she’d stop that. Why does she do that?   
  
Is she somehow still cold from the icebox, I wonder? After all that happened to her?   
  
*“Chutchutchutchutcut…”*  
  
STOP, Emily.    
  
*“Chutchutchutchutcut…”*  
  
Maybe you people will believe me. If you get an ad for CL0SUR3, *don’t download it*. I don’t think there’s any stop to this…I think this is how it’s going to be for me forever.   
  
*“Chutchutchutchutchut…”*   
  
When the app said “closure”, was it meant for me? Or for *her*?   
  
*“Chutchutchut…”*  
  
Oh, God, I can’t deal with this. It’s driving me insane. I’m begging you.  
  
*“Chutchutchut…”*   
  
God, *please* make it stop. Anyone make this stop. Can *anything* make this stop? I'll admit it, I'll admit to anything you want.   
  
*“Chutchutchut…”*   
  
Dylan wasn’t the one who did it.   
  
*“Chutchutchutchutchut…”*   
  
I did it.  
  
*“Chutchutchutchutchut…”*   
  
And I put her in the icebox, too.
