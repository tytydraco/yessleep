This is a very personal case of a missing person, and a case that has never really been publicised anywhere because of the fact that it has never been treated by the authorities as involving foul play or involuntary disappearance. Also, one guy serving in the police was helpful insofar as he did some investigation and obtained information that he wasn't technically allowed to obtain. Therefore, I will change all the names of the people involved and – if need be – the places where this case played out. Though I'm going to say that it played out in a country in Europe. 

So, I would like to talk about the disappearance of my cousin Jake (again, name changed). He was 27 years of age when it was discovered that he had disappeared. But let's firstly get to what he was like as a person, from my personal experience and from the stories that I've been told about him.

He was a good-looking man, known to be rather private, which in his case I think didn't mean he was in any way isolated, secluded or even antisocial. When you were around him, when you were talking to him or spending time with him, he always used to be pleasant to be around. You could have deep conversations with him, too. However, it could sometimes be difficult to get in touch with him in the first place, which was pretty annoying at times for most of the people who had gotten to know him and who had taken a liking to him. From what I understand and experienced, he often wouldn't call or text his closest relatives for weeks, such as his parents and brothers. Though in turn, he would make sure and reach out when there was a birthday of a loved one and similar occasions. He would make sure to be with his family (i.e. his mom, dad, and brothers) for Christmas, Easter, and other such holidays; and bring gifts and presents and such. They would tell me how he would come home with a huge bouquet of flowers for his Mom on Mother's Day or a customised cake for his Dad's birthday, because he knew his Dad had a sweet tooth. 

But basically, it was generally understood that he just liked to be alone. He was an intelligent guy, too. He had good proficiency in four languages, was usually up-to-date about what was going on in the world, shared his views and opinions on certain topics. He was a well-spoken, soft-spoken guy. The thing was, however of course, that you would often get the impression of him seeming a little standoffish, aloof and distanced. But everybody simply thought that was the nature of his personality.

Outside of birthdays, traditional holidays and other special occasions, it was hard to meet him or even get in touch with him, as I have mentioned before. It seemed as though he had always a polite excuse. Sometimes you might have gotten the impression that he was talking a lot, but was saying really nothing at the same time. 

During his early adulthood, he was supposedly dealing with some mental health issues, which – when I once cautiously asked him about them directly – he had "resolved by himself" and that there was "nothing to worry about". He also admitted to having trouble sleeping, for which he had been taking medication regularly. According to him, he was able to manage his sleep very well that way. He also let his immediate family and some relatives (including myself) know that he was gay, which he preferred never to make any fuss about. We didn't either, so his sexual orientation was never really an issue; we had suspected it anyway, and we were all, so to speak, "chill" about it, shrugged it off, and so did he.
He was overall quite traditionally-minded, but would sometimes talk freely about a longterm relationship with a man he had, and that he eventually ended it after several years—for personal reasons. As far as I and his family know, he was still on good terms with that very ex-boyfriend. I don't remember him ever losing a bad word about his ex, who he had travelled a lot with and who had kind of "showed him the world".

Going back in time to his teenage years, he moved out from his parents' home very early even for today's standards (like at 16 or 17?). He rented a flat, began his studies at university (about a language-related subject. I don't know what it was exactly) while taking various part-time jobs over many years, and living alone ever since. According to his parents' statements, he frequently had trouble paying his bills working only part-time jobs alongside his studies.

Then suddenly, two years preceding his disappearance, he supposedly openly expressed great frustration about his financial situation. They say he quit university just a few months before he would have obtained his degree, and took on a full-time job—initially not without his parents' disapproval. But still his parents were eventually supportive, as I've been told, since it was so evident to everybody that he was much more content with his improved financial situation. He used to talk about how his life was so much easier having more money at his disposal and not having to worry all the time; and how he was so well liked by his new boss and coworkers. We all assumed that everything was going well for him...

In summary:

At the age of 25, he had basically turned his life around, was now single, had quit his studies (still unfortunately for some, because he was smart), worked full-time in a new field of work that he enjoyed and was good in, and seemed more approachable and happy in general.

This lasted for two years, and then he vanished without a trace at age 27...

Considering his past habits and behaviour, the discovery of Jake's disappearance was obviously made a significant time after the day he was estimated to have actually vanished. His boss, who had been trying to call, text and email him, was the first one to grow suspicious when Jake hadn't showed up for work three days without notice after his planned two weeks off.

His boss eventually had HR look into Jake's personnel file. They found his dad's telephone number as an emergency contact, informed his dad of Jake's unusual absence – dad and mom had no explanation – so then they immediately called police to check his flat.

They got the building's caretaker, who opened the door to the flat, and... it was empty. Squeaky clean, and empty. All the furniture was there: a made bed, table with chairs, TV stand, armchair, wardrobe, a large standing mirror. The reason I'm saying empty is because they said there was no cutlery in the kitchen drawers, neither glasses, plates, nor mugs in the kitchen cupboards, neither clothes nor shoes in the wardrobe, neither papers nor books in any shelves, no television on the TV stand. No towels or hygiene products in the bathroom, no personal items anywhere. There was nothing. Not a hint of dust. It was as if someone had moved in, just put in basic furniture, and made the bed. They said the sheets, pillow and blanket smelled freshly washed.

The flat had a balcony. The glass door and windows to the balcony appeared clean. But his mom said the caretaker/police noticed a black plastic chair on the balcony, with a little black metal framed  table with a black wooden top next to it. And on that little table were an empty, seemingly unused wine glass and a clean ashtray with an untouched pack of Marlboro cigarettes positioned beside it. That wasn't anything that struck us as unusual as he was known to be a smoker. The only thing that one might consider a little bit odd is that, allegedly, he didn't use to smoke Marlboros, as far as we knew. But who knows. People change habits. 

Still they said it all was sort of an eerie sight, but no sign of a crime whatsoever. After all, Jake was an adult with no criminal record, and there existed no law prohibiting anybody from just "walking away", which police basically assumed he had. That happens, yes, even though it happens rarely. 

Jake's mom said she had been having repeated foreboding dreams about her son being in some way hurt or violated by another man, and insisted that the police dig further. However legally, the police's hands were tied as there was nothing suggesting a crime had taken place and nothing warranting neither an official search nor further investigation. The only thing they were able to do is register him as a missing person.

Jake's dad knew an old friend with whom he went to high-school, and who had become a police officer. So, he reached out to him and pleaded he look into his son's disappearance. Let's call this police officer Paul. Paul was obviously reluctant, because he knew very well that stretching his legal leeway that way may well mean putting his badge on the line. But Jake's dad didn't give in. Paul ultimately promised to "see what he can do".

He somehow managed to get a glimpse of some of Jake's bank statements. They revealed nothing too unusual. But apparently, Jake had been withdrawing just a few hundred dollars of cash every other month over that two-year period before his vanishing. 350 dollars in January, 250 dollars in February, nothing in March, 400 dollars in April, 250 in May, and so on.
Also, it appeared that he had been granted a credit of 10,000 dollars from a different bank two years prior, which he was paying off in monthly installments punctually up to about the point he disappeared. His bank statements showed that he mostly used that money for new furniture, new household items, dental work and other medical expenses. It was nothing that would be able to ruin him financially at all. Given his full-time work paycheck, he seemed to be able to pay off that loan rather comfortably.

Apart from the above, however, the statements revealed a name that neither I nor his immediate family nor his ex-boyfriend had heard of before. That name was Simon.
Simon was a homeless man and an alcoholic, resided illegally in the country at the time of the discovery of Jake's disappearance and was sheltered by a woman called Lisa, who considered herself his girlfriend and who wasn't exactly well-off either. She was unemployed due to mental illness and alcoholism, and was living on welfare. Apparently, she seldom used to leave her flat and was hence in part dependent on Simon's help.

Officer Paul found Lisa's apartment as well as homeless guy Simon in it. Both claimed to be good friends of Jake, and seemed distraught at the learning of his disappearance. They both declared to have been concerned about him not answering any texts or phone calls. 

By that time, we all were sure that Simon and Lisa had concocted a plan to rob Jake and make him disappear one way or another. Except... they cooperated fully, even though Simon must have at this point be well aware that he would likely be deported now that he was found living illegally in the country again. Both Lisa and Simon readily provided Paul with all the digital exchanges they had with Jake (text messages, WhatsApp messages, call records etc.). They complied with everything.

Upon looking into Simon's file, Paul discovered that he had initially entered the country legally, but then, over the course of many months, amassed fines totalling a few thousand dollars for petty things such as missing rear lights on his bike, riding his bike the wrong direction in a one-way street or while intoxicated. Given his circumstances, he wasn't able to pay these fines. And instead of having him serve an alternative jail sentence (which would have been possible by law), they had decided to deport him... twice. So Simon, in turn, decided to re-enter the country illegally... twice. Simon explained that he just had to come back because on the one hand, he liked the country and its people, and on the other hand, he felt obliged to support the woman he loved. He said he felt safe here, and considered Jake a loyal friend and vice versa. According to him, he had first met Jake one weekend in a bar, around the time Jake started his full-time job. They supposedly had a good time drinking and talking, eventually exchanged numbers and gradually became friends. Jake was aware of Simon's difficult situation (btw. he was here legally at the time they met), and tried to help him out within his means by giving him money or food, or letting him sleep and shower at his place, and lending him fresh clothes. He even arranged free medical help for him in some instances, which was backed up by medical reports Simon provided Officer Paul with.

In the end, everybody in the family basically ruled Simon and Lisa out as suspects. And since Paul found himself legally in a grey area and knew people would ask questions regarding his investigations, he chose not to report Simon to have him deported a third time. As far as I know, he is still in the country with his girlfriend, who, by the way, he had met under similar circumstances as Jake. 

There's one thing, however, which makes me raise my eyebrows. Simon more or less refused to give the exact reason why he had left his home country in the first place. His answers seemed to have been rather vague in that regard, which leaves me with a shadow of doubt.

Jake's parents also talked to his ex-boyfriend at length. He confirmed that Jake had been struggling with his mental health throughout their relationship, emphasising his sleeping problems and financial situation, which would play an essential role in their breakup. Having said this, he admitted that a considerable time before their breakup, Jake's mental health had seemed to improve and stabilise. He figured that as a result of that stabilisation, Jake might have felt inclined to reevaluate his life, including their relationship, and go ahead to change it, or end it.

My cousin Jake has been missing for a handful of years now. Me as well as his parents, brothers and relatives have been envisioning different fates which may have befallen him. Most of us hope he has left of his own accord. And others are afraid he met a violent end, and just hope his demise came quickly. The only thing I can do is wonder. I believe he simply left and started a new life somewhere else, but who knows.
