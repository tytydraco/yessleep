The day after my high school graduation, my dad told me that I either find a summer job or get out of his house. I don’t know what I was expecting from him, since he hasn't done much as far as parenting. I was walking through the town when I came across a flyer about the job. It’s great pay, considering the conditions; I have to stay cooped up in a watch tower for the summer and look out for fires in a national park. There wasn’t much description about the job besides that I’d have a buddy to room with so I wouldn't go insane on my own.

“Hey, Roxie, you sure you don’t wanna help me with these crosswords?” My ‘roomie’, Ben, asked as he kicked his feet on the desk, humming a tune as he wrote in the book full of puzzles.

“I’m sure,” I say, looking out the window in case of any fires.

Ben groaned and looked at me. “You’re no fun. I’m going for a walk.”

He picked up a bag and slammed the frail wooden door. It'd only been a week since the job started, and I was already frustrated, strictly because of him. It didn’t help that Ben was over 30 years older than me and constantly flirted with me. *Just two and a half months left... pull through, Roxanne...* I thought to myself as I clocked out for the day and fell asleep on one of the beds in the tower.

My slumber was interrupted when Ben ran inside and slammed the door, frantically packing his bags. "What the fuck, Ben? What's wrong?"

"There's something out there, I swear on my life there was something out there!" Ben cries as he shoves most of his belongings into a plastic bag.

"You can't just leave! You're supposed to be my partner for the summer! It's only been a week!" I grab one of his arms to try to stop him. "Just calm down, tell me what you saw."

Seeing Ben, a fully grown man, panicking like that freaked me out. Out of fear, I, too, began packing up a bit. "I only saw a silhouette, but the noises out there told me everything I needed to know. Whatever was out there wasn't human!"

My eyes squint a bit. "Could it have been a bear or any other animal?"

Ben immediately shakes his head and stands up with his bag. "Hell no, animals don't talk or shapeshift!"

"Shapeshift? What the hell are you talking about?!"

He pulls the door open. "If you were smart, you'd join me. I'm not gonna sit here and die!" He slammed the door again and scampered down the stairs.

I watched his figure out of the window. He was full-on sprinting away from the tower until I could no longer see him. Now that I was alone, I couldn't shake the feeling of uncertainty from what he'd said. *Shapeshift...?*

That night, I lay awake, too freaked out to sleep. How could I? My roomie for the summer just suddenly left, claiming that there was a 'shapeshifter' in the park. I listened for any unordinary sounds, honestly hoping that Ben was on something, and just imagined what he said he saw.

Now, it's a week later since he's left, and Ben has gone missing, along with two frequent hikers. It seems that the three of them had never left the park, which is all the more unsettling. I talked to the police earlier and told them everything Ben told me, but they brushed me aside, saying that I was 'too old' to make up imaginary stories about a creature residing somewhere in the park.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't afraid to do anything but stay in the tower. Since that night, I haven't moved, and I've just been doing the crossword puzzles that Ben had left behind. I think he would've wanted me to finish them. The police still haven't found them, but the ranger gave me an assignment to try and see if I can find any leads on the recent disappearances, and I can't help but feel like if I go out there, I'll probably be the next person to go missing.

So, here I am, packing a bag for my upcoming 'adventure', completely terrified out of my mind. Despite being a beginner, I'll try my best to figure out what's going on in the park. I owe it to the three of them to crack this case, and (hopefully) find them. I don't know if I'll survive this, so please, everyone, pray for me. *Lord, protect me...*
