At first, I thought I was being haunted. I inherited the house from my late father, who passed away when I was 25. He was always a jokester growing up. Sometimes he’d stand behind a doorway with only his head peeking out, then he’d grab his hair as if someone was trying to drag him away. My sister and I would erupt in harmonious laughter before yelling “Daddy, stop!” knowing it was only a farce. Every time we saw a “stop ahead” sign while driving, he’d place a large palm on the top of my mother’s head and turn to us in the backseat, asking “Did I do it?” 
The thing is, my father died two years ago, so why is all this happening now? 

It started about five months ago. I noticed the cabinets in the kitchen being left open. I figured my sister was being absent minded, not closing them when she was finished retrieving whatever it was she needed. One evening, after getting home from work late, I noticed the cabinet under the sink was wide open. I crouched down to shut it, and it opened again on its own. My mind instantly blamed the supernatural. This was my father, and this was his way of reaching out. 

I became obsessed with this idea for the next couple months. I looked up morse code online and wrote down all the translations on a piece of paper. Then I’d sit by the cabinets late at night. For a few weeks, nothing spectacular happened. I would open all the cabinet doors, and they would stay open. I started to think I had been imagining the whole thing. Then, one night, after hours of sitting on cold tile, all the cabinets shut on their own, all at once. For the next few minutes, nothing. Another few minutes, they opened and shut again. After another hour of this, the cabinet doors opening and shutting in different and repeating patterns and me scribbling furiously on a piece of paper in front of me, I came up with absolutely nothing. The patterns only translated to a jumble of random letters and numbers, nothing that made sense even if they were rearranged. 

I finally brought the cabinets up to my sister the following day, asking her if she’d noticed anything peculiar. 

“Huh? No, I just thought you were leaving them open on accident.” 

“Okay, but, have you ever seen them open on their own?” 

She laughed at me, a hysterical laugh that called me crazy in the absence of words. 

The cabinets eventually stopped having a mind of their own, which made everything worse. I almost became convinced that I had somehow gone into psychosis due to some mental illness I didn’t even know I had. 

Then things got worse.
 
I started losing my socks. Now, I know what you’re thinking, this is a common experience. Again, I, too, thought nothing of it at first. My socks could have easily been getting mixed in with my sister's laundry, meaning in reality, they were just in her dresser instead of mine. 

Then larger items of clothing started going missing, shirts, pants, jackets, anything. Around the same time, I noticed plumbing issues in the house. Water stopped draining as easily, a gurgling noise often emitting from the pipes. I called a plumber when the toilet eventually stopped flushing all together. I was told there was most likely a septic issue. It's a common thing with old houses out in the country, and it just needed to be pumped. What they found, though, was not a buildup of waste, it was my clothes. At least a dozen articles of clothing were found clogging the septic. The plumbing company was just as baffled as I was. The only way this could have happened was if someone was flushing the clothes down the toilet, which only made sense for the socks and underwear. 

Things were normal for about a week after the septic problem. I could take long showers and flush the toilet again. 
On New Years Eve, I came home from a small get-together at around three in the morning. Upon arriving at my doorstep, the front door swung open by itself. I stopped dead in my tracks, looking into the house but not entering. The floors and walls seemed to be… moving. The surfaces pulsed in and out, up and down, almost as if breathing. 

I didn’t have a single drink that night. 

After, I noticed this “breathing” almost constantly. The walls would stretch outward, warping any decorations momentarily until exhaling. I could feel the floorboards expanding upwards below me. My sister acted like everything was fine, so I didn’t bring it up to her in fear of being sent to the psych ward. But I felt it all the time, and sometimes, at night, I swear I could hear soft breaths. It didn’t come from any discernible direction. It was coming from everywhere. 

Two weeks ago, the smell started. I thought an animal had crawled under the house and died. All I needed to do was wait it out. Then I noticed the floorboards in the living room oozing. It was a greenish brown liquid filling up all the cracks. I immediately headed to the garage, grabbing a crowbar. I tore up a single board, immediately gagging as the smell became a thousand times more intense. There was a pool of what looked like vomit. I removed another board, and under that one, whole bones with meat still left on them sat in the liquid. 
My sister arrived home in the midst of this. 

“What are you doing?” she asked. 

“Do you not see this?” 

“What are you talking about?” 

Before I could answer, the entire house started shaking and gurgling. The floor beneath my sister started to cave in, wood splintering and puncturing her skin like teeth. She didn’t scream. I don’t think she had time to. After only a few seconds, the ordeal was over. The floor warped back to normal, and everything was silent. 

My house ate my sister, and I’m worried I’m next.
