“It happened to me last month,” Ryan shares as we sit in his car, parked outside my house.  
  
“I was at the store, just picking up a couple of things, when I heard this loud banging sound. Initially, I thought it was the crew in the back unloading. But then… I started seeing things,” he confesses, and his voice trails off.  
  
“How did you know to get outside in time?” I inquire.  
  
“I didn’t. I ran outside to clear my head. Got lucky, I guess.”  
  
Ryan tells me how his life is different now. How he’s gotten used to living with this thing. “Have you actually gotten used to this?” I question as we ascend the stairs to my house. He stops and looks at me. In that moment I see him fighting back tears. I know he’s still scared.  
  
I nervously swing open the front door which causes the oxygen mask to rattle against the tank. It scares Ryan but I tell him it’s okay. Nothing like bringing your date back home to a hospice-filled living room.   
  
“So, why us?” I probe as I set up some tea on the couch. He looks at me, timid. Like he might actually know.  
  
“Survivor’s guilt,” he confesses.  
  
“You sound like my therapist,” I remark, which is accurate. They all diagnosed me with it. The guilt I had for surviving the car crash. The constant psychosis of why *her* and not *me*. The intense feelings of unworthiness and self-blame. I tell Ryan it can take years to recover.  
  
“I know,” he acknowledges.  
  
Then, he recounts the incident at Wisconsin during his sophomore year. It was the second game of the season, the final play before halftime. The opposing running back cut back, providing an open space for Ryan to tackle him. Unaware that the running back was doing the same, their helmets collided, and the running back dropped to the ground.  
  
As he shares this, it triggers a memory of seeing this story in the news years ago. The outlets reported on the player who died but never on the one who survived with a lifetime of guilt.  
  
Ryan reveals that it ended up being the final play of his career. He couldn’t recover mentally. “For me, it’s not a knocking sound that I hear,” he confides, fighting back tears. “It’s a banging sound. Like… the sound of two helmets colliding.”  
  
I take Ryan’s hand and ask, “You really think it’s targeting people like us?”  
  
“I know it is. That woman on the bus that died… I looked it up. Holocaust survivor.”  
  
My mind races as I process all this. “Okay, so we know why. Now how do we end this?”  
  
“I don’t know.”  
  
He then gazes at me with a hopeful glance.  
  
“But there’s two of us now.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Ryan spends the night. We never end up finishing what we started at his place. Instead, we spend the entire time trading stories, researching, and trying to find a game plan to beat this thing. It feels nice to have a partner.  
  
We discuss all the weird things we’ve noticed in town. He mentions the guy who was found passed out naked in his front yard. I look him up and see he was the only survivor of a plane crash back in the 70s. Apparently, he’s now on life support. I tell Ryan that I’m going to visit him tomorrow and see if I can find out more.  
  
We continue to chat, fighting back the tiredness, not because we were scared of falling asleep but because we couldn’t stop talking about our past. Good and bad. Eventually we pass out, holding on to each other.  
  
I jolt awake. Middle of the night. My heart is pounding. Ryan looks over and asks if I heard the knocking. I shake my head and fall back asleep. I inch closer to him, seeking solace in his warmth.  
  
The next morning, I wake up with a renewed sense of purpose. Before heading to the hospital, I decide it’s time—time to finally visit Alexis.  
  
Instead of hopping the stadium fence, I go around to the front. My Achilles still aches, so I leave my running shoes behind. Today, I need a break.  
  
With trepidation, I make my way towards the main entrance of the stadium. I pass the concession stand, the bathrooms and then finally make my way towards a large monument.  
  
*“In loving memory of Alexis Carlson, a cherished soul who left an unforgettable mark on our community. Gone too soon, but never forgotten, may she find eternal peace, and may our memories of Alexis be a source of comfort and inspiration to us all."*  
  
I look up and see the statue of her. A smile radiates off her. Just how I remember.  
  
They unveiled the statue on the one-year anniversary of her passing. I bailed at the last second. I told myself I’d go the following year. 16 years later and I’m finally here. I guess I’ve been a bad friend.  
  
My eyes begin to tear as I stare at her. There she is, perfectly encompassing everything I loved about her. A free spirit, full of love and happiness. There’s a youthfulness in her. I pull out the lighter from my front pocket and hold it in my hand. Still resisting the urge to light it.  
  
I don’t have to tell her sorry. She can see it in my face. That’s the beauty of a good friendship. All the words left unsaid are somehow as clear as day. For the first time in my life, I truly feel like it didn’t have to be me. I look up at Alexis and tell her that. “It didn’t have to be me,” I repeatedly say.  It was terrible and random but it didn’t have to be me. And that’s so unfair.  
  
I can grieve and feel guilt but I shouldn’t have to struggle to find purpose in a life that feels stolen. “I’ve spent years haunted by this,” I admit out loud, drying my eyes. “Replaying the night endlessly, tormenting myself with thoughts of what could have been different. I survived, and you didn’t. It’s bullshit. And I wish more than anything I can change that.”  
  
I exhale and look up at her one more time. In that moment, I realize I, too, lost a part of myself that night. I don’t say that out loud though. In case she’s listening.  
  
Guilt doesn’t need to keep changing hands.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I head to the hospital with newfound determination. If I can find enough of us tortured souls out there then maybe I can gather enough information to finally put an end to this curse.  
  
I enter the room of Naked Passed Out Guy, aka Jacob Kurland. I walk in without even knocking. You’d think I’d know proper hospital etiquette by now. It's only when I sit down that I realize the severity of his condition. A web of tubes connects him to various machines. I gaze at him, half-expecting answers from a comatose man.  
  
Feeling like I've wasted my time, I stand up and collect my things. As my hand reaches for the doorknob, a faint whisper cuts through the room…  
  
“You need to trap it.”  
  
My head swivels back toward Jacob. His eyes lock onto mine. Fear courses through me, and my body crashes into the door. He inhales deeply from his ventilator, removing the mask—  
  
“It’s the only way to rid yourself of it.”  
  
He speaks louder now. The lights above start to flicker. He inhales another breath, removes the mask again—  
  
“No running. No hiding.”  
  
Another inhale.  
  
“KNOCK BACK!!”  
  
Another inhale.  
  
**“YOU NEED TO KNOCK BACK!”**  
  
He screams. I hear the nurses rushing towards us.  
  
“You better go. It’s coming.”  
  
*Tap tap.*  
  
Fuck. I rush out of the room, scanning the hallway for an exit.  
  
*TAP TAP.*  
  
I feel the hallway walls closing in on me. I have nowhere to move.  
  
*TAP TAP… TAP TAP…*  
  
I frantically look for an exit. *KRSH!!* The glass windows shatter in unison. I sprint down another corridor just as… *SMASH!* A fallen tree knocks through a wall.  
  
*KNOCK… KNOCK…*  
  
I try to steady my breathing. Focus. The walls expand, everything starts to look normal. I see an exit sign to my left. I race towards it, dodging a group of nurses. I slam open the side exit, and the cold air hits my face as I catch my breath. Jacob's words echo in my mind: “Knock back.”  
  
I ball up my fist, creating a knocking sound on the railing next to me. “Knock back.”  
  
Continuing to think, my eyes widen.  
  
I recall the moment in the office building when it tried to haunt me and I kept making a noise back. The metal chair against the window. That’s it!! Every time I flung the chair, the figure started to reveal itself more.  
  
I take out my phone and call Ryan. Before he can even greet me, I shout—  
  
“It’s time to knock back.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
It looks like a tornado tore through my living room. Scattered across the floor are an odd assortment of objects—pots, pans, a metal trash can, five different types of blenders, cymbals, power tools, and even smoke alarms. Ryan and I have gathered anything capable of producing a loud noise. Combined with the hospice equipment, my house now resembles a hoarder's paradise.  
  
Resting on the coffee table is the final piece of our makeshift arsenal—a handgun Ryan borrowed from a friend.  
  
The game plan is set: I'll create a loud noise, enticing the demon to reveal itself, while Ryan takes the shot. Until then, it’s a waiting game.  
  
We sit in tense silence, surrounded by chaos. Hours drag on, fatigue and restlessness settling in. The knocking lacks any predictable rhythm.  
  
What if it knows our plan? Maybe that’s why it hasn’t shown up?  
  
The waiting continues, well past midnight. Our eyes grow heavy, fatigue settling in.  
  
My eyes start to drift asleep. I rest my head against the wall…  
  
*Tap tap.*  
  
I jolt forward. Ryan looks at me, “You hear that?”  
  
I nod. We synchronize our watches; It’s go time…  
  
I rapidly press start on all five blenders… *WHIRRRRRRRRR.*  
  
*TAP TAP.*  
  
I turn on a power drill… *BRRRRRRRRRRR.*  
  
*TAP TAP… TAP TAP…*  
  
Ryan holds the gun, looking for the figure. Neither of us see it yet.  
  
I reach for the cymbals and bang them together…. *CRASH! CRASH!!!*  
  
“WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU??!!” Ryan shouts as he holds the gun.  
  
*KNOCK… KNOCK…*  
  
I grab the pots and pans… *CLANG!!CLANG!!CLANG!!CLANG!!*  
  
I look around, but I don’t see it either. I check the time. 15 seconds have lapsed.  
  
*KNOCK… KNOCK… KNOCK… KNOCK… KNOCK… KNOCK…*  
  
I trigger the smoke detector… *BEEP!BEEP!BEEP!*  
  
Shadows start to dance around the living room. Ryan follows it with his gun. The figure briefly shows itself. Ryan can’t lock onto it though. “KEEP GOING!!” he urges me.  
  
I press the smoke detector button again… *BEEP!BEEP!BEEP!*  
  
**35 seconds left.** The lights flicker. The room starts to turn upside down. I reach for the smoke detector but can’t find it. I can’t grab anything.  
  
“KEEP GOING, DELANEY! C’MON!!” Ryan shouts, his gun tracking every shadow. He rubs his eyes, unsure of what's real.  
  
*KRSH!!!* Glass windows shatter. I’m completely disoriented.  
  
*KNOCK… KNOCK... KNOCK… KNOCK…*  
  
**25 seconds left.** I try to steady myself. Focus. Try to see straight. You got this, Delaney. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.  
  
I finally see the smoke detector. I press the button… *BEEP!BEEP!BEEP!*  
  
Ryan screams in pain, collapsing to the ground, succumbing to hallucinations.  
  
“GET UP, RYAN! YOU CAN DO THIS!” I scream, trying to reach him. **20 seconds left.**  
  
*BEEP!BEEP!BEEP!*  
  
The figure reveals itself.  
  
*BEEP!BEEP!BEEP!*  
  
I see Ryan lock eyes with it. I yell at him to shoot. He has the gun focused on the figure but…  
  
He gradually brings the gun towards *himself*. “WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!”  
  
“I CAN’T CONTROL IT!” Ryan exclaims as he presses the gun against his chest. I see him trying to stop himself from pulling the trigger but…  
  
*BANG!*  
  
Too late. He collapses. The gunshot causes the figure to reveal itself more vividly. Now, its pulsating eyes, tattered face, and hellish hue are clear. It doesn’t scare me though.  
  
I rush to grab the gun, firing off rounds. *BANG! BANG! BANG!* I miss every shot, accidentally hitting the oxygen tank. A hissing sound emerges as oxygen escapes.  
  
**15 seconds left** and I’m out of bullets. I scramble to find something else but I trip on a cord and land awkwardly—  
  
*SNAP!* I feel my Achilles give again. I tumble to the ground.  
  
*KNOCK… KNOCK... KNOCK… KNOCK…*  
  
The figure taunts me with a sinister grin.  
  
**10 seconds left.**  
  
I crawl towards it. Cursing at it.  
  
**9 seconds.**  
  
I won't make it outside in time.  
  
**8 seconds.**  
  
I have one last attempt to defeat this thing.  
  
**7 seconds.**  
  
The oxygen tank is in front of me.  
  
**6 seconds.**  
  
I reach into my pocket and pull out the lighter.  
  
**5 seconds.**  
  
I flick it on.  
  
**4 seconds.**  
  
My hand rises towards the oxygen tank.  
  
**3 seconds.**  
  
The flame ignites the leaking oxygen…  
  
**2 seconds.**  
  
*BOOSH!!* Flames spray towards the demon.   
  
**1 second.**  
  
The demon is engulfed in flames and crashes through the sliding glass door.   
  
I don't watch as the timer reaches 60 seconds. The realization that I'm still breathing, still alive, doesn't register. All I care about is reaching Ryan.  
  
I hobble towards him, yelling for him to stay with me. Fighting through the throbbing pain, I need to get to him in time... STAY WITH ME. STAY WITH ME!!!  
  
Finally, I reach him and grab his hand. I feel his heart beating. A small sense of relief washes over me. I hold him tight, assuring him everything will be okay.  
  
He slowly looks at me and nods. Placing his hand on the lighter, he opens his mouth, attempting to tell me something. I lean in as he whispers…  
  
“Picked a helluva time to finally use it.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I see Alexis every day now.  
  
It’s been ten months since I stopped hopping the fence. I no longer come to the track for workouts, especially since I'm still recuperating from my second Achilles surgery. Now, I'm here to witness others lay their guts out on this turf.  
  
Ryan was right; coaching suits me. I watch as he coaches the varsity team on the other side of the track. Again, you can spot a visor a mile away.  
  
He’s made a full recovery. Physically at least. I’m not sure either of us are there yet mentally. Maybe we won’t ever be. But we’re in a much better place today than we were at the beginning of the year.  
  
We’re still taking things slow. Letting things play out naturally. But we do spend a lot of time together. In fact, we started a ritual of making homemade pasta the night before every track meet. Even though we’re not the ones running anymore.  
  
I guess it’s just a nostalgia thing.  
  
I say all of this as I put the final touches on my homemade spaghetti carbonara. I’m just waiting for Ryan to come back from the grocery store. He should be here any minute.  
  
I start cleaning the pots and pans when I hear a light knocking at the door. My heart still races at that noise. He has a key now but I’m sure his arms are full.   
  
I dry my hands and walk towards the front door.  “You could have rang the doorbell, you know?” I call out as I swing the door open.  
  
I pause.  
  
He’s not there. No one is.  
  
I look around. It’s dead quiet.  
  
As I take a step outside to investigate, I realize…  
  
I’m not alone.
