"Welcome aboard, Terrence, me lad!" The Captain's voice thundered out, drawing a dark look from the woman sitting in the booth behind him. His outburst had shattered the quiet atmosphere of Linda's Roadside Diner, and when she dropped her coffee cup it had shattered in much the same way. As she fussed over her scrambled eggs, I poked at my own and thought adding some coffee might be an improvement. 


I had spent my last two dollars on the plate of runny eggs. They tasted faintly of salmon, and I quietly cursed the cook for making my eggs in the same pan as the Captain's fish. He had noticed me from across the diner and come to sit in my booth. He said he saw hunger in me, and laughed heartily when I dryly pointed out where we were. 


"You'll fit right in, me boy." The Captain's smile carried a sense of implicit brotherhood. 


He had been right, of course. I was hungry, and I was very broke. When I left home to travel the world as a vagabond, I had underestimated the amount of desperation I would face. I remember worrying that I had come across as overeager when I accepted the job offer. I would be joining his crew for a three day commercial fishing voyage, with halibut as our quarry. 


I finished my meal without saying another word as the Captain gushed about his boat, his crew, and the open ocean. 


We drove together for three hours to a dock somewhere in the northern half of Massachusetts. There were many times I found myself fearing that the Captain's ancient Pontiac might break down and leave us stranded somewhere along I-95. I was so thankful to have arrived without incident that I had completely forgotten there were others who would be joining us. Hauling my heavy luggage, I let my eyes wander over the area. The sand here looked dull, as if the color had been muted somehow from the usual beige sands into a depressing, greyish facsimile of the color sand is meant to be. The dock, well, ramshackle would have been too kind a word. The small staircase sat askew, with handrails held together by nails plainly visible in the overcast gloom of the afternoon. The rails had been pulled away from their posts by gravity as the rest of the dock drifted out to sea. 


As we made our way up the ragged stairs, I found myself thinking that the Captain looked every bit as creaky and dilapidated as the dock. His gait was dramatically marred by a limp of the left leg, as if it were slightly shorter than his right. His right arm swung freely as he moved, while the left dangled stiffly at his side. I wondered if the Captain, like the dock, had been stretched and distorted by the force which, like the shifting tides, pulled him out to the sea. 


"Ain't she a beauty, me lad?" The Captain breathed out the question with awe and admiration laced into his voice. 


The ship was in much better shape than the dock. It was right around 40 feet long, with clean sleek siding. The absence of any marring of the hull told me that either the Captain was incredibly vigilant in the removal of barnacles, or the barnacles had never chosen to attach themselves to the ship to begin with. The cabin was relatively spacious, painted stark white contrasting beautifully against the oceanâ€™s surface and the grey clouds above. Cursive letters, painted in red, told me the name of the ship. "The Minnow." 


"I'll say." I muttered half-heartedly. It was a beautiful ship, but I was not a man with an eye for such things. "Your boat is certainly much nicer than your car." 


The sound of the Captain's laughter told me my risky remark had been worth it. He left me to settle in, claiming that he had to make sure everything was ready to go. I was putting my bags away in what meager storage the ship could afford me when I heard something that made me jump. 


It was a voice, low, and slow. Deeper and more cracked than any human voice I've heard before or since. It rasped out to me from the darkest corner of the room. 


"Hi! Oh, sorry. Frog in my throat! Haha." He cleared his throat and spoke again. This time, his voice was perfectly ordinary. "I'm Jared. Nice to meet you." 


Jared got up and stepped into the negligible light which seeped down into the crew's quarters. He was Asian, possibly Chinese, with jeans that looked too big for him, and a jacket to match. 


"Nice to meet you too, I'm Terrence. Terrence Howard. Not that one, though, obviously." I kicked myself for unnecessarily clarifying that I am not Hollywood star Terrence Howard. If I was going to be spending a week at sea with these guys, I couldn't afford to make myself out to be a weirdo. 


"Pleased to make your acquaintance, Terrence Howard. I loved you in Iron Man. So, where did the Captain find you? He picked me up from outside a Home Depot." I don't know if people know this about being homeless, but you don't get too many folks interested in your life story. I seized on the opportunity with more gusto than I probably should have, and by the end of the night, Jared and I were on track to becoming fast friends. 


Besides Jared and I, there were three others on the vessel, not including the Captain. There was John Laramie, an elderly man with a peg leg and the face of a bulldog, who would be serving as the Captain's first mate. Then there were Jimmy and Timmy Brakovich, Russian twins who had fled their homeland to evade service in the war against Ukraine. These two would be working with Jared and I as deckhands. We had all made our introductions, and we were tickled to find that every one of us had been vagrants before crossing paths with Captain Yorke. I joined several others in ribbing the Captain about his crew of runaways and vagabonds, and as we laughed I caught sight of the last member of the crew. 


He had stood in abject silence, never uttering a word. Instead of joining in any conversations he simply flicked his shallow, verdant eyes from person to person, as if observing us. Hoping to garner as much information about others while sharing none about himself. I made my way over to break the ice. 


"Hello, I'm Terrance Howard." His only response to this was to raise his eyebrows, so I pushed on. "Where are you from?" 


He didn't reply, he simply kept his eyes locked on mine and gave an insincere smile. Something in the way he was looking at me, saying nothing, made my skin crawl. The longer we stood together in silence, the more frightened of him I became. We were adrift in the endless expanse of the Earth's oceans, surrounded on all sides by the darkness of the early morning, and yet the most terrifying part of it all was this man. This implacable statue, standing tall and silently staring accusation into my soul. 

"Ah, that's Jeff! He's a friendly enough fella, but completely incapable of speech, I fear. He's what they call a mute." The Captain had appeared, as if out of thin air, directly behind me. 


The tension I had felt melted away. I kicked myself for leaping to thoughts of paranormal stowaways before considering a simple disability. I reached out to shake Jeff's hand, and was pleased when he reciprocated the gesture. His hand was rough like sandpaper against my own, and wonderfully warm against the brisk morning winds. 


The Captain excused himself from my company and made his way forward to address the crew. 


"Alright, lads. We've got a long week of hard fishing ahead." The Captain droned out, with the last word of the sentence trailing off. "We set out nets at first light, go get some grub and be ready when the time comes." There was elation in the Captain's voice. I could tell that he lived for these voyages. 


Jared and I sat together at breakfast, without much of anything to talk about. We had been discussing the most recent season of "The Masked Singer" when the Captain flung open the door and called us all to our tasks. 


The day's work passed by in such a blur that I could hardly believe it when I first saw the moon. There was something therapeutic in the mindless labor. We had been laughing and joking amongst ourselves so much that the work had stopped feeling like work at all. That mood, unfortunately, wouldn't last. 


The Captain stood before us in the dining area that night, noticeably shorter than when we had departed. I had a hard time putting my finger on what was giving me the impression that the Captain was profoundly sorrowful, but I figured it out about halfway through his speech. Something in his face had shifted, giving way for his eyeballs to become ever so slightly larger than they had been. 


"Is the Captain sick or something? He looked kinda off today." I mused to Jared as we lay down for the night. 


"Dunno, I didn't notice anything. Why?" He replied. 


"I'm not sure. It's probably nothing." I said, deciding to drop the subject. I told myself I couldn't lie awake all night thinking about things I had probably just imagined. 


The next morning, I found myself working closely with the first mate, Mr. Laramie. We had been assigned to the gutting and freezing of the previous day's catch. 


"So Mr. Laramie," I picked up a halibut with a particularly sad look in its dead eyes and sliced it from tip to tail, "Where are you from?" 


"S'best not to talk, boy. Ye'll get the guts in yer mouth." He spat the sentence out at me, and I took the cue to shut up. 


We worked together in silence, processing the hundred or so fish which felt like thousands at the time. 


"Okay, but you can at least tell me where you're fr-" my sentence died in my throat. A particularly full stomach had fallen from the halibut Mr. Laramie had just gutted, landing with a crash and sending a ribbon of fish intestine soaring into my mouth. The scrap of viscera landed on my tongue, leaving behind an oily, bitter film. Mr. Laramie laughed hysterically as I retched over a barrel. 



After ten minutes of scraping my tongue and gargling seawater, I was ready to return to work. 


"Y'alright now, boy?" Mr. Laramie had softened significantly after laughing at my misfortune. 


"Yeah, I'm fine. Pass me that stomach I want to see what the hell this thing ate." He handed me the stomach, and I sliced it open. I had expected a workboot and another round of laughs. I had not expected a small, humanoid being with large, bulbous eyes which hung suspended from stalks protruding from where the eye socket would typically be found on a human. 


"Go fetch the cap'n." Mr. Laramie whispered, with his face stark white in the fluorescent light of the ship's processing station. 


The Captain followed me back to the station while I tried, and failed, to explain what we'd found. When he entered the cramped room full of death and viscera, his eyes instantly locked on the tiny corpse. 


"WHAT IN THE BLUE BLAZES HAVE YE DONE? I OUGHT TO THROW THE BOTH OF YE OUT INTO THE BLOODY SEA AND LET HER HAVE HER WAY WITH YE." The Captain had flown into a rage, with tears in his eyes and a face as red as an apple's ass. 


"Now hol' on Cap'n, it weren't the boy's fault we were ju-" I appreciated Mr. Laramie defending me, but Captain Yorke clearly did not. He cut Laramie off mid-sentence. 


"So yer saying it was you then, are ye Mr. Laramie? Ye and ye alone killed that poor child? Twas ye who may doom us all then, aye, Mr. Laramie?" His accent shifted in strange ways as the anger waxed and waned. 


"No! No Captain, it were the fish what did it. The boy and I found the poor thing dead in the belly of a halibut." Mr. Laramie seemed like he might cry. I hoped he wouldn't, as I've never been able to handle the sight of an old man crying. 


The Captain's rage had died immediately once he understood what had happened. He solemnly crossed the room, and discard the body into the sea. 


"Neither of ye are to speak of this." The Captain muttered, turning on his heel to storm out of the room. 


"What the fuck was that?" I asked Mr. Laramie, who was clearly just as perplexed. He just stared back at me, stunned, with his jaw hanging open. 


When Jared asked me how working with the first mate had been,  I thought about telling him the truth. In the end, I decided to obey the Captain and keep it to myself. 


"It was...fine." I said. Better to lie by omission. 


"Well you really missed out today. You know those Russian fellas? Well, they were doing this bit where they got on either end of a fish and pretended they were fu-" Listening to the stories of the day's hijinks brought me peace enough that I fell asleep while he spoke. 


I was the first to wake the next morning, and I made my way onto the deck to enjoy the sea breeze air. I decided to walk laps around the deck, and it wasn't until the third or fourth lap that my foot brushed against him. Mr. Laramie was lying flat on the deck, barely concealed between two fishing nets. I pulled the nets away, and revealed his pale, bloated face. His wrinkled skin had allowed the bloating to reach an unimaginable degree. A thin trail of water trickled from his mouth, and in desperation I turned him onto his side. If he had drowned, then there was a chance he could be resuscitated, or at least thats what I had thought at the time. 


When I turned him, gallons of water began to pour rapidly from his now open mouth, carrying out hundreds of tiny orbs. His skin began to visibly sag, progressing further and further until Mr. Laramie was left as nothing more than a sack of crumpled skin lying on the deck. 


The thing they don't tell you about being out at sea, is that the winds steal away the sound of your screams. I'm not sure how long I sat there in the dark, pawing at the crumpled remIns of Mr. Laramie and screaming for help which could not hear me. 


 I shuffled myself to the Captain's quarters in a daze. When he finally answered my pounding at his door, I could only point towards the area where I had found the body. I followed him over, stopping just short of where the body would be visible. I heard the Captain shout in horror, and he rushed off to rouse the crew. 


We all coped with the incredibly bizarre death of the first mate in different ways. Jimmy and Timmy had brought along large combat knives, and they were using them to put on what they called a "show of force against our unseen attacker." Jared and I sunk ourselves as far into the work, the routine, as humanly possible. I just wanted to get the trip done and move on. You can imagine the despair I felt when the ship unexpectedly lurched before coming to a complete stop. 


The engine had been clearly and brutally sabotaged, with fuel lines which looked more like they'd been ripped than cut. 


I stared at the decimated engine in disbelief. The Captain reached out and put his hand on my shoulder. It was cold, and my shirt was left wet when he pulled back. 


"S'alright, lad. Jimmy and Timmy here'll have us fixed up in no time. Just think of how many fish we'll catch while we wait, me boy!" His eyes did something strange then. They seemed to move and stretch, as if trying to separate from one another. 


"Captain... are you feeling well?" I asked, genuinely concerned. 


"Never better, me boy!" Once again his eyeballs seemed to try and flee from each other. "Now let's get to work!" 


Jared and I tried to make small talk while we worked through the day, but mostly we just stood around in a daze. Our situation had grown incredibly dire, incredibly quickly. 



He was the first one who found Timmy that night. We were awoken by a massive clatter. Timmy and his brother, Jimmy,  had been working through the night to get us back up and running. Something had slashed Timmy viciously down his torso, spilling his guts out into his lap where he sat slumped against the engine. His mouth was moving in an attempt to speak last words, but none would come. He reminded me of one of the fish we had caught. Uselessly bumping his gums against each other in some vain attempt at one last act. We spread out and searched through the ship, but Jimmy was nowhere to be found. 


Jared and I called an emergency meeting of the remaining crew. Together, we accused the Captain, whose eyes had grown more tubular in their shape and at least twice their usual size, of being some sort of demon.


"A demon? Listen to yerself, lad. What kind of demon would I be? What kind of demon would take a boatload of fuckheads like you on a fishing voyage, let alone pay you? Far as I'm concerned, Jeff here is the only one a ya that's worth a damned dime."


Jeff, the mute, had apparently taken the Captain's side. The last time I ever saw him, he was glaring back at me over his shoulder in anger. We divided the ship into two sections, fore and aft. The food and water would be kept in the middle to provide access to both parties. 


By this point, there were only the three of us left. Jared and I slept in shifts, and so far neither one of us had seen anything. The standoff lasted a few days, before we walked out onto the deck to find the Captain with our food and water teetering on the ship's edge. 


"You can't hide from me forever, lads," he gently nudged our bottled water out into the waves, "it's just us out here." And he followed it up with the food. 


I shut the door. There was no more sense in going out if there was no supplies out there. We planned to escape via life raft, but a storm had blown in. It stayed for two days. On the second night of the storm, during my turn to take the watch, I succumbed to my exhaustion and fell asleep. 


I woke up two hours later in a panic. The storm had passed, and the sun was high in the sky. Jared was gone. I rushed out onto the deck, finding the Captain squatting over his lifeless, bloated form. I fell to my knees, buckling under the weight of sheer hopelessness. Captain Yorke turned to face me, and I saw his eyes had ballooned to ridiculous proportions, each as large as a soccer ball. They drooped down by his cheeks as the eyestalks they were mounted on failed to support the weight. The stalks themselves were grotesque, like sea sponges comprised of taut human skin. The Captain had visibly shrunken in terms of height, with his limbs growing thicker and less flexible but more powerful in a way which was horribly apparent. 


I wanted to pick myself up and flee back to the perceived safety of the room, but there was no point. I was going to have to sleep at some point. Even if he didn't come for me, I'd die to dehydration or starvation within days. My mouth had become so dry that my tongue felt like a wad of sandpaper prodding desperately for any trace of saliva. I resigned myself to death as the Captain leaped across the deck and landed on my chest. 


He held me firmly in place, distending his jaw and placing my entire head in his mouth. His icy lips locked around my neck, forming a seal. The afternoon sun bled red through the skin of his cheeks, providing just enough light to see water trickling in to the Captain's mouth. I struggled to free myself from him for five minutes which each felt like an hour. As the water level rose, I was able to smell the fact that it was not sea water. It was fresh. Drinkable. I was so desperate that I might have done it, if it hadn't been for the tiny orbs I'd felt bumping against every inch of submerged skin. My mouth was eventually covered, and the fluid had risen to just below my nose when I finally managed to break a hand free from the grasp of Captain Yorke. I flailed wildly, grabbed the first thing my hand found and pulled. 


A splash echoed across the deck as the Captain released me and began to howl in pain. I had grabbed his eyestalk, and pulled the whole thing clean off. I didn't waste my moment. I grabbed the other eye and yanked until it separated with a sickening squelch. The Captain stumbled blindly, slashing at the air with fingernails elongated into vicious claws. When he wandered too close to the edge, I delivered a kick which sent him plunging into the briny deep. I collapsed on the spot. 


I'm not sure how long I lay there drifting aimlessly through the sea. I'm pretty sure the dehydration affected my memory, as it's mostly just a blank. I do remember one night though. I'd say, maybe two days after I had killed Captain Yorke, I saw Jared's body suddenly shift, turning his head to lay against the deck. I heard water rushing out of his mouth and out toward the sea, and then, a few minutes later, I heard a tiny splash from the side of the ship. Like something very small had fallen, or jumped, down into the churning waves of the Atlantic. Then another. And another. Then ten more, and another ten after that until I had become completely convinced that there were thousands of *somethings* in the water all around. 


I was found a couple days later by a friendly fisherman who fed me and gave me water.  He even let me use his phone to get messages out to what few friends and family I have left. He said he's going to take me to his hometown to rest up before he drives me down to West Virginia. I'm going home to see my family again. I think of Jared and the others. I only just met them, and now they're dead and gone. I need to be somewhere that I'm known, no matter how bad it might be. Just a few days of rest in Innsmouth and then I'll be on my way.
