I told my daughter to look at the pretty flowers. 

She did, giggling, and I pulled out my handheld, stuck it in the back of her tiny head and pulled the trigger.

I wanted to cry, but I didn't feel sad.

I wanted to feel sympathy, like any other father. 

Empathy. 

*Something*.

But I didn't feel anything. I just felt empty. 

When I was a teenager, I unwillingly took part in an experiment that ruined my life. That's is all I am going to say. 

After shooting my daughter dead, I buried her in the flowers she loved.

Daisies. 

My baby really loved daisies. 

Hours later, I was sitting on a bench in a park, trembling, my fingers wrapped around a coffee I didn't even want. 

The sky was blue, but it wouldn't be for long. 

There was no real breeze, nothing to relieve me from the sticky summer heat. 

Two children had already disappeared in front of me. 

They were running around laughing with ice cream cones, and then they were gone, a puddle of dessert stemming across scorching concrete. When an apple tree blinked out of existence, I pulled out a book, corked in my headphones, and began to read. 

Midway down the first page, my phone vibrated.

“Sir, where are you?” The panicked voice slammed into me. “Your daughter–”

“Observing, Allison.” I said. 

“But…but… your daughter–” 

I ended the call before Allison could chew me out. 

I ignored the butterfly changing color in front of me. 

The cat sliced in two that continued walking, spilling scarlet lumps. 

Poor thing. I wanted to end it's misery, like I want to end so many others. 

But I was stuck. 

When I moved towards the cat, it slowly bled into nothing. 

I was so fucking tired. 

Halfway through my book I wasn't really paying attention to, a voice pulled me from momentary peace. 

“We’ve found your baby, sir!”

I was half expecting it, but part of me wanted to hope that blowing my daughter's brains out would be enough. 

Maybe that was why Allison sounded so scared.

*Maybe it was Code Red.*

Lifting my head, I found myself face to face with the mayor’s eight year old son. 

Jasper Carrington’s eyes were bright with excitement, though I wasn't sure I could call it *his* excitement. Behind him, were his three partners in crime. 

Peter, Evelyn, and Sunny. 

I was a stranger to them. Just a man in a park. A park that was a little too big with too much space. A park that didn't make sense. But I had known them their whole lives. From birth, and then even further beyond, all the way back to the beginning. I knew every part of them, while to these four kids, I was just a stranger. 

**Stranger Danger.**

In Jasper’s arms was my little girl, and I had to pretend to be happy, pretend to jump up and grab her, cradling my daughter, my *mistake* to my chest. 

But I wasn't smiling. 

Even holding her in my arms, I failed to carve my lips into happiness. 

I was a bad father. 

But *she* was a very bad daughter. 

I found it hard to hold her, wrap my arms around her like she was mine. 

“You don't seem very happy.” Evelyn spoke up, folding her arms. 

I wasn't sure if they were her words, but I wanted them to be. 

I took a sobering moment to wonder if she was coming loose. Maybe very slowly. 

“No, no, I am happy!” I forced a laugh. “Thank you for, uh, finding my baby.”

In my arms, my daughter’s smile was sweet, and the children giggled and cooed at her. 

“She's so cute!” Sunny waved at my baby, ruffling my daughter’s hair. Her gaze found mine, and I struggled to make eye contact. “What's her name?”

“Marin.” I said. 

Sunny’s eyes widened. “Marin! That's a pretty name!”

Part of me wanted to scoff, but then I remembered they were just little kids. They had zero idea and didn't deserve to have an idea. Not just yet. Slipping my hand in my pocket, I pulled out my wallet and handed out twenty dollars each. But, to my surprise, the kids shook their heads and backed away. 

“We’re good!” The Mayor’s son grinned, and my stomach twisted. 

“We just do this for fun.” He said, backing away. “We’re happy we found your baby!”

Peter nodded. “Can you tell others about us?” He asked. “Tell them that we’ll find anything!”

I nodded weakly. 

“Right.” I said. “Like a–” 

“Like real detectives.” Evelyn said, jumping up and down. “We’re going to solve crimes.”

“And find evil murderers!” Peter joined in. 

I felt nauseous, my legs starting to give way. 

In my arms, my little girl giggled, babbling. 

I watched the kids stop abruptly. Evelyn froze in mid air. The Mayor’s son turned back to me, his head twisting *all* the way around, smile widening. 

I stayed stock still, reminding myself this was *normal.*

If the kids started to cry, then it *wouldn't* be normal. 

“Actually!” Jasper Carrington’s expression contorted, his eyes spinning around, and my daughter laughed harder, squealing. He went limp, and I felt her tugging him back and forth. His eyes blinked open and closed. I could tell my daughter was proving a point. 

“Weeeee actually take donations!”

“No we don't!” Sunny hissed, hitting him.

“Yes we do!”

Peter bounced up and down, his lips stretching wider and wider and *wider*. 

“We doooooo now!”

Marin's gleeful laughs made me sick to my stomach.

She waved her tiny hands, and Evelyn threw her head backwards. 

I saw the strain in the girl’s face, her eyes widening. 

Momentary clarity, and *fear* twisting her expression. 

Terror. 

I think she was awake, for maybe a split second. 

I think she could taste the blood pooling from her lips. 

When Marin shifted in my arms, Evelyn's strings twitched, her head springing back to its original position. 

I was not allowed to intervene. If I did, bad things would happen.

No matter how hard I wanted to save them, I had to stay stoic. I had to remember my promise. So, maintaining my smile, I handed the kids their cash and watched them run away, bleeding into the collapsing town around us, where only they would exist. I pretended not to see the strings wrapped around exposed spines, elevating their heads, entangling every part of them. The writhing, almost sentient threads were everywhere, suffocating their blood, entangled around bones, organs, every thought, every inch of their existence, dragging them further and further through an expanding park. 

That would never stop growing. 

I held my daughter tighter, resisting the urge to snap her tiny neck. I loved her.

I hated her. 

She was my mistake, and I was fucking terrified of my sweet, sweet Marin. 

But then she would take my fingers and toes, tearing away my limbs like doll pieces. 

Finally, my head. 

But she wouldn't take my eyes. 

Marin wanted me to see what she was doing to them. 

So, I watched my daughter’s favorite  puppets perform for her, dancing on strings. 

And ignored my own, wrapped and entangled around my heart. 

That was a long time ago. 

My daughter has her very own dollhouse now. 

She calls it *Middleview*. 

I've been complicit for this long, letting her get away with this torture. 

Marin is a very special and powerful little girl. If she does not have dolls, then she will destroy and rip apart real towns, and *real* people, twisting and contorting them into her playthings. 

She is no longer under my responsibility. 

I am her father, but it is the Mayor who continues this cruel charade. 

He gives her everything she wants, at the expense of real lives.

He gave her his own son’s life to save his own. 

I am terrified of my baby, but this time, I won't stand by and let her do this. 

I *will* stop her. 

And I *will* save her now grown up dolls.

One of them has escaped, and is being hunted down as I type. 

Another, is reportedly killing innocent people. 

The third is in the back of my colleague's car, neither dead nor alive.

And the fourth is still on stage, still dangling on strings. 

I tried to kill my daughter today too. 

I stuck my gun into the back of her head, and pulled the trigger. 

She just [laughed](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/6A4rNC6v5Z).
