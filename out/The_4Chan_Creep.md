So I, a 18-year-old guy with a laptop, fell down the alt-right, edgy-gamer rabbit hole. Not proud of it, but I did. It happens in stages, a series of little algorithm nudges until suddenly your feeds are full of Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate and eventually you end up on the bastion of basedness, 4Chan. I remember when I first opened the site, it felt like the wild west of the internet. The nostalgic 2005 format, the light green text, everyone acting like friends or sort of compatriots in crime. You aren't supposed to be on 4Chan, your parents wouldn't approve, and that's exactly what makes it so appealing for a rebellious teen.

I just didn't realize that not everyone on these sites are naive 18-year-olds like me. There are some weird, creepy people out there that want to do you harm. That's putting it nicely. I learned it the hard way. This is the only story I will ever be able to tell.

I made one post, a selfie of myself making a face in front of a billboard down the street that I found funny. Within literally seconds, people start upvoting and commenting. Posting a new thread on 4Chan is like feeding the beast. all the users are  piranhas waiting for fresh meat to devour -- very few actually create posts, it's all about tearing the posts of others down, tearing down whoever puts themself out there. Most of it was funny until I got a message from a user, who had an innapropriate username involving "panties" that I can't type out here. Let's just call him "Mr. Panties" for now (and yes, he ended up being a him, of course).

"Henlo fren" he opens, along with a friendly looking image of pepe the frog.

"henlo" I say.

"Just looking out for you, new fren, when you post like you just did, without a username, your IP address is visible to people like me. Given you didn't use a VPN service (I know all the common ones) that means it's relatively easy for people like me to see exactly where you're posting from (surprisingly, very close to me!)That plus some of the personal details and your face make it easy for people like me to triangulate quite a lot about you, more than you'd want out there. Just letting you know so you stay safe on the internet from people like me!!!"

The second I read this weird note, with the strange repeated references to "people like me" I felt a pit in my stomach. I raced to delete the post and scrub as much information as possible. To appease whatever creature was messaging me, I replied:

"OMG thanks so much fren. I had no idea. Appreciate you looking out for me!"

"Hahahahha of course. I see you did the smart thing and erased all your stuff to try and keep yourself from people like me. But remember, where there's a will, there's a way" \*sends evil looking pepe the frog \*

I decided at this point it was best to stop engaging with Mr. Panties. But he did not decide the same for me, after 15 minutes hit me with the notorious double text.

"Tell me, cutie, is it weird that I know what you look like but you don't know what I look like?"

At this point, I decided that was enough internet for the day. And that maybe I should stop hanging out on 4Chan. I shut the laptop and went about my daily business for the next couple days.  It was the summer before college for me and I spent my days in my basement bedroom of the family home, gaming and browsing the internet. I didn't think once of Mr. Panties, you see a lot of weird stuff on the internet and rare to take anything personally. But in my clicking storms and scrolling, after a couple days I found myself on 4Chan again, just to click around. I found that I had missed many. many. messages from Mr. Panties.

"Awww cat got your tongue?"

"... I help you out and you won't even respond to me?"

"Henlo? Fren? BOOP BOOP I'M TALKING TO YOU"

Then a message that made my heart drop and sent a tingle up my spine.

"Brendan, I know who you are and I know where you live"

My name is, in fact, Brendan. And the worst part was that he had sent that a full day and a half ago, and had been obsessively sending more and more texts, increasingly vulgar. He knew my name and where I lived. I suddenly started thinking about calling the police, but also that seemed a little escalation for an internet troll, and he hadn't sent me a death threat (yet). So I decided to just ignore Mr. Panties and hope it would blow over. You can never let a troll know they're bothering you.

So I continued my routine, kept distracting myself by scrolling, took a shower later that night, crawl into bed and scroll a few minutes until falling asleep. I had bad dreams, woke up multiple times in the night, thought about Mr. Panties. I leave my door very slightly ajar at night, and in my foggy, half dream state, I noticed that whenever I woke up, at 30 minute to one hour increments, the ajar door seemed to be very slowly expanding. The dark crack on the corner of the white door just slowly growing larger at an imperceptible rate when you looked at it, but when you saw it an hour later, appeared larger. Like someone was just cracking it open, little by little, as time passed. I knew this was crazy. The air also felt heavier, slightly smokey.

A couple hours pass-- I look over at my bedside table and it's now 4am. Why did I keep waking up so much. I peer over at the ever expanding door. It's now at least half way open. Theres unmistakably smoke throughout the room. And in that dark crack, I see a pale, pasty, chubby face eyeing me, lurking in that crack, dead still. He's wearing a weird pink hat thing and graphic tee.

"Hush, child. I have come to collect my vengeance. You're merely dreaming right now. That's laughing gas I piped in here. Your screams mean nothing."

Everything was fuzzy. Maybe I was just dreaming I thought, hopefully (or hopelessly), as I faded out of conscousness. I wake up a couple hours later and the pudgy face is now inches from mine, eyes open and staring just two inches from mine.

"Heyyyyy" he says breathily. "It's me, Mr. Panties. Great to be here together. Would it be weird. Hmf let me try asking this again. Can I touch my cheek to your cheek? Just like, platonically. Can I rub my cheek against your cheek? I know I have stubble but it's not painful, your cheek just looks so smooth."

And you want to know the kicker of this whole story? I got the roles reverse. I, the author of this post, am Mr. Panties. Don't trust what you read on the internet, and definitely don't trust people like me. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
