**Part One**

  
I was never the best driver, being a very anxious person and - finding it hard to make quick decisions didn’t make it any better at that. “You have the stress tolerance of a woman.” - is what my father used to tell me in a disappointed tone. And two days ago, I *really* proved him right.

I was heading south in my old Honda Corolla, which, by the way, is really the only direction you can go when you live in Maine. My destination was Dover, NH - and even though visiting family wasn’t my favorite thing to do, my dad’s funeral probably wasn’t something I could miss. I had been driving for hours without any pauses, figuring that just getting it over with would be better. The road ahead was dark, with the road lights offering just enough light, no cars in sight, something I found both eerie and comforting at the same time. The only thing I could see other than the road was the treetops of the forest wooshing past my peripheral vision. I was usually pretty nervous when I had to travel far in my car to a place I hadn’t gone to before, but I had made this drive countless times before so I was calm and collected; maybe even a little bored. About an hour passed and that feeling kept creeping up on me, the feeling of being bored. So totally unlike myself, I decided to take a different route. I knew that not too far ahead, there was a right turn I could make onto a dirt road that basically just made a half-circle through the forest and back to the main road, so I decided to take it. Fast forward a few minutes and there it was, that right turn that led to the dark dirt road, just a few hundred feet ahead. I started having doubts as I gently pressed the brakes, but I told myself there was no turning back and to stop being a coward. Part of me thinks I made that turn out of spite, to prove to my dad that I wasn’t as much of a coward as he thought I was.

I made the turn, the slender, dark, dirt road staring back at me, almost taunting me for making such a pointless and stupid detour. Nevertheless, I kept driving. After a few minutes, I was getting used to it and started calming down. So I started thinking about the funeral, “Will there be crying?” - I thought to myself, I didn’t like the idea of confronting that side of myself that was grieving my father’s death. The “rough love” relationship I had with my father really wasn’t serving me well, to no one’s surprise. While being totally lost in thought, my focus totally shifted to the roaring, engine-like sound in the distance. “Someone else on this road? Impossible.” - I thought, so as to keep myself calm. But the sound just kept growing and growing as my heart started beating faster and faster, I could feel my palms getting sweaty, dampening the fake leather on my steering wheel. I started panting, almost hyperventilating, that’s when I saw the trees in front of me get illuminated and just a few seconds later - a large, pick-up truck appeared from beyond the bend of the curve ahead. It was going fast, way too fast, even though its headlights were so strong, the driver didn’t seem to notice me… or maybe he didn’t care.

It was over just as fast as it started, the large pick-up truck now behind me. I closed my eyes and let out a sigh of relief, my car still moving. To say the least, that relief wouldn’t last. I quickly realized I had forgotten about the curve ahead. In the next few seconds, so many thoughts and emotions went through me. An intense feeling of dread, a looming feeling of hopelessness, panic, regret, fear and - even a bit of anger directed towards mostly myself. The last thing I saw was the trunk of a tree and my last thought was - “I don’t wanna die.”
