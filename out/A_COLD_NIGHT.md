I still remember this as if it had happened yesterday. It’s burned into my mind like the never-ending footsteps of an invisible nightmare. It’s been almost two years, but I still can’t go a day without someone mentioning it on social media.

Therefore, I must get this off my chest... Maybe if I get it out, I can let it go and move on. This is exactly what happened, so please, if you’re reading this, understand this was an extremely traumatic experience for me, so before you pass judgment... Just try to put yourself in my shoes. Would you have done something differently? 

I awoke early that morning, extremely early for the average college student on a Sunday morning. I was up early because I had a breakfast date with four of my best friends. We’ll call them Kasey, Mandy, Jana, and Evan. Jana, Kasey, and I had all met freshman year, and we all three connected right away. We had everything in common and quickly became very close friends. Not long after meeting Jana and Kasey, I was introduced to Mandy, who grew up with Jana, so in no time at all I was just as close with her, and we had all been inseparable ever since. Anyway, I was supposed to meet them at their off-campus home at 9 a.m., and we were going to decide where to go for breakfast when I got there. It was a fairly short distance from my dorm room, so I jogged there instead of driving. I was supposed to be moving into this house with them, but I backed out at the last moment. I told them it was because I was having money issues, but that was far from the truth. Just imagining living in that house made me feel an immense sense of dread. It was a feeling that envelopes you and seeps into your core. Fear, dread, and anxiety are just a few of the feelings I can think of to best describe how that house made me feel.

Those thoughts washed over me as I picked up my phone to dial Kasey’s number. Despite her telling me to come over, I wanted to call and check if she was awake. I had a key anyway, although I’d never used it. I dialed her number and let it ring until her voicemail was picked up. I made two additional attempts before contacting Jana. Same thing, no answer. Next, I attempted to call Mandy, the person who replaced me in moving in, but had no luck. I almost dialed Evan’s number, which I had but never used, but ultimately decided against it. Maybe they were all up and getting ready. That’s probably the reason for their lack of response. Or maybe they were all asleep, which seemed rather unlikely since this was something we all had been planning since that Friday. I pulled myself out of bed and got ready pretty quickly. I tried Kasey once more before heading over there to no avail. 

It was a pretty quiet morning on campus and even quieter on the street that my friends lived on. No one was outside milling about as I jogged up to their front porch. I knocked and waited. No one answered the door. I tried three more times before deciding to use my key for the first time. I was a little peeved that no one answered considering two other females lived there besides the three girls that I was friends with, so it just seemed impossible that absolutely no one was awake or that no one heard me knock. I unlocked the door and was hesitant to step inside due to the overwhelming metallic smell that seemed too permeate from within.

It was a sickly sour smell that I will never forget. I don’t know why it didn’t dawn on me at the time what the smell was; perhaps it’s because my brain couldn’t register a reason for it to be there. I held my breath and walked inside. It was eerily quiet as I made my way to the small flight of stairs leading to the second and third floors, where my friends rooms were located. Once I topped the stairs, the smell was almost unbearable. As I walked into the hallway, I looked to my right and held back a scream that I’m sure would have been heard for miles. Lying that in the doorway of her bedroom was Mandy. She was lying there on her side, completely covered in blood. Visible cuts and gashes covered her hands and body. My first instinct was to run because it was clear that she was beyond help, but I thought of Kasey and Jana. 

I raced upstairs and burst through Kasey’s door only to be met with a more horrifying and brutal scene than the one downstairs. Blood covered every surface in that room. It was just a glance before I turned and ran as fast as I could back the way I came. I ran so fast and so hard it burned my chest and thighs. I ran all the way home and pulled out my phone to call the police... But I stopped short.

Wait, what if they try to blame me? Three out of six people in that house were deseased. Possible all six, but three I knew for sure. That would place me as the last person to see them alive. How would I explain being in there to find them? The truth was the obvious answer, but I watched enough true crime to know that I would be the number one suspect in this situation. I also knew the longer I waited, the worse it would make me look; it was then that I decided not to call. 

I know it was cowardly of me, but I was terrified. The absolute horror of what I saw was immeasurable to any horror I had ever experienced. It was the worst thing that I have ever seen. I was trying to think of ways to call the cops anonymously when I got a text asking me if I’d talked to Jana. It was probably a very bad decision, but I told them no; I hadn’t talked to her... I told them what had happened, but at the time I don’t think they believed me, as I was hoping they would talk me into calling the authorities, but they didn’t. They asked me if I was sure that I’d seen what I told them repeatedly before exclaiming that they would head over there right away to check everything out. I tried to stop them, tried to save them from seeing the horrors that I’d witnessed, but they wouldn’t listen. Lucky for them, a surviving roommate had already called someone before they made it there because the yard was full of kids when they got there. Some kids were crying, and others just looked shocked. They told me that one of the roommates ran outside and collapsed on the ground out front. The ambulance and police were called, and by this time so many people had entered and exited that house that I had no worries of my fingerprints being left behind. I wish my feelings of guilt and sadness over losing my friends were as easy to forget.

It overwhelms me at times, but I persevere. No one knows it but me. Everyone was too shocked and traumatized to notice that when I ran out that morning, I left the front door standing wide open.
