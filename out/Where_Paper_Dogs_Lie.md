The roads were long and lonely. I’ve been behind the wheel since the sun rose. People don’t realize how vast the Midwest is. It goes from bustling cities to pastures and fields, to long emptiness. My job isn’t like everyone else’s, where they go into the same place every day, stocking and accounting for people who don’t even care to know your name.

 I’m a farm hand who bounces between several states. I work for family, friends, and people who I build relationships with. I end up doing a little bit of everything. Machine work, shearing, building, stall picking, helping with live births, and everything in between. The money isn’t going to make me a rich man, but it keeps things going. I’m mostly paid in favors and a place to stay as I bounce around. I don’t ask for much from them cause I know money can be hard for them too. I did it cause I loved it. Every day was an adventure, every day was special. 

I had gotten a call from Mr. Thompson, a long-time friend and employer. He asked me to come on up and help him with the field cause planting season was coming up. He had a spare room for me to stay there for a while, and he said this time he could pay me a little bit more than last time. 

So there I was, driving my old pickup truck, heading to the next job. She was a dark green Chevy that had a few more birthdays than I did. She was one of those cab and a half, where there were backseats, but it was more like a claustrophobic leather bench with legroom that would be cramped for even a small child. On the long trips and time in between jobs, that was my bed. “Ol’ Miss Green” as I call her, has been my second half for as long as I could see over her wheel, but now she’s more like a mumbling old woman. She gets there, although she’s constantly sputtering, and sometimes she breaks down on me. I don’t know who’s more stubborn, me or her? 

I had made my last stop at a small gas station to fill up on fuel and snacks. The next several hours on the road were going to be spent driving through the Long Empty. It was about seven o’clock or so when I was cruising through a long section of road. There wasn’t another soul on that stretch for miles. That was when I saw it for the first time. It came out of the fields from the left and ran out in front of the truck. It gave me a startle for sure as I swerved to miss it. Everything happened so quickly, I was already past it and out of sight by the time I couldn’t digest it all.

 I was still driving at about 60 mph on this long road, but whatever that was didn’t sit right with me. Looking back, maybe it would’ve been best if I hadn’t swerved to dodge it but stuck it head-on instead. I was working off memory to try to piece together what I saw cross that road. It looked like a dog and was as big as one, but I swear its face wasn’t its own. It looked like a dog wearing a mask to make it look like a dog. It was stretched and looked hairless. I thought I was losing myself, but I just played it off.

“I guess the dogs over here are just fuckin’ ugly.” I nervously chuckled as I lit a cigarette to calm my nerves. 

An hour or so passed. That’s when Ol’ Miss Green started to spit and sputter, telling me she was done for the day. Without much warning, the engine rumbled and she slowed down to a crawl. 

“Oh, come on. Not now.” I said with disappointment.

 I used what momentum she gave me to pull her off to the side of the road and into the grass. She then spat, coughed, and shut off. I tried to turn the key to bring her back several times, but to no avail.

 “I hear ya, girl. I hear ya. You’re done.” This wasn’t the first time in recent history that she gave me problems. I sighed and let out a slow “fuck.”

 After a few minutes in the new silence, I then turned the key over to turn on the electronics but not try the engine. The lights came on and so did the radio.

 “Thank goodness,” I said with some relief, “Well, if we gotta spend the night here, let’s hear what the weatherman’s gotta say about it.”

 I flipped through the stations. There wasn’t much out here. Some gospel preaching, static, some Spanish music, and thankfully, the weather. I listened for a while and got the wonderful news of severe thunderstorms rolling in late into the night. I turned the key, turning her off so I wouldn’t kill her battery. On clear nights, I enjoyed sleeping on the truck bed under the stars, but it wasn’t going to be one of those nights. I looked behind me into the back seat.

 “Well, I guess we’re sleeping in the coffin tonight,” I said in a weary tone.

I checked my phone to call a tow and Mr. Thompson, but there wasn’t any signal.

 “Of course I ain’t got no God damn sign.” Frustration crept up in my voice.

 Even if I could call a tow, all these small towns out here shut down at a certain time, and they wouldn’t be out to me until the morning anyhow. Now I had to go with plan B. There was maybe a bit more than an hour of sun left. I grabbed my work bag from the passenger seat and got out of my truck. I walked around back and put the tailgate down, tossed up my work bag, and hopped up myself. I sat on her tailgate with my legs hanging over the end. I opened my bag. It was full of nothing but snack cakes and beer. “Plan B” was to sit out there and drink until someone drove by. Sometimes out here it could take an hour or even a day. But out here, sitting on your tailgate drinking is a universal sign of “I broke down.” Even though people out here are few and far between, they’re mostly all good folk and won’t just drive by.

After two beers, three zebra cakes, and a honey bun, I was thinking both that I was much hungrier than I thought and that I don’t think I’ll see anyone tonight. I laid myself backwards onto the bed, the warm metal on my back. I laid there, looking up at the sky, smoking one of the last few cigarettes I had. I was blowing my own clouds into the pinkish twilight sky.

I took one last drag then butt the butt out on the metal, leaving ash streaks. I slowly got myself back up and hopped off the truck. I went to get my bag, but I slowly turned my head to look off into the distance behind the truck. There it was. The dog. A few hundred feet off in the distance. Sitting in the grass by the road. It was watching me. I stared at it as it stared at me. I felt uneasy. It was the same dog as before. Medium-sized, pale grey colored with that flat face that looked like a mask. After a minute of us watching each other, he got up and started walking off to the side. He would walk about 10 feet, stop, and look back at me, as if he was checking to see if I was still watching him. He didn’t walk like a normal dog either. It bounced and stumbled as if it were a person trying to pretend to be a dog. He kept walking and stopping to look, over and over, until he was out of view. 

“Oh hell nah! Oh fuck no I ain’t having none of that spooky shit out here!” I said.

 I grabbed my bag, closed the tailgate, and went over to the passenger side. I pulled out a small gun case from under the seat where I had my revolver. I always kept it in Ol’ Miss Green. I’ve had to use it a few times while working, mostly for coyotes and other problematic animals. I tossed my workbag inside, then I loaded my gun. I got in my truck, locked all the doors, and put the gun in the back to where I could easily get it, since that’s where I’d be staying for the night. I was a God fearing Christian. I didn’t believe in monsters or boogeymen, but I did believe a strange animal could hurt you, and a gun could make you less scared. 

I crawled myself into the uncomfortably cramped backseat, taking off some of my clothes, down to boxers and a t-shirt. Pulling out a small quilt and pillow that were stored away in the cramped leg space, I then made my narrow bed. I got as comfortable as I could back there. I was still uneasy, but I was also very tired. The evening lights faded to darkness, and the quiet breeze turned into musical crickets and drumming thunder in the far distance. After I settled down and stopped moving, I started to drift off. It did not take long for me to be fast asleep with the calming band of nature playing. 

I’m not sure how long I was asleep. I woke up to what I thought was the sound of rain hitting Ol’ Miss Green. *Tic, Tic, Tic.* I laid there with my eyes still closed, trying to fall back asleep. *Tic, Tic, Tic.* Then it stopped. I figured it was a small shot of rain before the storm. After a minute or two, I started drifting back to sleep. Right before I passed over to the dream world, I heard knocking on glass. I woke up and got up quickly, thinking someone was seeing why I was pulled over, hopefully offering help. I looked at the driver's side window, then the passenger but no one was there. Then I heard the knocking on the back windshield behind me. I felt my stomach drop. I turned my head to look, and as soon as I saw it, I went into a primal state of panic.

 I flung myself backwards between the front seats. My back slammed into all the knobs and edges of the truck's console. My head went even harder into the front windshield, slamming the back of my skull and knocking down the mirror. It all hurt, but I was too afraid to really feel the pain in that moment. I stared, unblinking, at what was there on the other side of the rear windshield. Just on the other side of less than an inch of glass was something manifested from pure nightmares. It was the Dog.

What haunted me the most was its face. That familiar face of a dog, but disproportionate and sinister. Its mouth was too long and stretched side to side, full of crooked and rotted teeth of a man. There were hundreds of yellowish, glossy teeth. Its eyes were small, black, and beady like eyes made of plastic. It did not have fur or hair but instead a crust and lumpy skin that looked more like papier-mache. It looked crafted. Its head stood tall on a long, thin neck that sank out of sight. The face took me by such shock and horror that I didn’t notice all the limbs at first. My eyes scanned over to see that the tapping on the glass was coming from a bony finger of an old man’s hand. Next to it was the small hand of a child. On its other side was the soft hand of a woman, still adorned with rings. At the end of several limbs were the paws of animals pressed on the glass, and hooves of beasts dangling. Dozens of limbs in view, all connected to similar twisted long arms covered in ears, fingers, and toes that faded out in all directions. Its skin had small overlaying symbols and faded texts on it. Nothing could be made out for certain. What was only a moment felt like I was frozen in time, staring at this spawn of insanity. 

My frozen state was soon shattered when the thing shifted its eyes, and its expression changed. Its mouth curled into an ungodly sharp smile, almost consuming its entire face. The truck then lit up with all the lights flickering on and off. Radio blasted on behind me, quickly tuning through all the different stations and static. The only things I could hear were weather forecasts, gospel, and unfamiliar music that blended in and out of static and quiet screams. My senses were in overdrive. My panic was at a climax. Then it moved. All of its limbs, both beast and man, rose up to the roof of the truck, and it started to pull itself up on top. The toothy smile faded out of sight, followed by an unrecognizable frame of a dog’s body. Lumpy and bony, broken into several directions, mimicking a spider as all of its limbs anchored into itself from all sides. 

Its body then left my view entirely as I heard it crawl and tap around on the metal roof. *Tic, Tic, Tic.* I broke from my spot and jumped into the back seat. I grabbed my revolver from off the floorboard and held it tight with both hands, pointing to the roof. I laid myself down on my back, trying to wedge myself into the incredibly tight leg space. I wanted as much distance as I could get from this thing. I started to breathe uncontrollably. I couldn’t calm down. *Tic, Tic, Tic*. The lights continued to flicker as the radio blared through its search. My lungs were starved for oxygen. The air felt so thick. I was too scared to shoot. I wanted to blast all 6 shots into my roof, but my fingers wouldn’t move. They were as stiff as steel.

 I could see its haunting limbs stretch back down from the roof, reaching down to the doors. Everything was slowing down and going dark. I was starting to pass out. I felt as if my consciousness was drowning. My once steely fingers filled with numbing lead. Both arms got heavy holding the weapon, and soon my left arm had let go entirely and fell by my side. My strength was evaporating as I faded. The hand holding the gun pointed toward the ceiling was getting all of what little focus I had left. My blinks became longer. The gun heavier. The noises blurred. My arm started to finally buckle and fall slowly, with my finger still on the trigger. I was almost in complete darkness, the weight of the gun pushing on my finger as it was slipping from my failing grip. My arm fell. The last thing I heard was the old, tired words from the preacher on the radio,

*“Remember, the Devil is Real.”* 

Right as I faded, the gun went off in my hand, shooting the radio and bringing me from near unconsciousness. I was torn from a slow darkness to a high-paced panic like before, now with a painful ringing in my ears. My rigor mortis stiffened limbs slowly came back to life as I regripped my weapon, and I searched with my tired, wide eyes. There was nothing. The lights were off and no longer flickering. There was no tapping on the roof, nor ungodly limbs or smiles. I was left there in a calm night’s stillness once more. The pain and ringing in my ears faded, but my fear did not. 

The sound of crickets picked back up, and thunder roared ever closer. With these sounds and a moment of peace, I was able to properly fill my lungs. My whole body tingled as I regained feeling. My hands trembled and felt so weak. I noticed my boxers were warm and soaked. A tidal wave of terror and shame slammed into me. I broke into a quiet sob, too scared to let it pour into something greater. I wasn’t sure if I was safe or if it was just waiting. Maybe I was losing my mind. I was there in the dark, petrified, but as more time passed, I grew more curious. I peered out through the windows into the barely moonlit big empty. I could only see about a car’s length away from me. I never let my guard down or my gun. Maybe an hour or so had passed as I searched in fearful silence. 

The thunder came closer and pounded harder now. Flickers of lightning whipped in the distant skies. I was still in the backseat, peering out the rear windshield when the truck lights flipped on again. This time it was more intense and violent. I quickly clenched the gun in my hands as I turned to look out the front. The truck horn blared on and off, honking wildly. The headlights turned on, showing what was in the darkness. Creeping ever closer was a drove of pale colored twisted frames. They all wore big, sinister, toothy smiles and appeared to have numerous limbs created from corrupted imagination. They came in all forms. Spider limbed hellhounds, crawling trains of faces, a hulking fortress of hands, and one who towered above all with proportions stretched to the sky, gazing down upon me. 

I had five shots left. I pointed my gun at them from the back seat. “So this is it,” I whispered to myself. They grew ever closer, and the truck started to shake as their limbs probed her. There were too many. *Tic, Tic, Tic*. *Tic, Tic, Tic. Tic, Tic, Tic.* I could hear it all over. The door handles made a clicking sound as they continued their siege. “God, I’m sorry,” I said softly in the ocean of noise. My eyes watered as I closed them in fear. I screamed and shot four times through the windshield into the small army of crafted amalgamations. There were horrifyingly powerful sounds of animals and people howling with a deep, wet distortion as the truck shook violently in one giant slam. I then pointed the hot barrel towards the roof of my mouth. The taste of searing iron and gunpowder filled my senses. My ears were painful and deafened. Tears sprinted down my cheeks. I’m not sure if a bullet could kill them, but I knew it could kill me. I didn’t know what they would do with me if they got me. My fingers shook and fumbled, and my muscles felt hot. 

I sat there like a cowering animal. As much as I wanted to, I couldn't pull the trigger. I was scared to be alive but more scared to die. In my hesitation, I realized all was still again. I cautiously peeked my eyes open with my gun still resting on my tongue. Everything was black. I couldn’t see anything as I opened my eyes fully. At first, I thought that I had died. There was no moonlight like before. I removed the revolver from my mouth and tried to feel around. I was still in the truck, it seemed. There wasn’t anything rocking Ol’ Miss Green. No unearthly sounds or tapping.

 After carefully feeling around, I found my lighter and flipped it on. The small flame was almost blinding in this blacked-out sarcophagus of a vehicle. All over the windows were papers. I leaned closer to investigate. All manner of pages from books, sketches, newspapers, and more. They were slapped on the glass in thick layers, blacking out any and all light. I saw ripped out pages from the bible, children’s drawings, and headlines from all kinds of years, even dating back to the early 1900s. I sat there with my small flame, baffled and engulfed with curiosity and dread.

 The thunder banged loudly like a war drum as it brought the march of a torrential downpour. The thunder was then drowned out by the rain beating on paper. I watched as the library of memories soaked in the water and fell apart. Sections slid off, revealing the outside storm. The storm was fierce, but it brought me great comfort and peace. Hours passed. Eventually, the storm died off and the sun rose. Almost as soon as the sunlight peered into the truck, past what remained of the paper shell, exhaustion then consumed me. 

I woke up to tapping on the window. My body jerked as I frantically searched for my gun. I was disoriented. My hands slapped around like a helpless child. At a glance, I saw the sunlight was still bright and strong, and at the window was a state trooper. In sheer excitement of another human being, I lunged to the door. I swung it open haphazardly and fell onto the road on my hands and knees, with the officer right in front of me. He stared me down in silence. His eyes were both intimidating and worried.

“You alright there, son?” he said. I got up on my feet and met his gaze. His hand slowly relaxed from where it had hovered over his holstered pistol. He was overweight and past his prime. I was a trembling man with no pants, smelling of piss and beer. “I-I… uh, yeah. I mean- No, not really.” I choked on my words. My thoughts raced on what to say. What do I even tell him? There was an awkward silence between us. 

“I, uh, yeah. I broke down and uh-” There was a stammer in my words.

“What about all this paper?” his shoes poking at the soggy pile of pages and pointing at the rest that still covered half of Ol’ Miss Green.

 “I-.. don’t-” He proceeded to cut me off by asking, “And what about these bullet holes in your windshield?”

“I thought there was… You wouldn’t…” My words stopped. My thoughts stopped. Everything came to a screeching halt, and my mental state couldn’t handle an ounce more. 

I broke into a hard, painful cry. The man just stood there and let me cry for a while. He gave me so much of his patience. As my loud mucusy sobbing slowly came to a wet whimper, the officer sighed and pulled out a pack of smokes. He leaned onto the truck and lit up. His eyes darted to the ground, then back up to me, looking like a father about to have a heart-to-heart talk. He offered me a smoke. I took it and mimicked his lean onto the truck, but much more broken. About two minutes passed without a word. 

“I’ll be real with ya’,” he said as he looked off into the horizon. “I don’t know what happened to ya’, and I don’t think I wanna know.” There was a pause. “There’s been too many cases out here of vehicles covered in papers and whatnot. Every time we come around to them, either there’s not a trace of anybody, or it’s a slaughterhouse inside. You’re the first person to ever come out of one of them alive as far as I know.” He finished his cigarette and stomped it out with his foot.

“You’re not in any trouble. Let’s just get ya’ to the station and get ya’ cleaned up,” he said with an uneasy voice. I left everything there on the side of that road, even Ol’ Miss Green, and I will never go back.
