I'm Jack and he's Will, and we spent our whole lives together. We were living out our truck, scrapping, scavenging, until we got word of an abandoned mine in the hills of the Salem Plateau. There's a lot of good loot in those old mines, so we set out, just the two of us, to make our living.

We weren’t supposed to be there. The old mine had been closed for years, abandoned after a collapse took out most of the workers, and the locals said it was cursed. That didn’t stop us, though. We figured it was far enough from anyone who'd care, and besides, we liked the quiet and the solitude.

Will and I had been running from the world for a long time, just the two of us. He’d always been the brave one—the one with the crazy ideas that got us into trouble. But I never minded following him. It’s not like we had anyone else.

“You hear that?” Will whispered, his voice cutting through the heavy silence of the woods.

I paused, holding my breath. At first, all I could hear was the rustle of the trees swaying in the wind, but then I caught it—a faint, pained whimper coming from deeper in the woods. It didn’t sound human.

“Yeah,” I murmured, glancing at Will. “You think it’s an animal?”

“Only one way to find out,” he said with that reckless grin of his, already turning toward the sound.

“Will,” I warned, though I knew he wasn’t going to stop. We weren’t supposed to be out here in the first place, and messing around with a wounded animal was just asking for trouble. But when had that ever stopped us?

He gave me that look, the one that said *Come on, man. Don’t leave me hanging.* And, like always, I sighed and followed.

We left the old mine entrance behind us, making our way through the underbrush toward the clearing. The trees were thick, and the setting sun made it harder to see. Every step felt heavier, the weight of the forest pressing in on us. The sound grew louder as we got closer, that strange, low whimper that tugged at something deep inside me.

When we finally broke through to the clearing, we found it. At first, it didn’t look like much—just a small, dark shape lying near a cluster of rocks. But as we got closer, I realized it wasn’t just any animal. It was a cub, or at least something that looked like one, though I couldn’t quite place what it was.

Its fur was black, almost oily, and its eyes—damn, I can still see those eyes—glowed faintly red, like embers in a dying fire. It was small, shaking from whatever had ripped into it, bleeding out onto the dirt.

“Jesus…” Will muttered, crouching down beside it.

“What the hell is it?” I asked, feeling a chill creep up my spine.

“I don’t know,” he said, reaching out to touch it. “But it’s hurt bad. We can’t just leave it here.”

He was right. As much as I didn’t want to admit it, something about the creature—something about the sound it made—hit me in a way I couldn’t shake. I knew we should’ve left it. We should’ve walked away and pretended we never saw it. But I couldn’t. Neither of us could.

Will carefully lifted the creature into his arms. “We’ll take it back,” he said, his voice softer than usual. “Get a closer look.”

I nodded, even though every instinct in me screamed to leave it behind. The air felt different now, heavier, like the forest itself was watching us. But we didn’t say anything. Will took the lead, and I followed, our steps quicker now, like we both wanted to get out of the woods as fast as possible.

As we made our way back toward the truck, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows through the trees. I kept glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting something to leap out at us. The sound of the wind through the trees started to feel more like whispers—low and sinister.

By the time we reached the truck, it was almost dark, and I could feel that tension in the air again. I opened the passenger door, and Will gently set the cub down on the seat. But when I turned the key in the ignition, nothing happened. The engine groaned but didn’t start.

“What’s wrong?” Will asked, but I could hear the strain in his voice. He was starting to feel it too.

“I don’t know,” I muttered, trying again. Still nothing.

“Pop the hood,” he said, already climbing out.

I did as he asked, but I had a bad feeling in my gut. When Will bent down to check underneath, I saw his whole body stiffen. A second later, he stood up, shaking his head, his face pale. “The fuel line’s torn.”

I stared at him, my heart sinking. “What? How?”

Will didn’t answer. He didn’t have to. We both knew something had been out there with us. Something that didn’t want us to leave.

And now, we were stuck.

The truck was dead. I stood by the passenger door, watching as Will lay on his back under the truck, working on the fuel line with a roll of Gorilla duct tape. The line had been slashed—clean, like someone had sliced through it with a knife. But that didn’t make sense. There wasn’t anyone else out here… right?

“Just give me a minute,” Will grunted from under the truck. “I can patch this.”

I kept glancing back at the woods. That feeling of being watched—it was still there, pressing in on us like the trees were alive. We weren’t supposed to be out here in the first place, and now, with the sun almost gone, it felt like we were trespassing on something we shouldn’t have messed with.

The creature in the backseat whimpered again, that strange, unsettling sound that made my skin crawl. I shot a glance at it—still alive, still shaking, its eyes glowing faintly in the dim light. We hadn’t been able to figure out what it was. All we knew was that it was hurt, and it wasn’t going to last much longer.

“Maybe we should’ve left it,” I said, mostly to myself. I didn’t really mean it. Not completely.

Will’s voice came from under the truck, muffled but sharp. “We couldn’t just leave it there. What if something else had gotten to it?”

I swallowed, my throat dry. “Yeah… what if.”

As he worked, my mind wandered back to the old stories. The locals around the Salem Plateau didn’t talk much about the mine, but every now and then, when we’d head into town for supplies, we’d catch snippets of conversation about it. They always mentioned the same thing—the Ozark Howler.

I never put much stock in the stories. People said it was a giant, black creature, somewhere between a wolf and a mountain lion, but no one ever got a good look at it. Some called it the “howler” because they claimed it could mimic sounds—animal cries, human voices—luring people deeper into the woods. Others said it was just a ghost story, something to keep kids from wandering too far. But standing there in the dark, the whispers of those rumors clawed at the back of my mind.

“Will,” I whispered. “You remember what they used to say about this place?”

He stopped for a moment, not turning to face me, but I could tell he knew exactly what I was talking about. He nodded, just a small motion.

“The Howler,” I continued. “They say it’s real.”

“Just stories,” he said, though his voice didn’t sound so sure. “They tell them to keep idiots like us from wandering off.”

“They say it lives out here,” I pressed. “In the shadows.”

Will poked himself out from under the truck, wiping his hands on his shirt. He looked at me. “You hear yourself?”

But I could hear it in his voice—the doubt. The fear.

That’s when I heard it again—a rustle in the trees, faint but unmistakable. I froze, straining to listen. At first, I thought it was just the wind, but then came that sound. The howl. Deep, low, almost vibrating through the air.

Will slid the rest of the way out from under the truck, his face slick with sweat, eyes wide. “Did you hear that?”

“Yeah,” I muttered, scanning the tree line. “I heard it.”

It was closer this time. Much closer.

“What do you think it is?” I asked, my voice a little too loud in the stillness.

Will didn’t answer right away. He stood, wiping his hands on his jeans before tossing the roll of tape into the truck bed. His eyes drifted toward the woods, that uneasy look creeping over his face again. “I don’t know, man. But we need to get out of here. Whatever that thing is, I don’t think it’s friendly.”

I glanced at the cub in the backseat, shivering and whimpering. “You think it’s after the cub? Like it’s trying to finish it off?”

Will’s mouth tightened, and he nodded slowly. “Yeah, maybe. It could be something territorial. Predators don’t usually leave injured prey alive.”

The air grew even heavier, the shadows in the trees seeming to stretch and move. That howl… it wasn’t just some wild animal. It had a rhythm to it, a purpose. It wasn’t hunting; it was closing in.

“What if that’s what hurt the cub in the first place?” I asked, panic rising in my chest. “What if it’s coming to finish the job?”

Will gave me a grim look. “Then we better hope this patch holds.”

I could hear the unspoken question in his voice—what if it didn’t hold? What if we couldn’t get the trick running in time? I didn’t have an answer for that.

Just then, another howl pierced the air, this one so close that it felt like it was right behind us. The trees seemed to shift, shadows rippling through the woods as something massive moved between them. I turned slowly, my eyes scanning the darkness, but all I could see were the outlines of trees—until they weren’t just trees anymore.

Something was out there, moving. I could feel it. The hair on the back of my neck stood up as a large, hulking shape stepped out of the shadows, just for a moment, before disappearing again.

Will saw it too. “Get in the truck!” he shouted.

I didn’t need to be told twice. I threw open the passenger door and jumped inside, my heart racing as Will slid back under the truck, finishing up the patch. The cub whined again, louder this time, and I couldn’t help but look at it. Its eyes glowed brighter in the darkness, almost like it was scared of what was coming.

Will scrambled into the driver’s seat, jamming the key into the ignition. “Come on,” he muttered under his breath, twisting the key. The engine sputtered once, twice, but wouldn’t start. “Come on!”

Another howl—this one practically on top of us. The creature wasn’t hiding anymore. It was out there, in the clearing, watching us. I didn’t know what it wanted, but that look in its eyes—those glowing red orbs that seemed to cut through the night—it wasn’t just hunting.

It was after something.

The truck engine roared to life, and I felt a moment of relief wash over me, but it was short-lived. The sound of something crashing through the underbrush sent my pulse racing again.

“Go!” I shouted, my voice cracking with fear.

Will didn’t need to be told. He slammed his foot on the gas, and the truck lurched forward, tearing down the trail. But as we sped through the woods, I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever was out there wasn’t done with us yet.

The shadows seemed to stretch toward the truck, and just when I thought we were in the clear, I saw it—a hulking shape, just out of the corner of my eye, running alongside us, keeping pace. I didn’t get a good look, but it was big. Bigger than anything I’d ever seen in the woods. And fast.

Will’s grip tightened on the steering wheel, his knuckles white. “What the hell is that thing?”

“I don’t know,” I muttered, staring out the window, my heart pounding. “But it’s after us.”

And then it hit me—the cub. Whatever this thing was, it wasn’t after us. It was after *it*. But I didn’t say anything. Not yet. There wasn’t time to figure it out. All I could do was pray that we’d make it out alive.

We couldn’t keep running. The engine had stalled again, and the truck was coasting on what little momentum we had left. The cub, or whatever it was, had stopped moving. Will and I exchanged a look. It was over—there was no way we could outrun that thing, not now.

We stumbled out of the truck, standing in the clearing, both of us breathing hard. The shadows around us pulsed, moving as if alive, and I knew it was here. The Howler.

“I think it’s done for,” Will said, his voice quiet and broken. He glanced at the cub in the back seat, its tiny chest no longer rising, its glowing eyes dull now in death. For all we knew, it had died miles back, and we’d just been driving a corpse through the night.

I stared at the trees, my heart thundering in my chest. “What do we do now?” My voice cracked, the weight of everything crashing down on me.

Will was silent, his face pale in the moonlight. He slowly opened the truck door, reached into the back seat, and gently picked up the lifeless body of the cub. It looked a helluva lot lighter than I expected, barely a burden in his arms.

“We give it back,” he whispered, his voice barely audible.

I didn’t ask if he was sure. I knew we had no choice. We couldn’t escape, and whatever was out there—it wanted the cub - we hoped. Will started walking toward the tree line, and I followed, my heart pounding in my ears.

The woods were deathly quiet now, not a single sound but the crunch of our boots on the dry earth. The air was thick with tension, like the whole forest was holding its breath. And then we saw it—just beyond the shadows, waiting.

The Ozark Howler stepped into the clearing, its massive form towering over us, eyes glowing that terrible red. Its body was covered in dark, matted fur, muscles rippling beneath its skin. It looked like a predator—every instinct in my body screamed at me to run—but I couldn’t move. The only thing I could do was stand there, frozen, as Will approached it with the cub in his arms.

I could see it in the creature’s eyes—the pain, the loss. It knew. It had been chazing us not out of malice, but out of grief. The cub wasn’t prey—it was its offspring. We had taken it, unknowingly, and now it had come for what was left.

Will knelt down slowly, his hands trembling as he laid the cub on the ground before the beast. He backed away, his eyes never leaving the Howler’s face, and for a long moment, nothing happened.

The Howler stood over its cub, silent, its breath heavy in the stillness. The anger in its eyes faded, replaced by something deeper. It let out a soft, mournful sound—something like a whimper—and bowed its head.

I felt my chest tighten, a lump rising in my throat. We’d been so scared, so sure it was hunting us. But now, seeing the creature mourn, it was clear we were wrong. It wasn’t a monster. It was a parent.

I reached for Will’s hand, squeezing it gently. “Let’s go,” I whispered, though the words felt too small for the moment.

We moved quietly back to the truck, our steps slow and careful. The Howler didn’t stop us. It watched us go, its red eyes glowing softly in the darkness, but there was no hostility in them now. Only sadness.

Will climbed into the driver’s seat, and I slid in next to him. The truck, patched up and barely holding together, was ready to roll down the mountain. Will put it in neutral, and we started down the slope, coasting quietly. No one said a word.

As we descended, I looked out the back window. The Howler stood at the edge of the clearing, watching us go, its massive form silhouetted against the night sky. It didn’t move. It didn’t follow.

We made it down the first hill, the truck rolling slowly, the headlights barely cutting through the dark. The further we went, the more distant the Howler became, but the weight of its presence lingered, a reminder of what we had faced.

It let us leave.

The silence in the cab was heavy, neither of us daring to break it as we coasted down the treacherous slopes. The trees seemed to close in around us, the road winding and steep, but for the first time all night, I didn’t feel like we were being chased.

It was over. We had survived.

But as the Howler faded from sight, I knew we wouldn’t forget it. Its mournful cry, its grief—it would stay with us, haunting the edges of our memory.

And deep in the Salem Plateau, the Ozark Howler remained, a creature of legend, watching over its lost cub, as silent and powerful as the night itself.
