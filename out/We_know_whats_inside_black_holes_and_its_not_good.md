For purposes of covering my identity, you can refer to me as Tom. I'm the son of one of the hundreds of scientists scouring the universe for signs of life, though he did it through a lesser known medium - a "blacklisted" group which has had its reputation tarnished at the hands of the international community. They are on watch lists in over fifty countries and their activities are monitored 24/7. I already know what you're thinking - that means their collective families as well. You are correct, but I can't take it anymore. The truth must be known.

Anyone who knows anything about space knows that among the countless stars, there exist "violent" regions - black holes. We are all taught that these points are masses which enact a gravity so strong, not even light can escape. This is true and has been allowed to be shared with the public for decades, but there is a truth to it which has been hidden away. I only just learned of this over a month ago and all eyes are on me now. They already have my family in custody and are trying to track me down to my undisclosed location. I doubt I will have a week once this goes public.

The truth is this: black holes aren't just infinitely small points with infinite gravity. They are gateways to an alternate side of reality. You could call it the "etherealverse". Once on that side, there is no going back... yet. More on that in a minute. The etheralverse transforms matter, regardless of if organic or not, into a special energy which we can neither see nor detect. This is what scientists have called Dark Energy. Its not literally dark, but rather just invisible to those of us not within their circle.

The governments of the world have been in collusion with each other to develop a way to pass through these gateways freely. Technology has become much more advanced than people may think. They have hidden facilities all over the globe in places you wouldn't think to look. Cloaking technology is real and is just like you'd see in the movies. Ever wonder why people blather on about objects seen moving faster than possible in conventional or militarized aircraft? There you go. It goes deeper than that though, but I can't sidetrack anymore. There's no time.

Back to the etherealverse. So anything that goes through becomes dark energy which means it cannot be seen or detected or touched by us. Why does that matter? While true we cannot do any of those things, that energy does have an invisible effect on us. Our minds. They can be tampered with and manipulated in ways traditional science has not managed. Multiple personalities, dementia, schizophrenia, psychosis, and more. Memories, emotions, thoughts... it's mind control beyond limitation. They've managed to tap into that and are running experiments even as we speak.

But this is not the full extent of the revelation. I mentioned at the beginning that my father was one of the hundreds of scientists looking for life in the stars. We have. The etheralverse is where they lie. We don't know what they look like, but they know what we look like. They found us 77 years ago and if you do the math, you'll know exactly why. The Manhattan project was the point of no return. We "attacked" them and they've sewn their influence into those in power. It won't be long before our reckoning comes. My father discovered this and a little over a month ago, he met his end with a bullet.

I don't know why I myself have not been taken over but I can feel the influence. It takes time to corrode a mind into total submission to their call, but once it's done - that's game over. Forget the person you once knew. They are monstrous puppets manipulated by invisible strings which can't be cut. They toy with us and seek our destruction. They can't directly kill us, so they have us do it ourselves. Proliferation of nuclear warheads, pollution, war... even certain counties are the public face of their control.

Why am I telling you all of this? Because there is a way out of this and one to stop it? No, I'm afraid there's not. Once they got control of the leaders, there was no chance anymore. Their facilities are so defended and secure that it would make Fort Knox look like a padlock. There is nothing to be done. Try to ignore your intrusive thoughts and live what life you can while you're able to. Pray you're not around when they've figured out how to make the gateways accessible from both sides and these "beings" manage to take physical form. The blacklisted group made analyses that they are moon-sized and likely have a cellular makeup that absorbs nuclear and reactive energy.

They will "swallow" the sun and stars until there is nothing left. When I last saw my father, he had told me it wouldn't be long before they took over his mind. He told me what they spoke to him in his thoughts. "We see you. Always."

The look on his face told me all I need to know. Even death will not remove their gaze from you. And before he left, he closed the door with parting words "Eye contact is the end."
