[Part 1](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/170szx4/i_received_a_cassette_tape_in_the_mail_labeled_to/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

That night. The one after that. The one after the one after that, my brain screaming all the while: *tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him!*     

Sure, Brain, let’s just tell my husband that what we thought was a creepy cassette tape from the early 90s was actually a haunted cassette tape from who the hell knows when. That it came to life and escaped its plastic shell. That it slithered into our bedroom, re-formed its four hundred and twenty-one foot magnetically coated polyester-type ribbon body into the approximate height and proportions of a toddler. At which point this cassette-tape-turned-nightmare-fuel attempted to – and here’s where it hits him, the implications of my tale, his blood running February cold, eyes searching for his phone wondering, Could I dial 9-1-1 before she got to me? – strangle him in his sleep.     

Because marriage is marriage is marriage, but crazy is still crazy.    

Waking the next morning – “wake?” did I even sleep? eyes glued to the closet door, waiting for the moment that green-glowing indicator on the safe went “unlocked”-yellow – I found myself with only one option. My “Break Glass in Case of Emergency.” My ripcord in freefall:     

“Hormones?” he replied, whisking pancake batter thick as his own skepticism.    

“Hormones. Momnesia. The ol’ baby brain.” I snatched up a sausage link from the plate on the table, chomped into it.    

“But didn’t you just last night tell me *not* to say hormones?” *Churn-churn-churn.*    

“Well duh” – I said, chewing openly, then swallowing – “hormones.”    

It was not my proudest moment. Yet in my mind being a gender traitor was better than the alternative: The sideways glances. The air of doubt left lingering. The looming specter of that oh-so-simple question, “Hol’ up... is my wife *batshit?*” With those allegations off the table, and the alleged “monster” all locked up in the bedroom safe (in all the fuss that night I don’t think Hubby even caught that part), I now had time to bide time. To play the part. To be the most brazenly normal future-mommy the world had ever seen. I woke up. I snacked down. Took a walk. Returned to a nap. Dreamt only of—    

*Tape tape tape tape.*    

Woke up. Prenatal checkup at noon. Took the new used family car. Held Mr. Husband Man’s hand while the OB/GYN talked and talked and all I heard was—    

*Tape tape tape tape.*    

Woke up. WFH. Never alone, never alone. A double life doubled yet again. Quadruple life, and counting Ms. Fetus-Face kick-kick-kicking, quintuple life. Too many things. Too many parts. Too much mind wandering to—    

*Kick kick kick.*    

*Tape tape tape.*    

Until finally... “I’m heading out for a bit!” I said, this a few days into the whole charade. I’d already grabbed my jacket and was standing over the console table in the hall, hand hesitating over two sets of keys, two modes of me: the new used family car, the old used college car.     

“Do you need me to—?” Hubby stood back at the bedroom door, hand covering the phone to muffle the sound of the client on the other end.     

“Nah, I’m good,” I said, and with a jangle-*snap* snatched up the keys to the college car, was gone before he could say another word. Before I even knew where, exactly, I intended to go. After all, I had only a single piece of information regarding the “““thing’s””” origin, the return address, written in perfect psycho script across the yellow bubble mailer:    

The Halfollow House, Lake Mire.     

Wherever the hell that was supposed to be. I mean, the last part I recognized, Lake Mire. Had been dozens of times. Little else to do out here in I’m-still-not-telling-you-ville. But that first part, I had no clue. What I did have, however, was a plan: I’d climb into that old car of mine – that smell! the sense memory of the steering wheel in my hands! – I’d back out of the garage into the crisp autumn afternoon, and I’d find the hell out about this so-called “Halfollow House.”    

Afternoon? Midafternoon really, mid to late even. That time of day in October when the light hung heavy on the branches. Prime mystery-solving time. Above me as I drove swayed a wide canopy of autumnal colors: yellow-curious, orange-going, red-gone. I tapped the map app on my phone, selected something resembling the center of the Lake Mire area, and just drove. What follows then are the furious acts of Googling I performed – which said like that sounds like something you get marriage counseling for – at various stop signs, red lights, and the occasional highway shoulder. (Which *also* sounds like something for the marriage counselor.)      

I started with the obvious, the dead simple, “Halfollow House,” and got exactly what you figure, nothing. Tried “Halfollow” by itself, also nothing, or the neighbor to nothing anyway. *Did you mean Hal Follow? Half Aloe? Hitfollow?* said the screen. No, no, and no. Next, I tried adding in various versions of the “Lake Mire” part – the clubhouse, the outdoor mall, the Green Arbor Landfill (“Green Arbor” & “landfill,” oh the doublespeak!) – all of which told me exactly nada about nilch. At one point, I even asked my phone to give me anagrams of “Halfollow house,” resulting in such crucially useful stuff as: Sheaf Hullo Wool, Flea Hullo Whoso, Lawful Holes Ooh (ha!), and a bunch more nada-nilch. That was until the phone rattled off its last anagram solution, “Afoul She Hollow.”    

*Hal follow.*    

*Half follow.*    

*Half hollow.*   

What is it they say, every mystery a revelation? Well that was me now to realize that every time I’d thought the word “Halfollow,” I’d split it right between the “l” and the “f,” leaving the first syllable the simple “hal.” (Like that *other* self-possessed entity, from that one movie with the bad ape costumes.) Ah, but attach the “fuh” sound instead to the first syllable and you get a different sound, “half.” Then say it aloud – which I know you know I did over and over as frequent as the falling leaves – you didn’t get “half ollow,” because what the heck’s an “ollow,” but “half *hollow*.”    

NEEEEERRRRR—    

—went the sound of the utility vehicle barreling, briefly, right at me on the highway. No, I wasn’t smartphoning and driving, but I wasn’t exactly smart-*thinking* either. That was when I decided to pull over onto that aforementioned highway shoulder. Gravel spitting from under the tires. The woosh-lift of semi-trucks passing by. Pulled up Google again, but put in a new search string: “the half hollow house,” in quotes just like that. And what kicked back was something I’d never seen before: a single, solitary search result. No “Did you mean?” No “See omitted results:” Just the lone URL: www.labbabble.com/lets-talk-haunted-laboraties.htm.     

That one was easy: “Lab babble,” far as I could tell a site for technicians and scientists to meet up. For what? Slandering their bosses if I had to guess, but I suppose every thriving community in the world starts that way. Not that this one was thriving anymore. According to the landing page, the last date of copyright was 2003, which was basically the “haunted Internet” equivalent of a forsaken castle in the remote German mountains (making www.furnitureporn.com what, *Beowulf?*). Anyway, more important than the primary domain was the rest of the link, which led to a message board titled “Let’s talk haunted laboratories.” Here I found a graveyard of comments, most from the year 1998.    

“...in Elmore nat lab and I SWEAR I saw a ghost...”    

“...the equipment would always fail at the same hour, 12:07am...”    

“...can’t give specifics, but that one lab in Germany, the one with the “voices?” It’s true!”    

I scrolled past comment after comment. Until my eyes began to glaze over. Until it all just became one big haunted blur. And then...    

**LeidseNights88:** Wow, 40 comments in and not 1 mention of the so called “Half Hollow” House?    

*FOOM!* went a passing semi. I hardly noticed. I read on.    

**EinsteinRosenFridge:** Yeah mate prolly cuz it don’t exist. Theres rumor and theres hearsay and then theres the H3. Pure invention that one.    

**MemMori:** I wouldn’t say pure invention exactly.    

**LeidseNights88:** Oh yeah? Details, please!    

Excitement. Anticipation. Hope. I’ve always found those to be the saddest form of the thread-ending comment. How the empty “Reply” sits there in silence for ten, twenty, twenty-five years. Made tenfold depressing in this case, to be so close to someone who knew something –anything! – about this “half hollow house,” only for them to never follow up. I couldn’t help but imagine the scenario: MemMori hitting the “Enter” key just as the door kicked open and the goons of the X-Files’ Cigarette Smoking Man swept through the room. All to stop me two decades later from knowing where to go next.    

Except I *did* know where to go next, didn’t I? It was all right here on the page, and the more I thought about it, sitting there in my car with the engine faintly shuddering, the more I realized it. I opened up Google one more time, tapped in the words: “defunct laboratory Lake Mire.”

************************     


    

“5115 Overlook Road,” I repeated to the map app, then quickly added, “...Lake Mori.”     

Mid-to-late afternoon had gone plain late in the thirty minutes since I’d left home. Where the sun had hung heavy in the trees, it now lifted and became shadow. Wherever I was going, I needed to go faster. Cue my heavy foot, weighed down with pure curiosity. Overlook Road had a posted limit of 20MPH, but when you gotta go, you gotta go. I drove with one eye on the map app’s “current position” indicator and the other on the glowing trees that crawled by between my car and the lake. The trees were low-lying in this area, which made it difficult in that harsh light to tell that anything could be held in them at all, much less make out any specific structure. Which was the reason for the other eye on the screen, watching as a digital 5115 loomed closer.    

And closer.    

And—     

“Voicemail Received.” I’d tried to swipe away the notification, but clicked it instead. Soon heard my husband’s soothing voice. “Hey, lady, how’s the shopping or... some non-stereotype? Well, whatever you’re doing, something funny just happened I thought you’d get a kick out of, I was just—”    

*YOU’VE ARRIVED!* said the map app, cutting my husband off and ending the voicemail. Sorry, honey, got a mystery to solve. I slowed down, peering through the passenger side window, scanning the distance overhung with drooping oaks for whatever thing I might have just “arrived” at. Came to a stop as close to straight ahead of it as possible. Looked to the map. Looked to reality. Looked at myself in the rearview mirror.     

“Well you didn’t come all this way not to do something very stupid,” I said, and with that I pulled into the driveway.     

“Driveway,” let’s call it. Ghost of Driveway Past is more like it, but in I went, squinting in what was now basically head-on sunlight. Eyes so narrowed that you’d just call them closed in normal situations, but nothing had been normal these last few days, so why should driving be? Okay, maybe driving should still be. But in any case, I just... *went.* Into. Further into. As far into as I could, looking for...     

*That!* I slammed the brakes. Correction: I stood on the brakes, both feet, the car sliding in and spitting leaves all around me, until... I came to a stop. Watched the leaves clear. Saw before me a small squat building in the center of a rectangular lot surrounded by chain-link fence. Hanging from the fence was a small sign, dented and rusted, but the words still legible enough: “The Halfollow House.”     

Car into park. Feet onto the ground. I had arrived.    

The building was... how do I put it... *blunt.* Square. Concrete. Like a single tooth rising up from the forest floor. There were two windows, one on each side of a white door. The place had been reasonably preserved given the conditions of the grounds surrounding it, which to my eye appeared to have been decades of regrowth, of nature retaking whatever this unnatural thing place was. I stood at the entrance to the fence, which was latched but not locked. Stood peering at the building. “Hello?” I said, pulling my jacket close in the chill. “Anyone?”    

“We’re here! And well-adjusted! And definitely not looking to hurt youuuu!” I *didn’t* hear anyone say. Because of course there wasn’t anyone there. Hadn’t been anyone in many a year by the looks of the place. I bit my lip. Looked back at the road where I’d come from, hoping to see anyone – a passing car, a jogger heading toward her daily goal – just anybody at all that might bring some distant comfort. Nope. So, alone, I threw back the latch and stepped into the lot.     

That’s that dead-cat curiosity, remember? A rethought one too, because the closer I approached to the building, the more I found myself revisiting my original assessment. Where I had thought the place reasonably preserved, I now saw... cracks in that appraisal – literal cracks, as in the ones I could plainly see in the concrete walls. Cracks formed from the top down, as if at night the trees descended upon the building, this lone tooth, with their own crushing force. As for the windows, where they had previously appeared empty I now saw the remnants of black plastic pockmarked and weatherworn from exposure. And that door, which from my original distance had been simply “white,” I could see that its paint was warped as if from heat. “Hello?” I said once more, with an extended “ooo” that attempted (poorly) to mask a growing anxiety. I reached forward, took the door handle.    

Long story short: it was locked.    

Short story long: the door, which actually opened partially and only stopped with a sudden rattle of chains, was locked from the *inside.* Mysteries inside mysteries, my life had become. I put my eye to the crack in the door, held my breath at the dank smell of a moldy forever-wet inside these walls. I cut on my phone flashlight, shined it into the pitch-black space. And what I saw, I don’t think I will ever quite understand.    

It was furniture.     

Not normal furniture. I mean *tortured* furniture. Filing cabinets wrapped in chains and standing side by side like some corporate Terracotta Army. Desks flipped onto their tops with concrete blocks laid out on them like weights. And not just furniture – there was a stack five-high of bulky computer monitors wrapped around and around with winch straps. Heard of Casual Friday? Say hello to BDSM Tuesday! Everywhere my light went, I saw more. Off-white PC cases stacked into a monolith of 90s computing power. Office telephones nailed to bookcases. Lamps hung by their own cords from the ceiling like corpses in some hell-begotten land. And ahead of all this, lying on the floor just two feet ahead of me, I saw... a manilla folder lying free. From its corner, the gone-gray edge of a few sheets of paper. I wanted that. I needed that. I crouched, the light from my light casting furniture shadows on the ceiling as I went. Pushed my arm inside, my fear held at bay by an overwhelming need to know *something* about this place. I grasped for the folder, fingers scraping the concrete floor. I shoved my arm harder, turned my face so I couldn’t even see inside anymore, and just reached. And then... I had it, at least almost. Felt the edge of the folder under my fingertips, began inching it toward me. Ear to the door, I heard the folder sliding across the floor as I worked it up into my hand. When suddenly I realized that that sound, it wasn’t the folder. It was a rolling sound. Like – and I might as well just say it – like an incoming roller chair.     

*SLAM!* went the door as it snapped shut on my arm, like jaws gripping tight. I panicked, yanked back, but I was pinned there. I beat at the door with my fist, yelling, but it did no good. I was trapped. Caught. Inside, I heard the sound of stomping, shaking, rattling – heard but could not see, not shoulder deep into the door. Truth was, in that moment I didn’t care what the sound was, I could only think of getting free. I twisted myself so that I could get leverage on the door, pushed with everything I had and...    

My arm slipped free from the door, bringing with it – to my surprise – the folder I had been reaching for. Had clenched it tight in my hand, I guess, fear will do that to you. What else it will do: send you running for your life without so much as a glance back at your assailant, this door, this building, or the chain-link fence that surrounded it. Not at the trees, the leaves, the red-running sunset that keeps the shadows away from you just long enough to get into your car, start the engine, and get G-O-N-E gone.
