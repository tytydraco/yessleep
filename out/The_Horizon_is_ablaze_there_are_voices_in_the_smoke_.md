Inferno, what does that word mean? An inferno isn’t a fire, it’s something **dramatically** more powerful. I have worked with bush firefighters, they told me something on this, that I will never forget.

Rarely, firefighters get over run, which is when their defensive positions are unexpectedly and lethally threatened by a racing fire front, and they don’t have time to escape – in which case, they huddle inside their 14-tonne state of the art tankers and witness, firsthand, the power of fire as it consumes them. What I was told was, fire is loud, horrifyingly loud. “The atmosphere is energized enough to literally atomize trees.”

That’s something people don’t recognize about fire – it has a voice. And an inferno, oh how they howl and roar - a chorus a million immolated trees deep.

I live in Rural NSW Australia, and anyone who watched the news at the turn of 2020 would have seen how this hellish decade was ushered in by one of our most devastating fire seasons. A region larger than the UK was incinerated. It was during this period that I witnessed this series of events. I have the courage now to transcribe it, and the hope that the collective conversation of the internet might provide some answers.

Here it goes:

To describe the first event, I’ll explain my work. I’m a foley artist, I make sound effects for movies. footsteps, glasses clinking, flesh straining, that kind of background sound. I do so from the near total seclusion of my rural property. I have internet, a distant grocery store, and a rugged belief in a can-do attitude. I don’t need friends, or company, I don’t play well with others, they piss me off. Anyway, for my work, I have a studio, or rather a barn that I converted into a studio, sound proofed, custom tailored sound engineering rigs, internally ventilated against the heat, a midlife crisis done right. It is cluttered top to bottom with odds and ends, a million sound modulation dials and matching displays, old belts, collections of ceramics, every soled shoe under the sun, vegetables, trashcans, and on and on. A real kaleidoscope of interesting sounding objects. You need the sound of a happy alien moving about? Try the cheery little sounds of packaged storebought liver, stored in the second minifridge. That’s E.T., true story.

Anyway, I want to make sure you understand this process, its critical to understanding how I perceived these events. I have a very particular relationship with sound, it is my trade. I am intimate with it. Amid the heaped chaos of my studio, I delicately assemble soundscapes. The more subtle, the more belonging in a moment, the more perfect. I don’t seek to claim any cinematic moment, only heighten the audience’s immersion – If I am immersed in my own work, I am doing something right.

The first event struck whilst I was in this state, immersed. Around midnight, stood in the small open space in the center of the room, lit in the soft, unintrusive ring of the single halogen blub I use to work, headphones on, cables strung over the ceiling beams, cradling my microphone to the withered cicada shell I was slowly obliterating. Utterly spellbound in the sounds of it all. The percussive crackling of the abdomen’s structure giving way, segment by segment; the hollow and abandoned leg casings with their wavering straining and climactic crunching; even the taut chitin, split down the back where the creature vacated its skin, would with a promising tremulousness creak, and with a layered dun shrillness split wider under careful tension.

I don’t know when it started, but my moment was interrupted – by a sound. I didn’t hear it at first, much like you wouldn’t feel an ocean wave’s approach through the murmuring of the sand, until the wave hits you, engulfing your feet in a cold rushing. The sense was so similar to this... I realized the sound was there, then I realized I hadn’t noticed its creeping arrival. A voice.

I live alone, my family is a terrible story. And I am a night owl. A very alone one. Very isolated. Yet, there was a voice. Someone was outside, in the harsh red sands. In the sanctum my property, which I had labored upon to build. How fucking dare they! With a fury to match my interrupted passion, I cast down my headphones, quick temper overwhelming me.  
  
“WHO THE FUCK IS THAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY YOU CUNT”

rushing for the door, I fumbled the handle on my first go, an incensed rabid animal, driven forward. The dick door opened, and I descended upon the yard. Right into the pitch reeking stench of smoke, and a moonless night whose dark was fearfully pregnant, the stars blotted out by the very smoke that sought to throttle my anger and choke me into defeat.

And right there, lashing through the smoke reeling night air, warbling from the sky, sighing from the eddies in the dirt, growling amid the thrashing of the sparse gum trees, was a chorus, all encompassing, invading every space of my home. And it spoke.

**“DARAMULUM NGURRANG GUNDALOO YIRRI, NGATHANG NGARRI BE MARLA, NGARRIN BURRA BE BUNJIL, NGATHANG WARLPA NGUNDURU THANGANI NGARRANG”**

The smoke teared up my eyes, caught in my throat, and my retreating heel struct the door mat, sprawling me backwards inside, where I fell against a pile of my precious crap. It was then I saw, through the silhouette framing of the doorway, the horizon. Beyond that distant vast and flat horizon there was a deadly glow. Pumping, roaring and reeling violent shades of deadly colour, a profane sunset, an aberration of the natural world, the aborted miscarriage of God’s paintbrush, and error of his first day of creation, issuing forth an insidious chorus upon the airborne cinders of the land.

My kicking foot found the bottom of the door, and it slowly swung shut, encasing me in my sound deadened space. A pitiful defense. I became keenly aware of how loud I was breathing. Standing, coughing and gulping, I took a moment to think. This was a challenge, whatever the FUCK it was, I was master of my domain, and I would NOT become a victim, never again, I saw my family then. They always come back to me at the worst moments. The smoke driven tears in my eyes blurred my vision more and more.

“RAHHHHHHHHH, NO! FUCK OFF”

I struck my temple, hard, my palm left my ear ringing – it was distracting, it gave me a moment to think. And I recalled my evacuation plan.

I rushed deeper into my studio, snatched a wireless battery powered and muffled microphone, I don’t know why, audiophile habit, the delirium of stress? My car keys were in the house across the yard, the car itself in-between, the highway, a 70km straight dash through Roo infested country. Town, 120km away, an hour and a half if I made good time – and fuck me dead, I would tonight.  

The door handle, under my pulling grip, trembled in its frame, a thumping metal rattle, and the wind hissed through the slowly opening door, as I sucked a lungful of air through my bared teeth. Then I was plunging into the smoke, my fingers found the record button on my microphone.

This time it was a cacophony, a rioting discord of lucifers’ apostates, my hair found my eyes, my feet found stones in the dirt, as I drove my shoulders against the night, and dropped my eyes not wanting to see the horizon again. My shoulder found the front door and revealed the desecration of my home. The curtains tore at the hangers, window frames crashing, and as I grabbed my keys the kitchen table scraped across the ceramic floor, reverberating with the heaving power thrashing out against it. And all the while, those voices raved, layer upon layer of passion and fury, from every room, muffled within the subspace, the attic an echo chamber, and rushing at me from the living room corridor.

**“NGARRANG NGARRIN NGALANY BE GALA THURU NGURRU NGATHANG, NGATHANG MARRA NGARRIN YIRRAK, GARANG NGATHANG WIRAK, BE BURA KOORALI.”**

“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU, WHAT DO YOU WANT! LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE! THIS IS MY HOME YOU FUCKS!”

I wailed this as I turned into the lashing circus of the yard. The wire fences had torn up from the perimeter and screeched across my car’s bonnet, trees were groaning out in the dark, and something heavy CRASHED beyond sight.

Eight paces to my bashed up reliable Hilux, whose door tried to rip open in the wind, straining my one free hand. I tossed the microphone into the passenger seat, hauled my ass into the car, and tore out of there, red lining every gear on my flight.

My headlights illuminated the road before me, red dirt, short scrub, sparse blue gums and thankfully no Roos. I didn’t think I’d be able to stop in time, let alone save the car, if one of those overgrown rodents decided to kill us both by diving for the headlights. My heart was slowing down, the radio quietly playing some indie Rock something. I took a moment, then realized I hadn’t stopped the recording on my microphone. I picked it up, the soft foam muffler was coated in crap, but it was okay. I stopped the recording. I could see the horizon in my mirrors, but I didn’t look. Once was enough. I knew it was there. Vicious, angry, and inconvincible.

I drove the whole way back to town, somewhere along the way, in the featureless expanse, I escaped the extent of the fire and smoke's reach, and the horizon too folded away until it was normal again, dark and 3am. When I reached town I raised the alarm at the police station, that there was a fire, and a huge one. The small number of us out here were well prepared. Everyone called everyone, and by sunrise we all sheltered in the small tin roofed church. The single Volunteer Rural Fire Brigade and their single truck rushed to investigate. And by 9am, returned, puzzled. There was nothing out there.

I didn’t win any Favours that morning, and I haven’t taken a trip, however rare they are, to the pub since. But I know it was there, I know it was real, I recorded the bloody thing. And what’s more. Now, after everything I’ve been through, I have even had the voices translated! That’s right. Here’s what was said by the chorus of the smoke, and everything I have learnt about this first conversation with it – if you can call it that, this time.

The voices, under and over one another, chanted the same words, repeating it time after time, in a maddening heap of passions, tones and individual’s idiosyncrasies. It took me days of work to isolate this with a local elder, because would you believe it the voices were speaking a specific aboriginal language. A dead language. For those who don’t know the Australian Aboriginals aren’t a homogenous culture. They are thousands of individual tribes, all attached by language and tradition to their country - and for them country isn’t a nation, it’s a land, a relationship to it, a timeless connection formed through and by their elders. Its complex, and you can’t get it right describing them all in these sweeping generalizations.

Regardless, the languages at least are often related to one another. Derivations formed by off shooting tribes tens of thousands of years ago. Because of this, I and my local anonymous elder could stumble through a translation. Here you go, make some sense of it, please!

“DARAMULUM NGURRANG GUNDALOO YIRRI, NGATHANG NGARRI BE MARLA, NGARRIN BURRA BE BUNJIL, NGATHANG WARLPA NGUNDURU THANGANI NGARRANG, NGARRANG NGARRIN NGALANY BE GALA THURU NGURRU NGATHANG, NGATHANG MARRA NGARRIN YIRRAK, GARANG NGATHANG WIRAK, BE BURA KOORALI.”

  
Translation:

“THE FIRES OF DARAMULUM BURN BRIGHT, YOUR PASSIONS BE THE HEAT, YOUR SINS BE THE FUEL, WE SHALL SEAR YOUR FLESH FROM YOUR BONES, YOUR SOULS SHALL BE FLAYED FROM THE GRIP OF YOUR GODS BY THE TEMPESTS THAT CONSUME YOUR TEMPLES, OUR INFERNO SHALL SHAME YOUR GODS, CONQUER THE NIGHT, AND ISSUE FORTH THE FREEDOM OF THE KOORALI”

-------------------------

Best I can tell, the Koorali are a dead people, and Daramulum, well I don’t know, maybe one of their gods?

Australia is a terrifying place, its home to the world’s oldest continuous living cultures. 65,000 years of people’s energy, all out there, signatures in the expanses of our land. Yet, with callous ambition, Britan violently and brutally claimed the land. Exterminated populations, and erased history.

All I can think about is… what knowledge did the Koorali have, when they fought that war against the English. What did they do to fight back when all was lost? Did some of them see the annihilation of their people coming, and unleash something devastating upon the land? Who were the Koorali, and what did they do to avenge their apocalypse…
