I need to write this down before I lose my nerve. Before I convince myself it's fine. Before I go back in for my next shift.

Three months ago, I was two weeks away from eviction. My savings were gone, my resume was getting auto-rejected by every corporate chain in a fifty-mile radius, and I'd started mentally budgeting which meals I could skip. So when I saw the posting for Harvest Table. 

"Local. Ethical. Nourishing."  

Offering $18/hour plus benefits and free staff meals, I applied before I'd finished reading the description.

The interview was in the kitchen. That should've been my first clue.

Maria, the owner, was waiting for me at the prep station. She's a big woman, the kind of big that takes up space apologetically, shoulders always hunched like she's trying to fold herself smaller. But her hands were busy,  elbow-deep in a stainless steel bowl of ground meat, kneading it with her bare fingers while she talked.

"You ever work food service?" she asked, not looking up. A strand of gray hair had come loose from her bun and hung over her face. She didn't brush it away.

"Yes ma'am. Two years at a diner, six months at—"

"Good. You start Monday. Six a.m." She finally looked at me, fingers still working the meat. There was something dark under her fingernails. "We serve breakfast and lunch. Dinner prep only. Everything here is *local*. You understand? No factory farms. No chemicals. We know where every ingredient comes from."

She said it like a point of pride. Like it mattered.

I nodded. I would've agreed to anything.

"My daughter handles front-of-house," Maria continued, wiping her hands on her apron, not washing them, just wiping. "You'll meet her Monday. She's the face of this place. The *heart*." She smiled, and a bit of meat was stuck between her front teeth. "I'm just the one who makes it all work."

I thanked her. Shook her hand. It was still damp and cold from the meat.

Her daughter's name is Lily.

I met her my first day, and I swear to god, I forgot how to act normal for a solid ten seconds.

She's the kind of pretty that doesn't need effort, dark hair pulled into a messy bun, freckles across her nose, wearing a Harvest Table t-shirt that somehow looked intentional instead of corporate. She smiled when she saw me fumbling with my apron strings and came over to help.

"You must be the new guy. I'm Lily." Her hands were warm. She smelled like coffee and lavender. "Mom's probably already scared you, right? Don't worry. She's intense, but she really believes in what we're doing here."

"Yeah, she seems... passionate."

Lily laughed. "That's a polite way to put it. But seriously, this place? It's not just a job. We're actually *doing* something. No exploited workers, no animal cruelty, no fake 'organic' labels. Every supplier we use, I've visited personally. I've shaken their hands. I *know* them."

She said it like a confession. Like she was letting me in on something sacred.

I wanted to believe her. I think I needed to.

The first week was fine. Great, even.

The kitchen was clean enough, or at least it looked clean under the fluorescent lights. We prepped vegetables in the morning, assembled salads and grain bowls for the lunch rush, baked bread from scratch. The menu was small but thoughtful: roasted beet salad, mushroom flatbreads, a signature "Harvest Burger" that Lily said was our best seller.

"It's a house blend," she explained during a slow Tuesday afternoon. "Mom designed the recipe herself. Soy base, but with this umami depth that makes people think it's real meat. We get people coming back three, four times a week for it."

I'd tried one on my second day. It was good. Rich. Almost *too* rich, like the fat content was higher than it should've been for a plant-based patty. But I was getting free meals, so I wasn't complaining.

Maria ate constantly.

That was the thing I noticed first, not as a red flag, just as a fact. She'd hover near the line during lunch rush, pinching bits of roasted chicken from the tray (we offered one meat option for "flexitarians," Lily had explained apologetically). She'd taste the burger mix straight from the bowl, licking her fingers between batches. She'd saw off chunks of bread with her bare hands, crumbs falling onto her apron, grease smearing her chin.

"Gotta make sure the quality's consistent," she'd say, mouth full, eyes on me like she was daring me to comment.

I didn't.

It was week three when I started feeling weird about the staff meals.

We were required to eat them. Not suggested;  *Required*. "Part of the Harvest Table experience," Maria said. "If you're serving it, you gotta believe in it."

I'd been eating the Harvest Burger two, sometimes three times a week. It was convenient, free, and honestly, I'd started craving it. That rich, savory depth. The way it sat heavy in your stomach, satisfying in a way that leftovers from home never were.

But one Thursday, mid-bite, I felt something *wrong* in my mouth.

Not taste. Texture.

I froze. Reached in with my fingers. Pulled out a small, white crescent,  hard and smooth, curved like a fragment of shell.

Except we didn't use shellfish.

I stared at it. Turned it over in my palm.

It looked like a fingernail.

"Everything okay?"

I looked up. Lily was standing in the doorway, head tilted, concerned.

I closed my fist. "Yeah. Just bit my cheek. I'm good."

She smiled, relieved. "Okay. Don't scare me like that."

I threw the rest of the burger away when she left.

I haven't been able to finish one since.

But here's the thing: I didn't quit.

I *should* have. I know that now. But the rent was paid. My health insurance had kicked in. And Lily had started asking me to stay late, help her close, walk her to her car because the parking lot lighting was bad.

"I like having you here," she said one night, locking the front door while I wiped down the last table. "You're not like the last guy. He was always trying to cut corners, complaining about the sourcing costs. He didn't *get* it."

"What happened to him?"

She paused. "He quit. Just stopped showing up one day."

"Did he say why?"

"No." She looked at me, and for just a second, something flickered across her face. Something I couldn't read. "People don't always appreciate what we're doing here. But I think you do."

I should've asked more questions.

I didn't.

Yesterday, Lily asked if I wanted to visit one of the farms.

We were closing, the kitchen finally quiet after a long Saturday rush. She'd been talking about the suppliers again.  Her usual script about transparency, sustainability, knowing your food's story.

"I'm going out to Silas Creek tomorrow," she said. "One of our main protein sources. It's about an hour north. You should come."

"I don't know, I—"

"Please?" She looked at me, and I swear to god, I would've followed her anywhere. "I want you to see it. I want you to understand what makes this place different."

So I said yes.

We're leaving in four hours.

I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe because I need a record. Maybe because some part of me knows I shouldn't go.

But I'm going.

I'll update when I get time.
