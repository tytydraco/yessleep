[\[Part 4\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1373iid/i_trapped_a_monster_in_my_garden_shed_part_4/)

Clack.  
I jerked from my slumped position against the wall and winced at the soreness in my tight muscles. If I kept falling asleep in anyplace other than my own bed, I would soon be walking like my aged father, with a cane and a hunchback.  
Clack.  
Craning my head around, I peered through the open door of the storage closet, and saw the sanctuary bathed in carpets of fresh sunlight. Birds chirped outside, and the whispers had finally stopped. Aside from myself, the storage closet stood empty.  
Clack, clack, clack.  
I froze, and all the hairs on my body stood on end. It was as if someone had smacked a stick or a tree branch against the church’s white-painted clapboard siding. It was morning, the day had come. Nothing should have still been out there.  
*Wait . . . where’s Cricket?*  
My eyes flicked to the double doors of the sanctuary, and I saw they stood slightly ajar, the padlock and chain lying on the floor.  
A loud, primal screech pierced the air, right on the other side of the wall, from where the clacking had come.  
“Oh man, oh man, oh man.” I stumbled to my feet and ran for the door, my Winchester in hand. Leaping through the doorframe, I vaulted down the steps to sprint around the corner.  
Sour knots worked through my stomach, and I skidded to a halt.  
Cricket stood a few yards off, and not six feet from her, one of the bone-faced deer thrashed in combat with the shrubbery. It’s branch-like antlers were tangled in what looked like a discarded tennis net, and the old, frayed cordage had caught in the bushes that lined the church’s walls. With every panicked jerk the creature made to free itself, it rattled its bizarre antlers against the siding, making the signature clack, I’d heard earlier.  
Despite this, I could only gape with amazement and fear at the size of the being. It stood taller than any deer I’d ever seen, easily eight feet high at the scalp, with a spread of antlers that could have frightened a moose. The deer’s head bore the same eerie exposed sections of bone as the others, and both eye sockets were dark as shadow.  
“Cricket, get back!” With clammy fingers, I racked the lever on my rifle to chamber a gleaming 30-30 cartridge.  
She jumped in front of the raised barrel, waving both hands. “No! Don’t shoot, please!”  
*Does she not see the freaking mutant deer?*  
I blinked at her, but Cricket laced both hands together in a pleading gesture, her sad eyes rooting me to the spot.  
“He’s not dangerous.” She insisted and inched toward the enormous stag. “Watch.”  
“Cricket . . .” I warned and tightened my fingers on the rifle.  
She edged up to the deer and held out a hand to stroke at the huge, muscled neck of the beast. “Easy. Easy boy, it’s okay. I know it hurts, but you’ll feel better soon.”  
Stunned, I watched her reach up to the creature’s face, and pat it like an overgrown dog, the deer’s struggle ceasing to a few nervous jerks. With this done, Cricket slid her pale fingers to the dark eyes sockets and gouged into them with her fingernail.  
Crunch.  
A few whimpers came from the animal, but it let her pry one greasy chunk of black crust from its head after another, until a glistening dark eyeball peered back at us.  
Cricket smiled, and gently turned the deer’s head to get at the other eye. “There you go. Feels good, huh? Can I get this stuff off your pretty antlers too?”  
As if trained in an obedience school the huge deer lowered its head, and Cricket tugged at the mass of tangled netting.  
She looked back over her shoulder at me, golden hair flowing over her shoulders in a river of sunlight. “We have to get him loose. Do you have something we could cut this with?”  
Open mouthed with surprise, I dashed back inside to my desk. A pair of black-handled scissors slid into my pocket, and I ran outside.  
I stopped a few yards away, and cleared my throat.  
Cricket met my frightened gaze, and made a warm, reassuring grin. “It’s okay. I told him you’re not scary. Come here.”  
*You did what?*  
Slowly, I tiptoed closer, walked right up to the nightmarish mutant, all four limbs shaking.  
A pleasant warmth coursed through my left hand, and I looked down to find her fingers wound around mine. Cricket’s golden irises locked onto me, and her cheeks tinged a rosy pink.  
“Watch.” She raised my hand to place it on the deer’s neck.  
Satin bristles slid under my palm, and I could feel every twitch of the animal’s muscles, its nervous breaths, the thumping of an artery as it pushed blood to its heart. On its ragged face, I could discern a slight wriggle of the deer’s tender flesh, as if it were moving into place in an almost sentient way, healing over the bone that had widened to make the skull thicker, larger, stronger. I looked up into its baleful chestnut-brown eye, now clear of the sooty black crust, and saw my tiny reflection looking back. This thing didn’t want to harm me. It had gotten its head stuck trying to scrape the scum from its eyes on the bushes.  
*The sunlight. It went out in the sunlight, just like she did.*  
“See?” Beside me, Cricket beamed, and stroked the animal’s face with careful, light touches. “Not dangerous.”  
I gasped out a bewildered chuckle, and dared to keep petting the thing, its fur soft as a terry-cloth robe. “H-How did you do that?”  
Her smile faltered a little at that, and Cricket frowned at the hand she held to the deer’s neck like she had just awoken from a dream. “I . . . I don’t know.”  
Taking the scissors from my pocket, I cut away the nylon strands of tennis net, and let the regal beast shake his head free of the bush.  
He gave us both a snort, which I could almost have imagined as a gruff thank you, and trotted off toward a distant herd of his fellows, who were busy rubbing their heads on a few square tombstones at the border of the forest to peel the crust from their eyes. The morning rang with the song of birds, though I noticed a few unfamiliar tunes, as if other creatures in the treetops had joined in, ones like the deer that no longer feared the sun. All around me, the air smelled sweet, sweeter than I remembered, and a few frogs croaked a happy chorus.  
A finger poked my shoulder, and I turned to face Cricket.  
She kept both eyes on her feet and dug her bare toes into the damp grass. “I’m sorry for scaring you. I saw him through the window, and figured he needed help. That stuff on his eyes . . .”  
“Was the same as the stuff on you.” I finished, glancing down where a few pieces of the crust lay. “You said you told him I wasn’t scary. And he listened to you.”  
Cricket winced and rubbed her arm self-consciously. “Is that weird?”  
*Everything here is weird.*  
Curious, I threw a look back at the herd of deer, grazing in the rays of the sunrise. “Not weird. Just different. Can . . . can you actually talk to them?”  
Her face shaded a deeper crimson, and Cricket shuffled her feet. “Honestly, it’s more like . . . I don’t know, like I can tell how they feel about something. I don’t actually hear them talking, not like the white-eyed things.”  
At that last bit, she shivered, and cast a furtive glare at the trees. They were still in there, we both knew it, spying on our every move. Of all the strange animals we’d seen so far, the humanoid, white-eyed wooden-skinned freaks seemed to be the smartest, and the most relentless.  
“We should name them.”  
I emerged from my musings to find Cricket’s smile had returned. “What, like, ‘Spot’ and ‘Lucky’?”  
She giggled and rolled her eyes. “No, not like that. I mean, they’re a new species, right? All of the stuff that comes out at night is. We should name them.”  
Cradling the Winchester in my left arm, I nodded toward the deer. “Okay, go ahead.”  
“No way.” She crossed both arms and gave me a small smirk. “You have to.”  
“Me? Why me?”  
“Because you saw them first.” She held up a finger like some kind of gorgeous college professor. “And because you were here before me. Besides, this is your land anyway.”  
This time, I rolled my eyes, and set both hands on my hips. “It’s God’s land, Cricket. And it’s your home too, now. Tell you what, we flip a coin, and whoever wins gets to name whichever species we’re on. Deal?”  
A glimmer came into her golden irises, and once again, Cricket’s smile took my breath away. “Deal.”  
Instead of fearing the dark, I began to look forward to it, when Cricket and I would climb the ladder inside the old church bell tower with a pair of binoculars to study everything that came out of the trees. I took more technical notes, while Cricket drew the creatures on a notepad I’d given her. With every passing day, more and more species ventured into the sunrise, and as they did, they changed from nightmarish, incomplete freaks, to bizarre yet beautiful creatures.  
The Bone-Faced Whitetail were huge, graceful animals, with soft brown fur the color of new oxford shoes. They bordered on the domesticated side whenever Cricket approached, nuzzling her outstretched hand for sugar lumps, and licked her face until the girl laughed. She had such a way with the animals, as if they could sense she too was new to this world, and many of the critters trusted her implicitly. I had to be much more cautious, but eventually I could walk up to the gentle creatures and pet them while they grazed.  
Cricket named the bat-winged lizard creatures Firedrakes for the bright blaze of color that each bore on their snouts. They stood about knee-high, and walked on all fours like a pterodactyl, with folded leathery wings and scaly black bodies that ended in a long, arrow-shaped head. They had no less than six eyes, three to a side, and long whip-like tails that they could use to hold on to things like a lemur might. Firedrakes loved shiny things, especially coins, and we’d toss spare pennies we found in the living room couch to get them close enough to observe.  
New plants sprouted to life as well, Lantern Roses that glowed yellow and orange at night, Dancing Waterlilies that swayed on their own and smelled like fruity cereal, and the Bomb Creeper vine that exploded with razor-sharp needles if you got too close. Thankfully, I could rely on Cricket’s built-in sixth sense to guide me through these discoveries without fatal injury, but not all the newcomers were cute and cuddly.  
Birds with cellphones for heads collected in the pines along the ridgetop, their cracked touchscreens chiming in eerie, off-pitch ringtones as they flocked through the night sky. A few rusted cars stalked along on in a nearby marsh on bent, distended axels, their old tires lying flat like feet, with flickering yellow headlights that peered into the darkness. Mud-spattered radios scuttled over the gravel county road like crabs, playing fragments of retro music in disorganized patterns that almost sounded like crude sentences. Enormous Iron Spiders that masqueraded as signal towers during the day roamed in small herds of five or six individuals at night, bellowing with loud fog-horn calls from their satellite-dish heads. Once, I could have sworn I spotted our old red mailbox skittering through the marsh on four legs like an insect, but I couldn’t be sure.  
As for the Lost Ones, the white-eyed fiends that had been my first monster sighting, they still came often, and fixated on the church with manic attention. Calling out to them didn’t help, either from Cricket or myself, and their numbers swelled from a few dozen to over a hundred in three days’ time. Eventually, Cricket and I retreated to the storage closet whenever they showed up. During these dark moments, I’d read the Bible to Cricket, along with other books from my little library. Explaining God to someone again after so long of being on my own felt good, even if we were trapped in a broom closet with the world falling apart in a slow-motion apocalypse all around us.  
But things weren’t all sunshine and Lantern Roses.  
Our food stocks were dwindling. Cricket’s appetite dropped after the first day or so to normal human levels, but still, I only had maybe a month’s worth of supplies left for both of us. My ammunition stocks were critically low, and my phone couldn’t even get through to the police anymore. Service dipped from erratic, to virtuously non-existent, and I went for days at a time without even trying to upload anything. Cricket had nightmares that dragged her from slumber with cold sweats and terrified screams, and it got to where she couldn’t sleep unless I was somewhere nearby to wake her when the mumbling started.  
Then, came last night.  
I sat in the front pew of the dark sanctuary, staring up at the wooden cross bolted to the wall, my mind a whirlwind of prayer and confused thoughts. Outside, the Lost Ones whispered and scratched, digging their chipped fingernails into the faded wood planks like carpenter bees. It was a cool night, the room chilly, the night sky a deep ebony on the other side of the windows.  
Shutting my eyes, I prayed like I never had before, searching, seeking some message of wisdom. “Why are you doing this Adonai? We have nowhere to go, and soon, nothing to eat. The beasts are too many, and honestly, I’m afraid. We’re trapped. Please, help me see your will in this.”  
I sat there in the murky shadows, waiting for something, anything.  
*My ways are not your ways, my thoughts are not your thoughts, sayeth the Lord.*  
That verse again. How many times had I passed it in the kitchen these many days? Was it just coincidence, a flash of memory, a reflex of my mind? It was so hard to know sometimes if God was speaking to me, or if I was grasping at straws.  
Whop.  
My ears twitched, and I straightened up, cocking my head to one side.  
Whop-whop-whop.  
Inside my chest, my heart began to pound, and I threw myself toward the nearest high-set window. An empty black sky greeted my eyes, tinged by the glow of a pale moon, but just on the other side of the trees, I thought I could see a flicker of white light.  
They exploded from the horizon, four large helicopters winging in over the foliage, their blinding white searchlights flicking on to probe at the ground. All around the church, the Lost Ones screeched and scattered, a few of the Bone-Faced Whitetail darted for cover, and the Firedrakes on the roof took to the sky.  
“Cricket.” I thundered into the parsonage and ran to shake her awake in the spare bedroom. “Get up. Get up, we have to go, come on.”  
She jolted upright, her blonde hair askew, dressed in an old green t-shirt and checkered blue flannel pants. Her eyes winced at the light from the hallway, bleary and half-awake. “What’s wrong?”  
Crack.  
A muffled shot rang out, and somewhere in the darkness, one of the Lost Ones screamed out in pain.  
Blood surged in my temples, and I grabbed her hand to sprint for the front door. “Outside. There are people outside, come on.”  
More gunshots filled the air in sporadic bursts, and I fumbled with the cold padlock on the doors of the sanctuary. We were close, so close to being rescued, to flying out of here and finding a way to fix this mess.  
“Adam,” Cricket stepped back from the door, her golden eyes flashing in uncertainty at the sound of the helicopters touching down just outside the grassy cemetery. “I don’t know about this.”  
But the lock was already undone, and I pushed the door open with my shoulder, grabbing my rifle from beside the doorframe to step into the misty night.  
Two of the aircraft landed, while another two continued to circle overhead, their door-gunners firing salvos of machine gun rounds into the woods around the church. A few dozen riflemen spread out in the ankle-high grass of the cemetery and advanced toward the church, their black rifles raised, with tubular night vision goggles pulled down over their eyes. Like the helicopters, the men were all clad in gray, a flat, slate gray that reminded me of stone, cold and unfeeling. I didn’t see insignia anywhere, no letters, numbers, or patches for a unit. They moved with fluid, confident steps, as if this wasn’t the first time they’d been dropped into a dark, dangerous place, and cleared the surrounding church yard in a matter of minutes.  
One of the lead soldiers pointed to us, and they trotted our way with deliberate strides, their weapons never lowering. Cricket’s hand tightened on mine, and I felt her tremble. She had yet to meet anyone else besides me, and this wasn’t exactly a pleasant way to meet-and-greet.  
“It’s okay.” I squeezed her hand back. “Just let me talk to them.”  
She didn’t reply, merely nodded with her fearful golden irises trained on the soldiers.  
The nearest man stopped a few yards away and lowered his rifle. He swung the night vision goggles on his helmet back and grinned at me with a camouflage-painted face and shiny white teeth that gleamed between his bushy beard hairs like stars. “Hey there. You guys are a sight for sore eyes. We didn’t think there was anyone left on this side of the ridge.”  
*Is it really that bad?*  
I tried to stifle the unease that generated in my guts and smiled back pleasantly. “Good to see you too. We’ve been stuck here for days. You guys with the army?”  
He winked at me, and his eyes travelled to where Cricket had ducked behind me. “Private contracting company, actually. We’re tasked with evacuating civilians from the danger zone. Is she okay?”  
“She’s just really shy.” I didn’t step aside to expose her, as something about the way Cricket gripped the back of my shirt gave me pause. “So do you guys know what’s going on out here?”  
Sighing, the man slung his rifle over one shoulder, and muttered something into his radio mic before turning back to me. “It’s a complicated situation. Mind if we come in? We’ll help you gather your things before we exfil out of here.”  
Stepping to one side, I waved the soldiers in.  
Five minutes later, we sat in the parsonage kitchen, our suitcases at our feet, and passed mugs of fresh coffee to the grateful troops. The man known as Lieutenant Bronson sipped his black-no-sugar across from Cricket and I, his angular face shaded and foreign in the kitchen light.  
“I’ll be honest, I don’t know how you two made it this long.” He chuckled, and stretched to crack his back beneath the bulky plate carrier he wore. “I’ve seen whole squads of guys go out there and get torn up by those things, and they’re not even the worst. Heard rumors from a gunship crew that they spotted something huge on radar, some kind of techno the size of a plane in the north woods. You’re lucky that thing didn’t settle down here.”  
Cricket shifted in her chair and avoided the lieutenant’s piercing gaze, picking at her jeans with a nervous fingernail. She didn’t often get nervous, and I had to admit, it made me a little anxious to see her so on edge.  
I glanced at her out of the corner of my eye but played it cool. “We just laid low, mostly. Couldn’t leave after they slashed my car tires. So, where did all these things come from?”  
Bronson made eye contact with one of the other soldiers around the room and scratched the back of his neck. “Like I said, it’s complicated. A bunch of scientific stuff that’s above my paygrade. From what I’ve been told, it’s basically some form of electro-magnetic radiation that causes cellular life cycles to change. Makes mutants out of normal stuff and creates new things where holes in the environment exist. I figure you’ve seen plenty of that, right?”  
Again, he looked at Cricket, and something about the way he watched her, with a wary, predatory gaze, made my skin crawl.  
*She’s not going to bite you . . . or are you thinking of biting her?*  
I scooted my chair closer to hers and slid my hand under the table to grip Cricket’s, her fingers clammy on mine. “Yeah. We actually made lots of drawings, and notes. If you’d like, we could show them to you.”  
Bronson let slide a broad grin. “If your shy friend here wouldn’t mind grabbing those for us, that would be excellent.”  
Turning to Cricket, I nodded toward the door, and leaned to whisper in her hear. “When you go to get the drawings, count how many soldiers there are. Just so we know, okay?”  
Her face hardened into a knowing, resolute impassiveness, and Cricket rose to slip down the dimly lit hallway.  
“Never did catch your name.” Finished with his coffee, Bronson leaned back in his chair, and I saw some of the former smile fade, the mask falling away to reveal his calculating eyes on me.  
“Adam.” I cleared my throat and tried to find a way to sit that didn’t make me feel surrounded by the heavily armed squad in my kitchen. “Adam Stirling.”  
“And her name?”  
A long, heavy silence fell between us, and I couldn’t look away from the lieutenant’s hard eyes, my pulse roaring.  
*I shouldn’t tell him. Not yet.*  
“Stacy.” It tasted bitter in my mouth, but I spat the lie out, draining the last of my coffee to hide my grimace. “She’s my wife.”  
He raised a dark eyebrow and Bronson drummed his fingers on the table. “Hmm. She’s pretty. Never seen eyes like that though. Solid gold. Kind of strange, don’t you think?”  
Shrugging, I tried to keep my palms dry by rubbing them on my pant legs. “It’s a medical condition. She’s had it since she was born.”  
“Really?” Bronson dropped the friendliness completely and wove both fingers together under his bearded chin. “When was that, precisely?”  
*This guy is really getting on my nerves.*  
“Why?” I narrowed my eyes at him and crossed both arms.  
He cocked his head to one side, and his lips tugged into a smirk. “Careful with that tone, Stirling. After all, we’re your ride out of here.”  
“And if we choose to stay?” The retort left my mouth before I could stop it, my angst getting the better of me. “I appreciate the Seal-Team-Six rescue, but like I said, we’ve been just fine up till now. You’re in my kitchen, Lieutenant. Don’t forget that.”  
Tension clouded the air, thick as mud, and no one sipped their coffee now. Behind their face paint, the men glared at me, and more than one flexed their grip on their weapons.  
*Where is Cricket? How long does it take to get a notepad from the next room?*  
“You know, Stirling, I ran into guys like you a lot when I was just a grunt.” Bronson chuckled, a humorless, warning laugh that sent shivers down my spinal cord. “Big tough talkers, up until the truth hit them in the face. Then they’d show themselves for the lying rats they were. I hate liars, Stirling. Hate them. So . . . you want some truth?”  
I couldn’t tell if it was a threat, a challenge, or an offer. But either way, all I wanted was to find Cricket, and get away from these men as soon as possible. “I want to leave now, please.”  
Oblivious to my demands, the lieutenant leaned across the table, and I could smell the chewing tobacco on his breath. “The truth is, you’re a damned liar. Your wife died last year, in a car wreck. You came here alone. We’ve had a drone watching you, every time you walked through that door. We saw everything.”  
My throat turned bone-dry, and I became acutely aware of how far my antiquated Winchester was from my hands, and how long it would take me to reach where it stood, propped in the corner.  
“What do you want?” I gritted my teeth, doing my best to keep my calm, even as my brain screamed that Cricket had been gone for far too long.  
Bronson didn’t move, only watched me with that snake-like stare that showed no remorse whatsoever. “The truth. We’ve been dealing with the freaks for months now, trying to find a cure. Drugs, kemo, you name it, we tried it. Even exposure to sunlight. Nothing. All dead in minutes. And yet, somehow, you find a way to change one with a garden shed and shovel . . . and she’s thriving.”  
Horror iced through me, and I clawed for something to rescue me, a convincing lie, a bluff, but nothing came. The clock ticked in the background, I could smell the musty coffee pot burning, and outside, the helicopters whirled over head in a deadly, throbbing rhythm.  
A muffled scream cut through the tension from just down the hall, and a thud echoed in the shadows.  
*Cricket.*  
I lunged for the hallway, but hands grabbed me from all sides, and one of the soldiers snatched my Winchester before I could reach for it.  
Someone slammed a fist into my stomach, and all the air rushed from my lungs. I crumpled, my knees buckling, and they pinned both arms behind my back.  
Two more soldiers emerged from down the hall, and between them Cricket writhed, her hair a wild mess, feet kicking at the air, one of her shoes missing.  
“Adam!” Her golden eyes filled with tears, and she thrashed to free her trapped arms, too small to overpower the hulking mercenaries.  
Struggling to stand, I managed to drive my head into the side of the closest man, only to have stars explode before my eyes when my skull hit his steel plate armor. “Get your hands off her!”  
Again, more fists collided with my head, face, and chest, until darkness nibbled at the corners of my vision. Pain rolled through me, I’d never been hit so hard in my life, and red blood dripped from my nose onto the floor.  
“Stop it!” Cricket wailed, her sobs choked and uncontrollable. “Stop it, please! Don’t hurt him!”  
Bronson strode casually, and knelt so his face was level with mine. “I just need a simple answer, Stirling. How? How did you do it?”  
“S-Sunlight.” I coughed, the metallic, coppery blood bubbling over my cracked lip. “The sun it . . . it changed her. I swear.”  
“What did I say about the lying?” The lieutenant shook his head and waved to the men surrounding Cricket. “Hold her down.”  
“No!” I threw myself at him but made it only a few inches before black tactical boots slammed into my ribs in a cascade of misery.  
Cricket flailed, but they dragged her to the floor, and pinned all four limbs. One of the men held her head in place, and Bronson reached into the small pouch on his side to retrieve a strange, silver-colored gun, with two thin metal needles on the end.  
He knelt by her head, and Cricket’s pleading eyes met mine as they pulled her blonde hair back, the tip of the needle pressing against her scalp.  
Lieutenant Bronson pulled the trigger, and Cricket screamed in agony, her eyes screwed shut, every muscle in her body going rigid. An electrical snapping, like that of a tazer hummed, and my vision-tinged red.  
Beep-Beep.  
Withdrawing the gun, Bronson wiped the blood-stained prongs on his pant cuff, and looked down at a little blue screen on the back of the gun.  
His grin brightened, and the lieutenant clicked the black plastic hand mic on his plate carrier. “Base, this is Harvester One-Actual. I’ve got a confirmed Type 6, viable female, condition alpha. I say again, I have a live, viable Type 6.”  
A sniffle came from the floor, and Cricket opened her eyes to fixate one me, rivers of pain swimming down her sweet face. I was helpless, we both were, and I’d never felt more enraged, and humiliated in all my life.  
*“Solid copy Harvester One-Actual, you now have Priority Ultra flight status to the green zone. Secure the specimen, wipe the scene, and move to extract. Base out.”*  
“Neutralize him and raze the building.” Lieutenant Bronson jabbed a finger at me, and the other men hauled Cricket to her feet, the red blood dripping down her neck from the two holes in her pale skin. “We’re wheel’s up in five mikes.”  
*I have to do something. Adonai, please, I have to do something, help me.*  
My mind whirled . . . and an idea clicked into place.  
Letting my eyes slide shut, I sagged, and went limp in my captors’ arms.  
“What did I say?” Bronson scoffed, and his knobby boots scuffed on the hardwood floor to leave. “Tough guys, all of them, right up until the action starts. Let’s go.”  
The soldiers standing over me relaxed, and one of them took his hand off my arm, either to readjust his grip, or scratch at his face.  
*Wrong move loser.*  
I reached back, and my fingers closed over the smooth, textured handle of something stuck in his waist belt.  
Steel flashed in the hallway light, and the man to my left howled as I buried the blade in his face. The one on my right scrabbled to grab his knife away from me, but I drove my elbow back into his chin, and threw myself backward to tumble over him in a clumsy reverse-somersault on the kitchen floor.  
Landing on my face, I crawled back into the fight, too panicked and desperate to think about how bad this would end for me and wrapped my arm around the man’s neck. More of the soldiers ran to help their comrade, guns raised, but my hand found the automatic pistol on the mercenary’s belt, and I jerked it free.  
“Get back.” I pressed the gun to the man’s sweaty temple and thumbed off the safety. “Everyone back, or he’s a dead man.”  
Bronson froze, his face a mask of surprise, and irritation. The men carrying Cricket stopped as well, and Cricket’s wide eyes switched back and forth the between me, and the lieutenant. Somehow, my crazy gamble had paid off, though I hadn’t expected to get this far.  
“Seriously?” Bronson rolled his eyes at me. “That’s your master plan? I’ve got forty guys ringing this place with steel, you won’t get—”  
“Shut up.” I hissed and tightened my grip on the pistol enough that Bronson’s face drained of some color. “Let her go.”  
No one moved, the tense soldier who I held captive looked pleadingly at Bronson, the wounded mercenary at my feet groaned in pain from the knife still embedded in his face, and the radios crackled with muffled voices in the background.  
“Or what?” Bronson’s snide grin returned, and he jerked his head at Cricket. “You shoot him, we shoot you, she still goes with us. You really don’t understand ‘deterrence’ do you?”  
*I’m not letting you take her.*  
“She stays with me.” I growled and pressed the muzzle of the gun to the skin of the soldier I clung to. “I won’t miss, not from this close. Let her go, now.”  
For a moment, we stood there, the mercenary staring into my eyes, while I stared right back. A few weeks ago, holding a soldier at gunpoint would have sounded crazy to me, but now something primal surged in my blood, an animalistic rage that purged me of the reasonable meekness from modern world I’d left behind. This was our home, Cricket belonged with me, and I knew then that I’d rather throw myself mindlessly into machine gun fire than let them cart her off.  
“You know what?” Bronson hissed, and his hand inched for the gun on his belt. “I don’t think I will.”  
My eyes drifted to Cricket one last time, and she stared back at me, her beautiful face tear stained and forlorn. Man, she was pretty, like a bright spring day with cotton-ball clouds and fresh wildflowers. I was going to miss her. I was going to miss a lot of things.  
*I’m sorry.*  
I wanted to say more, wanted her to know so much more about the world, about me, about how I felt about her, but my time was up. The journey ended here, in this hallway, with me spattered over the ground like a dead mosquito. A worthy end, though. A man’s end. One Stacy would have been proud of.  
“Adam.”  
The soft, wavering voice jerked me into the present.  
Cricket’s shut her eyes and breathed in deep. “Run.”  
Her mouth opened, and a low, raspy note came out, building higher and higher.  
It rose into a piercing, eerie screech that bored into my ears with a siren frequency, painful and shrill. In my mind’s eye, I saw again the dirty, white-eyed fiend on the first day staring into the mirror, screaming at her own reflection. Harsh static rushed through my brain, my memories rippled before my eyes, and for a brief second, I saw the drawing Cricket had made on the shed floor, with the strange, towering figure whose head was made of branches.  
Glass shattered. Men cried out in torment. The radios flared with garbled voices.  
I dropped the pistol and clapped both hands over my ears, my skull aching at the sound. But even from beneath my wall of fingers, I still caught the thudding of feet on the grass just outside, the roar of hundreds of throaty calls in unison, and the echoes of gunfire picking up.  
Cricket’s scream cut out, and I blinked to find myself outstretched on the kitchen floor, the world spinning, my head a mess of fog. Bronson and the other soldiers lay slumped in the hallway, either unconscious or dead, I didn’t know. But their radios shouted with panic, the other soldiers outside in total bedlam.  
“Contact, contact in the trees!”  
“They’re everywhere!”  
“Base, this is Echo Three-Five, we’re under heavy attack at sector nine, we need—”  
Snarls cut him off, and the howls of the Lost Ones blazed through the night air in triumph. I could smell the blood on the wind, knew it wasn’t just my broken nose, the shrieks of dying mercenaries accompanied by the awful rending of flesh and snapping of bones like tree branches. Machine gun fire roared overhead, but it didn’t help, as more rabid limbs scuttled over the grass just beyond the kitchen wall, hundreds of mouths eager for the first fresh meat they’d had in days.  
Hands snatched at the cloth of my T-shirt, but I was too weak to fight. They dragged me over the floor, toward the back door of the kitchen, and into the cool, damp, shadows. My vision blurred and all four limbs seemed heavy as lead. But there was something else, something just on the end of my perception, so quiet I almost didn’t notice it.  
Whispers. Whispers echoed everywhere, in the corners of my mind, in the grass under my back, in the thin white mist that hung on the air.  
*Lost, lost, lost.*  
Stiff twigs scratched at my body, and leaves fell around my face. Green closed over me, and I recognized on of the bushes on the side of the parsonage, a small bird’s nest in the limbs just over my head. Gooey Ohio clay squelched under my back, cold against the already soaked shirt I wore, and I smelled churned earth, hot blood, and burned gunpowder.  
A shadow loomed over me in the tiny cavern of the shrub, and I stiffened, waited for the pain, the squared wooden teeth tearing into my flesh.  
Tender fingers slid over my face, probed gently at my bleeding nose and swollen right eye. “Adam? Adam, please say something. Please don’t be dead.”  
*Oh, thank you, Adonai.*  
Her voice broke me, and I choked out a sob. “Cricket? Is that you?”  
“Yes.” She sniffled, her soft golden hair brushing my face, and even in the dark, I could tell she was trying to make a brave smile. “Yes, I’m here.”  
Her fingers wove into mine, and I gripped her hand with all my might. “Did they hurt you? Your head . . .”  
Cricket huddled low over me as if to shield me from the sight of the dozens of feet scuttling by us, her golden eyes almost glowing in the dim light of the stars. “I’m fine. Oh, your poor face . . .”  
“Was never my best feature anyway.” I pulled her close to me, the two of us covered in mud and blood, hidden under the shrubs while the war raged just on the other side of the greenery.  
Fingernails and toenails clawed at the threshold of the kitchen door that stood open. From my hiding place, I fought a wave of nausea at the sound of the men inside awakening to the teeth and claws of the Lost Ones. Bones crunched, flesh tore, blood splattered like a hose, and I had a feeling that I wouldn’t be seeing Lieutenant Bronson again.  
Not in one piece, anyway.  
Overhead, the helicopters soared away, only three left now, and from the hammering of bare fists on metal, I figured the other would never make it into the sky. But my stomach sank, as I realized that we were worse off than before. Our fortress was breached, we were exposed, unarmed, and surrounded by hundreds of the Lost Ones. There was no escape now.  
Closing my eyes, I held Cricket to my chest, breathed in the smell of her hair, and kissed her forehead. “Whatever happens . . . I’m glad you’re here.”  
She clung to me, so tight my bruised ribs ached. “Me too.”  
Loud, horrific screeches sliced through the air, followed by more, in a wave of ethereal misery.  
Something in my head locked onto that sound, and my eyes flew open to meet Cricket’s, her own mouth hanging open in shock. I knew that sound. I’d heard it once before.  
Turning my sore neck, I squinted in surprise.  
A thin tendril of warm yellow light poked through the leaves of the bushes around us. More came, inch by inch, pouring over the sky, and the screams dropped off to eerie silence.  
*Dawn.*  
“Do you think . . ?” Cricket whispered, still shaking in my embrace.  
Swallowing a coppery lump in my throat, I rolled onto my stomach, and pulled myself over the mud. “Stay close to me.”  
Crawling out of that bush, I stepped into the blaze of colors that painted the morning sky, a kaleidoscope of red, orange, pink and yellow. All over the yard, in the tree line, surrounding the tombstones in the cemetery, and heaped up in mounds around the mutilated helicopter were dozens upon dozens of blackened figures, frozen in the moment the sun had caught them in the open. No guns rang out, as gray-uniformed bodies lay scattered and broken, their flesh torn and shredded like blended fruit. The formerly white walls of the church were stained claret red from the slaughter, and spent brass casings littered the green grass.  
*Over. It’s over.*  
“They’re gone.” I turned to gaze deep into Cricket’s beautiful golden eyes. “They’re all gone.”  
A giggle rose in my throat, as it did in hers, and we wrapped our arms around each other, too weak and happy to think. The birds in the trees began their morning song, a few Bone-Faced Whitetail stepped cautiously out onto the green, and a honeybee buzzed past my face. Warmth kissed my skin, and I’d never felt so good, standing in the sunlight.  
Cricket’s breath tickled my neck and sent fire through my blood. “Thank you.”  
“You don’t have to.” I brushed some of her golden hair from her face, relishing the way Cricket tinged pink at my touch. “You belong here. It’s not home without you.”  
She pressed her satin lips to my cheek, and I was suddenly aware of her every curve, how even covered in mud, blood, and leaves, she still looked gorgeous.  
“Adam?”  
“Hmm?” It was my turn to flush with embarrassment, though Cricket didn’t seem to mind my staring.  
She pulled back to search my face, her expression timid, and yet hopeful. “I, um . . . I just . . . I need to know something.”  
“Anything.” I breathed, my heart skipping a beat at the way her hand rested on my chest.  
She swallowed hard, and met my eye, her voice wavering with uncertainty. “Who am I to you?”  
Like it had been touched with a live wire, my heart twitched, and a warmth flooded through me that hadn’t been there in months. In that instant, the words rang through my mind.  
*My ways are not your ways, my thoughts are not your thoughts sayeth the Lord.*  
The soldiers were gone. The Lost Ones were now frozen in their cocoons all around us, ready to break free in several hours’ time. My empty church would be full, almost to bursting, with new people. People who could survive this strange new world, who could sense the animals around them, and avoid the dangers and pitfalls far better than the rest of us. And they would be welcomed here, in God’s house.  
Welcomed as family.  
Peering into her luminescent eyes, I smiled, and allowed myself to feel the one emotion I’d shut out ever since I lost Stacy to that runaway semi-truck.  
“Eve.” I breathed, with all the love in my heart. “Your name is Eve.”
