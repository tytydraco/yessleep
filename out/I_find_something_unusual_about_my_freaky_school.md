My school is a hundred years old, and so are the teachers. Crammed between a literal jungle, this school would give you such vibes, that you wouldn't wanna enter it. Brown, infested looking walls, nailed down by rusty screws and peeled out wood, you could think of it like a rotten brown egg.

And believe me when I say rotten.

This was my second year in the school, and I had never noticed it before, but a highly peculiar scent entered my nose when I went to the boy's washroom in the second floor.

At first, I didn't notice, just thinking that "What else could bathrooms smell of? Flowers?"

But then the scent got stronger. WAY stronger.

I figured out it was coming from the janitor's room and as I closed in, I heard a banging sound.

I jolted, as my head slammed against the mirror near the tap.

I tried inspecting again, as I bend down (while holding my nose) and peered inside.

Which freaked the living soul out of me.

I realized it was a broom that fell, which made the banging sound but what I didn't get is how the heck it made SUCH a loud sound.

I opened the janitor's room, which was strangely open, and looked.

i wish I hadn't.

A skull lied perfectly against the cleaning supplies, and there was something blacky near the rim of the skull, and the broom that had fell, was smashed into hundreds of pieces. Red liquid spilled the grounds.

And that was what I didn't get.

Red liquid?

Was it blood?

I am trembling even  as I am writing this. 

I have, never, ever, encountered something so weird.

So creepy.

Haunted.

Malignant.

There was a chair placed between a mop and on top of it were gloves.

Me-careful not to step on the liquids nor skull- picked up the gloves and examined the skull.

It was half-broken and I accidentally dropped it.

Dropped it due to my trembling, godforsaken hands.

The red liquid was indeed blood, but I don't now why, but it didn't feel human.

Now, don't misunderstand me.

It's not that I go around inspecting human blood, but this just gave me bad vibes.

It was really cold.

Ice cold even.

And it felt almost solid. As if it wasn't liquid, but.....

I don't know.

I don't even know how I can write this.

Then I tried to look at the skull carefully.

Oval shaped, and hollow. Eyes sulky.

For a terrible moment, I even started thinking of who this skull COULD belong to.

And then it clicked.

I realized whose skull this was of.

It was... it was..

  
None other than the...

The janitor.

I was somehow sure. He had the same sulky eyes.

The same oval shaped head.

The same hollow skull.

But then what of the blood?

The inhumane blood?

I don't know what the hell occurred here, but I did know one thing,

SOME dark secret resided in my school, and I needed to find out.

Before it's too late.
