In an ideal world, I wouldn't have to write this entry. I would have happily disappeared and made it out of this toxic environment. That would have been a nicer ending to this story.

Unfortunately, I have to disappoint myself.

It must be said that a few days have passed since I wrote the first post. After throwing away the letter, I left it all behind me. That went well for a while; I stopped going to work and my absence did not result in a smear campaign against me.

It felt strange, I have to be honest, but I enjoyed the peace and quiet.

I missed my deadline for the job, I didn't respond to calls from my superiors, and I just felt free—well, until last weekend, that is.

It started on Saturday evening. I had just finished a long gaming session and eaten a load of greasy fast food, and wanted to crawl into bed at around 1 a.m.

On the way to my bedroom, I was suddenly overcome by an uneasy feeling—as if I were in mortal danger.

For some reason unknown to me, I didn't head for my bed, which would have been waiting for me, warm and cozy, but instead went to my kitchen.

Don't ask me what exactly I was looking for there; I wasn't thirsty, and I certainly wasn't hungry.

As I stood in the doorway, I was overcome by a feeling that was all too familiar.

A cold breath slowly but noticeably crept down my neck.

I stood frozen in my kitchen. Sweat began to run down my forehead, and the cold water of fear that my body was repelling was enough to make me jerk my hand toward the light switch.

I hit it so hard that a pain shot through my hand, like a fracture – the pain made me jump back automatically, it felt like I had jumped through a cold front and my hand was throbbing, but the temperature evened out again and I suddenly felt extremely hot, as if I were boiling.

The cold sweat evaporated, making way for my body's attempt to regulate my feverish temperature with normal sweat.

It took a few moments before I could clear my head and notice the light coming from my kitchen.

The pain in my hand slowly but surely subsided and my body cooled back down to operating temperature, but I still didn't want to enter that damn room.

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. One breath turned into two, and two turned into three.

After the fourth breath, I opened my eyes only to see an old envelope lying on my dining table, one that was all too familiar to me.

My mind went completely blank and my feet started the long journey towards the kitchen table.

I fervently hoped that it was just a bill I had put aside or a letter from my insurance company trying to sell me a new policy.

These hopes vanished into thin air when I glanced at the paper, which looked completely normal to an outsider.

The word “rules” was written in thick red letters on the creased letter.

You only realize how such a harmless word can give you such a shock when you stand there completely stunned, trembling, and disbelieving.

People always try to find a rational explanation for things they cannot explain.

In this situation, I kept telling myself that I must have taken the note with me after all, that I must have accidentally brought it into my house and simply not given it a thought for the past two weeks.

Yes, that must have been it, I had simply forgotten about it. The thought helped, I gradually calmed down and the trembling stopped—I began to replace the feeling of fear with a feeling of relief and breathed out deeply.

The letter found its way back onto my desk after a professional-looking throw, and just as I was about to leave the kitchen, I heard a knock behind me.

It wasn't a normal knock, how should I describe it?

It was an intense knock—almost aggressive, as if someone was about to have a tantrum. But this time I wasn't afraid, I don't know why.

I turned around abruptly and let my gaze wander around the kitchen.

At first glance, I didn't see anything unusual, nor did I on the second glance. Just as I had decided to leave it at the initial shock, I looked at the kitchen table again.

My calendar had been knocked over.

“That must have happened when I threw the letter on the table.”

I said these words truly believing them to be true—I apparently couldn't imagine that what might have happened to Jason was now happening to me.

The calendar was quickly put back in place, and if I had known what I would see, I probably would never have laid my hand on that thing.

“Open the letter. Open the letter. OPEN THE LETTER!”

These words stared at me in dark red letters. In some places, you could see tears that had been caused by pressing down hard. It wasn't just written there this week; my whole damn calendar was full of it.

“Open the letter. Open the letter. OPEN THE LETTER!”

I felt dizzy, so dizzy that I had to sit down in front of the letter and the calendar so that I wouldn't kiss the edge of the table with my head. This state can only be described as a trance, and if anyone from the outside had seen it, they would have declared me insane.

A grown man, completely dazed, staring at a smeared calendar with a battered letter in front of him labeled “Rules.” It sounds surreal, I know, but for me it was stark reality.

“Open the letter. Open the letter. OPEN THE LETTER!”

Fear of death is a feeling I had never experienced before—well, until that moment.

The dizziness intensified, my stomach was working overtime to push my last McDonald's meal back up my esophagus and spread it all over the table.

My legs felt paralyzed and I couldn't move my arms – at least that's how it felt.

I was just a normal representative of a party in the National Council – why the hell was this happening to me? Why were they doing this to me? I left and didn't talk about the rules, how could I? The note was still lying unopened on the table.

With my experience in politics, I should have known that people in a party rarely keep their word.

“Open the letter. Open the letter. OPEN THE LETTER!”

I gave in, not willingly, but I gave up the fight. My fingers closed around the envelope and tore it open. My head screamed loudly that I shouldn't do it, but my body no longer listened. You probably want to know what was in that message, am I right?

Well, here it is:

I was pretty sure that after reading it, I looked like a corpse, and that's how I felt too.

You've probably noticed that I censored the “additional information” or didn't write it down in the first place.

The second page contained detailed information about my parents, my grandparents, and my girlfriend, who lived in another country and whom I had never mentioned at work.

After reading this page, I was on the verge of fainting. Why would these bastards threaten my loved ones? Why did they have all this information?

My gaze wandered over the sheet again. Everything was correct, down to the smallest detail. Place of residence, age, social security number, date of birth, place of work—there was even a mini-biography.

One last sentence caught my eye and knocked me out.

“We know you're still going to do this job, you can't run away. Just like Jason couldn't. Mr. ..., don't do anything stupid.”

I woke up a few hours later. My back ached from the uncomfortable position I had been in at my dining table. I still felt nauseous and was drenched in sweat.

Unfortunately, I didn't get a break from the horror—someone had written something on my table while I was unconscious. In thick black marker, my table read: “Today, Today, TODAY, TODAY, TODAY,” alternating with the following time: “9:37 p.m., 9:37 p.m., 9:37 p.m.”
