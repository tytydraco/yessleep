When I was a kid, I used to walk among the trees in the forest behind my house whenever I got bored, or whenever I felt the urge to, and as a result, I found a large assortment of things, ones that wouldn’t really matter to most people, but to me they did.



Old bottle caps, dirty rings, the type of things you might accidentally step on when hiking through a thoroughly walked trail; as I said, things that wouldn’t warrant a second thought from the average person.



Sometimes I would bring my metal detector out into the forest to aid in my search for, how I saw them, the artifacts of careless people’s dropped pieces of history. 



Now that you understand what I was doing out there, I can give you the rest of the story, although I’m not necessarily sure it’s something you want to hear.



On one of my excursions into the forest, which was exceedingly deep to a young man, I found a small piece of scrap metal with a large ‘N’ carved into it, which excited me, because that just so happened to be the first initial of my name. What was weird though, was the fact that it didn’t seem to be a cutoff point for a larger sign, unless the letters on said sign had been set extreme lengths apart from each other.



As I looked around onto the soft dirt ground, I noticed small shavings of steel spread patternlessly around below my feet, as if the inscription had been made after the hunk of metal had been dropped off in the woods.



Although this would be odd to any individual with critical thinking developed to an at least semi-passable capacity, it wasn’t to me, which can be excused by the fact that I was young, although, there are many times I wish that I had just walked away.



Excitedly, I picked up the sheet of metal, but when I did, I felt a sharp prick in the palm of my hand, and yanked it back suddenly. At first it didn’t hurt, not after the initial shock of the small injury, but when I pulled my hand towards my line of sight only to see blood dripping down from a small, and strangely triangular-shaped wound in my hand, I began to cry.



For some odd reason, I felt compelled to keep the strange sheet of metal with me, so I hucked it up inbetween my arm and my stomach and ran the 2 minutes back to my house.



When I got home I was immediately greeted by my mother, who’s warm expression quickly changed to one of confusion and concern as her eyes shifted from the metal sheet to my teary-eyed face and disturbed demeanor. 



“Jeez, Nate, what happened to you?” She asked, her voice was the comforting type, and it calmed me down a little bit, but didn’t distract me from my bleeding hand. 



I managed to muster up the ability to explain to her what happened without my voice completely breaking again through my tears, and she seemed just as confused as I was when I first found the metal sheet.



“That’s weird, and it didn’t cut you again when you were carrying it back?” she asked, and I gave her a quick nod to say no.



We communicated back and forth for a little while, but eventually the conversation ended, and the metal sheet was tossed in the trash, although I protested against it in hopes I could hang it on my door as a cool decoration.



The next night I was laying in bed, asking myself stupid questions that genuinely seemed reasonable to me, such as; “if I attached a fan to my head and turned it on, would I fly like a helicopter?”.



I continued into my deep philosophical search for another 10 minutes before I heard something strange, a beeping sound was coming from underneath the very blanket I rested under.



I threw my blanket up to try and find the source of the beeping, and was perplexed to see a small red light going on and off inside my hand, just barely visible through the flesh. 



That perplexion quickly turned into terror as I remembered the metal sheet and the strange triangular wound. I raised my hand up to my face and looked at it closer, the red light was small but very noticeable in the dark.



I laid there, sweating lightly and staring intently at my hand which was now beeping red, providing little to no light in the pitch black room I slept in. 



I decided that I would ignore it that night and go to my mom about it in the morning. With the decision made, I threw my blanket back over my body and tried my hardest to sleep, until I heard a burly voice come from beside me.



“Hello, Nathan” it said, and my head snapped to the right to catch a glimpse of the man speaking to me. I stayed silent, and looked at the large figure in front of my eyes. Looking back he was maybe only around 6 foot, but to my young mind he was gigantic.



I started to cry and the man continued to stand over me. “Don’t worry sonny, It’ll all be over soon.” he replied, and placed his hand on the top of my head, which caused me to immediately pull back.



After that, the man just stood there, staring at me as I slept. After a few hours he pulled a small scalpel out of his pocket and made a small incision in my hand, then pulled out a small beeping piece of metal. At this I became so frightened I passed out, my body not knowing what to do in the situation it was presented with.



The next morning I woke up in a daze, confused as to whether or not I had really experienced what had happened to me the night before, but my suspicions were confirmed when I looked at my hand to see stitches running down the top of my backhand, and nearly reaching my wrist bone. 



I walked out of my room to find my mother, but she wasn’t in the house. 



I went to every room and checked it twice, making double sure that my mom wasn’t in them, all the while calling out for her.



Suddenly, as I made my final round to the bathroom, I heard the door that connected my house to my garage swing open. “Mom?” I loudly spoke into the area of the house I heard it in. 



“Yes sweetie, I’m home” she responded.



“Where were you? I was really scared, my hand is-” I spoke but was cut off by my mother’s voice. 



“I know honey, I know, I got it all sorted out, the man who hurt you won’t come back anymore” she said.



“How did you know about-” I was again cut off by my mom.



 “I saw him leaving our house last night, and I called the police to come and get him” she said, and made a nabbing motion with her hands, like a crocodile’s jaw snapping down onto its prey.



I looked over at the stitches on my hand again, and shuttered at the sight of them.



“Thank you mom” I said, and went over to her to get a hug.



The next night I laid again in my bed, my eyes looking over the figures made shapeless by the void of the darkness, trying to connect shapes that I saw to what they were when the lights were on.



As I looked over the dark landscape of my room, I saw a shape I hadn’t seen before the lights disappeared, the figure of a large man, and a sharp object extending from his darkened hand.



I screamed and the figure quickly began to move toward my window, then throwing it open with ease. Just as my mom ran into the room, the man jumped from the window and into the cool night.

  
I wondered if perhaps I deserved this, as a consequence for stealing the man's sheet of iron, I don't know what drove me to think that, perhaps it was just my underdeveloped mind trying to reason with the trauma of an unknown man breaking into my house twice, once to cut me open, and the other to do god knows what.



I never heard or saw anything relating to the strange man again, or at least not up until recently, when I read an article that was printed in a local newspaper.



“MAN TERRORIZES FAMILY” was scrawled across the top of the paper in large black letters.



 “In Hathaway  just this evening, a man was arrested after the prolonged stalking of a family of four that lived peacefully in the town. The man has been identified as 'John \*\*\*\* Jr'. and during a recent court meeting, it was revealed that he had been accused of, and successfully convicted of stalking in the past, but had escaped the small county prison he was held in within the first night of being kept there.” the article read.



I gazed at the article for just a few more moments before I put it down onto my coffee table, and walked away, letting it slip my mind once again.



Just a few days ago an article appeared on my phone notifications, a recommendation from a service I had been meaning to cancel my subscription for. “Missing boy linked to missing convicted stalker from Jabbot county” It read, and to the side of the text was a full quality (although now more aged) picture of the face of the man who I had only seen from the limited visibility of a dark room illuminated very dimly by the moon when I was just a child.
