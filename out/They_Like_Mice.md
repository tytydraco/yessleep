My house has been in my family for generations. 

It’s an 80 by 100 foot monstrosity with more windows than I can count. 

My family has always had a strict no maid policy, so I clean everything myself—but I don’t really mind. I put on a pair of headphones and just listen to music or a podcast while I scrub down counters and dust bookshelves. 

Luckily, I work from home, so I don’t have to go out often. I live in rural Pennsylvania, making online websites for startup companies and whatnot—nothing crazy. 

I can pick my hours and spend most of my time making the house happy. 

I inherited it just a few months ago from my mom. 

Don’t worry, she’s still alive, just getting too old to take care of 24,000 square feet all by herself. Hell, I’m a 26 year old man and still find myself struggling at points, so I’m honestly impressed with how long she was able to do this alone. 

Anyway, after she passed it on to me like my Poppy did for her, I started the chores right away. 

I didn’t need a list or anything. I visited my Poppy a lot when I was little and my mom when I got older, watching them do the chores. They’d show me how they were done and when so I could be ready for the day it became my turn. 

So far, everything has been running pretty smoothly. 

I get the box of mice on Saturday. 

Sunday, I clean the first floor. 

Monday, the second. 

Tuesday, I work on my computer. 

Wednesday, the third. 

Thursday, I rest. 

And of course, I feed and care for the mice throughout the week.

Friday is probably the hardest day, honestly. 

On Friday mornings, the walls will be really hot to the touch and I will have to wear closed-toe shoes all day to avoid burning my feet. Sometimes, the walls will even take on a fleshy-like texture. It reminds me of skin if skin didn’t grow with the body, instead pulled tight, right on the precipice of tearing. 

It will also pulse every couple of seconds. The pulses aren’t like a heart beat though, more like repeating contractions if you can picture that. I imagine it’s a bit like what a womb looks like when it goes into labor.

Still, the worst part about Fridays by far is when I have to use the restroom anytime between the later hours of 3 and 6:30pm. 

I’ll walk into one of the hundreds of bathrooms in the mansion to take a piss, only to be greeted by row after row of eyes of all different shapes and colors staring at me. Some are obviously human, but others will look more like the eyes of goats, dogs, cats, or horses depending on the month. They all blink at different times, so I know there’s always at least a couple still looking at me at every moment. It scared the shit out of me when I was a kid, but I’ve grown used to the sight since then. 

Now, I just find it sort of humiliating. I try to go to the bathroom at the closest gas station two miles out if I can help it, but when it’s an emergency, I’ll just suck it up and go in the house. 

The way those eyes all stare at me, like they are judging me, might be only one step below public shaming. 

7:00pm is the most important time of the day on Fridays. 

I’ll usually try to eat an early dinner or make it a cheat day to avoid anything conflicting with meeting the timeframe. 

At 6:45pm, I go to my bedroom to get the box of mice. 

There’s usually about 15 to 20 in there, most of them being field mice. 

I swear, it’s like they know what’s going to happen when I pick up the box. They all start squeaking and trying to gnaw through their little prison, but of course, they can’t escape. They are as stuck in that box as much as my family is the house. I feel a bit bad for them, but my Poppy always told me it’s better to just accept it. 

The house is pretty big, so it takes a good ten minutes to zigzag through the halls to get to the door of the attic. The other five minutes are spent just trying to convince myself to go up there. 

I don’t mean I’m scared of the attic—I’ve long since outgrown that. 

It’s the smell. 

The first thing that hits me whenever I open that door is the most godawful stench I’ve ever had the displeasure of smelling.

The closest thing I can compare it to is the smell of a dead animal carcass that’s been left to rot in extreme humidity for days on end, except imagine that times ten. 

My mom used to say every time without fail whenever she opened it, “Yup, still absolutely horrendous!”

I would get a nose plug or something, but then I’ll have to breathe through my mouth and I don’t want to chance tasting that vile odor. 

I know it sounds stupid, but after I try my best to psyche myself up for a couple minutes, I’ll do a little countdown. 

“3….2….1” 

Then I’ll take a deep breath and dead-sprint up the stairs, while simultaneously gagging on the smell. 

My mom used to actually lock me in there as a kid and have me sit on the first couple steps in the pitch black when I did something bad. The longest she ever left me in there for was about two hours when I was 6. She’d gotten a call home from my school about me disrupting a lesson multiple times, starting an argument about god knows what, and speaking out of turn. My mother was furious about it, calling me “an embarrassment,” so she left me on the stairs of the attic. 

I love her to death and all, but she’s always been way too sensitive about how other people see her. Everything I did wrong or right, she would immediately view as a reflection of herself. 

My eyes were stinging by the time she unlocked the door that day and my voice was hoarse from the relentless sobbing and begging to be let out. I’d hated the smell then too, but that’s also back when I was still afraid of the attic. She knew how much it terrified me.

“It’s for your own good, sweetheart. You’ll see.” 

She was right. What she did really was just her way of getting me used to what would one day be my every Friday night. 

Anyway, as I was saying, I’ll dead-sprint up the stairs. 

There are quite the number of stairs to the attic, so it’s no short run. My Poppy says he won all those medals in running because of constantly running up and down the attic stairs. It’s certainly a workout. They don’t spiral or anything—thank god—they just go straight up. 

There’s no light switch for the stairs, so I either use a flashlight or the flashlight feature on my phone to see where I’m going. 

Thankfully, at the very top of the flight, there is a switch on the wall for the room. And when I turn it on, I’m always greeted by a relatively bare room, aside from a few trash bags stuffed in the corner and, of course, the huge, fat pair of dark red lips that sit right where a fireplace should be. 

The lips are typically chapped and cracked, probably dry from the humidity of the attic, about 8 feet tall and 12 feet in width, nearly reaching the ceiling and crushing the walls on either side of them. On the floor below the lips and through most of the attic are sticky wet fluids that make a gross squelching noise against my shoes whenever I take a step, the liquid all coming from the lips’ persistent drooling and spitting. 

When they sense my presence, the lips will excitedly start to smack together and pant, drooling a flood worth of more spit onto the ground around me. 

I’ll slowly approach, the lips getting more and more excited the closer I get. The spit from their blubbering of joy will sometimes even hit me in the face and I’ll have to try my best to wipe away the big gooey glob of mucus from my eyes and mouth without throwing up. It’s always warm—almost hot—and putrid, the terrible smell that fills the attic obviously coming from their mouth. 

When I’m within arms reach of the lips, I’ll stick my hand out. 

The lips will then open only slightly to reveal their mouth. 

They don’t have any teeth, just gums, but the nerves that would be in a tooth remain, hanging down and wiggling a little from the gaping holes in their mouth. 

The tongue will slither out, long and wet, and taste my hand, lapping at it like a dog if a dog’s tongue was bigger than a human body.

That’s how they make sure it’s me. 

They have no eyes up here, so they rely on their tastebuds for clarification. 

Once they have fully lathered my hand in their saliva, they will give out a pleasured cry. It sounds kind of like a fox’s cry, but deeper and wetter. 

That’s my sign to open the box full of mice, who are by that point, freaking out. 

The lips will open their mouth fully, revealing the gaping maw of darkness that awaits at the back of their throat, the drool still dripping out. 

Without hesitation, I’ll unceremoniously dump all of the squeaking, crying mice into their mouth, the little creatures pathetically getting stuck in the globs of mucus in the lips’ mouth, rendering them unable to free themselves from the warm damp cavern that is soon to be their grave. 

Once all of the mice are writhing on their tongue, the lips will smack shut, before a resounding gulp runs through the house, shaking it a bit, signifying they have swallowed their meal. 

They will usually lick their lips excessively after that, as if searching for any mouse that they missed, before settling down to what I presume is digest. 

When that’s all over, I’ll turn around and leave, running back down the stairs and shutting the door behind me, always relieved to be drinking back in fresh, clean air. 

By the next morning, the house is pretty much back to normal. The walls are cool to the touch again, the floor isn’t a furnace, and my bathrooms don’t have peeping toms lining the tiles. 

At 4pm on Saturday, I’ll get the next delivery of mice.

Then my week starts again. 

It’s not all too bad. It’s just about getting used to the work like an 18-year-old gets used to being an adult. It’s just a transition from watching the work being done by someone else, to doing it yourself. 

Really, the only trouble I find happening repeatedly is when the mice don’t get delivered on time due to weather, a package mix-up, or whatever else. 

Those Fridays are the only times the house manages to still scare me. 

The lips don’t like not being fed on time. 

But, I won’t bore you with my complaining unless you really want to hear about it. I don’t want to give off the impression that I am not thankful for my house or that my job is harder than some people out there who probably really struggle. I just get a bit tired sometimes. 

Also, if anyone knows a good place or company to buy mice from, please let me know. I try to vary the companies I order from to see which one the lips like best. 

**They really like mice.**
