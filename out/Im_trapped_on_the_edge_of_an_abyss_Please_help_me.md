This is a last-ditch effort. I’ve tried calling, messaging, and even emailing from every app on my phone, but I can’t get a message out anywhere. I have barely any service and while my device does say that I have internet, it’s on the lowest rung. I’m praying that this is the one that will finally go through.

Three days ago, I think I went missing. I say ‘I think’ because honestly, I’m not sure  what’s going on. I had been driving alone around the country for a few weeks on a sort of road trip; no contact or communication with anyone, and I’ve lost my way. Because of this, nobody I know has any clue where I am. Neither do I. The last major road I remember driving was a highway along the Pacific coast. I don’t know how far I got from it before I went missing, though. It could be miles or whole days worth of driving. I was in a tired haze by then, and time seems to all blur together when I look back on it.

I’m sorry; you’d think after typing 15 of these messages out, I’d have my story in order, but I still don’t know how to put what’s happening into words. I think it’d be best if I just start from the beginning.

In a bleary haze as I cruised down the dark, winding asphalt, my first memory was wondering why there was a traffic cam so far out in the middle of nowhere. The familiar flash as it clicked a photo of my plates split the dark night air, giving my brain focus and clarity again. Though I was frustrated at the impending fine now waiting for me back home, the event quickly faded from memory. I just slowed my speed with a sigh, focusing back on the road. It was easy to slip and get lost to its infinite draw, especially after so long of being acquainted with it. As I said earlier, I’d been on this little excursion of mine for two weeks now, and most of it had been spent driving.

I wasn’t out to sightsee, though I had made that excuse upon leaving. No, this was more of a grossly exaggerated night drive. The kind you take when you’re stressed and can’t sleep at the early AM. You can probably tell how stressed I was if mine was still going 14 days later. Things weren’t great back home, and had become a quickly growing dumpster fire of events that only fueled one another.

I guess that part isn’t important…

What *is* is that I’d made it a point to not contact anyone back there. Whenever I’d stop at a motel or cheap inn for a night, I’d be certain to not check my phone, and to keep it on ‘do not disturb’ the whole time. I knew nobody would report me missing—they knew I was going away—and I knew that if they tried to call and didn’t get an answer, they’d understand why.

Looking back now, it was all such a stupid game for me to play. I wish I would have checked at least one time along the way. Just gotten over my pride and turned my phone back on for one hour, if not just to hear a familiar voice one last time. Maybe then I would have been tempted to go back home. Maybe then I wouldn’t be where I am now.

It began a foggy amount of time after the traffic cam. I was on a road flanked by dense, old growth sequoias that smothered the night sky from view with their looming branches. The asphalt looked as aged as the forest itself, the thin, dotted yellow line between its two halves barely visible anymore. Eventually, it opened up from the woods, and I found myself on a path running along an ocean cliff side, my car humming faithfully at the top. I let my gaze fall out to the black abyss beside me, the ocean and the sky stitched together by the dark. It must have gotten cloudy while I had been in the forest, as there were no more stars or moon that I could see above. No meager, pale light from their flicker. Only my headlights guided me along the path ahead, and even they gave in quickly to the encroaching void.

It was roads like these during my travels that always unsettled me. Even in most stretches of country just outside of metros, the light pollution helps us forget just how dark the night can be without civilization. So dark that you can’t see more than a couple dozen yards ahead, even with a couple of searchlights strapped to the hood.

It was these roads that would jar me from my highway induced stupor. I always worried that something might be ahead. Some sort of bend in the road I might not see in time. An animal that’s eyes would catch off my headlights too late. Or, there was always that somewhat childish notion that there might be something unknown out there. Something that only lurks in these spaces where humanity dare not dwell anymore. It may have been the one that I let myself think about the least, but no matter how brave you are, those thoughts are always there, hiding in the back parts of your brain, making you jump at the weird shadows the trees create.

I think if I had known then what I know now, I might not have considered the notion so childish.

A wave of relief washed over me as the road rounded a bend, and I saw the gentle twinkle of civilization dusting the horizon. The road descended along the cliff side to a plateau tucked away in the bluff; a town built on a shelf between the towering cliff face and a sheer drop to the ocean below. That may sound like a precarious description, but on first glance, it looked positively cozy. It was a small place; I could clearly take in the whole thing at once as I rolled toward it. From what I could make out, it looked like most of the major buildings were built along the road I was on, with about a mile of other businesses and homes out in either direction.

Where the cliff began to move inward and where the plateau began to jut out, there was a bridge that connected the two over a chasm. I rolled over the feat of concrete and steel, relieved to see that it was rather new and solid, keeping me safe from plummeting who knows how many feet into the sharp ocean rocks below. Judging from the symmetry of the place, I figured that there must be another bridge on the far side of town leading back up the cliff side and back to the woods above. Before I simply plowed through, however, I needed to stop for a fill up.

Checking my gas gauge and the current time, I found that both were bad news. My gas was just below a quarter tank, which, while not terrible, was certainly not enough to get me back through the wilderness to civilization. That was why the time was such bad news. It was currently 2 in the morning, and I knew that not all gas stations were open 24 hours, especially out in small backwater towns like this.

Doing a quick scan through the forest of buildings I now found myself in, I could see that most places were closed, their lights off and windows a black reflection of my car is it glided past. The only illumination came from the old, amber streetlights that silently directed me down the road like a landing strip, requesting I kindly depart. I ignored their request, however, as my eyes finally landed on what I was looking for, a gas station. To my relief, the sign and canopy lights were still on, as well as the interior store. Slowly, I rolled into the lot.

I’d gotten pretty good at almost pit-stop level gas fill ups by this point, always wanting to get back on the road as soon as possible. I already had my card yanked from my bag as I hopped out of my car and rounded it to the machine, but was stopped in my tracks as I went to insert it. The tiny screen on the machine read ‘*This pump has been stopped*.’

Biting my cheek, I pressed a few of the buttons on it, hoping to wake it up. Then cursed under my breath as I realized that the pumps were turned off for the night, and I’d have to go ask the attendant to turn them back on. With a sigh, I started for the entrance.

I gave a scan to the town as I moved, taking it in myself now that the barrier of the windshield was gone. It was a nice place all things considered, especially given some of the small towns I’d been to so far in my travels. Most were run down and dusty looking places, but this one was very clean and quaint. The equipment and buildings were old, but clearly kept up to date and in good repair, little planters of flowers hanging from streetlight hooks and storefront windows.

I entered the building to an electric chime overhead, then turned to the counter. There was nobody standing there, so I stood on my toes and did a pour over the aisles. When I still didn’t see anyone present, I listened quietly for a moment before calling out, “Hello?”

Nothing. No noise save for the gentle hum of a drink machine harmonizing with the freezer doors. Furrowing my brow, I waited for a few minutes before moving up an aisle toward the back, calling once again, “Hello?”

Still no answer. I moved for the employee door that was left open, then gingerly peeked inside. The light was off and nobody was in there. It was just a room with a computer, a mess of papers, and a table with a few chairs.

Deciding that they must be in the bathroom, I moved back to the front of the store, grabbing some snacks as I went. Seeing the shiny foil bags of junk food suddenly reminded me how hungry I was, and it had been a while since I’d made myself eat. I lay them on the counter, then leaned against it as I waited, staring out the window at the town. I zoned out for a bit, but eventually, enough time passed for my brain to alert me that something was wrong. If the clerk was in the bathroom, then they were seriously having some issues.

I called out again as I moved for the restroom to no avail, then when I reached it, I pressed my ear close and knocked, “Hello? Is anyone in there?”

No answer.

Reaching for the handle, I pressed it down then pushed the door open, surprised to see that here too, the room was vacant and the lights were off.

“What the hell…” I muttered to myself, stepping back and letting the door shut. Moving toward the front, I did one more glance through the windows to see if maybe I’d missed the attendant doing something outside, but that wasn’t the case. In fact, there wasn’t any signs of life at all out there. Just street lights and buildings.

I stood there for a moment, chewing my cheek and wondering what to do. It was strange that a place would be left open like this in the middle of the night with all its goods free game, but then I posited that maybe it was just normal for this town. It was weird, but then again, how many people really came out this way? I’d been driving for over an hour without seeing any signs of civilization, so obviously this town was fairly self sustained. Maybe they just operated on an honor system, knowing that if they were stolen from, it was most likely someone in the town that did it. It was either that, or some poor teenager who was supposed to be working the night shift snuck off thinking nobody would notice. Regardless, I needed gas, and so I did something that I normally wouldn’t do.

Walking behind the counter, I scanned the attendant area until I found what I was looking for; a small electronic board was resting in a cubby labeled ‘*pump 1, pump 2, pump 3—’.*

I glanced out the window to check my pump, then flicked the corresponding switch and walked back outside, tossing a few dollars on the counter for the chips in my hand. Once back to my car, I lifted the nozzle and began fueling. The glug of the hose filled the still space around me, and I resumed my vacant stare into the distance as I waited for it to finish. It was during this time, however, that something caught my attention.

It was *only* the machine making noise. The entire town was dead silent save for the gas pump. No birds. No nighttime insects chirping or frogs. No anything.

Intrigued, I clicked the latch on the handle and stepped away, moving out closer to the road. Sure enough, the phenomenon didn’t change. Still quiet as ever. The strange thing was the lack of even any wind. On the edge of a cliff side near the ocean, there should have at least been an audible breeze rustling the flora or making the old buildings around me shudder, but there wasn’t even that.

And speaking of the ocean, why couldn’t I hear that either? This was a town suspended on a plateau above the sea; even from so far away, I should have been able to hear at least some sort of ambience from it beating against the rocks below. There was nothing, though. No dogs barking, no late night cars rolling around the back roads of town.

Just. Pure. Silence.

The click of the pump stopping made me jump, so lost in my thoughts. I had a horribly unsettling feeling nesting in my gut. That feeling from driving on the dark road was back; the horrible sensation of the unknown—and suddenly this town didn’t feel so cozy and comforting anymore. It felt just as wild and foreboding as the forest looking down at me from high above the cliffs. I hastily jammed the nozzle back into its holster and finished paying while trying to resist the urge to glance over my shoulder the whole time.

When I was done, I rounded back to the driver's seat and climbed inside, jamming my key into the ignition and peeling out of the lot. Maybe it was just sleep deprivation or stress or any other myriad of things that was inspiring my paranoia, but I didn’t want to be in this town any longer than I needed to be. As I went, my eyes traced along the sides of buildings, hoping to see anyone inside of them or any signs of life to set my mind at ease, but I never got that validation before the end of town came into view.

I sped up a little more at seeing the city end, knowing that I was on the homestretch to book it out of here, but as I drew closer, I let out a gasp and hit hard on my brakes. I had been watching the beams of my headlights scrape along the asphalt as I went, rolling over the surface until suddenly there was no more asphalt to land on. Ahead, the road just stopped. An abrupt dead end right at the edge of the cliff.

“What… what the hell?” I said out loud, my heart pounding heavy in my chest as I eyed the chasm ahead. I had been wrong; there was no bridge on this side like there had been at the entrance into town, and if I hadn’t caught that fact, I’d have been careening into a dark, murky abyss at that moment. Swallowing the lump in my throat, I cranked the gear into reverse, then quickly backed away from the ledge, turning my car as I did so to face the other way. Without hesitation, I started back toward the entrance.

I couldn’t believe that. Why on earth would they just have a road that blatantly ended in a cliff? Were these people stupid? Why wouldn’t they at least have car stops or concrete barriers or something that might stop somebody from driving straight off a cliff? Sure, maybe they lived here and knew it was there, but the road was open to anyone, and *they* wouldn’t know.

Unless… oh God, was that what this place was? Some sort of highway robbery scheme? Get people to accidentally drive off a cliff so they can loot their belongings below? The thought was absurd, but like I said, I was tired and paranoid at this point, and I had no other logical explanation. It only got worse when I reached the far side of town once more.

“What?” I mumbled out, breathlessly, “No… No, no, no!”

My car came to a halt again, as in front of me, where there had once been a mighty bridge leading into town, there was nothing.

The road fell away as abruptly as it had on the far side of town. All of that steel and concrete that had made up the very real bridge that I had taken to get over here had just vanished into thin air. I knew for certain it hadn’t been a raising bridge or anything like that either; it was built right into the side of the mountain.

This time, I got out of my car. I needed to know what was going on. Leaving it running for the light of my headlights, I moved for the drop slowly, my brain too in disbelief to understand what I was looking at. What I must have not noticed about the other bridge was that there *had* been one here. I wasn’t crazy. I could see bits of rebar and metal sticking out from the edge of the chasm that had once supported it, but they were all that remained, and it certainly wasn’t enough to span the 80 foot chasm back to the road on the other side.

I swallowed hard in a panic, trying to sort the puzzle out in my head. There’s no way it fell as soon as I went through; I would have heard it. And besides, it was almost too clean to have fallen away. It looked as if a giant had come and ripped the bridge free, then carried it off into the night. And speaking of sound, that’s when the fear that began all of this returned.

Cautiously, I stepped toward the edge of the ledge where the road bowed downward before stopping, peering toward the blackness below. There was no noise.

The ocean should have been directly below me—couldn’t have been more than 100 feet down—but there was nothing. I couldn’t hear it, I couldn’t see it, it was just pure darkness. I turned my head out to where the rest of the sea would have been, but that too was just an abyss. It curled all the way above the horizon and covered the sky, nothing but nothing for as far as the eye could see.

Realizing I’d forgotten how to breathe, I took a few shaky ones and ran a hand through my hair. I looked at a nearby piece of rebar with a chunk of asphalt resting on it and fell to my knees, taking it in my hands. Holding it over the ledge, I dropped it, watching the black chunk of rock disappear quickly into the dark. I dropped to my chest and stuck my whole head over the shelf, listening hard for when it hit the ground. It should have been easy to hear with how quiet everything was, but I never heard anything at all.

Standing to my feet, I backed slowly away until an idea hit me. In utter denial of what was going on, I stomped over to my car and popped the trunk, digging around inside. My boyfriend, Trevor, had bought me a road flare kit a while back in case I was ever in an accident and needed to flag for help. Now was as good a time as any to use one.

Yanking the cap off and dragging it against the top of the stick, it burst forth with a sinister red glow. I walked back to the edge of the road then swallowed hard, hanging it over the nothingness as I let the light fall onto my face. My fingers unlaced, and I watched the stick plummet down past the road.

With each passing moment, my logical brain told me that it should connect with the ground any second, but I was hit with nausea and utter dread as I watched it fall and fall and fall.

5 seconds. Then 10. Then 20. Then finally, it got so small that I couldn’t even see it anymore.

I backed away from the ledge fast this time, my breathing slowly going from a low thrum to a panicked, rapid beat. I turned and booked it back to my car, climbing inside and turning around once more. In denial mode, I began to head for the side of town backed by the cliff.

I knew that there’d only be two ways in and out of this place. One side was flanked by the ocean and the other was a thousand foot tall wall of rock. Still, I thought maybe there might be a tunnel somewhere. Another escape that might lead off this godforsaken shelf. As I cruised any road I could find along the cliff face, however, I had no such luck. There was nothing; just unlit houses and empty parks.

The whole time I drove I kept an eye out for anyone, but that hunt was still moot as well. This was a ghost town, almost like a toy set. It looked real and had all the features and functions of an actual living space, but really it was just a hollow husk. I think I’d traveled it all before I finally gave up and buried my head into my steering wheel.

What the hell was happening? This couldn’t be real—it all felt just like a bad dream. This was exactly the kind of thing that would happen in a nightmare. Still, I knew I wasn’t dreaming. The sickness in my stomach was too real, and the headache pounding in my skull too raw. I let out a frustrated cry of anger before pounding my hands against the horn then stepping outside.

“Hello!?” I screamed at the top of my lungs, “Is anyone there!? I-I need help!”

A mocking silence answered me.

“Hello!” I cried again, “This shit isn’t funny! Is this some big joke!?”

Nothing but my own echo returned.

Angrily and in desperation, I stormed over to a nearby house and pounded on the door, “Hello? Please, somebody answer me!”

If anyone was home, they weren’t going to answer. That was okay though, because I was so scared, I was willing to try everyone in town.

Leaving my car, I began going door to door, pounding on each one and calling out like an absolute madwoman. I just needed somebody—anybody to answer. I needed something normal to happen or something familiar to show me that I wasn’t losing my mind. After the first three blocks of no answers, I said screw it and checked the knob of the next house to find it unlocked.

I stepped inside the dark residence, trespassing be damned, and turned the lights on. What I found was a fully furnished home complete with pictures of a family and everything, but absolutely nobody inside. I moved on to the next one and did the same thing to the same results. Then the next one, and the next one. There was nobody here. Nobody at all in this whole town, and now I was trapped in it, all by myself, and with nobody knowing where I was.

I had combed through nearly a quarter of the whole area when something else dawned on me. I checked my phone to see that it was 8am now. The sun should have been up hours ago, but it was still nowhere in sight. The abyss I was surrounded by, it really was everywhere. It wasn’t until then, with my device in my hand, that I even considered using it. I think it was a combination of not doing so for so long and sheer panic that had prevented me from considering it. That’s when I learned I still had a few bars.

Thanking the heavens, I turned it off ‘do not disturb’ to find that I had a slew of texts and missed calls, as well as several voicemails, all of them from Trevor and my Dad. In the heat of the moment, I teared up a bit at how neglectful I’d been, then quickly went to the keypad, dialing 911. I placed the phone to my ear, but was surprised to hear the call drop immediately.

“What?” I said, pulling the device away from my ear to give it a chastising look. I immediately tried again, but to the same results. Muttering pleas under my breath, I went to my contacts and tried Trevor. Same effect. Just the dull beeping sound letting me know that the call was denied before getting booted back to the menu. I think I sat there nearly an hour, trying everyone in my contacts while standing on furniture and running through the streets. None of it helped.

Finally, I broke.

I tossed my phone in frustration onto the front lawn of a house, then collapsed next to it on my knees, burying my face in my hands. Confined in my mental shell, I scrunched my eyes shut tight and breathed softly, trying desperately to not panic. There had to be something I could do. Some way that I could get out of this place or get help.

My palms fell away to my lap, but I kept my eyes closed as I let my head back and took one last inhale of eternal night air. I was nearly ready to get back up and keep searching, but then I noticed something. The light on the back of my eyelids was growing dimmer. I snapped my lids open just in time to see the streetlights above me dulling. In a panic, I jumped to my feet, and stared up at them, my heart pounding in my chest.

“No… no, please,” I begged softly. I couldn’t lose the light too. I couldn’t lose the one last thing that was keeping my fear at bay. My pleas fell on inanimate ears, however, and once the light was nothing more than orange, tangled lines within its bulb, there was a small *pop!* and they went dark for good.

I whipped my head down the road to the houses I’d been in earlier, hoping to see the lights I’d turned on spilling into the street. There was no such luck, however.

Like a starving animal, I pounced for my phone once more, fishing around in the pitch darkness for its saving grace. After a few moments of tearing up the grass, my fingers felt its hard shell, and I snatched it up then turned on the flashlight, slicing through the encroaching void.

It's a strange feeling to know you’re outside and to see a suburban environment, but for the space to be dead silence and devoid of even a shrivel of light. I’ve heard stories of people who go cave diving saying that when you turn your flashlight off, it’s a darkness unlike anything you can possibly imagine unless you’ve seen it yourself. I think I can confidently say, I’m a part of that club now. The small LED from my phone was only able to carve a path through the abyss maybe 10 feet or so at most, and the last 5 of those were nothing more than a dull white glow.

If I had been scared before, my terror was crippling now. It took every bit of willpower to make my legs move toward the unknown that lay ahead with every step. I needed to get back to my car. The headlights would bring back more of the world than the tiny brick in my hand could.

The walk back to my vehicle felt like miles as I shuffled one foot before the other, the gentle echo of the steps and the blood pounding in my ears as my only company. In the shaking light from my hands, my brain began to turn on me. Every shadow at the tips of the beam became a lurking figure. Every echo that bounced back was a second set of steps following me. Eventually, the dread overwhelmed me so much that I began to move faster. Then faster. Then faster and faster until I was in a dead sprint. I’d never been so thankful to see my car in my life when it finally came into view.

I nearly ripped the door off its hinges and climbed inside, cranking my key and sparking the engine to life. The road ahead illuminated before me and my heart gave one final lurch with the fear that something might be there. When I saw there wasn’t, I breathed a sigh and started to roll forward.

I just needed to move. If I kept moving, nothing that might be hiding in the dark could catch up with me.

For a while, I rolled around the streets that I was quickly becoming acquainted with when I hit the main road once again. The wider spread street lit by my high beams brought a little more relief to my chest, being able to take more in at once, but then I noticed another unsettling thing. Was… the street getting dirtier?

There were newspapers and shop posters blown about the gutters, trash and wrappers littering the sidewalks, and business windows looked grimy and water-stained as my lights flashed passed them. Even the sleeker gas station that I’d stopped at was now a rundown mess, one of the windows smashed and laying in pieces on the ground. The weird part was that it looked like it’d been this way for years.

I was still freaked out, but being back in my vehicle had steadied my nerves a bit. I poured over the scene before me, trying to squeeze it in with my mismatched collection of clues so far when my eyes caught something down the road. Another source of light spilling onto the asphalt. Curious, I began moving toward it, and when I arrived, it wasn’t what I was expecting.

The luminance was coming from two vending machines beneath a motel balcony, one for dirnks and one for snacks. Unlike the rest of the town which had gone to hell, the two machines were still in perfect condition, the candy bars and chips within shining proudly. The sight reminded me of how hungry I currently was, and though I didn’t exactly feel like eating with how nauseous I was, I reached to my passenger seat and forced myself to pop open the chips I’d gotten from the station earlier.

I eyed the vending machines as I crunched them down, trying to gauge what was so special about the devices that made them immune to the power outage and decay. I couldn’t figure it out by the time I was done with my chips, and I knew that if I wanted answers, I was going to need to do something that I really didn’t want to.

“It’s okay, Hensley,” I told myself with a deep breath as I grabbed my phone and popped the car door.

Figuring out this power situation was a must. Looking at my phone, I still had bars, which meant somewhere, there was a tower still on. If I could figure out where it was, I might be able to get more, then successfully call for help.

My steps were cautious as I moved toward the glowing boxes. I wasn’t going to be too trusting with the conspicuous miracle machines that were lit like beacons on this horrible night. They didn’t seem malicious, though. The closer I got, the more I was certain that I was simply looking at two completely normal motel vending machines. What did catch my eye, however, was the ground leading up to them.

There was a ring of clean. In a perfect circle of about 10 feet, there was no filth or grime, just like the town had been when I entered. Hell, it looked like there was even a magazine that had landed along the line, and it was perfectly sliced down the middle, as if a really sharp broom had just swept it all away. Scrutinizing the border, I snapped a hair tie loose from my wrist, then tossed it over the line, just to be sure. Harmlessly, it pattered on the clean side, waiting patiently for me to come pick it up again. I very slowly did so.

My gaze drew back up to the vending machines, now close enough to see my reflection, and I furrowed my brow in confusion. Moving to the side, I tried to peek behind the back to see how they were plugged in, but they looked to be fixed to the wall by some brackets.

Instead, I turned to look around the rest of the motel courtyard, trying to scope out anything that might give me a lead. There obviously wasn’t much given that my flashlight could barely clear the cleanly ring, and the only other thing I could see was my car back on the road, waiting patiently for my return on its own little island of light. At least, until I looked up.

There was one other bit of light that I could see that I must have not noticed among the suffocation of buildings. Above one of the larger ones just behind the gas station, there was a single red shine like a star, proudly piercing through the abyssal sky. Its ghastly red glow didn’t illuminate much, but it did shine on the metal beams supporting it. A radio or cell tower of some kind. That would explain where my phone service was coming from.

Deciding that the vending machines were a mystery for another day, I set my heading for the station and turned back to my car, ready to start for it. I immediately froze after my first step, and my blood ran cold.

“Um, excuse me?” a man standing by my passenger door said.

I nearly leapt out of my skin at the sight of the stranger standing in the dim back glow of my car’s headlights. There wasn’t a lot special about his appearance; he just looked like a normal guy wearing jeans, a white shirt and a work jacket over it all. Still, I Instinctively took a step back, letting slip a small gasp.

His appearance wasn’t the scary part, though. How had he just gotten here? It was dead silent—I would have heard his approach. Not only that, but I had been certain there was *nobody* else in this town with me, and even if I was wrong, why would he have waited so long to reveal himself? My heart that had finally slowed began thumping once again.

“Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you.” He said with an odd inflection. It was so normal. A little too plain. Just on the edge of failing the reassurance he was going for. “I-I think I’m lost. Could you help me?”

My feet tensed nervously, unsure if I should back away or hold my ground. Swallowing hard, I did the only thing I could while they figured it out. I spoke. “W-where did you just come from?”

There was a short pause as he stared at me, his body unmoving. His arms lay limp at his side and his stance was a little too relaxed for a frightened person. Finally, he returned, “I don’t know. I-I think I’m lost. Could you help me?”

A numbing wash of dread poured over me as I shivered there in the pale light of the vending machine. The second half of what he’d just said—the part about needing help; he said it *exactly* the same way he had the first time. Same stutter, same tone, same pacing.

His first sentence was the opposite, though. It was so warbled and unsure; the words belching from his mouth like vomit. My eyes stayed trained on him while I held my flashlight before me, the beam feeling like the only barrier between me and him. I think it was desperation that urged me to try one more time, hoping that I was overreacting and that there was nothing suspicious about the only face I’d seen in what felt like an eternity.

“Where did you come from?” I asked with a choppy breath.

There was a silence between us much longer than last time. My breath cast itself in mist against the cold air, and after a while I held it so that it wouldn’t obscure my vision even a little.

“I c-came down the road, same as y-you,” His voice quivered in that same, warbled tone as before. Then, as clear as he said it the first two times, “I-I think I’m lost. Could you help me?”

The man moved slightly closer as if to plead, and the breath that I’d been holding was immediately taken away at what I saw. His feet slid. They didn’t step. The toes of his boots were barely touching the concrete, and they scraped across it when he moved forward. I couldn’t believe I hadn’t noticed; he was hovering in the air ever so slightly.

Still as a statue, my gaze began to trace up his body, seeing him with entirely new eyes. His stance wasn’t relaxed at all, he just almost looked… saggy. Like his muscles were absent, and he was just a rag doll. His face was the same. He had an expression almost like he was going to puke, his eyes bulging from his sockets in a most unsettling way. Being closer now, more light fell onto him, and I could see that they were yellowed, and his pupils were tiny pinpricks. All of that paled in comparison to the top of his head, however.

As I angled my flashlight up, trying to figure out how the man was floating, I saw the beam glint off something sharp and thin. A line running through the air straight up above him, like a wire or fishing string. The slow, agonizing seconds that followed were spent in frozen horror as I realized, the man wasn’t floating. He was dangling. What was even worse was what I realized as he spoke again.

“I came down the road, same as you,” he repeated like a broken record, his words a little more solid this time. It didn’t help the façade in the slightest. His mouth wasn’t even moving, and the voice was coming from the darkness behind my car. My eyes flickered to the space behind the hanging body, and my dread finally reached its boiling point.

There, on the roof of my car, barely visible in the florescent fingers of my light, I could see a long, pale arm. It’s hand was pressed against the sunroof, digits arched and tense in anticipation. It’s color was too sick and ghastly to even be close to human.

“I-I think I’m lost. Could you—”

It’s words cut off as abrupt as a recording when I took off running. A predator sensing fear, the moment it knew I could see past its act, it gave it up in favor of hunting me like a dog. As the man’s body fell to my peripheral, I caught the fleeting glimpse of something I can’t begin to explain. His body crumpled. Like it was nothing more than a cheap rubber mask or a deflating balloon, his flesh folded in on itself.

His eyes were the first thing to go, sucking somewhere into his head and leaving two empty sockets. His mouth stretched into a silent, contorted wail as the rest of his body sagged with it, and in a flash, he was nothing more than a wadded sleeve of skin. Most of his clothes slipped from him as the blanket of flesh was ripped upward into the darkness, and as they did, I caught more parts of the ‘man’ than I ever wanted to see. I remember in that moment I somehow found time to wonder why the creature in the dark would bother making its dummy so anatomically accurate, but looking back on it, it was foolish of me to assume it was ever a ‘dummy’ to begin with.

Any panicked, wild thoughts that I had like that one were quickly forced into a funnel of pure focus once I heard something jump fully onto my car. The shocks rocked and squeaked and I heard the hood dent too before hearing nothing at all. It was coming after me, and it was dead silent.

I don’t know how long I ran for, but it felt like an eternity. I pushed myself harder than I ever had in my life, running through the streets while my light flickered wildly before me. I never once bothered to try to chance a look over my shoulder.

My body ached quickly, its frail form no longer fit for running, but adrenaline did impossibly heavy lifting. Unsure of where to possibly go, I went to the only marker that I could see in the entire town. The radio tower.

Each step was a nightmare, the feeling of utter dread almost too strong to bear. I thought at any moment, that thing behind me would finally snatch me up and I’d become the next skin suit on its line, but then I finally saw the doors of what I assumed to be the radio station. Every other building had been unlocked so far, and I prayed for my sake this one was too.

I burst through the front doors with a pained grunt, my forearms nearly snapping from the force of slamming the handles, then kept going. I weaved through unknown halls until I found a staircase, then scurried up, tripping over myself as I did. When I reached the top, I found another door, jumped through it, then slammed it behind myself.

As I leaned all my body weight back on the handle, my thumbs glided along the knob in search of a lock. Finding one, I clicked it in before falling back against hard, office carpet. I crawled away from the barrier on my ass, flashing my phone at it to see if it was going to hold or not. To my relief, the thing didn’t even jostle it. I must have lost it somewhere in my sprint.

That didn’t mean I was about to risk anything, however. Flashing my light around the room to gather my bearings quickly, I dowsed my light, not wanting anything to see it through the windows. Then, still panting, I crawled my way over to a desk I’d spotted and curled up underneath it, holding myself while staring vacantly into the dark. I didn’t know what else to do. What could I do? I had no other means of help or escape.

And so this is where I’ve been laying for the last few days. There’s a bathroom in the room with me, and the water seems to work here, but it tastes awful. I avoided it for as long as I could, but had no other option. The real issue is food. There’s none in here that I’ve found, and I’m too scared to go out and check. Eventually, I know that too, will become necessary, however…

That leads me back to now. In my time laying here, I’ve been trying to send messages through any app that can do so on my phone, just hoping desperately that one of them will go through.

This is one of those messages.

Please, if you’re reading this, I don’t know how you even could, but *please*, send help.

My phone is getting low on battery, and I don’t know how much longer I’ll last before the pain in my stomach becomes too much.

When it finally does, I know I’ll need to go back outside to face whatever it is lying in wait among the dark, and I don’t like my odds…
