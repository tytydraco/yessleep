***The Spirit in the woods***

It happened in the winter of 2015. I live in a small apartment complex in upstate South Carolina. It was bordered by woods around the left side of the apartment and the backside of the apartment. It was around one o’clock in the morning. I was on the stoop of the apartment complex smoking a cigarette thinking how bad I had screwed up my life so far. I was using illicit  substances at the time and was living with my Father. I was contemplating what I was doing with my life at the time and what I was going to do with it. When I heard rustling from the woods on the left side of the apartment. 

I thought I was hallucinating at the time from the drugs. Then I realized that I wasn't on drugs at the time that this series of events happened. So I turned to look at the rustling noise from the left side of the apartment. It was the scariest thing that I have ever seen in my life. It was crouched down on all fours; it was as white as snow. The limbs were bent at absurd angles for a thing that had looked like a human being; its face was the most nightmare-fueled features of anything on earth. It had the most empty dark void for eyes; it was like looking into a dark starless sky. It had no nose at all but all I saw was slits where the nose should be. The mouth was upturned into a smile with sharp pointed teeth protruding from its lips. I thought for a second that I was going to die. 

I'm not ashamed about what happened next. I got up from the chair as fast as a flash of lightning. I started to run from the stoop of the apartment up a flight of stairs to my apartment. Then I heard an inhuman scream coming from behind me while I was running up the staircase to my apartment. I surely thought that I wasn't going to make it in time before the creature had gotten me. But then I had gotten into the apartment before the creature had gotten me. My father and step-mother were at home at the time.

I  had told them of what had happened to me outside just moments ago. They didn't believe me when I told them about it. They said I was hallucinating on the drugs at the time which I was a hundred percent sure I wasn't on at the time. They had told me to go to bed and get some sleep so that I would stop hallucinating. So I did as I was told and went to bed. My bed at the time was the couch in the living room at the time.  Because the apartment was a two bedroom. My parents had one room and my stepbrother had the other. I had only come home because I was homesick at the time because I was living as a vagabond across the United States. Thinking that if I changed my surroundings that my life would get better but that is a story for another time.

So I was laying on the couch trying to fall asleep. The couch is in front of the window that overlooks the woods in the backyard of the apartment as I was closing my eyes to try to fall asleep. There it was the creature that had emerged from the woods hanging on the window looking down on me from the window. Then I heard a strange voice inside my head telling me “ I am going to destroy your life by making it a living Hell until you want to die.” Then it had crawled away from the window and was going back into the woods. I couldn't fall asleep until the sun came out at dawn. So I had just laid there on the couch thinking was it a visual and auditory hallucination or was this creature real? So I had gotten some sleep during the day.

When I awoke it was four PM in the afternoon. I was going to figure out what this creature was if it was a creature or a demon. So I had started to do research on what I had seen of the creature on google and had come up with one answer. I had found out the creature was the Rake. Now all I had to figure out was if there was a way to get rid of it out of my life from what I saw there was no way of getting rid of it. So I had thought that maybe drugs would solve the problem. Which of course did not solve it. The creature came back again that night walking around the woods behind the apartment complex. So at the time I thought that maybe I should let it kill me and end my miserable existence on this planet.

I was too chicken though  to end my life by the creature's hand. I was even too wimpy to end my life by my own hands. Now I am grateful that I didn’t. I had become agoraphobic that I would not leave the house at all just sitting at the window. Hoping that the creature would just go away and leave me alone and let me just be miserable on my own standing. But nope it would not for the next month I would just stay inside the apartment and watch the creatures movements in the woods and out the corner of my eyes so afraid to leave the house. When I had finally gotten the courage to leave the house it was during the day so the creature wouldn't get me. I had to walk everywhere at the time because I didn't own a car at the time and you had to walk a long time before you got to any store where I am from.

So on one of these walks I had heard another voice. It sounded like a woman's voice that had told me where the creature lives and why it was coming after me. The voice had told me directions to this ravine near the main road where I live . It was a quarter of a mile away from the apartment complex. It had an opening for a big water drain for the rain water to runoff into the ravine. It looked so creepy that I was not willing to go anywhere near the place at all. The voice had told me that “ the creature was coming after me because I had so much negativity going on in my life that it feeds off of it. 

So now it was the week of me finally getting tired of my lifestyle and wanting to change it. I went into the woods that night and was going to face the thing that was stalking me. I saw it deep in the woods and screamed at it to leave me alone and that I was bettering my life. It just walked away and disappeared. When I had exited the woods the road was lit up with yellow glowing lights and I knew if I tried to do better that my life would get better. Thanks for taking your time to read this story. It is my first time trying to write about my life.
