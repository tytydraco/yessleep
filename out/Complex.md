I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I lingered on the slow, mechanical rumble of the car as my lungs filled with warm smoke. I exhaled slowly, watching the thin threads exit my car window, the wind interrupting its calm, unpredictable pattern. I let the voicemail play again. 

“*Cee. I know the last thing you probably want is to hear from me right now, but if there was anyone I would try to talk to, it’d be you.* 

*I’m back in town. I know you said not to. It’s just— I’m sorry. I couldn’t stay away after all.* 

*I’m going to the bridge tonight. You know the one.*

*…*

*Please, don’t come find me.”*

I put my phone down. One more deep breath. Two. Three. Gaze fixed towards the ceiling of my car, I went over the words again and again; line by line, word by word. I was searching. Searching for hidden meanings, unnatural shifts in tone. I wanted there to be more— a glimpse of hesitation, a plea for help, some sort of ambiguity as to her intentions. 

But no. El wasn’t the kind of person to make half-baked claims. She had decided a long time ago this is how it would end; I just didn’t think it would be so soon. 

Our last interaction was still vivid in my mind.

\*\*\*

Late September of the previous year. A sudden invitation at the local diner, one that I hesitantly accepted. We sat in silence, as nearly half a decade of no contact was broken. After a while, I opened my mouth, but no words followed. How could they, really? El was one of those people in life that had long overstayed their welcome. There was nothing that could be said that wasn’t already. Our story had already arrived at its natural conclusion.

El guiltily avoided eye contact with me, her arms crossed defensively at the table. She wore a red hoodie, her autumn hair bundled and haphazardly tucked into the back of her collar. Despite her efforts, it wasn’t hard to make out the slight bruising that crept up the right side of her neck, nor the poorly masked stench of alcohol. 

“I’m leaving town.” El cut through the silence suddenly, monotone— as if those three words were being rehearsed over and over in her head.

It wasn’t like it was surprising. There wasn’t much reason for anyone to stay in this town, even less for El. Everyone wants an escape at some point in their lives. At least she was one of the lucky few with a reason.

“Is that it?”

Her posture tightened.

“I just thought you should know.” 

“Why?”

“Who else would I tell?” 

She was right. It didn’t make it any better, though. 

“Listen, El. I can’t be that person for you—” I clutched my arm. It had been several years, but I still felt the pain. Not so much physical anymore, as it bloomed into the worst kind of scar— the kind that eats away at your psyche, and continues to harm long after its infliction. 

“Stop, Cee. I know.”

“Then why am I here?”

She paused. Long enough for me to consider leaving, but right when I was about to get up—

“Last week I tried to kill myself.”

She spoke so matter-of-factly it failed to register.

“My uncle found me. He dragged me into his room and beat me. After that he cried. Told me I was trying to leave him like everyone else did.”

Her uncle. Scott. I was reminded of her mom’s funeral— she was a piece of shit in her own right, but her final gift takes the cake; leaving the care of a deadbeat dirtbag like him up to El. He did nothing but sleaze around, get high, share needles with 20-something year olds and play victim.  

“I need you to know. Because if I end up coming back—”

She didn’t need to finish her thought. For the first time during our conversation, El met my gaze. I communicated something back to her with my eyes that I thought I had lost a long time ago. Sympathy. Understanding. 

“Then don’t come back.” 

\*\*\*

I flicked the lit cigarette out of the car into the darkness outside, and the memory with it. 

It was time to go.

The headlights cut through thick fog as I drove towards the bridge. I traveled on a tiny, rural two-way street that zigzagged through hills and tall pines.

The anticipation weighed on me. I detailed each step I would take in my head. Pull over. Put the car in park. Past the traffic bollards. Onto the trail…

Then I was there. A wooden bridge connected the two sides of a ravine over a small creek. The fog made it difficult to see the other side, even though it was less than a hundred feet across. 

I made my way forward slowly, not knowing what my next pace would reveal. Part of me hoped she would appear. The other lamented the implications if she didn't. 

Through the haze, I could make out the figure of a woman near the midpoint of the bridge. 

“El?”

She took a step towards me.

No, not a step. Something was wrong. A stumble. Unbalanced, her weight shifting too sharply on one side, barely able to move in a straight line. 

As she drew closer, I saw why.

The woman’s ankle dragged behind her, bent unnaturally with ruptured skin. One arm dangled precariously, held together by bits of fleshy sinew and torn muscle. Her neck crooked, as long, wet strands of a familiar autumn-hued hair covered bits of her ruined and broken body.

“Jesus, El?”

As El’s hair swayed side-to-side, it revealed a dislocated, bloody jaw. I heard her voice; muffled, unnatural, as if it were overlaid with static.

*“Where were you?”*

“El, I…” Her approach quickened. I backed up, but impossibly found myself running into the railing of the bridge. 

“*Where were you?”* She repeated the line, over and over.

“Wait!” I held my hands out and closed my eyes, expecting violence. The scar on my arm burned with reminiscence. But it never came. I looked around, and was met with the uncaring white blur that encompassed the bridge.

Nothing. 

Turning around, I peeked over the railing. Despite the thick fog, I could see the small creek below with mystical clarity.

And there she was.

*“Don’t come find me.”* I heard from behind— whipping around to see that I had somehow ended up at the far end of the ravine.

No one. Only fog. Only the bridge.

 \*\*\*

It took a few loops for me to understand something was off. A few dozen more to realize I was trapped. I tried to leave. I did. But I’ve walked the length of this bridge nearly a thousand times.

Sometimes, I see her disfigured body silhouetted against the mist, only for it to disappear as I approach.

Other times, I see Scott beat and berate her, as she cowers on the floor. I remember that day. El held me back as I tore the nearby landline out of the wall and bludgeoned him within an inch of his life.

El swung at me with a kitchen knife when I refused to stop. The day I got my scar. 

*“He’s all I have left!”* Her distorted, scratchy voice played again and again in my head.

But every time I crossed that bridge— without fail— one thing stayed constant. 

El’s body remained at the bottom of that creek.

I thought maybe I could stop it. 

That one of these times, through the fog, I would see her teetering on the edge, hesitant, afraid, waiting for me to come.

I walked for what felt like days, maybe even weeks trying to find El. The *real* El. 

*“But you won’t*,*”* her voice taunted. *“Because she’s at the bottom of that ravine.”*

A truth not worth confronting. 

What did I say to her again?

“I can’t be that person for you.” I muttered.

“*Then why are you here?”*

I don’t know.

*“No. You do.”*

\*\*\*

The fog cleared, and I peered over the edge; into the creek below. I had seen El’s mangled, broken body a thousand times walking along that bridge, and thought that maybe I would see it a thousand more. 

But all I saw was running water. Her final moments washed away, this town forever rid of her memory and burden. But I wasn’t— just like she wanted.

One week. It took me one week to listen to the voicemail she left. Deep down, I knew it would be the last time I would hear from her.

I backed away from the railing.

I see. It was your corpse speaking to me that day. It didn’t matter when I heard those words. You had always meant for them to be your last. The fact you chose me to hear them told me everything I needed to know. 

The trail in sight at last, I made my way back to the car. I felt nothing as the tip tap of boots on wood transitioned to the crunching of gravel, which again changed to the clacking of asphalt. 

Back to safety, I lit a single cigarette. Letting the smoke fill my lungs, I stared at the sea of pines I had just emerged from.

I pressed play. Again, her voice surrounded me, same as the encroaching fog.
