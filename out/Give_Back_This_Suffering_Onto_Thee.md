I didn’t remember anything before I woke up in an empty hotel room, tied to the chair sitting beside the bed.

There were no windows with the only light within the room coming from a lamp a few feet away from me.

In the bathroom which was in the far right corner of the room shuffling had started and quickly dissipated.

A masked man exited the room wearing nothing but black. His eyes weren’t visible from the glasses inside his mask.

Slowly, He made tip-toed-like movements toward the chair sitting in front of me.

He was breathing hard. Really hard.

Once he sat down it still continued while my heart beated out of my chest.

“You know why you’re here?” He asked with his growling tone of voice.

I kept staring at him, refusing to answer.

“You seem a bit deaf, I said do you know why you’re here?” His voice a little bit louder than before.

Again, refused to answer.

He continued to stare at me, his breathing still heavy yet stuttering like a wound being healed.

“I don’t know you, you don’t sound familiar.” I finally answered out of pure curiosity.

“You do know me.”

“I promise you really. I don’t know you.”

He laughed.

“Sure you do, we grew up together, and we were in the same classes multiple times throughout the years. Of course, you'd probably wouldn't remember any of the bullshit you did to me with how far your head is up your ass.

You're a small-town politician hoping to escape from your parent’s shadows…specifically your father's. Every one of you stuck-up assholes all think the same way. 

The man shook his head and got up from his chair and went back to the bathroom.

I shuffled around in my seat and noticed that my restraints were loose. After a few minutes of struggling, I made it out paying the price with my wrists being shaved of some skin from the rope. I took my time walking to the door of the room, hearing the sound of a tap running water in the bathroom. 

I opened the door to find no hallway to this room. In its place was a warehouse interior.

“Where do you think you’re going?” A voice came from the right of the door followed by the cocking of a shotgun.

“We are far from finished here.” The man put the end of the barrel onto my back.

“Walk to the door—the one going outside. Don’t try anything either. I got a 9mm with your name on it.”

“Where is it?”

“Find it.”

In the warehouse was only that single hotel interior with a speaker off to the side still playing the sound of running water. On the walls of the warehouse were weapons of every kind. 

I found the door and opened it to be greeted by the night. We were in the forest with nothing but the sounds of the wildlife and the winter breeze accompanying us.

“Right.” The man ordered

From this point on I was led through the dark in nothing but my house clothes to an opening. I barely could see what was in front of me but it looked like graves.

“What are you showing me?”

“Your comrades, people that worked for you… and don’t even think about trying to report this. If you open your mouth, I will know… **we** will know and your life will end in a flash. Your wife, Julia… your two kids, Max and Ian will be next. We know their schedules and will end them quickly.”

“Look, if you need payment, I will give it to you.”

“We don’t need payment. Do your job right and treat the people right.”

The man lowered the shotgun and put his hand on the 9mm handle. 

“Get your ass out of here.”

I jogged into the night weaving through the trees. Before long, I made it back into town and made my way back home to the confused faces of my family.

“Where have you been?” My wife asked.

“Taking a walk.” 

Before she could say anything else, I got into the shower and got into bed.

I can’t say anything else besides I don’t know what decisions I have made in the past to lead me to this situation but my lips have been sealed up until this point. My nights have remained sleepless since then and I have moved away and quit my political career altogether
