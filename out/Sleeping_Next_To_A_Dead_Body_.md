When I was about 4 years old my aunt who had been battling leukemia for almost a year had moved in with us. She had been living on her own up until then as she didn't want to be a burden to relatives (although we never thought of it that way). She was a pilot in the army (?) before she became sick and was incredibly particular about her bedroom and things. With that, she refused to let anyone inside of her apart from herself of course, me, and my sister. Since we were the oldest out of all her neices and nephew and were well - behaved for our age she allowed us to hang out with her and every now and then. Being so young we didnt really understand how sick she was at the time. Over the her first few months in the house she had begin emitting this smell when her health began to quickly deteriorate. I couldn't pinpoint what exactly the smell but I can only describe it as the smell of burnt tobacco cigars that had a strong smell combined with the smell of animal feces. Because of this my sister soon began to distance herself until she no longer wanted to go to my aunt's room completely one day. I had felt bad about it because even at such a young age I saw how lonely and isolated my aunt was from her family.

One day she had requested if me and my sister wanted to sleep with her in bedroom. My sister obviously said no right away and I was left with the daunting task of being the only one to sleepover in my aunt's room that night. Since she would cough and heave every now and then I had trouble falling asleep til early morning when she finally went quiet. Being incredibly sleepy I finally crawled into bed next to her and slept with a blanket over my face as I always did. It was around 5am in the morning when I woke up because I needed to go to the bathroom. Imagine my horror as a 4 year old pulling the blanket off my face and my aunt's and seeing her laying next to me eyes and mouth open no longer breathing. Her physical appearance showed early signs of decay (?) because her skin, nails, and lips had began to change color. On top of that she had clearly passed whatever was the last thing she consumed because the bed cover from her waist down had an obvious yellowish brown stain and the white shorts she had worn that night were too. To this day I can't begin to explain how awful death and decay smelled like especially in someone who had passed from a disease. I watched her as if waiting for her to wake up or suddenly take in a breath. When it all finally sank in I screamed for my parents who came running from the opposite room.

As a 4 year old I could barely process what was happening as I watched my parents expression go from concerned to my mom falling apart on the floor as she weeped and my father trying to console her why my sister was frozen in horror at the door who had been woken up from the commotion. It was only a few minutes later when the police and morgue staff were able to pick up may aunt's lifeless body to be prepared for her wake.

I later overheard my parents speaking with police that she had been dead for a few hours and realizing I had been sleeping next to a body without knowing for all that time, and knowing me I have a habit of cuddling and hugging neonle or stuff toys I slent with as a kid. To this day I refuse to look into coffins during wakes regarding of whoever it was that passed because of it. I still have nightmares about it even though its been decades since it happened.
