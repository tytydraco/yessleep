 

This happened not too long ago and I wanted to share it ASAP. I live in the deep south and as such am used to traveling long stretches of highway without streetlights or civilization. I honestly prefer it but that’s because I was in the safety of a vehicle, walking in it is not the same. I was coming back home from visiting my sister a couple of counties over. She had gotten sick at the very beginning of the Pandemic and almost died from it. She recovered obviously but her lungs suffered a good bit of damage so I go visit when I can now that everything is semi back to normal.

Its about a 4-5 hour drive and I had left later than I intended just because got caught up talking. Once I get on the highway that will take me straight home houses become sparse and no street lights can be seen except a few near the houses. About an 10 miles away from home my check engine light pops on and no sooner did I look at it my car begin making a god awful noise and I had to pull over. Using the light from my phone I tried to look under the hood but couldn’t see anything by that measly light. So I called my wife to come pick me up and I would deal with it in the morning. No Answer. She has a bad habit of letting her phone die and not realizing it. Calling a tow truck was not worth it because I’m so far out by the time they get there I could have walked home, so that’s what I did. I’m in ok shape and It’s a straight shot home so I figured no biggie. It was a peaceful walk…for about an hour.

It was a moonless night but the stars were out and the crickets were chirping. But I realized that they had gone silent and then I could swear I heard footsteps behind me. I stopped. Nothing. I guessed it must have been my steps echoing and started walking again. There the steps were again so I stopped…same thing. I was a bit freaked out now and decided to experiment. I begin walking again and when I heard the steps I increased my speed slightly. I could still hear the other steps matching my own. So as a final test I stopped suddenly. I heard two extra steps behind me. Now I knew…. Something was following me. My mind raced was it an animal? A Meth head thinking to rob me? As I was standing still wondering what the hell to do I heard one heavy step and that was all I needed. I bolted. Now I could hear the heavy footfalls not even trying to disguise themselves. I knew I couldn’t keep this up and it was gaining on me. Abot that time luck, karma, devine intervention whatever you call it happened.

A light appeared behind me and I could hear an engine but I didn’t dare look behind lest I slowed. A second or so later a truck skidded to a halt next to me and I heard a voice shout “JUMP IN!!!” I didn’t need to be told twice, I grabbed the side of the bed and rolled in the back and no sooner had I than the driver Sped off so fast I slid into the tailgate but I didn’t care. I looked back but it was so dark I couldn’t see anything but I swear I heard a growl over the trucks engine. I looked back towards the cab and the driver was opening the back window and had his interior light on. I realized it was my neighbor (about a mile apart but still).

I poke my head in the cab and tell him thanks. He looks at me with these wide eyes

“What The Fuck Was That!!”

“I dunno man, I just heard it chasing me I never stopped to look back.”

He told me he had seen my car a ways back and wondered if I needed help so he drove slow looking for me. He said he spotted me running and some giant vaguely humanoid shape chasing me. He said it was just shy of 7 feet by his guess and wide as a barn. I asked did he think it was bear. He looked at me again… “Do YOU think it was a bear?” I didn’t. We rode in silence to my house where he dropped me off and said we’d go in the morning to see about my car. I thanked him and hurried inside and locked the door.

The next morning my wife was hysterical that she had let her phone die and I had needed help but I told her I was ok….I did not tell her what happened. My neighbor came around 9 am and we drove out to my car. We decidedly did not talk about the night before but that went out the window when we got to my car. It was destroyed. All the glass had been shattered, the tires slashed (looked like claws) and it looked like the Hulk had went to town on the body. Dents covered it on almost every inch. The worst of all…there was a deer carcass lying on the roof with its belly ripped open. In its blood written on the hood was one word… “Almost”.
