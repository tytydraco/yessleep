I came to a Buddhist temple on a 4-day silent meditation retreat after many failed attempts at trying to practice appeasing my mind. I was finally able to identify the voice in my head that’s incessantly thinking and draining me at a daily basis, and begin to observe it instead of feeling it as if it were myself. That is to say, I began to observe it and hear it (the book The Power of Now does a good job at illustrating my point), and I began to “tame it” for lack of a better word. With many hours and a lot of focus, I managed to let it jump around from thought to thought, memory to memory all without letting it take me with it. Ultimately and thankfully, gaps of silence began opening between all the noise. 

And so, in the last night of my retreat, I prepared for bed. I continued this practice of observing the noisy little voice inside me. This time, I also started to observe the physical pain I’ve carried for years, pain that is always triggered by stress and keeps me from sleeping. In my dreams, I find myself holding a tiny little zip-lock bag for my mother, who’s talking to someone I don’t recall. In this little bag, there was a gigantic bug, the size of a pinto bean, and similar in color, with hard and jagged legs and a gigantic sting that protrudes from the back. I feel curious to hold this creature, I remove it from the bag and press it tightly and safely between my fingers so it doesn’t escape. The bug gets angry and struggles to break free, I feel its powerful hind legs pushing against my thumb with its sharp spikes. Slowly, it excretes its sting, and as it’s about to puncture me, I let it go, and it immediately scurries between the sheets we are lying on. 

I woke myself up screaming “Help me ma, I don’t know what to do!” and violently kicked the wall against the bed I was sleeping on. As I turn the lights on and shut my eyes again to recover from the nightmare, I see as if my mind was layered with a plexiglass, with small beige bugs scurrying around and obscuring any thoughts that are playing behind them. I open my eyes… yes I’m awake, I close my eyes again and I see now the face of a gigantic bug opening its mouth cavity and coming towards me. I open my eyes again, and a terrifying thought pops through: The voice in my head.

I closed my eyes again. Keeping my composure at the sight of the bug, which was still there, I asked, “Friend or foe?” Without a second’s hesitation, I heard, “Foe.” This time, it didn’t feel like it was me at all.

I’m still here, it’s 1:40am and I have to get in less than 3 hours for the last day of meditation at the temple… I need the courage and rest to see this through.
