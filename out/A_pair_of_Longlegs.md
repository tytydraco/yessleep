What's up mates, I'm from Australia, you can call me John, not my real name of course but that's what I'll call myself to keep anonymity. I live in Perth, a fine city. I work at a local office, doing the regular 9 to 5, after that, I clock out and head back home to my fiancé. That's how nearly every day has been.  
  
Except for one, particular day.  
  
As you can expect, the day was going perfectly fine, as usual. I kissed my fiancé goodbye and went to work, that day we had a particularly good day, everyone at my office was usually groogy and didn't seem interested, but as you can expect, they were genuinely happy for once. I finally had an amazing day at work, and, for once,  
I didn't necessarily want to go back home.  
  
So, that's why I did some overtime work, until I realised that there were only 3 other people doing overtime with me, I'll call 'em Samuel and Rebecca, Samuel clocked out a few minutes after I did, when I got outside, it was particularly dark.  
  
Too dark.  
It was as if the moon couldnt shine light over here, I saw the moon and all but it was really dark, I had to use my phonelight to see the ground. Since I knew where I parked my car, I headed to open the door, it unlocked. I put the keys in the ignition.  
  
I quickly begun to reverse, until my car stopped and I heard a loud thud and something hitting my car. I immediately heard a inhumane scream, something demonic and unholy. I quickly turned my attention to the rearview camera, and that's when I saw..  
  
Legs.  
  
I saw legs, but, they just kept going inside of the darkness, no torso was visible, my rearview camera emitted light so, I could see for a little while but, the legs kept going, no torso in sight. I immediately  
begun to panic as I was wondering what the fuck this thing was.  
  
I stayed in the car for a few minutes, eventually coming out. But as soon as I turned when I closed the door, the legs were gone. I screamed out for Sam's name, he came out during this time. He began to walk torwards me, asking what was wrong. Suddenly, I saw him get lifted into the air by a long, skeletal hand, and that hand threw him on the roof, fast. Really fast. I heard several bones crunching and the splattering of his organs, I assume.  
  
I immediately got back in my car.  
  
I stayed in my car, not moving it an inch, hoping it wouldn't know I was here. I had somewhat accepted my fate by then and went to bed, not expecting to wake up. I, did wake up and waited till morning to come out of my car. I drove back home to my fiancé immediately.  
  
She was asking what happened and why I didn't come home last night, I couldn't find the words, so I lied and said I was working overtime and couldn't track time and had just came back. Our house was far away, about an hour's drive from the office, so she ran with it. Thank god.  
  
I immediately called my boss and told him I wouldn't come to work today as I had felt sick to my stomach and had to get better throughout the weekend, she understood and let me have the rest of the week of, god bless her soul.  
  
That's about the end of my tale, believe it or not, but all that matters? Is that I know the truth of what happened to Samuel Glenn. We had a funeral for him, they found his bones. That's all that was left of him. As for Rebecca? Hell if I know.  
  
I'll see you good people later.[](https://account.reverso.net/Account/Register?utm_source=speller&utm_medium=banner-text-limit-reached&lang=en&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reverso.net%2Fspell-checker%2Fenglish-spelling-grammar%2F%23login=success)
