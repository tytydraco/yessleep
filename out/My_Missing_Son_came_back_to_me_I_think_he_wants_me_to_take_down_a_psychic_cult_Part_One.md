I know how crazy that might sound, and how unbelievable the idea might be. I haven’t told anyone about this, no friends, no family, but it happened. I don’t know where to go or who to contact, so I figured I’d get my story out there. 



My son Matthew was always a good boy, good grades at school, well-behaved, always top of his class. Some of the kids got a little jealous of him and would bully him, that’s for sure, but he was always a good boy. I can’t think of any reason someone would want to hurt him, or why he would want to hurt anyone else. 



I still remember the day he went missing. It was like any normal day; he woke up, we had breakfast, he went off to school, only he never came back. Poof, gone in a day without so much as a word. I barely even noticed until it got to around ten o’clock, and no phone call; he always called around nine if he was going out with friends after school, but I hadn’t even noticed he was gone until dinner-time, god- I felt like such a shitty mother. I called the police immediately, and the next day they got to looking for him.



Immediately, they came around my house and started grilling me about my son. “Who were his friends?” “What did he do after school?” “Any enemies?” (As if a fucking ten-year-old has enemies*.)* “Did he act out of character?” I had no answers to any of this, except that he liked to take long walks in the woods outside of town. “Do you think he got lost?” One officer asked me, to which I shrugged, “It’s possible, but I don’t know. If he did, he probably would have called.” The officer raised an eyebrow, “Probably as in he might have*,* or probably as in He would have*?*” 



That just got on my last nerve; my son was missing, and somehow I’m to blame? “Probably, as in yes, he would have! God Damn it! My son is missing, and you are interrogating me instead of putting in the effort to find him! I told you everything! What is this? Some kind of sick fucking joke? My son is gone! So find him instead of sitting here!” I said as I raised my voice. The officer looked at me with an expression of pity. “Ma’am, we are doing everything we can to find your son. We just need to know all of the details, even little tiny things matter. Was he bullied at school? Could someone or something have hurt him in any way?”. I thought about that, and I remembered walking in the woods in town with him as a little boy, and noticing a small cabin that always had the windows shut, no one ever seemed to enter or leave, but somehow…. The lights were always on, big yellow lights that shone from the outside blinds, and it felt so… *inviting?* Matthew even asked to enter at one point, and I almost said “Yes.”, but I thought better of it.  I told the officer about it, and they said it was likely a meaningless detail, and not of importance. 

  


The police searched for six months, they looked up and down for Matthew, searched every corner of town and the woods, but found nothing. They closed Matthew’s case a few months ago, and I screamed at the police chief every day. Still, they refused to reopen the case, and even I began to lose hope in the investigation. 

I questioned myself a lot after what happened. Was it my fault? Had I said something to him that made him want to leave? Was it harder being without his father in the picture than I had thought? How could I have not known he hadn’t come home? I took up a lot of drinking during those days, and got back into smoking after having quit when Matthew was born- somehow that made me feel even shittier. I took multiple sick days off with depression, until it just got so bad that I ended up losing my job. A lot of my friends began to notice how bad I had gotten; my friend Janett even offered to help me find a therapist. I thought about going, but I never did. I think I could just never face the idea that my son was gone.

  


Then, he came back to me. And here is the crazy part, not how you might think, physically coming to my door, no, it was a thought, “*Help me, Mom*.” I heard in his exact voice. I thought I was just imagining things when I heard it again, “*Help me, Mom. Can you hear me?”*. I thought I must be going crazy, hearing Matthew’s exact voice. I sobbed; maybe I did need therapy, maybe I needed help more than I thought. Once more, I heard it, “*Mom, can you hear me?”*. My heart stopped. Maybe there was a chance he was trying to tell me something beyond the grave? I thought back to him, “*Yes, Matthew, I can hear you.”* A few minutes later, and nothing, maybe I was crazy? I knew there was no chance of him responding and yet- *“Good. Listen to me carefully, they can hear us too. I cannot talk long. The old abandoned cabin, the one in the woods. Go there- you’ll find answers.* The old cabin…. I hadn’t thought about that in months…. Maybe it was him? There were only two people in the world who would have known about that; it had to be something. “*Why?*” I thought back to him, *“What is there? Where are you?”*   
  
*“I’m above,”*  he thought back to me. *"Above? What is above? Above the sky?" “Above the physical plane. Hard to explain.”* I laughed, *“Alright, I’m definitely going fucking crazy. I’m talking to my dead son from beyond the physical plane. Thanks a lot for that.”* It was depressing, yet there was some humor in it; at least I was sane enough to know I was losing it. I grabbed myself a bottle of wine and a glass, pouring in a generous amount and taking a long sip. *“I can promise you it is true. Just go to the Cabin, you’ll find it. Have to go.”* 



I don’t know why, but I decided to leave for the cabin after taking a long shower and giving myself an hour to sober up. The walk was quiet and cold. Matthew didn’t “say” much during the walk; it was oddly silent. I wasn’t even sure why I was doing this, to feel better? Some hope that maybe my life could be how it was before what happened, before the crash… I tried not to think about the crash, tried to pretend it never happened, but there it went again, like an incurable illness that finally reached me again after nine years. I still remember that day, the day Richard- Matthew’s father died. He left to go get groceries, got them, left the store, when on his way back, a drunk semi-truck driver slammed into the right side of the car, killing him on impact. Matthew… he was such a good boy during that time, he always helped me with whatever I needed, always lent a helping hand around the house to fill in for his father, always lent a shoulder to cry on when it got too much. I started to cry just thinking about it when I realized why I was doing this. Matthew was always there for me when I needed him, and now it was my time to be there when he needed me.   
  
I walked for what felt like miles until I saw the cabin; it glowed in the distance like a beacon from a lighthouse. As I saw that, I felt scared, but I reminded myself I was here for Matthew and I opened the door. 



Inside, I saw nothing, just a regular cabin with a bright fireplace and some soft jazz playing in the background; it was as if no one had even left, yet nobody ever came in, as far as I knew. There has to be something, I thought, so I looked around, searching for anything of note, and found nothing. The place seems as average as any, aside from that jazz, which now felt fairly creepy as it continued to play. *“Upstairs.”*, Matthew said, or rather, thought to me. I walked slowly upstairs and came to a set of two wooden doors. *“Which one, Matty?”* I thought. *“Left.”* He replied to me, so I turned left, walking through the wooden door which creaked as I opened it slowly, my heart pounded as I peered inside, inside there was a sight I still haven’t forgotten, a small unlit shrine laid in the center of the room, the candle smell still seem to echo in the room, giving an earthy smell with a hint of jasmine, and directly on the alter, *Blood*. I felt sick to my stomach. What was this? God, was Matthew really talking to me? Leading me here to- whatever this was? Most importantly, was it his blood? That was all I could think about; if he had been hurt, I would have killed whoever did it. All of a  sudden, my head started to clench in severe pain, as if someone had shoved a metal rod in my brain and shifted it around, I wanted to leave this room all of a sudden, every complusion within me told me to go and never look back, but I remembered Matthew... and I pushed past it for him.



 “*It’s not mine, Mom. I promise,”* he said to me. I furrowed my brows. How much could he hear? *“Can you read all of my thoughts?”* I thought of him. *“No, just the ones about me. I promise."* Matthew wasn’t a liar; he could never lie, not to me, so I believe him on that.  
  
 On the other side of the room, I saw a chest of drawers. Slowly, I opened them up and found a silver knife, dipped in blood… my stomach dropped, as my head began to clench even harder in pain, but I was not surprised. In all honesty, I knew there was some kind of crime here. On the other side, I saw a small photo of a group of people having some kind of gathering, all of them sat in a circle around the altar right in front of me and wearing dark black robes, and on the bottom, I spotted a date.  
  
  
**MEETING- JANUARY 2025**



January 2025…. That was the month Matthew was taken… I felt sick to my stomach. Did these people take Matty and do something to him? God, I saw the house so many times. How did I not know what was happening here? An entire cult, right under mine and the town's nose… I really was an awful mother for not knowing. I started to cry. I had let my son get taken by cultists, or worse, die, and I had only found out just now this was happening? I was a horrible mother, a truly horrible mother.  My tears were stopped when Matthew spoke again to me, *“They are here. You have to leave.”*, pulling me out of my hysteria in seconds. At that moment, I also heard a *Creek* sound coming from the stairs; someone was coming.   
  
I jumped up and ran as fast as I could, looking for an escape, going into full-blown panic mode.  I had barely any time to stop and register my surroundings when a black figure came behind me and pushed me to the ground. In his hands, he had a silver blade- exactly like the one I found in the drawer. Out of hope this attacker was a man, I kicked him in the balls, he fell to the ground with a wince, and I ran, taking no time to look at the man who had assaulted me. 



I am now at home, safe and sound, thankfully. I’m not crazy, I feel at least somewhat confident enough in that, but I don’t know what to do next. Matthew hasn’t contacted me since, and I’m worried about that. All I know is I need to find my baby, whatever it takes.
