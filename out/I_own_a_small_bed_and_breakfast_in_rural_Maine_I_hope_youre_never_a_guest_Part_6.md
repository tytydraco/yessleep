At the very beginning of my first post, I told yall there was never more than one guest. At the time, that was true. 

Holy shit. It’s not true anymore. 

Before I get started, happy new year and belated happy holidays. It was pretty dull here, but I baked cookies with Julia and had a gift exchange with her for Christmas, because even though I don’t celebrate, she does. I was going to put up some lights - I usually do - but I’ve been under the weather and the weather here has been a bit too precipitous for my taste (we have gotten an upsetting amount of snow and my back is definitely closer to forty than I want to admit). 

Anyway - what you’re here for. 

I’m still reeling.

December 25th, 2025

Julia was allowed to see her sister on Christmas morning, and I used some of my money to make sure she could spoil her. As a result, the holiday morning here was calm and quiet. I sipped on some coffee and balanced my books, then idly sorted my linens for what would need to be replaced in the new year. 

I was waiting for my guest. I always have a Christmas guest. It’s just that time of year. 

I was taking stock of my pillowcases when I heard rapid knocking on the door. It wasn’t heavy or particularly urgent, but it was… present. Commanding. 

Five knocks, pause, five knocks. The pattern repeated with near perfect timing as I hauled it to the entryway while yanking on my blazer. I swung open the door during the middle of a five knock cycle and smiled in welcome at the guest on my porch. 

She was older, with short cropped hair as white as the snow on my lawn. She was five feet tall if it was a good day and her hazel eyes were merry. 

“Any room at the inn, or should I sleep out in the barn?” Her question came out with a thick Downeast accent and a bright smile. “Was supposed to head to Florida today, but my flight got cancelled and I need a place to stay. Found this place on Google, and it looked a lot nicer than anythin’ in Bangor.” 

(As an aside, I need everyone to know that it’s pronounced Bang-OR in Maine. It’s not “banger.” I also need everyone to know that when this guest pronounced it, there wasn’t an “r” sound in town.) 

“Always room at The Cottage,” I beamed, and welcomed her inside after a quick glance up. The sky was still gray and moody and absolutely promised more trouble to come. “Merry Christmas, if you celebrate. Come on in. Fifty bucks a night, no holds for incidentals, and complimentary breakfast at 8am. If you choose to or need to stay more than one night we just charge it again at the front desk, no trouble at all.” 

“Merry Christmas to you!” Her voice was cheerful. “What a steal! You gotta find the small businesses in this state, I’m telling ya.” She shuffled around in a ruby dyed bag until she pulled out a debit card and her ID. Laurie M, from Machias, 61 years old. Her license shared that same merry smile that she had in front of me now. 

“Excellent, thank you, Laurie. Room two - upstairs, first door on your left. I do have someone staying in room one at the moment, you’ll likely meet her at breakfast. I find that sometimes I collect strays.” Laurie laughed at that and patted my hand with hers after I handed her back her property and room keys. Her skin was warm and soft and reminded me of my grandmother in the best of ways. 

She took off to settle in and I returned to my task of sorting and logging my linen supplies. I allowed my mind to wander - and it found its way up the stairs to room two. 

I wondered what this sweet lady was doing at The Cottage. She said she had a flight delay, but this B&B is not an easy drive to Bangor and it’s certainly not a good drive in bad weather. I wondered what was drawing her to Florida, though the answer was likely sunlight; I wondered what she had seen and lived and known from her life in Maine. 

Her accent was one that you don’t hear often, and you never hear it from people who aren’t born here and who haven’t lived here for years. This woman’s blood was likely White Pine pitch (that’s the state tree, in case you were curious), and here she was, at my crossroads on her way out of the state. 

I was tempted to nap, but I couldn’t possibly sleep until Julia was back here safely. The roads were atrocious, and from Bar Harbor to here is almost two hours on a good day. 

She made it home around 2pm and we began our adventure in snickerdoodle cookies. Julia was a brilliant baker and I found myself learning more from her than she from me, especially in regard to her understanding of ratios and how they affected baking. Seriously, the kid should do a lecture series on fat to sugar to dry ingredients. I think she’d make a killing. 

Anyway, as we were baking, I let her know there was a guest in room two and to be polite. She rolled her eyes - because she was always polite - and said, “Sure thing, Mare. Do you know what her problem is?” 

I winced slightly at her phrasing but shook my head. I didn’t want to tell her anything significant - I try not to tell guests about other guests, though I guess since I’m posting here I can’t claim to care about their privacy *that* much - but she was more my second hand than another guest already. 

“Can’t get a read on her. Very sweet older woman, I think you’ll like her. Thick Downeast accent.” Julia smiled at my response. 

“With two cs?” I blinked at the young woman’s question and Julia laughed. “Thick with two cs? Like butts? A meme? You’ve never heard of that?” 

I shook my head and felt a blush creeping into my cheeks but stomped it down. “Maam, I am twice your age and interact with human beings maybe four times a week total. I barely know what a meme is, cut me some slack.” 

Julia practically howled with laughter and kept making various references to different memes throughout the rest of our baking. Together, we made four dozen snickerdoodle cookies, three of which will be frozen to dole out in the coming weeks.

The house smelled like Christmas - like cheer and cinnamon and hot chocolate and roast chicken and a bit like wood fire because I let one be lit for the special occasion - and I found that despite all the sugar, I crashed into sleep like a cliff diver into waiting waves.

I dreamed of Laurie and oatmeal with blueberries and real maple syrup. I dreamed of a young woman, a national guardswoman, who served her country with pride. I dreamed of a brave woman who faced danger without blinking and loved fearlessly. I dreamed of that woman, who served with so much dignity and patriotism, and dreamed of her quiet discharge from service due to her telling what wasn’t supposed to be asked or told. 

I dreamed of her chasing love across the globe, of another woman who haunted her dreams, of a best friend from college who had slipped through her fingers. I dreamed of her search - still before wide usage of the World Wide Web - for this brown haired beauty who kept Laurie awake at night imagining a future. This brown haired beauty’s career kept her moving, always just out of Laurie’s reach.

I dreamed of a long awaited reunion, of warmth and love and hope in a hotel in some European country. I dreamed of cigarette smoke and low music and a bed that was only left for showering and food and using the bathroom while Laurie and her beauty caught up on over a decade of lost time. 

I dreamed of a mournful goodbye, a promise of reconnection, a promise of that future. I dreamed of Laurie being single, and writing letters, and waiting and waiting and waiting. I dreamed of a lonely lobster woman who looked at the choppy ocean that provided for her while she daydreamed about a landlocked hotel. 

I dreamed of her beauty moving back to the states, marrying a man,  having two children and living an idyllic American dream life. I dreamed of that beauty - Kathy - looking in the mirror and imagining that instead of her husband she had that girl she loved in college brushing her teeth behind her. 

I dreamed of Facebook. I dreamed of a friend request from a widowed woman to a long-single spinster. I dreamed of that iconic messenger sound and a four word message that changed everything and nothing at the same time -

“I always loved you.” 

A retired widow in Tampa, Florida lived in a neighborhood near her two children and five grandchildren and she still dreamed about her week in a hotel in Europe. 

I dreamed about plane tickets being bought with shaky hands, about long phone calls, about thousands and thousands of messages being sent back and forth, now catching up on the last thirty years. 

I dreamed of strong feelings, of love and hope and fear and a thrumming sense of fate. 

That sense was still pounding in my chest when I woke with a start to a much gentler, slower knock than the one I had heard earlier in the day. 

I never had two guests at once. I never got two guests on the same day. 

I yanked something that resembled professional clothing onto my body and attempted to wake myself up before I opened my front door anew. 

Another woman, this one much younger. Younger than me. She was tall, at least five eight, with eyes staring at nothing and dog hair clinging to her clothing. Her olive skin was tinged with red on her cheeks and nose where the cold had bit her - she had only a tee shirt and jeans on. 

Still, the thing that struck me wasn’t her attire or lack of. It wasn’t the time of night nor her vacant expression. 

It was the way she spoke immediately, her voice flat and hollow but still somehow filled with oceans upon oceans of pain. 

“Please let me stay here. I have nowhere else to go.” 

Something crawled up my spine, an instinct I had felt before but couldn’t believe was relevant staring at the young woman on my porch. 

I ignored it. 

“Always room at The Cottage,” I replied, my voice clipped but professional. “Come on in.” 

The Massachusetts license she handed me was worn and scratched so badly that I couldn’t read anything except the state and first name - Madison. I frowned, but the request for identification was one I had long learned was more for routine than actual policy, so I just handed it back to her.

Extramortal beings rarely find the time for DMV visits. Might as well let the humans have a pass, too. 

“Room three,” I informed her, exchanging the ratty fifty note she handed me for one of the remaining two keys. “Second door on the right. Breakfast is at eight in the morning. I’ve got some other guests right now, so if you prefer to eat separately, I will accommodate.” 

“Thank you,” Madison replied, her voice still odd - still hollow and flat. “Have a good night.” 

I watched her go up the stairs with a small frown on my face. I caught myself chewing the inside of my lip with anxiety. 

I was almost afraid to fall back asleep. That instinct deep in my brain kept screaming at me that something was wrong. It was keeping me up, and it was making my heart feel tight in my chest, but I couldn’t fight it. I couldn’t fight The Cottage. 

I dreamed of Madison, the memory eater.

I dreamed of the source of idle forgetfulness, the reason you walk into a room and have no clue why you’re there. I dreamed of the gap between years where you know you were alive but have long forgotten what transpired. 

First she fed on any memory at all. Good, bad, it didn’t matter. It fueled her - until she grew greedy. She began to crave more - she craved the power of knowing something about a human that they no longer did. She began to enjoy the confusion of her victims knowing they had a memory once, but that memory now being hers.

So, Madison began stealing memories. Good memories. Ones that her victims would revisit in times of pain, ones that comforted them, ones they would never have forgotten without her. She reveled in it. The birth of a child. Adopting a pet. A wedding. A graduation. All would become hers to savor.

I dreamed of her staying young for far too long. I dreamed of decades upon decades of movement across cities and states and nations and continents. Any time someone grew suspicious of the young caretaker remaining so young for so long, she would flee, leaving that community for at least a generation’s memory. 

I dreamed of a young nurse’s aid who predicted bad days on the memory unit, of a woman who preferred the dinner shift because she was so adept at managing sundown symptoms. She chewed around the edges of her patient’s minds, just enough from each one to satiate her, just enough to make their disease progress a tiny bit further. 

She came here on her travels, the nursing home in Ellsworth that she’d worked at for years now suspicious of her youth. Madison truly had nowhere to go because Madison was almost done existing. The memory eater, ironically, had no memory of her original name, her original self, because she had been recreated so many times over so many years.

I dreamed of her beginning. I dreamed of her name. She was just another little girl born and raised in Elizabethan England, neither noble nor dreadfully poor, a middle daughter in a family with seven living children. She did not learn to read or write, and at the age of seventeen was wed. 

Her new husband was some other extra-mortal being, or perhaps a sorcerer; the details beyond her being changed into what she is now were fuzzy at best. When he transformed her, he did not imagine the loss of self she would experience. He did not imagine her rage at him. He could never have imagined the monster she would inevitably become. 

She destroyed him with her new powers. She left him a husk of a man. 

I woke up to my alarm then, irritated at the interruption in seeing more of what Madison could not remember. I couldn’t allow her to steal memories from Laurie, the happy woman finally getting her happy ending. I wouldn’t allow it.

I nearly jumped out of my skin when Madison was already waiting for me in the kitchen. 

“You know what I am,” she said, not allowing me to ask whatever version of “what the fuck” was about to come out of my mouth. “I don’t know how I got here, but I do know what you have. What Julie has. What Laurie has. And I know you know who I am. I can taste it.”

I gestured to the dining room door and walked through with her. It was time for us to talk. 

“Margaret Cotton,” I said quietly. “Your parents married you off to someone who made you what you are. You were a commoner in England. That’s what you can’t remember.”

Madison closed her eyes and took a deep breath. 

“Thank you.” She looked across the table at me and smiled with something between gratitude and motive. “When I arrived, I had decided I would steal the memory of your daughter’s birth.” My breath choked in my throat, but she carried on speaking. “It is such a delicious thing. Those are the richest memories. Every sense carries the recall - the pain, the joy, the smell of her hair and the taste of ice chips and ginger ale. But after the gift you have given me, after learning what you are… I’d like to offer a trade.”

I just stared at her, still shocked by her intentions. I wanted to scream, to throw her out, to punch her. I wanted to destroy her. 

“What?” I managed to grind out between gritted teeth. “What could you possibly have to offer me?”

Madison stood up and crossed the space around the table to stand beside me. She reached out to grip my shoulder. 

“I’ll take the memory of her death from you. You wouldn’t have to have the flashbacks, or the pain, or the anger. Not from that event. You’d still know she’s gone, of course… but you wouldn’t have the picture of how.” 

Her voice was still flat and hollow, as it had been the every time she had spoken during her stay. I considered her offer. I considered never replaying that moment - never remembering the gap between my fingers and her backpack. I considered never remembering the sound of the impact. I considered never reliving the exact pain of that exact moment ever again. 

“No.” My voice came out as flat and hollow and filled with pain to mirror hers. “The memory and the pain makes me human.”

She smiled, still standing close to me, still gripping my shoulder. The smile was wide, almost mocking. It made my hair stand on end. 

“If you say so,” she purred, and I shuddered, and then she retreated out of the dining room. I heard the front door open and swing shut. 

Madison the memory-eater was gone. I could still remember the birth of my child, all of her birthdays, my wedding day, and her death. It seemed she let me off easy. 

By the time Laurie came downstairs for breakfast, I had recovered my composure and made her a comforting breakfast of oatmeal and scrambled eggs. We ate and chatted idly about the weather, the cold, the snow. The inconvenience of awful roads for travel plans. The loneliness of a Christmas spent without being among family. 

“Not next year, though,” Laurie said, her voice light and content. “I will be with my family then. And if it snows in Florida, God help us all!” 

And that was it. 

It was rare that I had a truly content guest here, a guest whose only crossroad was deciding whether to follow through on a plan toward a different but happier future. Laurie was one of those guests. She was a needed breath of fresh air. 

Laurie M. from Downeast Maine is almost certainly settled with her long lost love in Tampa now, living the snowbird life with friends and forming a new family. She departed soon after breakfast and thanked me repeatedly, leaving behind a sizable tip. 

Now that the holidays have settled, I’ll be back to sharing more of my stories from the years more regularly. Forgive me for the little winter break - we all need one from time to time!
