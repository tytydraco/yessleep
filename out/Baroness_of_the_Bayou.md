Now for those who enjoys everything dark and the maccab. This is a story for you. 

Tonight's the night going to be a good catch. And I hope it'll be a good one. As I got out of my cabin here in the outskirts of Louisiana. I got everything prepared. Cooler, net, you name it. And of course gotta put some fuel in the engine. My goodness, it's hotter than the devil's ass out here at night. But as I was driving my boat straight to the bayou it suddenly got 86'd.  I've got to start paddlin' my boat. Gonna catch some crawfish here at night. Is going to be a big surprise for the folks. 

because today is crawfish season. But! Sometimes I wonder why I am still a fisherman. The catch is getting hard out here in the bayou. I mean, I haven't seen any big catfish, bass, or bowfin. Heck! I haven't seen a goddamn gator out in this bitch. Wait a sec over there; is that a wooden log cabin on an island?


And why so many boats? Let's check out what's going on. It is weird seeing all these boats out here at night. I don't know what's going on, even though it's none of my business. But! Curiosity has always gotten the best of us. And even though I have been in these parts before, And that this wooden log cabin hasn't been used in ages. And now seeing all these boats here makes me suspicious.


 And I know I ain't no cop. But I've got to go check it out. It's funny, since this old shack was used before by some crazed Voodoo witch doctor. And I have to admit that I have come across a fair share of strange things in my life. Especially when I was just a kid. Including hearing strange stories that my own grandpa once told me and my siblings.


 but when it comes to Voodoo and hoodoo, one has to be very careful with it. Including when black magic is involved. And let me tell you. I have seen some of it, and I don't like it. I may not be a religious man. But I do believe in a good Lord. And I hope for anyone or anybody that they don't get close to it.
 

Alright, I counted twenty boats docked. Now if I were to assume that 15 were in it, and if my math is correct, shit, three hundred souls. Christ, I hope there's not more than that or armed
 

So I've got to stay focused. carefully rowing towards these tree stumps sticking out of the water, hoping that no one would take notice. Being a good distance away from it, I tied up my boat to a tree stump and got into the water without making a splash. began swimming heedfully. 


I pray to the Lord himself that no alligator or alligator gar can get to me. The last thing I need is to become its dinner. And what makes it worse for me is that I heard about a bull shark being spotted in the Mississippi River. And to make matters worse, this goddamn bayou is only a few miles away from that very spot.
 
 
As I swam so close to this cabin, I could hear a conversation coming from within. Heedfully, I came towards the back and spotted a small window. I climbed up without uttering a sound. But!  To my surprise, I found a hole in the wall as a streak of light pierced through it. Vigilant, I looked around to see if anyone was near me. Knowing that everything was clear, I peered through that very hole.


 Inside were three men preparing for their ceremony. But these three guys are big. like if they spend so much time at the gym. As I do not want to be seen by them, since they'll probably kick my chubby ass.
 

"Hurry up; we can't be late for the ceremony." She'll be pissed if we don't show up.
 

"Relax, Tom; we ain't going to be late." We've got to do this right."
  

"Enough of the talking; we're going to take forever."
 

"Alright, alright. Jesus, dude, don't be a little bitch about the goddamn time. We're good."
 

Watching them finish up with their face paint, the men stood up with some final preparations and headed towards the back door. There, I immediately hid on the side of the log cabin. The three men were now done with their traditional makeup and walked out of the back door as they headed straight to the woods, walking on a dirt path. It's weird that they're walking barefoot. knowing that there are cottonmouths around these parts. And let me tell you: It's better not to walk barefoot in the swamp.
  

 
I followed the three men into the woods, a few feet behind them. I saw a yellowish-orange glow coming from the woods, and as he got closer to it, he began to hear a lively commotion coming from there. I found a good spot where I could position myself to hide from the others while still maintaining a good view from behind the foliage. There I saw a large congregation of people around the campfire that was well over 300, with torches circling behind them. This is a freaking congregation. And on the other side of the great campfire was a cabin, with idols in front of it. Something serious was about to happen. Was this some sort of voodoo cult ceremony?
 

Like, my god, there are so many of them in this big ass congregation of these voodoo worshippers. I've got to take out my phone from this pocket, which was inside a Ziploc bag. But what I saw walking out of this cabin was a beautiful Creole woman, wearing a quadrille dress, a neck full of jewelry, and rings on her finger. followed by two naked people. One was a heavyset man; the second was this voluptuous, brunette Asian woman with those huge, ridiculous knockers on her chest. When the Creole woman began to speak.
 

"Tonight will be a great night. As these two poor sinners will offer themselves. For Baron Samedi." She said,
 

"For Baron Samedi," repeated the crowd.
 

"Introduce yourselves, and speak of who you are. First you, my heavyset man."

 
"I am Frank, and I like New Orleans. And I have been such a stupid, gluttonous drunk that I have abused myself and others, including my own family. But I am willing to give up my life for Baron Samedi." The man was sweating as he spoke nervously.
 

"Tch, tch, tch. Now you, my large-bosomed woman." Said the
 

"My name is Lin. I have been a fool for spending all of my husband's money for breast enhancement surgery while he was on his deathbed. Now I regret having these enormous double x cups. And it's hard to breathe. Due to my sin, I wanted to give up my life to Baron Samedi " Said she.
 

"Thank you. "Lin, though we don't need to know that much," said the Voodoo priestess, who was a little annoyed by hearing such a long detail.
 

"Sorry, madam," said Lin, nervously smiling.
 

"Well, you heard that, my children. These two poor souls have sinned. But thanks to them, they opened up to me and will be cleansed."
 

This Creole woman—is she some sort of Voodoo priestess or something? If she is, then I think tonight is going to be a bad night.
 
 
"My children, tonight we must offer these poor, pathetic souls to the great one, Baron Samedi." Until I demonstrate the power that he has given me and until I execute this ritual, I will perform this act. But soon there will be a special ritual for which you have all waited a long time.
 

"There we shall behold his great power... for Baron Samedi." She cried
 

"For Baron Samedi!" The crowd shouted
 

"For Baron Samedi," she repeated.
 

"For Baron Samedi, for Baron Samedi, for Baron Samedi!" The crown continues.
 

There I saw those three men from earlier walking towards the three others and sitting in place with drums before them. Given a nod to start by the cult priest. They began by beating their drums little by little. One of the servants presented a grimoire to her. Now holding the heavy book in her hands, she began to pray as it suddenly opened by itself.
 
 
She began to speak in her incantations as the pages began to glow. And to my surprise, the book began levitating right before her as she chanted. I couldn't comprehend what the hell I just saw. Her eyes glowed as she read the page that was selected for her ritual.
 

The drummers began to pick up the pace. Two voodoo dolls were placed before the voodoo priestess. The first one to be chosen was the fat doll, which represented Frank, the heavyset man. grabbed her pouch and blew out a gray powder that made him go into a deep trance. With her alluring voice and with his whole body possessed, Frank stood right before her as she held a pin in her hand and pierced the doll's abdomen. The heavyset man gasped as if he himself had been stabbed.
 

Unfortunately, at first, I couldn't make out what was actually happening until I finally glanced and saw that not only was the voodoo priestess horizontally cutting the doll's own abdomen but also that of the man's. I saw the first victim's abdomen literally split open from left to right. Blood vomited out of it; like a gruesome mouth smiling wide open, the voodoo queen removed his intestines with her own bare hands as she chanted her dark incantations.


 With blood and bile coming from his cavernous abdomen, she tore out his stomach. And then digging in deeper as she finally removed his enlarged liver. Stretching her shoulders, she held the enlarged fatty liver over her head. Holding my smartphone, my jaw dropped as I became speechless, observing with open eyes in horror.
 

"Gade kochon sa a, gade zantray li... sagre li te ye, paske se peche l. gade kochon sa a, gade zantray li. Pou salte li pral manje. Paske se lanm ki pral devore l''nan machwè li''.

 
feeling the warmth of the oversized organ in her hands, praying with her eyes closed,  as the dead man's entire digestive system steamed on the muddy floor. Of them not caring about the stink of bodily fluids and bile. The drummers continued on beating their drums, and the congregation began to cheer for their gruesome queen. Jesus fuckin Christ. That fucker is gutted like a pig. Until one of the priests grabbed his bolo machete, raised it over his shoulders, and cut the man's head off.
 

There, the congregation continued to cheer as she kicked the digestive organs onto the floor while she grinned. She ordered the big man to return to his spot. I have to muster what I've just seen.
 
 
I'm trying to calm myself down as I continue to witness black magic being performed while holding my phone. shit! 32 percent left. I have to resort to taking pictures. There, the voodoo priestess raised her arms. Everyone suddenly stopped, indicating her next approach. She nodded her head to the drummers.
 

There they began to beat their drums slowly, giving off a rhythm that sounded like a heartbeat. She walked in the direction of that Asian woman with those ridiculous saline implants. I mean, who in their right mind would want to have that. Holy shit! Is that what's going to happen next? Right there, her veins began pulsing from her chest. I don't like the look of this. Until then, the drummers had begun to increase the volume of their beats.
 
 
"I…I-I am s-scared." Lin spoke

 
"Don't be my child. All this will be over quickly. But your heart will no longer belong to you. As your heart now belongs to Baron Samedi. and Baron Samedi is in need of it." Said the priestess.

 
"Yes, madam. My heart belongs to Baron Samedi." She stuttered.

 
Watching her shed tears from her widened eyes, Lin trembled in fear, regretting the mistake she had made. She began to weep. First, the voodoo priestess raised her hand by caressing Lin's cheeks; there, she placed her hand in between Lin's breasts. As if her mind was scanning for what to do next. One priest came before her. holding the doll that represented the Asian woman in his hand.

 
The voodoo priestess turned her head around, looking at the priest holding the voodoo doll. With a smirk on her face and her left hand free. Took out a pin, gripping it tightly, and pierced the love-shaped heart on the voodoo dolls' chests. Lin immediately clenched her chest with both hands, reacting to the sharp pain she just felt. I mean why can't she just run away. Sure theres allot of them, but at least try to escape.

 
Everyone was suddenly quiet except for Lin, who was crying after feeling that sharp pain. Six minutes passed, as I saw the voodoo priestess, who I believed to be was feeling Lin's heartbeat in her right hand. Watching with her gentle eyes open at the sight of the weeping woman began chanting.

 
To my utter surprise, the voodoo priestess plunged her hand deep within the Asian woman's chest cavity, clawing right inside of it like a bear digging in for honey that was inside a tree. While hearing Lin screaming at the top of her lungs by pulling her head back. 
 

Annoyed that she was almost in between Lin's large breasts, she placed her left hand within the woman's chest cavity, digging inside. The voodoo priestess's eyes widened with sheer excitement as she finally stopped. Lin's body was trembling with so much distress. Seeing her eyes bulge out of terror, looking up to the sky hoping that God would save her, then lowering her head down looking at the priestess. Lin wheezed through her mouth until she took one gulp of air.
 

She paused a bit, then with some difficulty. The voodoo priestess pulled her body back, with the sound of a loud pop, she finally ripped both of her hands out of Lin's chest. Whereupon Lin again gave out a loud final scream that echoed throughout the woods. The Voodoo priestess watched with menacing eyes. As in her hands was the gift that she longed for. With her arms quivering, the Voodoo priestess couldn't hold back the volume of her great excitement.

 
Then I saw it. Holding something big with both hands over her head. My eyes were now clearly fixated of what it was. Thumping thunderously hot, was Lin's massively, globular enlarged heart. bigger than a man's head, if not twice as large. with its grotesquely dilated aneurysms of the fusiform superior vena cava, grapefruit-sized aorta, and with that large, plump pulmonary artery. all throbbing and pulsating on their own. And hanging down from Lin's oversized heart was also the aneurysms of the dilated inferior vena cava, and alongside it was that massive thoracoabdominal aorta, with those webs of pulmonary veins dangling from each side.


Her hot blood gushing out from those veins and arteries with each heartbeat, while steaming down on the priestess's arms. Now I may be a fisherman, but I was once a medic in the National Guard. So I know what I was looking at. But, Jesus Christ. 
 
 
There, I saw the cultists erupt in cheers and joyous howls. They were filled with so much amusement, catching sight of the power conducted by the voodoo priestess. Contemplating the monstrosity of Lin's enlarged heart with the aneurysms of its great blood vessels. She firmly grasped it in her hands like a panther on its prey. However, I could see that, to her astonishment, Lin's heart was somewhat heavy as well by seeing her arms tremble. I mean, but still. Lin looked up at the sky once again and collapsed to the floor. Now laying dead on the muddy floor with a yawning hole in her chest.
 

"Behold my children, and gaze upon the throbbing beast I have removed from Lin's chest; with its great size now in the palms of my hands. Thanks to the great power you have, Baron Samedi." said the voodoo priestess.
 
 
Thus the Voodoo priestess began chanting, as she stood over the Asian woman's corpse. But why is her heart still beating? Until I noticed that it was her chanting that was making it. And does that grimoire have something to do with it? Either way I don't like the look of it.
 
 
"Gade gwo jennès ki nan men mwen an, lap bat, lap bat... Gade gwo jennès ki nan men mwen an, lap bat, lap bat. Kè fanm sa se yon kochon, gade jan li gwo, gade jan li gra. gade jennès sa a gra, "Gade jan gwo ak lou, Li ap bat, Li ap bat. Kè fanm sa se yon kochon, gade jan li gwo, gade jan li gra. gade jennès sa a gra, "Gade jan gwo ak lou, Li ap bat, Li ap bat." Chanted the Voodoo priestess.
 
 
The Voodoo priestess turned around, walking before the crowd, presenting the congregation the organ she just extracted, to which they danced with utter excitement. While some shed tears of happiness and with the others began singing. It was the most disgusting and disturbing scene I had ever seen.
 
 
The drummers began beating their drums, becoming increasingly frenzied as their cheers grew louder and more chaotic. I was disgusted at the very sight of it, to see how people can lower themselves to such levels. They should all be punished for the crimes they have participated in. Some began to dance wildly around the campfire, while others fell to their knees.
  
 
The voodoo priestess, chanting ever faster. growing louder and more fervent. Lin's heart is trying to pick up it's pace by beating wildly faster, but it's severe condition is too much for it. I locked eyes on that scene as if it were almost captivating, if not mesmerizing. As if it is trying to pull me in. Hearing the alluring rhythms of those drumbeats was spellbinding. The crowd cried with their menaced exhilaration. The winds picked up strength, with the roar of thunder and a crack of lightning piercing through the night sky.


 Dark storm clouds gathered. Then the rain began to pour down tremendously. She raises and lowers her hands repeatedly, her voice growing louder and more fervent, not holding back her sheer vehemence. Her wicked eyes widen as she contemplates on how oversized the enlarged heart is, thumping wildly in her grasp, while shaking its great dilated vessels back and forth.
 
 
With total exhilaration, swaying her gorgeous black hair. The power of her god, Baron Samedi, now flows within her. The beating of the drums and the people dancing before the great campfire I have seen crazy things in my lifetime. Sure, one of them may have been paranormal, I think, as I have seen voodoo ceremonies before. But seeing so much gore was too much, and I served in Iraq back in 04.
 
 
 But! This was something else—a horror that only hell itself can provide. With a crack of lightning and feeling the cold air blowing upon him. I shivered, knowing the prospect of cold rain. But the congregation was undaunted and continued. Fucking great. I totally forgot it was monsoon season. I pray to God that it won't flood here
 
 
I felt the first droplets of rain, and gradually it rained straight away. soaking everyone in the area. The trees stretched and swayed in the winds as the sound of thunder and the crack of lightning streaked throughout the heavens.
The storm raged on as the rain pounded on the entire congregation, but the drummers weren't fazed and continued beating on their drums.
 
 
A young cult woman was so hysterical that she whirled and danced in front of them. It's time for me to get out of here. But I took one final look. Drenched in water, the voodoo queen was still chanting as the cold rain poured down.
 
 
As the chanting reaches a crescendo,
Smiling with a wicked expression on her face. The thumping Enlarged heart and its great dilated vessels reduced it's beating and immediately inflated as it finally ceased. The Voodoo priestess laughed as she smacked it. It looked like a huge ball of meat covered in veins. 
 
 
A priest came before her holding a large, decorative, wood-carved box. placed the inflated, enlarged heart within this box, and by doing so, the servant with the jar poured a liquid substance inside the wooden container to preserve the heart and its blood vessels.
 
 
I was already soaked to the bone and starting to tremble because of the cold rain, and he began to feel something prickle in my nose when he sneezed out loud. by echoing through the ceremony. Everyone stopped; the voodoo queen was dismayed by this sudden interruption.
  

Who dares intrude?" She said it angrily.
 
 
The voodoo priestess yelled, wanting to know.
The congregation became absolutely dumbfounded, chattering among themselves about this unexpected intrusion. I was hiding behind a tree, covering my mouth and nose, wishing that he had not done that.
 
 
But I saw this as a window of opportunity to
escape, and as they are now distracted, I took my chance. I was drenched in cold water, regained my composure, and I tried my utmost best not to make any commotion. I had to walk into the woods as the dirt path was way too obvious. 
 
"Find the intruder, and tie him up" 

 
"Search over here."

 
"Guys, go to the path. We may catch this one there."

 
"Dammit, the rain is making it hard."
 

"Bring out the dogs"


Ah shit I gotta go now before those dogs pick up my scent. as I high tailed outta there, I could hear their voices searching for me. But I gotta throw my ass straight back to my boat, fast. If they send in the hounds. Then I will be captured. I crawled deep into the woods, thankfully the sound of rain and thunder was blocking the noise I was making. at ease when I spotted the same log cabin from before. I took a deep breath, jumped into the water, and swam to my boat. Knowing there are a few seconds remaining until they realize my fresh footprints Untying my boat, I paddled away.
 

 yet my only advantage is the darkness and downpour of rain. I rowed as fast as I could, but to the sound of rain. Yet I could still hear their voices, trying to find me. I used every bit of strength I had left. I gave out a deep sigh of relief, as I was already further away than expected. The coast was truly clear. Never again should I go to these parts. 
 
 
I ultimately arrived at my truck. unplugged the inflatable raft and threw it at the back. turned on the ignition and drove away from the spot, seeing only 4 percent battery life left. slapped the only charger I got on and hauled ass.
 
 
 
End.
