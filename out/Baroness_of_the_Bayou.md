I walked out of my cabin here in the outskirts of Louisiana. As I was prepared for hunting crawfish Since today is that season. from bringing a Cooler, to a net and with other necessary items. And of course I gotta put some fuel in my boat's engine. Since, it's better to do it at night. 
But holy shit, it's hotter than the devil's ass out here. And as I was about to drive my boat straight into the bayou , the engine suddenly got 86'd. There I begin to start paddling' my boat, cause that crawfish ain't gonna catch themselves. But what I do know is that it Is going to be a big surprise for the folks back home. 


 But! Sometimes I wonder why I am still a fisherman. The catch is getting hard out here in the bayou. I mean, I haven't seen any big catfish, bass, or bowfin in weeks. Heck! I haven't seen a goddamn gator out here.  But then I spotted a log cabin. With so many boats in front. 


And why so many boats? Though it is weird seeing all them here at night. I know it's none of my business. But! Curiosity has always gotten the best of me. And since I have been in these parts before. But never in my life where i saw all of these boats docked here at night. Especially in an isolated area. But why this wooden log cabin. It got me thinking. I remember that this cabin hasn't been used in ages. And now seeing all these boats here makes me suspicious.


 And I know I ain't no cop. But I've got to go check it out. It's funny, since this old shack was used before by some crazed Voodoo witch doctor. And I have to admit that I have come across a fair share of strange things in my life. Especially when I was just a kid. Including hearing strange stories that my own grandpa once told me about.


 but when it comes to Voodoo and hoodoo, one has to be very careful with it. Including when black magic is involved. And let me tell you. I have seen some of it, and I don't like it. I may not be a religious man. But I do believe in the good Lord. And I hope this is not the case.


Alrighty then, I have counted twenty boats that are docked. Now if I were to assume that 15 were in it, and if my math is correct, shit, three hundred souls. Christ, I hope there's not more than that or armed to the teeth.
 

So I've got to stay focused. carefully rowing towards these tree stumps sticking out of the water, hoping that no one would take notice. Being at a good distance away from it, I tied up my boat to a tree stump, and got into the water without making a splash. And began swimming carefully. 


I pray to the Lord himself that no alligator or alligator gar can get to me. As the last thing I need is to become its dinner. And to make it worse for me, is that I've heard about a bull shark being spotted in the Mississippi River. And to make matters worse, this goddamn bayou is only a few miles away from that very spot.
 
 
As I swam so close to this cabin, I could hear a conversation coming from within. Heedfully, I came towards the back and spotted a small window. I climbed up without uttering a sound. But!  To my surprise, I found a hole in the wall as a streak of light pierced through it. Vigilant, I looked around to see if anyone was near me. Knowing that everything was clear, I peered through that very hole.


 Inside were three men preparing for their ceremony. But these three guys are big. like as if they spend so much time at the gym. Plus I don't want to be seen by any of them, since they'll probably kick my chubby ass.
 
 

Watching them finish up with their face paint, the men stood up with some final preparations and headed towards the back door. There, I immediately hid on the side of the log cabin. The three men were now done with their traditional makeup, and walked out of the back door as they headed straight to the woods, by walking on a dirt path. It's weird that they're walking barefoot. knowing that there are cottonmouths around these parts. And let me tell you: It's better not to walk barefoot in the swamp.
  

 
I followed the three men into the woods, a few feet behind them. There I saw a yellowish-orange glow coming from the woods, and as i got closer to it, I began to hear a lively commotion coming from there. I found a good spot where I could position myself, only to hide from the others while still maintaining a good view from behind the foliage. There I saw a large congregation of people around the campfire that was well over 300, with torches circling behind them. And on the other side of the great campfire was a cabin, with idols in front of it. Something serious was about to happen. And the one thing that came to my mind was, that this is a voodoo ceremony.
 

Like, my god, there are so many of them in this big ass congregation of voodoo worshippers. I've taken out my phone from my pocket, which was inside a Ziploc bag. But what I saw walking out of this cabin was a beautiful Creole woman, wearing a quadrille dress, a neck full of jewelry, and rings on her finger. followed by two naked people. One was a heavyset man; and the second was this voluptuous, brunette Asian woman with those huge, ridiculous knockers on her chest. When the Creole woman began to speak. They introduced themselves as Frank and Lin.
 

This Creole womanâ€”is she some sort of Voodoo priestess or something? If she is, then I think tonight is going to be a bad night.

 
There I saw those three men from earlier walking towards the three others and sitting in place with drums before them. Given a nod to start by the cult priest. They began by beating their drums little by little. One of the servants presented a grimoire to her. Now holding the heavy book in her hands, she began to pray as it suddenly opened by itself.
 
 
She began to speak in her incantations as the pages began to glow. And to my surprise, the book began levitating right before her as she chanted. I couldn't comprehend what the hell I just saw. Her eyes glowed as she read the page that was selected for her ritual.
 

The drummers began to pick up the pace. Two voodoo dolls were placed before the voodoo priestess. The first one to be chosen was a fat doll, which represented Frank, the heavyset man. There she grabbed her pouch and blew out a gray powder that made him go into a deep trance. With her alluring voice and with his whole body possessed, Frank stood right before her as she held a pin in her hand and pierced the doll's abdomen. The heavyset man gasped as if he himself had been stabbed.
 

Unfortunately, at first, I couldn't make out what was actually happening, until I finally saw what was happening. Not only was the voodoo priestess horizontally cutting the doll's own abdomen but also that of the man's. I saw the first victim's abdomen literally split open from left to right. Blood vomited out of it; like a gruesome mouth smiling wide open, as the voodoo priestess removed his intestines with her own bare hands, as she chanted her dark incantations.


 With blood and bile coming out from his cavernous abdomen, she tore out his stomach. And then digging in deeper as she finally removed his enlarged liver. Stretching her shoulders, she held the enlarged fatty liver over her head. Holding my smartphone, my jaw dropped as I became speechless, observing with open eyes in horror.
 


 As I watched the oversized organ in her hands, praying with her eyes closed,  as the dead man's entire digestive system steamed on the muddy floor. Of them not caring about the stink of bodily fluids and bile. The drummers continued on beating their drums, and the congregation began to cheer for their gruesome queen. Jesus fuckin Christ. That fucker is gutted like a pig. Until one of the priests grabbed his bolo machete, raised it over his shoulders, and cut the man's head off.
 

There, the congregation continued to cheer as she kicked the digestive organs onto the floor while she grinned. She ordered the big man to return to his spot. I have to muster what I've just seen. I was scared of what was going on. As my body froze in the bushes.
 
 
As I'm trying to calm myself down,  I continued on to witness black magic being performed while holding my phone. shit! 32 percent left. I have to resort to taking pictures. My hands was shaking by what I just witnessed.There, the voodoo priestess raised her arms. Everyone suddenly stopped, indicating her next approach. She nodded her head to the drummers.
 

There they began to beat their drums slowly, giving off a rhythm that sounded like a heartbeat. She walked in the direction of that Asian woman with those large ridiculous breasts with saline implants. I mean, who in their right mind would want to have that. Holy shit! Is that what's going to happen next? I don't like the look of this. Until then, the drummers had begun to increase the volume of their beats.

 
Watching her shed tears from her widened eyes, Lin trembled in fear, regretting the mistake she had made. She began to weep. First, the voodoo priestess raised her hand by caressing Lin's cheeks; there, she then placed her hand in between Lin's breasts. As if her mind was scanning for what to do next. One priest came before her. holding the doll that represented the Asian woman in his hand.

 
The voodoo priestess turned her head around, looking at the priest holding the voodoo doll. With a smirk on her face and her left hand free. Took out a pin, gripping it tightly, and pierced the love-shaped heart on the voodoo dolls' chests. Lin immediately clenched her chest with both hands, reacting to the sharp pain she just felt. I mean why can't she just run away. Sure theres allot of them, but at least try to escape.

 
Everyone was suddenly quiet except for Lin, who was crying after feeling that sharp pain. Six minutes passed, as I saw the voodoo priestess, who I believed to be was feeling Lin's heartbeat in her right hand. Watching with her gentle eyes open at the sight of the weeping woman began chanting.

 
To my utter surprise, the voodoo priestess plunged her hand deep within the Asian woman's chest cavity. clawing right inside of it like a bear digging in for honey that was inside of a tree. While hearing Lin screaming at the top of her lungs by pulling her head back. 
 

Annoyed that she was almost in between Lin's large breasts, she placed her left hand within the woman's chest cavity, digging inside. The voodoo priestess's eyes widened with sheer excitement as she finally stopped. Lin's body was trembling with so much distress. Seeing her eyes bulging out of terror, looking up to the sky hoping that God would save her, then lowering her head back down while looking at the priestess. Lin wheezed through her mouth until she took one gulp of air.
 

She paused a bit, then with some difficulty. The voodoo priestess pulled her body back, with the sound of a loud pop, she finally ripped both of her hands out of Lin's chest. Whereupon Lin again gave out a loud final scream that echoed throughout the woods. The Voodoo priestess watched with menacing eyes. As in her hands was the gift that she longed for. With her arms quivering, the Voodoo priestess couldn't hold back the volume of her great excitement.

 
Then I saw it. Holding something big with both hands over her head. My eyes were now clearly fixated of what it was. Thumping thunderously hot, was Lin's massively, globular enlarged heart. bigger than a man's head, if not twice as large. with its grotesquely dilated aneurysms of the fusiform superior vena cava, grapefruit-sized aorta, and with that large, plump pulmonary artery. all throbbing and pulsating on their own. And hanging down from Lin's oversized heart was also the aneurysms of the dilated inferior vena cava, and alongside it was that massive thoracoabdominal aorta, with those webs of pulmonary veins dangling from each side.


Her hot blood gushing out from those veins and arteries with each heartbeat, while steaming down on the priestess's arms. Now I may be a fisherman, but I was once a medic in the National Guard. So I know what I was looking at. But, Jesus Christ this is getting way out of hand. 
 
 
There, I saw the cultists erupt in cheers and joyous howls. They were filled with so much amusement, catching sight of the power conducted by the voodoo priestess. Contemplating the monstrosity of Lin's enlarged heart with the aneurysms of its great blood vessels. She firmly grasped it in her hands like a panther on its prey. However, I could see that, to her astonishment, Lin's heart was somewhat heavy as well by seeing her arms tremble. I mean, but still. Lin looked up at the sky once again and collapsed to the floor. Now laying dead on the muddy floor with a yawning hole in her chest.
 
 
Thus the Voodoo priestess began chanting, as she stood over the Asian woman's corpse. But why is her heart still beating? Until I noticed that it was her chanting that was making it. And does that grimoire have something to do with it? Either way I don't like the look of it.
 
 
 
Seeing the Voodoo priestess turned around, walking before the crowd, presenting the congregation the organ she just extracted, to which they danced with utter excitement. While some shed tears of happiness and with the others began singing. It was the most disgusting and disturbing scene I had ever seen.
 
 
The drummers began beating their drums, becoming increasingly frenzied as their cheers grew louder and more chaotic. I was disgusted at the very sight of it, to see how people can lower themselves to such levels. They should all be punished for the crimes they have participated in. Some began to dance wildly around the campfire, while others fell to their knees.
  
 
The voodoo priestess, chanting ever faster. growing louder and more fervent. Lin's heart is trying to pick up it's pace by beating wildly faster, but it's severe condition was too much for it. I locked my eyes onto that scene, as if it were almost captivating, if not mesmerizing. As if it is trying to pull me in. Hearing the alluring rhythms of those drumbeats was spellbinding. The crowd cried with their menaced exhilaration. The winds picked up strength, with the roar of thunder and a crack of lightning piercing through the night sky.


There I can see Dark storm clouds gathering. With the rain beginning to pour down tremendously. She raises and lowers her hands repeatedly, her voice growing louder and more fervent, not holding back her sheer vehemence. Her wicked eyes widen as she contemplates on how oversized the enlarged heart is, thumping wildly in her grasp, while shaking its great dilated vessels back and forth.
 
 
With total exhilaration, swaying her gorgeous black hair. The power of her god, Baron Samedi, now flows within her. The beating of the drums and the people dancing before the great campfire I have seen crazy things in my lifetime. But seeing so much gore was too much, and I served in Iraq back in 04.
 
 
 But! This was something elseâ€”a horror that only hell itself can provide. With a crack of lightning and feeling the cold air blowing upon me. I shivered, knowing the prospect of cold rain. But the congregation was undaunted and continued. Fucking great. I totally forgot it was also monsoon season. I pray to God that it won't flood here
 
 
I felt how cold the rain is. soaking everyone in the area. The trees stretched and swayed by the winds, as the sound of thunder and the crack of lightning streaked throughout the heavens.
The storm raged on as the rain pounded on the entire congregation, but the drummers weren't fazed and continued on beating their drums.
 
 
A young cult woman was so hysterical that she whirled and danced in front of them. It's time for me to get out of here. But I took one final look. Drenched in water, the voodoo queen was still chanting as the cold rain poured down.
 
 
As the chanting reaches a crescendo,
Smiling with a wicked expression on her face. The thumping Enlarged heart and its great dilated vessels reduced it's beating and immediately inflated as it finally ceased. The Voodoo priestess laughed as she smacked it. Looking like a huge ball of meat covered in veins. 
 
 
A priest came before her holding a large, decorative, wood-carved box. placed the inflated, enlarged heart within this box, and by doing so, the servant with a jar in hand, poured a liquid substance inside the wooden container to preserve the heart and its blood vessels.
 
 
I was already soaked to the bone and starting to tremble because of the cold rain, and i began to feel something prickle in my nose when he sneezed out loud. by echoing through the ceremony. Everyone stopped; the voodoo priestess was dismayed by this sudden interruption. Now I was in deep shit. My heart was in my throat when I have done that. And I can't believe I let myself sneeze out loud. Now they're gonna really get me. 
 

 
The voodoo priestess was angry and wanted to know who interrupted her ceremony.
The congregation became absolutely dumbfounded, chattering among themselves about this unexpected intrusion. I was hiding behind a tree, covering my mouth and nose, wishing that he had not done that.
 

 Until one of the members of the crowd spotted me behind the bushes. There he yelled out to the voodoo priestess, pointing right at me where I was hiding. and now everyone was heading straight towards my direction. Seeing the entirety of the whole congregation descending upon me. With the floor thick with mud, As I was now running for my life. I did not want to experience the same outcome as the two first victims. As I was now running for my life. I have never been this scared in my life. Heck! It was nothing like this when I was a soldier and medic back in Iraq.  But the only difference was, when I was in the front lines I had a weapon and body armor with fellow comrades having my back. But right here I felt entirely vulnerable. I have become prey to these worshipers and to their God.


If they were to send in the hounds. Then my life would be over. When I begin to see silhouettes running towards me. They were actually gaining up. As I spotted the same log cabin from before. However I felt a hand grabbing me by the shoulder. It was one of the voodoo worshipers. There he wrestled me to the ground, trying to get a good hold on me. I had to fight with my own bare hands. And I only had one thing in mind; and that is to live.Yet I could still hear the voices of his fellow colleagues getting closer. I had to get this guy off of me. There I used every ounce of strength I had left on me. I punched this guy's face, until I grabbed a rock from the ground and slammed on his face. But it was not over yet I could see them come ever closer.

 There I jumped into the water, and swam towards my boat. Knowing there are a few seconds remaining. And this time I didn't care if they were alligators in this swamp. I kept on swimming, when the rain poured down on me hoping to use the complete darkness of this bayou. And when I finally got to see them coming, I took a deep breath and swam underwater.  I didn't know how far I swam. And in fact I don't know where I was going. But it had to be far away from them.

Yet I was losing air and I could no longer hold it. I swam back up, when I spotted my boat. Was this an act of God. I don't know. But I had to paddle away and never again should I go to these parts again. I ultimately arrived at my truck. unplugged the inflatable raft and threw it at the back. turned on the ignition and drove away from the spot, and hauled ass. I didn't look back as I kept on driving as fast as I could. I took a deep sigh of relief when I was finally out of a good distance.

And when I arrived home. I threw myself on the couch all wet and tired. It was the most horrifying scene that I have ever experienced. I used up all of my strength just to get home. I have no energy left in me. Until I begin to have this bad headache. As if someone was piercing me with...pins. I stood up with eyes wide open. With a million thoughts of running through my mind as I wondered if one of them had followed me home. Or do they know where I actually live. Until I begin to hear scratches coming from the outside. I stood there frozen like a statue. With something tapping on my windows. I did not want to know what was out there. Until I fell down to my knees, as the headache was becoming too excruciating. My whole body felt numb. I could feel something in my bones that didn't feel right. When I begin to hear chanting. As it grew louder and louder as it got closer. Until I heard a knock on my door. When all of a sudden I blacked out. 

The next morning I woke up still reeling with that pain in my head. But I lay down on the floor, not wanting to get up. I looked around me to see if there was someone in my house. Until I decided to get up and to see if there was anyone out there. And as I open my door. A cold shiver ran down my spine. What I saw lay before me in the floor was a voodoo doll.
