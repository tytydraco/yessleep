**Hi, my name is Harsh. A few days ago I received the news that my grandpa who had lung cancer had died his lawyer informed me that he had left his London estate for me. It was a big, wooden bungalow with a beautiful yard. As it was in central London close to where I lived I decided to shift to the house with my roommates Ethan and Ryan. When we shifted we divided the rooms between us 4 I got the 2nd-floor bedroom Ethan got the 1st-floor bedroom, Nathan and Ryan got the rooms on the ground floor. As we began to settle into our new house I went to check the attic it had a few antics that I could resell at a very high price and also a golden book labeled Remnivores: A Guild I flipped through the pages of the book to see what it was about it described a species of animals known as remnivores who lured their victims by manipulating their memories and making the victims trust them before stabbing them in the back. The remnivores are weaker than humans so their only hope of getting human prey to feed on is to manipulate us. However, they cannot alter the physical realm or the memories of people far away from them. the only way to kill remnivores is by breaking through their facade and performing a blood ritual to weaken the remnivore enough so it can get overpowered and killed.**

**But if you let remnivores get your trust you will die a horrible death. I closed the book and chuckled thinking of it as a fairy tale. Then I went into the other room the others were watching TV and I went to talk to my mom.**

**Mom: Hey son, how is your new home treating you and your roommates.**

**Me: yeah Mom it's pretty spacious. it will take a little getting used to but this place looks deserted with only four people in it.**

**Mom: oh you got a new roommate. What his name where is he from**

**Me: Mom there is no new roommate it's just me, Ethan, Ryan, and Nathan.**

**Mom: Nathan that's the first time I have heard that name but my memory is getting dull so I most probably just forgot about him.**

**Me: Yes Mom that must be the case.**

**Mom: And last thing your landlord called Don't forget to cancel your lease.**

**Me: OK Mom bye**

**Mom: Bye.**

**I disconnected the call and went to cancel the lease or my jerk landlord will renew it. When I went to do that and I read the agreement I wasn't able to find nathans name anywhere in the lease when I asked the land lored about it he informed me that no 4th person was living with us as the apartment was only able to accommodate 3 people at a time. This gave me a gut-wrenching feeling that the book had some truth to it and Nathan was in fact a** [**remnivore.so**](http://remnivore.so) **I invited Ryan and Ethan to a restaurant to discuss it with them. They didn't believe me at first as they remembered the time they had spent with them. but when I asked them to show me a photo with Nathan in it , they believed me. so we devised a plan to reveal to Nathan that we had broken through his illusion and killed him after performing the ritual. We went to the house to confront Nathan but we were met with blood and hoof marks all over the house. A deer carcass was lying on the table and there was Nathan in his true for a goat-human hybrid. As soon as he saw us he let out a blood-curdling scream which left us stunned for a moment than me and I rushed towards him to attack him while Ethan did the ritual and made the sacrifice. After that, Nathan was finally overpowered and killed but in his dying moment the remnivores say “Did you ever find the cause why people kept arriving in your life out of nowhere and tried to get close to you”.**
