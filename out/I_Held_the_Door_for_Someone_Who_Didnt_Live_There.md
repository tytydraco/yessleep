Nothing irks me more than having my hands full and needing to fumble for my key fob. It happens every morning, when I buy coffee for my boyfriend and I, and I have to balance the cardboard tray against my chest while I fish in my pockets for the keys.


That’s why I said yes to him.


The man was younger than I was–late thirties or early forties–but looked frail. White streaked his grey hair, like graphite smudged on an eraser.


“Excuse me–would you mind?” He asked, juggling two paper bags. “I’m on third floor and–”


“Of course, man. I was literally just complaining about this the other day.” I said, swiping my fob against the receiver. The doors slid open and we both strolled in together.


Our apartment building had both a staircase and an elevator. Naturally, with the load he was carrying, I assumed the man would take the elevator. The building had an outdated system and once you were in, the elevator just worked. No more key fobs required. But instead, he started shuffling towards the staircase.


“Wouldn’t it be easier to take the lift?”


“I’m not stupid, mate. If I wanted to take the elevators I would have taken them.” His blue eyes almost made him look handsome, but instead came off icy, like a husky. 


I threw up my hands. “Fuck, man. Fine. I was just offering.”


He made his way up the staircase as the elevator arrived on the ground floor, the door dinging open. I didn’t hop in. The more I thought about it, I wanted to get that guy's room number and report him to the landlord. I paid too much rent to get treated like that–especially with all the homophobic crap I put up with from my neighbours.


I made my way up the switchback staircase, pausing at each landing to crane my head around the corner and make sure he wasn’t there. I expected him to be on the third floor, where he said he lived, but the motion activated lights that turn on when you walk down the hallways were off. So, I continued up another flight to the fourth floor. My floor. Here, the lights were on. 


Out front of door 409, one room over from mine, was the man. He retrieved his key from his pocket and let himself inside.The two paper bags he’d been carrying were left on the floor outside.


Normally, I would have left it there. I had the room number–I could submit a complaint. But now that I knew he lived right next door, I didn’t want to invite that drama into my life.


I walked up to 409 and knocked on the door. My plan was to apologize for my social faux pas, even If I didn't really think I needed to, and use the grocery bags as my opening. Surely, he’d thank me after that, and we could go back to being peacefully unaware of one another’s existence.


No one answered the door, so I rapped my knuckles again. He’d just gone inside. I knew he could hear me. “Excuse me–your groceries.”


Again, there was no answer. I looked down at the bags. If there were perishables inside, I didn’t want them to spoil. Perhaps I could leave a note on his door and put the items in my fridge until he was ready to collect them.


I looked inside the first bag: a carton of four toothbrushes, a value pack of deodorant, several rolls of duct tape, and a spool of bin liner. The other bag was empty, which I thought was odd. He’d definitely been holding two full bags. I shrugged it off; maybe he left it outside intentionally, whatever his reasons.


I went inside my apartment, 408, and Greg helped me pack away our own groceries. We split a pack of Cass beer and I ranted about the stranger I met.


“How many times do I have to tell you? You scare people with that beard.” Greg chuckled.


“Good,” I finished a can and crushed it in my grip. “I’m a scary man.”


We both laughed at that, and then Greg, frowning, asked, “What happened to Elliot.”


“Whose Elliot?”


“Our neighbour.”


“Oh–maybe he moved out?”


“I saw him just the other day. I’m pretty sure he lives alone, too.”


I leaned back on the couch and thought for a moment. “We’re the last people to be judging two men sharing an apartment together. Maybe he got a roommate–or we have a new couple to brunch with.”


Greg scrunched his nose. “You’re right. I don’t know why I’m playing detective. Bed?”

“Bed.”


Later that night, while I was still wound tight in a roll of blankets, I suddenly felt Greg’s hand shaking me awake.


“What? What is it?” I groaned.


Greg looked at me wide eyed. “Check your phone–did you get the text too?”


I turned on my phone, blinking against the harsh light. On the screen was a message, an amber alert sent out by the police.


White male, caucasian, 5”9
Last seen 1 week ago.
Please contact authorities with any relevant information.


I unlocked the phone; attached to the message was a photo of Elliot.


When Greg and I ran outside, the paper bags were gone, and the door to 409 was wide open.


Based on the smell, I could guess what had been inside the second bag.


Bleach.
