My name is Will, and I used to be a career criminal and expert thief. I usually robbed small convenience stores or the occasional supermarket if I felt like dancing with death. The one and only time we decided to go to the bank was the last robbery and crime I ever committed.  
We had a small crew of criminal-born people that mainly consisted of violent maniacs. There were Ryan, Gale, Marcus, and Hank. They were extremely burly and weren't people you would expect to do good deeds just from how they looked. I was the only one in the crew that didn't have multiple face tattoos littering my body like an art canvas.  
The idea came up to go to our local bank when we were at Gales place. We were talking when Marcus piped up with, "Y'know, man, I don't want to hit any of those shitty gas stations anymore; I want to hit big. I'm talking about Natron National Bank. "I heard they've got some deposits of gold coming in soon. Maybe we can get in quiet and get out quickly." While I was mainly against this, the others agreed. After a few seconds of silent thinking, Hank opened up with, "I like that. We could map the sewer systems and see what goes where, and maybe we could make this a silent job."  
I was happy with that idea till Ryan said, "I worked in the sewer tunnels. They cemented around half the exits so people don't try to do what we are thinking. Regardless, they definitely have sensors or something. This has to be done loudly or else it won't work."  
After some discussion around the idea, I said, "You know guys, maybe it's best we don't do this. The feds could be expecting us, and if we get caught, we're in the slammer for life. Shouldn't we just relax?" The entire crew looked at me like I had just told them their family had died.  
"Don't be such a pussywill. Besides, we can do this quickly and get away with enough to set us all up for life. If you're not in, then you're going to have to go, bro." I sort of pondered for a moment before sighing and reluctantly agreeing. "Fine, but if we get ambushed or something, I'm ditching you guys." Everyone nodded their heads. When you are part of a criminal life, you don't stick around with a group for too long. They knew that.  
After around a week of planning, Gale had gotten a blueprint of the bank and the vault. The way it was set up was basically: through the entrance, there was a reception desk and a locket gate on the side. It was held up with a simple padlock system on the inside, and all staff members had a key. The vault was held together by a mechanism lock that had four steel rods that had to be individually unlocked and pulled down. It also had a combination wheel for safety. While this all seems extremely secure in hindsight, this was extremely poor protection for something of this value. Most people who know how a bank is protected would understand that.  
As we planned a bit more, we encountered a problem. They had bullet-proof glass on the reception desks, and this bank was a bit quieter, so hostages were at a low count. This was going to be a difficult hit to pull off, but they decided it was worth the risk.  
We suited up. We were adorned in black jackets and pants with a vest on the front and basic pistols and assault rifles. We wore balaclavas and goggles to ensure we would remain anonymous. After some final planning, we decided to hit the store a bit late. It was a risky move, I know. There was little to no chance of losing hostages, but it was the most time it could give us. As we were about to head to our van, Marcus said, "I've got something to show you all; come have a look." As we followed him, he took us to a back room with a duffel bag. When he unzipped it, he showed us a variety of C4 explosives. I was shaken. I immediately said, "What the fuck, Marcus, We don't need C4. We are hitting a bank, not starting doomsday."  
He got up in my face and said, "Shut the fuck up, pussy. We will use it in case shit gets hot. Don't tell me what to do." I looked at him before finally saying, "Fine. Do that. It'll be your fault if we get caught, though." And off we went to the van. As we loaded into the back, I started to feel anxious and paranoid. I had never robbed something larger than a Walmart, so the fact that we were driving to a heavily guarded bank with hundreds of thousands of dollars had me on edge.  
After around 10 minutes, Marcus said, "Alright, we're close. Are you ready for these guys?" It was silent for around 5 seconds before Ryan piped up: "I don't really know; I'm fucking nervous."  
As we all sat in silence, the tyres on the van came to a screeching halt, sending burning rubber into the air. Marcus then quietly said, "We are here. Yall suited up?" Everyone said "Yeah," and as we finally got out of the van, the shivers started to set in. I started to sweat uncontrollably as we slowly shuffled towards the bank doors. There were no guards out front, and it was dark, so we kept our weapons concealed.  
As we walked through the doors, the bank tellers and security guards immediately saw our masks, and as the guard went to grab his weapon, we grabbed ours. "GET ON THE FUCKING GROUND!" Ryan screamed at everyone. I watched as the bank tellers flooded away from the front desks and everyone around got on their knees and put their hands behind their heads.  
As we slowly walked to the gate, one of the security guards came running behind me. As he wrapped his cold hands around my neck, I sputtered out and grabbed my pistol. The entire crew was holding aim at the guard, but they couldn't get a shot. Finally, I put my pistol to his kneecap and struggled to pull the trigger. Finally, the familiar click of the trigger sounded as my ears immediately overcame tinnitus.  
As the guard let out a scream, I swiftly got up and aimed my pistol at his head. I wasn't ready for murder. But before I could make my decision, Gale did it for me. He brought up his rifle and sent a shot into the guard's head, killing him instantly. Blood, bones, and brains showered the floor as I stood there, shocked. He had just killed that man like it was nothing.  
After that senseless murder, people were crying. Hank screamed out, "SHUT THE FUCK UP."  
I was drenched in sweat at this point, as the rattling of keys signified we were going through the front desks. As the old metal gate swung open, we immediately rushed in and went to the vault. As we stood at the sight of this massive, beautiful vault, we heard the sounds of yelling outside. Someone must have run out. "Fuck," I said as we rushed to get into this vault. The plan of escape was to get what we could and go through the cemented sewer hole, likely with the C4 we had brought.  
I started to investigate the vault as I watched Gale and Hank start to threaten the office staff. "Give us the FUCKING CODE!" Hank screamed at one of them as we all started to panic. The man he screamed at went into a foetal position and said, "The code is... 174.. 895.. 01." He was sobbing by this point and was trying to crawl away. Ryan said, "Put that code in. 17489501"  
After a few button presses, we heard the sound of metal clanking and the crisp sound of the vault being unlocked. "We were in," I heard Marcus say as the vault finally swung open to reveal a pitch-black interior. "Lights up, guys," Marcus said as the flicker of our flashlights immediately lit up the vault interior.  
"It smells really weird in here," said Hank as I sniffed the air. He was right. It smelled like stale bread and warm milk. "Probably just the ventilation being fucked," I said to Hank as we walked around. We finally found the gold and started to put it in our duffel bags. That was when the vault door closed and locked. "FUCK!" screamed Marcus as he ran to the vault door and tried to barge it open. It was useless. I said, "We have the C4; we can go through the sewer when we're ready." Marcus said, "You're right, yeah. Okay, let's get as much as we can and get the fuck out of this place." Everyone, including me, started to grab what we could when we heard the sound of a bunch of metal being dropped. We thought one of us had dropped our bags, so we continued.  
After 5 minutes, we had grabbed everything. My shoulders ached, and I was pooling sweat as I spun my flashlight around. I felt alone as I stood in the vault. This was only amplified when Marcus said, "Where is Gale?" That's when I spun my flashlight around to see that his duffel bag had been dropped. We immediately did a head count, and there were only four of us. That wasn't right. Where did Gale go?  
"Where the fuck did he go?" Hank said as we looked around even more frantically. "He's fucking gone, guys." Ryan said as we started to panic. This only got worse as we started to realise we couldn't get out. I don't know how we didn't notice sooner, but the floor was layered with steel. C4 wasn't going to go through that. "Fuck.." Marcus said as I saw his feared expression.  
As we looked around, I noticed something. There was a small square imprint on the wall. It was clearly outlined, and I walked up to it. "Come look at these guys." I said this as the rest of the group huddled around me. "Could Gale have gone through here?" I said this as I put my hands on the imprint and shoved it. It began to slowly turn as it revealed a dark, narrow corridor. We sort of thought about it for a moment. "There could be a weak point on the other side. Maybe an escape." Ryan said, "We agreed.  
As we began to pant from the heat in the metal-lined room, we crawled into the narrow corridor as we began to shuffle along. I started to notice the heat rising as I led behind Marcus. I started to swelter as we reached the end of this corridor. We came out on the other side.  
What I saw in that room still confuses me to this day. All that stood there was a baby crib. And as we approached it, we noticed a putrid smell. Marcus was the first to look, and he immediately started to scream and ran far back. "IT'S GALE!" he screamed at us as we approached the crib. All that sat there was Gales lifeless head. It was a very visceral cut. It looked like it was ripped off.  
I began to gag as I stepped back with Marcus. I pulled off my balaclava as I vomited everywhere. The green, sour liquid is making me feel even worse. After around 15 seconds, I stopped. I started to sob like a baby when I heard something.  
It was muffled footsteps coming from the corridor we had just exited. I watched as Marcus and Ryan grabbed their rifles and aimed them at the corridor. It slowly became louder as I watched. My stomach was twisted, and I felt so wrong. It's the same feeling you get when you go down a steep hill in a car. That feeling of vertigo in your stomach Finally, the footsteps halted as I heard shuffling.  
What came out still haunts me even today. As it stepped out, I couldn't even imagine it. It was blurry, as if it were out of focus. It was so black that even in the pitch black of the vault, it looked like a shadow. It's hard to describe what it looked like, but I can tell you one thing. This thing was smiling. A deep, toothy grin so large it covered its face like a mask. That's all I could make out. Massive white teeth plastered on this thing's face.  
Then it stood up. It was around 8 feet tall, and it towered over all of us. We were all so afraid. It started to walk towards Marcus. That's when the shots started. That thing let out an inhuman sound—a screech so ear-piercing that I felt blood trickle down from my ear as I watched this thing decimate Marcus.  
Black, blurry hands were emerging from its body as it grabbed Marcus by his leg. He screamed, "GET IT OFF PLEASE!" But before he could do much, it slammed him into a wall so hard that his neck broke. He was dead instantly. It grabbed his body and started to rip it apart. I watched as Hank and Ryan screamed and began to dump more shots into it. It was ultimately useless, as I watched it grab Ryan. Before he could even scream, I heard the sound of cracking and ripping as I looked away. I heard the sound of wet slapping as I slowly turned to look.  
That thing had decapitated Ryan, and Hank was on the floor. That thing had killed everyone but me. It all happened so quickly too. I started to sob as that thing came over to me. It stared at me, and then a voice in my head echoed. "Who... are... you?" That thing was telepathically speaking to me.  
I reluctantly spat out an answer. "I... I am will. Wh.. What are you?"  
I could tell its expression changed as its smile faded away. "You are stealing my gifts." It pointed at my duffel bag. "Y..Your gold?" I answered back. Tears were rolling down my face as I stared at it. Everything about it made me feel afraid.  
"Gold. Yes. That is my gift. Why do you try to take it from me?" Its voice was sly, like a slither. It's hard to describe, but it echoed in my mind, giving me a headache every time it spoke. I finally sputtered out the answer as I started to cry uncontrollably: "It's worth a lot." It would be able to save us from doing this again. Please don't kill me. But if you do, please do it quickly." I spoke, choking on sobs as it started at me.  
It reached down, and I flinched. It grabbed the duffel bag as it stared at me. "You do not do this again. I will give you one chance." There were so many things about this thing that I questioned. How did it speak English? How did it take Gale without being seen? But the biggest question I had was: What the fuck was this thing?  
I said it once again. "Wait.. What.. Are you?" It turned to face me, and its grin appeared once again. "I am a fallen... I was once like you, but I did something that gave me a chance at Godhood... I was like you once. It paused before continuing again. "This place is not a vault... "It's a shrine to me. I am Natron." I was so scared. I was confused, and I was experiencing multiple emotions I couldn't solidly explain.  
Then it clicked its fingers, and I blacked out. I remembered seeing a dark tunnel with a light at the end. I saw so many things I can't verbalise them. But the one thing I can tell you is:Whatever was in that vault wasn't natural. I truly believe I saw a god that day. An evil one at that. The more I remember about that vault, the more it makes sense. I can remember dried splotches of red, dents in the metal, scratches on the wall, and the corridor we crawled through.  
I woke up in a hospital bed. Officers surrounded me, and I knew I was fucked. I'll spare the details for legal troubles, but I was put in prison for a very long time. There are so many things I could say, but I can't. I feel an aura of hatred and despair whenever I think about that thing. I don't know how to explain it.  
I will give an update soon, however. I don't know when. I think about Natron every day. Even typing that word now, I feel a deep pulsation in my head.
