Lowa log 1  
  
I don't remember much from my childhood.I do remember my mum and dad.I was born into a broken home, but my mums always made it seem like it was the best thing to happen to her.Her actions on the other hand, didn't really match up.I guess that's what I appreciate more about my dad.

I always kinda knew where I stood with him.  
Her was an unemployed drunken abusive kind of father, if you want to call him that.He was both abusive to me and my mother, but maybe I was lucky cos it wasn't sexual. Just violent. My parents never sent me to school. I was registered as home school, because while my dad was many things, paranoid could fit on that list easily. He was worried that I'd open my mouth about my home life. I remember i once lost the clicker to the telly and for that, he saw it appropriate to grab and old cable cord, Fold it in half. Duck tape it together and walked into my room and beat me with it as a punishment. And my mums, well she just sat at the kitchen table and listened. I don't really blame her though.  
  
Had she gotten involved, she just as well been on the floor with me.I have a very  strange relationship with my mother. I love her, and I think about her a lot.But at the same time, I often blame her for not saving me.I still talk to her.When the outbreak happened, I saw it as my time to leave the nest.  
  
My dad was killed by zombies while out at the local pub, so there was nothing stopping me, but my mother.She wasn't going to stop me from leaving, it's just I didn't want to just up and leave her, but I needed to see the world outside of the telly.  
  
So after I packed up a few belongings, I locked her in the pantry.I often write letters to her, by the chance that she got out.Its sounds silly, i know.  
  


I live in a place called “no-where”.During the day I walk miles looking for life, it's the safest with all the zombies underground for the day.  
I have outposts here and there. So if I'm caught at night, I'm normally not far away.I have a van at my main base, and other survivors and myself have a rescue bus we found and got up and running, but petrol and many other things are hard to come by as you might expect.  
  
So I walk looking for cigarettes, coffee, makeup,batteries and other valuable odds and ends, to sell or stash. One day while i was walking on the edge of my home town, while dropping off letters outside my mums house, i came upon a strange rip in space and time, i didn't know what it was at the [time.It](http://time.It) looked like a bright glimmering window, but not a window like a home.  
I call it a window because I couldn't help but feel like someone was looking at me from the other side.Against my better judgment, i approached it and as i got closer and closer, it started to react,And out of it a phone flew into my head with enough force to knock me back onto my bum.  
I picked it up to inspect it and I can only imagine my hard headedness broke the device, as it was cracked.But it worked, and when I unlocked the screen I was exposed to your world.  
  
All the content and cool things you guys get to do.I brought it back to my base and we came up with a way to charge it, then for the next few years I watched you guys.   
I watched you guys love, I watched you laugh, and I watched you fight.My life was hard, but you guys just seemed to live so much harder.My life was simple: eat, sleep, survive. That was all I had to do.  
And it gave me a new found motivation to fight back against the apocalypse.  
  
Because it would seem that once again I was the lucky one, like with my father.I'll be right back, there's an alarm going off, and we need to make sure it's not a breach  
  
**I'll be right back after a short break.** an alarm of a secured base going offI'm back.If you heard the noise, I'm sure you would think it was a big deal, but it wasn't.It's just a tuesday.As the sun goes down the weaker breed of zombies come to the surface first.They're pretty dumb, slow and easy to manage.Though there are those who still freak out every night,but I was almost born into it.And grew up with it,  I'm 33 now.  
  


Tomorrow I'll follow my normal schedule and wander the wasteland and nearby towns for more survivors. Typical day, it's proper boarding, but I take breaks from time to time and watch you guys on the phone.It's mostly a highlight of my day, but for now, it's dusk here and I'm on watch in about 40 minutes.As long as we are quiet, we are safe, just like your films and shows.I watched a lot of your movies, but not the zombies ones too much. I get enough of that in my day to day life.  
YOU GUYS ARE SO CREATIVE, BUT ALSO SO HATEFUL, WHY?  
  
We don't have that here.  
  
After I left home I wandered the discruction for days, i think I was 16 at the [time.Life](http://time.Life) was hard, I fought every step of the way, but as you can expect, it wasn't just zombies I had to fight.  
But after some time I learned quickly.  
I DIDN'T CARE WHAT I HAD TO DO TO SURVIVE, I WOULD SURVIVE.  
  
While camping out in a wrecked coffee shop, I heard a group of survivors breaking windows and stuff as they searched for [valuables.At](http://valuables.At) the time I didn't know that coffee was a valuable product at the time.  
As they got closer I quickly crawled over to the counter and hid behind it praying that they just walked by.But luck didn't seem to be with me that day.  
They walked into the shop like a hurricane, breaking that which was already broken.  
  
I assumed it was just for the fun of it.Two, one male and one female started bagging up ripped bags of coffee beans and two other men searched the shop apart from [them.One](http://them.One) walked over to the counter to the cash register above me.  
In a panic I covered my mouth so as to not allow them to hear me whimpering.  
The man leaned over to grab the money out of the registerI couldn't see him, but I could feel his present.   
And had i be strongerHe might not have found me.  
When he pulled the money from the register in haste.  
A few bills fell and light touched the back of my neck, and i let out a small whimperNext thing i know, the whole shop was quiet.  
  
I sat for, what had to have been about point 3 seconds, but it felt much longer.Suddenly the man grabbed that back of my hair and pulled me up on the counter as the others made their way over to me.I kicked and screamed, trying to shake loss, but failedThe women rushed over to me and started hitting me in the face over and over panicking that my scream would draw zombies to us.  
“SHUT HER THE FUCK UP” she said to the others.I saw that as an opportunity.  
  
I kicked the man trying to hold my feet.Then I looked up to the one that pulled me onto the counter and broke my hand free from the other and scratched him in the face.  
He let go to hold his eyes, and I sat up, rolled off the counter and fell to the ground.  
The man I kicked rushed behind the counter to grab me, but I got up and grabbed the register and hit him in the head with it.I then turned to the women ordering the others to “hurry” and I threw the register at her hitting her in the face.  
  
Blood splatter onto my face.  I raised my hands to wipe it, and about a yard out I could see a black horde  rushing towards us.   
I pointed at them and the others turned and looked behind them and out the shop windows. I then hopped the counter and snatched a bag of beams from one of their hands and ran through an “employees” only door that led to the back kitchen, and burst through the emergency exit.  
Then I just ran as fast as I could from town.When I was a safe enough distance away, I stopped and looked back as that black horde surrounded the whole shop.  
Up till now, I got by on pure luck, but luck always runs out.
