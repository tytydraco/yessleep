Staff Sergeant Derek Price, Delta Team

I’ve written mission logs hundreds of times. Coordinates. Kill counts, timelines, every operation sanitized, neat. Standard entries: who we engaged, how we moved, what we accomplished. Risk assessed, casualties recorded, objectives completed. Cold, clinical, professional.

But this… this is different.

I survived. My team didn’t. And nothing I’ve ever experienced in the field prepared me for what I saw. Not the firefights, not the ambushes, not the insurgents hiding in ruins. This was something… outside of everything I’ve trained for, outside of comprehension. Something that defies reason, logic, and everything we consider human.

If anyone finds this record, understand: I am not exaggerating. I am not dramatizing. This is the unfiltered truth. Someone else might survive if they know what’s waiting. Someone else might avoid the mistake we made.

I am a soldier, or...so I thought. Trained to remain calm under fire. Trained to process fear and act with precision. I’ve stared into the eyes of death countless times, never blinking. But I write this with my hands shaking, with my heart still hammering, and with a mind that will never forget.

What I saw… it changed everything. It shattered the rules. It took what we know about life, death, and humanity and twisted it until it was unrecognizable.
I don’t know if anyone will believe me. I don’t know if I even believe myself, some days. But it happened. And it’s still out there.

And I dare you...this is a long one. A very, very long one. So, bare with me.

We were tasked to investigate a government-run science lab, one of those “off-the-books” facilities buried deep in a forest in [REDACTED]. Access was restricted. No civilians. No press. They called it a “containment research site,” but no one outside the project knew what they were working on.

It was unreachable by normal means. Satellite imagery was limited. The closest road had been abandoned years ago. Even our transport, a modified tactical insertion vehicle, struggled through the dense undergrowth.

By the time we reached the perimeter, twilight was falling. Long, distorted shadows stretched between the trees, shifting in ways that made the hairs on my neck stand on end. 

Even Hawk, who jokes at the edge of death, went quiet.

"Feels… wrong," he said, voice low, NVGs scanning the forest floor.

"Eyes open," I said, my tone clipped. "Slow. Steady. Every corner, every doorway. Don’t assume anything."

Lock moved ahead, breaching tool ready. Ghost and I flanked, scanning left and right. Hawk was behind me, moving with quiet confidence, though I could hear the tension in his breathing. Viper stayed slightly back, keeping a middle arc to cover our six.

The perimeter looked normal at first glance. The barbed wire fence was intact. The main gate unlocked. No alarms, no cameras. No footprints. Too easy, too clean, too perfect.

Inside, the facility was sterile. Too clean. The fluorescent lights flickered occasionally, but nothing seemed powered down. Computers hummed softly. Papers littered the floors. Empty chairs leaned against desks. A cup of coffee tipped over, but the liquid was cold.

"Feels staged," Lock muttered under his breath. "Like someone....or something wanted us to see this first."

Hawk tried to lighten the mood with a joke, his voice strained: "Lead us into a haunted lab, Derek. Classic Delta Team move."

Lock rolled his eyes, muttering something about professionalism.

Ghost didn’t speak. Her eyes scanned the shadows like they were alive, catching details the rest of us missed: a floor tile slightly displaced, the way a door frame seemed warped, a corner that swallowed light unnaturally.

Viper, calm as always, adjusted her grip on the medic pack. Her eyes never left the corridor ahead, always analyzing, always calculating, always thinking three steps forward.

We joked to calm nerves, but it didn’t work. The tension had already set in. Something was here, and it knew we were coming.
Even without seeing it yet, I could feel it. 

Even before we found any bodies, something was… off. The wrongness wasn’t immediate, but it crept in slowly, like a shadow at the edge of your vision, impossible to ignore.

Chairs seemed to move on their own. One leaned slightly against the wall as we passed, though no one had touched it. Another tipped backward, scraping lightly against the tiled floor, then stopped as if caught mid-motion. 

Hawk glanced at me, eyebrows raised.

"Did one of you…?" he asked, voice tense.

"No," Lock said, already scanning the room. "Nothing moved it. I’m telling you.”

Doors opened as we approached. At first, I thought it was wind. But some had no handles, some were locked from the inside, or so the logs suggested. And every door we approached swung slightly, creaking softly, then stopped. Waiting. As if it knew we were coming.

Shadows bent unnaturally. In one hallway, the lights flickered, and a shadow along the far wall stretched impossibly long, like it had no origin. 

Ghost froze. Her head head tilting slightly and her eyes narrowing. "Do you see that?" she whispered.

I nodded, motioning for the team to slow. The shadow didn’t move like a normal object or person. It curved around a corner, almost liquid, and then disappeared when I blinked.

The fluorescent lights warbled briefly, then returned. It wasn’t a flicker. Not an electrical issue. It was deliberate. Uneven pulsing, like the lights were breathing. The hum deepened slightly, just enough to feel it in our chests. 

Viper shifted, checking power lines and conduits, frowning. "All circuits normal," she said quietly.

Temperature shifted subtly. Some rooms were slightly warmer, some colder, though the AC hadn’t turned on. The cold pockets felt… alive. It made your skin crawl. Even Hawk muttered something about goosebumps running up his arms.

Then sounds that shouldn’t exist. A floorboard groaned two rooms ahead, though no one stepped there. A chair scraped behind us, but when we spun, nothing was there. Footsteps echoed faintly down the hall, then stopped. Silence.

I whispered. Low enough that only Ghost and I could hear: "Eyes open. Something’s here. Something’s watching."

We pressed on. Slowly. Room by room. Corridor by corridor. Each door opened to another sterile office, another lab, each one emptier, colder, somehow heavier than the last. The hallways narrowed, angles seeming to shift subtly as we moved, like the building itself was warping.

Every step felt heavier than the last. My boots sounded unnaturally loud, echoing down corridors that should have swallowed sound. Every corner felt like a potential ambush. Not by humans, by… something else. Something patient. Something intelligent.

Ghost moved silently ahead, rifle up, scanning. 

Lock kept his breaching tool ready, muscles tight. 

Hawk fidgeted, muttering small jokes to mask tension. 

Viper’s eyes never left the corridors in front of her, calculating, mapping, anticipating.

Even with all our training, all our experience, the creeping sense of wrongness was inescapable. 

Every detail, every anomaly, added weight to the feeling that we weren’t walking into a lab. We were walking into something alive. Something waiting.

We finally entered the main lab.

The lab itself was built into the rock, reinforced steel and concrete, a sterile capsule hidden under a forest canopy that filtered the fading sunlight. But inside, the natural world was gone. Cold, dim, antiseptic. The air smelled faintly of bleach and metal.

And there it was.

A male scientist...

"Finally, some clue.." I whispered to myself.

Sitting on a chair, back turned to us. Its posture was unnervingly straight, unnaturally calm. It didn’t twitch. It didn’t shift. Just… sat. Waiting.

"Check if he's alive," I whispered, my voice low, careful.

Hawk stepped forward, hand on the rifle. His usual bravado was gone. Hands shook slightly. His jaw tightened. I could see his pulse at his temple.
"I’ll do it," he muttered.

He reached out and carefully swung the body forward by the shoulders, moving slowly to avoid jerking it.

Time seemed to stop.

The room felt heavier. Every sound amplified: the soft scrape of the chair against the floor, the hum of the lights, the faint drip of condensation from a ceiling vent. My chest felt tight, muscles coiled.

Then....the head turned.

And then…

The smile.

It was wide. Way too wide. The kind of smile that could never exist naturally, stretching the limits of the jaw, curling at angles that made your stomach twist. 

And the eyes…

Bloodshot, wide, unblinking, fixed, staring, and expecting.

"Shit!" Hawk screamed in recoil. His voice trembled, a rarity for him.

Ghost’s rifle swung up instantly, barrel trained on the figure, eyes narrowing behind her night vision. 

Lock’s hand twitched on the breaching tool. 

Viper froze, mouth slightly open, breathing shallow.

It wasn’t fear. Not pain. Not agony. It was something worse. Anticipatory, patient, calculating, waiting, and judging.

We froze. I froze. The seconds stretched endlessly, every heartbeat pounding in my ears. Sweat trickled down my spine despite the cold.

"Do…do wha-what do we do?" Hawk’s voice cracked.

"Calm yourself, Hawk" I said, more to myself than him. 

We barely breathed. The faint smell of bleach masked something else...something metallic, coppery, like blood, but not quite. The silence pressed against our eardrums.

And then I realized… it wasn’t just waiting. Someone was here....expecting us.

Every instinct screamed at me: run, shoot, retreat. But my training forced me to hold, to assess.

The body didn’t flinch. It didn’t blink. But its head tilted slightly, as if examining us in return. And the smile didn’t fade. It widened imperceptibly, impossibly, a silent promise that whatever this was… it wanted more.

"Uhhh..Derek?" Ghost whispered, barely moving her lips.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

We pressed on. Not because we had to, but because we were soldiers. Because we needed to know what the hell happened in here.

The first body had already set the tone. That smile. Those eyes. They were burned into my mind, impossible to erase. 

We didn’t speak. We didn’t move faster than we had to. Every step was careful, methodical, measured.

The main lab was enormous, with rows of stainless steel benches and glass cabinets lining the walls. 

But as we moved deeper, the horror unfolded slowly. At first, we saw only papers, broken glass, and overturned stools. But then… the corpses began to appear.

Lab benches covered with bodies, sprawled in positions that seemed almost posed. Limbs twisted at unnatural angles, as if rearranged after death. 

One man lay face-down across a microscope, arms splayed, his lab coat perfectly clean...except for the smile. The wide, impossible smile. 

And the eyes. Huge, unblinking, fixed straight ahead. Expecting.

"Jesus…" Hawk muttered under his breath, his voice barely audible. He swallowed hard. “This isn’t… human.”

"They’re… arranged," Lock whispered, voice tight. He stepped closer, scanning, as if proximity could explain the impossible. “Like… someone set them like this.”

"For something," Viper said quietly, crouching, eyes tracing the alignment of the corpses down the rows. "Or someone."

I stepped closer, keeping my rifle raised. Each body was turned slightly toward the far end of the lab. The angle of every head, every eye, every finger, was deliberate. Not random. Not chaotic. 
It was almost… ceremonial.

The air was thick. Heavy. Almost viscous. Every step echoed in the empty space, bouncing off the walls, mingling with a faint metallic scent, like blood, or iron, but not quite. 

Some bodies were missing patches of flesh, small portions, cleanly removed, yet the faces… the faces were untouched. The smiles remained perfect, the eyes wide. Expecting.

"They’re waiting," Ghost muttered, voice barely audible, eyes darting to every shadow. “All of them. For something…”

"Waiting?" Hawk said, his voice shaking. He swallowed, trying to regain control. “They're waiting for who? Us? What the fuck is that supposed to mean?"

I didn’t answer. My gut told me he was right. This wasn’t just a lab accident. This wasn’t human error. This wasn’t anything we’d trained for. 

We pressed forward slowly, row by row, bodies aligned in patterns that made no sense, but each body seemed to mark a step toward something deeper, something hidden.

And the deeper we went, the more I realized that every body was staged to intimidate, to measure, to terrify.

The first body’s eyes had seemed expectant, but the rest… the rest looked almost alive, watching, anticipating. It was as if some unseen presence was judging us, testing us. And every corpse was complicit.

By the time we reached the far end of the main lab, I felt the air shift again. Thicker an colder. Every nerve in my body screamed: something was waiting. Something that had orchestrated all of this.

And then… we saw it.

I can’t describe it fully. Not accurately. Not in words. Not without losing the weight of it. Limbs bent at impossible angles, twisting like folded paper. Joints that shouldn’t exist jutted outward. Its posture was wrong, unnatural, yet purposeful.
The angles of its body didn’t match anything human, animal, or mechanical. Parts seemed to shimmer, shifting in the corner of my vision, then snapping back into place. 

Its face… God, Its face was worse.

It wasn’t a face. Not really. Features appeared and vanished. Eyes forming only to vanish a second later, lips curling impossibly wide, teeth gleaming in a smile that shouldn’t exist. Then gone. And just when I thought I understood the pattern, the face reformed differently. Shifting. Morphing. Always watching. Always calculating.
It tilted its head toward us. Not aggressively. Not attacking. But deliberately and patiently judging. Its movements were unnaturally smooth, almost liquid, yet somehow impossible in the mechanics of reality.

The faintest sound accompanied it, a subtle, scraping whisper, like fingernails on metal, but no one else heard it at first. Only I felt it, in my bones.

"Eyes....on target," I said to my team. I couldn't control my voice anymore.

Ghost’s rifle raised, steady as ever, but even she took a half-step back, just slightly, her body stiff, her breath shallow. 

Hawk’s jaw clenched, his knuckles white on his rifle. 

Lock gripped his breaching tool like it could anchor him to sanity. 

Viper… she didn’t move, but I could see her eyes widening ever so slightly, scanning, calculating, trying to understand the impossible.

It didn’t blink. Didn’t breathe, or if it did, it did so without sound. And yet, I felt it. Felt the weight of its awareness pressing against every nerve in my body. It was assessing us, measuring us… deciding.

Every instinct screamed: run. Hide. Shoot. But something told me none of that mattered. Whatever this was, it didn’t need to chase. It didn’t need to strike. It was already in control. Already ahead. 

But seeing the bodies, the smile, the eyes....

I should have known the bodies weren’t just dead. Not in the normal sense. But it took seeing them like this. Rows of them, perfectly arranged, every limb, every angle deliberate..to understand.

The bodies weren’t smiling for themselves. They weren’t frozen in death by accident, nor were they posturing for some human ritual. They were performing.
For it.

"It wants… something. Something about...smiling." I said, my voice barely more than a whisper, thick with dread.

Ghost’s head tilted slightly, eyes narrowing behind her goggles.
"What?" she whispered, her voice trembling despite her usual calm.

Hawk swallowed hard, his face pale, and his hands trembled against his rifle.
"Smiles," he said finally, voice cracking. "Perfect… smiles."

Not just smiles. Not just the way lips curl. The teeth, jaw, eyes. Symmetry and precision. Every feature calibrated, unnaturally, grotesquely perfect.
And that’s when it hit me.

It wasn’t satisfied with chaos, or death, or fear. It wanted performance. Assessment. Judgement. And we weren’t witnesses. We were participants. Its eyes were on us already, calculating. Measuring. Deciding whether we were… good enough.

Every instinct screamed at me: Don’t move. Don’t breathe. Don’t let it see you. But even as I froze, I could feel it. Watching me. Waiting. Patient.
And then I realized the most terrifying part: the smiles weren’t just about perfection. They were the requirement for survival. If you failed to perform. If you hesitated, flinched, showed fear, it would decide you were… unworthy.

"It’s… judging us," I whispered to the team.

“And if we fail… it doesn’t just kill. It… fixes us. Makes us… perfect.” I added. 

My team didn’t say a word, but their eyes widened ever so slightly, understood the situation. I saw the genuine fear behind their stare: we weren’t escaping this with bullets or training. We were trapped.

And in that moment, every soldier I had trained with, every mission I’d survived, every instinct honed over years of Delta ops… meant nothing.
The thing didn’t just want death. It wanted compliance. Obedience. A perfect performance. And then it would decide… if you deserved to live.

Viper went first.

It was subtle at first, almost innocuous. Her lips curled slightly, teeth showing in a small, unnatural smile. Her eyes widened. The rest of us froze, not sure if she had noticed something, or if it was the creature influencing her body.

Then the head tilt. Just the slightest movement, almost casual, deliberate. Calculating.
Her body tensed violently. I could hear the faint, sickening snap of muscles tearing, quietly at first, then louder, more grotesque. Her jaw stretched beyond natural limits. Lips contorted painfully, skin tearing at the corners, teeth grinding unnaturally. Her eyes… fixed. Unblinking. Expecting.
And then she was still. Dead, perfect, and smiling.

"Viper!" Hawk shouted, but even he sounded small, distant, swallowed by the horror.

Lock stepped forward, instinct overriding terror.
The creature tilted its head, as if mildly disappointed. Lock’s body convulsed, stiffening. Muscles spasmed violently. I watched, helpless, as his jaw shifted, twisted, then tore painfully, locking his mouth into a grotesque grin. Eyes fixed. Unblinking, dead, and smiling perfectly.

Hawk tried to shout again, but his own face betrayed him. An involuntary twitch at the corners of his mouth, a creeping widening of the eyes. The creature’s gaze snapped to him, tilting its head with precision. His knees buckled. Muscles tore, snapping under the stress of unnatural angles. Bones cracked audibly. His body fell to the floor. Jaw locked, eyes wide, and Smile perfect.

Ghost moved next, silent as ever, rifle raised, but even she faltered. Her body froze, lips curling slightly, eyes widening involuntarily. The creature leaned in ever so slightly. And then Ghost convulsed. Neck twisted. Jaw muscles tore. Lips stretched impossibly, the sound faint but sickening. A high-pitched tearing, almost like paper ripping. Her body crumpled. Dead, smiling perfectly.

I watched each of them fall. One by one. Precision, calculated, and unrelenting. The creature didn’t strike with claws or weapons. It didn’t need to. It forced their bodies to obey, to perform, until perfection was achieved. Until it was satisfied.

Every instinct I had as a Delta Operator screamed at me to act. To fight. But this wasn’t something that could be fought. This was judgement made flesh, something beyond bullets, beyond blades. Something patient. Calculating. Watching me, assessing me… deciding if I, too, was worthy.
And I realized, with a sinking, icy horror: the smiles weren’t just expressions. They were the requirement for survival. Fail to smile perfectly, and you wouldn’t just die...you’d be remade. Or erased.

I was last.

And then I felt it. Its gaze, impossible to ignore. Not just observing me, but reading me, dissecting me, measuring every muscle, every heartbeat. I realized something I wish I hadn’t: it didn’t need to strike. It didn’t need to attack. Not yet. Its only purpose was to assess.

To see if I could pass its impossible test.
Time slowed. My breath was shallow, rapid, almost choking in the cold, antiseptic air. My mind screamed at me to act, to fight, to run, but all my training collided with something else. Pure, unfiltered instinct. The creature’s patience pressed down on me, heavy and suffocating, and I felt my carefully honed composure start to unravel.

I moved unpredictably. Rolled to the side, jumped, fired rounds into empty space, not to kill, not to wound, but to break the pattern it expected. To survive.

I could hear the soft scraping of the lab floor behind me, the sound of the creature moving without moving, bending shadows around itself. The corpses of my team watched me as I passed. Smiles perfect, eyes wide, expecting, waiting.
I didn’t look at them. I couldn’t. Their faces were burned into my vision already. Hawk, Ghost, Lock, Viper… all frozen in that impossible grin. 
And somewhere inside me, a part of my mind whispered: next time, it’s your turn.

The creature hesitated. Just for a fraction of a second, long enough for me to feel a heartbeat of hope, a glimpse of escape.

Then I ran. Past the corpses, past the twisted lab benches, past the scattered papers and overturned chairs that had suddenly become sinister. My boots pounded against the floor, echoing, loud, unforgiving. Every instinct screamed: don’t stop. don’t look back.

The smell of metal and bleach mixed with something else, something rancid, like decay, like blood, but not entirely. Every sense screamed that it was following, waiting for the moment I faltered.

I didn’t. Not yet.

I made it to the far hallway, then the stairwell, then outside. The cold night air hit me, sharp and cruel, but it was freedom. For now.
I stumbled, gasping, shaking, heart hammering like it would tear through my chest. I had survived. But I knew, with a certainty that will never leave me:

It was still out there. And it had marked me.

After my escape, I tried to tell someone. Anyone.
But no one would, or could, believe me.

Official reports stated the lab had been destroyed due to a chemical containment failure. A catastrophic accident. All personnel were declared casualties. Bodies unrecoverable. Hazardous materials were cited. Entire sections of the forest were cordoned off. The military issued statements, and the media ran their stories: 

"Tragic Accident at Remote Research Facility.No Survivors."

No one questioned it. No one investigated further. And in a way, I couldn’t blame them. The lab had vanished as if it never existed. Satellite images wiped. Records redacted and access permanently forbidden.

But I know the truth.

The lab wasn’t destroyed by chemicals. It was empty when the evacuation protocol was enacted, except for the creature. The rows of bodies, smiling, waiting. The corridors, sterile and calm, hiding something incomprehensible. They weren’t casualties of a chemical spill. They were casualties of something far older, far smarter, and far more patient than any human.

And it wasn’t gone. It never left.

The official narrative made the world forget. But I remember. I remember every wide-eyed corpse, every impossible smile, every quiet, deliberate moment when it judged my team… and me.
I couldn’t tell anyone. Not without being locked away. Not without them thinking I’d lost my mind. 

But I carry it with me. Always.

I went AWOL one week after the debrief.
Didn’t pack much. Didn’t say goodbye. Just disappeared.

I moved constantly. Cheap apartments. Motels. Places where nobody asked questions. I avoided crowds. Avoided reflections. Avoided mirrors especially, because sometimes, when I was tired, when my guard slipped, I’d catch myself checking my own face. Making sure my mouth wasn’t… drifting. Making sure my eyes weren’t opening too wide. Sleep didn’t come easy. When it did, I dreamed of head tilts. Of quiet judgement. Of that impossible patience.

A year passed.

I started to believe, stupidly, that distance mattered. That time diluted things. That whatever had been in that lab was contained. Buried. Destroyed.

Last night, I almost felt normal.

I was sitting by the window of my rented house, lights off out of habit, watching the street. Suburban. Quiet. Safe-looking. Porch lights. Parked cars. Crickets.

Then I noticed movement....

Aross the street, a family of mother, father, two kids walking toward another family stepping out of their house. Neighbors, probably. Normal. Laughing. Talking. Carrying grocery bags.

I almost looked away.

Almost....

But..something felt… off.

I squinted, leaning closer to the glass.

The smiles hit me first.

Wide. Too fucking wide. Stretched just a fraction beyond what felt natural. Teeth exposed too evenly. No tension in the cheeks. No warmth in the eyes.

And the eyes...

Oh, God...

Widened. Bloodshot. Unblinking. Frozen in place, mid-step, mid-gesture. All of them.
I didn’t breathe. For a second, just one, I told myself it was stress. A trauma. A hallucination.

Then both families tilted their heads toward my window.

Perfectly...

Swiftly...

Unnaturally...

Every single one of them.

That smile...that goddamn smile...

The same one from the lab. The same expectant stillness. The same sense of being measured.
I slammed the blinds shut so hard they rattled. Dropped to the floor. Heart hammering so violently I thought it would give me away. Hands shaking. Teeth clenched so tight my jaw hurt.

I didn’t hear footsteps. Didn’t hear voices. But I knew that I survived the lab. But it didn’t end there.
It waits.

Always...

Watching...

Calculating...

Remembering...

And now it knows where I live.

That’s why I’m writing this. Not as a soldier. Not as a mission log. But as a warning.
Be careful of smiles. Not nervous ones. Not awkward ones. The perfect ones.
Too symmetrical. Too still. Too wide. 

And eyes that don’t blink. Eyes that look like they’re waiting for approval. If someone smiles at you and it feels wrong, trust that feeling. Look away. Move. Break pattern. Do not stare back.

Because if it decides you’re being watched…
You don’t get to decide what happens next.
And if you ever feel the urge to smile back....

Run!
