I was going through a dumpster when I found out I had inherited a fortune.

You would be amazed what people throw away: pairs of gloves, food that’s only just past its sell by date, books that are still readable, and so much more.

I had been living on the streets for a couple of years by this stage. Things were incredibly hard, and my health had suffered, but I had learnt to just about get by.

Living like this had been something I had slipped into really quickly. I used to have a job in a retail outlet but lost this because of the economic downturn. Within six months I was being evicted from my apartment with no bank cards that worked and a mobile which had been cut off.

But that was then. On the day my life turned in a new direction, I was holding up a raincoat I had found in the dumpster and wishing it was a few sizes bigger so it would fit me.

When I heard someone speaking behind me, I assumed they were not speaking to me.

Being homeless gives you a kind of invisibility. It’s remarkable – and sickening, in my opinion.

Anyway, I went back to rooting, until I felt a tap on my shoulder.

My spirits sank. On past experience, that meant I was probably about to get moved on or maybe even arrested.

When I turned round I was surprised to see the person who wanted to get my attention was wearing a pin-striped three piece suit and shoes so shiny they glinted in the sun.

He threw me even more by asking if I was Martin Joseph Turner.

I was, but I was so confused by now I did not know how to respond.

So, I just stared at him with my mouth open.

This did not put him off. He pointed to a group of three other men who were gathered around a small fire taking turns to sip from a bottle of wine and said, “Your associates said that you were and, if it is correct that you are Mr Turner, then I have good news for you.”

I managed to say, “What are you talking about?”

He smiled at me. “I am an attorney and the executor of the will of Nathaniel Turner and I am pleased to say you are the sole beneficiary.”

He kept smiling while, presumably, waiting for a response.

I opened my mouth again and stared at him.

I had known I had a distant relative who was big in consumer goods but had never had any contact with him. It had never occurred to me to reach out to him when I started struggling financially. I was too busy not answering the phone to debt collectors and lying awake in a cold sweat staring at the ceiling.

Yet, somehow, my rich relative had reached out to me – from beyond the grave as it were – and it appeared that all my troubles were over.

I gulped and asked, “How much?”

The attorney told me.

I came back round a few minutes later. There was a limousine waiting for me. The driver introduced himself as Daniel. He was wearing a crisp black suit and a peaked cap.

I hesitated to get in when he held the door open for me. The seats were mahogany coloured leather and looked immaculately clean.

“Is there a problem, sir?” he asked.

“Uh, yeah,” I mumbled, “I have fleas.”

He seemed unperturbed. “The car is valeted after every journey,” he said. “And if any of the pesky critters remain when I check it afterwards, then I will take it to the scrap yard. This limousine is one of a fleet of six at your disposal, along with a helicopter, private jet, and yacht. Will there be anything else, sir?”

I had no reply beyond yet more dumb shock and climbed meekly in.

The next few days were a whirlwind of long hot showers, of lying in a bed so comfy it made me want to weep, and eating meals that I had dreamt about while I was out on the streets. I met advisors and accountants and drank a lot of champagne.

As part of my entourage, there was a security detail of men whose starched white shirts and jackets bulged with muscles. They had buzz cuts and coils of wire leading from their collars to their ears and at least two of them hovered nearby all of the time.

When I had met the head of the security company in those dizzying first few days, he had explained that the detail was needed to protect me from kidnappers and spontaneous threats.

He was called Malone and he was stocky and stank of aftershave.

I had nodded and pretended I knew what he was talking about and accepted these square-jawed shadows as part of my new life.

About two months after I became rich, I was leaving my townhouse to go to a concert in an arena that, apparently, I owned.

Daniel was waiting by the limousine holding the door open for me and I was flanked by two men from the security detail. I did not know their names or anything else about them, even the colour of their eyes thanks to the dark sunglasses they all wore at all times. They would follow the limousine in a separate vehicle.

I put them out of my thoughts and climbed in.

As we drove away from my townhouse and onto the public highway, I was settling back and deciding which channel I wanted to watch on the widescreen tv, when the limousine pulled to a sudden halt.

“What’s wrong?” I asked.

“There is someone in the road,” Daniel replied.

I peered past him through the windscreen and saw a man dressed in layers of torn and dirty clothes pushing a shopping trolley that was piled high with cardboard, plastic bags and yet more ragged clothes. His face was filthy and his beard and hair matted.

My heart sank as I thought how, once, that had been me.

And how easily I had forgotten that such suffering existed.

Moments later, my maudlin thoughts were gone, because the two men from the security detail had run into view. One of them grabbed the man in the road by his arm and dragged him over to the sidewalk, where he threw him onto the ground. The other one did the same with the trolley, upending its contents over the sidewalk as he hurled it away.

I felt a moment of cold clarity before the anger consumed me.

“Daniel,” I said, "phone Malone, the head of the security company, and tell him Mr Turner says he and his gang of thugs are fired.”

Without batting an eyelid, he did this. While Daniel was on the call, I got out of the limousine. The two men who had acted so appallingly had already headed back to their car, oblivious to the storm which was heading their way.

I went over to the man who was now sitting up and looking mighty shaken.

I knelt down and apologised and said that I would like to help him. He looked at me like I was crazy and shook his head and started to move away.

I did not carry money, only cards with ridiculously high credit limits. I would have happily given him one of these and the PIN number but he would not have been able to use it without causing suspicion.

“Please,” I called after him. “Come with me to an ATM and I will give you money for whatever you need.”

It was no good. I was the respectable member of society now, a figure not to be trusted by an outcast.

Feeling dreadful, I got back in the car.

The concert that followed was background noise. My mind was on how I could make things right.

By the time I was being driven back to my townhouse, I knew that one man, no matter how rich, could not eradicate the poverty and abuse that drove people out onto the streets, but I could make a difference.

I set up meetings with a number of established charities. People, I figured, who knew what they were doing. This was going to be my focus from now on.

I was feeling slightly better, when one of my assistants presented me with a folder and told me they were suggestions of candidates for a new security company.

I flicked through the details listlessly. I was wondering if I might just leave it, when I came across a company that sparked my interest.

There was a photograph of each member of staff. They were wearing regular clothes and smiling.

Like regular human beings did.

I hired them on the spot and, a few hours later, a woman walked into my office, introduced herself as Mary, my new security guard, and held out a hand for me to shake.

I was so preoccupied with more ideas of how I could make a difference to the world, that I forgot for a moment that I had hired new security.

“Is something wrong?” she asked.

“No,” I replied. “I just wasn’t expecting you, that’s all.”

She smiled and said, “Well, I will just blend into the background.”

And she did… only, over the next few days I could not help but notice her.

I hope I don’t sound like a creep here, but her eyes were the most amazing green colour and she had this way of tucking her hair behind her ear that made my skin tingle.

It had been a long time since I had been close to anyone and she had struck a chord in my heart.

Mary alternated shifts with another couple of guards, Matt and Joe, both of whom were down to earth and discreet and very likeable.

One evening, when Mary was due to be on duty, I must admit I was disappointed when Matt turned up.

“No Mary?” I asked as casually as I could.

“Not tonight,” Matt told me.

“No problems. It’s good to see you as always,” I told him.

And it was, but I found that I could not stop thinking about Mary. I guess my crush on her had gotten real bad.

I actually felt like a naïve teenager again.

And I behaved like one. I told Matt I was going to my room, then sneaked out of a window and jogged away from the townhouse.

I had no idea what I was doing other than that I really wanted to see Mary and tell her how I felt.

It was crazy, I knew and the most likely outcome was that I would make a total fool of myself because she did not have feelings for me.

If that was the case, I would say sorry and back off and never bother her again.

But I was going to give it a shot.

I realised I was close to the office address of the security company that Mary, Matt and Joe worked for.

Maybe Mary would be there, doing paperwork, or something like that.

Clutching at straws, I headed for the address.

It was a pretty-run down building in a run-down district to be honest. There was graffiti on the walls and the windows had shutters over them. Perhaps they are keeping overheads down by basing themselves here, I wondered, as I pressed the buzzer and smiled up at the lone, rusty camera over the door.

The door opened with a click and I went in.

A carpet that had seen much better days lined a hallway with a number of closed doors on either side. One of them opened and a man not much older than me popped his head out.

“Mr Turner,” he said, “I’m Bill Walters, I run this place, and I recognise you from the society pages.”

“That’s right,” I mumbled. I had no idea what to say next.

He looked a bit uncomfortable and invited me into his office. Once I’d taken a seat, he asked me, “Is there something wrong, Mr Turner? I see Matt is not accompanying you as he should be.”

“There’s no problem,” I told him. “Truth is, I lied to Matt and he does not know I am here. Please, I don’t want him to get him into any trouble. He’s fantastic. All your staff are.”

He smiled. “Glad to hear it, but I take it there is a reason for your visit.”

I swallowed uncomfortably. I could not possibly tell him I was desperate to see Mary and I was wishing by now that I had stayed home.

His smile softened and he said in a gentle voice, “Why don’t I get us both an iced tea and then we can talk or just sit and enjoy the drink. You’re the client. What do you say?”

I felt a strong liking for him at that moment. I got the feeling he was a man who had been through a lot and had a kind heart.

“That sounds great,” I told him.

He nodded and left the room.

I took a deep breath then actually laughed at myself. I was being such an idiot.

I decided to head off. I’d thank Walters for the offer of tea and his warm welcome but tell him that I had an appointment to go to.

While I was waiting for him to return, I looked around his office. It was small and dusty, with one filing cabinet and a laptop on his desk that looked about ten years old and not much else… except there was something in the floor.

In the corner.

It looked like a hatch.

I got up and went for a closer look.

It was a hatch. There was a small handle on one edge.

I lifted the handle. The hatch opened and I found myself staring down at a staircase.

I should have waited for Walters and asked him where the staircase led, but curiosity got the better of me.

I began to descend the stairs.

There was a light ahead of me somewhere. It was pale and flickering and made my shadow dance on the stairs as I continued downwards.

Finally, I emerged into a basement. There was a lightbulb glowing in the ceiling, and it revealed a shocking sight.

There was a metal cage in the basement and through its bars I could see a figure curled up on the floor.

It was Mary. She was breathing gently. It looked like she was asleep.

And she was being held prisoner. I was appalled.

I had no idea what sickening fate Walters had in store for her or if anyone else knew he was keeping her locked up down here.

All that mattered there and then was that I free her.

There was a padlock on the cage door. An old man I had know in my street days had taught me how to pick locks and I had the thing open in seconds.

I stepped inside the cage. Whispered, “Mary, it’s me.”

I knew I had to be quick and quiet as I could because Walters would be back in his office any minute and see the open hatch.

He would know his foul crime had been discovered.

Mary stirred a little at my voice. I moved towards her and said, “I’ll get you out of here, get you somewhere safe.”

She rolled over and opened her eyes.

Only, when she saw me, she looked horrified. “No,” she said, “You have to leave. Now.”

“I don’t understand,” I said.

“You…” she began to say, then arched her back and cried out. “It is risen,” she said, “It is time.”

As she spoke, hairs began to emerge from the skin of her hands and her neck and her face. Within seconds they were covered in a thick layer of dark hair.

And then there was a cracking sound, and her entire body began to change.

Her limbs lengthened and in places broke through her clothes. Revealing more thick, dark hair. Her nose and mouth became swollen and I could see between her lips that her teeth were growing longer and sharper.

Her fingernails as well were transforming. They were becoming claws.

I stood and watched, gripped by cold, paralysing fear.

Mary, the thing that Mary had become, crouched before me on all fours, looked at me with red, piercing eyes and growled.

Suddenly I was grabbed from behind and pulled away and out of the cage then pushed towards the bottom of the stairs.

All the strength had gone from my legs and I collapsed and could only watch as Walters closed the cage door and locked the padlock.

Just in time, because the thing that had been Mary launched itself at the door.

Its claws struck the bars and its snout pushed against them. Foam was bubbling in its mouth and its eyes blazed with anger.

Then it raised its head and howled.

The sound cut through me, and I recoiled.

Walters turned away from the cage and came over to me. “Come on,” he said. “I’ll pour us a glass of something stronger than iced tea and explain.”

Back in his office he took a bottle of bourbon and a couple of glasses out of his desk drawer and poured us both a stiff measure.

Then he said, “I believe that people should be able to live their life without prejudice or fear, even if they have certain afflictions, say, lycanthropy.”

My head began to spin as I realised what he was saying and it took a moment before I could splutter, “You mean Mary is a werewolf.”

“Yes. And tonight is the full moon, which is why she is locked in a cage. It is for her own protection and the protection of other people who she might attack in her lycanthropic state. It is something she does every full moon – and does voluntarily, I must stress.”

“And the rest of the time? I asked.

“She is a big-hearted, funny, strong, independent woman. But surely you don’t need me to tell you that. You’ve seen a lot of her since she started working as part of your security team.”

Which was true, but I had never had an inkling there was anything so strange about her. I did think I saw what was happening here, though.

“So,” I said, “You employ her because she has special powers, which can be utilised on top secret missions.”

A small smile played at the corner of his lips. “No,” he answered, “I employ Mary because she is hard working and wants to earn an honest living. As for the rest, her condition, we manage that together so that it causes as little disruption as possible.”

“I understand,” I said. “And the others on your staff, are they the same?”

He leant forwards. “That is between them and me.”

I looked into his eyes. I admired what he was doing. It took guts as well as compassion.

I raised my glass and echoed his words of earlier. “To living life without prejudice or fear.”

We clinked glasses.

Afterwards, I walked home along the busy sidewalks. Every now and then I glanced up at the full moon and marvelled at the power it held.

Walters had told me before I left that he would let Mary know what we had talked about. He had explained that her memory of our encounter would be fractured, and he wanted to reassure her that everything was cool between us.

However, the next time she worked a shift as my security guard, I felt there was tension in the air between us and was glad when she asked if we could have a talk in private.

I closed my office door but before she could say anything I blurted out, “I’m sorry, for barging in on you like that.”

“You have nothing to apologise for,” she replied. “I’m glad you can handle the truth of what I am, and that I can still be your security.”

“I wouldn’t have it any other way,” I told her.

She smiled and turned to go, then hesitated, and looked back at me. “And, one more thing. I don’t need special werewolf senses to know that you like me. You’ve been broadcasting it for weeks now. And you’re a really sweet and handsome guy, but I’m sorry, you’re just not my type.”

She left, closing the door quietly behind her.

I sat there for a while, my heart gently breaking.

Time passed then, as it does and, to an extent, time healed.

I lost myself in my charitable work and did not realise that another full moon was due to rise on the horizon on that fateful Friday night until Mary told me she would be leaving early and why.

Before I could stop them the words were out of my mouth: “Walk you to your cage.”

I could have kicked myself. I should not try and be funny because I rarely am.

To my immense relief, she laughed and said, “Sure, why not. But no funny business, this lady has claws.”

I laughed as well. Mary phoned Walters to let him know we were heading over together and asked him to update the next guard due on shift.

We left the townhouse together. The sky was clear. Dusk was a little while off yet and Mary seemed happy to stroll at a relaxed pace.

“He’s a nice guy,” I said.

Mary raised a quizzical eyebrow.

To which I supplied an answer: “Walters.”

She smiled. “He is. I was in a pretty bad way when we met. I couldn’t hold a job down. I was moving from place to place. At times I felt like I was on the run, only I was trying to run away from me. I don’t think it is an exaggeration to say he saved me.”

“How did you become like you are?” I asked.

She looked away from me, and once again I wished I had kept my stupid mouth shut. “I’m sorry,” I said. “I went too far.”

“It’s Ok,” she said after a pause. There was a wistful look in her eyes when she went on: “I was in love, with someone amazing, someone who filled my every waking moment with excitement. It was in their embrace that I felt the werewolf’s bite under the light of the blood moon.”

She fell silent after this.

Twenty minutes or so later, we reached the office. “You should come in,” she said, “Say hi to Walters before he goes down into the basement with me.”

“Sure,” I replied and followed her inside.

The moment I stepped into the corridor I smelt the aftershave.

A memory hovered just out of reach.

The smell reminded me of something.

Mary opened the door to Walters' office and froze.

“Come in, and bring your friend with you” a voice from inside said.

A voice that, like the aftershave, I now remembered.

Malone stood in Walters' office. He was pointing a firearm at us.

Next to him, Walters was slumped in his chair. He was bound with thick rope and one of his eyes was bruised and swelling closed.

“Turner,” Malone said brightly. “So glad you could join this little party. It would not be happening without your lousy treatment of my company. Firing us just because a couple of the boys cleared the trash out of the way of your nice shiny limousine.”

I wanted to tell him his boys were mindless thugs but bit my lip.

He grinned at me as he went on. “After your unacceptable behaviour, I decided to look into the company you had hired to replace mine. And you know what, my guts straight away told me there was something off about them. Like they were hiding something. So, I decided to call in and have a quiet word with the boss man here. Persuade him to tell me everything.”

Walters grimaced and said in a hoarse voice, “There’s no need for any of this. We’re legit and if you leave now I won’t call the cops. We can all move on.”

Malone span round, pistol whipped Walters.

By my side, I noticed Mary tensing. “Don’t,” I whispered, “If we go for Malone, he will shoot us.”

“It’s not that,” she hissed back. “It’s the moon. It’s time.”

Her eyes closed, her back arched and she cried out.

Walters looked at Malone and said, “You need to get out now while you can. You don’t know what you are dealing with.”

The sneer on Malone’s face grew wider. “I think I do. You see, I did some digging on this lady here and learnt she had to leave more than one town real quick right after a full moon. That leads me to one obvious conclusion. She’s a wolf in waiting and that’s why this piece is loaded with silver bullets.”

He pointed the barrel at Mary who, by now, had completed her transformation. She was looking back up at him with savage intent in her eyes.

But she would die in a hail of silver bullets before she could reach him.

Tears of impotent rage began to fall down my face. There was nothing I could do.

Nothing anyone could do.

Or so I thought.

I noticed out of the corner of my eyes that Walters was on his feet. That the ropes lay snapped on the floor. He fixed Malone with his gaze and said quietly, “Enough.”

As he did, I saw the fangs in his mouth, and the way his face had changed. His skin was drawn back, his ears were sharp tips at the top, and his nose was flattened and raised. Bat-like.

Vampiric.

Malone must have realised this the instant I did, because he turned the barrel towards Walters.

It was the last thing he ever did.

This all happened many years ago. I am an old man now. I winter in Florida and spend my summers in New England. Sometimes, I talk with my friends about the events of that night.

Taking a life was the last thing any of us wanted to happen, but it was self-defence, and Malone’s body was never found.

We don’t linger on that subject long. We reminisce instead about the adventures we have had together since.

Walters has not aged one bit and Mary is as beautiful as ever.

I’m the one whose skin is wrinkled and whose joints ache.

But I can still hold a glass of bourbon and raise it in a toast: “To living life without prejudice or fear.”
