The maggots that had previously been on Joe’s body also seemed to be leaving his corpse, revealing the extent of his injuries. Thousands more larvae were crawling from the hallway underneath the doorway into my office, and the remnants of my apple were also being vacated. Looking left towards the window, I realised they were exiting through it as a collective, crawling out into the clouded day. I made my way over to the window, originally attempting to avoid the larvae before giving up and stepping on them flatly, it was just impossible to miss them at this point. I looked out the window to the woods that faced the surgery at the south of the town and could see millions of maggots leaving windows, cars, crawling down roads, all on their way deep into the woods. The woods themselves were no more than deeply rotten trees that held rotten fruit, the ground that could be seen under the writhing mass was brown and wet.

I didn’t even feel curious. I don’t know what I felt. I can only tell you that I climbed out of the window and dropped down to the wet, brown floor. I felt compelled, driven, forced to follow. And I did. I no longer felt fear, I felt nothing. It was as if I was in a trance, one foot forward, then the next. On the squelching ground of mud and larvae. One foot forward, then the next. On the rotten fruit and plants. One foot forward, then the next. Deeper and deeper into the woods.

I am unsure how far I walked, only that when I started to regain a feeling of self it was night-time. I must have walked for miles. I stopped walking once I felt this, relieved from my trance, at the edge of a small clearing that was lit by a dozen flaming torches with a small wagon in the middle; it was painted intricately in a green, almost paisley pattern of teardrops, no one spot could be focused upon at a time; it was as if the pattern moved in the torchlight, flickering with the flames and alive in the night. All of what would be its wooden chassis were either plated or solid gold, down to the wheels that were planted into the green ground… green… the only greenery I had seen for God knows how long was in this clearing. The maggots that had already reached the clearing ignored the various flowers, plants, and grass that grew within the circle, instead writhing their way into the wagon through its gold door that was wide open.

I felt a small hand grasp my left and then a smaller one grasp my right. I looked down, in turn, to see the two boys from the pub, only now they were smiling. I couldn’t help but smile back, no matter how hard I tried, I must have been delirious at this point. What I saw was pure joy in their faces, faces of pure delight. They looked like children now, their wrinkles and crows-feet had gone, and their now healthy cheeks glowed red.

“You did it, sir, you did it!” I looked to my left, the smaller boy exclaimed this whilst excitedly jumping up and down. The taller boy to my right spoke.

“Go on, go and see Old John, we’ve told him all about you!”

They both let go of my hands simultaneously and ran into the green space giggling and wrestling each other playfully. It was now I could see the small tails and wings they both had on their naked bodies. I walked past them playing, wrestling in the ground and the air, as I went up the small steps into the wagon.

Ducking my head into the wagon, the floor was alive with millions of maggots. The interior was gold plated or filled with a soft, red fabric covering the walls and ceiling. Gold, silver, and dozens of other jewels in the forms of plates, cups, necklaces, and other forms covered the surfaces, scattered everywhere priceless artifacts, hanging from the walls and covered in maggots on the floor. And in the bed at the far end of the wagon, a heavily decomposed body that I assumed to be Old John, dressed in a worn suit. I stepped closer to him only to realise that the body was not that of a man, but that of millions of dead maggots that had rotted away, as if impersonating the body of a man in a sick caricature. I turned to leave but found the boys blocking my path, I had not heard them sneak up behind me.

“Watch, watch!” they both exclaimed excitedly, pointing past me as they did so.

I did as I was told, and turned to where Old John lay. As if they were waiting for this as a cue, the millions of larvae that swarmed around my ankles crawled onto the bed. Over the course of several minutes, they ate through the dried, dead carcasses of the maggots that came before, filling Old John’s suit with their new form. A leg was formed first, his loafers filled, then the other. His arms were made next, slowly producing hands and then ten distinct fingers made from tightly wrapped maggots that somehow still managed to writhe. His chest and stomach filled too, filling out the suit that he had originally laid in before finally a head and face was created, or something that at least resembled one. He had no eyes and the nose and lips he possessed could not be used to speak or smell. He was only larvae.

There was silence. Every maggot had entered the wagon and into Old John, the only ones remaining on the floor were the ones that I had accidentally crushed through my presence. Old John, previously lifeless, started twitching as if he had bones; his fingers moved individually, his neck moved left and right steadily, and his knees and elbows bent gently. The boys giggled the entire time before Old John laid still for a second. Then he sat up, rotated his legs, and sat at the edge of the bed facing the three of us.

“Old John!” The boys rushed past me, excitedly jumping on the bed next to the maggots masquerading as man. He spoke.

“Oh… boys… I have missed you so…,” his words were drawn out, laboured but booming. They did not seem to be coming from him, but instead, the entire room seemed to echo his sounds to the point that I could not pinpoint exactly where it was coming from. He embraced both the boys with a hug, one under each arm and, in turn, they kissed his cheeks, maggots stuck to their lips when they moved away.

“So… this… is the generous… virgin…,” he said looking towards me. I couldn’t speak, I could only stare.

“The generous virgin… of Staylittle village…,” if the creature could smirk, I could imagine that it would do so.

“But I’m not…,” I started to reply, for some reason the only thing that I could bring myself to do was correct him. I was terrified, but it’s strange what you focus on in high-intensity situations.

“You haven’t bedded a woman… then you are… a virgin…,” Old John replied, receiving a pipe and paddy cap from the boys who now stood behind the thing, their smiles no longer infectious to me but deeply disturbing. I now feared, more than ever for my own life. Old John could tell this and spoke after lighting his pipe and putting on his paddy cap. I’m unsure how he even smoked it, pressing it to his “lips” or the thrashing maggots that made them.

“You are safe… here… you are the guest… of honour… after all…,” he said, the boys nodding enthusiastically.

“Yes you are, sir, you helped us!” said the younger boy, putting on a more serious face behind his dancing eyes.

“The ritual couldn’t have been done without a virgin witness, and a generous version at that!” said the older boy, giving Old John another big hug from behind.

“They’re right… my friend… you were kind to these boys… unlike the folks at Staylittle… who ignored… left to die… and cursed at my boys…,” said Old John.

“But I’ve had-,” I started before being cut off immediately.

“Not… with a woman… my friend…,” the boys giggled behind Old John, “Now… I think it’s time… for you to go… my friend.”

My anxiety pranged and I started walking back to the door. The boys leaped off the bed and dashed towards me. I instinctively went to smack one but found I was unable to move, under the same trance that I was in before. I could already feel my eyes glazing over as the boys hugged me, I believe they thanked me but I could not truly hear. I stepped out of the wagon and made my walk home. I let my feet guide me as I had before. Despite it being dark, I could tell the wood was greener than it ever had been with flowers and fruit blossomed in bloom. As before, one foot forward, then the next. Through the long, wet grass. One foot forward, then the next. On the fresh dew and sprouted flowers. One foot forward, then the next. To home.

When I arrived home, the village of Staylittle was under quarantine. Men and women with hazmat suits swarmed the village, removing corpses and later spraying every surface they could find with anti-bacterial spray. Staylittle even made the news, the news that a deadly flesh-eating pathogen had ripped through the town, wiping out ten percent of the town’s population within days. Of course, I did not say the truth, I was already derided as a coward, the singular doctor of the town who decided to leave when the going got tough. My right to be a doctor was removed, and I am never allowed to work in medicine again. I am currently getting sued by several families at Staylittle. I narrowly avoided my death when my family home was set on fire by residents at Staylittle, the offence barely being investigated due to my actions. I no longer live in Staylittle. I changed my name to Hugh Scott. I had to let people know the truth.
