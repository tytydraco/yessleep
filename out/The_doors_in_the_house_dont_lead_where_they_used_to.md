My brother, Michael, is dead. I should probably lead with that. They found him 10 days ago, but from what the coroner said, he passed a long time before that, at least a month or two. I’ll spare you most of the grisly details that I wish the cops had spared me. He was severely malnourished, dehydrated, and everything else that comes along with that. There was plenty of food and water in the house, and he didn’t have any other injuries aside from some shallow cuts on his arms and hands. Doesn’t make sense, but it seems like he just decided to stop eating and drinking. Obviously not a decision made in any proper state of mind, but that’s unfortunately not too surprising.

I haven’t seen Michael in person for almost a decade. Around the time I went off to college, he was still living at home while he finished up at a local trade school. He wanted to be an electrician, I think. A couple months after I left, out of nowhere, my parents started calling me all upset and worried at least once a week. “Michael keeps disappearing for days at a time.” “Michael keeps yelling nonsense at your father.” “Michael showed up last night all confused.” It was always something new, and it was always about Michael.

I wish I could say I was a good brother and came home to help figure things out. But I didn’t. We were never that close growing up. I was a straight-A student that played clarinet in the wind ensemble. He was always in jeopardy of failing at least two classes and his only extracurricular was getting high with his friends. There was never any animosity between us, but there wasn’t any real sibling bond either. It sucked to hear what was happening (mainly how it affected my mom and dad) but I didn’t think I could really help any, and to be honest, I was more focused on school than anything else.

My parents tried to get Michael in to see professional help, but he refused. In fact, when they tried to push the issue, he left home for good. They had no idea where he went. They even filed a missing person report. Two months later they found him. He was living in some rundown old house out in the country, half an hour from the nearest paved road. No running water, no internet. The only power was from a pair of repurposed solar panels haphazardly mounted to the roof. Apparently, he bought the place and a small piece of land from some farmer nearby. Guess he still had a good chuck of his inheritance from our grandpa.

Of course, my parents tried to get him to come home, but again he refused. He said there were people watching him, following him. He didn’t even want people coming out to visit, since he was worried that they would lead whoever was trying to get him right to his doorstep. Even still, my dad went out to check on him every few days. For a while. Then he went every week. Then every couple weeks. Michael talked to him less and less every time he went out there. In the end, Dad said he only went out twice last year to check on him. Last time was almost a year ago. I think that part is really eating him up now.

So that’s the background. Onto the present. I’m in town for a week or so to help my parents sort things out. It’s the first time I’ve been back since high school. Once I finished college, I ended up getting married, then had a kid a year after that. Never was much time or reason to come back since my parents were more than happy to travel to us for visits. But with this all happening the way it did, I figured the least I could do was come help my mom and dad with the funeral arrangements and all of that. Funeral is set for next weekend, so that’s squared away. Michael didn’t have a will or anything, and as far as we can tell, the house, the land, and his truck are the only things he had left to his name. The police just finished up with the place a couple days ago, so I went out to take a look around.

When I say the place is remote, I’m really underselling it. There’s nothing to see for miles around aside from tall grass, low hills, and a single winding dirt road that runs roughly north to south. A barely defined driveway leads from that road another quarter mile east before it ends unceremoniously at a two-bedroom hovel with cracked plastic siding and a roof with maybe half the shingles still intact. By the time I pulled up, I could barely see the chipped blue paint of my sedan underneath the thick layer of dirt. There’s a hand-pump well out front and a leaning carport with a dusty red pickup truck wedged inside. And that’s it. The whole place gives me *Deliverance* vibes, it’s just missing the inbred kid with the banjo.

The place is even more depressing on the inside though. It barely feels lived in. Peeling wallpaper, cracked windows. The living room has a two-seater sofa, a broken lawn chair, and a coffee table. And that’s the most furnished room in the whole place. The first bedroom has a mattress on the floor with a nasty looking blanket balled up on top. The second bedroom has a couple boxes of Michael’s things that he apparently never even unpacked. The bathroom has the usual equipment (toilet, sink, shower, etc.) but nothing in any of the cabinets or drawers. And lastly, the kitchen is barren too aside from the standard appliances. No utensils or pans. Some beer, a couple canned vegetables, and two frozen dinners in the fridge are the only real signs anyone’s been here in the last year. As I was walking through the first time, I kept spooking myself. Thought I heard someone knocking on the door or opening the fridge.

They said they found him in the bedroom, leaned against the wall. Thankfully the clean-up crew did a decent enough job that you can’t really tell. If anything, that corner is far cleaner than the whole rest of the house now. Kinda morbid to think about. The whole place feels eerie. I’ve never been here before, and there’s barely any sign of Michael at all. And yet, I still feel something when I’m standing inside. Like I can feel some sort of connection being in the same place he did for the last part of his life. Something I never felt when we were growing up together, when he was still alive. Sounds stupid. Probably is stupid. Even so, it was enough for me to sit on the filthy couch for a bit and wait for the odd feeling to pass.

Mom asked me to bring all of Michael’s stuff back to their place so they can sort through it. I was worried I’d have to make multiple trips, but after seeing it all, I figured I probably wouldn’t even have to open my trunk. Unless she really wanted a ratty mattress or a lawn chair in two pieces. I brought the boxes from the spare bedroom out first, followed by the food from the fridge. Honestly should’ve just tossed that stuff in the trash, but whatever. As I was doing one last walkthrough of the place, I noticed something in the bedroom. Sticking out from under the mattress, I spied something bright red.

Upon closer inspection, I realized it was a spiral bound notebook, like the kind you have to bring for middle school. Pushing back the grungy old mattress, I find more of them. All different colors, some clearly more used, others still sealed in plastic. At least a dozen in total. I started piling them up and flipping through the ones that weren’t sealed. They were diaries. The dates go back to when I was still in college. It’s definitely Michael’s handwriting. He always had surprisingly good penmanship.

I flip through a couple of the older looking ones, but nothing immediately jumps out at me. Some strange passages that gave me déjà vu of the things Mom and Dad would describe on the phone. Paranoid type stuff, random diagrams that didn’t make any sense, a couple creepily detailed drawings of people and figures I didn’t recognize. I wondered why the police hadn’t taken them, but I don’t know how that whole process works. I guess if it was clear there wasn’t any foul play they wouldn’t really need to take “evidence.”

Intrigued, but not wanting to spend any more time in the house than I already had, I stacked all the journals up and brought them out to the car as well. After almost 45 minutes, I was finally back on the highway heading towards town. I had initially planned on bringing the stuff straight to my parents’ house, but as I was driving, I started to have second thoughts. The most recent diary’s first entry was dated only about a year ago. I didn’t see how it ended. I was worried it might be graphic, or it might have some sort of “goodbye” message.

My mom’s been a mess since one of the neighboring farmers found Michael. Since she first got the call from the police. If these diaries contained something particularly heavy, I didn’t want to just toss them in my mom’s lap and let her have at it. At the very least, I felt like I should have an idea of what to expect. So instead of driving to their place, I headed back to my hotel. I called them and told them I had the stuff and would be by in the morning. I left out the notebooks for the time being.

Which brings us to now. It’s almost 3 in the morning here. I just finished reading through Michael’s last diary. And now I’m typing it up. There’s a knot in my stomach. I should just go to sleep. But I can’t. I think I’m just trying to make sense of it still. Reading it through once left me with a funny feeling I can’t shake. Maybe someone on here will have more luck wrapping their head around it. Sorry, I know this kind of thing isn’t normally allowed. But maybe just going through it one more time myself will offer some clarity. I don’t know. Just read it for yourself.

Below is Michael’s last journal. I will note any of my own thoughts in \[brackets\] if I think they’re necessary.

>***7/11/2024***

>*Dad just left. Wish he would stay away. It’s not safe. They always show up when people come by. Car didn’t look like dad’s when it pulled up. Checked when he left and it was his again.*

>***7/12/2024***

>*Haven’t seen any outside for a few days now. I think I finally scared them off. Hopefully can make it to the store soon, running low on food.*

>***7/13/2024***

>*Need to ask Paul if he needs any more work done on his combine. Paid enough last time for two months of food. Will get more rice, less meat. Rice goes farther.*

>***7/15/2024***

>*Spoke too soon. Saw one of them again when I got back from the store. Ran off into the grass before I could get close. Wish I still had my gun. At least I got enough food to stay inside for a while.*

>***7/16/2024***

>*Getting bolder. One was banging on the wall last night. Three knocks, four times. Twelve knocks.*

>***7/17/2024***

>*Quiet again. I made some food and turned the lights on. I don’t want to let them dictate how I live my life. I’m not afraid of them. They know more than I do, but I know something they never will.*

>***7/20/2024***

>*I’m pretty good at cooking rice.*

>***7/25/2024***

>*Over a week with no sign. New record.*

>***7/26/2024***

>*Sometimes I still miss having a TV. I used to watch the late night shows I wasn’t supposed to. Grayson would always tell on me. But TVs are too dangerous. You watch them while they watch you.*

>***7/27/2024***

>*They were inside the house last night. All the beer is gone. Empty can of corn on the ground. Maybe they’ve been inside for a while.*

>***7/28/2024***

>*Toilet flushed while I was sleeping. Gone by the time I got to the bathroom. I’m not safe here anymore. I never was.*

>***7/31/2024***

>*Every night, more sounds. Heard a shattering sound a bit ago, but can’t find anything broken. I got lost on the way to the kitchen.*

>***8/1/2024***

>*Saw a cat in a dream. Reminded me of Ringo, but he was only ever a kitten. Ran away. Mom said he found a new family.*

>***8/3/2024***

>*Got lost again. Opened the door to the bathroom but ended up back at my bed. Tried again and it worked right. Heard voices. Slept in the tub.*

>***8/4/2024***

>*Multiple voices from my room. Camera shutters. A terrible smell. Not leaving the bathroom, but getting hungry.*

>***8/7/2024***

>*Took two days to find the kitchen. Had to go through the closet door in the spare room. The door knob felt loose.*

>***8/28/2024***

>*Haven’t left the kitchen for the last couple weeks. I’ve tried. At least there’s food. Hearing the knocking again. Three knocks, four times. Twelve knocks.*

>***9/7/2024***

>*The front door doesn’t work anymore. It won’t open. Paul was outside but he couldn’t hear me.*

>***9/21/2024***

>*I tried to break one of the windows. It shattered, but when I looked away it was fixed again. Cut my arms up pretty good.*

>***9/22/2024***

>*I keep hearing the people in my room. The ones with the terrible smell. I took my notebooks with me so they can’t read them. My hands aren’t cut anymore.*

>***10/1/2024***

>*I got outside. Through the cabinet under the sink. But one of them drove up in my truck. I had to run into the field. Ended up in my closet. Tried the sink cabinet again, but it only led back to itself.*

>***10/31/2024***

>*Happy Halloween*

>***11/8/2024***

>*Food should be gone by now. Some days it is. Some days there’s food I never bought. When I find the kitchen, I stay for a few days. Ate some corn and drank three beers. All that was left. There will be more next time. Maybe.*

>***11/9/2024***

>*The knocking lasts for days. Three knocks, four times. Twelve knocks.*

>***11/2024***

>*Watch died. Not enough sun through windows. Can’t tell days anymore. My arms are cut and bleeding again.*

>***11/2024***

>*Been in the living room. All the doors lead back here. Someone sat next to me, I saw the cushion move.*

>***12/2024***

>*I think it’s December*

>***12/2024***

>*Three knocks, four times. Twelve knocks.*

>***12/2024***

>*Merry Christmas?*

>***1/2025***

>*Happy new year?*

>***???***

>*Not worth keeping track anymore. Saw a cat outside. Looked like Ringo.*

>***???***

>*I’m never getting out of here*

>***???***

>*Brushed my teeth. They’re falling out.*

>***???***

>*Back in the kitchen. There’s food but I don’t want it. It makes my stomach hurt. I already ate this food.*

>***???***

>*Think I almost got out, but I think it was a dream. I can’t tell when I’m sleeping.*

>***???***

>*Tried to break through the walls. Now I’m stuck. Can barely see.*

>***???***

>*I hear someone outside, in the rooms. All of them. All at once. I bang on the walls. Three knocks, four times. Twelve knocks. Three knocks, four times. Twelve knocks.*

>***???***

>*\[Lots of unintelligible scribbling and tally marks on this page.\]*

>***???***

>*I made it back to my bedroom. I don’t want to leave again. Could get stuck. Could get lost. Smells bad. Stains. Flashes when I close my eyes.*

>***???***

>*Kitchen could be miles away. Don’t want that food anyways.*

>***???***

>*One two three. Four five six. Seven eight nine. Ten eleven twelve.*

>***???***

>\[There is a crude drawing of a black and white cat.\]

That was the last entry. Nothing but blank pages after. I never knew Michael had gotten this bad. I should have known. I should have listened. But it’s all too late now. I’ve considered reading more of the diaries, but I don’t think it will help. If they’re all like this, I don’t know if I can make it through them. Reading this through a second time and typing it down, it only made that funny feeling I felt in his house even stronger. Like a nauseating nostalgia for something I don’t even remember. I’m glad I got all his stuff when I went earlier, because I sure as hell don’t have any plans of going back.

Guess I should get some sleep, I’m rambling at this point. Sorry for wasting everyone’s time, but I guess this helped at least a little to get it on (digital) paper. I don’t normally partake in the hotel mini-bars, but tonight seemed like as worthy an occasion as any. Nothing like some cheap liquor on the rocks out of a disposable plastic cup for a nightcap. A toast to my late brother, I suppose.

Finding the ice machine was a nightmare though. The layout in this place makes no sense at all.
