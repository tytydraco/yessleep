it had been nearly six hours since i started writing code when i first noticed it. before i get into what happened, you should know: i am a cs major. i fit the stereotype: high-powered specs, mostly unshaven face, occasional gym visits at odd hours, and always a diet coke or coffee in hand. none of that really matters except that i had been working on a paper and showed up at my desk at 9 am, as usual. the usual morning rush was there: undergrads running to class, professors heading to lectures, and some sleep-deprived seniors scrambling to meet deadlines. as i said, everything was: just usual. another morning in an engineering building.

i took the elevator to my floor, sat down with my coffee, wired in my headphones, and got to work. by 1 pm, hunger kicked in. josh, my lab mate, who sat opposite to me, hadn’t shown up. maybe he was working from home, i really didn't care. i brushed it off and kept going. at 3 pm, i couldn’t ignore my hunger anymore. i unplugged my headphones from my laptop and connected them to my phone. i don’t like walking without music. it leaves me alone with my thoughts and my thoughts aren’t exactly the most encouraging ones out there. sometimes, it fuels random grand scenarios in my head where i do stuff i possibly can't do in real life. if research doesn’t work out, maybe i should consider film-making. but hey that is not what i am here for. i am here because i am stuck. let me walk you through what exactly has happened to me.

i got up from my desk, and the hall seemed empty, i figured people had either gone out for classes, or perhaps they were just out for their lab meetings or whatever. took the elevator to the 10th floor for the cafeteria. oddly, it went down first, then straight up. no one boarded at the ground floor. i got off the elevator, and walked into the cafeteria. here is when i started noticing it.

the cafeteria was completely empty. I scurried across to the study hall on the other end of the 10th floor. empty. every corner of the 10th floor was dead silent. an eerie feeling started to creep in. i was no longer wearing my headphones, i had removed them and put them on my head to return to reality. i hurried back down. my workspace was deserted, but had it always been? the emptiness felt too complete, like it had been this way for hours. where the hell did everyone go? i rushed to the ground floor. nothing. no security, no students. i stepped outside. the sky was…wrong. a deep red-orange hue, unnatural for 3:15 pm. the street which is usually packed with students and outsiders alike, was abandoned.

panic set in. i called josh. no service. the wifi still showed as connected, but nothing loaded. messages didn’t get sent. phone calls failed. it was as if the world had shut me out. i turned back to the building. the other elevator was still running, moving between floors, stopping randomly. but no matter how many times i pressed the button, it never came for me.

maybe this was a dream. maybe if i go back and try to sleep, i can just wake up to normalcy. i returned to my desk. leaving the building felt worse. if this was something out of *coherence*, then waiting it out seemed like my best option. my head ached. i tried to sleep.

when i woke up, my phone read 15:29. weird. i was sure I had slept longer. my analog watch, however, showed 7:27. am? pm? if it was pm, why was it still bright outside? i turned back to my screen, mind racing. then, something small caught my eye. i got distracted for just a second. that’s when i saw that stupid github copilot was still working and suggesting an auto-completion for a line in my code. i figured that it might be my only connection to something beyond this void. i started typing, trying to trick it into giving me a way out. i asked for steps to access an external site. instead of real steps, it generated a bizarre, randomized link.

i hesitated. then clicked. and it led me here. so here i am. confused as hell. starving. scared—but keeping it together. someone here must have seen something like this before.

i low-key wish i had not seen what i saw right outside my window. but it was only after i finished completing a draft of this post when i noticed it: a cross taped to the window, from the outside. and then i suddenly [remembered. you can come and save me. will you?](https://theghostinmymachine.com/2014/06/25/the-most-dangerous-games-elevator-to-another-world/)
