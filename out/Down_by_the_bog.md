When you're a senior in high school, you think you have everything figured out. You and your friends get together and make plans for the future, fully believing it will all work out. Careers are decided, trips are mapped out and you just know everything will go to plan, but then life comes along and just happens. College, a job, falling in love. Eventually, all those plans grow more and more distant, and the ties that held those old high school friendships together seem to just fade away.  

 

I was on my way home from work on a Friday evening when I got a call from an unknown number. Normally, I would just let it go to voicemail. But today for some reason I decided to answer. I thought that maybe if it was a scam call, I could at least have a little fun with it. 

“Hello?” 

“Hey man, how's it hanging?” Asked a man’s voice. 

“Uh, good. Who is this?” I responded. 

“Oh shit, I guess it has been a while. Its Sam, Sam (Redacted).” 

I laughed, I thought the voice sounded familiar, Sam had been my best friend in high school, but we hadn't talked in years. "Sam! Dude how long has it been? 9, 10 years? 

Sam chuckled, “Yeah, more like 12. How you been asshole?” 

“I've been good man, how about you?” 

“Living the dream bro. Hey, guess who I ran into the other day?” 

“Who?” I asked. 

“Josh, you remember Josh, right?” 

“Yeah, yeah of course. I haven't seen him since high school though, how is he?” 

Sam, Josh and I had been inseparable as teenagers, but over time we had just grown apart. 

“He’s good,” Said Sam, “Do you remember how we use to always talk about getting together and heading down to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, but the timing never worked out?” 

It was true, one of us was always busy with work or school, or girls and the long talked about trip never came to fruition. 

“Yeah, I remember.” I said. 

“Well, we got to talking and it turns out we are both free this time around.” Said Sam. 

“Okay.” I said, knowing where this was going. 

“So, what do you say? You still up for the trip?” 

I sighed. “I don't know man, I've kind of got a lot going on right now. I just started this new job and my girlfriend and I are moving in together. The timing is just a bit off for me right now.” 

“Come on Ben, we may never get another chance to take this trip.” Said Sam. 

The truth was, it had been a really long time and we were all different people now. I wasn't sure I even wanted to go anymore. I really just wanted to focus on my career and my future with Alice. On the other hand, it would be really good to see the guys again. 

“Look, I'm not saying no. Just let me sleep on it, okay?” 

“Alright man, give me a call and let me know. Either way we should try to hang out soon.” 

 

When I got home, I had a long talk with Alice about the guys and the trip we had always wanted to take. 

“It sounds like a fun trip, and your friends really want you to go.” She said. 

“I want to go too, I just don't know if the friendship is still there like it was before. I mean, we haven't exactly stayed in touch over the years.” 

Alice smiled, “Look babe, I can't tell you what to do here. If you want to go you should go, just don't find you a Cajun girl while you're down there.”  

I smiled back and kissed her, “How’d I get so lucky to get a girl like you?” 

She grinned up at me, “We both got lucky.” 

 

The next morning, I called Sam to tell him I was In and a week later we were on the road. For the most part we followed the course we had drawn out in high school. We had planned on making more stops when we were younger, really stretching the drive and getting the most of it. But adult life necessitated that we make the 20-hour drive as quick as possible. 

 We took turns sleeping and driving nonstop, which was absolutely fucking miserable. The long drive however proved my previous fears about our friendships to be completely unfounded. The three of us quickly fell into the familiar pattern of shit talking and cracking jokes, just like the old days.  

 

We were a few hours out from our destination when we stopped to get gas. It was one of those old timey gas stations, like you would see in a cheesy slasher flick. 

“You guys want anything?” Asked Josh as he headed for the door. 

I shook my head, “I'm good.” 

“Grab me a baja blast.” Said Sam. 

I stepped out of the Jeep to pump the gas. Josh had been driving but I would take over for the rest of the drive. 

“Pennsylvania huh?” Said a deep Cajun accented voice from behind me.  

I turned to see an old man with a bushy gray beard looking at our license plate. 

“You boys are a long way from home, aren't ya?” 

I nodded and cleared my throat, “Uh yeah, it's been quite a drive.” 

The old man smiled, “Yall come down here for Mardi Gras?” 

“Yeah, yeah, it's something we wanted to do since we were in high school.” 

The old man nodded, “I thought as much. Just make sure y'all stay on the main road, we wouldn't want you boys getting lost down by the bog.” 

I nodded and smiled politely, “No, we wouldn't want that.” 

He leaned in and gave me a sly grin, “Old Dr. Weller down there aint had any new blood for a good while now, and I'm sure he's wantin it.” 

I squinted at him in confusion, “Who?” 

“Never mind son,” He said laughing and patting me on the back, “Just stay out of the swamp and you'll be fine.” 

“I'm back fuckers.” Yelled Josh as he exited the gas station holding up Sam’s baja blast in one hand and a 30 pack of beer in the other.  

I grinned and shook my head. While Sam and I had become marginally more responsible with age, Josh was the same as he always was. 

I turned back to where the odd old man had been standing but he was gone, I glanced around thinking maybe he had walked off somewhere but saw no sign of him. I finished pumping the gas and climbed into the driver's seat. 

“Home stretch boys.” I said putting the jeep into gear. 

I glanced back at the gas station and saw the old man inside talking with the attendant, they were watching us as we pulled back onto the road.  

“Places like that give me serious hills have eyes vibes man.” Said Sam cracking open his soda. 

“Yeah dude I don't know how anyone lives out here in the middle of nowhere like this.” Said Josh. 

“Life, uh, uh, finds a way.” I said, doing my impeccable Jeff Goldblum impression. 

Josh laughed and Sam shook his head as we headed on down the road. 

 

Sam and Josh had both fallen asleep after about a half hour of driving. I checked the gps on my phone but the little car hadn't moved for the past few miles, no service out here. Oh well, I thought, by my reckoning we would be pulling into New Orleans around midnight. Sam snored loudly in the passenger seat next to me, so I turned up the radio to try and drown him out. I was getting pretty tired too, tired and irritable. I looked up from the radio and slammed on the brakes. 

“Oh Shit!” 

Something large and pale dashed across the road right in front of us. The tires squealed as I yanked the wheel to the side to avoid whatever it was, but the road was too narrow. We came to a sudden and jarring stop as the jeep slid off the road and slammed into the swampy water at the base of a mangrove tree. My head impacted the steering wheel, and I blacked out. 

“Ben! Ben!”  

Someone was shaking me. “Sam? What? What happened?” 

I shook my head, trying to clear it of the stars I was seeing. 

“Ben, are you alright?” Asked Sam as he shook me. 

I nodded glancing around, “Yeah, I hit my head, but I think I'm good.” 

There was water up the top of the jeeps hood and that was smashed in around a tree trunk. I turned to face Sam and saw that his face was covered in blood. 

“Dude, your face.”  

Sam shook his head, “Its fine, it was the air bag. Broke my god damn nose.” 

I nodded and turned to check on Josh, “Josh, hey man, you okay back there?” 

There was no answer. 

“Josh?”  

“Quit fucking around man, are you good?” yelled Sam.  

We both managed to get our seat belts undone and turned to check the back seat. Josh wasn't there. 

“What the fuck?” 

“Oh god.” Said Sam staring out through the shattered windshield. 

Up ahead, in the glow of the flickering headlights, was a bloodied and broken body bobbing in the water. 

We both started yelling for Josh as we climbed our way out of the submerged jeep and splashed our way over to our friend. We carried him as gently but as quickly back up and onto the road. 

“Shit, he's not breathing.” Said Sam as we lay him out on the pavement, “Quick there are flashlights and a first aid kit under the back seat.” 

I ran back to the jeep and began searching for the emergency supplies as Sam started chest compressions on Josh. It took me a few minutes, and I had to duck under the murky water, but I could hear Josh beginning to cough as I climbed back out of the Jeep with the kit. 

“What the fuck happened?” Josh yelled between coughs, “What's wrong with my arm?”  

“Ben, hurry the fuck up!” Yelled Sam. 

“I'm here. I'm here.” I said as I stumbled up and flicked on one of the flashlights. 

Sam took the other light, and we shined them down on Josh’s mangled body. 

His body was covered in bleeding cuts, and the left side of his face had nearly been scraped away. His left arm was visibly broken, a shard of jagged bone protruding from the flesh just above his elbow. 

“How bad is it?” Asked Josh with a half-smile. 

“Well man, It aint good.” I said.  

“Fuck man, we have to get him out of here.” said Sam as he paced back and forth trying to get his phone to come on. “Dammit, its dead. Do you have yours?” 

I shook my head, “Mine was on the dash, it's probably at the bottom of the swamp.” 

Josh tried to reach for his pocket then groaned in pain, “I think I still have mine.” 

I bent down and removed the device from his pocked, “Shit.” He had it but it was shattered and soaked. 

“What the hell do we do now?” Yelled Sam. “How did this even happen?” 

I stood up and looked up the road, “There was an animal or something in the road, I swerved to miss it and lost control.”  

Sam shook his head and continued pacing and muttering to himself. 

“Look man, I'm sorry but right now we just need to get Josh some help.” 

“So, what do you suggest we do?” Sam asked.  

“I think one of us needs to go for help, while the other stays here with Josh.” 

Sam thought for a moment before nodding in agreement, “Ok, I'll stay.” 

I nodded, “Ill head back toward the gas station, hopefully I'll run into someone sooner. You guys just sit tight.”  

“Please hurry.” Said Sam, his face lined with concern as he looked down at Josh. 

I nodded and knelt down next to Josh, “Hey man, I'm gonna go get us some help. I need you to stay awake and keep an eye on Sam, okay?”  

Josh raised his good hand in a thumbs up, “Sure thing man.”  

His words were distorted from the wounds to his face. I felt sick, this was my fault. If anything happened to him... 

“I'm so sorry Josh, I...” 

“It's cool man, even with half a face I'm still better looking than either one of you.” 

The three of us laughed for a moment, then I stood and told them I'd be back soon and started walking. 

 

I was about 20 minutes down the road when I saw something up ahead in the gloom. It was distant and dim, but it looked like the glow of a porch light. I thought I would have to walk all the way back to the gas station, but if someone lived out here, I could get help to the guys that much quicker.  

After another few minutes I came to a path that led off of the road to the light source. The path was old; it looked like it was once a driveway but had grown thick with weeds. For some reason, I found myself not wanting to step off of the road. The old man at the gas station came to mind, what had he said? Mr. Weller? Dr. Weller? I shook my head, it didn't matter. That was just some crazy old man trying to scare the out of towners.  

The path curved and twisted around and eventually led to a relatively open area with a two-story brick building, it was overgrown and obviously abandoned. But the outside light was still on. 

“What the hell?”  

I approached the building, there were clearly words printed on the face of the building at some point, but time and neglect had all but wiped them away. Of the letters that remained, all I could clearly make out was “Hospital.” 

You know that part of your brain that tells you when something isn't right? Mine was screaming for me to turn and run away from this place, but I couldn't, my friends needed help. The outside light was on, maybe there was still power inside, maybe there was a working phone. 

I pushed open the front door of the hospital and stepped inside. 

I found myself standing in the waiting room. I shined my flashlight around, the walls were covered in mold, the floors caked with dirt and the old light fixtures dangled brokenly from the ceiling. But the most unsettling part was that all of the waiting room chairs had been turned to face the door I had just entered. I know it makes no sense but seeing those chairs turned at me, I felt an odd sense of intrusion, like I had just walked in on a private gathering. I felt like I was uninvited. 

I nearly turned and left right then but suddenly a sound echoed through the dark building. A phone was ringing; there was a phone here. Someone must have been living in the old hospital, and they had a phone.  

The ringing sounded like it was coming from the second floor, so I quickly made my way across the waiting room to the staircase. 

“Hello?” I called out, not wanting to surprise someone and end up getting shot, “Hello, I just need to use your phone. My friends and I were in an accident, we need help.”  

I stepped onto the second floor and immediately knew where the ringing was coming from. Just like the first floor, the second floor was dilapidated and dark, apart from one room. At the other end of the corridor was a shut office door with light pouring out from around the edges.  

“Hello?” I called out again, “Is anyone there?” 

Still no answer. I cautiously made my way across the corridor to the office door. As I approached, I could make out the name stenciled on the face of the door, “Dr. Weller.” 

I swallowed a lump in my throat and pushed open the office door. The inside of the office was an absolute wreck. There were old files and newspapers scattered in all directions, the desk sat crookedly on one broken leg, and the floor was completely covered in what looked like empty blood bags. curiously, most of them labeled O negative. In one corner of the office was what looked like a makeshift cot, made of chair pieces and lab coats.  

The phone on the desk had stopped ringing when I opened the door, but when I picked it up to call for help there was no dial tone. My stomach dropped when I realized it wasn't even plugged in.  

“What the...” 

I glanced around trying to understand what was happening. My eyes fell on one of the old newspapers. The front page read, “Local Dr arrested for occult practices” most of the article was unreadable due to water damage and age but this was what I could make out, “Doctor promises miracle cure to patients... Experimental type of bloodletting... Multiple counts of exsanguination... Patients and families horrified as...” 

Suddenly the phone started ringing again. I stared at it in horror, that wasn't fucking possible. My heart pounded as the phone kept on ringing. I watched in slow motion as my arm reached out and took hold of the phone. With a shaky hand I raised it to my ear and listened. I could hear voices; they sounded like they were far away but growing closer. My heart pounded harder when I realized it was Josh and Sam; I couldn't make out what they were saying but I could clearly hear them talking to each other. All at once there was the sound of hurried movement and Sam cried out. There was a wet ripping sound and Sams voice rose to a fever pitch and Josh let out a horrified shriek. I stood there, paralyzed as my friends screamed and screamed. 

I broke out of my paralysis and ran for the stairs; my heart skipped a beat when I stepped back into the waiting room. All of the chairs had now turned to face the staircase. This wasn't happening, it couldn't be happening. Maybe I hit my head harder than I thought and I was in a coma.  

Suddenly there came the sound of dozens of voices, all talking at once. Of all the horrific things the voices were saying, there was one word that stood out over and over again... “Run.” 

I ran across the room and out the door, I ran down the path and back to the road. My legs ached and my lungs were on fire, but I kept on running until I got back to the gas station. The attendant called emergency services when I told him about the accident. The attendant offered to drive me back to the scene of the accident, but I refused. I would not go back, I knew what the paramedics would find.  

Sam and Josh were never found. The police say there was no sign of a struggle, that most likely Sam went for help and got lost in the swamp. As for Josh, well the amount of blood he lost would have attracted predators. Thats the official story, but I know what happened. I realized it when I was standing in the office of Dr Weller. The pale blur I saw on the road, the thing I swerved to miss. It was wearing a lab coat.
