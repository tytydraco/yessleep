I realised there was a ghost in my window after Lucy moved out. 

I was slumped in my couch, aching with missing her, and then – you know how you feel when someone staring is at you, and look over and someone actually is? That happened. I could feel eyes on me, I looked around, and there she was, her reflection in our fifth-floor apartment window. 

My. My apartment. Lucy had moved out by then, and I was by myself. 

I stood up, I might have cried out from fear- I don’t remember  

(I don’t know why Lucy left, some bullshit about growing out of the relationship or whatever) 

I went over to the window, which looked over a narrow alley and snowy roofs. Our apartment building was in a street mostly with townhouses. 

My. My apartment building. 

Anyway, the face in the window didn’t budge, or blink. Just stared. I stared back. 

I couldn’t tell if the face was outside the window, or in the window, if that makes sense. On impulse, pushing the limp curtains fully aside, I opened the window. Wind howled in from the street-lit darkness. I quickly pulled the window close again. 

Her face glimmered back into the glass, backlit from the streetlight. 

And then I noticed- I’m not a noticing sort, which Lucy had pointed out but not while she was leaving, it seemed to take such a long time too, from when she said I’m leaving you, to when she actually banged out of the apartment dragging her suitcase, like an eternity- 

Oh right, I noticed her hair. It was all done up fancy, and there were lights- no, sparkles, like jewels in her hair, a trail of elaborate sparkles running from the tops of her ears towards the back. 

And then, as I stared and she stared back, tears running down her pale cheeks, it clicked. 

She was a bride. She was done up similar to girls at their weddings- we had been to a wedding a few months back, Lucy and I, and I remember the hair and the sparkling jewels curving around the bride's  forehead. Pretty. I had joked with Lucy she should wear her hair like that, and she had snapped “that’s not funny Charles”. 

Come to think of it, things kind of went downhill between us after the wedding. I asked her if she wanted to get married, and she said, “that’s not what this is about” and screwed up her mouth. I had felt like banging my head against the wall in frustration. “Then just tell me” I had yelled, begged. 

The girl opened her mouth and I remembered my living room was haunted. She looked like Lucy, but different. 

“Lucy?” I faltered, reaching my hand to the window. She also raised her hand, and through the ice touch of the glass I felt her fingers, warm and reassuring. 

The warmth of her fingers was the first thing that ignited actual fear in me. It blazed in me as my eyes stretched wide-open, and the blaze burned my fog of heartbreak and confusion and made me see clearly: The girl in the window wasn’t Lucy- in fact looked nothing like her- but a supernatural sad bridal creature, haunting me.  

I snatched my hand away and leapt back. The woman’s face shone brightly in the glass, and she smiled. Her painted lips moved.  

“Let me in Charles, I’m so cold.” 

I blinked. How could I – what did she mean? On impulse, I pulled the curtains, which had been hanging back, close together, and collapsed back on the couch.  

I realised I was sweating. And very soon after, a great wave of fatigue pulled me under, and I fell into the deepest slumber I have ever known.  

I forgot to think about Lucy much the next day. Occasionally the bride’s face in the window swam into my mind. I didn’t feel much fear anymore, and towards the end of the day, I found myself wondering if she would still be there.   

She was.  

We stared at each other. Our fingers touched through the glass. “Let me in-” her words glided into my brain. “I can help you. I know how you feel.”  

My brain jerked. I snatched my fingers away, and let the curtains fall. How could she know how I felt? The huge fatigue welled up in me again, and the image of the face the last thing I saw before everything went black. 

The next day was Saturday. For the first time since Lucy left, I was happy it was a Saturday, and the day didn’t loom pointlessly in front of me. I went straight to the local library, which I hadn’t visit since childhood, and dove into the local archives.  

In an hour or so I had found what I needed to know. My building was built on the site of a large old house. About fifty years ago, a young bride had jumped out of a balcony to her death after the groom-to-be jilted her the morning of their wedding, a sensational local news story. I stared at the young sad face of the bride in the digitized old newspaper, the same face that looked at me from my window every night, asking to be let back in. 

But even if I wanted to, how could I? That evening, I flung the window open, hoping to be rid of her longing stare into my soul. And there was nothing, just the street night glare and icy rush of window. The moment I pulled the window shut, she shone into the glass. “Let me in Charles. I can help you, I know how you feel.” 

They say you get used to everything, and soon I got used to that sad sparkly face in the window, yearning to come in, claiming to help me. And even though I couldn’t bring her back in, I think maybe she was helping me. Because I seemed to be thinking about Lucy less and less. I resumed my usual gym routine, and a few weeks after that visit to the library, I gave in to the insistence of my friends to set up a new dating profile. Very soon after that, I found myself going out on coffee dates, which then progressed to dinner dates, and from there to do-you-want-to-come-back-to-my-place dates with lovely Helen.  

As we settled on the couch, I turned and pulled Helen close to me, savouring this new romantic bliss.  

A shine caught my eyes and my eyelids fluttered opened. I glimpsed the face in the window over Helen’s shoulder, the sparkle and shine of her eyes and teeth and the jewels in her hair and the street lights dazzled me. I jerked away from Helen, and cried out. How could I have forgotten about her?  

Helen smiled politely at me. “What’s wrong Charles?” 

“The curtains-” I muttered and stood up and walked over to pull them close.  

The face came up so close I could feel the warmth of her skin. “Now Charles!” she begged. “Let me in now!” 

Without thinking, I pulled the window open. Icy air whooshed in.  

“Just want a breath of fresh air.” I heard myself explaining to Helen, who seemed quite motionless on the couch.  

I went back to the couch, and settled next to her. “Helen?” I placed my arms around her, pulling her towards me.  

And then I saw the sparkles in her hair, the jewels tucked in an elaborate and familiar pattern around her ears and curling back.  

I cried out in horror, reeling back. The face from the window was superimposed on Helen’s lively pretty features. “Oh Charles, it’s so warm here. Never let me back out.” 

“Helen!” I cried, horrified at what I had done. I grabbed her shoulders and started shaking her. “Helen, listen to me!” I shook her again, and she smiled at me, lying back on the couch, her face another’s.  

I took her by the hand, yanked her to her feet, dragged her to the window, and flung it open. “Out! Out!” I cried, and we tussled in the rush of cold black air. Her hands were strong on mine, pulling me through the window. All the lights and sparkles seemed to turn upside down, and suddenly I was dangling outside, with nothing beneath me. My hands gripped the railing, and I could feel a force greater than gravity pulling me down.  

“Charles!” screamed Helen. I looked up at her, and she bent towards me, her face her own.  “Hold on” she gasped, and she pulled at me. I was able to climb up and crawl in, gripping her arms. I heard her cries of pain but she remained steady. Once in, I immediately slammed the window shut, and we collapsed, entwined and panting on the floor.   

After a while we got up. Helen said casually she’s going to put the kettle on for a cuppa. It sounded like a good idea, and I said I wanted one too. As I followed her into the kitchen, I looked back at the living room window, which was black, reflecting the normal glare of street lights. Helen was kind and gentle to me.   

I never saw the face in the window again.
