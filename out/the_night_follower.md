 

Every night at exactly 3 a.m., a creature would pass by my house. It was a tall, thin figure, with long arms and legs that seemed to move in unnatural ways. Its skin was a sickly gray color, and its eyes glowed a bright, menacing red.

At first, I tried to ignore it, telling myself that it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. But every night, the creature would return, its presence becoming more and more unbearable with each passing night.

I tried to take pictures and videos of the creature, but they always came out blurry or distorted. It was as if the creature knew I was watching and didn't want to be seen.

As the days went by, the creature began to get closer and closer to my house. It would stand outside my window, staring at me with those glowing red eyes, and I could feel its breath on my skin.

I tried to tell myself that it was just a nightmare, that it couldn't possibly be real. But every time I saw it, felt its presence, I knew that it was all too real.

I was too scared to confront the creature, too scared to even approach it. I didn't know what it was capable of, and I didn't want to find out.

So every night, I would just lie in bed, heart racing, and wait for the creature to pass by. I could hear its footsteps as it walked past my window, and I could feel the weight of its presence, like a heavy blanket suffocating me.

I didn't know how to make the creature go away, how to banish it from my life. I felt trapped, like a prisoner in my own home, unable to escape the creature's grasp.

I began to lose sleep, becoming more and more exhausted with each passing night. I tried to talk to my friends and family about the creature, but they just brushed it off, telling me that it was just my imagination.

But I knew that it wasn't my imagination. The creature was real, and it was slowly driving me insane.

One night, I decided to try and confront the creature. I got out of bed and slowly made my way to the window. I could see the creature's silhouette outside, its red eyes glowing in the darkness.

I took a deep breath and opened the window, shouting at the creature, demanding to know what it wanted. But the creature just stared back at me, its eyes boring into my soul.

I felt a cold shiver run down my spine, and I knew that I had made a mistake. I quickly closed the window and retreated back to my bed, the creature's presence still haunting me.

From that night on, I knew that I could never confront the creature again. I was too scared, too weak. The creature had won, and I was its prisoner.

I began to research the creature, trying to find a way to banish it from my life. But every time I tried to perform a ritual or use a charm, the creature would just get stronger.

I was trapped, with no way out. The creature continued to haunt me, passing by my house every night at exactly 3 am. I could feel its presence, its weight, suffocating me.

And then, one night, the creature finally got in. I woke up to it standing at the foot of my bed, its red eyes piercing into my soul. It reached out with its long, thin fingers, and I felt a cold chill run down my spine.

I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The creature's fingers wrapped around my throat, cutting off my air supply. I could feel my consciousness slipping away, and I knew that this was it.

The last thing I saw before passing out was the creature's red eyes, staring back at me. And when I woke up, I was in a cold, dark place, with no way out.

The creature had won, and I was its prisoner for eternity.
