I’m no alpha male. Humans don’t really have alpha males. We’re a communal species. Cooperation among small groups served us way better than domination by one asshole. What we have are loud mouth wannabes and pretenders. I’m the latter. 

If you believe in the “alpha male,” you’re a sucker of some sort. You’re chasing a fantasy. I know. I've made hundreds off your stupid asses. Frankly, I still do, but I’m not saying shit about that. Gotta protect the brand.

Andrew Tate? Those YouTubers? I can’t say for sure whether or not they believe their bullshit. But odds are they don’t, or they don’t give a shit. Insecure suckers will pay anyone to tell them that the alpha male isn’t a myth, and that it’s totally something they can become. All women just melt into horny puddles at the sight of them and their pure masculine manliness. But seriously guys, sure, there’s sex symbols, but “alpha males?” 

Tate’s followers are the funniest to me. The dude straight up admitted he just exploited the algorithms by being outrageous and inviting a “70-30” split between followers and haters so they could all fight about it and drive engagement. Then he goes online and says some painfully generic life advice like “work out” or “make money” but throws in a bunch of mindless bullshit about how bad women want him, and how inferior they are, and you dipshits ate it up. You guys even claim he’s a positive influence while he charges you money for hustler university. 

Newsflash, you sycophantic sheep. Those women he says are all over him? He paid them. It’s a trick. Hire a bunch of sex workers, rent a yacht, throw a party, film the women fawning over you, tell your followers they’re totally there because they want to be, and this is what every day is like for an alpha like you, because women all just spontaneously throw on bikinis and climb onto boats when you’re around. Those “women” on his online chat rooms and forums? They’re bots. Or more sex workers, who are just there for your insecure asses.  Maybe less than one percent are actual people, telling him they love him, and most of those women are either lying, or they’re some sort of masochists (Or devout evangelicals I suppose).

You idiots eat it up. The teenagers I can forgive. But I swear half of you are grown fucking men, and you buy into this shit. But hey. That’s how I get paid. That’s how a bunch of the cam girls I work with get paid. It’s a pretty sweet deal for us. I sell you bullshit generic life advice, hang out with pretty girls and pretend to be some sort of sex god, and you dipshits throw money at me. You fucking flock to me. I think it’s sad. Not enough to stop taking your money, by any means, but seriously. How deluded can you get? How badly do people need to believe their penis makes them some sort of demigod?

But I’m not gonna harp on you sheep too much. That’s not why I’m writing this, or why I’m here. I’m here with a warning. By all means, keep being an insecure little man, and buy yourself some advice from an “alpha male” but be careful. There’s something weird hanging out on the internet. I mean, other than you…

It started with one of the Cam girls I work with. She was dumped by a boyfriend and left with no money, but she was good looking and willing to use it to stay on her feet. She openly opposed the attitudes that drove her to this, some might call her a hypocrite for it, but I don’t think so. The world is a giant asshole. Anyway, she sent me one of her ads. She sent it in a personal email too. Not just one of her programmed bot ads. She invited me to a private chat room for some “one on one” time. I let myself believe I really was an alpha for maybe three seconds before it hit me how weird this was. 

We’ll just call this woman “Red.” She was something of a specialist. Curvy frame, long red hair, and tits for days, but her big thing was sexy cosplay strip teases. She got big for dressing in a “Slave Leia” golden bikini. She has a private chatroom she’ll strip on, for those who pay, but she doesn’t do personal one on one vids. Ever. 

She made that very clear to me when I asked. But now she’s sending me an invite? She low key hates me. Not enough to not take my money, but she definitely didn’t have any desire to butter me up. I don’t do that shit anyway. 

Tempting as it was, I’m glad I didn’t click the link. Instead I sent her an email asking ‘what the hell.’ She had no idea. About a week later, she shut down her stuff because she was convinced she’d been hacked. Police were involved. Something about followers of hers disappearing without a trace.

I know for a fact that she’s shut down her cam business. But nobody else seems to have gotten the memo. Another almost identical page with her image appeared seemingly as soon as she left. It keeps posting. It sent me more emails. All of them are clearly written by bots. The pics it uploads look like Red, but I can tell it’s not her. She never needed to photoshop much. Maybe touching up lighting or making her complexion a bit lighter, but Red is just a curvy woman. The pics this new page posted, you can easily see are doctored if you look closely. But I guess the idiots who drool over her don’t care.

I sent her another email: “Hey, your page came back. It’s still posting. That’s not you. What’s going on?”

She didn’t reply. The page began uploading videos. Once again, it’s clearly one of those AI deepfake things. There’s some woman, who definitely isn’t Red (way too skinny), doing what some might call a sexy dance while she takes off her clothes. Mostly her face is out of frame. But on the rare occasions where you see it or she looks at the camera? Someone or some bot pasted Red’s face over top. I don’t know if you’ve seen what deep fakes can do these days, it’s getting eerily seamless, but it’s still far from perfect. You don’t notice as much if they don’t talk, and this person never does. But you can still see it. The hair isn’t the right color. The face is clearly on the wrong body in some places. I don’t know who the skinny woman in the video is, but she can’t even seem to muster the energy to pretend to be enthusiastic the way Red could. I hope she’s not some sort of slave. Come to think of it, that video looked like it was in some random basement. Oh jeez…

In another one, she does talk, and it sounds like her, but that can be deepfaked now too. She said she’s coming out with something “super exciting” soon. 

Something is wrong. And nobody seems to want to do anything. In fact, followers in the chat have started violently insulting anyone who suggests that something is amiss. I’m pretty sure they’re all bots. I’ve got a few bots to pose as ladies to send me complements. Makes me seem more legit to the typical suckers who buy my shit. So I know a bot crowd when I see one.

So someone hijacked Red’s page. They’ve created images and video using Ai to hijack her image. They’ve used bots to maintain the image of popularity and type messages for her to generate buzz, so they’ve hijacked her voice. Someone is taking Red’s money without even using Red. I’m swindeling suckers, so I can appreciate a con. I might have ignored all of this under different circumstances. But here’s the thing. Red wasn’t just ignoring me. She had gone missing.

I’ve had police come and ask me questions just because I paid Red to take some pictures with me near a fancy car I rented. They haven’t told me much. It almost seems like they don’t care. But at some point it became a federal case. Red isn’t the only one. Some other online models have vanished from the public, but their online businesses mysteriously kept going, or they were replaced with a cheap copy. The Feds got the hosting sites to remove all the missing girl’s stuff, but as soon as the that happened, the pages just moved. They moved to a shady hosting site that apparently is based “somewhere on the eastern continents.” 

It’s getting more and more popular here in the states. Why wouldn’t it? That’s where Red is and Red is hot as fuck. You tell anyone who throws money to them they’re supporting theft and exploitation, they’ll tell you they don’t give a shit. There’s a reason I don’t mind swindling these sorts of idiots.

Maybe it’s not as nefarious as it seems. Maybe they just gave Red a better offer and she decided to just let AI do her sexy stuff for her? Maybe she’s just avoiding the public? Even regular people want to disappear sometimes, and most of them don’t have a horde of sex crazed lunatics and at least fifteen creepy stalkers following their every move. Maybe everything is as fine as it can be in this business?

I wish I could keep telling myself that. Red is dead. Her body was found a few days ago. Shot in the head. And her page? It’s still posting new content. It’s even chatting with fans. And people eat it up. Nobody cares that Red was an actual person who’s been murdered. So long as they can jerk off to the hot chick who looked great in a gold bikini, so long as they can pay for the illusion that they can speak to her like a friend or lover, they’re willing to let the AI do it for them, and then everyone will just forget she exists until they get horny again. Y’all are necrophiles as far as I’m concerned. 

You idiots can’t keep it up forever though. Let’s not forget what I mentioned earlier. Some of Red’s followers disappeared too. We’re dealing with a person, or group, (or hell, maybe it’s something else entirely) that’s willing to murder a woman and hijack her image to swindle you for money, but I guess money isn’t all it wants. The disappearances aren’t random either. All of them were deeply involved, like… purchasing platinum packages so they can have one-on-one time with these women. The Feds think this shadow person (or persons, who knows) sends a special invitation from their girl of choice. They just can’t resist apparently. Who knows what happens from there, but the end result is they’re fucking gone now. The ones doing this don’t care any more about you than they do the women.

I’m a garbage human being. I admit that. I don’t care. I’m making money. There’s money to be made off of the lonely and the insecure. But at least I always remembered Red was a person. She worked a job, and she did it damn well. She knew how to use the body she was blessed with to entertain the masses who were willing to pay her. But the fact that half the people who followed her don’t give a shit that she’s been murdered and hijacked? So long as you can keep abusing your boner, she doesn’t matter to you. For once… that seems really sick to me.

Even if the Feds catch whoever’s behind this, it won’t be the last. That’s the scary part. AI can produce comments, chat with folks in real time, mimic people’s voices, generate images, fake video, and lord knows what else. All it takes is one enterprising asshole with no moral compass. 

What I don’t get is why they even bothered murdering Red. Hell. Why bother with real people at all? Just create some AI goddess for people to jerk off to? I don’t really get it. There’s an ocean of written smut on the internet people could read that harms nobody. There’s animation programs people can use to bring whatever twisted tentacled fantasy they want to life. But for some reason, some people will still only accept a real person. One they can at least pretend to talk to.

I can’t really talk. Making money off of weakness is my whole business. I use a fake image, I offer fake ways to become that fake image. I got people like Red to lend me their fake image to lend credence to mine. But let’s face it. Pretending is fun. I like pretending I’m a macho man. And I get paid. I wouldn’t stop if I didn’t have to. If people are too dumb to think past the images, I may as well profit.

But I guess someone else thinks they’re more entitled to that money than I am. My image appeared on that streaming service. Apparently I’m selling “man lessons” and the chance to “hang with the babes.” 

I’m gonna be hanging out with the FBI for the next while. Here’s hoping I don’t turn up with a bullet in the head too. I’m scared for my life. I don’t know who, or what, is doing this, and I’m scared for my life. They’re hunting you, and they're using me.

I’m really sorry all that happened to you Jennifer. We weren’t friends but… for whatever it’s worth, I wish the world was a better place, so maybe this wouldn’t have happened to you. This warning won’t change anything. But at least it’s out there. Some people know what happened. Some people are trying to stop it. I hope that’s enough. It will never end…
