Sorry this is technically part 4. I’ve been out of it. Not sure how to edit title yet, new to this obviously.

The shed had always been off-limits, a place my father protected with quiet, unrelenting authority. It wasn’t just locked—it was sealed in my memory as untouchable. 

“Stay out,” he’d say, in a tone so sharp and final that it etched itself into my childhood. I never thought to disobey. But now, Sarah was missing, and I was unraveling. I’d already torn through the whole house, room by room, but there was nothing—no trace of her, no sign of a struggle, just silence. The backyard offered even less. The ground was undisturbed, flat and lifeless, with no hint of the graves the twins had once mocked me with, the ones they claimed to have dug up to build their grotesque new forms. 

My brother. My friend. My gym teacher. Their remains had been used, desecrated, but there was no evidence, no place where the earth had been broken. That’s when I thought about the shed. The memory was sudden and heavy, my father’s voice barking in the back of my mind, but this time it didn’t stop me. I turned toward the warped door, breath catching in my chest, and before I could second-guess myself, I was moving.

Inside, the air hung heavy and sour, a mix of damp wood and gasoline that clawed at my throat. The workbench sat in its usual spot, battered and scarred, like it had been waiting for me all these years. And then I saw the drill. Bolted to the side, its rusted handle and crude design felt out of place, even sinister. My hand moved instinctively, gripping the cool metal and cranking it forward, the groan of ancient gears echoing in the small space. 

The bench shuddered and began to shift, dragging itself across the floor in slow, deliberate movements until it revealed a metal-framed trapdoor beneath, jagged with rust and slick with moisture. My stomach turned as the scent hit me—sweet and cloying, like syrup rotting in the sun. Whatever lay beneath wasn’t meant to be found, but my hands were already grasping the handle, pulling the door into the darkness waiting below.

The stairs were wrong. Not built, but carved—hacked out of the earth in a way that spoke of desperation, of someone trying to bury something that refused to stay hidden. The walls pressed tight as I descended, the soil crumbling under my touch, the air damp and rank with decay. My father’s handiwork, no doubt. It felt like him—sloppy but determined. And then I saw her. Sarah.

She was there, slouched against the far wall like some discarded doll, but that wasn’t what stopped me cold. What froze my breath was what surrounded her. The twins—those mutilated creations—lay sprawled on the dirt floor, their heads bowed low, mouths latched onto Sarah’s left arm. Only the hands gripped her, twisted like claws around the skin. Their mouths were still, silent, but the damage was grotesque—a chunk missing cleanly from the lower arm, the jagged edges darkened, the rest of the wound a festering mess. 

My stomach twisted. A part of me, sick as it felt, was relieved she was intact. I didn’t know how much of her I’d find—or if there’d be anything at all. But she hadn’t moved. There were no chains, no ropes holding her down. She could’ve run, could’ve fought, but she didn’t. Sarah was just… there. A hollow husk. Her eyes were milked over, pale with streaks of dark blue, fixed on the far wall as if nothing existed beyond it. Her mouth hung flat, her body shrunken in submission as the twins’ heads lay perfectly positioned on either side of her, mouths parted as if ready to drink her dry. Everything about them felt frozen, lifeless—but Sarah wasn’t dead. Not yet. And somehow, that was worse. I thought back to my father, when he passed. 

It was raining that night, the kind of rain that swallowed the world whole—windshield wipers barely keeping up, drops streaking silver against the glass. My dad insisted on driving me to Sarah’s birthday, like always. Ever since my brother died, he’d been... relentless. Every movement I made, every place I went, he hovered—watching, worrying, controlling. But that night, I told him I wanted to drive. I’d just gotten my N, and I said it was the least I could do. He hesitated but handed over the keys, his jaw tight. Thirty minutes to the barn, through steep drop-offs and hairpin turns. I don’t know who I thought I was, but as we hit the highway and the car started to hydroplane, it felt like someone else had taken the wheel. The tires screamed against the slick pavement, the car spinning wildly into oncoming traffic, but I dodged them all—like my hands weren’t mine, like someone was steering for me. Three cars, missed by inches. Then we spun, a full 360, stopping just shy of the concrete barrier that would’ve sent us over the edge. My dad laughed, nervous but relieved, and I felt invincible. But we were facing the wrong way. 

Without thinking, I made a U-turn at the blind corner—and that’s when it happened. The other car came out of nowhere. The sound was indescribable—metal folding like paper, glass shattering, the rain swallowing everything else. When I turned to check on him, he wasn’t moving. No screaming, no struggle—just gone. The seatbelt held him, slumped forward, his face turned just enough that I knew. I knew before I’d even touched him. Those eyes, fogged over and blue. 

Finding Sarah wasn’t the relief I thought it’d be. She looked half gone—that rot on her arm—but she wasn’t starving yet. That stuck with me. It reminded me of Mom, back when I’d help with her IV setups during dialysis, flushing lines and keeping things running when the infections hit. 

It was muscle memory, so I gave Sarah antibiotics. It felt like the best shot I had. But her spirit—whatever made her Sarah—it’s not here. The twins know why, I’m sure of it. I thought about taking her to the hospital, but if I do, I lose them. And if I lose them, I lose her. All I can do now is keep her alive while I figure this out, and ask them what they’ve done. What they’ve taken.  

But lately, I’ve been doing research—too much maybe—trying to figure out what’s happening to Sarah and what I can do next. I think I’ve stumbled into something like astral projection, maybe even ethereal projection, though I’m not entirely sure what that means yet. It’s got me questioning if I need the twins at all. What if I can ask the world directly for answers? I’ve read about people doing that—just throwing questions out into the universe, and somehow, it gives them what they need. It sounds impossible, but if there’s even a chance it could work... I’ll try it.

If anyone knows much about astral travel or ethereal projection, then please let me know. I’m hoping this will work. Until then, I’ll keep you updated.
