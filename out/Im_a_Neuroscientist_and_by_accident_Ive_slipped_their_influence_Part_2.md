Priscilla slowly opens her eyes. I’m sitting beside her, holding her hand. She blinks rapidly; her pupils struggling to adjust to the flood of light. And how could they not? The operation had lasted 26 grueling hours. She had been under the veil of darkness that entire time. Now, her eyes glow faintly, as if absorbing light only to reflect something more ancient.

After a long pause, I ask, “How do you feel?”

She simply smiles, wordless.

Her silence unnerves me.

We advise a full week of rest. She agrees. During this time, she experiences minor headaches, alongside something harder to articulate; a feeling of being freed from something. Much like what I felt.

With the N-37 cluster gone, her brain feels as it should have for millennia; unshackled, alive. She describes a sensation I know too well: the real taste of consciousness, the raw authority of self.

I’ve noticed changes in myself as well. There's a precision to my thoughts now, a clarity. I no longer feel like a being chained to fate. Instead, I am the architect of my choices, no longer bound by some invisible influence masquerading as destiny.

Priscilla remains focused, her eyes burning with the sharpness of scientific hunger and the calm honesty she wears like armor. Yet now, there’s something else; an aura I can’t define. Possibility. Defiance. Evolution.

Meanwhile, I continue discussions with Matthew, pushing for the next subject. Before Priscilla’s operation, I had already requested another volunteer. We need comparative data. No two brains are alike, and I fear **different neural architectures might lead to consequences we haven’t even imagined.**

There’s a sense of hopeful urgency. I want Priscilla to witness dogs and cats again, to test if the world remains unchanged for her. But something inside me feels it hasn't. A quiet dread whispers that something has shifted; unseen, yet undeniable.

The call comes the next evening.

*“Robert, I don’t feel good. I’m seeing…”*

“What? What is it, Priscilla? Are you okay?” My voice quivers. “This is what I feared. We shouldn’t have rushed this. I shouldn’t have involved you at all; especially not in something that alters neural function.”

*“No. no, I feel good, physically. But… sometimes I see… darkness unfold. It collapses in on itself. Like it’s tearing through the air around me—transparent one moment, ruptured the next. Then it vanishes, like it was never there.”*

*She pauses.*

*“I also hear faint, hushed voices… from inside those tears.”*

I grip the edge of my desk. “What kind of darkness are you talking about?”

*“It comes randomly. But at certain times… it lingers. I can feel it watching.”*

“Priscilla,” I say quietly, “this isn’t okay. We should terminate the experiment. At least until you're fully stable.”

But she snaps back; calm, yet unshakable. *“No. You know I don’t back down. Not from discovery. Certainly not from truth. I’m doing this; for us. For science.”*

“But Priscilla...”

*“We’re doing this, Robert,”* she interrupts.

The call ends. I don’t sleep that week. I don’t eat. I just wait; scouring the data, praying the darkness doesn’t consume her.

When she arrives at the lab, she is herself again; steady, composed, driven. In the observation room, she sits quietly. A dog and a cat are brought in. I remain in the adjacent chamber, separated by soundproof glass. Four cameras and a full audio setup capture every detail.

The animals are released.

Seconds pass. Then, Priscilla screams.

“Priscilla, what is it?!” I shout into the mic.

Her voice crackles through the speakers, shaken and strangled.

*“They… they aren’t what we think they are. Send them away! Get them out of here!”*

Later, after calming her, we ask her to describe what she saw.

*“They aren’t dogs. Not really. They have three eyes, a stretched, mask-like face, and monstrous hands—too large for their limbs. Their eyes glow deep violet and spin independently. Their teeth… all red, jagged, and turned outward, like barbs. And they speak. In hushed tones. Not barking—whispering. When they bark here, they’re actually grinning there. When they eat here, they grow there. Their real bodies… they’re curled up, hidden—inside some dimension I can’t fully see, but I feel it.”*

She jolts, fear visible in not just her eyes but the shivers she experiences.

A silence settles over the team. Her words echo long after she’s stopped speaking.

Still, amidst the unease, hope blooms. The removal of the N-37 cluster; the section of the brain excised during the operation; has seemingly unlocked a hidden layer of reality. Perhaps its presence was a tether to illusion, and its removal severs that anchor.

We present our findings to select colleagues that we had in the **Human Brain Project**. Some recoil in disbelief. Others lean in, hungry. One senior neurologist, pale but resolute, finally says:

*“These creatures may be terrifying, but the N-37 cluster’s removal has unlocked something. A portal. The potential to observe another plane of existence. For science; and perhaps evolution itself.”*

Others point to the remarkable clarity experienced post-removal; the sense of true consciousness, autonomy, and inner authority. The implications are staggering. Volunteers pour in; many from the scientific community itself. Who wouldn’t want to feel consciousness in its purest state?

But greed, as always, is quick to arrive.

Some push for mass removal. Others, funded by elite billionaires, argue for exclusivity; limiting the procedure to the wealthy. They echo their masters’ wishes: control the mind, control the world.

And amidst all this chaos, the newly discovered dimension earns a name:

**Link 37.**

Yet, despite the noise; the articles, the debates, the feverish speculations—Priscilla and I remain silent. We are not convinced. Something crucial is missing. Something buried in that dark fold of reality that demands to be pried open, dissected.

Later, whispers of rogue surgeons and black docs begin to spread, we ignore them for now.

During a tense briefing, a senior scientist leans forward. His voice is sharp, but curious.

*“And what exactly is it that you think we’ve missed?”*

Priscilla and I turn to him.

In perfect unison, we answer:

**“Their brains.”**
