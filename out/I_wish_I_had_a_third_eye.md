It's been a week since a student was said to be possessed by an evil entity.  My classmates were still freaking out everytime they hear a random noise. I don't know if some of them are just pretending to see and hear ghosts just to follow the trend. Can't blame them if they are, we are still in 4th grade and not all kids mature early.

One day I decided to pretend to hear ghosts too cause I don't wanna feel different from them. I ran to my classmates pretending to be scared.

"I... I heard a crying child behind those bushes," I pointed at the garden near our school and my classmates look scared too. Some comforted me.

It's recess time. As usual they are still chatting about paranormal stuffs while I play with my phone. This weird sassy classmates of ours named Camilla came to me.

"Why did you pretend to feel ghosts?" I looked at her with surprised face. I don't know what to answer about that.

"Why do you wanna act like them? So weird. You can't feel ghosts, right?" My body was shaking. I think this is what I fear more than ghosts- an observant person. I'm sensitive about my privacy, I hate when someone look at my drawings and read my diary, so much more if someone can read my mind!

"I umm... don't wanna feel like an outcast," I said honestly. I just answered without argument. I know Camilla, she loves to pretend she know things. But when you try to correct her she's gonna reply with a creative insult. She's also rich af and it's already a habit of kids my age to make friends with the rich so we can borrow their fancy stuffs.

"Well stop it, it's pathetic," she said and she rolled her eyes and walked away. 

The bell rang and we all went back in the classroom. Jennifer, who we consider as the second richest in our class, talked badly about Camilla. "That girl's only personality is being rich. She reminds me of those mean girls in Disney series. She smells so bad too," our teacher approached her. She was furious at Jennifer.

"That's not a good thing to say! I'm gonna tell your parents about this!" everybody went silent.

I talked for some reason, "By the way where's Camilla? I just spoke to her. Is she gonna be absent this afternoon?" when I said that everybody looked at me strangely.

The one beside me touched my shoulder. "Camilla died three weeks ago. Her parents paid the school to not talk about her anymore."

As I went to bed my mind is still messed up. I can't sleep. I want to forget. My mom came to check on me. "You want some milk, honey? Or water?" I said no thanks and she came near me.

"Honey do they still talk about ghosts? Possessions?" she might have the idea that this is what's scaring me, but it's not, I'm not a scaredy cat like the rest.

"Yes Mom and it's funny that they are scared haha" she look worried and upset. She kissed me on the forehead and went back downstairs.

As I try to sleep I heard my mom and dad arguing.

"Fred I thought Camilla's dad also paid the school to not talk about our daughter's possession?! Why are they still talking about it?!"
