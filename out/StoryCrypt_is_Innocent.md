Hey, guys. Storytime. So… It’s a lot. It’s, like, a lot a lot. So, just. Buckle up, I guess?

So the algorithm, right? That skibidi gaslighting void. It needs constant feeding. And my mom… my mom’s medical stuff, it’s… it’s expensive. And at the time my channel did that little fish flop on the dock thing. 

Anyway.

I am not even good at writing. This post started as a GPT prompt, *Write a short scary story about the* *Cedar Glen disappearances for narration*.  

The answer? *Give me two days. And I will craft a banger. Would you like a notification when I’m done?*

Two days? Bet. Let it cook. But when I read it my blood went cold. Like super based. It was so specific. It talked about the mud, gave times, referenced articles… it wasn’t a story. It was a manual. And I was like, The algorithm is going to vomit views all over this.

And it did. It literally did. The video slayed. We’re talking sponsorships, collabs, subathons and monetization. I paid off my mom’s medical debt. She called me a hero. I was a genius. I won the internet.

But I got greedy. Of course. That’s the whole point of the game, right? Get greedy or get left behind. So I decided to do a follow-up. A live unboxing. I went deep. Like, deep deep. Down the kind of rabbit hole requiring an onion browser and a VPN. Extra delulu for clicks. Which, no cap, was cringe. So that happened.

The box arrived, plain and brown strangled by tape with no return address. I set up the stream, thousands of people waited.

“I ordered a box from the dark web so you don’t have to… What’s in the box, gang? What’s in the box?” I snapped the wrist of my latex glove.

The chat bursted in a blur of emojis. 

Slicing it opened, I threw up in my mouth a little from the musty smell. 

A box of sus. Pinching out a crusty bracelet, I put it in the discard pile. The class ring hugged my ring finger, so I kept it. But I knew. The second I saw the old photo of the local haunted campground, I knew. This junk matched the details of my story. Some troll figured out a way to make me cringe. The chat didn’t know. They thought it was a bit. 

They spammed *Ls,* *Ws* and skull emojis. 

Staring into this box of someone else’s life, it felt like watching a snuff film.

I tossed it all out. Obviously. Went and touched grass.

The police pulled me out of class a few days later. Took my phone, put me in handcuffs. Questioned me for hours, about people who disappeared last year from the campground. Talking about I knew unreleased details from the cases. Claimed the ring and bracelet from the unboxing belonged to missing persons. Flipped my room upside down looking for more evidence. Kicked my mom out of our house while they searched. I know my rights. Told them about the AI and darkweb.

“Not enough evidence. Circumstantial,” they said. 

But the detectives… they think I did it. 

Somebody tagged me in a post about what happened to me. At first I thought my followers rallied for me. But the title read*, The StoryCrypt Killer: An Analysis.* 

My channel got demonetized. I think the cops doxed me. I can’t leave my house. Not because of the police. Because of the clout chasers. They stand on the sidewalk,  streaming lives, pointing at my windows. 

“Hey, guys, Storytime. DramaDude93 here, coming at you LIVE from the doorstep of a YouTube serial killer…” 

Their cameras sucking the light out of everything. Monetizing my death spiral. Reducing my existence to an engagement metric.

My mom… clueless. She coughs over the bills crowding the coffee table. Tells me how proud she is of me. How I’m her hero. Every I love you sounds like a goodbye.

And in my house. No longer home. It’s a set. And the vultures circle. And the only thing left to unbox… is me.
