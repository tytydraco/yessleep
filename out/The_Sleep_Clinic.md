I've been plagued by insomnia for as long as I can remember. Endless nights of tossing and turning, accompanied by a cacophony of restless thoughts, had become my unfortunate norm. After years of futile attempts with home remedies and over-the-counter sleep aids, I was desperate for a solution. My doctor referred me to an illustrious sleep clinic, reputed for its groundbreaking research and innovative treatments.

Upon arrival, the clinic's sleek, minimalist design exuded an air of tranquility that seemed to promise a sanctuary for my troubled mind. Unbeknownst to me, I was about to unearth a ghastly secret that would haunt me for the rest of my days.

On my first night, I was connected to an intricate web of machines that monitored my every breath, heartbeat, and neural impulse. The doctor assured me that the data collected would aid in tailoring a personalized treatment plan. Fatigued, I drifted into a restless slumber, oblivious to the sinister events that would unfold.

Sometime during the witching hour, I awoke with a jolt, my heart thundering in my chest. My eyes darted around the dimly lit chamber, seeking the source of my disquiet. That's when I noticed my door, slightly ajar, allowing a sliver of eerie light to creep into the room.

Torn between curiosity and trepidation, I cautiously slid out of bed and inched toward the door. As it creaked open, the foreboding hallway stretched before me, its shadowy recesses hiding unspeakable horrors. An ominous sensation gnawed at my gut, warning me that something was terribly amiss.

With bated breath, I tiptoed through the darkness, only to find that the door to another patient's room was also open. The room was eerily vacant, its inhabitant vanished without a trace. The machines intended for sleep monitoring were violently shattered, as if by some malevolent force. I felt a chill run down my spine, and my pulse quickened as I staggered back into the hallway.

A sense of overwhelming dread engulfed me as I discovered that every patient room shared the same fate – abandoned, with their monitoring equipment obliterated. Panic-stricken, I sprinted through the corridors, frantically seeking any semblance of life.

My frantic search led me to a door marked "Restricted Access." Despite my terror, an irresistible compulsion drew me to uncover the truth. As I pushed the door open and stepped into the dimly lit chamber, my eyes beheld a macabre sight.

The room was filled with rows of colossal glass tanks, each containing a human body, suspended in a viscous, murky fluid. The patients' eyes were wide open, terror etched into every line of their faces, their mouths contorted in silent screams. Monitors beside each tank displayed their vitals, indicating they were somehow still alive.

Horrified, I stumbled back, knocking over a tray of gleaming instruments, which clattered to the floor like the rattle of bones. Suddenly, a voice behind me hissed, "You shouldn't be in here."

I spun around to see the doctor, his face twisted in a mixture of rage and fear. He revealed that the clinic had been conducting unspeakable experiments on the patients, attempting to harness the power of nightmares to create a serum that would induce eternal sleep. However, the serum had monstrous side effects – it trapped the patients in a perpetual state of nightmarish torment...
