I don’t exclusively notice him at night. At times, he also crouches in dark corners or lurks within a room with drawn curtains. Provided that the room is spacious enough for him, of course. He seems to avoid rooms that he doesn’t fully fit in. That’s the only predictable aspect of this entity’s appearances that I have been able to observe over the years. I’ve never seen him in smaller rooms. I’ve never noticed him inside my home, thank God.

The day I decided to tell my mom about him, I named him the long man. It has been how I refer to him since then. There are no distinctive features apart from how unnaturally stretched out he looks. Not only his limbs, but his head and torso as well. Just… long. In elementary school, I sometimes estimated him to be about five meters tall. Now he usually measures three to four meters. It’s possible that he shrunk over the years, but I think the difference in height might also be attributed to my perception. As a small child, everything seemed just so much larger. Still – three meters of this dark, creeping creature are more than enough to scare me, even as an adult.

I would like to start my story with the night I first saw him.

I first noticed him sitting in the backseat of my parents’ car at night. I must have been really young, not even in school. I made a game out of finding shapes in the trees. We were driving mostly through fields, with smaller groups of trees at the distance. It was fun for me to imagine that the shadows of the trees in the distance were actually the outlines of dinosaurs, ready to roam the earth.

Then I first saw him.

I mean, I will never know if I actually saw him or if it was just my mind playing tricks on me.

Next to a group of trees there was the silhouette of a man. I could make out the head, torso, arms and legs. It was all black. Apart from my dad’s car’s light, all that there was to distinguish objects in the dark was the moon. It could have been just a weirdly shaped tree. A tree that looked like a distorted, big man. Its branches formed the limbs of the figure. They were long. I think that the trees were about fifty to a hundred meters off the road. At this distance, I couldn’t be sure of what I was seeing.

But it scared me. My imagination went wild. Just as I had imagined a T-Rex breaking loose from the shadows seconds earlier, I now imagined the long man to do so. He then lifted one arm and held it up at an angle as if he was to greet me. As if he was about to wave at me.

I can’t possibly tell you if this really happened. I don’t know if he already existed back then, or if this was the night he came into existence within my head. I remember having goosebumps all over. I turned away and pretended to sleep for the rest of the ride. I didn’t want to look out of the window again. Seeing this thing had an impact on me. I became scared of the dark, even more than I had been before. I refused to go outside at night. Sometimes, I felt like I could see him from my bedroom window. Only if the shadows between the trees in our backyard were big enough for him to hide in, of course.

My change in behavior hadn’t gone unnoticed by my parents. I hadn’t told them what I was afraid of, as I myself wasn’t sure of what I was seeing and if it was really there. My mom waited for a few days, before she confronted me about this intense fear of the dark I had recently developed.

She assured me that I could tell her what was scaring me so much at night – she wouldn’t make fun of me. And she actually kept her promise. I explained how I sometimes felt watched and if I then looked outside, I saw something in the dark. As I was just five years old, I couldn’t articulate myself that well. My mom’s first thought was that there was an actual human observing me. After I had clarified that it was no human – at least not a normal one – but more like a monster, her tone eased. She assured me that monsters were not real, and that this ‘long man’ would also disappear, if I just stopped worrying about him so much. “He only exists in your head”, she told me.

I remember thinking about her words for a long time. He would disappear if I stopped worrying. That made sense to me. Because I had invented him, hadn’t I?

But what would happen if I couldn’t stop fearing him?

Have you ever had someone tell you: “Don’t think of a pink elephant right now”? You can’t help but visualizing one, right? That was the problem I encountered. I told myself to stop thinking about the long man. Stop wondering about what he might look like outside the shadows. Stop making up reasons as to why he was observing me…

I think that during those nights in my early childhood, as I invested hours thinking about him, he became reality. He fed off my fear. And he still does. Which is why he has been accompanying me for all these years.

During my childhood, the long man didn’t do anything but stare at me. I have never seen his eyes, but I just know that he is staring at me. I’ve also seen him raise his hand. He does it very slowly. An outsider probably wouldn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, having a quick glance at the shadow. But I know why he does it. He needs me to know that he’s there. He’s there for me. Because he needs my fear.

 You probably wonder why my fear of him never ceased, even though I’ve seen him again and again over many years. There are two factors. The first one is hard to describe, but I’ll try.

Whenever I see him, no matter if expected or completely surprising, a wave of fear washes over me. For a few seconds, I feel like it’s drowning me. It’s an emotion I cannot control, no matter how hard I try. In my younger years, I tried to convince myself again and again that he wouldn’t do anything to me. I couldn’t know this for sure, but then again, I had no experience of him harming anyone. It was no use. His presence was, and still is, sinister. The word that describes it best is just *wrong*. His warped silhouette doesn’t belong to this world. He’s like a bad imitation of a human. The way he moves – even if slowly – is crooked. I instinctively know when he’s there. My body gets hot. At the same time, something heavy in my chest drops and I start to shiver. I always know it. This heavy physical reaction always subconsciously told me that he must be evil. It would take a few years until this theory was definitely proven, but after I saw what he did to Rita, I was sure.

This is the second factor that causes me to fear him – that I now know what he is capable of.

Rita and I became friends in second grade. For obvious reasons, I have always been sleep-deprived and I have had trouble keeping up with schoolwork. My teacher decided that it would be best if I repeated second grade. I’ve never had many friends, but this made it even worse. I knew nobody in my new class. While the other kids were secretly calling me stupid behind my back, as my tiredness caused me to sometimes appear a little slow, Rita was always friendly with me. After I’d known her for a few weeks – she had helped me with schoolwork, and we had met each other’s families – I came to face a dilemma. I wanted to tell her of the long man. I wanted her to understand that there was a reason for my fears. Then again, back then, I had no clue if others could even perceive his presence. I didn’t want her to think that I was crazy. It took some time, but I came to the decision that it would be best to tell her. I remember this night very clearly. One night in late autumn, we were having a sleepover.

She basically started the conversation herself, as she asked me if there was something specific that I didn’t like about the darkness. I told her that there were sometimes shapes and silhouettes that looked like they didn’t belong. After she claimed to have seen such things herself – every kid has, I would guess – I told her everything. I think she just wanted to be supportive. I told her that he would probably wait outside that night as well. She was eager to see him. And to my absolute surprise, she did. 

At about ten pm that night, I started to feel his presence. That hot feeling of doom and fear came over me, even though we were inside. I peeked through the curtain and noticed him. On the other side of the street there was a small passage between two houses. He had squeezed in there. I could barely make out his outlines. At the same time, I was completely sure that he was there. Rita told me she could vaguely see him too. She then did something that I had never done – she waved back at him. He had always been passive. Never reacted to what I did. But now, he looked at Rita. His long head moved slowly. He didn’t raise his hand towards her.

I expected to see fear and surprise in her eyes, but she looked as fierce as ever. She told me that she knew I wasn’t stupid or crazy and that I wouldn’t make something like this up. At that moment, I felt extremely grateful. I wasn’t alone with this thing anymore. The feeling of relief lasted for a few days. After all, I now had proof that I wasn’t crazy, which had been something I didn’t know I needed – but it felt assuring.

The rest of this is hard to write down, even so many years after it happened. I will try to explain what happened as best as I can, while keeping it short for my own sake. I want to relive as little of it as possible.

After Rita’s first encounter with him, we often discussed what he was and what we could do about him. In retrospect, I’m sure that all our talking about him made him stronger. It was stupid. He appeared a few more times, and his shape seemed sharper and more defined than it did before. Unknowingly, we gave him fuel to grow.

The day it happened, we were in a cinema. I usually avoided its big dark halls, but as it was a school trip, I had no choice but to go. The movie had started, and I fully focused on keeping my eyes on the screen. Not turning around. Not glancing at the corner next to the screen. The corner only vaguely lit by a red exit sign. 

It was too late. He was there. He lingered, the form flickering a bit. His neck and limbs stretched even more for short moments, only to then shrink a little. He adjusted himself to the light that was bouncing off the screen, some movie screens brighter, some darker. He always stayed in the darkest areas of the shadow. Next to me, Rita felt my body tense up. “Is he here?”, she asked. I nodded towards him. Before I knew what was happening, she slid out of her seat. I froze. I think she felt reassured by the presence of so many other people, but I’ll never know what exactly it was that motivated her to approach him. I saw her move towards the exit. Towards him. Nobody else cared to look.

And that was it.

She merged into the shadow. It was hard to distinguish her in the dark. For the blink of an eye, I saw her… I don’t know… she changed… I think she changed from her solid form into black vapor. It was just a second. And it happened so long ago. I don’t know what I saw. Honestly.

Paralyzed, I sat there for a few minutes. I couldn’t see her anymore. But I could make out an arm. A dark, thin, long arm that was raised slowly. He waved at me once more. I felt like I couldn’t move. Cold.

Rita wasn’t there anymore.

There isn’t much more to tell. The movie ended and soon our teacher noticed that she was missing. It took some time, but the adults became more and more nervous. The police searched for her. A few days after she was reported missing, most people started giving up hope. I was the only one who knew. And I then decided that I would never tell anyone close to me about the long man ever again.

I’m sorry, but you’re not close to me. And I just need to get it out, otherwise I might go crazy.

More than ten years have passed since the incident, but he is and was always there. Sometimes he’s a bit closer, sometimes he shrinks. On a few very bad days, I feel like he is growing.

I can’t stop fearing him. I can’t stop feeding him with my fear.
