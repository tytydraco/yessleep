So I was grade 7 when this happened, my friends told us that their teacher saw/feel a ghost around the abandoned room which is the girl scout room. Stories quickly spread around our classroom about that one girl falling off the bridge in our school near the room I was talking about earlier. So me and my best friend was intrigued about this and didn't really belive in ghost so we decided to like play around in that abandoned room with an emf reader at 6 pm, the hallway was very dark, there was barely any light and the room was isolated. While we were playing around with this emf reader we place it infront of the abandoned room and it goes "Beep beep beep" it went beep on the orange light Idk what it's called, then later on we heard someone rushing down the metal stairs with heavy footsteps but here's the catch that stairs had a gate in it so no one can possibly go in there. We freaked out and run out of there as quick as possible. 

We laughed it off when we got out of there. 
Now thw next day later, we both went to the underground of our school because that's where our next class is located it's near the abandoned place. So we went in our class all peaceful, but then the air was something else, I keep looking out of the window on my right side looking at the abandoned place, I saw some bottle roll over there and I freak out a little so I switched my seat near my best friend I went "ghost hunting" with yesterday. There was another big window behind us and there's this medium size canva behind us too, while the classroom was all quiet my friend whispered to me she looks pale saying "I hear someone breathing heavily behind us.. But don't look.. Please.. I'm scared" I didn't hear any breathing so I thought she was just playing with me so I lean more closer to the window behind us and I did..  I heard someone breathing heavily.. I look behind and saw nothing but the medium size canva blocking half of the window so I stand from my seat and took a little peak over the window.. Now this is where the nightmare begins. I SAW A FREAKING PALE GIRL WITH ITS EYES SO DEEP YOU COULDN'T SEE IT ANYMORE😭she had a long hair, pale skin, with thi slight musky smell and she was covered in soil. It quickly dissappeared when it saw me and I screamed.. Our teacher thought it was a snake so he made us all go into the middle, but when we were in the middle me and my best friend saw a black silhouette going through the lock gate.. I was so scared that time when I heard from my teacher that the two rooms besides us is lock and no student or teacher could get inside there, and the hallway to our classroom has a gate and it's lock so no one could possibly get inside there and prank us.. 

I couldn't forget about that moment.
