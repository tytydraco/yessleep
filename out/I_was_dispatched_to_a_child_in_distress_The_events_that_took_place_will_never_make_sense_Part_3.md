I was losing blood fast.
Every step left a new trail behind me, dark and glistening against the floor. The pain in my leg pulsed with every heartbeat.

I braced myself against the wall and kept moving, one hand clutching the wound, the other gripping my gun.

The house felt tighter now. Smaller. Like the walls were pressing in.

Somewhere behind me, I could still hear him. Bare feet slapping softly against the wood floor, moving slow. Following.

“Hey Kid!” I said, voice shaking, “I’m not gonna hurt you. Just stop.”

A faint laugh floated through the air. It sounded closer than before.

I turned toward the sound, flashlight trembling in my grip. The beam caught movement for just a second. Something low, fast, crawling across the hall before vanishing into the dark.

My radio crackled on my shoulder, a burst of static that made me flinch. I grabbed for it.

Dead air, more static.

I was breathing hard now. The room felt colder. My vision was starting to blur.

I needed to get out. Now.

I turned toward the front door, limping, dragging my leg behind me. Each step left another wet print on the floor.

The house had gone completely silent.

Then behind me, a whisper. Not a young child’s voice. No, this was different, raspy, deep.
“He belongs to me.”


I spun around, gun raised. Nothing.

My flashlight caught the stairwell for half a second, and I swear I saw something there.

Not moving.
Just waiting.

I stumbled backward, slamming into the wall. My breath came in short, broken gasps.

Then…light.

Faint at first. Through the front window.
Blue. Then red. Then both, washing through the house.

For a second, I thought I was imagining it.

But then I heard it. Tires on gravel, doors slamming, voices shouting outside.

“Police! Anyone inside?”

I dropped the gun and pounded on the door.
“Here! I’m here! Officer down!”

The wood splintered as the door burst open. Flashlights and shouts filled the space.

Hands grabbed me, dragging me down. I hit the floor hard, my vision tunneling in and out.

“Stay with us! Get pressure on that leg!”

I tried to look past them, down the hall, toward the basement door.
It was closed again.



I woke up in a hospital bed hours later. My leg was stitched, bandaged, still burning.

The detectives told me that backup had found me inside alone.

No kid.
No sign of forced entry.

They asked me what happened in that house. I know I sounded crazy but I had to tell them. It was the only way I was going to get some answers. 

I made sure to tell them every detail I remembered. The moment I got the call, the moment I stepped foot inside that damn house. 

The basement.
The cage.
The child.
Everything.

They said my radio and body cam both went dark the moment I stepped into that house. Came back online when they pulled me out.

They wrote it up as a simple injury on a welfare check.
“Equipment malfunction.”
“Leg wound, unknown cause.”
There was no explanation.
The child was gone, the person that locked me in the basement was gone, THAT thing whatever it was…gone.

I’ve read the report a hundred times.
I know what I saw.
I know what I heard.

And I know one thing for sure.

Nothing makes sense.

 I see things in the dark that aren’t there when the lights come on. 

I still feel that something is watching…following me.
