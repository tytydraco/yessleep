We had eradicated everything. Every sickness, disease, virus thrown our way, we were able to completely eliminate it all. Our brilliant medical teams invented cures and vaccinations in weeks upon the discovery of new illnesses. Several times. Every time. What happened this time? 

It has been four months since the attack of what we called Squeeze- for the way it made your chest feel when infected. The disease is horrible. It fills your airways with blood until they swell and collapse your lungs. The people I cared for told me it feels like you are being crushed until you simply can’t breathe. I told them the cure was coming. And I watched so many people die having told them that. Having told myself that…

I stayed working in the hospital until we shut down. Nurses were catching the Squeeze quickly, spreading it amongst themselves, to doctors, other patients, their families. 

It all happened so unbelievably fast. Week one we were taking in patients, frankly excited for something to do, and telling them researchers were working on the cure as quickly as possible. Week two we were over run with patients and people were dying, but I knew we would have a cure any day now. Week three hospital workers were sick and dying. Week four we closed our doors. Week five the world was dying. 

After four months, I think I may be the last human alive. The streets are empty. Grocery stores are left open with no one to demand penance. I’ve survived by helping myself to what seems to be mine for the taking. It’s strange to think of what my life has become. I devoted myself to taking care of others my entire career as a nurse. I loved what I did, *believed in what I did*, and lived to serve. Now I have no one. I’m living only to keep myself here. I’ve lost the entire meaning of my existence but I still wake up each day and go walk the aisles of Walmart to find some more non perishables to keep me going another round. I’ve lost everything. Humanity has lost everything. Why am I trying anymore? 

This is what I’m contemplating as I’m staring at the selection of assorted chips. I’m just about to decide between dill pickle and barbecue when I hear quick footsteps approaching and my heart drops to the bottom of my stomach.

I swing around, terrified, and see a man half jogging up the aisle to me.

“Oh thank God, a survivor!” he says, grabbing my hand. 

I’m so taken aback I pull my hand away without meaning to. I can’t believe there’s another human in front of me right now! He looks clean shaven. Put together. I feel myself run a hand through my unmanaged mane. 

“I can’t tell you how happy I am to have found you. You have to come with me, we have to figure out how you’re still here.” 

I can’t even comprehend what he’s saying to me right now I’m so dumbfounded. Where did he come from? Where has he been showering? Are there others? 

“Come with me.” He takes my hand again and starts to pull me away from the chips. 

I pull away from him and swallow hard. How long has it been since I’ve used my voice? 

“W-where?” 

“My lab. We need to figure out how you survived.” 

I let hope tug at my heart as gratefulness floods my chest. Oh thank God, this is a medical scientist. Someone who can still find a cure. There must be others and we can help eradicate this horrible disease for whoever is left. 

Tears burn my eyes and I give a little nod. The man takes my hand once more and leads me out the Walmart and through the town. 

I stumble behind him in a daze. We’re going to be okay. I haven’t felt hopeful in so long I start to feel delirious and find myself laughing crazily as the man pulls me through the streets. 

“We’re here,” the man tells me and opens a door to a stand alone brick building. 

I step into what appears to be a pristine laboratory/doctor’s office combo. The medical grade lights shock me and I feel a little light headed. The air smells sterile, sharp with disinfectant. My nose burns after months of dust. As abrasive as it is, this lab is a good sign. Labs must mean scientists and scientists mean a cure. 

The man guides me to a chair and has me sit. He hooks me up to machines and starts taking my vitals. 

“It’s incredible that you even survived this; the mortality rate was close to total this time,” he says with a hint of wonder. 

“It’s never been this bad.” My voice is a hoarse whisper. I don’t sound like I remember myself sounding. How is this man still so composed? And well spoken? There must be others. 

“No, this was definitely the most difficult trial yet. You’ve always been successful coming up with a cure. And quickly! It’s been astounding. But the contagion rate of Pulmonis-23 was too rapid for even your highest esteemed teams. It’s remarkable really. That it got to them so quickly.”

I don’t understand what he’s saying. I ask the only question I can think of. “Where are the others?”

“There are no others,” he hums, cleaning my arm and poking an IV. 

“What?” My ears are ringing as I watch my blood fill vials for the man. 

“You were the only survivor. I’m trying to figure out why.” 

I feel like I’m going to vomit. “What do you mean? You survived,” I choke

“Your heart rate is rising, I’m going to give you something to calm you down.” And before I can protest he’s replaced the blood drawing vials with a syringe. 

I feel the liquid move through my vein and taste metal on the back of my tongue. My chest eases and the lights seem to soften. My body relaxes. 

“Incredible. There appears to be a mutation in your red blood cells that must have assisted in your immunity to the virus. Possibly something that can be replicated,” the man is now seated, bent over a microscope and jotting notes. 

“What ‘bout you?” I half yell it in my dazed state. 

The man looks up at me from his desk. He purses his lips and eyes me contemplatively.  A small smile tugs the corners of his mouth. A pity smile. 

“Hopefully the data we’ve been able to retrieve from you will be able to make a difference in future trials but, do know, you have given us invaluable medical research in your time. Because of you many people will live to see another day. And because of you perhaps the next trial will have a chance with Pulmonis-23. They’ll never know what you did for them, so thank you. But take comfort knowing because of you, they will live.”
