*If you haven't seen this musical, what are you waiting for? Oh. Wait a minute. Maybe you're one of the people still in 2023 in which case **this is for you**, a blast from the future: an unofficial transcript of the biggest, baddest, bestest musical in the history of humans –*

&nbsp;

*The lights lower. Laser fireworks flare. Soprano Myles Barrison takes center stage and announces:*

&nbsp;

Welcome, welcome.

The O. D. Drama Proudly Presents: Act 1, Scene 1: “Only 25 Hours to Play”

*as sung by soprano Myles Barrison*

&nbsp;

“What is this game we’re playing? Why does it have so many rules? Why can’t I go on slaying… orcs in my gaming schools…”

“I’ll simply ignore it. But wait! Too late. My family has met a terrible fate. All because… I didn’t meet an online date.”

&nbsp;

Now I’m on the run

It is not fun

I am meeting people that have guns

&nbsp;

Into the junkyard

Onto the sea

We go everywhere the app does decree

&nbsp;

Met a lady with one arm she didn’t have much to tell

Then I met her wife and realized they lost their kid as well

&nbsp;

They designed it

Created it

Played god

Now the god is a mod in a game where we lose if we don’t play

And I only have A DAY

Only a day

To play

This app that will slay

What can I say?

It’s not going my way.

&nbsp;

We had to climb a mountain

We had to shoot someone down

We had to do whatever

The damn app didn’t clown around

&nbsp;

At half the day we were at a base and we learned it wasn’t just people

This app was a mad computer and gonna wipe us out

&nbsp;

It told us the only way to win was to lose

What could we choose?

One armed girl lost it a year ago

Her daughter was collateral

&nbsp;

Held hostage

By an ai

If we don’t play we will die

&nbsp;

And we only have a day

To play

What can I say?

Things don’t seem to go our way

&nbsp;

It’s my friend who is at fault I should kill him where he stands 
 
And that is exactly what the app demands

I don’t like this game

It brings me nothing but shame

&nbsp;

I know I have to play

Because at the end of the day

I want my family here and now

But when I refuse and I reflect

I can’t help but deflect

&nbsp;

And then the app has no one to play with it

And I realize it’s full of shit

&nbsp;

My family will be safe now and the game will be over

I would much rather be playing red rover

And what happens when the countdown is due?

Well I’m thinking I should sue!!!

&nbsp;

Yes I only had a day.

And all I did was play.

This awesome fantastic game online where you feel you have to slay.

It felt so real

It was ideal

And now here’s the deal.

Buy twenty five more copies online and you’ll get a free meal

&nbsp;

*As you might imagine, the crowd went wild. Myles waved as only Myles can, bowed deeply and exited, stage left.*

&nbsp;

*The crowd didn't have time to get restless. Next on stage, pacing back and forth like a caged lion, world-renowned singer Rick Rock performing "Hello, Hello."*

&nbsp;

Pleased to meet ya, Mullin’s the name

Would love to shake your hand

Busy, busy, busy, coffee’s my game

You know it’s the best in the land.

&nbsp;

Hello. Hello. So polite.

Highway coffee, always hot.

We’re from Geffor, we’re alright.

Whatever you need is what we got.

&nbsp;

You’re too late to meet Dustin, my friend

A black hole followed him home

Stars and comets and worlds without end

No limits to where he can roam.

&nbsp;

Hello. Hello. Aren’t we nice?

The scenery is to die for.

Be sure to stop by. Some stop twice.

Some stay and add to the local lore.

&nbsp;

A long haul trucker made a bad turn

The black hole called him as well

Result was a tunnel where you gonna learn

There’s worse places than this hell.

&nbsp;

Hello. Hello. Good to see ya!

Oh, you’re from Kyler Bay?

For sure, park your truck over hee-ya

You’re the special for today!

&nbsp;

Mess with my patience, you know what you get

A trip to my tunnel and you’ll say “Oh no!”

You won’t be forgotten, you’ll be in my net

And next year’s race teams will say “Hello”.

&nbsp;

Hello. Hello. What’s that you say?

You can’t get TikTok or a map?

Go north, go south, just go away

Not like this town is a tourist trap.

&nbsp;

Phone not working? Huh. That’s weird.

My phone’s working just fine.

Maybe your signal’s getting caught in my beard.

I’m sure it will work over time.

&nbsp;

Sing it with me!

&nbsp;

Hello. Hello. Sorry to see you go.

It’s funny the things that happen

We hit some highs, we hit some lows

I’m sure, sure, sure we’ll meet again.

&nbsp;

And always remember

&nbsp;

When you read about Geffor

Makes no difference less or more

Dreams and nightmares, friends and liars

Will come to you

&nbsp;

*The crowd goes wild once again. There is a high probability none of them know what any of these lyrics mean. I sure don't. But what does that matter when you're at the world's greatest musical?*

&nbsp;

*Next up, we’ve got Gary the Butcher! His musical talents aren’t the best, but he definitely puts the can  in cannibal!*

&nbsp;

Oh, you're my honey

Oh, you're my baby

Oh, you're my sweet piiie

&nbsp;

My my, don't you see,

My little sweet treat,

What you're doing to me?

&nbsp;

You look so scrumptious

Oh so delicious

My sweetie, sweet pea

&nbsp;

Come on over here

Oh, my precious dear

And give me a little biiite

&nbsp;


Get out the brandy

You’re sweet as candy

Pop right in my mouth

&nbsp;

Twirling all around

Don’t you make a sound

Not even a little peep

&nbsp;

Oh, you're my honey

Oh, you're my baby

Oh, you're my sweet piiie

&nbsp;

My my, don't you see,

My little sweet treat,

What you're doing to me?

&nbsp;

Cheeks so plump

Oh my, what a rump

Just one little biiite

&nbsp;

Round and round

Floating above the ground

Honey, you’re so hot

&nbsp;

Oh, you're my honey

Oh, you're my baby

Oh, you're my sweet piiie

&nbsp;

My my, don't you see,

My little sweet treat,

What you're doing to me?

&nbsp;

I said uh

&nbsp;

My my, don't you see,

My little sweet treat,

What you're doing to me?

&nbsp;
