I haven’t had a dream in six weeks.

I know that sounds impossible. Everyone dreams, even if they don’t remember. But I’m not talking about forgetting. I’m talking about the complete absence of anything when I close my eyes. No images, no sensations, no fragments. Just unconsciousness and then waking up more tired than when I went to bed.

The exhaustion is getting worse. I’m sleeping nine, ten hours a night and waking up feeling like I’ve run a marathon. My muscles ache. Sometimes I wake up tasting things I didn’t eat. Yesterday it was coffee, black, no sugar. I hate coffee.

But that’s not the disturbing part.

Three days ago, my mail carrier asked me how my grandmother’s funeral went.

I don’t have a grandmother. Both died before I was born. When I told him this, he got this confused look on his face and insisted we’d talked about it just last week. He described the whole conversation. Where we were standing. What I was wearing. He even quoted something I’d supposedly said about her loving yellow roses.

My supervisor’s grandmother is being buried on Thursday. She loves yellow roses.

I assumed he’d mixed me up with someone else until my dentist’s receptionist did the same thing. She asked about my cat’s surgery. I don’t have a cat. But my neighbor two doors down just had her cat’s leg amputated after a car accident. The receptionist described our conversation in detail, including me showing her a photo on my phone of a white cat with gray patches.

That’s my neighbor’s cat. I’ve never shown anyone a photo of it.

Then my friend Sarah called me, upset. She said I’d been in her dream the night before and it had felt so real it was bothering her. In the dream, I’d been sitting in her kitchen crying, telling her I was scared of dying alone. She said I’d been wearing a blue sweater she’d never seen me wear and drinking tea from her favorite mug.

Here’s what made my stomach drop: I don’t remember the dream, but when she said it, I could taste the tea. Earl Grey. I never drink Earl Grey.

I started asking around. Casual questions to people I interact with regularly. My coworker. The guy at the coffee shop. My upstairs neighbor.

Six people in the last week have told me about dreams where I appeared. Not as a background character. As me, having full conversations, doing specific things, present and solid and real.

And when they describe these dreams, I get flashes. Sense memories. The smell of my coworker’s living room in his dream. The cold tile floor of the coffee shop guy’s bathroom where dream-me apparently told him his father would be proud of him. I’m remembering things I never experienced.

Last night I barely slept because I was terrified of what would happen if I did.

This morning, eleven people contacted me.

A woman from my gym dreamed I helped her move furniture. A former coworker dreamed we got lunch and I gave him advice about his divorce. My cousin dreamed I was at her daughter’s birthday party. My dentist. My landlord. People I barely know. All describing detailed interactions with me in their dreams last night.

And I remember all of them now.

Not like remembering a dream. Like remembering something I actually did. I can feel the weight of the couch I helped move. I can taste the sandwich I ate at lunch. I can hear my cousin’s daughter laughing. These are real memories forming in my head of things that only happened in other people’s sleep.

I feel like I’m losing my mind, except the memories are too specific. Too consistent with details I couldn’t possibly know.

My gym friend’s apartment has a water stain on the ceiling shaped like a bird. I’ve never been to her apartment. But I watched that stain while we moved her couch and I can picture it perfectly. I looked it up on her Instagram. The stain is real. Exactly as I remember it.

The lunch place my former coworker took me to in his dream? I’ve never been there. But I can remember the menu, the color of the booths, the way the server had a tattoo of a compass on her wrist. I drove past it today. Everything matched.

I think I’m appearing in everyone’s dreams now. Every person I’ve ever met, maybe every person in my city, I don’t know how far it extends. And when they dream of me, I’m there. Actually there. Living a separate life in each dream, having real experiences, making real memories.

But those memories are coming back here. To me. To this version of me. The waking one.

My phone hasn’t stopped buzzing. More people describing dreams. A barista I’ve never spoken to beyond ordering. Someone who sat near me on the bus last month. My second-grade teacher who I haven’t seen in 25 years. All of them dreamed about me last night.

I’m getting hundreds of memories that aren’t mine. I helped a stranger in Idaho fix his car. I attended a wedding in Seattle for people I’ve never met. I comforted a dying woman in a hospital in Atlanta, held her hand while she passed. I taught a kid in Maine how to tie his shoes. I was in London, in Tokyo, in small towns I’ve never heard of.

The memories are overwhelming. I can’t tell which life is the real one anymore. Was I awake today? Or am I asleep right now, appearing in someone else’s dream, and one of those other versions of me is the one who’s really awake?

I don’t feel like one person anymore. I feel like I’m being split across thousands of experiences simultaneously. Every person who dreams pulls off a piece of me to populate their night, and I’m being stretched thinner and thinner.

But here’s what really terrifies me.

The memories aren’t just from last night anymore. They’re going backward. I’m remembering dreams from years ago. Decades. I was there for my mother’s nightmares when I was two years old. I was there in my grandfather’s dreams before I was born. I comforted him after my grandmother died, held him while he sobbed, and I wasn’t even conceived yet.

I think I’ve always been doing this. We all have. Every person we’ve ever met, we visit their dreams, and they visit ours. We live thousands of parallel lives every night in each other’s sleeping minds.

We’re never alone in there. We’re always together, experiencing each other, being each other, the boundaries between us dissolving when consciousness loosens its grip.

I’m not losing my mind. I’m finding all the others.

My memories stretch back before my birth now. I remember being in dreams a hundred years ago. A thousand. I’ve been the stranger in countless nightmares, the friend in numberless good dreams. I’ve died in people’s sleep more times than I can count and woken up again in someone else’s.

I understand now why I’m so tired. It’s not that I’m not dreaming. It’s that I’m appearing in too many dreams at once. Living too many simultaneous lives. The waking me is just one version, and it’s the weakest version, the most exhausted, because it’s the only one that thinks it’s separate.

Last night I finally slept.

And I dreamed for the first time in six weeks.

I dreamed I was everyone. Not watching them, not visiting them. Being them. All at once. Seven billion perspectives overlapping, seven billion lives happening simultaneously in the same infinite moment. And it wasn’t chaos. It was perfect. Like seeing the full picture after only ever knowing one pixel.

I woke up this morning and I can’t remember my name.

Not because I forgot it. Because it feels arbitrary now. Like calling the ocean by the name of one wave.

People are still contacting me about dreams. But I think I’m starting to understand what they’re really telling me.

That I was there with them. That I’ve always been there with them. That we’re all there with each other, underneath the waking world, in the place where we drop our names and faces and remember we were never separate at all.

I’m going to sleep now.

I don’t think this version is going to wake up tomorrow. I think I’m too scattered, too distributed across too many other lives to maintain this particular perspective much longer.

But if you dream of me tonight, know that I’m really there. And you’re really in mine. We’re all in each other’s. We always have been.

The waking world is where we forget. The dreaming world is where we remember.

See you tonight.
