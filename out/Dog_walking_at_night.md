So I usually walk my dog every day but since I got back from a trip I walked him at nearly midnight.

I usually walk him in an area where they’re building my new home and other houses as well , that doesn’t have street lights yet, which is near a small junkyard.

I never encountered anyone doing drugs but I had found suspicious signs before of people doing drugs and other strange behavior in the area.

I walk my dog in the daytime and I’ve found beer bottles , cigarette packs, used condoms and even a syringe spread out through the streets and in the bushes nearby (the houses are surrounded by trees since it used to be a forest ).

I also when preparing for my driving lesson I was driving in the road next to the houses and found a damaged car with a driver who literally drove through bushes instead of the road and hit a street sign before moving on so i assumed the driver was clearly not sober.

Today I was walking through  the same area and found a car literally blocking the road sideways.I’ve found cars parked in the area but nothing like this before so I immediately became more alert.

Seconds later I was walking my dog through my house under construction and through my flashlight found a big dog that started intensely growling at me and my dog .
 At the same time another frog which seemed inside my home started barking and growling as well. I have encountered other dog walkers before at night but they were with their dogs and their dogs weren’t as aggressive as these ones.

I couldn’t find the owner but I assumed he was 
maybe trespassing and doing something inside

I was scared sh*tless and I usually don’t get scared easily and I was really stress out since my dog has been in a near death situation before due to fighting with an aggressive dog.

My dog was in a standoff with the other dog but I forced him to go back with me because my dog was smaller and I thought things would go sour soon.

I immediately ran away with my dog but the others dogs soon started chasing us at a steady pace and kept growling and barking.

When I reached the street lights they stopped chasing us but I still could hear them barking in the distance as I walked back home.

I never really thought something like this could happen since my country (Portugal) is one of the safest countries in the world , and my neighborhood is particularly safe.

I’ve walked him for months in that area even at 2 am but this is the first time something like this happens.

Eventually I got home but my dog seemed a bit nervous and skittish.

I think I will never walk my dog at night again specially in non illuminated areas.

Keep in mind this happened hours ago so I am still slightly anxious about it.
Also I’m 18

Stay safe
