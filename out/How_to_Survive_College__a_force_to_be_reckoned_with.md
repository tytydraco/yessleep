You know how campus security is under the influence of something unnatural?  I’m pretty sure that the town fire department is not.  Ask me how I know.

Hint: it has to do with an exploding battery.

Fortunately they were just like “we’re just glad no one was hurt and now you’ve learned an important lesson about fire safety.”  Then they gave me a ‘fire safety 101’ pamphlet so I strongly suspect I’m not the only college student they’ve gotten called out for.

I feel so so stupid.  The shame will never go away.

Especially since I wasn’t the one that called 911 so that means a neighbor saw the whole thing.

I want to die.  Just crawl into a hole, pull the earth up over my head, and perish.

But fortunately, an opportunity to risk my continued survival on this earth presented itself shortly after this utterly humiliating incident.

It was time to check in with the Folklore Society.  The president has been refusing to talk to me.  I tried.  He just replied to my message with ‘okay I’ll talk to Maria’ and then hasn’t responded to anything else since.  I guess he’s taking the whole ‘sit this one out’ thing very seriously.  So I’ve talked to Maria instead and she’s been a bit at a loss on how to deal with the creature.  Her only idea was to barricade the door it entered through, except we didn’t know which door that was and the only warning was when it banged open and that’s far too late to do anything about it. 

Unfortunately I didn’t have any better ideas either.  The laundry lady hadn’t gotten back to me.

Both of us felt bad about not having done anything with this situation but we had to talk to the Folklore Society, even if it was empty-handed.  Also, as Maria miserably pointed out, it was really her fault that no progress had been made so I didn’t need to blame myself.

Yes I’m still blaming myself but maybe a bit less than I normally do.  I feel bad.  But I’m not staying up late at night doomscrolling to distract myself from feeling like an abject failure.  Progress!  I’ll take it.

Speaking of phones.  (this is an awful segue but I’m going to use it anyway)

Grayson texted me recently, which was the impetus for meeting with the Folklore Society. 

‘I solved the ‘my dad is gone’ problem,’ Grayson’s text read.  ‘I told the university board that he’s taking a sabbatical to deal with his health and will be gone for the rest of the semester.’

I wouldn’t really call that a solution but at least it buys him some time I guess.  Except he’s graduating at the end of this semester and then he’s going to leave so I guess for him it is a solution, because he’ll just vanish and let it be someone else’s problem.

Which really makes me wonder who put this whole arrangement into place to begin with.  To that end, I told Maria it was time to check in with the research team.  Maria has been communicating the things we’ve found out to the Folklore Society members that agreed to help us and it has actually yielded results.  We all agreed that maybe we should keep this discussion out of text, discord, anything digital; as well as off campus, so my apartment became the meeting spot for like eight people.

The apartment is not big enough for that many people.  We literally had some folks sitting on the floor of the living room.  They didn’t seem to mind, because it also meant they were on Titanosaur’s level and he was showing off for them with his toys… which is mostly him getting tangled up in his feather string stick toy and then needing help getting free of it.

They’ve found out some information about the university president.  It had to be pieced together through newspapers, as the website only talks about the current president and there’s no other information to be had online.  Even then, the website doesn’t have any photographs of the current (or former, for those of us that know he threw himself into the river) president.  Like the university is unwilling to leave an easily accessible trail.  The newspaper articles that the Folklore Society found are all candid photos too, with him in the background at graduation or something.  Even the big events - like opening up a new building - only feature photos of the building itself or other distinguished university faculty.

Obviously this is to hide the fact that the president hasn’t changed since… ever.  The Folklore Society went back as far as they could and it's the same person, over and over again.  The university’s first president is their only president.

His son didn't start showing up in photos until nearly fifty years after the university’s founding.  There’s even fewer photos of him, but the Folklore Society pulled off a miracle and found some.

One looks like the library ghost.

Another, from the 1980’s, looks like the steam tunnel ghost.

There’s a few more I don’t recognize.  And there are no photos of Grayson, which checks out since they’ve been keeping photos of the president off the internet.

We’ve asked the Folklore Society to look into the cemetery next.  Especially who owned it and took care of it.  I’m skeptical they’ll find anything, but I want to find out if the groundskeeper was ever a person as well.

“I want a photo of James,” I said grimly, once the meeting had wrapped up and everyone had left.  “Professor Monotone seemed close to him.  He might have one.”

“I’m just glad they were too excited about their progress to ask about the thing in the hallway,” Maria sighed.  “I feel so bad about that.”

“I’ve asked the laundry lady for help.  I should check in on her.”

“The laundry lady?  Really?”

Cassie joined the conversation at that point.  She’d been cleaning up the dishes after everyone left.  I’d volunteered to help her, but I’ve been banned from dish duty after a glass broke and cut my hand last week.  I’m not sure if it’s because I hurt myself or if she doesn’t want to lose any more glasses.

“She can be helpful!” I protested.  “All you have to do to get on her good side is give her challenging things to wash.”

“That’s great news,” Cassie said, hastily drying her hands on a dish towel.  “I have a bunch of bras that need washing.  They have underwires.”

And that’s how I wound up wandering around campus with my roommate’s bras.

/#justcollegethings

Our obvious ploy worked and around the time I was passing the student union, the laundry lady materialized beside me on the sidewalk as she usually does.

“Bras, huh?” she said, eyeing my backpack.

“With underwires,” I confirmed.

“Your roommate is going to have to learn to do this for herself someday.”

“Of course.  But it’s nice to have some help every now and then.”

I fished the laundry bag out of my backpack and handed it over to her.  She… set it aside?  Into thin air?  And then it was gone.  I’m not sure how.  I think I blinked and missed it.

“Speaking of help,” she sighed.  “I’ve thought about your request.  The answer is yes.  I wanted the flickering man gone because he got in my way, but I just don’t like this thing.  It was tolerable only because it showed up only once in a while but now it’s crawling out of whatever moldy hole spawned it every other day it seems like.”

Yessssss I have an inhuman on my side that isn’t the literal devil.  Though the laundry lady has kind of always been on my side.  Sort of.  When it’s convenient.  Or benefits her in some way.  Whatever.  I had help now, that’s the important thing.

“So what do you know about the thing in the hallway?” I asked anxiously.

She stared at me for a moment, arching one thin eyebrow.

“Isn’t that the point of this excursion?” she asked tersely.

“Excursion?”

She stopped walking and heaved a sigh.  When she spoke, her words were curt and sharp.

“Yes.  To the building it appears in.  You wanted to take a look… but ‘with backup’, you said.”

I stared at her for a good minute while my brain sorted out what the heck was happening.  She was referencing a conversation I didn’t remember.  Either I really did have a doppelganger running around or this was something I forgot.  The latter seems more likely, but also alarming because it means I’m forgetting things that don’t have anything to do with Grayson now.  The scope is expanding.

“I’m sorry,” I said.  “I have no idea what’s going on right now.”

“You asked me to go with you,” she grumbled.  “You wanted to take a look at the creature in the hallway, but you were afraid of it, you know, eating you.  So I was going to be there to pull you back if you tried to go diving into the hallway with it.  I know you students have a lot of things rattling around in those mostly empty skulls but I’d like to think I warrant a special place in there.”

I hastily apologized.  Fairly fell over my tongue trying to explain that it wasn’t her, it was me, I was having weird memory problems that weren’t related to the forgetter and we hadn’t figured it out yet.  

“Whatever,” she snapped.  “As long as you’re getting good grades and matching your socks I don’t care.”

She really is like a mom.  But extra.  So extra.

I’ll admit I didn’t like this plan.  It seems exactly like the sort of plan I’d make, but I’d made it in isolation and we’ve established that I do my best work here with my friends supporting me.  The logical move would be to call the whole thing off until I could discuss it with Maria and Cassie, but the laundry lady was staring at me impatiently and I felt if I did, I wouldn’t get a second chance with her.  That’s how inhumans work.  This wasn’t even a choice of refusing an offer, either.  We already had an agreement.  Breaking that would destroy all the goodwill I’d built up and she would never help me again. She might even turn against me and I did not need another enemy around here.

Cassie might not get her bras back and we all know how expensive those things are.

So like the broke, dumb college student I am, I went with her to the English building.

We found an empty classroom to hide out in.  Laundry mom was gracious enough to explain the plan as I’d told her.  Wait until the thing in the hallway showed up.  Judging by the frequency of the sightings, our odds were good.  The laundry lady also alluded to her presence assisting in that - something about the inhuman calls to itself?  Anyway, we’d wait and hopefully that wouldn’t take more than a few hours and then when the creature came by, I’d creep over and take a look through the classroom windows.  Find out exactly what it looks like and whether it’s got… a victim in its mouth.

I didn’t really want to find out and I was legit a little mad at Past Ashley for suggesting this whole plan.  And then getting an inhuman to agree with it so I couldn’t back out.

I wish I’d broken the bargain.  I really do.

We didn’t even have to wait an hour.  I’d written out a text to Cassie to let her know I was doing a dumb thing and then deleted it and rewritten it again about five times when the creature decided to appear.  I’d just about worked up the nerve to hit ‘send’.  The laundry lady was by the window to the outside, watching the students walking past and muttering commentary to herself on their life choices.  (we were on the second floor)  Things like ‘I wouldn’t show my face in public wearing something with that much polyester in the fabric’ and ‘ugh, stop making out, you’re blocking the sidewalk for everyone else’ or ‘skipping class? Seriously? With that GPA?’

Then a deafening bang silenced her.  Her head snapped around, staring at the hallway with hawkish anticipation.

“This is your moment,” she said.  “Go take a look.”

“You’ve got me, right?” I asked anxiously.  “You won’t let me go into the hallway.”

“Of course.”

She stared directly at me.  There was a look in her eyes and it wasn’t comforting, she’s not that kind of a creature, but something in it felt familiar.  She looked at me like a mother would look at their child, but it was sharp and cold and unyielding.  It felt like my heart evened out.  Slowed down.  The panic was buried under the weight of that stare.

I turned towards the window.  I watched.  I watched as the creature emerged, its head filling the hallway and the rest of its body following behind it, purplish-gray-green flesh pressed against the glass windowpane.  It reminded me of an aging bruise.  Sickly yellow bleeding down the ripples of flesh, patches of black and purple, lines of blue.  Its head was elongated, almost canine in nature, and the eyes were sunken under swollen rolls of flesh.  It seemed like that was all it was.  Flesh.  Roiling, battered flesh, forcing itself through a hallway that was much too small to accommodate its bulk.  Like watching toothpaste being squeezed from a tube, I thought.

There was an arm protruding from between its jagged, irregular teeth.  A human arm.

The fingers twitched.

Its head turned slightly in my direction.

I screamed.  I whirled away from it, collapsed to the floor, and screamed.  I covered my head with my arms.  I felt… too much.  All those things I’ve been shoving into the corner of my mind had finally come unmoored and they were tumbling loose, a raging current in my head, and it was all too much - my grades, my friendships, my one failed relationship and how I was going to be alone someday and how everyone I love will die or leave me and and and

Somewhere in all of that, I lost myself.

And I didn’t find myself until my fingers were on the doorknob and the laundry lady’s arms were wrapped around my chest, dragging me backwards.

“She’s dead!” the laundry lady was shrieking.  “That girl in there is dead!  You have to let her go!”

I was babbling something.  Something about how I had to save her.  Save all of them.  I felt the words on my tongue, thick like gravy.  And then it shifted, even as the laundry lady dragged me away from the door, and became something else.  Something worse.

About how I didn’t deserve to be happy.  That I’d gotten other people hurt.  People killed.

That I hated myself.

And with the last one, I found myself being flung violently to the opposite wall.  My back slammed against the window pane and I collapsed to the ground, my legs sprawled behind me.  The laundry lady stood at the doorway leading to the hallway.  The creature had backed up so that its head was positioned directly at the door, waiting to swallow me up if I had managed to make it through.

I tried to call out to her.  To tell her that I didn’t mean it.  That it wasn’t true.  I don’t hate myself.

I just… sometimes I feel so overwhelmed.

But the laundry lady was twisting a dishrag between her hands and her shoulders were square.

“That’s enough of that,” she said firmly, ignoring me, her attention entirely focused on the creature.  “You don’t get this one.”

And I could only watch.  As.

She went out there.  Struck it with the rag.  Three times and it flinched and retreated.  The arm fell from its mouth.  Just an arm.  The body was gone.  The girl was dead, just as the laundry lady had said.  There was no one to save.

And then.

It lunged.  Grabbed her.  Like a dog shaking a toy.

I heard her break when she hit the window.  I saw her blood - translucent like laundry soap -  on the glass as her body slid down it.

And the creature retreated and somewhere in the building, a door slammed behind it.

I ran into the hallway.  Her body was gone.  There was only the thick smell of bleach in the air.

I write these posts as things happen.  With my memory issues lately I feel this is the safest way to make sure I don’t forget things, because Cassie isn’t always around to tell things to.  If I write it down, I can find it again later.  I have a rule for myself.  I don’t change things after the fact.  If I wrote it, it stays that way.  No changes.  I just want you all to know this.

Because I regret making stupid jokes at the beginning.

The laundry lady is gone and there’s no getting her back.  I know this because this is what the devil told me.  I wandered aimlessly around campus, stunned, unable or unwilling to grapple with what had just happened.  That voice in the back of my head was whispering about how I’d gotten someone else killed and why shouldn’t I hate myself for that and I was crying so hard I could barely see where I was going.

Then someone put their arm around my shoulders and gently steered me away, off the sidewalk, and back behind a building where there wouldn't be anyone staring at me.

“You can’t blame yourself for everything,” the devil said to me.  “Especially not the actions of one of my kind.”

I sobbed some more and tried to get some words out.  Something about how she didn’t need to do that.  That she only had to keep me from going out into the hallway, not that she had to go herself.

“We’re bound to act according to our nature,” he sighed.  “Even if it hurts us.  Even if it makes us vulnerable.  You realized her nature far too late.”

The way she looked at me.  I crumpled to the ground, rocking back and forth helplessly.

“Now you need to figure out that creature’s nature.”

So I could destroy it.  Because apparently that’s what I am now.  I kill things.

“If it’s any consolation,” the devil sighed, “she’s not really gone for good.”

That brought me around a little.  I raised my head enough to look at him.  His sharply angled face was impassive as he stared down at me.

“I’m old,” he said.  “Very old.  Older than you think.  I’m the devil but the devil has been cast into many roles and they became me and I am them as well.”

The trickster.  An archetype that goes back to the dawn of civilization.

“I know how the world works better than anyone,” he continued.  “Creatures like that - well, they don’t really die.  Not like humans do.  You can’t kill a concept so easily.  She’ll crawl back out of the morass at some point.”

“She’ll… come back to life?” I managed to say.

He continued to stare down at me and there was a darkness in his eyes that felt immeasurably vast, like staring into the distance of the universe, and I had to avert my gaze.

“No,” he said.  “We do not live as humans live and so we do not die as humans die.  She is gone.  The fears and desires that formed her remain and they may form her again.  That is all.”

“She’s dead, then,” I said.  “In the way that matters to humans.”

“If that’s how you want to feel about it,” he sighed.

“I shouldn’t have asked her to help.  Why did I do that?  What was I thinking?”

There was a long pause.  

“Yes,” he said quietly.  “That is an important question.  Why did you ask her to help?”

Then he walked away.
