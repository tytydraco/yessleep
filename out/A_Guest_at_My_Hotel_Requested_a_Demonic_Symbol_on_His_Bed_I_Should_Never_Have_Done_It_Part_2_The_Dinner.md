[\[Part 1\] The Check-In](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15tscvu/a_guest_at_my_hotel_requested_a_demonic_symbol_on/)

\[NSFW/Trigger Warning\]\[self harm\] I didn’t arrive back at the resort until noon the following day. I decided covering the graveyard shift after already working a full day earned me a late start. I had been home barely five hours when my alarm went off and I had slept very little of it due to the terrifying episode in my bedroom, but I had to get moving. As my thoughts drifted back to work, what had felt like such a frighteningly real experience just hours ago began to fade. The memory of it seemed nightmare-like now, and while I knew it would stick with me, the sense of danger I’d felt was gone. Going back to the resort off virtually no sleep now seemed more daunting. I was the only rooms division manager on duty for the next week and my team needed me. Caffeine was going to be my friend today. Without much time to get ready, I pulled my hair up into a messy bun, threw on a cardigan over my plain gray top, grabbed my favorite cherry limeade energy drink, and hopped in my car. I started guzzling it as soon as I was on the road.

While I was still in the resort parking garage, I remembered I was going to text one of our front desk agents, Neal, to see if he knew what Kilday’s symbol was. Neal was quiet and aloof, but he also knew a lot of stuff about a lot of things no one else did. Sometimes that meant ancient religions, and sometimes it meant rabbit holes like flat earth and reptilians in the federal government. It also meant he was just the kind of person who might recognize the symbol. I texted him the photo I took of the rose petals on the bed: Hey Neal. Guest had me make this. Do you know what it is?

When I got to my office, I found something strange sitting on my desk—three giant, black feathers. They were large enough to have come from a vulture or some kind of oversized buzzard. I rolled my eyes, knowing full well who must have put them there. Kat was off today, and our mid-shift front desk agent was Rory, another twenty-something. We had a running gag where whenever Rory found some random, weird thing around the property, he’d neatly place it on my desk while I was away. I went out behind the desk to see him. He was wearing black and white Jordan 1s along with his uniform slacks. He knew I was the only manager who’d let him wear basketball shoes at work. We were cool.

“Rory, where’d these feathers come from?” I asked.

“What’s up Osprey. I don’t know, but they’re all over the ground by the planter out front,” he said.

The planter he spoke of ran along the floor-to-ceiling window where I’d seen the tall, eerie figure the night before. I realized then that things were still going to be weird today.

“Have you seen Mr. Kilday, the guest who checked into 4180 last night?” I asked.

“I don’t think so. Why?”

“Nothing. There was a small issue with the room when he got in. Just wanted to check on him.”

He shrugged. “It’s been pretty dead today. Only twelve departures and four arrivals so far.”

“Who’s working security?” I asked. I still needed to get to the bottom of where that tall, black case went.

“Morris.”

“Great…” I droned. “I have to go down there. Call me if you need something.”

But before I paid a visit to security, I walked out front to inspect the planter. What Rory said was true. More giant, black feathers covered the succulent plants and sugar palms used for landscaping. I bent down to look at them and I noticed something else—the tips of the feathers were singed like they had been burnt. I could almost feel static in the air again as I recalled the visual of the tall figure walking where I now crouched, and it sent chills to my fingers and ears. Had I actually seen something after all? Was I not just imagining it? And If I had seen something there, was it the same nightmare entity that took the form of my neighbor’s dog, Moose, I’d seen in my apartment? I didn’t want to think about it.

Resort security was down on the basement level along with the loading dock, storerooms, and cafeteria. To find the black case, I’d need security to review the cameras.

“Morning, Morris,” I said, walking in.

“You mean afternoon.” He nodded to a clock showing 12:09PM. Morris was in his fifties, a former flight attendant who left the airline business in search of a career that gave him less to do. His entire manner of speaking seemed designed to put off taking action for as long as possible.

“Well, it’s morning for me. Hey, I need your help finding something. Last night there was a black, hard plastic shipping case when I walked into 4180. But it was gone when I went back later. We don’t know whose it is or what happened to it. I’d like to check the cameras.”

Morris leaned way back in his chair. “Hmm. Well, that sounds like a polymer case.”

Was he really playing semantics with me over the material the case was made from? “Whatever. We just need to find where it went. It felt heavy, like someone probably had to use a pallet jack for it. Can you check?”

He touched his fingertips together. “Well, those polymer cases typically have a set of wheels on one end, so it may not have required a pallet jack.”

This was typical Morris—addressing everything but the actual point. I was going to have to try a different tact with him. “Right, wheels, of course. Glad you thought of that. Can you review the elevator cameras between 5PM and 11PM yesterday and look for someone wheeling a black polymer case?” I gave him a slight smile and lightly touched his shoulder.

“That’s a lot of video to replay, even at eight times speed. But for Osprey? I am glad to provide my services.”

“Perfect. Thank you, Morris.” I started to walk away but stopped. “Uh, not to come off weird, but can you also see if there was someone really tall walking through the planter by the lobby windows around 5:20?”

“I can see only what the cameras will show me.”

“Great, Morris. You do that and let me know.” I touched him on the shoulder again and left the security office. Morris wasn’t a bad person, but sometimes hotel staff can be just as infuriating as the guests.

By then, I really had to use the restroom. I had chugged the whole energy drink in the car, and if you’re someone who binges caffeine like I do, then you know the um…effect it has on the body. I walked into an employee restroom, and after making sure no one else was in one of the stalls, locked the restroom door. I couldn’t allow anyone to see me. There was something else I had been dealing with for the past year, and this was one place it liked to confront me. I took my time in the stall, procrastinating—dreading what I knew might await me when I opened the stall door. Eventually, I stood up, zipped my pants, and eased open the door. I saw nothing, only my own reflection in the bathroom mirror. I inched out of the stall and checked my surroundings. For now, I was alone. I went to the sink and washed my hands, checking behind me in the mirror every few seconds. I shut off the water, dried my hands…and waited.

“I know you’re there,” I said into the mirror. “Just get it over with.”

I waited a few more breathless seconds, and then I saw its reflection—the shape of a small head, hands, and shoulders in the shadow beneath the door of another stall. My body went rigid. No matter how many times I saw this, it always terrified me. The being in the shadows crawled out from under the stall and stood up behind me. He was a young man with a buzzcut, early twenties, shorter than me, and with scrawny arms and legs, almost childlike. His face was relaxed except for his eyes. They held a patient, quiet fury that bordered on hatred. I wanted to close my eyes, but I couldn’t. I’d feel too guilty if I did. Instead, I made myself turn around. And when I did, I couldn’t see him, just as I always couldn’t. He existed only in the mirror, and not just this bathroom mirror. He existed in all the mirrors of the hotel, but only when he caught me alone, because it was me alone he wanted to scare. Of that I was certain. No one could see him but me. I had casually dropped hints around my coworkers to see if any of them mentioned him, but none ever did. He was my own personal specter, and I thought I knew why. He had once been an employee here, and just when everything seemed to be going right for him, he turned up dead. Upon learning of this, I had said something that would forever haunt me, something I regretted and wished endlessly I could take back. And somehow, he knew, and he was intent on constantly reminding me.

I looked back in the mirror. A hole was opening up in the young man’s forehead. I knew what would happen next, and as if on cue, blood started spurting from the gaping wound. When the reflection of his head was right over my shoulder, he opened his mouth and screamed—a piercing, ceaseless wail I knew I alone could hear. I covered my face and retreated across the restroom floor. I slumped against the wall and curled up into my knees. All the while, the screaming continued. I lifted my eyes once. I still saw no one in front of me, but in the mirror, his reflection loomed over me.

A moment later, it stopped. I was alone in the restroom once again, in the mirror and out. It didn’t happen to me every time I was alone by a hotel mirror. No, that would have been too predictable. He wanted to keep me guessing, feeling a constant sense of unease. But every time it did happen, I emerged shaken and in a pit of self-loathing that made the rest of the workday almost unbearable. I stood up and splashed my face with handfuls of cold water. I didn’t have time to put on makeup that morning, but if I had, my face would have been an impossible mess.

I did my best to look and act normal and went back up to the lobby.

Rory was waiting and waved me over to the front desk. “Hey. Morris called from security. He wants you to call him back.”

“Okay, wow. That was quick for him.”

“And we’re getting noise complaints from some of the pool-facing rooms on floor three.”

“Which ones?”

“3133 and 3135. Want me to put you through out here?”

I sighed. “No, I’ll call them from the back.” I went into the office and sat at my desk. I called security first. “Morris, you didn’t find the case already, did you?”

“I haven’t looked yet,” he said on the other end.

I closed my eyes for a second, feeling a headache coming on. “Okay, what then?”

“I have, however, reviewed the lobby cameras from 5:20PM. Would you like me to tell you my findings?”

“Yes, Morris…I would like you to tell me.”

“Now, as I pointed out, I can only see what the cameras will show me, and after watching them multiple times, I regret to inform you they did not show me anything.”

I didn’t know right away whether to be relieved or concerned that the cameras didn’t pick up the tall, eerie figure I saw. If they had, then what the hell was that thing? But they hadn’t, which left open the possibility I was going crazy, something I had begun to entertain more and more seriously.

“Thanks, Morris. Try to let me know soon about the case, okay?”

“I will be glad to, Osprey.”

“Great. Bye.”

I hung up and pulled up the reservations for the two rooms that had called-in noise complaints. 3133 was booked under Nguyen. I hadn’t dealt with them yet and there were no troubling notes on their reservation. And 3135 was…Wojciechowski, the last person I wanted to talk to. I called Nguyen first. Their phone rang five times without an answer. This happens all the time. Guests will call to ask for something or complain, and if I have to call them back, they don’t pick up the phone. They either leave the room for some reason or do something stupid like sit on the balcony with the sliding door closed so they can’t hear the phone. Then they get upset because they think we didn’t get back to them. Still, 3133 was an ocean suite and the Nguyens had booked it for seven nights. I went up to visit them in person.

Off the elevator, I rounded a hallway corner and knocked on the door to 3133. A soft-spoken woman answered almost right away (but didn’t pick up the phone? I hate hotel guests). I heard the problem. Numetal music was absolutely blaring from the pool deck. Anyone staying on this side of the building could hear it.

“Hi, Mrs. Nguyen? I’m Osprey with the guest experience team. I’m here about your noise complaint.”

“Finally. Does this sound appropriate to you?” She pulled me into her room by my hand and yanked open the balcony door. “You hear how loud that is?” she said as numetal ricocheted off my eardrums.

“Yes, of course. I’m very sorry about that. I’ll make sure—”

She interrupted. “This is not what I pay for when we stay at this resort. And if that’s the kind of guest you allow here, there are plenty of other places we can go.”

“I understand. I assure you we’ll take care of it. We take this very seriously and I will personally make sure they turn the music—down…” I trailed off when I looked back outside and saw the guest in question.

Mr. Kilday was alone, shirtless, and stretched out on a chaise lounge surrounded by a bucket of beer and several end tables with plates of food. He had a big wireless speaker next to him streaming music from his iPhone. He was the only guest at the pool. I looked at the water. It was brackish and cloudy, not at all the clean, blue-hued water it normally was. Then I saw why. The tall, eerie figure was laying flat on the bottom of the pool, and now there seemed to be something sprouting from its back. My gut twisted and I had to grab the balcony railing to steady myself. Was I going crazy or not?

“Don’t just stand there, go make him turn it off!” said Mrs. Nguyen, understandably upset.

“Ma’am, do you see that? In the pool?” I asked her, trying to seem calm and probably failing.

She looked and blinked. “See what?”

I pointed at the water. She didn’t react.

“Miss, are you alright?” she asked.

“Yes, sorry. I just thought I…never mind. I’ll make sure he turns down the music, Mrs. Nguyen.”

I left the room and leaned against the wall once the door to 3133 shut. I felt like I was falling apart. If the resort had been fully open, I would have gone home early for the day. There would have been other managers and more staff to pick up the slack. But right now, it was just me and the employees Amisha still allowed me to schedule. I took a few deep breaths and stood back from the wall just as a sharp-looking brunette in a maroon jogging suit approached.

“Why does that room have a doorbell and mine doesn’t?” she stopped and asked with a raised eyebrow, referring to 3133.

I tried my best to reset for this new conversation. “That room is a suite. All the suites have doorbells.”

She crossed her arms. “Well, why didn’t I get that one?”

I wanted to be like, “I don’t fucking know. Did you book it, bitch?” but I obviously couldn’t say that. I noticed her room key sleeve. It said 3135. She was in the room next door. This was Mrs. Wojciechowski.

“If you’re thinking about upgrading, I can look and see when one of our suites will become available,” I said instead.

“You know who my husband is, right? Jason Wojciechowski. He stays 180 nights a year in your resorts. We’re diamond members.”

“Yes ma’am, I met him yesterday.”

“We’re supposed to get automatic suite upgrades.”

“Yes, when those suites are available. But we’re undergoing renovation and only a fraction of our rooms are open. No suites were available when your husband checked in.”

She scowled. “We know the hotel ownership.”

At this point, I stopped caring. “Oh, me too! I know the owners. What’s one of their names?”

She clearly didn’t know. She just stood there and looked at me incredulously, then tapped her room key on the lock and disappeared into her room. I slumped against the wall again. The hotel gods were surely punishing me for something. And now I still had to go confront Kilday about turning down his music.

I got down to the pool deck and walked over to where Kilday was lounging. Despite the day I was having, my face lit up once we saw each other. I couldn’t help it.

He raised his aluminum beer bottle to me and smiled big. “There she is! I was getting worried about you, girl! Haven’t seen you all day!”

I sat down on the edge of the chaise next to him. We had to shout over the numetal. “Sorry! I just worked a really late night! How is your stay going, Mr. Kilday?”

He tipped the bottle upside down, finishing the last of it. “Pretty good! Except you don’t have Modelo, only Corona.”

“We serve it inside. Our distributor only carries it in the glass bottles, so we can’t serve it at the pool.” I peered into the water. It looked like it always did—clean and blue. The tall, creepy thing was nowhere to be found.

He seemed to notice where I was looking. “Hey, we still on for tonight? You and me? Dinner?”

I was having mixed thoughts about that, so I didn’t want to commit. “Uh, real quick, first! So, Mr. Kilday, we’ve had several noise complaints about loud music coming from the pool area,” I started, still shouting. “And I almost don’t want to say anything because—well, I know how I’d feel if it was my anniversary and my partner couldn’t make it—it’s just—and sorry again, but—”

He lowered the volume before I even finished. He adjusted his sunglasses and let his mouth hang open for a second. “I thought you said no one was staying here because you were, like, remodeling?”

Had I just made him mad? I couldn’t tell. I replied in a soft, measured tone. “There are still some guests here, and most of them overlook the pool.” I waited for him to react. The hairs on my arms bent over backward as the strange sensation of static all around me returned. My skin felt cold and my insides turned hot. I remembered this feeling. I didn’t dare look back at the water. I wondered if Kilday could tell I was scared.

He let it hang in the air for a few more seconds. Then he popped open another Corona bottle.

“Nah, I’m just playin’. I’ll keep it down. Hey, are you alright? You look like you’ve been through some shit.”

I exhaled and the unpleasant sensation went away. “I’m fine. It’s just when you do this work long enough, people get to you sometimes.” I didn’t know why I was opening up to him like this. I barely knew him, but it just came so easily.

“Good thing we’re grabbing dinner later. You can tell me all about it. You’re still down, right?”

I should have brought up seeing his symbol again on the SUV’s rear window last night. I should have pressed him about the nature of this vague partner of his. But I just couldn’t. I wanted him to like me and sought his approval. After deliberating for a moment, I caved. “Yeah. Sure. Where did you want to eat.”

“Right here. At the Aqua Table.”

The Aqua Table was our oddly named upscale restaurant. It used to be called something that made more sense, but corporate wanted a rebrand and this was what they came up with. “You want to eat here?” I asked. “I was thinking somewhere off property.”

“My partner says it’s the best seafood in town.”

I knew eating on property with a guest could be a bad look. I could actually get in trouble for it. But the GM and Amisha weren’t around and there was just something about Kilday that made him impossible to say no to. “Okay. We’ll eat here,” I conceded.

“My girl!” He clasped his hands together, ecstatic. “The Aqua Table. 8PM. Let’s pregame. Have one on me.”

He offered me a Corona from his bucket. I knew I’d cave and drink with him later, but my stomach couldn’t handle alcohol at the moment. “I’m a lightweight, I’m sorry. Let’s wait til tonight,” I said, picking up one of his empty bottles and cheers-ing him with it.

I checked my phone once I left the pool deck. I had a dozen work-related texts, but one in specific I’d been waiting for. Neal had texted me back about Kilday’s symbol. It read: We cant text about this. Its not safe.

I didn’t usually take Neal seriously. But if I was ever going to, I realized this might be the time. But the thought of flaking or canceling on Kilday was even more nerve-wracking. Plus, I really did want to eat with him. I texted Neal to say thanks, then went back up to the lobby. I knew I would see Neal at work the next evening. I could ask him more about it then.

The rest of my workday was relatively drama-free. I checked with security again to see if Morris had found the black case, but he had gone home. The guard on duty after him said Morris hadn’t told him anything about it. When 8:00PM arrived, it was time for dinner.

The Aqua Table had this weird “nautical meets millionaire kitchen” vibe that never gelled for me. Lots of dark, polished woods, fake fruit bowls, and granite countertops violated by fishermen’s nets and steering helms. Whatever. People seemed to like it. I had eaten there before and the food was actually great.

“Don’t tell anyone I’m doing this, okay?” I told Terry, the elderly waiter I hoped would be serving us, when I walked in from the lobby.

He winked and held a finger to his lips. Then he leaned in and whispered, “Osprey, you deserve a good meal here more than any of these motherfuckers I see every night.”

That was a good sign. I could trust Terry. He walked me over to a table in a semi-secluded corner of the restaurant. Being midweek with the hotel nowhere near full, the restaurant was practically empty. Two other parties were seated, but not near us. Kilday was already waiting for me. He wore black jeans and a white and silver button-up that would have looked at home in a Vegas nightclub circa 2008. His fauxhawk was impeccable. He stood up and pulled the chair out for me.

“I didn’t have a change of clothes,” I said self-consciously as I sat down.

“Don’t worry,” he said, then paused. “You look good.” It was awkward for all of three seconds.

“You ready for that drink?” he asked.

“God, yes,” I said immediately.

Terry took our drink orders. Kilday had Irish whiskey, neat. I had a vodka soda. I noticed there were three place settings and three glasses of water.

“In case my partner gets here while we’re eating,” Kilday explained.

“Are they coming tonight?”

He shrugged. “We’ll see.”

I must have glanced at that empty chair every fifteen seconds throughout the meal. Every so often, I thought I saw a glimmer of movement in it from the corner of my eye, but once I turned and looked, there was never anything there. I figured it must be my lack of sleep or a trick of the light in my peripheral vision. I should have connected it with the similar phenomenon in my apartment the previous night, but Kilday had my full attention now. He was stuffed himself with his fish tacos and talked about his background. He had grown up in the southwest—Albuquerque, Fort Worth, El Paso, and eventually Phoenix. He said he was a fat kid growing up and never had friends or money. I started wondering if his apparent wealth was all his partner’s. He said he worked now as a traveling consultant but stopped short of describing what kind of companies he consulted for. Once I’d finished my seabass, he asked me about myself.

“What kind of name is Osprey?” he asked. “I mean it’s cool and all, I’ve just never heard it.”

“Ha!” I exclaimed, laughing with asparagus still in my mouth (by then I was on my third vodka soda, and like I said, I’m a lightweight). “An osprey’s a bird. It’s a seahawk. So, you know the Seattle Seahawks? You’re actually watching the Seattle Ospreys.”

He seemed kind of blown away. “That’s rad. The last girl I dated was named Jasmine. Osprey is way cooler.”

Had I been sober, I might have seen that as a red flag. He talked like a single guy even though it was supposedly his anniversary and we were waiting for his partner. And was the insinuation supposed to be that maybe he and I were going to be dating? It all slipped right by me.

I leaned across the table and (I’m so embarrassed) may have batted my eyelashes at him. “So, am I still supposed to call you Mr. Kilday, Brandon?”

“You can call me whatever you want. My last name is pretty sick though.”

“Cheers to that, Mr. Kilday!” I said and held up my now empty glass, which he clanked with his.

“My last name is…Palmer!” I rocked back on the chair legs and started laughing. My bland last name must have seemed especially funny to me for some reason because I almost started crying.

He chuckled and signaled to Terry for another round of drinks. “It’s not that bad, girl. Nothing wrong with Palmer.”

“Of course there’s not.” I play-hit him on the shoulder, which he didn’t react to. Suddenly, he was the serious one. I quickly blotted my eyes with the napkin.

“You alright today?” he asked. “It seems like something’s bothering you. I get it though. Dealing with all these people.”

Little did he know the pandora’s box he’d just opened. I wiped my mouth and began. “Don’t get me started. It’s like you learn who people really are when you see them every day in an industry that incentivizes dishonest behavior. People know if they bitch, you’ll give them free shit. You know most hotel guests create all their own problems? Like, it’s not my fault you simply assumed every room has an ocean view and didn’t look at what you booked. They’re clearly labeled online: garden view, partial ocean view, and full ocean view. How many sides does a building have? At least four! Every room can’t face the ocean. What’s that? You’ve been here for two hours and your room still isn’t clean so now you want a free upgrade? That’s because you arrived at 9AM! Check-in is at 4PM! It says it on your confirmation! The previous guest in the room—who probably trashed it—has to check out by 11AM, then the housekeeper has to clean it. And she probably has eight other rooms to get to that day. It takes time! It doesn’t matter how long you’ve physically been here. ‘Well, you should just clean them all the night before,’ you say? And do what? Leave half our room inventory vacant every night? Great way to run a business, asshole!”

I took a breath and kept going. “These people are so selfish, narcissistic, petty, and insecure. Like they give themselves orgasms by being cruel to employees they know can’t talk back to them. Or how they love to stand there, taking up all your time, telling you about how many houses they own and how many countries they’ve visited, or how they once worked at a hotel for a summer in college, but look at them now! Look how far they’ve come! And if you—meaning me—if you just apply yourself then maybe you too can be just as awesome and rich and successful as them! What an inspir-fucking-ation! All of it’s just to gratify their ego. They all just want to have more than whoever’s in the room next to theirs. They’re all children! It’s like you grow up being taught how to act like an adult, but then once you are an adult, you still act like a child except you’ve found all these stupid ways to rationalize it! I think sometimes it’s made me just, you know, hate people. Just in general. I’m sure there are some good ones, but—”

“Like you and me,” Kilday interjected.

“I don’t even know about that. You maybe, but…okay, can I tell you something I’ve never told anybody? Like, you can never ever tell my coworkers this. Okay, I’m just gonna tell you. So, there was this kid who worked here named—”

I stopped myself, not because I was being cautious or knew I was getting carried away, but because Terry had returned with my fourth vodka soda and whatever number whiskey Kilday was on. He leaned in close and whispered to me. “You okay, Osprey? Sure you can handle another?”

“Thank you, Terry. I’m sure.”

Terry studied me for a second. “Drink some water, okay?” He was about to walk away but froze—for only a second or two—looking at the empty chair for Kilday’s partner. Despite his occasionally dirty mouth, Terry was an old, religious man who always knew how to comfort you. But for that one moment, I saw a level of fear in his face that was alien to me, like it was a mask, like the light in his eyes had extinguished permanently. I’d never seen that look in someone before. Then, as if he’d imagined whatever it was that he saw, he looked away and went back to the kitchen, quietly mumbling to himself.

“That waiter alright?” Kilday asked.

“He’s fine. He’s just old,” I said after a sip of water and a longer sip of vodka soda. “So, this kid worked here named Dustin. Well, he was in his twenties, but he was like a kid. He was this short, scrawny guy with a buzzcut who was always over-the-top nice to everybody. Like, he’d write these long, handwritten letters to guests he helped and would personally deliver them to their rooms before he went home. And everyone else who worked here just thought he was the best, most special person ever. He was always nice to me and I was nice to him. But he was soooooooo annoying. He spoke fluent English, but you could barely understand him and he was always like this naïve, little children’s book character walking around. Do you know how frustrating it is when someone tries so hard to be your friend every single day, and gives you hugs at weird times, but you just want to stay away from him, but you can’t do that and you can’t even say anything because everyone else is his friend and if you talk badly about him then they’re all going to think badly about you? Like, other people must have thought he was annoying, too, right? But they made him employee of the year last year. And then he shot himself in his car in the parking garage two days later…Nobody knows why. Maybe his life at home was bad. We still don’t know.”

“That’s heavy,” said Kilday, listening patiently.

“And you know what my first thought was when I heard he was dead? I was relieved. I thought, ‘Good, now I don’t have to talk to him anymore.’ How fucked up is that, right? Who has thoughts like that? What does that say about me? And you know what’s scary? I still see him. All the time. I see him in every mirror in this hotel. It’s like he’s sticking around, just to remind me I’m a bad person.”

Kilday scrunched his brow. I couldn’t read him. “Are you saying he’s a ghost? Or do you think it’s all in your head?” he asked.

I answered honestly. “I don’t know. But the more it happens, the more I lean toward it not being all in my head.” I suddenly didn’t want to drink anymore. I felt my emotions coming on thick and heavy. “You probably think I’m crazy now.”

Then he surprised me. “I don’t. I’ve never seen a ghost or whatever, but I always said if I met someone who had, I would take them seriously.”

I felt this warmth coming from him, like despite all my venting, that he got me. But then, for the first time all evening, I saw Kilday’s eyes drift to the empty chair. It wasn’t for long, but the way his mouth subtly parted and how his eyes quickly shot back to me, it was like he had acknowledged someone sitting there. Then he stood up.

“I gotta pee. Don’t go throwing down with some guests, now,” he said with a smirk as he walked off.

I watched the chair suspiciously, wondering if I could somehow focus on the space in front of the chair rather than the chairback, then maybe I could see whatever Kilday and Terry saw. It was useless. I was trying not to blink, staring at the air. I felt a headache coming on. It was too early to be the vodka. We’d been there only an hour. I needed caffeine. My day had been so crazy I hadn’t stopped to drink any since the morning. The headache was a withdrawal symptom. I was so dependent on it that my brain stopped working properly without it. I could ask Terry for a Coke when he came back. Even that would be enough.

I turned around at the sound of dishes and glass breaking. Terry had fallen down carrying a tray of food. He was laying prone on his stomach, wheezing, struggling for air.

“Oh my god,” I said, almost calm and slow to react, in semi-disbelief. The couple waiting for their meal across the restaurant stood up, startled. Then I snapped out of it. “Terry!” I shouted and rushed over to him. “What’s wrong? Can you breathe?” I asked. He gasped and stretched out his arm, pointing at the open chair for Kilday’s partner. I still saw nothing, but I felt static again, and maybe it was just adrenaline, the vodka, or the lack of caffeine throwing my senses out of whack, but the lobby music suddenly seemed very, very loud. I turned Terry over on his back. He clutched his chest with his left hand and continued pointing at the chair with his right. His eyelids were sucked back and the whites of his eyes were red with veins. “What is it, Terry? Your heart? Is it your heart?”

He gasped and I saw his lips moving. I leaned in close. His voice was barely above a whisper. “No skin…It got no skin…”

“Somebody help! Call 9-1-1!” I finally shouted. The couple across the restaurant pulled out their phones. I froze. “What do I do, Terry? What do you need?” All management had to take an emergency first-aid and CPR class annually, but no one retained anything. I couldn’t remember shit. And Terry was focused only on whatever he saw in the chair. His lips were still moving. I bent closer to listen.

“Flesh and bone…no skin…skull with eyes…horns in a circle—” He grimaced and grabbed his chest with both hands, rolling onto his side in a fetal position.

Kilday came out of the restroom. “Oh, shit. What happened?”

“Go to the front desk! Call security!” I told him. He nodded and hurried off.

“Ambulance is on the way!” the husband from the restaurant couple shouted to me.

I don’t know why—I still couldn’t see anything—but I took out my phone and snapped a photo of the empty chair. Then Terry grabbed my hand and looked into my eyes. I had never seen someone so afraid.

Paramedics arrived shortly after. Terry was still alive when they loaded him onto a gurney and wheeled him into the ambulance. They said it was a heart attack. I had no idea if he’d survive the night. We called it a night and Kilday returned to his suite. I called a Lyft to take me home. Terry’s emergency sobered me up real quick, but I was in no shape to drive. While in the back of the car, I looked at the photo I took in the restaurant. The chair still appeared empty, but there was a vague shape visible above the chairback. It looked like two sharp points coming together, but not quite touching, to form the top of a circle. The shape had a translucent, ethereal quality to it, like it wasn’t a physical object. I remembered one of the fragments Terry whispered to me: [“…horns in a circle.”](https://connorgunnin.com/)
