I  work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery  into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for  money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site.  There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch  of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While  renovating the building I found the journal of someone named Ewan. After  reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to  share it.

My name is Ewan and I  live in a monastery on the Mississippi river. I have trained most of my  life as a warrior monk.  I was 21. It was 1861.

Much  like 4 years ago our monastery was holding a meeting today. The KKK had  begun to round up alleged changelings again, this time in greater  numbers. The whole southeast was being targeted.

A  few years ago a giant factory had been built in Dixie, manufacturing  bolt action rifles for the KKK. Now that they were adequately armed they  were getting bold.

That morning I  sat beside the water, praying with my compatriot Zackariah. We were  both a very calming presence and the animals often came to greet us.

Alziza sat behind us, surveying the river.

“The orcas will return” Alziza prophesied.

Almost  immediately the pod of orcas returned and came to greet us. They eyed a  native american suspiciously when they saw his whale bone club.

Zackariah turned and looked at me. “Fancy a swim?” And jumped into the water.

I followed after him and before long we were surfing on the orcas as we did 4 years ago.

“Well I was supposed to give you your test today and I think this is a great way to do it don’t you?” Zackariah laughed.

“Yeah lets get started,'' I responded.

“So what layer of hell are we currently in?” Zackariah asked.

“We are currently in the 9th layer of hell” I responded quickly.

“What happens if you commit a sin that will send you to a particular layer of hell?” Zackariah asked, surfing along.

“The  demon of that layer will enter your body and you will have to contend  with it controlling your actions. The layers are as stated in Dante’s  inferno.” I responded.

“”Up to what demon do we tolerate in this church?” Zackariah said with a snarl.

“We  tolerate up to violence, the 7th layer. The intolerables being fraud,  treachery and Beelzebub..” I responded, surveying the willow trees and  iguana as we surfed along.

“Bonus  question!” Zackariah chirped. “Get this one for extra credit! What layer  of reality was the human race before the watchers turned against Yahweh  and corrupted us?”

“The fourth layer of purgatory” I responded with a grin.

“You  sly devil you! You did the math didn’t you? Most people don’t actually  do the math…” Zackariah responded, surprised. He faltered for a second,  almost falling off the orca.

The orcas turned around and we doubled back.

“Wow  you aced the test! Too bad its not that easy, not everyone gets a halo.  I didn’t get one and I got everything but the bonus question.”  Zackariah chirped.

“The master has become the apprentice,” I joked.

Zackariah looked bewildered and the rest of our surf was of silent reflection.

When we got back Max was sitting by the water talking with Alziza. Grimoire Bank and Grimoire Noir floated ominously.

“I have awaited your return” Max said, looking at the orcas with love in his eyes. “Such beautiful animals”

I hopped into the water and swam to shore, and stood before old Max.

“On one knee child.” Max spoke.

I got down on one knee and felt both Grimoire Blank and Grimoire noir on each of my shoulders.

I then heard Yahweh’s voice loud and clear. “Take this halo kid, you’re going to need it.”

I opened my eyes and rose looking around me, then I closed them again.

‘I have a halo and I am illuminated’ and it toggled on.

I  could see perfectly, my eyes were good but I could see so much detail  in everything that was so far away with the halo on. It was detailed but  different from seeing with light. Reminded me of a stylized picture  book I had seen once.

I then noticed the halo above Max’s head as he looked at mine.

“I  had hoped he would give you one” Max said with a smile. “I must be off  to prepare for the battle ahead.” and Max left, followed by his  possessed bibles.

“Did you read that book I gave you? Jesus Christ drgaonbrorn?” Zackariah said from behind me.

“Haven’t gotten around to it yet.” I said turning around.

“Did you get one? If you did at 21 that would be some kind of record.” Zackariah chirped.

“Yeah” I responded with finality.

Zackariah looked defeated and walked away. I felt envy coursing through him.

I  wondered if he could see with his third eye for a second. He had all  these stories but the more he never seemed to repeat any of them made me  suspicious.

We gathered in the chapel at noon. All the monks of the monastery were present.

Max stood at the front of the room with his possessed bibles, beside a stack of mail.

“We will start with the cesarians this time” Max said with a smirk.

He grabbed the sealed letter and opened it. He read it over then read it aloud.

“We  have investigated and found evidence of land octopus activity, we will  send 1 legion.” Max said with a smirk. He looked briefly at grimoire  Noir.

He grabbed the next letter off the table and opened it.

“Abraham Lincoln will send 4000 riflemen and 400 cavalry.” MAx said, sounding impressed.

The native americans had already joined us, with a force of 500 braves this time.

After the meeting we were off, other monks meeting us along the way as we made the journey to dixie.

Many of us had horses while others marched. I rode Alziza.

“The halo will make you much more effective in this fight. It lets you see in the dark you know” Alziza said ominously.

“I know that” I chirped back. “Is that all you have to say wise ass?”

“You’ll see.” Alziza responded ominously.

Within a few a days we started seeing alligator jaws sewn to all sorts of animals. Cows, pigs, dogs, people.

An alligator faced man and his dog watched us suspiciously then went inside their house.

Before  long we were outside of Dixie making camp. In addition to the 500  braves we had a force of 222 monks, all with bolt action rifles.

Before long some klansmen came on horseback. They had a white flag waving.

Deb  was leading them and I could tell from her robes that she was a grand  dragon. The image of the red dragon was painted in blood upon her white  robe.

I wondered if she recognized me, as it had been a long time and I had a beard now. She didn’t seem too.

“Ya’ll  we don’t need to fight, '' Deb said with a grimace, treachery clearly  on her face. “Let us show you some southern hospitality. We’ve learned,  we’ve grown, we aren’t eating the changelings. Why don’t ya’ll come into  town and see for yourself what we have been up too.”

Deb looked right at me through her thick glasses. She was basically blind and

I saw no recollection in her eyes.

Max  looked her over thinking, and then grimoire Blank responded for him. “I  see beyond the witch’s ploy. Take her offer, her trap is pitiful  compared to Yahweh’s wrath.”

We  gathered our rifles and followed them into town. There were children  playing in ways that seemed out of place. Like they had been put there  just to fool us. Despite this there seemed to be lots of them and my  fears were eased slightly.

We walked by the factory and I could see klansmen cleaning their guns and giggling.

We  ate dinner and it seemed to be free of any alleged changelings and we  were shown to what seemed like nice quarters. We went to bed that night  expecting Abraham Lincoln to arrive while we slept.

I was awoken suddenly by screams and gunfire that night. I don’t know how long I slept, but it didn’t seem like long.

I went to grab my rifle as Zackariah lazily got out of bed.

The door flew open and two gator dogs charged into the room, both biting into Zackariah.

I grabbed my gun and shot one as they tore him apart. I loaded and shot the other one before it came at me.

I heard screamed and gunfire coming from the other rooms and a gator faced man walked into the room.

“Rufus? Doggo? NO!” He screamed.

I shot him quickly and went into the hall.

Gator men and dogs were ripping monks and braves alike apart and I started to wonder at the book’s judgement.

3 gator men looked at me and I knew my limits. I turned and ran down the halls with them following closely after me.

I pushed open doors as I ran through complex, hearing gator voices taunting me from behind.

Eventually I came to a dead end and turned around. I saw 3 gator men and their dogs come in behind me.

“You got 1 shot kid, who you going to kill?” the three gators laughed.

Then a man came through the wall. He wore a cowboy hat and I could see his halo. He had a lit cigar in his mouth.

He pulled out a pistol with a revolving chamber and fired it 6 times in 3 seconds. Killing all 3 gator men and dogs.

He  squinted at me threateningly. “You monks tipped us off in the first  place. We saw the statues, but the culprit has not yet been found.” The  man said, spitting on the ground. “You know since we’re here I think  we're going to deal with this changeling abduction problem. These  klansmen could be worshiping the land octopi for all we know.”

He reloaded his revolver. And looked at my rifle.

“Primitive.  You people live like animals.” The man said and phased through another  wall. I heard 6 shots ring out almost immediately.

I ran down the hall until I found my way outside.

There were checkpoints everywhere, klansmen fighting northerners with equal weaponry. Bodies lined the streets.

I saw a gator bear tearing a northerner apart, and another licking his blood covered chops.

The halo gave me a distinct advantage on that moonless night as I crept in the shadows, avoiding the firelight.

I  came upon a courtyard and saw a number of klansmen gathered around Deb  and all 3 Dora’s. I guess they had just rezzed her after last time.

Alleged changelings were tied to posts and covered with honey and jam, an offering to some creature of the night.

I then heard high pitched wailing screams, reminding me of banshees.

Then  I saw them, 15 foot tall monstrous women. They had their eyes missing  and sword like fingers. I thought for a second about a book I had read  on wendigos. It had said you just had to shoot them through the heart.

I noted that with my halo on their heart was clearly marked. Alziza really was wise.

The wendigoes descended on the alleged changelings and stuck their sword fingers into them, sucking their blood like mosquitoes.

I ran for my life, being as quiet as possible. I knew wendigoes could see in the dark too.

I ran around the side of a building and saw the cowboy hatted man lying there dying. Two bullet holes in his stomach.

He  looked at me and winked. “Hey kid, do you fear your creator? If you put  me before him instead of letting me bleed out ill let you have my  rifle.” He held the weapon up. “Loads the next bullet all by itself. Put  the clip in and just pull back to empty the casing. REAL bolt action.”  he said in obvious pain.

I took the gun from him, said a prayer for the cesarion and shot him through the eye like he wanted.

I moved quickly knowing the gunshot would give away my location.

I came upon a group of 3 other monks, all with halos.

‘That’s probably why they are still alive’ I thought to myself.

“Ewan! Get over here!” one of them called.

As I approached them I heard wendigo screams and turned to see 8 of them charging down the streets towards us.

Me and the other monks all fired, killing four of them. Then I fired 3 more shots emptying my clip.

The lone wendigo hit us before we could even reload. They moved at 3 times the speed of horses.

Its hands sliced through two of the monks, and the surviving one ran as I reloaded.

The wendigo was upon him in no time, killing him. It turned to me as I finished reloading and I shot it through the heart.

I ran through the streets keeping to the shadows.

The  wendigos massacred the men without halos. They fired randomly at their  bodies, doing no apparent damage. I fled from the carnage of Dixie  running off into the overgrowth.

I ran until I came into a clearing, seeing 4 wendigoes at the other side.

I  aimed my rifle and fired through their hearts one by one as they ran at  me. The last one dropped to my feet and I reloaded. This was the last  clip the cesarion had given me.

I heard voices in the distance and followed them to find Max and Abraham Lincoln, surrounded by northern riflemen.

They had apprehended two of the Dora’s and had them tied up.

Max  and Abraham both took a jug of holy water from a spring Jesus had  blessed down in South America and poured it on the Dora’s. They totally  melted into a puddle of nasty smelling puss.

“We have been repelled today, but we will return with 10 times as many troops!” Abraham Lincoln screamed. Rallying the troops.

We  left with our tails between our legs and I wondered about the  cesarians. It certainly didn’t seem like they sent an entire legion.  Perhaps they had realized our ploy and sent a smaller force?

Abraham  Lincoln headed back up north. To rally as many troops as possible.  Justice would come for the KKK, an American civil war had truly begun.

When  we reached the monastery I recorded the event so that my contemporaries  as well as future generations may have a true account of the second  changeling crisis that started the American civil war.
