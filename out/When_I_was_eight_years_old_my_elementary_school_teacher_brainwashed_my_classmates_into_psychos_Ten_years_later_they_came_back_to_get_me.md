At twelve years old, I had a disgusting, feral thought to butcher my best friend and a party of seven kids with the knife I was supposed to cut my birthday cake with.

I didn’t do this, of course. I never would have. But that didn’t stop the intrusive thought slipping into my mind and filling my brain with fog. I was aware of everyone singing happy birthday in symphony, and bright coloured balloons floating around me. I was aware of my father’s smiling face, and all of the food in front of me. 

Except their voices quickly blossomed into white noise, and my grip on the knife was suddenly far too tight on the handle of the knife. I was holding it close to the cake, my mouth stretched into a grin—ready to blow out my birthday candles. But then my gaze was flicking to the girl in front of me, and I was wondering how easy it would be to slash her throat. It would take two strokes, maybe three. I wouldn’t make a mess, and if I did—I had the party table cloth to clean everything up with. Once that thought was protruding into my skull and wouldn’t leave me alone, I was glancing up at my father. 

The adults would be a lot harder. They would fight back. My wandering gaze found his tie tucked into his collar—and I knew exactly how to asphyxiate the breath from the lungs. I knew every weak spot. Suddenly, their singing voices were too loud. I hated them. I hated their stupid voices, and I wanted them to stop. My grip tightened on the knife. So easy, I thought, dizzily, my thoughts foggy and distant. It would be so easy to kill all of them.

I could see it so vividly, images bleeding effortlessly into my brain.

I was supposed to cut the cake, I thought. And the cake was so pretty. It was my favorite colour. Twelve flickering candles smothered in orangeade light. I started to move towards the cake, unaware of my fingers stroking the teeth of the blade and nicking myself. It didn’t hurt. If anything, the sudden buzz of pain motivated my thoughts further. “Matilda?” My best friend’s voice felt and sounded far away, and she was right in front of me. I was suddenly all too aware of my own happy smile twisting and curling into disgust.

I hated her. The knife felt so right pressed into the flesh of my palm, and I wanted to make her hurt. I wanted her to stop smiling. I wasn’t sure how much time had passed before the singing had stopped, and the other kids were no longer in front of me. They had backed away with their parents, their expressions filled with fear. 

I flinched when warm hands wrapped around mine, slowly pulling the knife from my trembling fist. Blinking rapidly, all of the colour bled back into the world. My father was kneeling in front of me, and his eyes were so sad I wanted to cry for him. Before he could speak, I sucked in a breath and stumbled back, my eyes zeroing in on the knife. I didn’t have to speak. Both of us knew what was going on.

My hand was stinging, and the pain was suddenly very real and cutting. I stared down at pooling red trickling across my palm.

No matter what dad told me, as well as my therapist, I thought it was beautiful.

Blood oozing and pooling and trickling, spattering and splattering and painting skin, walls, carpet and flooring—

Blood.

Exploding and imploding from the back’s of heads, dripping from noses and lips, and tainting flesh.

It was beautiful.

I didn’t care what anyone else said—my mind was far too gone, far too intrusive and powerful over my own sense of being.

The thought of slashing my best friend’s throat and painting my birthday cake glorious, startling red, filled me with an emotion I was yet to understand. Still though, as quickly as these thoughts came, they crept away. I was left feeling sick to my stomach, brandishing a knife like I wanted to cause hurt. I will never forget the look on my best friend’s face. Her wide eyes and twisted lips. She was terrified of me, and there was no way I would be able to make that better. 

Six times. We had moved to six different towns, and each time I thought I was okay. 

I thought the thoughts wouldn’t come back to get me. Except I was naïve. No matter what I did, I knew they would always come back to get me, and that was enough to send my thoughts spiralling. “Daddy?” My voice was soft, and my fingers felt empty and raw without the knife.

 I choked back a sob. “Did I do it again?”

“No! No, of course not! It was just a slip up, okay? You’re okay, sweetie. I promise you.”

Dad was too quick to reply. He was already twisting around to apologise to the party guests.

“I’m so sorry,” His voice was like a blade slicing into my brain. “My daughter… she’s… she suffers from a condition.”

The party guests were already murmuring to each other.

“Condition?” Mrs Leela, my best friend’s mom, choked out a horrified laugh. “You call that a condition? She needs to be hospitalised!”

Before my dad could reply, she was grabbing her daughter’s hand, and pulling her away.

The others followed, mumbling words I didn’t understand. Psychosis. Schizophrenic. Nutcase.  

I didn’t remember my knees buckling and dropping to the ground in my birthday dress. I hated that I was still staring at the knife, at the razor sharp blade, and my own hand was twitching. I wanted to hold it. No matter how hard I tried to push away the thought, I wanted to wrap my fingers around the handle and hold it. When I pressed my head into my lap, my eyes filling with tears, dad’s arms were wrapping around me and pulling my face into his chest. He was shaking his head, telling me it hadn’t happened again—and it never would happen again. But I knew it would.

I knew it would, because even pressed against my father’s jacket which smelled like his cologne, and home, my body was trembling, twisted and contorted into doing the unthinkable. He was weak, my mind whispered to me. It was the perfect time to attack. Dad told me it was okay to raise my arms and hug him back, but I wouldn’t allow myself to. Because I knew, once I had freed my own arms, and relaxed my tense muscles, they would go around my father’s neck, cinching his tendons, and snapping it without a second thought.

This specific memory always came back to haunt me—even now, 10 years after my mind was twisted and purged out of shape.

Six weeks ago, I was sitting in a coffee shop with my housemates. I was enjoying the creaminess of macchiato, revelling in its warmth as I wrapped my freezing cold hands around it, nursing the coffee to my chest. I can’t remember what I was doing. My laptop was in front of me, but I’d given up on actually working a few hours ago. My housemate Freddie sat opposite, his eyes glued to his phone. I was staring into the dregs of my coffee, when Freddie's boyfriend Issac finally slumped down in his seat, throwing an arm around my housemate. “Brainwashing support group, huh.” That caught my attention.

Lifting my gaze, I frowned at my housemate’s boyfriend. “What?”

Issac pointed behind me. “Brainwashing support group.” He chuckled, and I followed his gaze. “Is that even a thing? Also, have enough people been brainwashed to have like, a support group?”

Freddie chuckled into his drink. “I doubt it. It’s probably code for something, or maybe some kind of fucked up joke.” His attention went to me. “Speaking of jokes, have you heard from Penny today? She was supposed to wash the dishes, but she bailed before I could toast her.”

My housemate’s voice sounded kind of faraway. The ambience of the Starbucks shop was white noise as I found myself twisting around in my chair, my gaze flicking to the poster. It looked new, printed in Times New Roman. “HAVE YOU EVER BEEN BRAINWASHED?”

Following the text, underneath it said, “For support, come and join us at the campus library. We’re a small group, and we share stories. Feel free to come along if you are a victim of gaslighting, brainwashing, or mental abuse. This is a safe space, and everyone is welcome, including family members. Please do not see us as a joke, this is a serious group and our aim is to find survivors who are willing to tell their story.

“Mattie?”

Freddie’s low murmur brought me back to reality, though I couldn’t stop thinking about the poster. We left the coffee shop, my housemates taking between themselves. I found myself trapped in the past, memories I had shoved down bleeding back to the forefront of my mind.

I wasn’t even aware of coming to an abrupt stop—like my body was in control of my mind.

“Hey, I’m going to head onto campus to get some studying done,” I heard myself say.

Freddie stopped walking, his expression crumpling with worry. “Are you okay? You seem… kind of out of it.”

Issac rolled his eyes. “Relax, she’s fine!” He prodded me in the shoulder. “Get home before 10, alright? I’m ordering pizza.”

“Hmm? Oh, yeah.” I smiled. “Pepperoni for me, please.”

The two of them exchanged glances. Freddie cocked his head. “Have you hit your head?” He nodded to my coffee cup I forgot I’d been holding. "Did all that expresso go right to the brain?”

I shoved him, forcing a smile. “No, I’m okay. I’m just…. tired, I guess? Probably from the holidays.”

“Tired?” Freddie looked sceptical. “You don’t look tired, you look like you’ve been given four hours to live.”

Rolling my eyes, I groaned. “I’m fine. Go on ahead.”

Issac hummed. “You heard the girl,” He shoved Freddie. “Come on. We’ll fulfil our duty and get the pizza. Mattie’s gotta study,” he turned back to me. “And if Mattie is lying, and goes to a party, she’s going to be sitting on the doorstep in minus temperatures until the morning.”

Typical. Issac wasn’t even a member of the household and was somehow making the rules.

“Sure.”

I nodded, and the two of them walked away, Issac practically dragging Freddie. Initially, I had no idea where I was going. But the more I walked, I found myself standing in front of the campus library, which was lit up the late evening glow casting me in warm white light. I headed towards the door, glimpsing a figure leaning against the wall. Getting closer to him, his identity bled into view; a guy around my age with thick brown hair hanging in his eyes, a trench coat over jeans and t-shirt. Pinched between his fingers was a crumbling cigarette, and he had just enough visual appeal. I watched smoke dance in the air, heading towards the door with intention to pull it open and walk in. At the last second, however, I stopped myself, and to make myself look less awkward, pulled out my phone and pretended to check a message.

“Your phone isn’t on, genius.”

The guy surprised me with a gruff laugh. He was right though. My phone died halfway through my study session.

Choosing to ignore him, I shoved my phone in my pocket, turning to him. “Are you going in?”

When the guy turned to me, the light from the building illuminating his face, something snapped inside my mind, fight or flight kicking in.

His lips curved around the cigarette, and I was suddenly mesmerised in his movement, in the certain glitter in his eyes.

Which was suddenly far too familiar. I realised I knew that smile, and those sharp movements. Like my mind was coming apart, I was seeing him in clarity. As if until that moment, he had chosen to hide himself. My body was slowly moving before my brain could fully register what was happening. I stumbled back, my breath sucked from my lungs, and with almost supernatural speed, he was grabbing and shoving me against the wall. 

“Do you know how many fucking college’s we’ve been to?” He gasped out through a hysterical giggle, which didn’t match an eighteen year old guy. He was acting just like his childlike self, like he hadn’t  even grown up, stuck at the age of eight years old in a much older body, and yet that psychotic smile I knew all too well twisted his lips. “Far across state, every college town and university you can imagine. Searching for you. And here you are.” His breath tickled my face. “I didn’t think you were stupid enough, but here you are. Hook, line, and sinker.” With him so close, I knew exactly how to get away from him. With one jerk of my hand, I could break his neck in two.

But I was paralysed. I couldn’t move.

From the sound of running footsteps, which sounded like they were dancing towards me, the thought hit me.

They’ve found me.

The guy moved closer, with one hand pinning me to rough brick. “Our teacher,” he said in a breath. “She needs our help.”

His words were enough to bring memories back, and they were sharp and cruel, slicing into me.

Reminding me why I tried to kill my friends at my 12th birthday party—and why I had been in solitary confinement for a whole year.

Elementary school.

I lost my mind in elementary school.

I remember walking into class with a bounce in my step. It was spring, and I was enjoying the cheery blossom outside. I had spent the last ten minutes running around trying to catch blossom in my cupped hands, until dad told me to head inside. I wasn’t expecting a new teacher when I slumped into my seat. I was so used to Mrs Clarabelle, who wore pretty dresses and had rainbow hair which smelled like apples. Instead of Mrs Clarabelle, however, there was a stranger standing in front of the class—and from the expression’s on my classmate’s faces, none of them knew who she was. 

She didn’t look like a teacher. Instead of an extravagantly coloured dress like my initial teacher, the woman wore a black suit. Her hair was in a strict ponytail, and a pair of raybans pinned back her fringe. Jack Torres leaned across his desk, his eyes wide. “Are you a secret agent?” He asked in awe. I had to agree with him though. Our teacher did look like a secret agent. I loved watching movies with them, so it was jarring to be sitting right in front of one. When the woman’s lip quirked into a slight smile, I relaxed in my chair.

“No,” she surprised me with a warm smile, before turning to the white board and grabbing a pen. “But I will be your teacher starting from today.”

“Where’s Mrs Clarabelle?” Jack pulled a face, leaning back in his chair. “She was my favorite! I don’t want her to goooooo.”

“Yeah!” Evie Clare joined in. She stood up and folded her arms across her chest. If there was a social hierarchy in elementary school, Evie was at the top. She was the kind of girl I stayed away from. Her parents were crazy rich, and the girl often looked down on other kids who weren’t as well dressed as her. She had her own little group of minions who followed her around like she was some kind of queen. When Evie stood up, she spoke for the class. Just like when Mrs Clarabelle banned Tamagotchi’s, and Evie had led a sort of rebellion, convincing us all to refuse to eat our lunch if we weren’t allowed Tamagotchi’s. Surprisingly, the ban was lifted.

This girl was like our third grade classes spokesperson. “We don’t know who you are, you could be a stranger.” Evie said. “Where’s Mrs Clarabelle? Mrs Clarabelle is our teacher.”

Something darkened in the strange woman’s eyes, and she cleared her throat.

“Please sit down. I will explain to you as soon as you take your seat.” She cleared her throat. “Also, I am not stupid. Young lady, I can see the candy under your desk.”

Her gaze flitted to Jack. “And yours.” She held out her hand. “Throw it in the trash, please. I do not allow candy in my classroom.”

I thought the two of them were going to protest, but something in the woman’s expression was fierce, and they did so without complaint.

Well, Evie took dramatic strides, and acted like she was throwing gold plated candy into the trash—but she get rid of it.

“Okay, now that’s taken care of!” I watched our new teacher write, “Hello! My name is Mrs Teller!” Followed by a giant smiley face. Underneath: “Can you tell me your names?”

“Mrs Teller.” Evie raised her hand, a sly smile on her lips. “The smile on the smiley face is wonky.”

“So?” Jack turned to her with a grin. “Why do you care, weirdo?”

“Because.” Evie slapped her desk with her hand. “I don’t like wonky things—and that smile is wonky. I want her to change it.”

Mrs Teller nodded along. “Right. I’m sorry, Evie.” She winked, wiping away the smile with a flick of her finger, and redrew it. “Or should I call you Princess Evie?”

She laughed, when Evie looked startled, before doing a dramatic spin to face al of us.

“Okay! As I said, I need you names, don’t I?” She pointed to the back row. “Do you want me to start calling you names which pop into my head?”

“No!” We all shouted back.

“Well, hurry!” Mrs Teller had an energy our old teacher didn’t. Mrs Clarabelle had been sweet and quiet.  Mr Teller was more daring, choosing to make classes a lot more fun. Instead of planting flowers and singing songs, we were allowed to scream. She pointed right at me.

“You’re…. Ozzy, right?” She chuckled, moving onto Mara Highcliffe behind me. “And you look like…..a Benny Two Shoes.”

Evie pointed to herself. “What about me?”

“Pegasus.”

The girl giggled, before slamming her hand over her mouth in mock horror. “Pegasus is a stupid name!”

“What about me?” Jack jumped up, raising his arm. “Can I have a funny name?”

Mrs Teller turned to him, her lip curling. “Hmm.” She pretended to think, tapping her chin. “Phoenix!”

The classroom erupted with laugher, kids yelling their real names-- and I joined in, shouting my name along with the others.

“Jack!”

“Mara!”

“Sadie!”

“Evie!”

“Jasper!”

“Pippa!”

“Matilda!” I cupped my mouth to make sure I was loud enough. Ozzy was a cool name, though. It made me sound like both a boy and a girl.

Nodding to each of us, Mrs Teller covered the whiteboard with all of our names, before putting the lid back on the pen.

“It’s nice to meet all of you.” Her smile was warm, and I trusted it. Mrs Teller was different to my other teachers. They talked about math and fractions, and boring stuff like that. Mrs Teller told us stories about her times traveling the world and sang songs to match each country. I loved her classes. I loved sitting at the very back and doing work in my workbook, watching Mrs Teller dance around the classroom, twirling around, and pulling kids from their chairs to dance with her. I found it strange that she dressed like a secret agent but acted like a kids TV presenter. The best thing I liked about her was that Mrs Teller didn’t make us do proper work.  She made us do tests which weren’t math or English. 

Instead, we had to focus real hard to read what was written on a blank piece of paper. Initially, I couldn’t read it. None of us could no matter how hard we squinted and flipped the paper over, frowning at it from different angles. Mrs Teller reassured us we were close.

I was never close.

The paper hurt my head.

“Practise means perfect!” She would always sing when kid’s started to cry with frustration. I will say it started to get painful. The girl sitting behind me, Pippa, started complaining her head hurt. Followed by other kids. Though with the pain came clarity. One day, Pippa jumped up, raising her hand, her lips split with glee.

“Mrs Teller!” She squealed, waving the paper in the air. It was several months into the school year, and every day we were expected to spend at least an hour trying to read the piece of paper. None of them had even came close to being able to read a seemingly blank piece of paper, only getting headaches. Adam Moore got a nosebleed, and Mrs Teller gave him tissue paper to wipe his face, pushing him to break through the pain. Pippa wasn’t exactly the smartest in the class. She thought Canada was the capital of Australia. So, we were all surprised when she jumped from her desk, swiping at her head. Twisting around in my chair to look at her, I could tell from the crinkle between her brows and the slight curl in Pippa’s lip that she was in pain. “I did it!” She squealed, attracting Mrs Teller’s attention. 

The teacher straightened up from where she had been helping Eleanor Chase. The teacher raised her hand and quietened the classroom, the buzz of chatter which followed Pippa’s sudden announcement. “Oh?” Mrs Teller’s eyes glittered, her pearly smile widening.

“What does it say, Pippa?”

I hadn’t noticed how pale the girl was, until I was looking at her properly. Pippa was a redhead, so her skin complexion was practically pallid white, while her hair bounced in a ponytail. Her hand holding the piece of paper was trembling, but her smile only stretched right across her face. 

“It says,” Pippa cleared her throat dramatically to make sure everyone was listening, and that she was the centre of attention. I didn’t like Pippa. She pretended to be the smarty pants, despite knowing all her test answers were wrong. I couldn’t help feeling jealous of her.

“It says….” Pippa dragged out the words, giggling.

“She’s taking too long.” Jack  grumbled in front of me. When he caught my eye, the kid looked equally annoyed.

“Yeah, I bet she’s lying.” Evie spoke up loudly. She stuck out her tongue at Pippa. “Can you tell us? We’re getting bored.” The girl mimed a yawn, and the rest of the class giggled. “Unless you’re lying, Pippa.”

Pippa’s eyes narrowed. “I’m not lying!”

“Then tell us what it says!” Evie’s lip curled. “You’re just pretending so you can be all dramatic. I know your game.”

“Evie, that’s enough.” Mrs Teller shot the girl a look, and Evie backed down, turned around in her chair and huffed loudly. The teacher’s attention flicked back to Pippa. “Alright, what does it say? You can tell the whole class, sweetie. Don’t worry, they’ll be able to see it soon.”

Nodding, Pippa showed us the blank piece of paper. “It say’s we’re going to be doing something really special!”

“What does that mean?” Jack asked, his lips curving into a frown.

Mrs Teller pretended to zip her lips. “Well, I’m not supposed to tell you, but…”

She leaned forward, and so did we, eagerly.

“You’re going to be having a special class,” she whispered. “I’m not supposed to tell you so you have to be quiet!”

Her words confused me. “Who are you not supposed to tell?” I asked, cocking my head.

Mrs Teller’s gaze found mine, and for the first time I saw them as piercing. “Do you want to be in the special class or not, Matilda?”

I shrugged, my cheeks blazing when my classmate’s giggled.

“Yes.” I whispered.

“Okay. Well, special children do not ask questions which do not concern them. Do you understand me, Matilda?”

Ducking my head, I nodded. “Yes, Mrs Teller.”

With the promise of an extra special class if we all managed to see through the invisible paper, our class tried harder. There were more headaches, more nose bleeds and crying, before Jack jumped up from his chair one day, practically vibrating with glee. I think he was so excited he didn’t notice blood dripping down his chin. 

Mrs Teller cleaned him up, and praised him, promising him and other kids that they could go on the field trip. Evie was next. Of course she was. The girl was super dramatic, doing a twirl in her dress, claiming that she was the best because she didn’t suffer a headache or a nosebleed. I did, however, glimpse the girl shoving bloody tissue paper into the trash bin during recess. I started to notice a change in kid’s who had started to see the hidden message on the paper, and the rest of us who were still struggling. Pippa has grown unusually silent since announcing that she could read the paper. Mrs Teller had given her extra work to do, though every time I slipped past her to go to the bathroom, I noticed the girl wasn’t even writing. Instead, her eyes were half lidded, her lips set into a dreamy smile. 

Pippa could see something I couldn’t. Swallowing a thick paste which started to creep its way up my throat, her expression scared me. It reminded me a little of my mom’s—when I had said goodbye to her four years prior. Mom hadn’t even made eye contact with me, only grasping my hand, and muttering my name.

Needless to say though, I really didn’t want to be left out of the special class. Despite my classmates acting weird, I forced myself to break through the barrier Mrs Teller talked to us about at the start. When explaining what exactly the exercise was, our teacher told us that there was a barrier inside every brain. To make this sound easier to understand, she did a theatrical re-enactment, making it extra goofy. 

Mrs Teller stood in front of a desk and pulled a face. “This.” She slapped the wooden top. “This is your brain, everyone!” When we all laughed,  she shoved a chair in front of the desk. “And this? This is the scary barrier which is stopping you from reaching your potential! But!” Her grin made me laugh harder. “What if we were to knock over the chair, hmm? That’s what I want you to do with your paper. I want you to visualise breaking the chair, so you can see the desk more clearly.”

“Breaking the chair!” We all sang when our teacher jumped onto the desk and pumped her arms. “Breaking the chair!”

So, that’s what I did.

Or… I tried to.  I was one of the last ones to break through the barrier. There were three of us left, and the field trip was looming. One night I asked dad if he could help me solve a problem. Mrs Teller told us not to tell our parents about the super fun games we were all playing, so I asked him how I could solve a particularly hard math sum—to which he had looked up from his laptop, and offered me pensive smile over his coffee. “Try relaxing your mind, and think about something else,” dad told me. “And then, who knows? Maybe if you put less strain on yourself, it might come to you?” He did pull a face though. “Mattie, what exactly was the math sum? I can give you the answer if you want?”

Shaking my head, I insisted I could do it myself. Then I did exactly what dad told me to do. I didn’t think about the blank piece of paper all night, and during normal classes, I pushed it out of my head. At recess, there was nobody to play with anymore. The kids who could read the message stayed in class, staring into thin air. Sometimes Mrs Teller brought people into class to talk to them. They weren’t teachers. I didn’t know who they were. 

All of them had scary faces and were my dad’s age. I watched them poke and prod my classmates, asking them questions like, “Are you able to see this?” While holding several blank pieces of coloured card. Jack, Evie, and the others nodded their heads while Mrs Teller stood by with an odd look on her face. I had decided that day I would become like them. I wouldn’t be left out like the other two kids. So, I slumped down at my desk, put my head down, and glared at the paper until a dull pain was blossoming behind my eyes, the lights above me suddenly far too bright. 

Blank. I stared harder. 

Blank! 

I gritted my teeth so hard I could taste rusty coins at the back of my mouth. Getting progressively more frustrated, I decided that I was going to pretend that I didn’t care. Just like when my PlayStation didn’t work, and I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for the game to load. Trying the same tactic, I clenched my fists and mentally told the piece of paper I didn’t care. I was through caring, and the stupid thing could go away. Stubbornly, I sat with my arms folded, staring into the backs of my eyes, before deciding I had spent enough time ignoring the paper. Cracking one eye open, I expected to find the same blank piece of paper in front of me. However, this time the paper wasn’t blank. 

I was half aware of rivulets of sharp, startling red spotting pallid white.

“You’re in the special class!”  

Dad was right. Ignoring my own blood staining the collar of my shirt, and pooling on my desk, my own lips split into a grin.

It was trying too hard, trying to force it, that was stopping me from breaking through. Once I told everyone I could see the paper, I was let into this secret group they were all part of. This time I knew what they were doing. Our teacher told us to focus on a blank piece of paper, just like the one we had already been tested on, and then try and visualise certain things in front of us. They started off easy. A teddy bear. 

That was easy. I could visualise it perfectly, until I could reach out and touch its prickly fur. It felt real. Like I was touching a real stuffed toy. Then the images started to get blurry, and I lost track of the time. So did the sessions. I remembered the start of them, but time seemed to pass by quickly, and before I knew it, I was sitting in the back of dad’s car, trying to remember what I had been doing all afternoon. But I was still happy I broke through the barrier.

I did start getting nosebleeds a lot. Also, falling asleep and forgetting things. I remember sitting in front of the TV watching SpongeBob. But the next thing I knew I was halfway down our driveway, and dad’s hand was on my shoulder. “Mattie!” It was his third attempt at shouting my name, and finally his voice slid inside my brain. I awoke barefoot, my soles on prickly concrete which felt like an anchor, something I could hold onto. 

I wanted to tell dad about the sessions in class, but Mrs Teller had made us all extra promise not to tell our parents. Dad didn’t want to send me to school the morning after. He said I could stay home and watch cartoons. But I didn’t want to miss out on the extra class. So, despite feeling like poop, I insisted I was okay, and told him to drive me to school. Jack was standing outside, though his expression was scary. He didn’t look at me when I asked if he okay—and his nose was bleeding.

“Jack?” I prodded at my own face. “You’ve got red on you.” I giggled a little, hoping he would join in. “Ew! You’ve got red all over you!”

Again, he didn’t respond.

“Jack.” I shoved him, and he finally he turned to me. I expected him to at least hit me playfully.

Except he didn’t smile. Instead, Jack swiped at his nose, turned away from me, and strode into school, clutching his backpack.

When I followed him inside, Jack had stopped on the threshold. For the first time in a while, he looked confused, his gaze on our chaotic classroom. Pippa was standing on the desk waving her arms around laughing, and Evie was screaming at her to get down, the rest of the kids trying to get them to fight. For a moment I was confused why the classroom was so crazy, and then my gaze found the empty space where Mrs Teller should have been standing. Mrs Teller was never late. 

Jack found his desk quickly, and I followed, slumping into my own. I twisted around to ask Mara what was happening, before the door flew open, and to my shock, crashing into the wall. Mrs Teller stepped into the classroom, and immediately, Pippa hopped off the desk, and Evie slowly backed into her own before jumping into her seat, her eyes wide. Mrs Teller didn’t comment on the fighting. Instead, she strode to the front of the class without a word, picked up a whiteboard pen, and began to write with enough vigour to scare us into staying silent. She wrote one word in block capitals, spanning the entire board.

CHEATER.

When our teacher turned to us, I realised she didn’t look as tidy as usual. Mrs Teller was wearing the exact same pant suit from the day before, her usual ponytail falling out, tangled strands in her eyes. She hit the board three times, and we all jumped. “I would like you to tell me what a cheater is.” Her voice was different, low, a lot scarier. I had grown used to her laughter.

Now though, it was like looking at a different person. I could tell the others didn’t want to speak in fear of being shouted at, but Jack Torres was brave, no matter how scary our teacher was. Leaning back in his chair, he cleared his throat. “It’s an animal, right?” He said with a nervous giggle. “They like… run fast.”

We all jumped when she hit the board again.

“No!” Mrs Teller’s expression was fuming. “No, that is not what a cheater is.”

She turned back to the board. “A cheater is a lying son of a—” she caught herself when Evie giggled. “A lying person who I thought I loved.”

It took a moment for her to get a hold of herself, before turning her attention back to us. “I was supposed to give you your special class next week.,” Mrs Teller murmured. “But… there might not be a next week. I’m going to be fired, because he’s the head of my department, and I have been working on something I shouldn’t have.” She exhaled. “But look! They were wrong, weren’t they? They said it is impossible to train young children, and what am I doing?” She started to pace. 

“He said it was… it was morally wrong. That it went against protocol. That I would get in serious trouble and break protocol… but….” Mrs Teller looked me directly in the eye, her lips curving into a smile--  and my breakfast crept its way back up my throat. “Why would I waste it, hm?? Why would I waste weeks, no months, of training young minds for the exact purpose—”

She cut herself off, clawing at her hair. “I must be crazy.” Mrs Teller let out a hysterical laugh. “No! No, I am crazy.” I watched her pace back and forth, entranced by her movements. “I won’t get in trouble because I’m going to fucking die, but… but a group of eight year olds? Fifteen snot nosed little brats who I can prove have the potential to be something more…. by blowing his fucking head off. And his slut of a wife.”

One of the boy’s gasped, but Jack turned to shush him.

“Shh!” He giggled. “Mrs Teller has been drinking crazy juice.”

Turning to us, our teacher’s smile widened. But it was a smile I no longer trusted.

“Yes, Jack,” she said. “I have been drinking crazy juice. But do you know what you are?” Her erratic gaze flicked between all of us.

“What?” Pippa asked.

“Special.”

“What do you mean by special?” Evie spoke up. “Because my mommy said I’m the only special one here.”

Instead of answering, Mrs Teller spoke to all of us. “Who…” She let out a breathy laugh. “Who wants to watch TV?”

We watched TV. I wasn't sure what we were supposed to be watching. At first, I thought they were shapes we had to name. But then the shapes were growing bigger until they were almost as big as the screen. i remember lurching back in my chair, though I couldn't move. When I tried to move myself, or tear my gaze from the screen, I couldn't. The room was pitch black illuminating my face, before the shapes started to get smaller and then bigger, expanding and blowing up, a small red dot zigzagging from corner to corner. 

I followed it eagerly, motivated to watch it by my teacher's voice. And I did. I watched the red dot until it blossomed into sudden flickering images I couldn't keep track of.

I wanted to ask what they were, but my mouth didn't feel right. It felt like I was chewing on cotton candy. As the images flashed in front of my eyes, my thoughts grew dull and foggy, and I stopped thinking. I wanted to keep thinking.

I wanted to think about dad, and his new car, and that I was excited to visit mom's grave at the weekend-- but whatever had invaded my mind, bleeding into me, was stopping me from thinking. It had a hold of my body and wouldn't let go. I drifted, my eyes flickering, my mind feeling weird and cloudy. Before Mrs Teller was standing in front of the screen. In her hand was a picture of a man. "This is Thomas Haywood," she said. "Deputy head of my department. Now, I was supposed to be proving to him that I can in fact turn children into potential assets, but of course, he went back to his bitch of a wife." 

She laughed, and I was partially aware of my nose bleeding again, warm wetness dripping down my chin. "Now, I want you to look at this man and understand he is a bad man.” She waved the picture. “Do you understand me?  He is a bad man. And you are going to kill him."

There's a lot more to tell you, I'll be back tomorrow hopefully.
