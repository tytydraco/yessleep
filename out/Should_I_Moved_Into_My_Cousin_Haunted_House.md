So the apartment building I'm living in had to be evacuated due structural issue found that had been cause by a hurricane we had a few months back. 

Basically the whole building had to find temporary living well repairs are being done. Due to this being cause by a act of nature our landlord is not required to help us.


 I'm temporarily staying with a friend but it's only for a few days. 


I am currently looking for a long term temporary place to stay. But my option are limited because I don't have many family members here. My parents are in a assisted living community that doesn't allow long time guest and my sibling live in other states. I need to stay here for work.

The few friend I do have all already live in multiple people house hold and there just not room. 


The only one of knew who had room was one of my cousins we will call him Sam. Sam and his husband own a farm house not to far out of the town limits and would only be about a 30-40 min commute to work. So I called him ask if he be ok with me staying there. 

That when he started acting weird.. 

This was some of phone conversations 

Him: um I don't think you going want to stay here. 

Me: why 

Him: ok I'm going to tell you something and you can't laugh because it not funny

Me: what

Him: this place is haunted

Me: Sam come on.

Him: i am being seriously it haunted. Well actually its  just the masters bedroom 

Me; why do you think that. 


He goes on to explain that less then a week after moving in. Werid thing start happening but only in his master bedroom . Pretty much basically haunted house stuff. Moving object slamming doors and cabinets and lights turning on and off. 

But the scarest thing was that at night there would be a someone knocking on the cloest door from the inside. A loud knock.   That would last for a while. 

He even sent me a video of it (no I will not be sharing as it's not my video to share) 

This freak them and only a few months after moving in they decided they couldn't sleep in that room anymore. 

 Now the house had 2 room when they moved in a smaller room that felt more like a small office. and the master bedroom where the knocking happen.

Because of the weird stuff that went down in that room. 

Sam and his husband actually build a another bedroom onto there house. On the completely opposite side of the house. And slept in the small office room well it was being build. 


Now thing is  I'm a pretty big septic when it come to ghost stuff.  But the fact they actually built a whole new room make me think there something to thier story. 

Also I  know Sam and he is not the kind of guy to make this stuff up.

After he informed me on the happings 

He said I am feel to stay but that I have to stay in the small room as the old master room is now locked and no one is allow inside. 

He explain that after moving out they started hearing the knock on the other side of the bedroom door rather then the closet in the room. At which point they decide to permanently lock the door. 

He said that if that happens to just ignore it. 



So basically I am free to stay with them but apparently I have another roommate who may or may not be a evil spirit 


As a septic I wanted some advice from believers

So what do you think  should i move in (i kind of don't have a choose though)
