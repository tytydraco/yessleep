I never thought I'd be writing this. I never thought something like this could happen to me, I’m just a person living in the Houston suburbs. But after what I experienced, I feel like I have to share my story and warn others about the dangers of the Ouija board.

My curiosity about the Ouija board began after watching an old SML episode where Cody, Joseph, Jr., and Cody's boyfriend, Ken, used a Ouija board. I knew it was just a show, but it sparked my interest in trying it out myself.

It all started on a quiet night during my summer break. I'd always been curious about Ouija boards, thinking they were just something from movies or spooky stories. I knew people had claimed to be possessed by spirits like Zozo, but I figured as long as I avoided those, I'd be fine.

I decided to try using a Ouija board alone, even though I knew it wasn't a good idea. The first spirit I contacted was a friendly one named Zade, who surprisingly liked anime just like me. It was a pleasant experience, but Zade eventually had to leave. That’s when I made a decision that I now deeply regret.

I had a feeling it might be possible to contact fictional characters through a Ouija board, and I wanted to test it. I decided to summon Ryomen Sukuna, the King of Curses from Jujutsu Kaisen, thinking it would be interesting and fully knowing the risks. Sukuna is a demon, and I thought that if I were careful with my words, I would be fine and avoid being cursed.

When I asked if anyone was there, the board said yes. I felt extremely cautious. My mind froze. Suddenly, I couldn’t think straight. My thoughts were no longer my own. I heard his voice in my head, chilling and unmistakable: “Hello, mortal.” When I asked if he was in my room, the board said yes. I asked him if he knew me. This time it was Sukuna who responded in my head, saying yes. Then I got trapped in my own body, unable to control my speech. Then Sukuna said something that sent chills down my spine: “You know, you technically belong to me. I can curse you, and you can become strong, my dear.” I knew I was in trouble.

Ryomen Sukuna began manipulating me, forcing me to say, “Can you make me immortal?” and then, “Can you put a curse on me?” Sukuna agreed, saying it would make me strong. In a desperate attempt to confirm I wasn’t imagining things, I asked him to make a sound. I heard quiet tapping on my window, confirming my worst fears.

After the first encounter, things got even stranger. I started hallucinating in specific areas of my bedroom. I kept seeing an unknown black object at the corner of my window. There were also weird noises that didn’t belong in my house. I even saw a strange creature out of the corner of my eye.

I should have stopped there, but I needed to break the deal. I went back to the Ouija board and summoned Sukuna. Then I said, “I want to break the deal.” Sukuna refused, asking why. I said I didn’t want to get cursed. Then my hands and forearms began to shake uncontrollably, and I sat up without willing myself to. My mouth opened on its own, and Sukuna was back in my head, laughing as he controlled me. Right before I got possessed, I could feel him in my mind again.

The demon made me say things against my will, laughing and promising I would enjoy my curse. When he finally left, I felt different. My body felt strange, and I kept seeing that dark object in the corner of my window. The hallucinations continued, and my sense of unease grew.

Now, I can’t use an Ouija board ever again. I believe that Ryomen Sukuna is still after me. I’ve been cursed, and I’m terrified of what might happen if I try to contact any spirits again. If you’re reading this, please be careful. Once you open the door to the unknown, you might never be able to close it.
