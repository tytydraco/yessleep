Caller: "I planned on, like, going out, not being stuck in my fucking apartment all night."

Dispatcher: "I'll send someone to take a look, can I get your address and apartment number?"

Caller: "The Argent Apartment's, we're in apartment 303."

Dispatcher: "You said "we're," can you tell me the names of who is with you inside the apartment?"

Caller: "I'm Jessica Sanders, my roommate is Helen Varquez. There's like... my dog, Penny, and the repair guy fixing my sink." (caller identifies herself, as well as her roommate)

Dispatcher: "Alright Jessica, can you describe exactly what the man outside your apartment is doing? Are you in any way actively being threatened by him?"

Jessica Sanders: "Like, he's creepy as hell! He's like, holding a beer bottle in his hand, and he's sitting like, against the wall opposite my door."

Dispatcher: "Jessica, if he's not actively doing anything, I'm not entirely sure we can do anything."

Dispatcher: "Does the man actually live in the apartment building?"

Jessica Sanders: "Ew, no. This guy looks broke as hell, there's no way he could live here."

Caller: "I mean like, he's just sitting there, staring at the bottom of the door."

Dispatcher: "Can you describe the man to me? What he's wearing, hair color, race, etcetera."

Jessica Sanders: "I'm looking through my peephole, he's got like, a grey hat on, dark green coat, grey hoodie, some raggedy ass jeans, and running shoes."

Jessica Sanders: "He's white, I can't see his eyes, or his hair under his hat."

Jessica Sanders: "Holy shit... he's like, literally bleeding. Like, like I can see it under his coat, his shirt's all red."

Dispatcher: "Bleeding? Can you tell what is causing this?"

Dispatcher: "Can you go out there and go see if he's alright, if you feel safe doing so?"

Jessica Sanders: "Uhm, fuck to the no! I ain't going close to this guy. He's gonna like, fucking mug me or some shit."

Jessica Sanders: (heard in background) "Helen! Get the hell out here and see this shit!" (laughing heard in background, from Jessica Sanders)

Jessica Sanders: (heard in background) “Bring your phone, we gotta post this crazy ass shit!” (laughing continues from Jessica Sanders)

Jessica Sanders: (heard in background) "Helen! Oh my god, what the fuck are you even doing? Get over here!"

Dispatcher: "Jessica, the man could be severely injured, paramedics are already on the way, but it would be seriously beneficial if you'd go check on the man."

Jessica Sanders: "Like, give me a second."

Jessica Sanders: (shuffling heard, floorboards creaking heard, knocking heard) "Helen! Open the hell up, there's some creepy ass guy bleeding out outside!"

Jessica Sanders: "I'm coming in, god, Helen, you slow ass bitch!"

Dispatcher: "Jessica, you need to focus on the task at hand-" (interrupted)

Jessica Sanders: (sound of door opening) "Helen, you-"

Jessica Sanders: "H- Helen?"

Jessica Sanders: "\[Helen!\] (yelled) Helen, wake the fuck up!"

Dispatcher: "Jessica, what's happening, talk to me."

Jessica Sanders: (heard in background) "What the fuck are you doing just standing there? Help me the fuck out!"

Jessica Sanders: "Wha- G- Get help, what are you doing!?" (panic and fear could be verbally heard in voice)

Jessica Sanders: "Go get help! You and the entire working class is fucking stupid as hell!" (fear turned to anger)

Dispatcher: "Jessica, are you and Helen alright? You gotta talk to me."

Jessica Sanders: (ignored) "Drop that damn toolbox, and help me the fuck out!"

Jessica Sanders: "W- What the fuck are you doing? Get the hell away from me!"

Unknown: "Beauty's on the inside, Jessica. I'll show you."

(Jessica Sanders lets out a quick inhale of breath, before something hits the ground. Heavy breathing can be heard in the background.)

Dispatcher: "Jessica, you've gotta talk to me, is there someone inside your apartment? Do you need me to send police aswell? EMT's are less than two minutes o-"

**Call Two - Disconnected - Ended at: 10:49 PM**

*Paramedics Matthew Vasquez and Serena Victor arrived at the scene at approximately 10:52 PM, they ended up at the actual apartment itself at around 10:56, after getting confused with directions given by the doorman at the front of the building. Once arriving at the door, the paramedics knocked multiple times on the door, to no one answering. Paramedics Vasquez and Victor, aswell as 911 operator Janelle Sinclaire later ruled the call to be a fake call, a hoax. As Vasquez and Victor left the premises, they found a man fallen on the floor in-between the doorway of a supply closet, naked, besides his boxers, socks, and shoes. The man was later identified as Allen Fayette, the apartment buildings head custodian and repair man. After waking up mid-ambulance ride, he reports that he must've fallen and hit his head but was unsure of why his keys to the building, work clothes, and toolbox were missing. The next day, Allen Fayette's drug results came back at Josephine Hospital, remnants of chloroform* *were found still inside his system.*

Mid-recording session, a famous true-crime podcast host calls Branchview 911, reporting a third "seriously persistent" cyber-stalker at her building, the Argent Apartment Complex.

The transcript to that call is located below.
