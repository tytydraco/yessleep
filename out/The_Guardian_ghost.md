It wasn’t particularly tragic. Or unusual. Just a car accident. 

I don’t blame the man who hit me. He was speeding because his wife was in labor, and there was black ice on the road. He lost control of the car, and I lost my life. 

It’s not his fault. I know that. I’m not cruel. I’m not vengeful.

If anything, I’m the opposite.

When it happened, I didn’t have anyone left. My family had all passed on, and my friends—well, they had drifted away in those last few years. We had little in common by the end. So, when it came time for my funeral, the only people who showed up were my boss and the family who killed me. The man who hit me stood quietly, his arm around his wife, who was holding their newborn daughter close to her chest. 

I *hated* my boss. The man had never appreciated me, never cared for what I did. I wasn’t even sure why he came to the funeral. And as I stood there, or at least the version of me that was left—some echo of a soul, a fragment that lingered—I realized how empty it all felt. The cemetery, the gravestones, the biting wind. There was no warmth in it, no place for me there.

So, I followed them home. 

It wasn’t planned, really. I just didn’t want to stay behind, surrounded by nothing. When they got into their car and drove off, I followed without thinking. The woman, Lori, cradled her newborn daughter, Lily. I watched her as they entered the house, saw how she and Jack struggled to adjust to their new life as parents. I hovered, an invisible presence, just watching at first.

Lily may as well have been my own flesh and blood. She was sweet, and bright, and oh so very small. She had trouble sleeping unless someone was rocking her crib, and her parents were exhausted. Lori and Jack would collapse into bed after long days, worn out and overwhelmed.

That’s when I started to help.

It was easy for me to rock the crib. I didn’t get tired. I didn’t need to sleep. And, after all, they couldn’t see me. I was just… there. So, every night, I rocked Lily to sleep, keeping her calm and quiet while her parents rested.

As the years passed, things shifted. Jack and Lori began to notice little things—the way the air felt cooler in certain rooms, the faint creaks of movement when no one was there. It didn’t take them long to connect the dots. They remembered the accident, remembered me. And they realized that I hadn’t left.

But they weren’t afraid of me. I wasn’t angry or malevolent. I was a quiet, helpful presence. So, instead of fearing me, they accepted me. They even began to include me in their lives. Every year, on the anniversary of my death, they’d light candles in the house, like a small ritual in my honor. During family meals and holidays, they’d set an empty chair for me at the table. It was a small gesture, but it made me feel like I belonged—like I was truly part of the family.

For the first time in my afterlife, I wasn’t alone.

Years passed this way, with me quietly protecting and caring for my new family. Jack, Lori, and Lily—they were mine now. I was bound to them, and I watched over them in ways they couldn’t fully understand.

But tonight, something has changed.

I feel it in the air before I see it. A tension, a pressure. Someone is outside, trying to force the door open. The sound of it makes the hair on the back of my neck stand on end—or at least it would, if I had any hair left. 

It’s Lori’s ex. I’ve seen him before—heard them talk about him in hushed tones. He’s obsessive, possessive. He’s angry tonight. I can feel the rage radiating off him like a furnace, and I know that if he gets inside, he’s going to hurt them. He’s going to hurt *my family.*

That’s when I remember something. The thing about ghosts, you see, is that the more offerings you receive, the stronger you become. Jack and Lori have been lighting candles for me, leaving small tokens, even the occasional bit of food. All of it adds up. I’ve been growing stronger, more connected to this world. I may be dead, but I’m not powerless. Not anymore.

As I focus, I feel the weight of something cold and solid in my hand. A knife, pulled from the kitchen counter without a second thought. It feels warm, almost alive, against the icy chill of my skin. 

The ex is still struggling with the door, his heavy footsteps shuffling outside. Jack is upstairs with Lily, but Lori is downstairs, closer to danger. I can sense her fear, her heart racing as she tries to stay quiet. 

But I’m not going to let him hurt her. I won’t let him hurt any of them.

The door finally bursts open, and he steps inside, his breath heavy with anger and alcohol. His eyes scan the room, and I watch as he takes a step toward Lori, a twisted smile on his face.

Before he can make it any farther, I’m there. The knife in my hand feels almost like an extension of my will, and in one fluid motion, I drive it into his chest. His eyes widen, shock and confusion flashing across his face as he stumbles back, clutching the wound.

He falls to the floor, gasping, and I stand over him, watching as his life drains away.

Lori, Jack, and Lily are my family now. I care about them. And I won’t let anyone take them from me.

Not yet.
