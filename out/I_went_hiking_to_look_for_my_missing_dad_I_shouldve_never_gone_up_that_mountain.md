My father and I loved hiking. Not the casual kind — the kind where the air thins, where the wind feels like knives, and every step burns. He used to say the cold “washed the noise off his mind.”
I never understood that until I was older.

That day was supposed to be one of those days.

We had a cabin we always used as a starting point. Same place every time. Same routine. Coffee. Map check. Climb.

But when I got there, he wasn’t.

At first, I didn’t panic. The road up the mountain gets icy, and the forest can swallow sound. I figured he got held up. But an hour passed. Then two.

I called him. No answer. I called again. Nothing.

My father was a serious man — scheduled, strict, always early. His missing a planned hike wasn’t just unlike him. It was impossible.

I stayed in that cabin for six days.

I must’ve called his phone seven times a day. Eventually, I realized I wasn’t calling to reach him — I was calling just to hear the ringing. If the line was still live, then maybe he was too.

I should’ve called 911 immediately. But fear makes you stupid. Fear makes you small.

So I did the only thing that felt real:
I followed the plan.

I went to the mountain.
I started climbing.

Something was wrong the moment I stepped onto the trail.

The air wasn’t just cold — it was dead.
No birds. No insects. No rustling leaves. Just the crunch of frost under my boots. The world felt like it was holding its breath.

Halfway up, the sun slipped behind the ridge. The trees stretched long, thin shadows across the path. Everything dimmed.

I checked my watch — too late to keep going. I found a flat ledge near a stone outcrop and set up camp.

That’s when I found the first bone.

Not small. Not an animal. Something long. Thick. Snapped clean down the center. The marrow was hollowed out. The white is stained, brown, and flaking.

Something had eaten it.

Recently.

The bone was still wet.

My chest tightened. It looked human.

But it couldn’t be.
My father was strong. Unbreakable.

“What did you get yourself into, Dad?”

Sleep never came. Every time I shut my eyes, I saw his breath in the cold. Heard him laughing on the trail. And beneath that memory: something hungry. Something waiting.

Then I heard it.

Movement in the brush. Slow at first. Then heavier. Closer.

Then his voice.

“Son… I’ve been waiting up here. Took your sweet time.”

For a moment, I almost unzipped the tent. But the voice was off — too loose, too soft. My father always spoke like he was cutting through stone.
This voice sagged. Melted.

I unzipped the tent just an inch.

A figure stood in the dark. Wrong size. Wrong shape. A foot too tall. Limbs too long. And above its shoulders —

A deer skull.

Before I could react, something slashed. The tent tore open. Claws ripped across my arm. I felt blood soak into my sleeve, hot against the cold air. I screamed and threw myself out onto the frozen ground.

I ran — blind, panicked — feet pounding the trail, breath burning my throat.

I didn’t realize I was running up the mountain, not down, until the trees thinned and cold stars opened overhead.

The summit.

I was bleeding. Dizzy. No cover. No way to hide.

Then I heard it again.

“Son…”

It stepped into view.

A towering, skeletal body. Skin stretched thin over bone. A massive deer skull for a head, antlers branching like black lightning. But its mouth — too human — moved beneath the bone.

“You shouldn’t have run. I’m hungrier now.”

It charged.

I curled up, arms over my head, bracing for the strike.

But when it hit me, it didn’t break me. I was heavier than expected. I felt it lose footing. Saw the antlers tilt. Claws scraping rock. Then —

It fell.

I heard it tumbling. Branches snapping. Stone cracking. Then silence.

I never checked if it survived.

I just kept walking until I saw headlights. A ranger’s truck. A real voice.

I never saw my father again.

I still hike. It’s the only place I feel close to him. But I won’t go back to that mountain.

Not yet.

Maybe one day, when I’m ready, I’ll go back and talk to him.
