I've always taken breathing for granted. It's something we do without even thinking about it, a natural process that's essential to our survival. But what if I told you that I've lost control of my breathing? That I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of inhaling and exhaling, with no escape in sight?

It started a few days ago, when I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like I couldn't catch my breath. I sat up in bed, gasping for air, and tried to calm myself down. But the more I tried to relax, the more my breathing seemed to accelerate. It was like my body had developed a mind of its own, and it was determined to suck in as much oxygen as possible.

At first, I thought it was just anxiety. I've always been a bit of a worrier, and I figured that this was just my body's way of reacting to stress. But as the days went by, my breathing didn't slow down. If anything, it got worse. I found myself breathing rapidly, even when I was sitting still or sleeping. It was like my body was constantly on high alert, preparing for some unknown threat.

I tried to see a doctor, but they couldn't find anything wrong with me. They ran test after test, but my lungs were clear, my heart was healthy, and my brain was functioning normally. It was like I was a medical mystery, a puzzle that no one could solve.

As the days turned into weeks, I started to feel like I was losing my mind. I couldn't concentrate, I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't even enjoy the simple things in life. Every moment was consumed by my breathing, which had become a constant, maddening presence in my life.

I started to feel like I was drowning in air. Every breath was a struggle, every inhale a desperate gasp for oxygen. I felt like I was suffocating, even when I was surrounded by fresh air.

And then, the nightmares started. I would dream that I was trapped in a tiny room, with no air to breathe. I would dream that I was drowning in a sea of oxygen, unable to escape. I would dream that my lungs were collapsing, that my body was shutting down.

The nightmares were so real, so vivid, that I would wake up gasping for air. And even when I was awake, the feeling of suffocation wouldn't go away. It was like my body was constantly trying to tell me something, but I couldn't quite decipher the message.

As the weeks turned into months, I started to feel like I was losing myself. I was no longer the person I used to be, the person who could breathe easily and live life without a care. I was a shadow of my former self, a mere specter of the person I once was.

And then, one night, I had a realization. I was lying in bed, gasping for air, when I suddenly felt a presence in the room. It was like someone was standing over me, watching me, waiting for me to...

To what? I didn't know. But as I looked around the room, I saw something that made my blood run cold. On the wall, in letters that seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy, was a single word: "Breathe."

I knew then that I was in the grip of something sinister, something that was using my body against me. I knew that I had to escape, to find a way out of this living nightmare.

But as I tried to sit up, to throw off the covers and make a run for it, I realized that I was trapped. My body was frozen in place, unable to move, unable to escape.

And as I lay there, gasping for air, I knew that I was doomed. I was trapped in a never-ending cycle of breathing, with no escape in sight.

The last thing I remember is the sound of my own breathing, echoing in my ears like a mantra. And then, everything went black.

When I came to, I was in a hospital bed, surrounded by doctors and nurses. They told me that I had been in a coma for weeks, that my body had been in a state of hyperarousal, constantly breathing, constantly gasping for air.

They told me that they had no idea what had caused it, that it was a medical mystery. But as I lay there, listening to their words, I knew the truth.

I had been possessed by something sinister, something that had used my body against me. And even though I was awake now, even though I was breathing easily, I knew that I would never be the same again.

The experience had left me changed, had left me with a deep and abiding fear of my own body. I knew that I would never take breathing for granted again, that I would always be aware of the delicate balance between life and death.

And as I lay there, surrounded by the beeping of machines.
