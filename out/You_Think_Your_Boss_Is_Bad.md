The community center is filled with cigarette smoke, everyone here sits in a circle of chairs to complain about their bosses. How they get called to come into work even though they were approved the time off months ago, how they get screwed out of that holiday bonus or maternity care and more. 

I don't say anything when I come here. I sit quietly, listen and think about how I got where I am. When it's my turn to talk, I pass. It's not like I am going to say these people have it easier than I do.

My story started in my sophomore year of college and during that time I didn't have many options in way of employment. The few people who were willing to work around my classes already had enough workers and were not hiring. Thankfully there were plenty of odd jobs listed on the cork boards scattered around campus. Most of them didn't pay much and only required a few hours of your time, but the pay was better than nothing and I would rather eat ramen everyday for a month then nothing at all. 

Unfortunately lots of people were in the same boat, so all these jobs were first come first serve.

Eventually I found one asking for a ‘handyman’. I don't know my way around tools but I was young and dumb enough to justify that with the aid of a good Youtube tutorial I could easily learn how to install a sink or change the oil in a car. 

When I arrived for my first day, my initial impression of Professor Borgeson was that he didn't look like a professor at all. He was tall but very thin. His hair was dark but there was some gray at the temples, making him look older than he was. If I had to guess, he was in his early thirties. He explained that the job would be easy and the first thing I would have to do would be reminding him to eat. 

I found this funny and smiled but he was serious. He then explained that he often gets lost in his work and forgets little things like that. 

When he told me the pay, I accepted the job. 

To begin everyday I would brew his coffee in a pot, which he would serve himself. Thankfully my classes were close so this never interfered with my days. I would do this again between two and four in the afternoon each day as well. The second time I went to his office I would call restaurants and either have them deliver to him or pick up something for him to eat. In less than a week he told me to keep the coffee coming, but didnt need me to order food everyday. 

After a few months he started to tell me to do things that made me nervous. At first it was things like grabbing a file from some office but would escalate to picking up packages in weird and occasionally terrifying places. 

Before long he had me taking chemicals out of the lab without the proper paperwork. Each time I approached him about this he would say that everything was above board and not to worry about it.

When the chem labs treated the chemicals I took as though they were stolen I went to Borgenson and told him about it, begging him to clear things up. That was when I learned that Borgenson was using this information to blackmail me. 

As horrible as he was, he was not completely unsympathetic to my situation and agreed to give me college credits if I kept doing the jobs he asked me to do. 

I didn't have a choice. At this point he had enough information to get me expelled from school, so I continued to work for him. Besides, who would the police be more likely to believe? Me, or a man who was up for an award in excellence in laboratory science for his neurological research?

After that I stole copper wire for him. He required so much that I was at this for months. Sometimes the buildings I stole from were being developed, other times it was someone's home who happened to be gone for the holidays. 

I tried to ask him what kind of experiment he was working on, but everytime I asked he would fly into a fit of rage and frustration, complaining about how hard the work he was doing really was and that he didn't have time to go into details because “it would surely go over your head.”

In my junior year he started using me as an alibi, either to get out of some kind of trouble or as an excuse so he could leave and return to his secretive experiments. Every time he would have me meet someone he would coach me on what to say and when to say them. 

I am abruptly taken out of my thoughts when the next person in the support group starts talking. I’m only half paying attention. I’m thinking about Borgeson and staring at the same three triangles on the floor. I hear her say something about compensation for driving. 

There is the slightest smile on my face when I hear this because I wish I had this woman's troubles. 

At least Borgeson gave me a truck and refunded me on the gas I used when I drove around, picking up the freshest roadkill I could find.

During my senior year I learned about professor Boregeson's connection with some people in the school's zoology department. I discovered this when I actually had the official paperwork to pick up the bodies of howler monkeys and the body of a Bonobo ape. 

I had been to his house a few times, but the first time I was allowed inside was right before a hurricane was about to make landfall. I thought I was called to help him prepare his home for the rain but instead it was to do something I could not have been prepared for. It smelt of the same chemicals that I had stolen for him and a coppery smell that was not unlike the scent of blood.

In his upstairs bedroom was a makeshift lab, and in it was the body of a huge and hideous creature strapped to a table and submerged in ice. It was hard to see the body, but to me it was as though he stitched bodies together.

Borgeson was in a rush and was in no mood to answer my questions. He needed to do this experiment before the storm hit and since he still had all the blackmail material over my head, I did too.

After hours of telling me to flip a switch here or press a button there, the hurricane was right on top of us. I wanted to stop but Borgeson insisted that we kept at it, that it was now or never. 

I was terrified as the gale force winds broke the windows. Borgeson had to yell over it for me to hear his instructions, but eventually we gave this creature a pulse.

Since we were on the second floor and the hurricane was tearing the house apart all around us, we had to bring this unconscious body down to the main floor, where Borgeson converted a small room into a cage.

Borgeson and I were barely able to get to his basement by the time the hurricane tore the house apart. As the water rose and the violent sound of wind filled my ears I prayed that I would get out of this. Borgeson on the other hand was only concerned about the thing he created. 

When it was all over and the hurricane had passed, we discovered the body of the creature was crushed and died.

There is supportive clapping when the last speaker is done telling their story. I clap along and when it's the next person's turn to speak, I keep my chin to my chest and return to my thoughts. 

The next person complains about unpaid wages but I can't relate to that. Borgeson was many things, but he was not a wage thief and paid me for everything I did.

Disgruntled by the loss of his creature, Borgeson left me alone and I was able to focus on my studies. The rare times I saw him was when I prepared him coffee. It was during one of the times that he told me that since I was a senior and wouldn't be around forever, he was searching for a new assistant.

After telling me this he solemnly shook my hand and gave me my last payment, with a generous bonus, especially for someone in my financial situation.

I couldn't have been happier. Not because of the money, but because I was finally free of the man who I learned to hate with every fiber of my being.

I would soon graduate and move back to my hometown, where I would spend ten years repressing the memories of professor Borgeson. 

A man in the group who goes by the name Barry is the next to speak. He complains about his boss calling him into work on his pre approved days off. I feel for him because in a weird way I can relate.

I thought that I was done with Borgeson, but then one night a stranger came to Moe's Bar, my place of employment. He seemed friendly and even though he did not look familiar, I saw something in his eyes that reminded me of what I’d seen in the mirror after a night doing Borgeson's bidding. 

Once the bar flies started making their way out, this stranger confessed that he was the newest assistant to Borgeson and the only reason he was in Moe's Bar was because Borgeson was in town and needed my help. 

I refused but then the stranger told me that Borgeson still had the blackmail material and if I didn't come along with him, Borgeson was going to use it against me. 

When Barry wraps up his story, everyone claps and it snaps me out of my memories and returns me to the present. 

It's my turn to speak. 

I’ve been coming to this support group for a long time but I've never said more than two words. After all, what can I say? That if I could I would trade positions with any of these people? That they should get on their knees and thank their lucky stars for not having bosses that blackmail them? That Borgeson still forces me to do things for him, like stealing bodies from the morgue? 

There is only one answer I can come up with.
