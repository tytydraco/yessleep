I was eight years old when my parents took me to the house in the woods and told me I was one of the favoured.

They told me I had a gift and that gifts were painful things. My mother knelt in front of me, held my face between her hands, and said that I must not be afraid when it hurt, because fear was how weakness entered the body. I remember believing that if she was there then it would be all right, that she would stop it if it became too much.

The purgations began with endurance. They bound my arms above my head with rough rope that bit into my wrists as it tightened, lifting me until my toes barely brushed the floor. When I cried and asked them to let me down, the my uncle leaned in and whispered that this was how the gift was opened, that the body had to be emptied before it could be filled. My father stood behind him and said, calmly and without hesitation, that I must listen carefully, because this was important, because this was bigger than pain, bigger than childhood, bigger than me.

I begged my mother to untie me, told her my arms were burning, told her I could not feel my fingers anymore, and she smiled in that careful, instructive way she used when correcting me and said that numbness was good. Numbness meant the body was learning obedience, and when I screamed she told me not to shame her and make them doubt me at such a crucial moment.

They let me down only when I collapsed, and even then they spoke of it as mercy, and my uncle traced the deep rope marks on my wrists and said that next time I must last longer, that the forest had been listening and patience was expected, and my parents nodded as though this were an entirely reasonable expectation to place on a child.

They made me eat roots that burned my throat, insects that writhed under my teeth, meat I could not recognise, and when I could not swallow, when I gagged and cried, my father lifted the cup again and said it was necessary, that my suffering would bring us salvation, and I cried out for him to stop, for him to remember me, and he shook his head and told me I must endure, and I wanted to scream at the world that I had parents and they had abandoned me, that I was a child and they were meant to protect me, and yet they did not, and I learned then that their devotion was stronger than any love they might have had for me. He pressed the bowl closer and said softly that every favoured child reached this moment, that this was when most of them failed, and that I did not want to disappoint everyone now that we had come so far.

I told them I did not want to be favoured anymore, that I wanted to go home, and my mother brushed my hair back and said it was too late. We’ve already started. She said that home was wherever the gift was honoured, that wanting to leave was the voice of corruption, and that if I truly loved them I would never speak like that again.

The cutting purgations were done slowly and carefully, always framed as instruction rather than punishment, and they placed the knife in my hand and guided my fingers as though teaching me to write, telling me exactly where to press and how deep, and when I hesitated, my uncle sighed and said that hesitation was selfishness, that every second I delayed was another second the world remained broken, and my father told me, very calmly, that one more cut would be enough, that I was so close now, that I must not stop when I was finally proving myself.

I cried and told my mother I could not do it, that it hurt too much, and she told me that pain was only the body lying to protect itself, that I had to think beyond blood and skin, and when I searched her face for doubt or fear or anything human at all I saw only devotion, complete and unmoving, and I understood then that whatever she had been before was gone.

When the purgations failed to produce what they wanted, they did not rage or strike me, which would have been easier to understand, but instead they spoke of disappointment as though it were something I had created, something shameful and foul, and the elders murmured that they had hoped for more while my parents apologised to them for me, explaining that I had always been slow, always been fragile, always been difficult to shape.

My uncle spoke against them. My parents answered back, each pointing to the other, each insisting the failure was not theirs but mine. My mother spoke of my weakness as though it were evidence, as though it absolved her, and my uncle asked how she could have made me like this, and the words hung between them, sharp and empty, while I listened and felt the weight of all of it pressing down.

I did not understand, so I ran into the forest and fell and lay there sobbing, believing for a moment that if I stayed quiet enough, they may forget about me and leave me there, but I heard my father calling my name in that patient voice he used when explaining something obvious, telling me that running was another failure, that each step away from the house made the purgations worse, and when they brought me back my mother held my face and told me I had frightened her, that favoured children who tried to escape often did not return at all. She cried and sobbed. I don’t know why.

Years later, when I was grown and the house was gone and the forest had been cut back and the cult spoken of only in rumours, I sought my mother out because I believed that time might have loosened her devotion, because I believed that if I could explain what it felt like, what it did to me, she might finally see it. We sat across from each other at a small table, and she looked older but unchanged, and I tried to speak, tried to tell her about the fear, the pain, the way my body learned terror before it learned language, but the words would not form, because every sentence turned inward, every accusation collapsed, every thought curdled into guilt before it reached my mouth.

I opened my mouth and nothing came out, and my chest tightened and my hands began to shake, and I realised with a kind of distant horror that I could not speak against her at all, that something in me still knew better, still knew the cost, and I began to sob loudly.

She watched me for a moment with an expression I could not place, perhaps confusion, and then into disgust. She stood without saying a word, gathered her coat, and left, and I knew as she walked away that she had never doubted a single thing they did to me, that my suffering had meant nothing to her except as evidence of my failure.

I am thirty-two now, and I live far from that place, and yet I wake with scars aching as though they are fresh, with bruises I cannot explain, with the sense that my body is still being measured and found wanting. I live with the knowledge that if I were eight again, crying and begging, my parents would look at me with the same calm devotion and tell me, gently and sincerely, that I must endure just a little longer, that one more cut would be enough, that the gift demanded it.
