I don’t know when this story is going to end but I can tell you where it started. The phone
rings. “Oh, hey Dan. I didn't expect you to call. What'cha want?” “Hey, did you see that they
were gonna tear down that old arcade on highway 72?”“Yeah, what about it?” “Well, I’ve always
wanted to go down there and look around. It’s been abandoned for 30 years.” “I assume you
want me to go with you.” “Exactly.” “I don’t know, could be some crazy hobo living in there.”
“You’re such a chicken Sam!” “Well last time, you wanted to fly out to Area 51.” “Please, will you
just do something with me just this one time?” “Fine.” “Arcade at 10:00 am tomorrow.”


I went downstairs the next morning. I wasn’t going to take any chances here. I packed a
backpack with a multi-tool, a bottle of water, a few granola bars, a flashlight, and a camera. I
drive over and Dan is waiting outside. “What’s that backpack for? We’re only gonna be in there
for a few minutes.” “Knowing you, a few minutes will be more like a few hours.” “Fine. Let’s go
inside.” We go in and it looks like a regular arcade, except for the fact it was abandoned.
Carpeted floors, starry looking wallpaper, and that office ceiling that looks like cardboard. A thick
layer of dust covered just about everything. “What was that? It sounded like something in the
ceiling.” “Chill, it's probably a rat.” “No, it was way bigger than a rat.” “Scaredy cat.”


Well 45 minutes go by, and we are approaching the doorway to the last room. The
storage room. I screamed and then stopped short when I saw what it was. “Oh. It's..just an old
animatronic.” “How did you get scared of this thing? It just looks like a slot machine with limbs.”
“I think the slots are its eyes and that thing on the side of its head is the handle.” “Ya’ think,
sherlock?” “Yeah, actually.” It was sitting on top of a box, permanently hunched over while one
of its spider-like arms waved at whoever happened to be looking at it. It was wearing a clown
looking suit with a party hat on top of it’s creepy, round, permanently smiling face. We started to
walk out when it came to life. “I’m Mister Sullivan Slots! Would you like to try? Just one quarter!”
it said in a glitched, high pitched voice. We both whirled around to look at it.


It was now standing straight up, one arm waving, and the other pointing at its mouth,
which was wide open with writing on the tongue saying “Insert one quarter.”. “Ew, that's weird.”
“You’re not going to question how it turned on?” I really wanted to get out of there now. “No, it
probably was motion activated.” “Alright, but let's go.” “Fine.” Just as we were about to walk out
of the arcade, something shuffled in the ceiling. “What was that?” “The same noise I heard
earlier.”


Then, suddenly Mr. Slots swung from the outside of the building and landed. Right in
front of us. “Not so fast!” in the same, slightly horse, high pitched tone. We both screamed. We
just ran, in a panic, not thinking. It began to weave in and out of the ceiling tiles. I suddenly
remembered my backpack. While running, I dug out the multi-tool. I turned around and chucked
it at it, trying to slow it down. It hit. Its head swiveled around rapidly, when it stopped its eyes
spun back in its head. Dan and I both stopped to see what it was doing.


 Its eyes stoppedspinning and what was once coins for pupils were now skulls. “That's not very nice.” The voicenow slowed, and much deeper. We ran but it was faster.The arcade became a labyrinth. There was no exit. No escape. No hope. I don’t know
how long we ran but we eventually came to a dead end. There was a pit of darkness right in
front of us. I turned to face it. While it was focused on me, Dan ran. But there is no escape for
him. I know it. “Bye bye.” It’s voice was now more hushed but still slowed. I stumbled. I fell.


To whoever may find this, I assure you I will not make it out alive. I have been recording
this hoping that someone would find the camera. I knew something would go wrong. I have
been falling for two hours and telling my camera the story. I can see the ground finally
approaching. It looks like… grass and… a house? Wha-
