I know it sounds crazy. Believe me, at first, I myself didn’t want to accept it. After the recent events, I have come to the conclusion that the neighbor’s dog, if you can even call it a dog, has been stalking me since I’ve moved into my apartment. 

I’ve run into the neighbor walking Shaggy, his 4 year old barbet, while going on jogs, and I didn’t question anything at first. Shaggy seemed super friendly and was super cordial to my doberman whenever I bring her on my runs. I hadn’t noticed it at first, but the more time I spent in the apartment, it became more apparent.

The first incident with Shaggy was after I had come back from a run and wanted to shower before making myself dinner. I walked out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel, when out of the corner of my eyes, I saw Shaggy next to the window of his apartment staring at me through a small gap in my curtains. His paws were outstretched on the windowsill as if he were standing. His eyes looked more beady than usual, and his gaze never left my stature. I called to him in the highest pitch my voice could make, but he didn’t budge. Unnerved, I closed and locked the window and closed the curtain completely, but I could still feel his eyes on me.

Another incident happened while I was walking home from the gym with my dog. I had my headphones on and was just trying to enjoy the calmness of solitude, when my dog started growling and getting territorial. Naturally, I looked behind me in case I was being followed. When I turned back, I was met with Shaggy, but he looked different from when I first met him. His fur was a bit darker and covered most of his face. His eyes were still partially visible, and they looked like a human’s eyes, as if there was a person inside him. Shaggy’s facial expression hardened like he was trying to squint his eyes. My dog grew more aggressive each second of being there. I tried to calm her down, but there was nothing I could do. From his apartment building, the neighbor shouted down for Shaggy. The dog looked up, then back to me, huffed, and started walking up the stairs and into the neighbor’s house. Since this incident, everywhere I go, I see Shaggy’s human-like face peeking at me from around corners. 

I don’t know for sure why Shaggy’s doing this, but I’m pretty certain he isn’t actually a dog. I’ve tried to get in contact with the apartment owners, as well as the past residents of my specific apartment. I heard they left suddenly with no explanation, so I’ve done my digging and have sent them emails asking for more information. I’m very distraught and have been debating whether to get the police involved. I’ll update as soon as I get a response from the previous residents, or if I have another encounter with Shaggy.
