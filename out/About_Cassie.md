This is a story I’ve put together in bits and pieces. It’s my sister’s story, though I suppose it’s also mine - after all, we all play a part in the destruction of those whom the world has beaten down. 

My sister Cassie was different. There were no other words to describe it then. She seemed at odds with life, and life seemed at odds with her. Maybe part of the trouble was our isolation - that’s what everyone used to say. We lived out in the country, on our grandmother’s farm. Don’t ask me about our parents. I don’t remember much about them, but I do know they didn’t deserve to be called “mother” and “father.” In those days I was silent, often sullen. Cassie, too, spoke very little. And yet, there were these rages. When Cassie raged, she was unrecognizable and inconsolable. She could destroy everything in her path, then retreat to somewhere deep inside herself that could never be reached. I won’t trouble you with details. I will only say that my grandmother was badly hurt one day. When she went to the hospital, some well-meaning nurse called the authorities. And of course, Cassie went to the Institute not long after.

Defiant and uncooperative. Responds inconsistently to simple questions. Probable mental deficiency, needs continuing psychiatric assessment.

These are the first notes in Cassie’s file, dating from the day of her admission. There is a picture, too. Cassie staring like a trapped animal. I won’t go on.

My grandmother never visited Cassie. I went whenever I could, alone. At first, no one would let me see her. They told me I was too young, that Cassie needed time to adjust. I kept coming back, and one day, they gave in. Cassie ran to me and I held her like a mother. God knows she needed one. She hated it here, she wanted to go home. She had no home to welcome her. When I tried to leave, she threw herself on the floor, hit her head against the hard tiles. Rough hands pinned down her arms, strong bodies restrained her body. Then a needle in her thigh, and she was carried away. “You’re a bad influence on the patient, Miss Mason” said a man in a white coat. Did he know her name?

Psychiatric treatment continues. Onset of puberty has led to deviant behaviour and increased defiance. Patient is extremely resistant to medication. Rarely calm, highly volatile in interactions with others.

When Cassie first came to the Institute, they promised that she would continue going to school. She remembers no schooling during her time there. Only the day room, the dormitory and sometimes the laundry room - and then the shouts, the restraints, the sharp needle, and nothing.  I was 18 when they told me she was being moved to a locked ward. She needed a “higher standard of care.” Visits to this ward were rarely allowed. When I was able to see her, she was quiet. Staring past me and slurring her words, she still told me she wanted to go home.

Patient enrolled in ongoing clinical trial. Results as yet undetermined.

Those were trying years. I was in college, fighting to keep my head above water. Cassie was unreachable. The Institute said she was “too volatile for visitors,” and I was turned away at the entrance to the ward every time I made the trip. I thought about her every day. More and more, my grip on the world was becoming tenuous. Our grandmother had passed away and Cassie was the only living relative I knew of. Without Cassie, did I truly exist?

Patient emerging from coma. Respiration and heart rate normal. Dose 27 given today, no other changes.

I tried to forget her. I truly did. The truth is that she and I were all too connected - I, too was defective. How else could I explain my feeling of vanishing from the world? I should have been in the Institute.

A breakthrough. She says she loves me.

-S.R.

I lived alone. I rarely spoke to anyone, certainly never told anyone the story of my sister. If I ever heard anything about the people lobbying to free their family members from the Institute, I certainly never allowed myself to think of Cassie. After all, I was powerless, and surely, the doctors knew best. She was better off where she had been placed.

A model patient. Docile and cooperative. Regularly expresses gratitude towards her caregivers, and submits willingly to authority. Well-adjusted to our way of life. 

Docile and cooperative she would stay, throughout all the turmoil that threatened to knock her home to the ground. Throughout the conviction of her “beloved,” Dr. S.R., and his quick departure from the Institute. Throughout the fights for freedom that raged outside her walls. Throughout the slow return of her friends and acquaintances to the community, the court battles lost and won, and the Institute’s impending closure. And then Cassie came home to live with me. 

Suddenly, I was no longer alone. Just as suddenly, Cassie was no longer quiet. Again, she screamed and raged - but this time, as if she was crying for a lost love. Yes, for Dr. Samuel Robinson, who had carved his initials into her flesh and left her scarred in his name. (She would later attempt several times to do the same, to mutilate herself as he had done.) She cried, too, for the Institute, for the loss of its regulations and punishments. The needles, the restraints, the medications and the padded room. Until the day she died, I was unable to leave her alone - if I did, she would find a way to harm herself, to reach for what was familiar and somehow comforting.

I’m posting this here because I’m desperate for help. Cassie is gone, but I still need to know. What is it that makes a person love their captors, no matter how brutal they are? What was done to Cassie at the Institute? And how can I make sure it never happens again?
