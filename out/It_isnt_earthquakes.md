I finally have an answer for something that's been plaguing me almost every night, and yet I wish I didn't. I'm laying in bed typing this on my phone because I'm so goddamned scared right now I can't even move.

I've been living in this house with my husband and our daughter for a couple years now. Not long after moving here I started experiencing these weird shaking sensations occasionally at night while laying in bed. It feels exactly like a small earthquake-- and to be honest, for a long time I just wrote them off because I do live in northern California and there's literally fault lines everywhere, I could very well have been feeling small tremors.

But they're just so... Specific. I'd lay here in bed with this disorienting shaking feeling and if I jostled my husband awake he'd swear up and down he felt nothing... Which makes sense because for whatever reason, as soon as someone other than me is awake to feel it, they're suddenly gone. Come to think of it, they happen way more often when he's away at work and it's just me in bed.

I've looked up everything-- seismic activity, medical conditions that cause pseudo earthquake sensations, hell I've wondered if maybe I'm just hallucinating it. I've even looked into whether anything supernatural could be causing it.

Nothing. Nothing matches what I'm feeling. Nothing explains it. Honestly, it hasn't even been that alarming to me anymore, it's been more of an annoyance than anything.

The one thing I never thought to do was look under the bed.

That brings us to now, as I lay alone in bed while my husband is away on a trip, and I'm holding so still I'm barely breathing because when the tremors started this time, on a whim I looked over the side of the bed. And suddenly the tremors stopped... But not before I saw in the dim light coming through my window something I wish I could unsee.

A hand. Abnormally long, bony fingers and dirty jagged nails released its hold on the mattress and quickly drew back under the bed.

As it did, I just as quickly rolled back away from the edge, grabbed my phone and hid under the blankets like a goddamn idiot. I could hardly believe what I saw. It had to be my imagination, right? I couldn't possibly have seen... But no. I definitely saw a hand.

WHY, why did I look down there... I could've lived with never seeing that. And what am I supposed to do now? Call the cops? Whatever is down there will get me way faster than anyone can get here.

I'm so scared guys, I'm trying to stay calm and act like I'm still asleep because something is telling me if it knows I'm awake I'm dead. Maybe it already knows. Maybe it's toying with me, letting me agonize in this silence before those freaking skeletal hands wrap around my neck.

I can almost hear something breathing now, I can't tell where it's coming from but it's like an echo of my own shaky breaths, just a fraction of a second behind like it's trying to match me.

God I'm so scared... What do I do?

Oh no...

The tremors are starting again.
