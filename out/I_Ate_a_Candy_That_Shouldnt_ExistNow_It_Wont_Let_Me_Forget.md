I don’t usually fall for weird online ads, but this one was different.    
  
It popped up late at night, around 3 AM, while I was scrolling through some horror forums. The ad was just a black background with red, flickering text:    
  
\*\*“Try Xyloth’s Sweet Assimilators – Delightfully Human, Just Like You!”\*\*    
  
The tagline felt… off. Like whoever wrote it didn’t quite understand how humans talk. There was no brand, no company, just a grainy GIF of a dark, glossy candy pulsing as if it were breathing. I clicked on it. Nothing happened. The ad vanished, like it had never been there.    
  
Curiosity got the best of me. I Googled the candy—nothing. No articles, no store listings, no mentions anywhere. Reddit? Nothing. The Wayback Machine? Nothing. It was like the candy didn’t exist.    
  
And yet, the next day, I saw it.    
  
I was walking home from work when I spotted a convenience store on the corner of 8th and Wren. I’d walked this route a hundred times. There was no store there before. But the flickering neon sign read: \*\*“OPEN.”\*\*    
  
Inside, the place smelled old. Like dust and something faintly sweet. The shelves were nearly empty except for faded snack wrappers and expired drinks. But there, at the front counter, sat a single row of \*\*Xyloth’s Sweet Assimilators.\*\*    
  
The package was exactly like the ad—dark, organic-looking, with strange purple veins running along the edges. The humanoid face stretched across the wrapper \*grinned at me.\* It felt like it \*knew me.\*    
  
The cashier, an old man with sunken eyes, barely acknowledged me as I paid. His hands shook as he bagged the candy.    
  
\*\*“Don’t chew,”\*\* he muttered. \*\*“Swallow quick.”\*\*    
  
I should have walked away. I should have thrown it in the trash. But I didn’t.    
  
\### \*\*The Taste of Something Else\*\*    
  
At home, I unwrapped it. The candy was smooth, too smooth, like polished glass. It quivered in my palm. I whispered, “Uh… hi?”—half-joking.    
  
It warmed slightly.    
  
I popped it in my mouth. The shell dissolved instantly, releasing a thick, syrupy liquid that spread across my tongue. The taste was \*impossible.\* Not sweet, not bitter—just… familiar, like a memory I couldn’t place. My head buzzed. My vision blurred.    
  
Then I heard it.    
  
\*\*“We taste you too.”\*\*    
  
The voice wasn’t in my ears. It was \*inside\* me. The sensation crawled through my nerves, spreading, learning, adjusting. My thoughts felt \*watched.\*    
  
I swallowed, fast. The voice stopped. The taste lingered, shifting from honey-smooth to something like… static.    
  
For hours, I sat there, trembling, feeling \*\*something\*\* watching from inside me. When I looked in the mirror, my pupils were \*too large.\* My reflection moved a split-second slower than me.    
  
\### \*\*The Store That Wasn’t There\*\*    
  
The next morning, I needed answers. I walked back to 8th and Wren.    
  
The store was gone.    
  
Not closed—\*\*gone.\*\* In its place was an empty lot, overgrown with weeds. I asked an old guy at the newsstand across the street about it.    
  
He gave me a strange look. \*\*“That store shut down 50 years ago. Burned down. Nobody ever rebuilt it.”\*\*    
  
I laughed nervously. Told him I was just there yesterday.    
  
He didn’t laugh.    
  
\*\*“Kid,”\*\* he said, leaning in. \*\*“That place? People say it still shows up sometimes. Always at night. And anyone who goes in…”\*\*    
  
He hesitated. Swallowed hard.    
  
\*\*“They don’t come back the same.”\*\*    
  
I walked home in a daze, my stomach twisting. My mouth still tasted \*wrong.\* No matter how much I brushed my teeth, it wouldn’t go away.    
  
And now, at night, I hear whispering.    
  
Not from outside.    
  
From \*inside.\*    
  
And the worst part?    
  
I think I’m starting to understand what it’s saying.
