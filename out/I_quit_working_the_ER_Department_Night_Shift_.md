I’m okay. 

First and foremost, I’m okay. Last week was intense, and hard to wrap my head around… but I’m okay. I’m free.

I left you all with the information that I was slowly heading down to the morgue in the elevator, the corpse of one of ‘them’ on a stretcher beside me. I admit that I had been acting impulsively—irrationally, and irresponsibly. It was strange; a feeling of incomprehensible familiarity overcame me, and I abided its request—the thing parading as (G). 

When the doors had closed, and we’d begun to descend, I panicked. I began to furiously press the alarm button, realising that, whatever it was that had tricked me into the elevator with it, could do to me what was done to (E); the nurse who had lost her life after being left alone with ‘them.’ I had no reason to trust these monsters—no reason to believe that this one; this one that concealed itself in a flesh suit, fit to gain my empathies, and reveal my vulnerabilities, was any different to those that had traumatised myself and my coworkers… my friends. That had driven (A) to suicide. 

It sat up in the stretcher, the drawsheet still covering its head as it rose. It lifted a hand out from under the sheet, gently placing it on my wrist. And it wasn’t tanned and wrinkled from sun damage, as (G)’s hand had been. It was pale; a purpled white, with no fingernails. 

No fingernails. I had to hold myself from shrieking out, in case that angered it. 

When a voice called through the intercom in the elevator, asking if everything was alright, I’d opted to stay silent. I just stared, unmoving, at the covered figure that seemed to stare back at me from under the sheet. Eventually, I’d heard a crackling: “Must’ve been one of those bastards again.” And the intercom turned off.

“I’m scared.” I remember whispering out, tensing at my own admission. But the thing under the sheet didn’t react in the typical sadistic way I’d grown to expect from them. It paused, and then, as if finally processing what I’d said, or what it wanted to say, it replied.

“I know.” 

It’s voice wasn’t scratched or false. Nothing akin to the imperfect sounds that had emerged from the earlier versions of its kind. It was clear, and deep. Masculine, but with no identifiable accent. My brain scrambled to identify the familiarity to its voice, but at the time, I couldn’t put my finger on it. In hindsight, the familiarity may have simply been the fact that all uncanny qualities seemed to have dissolved away.

The elevator came to a stop, and the doors opened to the morgue. It was cold, and the smell of cleaning bleach stung my nostrils, but it did nothing to mask the undercurrent of the dank, persistent stench of mould permeating through the cracks. There was a long hallway before us; flickering lights doing nothing to settle my erratic heart rate. It was clear that there hadn’t been sufficient enough maintenance down here for a while, but I had expected as much. Our superiors didn’t want any of us to go down here, and I’d imagined that policy extended to external maintenance employees as well. 

I hadn’t noticed it move to stand, until it walked past me, the drawsheet covering it like a child’s ghost costume—I didn’t have the courage to ask it how it could see without eye-holes. I noticed how the clothes it was wearing as it disguised itself as (G), had instead completely disappeared, leaving a set of lean, blotched, pale legs shuffling forward to the morgue door. It stopped suddenly, swinging around awkwardly as it turned to face me. 

“Card. I need your card.” 

I remember how frightened I was. I had half a mind to turn around, and hurriedly press the elevator buttons to leave the situation immediately. Nothing seems worse than being threatened into psychiatric confinement, until you’re staring into the face of the unknown; the face of possible death. Yet there was a concerning amount of fearlessness screaming out in my brain, disregarding the nerves in my quickening heart, and jellied legs. So, I took the risk, and moved toward it. These things weren’t normal, and there was no guarantee that I wouldn’t die instantly had I run away from it. For some bizarre reason, I felt safer with it than I did running away. 

I pressed my key card against the morgue door, and pushed it open. A flurry of even cooler air poured out, and the dim, stuffy atmosphere of the morgue overwhelmed my senses. Almost as quickly as the door had opened, the thing began to rush around the morgue, looking at the name tags that adorned each storage tray. It began to huff in frustration, grabbing at its sheet-covered head, and slapping palms against the metal trays. Its breathing slowed, and calmly, it spoke.

“Turn around.” It ordered.

“What?” 

“Turn around. You don’t want to see.” 

We stood, staring at each other once again. I hesitated, but, once again, I didn’t feel threatened. So I turned around. The slow shuffling of bare feet against the dust-ridden floor grew closer and closer, until it paused, rustling slightly. The sheet was placed over my head. My mind had immediately snapped to recall execution stories I’d heard of, where people are given the small ‘privilege’, of not knowing when their impending death would commence. 

“Please don’t kill me.” I begged, sobbing as I continued to face the wall, sheet covering my head and torso. There was a pause, before it began to give a short, abrupt pat on my upper back. I sobbed harder, falling to my knees. I couldn’t help but think of how I should’ve left when I had the chance, or how I should’ve ignored it once it came in disguised as (G), or how I never should’ve become a nurse to begin with, or how…

And then it swore. It cursed against God. Like a person would’ve. 

I took off the sheet and turned around. I saw it, as it actually was. 

It wasn’t as Dr. (D) had described at all. It was my height, but human. A naked, lean, Male physique, but without any genitalia. It didn’t have a grotesquely wide smile, or jagged teeth. It didn’t look like a monster. It looked like something that was just as afraid as I was. Its large, black eyes widened in horror as it saw me approach, and it rushed to a corner in the shadows. I placed my palms up, showing I meant peace, but its glossy eyes remained transfixed - on edge.

“Please don’t hurt me.” It said. But instead of invoking pity in me; pity invoked had it been a human, it simply made me angry. 

“Me? Hurt you? You - You’re the one that’s hurt us, hurt my friends! You’ve tormented us for years!” I was exasperated, and I kicked a metal table that sat nearby. It flinched at my aggression, and the metal rumbling that echoed throughout the room. A small, steel scalpel rattled from the table, and I lunged for it, holding it before me as I pointed it towards the thing. “You drove (A) to suicide! You killed a nurse—”

“We’ve never killed anyone.” It said, coldly. It stood up, and moved in front of me, placing a warm, pale fist against the sharpness of the make-shift weapon. It didn’t flinch from the contact, but a clear, viscous fluid began to drip from its palm onto the floor. I could see its malnourished and hairless skin, and black eyes clearly now; it had no pigment to its irises. Just dark, empty black, with the low light of the morgue reflecting back at me. “We will never sink as low as your kind.” 

I froze. “What?”

It continued to glare back at me, unmoving. Intimidating.

“What do you mean? Dr. (D) told me what you things did to that nurse, that—”

“That Doctor is nothing more than a liar. He hides his guilt with the drink.” It responded, and eyed me up as if to challenge me on its statement. 

I simply stared back at it, gaping like a fish as I floundered to pull the pieces of information together. “How do you know that? How long have you been watching us?”

It scuttled back, continuing to search the name tags on every body tray it hadn’t seen so far. It had ignored my question. 

“What is it?” I asked again, desperately trying to make some sense of the situation, of my mind, anything. Eventually, it stopped moving. Simply tapping, gingerly, against the metal of a single body tray. 

“What does ‘John Doe’, mean?” It asked, its voice no greater than a whisper. 

“It means that we don’t know the identity of the body.“ I replied, and it hummed in response, high-pitched enough that it sounded like it was holding back tears. I couldn’t stop myself from rambling on, aimlessly trying to fill the silence. “I don’t know why we do it. I think we just believe everyone should have a name, even if it’s not their actual one.” 

It nodded slowly. “It’s a shame that not all of you are this kind.” And it abruptly pulled open the body tray, metal screeching against metal as the un-oiled steel grated against the mechanism inside. I flinched, and it gasped, and then began to sob. Slow, low whimpers of the throat, ready to burst from its tightly closed mouth. It wailed just as I had done, a few moments ago, when I thought I’d be killed. Except its wailing wasn’t one I’d never heard before. It was that of a father, wailing for its child.

As a nurse, I’d seen my fair share of human kids dying far before their time. There’s nothing like a parent crying for their kid. It’s unnatural; a haunting terror inexplicable to those who have the privilege to not know it. Children aren’t supposed to die before their parents, but the world is cruel, and they do. Curiosity took over me once again, and I looked into the tray. I had to stifle a gag, because although the sight was horrific, I was still a nurse, and this thing sobbing next to me was still an individual who had lost their child.

It was a smaller version of the thing - the same being that I was rubbing awkward sympathies on its back as it cried in agony; a small, hairless, humanoid creature, with cloudy white eyes that hadn’t been given the courtesy to be closed. The small creature had multiple puncture wounds all over its body, and despite having been dead for a while, had mummified, as opposed to our… human way of decaying. Its skin wasn’t pale, but grayed and dark, and I can only describe it as seeing something that had had the life sucked out of it. Wrung dry. 

“I’m sorry.” Was all I could muster out; I didn’t really know what to say. There was a disconnect between us - the thing and I. It was my enemy, but also a living, breathing entity. It continued to wail. We stayed like that for a while, until it reached into the body tray to cradle the smaller thing in its arms. 

“They had a name. It’s not a name in your language, but they had one.” It said. I just nodded in response. I was trained in dealing with grief, so I knew better than to interject. It continued to cradle its child. “We have been waiting for this. For confirmation.”

“I don’t understand.”

It shook its head, and with a free hand, wiped its tears. “You have been plaguing our kind for decades. We are always youthful, but you are not.” It sat down, and nestled the corpse under its neck. “Human beings have always wanted to be youthful. Immortality is not as pleasing as it sounds.”

I shrunk to the floor, kneeling. This had been it. I’d finally know what this all was—the reason, the meaning. 

“It’s a superficial desire.” It said, stroking the back of the corpse’s head absentmindedly, though whether it was to soothe the dead or itself, I wasn’t sure. “To try to stay youthful. To steal the qualities of other kinds’ to fulfil that desire. Beauty is fleeting, and to pump your kind’s own skin with it just to stay youthful is…” It trailed off, black eyes welling with tears once more. For a brief moment, I’d sworn that I’d never seen anything more… human. “We simply wanted to scare you enough. To make sure you wouldn’t keep coming back to hunt us—”

The morgue door had slammed open, and multiple men in what I believe was unmarked police gear, bustled in, guns at the ready. They shouted at us incoherently, the crackling of radio and code filling the air. Instinctively, I put my hands up, turning to the thing as I begged it to do the same, to show it wasn’t attacking—that it was innocent. But it relented. I saw the faint smirk on its face, as confirmation clouded its eyes. It knew what was coming, but it didn’t care. It shot me a final glance, lipless mouth still curled in a knowing smile, and it spoke—whispered, for the very last time.

“This is the true nature of your kind.”

It didn’t move, despite my pleas, and a flurry of gunshots plastered its torso and face, and I shook in shock, my eyes never leaving it as the same clear, viscous fluid dripped from every wound. Its face was almost entirely caved in from the proximity of the shots. It slumped back against the body trays, and although its thin arms went limp, the body of its child — his child, was laid down gently in his lap. 

Everything after that is a blur. It’s been over a week since it all happened. I was escorted out by the police, and quickly handed a form which I signed, having not read it, not that I really care either way. I can’t get its - sorry, his face out of my mind. He wasn’t scared; frightened. He was happy. He was right, and he’d known exactly what would happen. He had finally been reunited with his child. 

I’m not really sure what else to say. (B) keeps calling me, asking me where I am. Why I haven’t come back to work. I don’t have the heart to tell him. Ignorance is bliss, after all, and even if I did tell him the truth, there’d be more harm put in his way than there needed to be. 

For the past week, I’ve been wondering how many other of his kind were still there, locked away in the morgue. How many others would come to collect their offspring—their kin. I wondered how many of us would do the same; engage in psychological warfare if the ones we loved were being used for whatever nefarious medical practices, needed or not. My mind wandered to the war crimes committed by mankind since the dawn of time, and how many of us mindlessly conform to practices because that’s what we know—all we know. 

I’m checking myself into a psychiatric ward. I need to be alone and cared for, for now. I’d never have thought my career as an ER nurse would turn out this way. Maybe I was naive. Nothing can prepare you for the horrors of humanity’s actions, especially when you’re faced with a being who shows themselves to be just as human as you are.
