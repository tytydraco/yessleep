Do not answer the ad for cineplex24 , I did and now I’m trapped (part 2)

Firstly , incase you havnt seen my first post I’ll link it here for you , to hopefully help you make sense of the madness I’ve experienced so far - Part 1 -https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/x9cE82YRMi

Anyway …


I didn’t expect to be updating you all this soon, but something happened last night that I’d be stupid not to share.

It was supposed to be one of my nights off—and to be honest, I’d just bought a new 56-inch 4K TV thanks to my increasingly bizarre source of income. I was ready to kick back. But I had to come in. I needed to.

Mr. Clinton called around midnight.

“Will! Hi—Mr. Clinton here. Your fantastically amazing boss and, I’d like to assume, friend. We need you to come in. Like, now. To cover the rest of the shift.”

Thing is, I never gave him my number. And my name still wasn’t William.

“Uh, hi Mr. Clinton. It’s my day off, man. Why do you need me so desperately? What happened to the guy doing nights?”

“He’s on the floor—”

I was about to make a smartass remark like, just pick him up then, but he kept going:

“—and the walls. The ceiling. The popcorn maker. Rustling and squelching. And in my pocket.”

“…I mean. What happened?”

At first, I was a little relieved that someone else was having a rough time too—but it sounded like maybe this guy had it slightly worse than me.

“Well, the Grey Lady happened. She seemed harmless enough, but the other guy tried talking to her. Asked her to stop messing with the displays. And then—POOF!—a mist of red, and shit just started flying!”

I wasn’t entirely sure how seriously to take him. His words were absurd—but recent events had done a good job of steamrolling my rational mind. And still, the way he described someone going out like that? It made me feel sick.

I wasn’t going to go in. Not until he said:

“Triple. I’ll give you triple to come in and cover the last six hours. Just over £3.2k.”

Within ten minutes, I was back in uniform and on my way to work.

No way I could turn down a ludicrous amount of money like that. Still, I had the sense the pay was less about generosity—and more about Mr. Clinton knowing exactly what kind of night lay ahead.
I arrived at the cinema, which glowed like a beacon through the misty night.

Something felt off right away. The mist wasn’t its usual dull grey—it was a deep maroon, tinged with the smell of copper. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, but something about it reminded me too much of blood. The thought nagged at me, raising more questions about the events that led to the last guy’s… untimely demise.

Through the haze, I spotted Ash outside, using a leaf blower to clear the red mist from the front doors. Slowly, it began to thin out, dispersing from the building bit by bit.

“Hey man! Go round the back—and try not to breathe too much till you’re in, yeah? Don’t wanna inhale too much of the last guy!”

I immediately shifted from a walk to a brisk jog, covering my face with my sleeve. Once inside, Ash tossed me a few paper towels.

“Welcome back,” they said, with a slight smirk.

I wiped my face, expecting sweat. But when I pulled the towel away, it was stained a sickly pink. I chose not to dwell on it.

“Back again so soon? Gotta admit, I missed you a bit.”
Ash threw their arms around me with a surprising, slightly awkward hug, then chuckled to themselves as they led me into the lobby.

It was surprisingly clean, considering someone had just exploded. But then I noticed the bin.

Poking out from the top was a whole leg—trousers and shoe still attached.

Ash caught my glance and tried to steer me away from it with an exaggerated clap of their hands.

“Okaaaay! So. New rule: if the Grey Lady shows up, just let her do her thing. Don’t try to stop her. Or—well. You know.”

They gestured vaguely toward the leg before walking off to dispose of what was left. My only task? Sit behind the glass counter and wait for customers. Easy enough.

Apparently, we had another late-night premiere, so we got a fairly normal crowd asking for tickets. Some of them were… less normal.

One guy asked for “Tape 7 of 42, Gloucestershire, 1980.”
Another muttered “Open the emergency exit.”

I did exactly as instructed: gave them a ticket to Screen Five and said nothing. Things were going smoothly enough. I was even starting to feel like I was getting the hang of this strange little job.

That was, until the next customer came in.

And as I sit here writing this, I still can’t tell if they were real or a figment of my imagination.
The glass doors flew open with a bang that sounded like a gunshot.

I jumped.

Someone strode toward the counter, arms wide. “Good evening, good evening! It’s so good to be back!” he said, grinning. “You, sir, behind the counter—are you well?”

He couldn’t have been much older than me, but he spoke with the kind of polished elegance you’d expect from an old aristocrat. He wore a black tuxedo that looked like it had been dragged through every hedge on the way here. His skin was pale—too pale—and cracked like porcelain, leaking faint trails of greenish goo.

“Uh… yeah. I’m fine, thanks. What can I help you with? Are you here to see something tonight?”

He smiled wider. “You, of course. I’ve seen a lot of good things from you. Knew you’d fit in perfectly around here. I’ve known you for quite some time now.”

That made no sense. I’d only just met the guy—but he was talking like we were old friends. Or worse—like I was part of something I didn’t remember agreeing to.

He ran a long finger along the glass counter and tapped it softly.

“So,” he said, “how are you finding it here?”

“It’s… unique. And, quite frankly, terrifying. But I’ve got more money than sense, so there’s that.”

“Good lad. I’m glad to hear it. Listen—I can help you, you know. I am the light in this sea of darkness. And you, my boy, are riding a paddleboat straight into the jaws of death. Let me be your lighthouse.”

I can’t lie—I was incredibly confused. But also? A little intrigued.

“Okay… how exactly are you planning to help me?”

“All in good time. All in good time,” he whispered. “We don’t want to let it know what we’re doing, after all.”

That was it. Rational thought slammed back into place. This guy was clearly unhinged.

He bowed theatrically and started to walk away, whistling to himself. But just before he left, he turned back to me, locked eyes, and winked.

Weird. Deeply weird. But I wasn’t harmed physically—or mentally—so I counted it as a win and carried on with my shift.



The next couple of hours were quieter.

The man in the green coat showed up again. Just like last time, he glided straight up to the counter, mumbled in that awful monotone voice.
“Flat 9. Red door. Pemberton Road. No lock. Sooner.”

That was my friend’s flat. She’d only moved in two weeks ago.

I felt cold. Real, bone-deep fear. This thing—whatever it was—knew where my loved ones lived. That terrified me more than anything else that had happened so far.

He didn’t leave right away this time. He just stood there, staring at me, or atleast I could feel a stare from behind . I could feel him pressing against my very soul. My body screamed for fight or flight—but instead, I froze.

My stomach turned over. I felt like something heavy had been dropped on my back, pushing me downward, suffocating me.

Then, suddenly—a hand reached out from beside me and slammed a tub of popcorn down onto the glass. The sound was so sharp I yelped.

Just like that, the pressure lifted. I could breathe again. But before I could turn around, the bucket was dropped onto my head. Popcorn bounced off my shoulders.

“That was a medium you gave him, you fucking idiot.”

I yanked the tub off and saw the man in the tuxedo again, shaking his head and chuckling.

“Christ, if I hadn’t shown up,” he muttered, “you’d be a pile of meat on the floor by now.”

He wandered off into the corridor behind me, still laughing.

The colour drained from my face. My hands shook. My breath came fast and shallow as it hit me—I had almost died. Over a popcorn size mix-up.

I sank onto the nearest stool, head in my hands, trying to collect myself.

I knew the rules. I knew the risks. And still, I’d been careless. I couldn’t afford another mistake.

To keep myself grounded, I threw myself into routine cleaning and maintenance.

Anything to stay busy.
Anything to stay safe.

I began cleaning down one of the side corridors I hadn’t ventured into before—one Ash hadn’t shown me.

At first glance, it looked normal enough. Same décor. Same dim lighting. A mess of popcorn and spilled drinks littered the floor—nothing I hadn’t seen a hundred times before. I figured the morning crew had just forgotten about it.

The corridor wasn’t long. Just four doors. Three of them were cinema screens, but none were numbered. Instead, each door was marked with strange symbols—collages of lines, circles, and angles etched into dark wood like something pulled from an occult geometry textbook.

At the far end stood a single black door, smaller than the others, plain except for a small gold projector symbol mounted just above the handle.

Then it slammed shut.

“Hello? Ash? That you?”

No answer.

I edged closer. The door clicked. It creaked open slightly, inviting me.

If curiosity killed the cat, then I was well on my way to using up a few lives.

I stepped through and found a short staircase leading up. At the top was what looked like an old projection room. Wall to wall, it was lined with reels and tapes. In the center stood a massive, antique projector, quietly whirring away.

Which was strange—because we only used digital systems. This had to be some dusty leftover from a bygone era, kept around for nostalgia’s sake.

But the projector was on, and it was clearly playing something. I moved to the small observation window and peeked down at the screen below.

The cinema room it looked out on was completely empty—save for two figures sitting in the front row.

On screen, instead of a film, there was what looked like a slideshow. A soft, delicate piano played in the background.

The first few images were of a young family in a park, filmed from a distance. The camera was shaky, like someone had filmed it covertly. There were other people in the background, but the footage focused relentlessly on this one group.

Then the scene shifted.

A hospital, maybe. The footage showed only legs from the knees down, as shadows moved in and out of frame. It was clinical, quiet, unnerving.

Then—darkness.

The screen went black, and the piano played a long, low, foreboding note. A faint red glow appeared in the center of the projection, lighting the room with a sinister hue. Then a metal door swung into frame with a loud thunk, and a voice whispered, “Help.”

The reel stopped.

Darkness.

I fumbled for my phone to turn on the torch, but before I could switch it on, the projector began to vibrate.

Its outer shell twisted and cracked.

From within, black, fleshy tendrils began to slide out—stretching and warping, folding into limbs. The metal buckled and reshaped itself, like it was birthing something.

And then it stood.

A grotesque figure, stitched together from reels of film and bits of metal, legs jerking as it moved with unnatural spasms. A light flickered in the center of what might have been its face.

Then came the sound—a flickering screech like static and tearing celluloid all at once.

I ran.

I sprinted to the door and yanked the handle.

Locked.

“Help! Ash?! Someone open this fucking door!”

I could hear it behind me—clicking, creaking, dragging itself closer. I spotted a broom closet to my right and ducked inside, slamming the door and holding my breath.

My heart pounded so hard, I was surprised it wasn’t knocking against the wood.

Through a crack, I saw its light sweep across the floor—its screeching getting louder.

Then, a rat scurried into view.

The projector-beast stopped.

Its head twisted. A beam of light shone down on the rat. And in an instant—it was gone. Vaporized. Nothing left but the faint smell of singed fur.

Shit.

One near-death experience was bad enough. This? This felt like the end. Death by demon-projector wasn’t how I pictured myself going out.

Suddenly, the door burst open, flooding the room with bright, white light.

Ash stood in the doorway, holding up a mirror.

“Get back, you big old piece of shit!” they shouted, the mirror catching the creature’s light and reflecting it straight back at it.

The thing shrieked. A horrible, high-pitched screech that rattled my bones and filled me with pure, unfiltered panic.

Then—silence.

Ash lowered the mirror, panting.

“It’s safe. Come on out.”

I collapsed forward, the door resisting me at first. My arm was throbbing. I wasn’t sure if I’d broken it or if I was just being a bit of a coward. Honestly, I didn’t care.

Ash looked me over, eyes wide with a mix of fear and frustration.

“What the hell were you doing in there, man? How did you even get in?”

“I just… I hadn’t seen that part before. And it looked messy as shit. No one told me I couldn’t go in.”

Ash stared at me for a long moment, then sighed.

“Okay. New rule. If a part of the cinema opens up that you haven’t been shown—or better yet, a part that wasn’t there before—do not go in.”

I got to my feet slowly and started to apologize, but Ash cut me off.

“No, don’t apologize. That’s on me. I should’ve warned you. I just didn’t think this place would… open up so soon.”

They looked over their shoulder, like expecting the walls to move again.

“This place reveals itself slowly—like a Russian nesting doll. And every new layer is designed to trap you. So please… just be careful.”

Then, without warning, Ash threw their arms around me.

Not a casual coworker hug.

A real one. A heavy squeeze that said I’m glad you’re alive.

It caught me off guard—but I appreciated it more than I could say.

Two near-death experiences in one shift was definitely above my pay grade. Every step I took afterward was wobbly, like my bones had turned to jelly.

Luckily, it was time for my break.

And after everything I’d just been through, I was looking forward to it—even if it was just a figment of my mind.
I threw open the staff room door, greeted by the soft ding of a little bell above me.

The smell of freshly made pancakes drifted through the air, wrapped in the toasty aroma of slightly burnt bread. I stepped into the café—my little pocket of peace. I slid into my usual booth. The sponge beneath me deflated with a satisfying whoosh.

For the first time that evening, I felt… at ease.

I glanced around, expecting to see George—but instead, a woman stood behind the counter, making a fresh pot of coffee.

“I’ll be right with you, sugar,” she called over her shoulder. “Just give old Noreen a minute.”

That stopped me in my tracks.

New character unlocked? Great.

After the night I’d just had, my guard snapped right back into place. I’d come in hoping for a hint of normalcy—or at least whatever passed for normal here. I’m not great with surprises. Even the good ones tend to throw me off.

A larger woman with kind eyes and a messy bob approached, balancing a tray with practiced grace. She placed it down in front of me with a gentle rattle and smiled.

On the tray was, quite possibly, the most perfect breakfast I’d ever seen.

There was coffee and juice in ceramic and glass containers, a stack of six golden pancakes glistening with maple syrup and draped in crispy bacon. A basket of croissants and pastries sat to the side with a selection of jams and spreads. But the main event? A sausage sandwich on thick sourdough, absolutely bursting at the seams. A meaty, indulgent monument to breakfast.

Before I could speak, she leaned in and said, “Anything you don’t eat, don’t worry, sweet. I can always take it back for my George—he loves my breakfasts.”

I didn’t need to ask who she was. It was obvious. George’s wife. Somehow, that filled me with warmth.

If all this was a figment of my imagination, then at least my mind had been kind enough to give George someone who loved him.

I smiled, picked up my knife and fork, and tucked in.

It was phenomenal. The pancakes disappeared first, followed quickly by the sandwich. I restrained myself from devouring all the pastries—George would want those, and I was happy to leave a few behind for him.

Time moved strangely here. It felt like I’d been sitting there for hours, but when I checked my phone, only thirty minutes had passed.

Still, something had shifted.

The café began to feel more real. I could’ve sworn I heard birdsong outside. The windows fogged with condensation, but behind the mist, I saw faint flashes of colour, blurred movement—like traffic rolling past.

I didn’t care. I was happy. I felt safe.

And honestly? If this was a trap, I’d be fine staying here forever.

Noreen sat down across from me, tossing a towel over her shoulder and chuckling.

“My, my. You were hungry.”

“Noreen, that was the best bloody breakfast I’ve ever had. It was something else.”

I leaned back and patted my belly. She beamed, squeezing her fists up beside her face like a delighted schoolteacher.

“Oh, I’m so glad to hear it! It’s George’s favourite, and he said you’d love it.”

Then her expression shifted, softening.

“And how are you holding up, darling? Rough night, I hear?”

I told her everything. The near-death experiences. The anxiety. The pressure. And, oddly, I also shared the more mundane parts of my day—the bits before all the blood, ghosts, and monster projectors.

I normally wouldn’t open up like that. But something about Noreen made it easy to trust her. Like I could exhale for once.

That is, until I mentioned the man in the suit.

I described him in detail—the porcelain skin, the tuxedo, the cracked voice, and his strange offer to “help” me.

Noreen went quiet. Stone still.

“No… no, it can’t be,” she whispered. “Did you say he spoke to you?”

“Yeah,” I nodded. “He actually saved me. I gave the guy in the green coat the wrong size popcorn, and he—”

She raised a hand, cutting me off gently.

“Goodness… Okay. Listen to me, sweetheart. Don’t tell Ash about this. She’ll know when the time’s right, but it’s not my place to say more.”

“But who is he?”

“I can’t say much. I’m sorry, son. Just know—he does want to help you. But he’s… a very troubled man.”

She paused.

“Was.”

Before I could ask more, I was called back to shift.

As I stood, Noreen gave me a final warning.

“Remember what I told you, sweetheart. Not a word. They’re not ready yet.”

I nodded, reluctantly, and walked back out.



Ash was in the lobby, trying to manage a crowd of early guests for a film I’d never heard of. Apparently, it was real—and Ash insisted it was premiering tonight.

I knew better than to argue.

It was some Norwegian indie horror about a group of friends trapped in a haunted bed and breakfast. Cult following. Weird energy.

The line dwindled until only one figure remained.

We thought he was just another customer—until he stepped forward.

Hood up. Long black coat. No visible face. Just an envelope, pulled from inside the coat and placed gently on the counter in front of us.

Without a word, he turned and walked out the doors.

Ash and I stared after him, then looked down at the envelope.

It read:
“Coming soon to a theatre near you.”

Inside?

Just one name.

William.

Ash’s face turned the colour of chalk. Their hands trembled slightly as they crumpled the letter and shoved it into their pocket.

“Okay, mate. You can go home. Punch your ticket. Shift’s over.”

“Don’t worry, Ash. I’ve still got an hour and—”

“I said NOW.”

They turned and stormed into their dad’s office.

I didn’t argue.

It was overtime anyway. One missed hour wasn’t going to kill me. Especially not compared to what almost had.

One of the morning crew had already clocked in, so I headed toward the exit.

As I stepped out, I paused for a moment—just long enough to feel the warmth of the rising sun on my face. A breath of relief escaped my chest, shaky but grateful.

But then—

A whistle.

Coming from behind me.

I turned.

Standing at the top of the stairwell where Ash had shouted at me just a few nights ago… was the man in the suit.

He waved.

A slow, theatrical wave.

And that grin—wide, sharp, and twisted into something I couldn’t quite place.

I gave a reluctant wave back.

Then I turned, walked home, and now… here I am. Sitting and typing up another strange, disturbing night.

Thank you for listening to my last post, by the way. It still feels like a fever dream—but knowing there are people out there actually reading this? That means more than I can say.

That’s all for now.

But I doubt this is the last update I’ll be sharing.

Signing off.
