As I said in the beginning all it takes is one bad day to flip your world upside down, I went from a boring 9-5 job working my life away to traveling the world fighting monsters you’ve only heard about in books and movies with the freaking devil as my best friend… my brother.

I never expected life to turn out this way at all but I wouldn’t change anything for a second, finding out I was what Beezle would call it “an inbetween” (not very creative if you ask me) which he described it as a one in a trillion event mainly because it’s almost impossible to do

Too sum it up when a demon or angel dies it can be reborn as an inbetween, but it happens so rarely because neither want to upset the balance of life and death which could create a tear where either a heaven sent or hell spawn could pass through to Earth and also because of how unlikely it would happen hinting to why Beezle is on earth in the first place.

So as to who am I? Well I’m still me, I don’t have any memories of my previous life so I preferred to stay as Beck but I’ll let Beezle finish this once.

 Hi y’all I know y’all only really know me from Becks descriptions but I’ve read all of your replies and it’s nice to formally meet you lovely people, I know most think this is just some story written by a man with an obviously diluted mental state but trust me when I say all you’ve read and will read is real

So why’d I risk the safety of the world to save one man? Well some might say it’s because I’m selfish and evil and blah blah blah but I’m not, now I’ll admit at one point in my life I made a lot of not so great decisions and I’ve lived more than enough lifetimes in regret of my actions but saving the one man I could truly trust and call a friend well it was the easiest decision I’ve ever made.

So for a little bit of explanation to avoid confusion my names Lucifer not Beezle. Beezle was a truly loyal soldier and friend, and I couldn’t help but try and keep his name alive; about 35ish years ago Me and Beezle were going to a place called Lake Cocytus (a frozen lake/prison where I keep the worst kind of beings) to meet an old “friend” Belial who had at this point tried to betray me and take hell for himself but that’s another story in its own, either way we heard he may have been planing an escape of some sort

“So whatcha think his dumbass has planned this time”- L

“We’ll honestly I’m not surprised he hasn’t tried chewing his way out yet” - Beezle says laughing as we approach the ginormous gate surrounded by layers of thick concrete

As we step through we follow the twist and turns of the labyrinth up to the highest floor made specifically for Belial 

“Come to visit and old friend Lucy?” A gravely deep voice says from the the shadows

“Oh and Beezle welcome, welcome to my humble home” - Belial

“Cut the shit”- Beezle says 

“we know you’re planning something, so come on spill and we may provide some better accommodations”- L

“Whatever do you mean?, I’ve been stuck here for centuries how could I escape” Belial says as he steps into the dim light revealing his aging over the years, he was a taller bigger man with long dark hair and yellow eyes that seemed to almost glow with excitement  

“As you can see I’m not exactly in my prime” he says while giving me a wink

“Listen you know you fucked up in the past don’t make this any harder for yourself, if you were anyone else you’d be dead Belial” -I say with clear frustration in my voice

“I fucked up?, all I did was try to return he’ll into its former glory before you decided to become all soft Lucy”-Belial

“Soft? I’ve been trying to advance hell with less senseless deaths and you call that soft?”

He began chuckling saying “You can’t make the hard decisions, so I will but that’s enough talking for now, I’ll see you later Samual”-Belial says smugly as the wall explodes next to us sending Beezle flying into me inturn sending me into the wall

I awake sometime later bruised but healing, I step up to see Beezle with a angelic shard lodged in his chest 

“A holy bomb?” I mumble to myself confusingly

“Alright Beezle get up man no little old holy hand grenade can keep us down” I say worriedly 

Kneeling beside him I see another shard lodged in his throat, gasping Beezle looks at me 

“Holy hand grenade?, now that’s funny” Beezle says choking on his own blood as his eyes begin to shut

“Beezle?!, BEEZLE!” I say tears swelling like boulders in my eyes, Picking him up I rush to the center of hell, on the way I had to cut down some of Belials not so smart followers when a what can only be described as a giant troll leaped in-front of me blocking my path, knowing time isn’t really on my side I toss Beezle over him, sliding underneath and cutting his achilles tendon’s and catching beezle

After about an hour of running and killing I start to get scared im too late, finally reaching my house I stop and look at Beezle who’s starting to turn cold

kicking open my door I set him down on a table as I ransack my house looking for a leviathan wishing bone

The last one in existence, a very powerful artifact made from one of dads first monsters, after humanity killed one and used it to create fire father quickly tried to erase all of them from existence, luckily I kept one from my fall from heaven which to be honest I had almost used it then, now it isn’t as strong as dad but it had enough of his grace to create a miracle, and if anything could save Beezle it was this

I broke the bone and made my wish but of course there’s always a price, and Beezles price was being half human, obviously memory loss and the previously mentioned tear in reality letting both hell and heaven onto y’all’s Earthly plane

After I waited a few years, one to give Beezle time to get older since he is half human and two to start planning my revenge for Belial which included training Beezle(now Beck) to fight against lower level beings and ofcourse protect Earth from the evil I although accidentally unleashed

Me and Beck did end up fighting Belial and this time killing him but this entry is getting long enough so we’ll have to save it for next time, at the end of the day though I saved my brother and now knowing everything I know and what my actions caused id still do it all over again.
