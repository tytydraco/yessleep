The blood was fresh and being soaked up fairly quickly in the old shag carpet. It was a relief honestly. The blood dulled the smell of the cigarette residue that had been built up in the carpet for what I can assume to be decades.

Retched woman. I found her sprawled out on the floor with her curled gray and white hair, and wrinkled, shriveled-up body covered in liver spots. Whoever did this really wanted to get the job done. They not only slit her throat but both her wrists as well. Her children and grandkids won’t be too happy about this, but many more people will sigh, feeling an immense weight lifted off their shoulders.

Two weeks ago I was on the verge of going completely broke. This was nothing new though. Finances and I have never had a good relationship. I know I had a problem, at least half of me acknowledged it. The other half kept spinning that roulette wheel and betting on that one horse to beat the odds. I was always close, but not close enough. I was counting down the dollars at the grocery store, but being careful as to not forget the tax. I refused to be that person who would have to put some food back while checking out. “I think I got this one” I told myself. $45 with some wiggle room. That’ll last me… maybe five days? If I’m lucky?

I was walking through the bread aisle when an old woman with a back hump was pushing a shopping cart in the other direction. As we passed each other, I noticed not only the waft of cigarette smell, but something had fallen to the ground in my peripheral view. I looked down and saw that the old lady had dropped some money. As I went to pick it up, I saw it was two, crumbled-up $100 bills. I felt in my chest what I can only describe as getting giddy like a child. I had the immediate instinct to shove it into my jacket pocket and walk away. But, I didn’t. Caution override the desire of thievery. 

It’s $200. I’m sure she would report the money missing to the grocery store just to be safe, and they would catch me on camera taking it. There was one of those black orb-looking cameras on the ceiling in the aisle right next to me where the blacked-out cover of it was to prevent people from knowing where the camera was looking. Also, the bills were in rough condition. What if she just managed to save enough money for a full grocery shopping trip for once? She very well could be broke like me. For some reason, this oldie hit a soft spot in me.

“Excuse me ma’am, I think you dropped this.” She turned to me to see if I was talking to her or someone else. She had bright turquoise eyes. I’ve never seen eyes that color before. They were very pretty, but they sent a shiver down my spine because of how odd they were. I noticed I had paused too long looking at her eyes.

“....Sorry, I think you dropped some money.” I handed her the $200.

She was shocked. “Oh, thank you very much. How did I manage to do that? Thank you.” I nodded, and as I began to walk away, she continued.

“Wait, I have something for you.” She reached into a small purse, and with the crumbled bills I handed back to her, she handed me two more crisp $100 bills. $400 total. I assumed she was not aware of what she was doing.

“Ma’am, no need.” I put my hand out to gently push her hand back.

“I’m aware,” she said.

“And now it’s yours.” She re-extended her hand, now eagerly getting me to take the money. 

I replied, “That’s very kind of you, but there’s no way I could take this. That’s a lot of money.”

She replied, “You could have walked away with what you found. But you didn’t. Now, you have double.” There was a brief pause while I contemplated taking the money or not.

“If I needed it I wouldn’t be giving it to you” she said. I took the money from her.

“Thank you,” I replied.

“You don’t know how much this means to me.”

She looked at my shopping cart which so far only had a loaf of bread and a can of baked beans. “It looks like you have some shopping to do” she said with a smile before turning around and pushing her cart away.

If you know the mind of an addict, I’m sure this comes as no surprise. I spent $150 on groceries and the rest I immediately went to the casino that is conveniently seven minutes away from my apartment. The next horse race was the next day, but I couldn’t wait. I knew I was going to make it big this time. Screw the tables, I didn’t want to waste my money having to tip the croupier. I went first to the slot machines. I was going to spend maybe $20, $50 at most if I didn’t win, which I thought at least I’d make a little. But only half an hour later I realized I spent $200. I got caught up in it. I needed to get my head in the game. 

I went up to the “self-serve” roulette table. A chair was open. Six other people sat around the wheel staring as it went round and round. Everybody anticipating that big break. That spin concluded. Some people groaned, some said nothing. I looked at my digital screen. Normally with roulette I like to spread my chances out; pick multiple numbers, overlap, etc. But something was telling me to put my whole $50 left on number seven. The guy sitting next to me saw my bet and scoffed.

“I’ve been losing money here for an hour. You’re not going to win that bet” he said. He noticed the others at the table were looking at us. He grinned.

“If it lands on seven, I’ll give you an extra $50. If you lose, you owe me $50” he said. There was a short pause. 

“Same here. No way you’re winning that” a woman sitting across the table said.

“I will too” the man sitting next to her said. All six people were putting in $50 each. An extra $300 on top of my incoming winnings. I couldn’t resist.

“Alright” I said confidently. My heart sank. My face went flush. What have I done? The roulette ivorine was released, and round it went. I glanced back and forth between the wheel and the others. They were glancing back and forth between the wheel and me. It landed. Eight. It landed on eight. They cheered. Fight or flight kicked in. I reached into my jacket pocket. I decided I was going to pretend to get the money out of my wallet and then book it out of the casino. 

When I opened my wallet, expecting nothing, were multiple crisp $50 bills. Seven of them. I tried to hide my shock and play it cool. I started to hand out the $50 bills to each of them. I sat back down. I was left again with $50. I… did seven. I put it all on seven again. I don’t know why, but I did. Everyone at the table laughed at me. Pity laughed. 

“You must really have an issue” one of the guys said. The wheel spun. Everyone at the table was grinning, watching the wheel, waiting to make fun of me again. It landed. It was seven. The $50 that appeared in my wallet turned into $250. I made my money back. Everyone looked at me in utter disbelief. Again, I don’t know what took over me, but I put the whole $250 on eight. Now everyone was getting really irritated.

“Are you kidding me?” one guy said.

“This is ridiculous” another woman said.

The wheel spun. There was an anticipation at that table I had never experienced before. It landed. It was eight. I had won another $250. I had never won a single dollar gambling before. Not a penny. Everyone got pissed; in general, at the circumstance. Not at me. Thank god. Three people at the table got up and walked away angry. The force that had overcome me “told” me to leave the table. So, I did. I walked out of the casino. Normally I would keep going, but something was telling me to stop. Something.

I entered my little apartment and tossed my keys onto the kitchen table. Very cliche for a person struggling with money, I looked at the two overdue credit card bills and electric bill notice also sitting on the table. I sat down. What just happened? Finally winning with anything involving gambling didn’t feel as good as I thought it would. Facing again the fact that I am an addict, how was I even able to walk away from the table without spending all my winnings away?

I honestly became alarmed when I felt the urge to deposit my winnings at the bank tomorrow to start paying off my debts. Responsibility was a new desire for me. I got up and grabbed my jacket and keys. I felt antsy all of a sudden. I decided to go grab a coffee at the coffee shop across the street. 

I got my iced Americano and decided to stand outside the coffee shop to feel the breeze. After a couple of minutes, an older woman with a cane started to walk up the sidewalk. It was weird. I hadn’t seen her cross the street or walk up from down the way. I realized after a moment that it was the same woman from the grocery store.

“Oh hello there. What a pleasant surprise. How are you?” The woman said this to me as though we had known each other for years. Her smile was kind, but her turquoise eyes showed no emotion.

“…Good, just grabbing some coffee. How ‘bout you?” I said.

“Me too. An iced Americano always makes my day” she said. She stopped in front of me and continued.

“How has the rest of your day been?” referencing since we met at the grocery store.

“Good. Thanks again” I replied. The woman grinned.

“Be careful now. Nothing stays for long. The good and the bad come and go” she said. I assumed she was making a corny old-person comment to spend the money she gave me wisely. I pretended her comment wasn’t annoying and arrogant, like how people want the barista to see and thank them for putting money in the tip jar. I gave her a “warm” smile.

She walked around me. I heard the little metal bells the coffee shop put on top of the door jingle as she walked in. I turned around curious to see the reaction of the employees to her, if she was a regular or not so I would know if I would see her again. But, she wasn’t there. The coffee shop wasn’t big. You can see the whole front of the coffee shop through the window and the door. She was nowhere to be found. There’s no possible way she could have gone anywhere else in the second she went around me to enter the coffee shop. She was gone.

Oddly enough, I felt pretty calm. I could tell this reaction was definitely from this new force or state I’ve been in since the casino earlier. It was bizarre, but I didn’t feel the need to question what I just witnessed. At least not right then. I sipped my last bit of coffee and crossed the street back to my apartment. Again, I hung up my jacket and put my keys on the table. It was only 3:00pm, but I suddenly became so drained. Just utterly tired. I showered and went to bed.

I woke up at 7:00am. I felt refreshed. I got up and had my cup of coffee while watching birds and passerbyers outside my living room window. I had some cereal, showered, and headed out to the bank to deposit my winnings from the day before. Waiting in line at the bank, I felt a wave of nervousness come over me. I didn’t know what was happening. I kept going back and forth between feeling really good and pure dread. 

When it was my turn, I handed the teller my deposit slip and took my wallet out to hand her the money. What I found was not only the winnings, but an extra $50. I paused for a moment. Am I becoming extremely forgetful? The teller waited.

“Sir, are you making a deposit?” she said.

“Yes. Sorry. Here” I replied. I handed her the amount I won. I kept the new $50 bill. I left the bank. Off to the race track I went.

It wasn’t busy. Only a quarter of the people that normally fill the betting room were there. I looked at the horses racing that day. I never understood why they gave the horses weird names that sound like a child from the 1940’s make them up. “Flash Trixie?” “Corn-of-Copia?” What even is that? The force from yesterday washed over me again. My focus went toward horse #7. I didn’t bother to catch its name. The odds were in the middle. The horse had a pretty average record. Not great, but not bad. I went to the counter.

I kept it short. “On #7. First place” I said and slid my cash over to the betting teller. Dead-eyed, he took my money. As the cash left my hand, I saw what I handed over. Five $100 bills. I thought I just deposited $500 at the bank? I wanted to stop him, but I couldn’t. At that brief moment, I was unable to talk or move. He handed me a ticket and I just walked away. I went outside and stood there, watching the track as the horses lined up ready to go. An overly confident man stood near me. He turned when he saw me walk up to watch.

“Which ones you got?” he said, meaning what was my bet.

“#7” I said.

“What place?” he asked.

“First” I replied. He scoffed.

“I mean, I guess you could have chosen worse. Good luck” he said. I ignored him.

The bell rang and the horses were off. Only a couple of the jockeys kept back to conserve energy. Most of the horses started at full force. I could feel the ground vibrate from the stands from the galloping. Though the speed was incredible, there wasn’t much movement. All the horses kept their places where they started. Then, #8, something along the lines of “Blitz of Coffee” charged forward to the head of the pack, maintaining first place. #7 remained toward the back, maybe third from last.

“Oh geez. You’re not doing too good buddy” the guy said to me. I ignored him again. The race was maybe half done. Then, #7 got some wind in its sails. It pushed forward. Third from last, fifteenth, twelve, eighth, then third place.

“I put #8 on first” the man said.

“It looks like it’s gonna take it home”

Inch by inch, the horses about 80% done, #7 got into second place. My heart began to pound. They were in the final stretch. They were going and going. #7 kept pushing. And then… they were done. #8 crossed the finish line in first place. #7 placed second maybe one hoof away from #8. The man next to me cheered and waved his ticket in the air.

“Yes. Yes. That’s how you do it.”

He turned to me. “Maybe next time bud.” He went inside to collect his winnings. As he was entering the door to the betting room, two tall, broad muscular men and a short man in a suit walked out, coming toward me. When they got to me, the short man looked at me as though he was waiting for me to do something.

“...Hi?” I said to him.

“Well?” the short man said. There was a pause.

“Pay up” the man said, irritated.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about” I replied. The man scoffed and looked down, pinching the bridge of his nose, becoming more irritated.

“Pay up. You lost. That was the deal. You owe two-grand” he said. I was shocked.

“What?” I said.

“What are you talking about? I bet $50… or $500. No strings attached.” The man clearly had enough of me.

“Alright, let’s go. Inside.” As the man said that, the two bigger men started to walk toward me. I didn’t know what was going on. I bolted. I didn’t even look behind me to see if they were running after me or not. I just kept running. I got in my car and sped home.

I rushed into my apartment and locked the regular lock and the two deadbolts on my door. I just stood there for a minute, processing everything. I thought I must be mentally deteriorating. I’m imagining money switching amounts within the blink of an eye. I wasn’t remembering doing certain transactions or bets. I needed to see a doctor immediately, but this is the U.S. healthcare system. I didn’t know if I had the money to do so. I didn’t need any more debt.

I went online and paid my electric bill just to give me some sort of comfort in the moment. I checked my bank account, it showed that I did in fact deposit the money I knew I deposited, so that was good at least. I then sat at my kitchen table for about two hours going back and forth between fiddling around with apps on my phone and watching the door. I wanted to make sure the guys at the racing track didn’t know where I lived. I think my brain was trying to protect me from the trauma of all of this by having me suddenly become exhausted from the anxiety, and shut down. I quickly fell asleep.

The nightmare I had was surreal to say the least. I was in a pitch-black room. Or black space. It didn’t feel exactly like a room. I was able to stand on a solid floor or ground, but it still felt like endless darkness. No actual floor, walls, or ceiling. About twenty feet in front of me stood the old woman who had given me the money, who I had seen three times now, including this nightmare. She just stared at me. She stared at me with those bizarre turquoise eyes. It felt like an eternity but it must have been only five seconds.

She extended her cupped hand to reveal a small, black kitten. It must have been only a few days old. It was squealing like newborn kittens do, wanting its mother or to be fed. I hesitated for a moment, but the squealing wouldn’t stop. I didn’t know why the old woman wasn’t doing anything about it. She just held the kitten forward, wanting me to take it. A nurturing part of myself took over, so I extended my cupped hand. Without either the old woman or I moving from our places, the black kitten appeared in my hand.

Still squealing, I held it close. “Shhhh, it’s okay” I said to it. I held it close to my chest and began to gently pet it with my other hand. The kitten gradually became quiet and started purring. I looked back up at the old woman. She was still just staring at me.

After a moment, the kitten went silent. It must have fallen asleep. Then, it happened. The fire. My hands began to burn. The kitten had self-combusted. It started screaming a vocalization of pain I had never heard before. A scream I couldn’t recognize as a human or non-human animal. It was warped. It sounded like more than one living thing screaming in utter pain. I dropped the kitten and it hit the floor. I felt horrible for dropping it, but my hands were literally burning from it. It continued to scream. I looked up again at the old woman, she was now smiling. Grinning.

The kitten became silent once again, and the fire burned out. Its charred body sat there lifeless, smoldering. Once again, I looked up, and the old woman’s face now appeared maybe an inch in front of mine. This woke me. I jolted up in my bed in a sweat. The nightmare had felt so real. So unnerving. It was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced.

I took a moment to gather myself before getting out of bed with some deep breathing. I showered and then made some coffee. I sat at my kitchen table still collecting myself. I decided I needed to get out and move around. Maybe get some more coffee across the street to get my dopamine levels high. I walked over to my window to see if the coffee shop was busy or not. I froze. In front of the coffee shop, a man was talking with the same old woman. The feeling that had overtaken me previously before was now panic. The old woman reached into her purse and began to hand the man money. I needed to intervene.

I opened the window and began to yell. “Hey. Hey man. Don’t do it. Don’t talk with her. She’s not ok. She’s trying to trick you. Walk away.” The man looked up at me alarmed and confused. The old woman looked up at me with a subtle yet intense anger. I continued.

“It’s not safe. Don’t do it. Go away. Now.”

The man looked away from me and started to walk backward for a moment, looking at the old woman just as startled as he was looking at me. Then he turned around and speed-walked away. The old woman now turned fully facing my direction, holding the same, angry look. She just stood there, staring at me. I quickly closed the window. As I looked back down in front of the coffee shop, the old woman had disappeared. As I turned around, I saw something on the kitchen table where I had been sitting. I walked over to the table. It was a wrinkled $1 bill with multiple brown, splotchy stains all over it.

I’m not religious. I’m not spiritual. I don’t know if I would consider myself agnostic, or even atheist. I do however believe, as many would agree, that there are some things that simply can’t be explained by (though legitimate) scientific processes. It was clear that something was deeply wrong here. I could continue to let things spiral, or I can try and stop this now while I have control over my own life. Control over the parts of my life I haven’t given up on my own.

I’m not going to accept it, and she’s not here with me at least visibly to hand it back to her. So, I decided to burn it. The easiest way to destroy it. I grabbed a lighter out of a drawer in the kitchen, lit the dollar bill on fire, and tossed it into the metal basin of my kitchen sink. It burned, and then, nothing. Nothing in particular happened besides the dollar turning to ash. I looked around my apartment. Nothing. I saw nothing change, and I felt nothing change. I washed the ashes down the drain.

Three knocks were made on my door. I grabbed a kitchen knife nearest to me. I looked through the peephole, no one was standing there. Were they waiting for me around the corner? I decided the best bet was, even if it left me vulnerable, to open my door wide, wait a moment to see if anyone lunges expecting me to walk out, and then run out with my knife. One, two, three. I opened the door. Nothing. I rushed out with the knife and frantically looked back and forth toward both sides of the hallway. No one.

I looked down and saw a square envelope on the ground. I bent down and picked up the envelope. The front was blank. I went back into my apartment and quickly locked the door. I opened the envelope and pulled out what seemed to be a page torn out of a small notebook. It read:

“She got me too - 137 \[redacted\] St.”

Truly, reading that, I felt less alone. Though the overall situation was still fucked, if this person was being honest, they were also going through something the old woman had done to them. If it was a trap, then I shouldn’t go to the address at all, right? Especially not right now, when they are expecting me. However, I knew I couldn’t wait for things to get worse. My reality was being distorted. I needed to act while I could. I grabbed my keys, put my jacket on, and put the knife in the inner pocket. I would go to the address now.

I pulled up to the address parking across the street. It was a fairly plain one-floor home. Light beige-painted brick with some grey siding. White garage doors. Some bushes near the front windows seemed only partially trimmed. One cheap rainbow was in the dirt where the bushes were planted, blowing in the breeze. I walked up the short, worn asphalt driveway to the front door. Before knocking, I tried to see into the windows from where I was standing, but it was too dark inside. I knocked, three times. No one answered. I knocked again. No one answered. I stood there for a moment, thinking what to do next. I put my ear up to the door to see if I could hear anyone inside, doing anything at all. It was silent. I tried the doorknob. As though it was well-oiled, the turn of the knob made its clicking sound and the door slid slightly open. It was as though the door was telling me “Please, come in.”

I carefully took a few steps inside. “Hello?” I called out. No one responded. There was a hallway in front of me lined with family photos on each side. From where I stood I couldn’t make out the faces in the pictures. The hallway led to what I partially could see as a vinyl-floored kitchen with old wooden cabinets. To my left was a hallway with dark green carpeting that I’m assuming led to bedrooms. To my right was an entranceway to a room that bent around the left corner. I would try there first.

I slowly walked in. When I could fully see the room, I stopped and took it in. The room smelled of cigarettes. To my right, there was an old behemoth of a TV maybe from the 1990’s that was turned off, sitting on a TV stand that had a doily tablecloth draped over it. To my left was an armchair with a TV stand next to it with a remote sitting on top. I couldn’t make out the armchair color. Dark olive green? Off-brown? Laying on the ground in front of the armchair, sprawled out, was the old lady.

The blood was fresh and being soaked up fairly quickly in the old shag carpet. Where the blood didn’t create a shade of crimson, the carpet matched the light beige of the outside of the house. It was a relief honestly. The blood dulled the smell of the cigarette residue that had been built up in the carpet for what I can assume to be decades. Whoever did this really wanted to get the job done. They not only slit the old woman’s throat but both her wrists as well. Her children and grandkids, and others I assume were in the photos in the entrance hallway, won’t be too happy about this; but many more people will sigh, feeling an immense weight lifted off their shoulders.

I heard something, what sounded like a wooden door from the direction of the bedrooms hallway closed. I began to hear light footsteps on the carpet. I bolted out of there, out the front door which I left open, to my car, and sped down the road not looking back.

Two weeks had gone by. I read online from a local news outlet that the police found the scene at the old woman’s house and that the investigation is ongoing. In any other circumstance, I would have reported it to the authorities, especially as I didn’t want to be framed for something I didn’t do. But, this was not a murder. This was someone who put an end to a malevolent force. How would I be able to explain any part of what I went through to the police anyway? I would not only be charged with murder but most likely thrown in a psychiatric ward for an even longer time than I would have serving time in a regular prison. I thought if the police were to arrest me, so be it. Till then, I was a free man. Free of what the old woman was doing and was planning to do to me. Going forward, I told myself I would not do the right thing. I would not return dropped money. I would not take it either. Dropped money, helping an elderly person cross the street, it’s simply not happening. I’m not going to be the good guy or the bad guy.

I started going to recovery meetings to address my gambling addiction, and I already noticed my life starting to improve. For once in my life I started to be more confident in myself and my abilities. I even applied for a job that not only paid more but aligned with my passions and interests. I got an offer and I let them know I could start the following week. 

I woke up on a Sunday feeling refreshed. I got up and made some coffee and sat near the window to watch people pass by. The wind was making the trees sway, and the leaves rushed down the sidewalk. The coffee shop across the street was moderately busy with people lining up inside to escape the cold and warm their hands with a mug of the shop’s fresh brew. I finished my cup of coffee and went over to put it in the sink. When I placed my cup in, I saw something crumbled up sitting in the drain. I used my index and middle fingers and successfully pulled it out. Once it was in my hand, I unfolded what appeared to be a piece of paper, which I then discovered to be a $1 bill.
