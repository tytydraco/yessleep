I have been living in San Francisco for a month now and I have been loving the waymo driverless cars. I just think driverless cars are amazing and I am addicted to using them. They are much better than regular taxi drivers and they are much more efficient and I just love them. I am also surprised how the rest of the world aren’t going crazy for them but I guess it will take time to reach everyone. I have heard all the bad things about driverless cars but that hasn’t turned me off at all. I am sure that the job losses will be huge when they become more mainstream.

I remember waking up early to get to a restaurant and I ordered a waymo uber and the car arrived within a minute. I couldn’t believe how quick it was and I went into the waymo car without any problem. I pressed the button signalling that I was ready to go and I have been to this restaurant before and so it was nothing new. I was meeting up with some friends to have a meal with them. I was feeling a bit tired and so I nodded off a little bit.

When I woke up I suddenly realised that the waymo driverless car took me in the wrong direction. I was nowhere near the restaurant and I was literally outside San Francisco. Now I was thinking about all of the down sides of using driverless cars and there was no driver at the seat, it was just the car driving on its own to some other unknown place. I forced myself to have some faith and I went back to sleep hoping that when I wake up, I will be in the right place.

Instead the car stopped for a stranger and the door opened up for her and I told her that she couldn’t come in, as it was my ride and not hers. She still came in though and she complained that her tears were really hurting her. I was in some area where there were lots of forests and I was feeling rather uncomfortable. The woman in the front seat was complaining about her tears really hurting her and she showed me her face.

Her tears were heavily acidic and it was scarring her face and because of the pain it was causing her more pain. It was a vicious cycle. Then the waymo car stopped and the door opened and she was some how pushed out. I kind of just had to accept that I was in some other weird place and that maybe I would never get back to San Francisco. Then my phone started getting late messages and it was from waymo.

I couldn’t believe it and the messages were from the waymo driverless car telling me that it was here and that it is waiting for me. Then that means that the car that I am inside of right now, isn’t a waymo driverless car. I should have checked my phone before stepping into the car. I then noticed that the car interior had completely changed and now there is a driver actually driving the car, he wasn’t here before.

“would you like it if I drive this car into the lake?” the driver told me

“No I want to go back” I replied

“what a lame person you are. Okay then ill take you back” and he drove me back to san Francisco and as soon as I got out, the driver and the car had completely disappeared.
