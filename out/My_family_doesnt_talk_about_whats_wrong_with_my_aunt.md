I don’t really tell people this because it sounds insane, but this is something my family has lived with for years.

My aunt lives alone in my grandparents’ old wooden house. The house is quiet in the day but at night it feels wrong. Like the air is heavier. Family members visit her sometimes but nobody ever stays long. You just don’t feel safe there, even if nothing is happening.

When I was a kid I had sleep there whenever there's family gathering

At night I would hear her talking from the hallway. At first I thought she was just praying. But then I realised she was having full conversations. Whispering. Arguing. Sometimes laughing softly.

Then she would suddenly go quiet. Like she was listening to someone answer.

Then she would reply again, using words I didn’t understand. Not malay. Not English. Nothing I recognised. It didn’t sound panicked either. It sounded… familiar. Like this wasn’t new to her.

I remember hiding under the blanket, sweating, just waiting for morning.

I asked my dad once what was wrong with her. He didn’t look at me. He just said, “A jinn.”

Before all this, my aunt was normal. Actually more than normal. She was really smart. Top student. Talented at drawing, like scary good. Everyone thought she would have a great future.

She failed her college entrance exam.

She took it really hard. Rode her bicycle for hours every day to go to cram school. Rain, heat, didn’t matter. She tried again.

She failed again.

After that she changed completely.

She would suddenly get angry and destroy things. Throw plates, smash glass, scream. One time she gathered every photo of herself as a young girl and burned them outside. Slowly. Calmly. Like she was erasing proof she ever existed.

The family brought ustaz to do ruqyah. Many times. Some left early. One of them said the thing inside her had already “settled in her heart”. That it wasn’t just attached anymore.

Then one night she spoke in a voice that was not hers.

Lower. Slower. Very confident.

She said there was a keris hidden in the house and told them exactly where it was. A place nobody remembered. When they checked, it was there.

Exactly there.

The ustaz said it was shirik. My grandfather took the keris to a river at night and threw it away while praying. He thought that would end everything.

It didn’t.

Later, my great-grandmother admitted something terrible. My great-grandfather had been feeding a jinn for years. Offerings. Rituals. He wanted to pass it down to his sons.

My grandfather refused.

So it went to my aunt instead.

They sent her to a mental hospital. Doctors checked her and said she was sane.

She told them calmly, “I’m not crazy. The minister wants me. He wants to marry me.”

Even now, at night, you can hear her whispering prayers. Crying. Then stopping suddenly, like she’s listening. Then answering back.

Old people say during British rule some people made pacts with jinn for protection and power. They didn’t understand you can’t control something like that.

You don’t borrow power.

You invite something to stay.

My grandfather tried to break it by trusting only Allah. But that house is still not quiet at night.

And whatever is there sounds like it’s been there for a very long time.



Edit:Right now whatever it is seems tied to my aunt. She’s old and very sick, and honestly that’s what scares the family. We don’t know what happens after. No one knows who it would go to, or if it even follows normal rules.
In our belief, these things exist around us all the time. You can’t see them with human eyes, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there.
