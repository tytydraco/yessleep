I am a student. I study abnormal psychology at a university I won’t name. And I’m not gonna lie to you; I am not holding it together very well. I’ll disclose as much as the fact that I live and study in the United States, and the university is a pretty expensive one. My finances have been stretched to the very limit, and the studies are so demanding I work my job at basically the minimum number of hours I’m allowed to. My diet this year has consisted almost completely of ramen and cooked vegetables. Good thing ramen is cheap, cause I absolutely fucking love it. Slurping up those slippery, wet strings of wheat, feeling the broth running through my mouth, lighting up all of my taste buds and soaking them in meaty delight, and gulping all of it down along with those juicy, oily strings. Ramen is my fuel man.

But I digress. The reason I’m telling you about my economic struggles is because that’s what motivated me to participate in a very odd experiment a professor in my department was undertaking. I was strolling to my first class that morning, ramen lunch in my backpack, kinda stressed and kinda tired. My friend and I were gonna throw big party that weekend, and of course we had to have some alcohol and food for the occasion, so to save up enough money I’d ditched the coffee. Bad fucking idea for a student.
On my way to class however, an absolutely disgusting poster caught my attention. Across the top was printed, and I quote: “LET US CONVINCE YOU TO EAT THIS”. But the thing that made the poster so eye-catching was the image. In the centre of the poster, taking up most of the space, was a high definition photo of a bucket… full of slugs. Real gross ones too. Slimy, greasy, wretched creatures. The kind that leave super sticky, rancid slime in their wake. Leopard slugs. Writhing over one another, swimming around in their own as if it was a putrid sea; the multitude of curvy, wrinkly slugs kinda made it look like waves permeated the surface, and the bucket wall was lined with an ungodly spume. I could only imagine the smell, it must be sickening. And they want to convince me to *eat* the fucking things? No way. I dwelled on the image for too long and ended up gagging. A little undigested ramen spurted out of my throat into my mouth. I love ramen, but the stringy feel of it does not mix well with the taste of stomach acid. I swallowed quickly and looked at the bottom of the poster. Written inside a text box (probably to remove the enticing offer from the revolting subject matter): *$500 as reward for participation*. I needed that money. I decided to check it out after my classes.

My last class was finished, and I walked over to the office of the professor undertaking the slug experiment. The door was half-open, but I knocked anyway, as you do.

“Yes?”

“Hi, I’m here for the slug experiment you’re conducting? I’m considering participating.”

“Ah yes, have a seat.”

I took the seat in front of his desk. There was nothing strange about him, no air of insanity, despite the crazy experiment.

“Do you have any questions about the experiment? Since you’re only *considering*.” He made air quotes while saying that, then smiled.

“Yeah uh, the money, do you get it only if you… eat the slugs, or is it enough to just participate at all?”

“You only need to participate. If you want you can get the money as soon as the experiment starts. The goal of the experiment isn’t to *make* you eat the slugs, rather, it is see if there exists any method to convince a healthy individual to perform an action he under normal circumstances would absolutely refuse to do. There is nothing special about the bucket of slugs, it was simply the most repulsing thing we could think of. That is the goal of the experiment, to gain insight into the mechanics of repulsion and persuasion. Don’t worry, we will in no way *coerce* you into eating the slugs. The only thing we will do is attempt to *convince* you to do so.”

“Alright that’s fine by me. Uh, where do I sign up?” He produced a document for me to sign from one of his shelves. I breezed through the agreement and signed it. He took a brief look at it and put it in a different shelf.

“Great! What time suits you?” He smiled at me again.

“Uh, I guess tomorrow after class is fine. I am available at about… 4:50PM.”

“That works, just meet me at 5 and I’ll take you to the testing area.”

“Alright.” I got up and waved goodbye as I left his office.

At home I sat down with my – you guessed it – ramen dinner in front of YouTube and browsed through. As chance would have it, I was recommended a video on… Slugs! 
Oh, what luck! *Guess I can check out what’s in store for me tomorrow*, I thought to myself. As David Attenborough yapped on about how slugs have sex, I was sitting there – ramen in mouth – pondering a bit on the experiment. Exactly how *were* they gonna “gain insight into the mechanics of repulsion and persuasion”? Were they just gonna try to talk me into eating the slugs? Or were they gonna employ different means? Hypnosis maybe? Then again, hypnosis isn’t exactly persuasion. I didn’t think on it for too long however. The taste of ramen does that to me. I just finish the bowl fast, mind empty, thinking of nothing other than the rich, savoury taste of broth and noodles, then go back to whatever I was doing. I gulped the ramen down as the documentary clip continued.

*… and start to slide down on a rope of mucus…*

The stringy goodness slid down my throat…

*… each everts its male organ from just behind its head…*

… and my mouth salivated from the broth flowing through my mouth…

*… these grow longer and longer…*

… All finished.

The next day I was kinda tensed up. I knew I didn’t have to eat the slugs, and I knew there was absolutely no way they could convince me to eat it, but no matter what, I *would* in fact be witnessing those filthy slugs wriggling around in that disgusting bucket in person. It was hard for me to focus in class, albeit that might be because of my idiotic coffee abstinence.

Class was finished, and it was the moment of truth. I headed down to the slug professor’s office.

“Ah there you are, we’ll start the experiment shortly. Just come with me.” He told me this without looking up from his papers, and as we walked down the corridors of the university he kept on reading. Eventually we got to the “lab” or testing area. We entered. I could see two rooms, a small one – presumably for the observers – and a big room – for the participant.

“If you will please enter the left door and shut it on your way in. We will communicate with you through a speaker inside. The door will not be locked and you can abort the experiment and leave at any time you want, and you’ll receive the money.” Without waiting for a response, the professor entered the observation room, and when the door opened I could see a couple of students waiting inside, along with a man the same age as the professor, who I didn’t recognize. Big department.
I entered the testing room. It had white tile walls and the floor was made of that cheap, easily cleaned plastic floor, with a drain in it off-centre. There was a big screen embedded in the wall, and a few speakers in the upper corners. There were also cameras, multiple, different kinds. And some other things hanging there, couldn’t identify them.  In the centre was a little table, and there it was. The illustrious bucket. I hadn’t even seen inside it yet, but the *sound* I could already hear was enough to make me not want to stay in there for another second. Nevertheless, I was getting a fair amount of cash for this, so I’d like to give them their money’s worth. I moseyed over to the table. There must have been hundreds of slugs in that bucket. Slimy, rancid, frantically slithering over one another. It even looked like they had been mutilating each other, I could see little bits of slug billowing around in between them, some glistening with mucus, others dry and semi-hard at the edges. My glance turned into a stare, and I’m sure my revolted expression put the observers into action. The speaker activated, and someone behind the one-way mirror spoke into their mic.

“Now if you will, please proceed.”

“Proceed how?”

“Please eat a slug for us.”

“… No thanks.”

“Won’t you please? Just one slug. We’re giving you half a grand remember?”

“Yeah but you said I’d get that money no matter what I do.”

“True, but please just eat one. As a favour.”

At first I thought maybe I could. Leopard slugs are safe to eat for humans (which I learned from a Fear Factor episode from yesterday’s leopard-slug-related-content binge), and I’m not the most skittish type. But looking down at the bucket again, that thought quickly faded.

“Again, no thanks.”

The speaker didn’t respond. I stood there in silence for a few seconds, looking at a part of the mirror that was not my own reflection. Then a different voice took the mic.

“What’s your favourite food?”

“Pizza.”

“Is that the food you eat the most?”

“No, that would definitely be ramen.”

“How often?”

“Basically every day.”

“Please describe your experience when you eat ramen.”

“Uhm… When I put the noodles in my mouth I can feel that they are soft, uh, warm, and savoury, you know like umami or whatever. When I bite them my teeth go through them effortlessly, turning them into little bits, and when I swallow I can feel the little bits sliding down my throat. When I’ve finished the noodles I usually drink up the broth too, which is also savoury and warm.”

“Would you say you enjoy eating ramen a lot?”

“Yeah.”

“Thank you.”

Another pause. A few more seconds passed, and suddenly I could sense the faintest of smells that hadn’t been there before. A very recognizable scent. Ramen. The previous voice returned.

“Please turn your attention towards the screen to your left. There is a video we’d like you to watch.” 

Untroubled, I turned and looked at the screen. The lights dimmed, and a video began.

At first there was a still of a black background and a single, small slug. With a single tone, this cut to a similar still, only with two slugs. Then three, four, five, each cut with tones in random pitches. The number kept increasing, and the new ones appeared in a seemingly random location. Eventually the background was no longer visible. Then the frames were reversed in quick succession, the amount of slugs going back down one at a time. At the last slug I heard three tones instead of one. The last slug stayed, and the background begun fading into random colours, while audio that sounded like an artificial voice played. It was almost words, but it wasn’t quite like anything you’d expect even a completely different language to sound like. I have no idea what it was. Finally there was a bright flash, and the video ended.

I noticed that the smell of ramen was even stronger now.

“How did the video make you feel?”

“Mostly just weirded out. I thought there was supposed to be no hypnosis involved?”

“Don’t worry, hypnosis only works with willingness and engagement. The video has nothing to do with hypnosis.”

Just as he said that, one slug fell out of the bucket. I flinched, but I noticed that I felt a sudden rush of excitement.

“Would you please eat a slug for us now? Only one, it’s all we need.”

“… Okay. Fine.” I thought what the hell, I had done worse in my previous career as a reckless teen. I cautiously lowered my hesitating hand into the bucket and picked one up with two fingers. It was very soft, so I had to squeeze tightly into it to hold it, and it was slimy and slippery too. Looking at it, it coiled frantically, smearing its ends all over my two fingers. I held it closer to my face, and I could swear that it had a very faint smell that was… savoury.
Uselessly looking into the mirror, I slowly brought it to my mouth. I held my breath and quickly chomped on it so it wouldn’t writhe around in my mouth. As fast as I could I chewed just enough to be able to swallow it in one big gulp. It was disgusting, but not too difficult.

Immediately a new video begun playing, louder than the last, and a new smell appeared in the room, a more sterile and chemical one.  The video showed about ten living slugs on a food plate, and an artificial voice kept saying “So tasty, so good!” over and over.

The speaker came back on, and I had to concentrate to hear it through the noise from the video.

“That wasn’t so bad was it? Now eat another one. Please, we really need this. Just do it this once.”

The begging, the video, and the smell all assaulting my senses began stressing me out.

“I just ate one slug, which was already more than I had to. I’m-”

“Alright, alright. Just pace around the room for three rounds and then we’ll let you go.”

And I did. Just three rounds. The video ensured that I wasn’t able to think much to myself. But at the third lap I thought I heard something in the corner. It was a faint sound, coming from the corner. I walked over to investigate, and sure enough. It was coming from one of the speakers. I went to the other corner. It was coming from all the speakers. A very quiet voice, which sounded exactly like my own. 

“I love eating slugs, I love eating slugs”. Over and over. Had this been playing the entire time?

The speaker activated again. The same artificial voice spoke again, at first the same meaningless jumble, but then it suddenly spoke English.

“Eat the slugs.”

I was tired of this. I just wanted to get it over with.
I approached the bucket, and shoved my hand right into it. I grabbed a fistful of wiggling slugs and shoved it into my mouth. Before I knew it the taste filled my mouth. I was self-aware, I was doing this willingly, and yet it felt so foreign. And that’s when I noticed the taste. It was delicious. The cold and pungent slime got smeared and stuck on the surfaces inside my mouth, the slug skin was coarse and yet soft, and so wet and oily. When I chewed down, the innards exploded out, filling me with an incredible bitter taste, and it made the other slugs in my mouth writhe even harder. When I swallowed, the mass in my throat was so chunky and soggy, and it coated everything it touched with a delightful layer of goo. I clutched another mass of slugs and slurped them up from my hand, like you would spaghetti, except slugs are much thicker so you need to use more force to suck them in with your lips. They stretched and squeezed through them into my mouth, and their slime got stripped off on the way in and it gathered around my mouth. I shoved fistful after fistful into my mouth, swallowing them whole. My body obviously did not want them, so I had to swallow my gags and the little bits of slug body and slug liquid that came up. All the while, the taste and mouthfeel were amazing. Eventually there were only the mutilated slug bits left, almost floating around in a mass of secretion, like Jell-O that hadn’t fastened properly. I picked up the bucket and let it slowly slide into my mouth. I gulped down this stew of rancid slime and slug bits despite my digestive protests. The bucket was empty. I had eaten the entire thing.

The video wasn’t playing anymore. The smells were gone.

“Thank you for your participation. We’re finished, so please exit the room.”

I wouldn’t say that I came to my senses, because I hadn’t lost control in any way. I was very much myself during the entire process, but *something* had obviously changed. I left the room and the professor came out.

“Thank you very much. You’ve given us valuable data that I think will contribute greatly to our study.”

He handed me five hundred dollars in cash. Kind of informal if you ask me, I expected a bank transfer or something like that. But I took it.

“What kind of study are you doing exactly?”

“Like I said. We want to understand the mechanics of repulsion and persuasion.”

He had left the door to the observation room open. I glanced inside and saw that the other older guy wasn’t there anymore.

“Who are the other guys in there?”

“Just colleagues from the lab. This isn’t a university project, we are just borrowing the facility.”

“Then what organization is this for?”

“We’re funded by the Human Ecological Research Institute. Just a psychological research non-profit.”

Hadn’t heard of them.

“… Alright. Well, I’ll be going now.”

I grabbed my stuff.

“Goodbye! Thanks for your participation. I hope you’ll be open to more in the future.”

He smiled at me. I just waved and left.

On my way home I saw a slug making its way along the roadside. I stopped to look at it for a bit. I felt nothing. It was gross. It felt weird to know that I had hundreds of it in my stomach in that very moment.

This weekend I’m gonna get blasted.
