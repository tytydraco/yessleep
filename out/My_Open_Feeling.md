 I woke up with a headache like most mornings and stumbled through my morning routine.  Silence permeated the house as I quickly washed my hair and tried to ignore the cold sound of my parent's footsteps as they passed each other without saying a word.  Ahh.  The "non-sounds" of my house.

I slogged downstairs to have lackluster cereal and grind through another morning convo with my mom.

"You ready for finals?"

"We're studying tonight."

"Oh.  You and Molly weren't upstairs the other day studying?"

"Nope.  It was just me."

'Mother' gave her famous solemn look she gives when she gets another reminder of her lack of perceptiveness about her own family.  I got up to leave as soon as I felt her eyes linger on me.

"Text me so I know you're okey!"

"Sure mom."

 \*\*\*\*\*

   Describing the "open" feeling to people was like trying to beg your mom to give up cigarettes during menopause while she insists "I only smoke when I drink", not realizing she drinks wine every day.  I asked my mom what it meant to feel more alone than alone, to feel Like you were standing in a vast canyon despite being in a room the size of a closet, and like the room was giving you permission to do whatever you wanted without judgement.  My mother told me I was depressed, and that she would take me to see someone "before it got worse".  I became aware that mom was a bad listener pretty quick because I wasn't sure what "got worse" meant as I didn't feel like this was a negative situation.  I loved this feeling and decided to call it the open feeling because it made me feel so........open.

   In my teens, I leaned into my "diagnosis" and embraced my identity as the edgy sick girl who reveled in the mystery that there might be something darker beneath the surface.  I embraced this fake rage until I entered high school, where my guidance counselor told me I might just be feeling another type of synesthesia (A condition where you see colors and see sounds....), but that I'm sensing past events in the rooms.  I had nothing else to go off of, so I just agreed to leave his office.  I secretly thought he was full of shit because the open feeling was always the same feeling of just being more alone, but in a good way.  I didn't feel the open feeling in most places, and the places I did feel it, were only temporary.

\*\*\*\*\*

"Hey!!  Did you bring the books?"  
"Yesssss!!!  God!  Why didn't we Just study like normal people??!!"

"LOL!!  Calm down!  We're good crammers!"

It was the weekend before finals, and Molly and I decided to stay at our school late and study as to not become drifters to the world.  I was meeting her after our little cram sessions and going to hang out at my house for some weekend "hijinks".  I needed to unwind as today felt especially bland and gloomy.  It was hard to describe, but this walk to school didn't feel like a normal walk.  I did feel the open feeling outside at times, but today just felt rather plane.

\*\*\*\*\*

   I had managed to carve out a small friend-group, and although they didn't understand me or my preoccupation with how empty a room is, they were my life for the majority of my teen years.   Molly, Tara, and I had the type of relationship that you'd think we always just met the week before, and we were about to go on a trip to London to see a castle that we weren't sure existed, but we were just happy to be on the trip.  You'd expect me to say, 'it feels like we've known each other forever', but I always felt that to be an odd saying; 'Really?  You've known each other forever?  Wow!  You must be sick of them!'

   We used to spend time at Molly's house as her parents were always working, giving us the freedom to enjoy our "special" vices.  This, unfortunately, had to stop due to her parents not liking "the vibe" I brought over a few years ago.  I was told it had nothing to do with me and that it was just a gut feeling, and I shouldn't take it personally.  Why would I take it personally??  It's not like they had a reason; they just hate my general being, nothing offensive or anything. Oddly enough, this did happen after I stopped feeling the open feeling at her house.

   I didn't really mention the open feeling too much at this time as I didn't need to freak out the people who thought more of me than just "that weird girl".  I kept my sensations to myself and journaled when I felt this feeling, which wasn't that hard. The feeling started to become rarer as time went on and there were weeks where it didn't even come to mind.

\*\*\*\*\* 

   I was sitting in an empty class trying to brush up on my calculus with one of our friends, Tara, who had fallen asleep waiting for me to get done, and without someone on my back to leave, I lost track of time.  I received a text from Molly;

"Yo!!!  I think someone is watching me!!!"

"Really!!??  Is it anyone you recognize!!"

"IDK!!  I just have that feeling!!"

I've heard this before.....'The feeling of being watched.'  I never bought into that.  How do you feel another's eyes on you?  I guess I'm one to talk.  I've been describing a feeling that only seems normal to mystics and hippies my whole life.

"Just come to the classroom!  Tara and I are still here waiting."

"How are you guys still there?! It's pretty much empty!!"

\*\*\*\*\*   

   The cycle of the open feeling was; go to new place, experience the personal phenomena of complete openness in such a closed space, feel the feeling disappear, tell the people around me, have the people treat me differently, have the people avoid me, and wonder how a room with such an intense vibe can become just a normal room.  My mom did suggest schizophrenia, which was dismissed due to lack of other symptoms.  The feeling was hard to explain if you didn't feel it.  It's sort of like explaining Deja vu to someone who has never felt it.  Explaining a random moment that triggers a strange sensation of having experienced this moment once before is easy when the moment is caused by looking at an old photo of a relative but is much more difficult to explain when it's caused by someone calling you an asshole while you have another potato chip.  It felt more strange thinking about the rooms I felt this feeling in my high school.

   The open feeling was the reason I used to love going to English class.  Mrs. Lundy's room always felt so open despite having no windows and very few vents.  For whatever reason, the least open rooms are where I always felt the most open.  Maybe it was not being able to look outside and had less distractions that gave me the mental clarity to feel this feeling.  It was sad when the feeling went away after six months.

\*\*\*\*\*

   I tried to finish so by the time Tara woke up, we could just meet up with Molly and ring in the weekend, but I wasn't fast enough.  Tara's eyes opened as I was trying to scribble my last few practice answers for my English final, and she seemed more on edge than I've seen her in a long time.

"How long have we been here?!"

"Just a few hours.  You've been sleeping like you're avoiding something."

Tara touched my arm the way you would touch an anxious lover.

"I think we should leave......I feel weird!"

"Don't worry, I'm just finishing a couple questions, and we'll meet up with Molly."

"Molly's here!?  I want to go!  Why didn't you wake me up earlier?!!!"

"I was still working!  I didn't think it would matter!"

Tara just sat back and put her hands over her eyes and began to breath like she just had a jalape√±o hot enough to kill and bring herself back to life.  The last time I heard Tara breath like this was on our camping trip last summer when we got lost on a hike and had to stumble around in the dark for hours to find our way back to camp.  We heard the sound of twigs snapping and Tara was sure we were being followed.  I tried to calm her down, but she just ran into the night.   I got another text from Molly.

"DUDE!!!  I'm running by the quad!  I hear someone's footsteps!!"

  \*\*\*\*\*

   My tradeoff to having the open feeling appeared to be having no understanding of the complex feelings of my loved onse, which left me isolated from alot of pepople.  I could relate to many things, but abstract fears left me confused.  Why did my parents always convey a sense of dread around me?  Why did I always get a sense that my friends have been keeping something from me?  Why couldn't anyone understand what I was feeling throughout my life?  

The first time I experienced the open feeling was when I was taken to pre-school and told to wait in the office for the teacher.  I felt it the second my mom left the room and twirled around in circles the whole ten minutes I was alone.  I felt it in any room I was left alone in and remember it all too well when it stopped coming.  It was like I was supposed to feel something important, and the message couldn't stay too long.

\*\*\*\*\*

   I finished my practice quiz, tugged on Tara to make our way to the hallway.  Tara seemed cautious which made me feel I should be cautious in the way I always had acted to calm down the people around me.  I got another text from Molly, which made Tara screech like she saw a demonic snake.

"I called the cops!!  I saw the dude sneaking around the lunch area!!"

"Where are you!?"

"I locked myself in Miss Lundy's room!  I heard a scream!!  Was it Tera!!??"

"LOL!!  Yesssss!  You scared her!!"

"I'd get away from where you are!!  NOW!!  I did see someone!  Try getting to Lundy's room.  We can chill till the police get here!"

I guess that settled it.  I'm the broken one.

Tara and I crept towards Lundy's room wondering how serious we should take Molly's claim.  Tara seemed to be less skeptical than me, so I just went with the flow to avoid another freak out.  We made it one-hundred feet when I heard a snap in the distance behind us.

Tara and I began to sprint into the dark unknown of these familiar halls and began to hear the steps keeping pace with us as if we were racing for the last seat on the bus.  The dude sounded like he was purposely keeping distance from us as if this were a game meant for only one person, and it wasn't either of us.  During this Corralling session, I couldn't help but notice how, despite being in a dire situation, these halls didn't feel that different.  I've always heard that stuff like this was supposed to taint familiar places, but aside from the fear of being chased, I didn't feel all that different.

I led Tara to a place I had made into a 'personal safe space' to be alone when things were a little tough, where no one seemed to know about, and where the open feeling never seemed to disappear.  I took us through the dark maze of the woman's locker room to find the hidden entrance to the school's bomb shelter that even James Bond wouldn't be able to find.

We crawled through the entrance and felt around in the dark until we found some chairs in the corner. "Holy shit!  I hate this!  Why did we stay here?!  Fuck finals!!"

"I know!!  I'm sorry!!  Molly says the police are coming, and I led us down a pretty crazy path! You couldn't just stumble onto it!"

"Who do you think it was!!??"

It was after Tara's question, that I felt that familiar feeling of something vanishing.  It was as if I had come into room with purpose, only to forget what that purpose was.  I was confused until nearby footsteps shook the realization that the open feeling disappeared.

\*\*\*\*\*

   I always felt a certain tension when the open feeling would just vanish like a random fart from a stranger.  It left me wondering if I had been crazy this whole time or if I had had some sort of mystical experience that was supposed to feel like a dream.  I always figured I had to learn something, and that these were just breadcrumbs to something bigger in my life.  It wasn't till recently that followed these breadcrumbs to discover what actually caused the open feeling.

\*\*\*\*\*

   Tara and I stampeded towards the exit while screaming as if trying to scare away the reality of being hunted by "Phantom" of the school.  We sprinted through the dark labyrinth of these familiar halls, hoping to find something we recognized, but could only move our feet in this state our frantic state of mind.  We turned a corner and saw a light in the distance that acted as our north star.  Closer!  Closer! Closer, until we busted through the front doors of the school into the sanctuary of lights that were now flashing.

"Go!!!" "Get on the ground!!!"

Tara and I curled up in a ball as a barrage of figures sprinted past us to pounce on a masked figure trying to run in the opposite direction.

   The man was a custodian who worked at the hospital I was born in, and had been stalking my family, with certain interest with me, ever since he walked by the maternity ward.  We all expected a certain religious psychosis to be involved but he seemed relatively put together, minus the stalking.  He ran a local chapter of the red cross and gave away most of his inherited wealth to live like he made a vow of poverty.  We discovered a little area in the trails behind my home that gave him access to my bedroom window, as well as keys to my school and other places I might attend.

   The rest of the night felt like someone splashed water on me.  The police took our statements, asking if I'd ever noticed anything weird before, to which I said no.  I never noticed anything.  I never noticed how weird it was for my family to have such a fraught relationship while all my friends seemed to have relatively normal communication.  I never realized why I was never afraid to be alone, or why I what a distant gaze felt like.

   My parents explained that the house always felt a little off, but figured our family didn't vibe with the "feng shui".  Basically, my parents didn't bother to look into this off-putting feeling because of an idea that you had to understand on a visceral level but could not rationally explain.  I relate.

  
 \*\*\*\*\*\*

  
   It had been a year since they caught the man who had been a main background character my whole life, and it took time getting used to.  The open feeling weas hear and never went away.  I felt like an unclogged sink that flowed freely.  I know that sounds cheesy, but it's true.  My only issue is that I now understand what it feels like to have eyes on you.
