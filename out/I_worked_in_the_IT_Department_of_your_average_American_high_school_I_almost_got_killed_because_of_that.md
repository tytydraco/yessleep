I had to have a routine of sorts when it came to my job.

I was in the IT department of an average American high school, which meant that my average day to day tasks usually consisted of blocking unapproved websites and fixing Bluetooth issues. But when it came to the last two hours or so of the school day, my boss would often ask me for a favor.

"Check their search history," he'd say.

He was referring to all seven hundred students in the high school, thus where my routine came in. Check their search history, flag anything alarming, and alert the principal if necessary. It got boring after a while, since the students would usually search up stupid things on purpose, such as cream cheese pornography or One Direction fanfiction. 

  
Until the date was Thursday the 29th.

That day, the principal insisted that I should take a closer look at the search history of each and every freshman, since they appeared to be logging into various unknown websites more often than usual. Naturally, I did as I was told and was bored for the first twenty minutes or so.

Except when I checked for the 20th student's search history.

He never once searched up anything related to school. And he never once searched up anything unrelated to school. Rather, he just consistently typed one single thing into his search bar.

**Coordinates**

**Geographical Coordinates.**

I did exactly as I was trained to do, and I immediately informed the principal about this. When he stood over my shoulder, however, looking at my computer, his expression never once changed.

"The proper term these days is 'trolling', correct?" He asked. "In that case, the kid is probably just trolling you as usual. Their actions don't exactly have thought behind them."

I didn't know for certain if whether or not he was wrong. So, on my evening commute home, I decided to whip out my personal laptop, and plug in the geographical coordinates into Google Earth myself.

What popped up next was fairly plain.

It was a forest. A heavily patrolled forest at that. It was often used for camping, so it couldn't possibly have been a site for illegal activity or anything concerning. Plus, it was a Thursday night, and all of my friends ended up cancelling what was supposed to be an excellent game night.

So, what was the harm?

I decided to drive over to the forest.

When I arrived, I was instantly greeted by an overly cheery park ranger with a faint southern drawl.

"Hey there, Miss," He said. "What seems to be your reason for being out here so late?" 

"Just wanted to take a walk," I said. "That's all."

"They don't got sidewalks, where you're from?" He smiled.

"Oh, they do," I said. "And they also have park rangers who aren't complete jackasses. You should visit."

The park ranger wasn't exactly phased by my insult. But his expression did change a little once he saw my school employee ID. Not going to lie- I was a little bit embarrassed that I had forgotten to take it off.

"You work in a school?" He asked.

I nodded. "I do, yeah. Specifically in their IT department."

He nodded to himself for a moment or so. As if he was suddenly remembering something.

"My apologies then, Miss," He smiled. "Come on right in."

And he then gave me directions to the nearest parking lot.

Truth be told, I genuinely liked walking around the forest for the first five minutes or so. In fact, I actually even felt grateful at one point for finding that kid's search history, since those five minutes were just so damn peaceful. It was close to closing hours, so besides the park ranger, no one else was walking around. There were also a lot of animal traps around, so I didn't feel the need to worry about skunks or bears or anything like that.

But then I heard a voice.

A deep, dry voice.

"Your plan really did work, son," The voice chuckled. "She's right here."

That's when I heard the whistle. A high pitched, eardrum rattling whistle that could have only come from an instrument of sorts.

Now comes the part where nobody believes me.

Seven people (whether they were men or women, I don't know) began walking towards me, chanting. What they were chanting, I still can't figure out to this day. It sounded almost like an ancient language of sorts- one that you could never find in a textbook. And they all chanted in unison- softly and quietly in perfect harmony. They all wore the exact same outfit, too. Black robe, black capirote, black paint that was painted onto their hands and faces, and no shoes. And only one voice stood out from the others. 

Because that voice sounded like it belonged to a teenager.

You best believe that I began to run away at that exact moment.

As I was running away, two of the seven people began chasing after me. The rest simply continued to walk towards my direction, still chanting. However, the two people that were chasing me were both yelling the exact same sentence at me. 

**"Gloriam eius sentire debes!"**

**"You must feel his glory!"**

They spoke in Latin, by the way. That was the only time they spoke an actual language.

When I reached the parking lot, I saw that they had all stopped chasing me. They were nowhere to be seen, couldn't be heard at all, nothing. You'd think that it was all a bad dream.

But I know it wasn't. I know *damn well* that it wasn't. 

Before I began driving back home, I went up to the same park ranger from before and told him everything that had happened. 

"Aw, don't get so worked up," He chuckled. "We've all gotten the heebie jeebies before, no?"

It was the angriest that I had ever gotten. I just couldn't stop defending myself, I was yelling at him- I *knew* what I saw, I *knew* what I saw!

But he kept on shutting me down. And he kept on refusing to believe me.

That's when I saw that there was black paint underneath his fingernails.

So, I wished the park ranger a good night, and I quit my job the next day.
