I’ve been starting to really get into hiking for around a year now. I’m from western Massachusetts and fortunately we have a good amount of wooded areas and mountains especially in the Berkshires. I know our mountains aren’t as big as the Rockies or the mountains out west “that’s the parking lot to our mountains” and blah blah blah I don’t give a shit they are still beautiful to me and it’s what I grew up with. I go to school in Amherst so it’s cool that a lot of trails are within driving distance. 

A few days ago I was scrolling through the AllTrails app and I saw a place that caught my eye. Mount Norwotuck. It was only a 4ish mile hike up for the Robert Frost trail (orange) so I looked at the pictures of the views from the top and it looked really cool so why not I figured. I packed up my bag with some waters, only 1 bag of chips since it wasn’t gonna be too long, some weed and my rolling papers and drove over to the starting area of the trail. 

It was fine at first. the first half mile in it gets a little steep but nothing too crazy. As many people know while hiking you’ll run into other hikers on the same trail. The common courtesy is wave at them say hello and keep going. At first it felt like a lot of people were on the trail. It’s supposed to be a popular one so I guess it makes sense if anything it makes me feel a little bit safer that if god forbid anything goes wrong someone can be around to help but I also would rather the peace and quiet on my hikes. Either way as I was walking I could have sworn I saw something weird.

Walking past a girl and her boyfriend I waved and said “hey” and when she waved back I felt a strange sense of unease. 

“Di-Did… she have 6 fingers?” I thought to myself bewildered 

I stopped dead in my tracks and looked back but they were already too far away and I couldn’t get a good enough look to be sure that what I saw was real or if it was just my imagination. 

“I must of be crazy I don’t know why I thought I saw that woman have 6 fingers. I gotta get some more sleep.” I said to myself chuckling and just dismissing it.

I kept going up the trail and saw a few more people that all seemed normal passing by me, said my hellos and carried on but slowly less and less people were around me and I started to feel that inner peace you get when you feel you are truly alone in nature and just turn your mind off. 

The trail I’m on around half way seems to go up at an almost 90 degree angle and really takes a lot out of you. At this point it’s been around 30 minutes since I’ve seen another person. A little weird for being a more known trail such a nice day. I decided to take a break and sit down on a rock slightly off the path and roll a joint. I got out my papers and my bud and started breaking down the weed when I looked up to see a guy coming down the trail. He was dressed in a full tuxedo and was whistling a happy tune. 

“Ok what the fuck is this.” I say getting up from my rock to go see why this guy was about 2 miles in on this trail dressed like this.

“Hey dude what the hell are you wearing?” I say confused 

“Well whatever do you mean!? It’s my wedding day OF COURSE I would be dressed for the occasion. Now if you don’t mind I can’t stand here and answer your idiotic questions all day. Good day sir!!” He says and turns around from me and keeps walking down the trail.

“Hey dude I just. I..” I stammer on my words. I don’t even know what to say I’m just perplexed by the whole encounter. Not that he was acknowledging me any way he just kept going until I lost him in the trees. 

At this point I’m thinking I’m losing my mind I mean I could play off that girl having 6 fingers thing as just my eyes playing tricks on me but to have this very real interaction with this guy makes my mind race with possibilities. Was I being pranked or something? is that guy just insane? I decided to just keep going and get to the summit before I let this bother me anymore. I’ve met weird people out on hikes before I guess this’ll just be another story of a weird guy to tell my friends about over some drinks at the bar later.

I finished rolling up my joint, lit it and kept trudging up the steep incline. I had about 2 miles left till I got to the summit and could relax and take in the views. The hike continued on normally. I finished smoking my joint and started to get the munchies. Around the 3 mile marker I stopped and leaned up against a tree so I could eat some chips and drink some water when mere inch’s from my head an arrow strikes the tree I’m leaning against. I instantly get a surge of adrenaline and frantically look around to see where it was shot from when I see a man dressed in full Native American chief clothing and face paint loading up another arrow for his bow. 

In a moment of desperation I drop my hiking gear and bolt up the mountain dodging the man’s arrows as I try to zig zag up the path so he can’t get a good shot on me. I hear him screaming in a language I couldn’t understand. 

“This isn’t happening! This isn’t real!” I yell to myself thinking I had to be having some kind of nightmare. This didn’t make sense. Nothing made sense this couldn’t be happening. Running and running arrow after arrow whizzing by me. I was just begging to wake up and that’s when I tripped. 

I fell and hit my head on a rock. I don’t know how long I was out for and had no clue where I was anymore. I went so far off the trail in my frenzy that I was now completely lost. Even worse it’s starting to get dark. I gotta be close to the summit at this point I was running up the trial for most of the chase. “If I just keep climbing up I can reach the top and get back on the trail then leave this God forsaken mountain.” I thought to myself. So I pulled myself up and made my own trail trudging straight up the incline I was determined to get back. My vision took a little bit to adjust I was seeing 2 or 3 of whatever was in front of me and had this drunken woozy feeling almost as if I was in a building with a gas leak but I continued on anyway. 

The feeling of lightheadedness and my double vision suddenly went away right as I found myself back on the trail and with just my luck a person right ahead of me. I was overjoyed. Finally I was safe I ran to the man screaming and waving my arms to get his attention like a mad man.

“HEY!!  HEY!! HELP I NEED HELP!!” I screamed while running up towards the man who now stopped and turned around 

I get to the man out of breath and with my hands on my knees trying to explain everything.

“THE GUY. TH- HE HAD. TUXEDO! INDIAN!”
I spurt out knowing that nothing I said made any sense. The man put a hand on my shoulder and I looked up. He was a tall man. I mean really tall probably about 6’8-6’10 and was wearing a huge black puffer jacket with a black beanie on his head. 

“It’s ok man everything’s gonna be fine” he said in a deep reassuring voice.

“Everything- everything’s gonna be fine” I say repeating him and finally stand up straight now having finally caught my breath. Just as I start to smile and let myself calm down out of survival mode my shoulder starts feeling wet. I look over to see that the mans hand on my shoulder wasn’t a hand. It was a tentacle. I look back up at the man to see his coat slip off of him and reveal both of his arms up to the shoulders where that of a squids. He swiped at me trying to grab me but I duck and run pass him. Darting up the trail barely being able to see with the sun going down I look back to see that now not only is the squid armed man chasing me but now so is the Indian chief, the tuxedo man, and the 6 fingered girl. “FUCK!” “THIS ISN’T REAL IT’S NOT REAL!” I scream out. I stumbled up an incline to reveal that I did it. I reached the top.

It was beautiful. The view from the top was breathtaking. The lights from Amherst starting to all turn on. The sunset. The hundreds of surrounding mountain ranges as far as the eye could see. However now all I’ve done is cornered myself. Surrounded by these monsters chanting in tongues I couldn’t understand. The only choice I had was to go off the edge or to be at the will of these creatures. They close in on me as I’m backing up on the jagged rocks that lead to the edge of the sharp drop down and I’m left with no choice as they only get closer and closer to me. I jumped.

For the last few days I’ve been recovering in the hospital. The psych ward to be more precise. The doctors said I experienced some sort of psychosis and thought I tried to kill myself by jumping off the top of the mountain. All it did was shatter my arm, break 4 ribs and leave me with a severe concussion. I’ve never had a history of psychotic episodes or any other mental problems. None of this makes any sense to me but I know what I saw was real all of it was real it had to be. The girl, the Indian, the tuxedo guy, the squid guy I mean I know it sounds crazy but you have to believe me. There’s something happening on that mountain. I’m not sure whats going on but I will get to the bottom of this.
