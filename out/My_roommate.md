When I went to college for my studies to become an English teacher, I unfortunately couldn't get a single dorm like I had been hoping. I had never been a person that shared their space considering I was an only child for eighteen years. 

The day I moved in to my dorm and unpacked my things I dreaded about the future roommate I was assigned. I had my doubts because I had never met her prior. She did not show to orientation so I didn't get the chance to know her much. I just knew her name was Avalon. For all I knew, she could have been a slob. I prayed not and an hour passed.

I heared the door knob click and I turned my head while unpacking my last bag. A girl around my age had silently walked in with three big duffel bags. What caught my eye about her at first was her height and slim figure. She was around 5'9 with black hair to her shoulders and pale skin. I gave her a smile. "Avalon?" I asked. She nodded and stuck out her hand "I assume you're Elizabeth?" She asked. I gave a nod in return and shook her hand, her skin was ice cold. We smiled at eachother. 

Not knowing what to say I struck up small talk. 

"What are you going for? I assume education as well" I asked.

"Yes I am actually. I'm studying physics." 

"Ah. You want to be a professor?" 

"Oh yes" she announced "What about you?" 

"I am attending in hopes to teach English to highschool students" I said as I gave a sheepish smile, realizing we do have a little bit in common. She seemed quite reserved.

"We aren't so different then" Avalon remarked as she began putting away her clothes in the dressers on her side of the room. 

"I guess not" I said quietly. I sat down on my bed and began reading a book, "Lord Of the Flies" to be exact. I occasionally peaked up at her because the silence in the room was so loud. She was busy rummaging through her bags and sorting her things. Some time passed and she finally sat down on her bed too. 

"I'm done" she said a tad breathless. I knew she had to have been winded from all of the work she did. I was tired aswell. After some small talk about our life back home I got comfortable in bed, ready for some rest after the long day I had. 

Avalon went to bed along with me. My fears about my roommate eased because we actually got a long. There was just something about her that appeared strange but I passed it off as paranoia.

I rested surprisingly easy that night until around 2am. My eyes shot open because of my unbearable urge to turn on a fan. I bolted my view to the alarm clock on the dresser beside me and checked the time. I was burning up from my head to my feet. I quietly threw the blanket off of myself and rolled over so that my body was facing my roommate. She layed on her bed motionless with her eyes shut so I assumed she was asleep. After I rested there for awhile and cooled down I began to drift off once more and that's when I noticed something. Avalon seemed to be mouthing something in her sleep. I squinted at her so I could try and see her lips. I couldn't make out anything she was saying but that's when she started levitating out of bed. Slowly to the ceiling in her laying position. I closed my eyes tight not believing what I was seeing and blocked out everything around me. I was scared to look. After I heared a quiet thud I opened them once again to see she was back in bed just as she was.

I rolled over again so I was back to my original to position and forced myself to sleep. I had so many thoughts running through my head and so many questions. Was I imagining things because of drowsiness? Was I dreaming? Or was I going insane? How did she LEVITATE?

I shut my mind off and eventually did in hopes of forgetting. I never spoke of what I saw that night. Especially not to her, but I made a mental note and stayed alert. I never chose to stay awake late at night and I always sleep facing away from her intentionally.

The more I share a dorm with her, the stranger I notice she is. I never see her eat or shower for that fact. I could also never find her hometown on a map. I'm starting to think she's not human..
