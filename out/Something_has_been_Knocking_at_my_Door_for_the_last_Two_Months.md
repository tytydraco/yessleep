Every single night at seemingly random times, something knocks on my door. Sometimes it is a heavy, desperate beating, and others it’s quiet and soft. But no matter what I do, it always happens. I’ve sort of grown accustomed to it until recently.

It began about 2 months ago when I had just moved into the home. 1 bed 1 bath, near a relatively quiet street. It was all I could ever dream of. The indications of the past presence of the homeowners still scattered the abode. Old candy wrappers, crumbs and the occasional lost toy or two. But that would be fixed in time.

It was when I was going to bed for the first night there when I heard something. 3 knocks at the front door. They were very, very loud. I thought the house was going to come off the foundation for a moment. Believing it was important, I rushed to the door. I quickly unlocked it as fast as I could.

However, nobody was at the door.

I chuckled to myself, believing it to be just a simple ding dong ditch that some kids pulled on me. Although I thought it strange they didn’t just use the doorbell installed. However, I tiredly jotted back to my bed, awaiting the next day.

That next morning I finally got a moment to meet the community members. One of whom was my next door neighbor Fred. Me and Fred liked eachother right off the bat. We even went to the same college a few years apart. We spent that day talking about our lives when I brought up the knocking that happened last night.

When I brought it up, Fred immediately went from a carefree grin to a concerned gaze. When I asked him what was wrong, he said  “The people before you also complained about knocking a week earlier. I think it’s what motivated them to hurry up with their moving.”

When I asked if they saw anything, Fred just shook his head. “Probably just some troublemakers. I wouldn’t let it concern you.” And with that we said our goodbyes. At that point I had just brushed off the knocking and went back home.

When the knocking happened again, it happened while I was in a deep slumber. 3 knocks even louder then the first. It had woken me up, but I brushed it off as another attempt to prank me. When I woke I barely even remembered the knocking until I was having my morning coffee and saw the window cracked. 

I called the police; however, nothing came of it. No evidence of the culprit or where they went off to. When I asked the officers if this had happened before, they simply said “Nope.” They told me they would be on watch and to keep my doors locked incase they tried to get in.

And with that they were off in their cruisers. Although it became more apparent that whoever these “pranksters” they were determined to make me fall for the trick. Even breaking my window to try and get a rye out of me.

This time I thought they wouldn’t try again because they had already tried with no results. So I went to bed and again I heard 3 knocks. It was much, much quieter. Almost sounding as if the wind itself was doing it. I again bolted to the door and found nobody. No damage to the windows either. 

Over the next 2 months I had grown used to it, thinking whoever was doing it would just give up. However they did not. The same 3 knocks; however, none of them were as loud as the first one. I had just accepted that it was a sacrifice for having such a good house.

That was until the knock happened at my bedroom window. Opening my eyes slowly revealed, nobody was there. Of course I was immediately put on edge throughout the night, not closing my eyes once. 

To say I was tired that morning was an understatement. I needed 3 cups of coffee to even get myself to drive to work. I then got to sleep at the tiny intervals my boss wasn’t watching me. Enough to get me through once work ended.

However, when I wasn’t sleeping I made a plan. My neighbor Fred would watch from outside the house to see who it was and catch them. Possibly give them a long talk on what trespassing laws and harassment were. Then send them on there way.

When night came, my body immediately fell asleep. Hoping to finally catch whoever was doing this. 

That’s when I heard it, 3 knocks as always. I immediately texted Fred to see if they caught them, but he said nobody was outside the house. It’s when I got that message I heard 3 knocks outside my bedroom door.

It’s at that moment I realized the knocking was happening inside the home all along.
