It all started when my grandparents decided, that our old house wasn’t big enough for our growing family.
Even though it was a decent size, my grandma loved to “close the door” at night, meaning that she wanted to be alone after a day of socializing with family and friends. And as an introverted Aquarius myself, I understood her completely and was very grateful when she granted me and my brother a small plot of land behind the main house.

It was far enough away, that it would seem like it’s own, more than just an extension of the old house. And me and my brother got to pick out the design and interior ourselves… big decisions for a couple of teenagers, might I add! We felt very important and responsible!

The only thing was… when we started on the constructions, something seemed off. Tools kept breaking or go missing. We began to blame each other. The struggle was unbearable and we even talked about dropping the whole project.
But then we finally finished! And we felt relieved. That feeling was short lived though…

The first couple of months, there was all these sounds. Knocks on doors, scratching on the walls, sounds from the roof and even the eerie feeling of someone stalking you from the main house to the cabin.
When it was dark outside, none of us dared to make the track from the main house up to the cabin alone. Not without at least our dogs, a strong (and heavy) flashlight and phone with one of the adults from the main house on the line…

We tried to laugh it off… telling each other that it was just the normal sounds of a new house settling in and that the fear of the track to and from the cabin was just our minds playing games in the dark. The adults even told us to grow up - saying that it was childish of us and that, if we wanted to live like adults and have our own home, we should act like adults too… and for a second I thought that they were right. 

But then one night, my brother, my boyfriend and I, witnessed the most eerie thing I can imagine! (And like I said in another story, I have witnessed a lot of creepy stuff).

We were just about to turn the corner of the main house. My boyfriend was holding the flashlight, my brother used his phone as a light and I was carrying some snacks and a blanket while looking after two of our dogs, that we always had with us.

Suddenly both of the dogs (big breeds) stopped dead in their tracks, hairs standing up on both of them and they started growling at something in the dark.
My boyfriend and brother positioned themselves with me in between and then used their lights to search the perimeter for the source of my dogs behavior.
At first glance nothing was out of the ordinary. But then my boyfriend caught something in the lights, that looked more like a shadow than anything…
The dogs started barking and it was a struggle for me to hold them back, not wanting to let them go after whatever this was.
My brother started yelling “we see you, you bastard! Show yourself or we will release the dogs on you and call the cops”.
But whatever it was, just turned away from us and ran behind our cabin. Both boys then decided to charge after the shadow, my dogs nearly going crazy by my side. I decided to let go of one of them, to go with the guys and protect them, while the other one stayed at my site. As loyal and fierce as ever! - which I couldn’t say for myself at that moment.

Alone in the dark, with only my dog as my protector and no light, since I was carrying the snacks while the boys had the flashlights, I was scared senseless.
I tried to listen to the sound of the boys and the dog, not wanting them to get hurt but also feeling very helpless in the dark if anything were to happen…

I suddenly heard something rustling in the bushes near me. In a split second I felt everything from relieved to scared to panicked and I couldn’t feel my heart or catch my breath. My dog went dead silent beside me, pressing up against me, trying to herd me towards the main house: safety.
Instead of obeying, I turned towards the sound, not wanting anything creeping up on me. I would at least look the danger right in the eye when it came for me.
“I am not afraid of you!” I said into the dark. Convincing enough in my tone that I surprised myself. I even felt like my dog acknowledged my strength for at second and stood its ground with me. And for a second everything went dead silent. Not even the wind dared to whisper.

Then, my other dog came out of the bush behind me, followed by both my brother and boyfriend. All of them panting like crazy. “Who are you talking to?” My boyfriend asked, bending over and grappling his knees while he tried to catch his breath.
I didn’t answer him. I just went to my dogs to look for injuries and praising them for their bravery. Then doing the same to the guys, expect not praise but yell at them for leaving me and putting themselves in danger.

We then walked the rest of the way to our cabin. Checking every window, door and off course - under the beds.
But the whole time, I felt like something was watching from the bush. Trying to figure out what it was, that wasn’t afraid of the dark…
