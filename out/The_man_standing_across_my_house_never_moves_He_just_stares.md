From my balcony, I can see the street. A streetlight just a few feet away, glowing in the opposite direction. It was my own little sanctuary.



Every night before bed I would go out to smoke, right behind a bright light cast towards the street, making me hidden from any passerbys. The dark room behind me allowed the bulb to basically keep me invisible. I admit, I was sometimes eavesdropping on stranger’s conversations that passed below me. On a few occasions, I heard chunks of conversations such as a wife accusing the husband of cheating, a couple of teenagers plotting a prank on a teacher, and I am pretty sure I witnessed a small drug deal once.



Those were rare cases however, as living in the suburbs made the traffic almost non-existent, especially after midnight, both regarding cars and pedestrians. It was during one of these quiet nights that I first saw him.



At first I thought he was waiting for someone, but then again, this was not the usual meeting spot, in the middle of street. Trees were planted along the sidewalks, and he stood under one of them right across my house, his body shielded from the light by rich branches. 



It took me a while to notice him in the shadows. I could make out he was wearing a trenchcoat and a hat, like those detectives from the 1930s. It was too hot to wear such clothing in the middle of the summer, so I guess this was the reason I was intrigued. I stood and watched. He hasn’t moved for a long time. 



What felt like ten minutes had passed, and he hadn't moved. Not that he wasn’t going anywhere, he has not changed his posture at all. Not even a scratch, or taking a few steps to stretch his feet. Nothing. The more time passed, the more I was intrigued by the stationary figure. *Who is he, is he meeting anyone, what does he do?* 

	

I knew he could not see me, so I kept watching, waiting for anything to happen. Still nothing. Several more minutes have passed, and I was the one that needed stretching of the feet now. Trying to be as silent as possible, I took a few steps, stretched arms left and right above my head, in a way that almost looked as if I was waving to someone. Sluggishly, he lifted a hand and pointed a finger towards me.

	

I froze. Surely, he could not see me here, in the dark. Then again, he hasn’t moved a muscle for the last fifteen minutes at least, and it seemed too big of a coincidence for him to do it just now. I wanted to try waving at him back, the voice in my head told me to just go to sleep. I tiptoed to the room, sneakily closed the balcony door, and got into the bed. Sleep did not come easy that night.



By the next day, having been caught in the work and family matters, any thought of him evaporated from my mind. It was only in the evening, when I started getting that familiar craving of an evening cigarette that I remembered. I went out on the balcony, not lighting the cigar yet, and I glanced under the tree across the street. He was there. 



Silhouette in a trench coat and hat, same unmoving stance, hands down parallel to body. I waited a few minutes again before deciding to check my theory. In the complete darkness, shrouded by the glare of streetlight, I waved purposefully this time. In the same manner as night before, he slowly raised his hand, pointing it at me again. *Fuck this.* I ran into the house to get a flashlight, not even trying to be silent at this point. In just a few seconds it took me to grab the flashlight from nightdesk, he disappeared. I looked up and down the street, and I could see no one. I did not sleep well last night. Tonight, I did not sleep at all. 



Something was deeply unsettling about the man even without the fact that he could see me in darkness. His ominous presence, being locked in place in a motionless stand, except that slow raise of a hand, made me shiver. I could not work well that day, and I left early. I had to do something about it.



I waited for the night in my room, not turning on a light, TV or even grabbing the phone. I got out, and surely as the night that came, he was there, again. Motionless. I got sick of it, and I grabbed the phone from the pocket and called 911.



“911 what’s your emergency?”



“I live at 1343 Cherokee Street, and there is a man across from my house just…staring. He hasn’t done anything but he makes me feel uneasy.” I spoke, loud enough for him to hear. He did not move.



“How long has he been there?”



“I don’t know. But this is the third day in a row I am seeing him there.”



“Alright, stand inside. Officers are on their way.”



I put the phone away, and looked over at him. His stance did not change. I wanted to yell, hurl something at him, but the police were on their way, and I did not want to make him run before they came. Even though it seemed he was not particularly scared by conversation he must have overheard. 



Not before long, I could see a car approaching from the crossroads. I took my eyes off him to check, and even though patrol lights were off, I could see that it was definitely a police car. A sigh of relief washed over me for a moment. But only for a moment. 



When I looked over at the spot where just a few seconds ago a man stood, there was no one. Blood drained from my face. On the left, a police car was approaching, illuminating the sidewalk; they would surely see him if he went that way. On the right side too, down the street, there was no one. I had no choice but to go out and tell the police what happened, even though it would make me look crazy.



I told the officers about the events of the last three nights, expecting them not to believe me. I think it was shaky hands and tremor in the voice that made them at least partially believe me. They advised me to go inside the house, and call them if a man appears again, and they would scour the neighborhood; recognizing a man in trenchcoat and a hat in the middle of summer would not be that hard, in their own words.



They went their own way, and I went back inside the house, double checking I had locked the door. I did not smoke a cigar that evening; I could not bear to go out again. I was lying in the bed on my back, eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling. Adrenaline was still rushing, and there was no way I could sleep, but I still tried. Nearly two days have passed since I last slept. I moved around the bed, trying to find a more comfortable position, moving to the side. I glanced over at the mirror that faced the window. In the mirror, I could see a shadow of a man in a trenchcoat and hat standing on the balcony.
