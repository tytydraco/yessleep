Me and my family lived in a small village. It wasn't boring at all since there was only one school there and as I said, the village was small, I knew most of the kids and befriended some. My best buddies were Andrew and Jane  because we were neighbors. We would always have sleepovers, hang out on the side of the road (weren't many cars), pull pranks on some people or climb other people's trees to eat fruits. 

One day, I ran outside of my home to meet them and do our daily routine of being small bastards. Andrew wasn't too sad but Jane looked lifeless and pale. I sat next to her and asked

"Are you okay? Something happened?"

She started sobbing and told us

"My Mother dissapeard 4 days ago with no trace.The police couldn't find her. They will close the case of they can't. She left me a suicide note"

Me and Andrew froze for a second. I disliked her mother since she would beat her if she got bad grades or she would start pointing her insecurities out telling her she's worthless, but we still comforted her. It didn't work. She said she wants to go to the local lake to get her thoughts cleared up and she will come back in about 15 minutes. Me and Andrew were so concerned for her that we couldn't even speak to eachother. 

Around 30 minutes passed and she didn't come back. We decided to go to the lake and see what's going on. When we went there it was like she went away. We kept searching for her and screaming her name out. That was until I looked down at my feet to find a piece of paper saying

"Thank you for being good friends (me) and Andrew. I couldn't take it anymore, I saw things that weren't there, I went insane. Tall shadows and voices. I'm at peace with myself now" 

I started sobbing my heart out and Andrew could not belive it. I hugged his leg and kept crying as he started tearing up too. 

A few days later, it was reported that the police found Jane's mother. They claimed she was deceased and showed a slightly blurry picture of her. Her body was mutilated in a way nobody could do that, not even an animal. Her jaw was stretched to her chest, her arms were in zigzags and her legs were backwards. I wanted to throw up. I still had the letter from Jane, I took a look and realised her handwriting was weird. 

I went to school and sat next to Andrew. I showed him the note and said

"I know I sound crazy, but take a close look, this is not her handwriting. She doesn't write so messy. What if it wasn't suicide? "

He told me to cut it out and that I should show some respect. It upset me that our relationship won't be the same after Jane died. 

I was going home. Infront of my house door I see something really big in a trash bag. Maybe an idiot left a pile of trash infront of it. I decided to come close and open it. Smelled like something rotten. I let out a pitched scream, my parents were there. I started hugging both of their corpses and sat down. I immediately rushed to Andrew's house to tell him what happened, but he started crying screaming and said

"Leave me alone! My grandparents died! Are you gonna disrespect them too? I have no one to live with now and no more family! "

I screamed back 

"My parents fcking died! I know what you're going through, please just listen. We have to stop whatever is happening with our families and friends."

He replied

"No.. It's easier to not look back on what happened and follow their lead. I cannot take it anymore" he locked the door and I started banging on it. I took his grandfather's axe and broke the door down. I rushed to his bedroom, I froze immediately. He was standing on a chair with a tall shadow behind him. It was letting out growls, making him crazy, telling him he is worthless and it's his fault his family died, making him hallucinate, exactly like.. Jane said in her note. I wanted to move but couldn't.

 I saw the demonic thing grabing Andrew's arm and making him write. He was moving, making him write in a weird way. It took the rope it had in his other hand and started wrapping it around Andrew's neck. He was struggling. I started crying and sobbing so badly that I ran home. I didn't look back and kept running. 

I took one of the crosses hanging around my house, holy water and locked myself in my bedroom. I started chanting prayers for that thing to go away. I kept doing it until I heard the lock on my door break and being opened by a shadowy hand. I recited more and more and it came closer and closer. It wrapped it's hands around my head, they were so cold and lifeless. I started yelling

"This was not part of our deal! You weren't supposed to kill my friends and ours families, just Jane's mother, she was horrible towards her!"

He started cracking my neck by rotating it and kept chanting

"SELFISH, SELFISH, SELFISH"

I realised what I've done. I shouldn't have did that to her mother. I've put a curse uopn my village.
