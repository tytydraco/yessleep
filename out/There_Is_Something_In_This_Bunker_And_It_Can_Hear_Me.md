There I was, sitting in terror looking down the void hallway, terrified out of my mind. I slowly started to step back, like I was trying not to disturb a sleeping beast, and I started to walk faster till I broke into an all-out sprint. Running down the hallway, covered in sweat, my breathing rapid. The hallway seemed to go on forever. Then I stopped and realized, the quietness. It was like nothing had ever happened, the only sound was my breathing and the same water dripping as it was before, all was the same, as it was before. I slowly slid to the floor and sat there, accepting my fate.
An hour passed, then another, though it felt like days I was down there with my head in my hands, waiting to die.  Finally, I got up and walked, and walked some more until finally, I saw light, the light from the opening in the roof. I walked right back into the room where it all started, with the dead bodies, and blood everywhere. My stomach felt like it was turning inside out, so I walked over to the food supply cabinets, there was nothing there. I thought I was going to starve down there, but I saw a can of beans on the ground. I rushed over to the can and picked it up. It was empty like everything else, I threw it down the hallway. Then I heard it again, the growling from that monster in the darkness, slowly a hand reached out from the darkness. I sat there in horror, it grabbed the can that rolled down the hallway and attacked it, then stopped suddenly as if realizing it was not living.

I crawled on the floor over to the shelves that I had already searched, realizing I had seen a flashlight in the cabinets. I grabbed the flashlight and turned it on, but nothing happened, I smacked it a little and it flickered to life, I aimed it down the hallway, and saw something pass around the corner for a split second, it had pale white skin, and it was hunched over with its vertebrae visible from its back, like spikes. I walked down the hall now able to see, I almost threw up. All of the walls were covered in blood, there were shreds of skin scattered everywhere, and there were dismembered limbs making a trail down the hall. I turned the corner of the hall, the space opened up into a big room I shined my light around scanning the room. I walked toward the middle of the room and felt a splash on my pants, I looked down, I was standing in some bubbly, sticky liquid.

it took me a moment to process what was happening when I heard a thump behind me. There was a tall humanoid thing with a lanky structure, skin clinging to the bone, pale white skin like marble, and no eyes. The thing slowly edged towards me twitching and lashing out uncontrollably every few seconds, almost like it was a puppet, being thrown around by a 5-year-old. until it was a hair from my face, and bared its rows upon rows of teeth as it growled, then its head cocked slightly, I heard a soft squeaking like a mouse, the thing started roaring and it bound off into the darkness. Suddenly there was a horrible squelch and the squeaking stopped, I slowly inched my way out of the room, biting my tongue to keep myself from falling to the floor and laying there until I died, sobbing, and starving. Then, an inch away from getting around the corner and back to “safety” my flashlight’s bulb popped.
I heard a thunderous roar. The ground shook under me as that thing barreled straight toward me. I tried to run but I wasn't fast enough, within a moment the thing was on top of me, it's hands on my throat. I lashed out trying to break free from its grip as everything slowly faded to black.

In one last desperate attempt, I lashed out with my hands and slammed it into one of the thing's empty eye sockets. It roared in pain and fell back. I jumped to my feet and barreled down the hallway, the thing came after me. I heard the ground thundering under my feet, the thing gaining on me. I felt its huge hand fly inches away from the back of my head, searing hot pain stretching down my back. I dived into the main room, sunlight streaming in from the hole. The monster roared and I heard its thunderous footsteps retreating as I gasped for air, I didn't know what that thing was. I forgot where I was for a moment, staring up at the sunlight, wishing to be back out there with Saul, playing in the forest, before this nightmare. I had to find a way out and see my parents again. I saw a mouse scurry across the floor, looking up at me, studying me, before running to its little hole in the wall, I wished I was like that mouse, safety always a few feet away from me. But why didn’t that mouse that saved me from that thing run to safety? Why was the thing attracted to the mouse and not me? It doesn’t have any eyes, It can only hear! I was so proud of myself at this discovery that I started giggling hysterically, only to be met with growling in the distance, which shut me up fast. As I thought about this discovery I scanned the blood-soaked room, trying to find any tool of use. Then, I saw it, a clicker that was used for Morse code messages at the time, now damaged and ripped from its place on the table.
