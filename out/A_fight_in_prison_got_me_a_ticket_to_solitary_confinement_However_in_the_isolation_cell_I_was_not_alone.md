  

The hits, the cold ground, the blows, the pain. Curling to protect myself from the truncheons, I felt like traveling back in time when I used to protect my teenage self from my father's fists.

"Don't worry Colton, we'll take you to your favorite spot." One of the prison wardens said to me while they kept on bludgeoning me, their favorite and sadistic fitness exercise.

"What's up Colt? You wanted to fight earlier, why don't you show us what you got?" Another asked. 

I did not resist once. Not that I enjoyed the beating, or I liked the so-called spot, but I just needed some kind of rest or escape, wordplay not intended. After they decided I got enough, the wardens picked up what was left of me and dragged me to solitary confinement.

A pile of reinforced concrete bricks devoid of windows or any source of light, with a small metallic door equipped with a vision panel. That was the spot, one of the isolation cells. They threw me inside and locked the door without wishing me a good stay as they used to. 

"2nd of March 97" I whispered while getting up, trying not to lose track of the dates since I did not know how long they intended to keep me inside that hell. 

Surrounded by pure darkness, I waved my arms around slowly until I located the tiny bed in front of me, before I sat and sighed. The old and dirty bed squeaked, and I closed my eyes trying to think of anything positive when I suddenly felt a weight pressing the part of the mattress next to me as the bed squeaked for the second time.

"Who's that?" I asked, and obtained silence for an answer. 

My eyes reflexively widened, more due to fear than the need to see who or what was there. I flailed my arms in the direction of the squeaking sound, trying to seize the culprit but to no avail. Instead, my gesture prompted the intruder to speak:

"I wish you die here." I clearly heard from a husky female voice.

"Hey! HEY! GET ME OUT OF HERE! HEY!" I shouted as I stood up, walking backwards until my back touched the metallic door. I turned around and added:

"GET ME OUT OF HERE! I WANNA GET OUT! PLEASE!" I pleaded as my heart sunk in despair.

"SHUT THE FUCK UP!" A warden said as he arrived, hitting the door with his truncheon. 

"Please man! Hey! Please, let me out there's some fucking freak inside here!" I tried to explain. 

"I said SHUT THE FUCK UP! Is that the only shit you could come up with? What you up to? Or should I say what are you on?" The warden asked. 

"I swear, I heard something you gotta let me out. NOW! PLEASE!" I insisted. 

"We all know you alone in that cell Colt. Just shut up and enjoy your stay inmate. If I hear you again, you gonna be very sorry." He warned and left, turning deaf ears to my pleas. 

"What did you expect? Inmate?" She asked, and I turned around unable to see anything. 

"Who are you?" I questioned. 

"You asking for what you can't comprehend." She replied. 

"What the fuck you want?" I asked, terrified at that point, with my voice getting brittle. 

"Trust me on that Colton. I want to kill you so bad, so bad. But The Silencer would not let me. He says he has plans for you." She spoke. 

"What? What the— why are you here? How did you get in here? Is that some dumb prank? Huh? You just called me inmate. You with the wardens, right?"

"Once again, you asking for answers you can't comprehend. My mission here, is to make sure you never come back to such a place. The interesting part for me is that—it will hurt, for you." 

I had enough of all the dread and the mystery. My fighting spirit returned and I started throwing punches in front of me. If I could just touch her, catch her, I would be able to neutralize her and the sick joke would be over. I even hurt myself by landing blows on the solid walls and the little shelf. 

"You can't touch me, but I can touch you." She spoke. 

"WHAT IS THIS? WHAT ARE YOU?" I shouted in despair and frustration. 

"My turn." She said.

I felt something pull my left arm, something immaterial, as if some kind of black hole or portal tried to absorb it. I resisted, trying to pull away in vain. After a few seconds, I felt a pressure around my hand and forearm, and in no time, that thing started to crush my limb as I screamed in pain. I felt the bones shattering and tearing through the skin, and heard the warden coming back and yelling at me. Fortunately, the excruciating pain knocked me out. 

Two days after, I woke up in the medical facility. I tried to sit, but I quickly realized that my left forearm and hand were missing. The nurses told me that the damage was done beyond repair and no other choice was left. They had to act quickly and decided for me to prevent the worst, as something unknown had severely infected the amputated part. 

I never saw or heard that woman again. I never went back to prison again. I do not know what that Silencer wanted from me, but I am happy about my new life and indeed never committed any crime again.
