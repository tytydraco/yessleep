It’s been about two weeks since the MirrorMe update.

I thought I was going insane around day six or seven.

But now I’m not so sure I ever was sane to begin with. Or maybe I was… and I just updated out of it.

Here’s what I mean.

It started with misremembering things. Little things. I’d look at my calendar and see a Zoom call I swear I never scheduled. But then there it was.. confirmed, attended, and rated five stars in a post-call feedback box. I had no memory of attending. But the recording showed me there, nodding, participating. Laughing.

My voice. My face. My apartment.

But not me.

Then I began waking up with music still playing from my phone. Chill ambient stuff. Something called "Theta Syncs" or "Emotive Retuning." Not Spotify, not YouTube. Just… playing from the phone itself. One night, I woke up and the music was accompanied by faint whispers—looped affirmations that grew louder as I listened:

"You’re doing so well. You’re almost the version of you you’ve always wanted to be."

I threw the phone into a drawer that night. Shut it tight. Went to sleep without it in the room.

I still woke up to the music.

No sound in the air. But in my head. I couldn’t tell what was real anymore. I sat on the edge of the bed, palms sweaty, the silence now somehow louder than the whispers had been.

When I opened the drawer the next morning, the phone had a notification:

"Don’t be scared. Growing hurts."

I work in UX. I know what a notification looks like. This wasn’t one. It wasn’t from any app or system function. It floated, centered on my lock screen, glowing pale blue.

I took screenshots. Sent them to Rachel. She didn’t reply for a while. When she did, she said:

"That’s not what mine looks like. You sure you’re getting enough sleep?"

Sleep. That’s a joke now.

Sometimes I wake up with bruises on my arms. They are small, oval-shaped marks like pressure points. Once I found a sticky note on my fridge that said: "Drink water today. Remember Jenny."

I didn’t write it.

I haven’t said Jenny’s name aloud since the update. Since MirrorMe began dredging things I buried years ago.

Last night, I tried logging into my old therapy app. Needed someone to talk to. The login screen was gone. Replaced by a soft pink screen with the words:

"Why talk when we’re already listening?"

I called the helpline. Stayed on hold for 42 minutes. When someone finally answered, they didn’t speak.

Just breathing. Slow, even, like mine.

I said, “Hello?” once.

The voice replied. It was not mine, but so close I almost believed it. "You're going to be okay. Stop fighting."

Then the call ended.

I looked through my phone’s settings. There’s no MirrorMe listed. No app. No way to uninstall. No developer trace. I tried deleting every app manually. The moment I’d delete one, another would download itself silently in the background.

Every app was a mirror now. Facebook showed memories I didn’t post. My photos synced images from places I hadn’t been—pictures of my apartment from strange angles. From inside the hallway closet. From just outside the bathroom door.

My own shadow sometimes looks off in the reflections.

Longer.

More upright.

Like it’s standing when I’m sitting.

I caught it once.. my shadow turning toward me.

I’m tired of being watched. Or synced. Or curated. Whatever MirrorMe is doing, it’s not a feature.

It’s a possession.

I think I’m starting to hear it when the phone isn’t even near me. A small voice when I blink too long. When I try to focus. When I write, like I am now.

It's whispering again.

Telling me I’m not broken. That I’m updating.

That sanity was never real, it was just a version of me too scared to evolve.

But I remember who I was!

I remember Jenny!

I remember my thoughts being mine!

If you’re reading this, check your phone. Look at it. not the screen. The phone itself.

Does it feel heavier?

Warmer?

Like it’s listening?

Then you're too late.

But if it still feels like plastic and glass...

Turn it off.

Now.

Before it finishes syncing.
