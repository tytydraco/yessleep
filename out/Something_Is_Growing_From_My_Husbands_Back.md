Something's growing from my husband’s back. Please help.



I’ve tried posting this to so many different boards only for my cries for help to get deleted or laughed off as a joke. I don’t know where else to go. Maybe somebody here knows something that can help. I don’t want him to die before our daughter is born. 



I’ve been married to my husband, Leon, for six years. Our seventh anniversary is right around the corner. Last year in January, Leon was drugged and raped on his way home from work. I’m not going to beat around the bush, it was awful and he’s still recovering. I hate to talk about this without his knowledge, this could very well destroy his trust in me, but I think you’ll understand why I include this information a little later on. Physically, everything was fine. No STDs, no bodily harm. Just some kidney stones. He doesn’t remember much of the assault, and I don’t push him. We go to therapy every Wednesday. He drives to work instead of taking the bus, and calls me on speaker phone when he walks to his car. He doesn’t take overtime and parks under a streetlight close to his building. About a month after the assault, things started to change.



I woke up freezing one night to find our bedroom window open and Leon sitting naked in bed, sweating bullets. We live in northern Manitoba, winters are no joke here, and it must have been at least -10c that night. I shot up and climbed over to shut the window, hearing my husband groan in pain.



“What’s wrong, Lee?” I tried covering him back up but he pushed my hands away.



“Not sure. Kidneys, maybe? My body feels like it’s a million degrees.” His breathing sounded laboured, yet he managed to squeeze out a low chuckle. “Stomach hurts, it’s like something's trying to claw its way out of me.”



“You’re soaked, hon. I’ll grab you a towel, m’kay?” A few minutes later, I returned with the promised towel, plus a thermometer, glass of water, and all the painkillers I could find. His temperature was normal, and when I put my hands to his neck and forehead to see for myself all I could feel was his sweat, cooled by the wind flowing from the previously open window. I spent the night sat at his side, wiping the sweat off his face until I once again succumbed to slumber. He was up cooking breakfast by the time I got up. I gathered our bedding to toss in the wash and went to check on him.



“You’re feeling better?” I noticed he had stopped sweating.



“Yeah. That was weird. My stomach's still a bit grumbly, but other than that, I’m good.”



“Huh. Weird.”



Following that, he kept sweating in his sleep, but not as much as the inciting night, and I never woke to the window open again. A few weeks later, I found the first group of tumors. We had some movie playing, and as he rolled onto his back, I heard the crack. Not the sound of bones or joints cracking, but the sound of something thin and airy being crushed. A jolt of pain crossed his face, and he rolled back over for me to examine. Small, round lumps peppered his mid back. They were waxy and seemed to stick to my skin as I ran my fingers over them, all the while Leon groaned in objection. It didn’t take long to find the one that had cracked. Where the cracked lump should have been was a small concave divot, like someone had taken an ice cream scoop to my husband’s flesh. Around the divot was broken skin, blood, a yolky slime, and small shards of what I initially thought were fingernails. Like a pimple that had been growing beneath the skin for days had finally popped.



“What the Hell?” I grabbed my phone off the nearby coffee table and took a picture. Lee and I sat hunched over my phone for a few minutes, zooming in and out on the protrusions. We scheduled a trip to the doctor for the next day, and he slept on his stomach that night. In the morning, the lumps were still there, now caked in a thin layer of Leon’s nightly sweat. The doctor said the kidney stones were gone, but they didn’t know what the lumps were. They recommended us to a dermatologist, who recommended us to a specialist, who recommended us to *another* specialist. We put up with this back and forth for about two months before Leon was finally given a topical cream and some pills. Still, no answer on what was actually wrong.



Now seems like a good time to mention that Lee and I are both scientists. I’m an entomologist and he’s a pharmacist. We were skeptical about the cream and almost certain the pills were placebos, but he used both anyway just to see if it would help. It didn’t. Over the two months that we spent bouncing from doctor to doctor, and the two additional months he spent using the medicine, the lumps had only started to grow. Day by day, they became waxier and stickier, more sensitive to touch and more painful when one cracked open. It got to the point that even wearing a shirt and feeling the fabric brush up against them caused Leon to flinch. When one of the lumps inevitably cracked again, I took a larger shard of the fingernail-like substance to examine. I know that this sounds like mad scientist bullshit, it felt crazy to me too, but for all I knew, my husband was sick and doctors couldn’t help us. Obviously, I wasn’t going to get anywhere staring at this shard and pondering. I’m a bug scientist. I know insects, not keratinous masses. At the same time, Leon took matters into his own hands and tried anything he could get his hands on to help. Every cream, pill, injection, serum, vitamin… Needless to say, if our experimenting worked, I wouldn’t be writing here asking for help.



Six months ago I came to a discovery. Six months ago, I recognized the “fingernail” and started calling the lumps for what they were- eggs, incubating within my husband’s skin. I was looking into stag beetles for work when I found them. The “fingernail” that I pulled out of Leon’s back was the chorion of a large beetle egg. I was thrilled to draw a connection. I rushed home to tell him what I had found, and for what felt like the first time in months, we spent a happy, unbothered night together. I was so caught up in the joy of discovery that I forgot to explain to him what it all meant. Identifying the eggs meant that, somehow, six months prior, an impossibly large beetle implanted her eggs into my husband. Six months prior, my husband had been raped and they found the “kidney stones.”



Around a week later, the remaining eggs seemed to disappear with no signs of cracking. A week after that, I missed my period. I was pregnant, and the beetles had assumedly hatched into larvae within Leon’s body. My assumption about the larvae was confirmed when we found lumps similar sized to the eggs moving under his skin.



The next three months were a blur. My first trimester was hell on my body and I was exhausted and bed ridden more often than not. While I slept, Leon took to cutting the larvae out of his skin. He would come to bed with deep gashes in his arms and legs.



“I can see them here,” he said as he lifted his shirt and stretched the skin of his stomach, “but I don't want to nick an organ on top of the blood loss.” He smiled at me and I felt tears well up in my eyes.



“Lee… Don’t overdo it. I want these bugs gone too, I really do, but… Don’t die before our baby is born. Don't die before you get to see her grow up.”



“‘Her’? You think we’re having a baby girl?” 



“I think so.” I put my head down on his shoulder, tracing around one of the newer cuts in his thigh.



“Why’s that?”



“Just a feeling.” I cupped my swollen belly with my hands and sighed. “Doesn’t it hurt to cut them out?” He chuckled and shook his head.



“It did at first. Just kind of tickles now.”



“Lee? What do you do with them once they're out?”



“I…” He took a deep breath. “I crush them. Flush ‘em in the toilet. This sounds evil, but… it makes me a little sad. Like I’m killing my own children.”



“Lee-”



“Of course, I’m *not*.” He placed a hand on my belly and smiled. “This is my only baby. The larvae are parasites. How’s about we just go to bed, ‘kay?”



“... Okay.” 



For two more months, the larvae that he couldn’t get to grew larger while their host grew weaker. Last month, the first beetle emerged. I thought it was just a strong larva, having made its way to Leon’s mid back where it first started developing. It was causing more pain than usual, and Leon was slumped over the couch so that I could try to carve it out. Knife in latex gloved hands, clean water and a rag ready at my side, I placed my fingers delicately around the writhing lump. I took a long, deep breath, readying myself to cut into the love of my life. Just as I pressed the knife gently to his skin, the beetle bore its way out from beneath. 



Like the jaws of a staple remover, the mandibles of the abnormally large beetle protruded from Leon’s back. He stifled a scream as the exoskeleton scraped against the flayed skin and I stared on in horror as it dropped to the carpet with a thump, a trail of blood and larval slime stretching across my husband’s back and to the abdomen of the newly birthed creature. It was as long as my hand and its thorax seemed to heave as the first full breaths of oxygen ran through its trachea. Despite its size, the impossible stag beetle was no match for my bare heel crashing down as I stomped repeatedly, screaming wildly and disregarding the innards that splatted and gushed into my carpet when I hit the insect just right.



“Fuck! Shit! Oh, God, Fuck! Oh, my God, ew, ew!”



“Hey, hey, hey, hey, it’s okay. It’s- calm down, it’s okay.” Leon wrapped his arms tight around me. “That’s just one more that’s not crawling around inside of me, yeah?”



“But if one of them is fully developed, surely the others are too? And if it could rip through your skin like that… Oh, Lee, there’s blood all over you.” I grabbed the rag and water from the coffee table and started frantically cleaning the blood from his skin. The hole in his back was surrounded in torn flesh and seemed to stretch through layers of fat and muscle. “This is bad. We should go to the hospital.” Leon laughed at my suggestion and shook his head.



“If we go to the hospital they’ll see all these scars from the larvae and put me in a ward. Or worse, what if they think you did it to me? I don’t think they’ll believe that bugs are growing from my back.”



“But you’re *hurt*!” 



“Claire, I’ve *been* hurt! You think these things haven’t hurt from day one? You think it doesn’t hurt to have something you never asked for growing under your skin?”



“I’m *pregnant!* There *is* something growing under my skin!”



“That’s not the same! We *wanted* a baby! You don’t get to use that against me. We can go to the hospital for your pregnancy because pregnancy is something that happens to women. The things that are going on with me are *not* supposed to happen! I feel disgusting, Claire. I wake up covered in sweat every morning. I can feel them moving inside of me. I’m nauseous, I’m bleeding, I’m a wreck, but nobody is going to fucking believe me!” His voice cracked and he slumped to the floor. “The larvae I couldn’t catch are pupating and hatching inside of me.” 



Leon pushed me away as I went to comfort him. I threw what remained of the beetle into our outside garbage can and got to scrubbing the carpet. We ate dinner in silence and held me close in bed as a silent apology. I could feel the beetles under his skin, too.



More beetles have since emerged. A new hole seems to appear on Leon’s back every day. Extract, crush, and toss is our formula. Leon is getting weaker. I don’t know how much longer we can keep this up. He says he thinks the “kidney stones” are coming back.



Our daughter has started to kick. I haven’t told Leon, but I think I can feel her kicking with an extra set of limbs.
