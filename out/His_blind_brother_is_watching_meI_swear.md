I had recently gotten into a relationship—despite every intuition telling me not to rush. Deep down, I knew what I was doing: I needed a place to stay. A roof. Stability. My mother, of course, had too much to say about it. She thought I was moving too fast. But after eight years of being single, I had never been so sure about a partner. And besides—my relationship with my family was already unhealthy enough.

I reassured her anyway.
“He’s a nice guy.”

She gave me that tight-lipped look.
“Just be careful,” she said. “You always end up stumbling into trouble.”

“He’s harmless,” I said, smiling too wide. “We’re actually going to see his parents.”

That was when the knock came at the door. Ethan was here to pick me up. My bags were packed and waiting, like I’d been ready longer than I wanted to admit. He stood there on the threshold, nervousness etched across his face as his eyes searched mine.

“A-are you ready?”

“Of course,” I said with practiced cheer. “I’d travel anywhere with you at this point.”

The words almost convinced me too.

“Great,” he chuckled, though uneasily. “My family is definitely excited to meet you… well, most of them.”

I didn’t ask what he meant. He hoisted my bags into the trunk of his red sedan, careful and deliberate, and my mother watched from the doorway. Usually she’d scold men, remind them to take care of me—but when Ethan held the door open for me, her guard slipped. She just stood there, oddly softened, and said only:

“Be careful.”

And honestly, I wish I had listened.

The drive took us to a modest two-story house with an attached garage. Generic middle-class. Nothing remarkable. Ethan glanced at me with that same worried look.

“Please,” he said quietly, “if you’re going to stay here… just know my family is a little unorthodox.”

I smiled back, though it felt rehearsed.
“Don’t worry. My family’s crazy too.”

I even giggled, trying to sell it. The truth was, I needed this. I needed somewhere away from my mother, away from the endless cycle of disapproval. If being a live-in girlfriend meant adjusting to a family of weirdos, so be it.

But when we walked inside, I almost laughed at his warning. The house was spotless. Normal. Too normal. The walls lined with family portraits. The kitchen smelled of fresh bread. His parents had even baked for the occasion.

No yelling. No slammed doors. No drunken arguments. Just polite smiles, clean furniture, and quiet civility.

And that, somehow, unsettled me more than chaos ever could.

From the corner of the kitchen, his parents emerged—his father looming in silence, his mother balancing a plate of cookies, still warm, the scent of butter and sugar clinging to the air.

“Hello!” she beamed. “My name is Mary—but of course, you can call me Mom.” She practically shoved the plate under my nose.

I glanced at Ethan, who gave me a reassuring nod, urging me to take one.
“Mom?” I repeated awkwardly, testing the word on my tongue.

“If you prefer,” she said softly, her smile all nurture and warmth.

I plucked a cookie from the pile, the heat surprising my fingertips.
“Th-thank you. Sorry, I’m just not used to this level of love bombing.” I laughed nervously, trying to shield myself with humor.

“Nonsense!” she said, voice bubbling with cheer. “We’re happy you’ve joined our little circus. And if you’re with one of my clowns, then I consider you one of my own as well.”

I laughed too, though her words itched at the back of my mind. Two clowns? There were only two of them here. She couldn’t mean her lumberjack of a husband. Then who—?

The garage door groaned open.

A figure stepped inside—large, hulking, and… dare I admit it, striking. He moved with uncanny grace, almost as if he glided rather than walked. His eyes were covered, bandaged with what looked like a torn black t-shirt. Fresh blood seeped through, staining the fabric dark where his eyes should have been.

He wore nothing but black jeans. His skin—deep brown, muscles taut—caught the light in a way I had to look away from before I stared too long. But not before Ethan’s mother noticed.

“That’s Lucas,” Ethan whispered, his hand tightening on my shoulder as if bracing me. “He… had an accident.”

He thought I was staring in fear. Or maybe morbid curiosity.

But Lucas didn’t stumble. He didn’t grope for furniture. He walked straight to the counter, poured himself a glass of milk, plucked a cookie from the plate—effortlessly. As though blindness was only an inconvenience, not a burden. Then he leaned down, kissed his mother’s forehead tenderly.

“Your cookies are always the best, Mom.” He sniffed the air, then tilted his head toward me.

The bandages couldn’t hide the feeling that his eyes—whatever lay beneath—were locked on mine.

“Ahhh,” he said slowly, biting into the cookie. “Seems we have a guest. And who are you?”

The others acted like nothing was strange about this. Ethan even gave me a subtle nod, as though coaxing me to answer.

“I’m… Emily. But you can call me Emmy.”

Lucas chewed thoughtfully, then shook his head.
“Nah. I’ll call you M-and-M. Like the candy.”

His parents laughed, as if it were a running family joke.

Ethan forced a smile. “Lucas has a really… eccentric way of seeing the world.”

“Or lack thereof,” Lucas shot back with a quick grin. “I just don’t like things that are predictable.”

Then he turned toward me again. The air in the room thickened.
“So. Are you predictable?”

The silence pressed against me. My throat tightened. I didn’t even answer—just drew in a shallow breath, sharp enough to betray me.

Lucas smirked, lifted his glass of milk, and sipped as if my reaction was all the confirmation he needed.

“Good to know,” he said lightly, before drifting back toward the garage.

I sat frozen, wondering what the hell had just happened. But everyone else carried on as if it were nothing at all.

“I should make dinner” Mary said as she looked at her small diamond watch 
She got up and headed to the kitchen as Ethan , his father and I watched a movie…or documentary….


The dining room was dressed like a showroom. A heavy oak table, polished until it gleamed, and walls lined with paintings that stopped me mid-step. They weren’t cheap prints. These were original canvases, layered with violent colors, textured brushstrokes. Distorted faces. Limbs bent at impossible angles. Some looked religious, some grotesque, all haunting.

I couldn’t stop staring.

“They’re all Lucas’s work,” Mary said proudly, setting down a steaming platter of roast chicken.

I blinked. “He painted… all of these?”

“Every last one,” she said, her tone balancing pride with practiced humility. “He’s always had an eye for detail, even after…” She trailed off, eyes flicking toward the kitchen. “Well, he makes do.”

Her husband sat at the head of the table, silent as a statue, only nodding once as if to confirm the statement.

Ethan placed a hand on my knee under the table, as if steadying me. His smile never faltered. But I could feel his fingers tightening, grounding me in place.

Then the garage door creaked open again.

Lucas emerged, this time not in black denim but bare-chested, splattered with streaks of paint—scarlet, cobalt, ochre smeared across his skin like war paint. His jeans were ruined with stains, his hands dripping with turpentine and oil. The bloodied bandage was still knotted over his eyes, but somehow his head tilted toward me the second he entered.

He looked like a creature pulled straight from one of his own canvases.

“Dinner smells good,” he drawled, sliding into a chair across from me. He didn’t bother to clean himself. The scent of paint and chemicals mixed with the roasted chicken until my stomach turned.

He reached for a roll without fumbling, tore it apart, and spoke directly to me.
“So, Emmy,” he said, his voice low, almost intimate, “how does it feel to sit surrounded by me?”

I froze, unsure if he meant the art or something else.

Ethan’s hand squeezed mine hard, but he didn’t say a word. His jaw flexed, eyes on his plate, as if this wasn’t happening.

Mary gave a polite laugh, quick and brittle. “Lucas,” she scolded lightly, “don’t make our guest uncomfortable.”

Lucas only smirked, tilting his head toward me again. “I wasn’t asking to make her uncomfortable. I was asking because I can smell her heartbeat from here.”

The room went still. The father’s knife clinked against his plate. He didn’t look at me. He didn’t look at anyone. He just said, with calm finality:
“Eat.”

Everyone obeyed.

The rest of dinner blurred into silence, punctuated only by the scrape of forks and the occasional soft laugh from Mary to patch the air. Lucas never stopped smiling. He ate with the grace of someone who could see everything. And more than once, I caught the impossible feeling that, behind that bloody blindfold, his eyes were wide open—and fixed on me.


Later that night in their house, I couldn’t sleep.

The guest room was spotless—too spotless. White sheets pressed tight across the mattress, the air perfumed faintly with lavender, like someone had spritzed it only minutes before I arrived. It should’ve been comforting, but instead it made me restless. Every creak of the house felt amplified, every tick of the grandfather clock in the hallway bled into my ears.

Ethan lay beside me, already asleep, his back turned. His breathing was heavy, steady. Almost rehearsed. He hadn’t even tried to touch me, not so much as a kiss goodnight. After the strange tension at dinner, I wasn’t sure if I was grateful or insulted.

I stared at the ceiling. My throat was dry. Too dry. Finally, I slipped out from under the covers, careful not to wake him, and padded barefoot into the hallway.

The house was different at night. Shadows leaned long against the walls, stretching out of Lucas’s paintings. They seemed alive in the dim light—twisted saints and fractured bodies bending as if to watch me pass.

I told myself it was just my imagination, but I quickened my steps toward the kitchen.

That’s when I heard it.

A faint rustle. Bare feet against hardwood.

I froze.

And then I saw him.

Lucas.

He was standing at the far end of the hallway, just outside the bathroom. No shirt, only a towel slung casually over one shoulder. His skin gleamed with a sheen of sweat and paint still clung to his chest in streaks, like remnants of a battlefield. The blindfold—dark, knotted fabric—was still wrapped tight across his eyes. The stains looked fresher now, seeping darker at the center.

For a moment, he didn’t move. His head tilted slightly, as if listening.

Then, with slow precision, he reached out, found the bathroom doorframe, and leaned against it. Not stumbling. Not lost. Just… waiting.

I should have turned back. Should have grabbed my water and fled. But I stood there, rooted, watching.

He spoke without facing me.
“You’re thirsty.”

It wasn’t a question.

My breath caught. “I—I just wanted some water.”

Lucas smiled, lips curling in the dim light.
“Middle of the night. First night in a strange house. You’re braver than you look, M-and-M.”

He said it softly, like a secret.

I swallowed hard. “You’re… up late too.”

“I roam,” he said simply, fingers brushing the bandage as though to remind me of it. “The walls don’t tell me much anymore. I have to feel the house to know it’s still here.”

I didn’t know what to say. His voice filled the silence, low and rich, resonant in a way that made the air feel too warm.

He pushed off the frame then, stepping closer—not stumbling, not reaching, but walking with uncanny surety. His shoulder brushed the wall as he passed, fingertips grazing the surface lightly, almost lovingly.

He stopped only a few feet from me. Close enough to catch the sharp scent of turpentine still clinging to his skin, mixed with the clean sweat of someone about to shower.

“Water’s in the kitchen,” he murmured. “But I think you already knew that.”

I forced a laugh that came out brittle. “Yeah… thanks.”

He tilted his head, as if savoring the sound of my nerves.
“You breathe faster when you’re lying.”

My pulse hammered so loud I swore he could hear it. He leaned in slightly, not touching, just close enough that I could feel the heat radiating from his body.

“I’ll be in the shower,” he whispered, voice dropping to something almost conspiratorial. “If you need anything.”

Then he slipped past me, towel slung over his shoulder, the bandaged eyes never wavering. He disappeared into the bathroom and shut the door with a slow, deliberate click.

I stood in the hallway, water forgotten, every nerve in my body alive.

And I couldn’t shake the feeling that he hadn’t needed eyes at all to see me.
