I had a traumatic experience as a teenager. 

Now it's happening again. 

I've been attending therapy since I was seventeen years old, and I've kind of learned to suppress it with CBT and anti-anxiety/depression medication, but over the last few hours, I've been thinking a lot more about what happened to me. 

Today, a random woman joined my weekly book club out of the blue. 

Let's call her Karen. 

Karen wasn't invited. She just turned up at my door with *Metamorphosis* pressed to her chest. 

I didn't like the look of her from the get-go. She was the type I hated: 

“Oh, look at me, I'm the perfect Mom. I'm going to judge you behind your back while being sweet as sugar to your face.” 

Still, I gave her a chance. The club was small, and we were looking for newbies. 

Preferably young moms in their mid-twenties. 

I invited her in, though I was cautious around her.

I am comfortable with the other moms. They know about my past, or at least the parts I opened up about. 

They didn't question the medication piled in our bathroom cabinet. 

Karen *would* question it. 

So, while I let her take off her coat and meet the other girls, I ran upstairs to rearrange my bathroom. 

The rest of the club welcomed her, and I got her a glass of juice. 

“Is it organic?” she asked, raising a perfectly plucked brow. 

Her words twisted my gut, but I forced a smile. 

Book club went okay…ish. Karen was as pretentious as I imagined, already teasing long-timer Isabella for bringing the *Twilight* series. 

Karen went on a long, winded rant about *Metamorphosis*, and how it *spoke* to her in ways she couldn't quite understand. 

We all clapped (because she expected us to. 

This woman actually stood up and BOWED) and waited for her to sit down so Allie could talk about her book, *Vampire Academy*. 

The week’s theme was *vampires* and *books from our childhood*. 

Karen didn't get the memo. 

Instead of letting Allie speak, she settled us with a smile. 

“This is a strange request,” she said, chuckling. 

Her eyes found mine, and something twisted in my gut. I knew that look. I knew it from countless days of therapy when I tried to draw it in a white room.

Her words crashed into me like ice water, phantom bugs filling my mouth and skittering on my tongue. 

Karen held out the book like we were in Show and Tell. “But could I act out the characters in my book?” 

Here's the thing. 

Trauma can do a *lot* to your brain, both mentally and physically. 

I think that is the reason why I stood up, maintained my smile, and said, “No.”

Karen didn't protest, to my surprise. She nodded, took her book, and left.

However, I couldn't concentrate for the rest of the meeting. 

I excused myself and went into the kitchen to grab a drink—before I realized I had poured all of my wine down the sink. Wine didn't help in the long term. 

It made me feel worse, overridden with guilt and pain. Pain that wouldn't fucking stop. 

When the others left, I was alone. 

I've never been alone without automatically self-destructing. 

After hours of driving myself mad with paranoia, I locked the doors and windows. 

I texted my fiancé to pick up our five-year-old girl from school and take her straight to his parents' house. 

I did a lot of things I'm not proud of between texting my fiancé and binge eating through everything in our refrigerator. Food is my solace. 

I eat when I can't drink. 

So, I took out my daughter’s ice cream and scooped it out with my hands, stuffing myself with frozen treats. 

It felt good and disgusting and perfect. When I was choking on ice-cream barf, I wasn't thinking about Karen. 

I wasn't thinking about the fact that she was wearing a long-sleeved sweater in fucking July. 

A turtleneck sweater, and leggings that perfectly hid every patch of her. 

I met someone like Karen when I was seventeen. 

Seven years after my friends went missing. 

We were playing hide and seek in the park when they disappeared. 

I remember knowing exactly where they were from their shuffled footsteps and giggling. 

“Found you!” 

The words were premature, however, when I found myself pointing at empty air. I barely noticed the sudden deep, impenetrable silence. Taia was gone. I couldn't see her red sneakers poking out anymore.

So was Liam. 

He was behind the tree, and then he was *gone*. 

“Kai?” I tried his usual spot, half buried in the sandbox. 

But there was nothing. I was digging into *nothing*. 

I looked for them everywhere, until I started to break. 

Suddenly, the park was too big, and I was all alone. 

Then, so did the police.

Mom was crying a lot, and I spent a lot of time in the sheriff's office saying the same thing over and over and OVER again. 

“Yes. I didn't see a stranger.”

“No, I didn't see them walk away with anyone.”

“No, I'm not lying.”

I can still remember the uncomfortable stuffy summer heat suffocating my face. 

My friends were officially missing. 

I sat in the sheriff's office and downed milk until it was coming back up my throat. 

*"Becca, this is important. Did you see anyone in the park other than the children?"*

I said no. 

I kept saying no, until Mom came to gently pull me away. 

Zero leads, and no suspects. According to my town, Taia, Liam, and Kai had dropped off the face of the earth. 

I grew up, and they did not. But I did have an unlucky nickname. 

*“Oh, she's the girl who was friends with those missing kids!”* 

Which led people to speculate, and somehow come to the conclusion that *I* was the perpetrator. 

When I started my junior year, a girl plopped herself on my desk. 

Dark brown hair pulled into pigtails, and a heart shaped face. She was president of the drama club. I didn't know her name, but I *did* know she was very passionate about her role in the theater . 

Or, as she called it, “*The thee-a-tarrrr*.”

When auditions were held for the school play, she was always first in line. 

The girl’s smile was genuine, and somehow familiar enough for me to force one back. “I'm sorry about your friends!”

“Thanks.” 

I thought that was the end of the conversation until she jumped up, grinning a little too wildly. “Did you know I won the 2009 ‘Little Star’ acting contest? I came in first place!*

“Congratulations. That's really cool.” I told her, hinting that I wanted to be left alone. 

The girl leaned close, her smile growing. “Becca, my best friend's dog died three weeks ago.” her expression seemed to contort, wide eyes, and a grinning mouth. 

Her eyes were what sold it. Confusion and naivity of a child, mixed with excitement. 

When she let out a pant and then a “woof!” I backed away. 

“But.” The girl said in a low murmur. “I’ve been able to act out her dead dog for her.” She laughed, and somehow, she retained the expression of a *dog.* “Do you know what's funny, Becca?”  

I think I responded. I wasn't sure I was able to move. 

The girl inclined her head, letting out a canine-like whine. 

“Ever since I was a kid, I've been able to act out anything.” She started panting, half girl, half dog. But what terrified me was that if I suspended my disbelief, I could really believe I was sitting in front of a dog. 

The docile look. 

Even the slight prick in her ears. 

Her eyes were suddenly so *sad*. 

“Your friends disappeared and you miss them.” She leaned closer. Too close. I pulled away. The girl dropped the dog act, her demeanour morphing back into a teenage girl. “Do you want me to act them out for you?”

I found my voice, trying not to snap at her. 

“I'm good.” I said, biting back the urge to suggest a psych evaluation. 

The girl frowned. “But I'm actually really good.” 

“No.” I said, my tone was final and cold. “Go away.”

She inclined her head, and I felt part of me shatter, a sour slime creeping up my throat. 

This wasn't a *dog* she was embodying anymore. 

This was human and raw, and fucking *real*. It brought back years of agony and guilt and growing up blaming myself. For a disorienting moment, I couldn't breathe.

All of her, *every* part of her, had in that moment somehow embodied Taia.

Ten years old, and then seventeen-year-old Taia.

Child and teenager, my best friend who never grew up.

Blinking rapidly, I was sure of it. Taia was standing in front of me. “Are you *sure?*” 

She leaned closer, her eyes turning playful, her lips twitching in the *exact* same way Kai tried not to smile. She even had his eyes.

Taia morphed into Kai through pure *expression*.

I was aware I was stumbling back when the girl stepped closer with a familiar laugh.

*Liam.*

She folded her—his—arms, raising a brow.

“Oh, you're sure, huh?” Her voice was a perfect blend of all three of them. “Suit yourseeeeelf!”

I found my voice. Somehow. I wasn't proud of my words. I hated myself for asking, but it was so tempting. Like I could really reach out and grasp them.

“Can you do that… again?” I asked, my hands trembling.

The girl nodded, sitting in front of me.

“Hey, Becca!” Her smile, her voice, every part of her *was* Kai, and the more I listened to her, I started to hear *his* voice.

“I'm sorry you couldn't find us.” Kai shrugged. “But, hey, we’ll be out there somewhere.”

He was always so blunt.

*“Your drawing is bad. I think you should do it again.”*

*“Yes, you have lice. But don't worry, I can't see them. Not unless I get real close.”*

His hand found my shoulder, and it was *his*. I felt his familiar grasp, the twitch in his fingers and his awkward pat.

I didn't mean to, but I couldn't stop myself.

“It's my fault,” I told him, and it felt *good*.

Fuck. It felt like weight being lifted from my chest.

Kai sat back on the desk, crossing one leg over the other. I could still see the girl, but she was an afterthought, a shadow bleeding away. I was talking to Kai. 

I could see his slightly squinty eyes and the quirk of a smirk on his lips.

“You were just a kid.” His smile was both tragic and hopeful. “You had no idea.”

He reached out and ruffled my hair. “Besides! You lost hide and seek. We’re still winning. But you've still got time to find us.”

Kai winked, and I lost all of my breath.

His words sent me into hysterical sobs, and I knew it was bad.

I knew it was unhealthy, and very fucking wrong.

But I couldn't stop.

I became addicted to this girl, especially when she greeted me every day as Kai, Taia, and Liam. I would follow her around and beg this girl to impersonate my friends, and she would.

I expected her to ask for cash, but she didn't.

This girl perfectly embodied my friends without asking for anything in return, except praise.

It was scary how good she was, and I didn't even know her name.

She could personify them as teenagers too, perfecting their personalities, their mannerisms.

*All* of them.

At first, it was like having my friends back. I could greet them and laugh and joke with them. I went for day trips with them, and they felt real. 

But then I started to resent the girl for being there. 

No matter how hard I suspended my disbelief, I couldn't mentally cut her out. 

Her body, her face, everything that wasn't them, was ruining this facade. 

I started to hate myself for thinking like that. After long days of hanging out with my friends, or one singular girl, I went home and self-destructed.

I started binge-eating, my mind growing foggy until my head was pressed against the cool porcelain of our toilet.

I hated her. The girl who could become my friends. I *hated* her for existing.

I had to tell her before I went crazy. 

When she turned up at my house with Taia’s hopeful smile, I let her in as usual.

I grabbed her a soda, and she took it with a grateful smile.

“Is it organic?”

I forced a patient smile. “It's soda.”

She cracked it open, taking an experimental sip. Her expression confused me. *Had this girl ever had soda before?*

“It's… sugary.” 

“Can you stop?” I blurted out, my voice choking up.

“Stop?” The girl sipped her soda with a patient smile. 

With *my* smile. Like looking in a mirror, this girl was mimicking every part of me, even the parts I was trying to keep hidden—my frustration and anger and pain, my resentment for her. 

I took a step backward, a sour-tasting barf creeping up my throat. 

And yet somehow, she was better than me. Her emotions were deeper, more raw, better than anything I could pull off. 

For a disorienting second, I was staring at myself.

A better fucking version of myself. 

She blinked, morphing into Taia once again. Her voice was small. “What do you mean?”

“This.” I said, keeping my tone soft. “All of this. The acting thing.” I could feel myself starting to break. Because it was like saying goodbye all over again. 

“I appreciate what you have done for me,” I said. And I meant it. I really did. 

She had brought my friends back in ways I never could imagine. But it hurt. It fucking hurt seeing them, and yet *not*. 

There was only a certain amount of time I could suspend my disbelief, before I started to lose my mind. And this was it. 

This was me losing my fucking mind. “You can stop now.” I said with what I hoped was a smile. “I don't need you to act like them anymore.” 

I held my breath, awaiting her reaction. 

“I just want my friends back.”

That was a lie. 

Finding them would be agony. Dead or alive. 

I wanted to move on with my life. 

The girl’s eyes widened, and I felt part of me shatter. 

“But we *did* come back!”

Liam. 

I could see all of him. 

His confusion and anger for letting him disappear. 

“Are you letting us go?” Liam whispered. His fingers tightened around her soda can, and suddenly, this girl *was* him. 

What I wanted her to be for the last several months. I could finally see him. 

What he should look like, thick brown hair and a matured face, a tragic smile flickering on his lips. He inclined his head. “You don't want us to leave again, right?” 

“Liam.” I didn't mean to say his name, but it felt so real, so raw on my tongue. 

He surprised me with a harsh laugh that rattled my skull. 

“Wait, are you going to abandon us *again*?” 

He raised a brow, and it was exactly how I imagined him to grow up. “Wow.”

“Right?” Kai’s voice bled off her tongue so effortlessly, all of the breath was sucked from my lungs. It was lower, almost a grumble. “You would think she'd hold onto us this time.” His gaze flicked to me. Accusing. “Clearly not.”

I shook my head, squeezing my eyes shut so I wasn't looking the boys in the eye. 

This psycho bitch was holding their faces, voices, every part of them I had held dear to me, hostage. 

“Stop.” 

My heart was slamming into my chest, my chest aching. 

Liam scowled. “Oh, you want us to shut up for *good*?”

“Please.” I emphasised the word, my voice breaking. Instead of focusing on Liam’s eyes, I pushed through to reality. 

The girl underneath him with no name. 

It was so hard to shove him away again; treat him like he didn't exist. But I knew he didn't, and if he did still exist, my best friend wasn't alive anymore. 

I had often wondered what exactly happened to them. 

As a kid, my imagination ran wild. It had to. 

If I didn't imagine them being transported to a whole other world, or adopted by talking cats, I would start thinking of the more likely. I remember overhearing a conversation between two girls. 

*“Oh, they're definitely dead in a ditch somewhere.”*

*“You can't say that!”*

*“What? It's true! Some sicko probably snatched them, tortured them, and buried them. If the killer is smart, he dismembered their bodies. If he's even smarter, he disintegrated what was left of them in a tub full of acid, burned their clothes, and made a break for it.”*

*“Why do you care so much?”*

*“I have to. This town is holding onto a miracle, and it's wrong. Missing kids are almost never found alive. Everyone knows that.”*

That day, I spent all afternoon with my head pressed against the cool porcelain of a toilet seat, choking on the phantom stink of sulphuric acid burning my throat. 

I had intentionally been ignorant to the inevitability of them being dead. 

Mom had *the talk* with me halfway through my sophomore year when the non-existent trail went cold. 

I screamed at her and told her she was wrong. There was a memorial in the children's park with their names. 

I ignored it. 

I didn't go to the candle-lit vigil. Because my friend’s were still *alive*. 

I had been so ignorant, choosing to wear rose-tinted glasses 

But at that moment, I finally accepted it. 

I didn't realize I was sobbing, until my legs were dangerously close to giving way. 

“Stop.” 

To my surprise, she actually did drop the facade. I heard her let out a sigh.  

When I risked opening my eyes, the girl’s expression had relaxed, and I saw *her* again. 

But what frightened me, was that even when this girl was *herself*, she was a blank slate.

“Fine.”

She held no real expression. Smiling, but also not.

Frowning, but it wasn't *her* frown. 

Zero emotion of her own, but a natural at embodying others’. 

This girl was still acting. Still putting on a performance. 

Even as herself. 

“What's your name?” I asked, before I could stop myself. “You never told me.”

The girl shrugged with a half smile, another perfectly  constructed expression. 

“I don't actually know.” 

I watched her skip into my kitchen and pull open the drawer. I followed her. I mean, my first thought was that she was hungry. 

I was going to tell her to help herself, but then I caught this girl dragging her index finger over an assortment of my mother’s kitchen knives. She settled on one with a wooden handle, pricking her finger on the blade. 

“I'm not really sure anymore, Becca. I've never had a name.”

Paralyzed to the spot, I couldn't move.

“I'm calling the police.” was all I managed to choke out. 

She did a slow head incline. “But I thought you wanted me to stop?” When I didn't (or couldn't) respond, she hastily pulled up the sleeve of her sleeve, tracing the knife edge across rugged stitches under her elbow. 

I watched her slice into them one by one, severing the appendage that was barely hanging on. 

In one swift slice, it was hanging off, and yet there was no pain in her eyes. 

“Okaaaay,  you win.” Taia’s murmur shattered on her tongue, bleeding into more of a screech. 

What was left of her arm, mutilated patchwork skin, landed on the floor with a soft thump.

I remember staring down at it, at twitching fingers that looked familiar. 

I was aware I was stumbling back, but something kept me glued to the spot.

With half of Taia’s smile melting down her face, the girl plunged the knife into her right eye, carving it from the socket. 

She squeezed what was left of it into bloody pulp between her fingers. This time I could see pain. Agony. But it wasn't hers. 

Her expression contorted, three different faces, three different voices. “But can you tell me…”

She stabbed into her other eye, carving it out with her fingers. 

*There.*

Her real voice was *nothing*, oblivion soaked in a hellish silence that rattled my skull. 

I staggered back when she tore the knife into her gut, slicing into stitches that were worn and old, melding dead flesh with hers. I was left staring at a patchwork girl with patchwork skin. 

Patchwork legs. 

Patchwork arms.

“Am I still a good actor?” Kai, Liam, and Taia whispered, their voices melted together. 

The three of them lurched towards me, an amalgamation of twitching body parts.

I could see where parts of them had been severed and ripped apart and glued to her. 

I could see the stitches across her neck and forehead, where she had pasted my friend’s flesh to her own. 

I could see Liam’s arm hanging rigid. 

Kai’s eye hanging loose in its socket. 

Taia’s arms and mutilated torso holding her together.

I think part of me was delusional. I thought I could save them. 

Even in this state, moulded together and stitched onto this girl. 

I thought I could bring them back. 

That's why I stood, frozen, while this *thing* grabbed one of my Mom’s paperweights, and slammed it over my head. 

When I awoke, I was tied down to the dining room table. There was something sticky over my eyes and mouth. Duct tape. 

I screamed, but my cries only came out in muffled pants. 

“It's sad, Becca.” 

Liam’s voice was eerily cold, polluted and wrong, a mixture of child and adult. 

“I really did want to be your friend.” 

I felt slimy fingers lift up my shirt, the ice-cold prick of a blade tracing my skin. 

She stabbed the blade into my gut, and I remember feeling pain like I had never felt before. 

Searing hot and yet icy cold, the feeling of being ripped apart.

Taia’s voice sent my body into fight or flight, my back arching, my wrists straining against duct tape restraints. 

“I told you I was a good actress.” Kai spoke through gritted teeth. 

He emphasised his words by digging the knife deeper, twisting until I was screeching, my body contorting. 

I could feel it penetrating through me, pricking at my insides. I could feel warm stickiness pooling underneath me, glueing my hair to the back of my neck. 

“But you don't care.” His voice was suddenly too close, tickling my ear. “You won't even let me tell you my story.”

I was barely conscious when the knife scraped across my arm. 

I felt the tease of tearing me apart, ripping me limb from limb, just like them. 

She didn't even have to speak, only grazing the blade over my arms and legs, drawing blood across my cheek. 

I felt the knife slice into me, slowly, and I knew she was going to take her time. 

“I haven't figured you out yet, Becca,” she hummed. “I want to mould you perfectly.”

She dragged the blade across my skin. 

“You're my starring role. I want to get you just right.”

Swimming in and out of consciousness, I waited to die. 

A loud bang startled me, but it wasn't enough to pull me from the fog. 

Before I knew what was happening, the girl made up of my friends was being dragged away by the people in white, and I was screeching through sobs, my body felt wrong, like it was no longer attached to me. 

The girl disappeared from my sight, and I was left staring dazedly at the ceiling, stars dancing in my eyes. 

I kept saying it until my throat was raw. 

*I've found them.* 

When the paramedics arrived, I was still screaming garbled words mixed with puke. 

*They're there!* I shrieked over and over and over again, until a mask was choking my mouth and nose. 

I was put back together, and my friends were not. 

I had real stitches and scars across my body. 

They were still prisoners. 

The sheriff came to see me, informing  me that Stella Atwood (her apparent real name) had been arrested for kidnapping and attempted murder. 

My attempted murder. 

I can't say I was fully with it from the drugs, but the sheriff definitely knew what I was saying. 

He said things like, “Oh, you're not thinking straight. Let me come back later.” 

When I told him the girl who tried to kill me was made up of the missing kids.. 

That she had killed them, and stitched and knitted their body parts to her own body. 

He just shook his head and told me to get some rest. 

But I saw that look in his eye, that slight twitch in his lips. 

He knew exactly what I was talking about. Even worse, this bastard was trying to hide it. In the space of three days, Stella Atwood no longer existed. 

When I demanded to see her and point out the stitches covering her body, the CLEAR patchwork skin where she had sewn pieces of them into her own flesh, I was told “the perpetrator” had been transferred to a psychiatric facility for young people. 

Taia’s mother slapped me across the face when I told her that her daughter was dead, and Stella was *wearing* her. 

I was called an insensitive “highly disturbed” child. 

My own mother threatened to disown me if I didn't keep my mouth shut. 

So, I shut my mouth. 

I graduated high school, moved out of town, and never looked back. 

I cut my Mom out of my life, because fuck that. 

Presently, I was kneeling on my kitchen floor stuffing myself with my daughter’s candy. The sky was dark through the windows, and my head was filled with fog. 

I was covered in chocolate and I felt physically sick, but if I was eating, I wasn't thinking. I learned that in the white room. 

When someone knocked on my door, I was already on my feet, a kitchen knife squeezed between my fingers. I had been waiting for her. 

I always fantasized what I was going to do to Stella when I found her again. 

Sometimes, I wanted to plead with her to give them back to me. 

While others, I imagined myself hacking the bitch apart to get them back. 

But when she was standing at my door, fifteen years later, I found myself paralysed. 

I thought if I could stay still and quiet, she might go away. 

“Becca?”

My fiancé's voice was like a wave of cool water coming over me. 

“Bex, why is the door locked?”

I don't know how I caught a hold of myself. 

“Sorry.” I managed to call to him, grabbing a towel and scrubbing my face. 

I was opening the door, trying to think of an excuse for my momentary lapse in sanity, when Karen stepped inside in three heel clacks. 

She was wearing Adam’s face. 

“Bex, what *happened*?”

The first thing I saw was the clumsy line of stitches across her forehead. 

Adam’s voice dripped from her tongue, phantom bugs filling my mouth, seeing every part of my fiance moulded into her face. 

His awkward smile and the twitch in his eye, that curl in his lip when he was trying not to laugh. I could see fresh skin grafts glued to her face, intentionally clumsy. She *wanted* me to see Adam. 

Or what was left of Adam.

The girl pulled me into a  hug, and something warm and wet dripped onto my shoulder, oozing down my arm. Her body pressed against mine felt *loose* somehow, like she wasn't yet complete.

“Mommy, I like Stella.”

Phoebe. 

She had my daughter’s voice. 

Her face. 

The way she scrunched up her eyes when she was excited. 

“She's really nice!” Phoebe’s giggle burst from her mouth. 

Before I could utter a word, the woman leaned forward, whispering in my ear, my fiancé's low murmur grazing the back of my neck. “Do you remember the old theater  in our town? Be there at 11 tonight to watch our showcase, and there might just be a little surprise waiting for you.”

Karen left, but I was still standing there, seconds, minutes, and a full hour passing by. I vaguely remember my neighbor asking if I was okay. I told her I was fine. 

“Where's your daughter?” she asked. “I don't think I've seen Phoebe today.”

“She's at her grandfather’s.” I responded. 

“Okay, but where's your fiance? Becca, are you all right? Is that… chocolate?”

This woman was always sticking her nose over our fence. She thrived on gossip, calling me out for being a bad Mom when I missed Phoebe’s school play.

Something inside me snapped apart when she repeatedly asked where Adam was, trying to delve further and further into my psyche. 

She was the human embodiment of a pick axe knocking at my skull, and at that moment I was sure I would do something I would regret if she didn't shut up. 

Stella had taken away my friends, and now she had snatched the only thing keeping me alive, the only thing stopping me from self-destructing completely. 

I told her to go fuck herself, and mind her own business. 

Then I got into my car, and drove back to my hometown, to the old theater that was shut down when I was a teenager. 

The place was rundown, and I'm pretty sure it was a temporary homeless shelter at some point. 

The main entrance was locked, so I tried the fire door. 

“Becca.” Adam’s voice echoed down the hallway when I managed to squeeze myself inside. 

“I’m in the theater!”

I started towards a flickering light, only for it to fizzle out. 

“Don't you want popcorn first?” The new voice sent me into a stumbling run. 

*Liam*. 

But it was twenty six year old Liam.

Reaching the end of the hallway, I turned right. 

“It's left!” Taia’s laugh was older, and I found myself sprinting towards it. 

“Come on, Becca, you're going to miss the movie!” Kai joined in. 

When I reached the theater , it was exactly how I remembered it, a large oval-like room with plush red seats. 

Descending the steps, my shadow bounced across the old cinematic screen. 

“Take a seat, Bex.” 

Adam’s voice. 

I asked Stella where my daughter was, only to get Phoebe’s laugh in response. 

*“I'm here, Mommy!”*

My daughter’s voice had me sinking into a seat, my heart in my throat. 

The screen flashed on, blinding white, and I glimpsed several figures around me in the audience. There was a shadow next to me. When I twisted around, I realized *it* didn't have a head.

Looking closer, its arms were pinned behind its back.

“Eyes forward, Becca! You're not allowed spoilers.” Taia’s voice giggled. 

The screen illuminated with what looked like old footage. 

It was a park.

The camera zoomed in, capturing ten-year-old me with my face pressed against a tree. 

I felt the urge to get up, to escape from the screen, but I couldn't tear my eyes away. This was the footage that had haunted me my entire life, the reason I had been trying and failing to kill myself since I was a teenager. “Hide and seek!” my younger self announced cheerfully, turning to my friends. “You guys hide, and I'll find you!”

Liam folded his arms. “But why can't I count and *you* hide?”

I pushed him playfully. “Because I'm older.”

“By one month!”

Ignoring his protest, I turned away and began counting to twenty. 

Liam and Taia darted behind trees while Kai crouched in the sandbox, urging the others to stifle their giggles. 

I watched the moment I had been waiting for my whole life. 

Even now, I scanned the park through the screen for any signs of strangers. 

Strangers I swore weren't there when I was a child. I sat, paralyzed, half-expecting a mysterious figure to swoop in and whisk my friends away.

But that didn't happen.

I was still counting. 

“Eight!”

“Nine!”

“Ten!”

Liam suddenly emerged from his hiding spot, one hand covering his eye that was slipping from its socket. A wave of revulsion slowly crept up my throat. 

Taia stumbled out from behind the tree, her arm severed, dangling awkwardly. 

She tried in vain to reattach it, tears in her wide eyes, though she wasn't crying out. 

Kai struggled from the sandbox, his head unnaturally tilted, hands desperately clawing at his neck to keep it in place.

Where was the stranger? My mind was spinning.

There was no stranger.

Instead, a familiar face appeared. 

She rushed over to them, gesturing for them to be quiet.

*Mom*. 

Mom was harsh with the three, grabbing and yanking them away. 

When Liam’s eye rolled across the floor, she picked it up, stuffing it in her pocket. 

Her gaze met the camera for one single second, and she pulled a face. 

“Don't bother, Lily.” Mom spat. “Unless you want the entire town to know about your husband’s infidelity.” 

The camera footage faded out, white text appearing on the screen. 

**END OF PART ONE. COME BACK TOMORROW FOR PART TWO! :)**

But there was a ‘preview’ for the second part. 

I only had to see one frame, which was my mother standing in front of a room full of parents, a sign looming over her head with the words, **‘For a better tomorrow’** for me to lurch to my feet.

But I couldn't tear my eyes from the screen. 

Mom’s eyes were on the camera, wide and proud. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you–”

The movie ended, the cinema screen going dark. 

“Where is my daughter?” I didn't realize I was screaming. 

“Adam!” 

“Tomorrow, Becca.” My fiance’s voice bounced around the room, but I couldn't *see* him. “Come back tomorrow, all right? You need to watch the rest of the movie.”

The lights flickered on, and I was alone. 

Phoebe was gone. 

Adam was gone. 

The shadow next to me had already slipped away. 

I left the theater , and I'm in my car right now. 

I'm waiting for that psycho to come back. 

I've called my Mom, but she's not answering. 

I haven't spoken to her in years, but the LEAST she could do is answer her phone. 

She owes me an explanation. 

Fuck. I'm so fucking scared I've lost my daughter. 

Please tell me I haven't lost her like them. 

I CAN'T lose her too. 

Edit: I just saw the sheriff walking into the theater. There's no other reason why he'd be going inside, unless he's in on whatever this is.

If the sheriff is in on this, who else IS?
