I’m typing this from what’s left of my kitchen, blood soaking my shirt, dripping onto the laptop keys. The table’s cracked, one leg snapped from when it threw me, and the screen’s flickering—6% battery, no power, no hope. Carl's guts smeared on the wall. My arm’s shredded, red streaks climbing from the gash, and outside, the woods growl—deep, close, shaking the busted windows. I’ve got minutes before it finds me. I’m Matt, and this is all I’ve got left to tell you what it did—to Carl, the cops, the whole damn street. Don’t come here. Just know.

It started Sunday, I rent half a duplex off Route 9 in Poughkeepsie, New York—cheap, crumbling, walls so thin I hear my neighbor Carl’s every grunt. He’s a mess—40s, balding, always in a stained Carhartt jacket, stinking of cigarettes and regret. His dog, Brutus, lives in the backyard—a brindle mutt, pitbull maybe, wiry and restless, chained to a stake in the dirt. Sunday night, I heard it pacing—chain clinking, a low huff—longer than usual. I peeked out my bedroom window, blinds rattling, and saw it in the moonlight: head down, shoulders hunched, bigger than I remembered. Carl’s porch light flickered, and Brutus stared up—eyes glinting, too bright, like coins catching flame. I shivered, locked the window, and returned to bed, the clinking fading slowly.

Monday, it got stranger. I left for my warehouse shift at 7 a.m., boots crunching frost, and Carl was out there, hunched over Brutus with a flashlight. “Stay still, you mutt,” he muttered, voice tight, poking at the chain with a stick. Brutus growled—low, guttural, vibrating the fence—and Carl jolted back, stick snapping. I called out, “You good?” He waved me off, shaky, “Yeah, just… antsy.” But the dog looked wrong—taller, legs stretched, fur patchy like it was shedding fast. I drove off, unease gnawing, and worked 10 hours, forklifts humming, boxes thudding, my mind replaying that growl.

Tuesday, the stress kicked in. I got home at 6:30 p.m., the sky bruising purple, and heard a whine—sharp, keening, slicing through the dusk. Carl’s yard light buzzed, and Brutus was pressed against the fence, chain taut, eyes locked on my door. He was bigger—chest broad, ribs showing through thinning fur—and the air stank, sour, and meaty, like roadkill left too long. Carl burst out, shovel in hand, yelling, “Back off, you freak!” He swung; the blade clanged off Brutus’ side, and the dog turned—slow, deliberate—growling so deep my teeth buzzed. Carl’s face went white; he dropped the shovel, stumbled inside, door slamming. I locked up, heart racing, and watched through the blinds as Brutus sat, staring, till midnight, when the light died and the whine stopped.

Wednesday, I cracked. Couldn’t sleep—kept hearing that sound, a loop in my skull—and called in sick, hands trembling around my coffee mug. Mrs. Hensley, the nosy widow across the street, pounded on Carl’s door at 10 a.m., screeching about her cat, “That damn dog ate my Muffin!” No answer. The chain lay coiled in the yard, Brutus gone. I texted Carl—*Where’s your dog?*—nothing back. I paced, floorboards creaking, checking windows every five minutes. At noon, a cop car rolled up—Officers Rodriguez and Kim, badges glinting, voices sharp over the radio. They knocked, waited, got silence. Rodriguez stepped into the yard, flashlight sweeping the shed—wooden, padlocked, still. Kim smirked, “What, he’s hiding it?” Then the lock rattled—soft, once, twice.

Thursday, it broke. I hadn’t slept, eyes burning, coffee cold, when the shed door creaked—slow, hinges whining—at 6 a.m. Rodriguez froze; Kim drew her Glock, “Show yourself!” The wood splintered—slow at first, cracks spidering—then blew apart, shards flying, and Brutus came out. Not a dog anymore. Nine feet tall, fur sloughing off gray, glistening flesh, claws like machetes gouging the dirt. Its jaw unhinged, teeth jagged and red, roaring—a wet, bone-rattling bellow. Rodriguez fired—three shots, muzzle flashing—but the bullets sank into its hide, useless. It swiped; his chest tore open, ribs snapping, blood hosing the fence. Kim screamed, shot twice—sparks, no dent—and it grabbed her throat, lifting, skull popping like a grape, brains smearing the grass.

Carl ran out, shotgun booming—pellets peppered its flank, black ooze trickling—but it turned, 10 feet now, and charged. Claws ripped his gut, intestines spilling, shotgun clattering as it bit—neck gone, head lolling, body slumping. I bolted inside, shoved my dresser against the door, heart slamming. The street erupted—Hensley’s scream cut short, her porch crunching, a cop car crashing, sirens dying. Two more officers ran in, guns blazing—torn apart, limbs scattered, blood pooling in gutters. I peeked: Brutus was 12 feet, eyes glowing red, sniffing my way, claws scraping my siding—slow, deliberate.

It hit at 1 a.m. Front door buckled, wood splintering, and it filled the room—14 feet, a wall of meat, stink like a slaughterhouse. I swung a bat—cracked its jaw, bounced off—but it roared, claw slashing my chest, skin peeling, ribs flashing. I fell, crawled under the sink; it swiped, pipes bursting, water spraying. I threw a pot—clanged its head, bought a stumble—then ran upstairs, blood slicking the steps, barricading my room with a dresser. It tore through—wall exploding, ceiling caving, claws punching holes—and I dove out the window, roof tiles cutting my palms, landing hard—ankle snapping, leg screaming. Limped into the woods, pines whipping my face, collapsing in a ditch till dawn, shivering, bleeding.

Back now, the duplex is rubble—walls gone, Carl’s torso in the yard, cops shredded, blood steaming in the cold. Brutus is out there—tracks gouging the earth, leading off. I’m posting, chest throbbing, fever spiking—red lines creeping from the wound, vision blurring. The woods growl—snaps, snarls, closer. Claw marks scar my floor, wet, moving—*moving*—and the house shakes. I’ve got a knife, no chance. It’s Matt—tell them it’s not a dog. Tell them it’s still growing. I hear it—tearing the trees, roaring—under me now. This is it.
