Peeking my head around the alleyway, my heart dropped in my chest. My eyes wandered down the piss-filled alleyway. My friends struggled in a giant spider web. The blinking streetlamp tossed them in and out of the darkness. In their dresses made for clubbing, they humped the air desperate to escape. The contrast of the night was not lost on me. If we had made it to the rave, the flashing blue lights would have revealed drunk smiling faces and not crying mascara-stained ones. If we had made it to the rave, Charlie X would have drowned them out if they called my name. Instead, they were loud and clear.



Giant webs without spiders had invaded my city. Be careful—many are getting caught in them. Yes, you would have to be a fool to get in one, but never underestimate your own proficiency for foolishness. The webs weave lies that have ensnared my friends and enemies alike. Walk down the street of my town, and every mouth froths with the webbing's-words. Some mouths drool out the webbing itself. Sometimes the webbing can be felt. On occasion, the webbing can only be felt. And even rarer, you can be trapped in it.



"Nathan, Nathan help, please! I can't get out!" The words haunted the alleyway. I could have sworn they brought a chill with them. 



But they were my friends.



Their cries propelled me to action. Sweat soaked through my shirt on that blistering summer night. I yanked out my shears, a common weapon we all wielded for times like this. Stumbling with them in my hand, I was grateful for the embarrassing moments in darkness. Ce-Ce let out a small giggle I’d recognize her laugh anywhere partly because nothing could stop it despite how frightening the situation was. 



Regardless, shears set, I got to cutting.



Snipping, snapping, slicing, and even beating one string like the shears were a club—it was the only sane way to break even one string. The nearest string bounced and pulsed like a man breathing his last breath until it fell away. One down. There was more work to do to save the girls. 



My eyes teared with effort. I groaned in tired embarrassment. The small of my back burned in warning of overuse. My brain went numb. The satisfying snip was all I could hear. The girls and I were connected with the web; its destruction was our joy.  In a way, it was sort of like we were at the club right? It was a sort of dance. It took a lot of effort like dancing. Just no reward in the end I guess.



Finally, enough was cut. They could be free.



"You can drop down, it's safe," I called.



"Ugh, why?" one groaned.



The light flashed again, and I wished for it to be buried so I couldn't see them as they looked now. The girls swung like happy monkeys from webs, their faces twisted with demonic baboon smiles that wobbled.



"What's wrong?" one asked me.



"Why are you looking at us like that?" said another.



"Come down," I said, turning from their weirdness. I swallowed my fear and contempt, plastering a smile on my face.



The girls exchanged glances with the ground floor beneath them. It was not such a jump but a small leap of faith perhaps.



"I think I'll stay up here," one said.



"I'll stay up here as well," said another.



Thoughts of the past skittered in my head like a thousand roaches awakened in a cave. My mother was lost to the web. She still hangs in one. She tried to put me in one. She did put me in one. Sticking, smelling, dripping, burning, abrading, ripping my skin raw to the touch. I cried. No one cared. But I did escape before the wretched spiders came. My mother still swings there. I didn’t want the same to happen to them.



"We need to leave!" I yelled again.



"No, I think we're fine here. The web's keeping us safe from what's below us," one said.



"That could be a nasty fall," said another.



"Trust me, just drop. I'll save you."



"I... I don't know if I can trust you."



"We see the way you look at us. Like we're just something strange now," one of them said.



"Sorry, sorry, I'm not trying to—I just—" I paused, frustrated about having to break down this simple thing to them. Webs mean spiders. Large webs mean large spiders. Think, you idiots! Don't you get it?



"See," one said.



"You're making that face again. You hate us," the other said.



"You think we're idiots," one said.



"He thinks we're freaks," said another.



Yes, yes, yes, it was all true because they sat in their web repeating lies, waiting comfortably, while a spider would come to devour them. Did they think a web came from nowhere? That you could sit in a web and a spider would never come? I mumbled a lie hoping to soothe them, so forgettable I couldn't recall it to mention here.



"Let's go, Kayla," I guess Ce-Ce said.



"Yes, to the center of the web," Kayla said, and the two crawled away, all my hard work undone.



And there they wobble still, only leaving to let more webs leave their mouths as they nest in webs. Soon, the spider will [come.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Finchink/)
