So in 2021 I was recently divorced and was looking for a place to rent, but in town where I was living there weren’t any affordable places because in our town there are a lot of tourists who like to buy apartments so the prices are way up there and if anything affordable gets on the market it’s gone by hours. So I’m living with my parents and one day I am surfing on internet and I see this 2 room apartament just near town I want to live with all new appliances for affordable price. So immediately I picked up my phone and called the owner and organised meeting.

I get to the apparent and it’s great I mean all new appliances and it came with all the furniture ready to move in. Only thing for that moment that I thought was weird was that it felt really cold in there, but owner kind of calmed me down by saying that it was not being heated for couple of months because it was empty and that’s why it feels cold, but as soon I will move in they will show me how to operate the heating system and it would be “ nice and cosy” so I said great, paid them down money and next morning I was planing to move in.

So next day I moved in the apartment and it was great I felt like I hit the jackpot, everything was fine and even heating system started to work and even trough it still felt a bit cold I thought with time the walls will heat and it will be fine. I went to local store and bought all the stuff I needed and was unpacking my things. So the evening came and I went to bed. I climbed in bed put my sheets on and tried to sleep. I just could not explain but at that moment I felt that bedroom is colder than other rooms I just thought maybe with time it will get better and just tried to sleep, but eventually I started to look outside my bedroom door which I left open for the heat from other rooms to get in and I suddenly got this uncomfortable feeling that somebody is watching me from doorway so I kind of glimpsed and there were no one., so I get out of my bed and went and closed doors. I still got this wierd feeling but I wrote it down of just being in a new place and went to sleep.

So a few weeks went by and my girlfriend started to visit me with her one year old boy. She usually stayed for 2-3 days a week overnight with me. Also my 5 years old daughter also visited and stayed with me 2-3 days a week. So there were always people in that apartment and everything was fine. When I was alone I always felt that something is off I just could not describe the feeling, but I rather was with someone in there than alone.

After few weeks my girlfriend decided to move in with me with her one year old and we started to live together.  At first everything felt great but in one evening we decided to go for a walk around neighbourhood and I kind of noticed that all the lights in buildings around us and all the other apartments were kind of low like there were some lights but I just felt oddly quiet and like people just didn’t want to be seen. I told that to my girlfriend that and she said yeah I noticed that also. She also turned to me and asked do you feel like somebody is behind you? I said no why? And she replied I just feel that somebody is walking behind us. At that time I didn’t want to worry her so I did not tell her about my feeling in apartment. So we kind of laughed it off and went back home.

When we got back home I told my girlfriend I will sleep on the coach in living room because her one year old was having hard time sleeping in bed while I was there so I thought maybe if they were sleeping alone he will get used to new place sooner. So we went to bed and I woke up at 2 in morning and my tv was on. I though well that’s weird because I know I turned it off and also it was playing some series from Netflix so I thought if I pushed remote in my sleep then maybe I could turned it on but still it did not explain why the series witch I have never watched was on. But I was too tired and didn’t think much of it and went back to sleep. Next day my girlfriend asked me why did you watch tv so late and I explained her that at 2 it was on and maybe I turned it on while sleeping just pushing against remote and she told me no tv was on multiple times trough night it seemed weird because you turned it on for few minutes and then switched it off. She could see tv from her bed wich was on wall in living room but she could not see me so I played it off by saying it’s a new tv maybe something is wrong with settings. Then after few days I started to notice than on mornings my shoe laces were tied in 7-8 knots., and that felt weird because I know I untied them every night when coming home and also there were no explanations why so many knots. I just thought maybe her one year old played with them, but still in my mind I knew it’s probably not what happened. 

Then after few weeks things really started to get more serious. My girlfriend asked me why do I put her complex keys in right pocket of her coat. I said I did not do that and she told there is no way she would put them in right side because she always thought that was bad luck and she always makes sure keys are in her left pocket. I just said well you are being silly and maybe you just put them in the wrong pocket. We kind of argued for a while but we left it at that. Also we started to notice that we felt extremely low energy and lifeless at that complex like we did not have any joy in life and thinking back all the people from that village seemed that way like someone or something has drained them from their life force.

After key incident a few days passed and we were chilling one evening and her little boy was suddenly crying and pointing to the corner of complex he was scared out of his mind and did not want to get near that corner. I tried to calm him down and showed him that the corner is empty but for me I felt unsettling because even through the room corner was empty it seemed it was unusually dark there like someone or something was them with dark presence. So my girlfriend took a pinch of salt through it on the corner and immediately it went bright, and her child also became peaceful. We kind of talked about it but I just said maybe there was bad energy and kids can see it so it just passed through. You must remember me and my girlfriend it’s not easy to scare us even though it started to get to me that something is off. Later that night we stayed up until 3 after midnight and we started to hear scratching sounds, it came from our hallway wall like someone behind it were scratching it with long claws or nails I put my ear against wall and I could not hear anything else just this scratching it was otherwise dead quiet there. But we knew that right behind our hallway door was another apartament where old lady was staying with her grandson so I just thought maybe she has some kind of problems and that’s why she’s doing that even trough it felt incredibly creepy. The scratching sounds continued for a few minutes and then it stopped and there was dead quiet from our walls, but every night from then on right at 3 it came back.

Also I need to mention that at that point and few months later I always wanted a wooden cross but could not find one to buy. Then at one point I was walking from my job and saw one laying on the floor I picked it up and left it hanging so the person who lost it could found it a few days went by and cross was still there so I decided to take it and I put it around my neck. I don’t know why but it just seemed that I need it. So funny thing is while I was sleeping at apartment every morning the cross was off me like somebody has purposely take it off me durning night. So every morning I put it back on. 

Then one night while I was sleeping on the couch like I usually did I was almost a sleep and I started no notice that something is bitting my hand and it felt like human teeth I just waived my hand in air and thought to myself that it’s just my mind playing tricks to me so I tried to sleep and there was this sense of voice telling me go to sleep you need to sleep and at that moment deep down I felt another voice telling me you can’t sleep it’s not safe so I slowly resisted sleep and as soon as I decided to stay up I felt someone bite my other hand which was hanging out of coach on the side and this time I definitely felt bite it was no dream. It scared me and for the first time I thought alright this is getting out of hand. 

The next day my girlfriend and her boy went to her mothers and my daughter were visiting me, we had a great day and at the evening she was sitting in the sofa watching tv and I was in kitchen and then suddenly she looked at me with this scared face and told me me daddy I saw a face behind you with red eyes and sharp teeth I immediately looked around and there was no one so I told her maybe you just watched too much tv and that’s way you were imagining things she told me maybe and we left it at that. I did not tell my girlfriend that experience because I did not want to scare her and I honestly thought that it wasn’t real.

So the next day my daughter is with her mother and my girlfriend and her boy is staying at our place on the evening I drove to play some sports and left them at home I was 30 minutes in to my training when I got message from my girlfriend “drive home immediately there was something with red eyes and sharp teeth in apartment watching us” My heart just sink and I just immediately left the gym and went straight home I went in our apartment and there was my girlfriend sitting on our sofa trying to calm down her one year old boy who was crying without stopping. I immediately went through all the rooms and told her what happened? She told me she was sitting in sofa and her one year old was playing when she suddenly felt that apartment got cold so she went to check heating system. So she goes there  and everything is fine and the she suddenly hears her one year old screaming and crying so she immediately goes back to living room and her boy is pointing at something in kitchen she looks over and she sees dark figure standing there with white face red eyes and sharp teeth just staring at them and smiling. Then I don’t know what went in her mind maybe  mothers instinct but she slowly approached that thing and his smile went from creepy to angry like he was purposely showing his teeth and as closer she get the more cold she got. Then when she was about 6feet from him he slowly went through our wall/window just looking her dead in eye. She closed the curtains looked out and it was gone. And then she texted me.

When I heard what happened you must think I be scared but actually I was incredibly angry I wanted to see it and fight it because he threatened my kids I don’t know what got into me. So I took some church candles what we had in home light them on and they started to burn with bright light and black smoke came out of them also the lamps in kitchen started to swing and they were heavy lamps so there is no way a breeze could swing them.  I said enough is enough we put all the lights on and stayed through night I did not sleep and just was kind of on guard. 

Next day I drove my girlfriend and her boy to her mothers and went back packing things I did it as fast as possible but it felt that somebody was behind me all the time and I got cold sweats even though it was warm. Even trough I packed as fast as possible I could not pack all things so I knew I need to go back next day and I felt horrible about that but still what needed to be done needs to be done so I threw my last bag in car and went back in apartment and I saw that we had this church picture of saint Mary so I don’t know why but i decided to put it on closet shelf so it could be seen when going inside apartment because in my mind I kind of wanted to piss off that thing that was in that apartment. So I left went back the next day opened apartments door to grab my last thing and I immediately looked up at the closet and on the top shelf where this saint picture was from yesterday and there was other things put before it like somebody has made sure that that it’s hidden and not in plain sight. I must be honest here that scared me. I packed as fast I could and get away from that place. 
So that’s my story also the wooden cross I was telling you about I don’t know where it was but after all that it went missing for me I think it just did his mission and protected me through all this.

So I hope you enjoyed this it’s a true story and I hope no one of you guys would have to live through it.
