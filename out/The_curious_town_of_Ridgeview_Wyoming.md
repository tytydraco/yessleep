Part 1
I want to start by apologizing I’m not a writer and this is my first time ever writing a story. My name is Mike Aarons, and I recently got into a car crash. I received some pretty terrible injuries, however none felt worse than my memories coming back. I could never really remember my childhood, no, more like I had a thin vail of what felt like a childhood. I think I remember going to school and having friends and parents but it’s a single amalgamation of blurry memories. 

After this accident about 2 hours from writing this my memories are slowly coming back. It’s painful, and vivid like I’m experiencing a movie in my head for the first time. Everything feels like a normal childhood however, there are stand out moments that are just…strange. I’d like to document these newfound memories incase I lose them again. Seeing as this would be the only thing left to remember Ridgeview. 

It was lost to a sinkhole that swallowed the whole town. The town itself being roughly 12 miles in diameter, 17 if you include the farms. The government said it was an aqueduct that eventually caused the place to collapse after years constant pressure.

Ridgeview was like a desktop wallpaper. Pleasant trees and vibrant colors painted the perfect cover of it. Natures scent guided it’s lone walk throughout the town, granting a feeling of hopefulness. Depression rates were always drastically low and everyone felt motivated to go about their day with pure optimism. It was a blissful haze. Neighborhoods built in pleasing shapes and the cream of the crops being the farms, the hospital, and the church. Though, my buddy Kev and I loved the library the most. New comers found it almost heavenly and we had plenty of those. The former towns folk coming to visit the nest after spreading their wings always brought company.

It looked perfect but there’s always just something out of place. Like how there were no cars, everyone rode bikes, skateboards, or walked. If you had a car you had to keep it about a 2 miles walk from town where there was a designated parking lot. Yet no one seemed to question it. There were somethings that I just thought as a kid that were normal because I’d seen no different. When I got my first car, after leaving the town, it felt almost wrong. I pretty much almost crashed it as soon as I got it, sorry to that lady and her fence if you read this. When pumping gas I still have to cover my nose, the smell of it gives me a headache. 

This story is about the strange day April 4 2009, I was 12 years old. I remember picking up the local Ridgeview newspaper, written by Charles Leslee. It was Sunday, news was always delivered on Sundays, and the sun was breaming. ‘I’m gonna take my bike out and see Kev’ I thought to myself picking up the much anticipated pieces of bundled paper. I wasn’t one for the news just seemed like bumbling garble I was there for the real treasure. The cartoons. Specifically Garfield and his antics. It’s strange to realize now why I love Garfield, seeing as I couldn’t remember the contents of Ridgeview’s Garfield. It was actually how I confirmed my suspensions that this isn’t just a dream or something that could be caused by the accident. I’m familiar with the comics and they were just slightly off. Like Garfield telling Odie that he’s an idiot for wandering off on his own, whereas the original just called him stupid for being a dog. But this one, on the same day the newspaper dropped, the same day Charles Leslee died, was just different.

It was a fairly normal comic, however the bottom credit signatures were from Charles rather than Garfield’s creator. John, sick of Garfield always taking his lasagna, hides it somewhere in the house so he can go to work knowing that Garfield can’t get it. Chicanery  ensues with Garfield accidentally summoning lasagna aliens. I remember cackling at him being willing to trade Odie for a lifetime supply, but they didn’t take dogs. John comes back with his Lasagna gone but laughs saying “I guess I can’t hide anything from you, that’s why I have a spare!”. The comic ends on a panel of all of the characters laughing having a good time, however, Johns face is replaced with a hyper realistic face. I bursted into laughter because it kept the cartoony outline of John it was just a real dudes face in the middle. Then I realized it was our towns mayor, Cecil Gardener. 

I put the paper down, cleaning the joy and slight confusion off my face and looked towards adventure. “MOM! I’m going to see Kev!” I yelled already in opening the garage for my sick ride. “OKAY HONEY! BE SAFE!” She called back from I think the kitchen, I don’t know, I already closed the door. Clasping my hands together I see the finest red and silver bike I’ve ever seen. “Helloooo Ellie” I said ready to rip off. 

Kevs (short for Kenneth, he hated being called Ken) was a couple houses down from mine. We bonded over Garfield and talked about starting our own cartoons all the time. We would draw for hours and come up with all kinds of ideas. 

Knock knock, the sound of unlocking greeted by a smiling woman. “Hi Mike! How’re you today!” She said still smiling. “Good, is Kev here?” I asked. “He’s getting ready as we speak!” Still smiling. “Cool thanks!” I said trying to collect my racing thoughts of all the things we could make. Kev came outside with the grace of broken glass, tripping on his door frame, trying not loose balance with his backpack filled with art supplies. “DUDE! MY MOM GOT PAID AND SHE GOT ME MORE COLORED PENCILS! Like the expensive ones!” He said not even trying to contain his excitement. We cheered, to the both of us it felt like Christmas. 

We mounted our vehicles and set sail for creativity, the library. Riding through the town was always a joy, the smell of fresh pastries and nature always felt so warm. We saw more people riding their bikes going on their adventures. “Hey what’d you think of the new Garfield strip?” I said over the wind. “I dunno I haven’t read it yet” Ellie screeched with as much disbelief as mine. “WHAT!? Dude what’re we doing” I said shocked that he wasn’t more upset. He shrugged, “my dad got the newspaper, then locked himself away for a bit. When I asked him about it he said there wasn’t a strip on there”. “Well he’s a liar, we’ll check it out when we get to the library” I said scornfully. ‘How could his dad keep Garfield from him?’ The thought making me more angry every time I pondered it. We start riding again and turn onto the shopping district. The library is about couple blocks down from the boutique shop. 

We stop our bikes. “Who is that?” Kev said, words hung by dread and confusion. Before us stood a sickly man, wailing and whining. His cries like a wounded animal, incoherent. He slurred, slobbered and spat. His eyes stained glass red and frantic. “Is that…” I squinted seeing a needle sticking out from the connection between his forearm and bicep. The middle of his bicep tightened by a belt. His ghastly features all the more apparent with closing distance. He had a long burly bread, maintained like a forest overrun with weeds. Accompanied by shiny, locked together hair, caked in enough oil to fill a fryer. 

“PRIEeEeeSH!” He screamed and moaned “PRIEeEEeSH EeRP *slurp* eEE”. I watched back in shock. My mind was racing with thoughts ‘who is this guy?’ ‘What’s that needle for?’ ‘Is this a seizure?’ A shadow looms. I looked up and saw the authority already coming to intervene. 
 
We didn’t have police, or we did they were just different. They were called the authority, wore porcelain masks and tall cylindrical hats. Every single one of them were in peak physical condition. Other than that everything was practically the same as a regular officer. Blue shirt, pants, black bullet proof vest, black shoes. 

I couldn’t even comprehend what I was looking at before they hoisted the man by his armpits. Two standing on either side and in unison said “WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.” As they turned and started walking down the street. None of them budged as the man kicked and wailed. He turned saying the only thing in perfect English “don’t let them take me”. As he proceeded back to his apish assault, the authority just kept walking. I looked around and everyone returned about their day. I looked at Kev, pale and Solemn, he said what were both were thinking. “I think I wanna go home.”
