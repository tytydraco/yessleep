New update to the maplejelly archive. This started as lolcow shit, but atp I just hope someone smarter than me knows what the fuck is happening. He hasn't posted since the group link expired.

Below is the post, unedited (minus the links):


Hello hello r/ maplebaby 

Sorry I haven't posted in a while. Some people might know why I got burnt out, but the Maple Baby fandom is my community and I won't let hate make me leave. I'm really tired of the mapletok community (I know everybody here is.) I wanted to know what people think of all the discourse. It makes me so mad. I knew people would want me to speak up about it, especially people here who know Maple's love is unconditional.

You probably know Chuchu and are either cringing or have a life and don't know what's going on. Whichever you are, if you post here, you definitely know how awesome Chuchu is as a mod and friend. She is also my partner, which is what the issue is, I guess. She is just the newest target for maplefruit haters. This is all over the stomach discourse. Yeah. Ugh. 

 I'll start by saying I just really wish people would lay off. Yes, I am young, and I'm not immortal, but I was the one that asked Chuchu out and who likes it. I'm not a blood bag. I have really liked stomach sharing since I joined the MB fandom... even before, probably. I mean, most people who watch MB probably know what I mean. Of course, the awesome fan content doesn't hurt.
 
Anyway, people are trying to frame Chu as a villain for SS. I think if you've felt somebody opening you up and actually getting through the meat and fat, you know it's not like that. It's really special to me. Being a teenager doesn't make it different... in 7th grade, I survived the whole year off remembering how chuchu rolled my kidney in her hand at our first meetup. Like when you are dealing with stuff at home and you remember how much somebody loves you that they would literally hug your insides (and trust me they don't look like in MB, they are way grosser at first but amazing.) I just feels like... probably just how Maple felt.

Seriously, I am linking this one fanart that captures everything I felt the first time. Real ones also know chan board has more info for irl. (Pls don't ban my post for mentioning) I was scared at first, but now I can't go back to being somebody who doesn't know how it feels to get melted like lard.

People think Chuchu is some monster when she is why I get to know how good it feels to know you're a million nerves and little cells and know your name and age and memories don't matter. Like  how am I gonna get sad about algebra when you can take me apart bit by bit, and I'll feel it, but each piece keeps living. I don't have to exist if I don't want to. I just think about how you can love every ridge of my brain until its divided into past, present, future, and that if Chu did that, she'd still love every one of them equally. We are honestly thinking of doing brainshare based on this one fic.(Honestly, I do wish Maple had gone to Fruits side because an ending where just his nervous system is left would be so satisfying At least we have the fandom who honestly probably does it better than the show could.) 

If anything, the downside is when I CAN'T do SS. my brain literally hurts sometimes when there's a recovery period. Like my brain is pressing against the front of my skull, but the rest of me is empty. (Lol I know bc it's a recovery period obviously I'm not empty.) It's a million times harder because Chu is across the country and it's not like I'm helpful with plane ticket costs. She is the sweetest person ever, though, and listens to me crying over the phone and sends me brain stuff in care packages. The people harassing us don't care about that, tho. 

Anyway, yeah. Tbh, in the end, I was just hoping to get some support from y'all. MB Reddit is forever the best community in this fandom and I knew you'd get it.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the support! I talked to Chuchu about people asking to be our friend, have a group chat, share me, etc, and she thought it was awesome. I'm hype, too, so you can DM us for the GC link! This community is awesome. I really do feel loved, which isn't easy for me. ðŸ’— - Jelly
