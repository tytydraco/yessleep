Every Saturday night, it’s the same: snacks on the coffee table, soda cans cracking open, the laughter of close friends echoing in my living room as we set up for game night.

There’s me, Jenna, Mike, Claire, and Jordan. We’ve been doing this for over a year now, rotating between Catan, Betrayal at House on the Hill, and sometimes the chaotic energy of Uno. It’s predictable, cozy, fun—until the night Jordan brings something… different.

A Ouija board.

At first, I think he’s joking. The cheap cardboard thing looks like something from a Halloween clearance bin. But he’s got this weird, excited grin and insists we give it a shot.

“Just for fun,” he says.

Mike shrugs. “Whatever. Beats losing to Jenna at Catan again.”

So we clear the table, light a couple candles for “vibes,” and sit in a circle. The lights are dimmed. The air feels oddly heavy, like the room is holding its breath.

We place our fingers on the planchette.

Jordan asks the first question.

“Is anyone there?”

Nothing happens. I want to laugh. I expect someone to push it as a joke.

Then, it moves.

At first I think it's Claire. But the way her eyes widen, it doesn't look like she’s faking it. The planchette slowly glides to “YES.”

Mike snorts. “Who’s doing that?”

No one answers.

The air grows colder.

We ask another question.

“What’s your name?”

The planchette spells: I - S - S - A.

None of us speak.

Then it starts moving faster:
D - O - N - T - S - T - A - Y

Claire jerks her hand away. “Nope. I’m done.”

Jordan laughs nervously. “It’s just a game.”

But something in the room has shifted. The warmth of our usual nights is gone. It feels wrong. Off.

We pack up the board, but the unease doesn’t leave.

That’s when things start getting weird.

The next week, Claire is… different. She shows up late, quiet. Her smile doesn’t quite reach her eyes. And when she laughs, it’s too loud. Forced.

The week after, Mike changes. He doesn’t argue over rules anymore. He just stares at people too long, too intensely, like he’s waiting for something. His eyes look darker, somehow.

Then Jenna. She always brought snacks—chips, candy, cookies—but now she brings nothing. Just sits, watching. Like she’s studying us.

I try to ignore it, chalk it up to a bad mood, stress, whatever.

But tonight, it’s just me and Jordan left.

He looks at me across the table, that same grin he had when he brought the board. But now it feels… wrong. Crooked.

“We should play again,” he says.

My heart is racing. I don’t want to. Everything inside me is screaming not to.

“I think I’m good,” I say.

He stands up slowly. The others, sitting around the room, turn their heads toward me—almost in sync.

“You’re the last one,” Jordan says, voice low.

My breath catches.

“What?”

They all stand.

Claire’s eyes are completely black now. No whites, no pupils.

Mike tilts his head, the bones in his neck crackling unnaturally.

Jenna’s mouth stretches too wide, splitting at the corners like her skin is paper.

I back away until I hit the wall.

They take a step forward, all at once.

“I don’t want this,” I whisper.

But the air is heavy again. I can’t move.

The candles flicker and die out.

Darkness swallows the room.

Their voices echo in unison, not theirs anymore:

“Now it’s your turn.”

I  don’t think.

I just run.

My legs move on instinct, away from their hollow voices, their too-silent steps. I sprint down the hallway, heart hammering in my chest, and slam the bathroom door shut behind me.

Click the lock.

Back away.

I press myself into the corner between the sink and the tub, barely able to breathe. I can hear them outside—bare feet on tile, slow and deliberate.

Jenna’s voice, right outside the door. Sweet and syrupy.

“Come on. It’s still game night.”

The doorknob rattles. Softly at first. Then harder.

Then they start knocking. Slow. Rhythmic. Like a chant.

Knock.
Knock.
Knock.

My phone’s still in my pocket. Thank God.

I pull it out with shaking hands, fingers trembling as I open Reddit—r/paranormal, the only place I can think to go.

I start typing:

[URGENT] Please help me. My friends are being replaced.

I know how this sounds. I don’t even believe in this kind of stuff. But something is happening and I’m scared.
Every Saturday, me and my friends have board game night. Last week, one of them brought a Ouija board. I didn’t want to play, but we all did anyway. Something answered us.

It told us to leave.
We didn’t listen.

Now… they’re not the same. One by one, they changed. At first it was subtle. Then it wasn’t. Their eyes. Their voices. The way they move like they’re puppets on invisible strings.

Now they’re all outside the bathroom door.

They’re trying to get in.

I’m the last one left. I don’t know what they want but I don’t think I’ll be me if they get in. I can’t call 911. My phone won’t dial out. The signal’s just gone. Like it never existed.

Please.
Someone.
If you know anything—how to reverse this, how to stop it—anything. I don’t want to end like them. I don’t want to disappear inside whatever they’ve become.

I hear them whispering now. My name, over and over, like a prayer.

They know I’m typing.

They’re laughing.

I don’t know how long this door will hold.

Please help me.

I am now posting this here on r/nosleep as well, because I am terrified. "Please someone help me before it's too...

I was just joking before, what I really am posting here for is too see if anyone wants to join our game night group we are dying to have you join us.
