I stretched and yawned as I arose from my bed on a Saturday morning.  A smile formed on my face as the beloved scent of breakfast cooking made its way into my nose. I opened  my door and started down the stairs. I took a sharp turn at the bottom of the stairs and instantly froze when my eyes met the scene in front of me.  

I stared in utter terror at my mothers mutilated body and severed head that lay on the floor in front of me. A pool of blood slowly got bigger at her side. I must have stood there for 10 minutes just staring at the horrific scene. I wanted to stop staring so badly, but I just could not.  Finally, reality kicked in and I knew I needed to do something. *I need to tell my brother.*

I ran up the stairs. I  turned to my brother's door in the hallway and turned the knob. *It was locked.*  That was very unusual for him. He always went on about how he had nothing to hide and that's why he never locked his door. 

“JAMES!!!” I yelled my brother's name in complete panic.

“Hey, I'm busy , give me a second.” he replied.  He sounded unusually calm for the amount of panic I had expressed to him in my voice. 

“JAMES, MOM IS FUCKING DEAD!” I  yelled at him, trying to reiterate how serious the situation was.

“Okay, okay. One second!!” James repeated.

“JAMES WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN THERE THIS ISNT A FUCKING JOKE!!”

He didn't reply, instead I heard footsteps move towards the door. 

\*CLICK\*  the door unlocked and opened.

My brother stared at me with wide eyes, breathing heavily. 

“S-SHES FUCKING DEAD!!!”  I Said.

“Okay, let's call the police.” he replied in a calm tone.

I punched him in the chest.  I noticed there was a speck of something red on his shirt. 

“James… what is on your shirt..?” I asked conceredly. 

He was about to speak when i interrupted him again after i saw there was cleaning supplies on the floor of his room. 

“And why are there cleaning supplies on your floor…?”

“Dude, its just ketchup. And i was just cleaning my room, thats why i said give me a second. You need to calm down.” 

“WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?!?!” I screamed at him at the top of my lungs.

“Nothing is wrong with me. Now what are you talking about? Where is she?”  he asked in a calm but slightly confused tone. The confusion almost seemed insincere. 

“S-she's downstairs!!” I exclaimed just before ushering him to follow me down.

He followed me down the stairs at a comfortable pace while I was running. 

*Why the hell is he acting so calm?*

I thought maybe he would begin freaking out as well when he saw the scene with his own 2 eyes. I watched his eyes carefully as he examined the scene. He did so calmly, then an annoyed expression appeared on his face. 

“Ah, shit shit shit!” he muttered under his breath in an annoyed tone rather than the panicked  tone I was expecting.

My eyes widened with pure rage. I began to slowly walk towards him.

“What… the… fuck… is… WRONG WITH YOU?!!!” I said just before charging at him. 

My charge knocked him to the ground and I pinned him down.

“FUCKING ANSWER ME!!! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!!!” I exclaimed in absolute rage just before punching his face. 

He began to struggle and fight back,  eventually he managed to pin me down. He began to pound my face with no mercy. Slowly everything faded into black, and then I was completely knocked out.

I awoke in my bed once more.. I gasped  and sat up. My entire face was throbbing with pain. I looked to the left where my window was, it was already dark. I had been knocked out for hours.

I stood up and looked in the mirror. My face had been beaten to an absolute pulp.  I went to my bedroom door and noticed it was closed. That was odd; I never leave my door closed. I  put my hand on the knob and attempted to twist it open. There was something locking the handle from outside. I began to pound on the door. 

“OPEN THE DOOR JAMES WHAT THE FUCK!” I screamed.

No response answered me. 

I heard footsteps come up the stairs, and then right to my door. I heard something move and then the door opened. My brother stood in front of me.

“Jesus what the hell happened to your face? And why was there a chair under your handle?”

I began to breathe heavily again. 

“YOU.. YOU FUCKING DID THIS WHAT DO YOU MEAN??!” 

“Hey dude calm the fuck down!” he replied while putting his hands up. 

“WHERE IS MOM?!” I questioned.

“She's on a business trip!”

My mom worked as a fast food restaurant cashier. What business trip  could she have been on? 

I shoved him out of the way and ran downstairs.  I had made it down stairs, but all of the evidence of a crime scene was completely gone.  “What the hell? No no no!*”*

I heard my brother start down the stairs.  

“What are you doing dude?” he asked as he reached the last step.  

“What the fuck did you do to her?! Where is her body?!” I  asked him, basically accusing him of cleaning up the earlier  crime scene. 

“Her body? Bro what the actual *fuck* are you talking about?” he asked in an insincere sounding confused tone.

*He's trying to gaslight me. I know what I saw was real. The damage  on my face proves it.*

But what could I do? He had clearly covered the evidence. I became sick at the idea of him being the murderer.  I decided it was best to play it calm. I decided I would begin investigating him.

“Okay.” I said just before starting up the stairs. I made it to my room and plopped down on my bed in complete defeat.

*Could my brother actually  be a murderer?*  He is top of his class,  regularly helps people in need, and was even a vegan because he thought eating animals was ethically wrong. That made it extremely hard for me to believe he was the murderer, but what other suspect did i have? All the signs pointed to him being the person who killed my sweet, loving and hardworking mother. 

After a few minutes of thinking, I noticed I still had not heard my brother come back upstairs.

*What is he doing down there?*

I decided I needed to check. I opened my door and began walking down the stairs once again. He wasn't there.  I turned to the left and noticed the basement door was wide open. 

*What is he doing there?*

I carefully and quietly went down the basement stairs. I Crouched down behind the couch  and peaked above it. I examined the room.  I noticed him walking toward the bookshelf. He looked as if he were about to touch it, but he then turned around to make sure no one was watching.  I quickly ducked behind the couch so my head was no longer visible. After 5 seconds, I peeked my head back up and saw him pull a piece of tape off the bookshelf that blended into the shelf perfectly.  The  tape covered a keyhole. My eyes widened with suspicion. I was now even more confident my brother was the killer. 

  He pulled out a set of keys from his pocket and put one of them on the shelf. The lock clicked, and he began to wheel the bookshelf to the side, revealing a door.   He opened the door and it revealed a set of stairs. He started down the stairs and that's when I stood up. I was in disbelief. What was he hiding down there? My stomach dropped as I answered myself. *My mother*.

I walked to the door and stopped right in front of it, watching my brother walk down the stairs. When he reached the bottom, he flicked a lightswitch. The stale, yellow light illuminated my mothers cold, dead body right next to her decapitated head. But that wasn't all, next to that there were multiple other dead bodies, all also having their heads decapitated.   I couldn't help but gasp. My brother instantly turned around and his eyes widened with panic.  He began to charge up the stairs.  I was in too much shock to run. Just as I was about to begin running, I was too late. He grabbed my foot and threw me down the stairs.  I tumbled down painfully and then hit the  cold, concrete floor of the room. 

I tried to get up, but I had already heard the door close and the bookshelf begin to move over it.  I looked around me and examined all of the dead bodies and severed heads. It was too much for my brain to handle. I broke down screaming, crying, and shaking. This was the most gruesome and horrifying situation I had ever been in. forced to be locked in a room with my own mothers lifeless body and many others. 

Hours had passed, and I had cried all the tears I could. I became completely numb. I layed there staring at the ceiling for hours. I didn't know what time it was anymore. I assumed it had to be sometime in the morning or at least close to it.  My  eyes widened when I heard the door open. I instantly stood up and stared at my brother who was standing at the top staring down at me. He held a plate of food. 

*My best bet of escaping this is to act calm.*  

I didn't say anything to him.  He began to walk down the stairs, when he reached the bottom he handed me the plate. It was a piece of white bread, nothing else.

“Thank you.” I said shakily. 

“You are welcome,” he said, just before turning around. 

Now was my chance. I took the plate and smashed it into his head, causing him to collapse momentarily. I ran over him and charged up the stairs. When I made it to the top I tried to run out of the basement, but I tripped and fell on an old box.  He grabbed my shoe and attempted to drag  me, but I struggled and got free. I managed to stand up, but he knocked my legs down causing me to fall to the floor once again.  He pinned me down and put my hands behind my back as if he were arresting me.

 I struggled as much as I could, but he was a lot bigger and stronger than me. He pulled a zip tie out of his pocket and tied my hands together with it.    I then managed to break partially free from his pin on me, and I rolled over so that I was facing the ceiling. I kicked his legs with extreme force, causing him to fall down. I managed to get up, I took my chance and began stomping on his face with severe force. After minutes of doing that, he knocked out. I  Ran out of the basement and onto the couch.  I was able to put my  hands  through my legs painfully, making my hands in front of me rather than behind my back. I managed to pull my phone out of my pocket and dialed 911 while struggling. I pressed the speaker and placed my phone on the counter.  

A female operator picked up. 

“911 what's your emergency?”

“I would like to report a murder.”

I explained what happened to the operator in a panicked tone while breathing heavily. 

The operator told me to leave the house and hide somewhere near it. I went out of my front door and out into the driveway. My mom's car was still there. The car that she planned to drive to work this earlier afternoon. The car that she would have brought dinner from her work home around this time. A tear shed but I continued towards the car. I opened the door, sat down and locked the doors. I stayed on the phone with the operator until the police came. I watched them enter my house, minutes after I watched them escort my brother to the car with handcuffs on. It was a very surreal experience.  It's now been 4 days since this incident. My brother has been arrested for 10 counts of first degree pre-mediated murder.  I am extremely traumatized by this experience and miss my mother so much. I will never forgive my brother for this.
