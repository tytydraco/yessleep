I’ve lived in this building for two years. It’s cheap, the neighbors are quiet, and I’m at the end of the third floor, in apartment 3F. That means fewer people passing by, which I like.

Last week, that changed.

It was Friday night—technically Saturday morning—when I first heard the knocking. I woke up at 3:12 a.m. to three soft knocks. Not on my door, but from the hallway. I figured someone was locked out, maybe drunk.

But it was weirdly rhythmic. Three knocks. A pause. Three more. It went on for maybe a minute. I got out of bed and checked the peephole.

No one.

I opened the door. The hallway was empty. Not a soul in sight.

I shrugged it off and went back to bed. But the next night, it happened again. 3:13 a.m. Three knocks. Pause. Three more. Still no one outside. It happened again Sunday. Then Monday. Every single night.

Same time. Same pattern.

On Tuesday, I stayed up and sat near the door with the lights off. I wanted to hear it clearly. When the knocking came—exactly at 3:12 a.m.—it was closer than before. Like it was right outside my door.

I jumped up and looked through the peephole. Still no one. I flung the door open fast, hoping to catch them.

Nothing.

I walked the entire hallway. Checked the stairwell. Even knocked on a few doors. Everyone else was asleep.

I installed a security camera right above my door the next day. It’s motion-activated and has night vision. I wanted proof. When I checked the footage the next morning, it triggered at 3:12 a.m. and recorded exactly 90 seconds.

The hallway was empty.

But I heard it. Three knocks. Then silence. Then three more.

On the video, the door shook slightly with each knock, like someone heavy was on the other side. But no one was there.

I showed the footage to my neighbor, Mrs. Levin in 3E. She’s in her 70s and has lived here since 1986. When I asked if she’d ever heard anything strange late at night, she didn’t answer right away. Then she said quietly, “You’re in 3F, aren’t you?”

I nodded.

She looked me in the eyes and said, “That apartment has had five tenants in the last ten years. None of them stayed long.”

“Why not?” I asked.

“They all said the same thing. Someone knocks, but there’s no one there.”

I pressed her for more. She finally told me about a man who used to live here in the late ’80s. Reclusive, paranoid. Used to tell people not to open the door after 3 a.m., no matter what. Said something was trying to “wear him down.”

One night, neighbors heard screaming. Police kicked in the door. The man was gone. Windows locked from the inside. No forced entry or exit.

But the hallway carpet? Covered in muddy, barefoot footprints. And one long drag mark, like someone had been pulled away.

That night, I barely slept. I kept the lights on and watched the door.

At 3:12 a.m., the knocks came again.

This time they didn’t stop.

They came faster. Louder. Like fists hammering the door. I recorded it on my phone. Thirty seconds in, I heard a voice.

Whispering.

It said my name.

I couldn’t breathe. I backed away. I swear the door bulged inward once, like something hit it with a shoulder.

Then silence.

The footage showed the door shaking—but still, no one there. Just darkness. I posted the video in a private paranormal forum. Most people called it fake. But one guy messaged me privately.

He said, “I used to live in 3F.”

I asked him to prove it. He sent a photo of a hand-drawn sigil carved into the floor beneath the radiator in the bedroom.

I checked.

It was there.

He told me the knocking will get worse. It always starts with three. Then voices. Then scratching. Then the door opens.

I asked, “What happens after it opens?”

He just replied: “You’ll be next.”

I’m writing this at 2:55 a.m.

I’ve moved the dresser in front of the door. I’m holding a knife. I don’t know what good it’ll do. But the knocking just started again. And this time…

It didn’t stop at three.

It just keeps going.
