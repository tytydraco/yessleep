It began on a Tuesday morning. Adam swiped his credit card at the coffee shop, as he had done every day for the past five years. But this time, the machine beeped with an error message: *Transaction declined.*

He thought it was a mistake, so he tried again. Same result. 

"Sorry, sir," the barista said, glancing at him with an awkward smile. "Your card’s not working."

"That’s impossible," Adam muttered, pulling out his debit card and trying it instead. But when he entered his pin, the machine froze before flashing the same error. *Transaction declined.*

He pulled out his phone, opened the bank app, and tried to check his balance. But the app wouldn't load. He closed it and reopened it. Nothing. The screen went blank.

Strange. He figured it was just a glitch and walked out, trying not to overthink it. But the next day, when he tried to log in to pay a bill, the same thing happened. No access to his accounts. The website couldn’t find him. He called his bank, but the automated voice didn’t recognize his account information.

"Sorry, the number you’ve dialed is no longer in service," the voice said.

It was only then that Adam started to feel something creeping at the edge of his mind, something deeply unsettling.

The following day, he went to his employer's office to finish some work. He swiped his ID card at the entrance, expecting the usual click. Instead, the door didn’t open. He tried again. Nothing. 

He stepped up to the security desk, feeling a knot form in his stomach. “I’m Adam Bishop. I’m on the schedule today.”

The guard raised an eyebrow. “What’s your employee ID number?” 

“6578921.” Adam replied. 
The security guard typed it in. "I’m sorry, but there's no one by that name on the list."

Adam felt a cold rush flood through his chest. Adam stammered, trying to explain, but the more he talked, the more the security guard's expression hardened, as if Adam wasn’t making any sense at all.

He left in a daze, and as he drove home, he tried calling his best friend, Luke. He’d known Luke for nearly twenty years—had shared apartments with him, birthdays, holidays. Luke would know who he was. But when the phone rang, it just went to voicemail. He called again. And again.

No answer.

That evening, Adam went over to Luke’s apartment. He knocked, waited a moment, and then knocked again. The door opened.

"Can I help you?" the man asked.

“Luke? It’s Adam,” he said, frustration creeping into his voice. “Luke, where have you been? We’ve known each other forever.”

The man looked at him blankly. “I’m sorry, you must be at the wrong house.”

Adam felt his world collapse in on itself. He tried to explain, but the man just shook his head, eyes darting to the side, clearly uncomfortable.

Adam left, feeling the weight of something suffocating his chest. Something was wrong. Something was so wrong, he could hardly breathe.

He went home, hoping things would return to normal. His wife, Sarah, was in the kitchen making dinner, humming softly to herself. Adam leaned against the doorway, watching her.

“Hey, Sarah,” he said softly. “How was your day?”

She didn’t respond right away. She continued chopping vegetables. He cleared his throat and said it again, louder this time. “Sarah? It’s me. Adam.”

She stopped, slowly turned, and blinked. Her expression was blank, like she didn’t recognize him at all. She tilted her head, still holding the knife in her hand.

“Who are you?” she asked. “Get out of my house! I’m gonna call the cops!” She screamed

Adam’s stomach churned, his vision narrowing. “What do you mean? It’s *me*, Adam. Your husband. We’ve been together for years.”

But Sarah just stared at him, her eyes empty, her face cold. “LEAVE! NOW!”

His heart pounded. He tried again, his voice shaking. “Sarah, please—this isn’t funny. I’m *Adam*.” He grabbed her arm, but she raised the knife at him. 

He stumbled back, disoriented. His mind raced, and everything around him felt like it was shifting, blurring. He ran to his kids’ room, but when he opened the door, his son and daughter were crying. 

“Go away!” The oldest boy screamed 
“Mommy!!!” His daughter yelled. 

Sarah ran in with the knife “GET OUT NOW!”


The world spun as Adam tried to process what was happening. He ran out of the house. He grabbed his phone again, shaking hands dialing his parents’ number. His mother answered, but when he said, “Mom, it’s me, Adam,” her voice cracked with confusion.

“Adam who? I’m sorry, but I don’t think I know you,” she said. There was no recognition in her tone, just an uncomfortable distance.

“But—Mom, it’s me, your son!” His throat was tight with panic, but she just kept repeating that she didn’t know him. His father, when he tried calling him, echoed the same thing: "You’re not my son."

Adam didn’t know how to breathe anymore. He was suffocating in the confusion, in the horror of it all. His family, his friends, everyone he knew—*no one recognized him.*

He wasn’t dead. He wasn’t alive. So, he drifted through the streets, past people who walked right through him, past places that no longer held his name. The man he had been—the person who had lived and laughed and loved—was gone, slowly slipping out of existence. And no one even noticed.
