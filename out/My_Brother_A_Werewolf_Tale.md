The house where I grew up was simple, made of wattle-and-daub with a clay-tile roof, surrounded by a yard with packed dirt ground. The walls were saturated with the smell of smoke from the wood-burning stove and dust, which the wind insisted on pushing inside the house. Every day, before the merciless sun of the Pernambuco sertão appeared on the horizon, my mother was already up preparing coffee.

I lived there with my parents and my older brother, who one day tried to live a simple life, tending his own land, raising animals, and dreaming of children running in the yard. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

Since childhood, my brother loved listening to tales about the cangaço (banditry). He would lean into the old men's circle of conversation and stay silent, just listening. When a cowboy commented on a cangaceiro (bandit) attack on a farm or town, his eyes would widen as if he were listening to fairy tales.

Once, I caught him scratching the name "Lampião" on a piece of old leather with a knife.
“You trying to die early, are you?” I asked, irritated.
“I want to live like a man. Not like an animal trapped on a small patch of land,” he replied, serious, without looking at me.
The truth is, my brother dreamed of the cangaço life.

A life with a gun in hand, facing the police patrol (volante). I thought it was a boyish thing. But it wasn't; it was a calling.
He seemed to forget all about it after he met Tânia Maria, on a trip he made to the town of Calumbi to sell the cheeses my father produced. It was love at first sight, he said. After a short time dating, they decided to set up house together. With the money he had saved his whole life, he bought a small farmhouse in the rural area of that town. He was happier than ever before.
But peace and happiness don't last when a Colonel decides that the land you're standing on is no longer yours.

His hired gunmen (jagunços) arrived at the end of the day, with weapons and the certainty of those who know that no one will demand justice.
When they left, they only left destruction, blood, and a pain that never left my brother's soul. They burned his house and what they did to his wife in front of him, I don't even want to remember. That night my brother lost everything. Even his soul.

My mother was already awake lighting the stove when we heard the dog bark and then immediately start wagging, celebrating, and sniffing under the door. I went out onto the porch and saw, through the darkness, my brother coming on foot, stumbling, his face covered in dust and blood.
His shirt was torn, stuck to his body by a mixture of sweat and wounds.
One of his arms seemed to be broken, and his gaze was that of someone who had seen hell up close. Behind him, only the silence of the caatinga.

I ran and held him before he could fall. My mother became frantic when she saw his condition, and my father appeared with a pale face. We took him inside and took care of his wounds. It was devastating; he just cried and called out for his wife.
My father didn't ask anything; he just helped clean the blood, while my mother tore up an old sheet to make bandages.

My brother spent months without looking anyone in the eye.
He no longer cried, and for a long time, he barely spoke either, just staring at the horizon thinking of revenge. My father tried to get that idea out of his head, saying he should leave it to God because we couldn't do anything against powerful people.
Slowly, my brother returned to the farm, helping us as before. But I saw in his eyes that he wasn't just planting beans, cassava, or corn. In reality, he was planting the day of his revenge. And that harvest, sooner or later, was going to come.

It was Lent (Quaresma), and the yard was restless; it was the second night in a row.
The hens were cackling non-stop in the coop. The dog was growling, its snout sniffing under the door. We had been losing animals for days: goats, pigs, chickens.
"That darned critter, it must be a cougar (suçuarana)," my brother said. "Just like the one that attacked the woman on the other side of the ridge."

We didn't think twice. We grabbed our shotguns, put on our sandals (alpercatas), and set off down the dirt trail, entering the dry scrub of the caatinga. "Be careful out there," my mother said. We walked for about twenty minutes, and out of nowhere, they emerged like a snake from the bush.
Four men, armed with long knives (peixeiras) and rifles. Cangaceiros. Before we could even think of reacting, we already had knife blades at our throats. But they didn't say anything, no threat. They just signaled for silence. “Shhh!”
They were all crouched down, like cornered animals, as if hiding from the police patrol. One of them whispered, his voice almost gone: "Quiet! There's something bad lurking in the woods, and it ain't the cops (macaco)."
The leaves rustled, and the wind changed direction. One of them pointed towards the bushes ahead, and I looked in the indicated direction.

From the middle of the dry vegetation, two yellow eyes lit up. Almost at a man's waist height. "It sensed us." One of the cangaceiros said, whispering.
The dry branches of the caatinga cracked. The cangaceiros prepared their rifles; I felt a cold sweat run down my back. That's when a grotesque growl tore through the darkness. And before any of us could react, the brush exploded with movement.
The cangaceiro who was closest to us was the first to fall. The creature sank its teeth into his neck, tearing it down to the spine. Blood flew far. Then another, with a single swipe, had his chest ripped open.
My brother and I were speechless in the face of that monstrosity; we had never seen anything like it in our lives.

The thing was big, hairy, with long arms. It looked like a person, but it had a horrible animal head. It growled deep, with slobber dripping from its teeth. When it turned towards me, I knew it was my end.
That's when the shots started.
Dry shots cut through the darkness. Twenty, thirty. The woods filled with flashes of light. The creature screamed, staggered, but didn't fall easily. It still crawled, trying to get up. It seemed unwilling to die.
Only after long minutes did its body stop trembling.

The dust settled, and the cangaceiros approached, surrounding the dead beast with their guns pointed. The Captain came last, unhurriedly. A man of dry presence, with iron eyes. He looked at the beast for a while and said:
"Collect the weapons of those who fell. And bury them with respect."
My brother and I were on our knees. The man who was watching us lowered his rifle as soon as the Captain looked at him:
"You can let them go."
I stood up. But my brother remained kneeling.
"Captain, if you please..." he said, looking firmly, "I want to join the band."
The Captain was silent, then asked:
"Do you know what you are asking?"
"Yes, sir, I do." My brother answered.
"And why should I accept you into my band, man (cabra)?"

My brother told his story, but it was only when the Captain heard the Colonel's name that he decided to accept my brother. The Colonel was an adversary of the Captain, a former supporter (coiteiro) who had become an enemy.
"You're accepted, man." The Captain said.
My brother stood up with the firmness of someone who was already one of them.
He didn't look at me. Nor did he look back.
I returned home alone. That night, I told my parents what happened.
It was the last time I saw my brother alive. In the morning, my father and I went to the place where we found the cangaceiros and the beast. There was nothing, just the marks of the shots and a lot of dried blood. I can't say what happened to it, I only know that the Captain's men didn't bury it. My mother said it was a werewolf (lobisomem) and that they don't die from common bullets. Only if they are made of silver.

As for my brother, he got his revenge some time later. Even with all the security of his farm, the Colonel succumbed. My brother, along with some men from the band, invaded the main house. The Colonel was caught hiding in the house’s rafters. My brother didn't do anything to the scoundrel's wife; he and his hired gunmen were the ones who owed a debt. Everyone paid.

Years later, while selling cheese at the market in the town of Flores, reading the Diário de Pernambuco newspaper, I saw the report that said:
"Lampião and eleven other cangaceiros were killed by the Alagoas police." They caught him in Angico. The patrol cut off everyone's head.
Among the names of the dead was my brother's.
