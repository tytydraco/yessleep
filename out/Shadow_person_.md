Last night, I had an experience I can’t fully explain, and for someone like me—who doesn’t believe in paranormal things—that’s saying something. I’m a rational person, and for me, everything has a logical explanation.

It was around 2:30 AM, dead of night, when I woke up with this strange, eerie feeling that I was being watched. As I blinked myself awake, I saw a shadowy figure sitting at the edge of my bed. The room was pitch black, but I could clearly make out this dark silhouette. What made it even weirder was that my cat, who never sleeps in the bedroom—let alone on the bed—was lying down by my feet. That alone felt off.

The figure was sitting at the edge of the bed ,near the cat, and what freaked me out was that it looked like it was petting my cat. My cat wasn’t acting freaked out either, it was just staring at this shadow. At first, I thought maybe it was my boyfriend, who had woken up and was petting the cat. But when I looked beside me, he was fast asleep. My next thought was that maybe it was an intruder, but the more I stared at the figure, the more unsettling it became.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the haze, assuming I was dreaming or half-asleep. But the figure didn’t vanish. I grabbed my glasses, hoping it would bring some clarity, but it was still there. Almost looked like it was pulsing. I just kept trying to focus my vision hard, hoping it would disappear, and it's just in my head.

While I'm still in disbelief , I pulled away from this figure, sitting down on the bed, rubbing my eyes repeatedly, the being pulled the hood of what looked like a jacket over its head.

Then it stood up—slowly—and it started growing taller, looming by the door. I was frozen, just staring at it, my mind racing to find some rational explanation. But this thing was towering over me, becoming something more than just a shadow. 

That’s when I fully woke up, wide awake and panicked. I shook my boyfriend, scared, shouting, “There’s something here! Something is watching us!” He woke up in a daze and said there was nothing there. I asked him if he really didn’t see it, and he just kept saying, “There’s nothing there, what are you seeing??"

Meanwhile, my cat, who never does this, squeezed in between us, trying to get as close as possible, almost like it was frightened too.. seeking our cuddles and attention, or maybe trying to calm me down?

The shadowy figure didn’t leave. It just stood there, taunting me, almost like it was dancing or messing with me. I was still frozen, thinking, Am I losing it? What was happening didn’t feel possible.

My boyfriend told me to turn on the light. I did, and the second the light filled the room, the figure vanished. But my cat was still staring, its eyes locked onto the same spot where the figure had been, and following it around in the room, like he was tracking something invisible.

I don’t know what to think of it. I’ve never believed in ghosts, or shadow people, or anything like that. I’ve always dismissed those kinds of stories. But this… I can’t shake it. It felt too real. It WAS real. I feel like I saw something I wasn’t supposed to.

I don’t know what it was. I’ve never believed in this stuff, and now I feel completely insane. Any idea what it could’ve been?
