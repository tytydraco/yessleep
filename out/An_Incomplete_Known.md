“More like Timothy Chala-GAY” he uttered as he punched me directly in the gut once more.


His name was Holland Oates, and he was the biggest asshole in school.  Holland gave me constant shit just because of something I really liked.  The thing I really liked was Timothy Chalamet.


I’d seen all of his movies.  I had all the merchandise.  Posters, copies of Dune that featured his picture on the front…hell even a body pillow or two.  You could call me a Chalamaniac.  But I just called me…well…me.


But perhaps Holland was actually doing me a favor by beating the living fuck out of me while saying homophobic bullshit.  Perhaps he knew something that I didn’t.  Because my Chalamet fandom took me to places…dark places…places that I honestly wish I’d never known.  And if I could go back in time, I wish I would’ve just let Holland’s bullying dissuade me from by Chalobsession.

Christmas Day, 2025.  I had insane FOMO because my parents went to go see the new Bob Dylan bio-pic without me.  I didn’t really give much of a fuck about Bob Dylan, but as it has been established, I absolutely stan Timothy Chalamet.  Honestly, it hurt my feelings a little bit that they didn’t invite me to go see it.  But I also knew what it was like to accompany them on ‘date night’, and honestly I wasn’t really in the mood to see my dad take one to many pulls off his flask and try to make out with my mom to “Queen Jane Approximately.”


Unlike my parents, however, I knew a way to scratch my Chalamitch without spending a dime.  It was called “putting on the eyepatch.”  So I started surfing around Pirate Bay looking for cam rip of “A Complete Unknown.”  I knew it would be a long shot, given that it was literally opening day, but Chalabeggars can’t be Chaloosers.  Ugh.  Chalooser is another thing Holland called me once while he beat the ever-living fuck out of me.  


Anyways, I thought I had struck it gold after an hour of fruitless searching, when I finally found a torrent that seemed to be exactly what I was looking for.  An Incomplete Known.mp4.  I knew that pirates had a tendency to get cheeky with file names, so I figured that’s what was going on.  Some people may have thought it was a red flag that this file had exactly 0 leechers and 1 seeder, but, again, it was a brand new movie and it was Christmas…I figured most people were probably spending time with their families.


Even though the file was 3.2 GB it downloaded fast…like weirdly fast.  My dad was kind of a dick and sprung for the cheapest cable internet possible, so I was used to it at least taking an hour or so to download a movie…and especially one with just a single seeder?  But hey, I was bored out of my Chalamind so I didn’t question it.  

Once the MP4 downloaded, I loaded it up into VLC and that’s when things started to get a little Chaluncanny.  First, the cam rip started way earlier than I would have expected.  As in, the person filming started filming before they’d even left their apartment.  And the apartment was absolutely disgusting.  


It was an absolute hovel, with just rotten garbage and shit and pizza boxes everywhere.  It was a single room studio type apartment, looked to be about 300 square feet or so, and just looked absolutely disgusting.  You never were able to see what the person filming looked like (like in the face), but could hear their heavy, labored breathing throughout the entire first segment.  At one point, they brought the camera into the bathroom, set it on the sink, and it sounded like they started taking just the nastiest shit I’ve ever heard.  And they were coughing up a lung and gagging the entire time.  


But the weirdest part of this scene was the bath tub.  It was covered in red stains all around the drain, tub and back wall.  Was it rust?  I really fucking chalahoped so.  I don’t think I could reckon with the alternative.


Finally, the camera man leaves his disgusting flat.  On his way out, you can hear a high pitched whining as he passes by the coat closet by the door.  It almost sounded like a person…crying or moaning or something?  At this point, he just stops and films the closet door.  The only audio that can be heard is the high whine and the labored breathing.  It gave me the fucking chalawillies.


After a couple minutes of that disturbing shit, he heads out the door.  It’s early afternoon when he leaves, and the film cuts.  When it comes back, the camera man is at the movie theater.   But not just any movie theater.  I could recognize from the outside that this guy was at the movie theater that we always attend.  The very same movie theater my parents were at this evening.  


I started to Chalapanic a little bit, but was quickly able to talk myself down.  “Lots of theaters look the same” I whispered to myself.  But my relief was short lived once I heard this hulking creep make his way to his seat, and noticed a very familiar silhouette of the couple seated in front of him.  It was my parents.


Both of my parents have a very distinctive hair style.  My mom wears her hair long…like weirdly long.  It’s a little bit hippie, but I reckon her hair is about 4 feet long.  She’s About 5’9’’ and her hair goes all the way to her ass.  My dad is horse-shoe bald but has the most insane curly hair I’ve ever seen.  I’d recognize the backs of both of their heads anywhere.  This was getting a little Chalafucked up.


The worst part about all of this was that the camera man wasn’t even focused on the movie.  I swear to god, the camera was just weirdly focused on the backs of my parents heads.  But what was really fucking weird was the timing of all of this made no sense.  Where the movie should have been in real-time was syncing up perfectly to the time I was watching the video.  In other words, this shot lined up with the actual film as if I were watching some kind of live feed.  


But this was an mp4.  How the Chalafuck could that be?  I started to get stressed out and worried, so I called my dad.  Immediately went straight to voicemail.  Of course, he would be the dick who actually turns his phone off when Nicole Kidman told him to in that stupid pre-movie bullshit.  


So I tried mom next.  I heard a ring…ok…that’s a good start.  And I could actually hear her phone vibrating on the MP4 as well…What the Chalashit???  On screen, I saw her jump, and put her phone on silent and put it back in her purse.  UGH!  Her phone continued to ring and went to voicemail.  I left her a panicked message warning her about the man behind her, but clearly they weren’t going to hear this until after the movie.  I just hope that wasn’t going to be too Chalalate.


I don’t know if I should be relieved or not, but our fucked up videographer decided to leave the movie early and apparently leave my parents alone.  But I don’t know how much better I should feel about that.  The streets he started walking looked oddly familiar to me, and I finally pieced together where he was going to.  It was my house.


I’m writing this hiding in the closet now.  I don’t know what the next move is.  All I know is that I’m at the point in the mp4 where he’s filming my front door.  He hasn’t tried to open it yet.  I just see a standard shot of the front door and that breathing.  That insane, hideous, labored breathing.  I fear that I am completely Chalafucked.
