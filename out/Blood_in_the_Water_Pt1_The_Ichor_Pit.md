On the first day, there were likely only a few drops of blood, not even enough to be noticed by any of the tourists or fishers that frequented our placid lake. Following that, a thin trickle that would've dispersed before it had the opportunity to climb to the surface. Day by day, more and more of the crimson liquid was released, tainting the otherwise crystaline waters; or at least that is what everyone in town believed. It otherwise seemed unfeasible for the clear water of such a large pool to become so murky and wretched over the course of a single night.



Ever since the spring closed up, business had been miserably slow, so I didn't learn about the milky red water until today. On Saturday mornings, I normally dusted all the rarely used equipment and sanitized the regulators and facemasks that had been used or would be needed for the weekend. No one had booked any dive lessons or tours in the past week and a half, and my phone hadn't even thought about ringing with potential clients, so I was slacking on my duties this morning.



 I had barely made a dent in the coffee swirling in my novelty Alexandria Springs mug when there was a polite but forceful knock on the front door. Had I forgotten to unlock it when I came in? I allowed myself one final drink of the coffee before hustling across the small shack towards the door. 



"Jay? You in there?" A familiar, gruff voice belonging to the shadow darkening my door called through the closed entryway. It was Michael, a park ranger at the Springs who I drank with occasionally.

​



"Mike, Hey. Everything all right?" It was extremely uncommon for any of the rangers to show up at my humble little shop - usually only coming by if they needed someone to retrieve a precious item or animal body out of the lake.

​



"Heard what happened?" I simply shook my head when he asked, quirking my brow inquisitively. "Whole lakes gone red. Saw a bit yesterday, but thought some fish may have got at it. This morning though..."

​



"And you were hoping I'd dive and figure out what is going on?" I finished his thought before taking a long sip from my coffee. Had it been anyone other than Mike asking for this favor, I wouldn't have believed them, but Mike was a straight shooter. He was a grumpy old Afghanistan vet who didn't like to waste his time on pranks or games; it was the whole reason he had picked up a job as a ranger in the first place. Poor guy just wanted to take it easy in retirement, but now he deals with petty camper problems almost daily.

​



After a moment longer of deliberation, I sighed and nodded. Mike looked exceptionally relieved when I told him I'd get down there in the next twenty minutes or so, and we separated. He hopped into his pickup to head back to the park, and I retreated into my office to collect the gear I would need. Since the water was likely contaminated with an animal body, I would need my dry suit and full face dive mask; two items I generally disliked diving in.

​



As promised, I was pulling through the front gate of the park in just under fifteen minutes, equipped with all of the tools I thought I would reasonably need and two one hour tanks. Sandra was at the booth and waved me through as soon as she saw my Van. On the opposite side of the little wooden shack was a line of loaded SUVs, minivans, and pickup trucks trying to leave. Had the rangers emptied the park, or were the campers just fleeing of their own volition?

​



The answer to my question awaited me at the beach, as a gaggle of less fearful visitors swarmed around the ranger vehicles. The youngest ranger, Dave, stood atop one of the trucks trying to command the herd of people with a megaphone, barely keeping them out of the water. The rangers seemed to be having no luck with clearing a space for me to pull up to, at least until Mike started shouting. The commanding presence he carried required no amplification to get everyone's attention, and shortly after he began to cry out, a large space beside the retention wall was cleared away.

​



That was the first time I got to see the water.

​



This pool was about three hundred feet wide, four hundred feet long, and stretched nearly forty-five feet down at the deepest point. Roughly a year ago, the natural spring in the deepest part of the lake suddenly seemed to seal off - we expected the water levels to recede and the flow of the river to slow heavily, however, neither of those things happened. The river flowed the same as it always had, the pool remained crystal clear, and the water temperature never rose past seventy-three degrees. The only reason this was ever even noticed was because I had been diving to take new photos of the vent for the campground's informational billboards. When I had descended fully into the depths, the crevice was simply missing, covered with sand as though it had never been there in the first place.

​



Rusty was the best term I had to describe the color of the water. It was also cloudy, as though something had kicked up the sand and silt that covered the floor, yet this time it simply wasn't settling. The sun was just breaching the tops of the mangrove trees that bordered the cove, its orange rays painting sections of the water a  much brighter shade of crimson. Sunrise on the beach was usually peaceful, but today, everyone only felt unnerved. From where I stood atop the stone wall, I couldn't see any of the usual signs of life that typically decorated the spring. The reeds where the alligators made their nest were still; there were no ripples in the water from the tiny fish that darted around, and all of the birds were festooned amongst the trees instead of trying to catch breakfast.

​



The crowd of spectating campers pressed forward like a crushing flesh wall, murming questions and statements at me or towards each other. Even the shouted words didn't quite reach my ears, arriving only as shattered fragments of speech. I chose to ignore them, instead focusing on slipping into my diving gear. Dave and Chris put themselves between the crowd and my van, giving Mike the opportunity to approach and speak privately.

​



"Can't thank you enough for this. I tried to get on the horn with the park services, but the calls weren't going through, radio shit the bed too." It was a sobering statement to realize that we were essentially cut off from the rest of the world. The prospect of diving into an unknown substance suddenly seemed much more terrifying, and it made the lake that I grew up playing in seem far more alien and hostile.

​



"Yeah, don't mention it. Not like there's anyone else who could do it." I was the only person with the experience to take this dive in at least a hundred miles. During the summers, my brother and his son would typically come help out at the shop, but this year they had gone off to dive in the Maldives. While I did enjoy their company, I didn't mind their absence since there wasn't much money to split this year. Now, though, as I am being forced to venture into the crimson abyss, I desperately wish one of them were here.

​



Mike offered a soft smile and a gentle, reassuring pat on the shoulder, which did absolutely nothing to warm the growing Ice in my stomach. Without anything else to say to stall, I slipped the mask over my head and started down the steps into the water of the lake. There didn't seem to be any difference in the water as I ambled into it, but then again, I couldn't feel much through the neoprene material.

​



I hand-carried my fins for the first fifty feet or so, as the gradual decline didn't deepen quickly enough for me to swim. Through the suit, at this distance, I couldn't hear the beach anymore. Isolated. There wasn't a time that I could remember where I had felt so alone.

​



Hesitantly, I lowered into the water in a vaguely seated position, tugging and pulling at my fins until they slipped over my boots. I really should've sealed off my mask first; it would've made the whole maneuver much easier, but I managed to equip the last piece of gear without dipping below the water. Quickly, I ran through my checks, ensuring all of my buckles and straps were fastened tightly and that my gear was secured. I wasn't bringing much down with me - just an underwater camera which was attached by cord to my wrist, and a dive knife tucked neatly into a holster on my calf. Finally, I pulled the mask down over my face, tightened the straps to make sure it was sealed, and checked my breathing. The pressure gauge was nominal, and I didn't feel like I was struggling to breathe.

​



I wanted to feel excited about this dive; it should have been thrilling. This was probably my one and only chance to experience something that no other human ever had, but I couldn't get the fear out of my mind. With a final thumbs up towards the rangers on the beach, I plunged face-first into the unknown.

​



The murky water above was a warning about what awaited below the surface, with extremely poor visibility. I couldn't see more than an arm's length ahead of me, which meant that my journey would be agonizingly slow and would feel suffocating. I focused on pulling myself along the bottom of the water, kicking gently and trying not to disturb the sand any further. Beneath me, littering the pure white sand were copious fish corpses, all sharing the same pallid green color. Nothing seems to have escaped the cold clutches of death as minnows shared their Graves with bluegills, trout, and the occasional gar. Would I be joining them? One misstep is all that it would take for this place to become my watery resting place; that thought alone was enough to make me question whether I had properly secured my gear or not.

​



I drew up the camera, got as close as I dared to the fish, and snapped two photos, one with the flash on and one without. With the poor quality of the water, I wasn't exactly hopeful that either picture would clearly show its subject. Aside from bringing one back, there wasn't anything else I could do but continue swimming forward.

​



The murk seemed to lessen as I reached the lip of the spring's sunken cove, but the reddened color of the water darkened. Now it wasn't the color of rust, it was a darker and richer maroon. I paused over the now inactive boil and just peered into the depths. The light from the sun wasn't in the right position to fully illuminate the gulch, leaving the source of the color a mystery. Even though I had been to the bottom of this gorge over a hundred times and knew it like the back of my hand, it felt otherworldly and wrong. Occluded by shadow and thick snaking strands of maroon smoke, there appeared to be something at the precipice of its depth. I flicked on the dull light on my mask and began to crawl down the edge of the rock, using it as an anchor and a guideline.

​



The yellow beam of my light helped carve my way into this darkness, but not enough. I wasn't sure how much light would have been enough to calm my nerves. The rocks were slick as though they were coated in algae, even in places where there was none. My light finally illuminated the figure at the bottom of the water, its scales glinting dully as the headlamps' beam washed over them. The alligator didn't react as my searching beam connected with its form. Similarly, I froze.

​



Everything I had been taught by my old man was to give Alligators space, especially if you found yourself in the water with one. Gators could hold their breath for hours, much longer than both of my air tanks combined.

​



Maybe it was dead? Everything else in the water seemed to be; what if this was the cause of the discoloration? If that were the case, I could wait days, and it wouldn't move. Against my better judgment, I needed to try and get closer. If I could just descend a few more feet, maybe I'd be able to catch a shot of the creature on the camera. Then I would have a much better idea of whether it was alive or not.

​



Each inch that I pulled myself closer added five more thumps to my heart rate, until it trembled like the rattle of gunfire. I didn't dare to get any closer than fifteen feet, hopeful that it would be close enough to get a clear photo. The reptile still hadn't moved, still seemingly slumbering peacefully in the sandy depths. On its forehead, just between the eyes, it seemed to have a gash wound, but it must have been old, as I didn't see any fresh blood weeping through. While the statue-esque figure wasn't leaking any red, I did find what I believed to be the source of the corruption.

​



Directly in front of the snout of the alligator was a slashed open slit in the sand, the length of my arm, with fleshy protrusions clinging to the edges of the site. This was where the color was darkest. Flowing freely from the gouge in the Spring's bottom was a deep brownish-red liquid. The way the vapors wisped through the water led me to believe that it wasn't just some colored water. In fact, I was uncomfortably familiar with the way that this ichor floated. It mirrored blood leaking from a cut, dancing and curling through the water, nudged along by the currents.

​



I struggled to pull the camera up to my face, vaguely peeping through the viewfinder to ensure that my subject was in frame. One click, one flash, one startled beast. The old wound on his head splintered open to reveal a third eye, which instantly snapped onto me. Before I had a moment to even consider reacting, the ambush predator launched straight up, blistering past me towards the top of the water before falling still again. Its body lulled to the side, fully capsizing so that the newest eye could keep watch over me from high above. I was now at an impasse. I was reluctant to descend to the bleeding spring, and I certainly did not want to swim up and risk another encounter with the unusual alligator. After a moment of further thought, I found it in my best interest to descend anyway. Despite how disconcerting the experience, I was sent to investigate the source of the crimson pool.

​



Swiping through the water, the cold blood curdled through my fingers, staining all of the parts of the dive suit it touched. My knees hit the sand next to the peeled fleshy segment and I brought the camera up again, making sure to catch a few shots of the source of liquid. Then, I stowed the device and equipped my dive knife. The last thing I wanted to do was poke and prod at the anomaly with my hands. An extension of myself, the dive knife prodded into the wavering strands of seaweed like flesh, effortlessly tearing through. Next, I stabbed at the center of the wound, praying that the flesh wouldn't try to grab my hand like some kind of demented Venus flytrap. My knife scraped and gouged against the soft stony substance, and I continued to scrape and pull until a small wedge of rock came away. I collected the rock, sliced a piece of flesh, and began to slowly ascend.

​



The silhouette of the malformed alligator still hovered threateningly above me, but as I ascended, it began to descend. As I clung to one side of the gorge, it similarly crawled down the opposite rock wall. We passed by each other with little more than raucous anxiety. Clutching my trophies, I darted back towards the shore, collecting two of the deceased fish on the way.

​



It was a far faster journey back to the edge of the waters as I only needed to pause to pull my fins off my feet. Striding up the stone stairs to the top of the retaining wall, I was met with expectant campers and towel-carrying rangers. The latter group helped ensure the seams around my mask were dry and free from the strange liquid before I pulled it off.

​



"Dave! Take his camera and go get those pictures printed off." Mike commanded, causing Dave to take the camera in a towel and rush towards the ranger station just up the hill. "What did ya see?"

​



"What's going on with the water? Are we going to get refunds if we can't use the amenities?" Before I had the opportunity to respond to Mike, a middle-aged woman with a blonde bob stepped forward and demanded. Clinging to her side was a pudgy child muttering something about wanting to swim, wearing a pair of inflated cartoon floaties and thin goggles.

​



"Ma'am, please join the other campers on the other side of the vehicles." There was a frustrated edge to Mike's voice, clearly present beneath the customer service voice he tried to put on. "We don't know what's going on right now. If you would like a refund for your unused days, please speak with Cindy at the station just up the hill."

​



"My unused days?! No, this has soured my whole vacation, and I want all of my money back! Don't make me call the forest services!" She berated my friend, complete with a pointed finger wiggling and wagging towards his gray-bearded face. I stood by awkwardly, holding onto my wretched prizes from the heart of the lake, not wanting to do anything to excite the situation any further. But I wouldn't have to.

​



As the mother cried rage to Mike, her child darted from behind her leg, aiming to leap off the retaining wall into the shallow water. Mike and I both reacted, far faster than the child's own mother. Mike reached him first, catching the child just as his feet had left the wall's lip. However, as Mike shoved the child back into the mottled sands, he went teetering over the edge. I tried to catch him, but fell short, our fingers narrowly missing each other. I turned to yell at the woman to get back, but she was already gone, dragging the ten-year-old into the crowd of now horrified onlookers.

​



Mike was flat on his back in the water, coughing and sputtering and choking out whatever liquid had gotten into his mouth. It was only a four-foot drop into two feet of water, but that was still enough for him to hit the bottom and be temporarily submerged. There was terror in his eyes as he realized exactly what had happened; it was a look I hadn't seen on anyone's face before.

  


In a panic, he pulled himself up to a sit and then scrambled to climb up the rough stone wall, reaching out for assistance. I caught his hand and dragged him up the edge of the wall, both of us disregarding the stairs just a few feet to his left.

  
Once he finally clambered over the top of the wall, the look of fear in his eyes melted and gave way to dread. He opened his mouth to ask for help and collapsed, face down in the sand, the pleading look frozen in place.
