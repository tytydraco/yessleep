  
I rang the bell twice and waited for somebody to answer the door. I was standing in the front porch of the Parsons’ family home.   
They were relatively new to the neighbourhood and had moved in to the locality only 2 months back.   
They looked friendly enough during my brief interactions with them and came across as generally nice people.   
You know - the typical suburban American family!  
 So I was not surprised when Mrs Parsons reached out to me and enquired if I would be willing to babysit their son for an evening.   
They were offering $100 for it. That is good money for a 15 year old in my neck of the woods. So it didn’t take me long to say yes.   
Although, I did hear from somewhere that the boy was a bit of a problem child. And I had never babysat any male kid before.   
‘Come on. He’s just a little kid. How hard could it be?’ I thought to myself.   
Well, I was going to find out soon anyway.  
The door opened and I was greeted by Mr and Mrs Parsons. They invited me into their home and introduced me to their 8 year son Jimmy.   
“Hi Jimmy. I am Kathy. Nice to meet you”, I said as I shook his hand. He smiled sheepishly at me and then went back and sat on his sofa. He started playing a game on his video game console.   
Mrs Parsons then told me that she and her husband would be attending a concert in the evening. She promised that they would be back by 10 pm and her husband would drop me home when they got back.  
 She had already cooked food for Jimmy and asked me to reheat it in the microwave before giving it to him. She also gave me an allowance and asked me to order what I ever I wanted from the local restaurant.   
Before leaving, Mr Parsons turned back to look at his son and said, “Listen Jimmy, you’re going to behave yourself ok”.  
“When we get back we expect Kathy to only say nice things about you. You got it?” he asked.  
 Jimmy nodded and went back to his game as the Pasrons bid goodbye, and left for the concert.   
Things were quiet for the next 20 minutes. Jimmy continued to play his game while I ruffled through a magazine, and was simultaneously chatting with friends on my phone.   
I kept occasionally glancing at Jimmy to keep an eye on him. He was well behaved thus far and kept to himself.  A few more minutes went by.   
Then I heard a small thud.   
Jimmy just casually threw his console away on the floor. He then placed his legs on the table in front of him, and sat back in his sofa with his hands resting behind his head, and fingers interlocked.   
He was looking at me.   
“I’am bored” he said.   
I smiled at him and closed my magazine.   
“Would you like to watch some TV? Is there any cartoon or anime that is your favourite?” I asked.   
He just kept staring at me while twirling his toes.   
“Dance for me”, he said.  
“Excuse me?” I replied totally taken aback.   
“Dance. Sing. Do whatever you want.”   
“Mom and Dad are paying you to be here right. So go ahead. Entertain  me. “ he said.  
‘You arrogant little twerp. Who do you think you are?’ I thought to myself.  
But I couldn’t speak to him like that. He’s still just a kid.   
“Jimmy didn’t your parents teach you to be respectful of elders? I don’t appreciate the way you have been talking to me. “ I said.  
I then continued “ Now if you are bored, I can switch on the TV or read a story from a favorurite book of your choice. “  
“Borrrringgg..!!” he said immediately looking away.  
“What would you like to do? Are you hungry? Shall I heat and give you the food your mom prepared for you?”, I asked.  
He turned to look at me and asked “Do you have a boyfriend?”  
“No.”, I replied back before I could even help myself.   
He smirked. “Ha. I thought as much”, he said.  
For the first time my face was flush with anger and I was trying hard to compose myself. I was letting this kid get to me.  
Jimmy then got up from his chair and said, “On second thoughts. I am hungry. Lets order Pizza”  
He took the cordless phone and began to dial. I got up, walked towards him and removed the phone from his hand.   
“Your mother gave strict instructions not to order out. You will have to eat what she made for you. “ I said.   
“No I wont and you cant force me!” he retorted. He looked ready to throw a fit.   
I took out my phone and told him, “ I am going to call your dad now. Your parents are not going to be happy to hear what I have to say.”   
The stern warning was working. Jimmy realized the consequences of what would follow and finally said “ I am sorry. I shouldn’t have done that.”  
“It’s alright Jimmy”    
“Would you like to eat? Are you hungry?” I asked him.   
The little boy thought for a moment and then asked, “ Is it ok if I can hug you?”  
“Pleaseee..” he said smiling sweetly with folded hands.  
I smiled and nodded. The boy came forward and gave me a warm hug.   
And then I suddenly felt a searing pain in my body. Jimmy bit me in the arm and then quickly moved back.   
As I stood there rubbing my arm in shock, he came towards me again and this time grabbed my phone. He then ran towards the window and threw it out.   
“Jimmy!!” I yelled in anger.   
I opened the front door and peered outside. The phone landed in the garden, which was populated with all kinds of plants and shrubs. The place was also poorly lit.   
I turned back to look at him angrily. “You better stay put in your place. Or else you will be really sorry” I warned him. He took the hint and sat back on his chair.   
I then went out to search for my phone. I was crouched on all fours, combing the place with my hands in all that darkness, hoping I would somehow find it.   
A few minutes passed by and then I heard the door slam shut.   
I started panicking and rushed back towards the door.   
As I got closer to the entrance, I heard a loud voice. It was not Jimmy’s. It sounded like a much older man. He was inside the house with Jimmy and was yelling at the top of his voice.  
“Where is the money boy? Where has your father kept it?”, he roared  
“Shut up. Stop crying. I am going to smack if you don’t stop now”, the man warned.  
I could hear Jimmy crying and I began to panic. I started banging on the door. I was really worried about the boy’s safety.   
“Please I don’t know any about that”, I heard Jimmy reply back.   
Then I heard something crash to the floor accompanied by the sounds of running footsteps from inside house.   
 Jimmy was shouting “Help. Somebody please help me!!!”  
 “Please no…. Leave me ….please….Aaaaaaghhh”  
Jimmy was screaming at the top of his voice. Now even I started yelling from the outside while continuing to bang on the door.   
“Jimmy. Jimmy …”. I cried.  
Things suddenly went quiet. But it was only for a fleeting moment.   
And then I heard another crash at the back of the house.   
I ran back to see what happened. The back door was left open. I slowly tiptoed towards the door and peered inside.  
 I couldn’t find anybody. I then rushed indoors towards the living room.   
And I saw Jimmy lying on the floor face down ….in a pool of his own blood!  
I ran towards the boy in absolute panic and turned him over.   
I could not even figure out if he was dead or unconscious. I couldn’t even check his pulse because my hands were trembling.   
I got up to get to the phone. I dialled the number to call an ambulance.   
And then I heard that voice again….. This time, from behind me. .  
“I am going to kill you”, he roared.  
 I turned back in absolute horror thinking this was going to be the end of me.   
And I realized I was looking at a giant TV screen with a picture of an angry man on it.  
Then the picture came to life. The man on the screen started yelling again.   
Pause.   
He froze.   
Play.   
“I am coming for you”, he said.   
Pause.   
He froze again.   
With the phone still held to my ear, I slowly turned around to look where I found Jimmy lying on the floor.   
He was sitting upright on his knees with a TV remote in his hand, and an evil grin on his face.    
The obnoxious brat had been playing me all along.  
Everything was fake. The attack, the cries for help,  the blood on his T-shirt… It was all fake!  
“Why would you do this to me?” I asked him unable to hide my helplessness.   
“Well… I saw the film Home Alone with my parents last month. I’ve been simply wanting to try this since then” he answered back.   
I was fighting back tears that were welling up inside me.   
But I didn’t want to give this kid the satisfaction of seeing me break down. The last thing I needed right now was him to start calling me a cry-baby. Deep down,  I really really wanted to spank that brat.  
Then I heard a knock on the door.  
“Mr Parsons, is everything ok?”, I heard a voice from the outside.   
“This is Dominique, your neighbhor. We heard screams from your home” he said.   
“Is everything alright?” he asked as he continued to knock on the door.  
I finally felt a tinge of relief. I have known Uncle Dominique since I was a kid and he was a kind man.   
I walked towards the door and opened it.   
He was standing with 3 other people. All were looking concerned.   
“Kathy? What are you doing here? What is going on?” he asked.   
Before I could reply, I saw his expression change from confusion to alarm. He just barged into the living room.   
When I turned back, I saw Jimmy slumped on the sofa, unconscious with blood stains all over his shirt.   
Dominique urgently patted him on the cheek and he remained unresponsive. He then sprinkled some water on his face and the boy slowly started to regain consciousness.   
I just stood there awestruck, watching the drama - continue to unfold in front of me.   
“Where… Where am I?” Jimmy asked, trying to look all groggy and confused.   
“You are at home my child. Are you ok? What happened?” Dominique asked pointing to his clothes.   
I stepped forward to answer, “Uncle Dominique, its all fine . He is just act…”  
Dominique raised his hand and gestured me to keep quiet. He then asked another neighbhor to fetch a doctor who lived two houses away.   
Then the screaming started again.   
“She …she …is a MONSTER”, Jimmy yelled out loud with his finger pointed at me.   
“Keep her away from ME….. Please.. Please. .Please SIR”, he cried with his eyes closed heavily leaning into Uncle Dominque, as if requiring his protection.   
All of them were staring at me now.  
I could no longer control my tears. They were just flowing down my face. It was bad enough to be treated shabbily by this kid in private.  
 But now people who I grew up knowing my entire life, were giving me looks like I was some kind of tyrant.   
I just wanted to get back home and hug my parents. I could take this no longer.   
I ran towards the entrance and opened the front door, wide open and was shocked to see a policeman standing in front of me.  
 ‘Did the neighbhors complain? Am I going to be arrested?’, I thought to myself as I struggled to control my pounding heart.  
“Is this the Parons ‘ home” he asked me. I nodded.   
“Are you the babysitter Kathy?” he continued. I nodded again.   
He then asked, “Where is Jimmy?”  
I pointed my finger at a future Oscar winner.   
For the first time I saw genuine fear in his eyes. The little rascal finally realized he had gone too far.    
I quickly explained to the officer what happened and it didn’t take him long to believe me.  
The little twerp couldn’t even look him in the eye.   
The officer then told me, “You both are coming with me to the station.”  
Before I could put in another word, a couple of constables escorted me and Jimmy into the police car.   
“Why am I being taken to the station Officer?  I have don’t nothing wrong “, I protested. But I was met with all round silence.  
When we reached the place, I saw Mr and Mrs Parsons in the station as well. I was shocked to see them locked behind bars.   
They also looked oddly dressed in full black gear. Very different from the classy attire they had worn for the concert.   
Then on the table, I saw a shot gun and other semi automatic weapons wrapped in evidence bags.   
The realization began to finally dawn on me!  
These people were some kind of criminals!  
The officer walked upto me and said, “Mr and Mrs Parson have been arrested for trying to rob a diamond merchant. They shot and injured people during the heist. So they will be going to prison for a long time.”   
“I want you to sit with the boy until someone from Social Services can come and take care of him. Understood?” he asked. I nodded my head.   
I looked at Jimmy. He had been seated on a bench across the other end of the hall.  
 He was staring into an abyss and looked lost in his own thoughts.   
I could see that he was trying to grapple with the consequences of what was about to come. His life was going to change completely from now on.   
I sat next to him on the bench. And then gently wrapped my arms around him. He hugged me back and started crying inconsolably.
