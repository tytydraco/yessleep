My middle child, Jordan, turned nine in July. We didn’t have much to spend that year, but my husband found him a small digital camera at a thrift store. It worked fine, just a little scratched. Jordan carried that thing everywhere.

It started off sweet. He’d take pictures of his siblings, of us cooking, of our dog sleeping upside down on the couch. He’d print them with the old printer in the hallway and leave them on the counter or the fridge. Most were harmless. Family stuff. Things that made me smile after long days.

Then a few weeks in, the pictures started appearing when nobody remembered him taking them.

The first one was of me making coffee in the kitchen. I was alone that morning. My husband was asleep, and the kids hadn’t woken up yet. The photo showed me turned halfway toward the sink like I’d just heard something. I asked Jordan about it and he said he took it from the stairs. I let it go, but that picture didn’t look like it came from the stairs. The angle was lower, like it was taken through the crack of the pantry door.

After that, things got strange.

Sometimes, late at night, I’d see a faint flash somewhere in the house. Once from under the bathroom door while I brushed my teeth. Another time from behind the vent in the hallway. The kind of light that makes you stop and question what you saw.

When I’d go check on Jordan, he’d always be in bed. The camera sat on his nightstand, powered off.

One night, my daughter Nadia came into our room crying. She said she heard clicking noises in her wall. Not scratching, not pipes, but clicking, like someone taking pictures. My husband got up and checked, pulled her dresser away, tapped on the drywall. Nothing.

The next morning there was a new photo on the kitchen table. It was Nadia sleeping. The photo was clear and centered, taken from above her bed.

We asked Jordan again. He swore he didn’t take it. He said he hadn’t printed anything. But the picture was on glossy paper from the same printer he used.

A few days later, Amir, our oldest, mentioned hearing the same thing. Little clicks coming from the corners of his room, sometimes behind his closet door, sometimes under his bed.

Then I started hearing it too. At night when the house got quiet, the sound would travel through the vents. A small mechanical whir, then a click.

We unplugged the printer. We even hid the camera in the laundry room. But the next morning, there were three new photos on the fridge. One of each kid, sleeping. The timestamp showed 3:17 a.m.

My husband said maybe Jordan snuck it back somehow. But Jordan  looked terrified when he saw them. He said he didn’t want the camera anymore. He said something else was using it.

We didn’t believe him until that weekend.

We’d gone out for groceries. The kids stayed home with my sister. When we came back, the front door was locked like normal. Nothing was out of place. But the walls looked wrong somehow. I didn’t understand it until I walked into the kitchen.

Every photo Jordan ever took,hundreds of them,were printed and taped across the walls. All the same glossy paper. They covered the fridge, the cabinets, the hallway, everything.

And every single picture was of the same thing.

A corner of our living room. The same exact spot.

If you look close enough, you can see a small shadow in that corner, faint but there. At first, we thought it was part of the furniture. But as the pictures go on, that shadow gets darker. Taller.

In the last photo, it isn’t a shadow anymore.

It’s Jordan, or something that looks like him, standing behind the couch with the camera lifted to his face.

Jordan’s been staying in our room ever since. He won’t go near that corner.

Sometimes, late at night, I still hear it.

A faint whir. Then a click.

I don’t know if it’s coming from the walls or from inside the camera we locked in the attic.

But I know it’s getting closer.

And I think, soon, I’ll find a new picture on the counter again.

Probably one of me sleeping.
