I've never written about this before and there are very few people in my life who I've ever told about this, and even fewer of those who actually believe me.  But recent events have me feeling like I need to share-things have become stranger and maybe even worse.  The known patterns with "my friend" have changed.  "My friend" is a bit of a tongue in cheek joke.  This presence or entity is anything but friendly.  I have what I assume is a demon, or some malevolent, entity attached to me.  I have been able to see or sense him since I was six years old.  I refuse to name him but repeatedly saying "that thing" or "the demon" gets old quickly (and makes it weird to talk about in conversation).  So, I refer to him as "my friend" and hope that just maybe the entity could feel friendly towards me? 

I was six the first time I saw him, I woke up and saw a figure in the doorway.  I was young and knew something was off but I just assumed it was my dad. I asked my parents about it the next day and they were quick to agree that it was one of them. I shrugged it off and the same thing happened the following night - figure in doorway, feels off, probably a parent. This happened multiple nights in a row, but then I heard my parents talking in their room and knew that this thing in my doorway wasn't one of them.  I whispered, "dad", on the off chance I was wrong but got no response other than this thing taking a step into the room.  My parents played it off as a bad dream the next morning and I knew they wouldn't believe otherwise.  

I eventually realized it was easier to sleep with my bedroom door closed.  This didn't stop this thing though; my closet door would sometimes open, my bedroom door, too.  Sometimes he appeared in my windows, even though my bedroom wasn't on the ground floor. Even when I could not see him, I could sense this oozing malicious presence that I knew was him. 

This has gone on for years.  Open doorways, sensing him even if I couldn't see him, and even closed doors don't stop him.  I would wake up to find him standing there, just inside the room.  Clearly an open door was just a formality, but he could be in the room even if the door was closed.  He always disappeared when the sun would come up and nearly every time he was there, he kept his distance. He would never *do* anything except loom menacingly.  A true closet and doorway monster.

I have never seen "my friend's" face - even on the rare occasions he is leaning directly over me. When I look at him, the edges seem a bit blurred and I feel like he is not in focus.  He fills anyway doorway he stands in, and when not in a doorway, he is incredibly tall. He has no distinguishing clothes and because he feels so out of focus, almost nothing about him is memorable (barring the fact he is a malicious entity that stalks me).  His hands are the one feature that sticks out. The fingers long, slender, and their movements have always seemed really stilted.  They end in jagged points though they don't appear to be talons or nails.  He has a clearly masculine shape and there is something undeniably masculine about his presence though I can't really explain it beyond gut feeling.  I have a few simple rules for myself whenever I encounter him: never acknowledge him; do not give him a name; never stare at him longer than one minute (I get a gnarly headache when I do); and don't move other than to turn over or slightly readjust in bed or on the couch.

I recently moved into a new place and had not seen him in a few months (this is normal).  However, 3 weeks ago he re-emerged.  He has broken his usual pattern of standing near the doorways and windows and has instead taken to standing next to my bed on the side I am not sleeping on or is standing at the foot of the bed.  Despite having no discernible facial features, I know that he is staring at me, I *know* it.

Three nights ago, I woke up and he was there, except he was standing at *my* side of the bed. He was not looking at me though, his head seemed to be angled up and following it, he seemed to be staring at a small door that is above my closet.  I have not opened it since I moved in but I assume it's a small storage space.  I was freaked out, more than usual, and I stayed up all night and quietly prayed until the sun came up.  Except, he lingered. He didn't disappear like usual. I could have cried, why wasn't he leaving??  He *stayed* for at least another 20 or 30 minutes before leaving.  This was not the normal thing at all. I did end up checking out the crawl space above the closet and it was a very tidy, clean space that could easily hold a few boxes.  As far as crawl spaces go, not creepy at all. The following night the same thing happened again - he stood on my side of the bed and stared up the small door, except he actually left when the sun came up.

Last night is what has prompted this though.  Last night, that small door opened and there was *another* different entity there.  Definitely feminine in shape and equally as horrifying as my long time one. She started to climb down and "my friend" moved to the foot of my bed in what looked like an attempt to block her path.  She stopped moving and he moved back near my head.  Suddenly, this new creature jumped and was standing at the foot of my bed, balancing on the footboard! Before I could react other than gasp, "my friend" grabbed my wrist, touching me for the first time ever!  He dug the tips of his fingers in, drew blood, and then dragged his fingers from wrist to elbow, leaving shallow cuts in my arm.  The new entity just seemed to stare, she cocked her head while this happened and slowly reached an arm out towards us. She then falls forward and starts to crawl forward after he released my arm - I pulled my knees to my chest and cradled my now bleeding arm and prayed that whatever the fuck was happening would be over soon.  Just as I felt the bed dip a few inches from me, "my friend" has her grabbed by the neck and pinned to a wall.  There was no noise, thought it was clear to me he slammed her there.   They stay like that for nearly 5 minutes before she suddenly disappeared.  "My friend" stood there in that spot for a while before walking over to the closet and reaching up to close the door to the crawl space.  He then came back to my bedside and took up his spot near my head.  Right as the sun came up, he stroked the back of my head and whispered, "sorry" before leaving.  

Has calling him "my friend" accidentally attached us? Did this thing really protect me from something else? I have a feeling that new entity will not be back. I'm at a loss of what to do. All established patterns have been broken.  Why is it sorry?  Is it really "my friend"?
