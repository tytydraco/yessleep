Ever since I was a child, I stared at the moon and the sky. I imagined constellations, stars burning their last breath and collapsing on themselves. Looking upon the infinite space and abyss up there would be like laying atop the ocean and looking up. I always wanted to be out there. Even now, my fond memories of my childhood underneath the stars aren't negated by my experience. Even still, with everything that happened, I sometimes look up now, staring into the inky black of infinite twilight and ask, where did the lights go?

My name is Josh. I explored the stars. Wearing the thick white suit whilst breathlessly staring upon Jupiter, so close I felt I could touch it, I was in my element. When I took the psychiatric test to see if I would get along with people, I fudged it a bit. I needed to be out there. In that space that occupies Space. I dreamt of it as a child, and I don't think I'd ever change it. Being an explorer like that, going further than any human before, it thrilled me. I remember the flashing red lights as we drew closer to Titan. We were all in our EVA suits, waiting for the vacuum of space to demolish us all. When I looked out and saw what I did, the mesmerising lights and the cascading constellations,  I no longer felt awe. I felt the terror. My bio system read to me -imminent impact, internal leakage found, origin unknown-. I think everybody heard that as we were crashing, the immolating ship condensed like an empty coke can against two hands applying pressure. I still don't know if I died that day. I don't know if I want to. To be honest, I prefer where I am now.

In the black depth of my consciousness, I heard the voice. "Cachowsky, are you alive in there?" I shot up in my seat. No standing, too weak for that. Just horrified. For a second I thought it was a dream. That was until I smelt the aroma of urea. And then, I snapped into place. "Who's there? Who's alive? What happened?" I looked up to see Burton in his EVA suits, standing over me with a smile. "We made it, a bit of a rocky landing, but we're all alive." I sighed in relief, and looked up to him. "Have we made contact with Houston?" He shook his head. "No, it'll take a while to fix the Comms. Message will take 30 minutes, the Comms arrayâ€¦ now that's tricky." He smiled and looked at me. "Cachowsky, you're the engineer, get into the set up and tell us how long." At first I struggled up, the gravity was different to the tests, my legs were shaking. And then, after dusting myself off, I walked. My chaffed legs felt the 3 miles. Like those snake bites you got as a kid but on my thighs. Me and Burton talked for the walk about our situation. A solar flare disrupted the electronics. Structural integrity couldn't hold. Nothing about this situation was right. But we got to the outpost, and I checked the Comms array outside.

"Fuck me, Burton this is fucked. There is no way we're fixing this any time soon, we're gonna have to scavenge parts from the shi-" I looked up to see his face, cold. Staring daggers. I wasn't helping. "Burton, I can fix it, but I need time." Burton's face changed. "Sounds good to me, Cachowsky." And he started walking to the outpost they had just set up. We were lucky our oxygen tanks had a generator. It could take the cO2 we breathed out and turn it into breathing air. NASA spent a fortune on us. Space was cheaper than fixing the planet, and we were a last ditch effort. The Comms array was in tatters. Like something mauled it. A bear or something. I shook the thought out of my head. I couldn't start going doolally at the first sign of trouble. I can fix this. This is what I'm here to do. 

I passed my MIT degree with honours. I was the best engineer of the year, and NASA were interested. A Polish immigrant going out and achieving the impossible? That was one easy hire. I was born in Massachusetts, but my dad was Polish. Proud man. Hard man. Good man. He died when I was seven. He told me, to paraphrase "... Shoot for the stars and you'll make it, I'm proud son." That was the last thing I heard from him. I was going to make him proud. I got in because I made a near indestructible Comms array. Fat load of good that got me. Shit. I'm stuck in space and there's nothing I can do. I looked up and saw it again. The lights. Green, purples, blues, orange. They glided across the sky like leaves. And then it stopped. And turned to me. I stared for a minute, not realising what it was doing. Once I knew, I went for my short transmission radio, but it was gone again when I looked. "Cachowsky, get in here, we're getting the food." When I got up, I couldn't help but feel like I was being watched as I got in the outpost.

6 months passed. Hard, arduous months. We had the supplies to survive decades, but I don't think any of us wanted to. Everytime I'd go out to fix the array, it was more busted than before. Multiple times Burton and Pierce had to drag me away. I was screaming, shouting to the sky. Remembering now, it wasn't all shits creek. We all got along well. We ate dinner, talked, chatted, had fun. We had a food fight. I felt like a kid again, looking up at the sky each night. But now, I was seeing the galaxy in a way with my own eyes that I had never even dreamt of. They resented me, of course they did. The Polish immigrant who couldn't fix his own technology. But then it started to change. Everyone understood my impossible task, and became more about survival than fun. I wish I didn't talk about them like this, but here it goes. Burton dragged me out of bed, pinned me against the wall. Our beards were hagard and grown, bushy cavemen in the infinite cosmos. A rage, blinded and red stared me in the eye that I couldn't comprehend. "Our you fucking with us Cachowsky, because if you are I swear to god..." A fist dented the wall next to me. I was shaking in terror. The crew pulled him off, Pierce, Briggs, Dylan. They all were seething with rage as well, but they knew I was their best way out of their. I crumpled to the floor, and began sobbing. I screamed "I tried fucking everything! I took apart our ship! I did it all... Don't you understand? Someone else here is sabotaging our Comms array!" I still have the vocal nodules from the scream, I felt the iron taste of blood in my throat. 

They all scoffed at my assertion. But then, each one looked at eachother in new eyes. Pierce spoke with his Mid-Western accent, "Alright, but who in the living fuck doesn't want us off this rock? Huh?" I shrugged, I didn't know what to say. But when I spoke, I stuttered. "E-everyone wants to leave, I know. Maybe it's outside forces? I don't know... Do you ever feel like you're being watched?" They all tried to hide it, but they knew what I was talking about. Burton spoke. "Yeah. I have. Everytime I go out there, I feel it. I've put it down to cabin fever, but I don't know anymore to be honest..." We all hung out heads, as Dylan said the first smart idea of this whole incident - even as an astrophysicist. "Why don't we bring the Comms array in and fix it here?" I felt like an idiot. I was blushing, embarrassed. The tension in the room could be cut with a butter knife, but with one moment of clarity from Dylan, Burton started to chuckle under his breath. Soon, everyone was drinking whiskey and getting along again. Everyone except for me. I was out in the vacuum of space, bringing the parts and the array in. I felt something on my foot move. And as I looked down, I saw a pipe disconnect on the way in. Fuck me - I thought, we're going to die here.

I won't lie, spending 5 years of my life up there is something I would wish upon no one. It was hell. Especially at month seven. That's when shit hit the fan. For the longest time, we made progress on the machine and it wasn't being degraded. Dylan was a bit spaced out, but my god that was a genius idea. It was 80% of the way there. We were so close. And then it happened. Something I will never unsee. The red lights flashed. I thought I was back on the ship, but when I opened my eyes, everyone ran in a panic to the main hall. And that's when we saw it. It was hard as the rock of Titan. It sounds as if it was pummeling the array was like a pickaxe demolishing a wall. And the sound. It was garbled, tense, desperate for air. And then it cranked it's head at us, the aliens to its planet. And it screeched. A siren shriek that gave me tinnitus even now. I bled out my ears for an hour.

Burton was the first person to grab something to hit it. He grappled that chair like some wrestler and started beating it. Each hit it recoiled, each hit the chair was more and more bent. It flew into the window. We all turned our head at once as we saw Briggs run to the shutter. It was too late. Just as he pressed it, the vacuum hit and we all hit the floor. Except Briggs and the creature. Opposite ends of the spectrum. It stayed still, and started crawling along the walls, scuttling like some spider. Briggs' arm was caught in the window, and in a second he was gone, floating in the vacuum of space. He became frosted, solid ice. He imploded. His blood and guts spilling out of any orifice it could. And as he floated, and we regained our bearings, we realised we weren't all making it out alive. 

Burton looked at me. "What the fuck was that?" I stared out where the window was once. I remember, even now, the horror on his face. Briggs was a good man. He cared about us, his family, about getting home. I never really spoke to him. I only spoke to Burton in a friendly manner. And as I looked around the base, seeing the tattered and ruined mausoleum we inhabited, I knew for certain. Only one of us was getting out of there. And I felt it wasn't me.
