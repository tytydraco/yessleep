 

The waiting room was about the size of a small bedroom. There was one large plant in the corner and a framed poster on the wall. Besides the door to the office beyond, that was it. The carpet was worn and stained here and there with all manner of once gooey substances. There was even a comically large wad of gum that had been darkened and flattened over years and years of foot traffic. Some kind of big band music was coming out of a rusty speaker in the wall. The volume was pleasant, but I wouldn’t have said the same about the music. 

I had been staring at that poster for around twenty minutes. The style was some kind of colorful expressionist thing, I think. There was a woman lying supine with her arms extended over her head at the foot of a bridge. There was an old street lamp, and crouched under it was a ghoulish looking man dressed in black. He was staring at the woman and he had a menacing arm on her shoulder. The writing on the poster was something in german. It gave me the creeps. 

I was beginning to think this was a mistake. This was my new therapist's office afterall, and the waiting room wasn’t giving me a whole lot of confidence that this would be worth my time. I had already tried so many different people and I took a chance because it was a free assessment.

I looked at the time on my phone and shook my head before I stood up. It was now almost thirty minutes past my appointment time, and this guy didn’t even have a receptionist to let me know what was going on. There had only been a bell that had a quiet jingle when I walked through the door. I should have figured it wasn’t going to work when I pulled up to the strip mall. His office was sandwiched between a Hawaiian BBQ and a UPS office. What could I have expected from a therapist in Austin?

It was worth a try, but it was time to leave. Before I could make a move, the other door opened.

“Mr. Todd?! How the hell are you?!” He thrust out a hand with shiny manicured nails. He was wearing a white t-shirt, floral board shorts, and he had neon green flip flops on his feet. He was a wispy little guy with a full mane of gray bed head. I was stunned by his appearance, and there was nothing I could do to hide that.

“I’m not what you expected?” He asked, but he already knew the answer to his question. He seemed happy that it was indeed the case.

“Not exactly.” I shook his hand. His teeth were perfect and just as white as his shirt. His accent sounded like he was originally from the midwest, and the cadence of his speech was off. He tended to emphasize his words in the oddest ways, as if every syllable was a savory morsel that he was determined to enjoy. 

“I’m Benny. Come on in.” He waved me into his office. I checked my watch and hesitated. “I tell you what Mr. Tood, I’m very sorry about making you wait so long, but you’re already here. Obviously there’s something telling you in your brain that you should leave, but just give me a few minutes and if you still feel that way, you can go. No big deal.”

I was desperate. I had been experiencing debilitating panic attacks and I’d been to the hospital several times because I was convinced that I was having a heart attack. No therapy had been helping at all. I wanted to leave, but I kept asking myself, what if? What if this is the one guy that can help, and you’re about to walk because he was fifteen minutes late and creeped you out a little bit. And again, it was free. I was defeated. I nodded and walked inside his office.

Inside was the same poster hanging on the wall behind his desk next to a strange looking cuckoo clock. There was a small table with a small fountain on top of it and a large plastic fern in the opposite corner. On the other side of his desk was a tacky plastic pillar of white and gold. A brass bust of a chubby man with multiple chins sat on top of the pillar and it was adorned with a small plaque that simply said, “ Dr. Bob.”

His desk was bare except for a brand new legal pad, a bic pen, and a rotary phone. There were two ratty but comfortable looking arm chairs on either side of the desk.

“Come on in and have a seat.” I sunk down into the seat. It felt as if the springs had gone out sometime in the eighties. The cuckoo clock went off, and I realized that I recognized it.

“That’s an interesting clock. The Scream?”

“That is exactly what it is. Good eye Mr. Todd. Our very own Dr. Bob also makes very unique handmade clocks.” The clock itself was a background of Edvard Munch’s painting and there were two tiny doors that opened in the middle of it that allowed the little screaming man to emerge and give a mechanical screech as it counted off the hour. By my count of the awful noise, his clock was three hours and twenty minutes off.

“I think your clock needs some attention.”

“Oh, what does time really mean Mr. Todd? I don’t really worry about it.”

“That’s also… very interesting music you’ve got playing.” 

“My favorite band, The Squirrel Nut Zippers. This is the Hot album. I try to get my clients comfortable the second they set foot inside the lobby. Are you comfortable Mr. Todd?”

“Sure.”

“The only way there can be trust between us is if I’m one hundred percent myself right from the beginning. Completely honest. There should be no pretense between a therapist and their clients.” I couldn’t exactly argue with that. He plopped down in his chair and scooped up the pen and pad.

“What uh…what’s that poster from?” I motioned to it.

“The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Yeah… that uh… that movie is an important part of my technique. Well… it’s not my technique… it’s Bob’s technique.” He motioned to the bust. “That movie put the idea in his head for a new kind of therapy. The Process.”

“What kind of therapy is that?” 

“The only one that works Mr. Todd. Thank you for answering the online questionnaire by the way. You were very… thorough in your answers.”

“Kind of odd questions for a therapist.”

“Yeah, I can see why someone like you would think that.” 

“So… I guess I should ask what kind of insurance you take.” He didn’t answer my question. He just smiled at me with those perfect teeth. The silence was awkward, and after a while I had to say something. “Hello?”

“We don’t do insurance, and by the time you actually go through the process, you’re going to want to give us everything you have because you’re going to be so thankful with your new outlook. But don’t worry, we won’t take everything. Just your first born.” 

“No, seriously. What insurance…”

“Did I stutter, Mr. Todd?” I exhaled. This was a mistake. I figured this guy would be some kind of snake oil salesman, preying on people like me, but I just had to give it a chance. I decided that I was done. 

“Uh…Benny. I think I’m going to see myself out.” I stood up, but he stayed seated. I turned toward the door and I saw that up in the corner behind me was a small video monitor. It showed a black and white image of the waiting room. I wondered if he had been watching me the whole time I sat out there? I turned back toward him.

“You watched as I sat out there for almost half an hour? What the hell kind of therapist are you?” He waved off my question.

“Let me ask you something Mr. Todd, you called me because you got a flier on your car while you were at another therapist's office, correct?”

“Yeah.” I was shaking now. His tone was almost accusatory, but he was doing it through that smile. I wanted to yank his skinny Tommy Bahama ass out of that chair and stuff him inside of his desk.

“It’s the only way I advertise. Lucky for you, I’ve expanded down to Seguin. I’m going to make a random guess that the hack you were seeing before you came to see me was probably around your fifth try. Five therapists before me, and that doesn’t count those ridiculous counselors that your parents made you see in school. You don’t have to answer me because I know I’m right.” He was right and that bothered me. 

“You know the type of person who would even look at that flier to begin with? The type of person who’s at the end of their rope. The type of person who’s desperate. Whether it's anxiety, some kind of trauma, death, hereditary mental whatcha-ma-jigits, you name it. The only type of person who would even walk into this fly by night looking shithole really needs help, and that type has been looking for it for a very long time and nothing works. Not talking, not drugs, not radical acceptance, nothing. How close am I getting?” I didn’t answer him. 

“I know something inside your brain is screaming at you to run out the door, but there’s something else in there too. Something else in there that knows life isn’t supposed to be this way. I obviously read the questionnaire you emailed my office. You have a lot of problems Mr. Todd. This assessment isn’t really you seeing if I’m the right guy for you. It’s more seeing if you’re the right guy for this kind of therapy, and I think you are.”

“Well that’s too bad Benny. Have a nice day.” I stormed out to the parking lot and drove away. I had quit smoking almost a year ago, but I accepted the fact that I was going to backslide today. I promised myself that I would at the very least smoke only half of the pack. The whole scene was just a little too ridiculous and off putting. At least it was free.

I couldn’t stop staring at my children during dinner. I said a silent prayer begging God to spare them from the confusion and mental anguish that I had. I watched my mother suffer with it and we lost my Grandpa to it almost twenty years ago. I just wanted to be better.

My wife caught me staring and I gave her a smile and wink across the table. I’m usually very good at hiding my mood, but I wasn’t going to get anything past Sarah that night. Of course she didn’t bring anything up in front of our kids, she waited until after she put them to bed. 

She found me on the porch having a cigarette. I wasn’t even going to try and hide it this time.

“Rough day?”

“Well… you know.” I held up the cigarette. She had quit after she found out she was pregnant with Lucy, our oldest. That was seven years ago. “I hope you’re not too disappointed in me.” She took the cigarette out of my hand and took a deep drag and then handed it back to me.

“I’m not disappointed in you. I just wish there was something I could do. How’s the anxiety today?”

“Uh…strangely not bad. Haven’t had any problems. It was something else that was different today.” I went through the whole story with her while we shared the cigarette. She laughed a little, shook her head, and offered to kick Benny’s ass. I love my wife. I love my kids. I should be calm and happy.

She made me come inside and then offered to end my night in the best way possible. I gave her a kiss and oddly enough, I declined her offer. Instead I sat on the couch and looked for the movie Benny had told me about. I made myself a drink and sat down to watch it.

It was boring, it was old, and it didn’t make a whole lot of sense to me why anyone would waste their time watching it. Which is probably why I fell asleep halfway through it.

Later that night, I woke up from a terrible nightmare. I was still on the couch and it was almost three in the morning. My television was still on and it was playing that movie again. I couldn’t find my remote, so I struggled to my feet and walked over to turn it off, and that’s when I saw that my front door was cracked open.

I closed it and locked it, and then I had a panicked feeling that someone was in our home. I ran to check on my kids and found that both of them were sleeping in their beds. I went into my bedroom, and my wife was softly snoring on her back, but there was a bottle on her nightstand that I didn’t recognize. It looked like an old glass medicine bottle, and the top was open. I grabbed it and gave it a slight wave underneath my nose. Whatever was inside made my head swimmy, and I immediately put it back down. I had intended to grab my baseball bat and do what my children call a “monster check” of our home, but someone was behind me. They must have been hiding behind the bathroom door, waiting for me.

I felt a damp cloth pressed against my face from someone behind me. I struggled the best that I could, but within seconds, everything was dark and I fell.

When I finally came to, I was naked and tied to an old creaking chair. Tape was wrapped around my face, and it was hot. So hot. I struggled against the ropes, but the more I jerked, the more the knots bore down on my wrists and ankles. I was in a shed that reeked of cedar and motor oil. Sunlight came through the plank siding and that’s when I realized where a lot of the heat was coming from. There was a hanging work light above my head.

There were nightmarish cuckoo clocks lining the walls of the shed and all of them were set to different times. One would go off at a new hour, and then five minutes later, another would go off, and so on and so forth. One of them was identical to the one I had seen in Benny’s office. A work bench was in the corner. The only things on top of it were an old CD player and a bundle of red cloth that was tied up with a strip of leather. Next to the bench, there was a white plastic utility sink mounted on the wall. It was filthy with dirt and grime and unmistakable streaks of red down the sides of it. The last thing I noticed before the door opened behind me was a tattered leather apron hanging from a hook.

“My God! We have got to get some air freshener in here or something. Texas in August, what should I expect?” Benny walked over and stood in front of me. I raged against the ropes. I wanted to kill him. “Are you ready to start? I hope so. Dr. Bob has a couple of propane heaters that are piping it in right now. My goodness, you’re sweaty. We’re going to have to let you cook for a little bit, and then we’ll start. Good luck Mr. Todd. I hope you’re one of the lucky ones. Some people don’t make it.”

The skinny bastard gave me a wink and then he started to walk out, but then turned around and faced me again. “I should let you know that your family is safe. We put them to sleep just in case there was a struggle. I left a note for your wife that said you needed some time to think. So…you’re welcome.” He walked out and shut the door behind him.

I sat in that shed for hours. The sounds of the clocks were maddening. I continued to try and free myself for a while after Benny had left, but one of the knots on my left foot tightened into my skin so much that I stopped trying altogether. My foot had started to turn purple, and it was getting darker and darker as the hours went by.

I could see through the cracks in the shed that it had gotten dark outside and it was some time after that when I heard the door open behind me. A small, chubby, middle aged man walked around and stood in front of me. I recognized his face instantly. It was the same as the bust in Benny’s office. He was wearing nothing but a crusty pair of white briefs that sagged over his ass and white Crocs on his feet. He was covered in sweat and the hair on his arms and shoulders were weighted down by it. He was holding a round metal handmade device with a crank on the side of it in one hand and a gallon jug of water in the other.

“Mr. Todd, I’m Doctor Bob. It’s nice to finally meet you. Benny has told me a lot about you.” He put the jug down and then reached over and placed the device around my head like a halo and he gave the crank a few turns until it was tightened around the top of my head. Then he stood back and stared at me. I could hear him breathing and it sounded like he was slurping in air through buttery lungs. He wasn’t saying anything. He stood there for another three minutes before one of the clocks went off, and then he reached over and gave the crank a quarter turn. The halo tightened. He stepped back again, grabbed his jug of water and gulped deeply from it, and continued to stare at me and breathe. Another clock went off five minutes later and he gave the crank another quarter turn. It felt like the device was about to start crushing my head.

This went on, over and over and I eventually lost count of how many times it happened. My head was pounding from the pain and I was tired from trying to beg him to stop through the duct tape. Every once in a while, Dr. Bob would look into my eyes and mutter something under his labored breaths, until finally he must have seen something that satisfied him.

“Alright Mr. Todd. Sorry, but I had to drive it out of your brains. All of us have suffered from the same malady from the time our ancestors crawled out of the muck. They grafted themselves onto us before our first breath of air. What plagues you is no different from what plagues everyone. This next part is up to you. Separation is the most dangerous part. You’re fighting for your life. Don’t misunderstand the danger it’s putting you in. Only think of all the good things, and I’ll take care of the negative. Bear with me for a moment.”

The ugly little man grunted as he scratched his ass and walked over to the sink. He grabbed the butcher’s apron from the wall, and after he put it on, he grabbed the grimy bar of soap from the sink and washed his hairy arms and hands. I started to think of my wife. I started to think of my kids. This was it. I had no idea what he was going to do, but I was sure it was over.

He walked over to the work bench and untied the leather strap around the red bundle. When he unrolled it, I saw several crudely fabricated metal instruments.  He pushed the play button on the cd player and it came alive. He turned the volume as far up as it would go. After that, Dr. Bob grabbed one of his instruments, shoved it into the already stressed waistband of his briefs, and grabbed another one from the red bundle. It looked like a cross between a scalpel and a rusty ice cream scoop. He started moving his hips to the sound of the building music and began to slowly dance in front of me. 

“The music helps to keep it out of your head. I can’t tell you how happy I was when I read from your questionnaire that your least favorite music is Bjork. It’s not every time I get to work to some of my favorite music. This is her version of “Oh So Quiet”. I put it on a loop for two hours. Hopefully this won’t take that long, but you never know.” Just as he finished his speech, the music exploded into the chorus and he began to swing to it. His steps were far too fluid to have been improvised. I had the feeling that he had danced to this specific song many times before.

I have to admit, for just that moment, I had forgotten about the pain in my head. I had forgotten about my throbbing foot that was losing circulation. I had forgotten about the fact that I was going to die. All I could think of was how bizarre the whole thing must have looked. 

I was naked and tied to a chair in a wood shed wearing some kind of torturous metal halo while a rotund man covered in body hair and sweat danced in front of me in his underwear while he was wielding the weapon he was going to kill me with. It was a redneck version of Reservoir Dogs that could only happen on a hot August night in Texas, and I laughed at the absurdity of it all. For just that second, I felt no pain. But then it all changed when Dr. Bob stopped dancing and started to cut.  

“It skitters along the bones. Fast little boggers.” He shouted above the music.

He mouthed along with the music while he dug into my skin over and over again with that awful tool. I was breathing hard and screaming against the duct tape, but the music was so loud, there’s no way anyone could hear me.

He made a long cut along my shoulder blade. My body was slick with my sweat and my blood, and I kept thinking about my family. I couldn’t help but think these sick people had taken them as well, despite what Benny had said. They were going to hurt them when they were finished with me. I needed to get out. I needed to make sure my family was safe.

“There you go Mr. Todd. You’re doing great. Happy thoughts.”  He was slicing along my ribs.

The chair creaked and groaned against the bolts that were holding it onto the wooden floor. My wrists were soaked, and I felt that the rope on my right wrist had shifted slightly. I knew I could overpower him if I could work at least one of my arms free. My chest and stomach were a mess of fluid and agony from all of his cutting.

“I’m almost done. I can’t believe how fast this is going.” He buried the tool deep into my right thigh and I almost passed out, but I kept thinking of my family. I kept thinking of how much better life was going to be if I could just break free.

The rope slipped again on my wrist, and I realized that I could pull it free. I knew that I only had one chance. I waited until he started in on my chest again. He was close enough for me to grab him, and I yanked outward with my right arm. I could hear a bone pop as I ripped my wrist free and clamped my fingers around his throat. I was going to get out of this. I started to squeeze as hard as I could.

Dr. Bob calmly grabbed my wrist and plucked it from his throat as if I was no stronger than a child, and he smiled as he jabbed the scalpel into the top of my offending hand.

“I know what it’s making you think Mr. Todd.” He bored into my hand with his instrument. “It’s making you think that all of this has given you a new lease on life if you can just get away, but that’s simply not true. That’s not why we’re here. If you were to escape, your mind would eventually revert back, because it's not truly yours. You would continue much the way you have, and you would die without ever being free.”

He let go of my wrist and grabbed me below the elbow and slammed it down on the arm of the chair.

“Look down Mr. Todd. Do you see it?” I looked down and saw that something was moving underneath my skin. It was trying to move back up my arm past the vice-like grip of Dr. Bob, but he was pressing down so hard that my forearm was beginning to turn red. Whatever was moving in there, it was trapped below my elbow. My head was spinning and I knew I was about to lose consciousness. I began to laugh through it all. “It’s trying to hide again. The pain you’re feeling. The trauma. We’re told it can cause euphoria and sometimes hallucinations. A release of endorphins that acts just like morphine on the brain. That certain parts of the experience aren’t real. That’s not true. It’s because you’re finally starting to see. Embrace the process.”

Dr. Bob carefully cut an incision down my forearm and began to dig into the inside of my arm. I felt as if something vital was being taken from me and I began to wonder if I was starting to die. 

He dropped the instrument he had been using and grabbed the other instrument from his waistband. It looked like a pair of small Barbecue tongs. He jammed them beneath my skin and I could feel them hunting for something inside of me. I thought of my Sarah. I couldn’t give up. Iwas going to live through this.

“I got it!” He smiled and pulled the tongs up with a jerk. Something made a popping sound as it was removed from under my skin. I looked down and writhing there between the tongs was a small creature with many legs all around its plump little body. Something more aquatic looking than insect-like. It was spitting out a needle-like tongue and it was staring at me with six blue eyes. I could hear it in my head, or rather feel it, pleading with me to put it back inside where it’s lived our whole lives. Pleading with me not to let the fat man kill it.

“Don’t listen to it Mr. Todd. It can’t control you anymore. You’re free.” I was still in pain, but it was different; somehow manageable. There was a sudden peace. I tore my eyes from the thing that was taken from inside of me and I looked at Dr. Bob.  He looked different, as if kindness could be embodied by a human. His face was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen with my own eyes.I looked around the shed and everything seemed more alive. I realized that I wasn’t hearing, but feeling the music coming out of the cd player, and I was experiencing all of the passion that had been put into it. Everything around me felt so new and I had never felt so awake.

After I watched Dr. Bob drop the thing on the floor and stomp on it with his crocks until it was mush, he untied me and carried me outside to a new life. There was a large crowd of men and women who were all smiling and clapping. They were there for my new birthday. They were all so beautiful and vibrant.

It’s only been a few days since I woke up. Since I was freed. I’m one of the lucky ones, and I have decided to dedicate my life to helping the cause of waking up humanity. That’s why I’ve decided to write this. I’m now standing outside of the shed, and my wife is inside with Dr. Bob. My new family is smoking a brisket in the meadow, just a stone's throw away from the shed. They’re just as excited for our new addition as I am. It’s taking longer than it did with me. I’m concerned that she might be one of the unlucky ones that don’t make it, but no matter what happens with my wife, I’m just happy to have this new life. It’s impossible not to be happy. Confusion, anxiety, anger, it’s all gone. They’re alien concepts to me now.

I’m sure my wife will survive and when it’s all over, we’re going to have to have a discussion about our children, and when they’ll be going through The Process.
