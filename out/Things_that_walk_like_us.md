Im not even supposed to be awake.
Its a school night, and my Dad would lose his mind if he knew I was still scrolling on tiktok at 2:00. But my brain wouldn't shut off, my room feels hot and itchy, I needed some water. 

The house was stupid quiet. Not the peaceful type, The heavy kind. I pushed open the kitchen door and the floor squeaked under my heel, Loud in the dark. I grabbed a glass and let the tap run, staring at that tiny reflection in the window. My eyes looked tired.

Then I heard a crunch, then another, then 2 more. It kept going. Footsteps, slow and steady, rhythmic almost. I froze, holding my glass halfway to my mouth. Racoons don't walk like that, neither do deer, this was human.

I killed the kitchen light so whoever it was wouldn't see me, then eased up the blinds with two fingers. My stomach dropped straight through the floor. It was Darius.

Barefoot, walking towards the trees behind my house, he walked with purpose, almost like he was being pulled by a rope. His arms hung loose by his sides. His head didn't look around. Darius wasn't wearing a jacket though it was cold enough to see my breath fog the window; in fact he wasn't even shivering.

He just walked. Straight, silent, smooth, like he had rehearsed it hundreds of times. My mouth dried out, I didn't even think, just whispered:

“Darius, what the hell are you doing?”

He didn't stop, though why would he, Its not like he could hear me. He just kept walking. I stepped outside, barefoot on the freezing cement, breath shaking in front of me.
“Darius?” I said again. “Dude, are you good?”

Nothing, not a single reaction. He reached the first line of trees and disappeared into the dark. I stood there for what seemed like hours, waiting for him to come back out. He didn't.

Eventually I went inside, locked the door, and lay in bed staring at the ceiling until the moonlight faded to sunlight. Feeling like I'd seen something I wasn't supposed to.

By the time I got to school, I felt like I'd been hit like a bus. No sleep and a looping mind, Made me feel like shit. I walked into first period, and my heart actually skipped.

Darius was already in his seat. Wearing clean clothes. Hair perfect. Smiling at the worksheet in front of him, he couldn't actually be exited to be awake at this time.

“Yo” I said as I slid into the desk next to him, voice low. “Where’d you go last night?”

He looked up at me with a calm expression i’d never seen on him. Darius is usually twitchy, always tapping his pencil, bouncing his leg, and cracking stupid jokes.

But this version blinked once, really slow.

“What do you mean?” he said. “I went to bed early.”

“You were outside my house,” I said. “Like… at two”

He tilted his head like a confused dog.
“I wasn't anywhere near your house. Malcolm.”

He said it so logically, so politely, I almost doubted myself. Almost. The weirdness didn't stop there. At lunch, this girl named Maya, who literally had a whole EpiPen situation because shes allergic to strawberries, sat down with a yogurt cup that had bright red chunks in it.

Her friend said, “Maya, isn't that dangerous for you?”

Maya just smiled with a distant look and said:
“Are you calling me fat, you bitch” she said it jokingly, in my memory she had never made a funny joke before, this was out of character. But then she ate it, like nothing was wrong.

In third period, my math teacher gave a whole explanation about linear quotations without blinking. Not once. I stared at her eyes the whole time. They stayed still, glass like, Terrifying.

By the time the final bell rang, I felt like my brain was unspooling. My shirt felt too tight. My hands were shaking. My heart wouldn't slow down. 

I kept thinking about Darius disappearing into the woods and coming back out like nothing happened. Like someone pressed reset on him.

I ended the day whispering to myself,
“What the hell is happening?”

And for the first time in my entire life (Other than when my uncle was staying over), I was scared to go home.

I actually slept.

Not great sleep, the kind where you wake up ten times and your dreams feel like blurry static. But enough that my head wasn't pulsating anymore. When I opened my eyes, sunlight was leaking through my blinds in these soft yellow bars.

I almost convinced myself that yesterday didn't happen.
That maybe I was tired, hallucinating, being dramatic.

But then I remembered how darius walked.
The bare feet.
The blank face.

And the weird things at school. It all piled into my chest. I needed answers. I couldn’t sit in my room scrolling on TikTok all day, pretending nothing happened.

So I got dressed, grabbed a hoodie, and decided to go back towards the woods.

Not the spot behind my house, I didn’t want to see Darius again. I went the other direction, deep, past the creek then past the hiking trail. As far as my legs would take me.

The woods felt corrupt the farther I walked. Quiet, dead quiet. No birds, no crunch of animals, just my own breathing and the wind brushing through branches.

About two miles in I saw it. 

An old barn, leaning sideways, to tired to stand straight. Red paint peeling off. Rust on the metal roof. Broken windows. It looked abandoned for years. 

I don’t know why I felt pulled to it. It wasn’t curiosity, but a feeling in my stomach dragging me to it. Step by step.

I opened the door. It groaned open slow, it was warning me. Inside the place smelled gross, dust, mold, and something else. Something putrid, rotten, it smelled like raw meat left out in the sun. 

The floorboards creaked underneath my shoes. Light leaked through holes in the roof in skinny little beams. 

My foot hit a loose plank, I looked down. The board shifted and the smell got ten times worse. I crouched down and pried it up with my fingers. 

Even though everything in my brain screamed stop. The wood broke surprisingly easily, like someone had opened it before. 

I lifted the plank. And I saw faces.

People, stacked like trash bags. Gray skin, twisted arms, half covered in dirt. Eyes open on some, closed on others. 

I recognized some immediately. 

Maya. hair still in a bun, but her skin pale and sunken. Her lips blue.

Darius. The real Darius. Jaw slack, shirt torn, blood on his cheek. 

I stumbled back so fast I hit the wall behind me. My chest felt like it was collapsing. My eyes burned, I couldn’t breathe. I vomited, I vomited a lot. 

The truth hit me like my dad does. 

The Darius at school yesterday wasn’t Darius. The Maya at lunch wasn’t Maya. They were fakes. Copies. Something wearing their faces. 

I wanted to run, but before my body could move. Footsteps. Right outside the barn. Heavy, slow. 

I froze.

Someone was here. 

I dropped to the ground and crawled behind an old metal feeding trough, my heart was beating so loud I was convinced whoever it was could hear it. 

The barn door creaked open.

A man walked in. Tall, wearing dirty jeans, mud up his legs. His shoulders were hunched, head hung low. Shaking slightly like he was trying to fight off a migraine.

I didn’t recognize him.

He walked to the center of the barn. Stood perfectly still. Lifted his head toward the ceiling. Reached into his jacket. And in an instant he held a gun in his hands. 

My hand was shaking so hard it hit trough with a tiny ding. The man turned in my direction, he spotted me instantly, we made eye contact. He put the gun to his temple, and with a tear rolling down his cheek. He collapsed.

My ears rung, I slapped my hand over my mouth, tears filling my eyes. I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe, because the worst part hadn’t even started yet.

The man’s body twitched. At first just a little. Then violently, something was waking up beneath his skin. 

His chest expanded unnaturally, stretching the skin tight. His stomach started bulging upward. Then, it grew. A mass. Black red, wet, pulsating like a heart. It pushed up through his throat, through the hole in his skull, out of his mouth, out of his eyes, stretching them until they tore.

I clamped both hands over my mouth to keep from gagging. 

The mass kept growing then began to shift. Bones formed inside of it, snapping into place. Skin stretched into the new shape. Hair sprouted. 

Then standing over the man’s corpse, was a perfect copy of him. 

Same height.
Same face.
Same haircut.
Same everything.

Except its eyes. His eyes were so still, so clean. Like a babies eyes straight out of the womb. The copy wiped a smear of blood from his cheek with mechanical calm. It undressed the corpse. Replacing its naked body with the blood stained clothes of the dead man.

Then it grabbed the dead man by the wrists, dragged him to the hole in the floorboards, and shoved him inside. Right next to Maya, next to Darius, Next to the others.

It pressed the plank back in place. Then it turned, straightened its shirt, rolled its shoulders back into perfect posture. And walked out the barn like nothing happened.

No rush,
No nerves,
Just calm, smooth, practiced movement.

I stayed hidden behind the trough long after its footsteps faded, shaking so hard my teeth clicked. The world wasn’t what I thought it was anymore. 

And I knew without a doubt 

Something is replacing people in my town. 

And it is only the beginning.
