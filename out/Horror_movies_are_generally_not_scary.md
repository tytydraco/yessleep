Horror movies never scared me, neither the horror books nor the haunted houses.  I was never the type of kid to sleep with his blankets above the face or a tiny night light like a normal kid, I never felt the necessity to run my mother's bed after a nightmare, as a matter of fact I never had many nightmares and when I did, I didn't consider them as such.

My whole life I was living through a bubble that protected me from everything that could hurt me, so, why would I be scared? Until that moment I didn't have a reason to. I saw it as kids' thing, but of course I don't feel that way anymore.

I'm narrating this message because it's too late for me to be saved, so forgive me that my message is long, but I want to enjoy the little time I have left. I will die when I'm finished narrating this message.

It all started with what I treated as a virus, they sent me a link with a video called "Children go out to play" to me the title sounded pretty fragile and nothing dangerous. 

The person that sent me this told me it's worth taking a look, up until this day I can't remember exactly what the video was about, but I do remember the feeling it gave me it wasn't fear it was similar, it made feel.... uncomfortable.

From that moment on things just kept getting worse, the background image from my PC changed to a woman with a knife that looked at me from what it seemed to be a bedroom, and from then on laughs and sounds and screams came out of my computer, even if the sound was off and then suddenly the famous 'screamers' started to show up on my screen and those images were very real, the putrid the eyes, the corrugated skin everything that I was seeing looked very real.

A few days later a strange smell started coming out straight from my computer, it was undeniably the smell of death. The smell was driving me crazy and for moment I thought I was, so what else could I do? I bought another computer, everything was fine for the next month or two, I was able to live normally but after that the voices and the screams came back again, they became louder than before.

Never did it cross my mind what would happen after I watched that video. The computer, that fucking computer was on, I disconnected that thing but that's not all, the woman from the image was tumbling towards me and I got close to the screen like if I was hypnotized. When I sat down the figure started decomposing and it slowly faded away. My background image came back to normal, but I knew that this wasn't done. 

Unintentionally I saw my reflection in the little light of my screen and behind me I saw that same woman with a bloodied knife. It was something fast like a flash of light, I knew this wasn't over, so I came here to type this out. I know you all like to be scared from time to time am I wrong? take my advice, the advice of someone that has experienced true fear. 

This isn't always fun and much less a game, but of course you wouldn't believe me, why would you? small problem, I haven't been completely honest with you whoever is reading. There was no video, it was just a story what I read. A story very similar to this with some differences and maybe with a better narration.

I'm certain you guys like a story that gives you a good scare, maybe that's why you started reading mine, right?

 Now that you've heard my little story you will share the same fate that I'm destined to. I know it is cruel and unfair, but it has to be done this way, I just want to give you a bit of a relief, it will be me that will show up at your screen at night. 

I know this is very unfair for you so I will try to not make you suffer that much but I make no promises. After all, I've never killed anyone, and I don't know the most practical way to do it. But then again, you like to be spooked yeah? I'm not going to ask you to share this story with anyone because,

 **nothing will be able to save you from me. See you tonight.**
