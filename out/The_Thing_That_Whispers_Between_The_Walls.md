I’ve always been a bit of a loner. I prefer the company of screens and video games to people, and as you might have guessed by now, I’ve never been one for small talk. So when my estranged grandmother died and left me her old house, I wasn’t sure what to do. I loved my grandma when I was a child, but years pass by and that familial relationship just wasn’t the same anymore. I didn’t talk to her as much or even gave her the attention she deserved from me. 

  
The house was in a remote area, and it had been empty for years. The furniture was covered in dust, and the walls were peeling. But despite rickety floor boards that made a noise every single step you took, and the cobwebbed corners of the lead peeled cracked walls. There was something about the house that drew me in.

  
I spent more and more time there, cleaning it and fixing it up. As I worked, I noticed strange things. The wind would whisper my name, carrying it from window to window, and I could hear footsteps in the attic when no one was there and when I say that no one was there; No one was there. I had dreams of this house of me being trapped inside, begging and shouting for help in a small little room that had no door or windows. I felt tired all the time because these nightmares never stopped, nor did they ever let up.  

  
I tried to tell myself that it was all in my head, that I was being paranoid about the house and moving in was just taking a toll on my psyche. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong and something dreadful was always waiting for me around the corner. I thought about the possibility of the house being haunted, but I didn't care. I’ve been alone for most of my life. Why should this thought bother me? I wondered, why now? 

  
One night, I woke up to find a shadowy figure standing in the doorway of my bedroom. It had the shape of a woman, and she was wearing a long, white dress. Her eyes were empty, and her skin was pale. My body froze because of what my eyes had seen. The hairs on my body stood up, and I felt a shiver run down my spine, knowing that I can no longer deny the thoughts in my head. I wanted to move, but the terror I felt would not let my body move a single inch.

  
The woman said nothing, but I knew that she’d been watching me work day in, day out. All I could do was to stare at her in my now alerted state. I could feel something primal was awakening within me, to protect and ready me from the danger I see. However, it turned its head towards the hallway and in seconds it floated towards the long dark hallway that I knew was outside of my bedroom. I was relieved.

  
I never saw the woman again, but I could still hear her whispers in the wind. I knew she was still there, waiting for me to make a move. She would let me catch glimpses of her long white dress in certain days in certain rooms just floating from room to room. During nights, she would peek into my bedroom, showing me her eyeless, pale face devoid of any other features. I always hated those nights, knowing I was being watched by this… Freak. 

  
I felt like I was going crazy. I couldn’t sleep and was always on edge. I knew I had to get out of the house, but I was afraid to leave. Not knowing what she would do if I ever left had me terrified. But I knew things just couldn’t be this way forever; I had to leave, or I’d be damned to look at that thing forever.

  
One day, I finally worked up the courage to leave. I packed my things and drove away, never looking back. I thought I was finally free, but I was wrong. The woman’s whispers followed me everywhere I went. I couldn’t escape her. I tried to block her out, but her whisper took over. It was overwhelming me and my daily life.

  
I eventually went to see a therapist, but they couldn’t help me. They said that I was just imagining things. But I knew I wasn’t. I’m still haunted by the woman’s whispers. I know that she’s still out there, waiting for me. I don’t know what she wants, but I’m afraid to find out.

  
I’ve tried to move on with my life, but it’s hard. I’m always looking over my shoulder, afraid that she’s coming back.

  
I know that I’ll never be able to forget her. She’s a part of me now, whether or not I liked it.

  
I’m not sure what the future holds, but I know that I’ll never be the same. I’ve been changed by the woman in the white dress, and I’ll never be able to go back to the way things were before.
