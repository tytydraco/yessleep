Before I begin I just want to say sorry, you may not understand now but you will.. I am so so sorry.
Please only read this if you want to, you must accept that YOU CHOSE TO, I am not responsible for what happens next.


To give everyone some backstory.. me and my partner have always been spiritual in a sense we have been together for five years now and I come from a Jamaican background and he comes from a Congolese background so we have a great mix going on lol, folklores & superstitions are something that run in both of our cultures so we often find ourselves talking about or comparing stories that have similarities but about a month ago now we did something really terrible and we don’t know what to do anymore it’s completely spiralled out of control. 


I paint a lot, traditional mostly but my partner recently brought me an iPad as a late birthday gift. We got talking one evening about a particular horrendous nightmare I had not long ago and how the creature I saw had been plaguing my mind, my partner thought I should draw it maybe it would help me stop thinking about it so much so I did, I. Drew. It. That was my first mistake I think and since the last stroke of my goddamn Apple Pencil hit the screen things have gotten progressively worse. I obviously showed my partner once I had finished the drawing and he went quite pale, it was and still is terrifying, perhaps it was to take the edge off of it but he made a joke about giving him a Congolese name that sounded silly and at first we laughed ‘flangè michel’ pretty popular to name your son flangè in Congo apparently.. I found it hilarious nonetheless and we moved on. What I didn’t realise was by putting a name to it we had started to make him real, he was no longer a figure of my darkest nightmares he was now materialised. 

Maybe 2 days after we named him while I was washing the dishes his name came back to me and I’m not someone easily scared but the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I ripped my hands from the sink my heart pounding into my ribcage, he was there.. I could feel it. Too scared to even comprehend what I was feeling I told Chris and he brushed it off, he hadn’t told me but I’d later come to find out he’d felt him too that same night but while he was at work alone in the middle of the early hours . 

For weeks his name would pop up in my mind and at one point I really believed that I was losing my mind I’d just had enough of being scared in my own home, I would feel eyes on me even though I was alone, I’d hear metal pipes clanking but it was impossible ? We live in a one bedroom maisonette with a small boiler room and it definitely wasn’t my neighbour as she sleeps through the day due to working the night shift like my partner. 
It became so hard to bear that the only thing I thought I could do to put my mind at rest was finish making him real at-least then I’d know this was all ridiculous and I needed to start taking my meds again. I spent DAYS writing his story, finalising the image of him and when I finally felt done a sense of relief washed over me I slept properly for the first time in weeks in-fact my entire mood just felt better. 
Unfortunately I learnt the hard way of what my actions can cause because not even a week later I saw him, not in my nightmares oh no. I saw him in the real, so real it brought me to my knees, my entire body gave up for a moment I genuinely thought I was in hell and I still think I am none of it matters now anyway because if I don’t fulfil my promise to it he’s going to come for me. I’ve spent my entire life being kind, careful and trying to help people and I know that means nothing now because of what I’m about to do. I’m sorry.

He starts off as a nightmare, he hides in your darkness until you notice him and when you do he will bend you to his will. He preys on your thoughts for those are what make him real. Close every door when you enter a room for he is always behind you. Metal pipes and shackles bind him to your memory his goal is to have a new family and if you invite him in he will not leave, do not think about him do not say his name do not let him in. 
If you find it’s too late for you which it probably is if you chose to read this you must pass him on to someone else, I am not a saint I am only human and I gave you a choice on wether to read his story, perhaps he will spare me, he’s yours now please forgive me. Good luck.
