I'm sure most of us have similar aims in life... Get a good education, get a decent paying job to clear student loans, settle down in life, etc. but sometimes things just don't work out the way you want them to and you need to do what you have to do in order to survive. Just to be discrete let's call me Daniel, I came to the city from a small town in search of a job after freshly graduating, and due to the current economic situation all I got were dead ends in search of a job. I recently came across a job advertisement in a newspaper to work as night shift security staff/caretaker of a Temple, and they were offering a salary that would not only help me pay off my debts, but enough to probably help settle me down for the remainder of my life. God, how I wish I would've known how short my life would be after applying for this job...

Running low on food, supplies and money really takes a toll on you and desperate times like these are where you tend to make the worst decisions, much like I did... But hey, no risk no reward right?

Anyways, I picked up the newspaper, quickly rushed home and just stared at the ad in disbelief, I thought to myself "Who would pay security staff such huge sums of money?". At about 6:00pm I sent through an application e-mail with my CV attached and just prayed that the spot was still open. To kill time and anxiety I decided to make myself some dinner... I was just about done and ready to eat when I heard the familiar notification ringtone coming from my phone, putting everything aside I rushed to see an e-mail from "The Temple". I was elated to see that my job was set in stone once I signed the contract, I skipped through the most parts and digitally signed the contract and quickly sent it back in absolute excitement. This is the reply I got from them:

"Hello! We are glad to tell you that your application for position as security staff/caretaker has been accepted at The Temple! Your shift begins at exactly 10:00pm and ends at 6:00am, please do not be late and for the sake of your own safety do not be more than 15 minutes early. Your signed contract is attached within this e-mail and allow us to reiterate that you are not permitted to quit his job until this contract expires for the safety of yourself and those around you.

A brief overview of the temple and your duties is provided below:

This is not the kind of temple you think you know. Certain occurrences here cannot be explained, and you will do yourself no favours by trying to puzzle them out. In your Caretaker’s Quarters you will find a sealed envelope on the table containing a short list of instructions. They are not suggestions. Read them in the room, return them to the envelope, and do not remove them from the premises. A telephone is provided in your Caretaker’s Quarters; it will work when it needs to. Do not test it. Follow the instructions exactly, arrive and leave only at the times you are told, and do not treat this posting as temporary. We are not asking for a favour; we are asking for your compliance."

I leaned back in my chair, staring at the glow of my laptop screen long after I’d finished reading. The words were blunt, but it wasn’t the salary that stuck with me. It was the way the message was written, like I’d just signed something far more serious than a work contract.

"Do not be more than 15 minutes early."

"You are not permitted to quit."

"We are asking for your compliance."

No job offer should sound like that.

I told myself it was nothing, just heavy-handed language meant to scare off people who weren’t serious. But the more I tried to brush it off, the more it circled back. Every time I thought about the money, my mind snapped to those words. Every time I tried to reassure myself, the unease dug in deeper. I got up, wandered my tiny apartment, picked at my dinner until it went cold. I even tried to read, anything to quiet the voice in my head, but I kept glancing at the clock, counting down the hours until ten. It felt like I’d already been claimed by the place, like the contract was more binding than I’d realized. The strangest part was the silence. My apartment was usually alive with traffic noise and the hum of the city outside, but that night it felt muted, like the world had stepped back and was watching to see what I would do next. And deep down, though I hated myself for admitting it, part of me already knew: whatever waited for me at that temple wasn’t going to let me walk away.

By the time the clock crawled past eight, I couldn’t sit still anymore. I grabbed my jacket, stuffed my wallet into my pocket, and tried not to think about how light it felt. My car had been sitting dead in the lot for weeks, another problem I couldn’t afford to fix, so the bus was my only option. The temple was far across the city, past the parts I usually avoided after dark. The ride felt endless. The bus groaned through narrow streets, stopping at corners where nobody waited and nobody got on. The driver kept his eyes straight ahead, never once glancing at me in the rearview. I wasn’t alone, though. A few passengers sat scattered in the shadows — a man in a tattered coat staring out the window as if something was following him, a young woman clutching a bag to her chest like it was the only thing keeping her safe, and an old woman hunched low with her eyes fixed firmly on the floor. The fluorescent lights buzzed and flickered overhead, painting everything in pale, sickly flashes. With every stop, the bus grew emptier until, eventually, it was just me and the old woman. She never looked up. Not once.

I kept checking the time on my phone, making sure I wouldn’t be too early, wouldn’t be too late. The warning from the email pressed at the back of my mind with every tick of the clock. When the bus finally hissed to a halt at my stop, I stepped off into an empty street that felt like it had been waiting just for me. The night air was colder here, sharper somehow. The bus pulled away with a groan, leaving me on a street that felt abandoned. Streetlamps lined the road, but the farther I walked the weaker they burned, each one buzzing faintly before giving out, leaving stretches of darkness between me and the next pool of light.

The temple revealed itself slowly, as though it didn’t want to be seen all at once. At first it looked like nothing more than a black wall stretching across the block. But as I drew closer, the outline of the gate came into focus. Massive wooden doors bound in iron, scarred and ancient. They looked like they hadn’t been opened in centuries, and yet I couldn’t shake the feeling they’d been waiting for me. I pulled out my phone. 9:47pm. Not too early, not late. Perfect. I held onto the screen longer than I needed to, the glow on my face the only proof the world outside this place still existed. Still, I lingered across the street, staring at the gate like it might move on its own. The surrounding buildings were lifeless... Shuttered shops, crumbling apartments, every window black. It didn’t feel deserted so much as avoided, like the whole street had agreed to pretend the temple wasn’t there.

When the minute hand ticked closer to 9:50pm, I forced myself forward. The stone steps leading up to the gate were slick with damp, cold beneath my shoes. I reached out, but before my hand could touch the wood, the doors shuddered and cracked open on their own, just wide enough to let me slip inside. And that was the moment I realized: I hadn’t knocked. Inside, the air was heavier, damp with the smell of stone and something faintly metallic. A narrow path stretched forward, lit by lanterns that flickered like they were struggling to stay alive. To the right, half-swallowed by ivy, I noticed a rusted sign nailed crookedly into the wall. The paint had long since faded, but squinting under the lantern light I could just make out the words: **Caretaker’s Quarters →**. The arrow pointed down a darker passage, the kind that instinct tells you not to follow.

I pulled out my phone. 9:56pm. That’s when I saw it. Something, a figure, moved at the edge of the courtyard, between two pools of lantern light. It was there for the briefest moment, tall and still, and then gone when I blinked, as if it had melted back into the dark. My breath caught in my throat. I thought about the gate. How it had swung open on its own, just wide enough for me to step inside. I’d tried to convince myself it was the wind, or some trick of the old hinges. But the longer I stood here, the harder it was to believe that. Doors don’t open themselves. Not like that. Not for me. I didn’t wait to see if the shadow came back. I hurried down the passage the sign pointed to, my footsteps echoing too loud against the stone.

The Caretaker’s Quarters waited at the end, a wooden door set into the wall, its handle cold against my hand. I slipped inside and, without hesitation, turned the lock. A heavy deadbolt slid into place with a metallic thud that echoed in the small room. For a moment, the sound was almost comforting, like I’d managed to put something between myself and whatever might still be moving in the courtyard. The quarters were sparse, but not empty. A narrow bed was pushed up against the wall, sheets folded too neatly, as though no one had dared disturb them in a long while. Beside it sat a small table where a single lamp glowed weakly, throwing pale light across the room. Against the far wall stood a dusty bookshelf, its contents warped and water-stained. Scripture, ledgers, and a few books so old their spines had flaked to nothing. A cracked mirror hung above a washbasin, and next to the bed sat a red telephone. Its cord trailed into the floorboards but, at a glance, didn’t seem to be connected to anything at all. By the corner, a small wooden wardrobe leaned on crooked legs. Its door stood ajar just enough for me to see what hung inside: a folded uniform, black and pressed, waiting for me like it had already been chosen. And in the center of the room, on a plain wooden table under the glow of the lamp, sat the only thing that looked untouched by time: a sealed envelope.

I pulled out the chair and sat at the table, the legs scraping across the floor in the silence. The envelope was right there, its edges crisp, its seal unbroken. For a long while I just stared at it. My hands rested on the table, but I didn’t reach. The room felt smaller with every second, the lamp buzzing faintly overhead, shadows stretching along the walls. My eyes drifted to the wardrobe in the corner, the black uniform still hanging inside, waiting like it already knew my size. Then to the telephone by the bed, its cord disappearing into the floorboards, not connected to anything I could see. What use was a phone that wasn’t plugged into the world? The envelope sat patient, like it had all the time in the world. I didn’t. Finally, with my pulse hammering in my ears, I slid it closer. The paper was heavier than it looked, the kind that felt too deliberate, too permanent. I ran a thumb across the seal, hesitated one last time… and tore it open. Inside was a single sheet of paper. At the top, written in block letters, was one word: **RULES**

They read:

1. Enter the grounds between 9:45 PM and 9:59 PM. If you arrive earlier, wait outside. If the main gate opens for you, do not step through until the time is right.

2. Go straight to the Caretaker’s Quarters. Lock the door and throw the deadbolt.

3. Open the wardrobe. There must be one black uniform with your name stitched on the chest. Wear only the uniform with your name.

3.1. If there are two uniforms, the extra will have no nametag. Do not touch it.

3.2. If your uniform is missing or the name is wrong, do not patrol. Sit on the bed, keep the lamp lit, and wait.

4. Inside the breast pocket of your uniform you will find a wristwatch. Trust the time this watch shows you, and nothing else. Do not rely on your phone, wall clocks, or the bell. The temple distorts ordinary time; the watch does not.

5. By 10:05 PM, lock the main gate from the inside. If you hear knocking at the gate, do not answer. It will not stop, but it cannot enter unless you allow it.

6. Patrol the grounds every hour. If you see another caretaker on patrol, do not speak or fall in step. Step aside and bow your head until they pass.

7. If you see a patrol of monks carrying lanterns, stand perfectly still and bow. Do not raise your head until their light has passed. Respect prevents attention.

8. Keep every lantern in the prayer hall burning. If a lantern goes out twice, leave it; the space it lit is no longer yours.

9. The paintings in the eastern corridor have eyes painted into them as part of an old warding. Do not stare. If, when you glance away, you find any painting’s gaze has shifted, bow once and back out of the corridor without stopping.

10. Do not consume food or drink on temple grounds after midnight. The hungry notice.

11. Do not fall asleep during your shift. If you feel yourself drifting, stand and walk until it passes. The temple prefers the vigilant, and those who sleep here are not always the ones who wake.

12. If you find a black candle burning, snuff it with the brass cap beneath the idol. Do not touch the wax. If black wax touches your skin, leave the temple before it drips again and do not return that night.

13. Do not touch offerings in the bowls. If the offerings move on their own, avert your eyes and leave the room at once.

14. There are silver coins kept in the drawer beneath the table, always take them with you on your patrols. If you find a pedestal empty where an idol should stand, place three silver coins on the bare stone, bow twice, and leave. Do not search for the missing idol.

15. If an idol faces you rather than the altar, keep your eyes low and leave slowly.

16. If the missing idol appears in a hallway or corner, do not acknowledge it. Exit walking backward until you are out of its sight.

17. You may hear footsteps following your patrol. They will stop when you stop. Do not turn around. Continue walking; they will continue behind you.

18. If the bells under the eaves ring at a moment your watch does not register, freeze with your head bowed. Do not move until the bells are silent.

19. If you see a dog during your patrol, be sure to pet it, it is friendly.

20. If you see a crow perched on an idol, you must not enter the hall.

21. There is an incense burner in your quarters. If the incense in your room smells foul or turns sour, leave the temple and come back the next night.

22. Do not look into the mirror in your quarters after 2:00AM.

23. At 3:33 AM, the temple bell will toll once. Do not look at the bell tower. If it tolls twice, hide under the bed and cover your ears until the incense turns sour, then sweet. This is the only exception to rule 21.

24. If a voice calls your name from outside your quarters, do not answer. It is not human.

25. If there is knocking at your quarters before 4:00 AM, ignore it. If the knocking is past 4:00 AM, go close to the door and say "He is in the courtyard".

26. If your shadow points the wrong way, or lags behind, do not pass through the next doorway until it aligns with the lantern light again.

27. The red telephone in your quarters is for emergencies only. Dial 0 in an extreme case only.

28. If the red telephone rings before 4:00 AM, do not answer. Sit silently until it stops.

29. If the telephone rings after 4:00 AM while the lamp on your table burns steady, pick up the receiver and say: “Present. One.” Hang up immediately. Do not speak further.

30. If the lamp is flickering when the phone rings, do not answer. Wait for the lamp to steady.

31. If you hear your own voice on the line, replace the receiver and do not touch the phone again until dawn.

32. In the final hour before sunrise, you may sense someone standing behind you. They will whisper your name. Do not turn. Keep facing forward until the watch reads sunrise.

33. At sunrise remove your uniform and hang it in the wardrobe. Leave the envelope sealed on the table exactly as you found it. Unlock the main gate and step outside. Do not look back.

Your pay for the night will be delivered to your home.

My eyes scanned the final line again and again. Do not look back.  I leaned back in the chair, the paper trembling in my hands. It wasn’t the length of the rules that unsettled me. It was how specific they were. Too specific. They didn’t read like guidelines for a job, they read like the diary of someone who had survived, barely, long enough to write them down.

The uniform in the wardrobe suddenly felt less like clothing and more like a shroud. My fingers brushed my own chest, where the stitched name would sit, marking me as property of this place. The detail about there being two uniforms wouldn’t leave me. What if I opened that door again and found another? What if it was already waiting? My eyes flicked toward the bed, toward the red telephone sitting next to it. I’d thought earlier it looked useless, disconnected. Now I wasn’t so sure. The rules gave it purpose, but not a comforting one. I imagined the sound of it ringing in the dark, my own voice bleeding from the receiver. I didn’t know if I would even have the strength not to answer. The incense burner by the wall gave off the faintest curl of smoke, barely visible in the lamplight. Sweet, for now. But the line about it turning sour clung to me, thick in my throat. And the coins... The three silver coins neatly stacked in the drawer under the table. I hadn’t touched them, but I could feel their weight from here. Like they were already promised. Like I was just waiting to find out what would come to collect.

I told myself it was just superstition. Just stories made to scare caretakers straight. But even as the thought crossed my mind, I remembered whispers I’d heard in the city. Stray mentions on the bus, quiet gossip in corner shops — about people who had taken “easy” jobs and never come back. Young men who laughed at rules written down in dusty envelopes, and then vanished without a trace. No bodies. No explanations. Just gone. And as the silence pressed against the walls and the lamp buzzed overhead, I realized something I didn’t want to admit. This wasn’t a contract.  It was a sentence.

I sat there for longer than I should’ve, the rules folded neatly back into the envelope but burned into my mind. The lamp hummed, the incense curled, and my heartbeat felt louder than both. Eventually, the watch on the table ticked toward ten, and I knew there was no more delaying. The wardrobe door creaked when I pulled it open revealing one uniform with my name stitched into it. The uniform hung perfectly pressed, the black fabric stiff like it had never been worn, or had been worn by someone who never made it back to take it off. I slid it on anyway, the air cold against my skin as if the cloth had been waiting for me. The fit was exact. Too exact. When I buttoned the breast pocket, my fingers brushed against something metallic. I pulled out the wristwatch. Heavy. Old. The face ticked steady, clear as day. 9:58. My phone in my pocket buzzed once as the time clicked over, but when I checked it, the screen read 9:52pm. My throat tightened. The rules had been right. I strapped the watch on, fastened the last button, and caught my reflection in the mirror. For a heartbeat, it looked like the uniform fit someone else. The thought of Rule 21 flashed through my mind, and I tore my eyes away before I could test it. I reached for the coins in the drawer, three small silver pieces worn smooth with age. They clinked together softly as I slipped them into my pocket. Insurance, I told myself. Payment, another voice whispered.

The deadbolt thudded as I slid it back. The door groaned open into the corridor, the lanterns flickering as though stirred by my movement. Cold air rushed in, carrying the faint echo of stone and water. The courtyard was darker than before. The lanterns lining the path sputtered, fighting to hold on. Beyond them, the prayer hall loomed, its roof vanishing into shadows. I glanced at the watch. 10:03. Time to lock the gate. My feet carried me down the stone steps, every sound magnified in the emptiness. The main doors of the gate waited ahead, their iron hinges groaning like a warning. As I slid the bolt into place, metal scraping against metal, something shifted behind me. A soft sound. Footsteps? I froze, the iron lock half-turned in my hand. Then silence. Rule 17 burned in my head. Do not turn around. I forced the lock shut and pulled my hand back, every muscle screaming at me to look. But I didn’t. Not until the watch ticked again, steady, reminding me what I had to do.

The first patrol had begun.
