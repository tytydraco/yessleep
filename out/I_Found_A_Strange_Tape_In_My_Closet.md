Many years ago, I used to work as a medical scribe. If you've ever seen an old TV show or a movie where a doctor, speaking into a cassette tape, well basically what would happen was doctors would speak their notes onto cassette tapes. They would leave them and I would write them out in a way that was actually legible and didn't look like a bunch of crayon scribbles in their notes. Granted, nowadays, they have voice-to-speech software for that, so I would be out of a job if I hadn't already retired before technology could take over. Of course, medical scribes still do exist- but their work is vastly different from what mine was.

I was cleaning out my closet one day looking for... gods, I can't even remember what it was now with all that's been going on. But, I found a cassette tape nestled away in the corner. It surprised me because I did not have a habit of collecting them or anything- and I sure didn't keep any with me when I retired given they belonged to the hospital.

I examined the cassette. It had a strange word written on its side.It was a word though that I found very hard to pronounce. But I mouthed it out to myself, trying to figure out what it could mean. I even tried Googling it on my phone and found no response with the search engine assuming that I had made a typo. It sounded vaguely... German to me though. Or perhaps it was Russian?

After some contemplation, I decided to go get my old tape recorder, which still worked and so I put the cassette in it and pressed 'play'.

A male voice began speaking out.

*Patient's name, \[REDACTED\] , a 24 year old female patient with no significant past medical history presented from home with the chief complaint of auditory and visual hallucinations which started two weeks ago.*

*The patient is a waitress by profession. And as per her, these symptoms started after she bought a book at a local garage sale.*

*Inscribed within it were several horror stories, one of which described a 'monster' or as she said a 'demon' that was summoned by speaking its name which is BZZT* \[nothing but static was heard here\].

*She says that soon afterwards she started seeing* *a strange shadow standing behind her whenever she looked in the mirror.*

*Strange whispers would call out to her in the middle of the night.*

*Over time these symptoms progressed. The shadow, which was initially just a dark figure became more formed and more real every single day. The whispers rather than being incomprehensible started making sense to her.*

*They spoke, according to her, 'some of the most vile, horrible things that she had ever heard.'*

*She refuses to say anything about them or to describe the entity in any way.*

*She presented to the ER because she felt she was going crazy and had contemplated throwing herself in front of a bus.*

*She has never had any symptoms like this before. There is no family history of psychiatric illness as per her, and no past surgical history on file.*

*She was agitated in the ER and was given a dose of haloperidol. She has calmed down somewhat but still claims hearing the voices. And she has been placed on one-to-one suicide watch.*

I should not have had something like this. It was patient information and was HIPPA protected, so I was not allowed to take any of the tapes back home with me. 

Just as I thought that was it. The voice again playing again.

Now, up until now, the voiceover had been fairly professional. If I guess that's the right word to describe it. There was no panic in it. It was described in a neutral, flat tone. The next part. However, was sounded extremely

*Staredt the patient on Seroquel for now, if It shows no improvement, we'll consider olanzapine.*

There was another pause after this.

*Oh God. I don't even know why I'm recording this on this, but...*

*...something strange happened last night. I was brushing my teeth when I saw something behind me.*

*A shadowy figure in the mirror.*

*And initially, I thought this was just my mind playing tricks on me after a very long shift, but this morning, I saw it again.* 

A pause. 

*It's been two days and day four since I've seen the patient \[REDACTED\]. And, I feel like her story has gotten to me, somehow.*

*Well, I can't really allow myself to indulge in her delusions.*

There was another pause before the voice started again. This time sounding far worse.

*I don't know how to describe it. It's- It's- It's not fake? What this girl was saying, it's not fake.*

*I can feel behind me. This monster BZZT it's speaking to me whenever I'm alone*.

*And it turns out she is not completely forthcoming with their symptoms. I feel extremely cold even with the heater turned on, I also feel an impending sense of doom.*

*And every time I try to close my eyes to get some sleep, I see the visage of the horrible thing with its many faces and countless eyes, I don't even wish to describe it.*

*I've signed off the case and handed it over to a colleague, but I feel like even the short vacation I've asked for may not help me.*

There's another pause at this point.

It's come back again. It's not getting better.

*I'm clearly having some kind of shared psychosis with this patient. Maybe it's just out of empathy or something of the sort, but I can't keep going on like this. I'm going to go to the ER myself to have myself admitted*

The tape ended there and there was nothing else on it.

I took it out and examined it again, wondering where it'd come from and why I had it after all these years, and lastly, what I should do with it. I didn't even know which hospital was from. I'd worked for several so I couldn't exactly return it but it was confidential information and I didn't want to land myself in trouble by keeping it.

And then again, there was that name.

That name on the tape.

I had already mouthed it out so I think you all can see where this is going.

And for the last three days, I've been seeing a dark shadow behind me in the mirror.

And the whispers... I thought it was just my tinnitus acting up, but they've gotten louder. And now, I can understand them.

And I don't want to understand them.

If there's anyone out there who has ever encountered something like this, I would like some help.

Because I'm terrified of what's going to happen to me. I couldn't exactly find out what happened to that patient and doctor, but I can't imagine it was good.
