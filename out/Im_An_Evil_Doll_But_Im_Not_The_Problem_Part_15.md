Did you miss last week? I’ve got you covered.

I can’t see them all clearly. It’s more of a mob, a swarm of toys turned into murder implements. Dead eyes focused on the girl and I.

Now, for the most part, I’d say to take any advice I’m giving with a grain of salt. At the end of the day, what do I know? But I would hope my opinion on evil toys is something you trust me on. 

There’s a difference between me and the encroaching mob. The way I look ( Even before being given my battle scars) I’m going to be honest, probably not something you’d buy your kid. 

The last time a ventriloquist’s doll looking like myself was on a toy shelf would have been the fifties. I’m the kind of thing that’s became more a symbol of eerie  than anything else. Up there with VHS tapes and CRT televisions. 

These things though, they’re , kid friendly? As ironic as that is. Of course they’re here to hurt us, but you wouldn’t be able to tell it by looking at them. 

This is usually where I’d joke about filing that away with all the other useless supernatural trivia I’ve learned but at this point but I think I’m starting to understand things. 

The way I see it, I was made a couple decades before these little guys. That tells me there is some difference, some change in how things are done between then and now. 

I’m in a panic, having to think on my feet. I try to drown out the girl behind me, focus on the task at hand. 

I won’t name them here, but someone last week said something in the comments about taking a page from Mike’s book. As the strangely photogenic mob gets closer, I figure it’s as good of an idea as any. 

The crowd is talking to each other. Their voices becoming an unintelligible, garbled, mess. I can understand bits and pieces, it must sound horrific to the child though. 

“36 against one, give or take? I’ve faced worse odds. “ I say, trying to emulate Leo and Mike as best I can. 

Judging by the sudden silence, the mob can understand me as well. All eyes are on yours truly.

“You assholes are going to find out  they don’t make things like they used to. “ I say, feeling like a little bit of a badass, if I don’t say so myself. 

In a flash I replace one hand with one of my blades. 

“You know what I hate?” I say starting to feel like I’m picking up steam, “Evil toys. Want to know why? The scary thing about an evil toy… shit that doesn’t really work. “

Something from the back laughs, an electronic, grating noise. 

I’m no Mike, or Leo, I try and salvage the situation, taking a sizeable chunk of doorframe out with my blade. 

“Anyone who wants the girl, is going to have to get through me. “ Is my best attempt. 

The crowd reacts almost as one, driving toward the door. My attempt at intimidation a miserable failure. 

I manage to slam it shut before any can get in, but already I hear the sounds of tiny hands, and whirring miniature machinery. 

I hold myself against the door, fear overwhelming any confidence I may have had.  If I move before the dresser gets placed in front of it, these things are getting in immediately. 

I’m hit in the head by something, a baseball I think. Then a book, then a snowglobe. 

I see the girl, panicked but determined. 

She looks thin, pale, angry and scared. Bright green eyes contrast with the evidence of torment. She can’t be more than ten. 

A jewelry box rattles the flesh inside of my head. I try to put up my hand in a ‘peace’ symbol.

“Well…” the girl seems to gather her courage, “ *fuck you too!* ” she says the vulgarity with the seriousness of a child using it for the first time before hitting me with a jar of nail polish. 

I look to my hand and remember my  missing finger. I’m frustrated, but I get where the kid is coming from.  She couldn’t have understood my sad battle rant ( sorry, by the way, I’ll up my game next time. ), and I just locked us in a room together and flipped her off. 

 It feels like the crowd outside hits the door as one. I stumble, but manage to hold the splintering door shut. 

I’m scared as hell, tired of playing this losing numbers game. Horrified of the concept of death at the end of a war of attrition. 

I point to the dresser, frantically. A television remote hits me in the stomach, but I see the girl look unsure. 

Outside the window I hear something being placed against the wall. Giggling and muttered threats. 

Her brother. 

And on top of all of this horror, all of this fear, is that darkness within me. 

It’s stronger now than it has been, a pull to do evil. More than just an intrusive series of thoughts at the back of my mind, it worms its way through my being like a parasite. 

Innocence, right in front of me. Defenseless, blameless, pure. It would be so easy to…

I slam my head against the door, letting the pain of my rattled skull bring my focus back. 

The crowd works together, I start moving forward, centimeter by centimeter. 

The girl is scared, confused, and minutes away from death either way. She cautiously makes her way over, bending low and shoving the dresser. 

It moves slower than the door, the ten year old pushing herself to her limit just to make it budge. 

I pull with her and the weighty piece of furniture is in place before the mob makes it’s way in. 

I see what I’m looking for. Now, why on earth a kid needs a cell, I don’t know, but there it sat on a half-sized, pink desk. 

I point to it, she turns it on, and sets it on the floor, not willing to get close enough to me to hand it off. 

As you’d expect, the service itself was interrupted.  

Thankfully I found something that could help. Do I wish it wasn’t the “Magic Horsey Voice App.” ? Sure, but at this point, any port in a storm. 

“I’m not with them, I want to help.” I type, the phone rendering it in a voice that would be downright hilarious in other circumstances, “What happened?”

The girl still looks unsure, but as a tiny drill pierces through the door, she starts to talk. 

“I’m Alex, and I don’t know. A while ago things started getting, scary. Noises outside, lights flickering, ghost kind of stuff. 

Then Steve, he’s my brother, started acting weird. Mom and dad didn’t think it was anything but... “  She starts to shudder and cry, “He went crazy, he hurt them, bad. Then the man in the attic came with the toys.”

Seems about right given how far the Bishop is willing to go. 

I listen to her story, trying to parse some way out of this situation. But I can’t take my mind off of the potential for violence. It feels like I can physically smell it at this point. A cloud of barbeque smoke wafting by a starving man. 

I’ve taken two steps toward her, blade out before I stop myself. 

I put the weapon away, the temptation is too much. 

But other than the worst thing possible, what can I do? I’m not Mike or Leo, I’m certainly not Kaz or Hyve. I’m just, a fucking doll. An Evil one at that.

I try to type something, a message of reassurance, but the urge to do violence is stifling. I open my head, letting the fresh air wash over my bare flesh. I don’t exactly breathe, but things  feel less stifling all of the sudden. 

The child is shocked, but curious at the same time. 

I let my senses drift, unfettered by the dampening of the magic infused head. 

It happens slowly, but I see something within Alex. A glow, at first I have no idea what it is, but on an instinctual level I understand. 

I’m seeing a soul, or at least as much as my creator could let me see. 

This is the thing that is causing me so much strife. This is the beacon to those dark parts of me. 

I tear my sight away from her, looking toward the door the dark thoughts becoming too much to handle.  

Then I see something that makes so many things make sense. 

It looks like a field of stars. The same kind of pure glow coming from within Alex. 

The toys, the mob, each has a portion of a child’s soul bound within. It wasn’t the tiny morsel in front of me that was setting me off, it was the buffet behind the door. 

And this is where I understand, my creator had to have seen this coming. What I’m for, my real purpose, isn’t some slow burn revenge story. It isn’t the tale of some half-assed necromancer flinging a toy at the problem. 

Out of all the powers we’ve seen, the one that even Pi seemed impressed by was foresight. Which I’m positive my creator had in spades. 

See, I’m sure all of you would agree, the amount of spooky things that started off as kids are pretty huge. By the time you’ve finished reading this sentence I guarantee you’ve thought of 4 separate examples. 

My cover was a child killer. A nasty little device meant to do one of the worst things imaginable. But my purpose, as I see the dozens of tiny fractions of soul, is clear. 

I’m what does the dirty work. I was made to put an end to things others might not be able to without destroying themselves mentally. 

Leo and Mike would walk through the mob behind the door. But what happens to their minds when they understand they snuffed out the eternal essence of these tortured victims of necromancy? I like those guys, but putting more stress on structures that aren’t up to code in the first place isn’t a good idea. 

I’ve dubbed my feelings of evil and violence ‘The Monster’, and you’ve seen a couple of times where I’ve given into it. But I’ve never really let it take the wheel, never really listened to it. It’s always been leashed, tempered. 

Now I get that. 

Those things behind the door, they have one thought on their mind, and it’s doing exactly what they are doing right now. No shame, no moral conundrum. Just the tortured remnants of long dead children getting comfort in the only way they can. 

 If I was like that, I’d be useless. Just another pipe-bomb in some evil arsenal. 

But everything has a time and place, and right now is the time to let the monster have its say. 

“Scream, as long and as loud as you can. “ I type on the phone before putting it down. 

Alex obliges, being the kind of loud only a ten year old with nothing to lose can be. 

She covers the sound of me cutting through the drywall between the closet and living-room. As the chalky material falls, my body tingles with anticipation. 

Things are so clear, so simple. Instinct, and forbidden knowledge run through my mind. 

I move through shadows, crawling up the wall with ease. I see the crowd, each toy pigeonholed into a specific task. Given some kind of implement of torture or destruction hidden within their cheap plastic forms. 

They don’t see me, they don’t hear me, they’re focused on nothing but Alex. 

I’ve wondered why my creator didn’t give me more weaponry, make me more like the proxy. But as I lean into what I’m meant to do, embrace that dark side of me, it makes sense. 

I’m not like them, I’m flexible, I can adapt, I can think. The world is my weapon. 

I cut a length of cord from the blinds as I silently crawl by, looking into the crowd for my first chance to test my theory. 

I’m no longer in pristine condition but I manage to crawl along the ceiling just fine, staying out of sight. 

Surprise makes up for a lack of speed. I take a member of the crowd unaware, a generic G.I Joe, or Action Man type.

The cord plucks him from the ground and I drag him into the master bedroom. 

The only reaction from the crowd is a brief look and psychotic sounding laughter. Their minds incapable of self preservation or empathy. 

It tries to fight, but for once, I’m not the smallest one in the room. I drag it by one leg, I’m not looking to fight a damn thing, I’m looking to commit murder. 

So many choices, but one stands out to me.

A flat iron. 

The toy feels no pain as I immobilize it. Cheap ball joints shattering easily. 

I plug the iron in, setting the possessed toy between the rapidly heating elements. 

After a few moments it begins to smoke and bubble. Not hot enough to ignite, but  becoming soft and pliable. 

A look of understanding in the eyes of the toy for a brief second. 

The more I go with things the more I understand, the more secrets the monster has to tell. 

These things, they weren’t crafted like myself. They’re not much more than a bit of sentience crudely spliced into some plastic. 

What I need to do is separate one from the other. 

Leo would have had some kind of zinger. Mike probably would have made things look like he did them with his mind or something. 

Fights are public, murder is done in the shadows. 

I stomp the elements, the nearly liquid toy spraying into long thin streams of plastic that cool in mid air surrounding a central smoking mass. 

The noise it makes cracks window panes. A scream of anguish as the simple energies animating it are pushed beyond their capability. 

Debate in the comments all you want about what I do next. But realize you’re not going to change my mind. I get what I am, what I’m made to do and how I work. 

I take what’s left after the magic is strained beyond what it can do. The scrap of soul hits me like a shot of  adrenaline with a coke chaser. 

Call it cruel if you want, but there’s an alive child about one home depot special door away from death. I’m doing what I’m made to do. 

The crowd sees the aftermath, something large, purple and simian looking breaks off, loping toward me. 

It speaks madness, and gets no reply. I run toward the thing, turning at the last moment, and skittering into a kitchen cabinet. 

As the infernal furnace inside of me burns through the piece of soul I consumed I smell the flesh inside of the ape-like toy. This one is more meat than Muppet. 

The bottle of olive oil I throw explodes on impact with the floor. The ape-like toy makes horrific noises in response. Thinking this a missed attack.

The thick, leather pads of it’s feet make short work  of field of broken glass. 

They’re not as good at keeping the creature upright though. 

 I’m guessing it weighs around twenty pounds. The meat stuffed animal is around my size, and could probably give me a run for my money in a fair fight, stolen soul or not. 

Glad I’m not fighting. 

Glass pierces the cheap fur, slicing into an eclectic combination of skull, hands and feet underneath. 

No elegance went into the thing’s making. It’s the byproduct of some lunatic’s sick attentions. Held together by trauma and the magical equivalent of duct tape. 

Tendons are severed, long dead muscles torn. 

The more the creature tries to rise, the more of itself it destroys. Each fall onto the oil slicked ground driving more glass deeper into it. 

I leap from the cabinet, slamming into the thing. Bones shatter, and the both of us slide into the livingroom. 

Teeth shatter as it tries to bite me. The ape-like toy enraged at it’s failing limbs. 

I could end things with a stomp, or if I was feeling merciful, a single stab. But the monster doesn’t do things that way. 

I crawl up an entertainment unit, the ape-like thing dragging itself toward me by it’s chin. 

It’s a tasteful, white porcelain urn. The name emblazoned on it “Sparkle” makes me assume it was for a pet. 

I shatter the top, creating a jagged, almost saw like blade of the opening. 

I taunt the simian toy, tilting a stream of ash down on it as it tries in vain to drag it’s mutilated body up the entertainment unit. 

It's like I can see how the urn will fall, every tilt, every spin. I pick my moment and push it from the shelf. 

It lands in a spray of ash and shattering porcelain. 

The first couple of inches of the opening remain, embedded in the hardwood floor . On the outside was the creature’s body, still twitching. Looking up at me, from the inside of the jagged porcelain shards was the thing’s head. 

I take the mangled, dripping head, ducking low and sneaking back into the room. Feeling it’s scraps of soul begin to course through me. 

A memory, strong enough to border on hallucination. 

Grey walls, bars, orange jumpsuits. Was I in prison?

I’m talking to someone, white guy, bald head, lots of tattoos. He seems worried. 

I point under the bed, the man retrieves something, handing it to me. 

I inspect the object, knowing what it is. As I see the prison lighter, I notice I’m not wearing a jumpsuit. Must have been a guard. 

I stumble into the room, dropping the head. The memory breaking me from reality for a second. 

Alex is still screaming, god bless her heart. 

Finally doing what I was made to has been fun, but if I keep going at this rate, these things will be in here, missing members or no. 

I motion for the girl to get to the far wall, realizing my glimpse into my past, wasn’t random. The idea it puts into my head satisfies the monster.

(Do I have to tell you all not to make a prison lighter at home? I shouldn’t , but I will. Don’t do it.)

The door is held together by hope and the dresser as I cut the cord from a gaudy sparkle encrusted lamp, then separate the leads. One pencil later, I have the single most dangerous, inefficient way to probably start a fire possible. 

Waterbottle, handfull of bottles of dollar store kids perfume, and some crayons thrown in for good measure. 

I know I have to let them get in on their own, if the door suddenly opens, the base cunning left in their almost insect-like minds will sense something. 

I wait, and I watch, one hand holding the plug an inch or so away from a wall socket. 

They burst through, tearing back pieces of the door. The weight of the crowd pushes the dresser away, the toys crawling over each other in their zeal to get Alex. 

I plug the cord in, in an instant the graphite in the pencil glows red, after a second, a piece of wood sparks from the pencil. Then all hell breaks loose. 

It’s not an explosion, that takes a lot more chemistry knowledge that I have. But it’s an extremely vigorous reaction.  

Plastic, alcohol and wax turn to liquid as the power surges, and breakers blow. The burning material doesn’t spray, so much as turns into a molten liquid carpet covered in dull blue flame. 

The mob is bottlenecked, like crabs in a bucket, they drag each other backward in their desperation to kill Alex. 

It’s not napalm, but it doesn’t need to be. Carpet, spilled books, and broken pieces of door begin to catch, intensifying the flames. 

I feel on top of the world, transcendent wouldn’t be an exaggeration. I feel like I’m not only in control of the situation, but I’m part of it. 

For all of about 4 seconds. 

Shattering glass, paint peeling vulgarity, and Alex screaming. 

The window is broken, Steve leans through, trapping Alex in a sloppy chokehold. 

The sight throws the monster into the backseat, fear and uncertainty flood my thoughts. I know I have to stop Steve, but the things getting into the room aren’t going to be taken out by the fire alone. 

But Alex isn’t giving up without a fight, she claws and struggles, catching desperate breaths.

I know I have to trust her, if I don’t stop the mob, we’re both dead.

I turn to the encroaching creatures.  

The fire isn’t making their journey easy, joints start to fuse, glass eyes pop, and tin springs are turned to slag. 

But they keep coming. Screaming in rage and pain, they keep coming. 

  It scares the hell out of me, watching these metaphorical cousins of mine tearing themselves apart to get to their goal. 

But the monster begins to whisper, and I have no choice but to listen. 

I grab a pillowcase and ensnare a molten plastic dripping baby doll. I slam the thing into the spreading pool of burning liquid, flames catch from the burning droplets as the creature screams and dies. 

I feel it’s essence coursing through me, I catch glimpses of who it once was, and the horrific things that brought it to this point. 

The crowd are making headway, but each passing second in the growing conflagration takes it’s toll. Rapidly they are starting to fuse together. 

I would have assumed this to be the end, but the monster knows otherwise. 

The energies pushing them forward are simple enough this doesn’t matter. Within a half minute, it’s an amorphous, flaming blob, dozens of screaming faces propelled by melting, deformed limbs. 

I can’t let the fire do my work for me.

The strength coursing through me is more than I though possible.  I lift a sticker covered floor mirror, opening my head, wanting to have as little as possible between me and what happens next. 

It explodes in a spray of shards, crushing, and tearing the slug-like blob apart, squelching all but the worst of the flames. 

Soul drifts from the mass like steam from dumplings. My body hums with the trapped energy. 

I turn to Alex and monster or no, when I see the two inch piece of glass sticking out of her eye, I feel like a piece of shit. 

But even this isn’t stopping the kid, blood and fluid stream down her face like tears. She’s turning blue, he strength waning. 

I want to run, to save this kid, to buy a little bit of my god damned soul back. But the monster isn’t something I can flick on and off, it’s a part of me. 

There’s a wet crunch as Alex thrashes, then buries her teeth into one of the many gaping wounds on Steve. 

He has no reaction, but in a spurt of sick looking dark blood Alex severs something important. 

His arm goes limp, days of self mutilation leaving his body vulnerable. 

I’m walking toward them now, sauntering across a shelf close to the window. 

Steve begins to fall, a look of understanding on his face. The bastard grabs a fistful of Alex’s hair, slamming her into the wall, and dragging her toward the serrated remnants of window. 

I look out the window, expecting to see psychopathic glee on Steve’s face. 

I don’t, I see a young man, broken, and coming back to his senses at the worst possible time. He’s not trying to kill her, he’s holding on for dear life, one foot precariously balanced on the ladder. 

I grab his wrist, unholy energy giving me enough strength to hold him aloft. 

I scrape Alex’s hair against the shards of glass, freeing her. Steve looks up to me, pleading, literally begging. 

It isn’t a long fall, two stories or so. But Steve is already so torn apart, it’s an instant death.  

 The flames in the room are dying, thick acrid smoke wafting through the house. 

I hop off of the shelf, doing my best to keep the monster’s attention away from Alex. 

The discarded phone is cracked and melting on one side. But manages to let me get one message before it dies in a whisp of yellow smoke. 

“Get to the next town, and get to a hospital. Find some family far away.” 

Alex looks to me, one eyebrow raised for a moment. I make a god-aweful hissing noise to drive my point home. 

She leaves, of course, walking out of the house that will haunt her nightmares for years to come. 

Me, I have a supernatural gun nut to deal with. 

And that’s where I’m going to leave things for now. The battery on Alex’s laptop is dying, and I know if the Mob was this bad, whoever is upstairs is going to be a lot worse. 

To my friend in the comments, hopefully next time I get the chance to bust out a zinger or two. I don’t want to disappoint you. Though I think I might be more of a grower than a shower in that regard. 

Till next time, if there is one. 

Keep an eye out of your window. 

Punch.   

More horrors of this house
