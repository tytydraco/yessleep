I reached for my phone to see why it was vibrating, but all I found was an empty pocket.Right. No phone. I always leave it at home during my morning runs.I guess it’s just muscle memory at this point.

I was about two-thirds through the loop, right at my favorite part, the boardwalk. It’s been here as long as I can remember. A wooden behemoth that snakes through the woods and glides just above a peculiarly dense swamp. There’s nothing else like it around here. Hell, I bet you’d have to drive a hundred miles just to think about seeing another swamp like this. But here it is, sprawling oak trees, moss that hangs low enough to tickle the back of your neck, and every critter and crawler you can imagine. A slow aroma of mildew and decay constantly creeps up and over the deck, swallowing anyone, or anything, that dares to intrude. 

Most people hate it. I always thought it was cool, like taking a walk through Jurassic Park.

I get to skim right through the heart of it, just a few feet above the undulating green muck. I’d never dare walk into it barefoot. Luckily, I don’t have to, I just plod along in my running shoes on top of the creaky old deck boards.

My run was going smooth. Steady breathing, light steps. I was in the zone.

Kerplunk.

And then I wasn’t.

Something deep. 

Heavy. 

Something big slipping beneath the water.

I stopped instinctively and craned my head. The morning fog curled around the knees of the trees. I leaned over the rail, peering into the water, but saw only ripples fading into stillness.Probably just a turtle, I told myself.

I turned back, ready to move on, then heard movement. Closer. Directly beneath me.I looked down.

In the narrow crack between two boards was something that shouldn’t be there.

The last thing that should be there.

An eye.

Human.

Wide, bloodshot, unmoving.

“Don’t run,” it said.The voice was quiet, warped; gargled through some otherworldly rotary.My breath forgot me, and a dark current shuddered through my body.

“What the hell are you doing down there?”

“Help,” the voice whispered. “Please.”

“You stuck or something?” 

I scanned the woods for any sign of someone else. Nothing. Just trees and fog.

“I’ll go get someone.”

Silence.

A hypnotizing, hellish gaze, straight from the event horizon.

It spoke again, “Pull me out,” it almost cooed.

“I… I don’t want to get in there,” I admitted, ashamed. “This is too much. I’ll… I’ll get some help.”

“No!” the voice snapped, sharper this time.

I started backing away, slowly.

It knew I wasn't biting.

“Do you know the worst word in human language?” the voice reverberated.

I didn’t respond.

The water beneath the boardwalk began to ripple and slosh. It was moving toward me.

“Mine,” said a voice—deeper now, slicing into my ears over and over.

“Mine. Mine. MINE!” it shouted as it trudged toward me, still out of my line of site.

I looked down, terrified but unable to resist peeking into the cracks.

More eyes.

 These were not human.

Cat eyes. Unblinking. Unmoving.

I backed away farther… more eyes.

I didn’t recognize these, but they weren’t predatory.

I kept backing up. I kept seeing more eyes, dozens, all different shapes and sizes. 

All unmoving. 

All cold.

I ran. 

I ran faster than I’ve ever run.I could hear the water boiling behind me, splashing onto the deck.The screams were primordial, rising from the belly of the swamp, tormenting every living creature in earshot.

I didn’t look back. I was scared I’d stumble. But I kept churning my feet. Thank God they didn’t fail me. I tore into the neighborhood, which was quiet and still, totally unaware of the horror stalking the woods nearby.

I burst through the front door and made a bline for the phone to dial 911.

So what happened?

The cops were hesitant when I told them the story. They looked at me like I was crazy.

That is, until they went out to the boardwalk.

In total, they found 13 fish, 9 deer, 14 squirrels, 5 cats (two of them bobcats), and 1 human man—all under the boardwalk. 

All dead.

They were stuck to the underside of the deck with some kind of slime. They still don’t know what it’s made of.

The official story?

The man went insane, killed and glued all these animals to the boardwalk, and then offed himself after scaring the crap out of me and gluing himself to the bottom of the boardwalk. 

But I know that’s bullshit.That man was dead as a doornail from the moment I saw his eye.

I don’t know what that… thing was in the swamp that day. And I hope I never find out.I haven’t been back down there since.

In fact, my house is currently for sale.

I might’ve stuck around if it weren’t for one terrible thing.

That evening, after the cops left and all the bodies were taken down, I was sitting on the back porch with my wife, watching our little son ride his bike around the backyard, training wheels and all.

He took a little spill trying to turn too sharp and rolled over the handlebars onto the lawn. I ran over to help him up. He fussed a little, but he was okay.I stood his bike back up, and my eyes flicked to the center of the frame.

Deep scratches in the metal spelled out one word:

Mine
