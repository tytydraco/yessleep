This is a long one
And I really hoped I had videos and photos my bad


This happend a few weeks ago I live in the Netherlands. There is this forest with a abandoned high school and it’s a school with 4 floors and the school is really long but I’ll just start. 



I was just chilling and I got a call from my friend if he wanted to go to that abandoned school and I said: no your crazy that’s haunted and scary and to deep into the woods we will get lost and it’s almost dark. But what got me to go is that some girls were coming and one of those girls was my crush so I said ok and I came to his house to meet.




 When I came to his house we went to the school. When we reached the woods it was already dark so we went back and got flashlights. Already I don’t think the half of the walk there we were lost. I said: I think we should go back it’s dark and scary let’s go. But they did not want to go and I was the funny kid of the group and I wanted to stay because my crush wanted to stay so we went walking again. 





When we got there we were looking for a place to enter the building but all the doors was locked and it is a school nobody went to the school ever because there was no window broken only thing was that the inside looked like it got bombed everything was destroyed and there was plants growing. We found a open window but we had to clime a little bit we got in and there was a big echo for everything if you dropped something you could hear it in the whole school. When we dropped in the school from the window it was so loud. We walked threw the school and talked a little we stopped at I think the principal room with 2 computers and a MacBook my friend put in his bag pack we played spin the Botle I got the chance to kiss my crush and we played truth or dare.






 There was a silent because two girls had to kis each other but when they kissed we heard a hard bang it echoed through the whole building. We were all quiet. We heard steps from a couple people minimum 5 people. Than we heard people talking. I was kind of relieved. But also not because maybe we couldn’t be here. We were quite for like a whole 5 minutes looking at each other and there were still steps and talking going on my friend stood up and opened the door and looked outside. He saw nothing came back in and sat back on the chair and there was still talking and foot steps. It wasn’t that Loud so maybe they were far.





 But we thought about how did they come in since there was just one window open and if they broke a window we would have definitely heard it and same if they opened a door because the doors were loud and the front door and back door or any door was locked. So we were thinking what we should do if we should leave or hide. I don’t remember what they were saying because I was a little scared. There was one guy I didn’t really know he was a tough guy he was the strongest guy in our group we were with 5 girl and 3 boys. The tough guy wanted to go out and just fight them . I said: no ofc not that’s a dumb idea. Than we begun fighting because he pushed me. We were fighting for 1 minutes just punching eachother till he pushed me agains a closet that made a hard bang and after it was done. It was all quiet there was no one talking anymore or steps we begin to hide.






 The thing I remember as if it was yesterday. One of the guys said: what was that  maybe this is haunted or something. He said that in a deep old man voice I was hidden behind a big plant you could only see me if you looked good and had a good flash light so if they came and search here they couldn’t really find me. Well we were there for like a whole 10 to 20 minutes. Than everything went silent. So we took our chance. We went to the window so silent as possible when we were almost there we heard footsteps and really close.




 And I was in the back I looked back side every where my heart was in my throat going so fast. Those steps were so hard my breath going so fast everyone to was scared but the tough guy did something that changed everything. He shouted: Hey come at me what do you want. I shouted back: what the f*ck are you doing. And we looked as steps went faster I wanted to do something but was frozen and did not know what to do. I saw a long dude I think 6,8 6,9 and I was 5,9 and the tough one was 6,2. So to me he was long I looked from a far away he came running so fast but he ran from the way we needed to go.




 We ran the other way he was shouting so loud. It was so loud. Almost got deaf I looked back he was closer and getting closer but I was the fastest of my group I am a point guard at my basketball team and fullback at my football team. I am the fastest and second strongest I tried to run faster the halls came to a end and we had to make a turn but it ended when we made the turn it ended after a few steps. So there he was well he shouted at us he ran at me and the tough guy were taken by the neck and he seriously just took us picked us up as if we were nothing.




 He had a mask over his eyes and nose but his mouth and beard a long ass beard and he was strong stronger than the both of us and long. The tough one punched him in the face he could just hit him. And he let us fall and we ran. We ran to the window. We reached it and got out of the window and we ran into the woods. We found a path of grid and that means that we are close to our neighborhood but we heard something I really hoped I never heard. We heard behind us 3 black jeeps as if it was from like the fbi we ran into the woods and we found a road and then again the cars but the road was the road into our neighborhood. 





We ran in the neighborhood over fences and and we came to my house we got in my house locked the doors and got snacks allot of water and went to my room and we were just chillin for 10 min and we heard cars. We turned off the song and led light and looked out the window and I swear they stopped infront of my house but I don’t know how they have found my house. We looked at them how they step out of their car look at some of the houses and from the look of it they were all so long just as long as the guy at the school that made me scared us scared but they just stepped in their vehicle and drove away and than we stayed up . 





all night for 2 days in my room so the whole weekend with the chips and drinks and a pee bottles and the girls just went to the bathrooms but not alone. Me and my crush now have a relationship because we spinner the botle some times when we were in my room. But now I’m still a little scarred to be close the woods and I wish I had photos and vids.
