Nothing else of note occurred throughout the week. Besides a few other spats (Joey and I, of course), we shortly settled into a routine. Two times a day I or Beatriz brought the cows in and the three of us worked to milk them. Joey eventually caved after day three and began to shovel shit (a job he was made for, I'll give him that). We gave the ladies a brief wellness check. Beatriz, with one of us helping, would fill the grain truck and bring it over to the herd. Amari followed us the entire time, supervising the crazy teenagers her parents let take care of the place to be sure they didn't get up to any crazy shit. Twice that week we all piled onto the feed truck and drove the perimeter of the property to look for fence breaks. Bob's enthusiasm and trust in us made me want to take good care of the place and I can confidently say we did that.

We were still teenagers on the cusp of adulthood though, and rejoiced at the time away from our parents and responsibilities. We made the journey into town several times and found the liquor store clerk, a handle-bar mustache, good ol' boy named Roger, didn't mind none of us were twenty-one and provided us all the booze our shitty wages could afford. Turns out I didn't need to fill my suitcase with cigarettes after all. When I pointed out the Marlboro's on the shelf behind him, Roger was just as glad to provide those as the booze.

\*\*\*

So,a couple times that week we maybe had to crawl our way out to take care of the cows. One night we even got real crazy and played a game of Monopoly. 

...

"Uh-uh you best count that shitty ass paper money again bud, 'cause that was only one-hundred-and-eighty and I am owed two-hundred--"

...

"\*OoOoOoOoh and Sam is in jail again!"

...

"Y'know, Joey... Let me-- Let me make you a deal y'see, yeah? I will give you both my railroads. And you will have all four railroads and be making some absolute fucking bank. Alllll I want is Connecticut Avenue, the shitty little projects, ya dig?"

"You got yourself a fucking deal B."

"Joey what have you done, God-fucking-dammit-- "

"Oh B you absolute whore--"

"What can I say boys? I am fucking queen of the slums."

...

Okay, maybe not the most interesting night, but when Amari jumped onto the board holding a mouse, scattering hotels and money across the floor, Sam nearly flipped the table in fright.

"Oh my God oh my God it's a mouse--!" she shrieked shrilly, shrinking into the couch.

B got up with the slow deliberateness of the inebriated and yelled, "Drop it! Amari, Drop it!" Surprisingly, the cat listened and dropped the carcass directly onto Marvin Gardens.

"Cat's a barn cat Sammy, she does that all-- all the time. She eased herself back to the couch, picked up her can of Coors, and continued, "Keeps the little bastards outta the pantry, the hay. All that shit." She burped and took a sip.

I turned to Joey to cajole him into getting a paper towel or broom/dustpan to pick up the carcass (I would justify it by arguing Joey was closest to the kitchen, B was too drunk, Sam was scared half to death, and I just didn't want to), but then the "little bastard" got up off Marvin Gardens and started making laps around the board.

B jumped back, sloshing beer all over herself "Motherfuck-- Jeez-us fuck 'Mari, you didn't kill it, ya dang cat!" Amari didn't seem to mind the chaos she was causing and just began batting the poor little thing across the board as it squealed louder than Sam, frantically trying to avoid the cat's paws.

"Dammit Amari! Kill the thing or let it go, don't just mess around with it!"

Amari ignored us, completely focused on her prey. She swung her paw and the mouse tumbled to the (real maple hardwood) floor and lay there, stunned. It recovered quickly though, and scurried down the hall with Amari chasing it.

When we next saw the cat, she was licking blood from her paws.

\*\*\*

It was the last night of the week before Bob and Maria were set to return.

I was bringing the old girls in as dusk set over the property, coaxing them with a treat of sliced bananas and apples that they would get only the evening’s milking. It was still and quiet with nats bumping lazily against the lights. B and Sam would follow me out shortly, and I had decided to get an early start to breath in the cooling evening air, alone, for a moment. I also wanted a smoke, or two... maybe three.

With a cigarette jammed into the corner of my mouth I started counting each head. There was Molly, Polly, Holly, Lolly, Jolly -- huh no Dolly. She was normally the first in line for feed. Welp, animals broke routines just like humans, she'd come jaunting up when her stomach started growling, which I was sure wouldn’t be long.

I idly paced back-and-forth along the fencerow, chain smoking. I hadn't been thinking of anything in particular at the time, but then the most peculiar feeling came over me: fear. My chest became tight while my heart began to flutter like a bird trapped in the cage of my ribs. I became suddenly aware of the deepening evening and how, accented by the dingy lights over the barn entrance, the cows looked like giant, writhing slugs as they shuffled beyond the gate. Everything was so, so quiet besides their movement.

I don't know why such a feeling came over me. Now, I assure you, what I smoked was pure tobacco. I hadn't been huffing marijuana and gotten the jitters. None of us had been drinking that night (having a hangover the morning Bob and Maria returned would not be ideal) and even if we had, this had never been a symptom for me before.

Considering it now, maybe my... animal instincts knew something I didn't.

"Damn. Damn. Damn. You stupid motherfucker." I whispered under my breath. I was kicking myself for never taking the shotgun when I went out. Hurrying towards the barn, I was eager to get the big, industrial fluorescents on. To see that the cows were still, in fact, cows and to leave this irrational fear behind with the smoldering remains of my cigarettes.

I never got the chance.

As I opened the barn doors, something crashed into my back and I was nearly bowled over to the ground. I screamed like a little girl, I'll admit it, and shuffled back like a crab in panic. I lashed out blindly and only managed to skim my hands on the wall. Then it hit me that, rather than experiencing ripping teeth and shearing claws, all I heard was laughter.

Human laughter.

B.

"Oh-- oh-- man Conner, I'm sorry I thought you heard me--!" She held her stomach and cackled like she thought the heart attack I was currently experiencing was the funniest fucking thing this side of the looney bin. "I didn't think I'd actually get you, man!"

I just groaned miserably and kinda fell into the dust as the initial, paralyzing fright left me. I curled up like a dead turtle and covered my face with my hands. "Holy fuck B, what the fuck, what the fuck..." 

Upon realizing my fright was genuine, B sobered up quickly. "Fuck, Conner, I'm sorry. Are you alright? No, scratch that, stupid question. Uh..." She held a hand out to me.

"B, you gonna drop me on my ass if I take your hand?"

"No, Conner, I ain't."

And she didn't. B braced my feet with her toes and hauled me up. She patted me hard on the back and helped brush off the layer of dirt on my clothes.

"You done got a fright Conn-man? You're jumpy as shit. I ain't never seen you jump so high."

"I don't know B, shit man, I- I- I- was completely fine, then this- this- fear came on over me. You aren't scared? You... you don't feel that?"

"Naw man, I don't. I'm sorry." B was quiet for a moment, "Well you don't have to worry about that now. The only boogeyman haunting this here land is me. Besides," B idled over to the fence row and picked up the shotgun she had brought from the house. "We got this bad mamma jamma if anybody tries to mess with us."

I eyed the shotgun, "B, you mind if I, ah, could I carry the gun?"

"You sure, man? You are awfully jumpy. I don't want to be blown away if I go *boo*."

"It would make me, uh, feel better."

"Alright, alright. You don't want the woman handling the gun. It done makes you nervous. I gotcha." B said sarcastically, but she did hand me the shotgun.

I immediately felt better once I got the strap over my shoulder. B was right, if anything chose to mess with us they would be having a bad fucking day.

While I got my bearings B continued, "Joey's decided to make chicken titties to 'celebrate our last day in the middle of fuck-all nowhere'. Sam's makin' sure he doesn't burn down the house, so it's just the two of us."

"How romantic." Stupid Conner, stupid, stupid why did you say that you fucking idiot.

"Of course," B agreed easily, "You, me, and--" she glanced at the cows who just minutes ago were devilish Creatures from the Black Lagoon, but now, they were just what they had been all along. Cows. "Molly, Polly, Holly, Lolly, Joll--" Silence. Then.

"You don't see Dolly, do you?"

"Didn't see her when I first got out here. She still ain't in?"

"No." B got the spotlight off her belt and shined it on the herd. The white splotches on Dolly's face were usually bright and apparent but they remained absent. B hummed, "Call me batshit, but Holly is the one that's pregnant, right? We ain't expecting Dolly to calve prematurely and be holed up with a baby?"

"Right."

"Let's check the fence. Maybe she's close around, just bein' funny. Maybe she got stuck or... or something." Neither of us wanted to admit it, but cows were herding creatures, and they weren't often separated and 'just bein' funny' unless something was very, very wrong.

I shivered. I was still very, irrationally, scared. I may not know what happened to Dolly or what I was even scared of, but what I did know was that I did not want to go into that long, flat darkness outside the border provided by the lights. Not even for a short distance. Not even with my best friend by my side and a shotgun on my back.

But I really, really didn't want to disappoint Bob. He had entrusted his property to us. Besides, it's like I said earlier. Whether it was aliens or earthquakes, the cows were fed. The cows were taken care of. As farm kids to our very bones, I knew that B and I really had no choice.

So, I used the bucket to lead the cows into the barn, where B and I put them into the stalls to ensure they all remained safe. I clasped the strap of the shotgun nervously while B confidently strode back out the door.

And into the darkness we went.
