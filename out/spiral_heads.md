Dear God,  
  
I... I don't even know how to begin. My hands are trembling as I write these words, my heart pounding in my chest. The terror that has gripped me, the horrifying images that haunt my every waking moment... they're all too much to bear.  
  
I Watched that cursed video, and now everything has changed. I feel like I'm trapped in a nightmare that I can't wake up from. The faces of those I once knew, even my own parents, have become twisted, contorted spirals of grotesque proportions. It's like they're mocking me, laughing at my fear.  
  
I'm scared. I'm so damn scared. Scared doesn't even begin to cover it. I'm terrified. How did it come to this? How did I become this monster, this vessel of darkness? It's like my mind has been torn apart, and I can no longer distinguish between reality and the macabre delusions that plague me.  
  
My Friends, teachers, even strangers on the street, they're all out to get me, to tear me apart limb by limb. Trust? Trust is for the weak. Paranoia consumes my thoughts, isolating me from the world I once knew. I'm suffocating in my own fears, drowning in a sea of these spiral faces.  
  
I can't escape, there is no escape. I've locked myself away, barricaded in the safety of my room. But even here, the horror finds me. It seeps through the cracks, whispering its malevolent secrets, reminding me that there is no refuge from the spiraling madness.  
  
And then it happened. I... I killed them. My own parents, consumed by the spirals, became monsters in my eyes. In a moment of terror and confusion, I pushed my mother away, and she tumbled down the stairs, and then, it all stopped, she wasn't scaring me anymore, I felt better, and free after so long.  
  
That Night. My father came, he saw mother, demanded answers from me. I told him, she isn't scary now, but he didn't looked happy, I saw those spirals twisting and turning in his face, malice dripping from his eyes, he was about to kill me. In a maddened frenzy, I grabbed the umbrella, and shoved it into his face, right in the middle of the spiral.  
  
For a fleeting moment, the spirals receded, revealing a glimpse of normalcy, his face was normal again. I fixed my father, but he was gone, forever, and in that moment, I don't know why I laughed , I just felt a joy. But it wasn't enough. It never is.  
  
My mother woke, I told her, i fixed my father, and I promised to fix her too, rid her of the spirals that swallowed her whole. But she didn't looked happy, she was in full control of the spirals in her face, she started screaming and crying as I approached to fix her, but she started running, her desperate escape ended in a tragic fall, and i finally fixed her too, But she was gone too. I never asked for any of this. These thoughts, these impulses, they clawed their way into my brain, I just wanted to be free from the spirals, from the fear that haunted me.  
  
Now, here I am, staring at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. The spirals have consumed me entirely, twisting my own face into something unrecognizable. They mock me, taunt me with their grotesquery. Despair's suffocating me, squeezing the life out of my soul. I don't know what's happening to me. I don't know why I've done these terrible things. All I know is that the darkness inside me has taken control, and I can't escape it.  
  
Can't take it anymore. The weight of my actions, the horrors I've unleashed upon the ones I loved... it's too much. I wish I could find a way out of this nightmare, a way to undo the damage I've caused. But there is no escape, all I can do is to fix myself.  
  
Thanking you,  
  
Me,  
Forever lost in the spirals,  
  
  
  
  
As we delve into my disturbed psyche, it becomes apparent that my actions were born from a complex web of circumstances and psychological pressures that twisted my perception of the world.  
  
I am a diligent high school student, lived a life under the constant scrutiny of my parents and society. From a young age, I was molded into the archetype of the ideal student, pushed to excel academically and uphold a quiet demeanor. My parents, brimming with pride, celebrated my achievements, but little did they know the yearning that burned within me.  
  
Locked in the confines of a world centered around studies and discipline, I longed for a taste of the carefree life my classmates enjoyed. I yearned for the casual conversations about drugs and experiences that whispered in my ears, tempting me to step beyond the boundaries of my structured existence. But I never had the chance to explore these avenues, to indulge in the spontaneity and freedom that others seemed to effortlessly embrace.  
  
The pressure I faced, the weight of expectations, slowly built a fear inside me. It was a fear of breaking free, of venturing into the unknown and risking the loss of the identity I had carefully crafted. I felt trapped, suffocated by the narrow path laid out before me. Jealousy gnawed at my heart as I watched others enjoy the youthful adventures I was denied.  
  
And then, that video. It acted as a key, unlocking the floodgates of my repressed desires and fears. It triggered something deep within my brain, a psychological response that manifested as the horrific spiral phenomenon. This was not a supernatural curse, but a glimpse into the complexities of the human mind.  
  
Science tells us that our perception is shaped by our experiences and beliefs. My mind, burdened with societal pressures and unfulfilled desires, created its own twisted reality. The spirals became a symbolic representation of my fears, transforming the faces of those around me into grotesque monsters. It was a defense mechanism, a way for my mind to cope with the overwhelming sense of entrapment and paranoia.  
  
My descent into madness was not an act of pure evil, but a  culmination of psychological turmoil and a longing for freedom. Let us reflect on the societal pressures we place on individuals, the consequences of denying them the chance to explore their own identities.  
  
Human mind is very fragile, the importance of nurturing a supportive and inclusive environment that allows individuals to flourish, free from the shackles of expectations is important.
