This happened to me around 6 years ago back in high school. I’m 23 (M), then I would’ve been 16-17 years old. Me and a group of friends were smoking a blunt we rolled on the back porch. It was around 10pm and it was dark. There were 4 of us and we were all sitting on patio furniture making a circle. I was sitting in the direction facing the house. Looking forward, I could see the back door and one of my friends in front of me. This area of the patio still had a roof above it, but it wasn’t a closed off patio. Behind me was the backyard, which descended towards the back fence. This resulted in people walking on the sidewalk to see directly into the yard. Smoking isn’t legal where we lived so we were cautious of people walking by. Well, a group of a few people were walking and they reached the spot where the yard was visible. My friend group  was casually watching to make sure we weren’t upsetting anyone (you could smell it. It was gas).  They passed, and I as I turned back around to face the circle, a flash of bright light came from above the back door, just below the ceiling. It lasted for just a second and it instantly made me think of a camera flash. But it came from above us and I was certain. It made no sense, the place it came from was a brick wall.  I saw it cast shadows of my friends onto the groud. It honestly frightened me.  I immediately asked everyone in the circle if they had just seen the flash of light. 

Everyone paused from whatever conversation was happening and looked at me confused. They all said no, but I was positive of what I saw. I explained there was a flash of light, like from a camera and it came from above the back door. They all looked at the empty brick wall, and basically shrugged it off as me just being high. I remember asking them what it could’ve been, but with  zero logical explanations, the conversation moved on. I kind of just sat there and tried to figure it out. It felt surreal when I realized no one else had seen the light. And I mean, it was bright. In the darkness of night time, every should have seen it. It lit up the entire back porch. I remember seeing it come from above us, I could see the tops of my friends head lit up, and their shadows on the ground. 

For days I brought it up numerous times to multiple people. A few people said it was super natural. My friends dad said it could’ve been a rush of chemicals or something from being worried we’ll get caught. I’ve had an idea that maybe in one universe those group of people on the sidewalk did cause a problem with us smoking, and something pivotal happened to me. But that’s seems unlikely and what do I know tbh. 

It’s been 6 years and I still have no explanation for what I saw, or what may have happened..
