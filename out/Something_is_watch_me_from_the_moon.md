I’ve always loved staring at the night sky. There’s something so infinite and calming about it. That’s why, when I bought my new telescope last month, I spent every clear night outside, scanning the heavens. I live in a rural area where light pollution is minimal, so the stars and planets practically jump out at you.

The moon, though—that’s always been my favorite. Something about its pale glow feels ancient, almost sentient. It draws you in. But lately, it’s felt… off.

It started about two weeks ago. I was gazing at the moon through my telescope, marveling at the craters and the shadows along its surface. Then I noticed something odd—a dark spot on the edge of the Sea of Tranquility. At first, I thought it was just an unusually deep crater, but it didn’t look right. The shape was too precise, too angular.

I chalked it up to my cheap telescope and went to bed. But the next night, it was still there, and it seemed… closer.

Each night after that, the spot grew larger, as if whatever it was was moving toward me. By the fifth night, I realized it wasn’t just a spot. It was an eye.

At first, I thought I was losing it. I mean, how could something be staring back at me from the moon? But when I tried to look away, I felt its presence, heavy and undeniable. It wasn’t just staring—it was watching.

I stopped using the telescope after that, but it didn’t help. Now, I can feel it even without looking. It’s like an itch in the back of my mind that I can’t scratch. When the moon rises, the feeling intensifies. It’s as if its gaze pierces through walls, trees, and clouds, following me wherever I go.

Last night was the worst yet. I woke up at 3:33 a.m. to find my room bathed in pale moonlight. The feeling of being watched was suffocating. My heart was racing, and I swear I heard whispers—soft, incomprehensible murmurs that seemed to come from inside my skull.

This morning, I decided to investigate. I spent hours combing through online forums, trying to find anything similar. Most of what I found was nonsense—paranoia about lunar conspiracies or hoaxes. But one post caught my eye. It was from a user who claimed to have seen the same thing. Their post ended abruptly, but their last line chilled me to the core:

“Once it notices you, it never stops watching.”

The moon is rising now. I can’t bring myself to look outside, but I can feel it. The pressure in my head is unbearable, and the whispers are growing louder. They’re no longer gibberish.

They’re saying my name. Over and over, in voices that are both familiar and wrong—like echoes of people I know, distorted through something alien.

I tried plugging my ears. It didn’t help. The sound isn’t coming from outside; it’s coming from within.

My phone lit up just now. A notification—an unknown number. The message was just one word:

LOOK.

My chest feels tight, like there’s a rope cinching around my lungs. Against every ounce of my better judgment, I glanced toward the window. Just for a second.

It’s closer.

The moon, I mean. It shouldn’t be possible, but it is. It’s bigger, brighter, filling the entire sky like a pale, cyclopean eye staring directly into my soul. I don’t know how I didn’t notice it before.

And that dark spot—the eye—is no longer a spot. It’s vast, intricate, pulsating. It almost looks alive. It’s not just staring anymore. It’s… opening.

I can feel something pulling at me. Not physically, but mentally, like it’s reaching into my thoughts and dragging them out into the light. Memories, fears, regrets—they’re all unraveling, laid bare under that impossible gaze.

My phone buzzed again. Another text.

COME OUTSIDE.

I don’t know why I’m even writing this. Maybe it’s to ground myself, to keep some thread of sanity. But the whispers are louder now, and they’ve changed. They’re no longer just saying my name—they’re begging. Pleading.

“Join us.”

I’m terrified, but I can’t stop myself. My legs are moving on their own. I’m at the door now, my hand on the knob. I know I shouldn’t open it, but the pull is too strong.

The door creaked open, and the night spilled in—cold, silent, and drenched in moonlight. The world outside didn’t look right. Everything was sharper, more vivid, as though the moon’s light had etched every detail into my vision. The shadows seemed to ripple, alive with movement just beyond the edges of my perception.

And there it was, hanging impossibly low in the sky. The moon. No, not the moon—something inside it. The eye was fully open now, impossibly vast, filling the horizon. It pulsed with a slow, deliberate rhythm, like the heartbeat of something ancient and incomprehensible.

I tried to turn back, to run inside, but my body refused to obey. My feet moved forward, step by step, as though I were a puppet on invisible strings. The whispers weren’t whispers anymore—they were a chorus, a thousand voices speaking as one.

“You are seen. You are chosen.”

The ground beneath me seemed to dissolve into light. No, not light—something denser, heavier, pulling me upward. I floated, weightless, toward the eye. The closer I got, the more I could see its texture—veined and organic, yet glimmering like the surface of a pearl.

And then, I saw them. Faces. Millions of faces, pressed into the surface of the eye, their mouths moving in silent screams. Their eyes locked onto mine as I ascended, and I realized they weren’t screaming—they were mouthing a single word:

“Run.”

But it was too late. The light swallowed me whole, and the last thing I remember was the sensation of falling—not downward, but outward, into endless, frozen space.

Now, I’m here. Somewhere. Nowhere. The whispers have stopped, but the silence is worse. I can’t move. I can’t feel. I’m part of it now, another face in the endless void.
If you’re reading this, I don’t think I’ll be able to tell you what happens next. But maybe, just maybe, this is a warning. If you ever feel it—the moon’s gaze—don’t look. Don’t listen.

And whatever you do, don’t go outside.
