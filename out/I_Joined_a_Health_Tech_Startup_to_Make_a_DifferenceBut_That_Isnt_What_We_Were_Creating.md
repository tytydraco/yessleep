I signed the offer at 2 a.m., laptop teetering on the counter, ramen steam blurring the screen. My apartment was a shrine to junk and half-finished projects, but I had a job now. A tech startup in Silicon Valley promising a product that would change how people sleep. I believed it. I wanted to believe it.

They called it the RESTband. The REM Enhancement & Sleep Tracking (REST) band. The concept was pretty straightforward. A soft and lightweight headband that you could wear comfortably during sleep, designed to improve sleep quality using gentle neural stimulation and light vibrations. It tracked brainwaves and even manipulated them, enhancing your sleep by using gamma wave entrainment. To explain it simply, tiny sensors delivered light, noninvasive pulses that stimulated the brain and synced with the sleeper’s natural cycle. Those pulses would “entrain” the brain to maintain or increase gamma activity - promoting better sleep. 

It felt genius. We were writing code that would touch strangers’ brains while they slept. 

I went to work every day believing that I was making a difference. People who suffered from insomnia would feel well-rested, waking up groggy would be over, people could go about their mornings without having “brain-fog”. I was excited to be working on something meaningful. 

On top of this, we had an added perk. Everyone working at the company had a prototype of the RESTband they could use. After all, we had to have real data points to continue to develop and innovate. 

Then some random night I was at home on my laptop, working on the latest API to integrate into the new hardware when I felt a tinge of curiosity.  

RESTband’s backend was notorious for being off-limits to most employees. Hell, everything important was cordoned off. Cloud servers, encrypted drives, corporate partitions. We heard the phrase, “security first” over and over again. But since I was working on the latest API, I was granted with root access. I was itching to poke around. I just wanted to take a tiny peek. Nerds do that on the regular. Right?

Most of what I saw was pretty useless. Log files, error reports, half-developed code packages with cute little developer nicknames like SHEEP_COUNTER and SW33T_DR34M5. It was like I was rummaging through a closet of junk.

I knew I wasn’t supposed to be in there, my credentials only allowed me access so I could test the API. But as the night wore on, I found my way further into the system. I kept telling myself that what I was doing was harmless. I wasn’t stealing anything, breaking anything, or changing anything. I wanted to see how it all worked. 

I was pretty disappointed that I hadn’t come across anything noteworthy. But then I started seeing folders with tags like:

RESTRICTED INTERNAL USE ONLY

No obvious functions or purpose. Just locked doors with vague names. 

I should have logged off. But every coder or computer geek knows that itch. Locked door - open it. 

It took me a while, but I wrote a custom script that tricked the server into believing that I had read/write access to the files. I was finally into the goldmines of how RESTband worked. 

But it wasn’t a goldmine. I had opened a vault that was sealed off for a reason. 

The folder opened. There were files everywhere. Graphs. Reports. PDFs. A flood of data that meant nothing. Then I hovered my cursor on something that stuck out to me. 

AG_009: REC-07-10

A description flag popped up underneath it. 

“Leverage Potential: HIGH, Pressure Rating: 8.77” 

What the fuck did that mean? 

Leverage potential. Pressure Rating. That didn’t have anything to do with sleep, and surely not with health or wellness. 

My hand was quivering on top of my mouse. Sweat dripping onto the plastic. Against my better judgment - I clicked. 


It took a moment, and a window opened up and began playing a video. It was choppy and the quality wasn’t great, but good enough to see what was going on and hear audio. 

I saw a dimly lit room on my screen, with a soft warm light coming from the corner. A woman stood in the doorway, her hands running through a man’s hair. Their mouths suddenly pressed together, with fierce and intense passion, like a storm erupting out of nowhere. 

I was frozen in my desk chair. This wasn’t a scene from a movie or TV show. The way she clawed at his back, the hitch in her breathing, the lustful determination from the man - it was intimate in a way beyond acting. A moment between lovers that wasn’t meant to be seen. I could see the glint of her wedding band under the light, and I was able to see her face. 

My stomach turned over. 

It was one of my coworkers. A teammate. In fact, it was the woman who had given me a tour on my first day of work. The same woman who laughed at my bad jokes and worked so hard to make me feel welcome. 

I fell backward in my chair with a jolt of disbelief. I felt nauseous. This wasn’t just anyone. It was someone I worked with. My chest was tight and I felt a heaviness in my body. 

How the hell had this video made its way on to a company server? Were they surveilling her? Why would they want to have this? I closed the viewer and started scrolling further for answers. 

It seemed like hours and I finally found a folder that seemed important. I opened it up and saw rows of files. One in particular seemed to stand out

EXECUTIVE_INSIGHT_REPORT_022.PDF

I swallowed hard and began reading. The first paragraph hit me like a wave of suffocating panic, pressing the air from my lungs. 

“RESTband devices are capable of accessing episodic memory fragments during REM sleep. Using unique proprietary neural reconstruction algorithms, these fragments are able to be reformatted into full, third-person, viewable sequences.” 

Holy shit. 

Viewable sequences? Of people’s memories? 

My mind was swirling in all directions as I read each line. RESTband could take every detail, every secret, every moment - and reconstruct it into a video that could be watched. 

Then it hit me.

I had been wearing my prototype for weeks. 

I backed out of the pdf and started scrolling. 

Jesus Fucking Christ.

There it was - a string of files all starting with the same letters: 

SF

My initials. 

I clicked on the first file: SF_001: REC-06-28

The viewer opened and video began to play…I recognized it instantly. 

I was standing in a parking lot, rain pouring down in sheets. In the corner of the video there was text:

ESTIMATED TIMESTAMP: April 11, 2021 2AM 

The angle of the video was elevated, like it had been filmed by a ghost hovering in mid-air. 

I already knew what was going to happen but I watched it anyway. 

I was shoving someone into the back seat of my car. My arms flailed up and down in a frenzy, and my breath spilled out in pale clouds that twisted and vanished into the cold night air.

The person beneath me, a young man, was struggling. He was a blur of movement and I could hear desperation in his cries. 

The quality of the video was slightly distorted. But it was clearly me in the foreground. Clear enough for anyone who saw it to believe it. 

I remembered that night differently. It was a fight. An argument I didn’t want. Chaos that I hadn’t asked for. The kind of thing you eventually convince yourself was just a bad moment. And here it was on a screen playing in front of me. I felt sick. 

Then I heard the words I already knew: 

“You tell anyone, and I mean anyone about this, and I’ll fuck your life up.”

My stomach was in knots. Nobody knew about this. But there it was, recorded and cataloged onscreen with a description in the corner:

Leverage Potential: VERY HIGH, Pressure Rating: 9.82 


Fuck. 

I understood now. I understood everything. RESTband wasn’t promoting health and wellness, or helping you get a restorative night’s sleep, it was reaching into the dark corners of your mind and pulling out what you buried and handing it back to someone else like a loaded gun. 

The deeper I looked, the worse it got. File after file, each one more damning than the last. Dozens of reconstructions from employees and investors using the prototypes: whispered confessions behind closed doors, unreported crimes, affairs no one knew about. Each clip was precise, invasive, and devastating. Private moments, indulgences, betrayals…all meticulously catalogued, waiting to be used. 

This was a weapon. 

I knew I had to do something. I had to stop this thing from doing more damage than it had already done. Sure, I did something I wasn’t proud of. But everyone has skeletons in their closets. People make mistakes. You learn from them. You shouldn’t be punished for them. Even though that was a terrible moment in my life, I had made amends. In my own way. 

My dream of working in Silicon Valley had become a real-life nightmare, and I knew I had to use my skills to do something. I realized the simple truth of what I had seen. This existed, and it was made to be used. It was created to destroy lives. 

My plan wasn’t clever. It was really just panic dressed up into lines of code. But I had to be surgical. I had to break this thing before it became a weapon that could be unleashed on the masses. Or at least slow it down. 

So I started.

I made a patch. 

A blunt instrument masquerading as a maintenance script - changing the logic of the operating system, rebalancing parameters, rewriting system indices. On the outside, harmless. Inside, designed for one thing…setting back years of research and development. 

What really mattered is how and where I would deploy it. So I waited. Until now. Tonight there is a routine update that our ops team rolls out every month - a scheduled refresh and firmware update to the existing architecture that runs RESTband. 

Now I won’t pretend like I’m being a hero. If you think they aren’t prepared for something like this, you’re wrong. I’m not saving the world. I’m simply buying time. But I am smart, and maybe that is their true blind spot. They keep recruiting good people. The kind you shouldn’t try to exploit. 

I don’t know how well this will work. I may succeed, I may fail. Hell, I might end up in a shallow grave somewhere in California before this is all over with. But let this be the warning they never wanted to come out:

If someday you ever see RESTband or anything like it on a shelf, if you ever think about buying one for a better night’s sleep…don’t. 

It promises sweet dreams…but it harvests real-life nightmares.
