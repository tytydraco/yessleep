It was November two years ago when my father reached out to me about a noise problem with his new neighbors. A year earlier I had managed to save enough money to buy him a half-hectare property and build a two-storey house in a fishing village. My hope was to give him a peaceful retirement away from the city. I thought he would have no trouble settling in because many of our relatives lived nearby on his mother’s side, and when I inspected the place three years before it was quiet and serene.  

Things began to change with the passing of his longtime neighbor, a retired soldier. Two months ago my father told me the man had died suddenly of a heart attack. His children tore down the old wooden house and sold off his collection of antiques - that  broke my father’s heart. A new two storey house was erected, and the former colorful and wholeheartedly cared for orchidarium of the late veteran was flattened into a plain stretched front yard.

About a month later someone moved in. My father shared that he thought that they must be elite level rich.  Two large trucks arrived and a team of men unloaded many boxes. These were not ordinary movers. Their polished trucks, their blue and black jumpsuits, and their foreign appearance gave off a different kind of vibe. 

Then, a black car arrived, of which he thought was someone or someones but it was strange because they didn’t go out, which is the normal thing to do - instead, the garage door opened remotely and the car went straight inside. The movers, or whatever they were, just hopped in their trucks and went off. Safe to say that their first impression  unsettled him. 

According to him, they stayed quiet for a week and never went outside to introduce themselves, which is customary in our culture. At night, only the first floor of their house seemed lit - a single lamp in the living room, or so my father thought. After that, the problems began. He said it started when a loud, high‑pitched buzzing woke him, and a sharp zip that followed now and then felt like it could burst his eardrums. He checked the clock. It was midnight. He peeked through the window but saw nothing, since their house was the only one pitch black on the street block. This went on for many nights. After two weeks, he decided to move and live with my younger sister in the next city.

I work as a seaman, and my contract ended in the second week of December. As soon as I arrived, I went to see my father. I was furious when I saw how stressed he looked. He was fighting cancer, and the sleepless nights were making everything worse. I even considered admitting him to the hospital, but he convinced me not to. The next day, I went to his house.

I planned to arrive around noon, which I believe is the best time to discuss and settle neighborhood problems. My father was right about the house across the street. It was two storeys high with tinted windows and a closed front door. The grass on the yard was uncut, and the mailbox was stuffed with letters, with more piling on the stand. If I had not known anything about the owner, I would have thought the place was abandoned.

I smoked a cigarette before stepping onto the concrete patio and toward the varnished wooden door. I pressed the doorbell, inhaled, and unwrapped the paper packaging of an assorted chocolate box I had brought from Europe. The first ring went unanswered. On the second, a man’s voice came through the speaker.

“Hello. How may I help you?” His accent was posh, each word crisp. I felt the pressure of speaking back, almost hesitant to respond.

I explained that I was the son of the neighbor next door and asked if it was a good time to introduce myself, as was supposedly the custom in our neighborhood. The truth was different. The tradition was a lie, the chocolate box only bait, and I simply wanted to meet them face to face.

“Thank you for the kind present. However, we are occupied at the moment. If you will be kind, please place it by the doormat. Thank you.” That was the end of our exchange. I tried to continue, but the other side remained stubbornly silent.

I stood there, facing the camera for a few minutes before setting the chocolate box down on the dusty doormat and offering a quiet farewell. I went to one of my father’s cousins who wasn’t a serviceman but had a basement full of weapons and a collection of tactical gear for both business (although unregistered), and for hobby. I bought one firearm and a night vision binoculars and returned to the house. 

I sat on the couch, locked into a marathon of shows, forcing down bottles of energy drinks just to keep my eyes open. The clock became my constant companion, each minute dragging as I glanced outside toward the neighboring house. My father had been right. Only one light glowed, the one near the front window, likely from the living room when the night came. The stillness made it feel even more deliberate, I just right away felt that it was weird. I armed myself, picked up my father’s flashlight, steadied myself, and stepped out into the backyard. 

Every time I came home to visit my father, I would smoke, drink, and relax in his backyard, surrounded by the quiet of his vegetable garden under the starry skies. That night felt different. A heavy unease hung in the air, as if the darkness itself were pressing against me. I switched on the flashlight and followed the leaves covered patio path until I reached the back wall, all the while keeping a wary eye on the house. I paced the straight path three times, searching for anything out of place, but nothing seemed wrong.

Back inside, I brushed my teeth, then settled again on the couch to continue watching the show. Around 1:45 PM my sister called to check on me. We spoke briefly before I wandered into the kitchen to brush my teeth once more. I was just about to rinse my mouth when I heard the faint slide of the glass window,  likely from the bedroom.

I rushed outside and raised the intense white beam of the flashlight, a decision I regret to this day. From the wide rectangular window, something began to hover slowly into view. It was half a body of a man, or what once resembled a man, suspended by metallic tethers that glinted in the light. A chill ran down my spine when I saw his appearance. His straight black hair was combed neatly back, his thin lashes almost perfectly aligned, and his hollow eyes locked onto mine with piercing emptiness. His cheekbones jutted sharply from sunken skin, and worst of all, his mouth curved upward as if he were smiling.

His thin body frame was twisted, scattered with metallic tubes and broken patches where sheets of metal pushed through torn flesh. His upper torso looked as though it had been ripped from its other half brutally, the skin ragged and uneven at the tear. From the lower edge of his body something hung, and though I could not be certain at that distance, it seemed like a necrotized colon protruding downward.

He turned his face toward me with dreadful slowness, and my knees gave out - I just collapsed and screamed maniacally. The left side of his face was stripped bare, all skin and flesh gone - leaving only the bone. From the hollow socket of his left orbital burned a blood-red glow. The other half of his face was tangled with metallic wires, scattered in chaotic strands that clung to him like parasites - pulsating in unnerving rhythm. 

He, or whatever it was, forced open the stiff mouth, and red, blue, and yellow lights flared from within in pulsating alternations. From the rectangular window emerged a swarm of drones, their buzzing and zipping noises stabbing into my skull until it felt as though my brain would explode. I remember involuntarily striking my head against the soft ground three times before my vision went black.

When I opened my eyes, the neighbors were circling me. Most were senior citizens, and their faces drawn with worry. Morning had already broken, and I was lying on the front yard of my father’s house. An older woman, who introduced herself as a former nurse, was pressing a cloth to my forehead and told me I had a bad tear in my forehead’s skin. She said she had called an ambulance from the nearest town and that I should stay still. 

I asked if anyone had seen or heard what happened during the night. They only shook their heads or denied. I glanced up at the house. The front rectangular sliding window was closed and untouched. No damage. No trace.  

A gentleman leaned in with a grin and asked what I had taken last night. He wanted me to share it so he could try the trip I had been on. He did not bother to hide his favorite pastime from his younger years.  

I almost believed it had all been a hallucination or a bad dream. Then a sharp pain knifed through my stomach and I vomited. Among the sour mess lay a drone the size of half my palm. It writhed and twisted before staying still. Seeing that - I lost my consciousness. 

I never went back. We sold the property and built a house for my father near my sister. I never told him what happened. He died last month without knowing the truth.  

Even now I keep turning the question over in my head. Why was there a tiny drone inside me? What was that being? I try to answer and fail. But all I know now - is that I have a dreadful phobia of drones. Drones! Drones! Drones! I despised them.
