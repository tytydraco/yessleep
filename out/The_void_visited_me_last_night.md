I woke up in my room. In a sweat and daze I turn to see the clock. It reads 3:20 AM on a Saturday. Work had just cut out and I was trying to get some rest after a horrible day at work where I was constantly harassed and ridiculed by my boss. I turn on the pillow, my eyes relax when I can feel my self drifting away into my own thoughts of my head. I sit up and think.

Why did I wake up? I ask myself. Looking around the room, confused. I notice it. A tall lanky figure in the corner of my room. Not ominously standing there, more or so observing me. I tense up and clutch the soft, white and cyan blanket over me. The white light from my digital clock lighting up the room. 

I perks up, noticing I'm awake before looking directly at me, that's when I notice it. It has no features. No eyes, mouth, ears, nose, protrusions on the face either. I look to my left, my door shut, I look back at the being, its getting closer, making its way towards me faster and faster. All the sudden, I can't move. Not in a sleep paralysis way, more or so in a mental shock way. 

I shut my eyes, like a child not wanting to see the horror upon me, when I open my eyes for a brief second I notice something off. This thing that was just in the corner of my room was now at the foot of my bed staring down at me. I hear and odd ticking sound, and so does this being, however I still can't move my head, only me eyes. I look around the room with my eyes but the being looks around the room with its head. Studying everything. That's when it leans in, and it opens its eyes.  Its eyes glow bright, however with a color I've never seen before I look into its eyes and it looks into mine, me and Its eyes interlock for a few seconds before I move my hand up, I wince knowing this is stupid but I shut my eyes and touch its face.

I open my eyes to see the reaction, but the being almost seemed to have relaxed, its eyes almost glazing over like a humans. The face feels odd, I know I was touching something but I didn't know truly if I was. I knew I wasn't dreaming, or was I? It stood up before opening the door to my room. Yellow light from the hallway that I keep on incase a intruder is in my house pours onto the figure, I thought it would reveal this things face but it absorbs the light, and the room stays the same darkness even though light from the hallway is visible. It looks at me before waving and stepping into the hallway.

I look at the doorway waiting for something to happen when I hear another clicking sound coming from somewhere in my room. I turn around to see what it is and then I notice that the thing, or being is back. Its standing in the doorway, acting confused. It walks towards the bed before sitting on my bed side. Instead of feeling frightened I feel relaxed. But I don't know why. I stammer "What are you?" 

It looks up. Then I hear its voice. A sound I can't explain to you but I was still talking audible English. Then it told me.

"I am an abyss, to you. But to myself and my peers, I am but someone who visits you." Its voice is manly,. I don't know how I discerned that from him. He looks directly at me. A gaze that is almost forgiving. 

"But I am just a Visitor if you will. Most people don't recognize me or even see me. But you? You saw me."  

I blink, not even comprehending what I was hearing or looking at I ask him. 

"What's your purpose?"

He looks at me, his colorful eyes peering into me, I can practically hear his smile in his voice.

"Well you see.. people who have seen me have called me many things. Death, The Reaper. Things like that. But I am neither, I am here to just.. see how things are. I visit if you have avoided death. But in all honesty.." 

He hesitates, I want to ask how I dodged death but I let him speak.

"Death is a box. This box you see, can be broken into pieces and then scattered among the world, now I'm here to collect those pieces. The box itself has be be where you are right now in order for you to die. But if a piece of death is near you, then you are close to death. And truly even I do not know what happens after living beings die. In fact I was never truly given a job. My subconscious.."

He taps his head before chuckling.

"In fact  I don't even know why I'm doing this, I was never truly assigned to do this but I guess I am just a... a wandering entity. Bound to collect the pieces of death in order to make sure that these pieces aren't made into boxes of death. But I have cheated a bit here. I don't know if the piece in this room is going to kill you or not."

I stare at him, thinking I mean hes going to kill me. But he vanishes. Then I hear it, the clicking sound. I notice its coming from the closet, and with a boost of adrenaline from the encounter. I yank open the closet and out comes a man. a foot taller than me holding a knife. I scream before running to the table before pulling a drawer. There I see my pistol that I owned: A Magnum 300. I turn around, to see the man charging at me with a gigantic steak knife raised towards me. I shoot.

He falls to the floor. Limp. In shock I waddle over to the kitchen and grab my cell from the counter where I call the police. After telling the police a story where I heard clicking and yanked open the closet door and shot the man. The cops let me free to go after filing out a report and getting the body. 

This day I awoke to the void in my room. Before I could thank him he vanished. If he comes back, I'll thank him. But I don't know if he's trying to fulfill his duty. Or he's still watching me. I'll never know. Truly. Never, know.
