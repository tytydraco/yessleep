Over the years, the story of a backpack that brings bad luck has been going around Jacarei, which is a small city in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Its origin is unknown, but it has been passed down through generations. The main reason why its origin is unknown is because most owners simply disappear after getting rid of it.

The backpack is made from a smooth material that is amusing to touch. It had a unique shade of dark blue, which attracted people when they first see it. However, it absorbs all the light which causes its allure to disappear after a certain time. 

The first owner of the backpack is known, as a young man, named Clayton, who got the backpack after going through the belongings of his deceased grandfather. His grandfather was a wealthy man who came from nothing. But after a year of prosperity, his life took a sharp turn. His business went bankrupt, his wife died, and he started to go crazy. When he died, he was broken and miserable, yet the only “valuable” thing he had was a backpack.

Nonetheless, Clayton never knew what had happened to his grandfather that caused him to lose everything so quickly. So, he decided to keep the backpack as a memory of his grandfather. He kept it in his closet for a while, but one day he decided to use the backpack.

At first, he did not notice anything unusual about the backpack. It was just a regular backpack, after all. But as days turned into weeks, he began to experience strange occurrences. His business started to decline, his wife left him, and he even suffered a heart attack. But Clayton never connected the occurrences to the backpack itself.

Until one day, Clayton was alone in his house, at least he thought so. He was depressed, broke, and lost. Then, he heard someone knock on his door. He was weak and slow, and before he could get up to answer the door, someone else had already answered it.

Clayton was frightened and rushed to see who it was. By the time he got to the door, there was nobody, but the backpack hanging on the doorknob.

Thus, the man realized that the backpack was cursed so he decided to throw it away. He took the backpack and drove to the dumpster in his neighborhood. On his way there, his tire exploded, and the car broke down.

He was terrified, so he ran with the backpack and threw it away. He felt relieved; he felt like all his problems would go away. He gets back to the house and goes to his room. A few seconds later, he heard someone knocking on his door, and once again, someone else answered it.

Clayton ran as fast as he could to see who answered the door. And when he got there, there was no one, but the backpack on the doorknob once again.

He realized that he could not simply throw it away because it would come back. It was stuck to him. While he was thinking of a way to get rid of it, he remembered that his grandfather once told him that the backpack was a gift that someone gave to him.

Clayton concluded that he must give it to someone, yet he did not want to give it to someone he knew because he did not wish bad luck upon them. But after experiencing more bad luck, he was desperate so he did not care what would happen to the person who would get the backpack.

He went to a couple of different people, but no one wanted the backpack. He was running out of options until he found a pawnshop. He gave the backpack to the owner to sell. That seemed to be his only option. Clayton told the owner that it was a doomed bag but he agreed to keep and sell it.

After leaving the backpack at the pawnshop, Clayton’s life started to change for the better. He was getting stronger and healthier. His family started to talk with him; he was happy once again.

Until one day, his wife went back home to an empty house. Clayton was nowhere to be found. Despite her attempts to contact him, there were no traces of him.

One day, a young man walked into the pawnshop, looking for a backpack for an upcoming hiking trip. The pawnshop owner saw his opportunity and convinced the young man to buy the cursed backpack, telling him that it was a rare vintage item.

The young man was excited about his purchase and took the backpack on his hiking trip. But as soon as he put it on his back, he felt a strange energy radiating from it. He began to experience bad luck, with his hiking partner getting injured and his phone breaking down.

Realizing that the backpack was the cause of his misfortunes, the young man quickly gave it to someone else, and he went missing as the previous owner.

No one knows where the backpack is now or who its current owner is, but one thing is for sure – whoever has it is in for a world of bad luck.
