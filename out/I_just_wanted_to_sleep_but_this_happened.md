# Bathrooms are meant to be a safe space when things go wrong or something, right?

I grew up in a cramped housing community where privacy was a luxury, well, with only thin walls separating us from our neighbors. Thankfully, I had my own room, but the only bathroom was right below it. It was small and stifling, with no ventilation except in the steel door when it is opened. The ceiling was just the cement floor of my room, and the only light came from a single bulb inside. There was a small sink and a tiny 6x12 inches mirror facing the door. Despite the claustrophobic setup, I grew accustomed to what’s we’re having. A mundane life in a mundane village.

We’ve lived there for years and nothing unusual happened.

Except this time.

Like usual, college life sucks, I was having trouble sleeping whenever we had test and exams, I stayed up late, always, reviewing and getting ready for the exams. It was during one of these late-night study sessions, around 2 AM, when I decided to head downstairs for some water or maybe a cup of coffee to keep me going. Our kitchen was right next to the bathroom, and the water dispenser sat just to the left of the steel door. Every time I fetched a drink, I couldn’t help but catch a glimpse of the bathroom in my peripheral vision.

Normally, the bathroom light was off at that hour—no one used it so late. The room was like a black hole or a void I avoided staring into because the darkness unsettled me. The door was usually left ajar to air out the room, but tonight, it was shut. I distinctly remembered closing it. As I filled my glass, I could feel the weight of the darkness pressing against the thin gap under the door.

And then, something startled me. The light flickered on.

Then off.

On again. Flickering, like something out of a horror film.

I wasn’t scared. Our lights weren’t automatic, and we couldn’t afford those pistons that automatically close the door. I knew our house inside out—I’d grown up here, and with my parents away, I was the one who maintained it. My dad was working in another city, and my mom was visiting relatives in Rizal. I was alone.

**THAT DAY, I WAS ALONE.**

I told myself it was just a glitch, a faulty wire, or maybe the bulb was burning out. But deep down, I knew better. I handled all the repairs, checked the wirings myself. Everything was fine. So why did the light turn on?

Determined to prove to myself that it was nothing, I opened the door and reached for the switch on the left wall. The light turned on instantly, just as it should. For a moment, I convinced myself it was just sleep deprivation, a trick of the mind. But I knew I was fully awake, painfully aware of my surroundings.

And then, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. The flickering light seemed almost... deliberate, as if something was toying with me. I left and went upstairs.

The next morning, after a long day at university, I arrived home around 8 PM. In the Philippines, that's full night—pitch black sky. I always left the house with the lights off to avoid any fire accidents. As I unlocked the gate and stepped inside, a sense of unease washed over me. Something felt off.

All the lights were off, except for the bathroom. The door was ajar, and the light flickered ominously. My first thought was that I might have left it on in my rush to get to class. I turned it off and went upstairs to prepare for bed, dismissing the incident as a careless mistake.

I woke up at 4 AM, drenched in sweat, though I couldn’t tell if it was warm or cold. My throat was parched, so I decided to get some water. The house was silent, save for my footsteps echoing in the dark. Using my phone's flashlight to navigate, I found everything as it should be—except for the bathroom. The faucet was running, overflowing water onto the floor. I quickly shut it off and turned on the light. As I glanced in the mirror, I saw a shadowy figure behind me. I turned around, but there was nothing there. Then I turned it off again. My heart pounded, but I convinced myself it was just my mind playing tricks on me, maybe I’m stressed from midterms and the isolation of living alone. 

**ALL ALONE.**

I tried to rationalize it. I was probably just overtired and imagining things. But a part of me couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong with the house—specifically the bathroom. I imagine things out of the usual. I am not scared; I was worried that time. I couldn’t help but to think for a logical reason why I’m experiencing this.

I kept on wondering as I go back to my bedroom.

Maybe just because I’m alone.

Or sad.

Or maybe there’s something lurking inside my brain and playing tricks, manifesting as sinister things.

But I need to go back in bed.

I don’t.

I can’t.

I can’t go back to sleep.

I cannot sleep, I felt so heavy, my chest thud heavily. My brain fills with so much thought. I goosebumps and felt cold.  

Why?

Then, I heard it: a scratching sound from below. I held my breath and waited. It came again, louder this time, almost mocking me. The high-pitched noise grew more intense, then a sudden thud echoed through the house to my bedroom. The high pitch scratching is getting in tense. Then a thud.

Then, I heard something fell. I want to stand and check it but my legs are trembling. Maybe out of fear, or I’m just not certain to what to expect if I check on it.

I build up courage and stand up.

I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. As a precaution, I switched on the lights in the second floor before descending to the living room. The curtains blocked the view of the kitchen and bathroom, so I tied them back. The bathroom door was wide open, and darkness pooled inside. I saw the door wide open; I can see inside. It’s dark. 

**SO DARK**

So, I then switch on the lights in the kitchen, the light revealed my silhouette, but something was off. It wasn’t just my reflection. It seemed distorted, wrong. I forced a chuckle and think, maybe I’m just being crazy.

I reached for the switch to turn on the lights in the bathroom.

Then, I felt something.

Something in my hand…

Some-THING!

...Touching my hands as I tried to reach on the switch. I back out.

And flash the inside of the bathroom. Nothing.

NOTHING.

Maybe I’m just scaring myself. I don’t want to scare myself, obviously. I tried to calm my racing heart, which felt like it was galloping uncontrollably. But the dread lingered in my mind.

I’m being ridiculous, I thought. But I still needed to check what had fallen. Carefully, I lit the doorway inside the bathroom. A cold gust of air hit me, making me panic. I fumbled for the switch but couldn't find it.

Then, something whispered. It was incomprehensible, like someone gargling water. I accidentally shone the flashlight on the mirror, and the beam of scattered light blinded me. I almost slipped on the drenched floor.

In the midst of my disorientation, I felt it again—a firm, cold hand. Trying to grab me. Panic surged through me. All I could think was, "WHAT THE FUCK?"

I resisted, but the wet floor betrayed me.

I couldn't fight this. I was being dragged. My phone slipped from my hand and clattered to the floor. In the brief moment of light, I saw it: a giant black hand formed by smaller hands coming together. Weak and terrified, I fought back, but my grip on the door's corner pot slipped. I was pulled into the darkness. Everything around me darkened as I was drawn deeper into the abyss.

Then, I woke up. 

Drenched in sweat, my heart pounding.
