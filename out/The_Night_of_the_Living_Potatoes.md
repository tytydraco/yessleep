'James, come here now! Jesus this is so gross!'

The call came from the kitchen, Rachel's voice carrying through the thin walls of our house. Hauling myself out of bed, I hurried down to find out what had pissed her off enough to wake me up. I found her standing in the light of the open fridge pulling out a dripping mass from the bottom shelf with a finger and thumb, careful not to get any liquid on the fabric of her coat.

'James you told me that you'd cleaned the fridge out!' She said, holding up the rotten lump like an accusation.

I couldn't deny it. After days of nagging I'd given in yesterday and told her that I'd done it, hoping that she'd not try and look before her business trip. Obviously that hadn't worked, and now I was staring at the floppy carrot of consequences. I thought fast. 

'No babe, I meant that I'd get it sorted today! While you're away, I'll clean it all out, scrub it clean and get fresh food in, promise! I just didn't want to waste our last evening together doing it.'

She wasn't buying it. With an expression colder the fridge she threw the offending vegetable away, then crossed back over to pick out her lunchbag. As she did she let out a cry of disgust before thrusting it out towards me.

'What the hell is this, James?!'

I looked at the thin brown slime staining the side of her bag, and the small, sad potato that clung grimly on to the organic glue. I briefly considered actually guessing what the substance was, but luckily some sense of self preservation kicked in at the last moment.

'My fault babe, it's my fault, I'm sorry.' I said quickly, plucking the semi-rotten tuber off Rachel's food bag and reaching for the kitchen roll. 'Let me sort it.'

'It's foul James, it's just foul.' She said as I did my best to de-slime her lunch.'

'...And it's not what you need just before you leave, I know, I know.' I finished for her, zipping up her lunch bag and offering it back to her. 'I'll fix it babe, I promise.'

She sighed, and I saw her frustration deflate a little. 'You better. There's something furry on the middle shelf, and the vegetable drawer is like War of the Worlds.'

With that we got the last of her bits together, and I gallantly wheeled her suitcase to the front door. 

'You've got four days James. Don't let me down, okay? I'll call you when I'm at the airport.' She said, giving me a quick peck on the lips. Her coat buttons pressed into the bare skin of my belly.

'Trust me babe, I'll get it done.' I said, giving her one last squeeze as she stepped outside.

Half-hiding myself behind the door I waved her off, watching her car disappear over the hill towards the airport. The moment it was gone I turned back towards the bedroom, private browsing on my mind and the fridge already forgotten.

Five hours later I wandered into the kitchen for a drink. With my eyes on my phone I didn't see the open fridge door until I'd already headbutted it and sent it bouncing off the counter. I stumbled back and slipped on something cold and slimy, sending me crashing down to the linoleum floor. 

'What the fuck!' I shouted at nothing in particular.

As the pain receded from my forehead and tailbone I opened my eyes and took stock of what had happened. The fridge door was open, the motor inside letting out a chunky-sounding whine, and hanging limply at eye level was a thin, meaty-looking string of some sort. It was looped over the milk in the fridge door, and led all the way down to the bottom of my sock where whatever I'd stepped on was still soaking through. With a faint sense of horror I turned my foot towards me, and saw the remains of a potato the length of my thumb mushed into the fabric. 

'Oh that's fucking gross...'

Wincing I peeled the half-brown mass off the sole of my foot which disturbed the root or shoot, whatever it is that rotting potatoes grow, and the freezing cold length of it collapsed flaccidly onto my chest and neck. I spasmed in repulsion, flailing at it to get it off my skin as if it was a rubbery spider web, sending it flopping onto the floor. Another shiver went through me and I pulled myself painfully to my feet.

Inside the fridge, from a bag of potatoes that I'd bought with the best of cooking intentions, was a bulging mass of thin red strands bursting from the plastic like the questing tendrils of some demonic fungus. A few were like wispy hair, while others were as thick as my little finger with growths and knuckles jutting off the sides. The sheer volume of them had pushed the vegetable drawer open, and presumably the fridge door with it, spilling out the rotten spud I'd slipped on. For a few moments I just stared at the tentacles of plant matter, mind trying to wrap itself around what I was seeing, before I suddenly decided to slam the door shut. The fridge light disappeared, and with it the disgusting sight.

'Nope. Nu-uh, not tonight.' I said to myself, kicking the wet stalk of the crushed potato away from me. 

Cramming the fridge door shut I turned and walked out of the kitchen. I knew the cleaning job would get worse the longer I left it of course, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Once I'd nursed my aching tailbone I'd get right on it. I still had three days after all.

It was the early morning when the noise woke me. The unreality of my dream still clung to me as I surfaced, confused about what had disturbed me. The fan from my PC hummed gently to itself, but there was another sound hiding behind it as if hoping to sneak past unnoticed. I closed my eyes, hoping that whatever it was would sort itself out and I could go back to sleep, but then I heard it again. Something moving downstairs.

Much more awake at that. Realising how alone I was, I climbed out of bed and padded towards the stairs listening as hard as I could, missing Rachel's comforting presence and feeling exposed and foolish. The sound came again, the soft noise of something small shifting about. My mind moved from intruders to rats, and I let out a hiss through clenched teeth. If we have rats then it'll be Rachel's last staw. There was no choice, I had to go and see. Blearily I shuffled down to the living room and began shining my phone light around the place searching for any hint of rat activity, whatever that would look like. The coffee table knick-knacks were undistubed, no signs of fur or tiny teeth marks in the furniture, but then the torchlight caught the edge of something shiny.

It was a trail of slime, about as thick as my thumb, coming from under the armchair over the carpet, and leading to the open kitchen door. Beyond that I could see the sickly yellow light from the open fridge illuminating the countertops, and again came the distressed whine of the motor trying to cool the open machinery. I stopped, taking in the scene. Can rats open fridges?

I bent to examine the slime. It was brown and glistened wetly under the white light of my phone, spread in a thin layer that gave off the smell of rotting plants. It looked cold, though I didn't dare touch it. I followed it across the living room and into the kitchen, where the trail ended at the base of the humming refridgerator. That wasn't what shocked me though, what made me stop to take a breath was that from the innards of the fridge spilled out a knotted red tangle, the wet sprouting roots of the potatoes now dangling out like the gutted intenstines of the appliance. A number of the brown things had rolled out onto the floor, lank roots splayed out like spider's legs.

'Oh fuck that. Fuck that...' I whispered to myself, backing out of the horrific kitchen scene.

Without looking where I was going though I stepped in the trail of slime on the living room floor, the slick substance cold against my bare skin. I stifled a yell but managed to drop my phone, which bounced off the carpet and landed flash-side down, leaving me with nothing but the ambient light coming from the kitchen to see by. Stunned by my own incompetence and gritting my teeth from the revolting substance on my sole, I sat for a moment, torn between crossing the room in the dark for the lightswitch, or simply fumbling under the chair for my phone. As I stood there stupidly in the pitch black though I heard that sound again. A soft, almost squelchy noise, and realised with horror that it was coming from directly above me.

Slowly I knelt and pawed at the floor for my phone, not moving my gaze away from the patch of darkness above me that had made the noise. I wanted to move, to back away from whatever this thing was., but I found my feet rooted to the spot as if I was under the gaze of some consealed predator that would pounce should I turn and run. I wasn't even considering that it was rats any more, rats don't climb walls. I didn't know what I was afraid of, all I knew was that it was the primal fear fear of something dangerous in the dark. Finally, my fingers found the rubber of my phone case, and I jerked back up, clutching it like a talisman.

For a moment there was nothing. The room was empty, silent, full of sharp shadows in the unforgiving flash of my phone. Then I pointed it upwards, following the slime trail up the wall, the horror inside me growing as I realised that it tracked across the ceiling until there I saw it. Right above my head and suspended by four girthy red roots, was a baking potato.

It came to a shivering halt in the white spotlight. Soft brown spots covered its beige surface, the forgotten vegitable half-rotten. Each of its glistening tendrils must have been at least two feet long, and they clung to the popcorn ceiling with hair-like protrusions that burgeoned from their rooty length. For a moment my mind ground uselessly against the sight like a misaligned gears, the absurdity too much to bear. Slowly, the flattest surface of the potato came to rest facing me. I had just a single moment to remember _potatoes grow towards light!_ before the roots detached, one by one, and the monstrous thing fell on me.

Immediately the cold, hard sprouts wound around my face and body. Somewhere between flesh and wood they began immediately to squeeze, the sheer power of them shocking. The potato itself landed directly on my face, hitting my nose like a fist and latching on. Already I was scrabbling, pulling at the stringy roots and shouting inchoherantly. The spout around my neck took advantage of my open mouth and shot the tip of its tentacle in, hairy protrusions searching for my spit and sucking my tongue dry in seconds. Horrified I bit down, and was rewarded by the fibrous thing thrashing as my teeth ground against the tough plant matter.

Two red roots wound around my wrists, binding them together as I attacked the potato itself. My first thought had been to crush the damn thing, but beyond sinking a finger an inch into a mushy spot the rest held firm. I'd forgotten how hard a raw potato was, and now I was losing a fight to one. Desperately I lurched to the kitchen, slipping my way across the slimy linoleum towards the kitchen knives. A second set of roots wound around my ankle as I went, painfully tight, and the weight of another potato bounced against my foot as I grabbed for the largest plastic handle in the block. The potato on my face was choking me with its thin red tendrils, and so unable to attack it properly I engaged in an exaggerated two-handed shaving-motion, swiping the blade parallel to my cheeks to avoid stabbing myself and doing the demon tuber's work for them. The cheap blade barely bit, the dull metal finding its match in the thick potato skin and only cutting off thin chips intead of the butchery I needed.

Scuttling sounds from all around now, shadows moving within shadows from every wall and surface in the kitchen. There must have been half a dozen, all alerted by the moisture of my body and ready to attack. I suddenly felt a third vegitable land hard against my back, its ropey sprouts looping around my throat and instantly beginning to crush. The one around my ankle managed to lash my other leg, binding them together and sending me crashing to my kitchen floor. Mercifully I didn't fall on the knife, but the impact knocked it from my hands and sent it spinning out of reach. It had only been a few moments, but already my vision was darkening around the edges as I thrashed on the floor, managing nothing more helpful than kicking the sink cabinet off its hinges.

_I'm going to die. Murdered by posessed potatoes that tied me up on my own kitchen floor..._

They were closing in then, the unearly sound of potatoes coming in for the kill the last thing I would ever hear. The room was full of squirming red ropes. My thoughts become less coherant as my brain ran out of oxygen, and as my kicking became more feeble my heel caught something that spun up my body and landed behind my neck. A cool, trickling sensation spread across my bare skin.
_Goopy_  Was the last thing my mind offered me as I slipped beneath the darkness...

All at once consciousness came rushing back. I sat up, cough-screaming as the tendrils around my neck suddenly released. My hands were still bound near my face and the second potato had my ankles in an iron grip, but the one that had been strangling me was thrashing wildly in a small puddle of blue goo like a demented spider. Its tendrils whipped wildly around before the potato finally shuddered and fell still.

Blinking stars from my eyes I tried to take in what had happened. Something had gotten onto the demonic thing, something that had finally killed it. Then the smell hit me. Bleach! It was bleach, the bottle that I'd lost the cap to months ago! Looking around wildly I found the bottle lying on its side and dove for it just as a large jacket potato pounced on my chest.My hand clasped the bottle as I landed, the dreaded thing squirming beneath me. Two more impacts on my back, but I focused on jamming the nozzle under my chest and blasting the blue gel onto the wretched potato. With a shudder it fell still, though slick roots were now winding around my chest and arms from behind. I gripped the bottle of bleach and let out a defiant scream, spraying a blue stream blindly over my left shoulder until I felt the grip slacken.

Two more scuttling towards me. My hand was slipping aginst the floor, skidding out from under me as I tried to rise, leaving me staring up at the potatoes that were bearing down on me like giant spasmodic insects. I managed to bring the bottle up and hit the first with a jet, sending it tumbling fowards with its flaccid roots across my neck. The second was on me though, binding my wrist and squeezing so hard I swore it was going to snap. I just barely got the nozzle against the thing and squeezed. With the sound of a wet fart the bottle blasted the last of its bleach into the beige monster, and it fell still. 

Silence and stillness. My nose and skin burned with the chemicals, and I slowly pulled myself to my knees. A pale root slid limly from my shoulder and plopped onto the floor. I took a deep, shuddering breath. 

Within a heartbeat I felt tendrils wrap around my head, the potato against my mouth, quivering hairs reaching for the moisture in my eye. With a yell I did the only thing I could think of and wrapped my bleach-covered hands around the wretched thing to pull. It shuddered and squirmed beneath my slimy grip. For a moment it seemed that it would get me, I could feel something wriggling under my eyelid, when all at once the potato skin gave way. I crushed it , mash spewing out between my fingers as I let out a roar of triumph! At last, the whole lot of them were dead.

After I'd collected myself I stood and shut the fridge door, finally giving the straining motor some rest. Switichg on the main light I surveyed the carnage. Brown slime and blue bleach covered every surface, and even some bright  spots of my blood. Half-mangled potatoes lay everywhere, their limp red roots trailing like the hair of murder victims on the wet linoleum. I let out a sob, not sure what else to do, and following my instincts went to turn and go to bed, hoping to forget this whole thing.
Something stopped me though. Whether it was guilt or simple self-preservation I found myself stopping and turning on the kitchen light. In a daze I went to the sink and wiped the worst of the bleach off me before grabbing cloths and a bin bag and beginning to clean. All the dead potatoes were cleared away, the surfaces wiped, the floor made spotless. I even sorted the fridge, wiping out the last of the slime left by the veggie hoard. By the time I finished the sky outside was being bruised by the first hint of Sunlight, but as I stood at looked at the spotless kitchen I felt a real sense of pride.

'Shower.' I muttered to mysefl. 'Shower, then sleep...'

The thought of calling the police trundled through my mind as I climbed upstairs, but I dismissed it. What would I even say? Instead I pulled out my phone to message Rachel. She'd be in her hotel by now, and even if she didn't believe me she'd find it funny and be happy the kitchen was clean. Opening the app and was surprised to see a message waiting for me already, and smiled as I opened it. What I read though made my blood turn cold.

_'Hi babe, arrived safe. Hope the cleaning is going well! Not happy with you though, I just got to the hotel and found a mouldy old potato in my lunch bag! I still love you but we're having words when I get back x'_

With shaking fingers I dialled her number, memories of a slimy beige object in the open zip of her bag materialising in my mind. The phone rang, and rang, and rang.
