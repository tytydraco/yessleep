I was bored. The kind of bored that makes you scroll through endless pages of nothing, hoping something—anything—will catch your eye. It was a Friday night, and my friends were all busy with their own lives. I’d already binged through my usual horror podcasts, and nothing new was popping up. Just the same old ghost stories and urban legends I’d heard a thousand times before. I was about to log off when it happened.  

A single instant message popped up on my screen.  

**AnonymousUser42:** *Hey. You like horror, right? Check this out. The Scariest Podcast Ever.*  

Below the message was a link. No greeting, no explanation, just a hyperlink staring back at me like a dare. I hesitated for a moment. I didn’t recognize the username, and the link looked… off. It wasn’t from any of the usual podcast platforms I used. But curiosity got the better of me. I clicked it.  

The page loaded slowly, a stark black background with white text. There was only one episode, titled *“The Hunt.”* It was 47 minutes long. No description, no host name, no artwork—just a play button and a list of reviews. Every single one was five stars.  

*“You just have to experience it!”* one review said.  

*“Scariest thing I’ve ever listened to!”* another claimed.  

I shrugged and hit play.  

The voice that came through my headphones was robotic, monotone, and utterly lifeless. It droned on about a creature—something ancient and hungry—that hunted its prey with a methodical precision. The setup was cliché, and I almost turned it off. But then it mentioned my school.  

*“The creature caught the scent at Westwood High,”* the voice said. *“It knew, from that moment, who its next victim would be.”*  

My stomach dropped. Westwood High was *my* school. I told myself it was a coincidence, but the podcast kept going. It described a teenager—a boy who sounded a lot like me. He had my height, my hair color, even my habit of biting his nails when he was nervous. The podcast detailed his day: how he stopped at Starbucks after school, hung out with friends at the park, and came home to an empty house.  

Every detail matched my day exactly.  

I froze. My heart pounded in my chest as the podcast continued. The creature was stalking the boy, following him from place to place. It described the park where I’d been with my friends, the street I’d walked down, even the way I’d hesitated before unlocking my front door.  

*“The creature is patient,”* the voice said. *“It waits until the boy is alone. Until the house is quiet. Until the night is still.”*  

I glanced at my bedroom door. It was closed, but I could’ve sworn I heard something downstairs. A faint creak, like the floorboards shifting under weight. I told myself it was just the house settling.  

The podcast continued.  

*“The creature enters the house. It moves silently, its pale, emaciated form gliding through the shadows. It climbs the stairs, one by one, each step a deliberate act of malice.”*  

I heard it. The stairs creaked, just like the podcast said they would. My breath caught in my throat. I wanted to stop listening, to rip off my headphones and run, but I couldn’t. I was paralyzed, my fingers gripping the edge of my desk as the voice droned on.  

*“The creature reaches the boy’s room. It pauses, savoring the moment. The door opens, and the air changes. The boy feels it—a shift, a presence. He knows he’s not alone.”*  

I felt it too. The air in my room grew heavy, oppressive. My door didn’t move, but I could’ve sworn it was open. I could feel something in the room with me, something just out of sight.  

*“The creature approaches. It leans in close, its breath warm against the boy’s neck. It’s ready to strike.”*  

I felt it. Warm breath on the back of my neck. I screamed and spun around, but there was nothing there. Just my empty room, bathed in the dim glow of my computer screen.  

And then the power went out.  

For a split second, my monitor went black, and I saw it. Reflected in the screen, standing right behind me, was something I can’t fully describe. It was naked and pale, its skin stretched taut over a skeletal frame too large for its body. Its eyes were pitch black, hollow voids that seemed to swallow the light. Its mouth was wide open, filled with rows of razor-sharp teeth.  

I turned around, but it was gone. The power came back on a moment later, and I was alone.  

I tried to find the podcast again, but the link was gone. The instant message had disappeared, and the user account no longer existed. I searched for hours, scouring every podcast platform I could think of, but I never found it.  

That was three years ago. I still think about it sometimes, late at night when the house is quiet and the shadows seem too deep. I don’t know what that thing was or why it chose me. All I know is that I survived.  

But I can’t stop wondering how the story ends.  

And if I ever find that podcast again, I’ll leave it a five-star review.
