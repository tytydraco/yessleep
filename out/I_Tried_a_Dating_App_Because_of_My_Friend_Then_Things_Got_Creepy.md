I never thought I’d feel pressured to date.  
My friend and his girlfriend are always joking, nudging me:  
“Come on, you need to find someone too!”  
She laughs, he grins, as if it’s their mission to finally set me up.

I’m the quiet type—shy, reserved. I don’t just approach women or start conversations. I like talking when it happens naturally, but all this online dating, swiping and rating… it was never me.

Still, I downloaded the app. Just to show I was trying.  
I filled out the profile honestly but plainly. No filters, no poses, no cheesy lines. Just me.

Then I waited.

Weeks passed. Nothing. No likes, no messages. I started doubting myself—maybe I was too boring, too plain. Maybe my friend was right: you had to be loud, flashy, get attention.

And then, one evening, when I wasn’t expecting anything, a notification appeared.  
**“New message.”**

The name: **Lena**.  
Profile picture: a young woman with dark hair, a warm smile, and a presence that immediately drew attention.  
She didn’t look like a typical, over-polished app profile. Real. Natural. Only… her eyes. There was something in them. Attentive, intense. Like she knew things she couldn’t possibly know.

“Hey :)” she wrote.  
I stared at the message for minutes before replying.  
“Hey. How’s it going?”

At first, it was harmless.  
Small talk about everyday life, hobbies, series. She replied fast, sometimes even before I finished typing.  
I thought nothing of it. Maybe she was just eager to talk to someone who answered.

But after a few days, I noticed her messages were… too precise.  
Too attentive.

“Nice sweater today,” she wrote once.  
I reread it.  
I had never told her what I was wearing. No picture sent. Nothing.

“How do you know that?” I typed.  
“Just a guess :)” she replied.  
I laughed nervously. Maybe coincidence.

But it happened again.

“You’re outside right now, aren’t you?”  
I looked around. I actually was, on the parking lot after work.  
“How do you know that?”  
“I like guessing,” came back.

I tried to brush it off. Maybe she stalked my profile, looking for clues in old pictures. Maybe she was just a little too curious.  
But then the next message came:

“You look tired. Sleep well tonight.”

I was alone in my room. My phone was on the desk, I was sitting on the bed.  
I typed: “How do you know that?”  
No answer.

The next days, she got even more direct.  
“Are you alone?”  
“What are you doing?”  
“I want you to tell me everything.”

I felt uneasy. Her tone wasn’t threatening—soft, almost gentle—but insistent. Too close.  
I started replying less, sometimes ignoring her messages. But it didn’t seem to matter.

Then she said things that really unsettled me:

“I can see you.”  
“You’re in front of your house, aren’t you?”  
“Why don’t you come outside?”

I checked everything. No one was there. No one could have told her.

The messages didn’t stop. I felt watched, followed. A friend joked, “Maybe she’s just clingy.”  
I wanted to laugh, but inside I knew: this was more. Much more.

That night, I sat on my bed, phone in hand. A new message appeared:

“I’m waiting outside.”

I didn’t dare look. I just knew she meant it. And I had no idea how she knew where I was.

I considered blocking her. But something held me back. Maybe curiosity. Maybe this feeling that she… was real.

From that point on, everything felt off.  
Whenever I came home at night, I felt like someone was near. Footsteps, a shadow in my peripheral vision, a sound I couldn’t explain.  
I told myself I was imagining it.

Then came more messages.  
No texts, only pictures.

The first: my street.  
Empty, evening shot.  
The second: my house.  
Then my window.

I felt my stomach tighten. I ran outside, checked everything. Nothing. No traces. No one.

I double-locked my door, closed the curtains, deleted the app.  
But the next day, her chat was back.  
A new message:  
“Why are you running?”

I couldn’t sleep. I deleted my profile completely, even changed my number.  
For a few days, it was quiet. No messages. No signs.  
I started to relax.

Until yesterday.

I was on my way home, late, maybe half past eleven. Empty streets, dim streetlights, almost no traffic.  
And then, in the rearview mirror, a car.  
A black vehicle, no front plate.

I tried not to pay attention. But after several turns, it was still there.  
At the next intersection, it stayed behind me again.  
Then, suddenly, it turned off.

I exhaled.

At home, I checked my phone. No new messages. I set it aside, about to turn off the lights—then it vibrated.  
A new message. No number, no name. Only:

“Nice car.”

I stared at the screen.  
Then at the window.

No one was there.

But somewhere out there, in the dark—I knew—it was someone who knew exactly where I lived.

I have no idea how she does it.  
I have no idea who she really is.

But I know she’s watching.  
And she won’t stop...
