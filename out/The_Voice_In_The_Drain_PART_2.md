Hey guys, I really appreciate the support on my previous post. As much as it sucks to relive all of this, it makes me happy that some people are getting something out of it. The biggest concern I have with sharing all of this is the risk of my Dad seeing it. My parents had a very different picture of what happened my freshman year of college. My recounts to them explaining my presence in the hospital had something to do with a garbage disposal. I spoke very defensively then, so they didn’t ask many questions. Don’t really have my mom to worry about, but if you see this dad then I’m sorry for lying, and I’m sorry for never telling mom. 

With that aside, Ive taken some time and gathered the rest of my thoughts (to the best of my ability) from my time with the shower. With all the nightmares I am getting after typing this out, I sure hope it comes to some sort of fruition (Maybe I should email my editor again).  

After my return to the shower, I did better in school. I even caught myself offering to lead a study group for my history class. That study group veered into one-on-one study sessions with someone that were becoming more dates than anything else. My first dates in years. I lost more weight too, every time I looked in the mirror, I seemed to look more and more like myself from 2 years ago. Healthier, happier, and better. 

The weeks following my second turn in the shower was when I realized the effects weren’t permanent. Both times I used it, things seemed to go less well for me after a few weeks. Two weeks after my second shower, I knew my spell was wearing off when my friend missed our study date. No text. No nothing. It hit me then, that I had to keep using it. I knew she had to have seen some new flaw or defect in me. Something was wrong with me that drove her away. I had to keep going back and draining it out.  The rot seemed to build up even after using the shower, which required me to do it regularly to stay better. So, I had to etch that horrific process into my routine.  

Every Wednesday I would wake up freakishly early and participate in my ritual. I learned to tense my body while the rot was being expelled. It hurt way more, but it pushed it out faster. I returned from the shower lighter and lighter every time. My friend came to our next study dates, but something was different in how she spoke to me. One night she even stopped mid-sentence and gave me a strange look before asking if I was okay, I stopped showing up after that. I passed the point of my target weight, and my ribs began to poke through my skin when I inhaled. The mirror became my enemy again, as every time I looked into it my eyes had visibly sunk further into my skull and my shoulders had grown narrower.  My showers had become so frequent that my skin had no time to recover. It was constantly red and enflamed, and it itched horribly. My scalp was no different, and tufts of hair started to linger on my towels and pillowcases.  I couldn't let anyone see me like that. Lecture attendance dwindled then ceased altogether. My life became my showers. The time in between only served as a cooldown period before I could do it again. 

This is where I should have stopped, I should have realized the harm I was causing myself and cut the ritual off. Let me be clear, I knew how bad it was for me, it just felt worth it. There was a moment, after every shower, where I would be released from the hot water and would collapse on the cold tile in relief, briefly suspended in a state of euphoria. That sense of betterness consuming me before quickly dwindling. It was a fraction of what I was getting at first. But it still felt like more than what I had before any of this started.  

Each ritual's effects wore off in shorter and shorter time frames. I found myself using it once, twice a day. On my rare pilgrimages out of my room I always donned myself in my old hoodies and they fit me like cloaks. They kept my skin hidden if anyone were unlucky enough to catch a glimpse of me. Leached of energy, the gaps in between showers consisted entirely of sleeping with an occasional trip to a vending machine down the hall. My care-free attitude progressed into a dazed, emotionless state. I didn’t dream when I slept, it was a deep cold sleep that was only interrupted by a biting, aching need for that hot water on my skin. I began to crave the sensation of my pores expanding. I yearned for the sound of my guilt, shame, and sickness plinking against the tile and washing away.  

I could barely get out of bed that morning. My spindly legs were getting more and more stiff and less and less dependable. I slowly shifted my weight off of my bed and onto my feet. I felt my joints, rid of cartilage, etch into each other and groan. Wincing through the pain, I tested my balance and took a few trial steps and decided I could make it to the shower. That was all that seemed to matter.   

I shakily stepped into the stall and shut the latch behind me. I teetered into the center of the shower and locked my eyes on the drain. There weren't clear thoughts at this point. At least not ones that I can remember. Just a fog fueled by an endless desire. But, as I stared past the drain and at the darkness lingering below it, a thought came to me: 

This one will kill you. You turn that handle, and you are dead. 

“What are you doing? Why are you just standing there?” 

The words bubbled up angrily while also trying to maintain an endearing tone. It was so weird to hear it speak again. As soon as the first word sprang from the pipe part of me wanted to immediately turn on the shower and drown it out, getting the process over with. I rested my hand on the knob but couldn't bring myself to twist it. I didn't want to die. As shitty as everything got and as my mistakes piled up there were more than a few times I thought of dying. I’d daydream about the nothingness while also praying that my pathetic state didn’t land me in hell. But now that death was right there, a muzzle suspended above me, I didn't want it. I waited, trying to muster coherent thoughts to tell me what to do next. I Could feel its impatience. 

“You are hesitating. Why.” 

I whipped my head towards the drain. Its voice. It had become gravely and choppy. It was higher pitched and intense. Its voice had shed the humanity it had just moments before, and it was replaced with something more primal. I could tell it was angry; it spoke abruptly. But the worst part was how close and how loud it was. The words were spit from the drain almost as if its lips lingered just under the grate. I was disgusted. Disgusted that I had gone on for this long. That I had let this... thing rule my life. I didn't know what I wanted at that moment. I was so empty and so broken that I stayed frozen above the drain, in terror of my circumstances.  

“This is what is best for you. For us. Even if you don't see it. You are still in pain. Let me help you.”  

The words themselves were intended to be consolations, but each one sounded like it was put through a woodchipper before my ears received it. I stayed frozen, hand still on the knob, bile bubbling in my stomach. My hand began to move, I almost didn't notice at first, but I felt my wrist tinge and saw the knob turning on its own. I protested and tried to twist it back, but it persisted. It may have been how weak I was, but I failed to slow its progress at all. Didn't stop me from trying, fussing and grunting as I fought. “Please please please please please” It had been the first time I had spoken in days, weeks maybe, and the words had to slither through a buildup of mucus and stagnation. By the time they came out of my mouth, they had dwindled to a whisper. I remember starting to feel the water burn my skin, then nothing.  

I came to and found myself on the floor, limbs at odd angles and unable to correct them. The shower was still on but the water was freezing. The tile was so cold that I couldn't feel the skin on my back and thighs. I was even more powerless than before, it took all of my energy to keep my eyes open, everything in me was ready to slip away. With no other movements possible, I locked my eyes on the drain and attempted to maintain my ragged breathing. It must have heard me, because it spoke again, reverting to its smooth voice. Except the patronizing tone was replaced by a gloating omniscience.  


“I lied before, Luis, your rot isn’t what weighs you down. It’s what’s left of you. Your attachments, regrets, failures, you treat them like ailments. But look at you Luis, do you feel better? Now that I’ve drained you of every last bit of rot?”    

I could feel it reveling in its captive audience.  

“There’s nothing left but a hollow, starving freak. I bet you would do anything to feel something again, Luis, good or bad. But you didn’t want it, you cast away the only thing that made you you. Now it will consume you, Luis.” 

 Sounds of gurgles and sloshing built up behind its voice and eventually took over entirely. Small black splatters erupted from below the grate and landed on the tile. This continued and became more violent, shooting out in a runny liquid then congealing as soon as it hit the floor. The pieces beaded and seemed to travel on their own towards one another, assimilating into a large blob.   

 
“I kept it. I kept all of it right here. This is where your end of the deal comes up. Your rot is what is of value to me, and I have it all. What is splayed out on the floor is useless to me, save for your flesh. Your flesh will be a vessel and the inkling of consciousness you have left will dissolve. The rot will have the control you should have given it a long time ago.”  

 
The remaining sludge had been expelled and joined the rest. It congealed into an imperfect ball and twitched a few times before teetering towards my leg. It sagged against the tile as it rolled like a deflated soccer ball. My eyes widened as it closed the distance between us. A primal fear washed over me and cleared some of the fog. I tried to kick, begging my frail legs to move. They produced more movement than I would have thought. I was able to slowly inch my legs away, only delaying the inevitable. It had almost caught up to me.  

 
“Don't fight it Luis, let it finish what you started, embrace every last bit of it.”  

 
It collided with my skin and softened, morphing around my skin. It was endlessly cold. It singed me as it slowly engulfed more of my calf. Once it had wrapped itself around my leg it began to widen and cover more and more of my skin. The cold from the rot worsened as it spread and made my skin pringle so intensely that it felt like it was bubbling. Bubbling and evaporating.  The primal fear I felt before multiplied and I further compelled my limbs to react. After spending a few moments having to watch powerlessly as it slowly smothered my skin, I was capable of movement again. I stiffened my arms and slowly rolled my weight against the wall, trying to bring my hands closer to it.  

 
“Stop, Luis. Stop fighting for a life you hate. You wasted the chance you had. You don't deserve to keep going.” 

 
I heard the words but didn’t internalize them. I left them in the drain where they came from. I focused on the mass consuming my leg and dug my fingers into it. It instantly glazed my fingers and clung to my palm. I tried to rip it away from my leg. It released from my calf revealing pink skin covered in small boils. It was dissolving my skin. The same effervescent cold took over my right hand and the sludge persisted in spreading. Past my wrist and encroaching on my forearm. I kept ripping it off and it kept sticking. I traded it in between my hands, desperately trying to get it off of me. A guttural gurgle resounded from the drain. 

 
“Stop Luis. Stop Luis. Stop Luis.” 

 
It started with its happy cadence and let it be corrupted further every time it said it. Eventually the words became so guttural and strained that it just sounded like groans and gurgles from the water flushing through the plumbing. 

 
Realizing my efforts were fruitless, I stopped and took in the sight of my right hand being withered away. I still wasn’t ready to die. I wanted to keep going. But it was right, there wasn’t much of me left. I was hollow, lifeless, and barely able to think straight. What had almost finished absorbing my right hand was apparently what was missing. What made me complete. Maybe I can take it back, I thought, take it back inside me. I couldn't stop it from consuming me, but maybe I could consume it first. The thought became more and more disgusting as it took form. What I had to do was revolting, but it was my only choice. 

 
I raised my right hand that had dwindled to a stump and brought it to my mouth. The sludge had begun traveling down my arm, trying to take more. I dug my teeth into it, feeling the cold radiate through my gums. Once it entered my mouth it felt formless, electric and sharp like tv static. It was extremely salty, and I salivated uncontrollably as soon as it touched my tongue. I took in as much as I thought I could handle and held in my mouth. I tried to chew but it didn't get any smaller. My esophagus spasmed, begging me to expel the savory sludge. I retaliated and swallowed, it didn't budge at first, but I felt it trickle down my throat and into my stomach.  After a few moments, my mouthful was gone.  

 
The drain protested by getting louder. No words were intelligible, just fierce pockets of anger being spat out of the pipes. I ignored it and looked back at my hand, the job far from finished.  Slowly, I tore off pieces with my teeth and swallowed them, fighting through constant heaving, endless saliva, and tears of pain and exhaustion. I swallowed the last large piece and took a few moments to run my teeth under my fingernails and in every crevice that I could imagine the rot hiding. I finished and swallowed that too.  

 
The drain quieted and then stopped altogether.  It resumed its position as a humble receptacle, drinking away the water without protest. My stomach bulged; I had consumed more in the last few minutes than I had in the previous two months.  I could feel it inside me, pulsing, moving, spreading. I could feel that thick chill flowing through my veins. I looked at my right hand. It had dwindled to a pink, withered palm supporting a few fragments of fingers. I relinquished a deep sigh and tilted my head towards the ceiling. I didn't know how to feel. I thought maybe I would still die, that maybe the rot could still kill me from where it was. Maybe even if I lived, I’d remain the husk of a man I had become. I didn't know what would happen when I stepped out of the stall, with my sins nestled deep inside me. But there was only one way to find out.
