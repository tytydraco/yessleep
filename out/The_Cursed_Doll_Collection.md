I always loved visiting my grandmother's house. She had a room filled with antique dolls that I found fascinating. The dolls were beautiful, with intricate details and lifelike features. I would often spend hours playing with them, imagining their stories and adventures.

One summer, my parents went on vacation and left me in my grandmother's care. I was excited to spend more time with my grandmother and her dolls. However, strange things started happening as soon as I arrived.

On my first night there, I heard footsteps outside my room. I thought it was my grandmother checking on me, so I called out to her, but there was no answer. The footsteps continued, getting louder and closer to my door. I was too scared to move, so I hid under my covers until the sound stopped.

The next day, I went to the doll room to play with the dolls, but I felt like I was being watched. Every time I turned around, I felt like something was there, but when I looked, there was nothing. I tried to ignore the feeling and continued playing with the dolls, but I couldn't shake the feeling of unease.

That night, I woke up to find that my bedroom door was open. I was sure I had closed it before I went to bed, so I got up to investigate. As I walked down the hallway, I heard whispers coming from the doll room. I hesitated, but my curiosity got the better of me, and I peeked inside.

There was no one there, but the dolls were arranged in a different position. I thought it was strange but dismissed it as my imagination. I went back to bed, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

The next day, I woke up to find that my hair had been cut while I was sleeping. I was terrified and didn't know what to do. I told my grandmother, but she dismissed it as a prank and told me not to worry.

That night, I woke up to find that the dolls had moved from their original positions. They were now arranged in a circle around my bed, their lifeless eyes staring at me. I tried to scream, but no sound came out of my mouth. The dolls started moving towards me, and I could feel their cold, lifeless hands around my neck I struggled to break free, but the dolls' grip was too strong. I could feel their fingers digging into my skin, and their eyes seemed to glow with an otherworldly light. I was sure that I was going to die, but suddenly, the dolls stopped moving and retreated back to their original positions.

I lay there, gasping for breath and covered in sweat. I was too scared to move, too scared to even blink. I lay there until morning, too afraid to close my eyes and go back to sleep.

The next day, I told my grandmother what had happened, but she didn't believe me. She told me that I was just having nightmares and that the dolls couldn't have moved on their own. But I knew what I had seen, and I knew that something was wrong with those dolls.

Over the next few days, more strange things happened. Objects would move on their own, doors would open and close, and I would hear strange noises coming from the doll room. I tried to tell my grandmother, but she still didn't believe me.

Then one night, I woke up to find that the dolls had come to life. They were moving around the room, whispering to each other in a language that I couldn't understand. I tried to scream, but no sound came out of my mouth. The dolls started moving towards me, and I could feel their cold, lifeless hands around my neck once again.

But this time, I was ready. I had a plan. I remembered that my grandmother had a book of spells in her study. I managed to break free from the dolls' grip and ran to the study. I found the book and started reading the incantations.

Suddenly, the dolls stopped moving. They froze in place, and their eyes lost their otherworldly glow. I knew that I had broken the curse.

The next day, I told my grandmother what had happened, and she finally believed me. She got rid of the dolls, and I never saw them again. But I still have nightmares about them, and I can still feel their cold, lifeless hands around my neck.
