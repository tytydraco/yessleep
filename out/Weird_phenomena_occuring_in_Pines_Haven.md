I've never been much of a traveling guy, but driving around the countryside, especially when it was foggy, was weirdly therapeutic to me. Going between towns and exploring the area around my hometown was a pretty unique experience, and I've seen some landmarks here and there that I've marked on my personal map, in case I ever want to return to these places, but it's never been anything special or intriguing enough to me. I guess today was the day that something interesting finally happened, which would honestly be an understatement.

I've noticed that there was still an empty spot on my map, just waiting to be explored. Almost like that one bite of the sandwich that just hits different when you eat around it, if you know what I mean. Back to the point, I decided to take the rather empty road in the direction of this spot, not sure if I should expect a town (considering the amount that there were in the area), some trail, or just plain old road. Sure enough, some time passed, and I saw a sign. We were entering a town, called "Pines Haven". Next to it was a board that was probably meant to attract tourists, listing all the activities you could do here. Of course, I wanted to see what they were offering, and parked next to the board. (It was also a spot for a public bathroom.) The board mentioned that the town had a beautiful lake, preserved over the years to be in pristine condition. "Huh!" I thought. "I guess that would make sense as to why the spot seems to be so big on my map." I decided to get back in my car and drive into town.

I should probably mention by this point that it was VERY foggy. Like, abnormally foggy. The fog was much thicker than it normally was in my area. Not only was the road going into town empty, but so was the town itself. Now, I've played enough Silent Hill to know that I should have probably turned back the moment I noticed this, but the curiosity got the better of me. I've always wanted to just run alone in the fog or in generally cloudy weather, trying to immerse myself to SH's soundtrack. Don't question me, it just, felt like it would be cool. Parked my car, plopped on my headphones, played The Forest Trail, and started jogging through town. It felt... ominous. The stillness of the town was extremely eerie, and I felt like I wasn't alone. Nonetheless, I continued. Passing by onto Liebens St, I found a notification board with the town's map on it. I took it, and it seemed like I would run into a spaghetteria just down the street. I was quite hungry, and honestly craving some spaghetti, so I thought that it might be a good idea to sit down and order something. Luckily, I took my wallet with me from my car (I always carry my personal stuff around if I'm in a new town), so I wouldn't have to backtrack.

Arriving on the spot, I looked through the windows. Empty. Nobody there, not even cashiers. What's going on in this town? I walked around the streets a bit more, but there was nobody there. Nothing. Nadda. The laundromat? Empty. Post office? Empty, and also locked. There was a souvenir shop up ahead, and it was empty too, though there was something I could from there.. An official copy of the map. I took it, left 5 bucks on the counter, and got out of there. I put the town's copy of the map back on the board, and got into my car, deciding that I should probably explore a little bit more by driving around. I tried to go to the aformentioned lake, but... I couldn't. There were weird roadblocks, repairs, and at one point there was even an entire bridge, destroyed. I marked these on my map, and found that there really was no way to get to the lake unless I tried a different approach. Though the town offered more mysteries, driving around the streets trying to find at least 1 road that would get me a little further, I found apartment blocks that didn't even exist on the map. These areas of the town looked dilapidated, and while I didn't seem to notice it, the entire town as a whole looked like it needed a good cleaning, and in some cases much more. 

Thinking I was out of options, though I honestly was just really creeped out, I decided to go back the way I came, and think about the town more at home. I found their website, and sure enough, it was normal, and it was still growing pretty nicely, with a population of about \~20k, so I really can't explain why it was empty for me.

I've tried to forget about it, deeming it a lost cause, but it has been growing on me. I need to know what's up with this town. Should I go back there with more preparation and try investigating?
