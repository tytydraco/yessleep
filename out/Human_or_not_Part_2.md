"Now what is that?" I asked Jason 


Jason turned around and looked at it too.
It was made of muscles, had 2 hollow eye sockets and had a huge red and black eye in the middle , It looked just like the thing we were running from but smaller.


"Well this wasn't in the pendrive" Jason said


He then started walking towards it but suddenly the phone I gave him lit up making static noises. He looked at it for a second before tossing it towards me.


"Hold on to it while I check this thing out" he said to me.


*kill it*


*KILL IT*


I could hear it clearly, My arm was telling me to kill that thing. Jason didn't even look back though, It seems like I'm the only one who can hear it.


Jason got closer to it and its eye started looking towards him , He ignored that and continued walking towards it.


"Care to explain what that thing..... Dave is?" I asked him without getting closer.


"It's an unnatural-human hybrid." He replied


"You mean an unnatural and a human......did the deed?" I asked him confused.


"Well they did , But it didn't work. That thing is the result of injecting unnatural DNA into a human named Dave." He replied.


"Why would they inject unnatural DNA into a human?" I asked.


He ignored me and continued to walk towards it. 


"This thing.....Is Dave protecting it?" He asked as he looked towards the door.


"Why would it be protecting that thing?" I asked.


"It does look like an egg , Perhaps it's Dave's egg." He said.


"Do unnaturals even lay eggs? Cause humans definitely don-"


**BANG**


I was cut off by a banging noise on the door.


"Seems like Dave is trying to get in , We must get rid of this 'egg' as soon as possible" said Jason as he picked up a knife.


**BANG**


The door broke down , Dave was finally in.


"I'LL TAKE CARE OF DAVE, YOU KILL THAT 'EGG' " I yelled.


"IT GROWS BY IMPACT , SO CUT IT USING SOMETHING SHARP" He yelled back.


"GOT I-"


Dave lunged at me and pinned me to the ground before I could finish speaking. 


*Cut off its head*


Dave jumped back. Seems like other unnaturals can hear my arm too huh.


Dave started getting into a position to charge at me again , But this time I will be the one striking first.


I started running towards it , It started running towards me. Then it jumped at me.


I turned my left arm into a blade and slid below it , Then I used my arm to slice off both its legs.


It screamed in pain.


"No more running for you big boy" I said.


I ran towards it and jumped on it , Ready to cut off its head. It caught my leg and threw me into a wall. 


It then lunged at me using the force of its arms , It was much stronger than me in terms of raw strength. Then it grabbed my legs and arms with each of its arms , It pinned me to the wall again.


But this time , I couldn't move or defend myself. It's head got closer to mine , It opened its mouth full of teeth.


But its attention was diverted before it could bite me. Jason had stabbed the egg's eye using the [knife.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnnaturalUniverse/s/0pdEiP3lmg)
