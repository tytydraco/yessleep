[\[Part 3\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1h9dint/the_call_of_the_breach_part_3/)

“Creepy.”

Dark bags lined her green eyes, and Jamie paged through the first couple entries of the black diary with a furrowed brow in the small room that made up her ‘cell’. The parsonage was warm, thanks to the multiple small woodstoves that had been installed throughout the building, and yet I couldn’t shake an icy prickle that cut me to the heart every time I looked at my best friend’s pale face. She hadn’t slept much either, even with the cozy bedstead that came with her room, and a tray of food lay untouched on the nightstand close by. The window behind her had been boarded up, more for Jamie’s protection than to prevent an escape, but thin rays of fading light from the sunset trickled through in floating, bloody lines.

I switched my gaze to where Chris sat across from me, and his eyes reflected a grim sadness that crouched also in my chest like a leaden parasite.

*She looks like she just came off a four-day patrol.*

“It has to belong to Vecitorak.” Shifting in the armchair that took up my corner of the room, I rubbed at a patch of dirt on my pant leg in an effort to distract myself. “He’s getting bold, attacking in twilight before the sun goes down. For him to give me that, it can only mean something big is coming.”

“I guess so.” Jamie shook her head with a sigh and shut the book to pass it my way. “The freak writes about as well as he bathes. Figures you can understand it.”

I winced, and something in her emerald irises flickered with instant regret.

“Either way, you should definitely bring this to Adam.” She wiped her hands on both pantlegs as though to scrub off the sensation of touching the leathery cover. “Eve might be able to help decipher it. I’m sure they’ll want to do a thousand prayers over it first, but hey, it can’t hurt.”

Chris leaned forward in his chair. “More to the point, we need to consider how Vecitorak was able to find Hannah so easily. Sure, it could be coincidence, but I don’t think he operates that way. If I had to guess, I’d say our gates are being watched, which means we’ve got active Puppet recon units around Ark River as we speak.”

Jamie’s face twitched into a weak smirk, one reminiscent of her old self. “Could set the trees on fire to flush em out.”

In my head, I heard again the raspy voice of the shadowy figure, felt his wooden dagger in my ribs, smelled his rotted breath against my cheek.

*‘Your world will fall.’*

“Even if we could, they’re too smart for that.” I squeezed my eyes shut to ward off the shudder of cold memories. “He’s been able to keep most of his army out of sight somewhere, even the researchers’ drones can’t find them. The only reason we know he’s close is because of this.”

Above us, the church bell tolled in its white clapboard steeple to signal the end of the day, and the sealing of the fortress gates for the night. The sound reverberated inside my chest with a hollow, sad ache that made me want to cry for the way Jamie’s expression crumpled.

Dropping her gaze to her lap, Jamie picked at one thumbnail, which she’d almost torn down to the flesh, and angled her head at Chris. “How long do I have?”

“Roughly an hour.” Chris replied with a stoney grimness and poked at the nightstand with the toe of his boot.

Jamie’s hardened countenance slipped a little, and her eyes blinked in rapid succession to ward off the internal storm. “Guess I should have eaten breakfast, huh?”

*With any luck, you’ll get the chance.*

Leaving the diary on the nightstand, I rose to sit beside her on the bed. “We’re going to fight it. Chris said he’s going to represent you, and I can tell the court what really happened. There’s a real chance that you—”

“Don’t do that.” She didn’t respond to me, and instead narrowed both eyes at Chris with a pained grimace. “Don’t give her false hope. It’s cruel.”

For his part, Chris looked to his folded hands in resolved weariness. “She’s just trying to be kind, Lansen.”

She rolled her eyes at him and Jamie folded both arms across her chest with a cold edge to her tone. “And you’re trying to get yourself kicked out of the Assembly. You want to throw everything away, all the reforms, all the good you could do, for what? You know I don’t stand a snowball’s chance in hell.”

That produced a glare from Chris, the two locked in a sparring match of heated emotions from across the room, their eyes speaking volumes. “It’s the right thing to do.”

Jamie snorted, though something in her expression reflected pain, not venom, as if the words were just a mask she had to wear for the moment. “The right thing to do is to win. Always has been. Don’t be a pretentious fool, Dekker, just let the hangmen do their work.”

Chris’s lower jaw ground back and forth with animosity at her cutting words, but his eyes glistened, as though he wanted to leave the room even more so than I did. “Saving your life is not pretentious.”

For a moment, Jamie opened and shut her mouth, as if trying to find something to say, but her eyes welled with tears as they rested on his.

At her side, I shifted in place with discomfort.

*Man, this is hard to watch.*

Squeezing her eyes shut, Jamie gave my hand a gentle squeeze and nodded toward the door with a thin smile. “You need to go. This place is going to fill up with people soon, and if they get riled like before, you’d be an easy target. I’ll see you later, okay?”

“Jamie, come on, I can help—” I tried to protest, but she cut me off.

“No one can help me, Hannah.” Jamie shook her bleach blonde head, both green irises empty hollows of pain. “You can’t go back on your word to Peter, and someone has to face the noose for all that’s happened. With everything I’ve done, I can’t really say it’s undeserved.”

I threw a pleading glance at Chris in hopes he would allow me to stay, but I could see he too thought the same. More than anything, I didn’t want to walk away, to leave my best friend to her fate, but I could tell Jamie wanted to speak with Chris alone. Whatever she needed to say, I had a feeling it wouldn’t be good for either of us if I was still in the room.

*I can’t give up on her. She’s my best friend. She wouldn’t have walked away from me if I were in her shoes.*

Wrapping my arms around her shoulders, I gripped Jamie in a tight hug and fought the urge to cry. “Hang in there, alright? We’re going to figure this out. We . . . we have to stick together.”

She clung to me for a long minute, as if bracing herself for what was to come. “Thanks, Hannah.”

Tearing myself away from that room was the hardest thing I’d ever done, and I stumbled back outside into the chilly autumn breeze. I couldn’t think, couldn’t focus, my emotions welling, and all at once I found myself running through the darkened pathways between the cabins. Night had fallen quickly, the sky heavy with soot-black clouds, another rainstorm on its way. Many guards were out, both New Wilderness rangers in their forest green uniform jackets, and Ark River men in their camouflage-pattered armor cuirasses, no doubt patrolling to prevent another riot. They watched me run, but saw no one pursuing me, and let me go.

Unable to stop, I sprinted past cabins with the warm reflection of light in their windows from candles, tents where people without cabins bedded down for the night, and stables where our livestock shuffled around in their pens. The heady aroma of the old gardens didn’t amuse me tonight, the residual tang of Lantern Roses or Dancing Lilies not enough to stem my pain. Even with the faint glow of torches on the walls, the safety of this gorgeous refuge built by caring hands, I couldn’t hold back waves of sorrowful tears.

At last, I burst into the motor pool area, filled with our trucks, motorbikes, and various other vehicles that had survived the Breach’s onslaught. Out of breath, I came to a stop next to one of the armored patrol trucks, gasping in between muted sobs.

*It's all my fault. I let her down. I condemned my best friend to death.*

My lungs ached from the cold air, both eyes burned with salty tears, and my nose ran like a faucet as I sank to the ground beside a beefy black tire. They couldn’t do this, it wasn’t right. Jamie deserved to live, she’d sacrificed so much, too much. I didn’t want her to die, but I was completely powerless to do anything about it.

“You okay, Brun?”

I jumped despite myself and looked down to find Ethan Sanderson squinting up at me from a shop creeper, his overhauls smudged with grease, a gray plastic headlamp atop his grimy forehead. How I hadn’t noticed the spread of loose tools around this vehicle, I didn’t know, but my face heated to embarrassed levels at the knowledge that he’d been given a front row seat to my meltdown.

“Y-yeah.” Trying to wipe at my eyes, though the tears refused to stop, I avoided his line of sight. “I’m just . .  just a little t-tired. Sorry if I bothered you.”

He rolled out from under the truck, and sat up, wiping his hands on a nearby rag. “You’re good. I was just getting in some last-minute checks before the big push. Sean’s been working with Chris on a plan, from what I heard.”

Without another word, I attempted to stand, my legs tingling from the run, and tripped over a loose shoelace.

Ethan didn’t comment on my clumsy floundering and waited for me to right myself before he waved a stainless-steel ratchet at the truck he sat beside. “Don’t suppose you could lend me a hand?”

*I’m not doing any good elsewhere.*

Giving up on a dignified flight, I crouched next to where he sat beside a wheel hub and swabbed at my face with my uniform sleeve.

Ethan Sanderson had been leader of the Worker faction ever since the first uprising against Rodney Carter in New Wilderness. I didn’t know much about his personal life, as he was a quiet man, who mostly kept his nose in his labor. Big, burly, with faint tattoos on both arms and a shaggy head of brownish-blonde hair with stubble to match, he would have terrified me if we’d met in a dark parking lot, the walking embodiment of a police report waiting to happen. Instead, he’d earned a reputation amongst the people for being softspoken, kindhearted, and hardworking, a constant champion of the average survivor. He frequently worked long hours to give his crew more time off, and even negotiated rations or wages with other factions to get the best settlement for everyone. He hated the formal trappings of being an Assembly official, and resented the grandiose schemes of people like Rodney Carter or Dr. O’Brian for how they often trampled on the civilian population. It was rumored he’d been part of a street gang in his youth, hence the tattoos, but no one could know for sure. If Ethan did have a criminal past, it didn’t seem to bother our commander, Sean Hammond, who was himself an ex-cop and as straight-laced as they came. They were known to be good friends, and Ethan’s loyalty to Sean was unquestionable, an odd dichotomy that stood out for how very different they dressed, talked, and dealt with problems.

Ethan peered into the shadows under the truck and gestured to a part on the axel with one grimy finger. “See that little metal nipple right there? That’s a grease fitting. We’ve got to pump fresh grease into all of them to keep the bearings rolling, or they’ll wear out sooner, and we ain’t gettin no spare parts anytime soon. It’s a two-man job, since this old grease gun won’t stay on there under pressure, so I hold, you pump.”

I nodded and handed him the tools he needed as he asked for them, my mind a jumbled swirl of messy thoughts. How had it come to this? I’d only ever wanted to help people, to be kind, fair, good. In the moment, I’d thought sparing Peter and his crew of child pirates from the noose to be the right thing to do, had felt vindicated when they turned Captain Grapeshot’s besieging troops against him, and helped us escape before ELSAR’s rockets could destroy us all. Yet, in doing so, I’d all but put the rope around Jamie’s neck myself; the people demanded justice for the lives lost in that attack, and if the murdering, slave-taking, child-torturing pirates weren’t going to be punished, then someone else had to be. The more I considered it now, the more obvious it seemed from the start. I had been a fool, a naïve starry-eyed fool, thinking I was saving the world without getting anyone hurt. Jamie had been right all along, both about the people, and about me.

*She would have done the right thing from the start.*

He held the nozzle of a grease gun onto the fitting and Ethan gave me a curt nod as I clung to the handle of the thing. “Go ahead.”

I worked the cold metal handle and watched purple-red synthetic grease ooze out of the joint in the truck with a satisfying *crinkle.* We moved on to the next one, and the next, working in silent tandem amidst the salty scent of oil, grease, and diesel fuel. The entire time, I blinked at tears in my eyes, daubing at my face with my cuff so as not to rub grease on myself by accident. Long boards had been laid down around the new mechanical garage to act as a boardwalk, and these kept us both off the muddy grass of the fort’s interior, though they were cold and hard under my elbows. The night air grew colder by the minute, but not so bad that I couldn’t stand it, my breath fogging in the air with thin, wispy clouds. Tiny snowflakes fluttered down here and there, a preamble December’s imminent arrival, and somewhere outside the palisade walls, various creatures screeched into the night with their eerie songs.

“Okay. That’s the last of em. I think it’s break time.” Ethan sat back and made a satisfied grunt at the truck. He produced a small newspaper-wrapped bundle from his toolbox and peeled it open to reveal a simple ham sandwich with a few uneven slices of cheese, which he broke in half to offer me.

Though I wasn’t hungry in the least, I accepted the food, and we sat side-by-side with our backs to the truck, staring out at the tent lines and cabins of Ark River, lit by distant campfires, torches, and flashlights.

“Kendra made this.” Ethan chewed his sandwich half thoughtfully. “Makes me one every day she can, even though I told her she don’t have to. Doesn’t matter how tired she is, if she ain’t feelin well, she’s up at dawn every time, making these.”

I gulped down a sip of water from my canteen and sighed, my contemplations still back in the church with my doomed friend. “It’s good.”

Ethan brushed some crumbs from his oil-stained clothes. “She’s a good woman, Kendra. Been through a lot. You know she was one of the original crew back at New Wilderness?”

“No, I didn’t.” Idly, I examined the grain of the wheat bread, thinking of how Jamie had given me her slice of cornbread on my first day there.

Silence reigned between us for a moment.

“She lost a friend, early on.” As if trying to divine what to say from the callouses on his weathered palms, Ethan looked down at his hands. “Guess the Breach took her, way back in February before it all kicked off. When we first got together, Kendra would sometimes cry herself to sleep over it.”

He turned to look at me, and I caught a gleam of genuine pity in his oak-brown eyes.

“I think she pushes herself so hard because deep down, Kendra feels like it’s her fault. She wants to believe if she’d done more, listened more, maybe the girl wouldn’t have done what she did, but . . . sometimes life ain’t kind, even to the best of people. She couldn’t have stopped all this anymore than you or I.”

I knew what he was driving at, and while it felt humiliating to open up to someone I didn’t know all too well, at the moment, I had no one else. “They’re going to hang Jamie.”

He picked at his short, oily fingernails with a dismal nod. “Yeah, I was in the meeting.”

*And you’ll be on the prosecution stand to hang her.*

“She did it to protect me.” I glared out at the camp with resentful bitterness for how peaceful it seemed. “I know she helped O’Brian, I know that people died because of it, but . . . do we really have to kill her?”

Ethan sat quiet for a minute, and threw a glance over his shoulder, as if checking to be sure no one else was around. “You know, they caught one of our worker boys trying to corner an Ark River girl a few nights ago in the barn. He was too drunk to pin her down, but he’d torn up her clothes pretty good, and her face was a mass of bruises when we got there. Seeing as how it was one of mine, I told Sean and Adam I’d take care of it, since I didn’t want another riot.”

Stunned that I hadn’t heard of this, I swiveled my head around to watch him. “And?”

Picking up a wrench from the tool pile next to him, Ethan dug a small line in the mud between the planks under the truck. “We’re all born with nothing, no clothes, no money, just blood and screaming. All we got is ourselves, and everything else is circumstance. If nothing else, a man’s got to have a code, a line, a set of rules he don’t cross, otherwise he’s no different than an animal. Don’t hurt nobody, and don’t take what ain’t yours; simple as that.”

I eyed the line in the mud and flicked my gaze back to him. “So, what did you do to the drunk?”

“Took him for a walk.” Ethan’s scowl worked under his coarse brown facial hair, and he put the wrench back with the others. “Broke both his legs and left him in the woods for the Puppets. I checked the next morning to be sure, and found his boots with the feet still in em.”

*Holy mother of God.*

Horrified, I blinked at him, and Ethan returned my surprise with a worn, yet resolute expression.

“That girl’s sleeping safer now, and everyone involved knows where the line is. But every time I shut my eyes at night, I can still hear that boy screaming for me not to leave him, can see his knees all twisted from where the hammer smashed them backwards. A good man does what’s right, even if it means getting dirty. Jamie knew that, and Sean does too.”

Grimacing, I rubbed at my face, too late remembering the grease on my fingers, and felt it smear across my skin like war paint. “So, there’s nothing I can do then? Jamie deserves it, and I just have to watch? Is that what you’re saying?”

His head whipped back and forth with a sympathetic frown. “Nah. I’m saying Lansen saw a bad situation and decided where her line was drawn. I respect her for that. But you gotta realize that we have almost 1,000 people in these walls who only stay behind certain lines cause we make em. If we let too many people dance across it, no one’s safe. Whatever happens tonight, don’t blame yourself like Kendra. It wasn’t her fault what happened in February, and it ain’t your fault what’s happening now.”

Before I could say anything more, footsteps thundered up the plank boardwalk, and I looked up to see Charlie with a red face from his jog.

“Evening sir, ma’am.” He gasped and made a rigid salute to both of us. “Commander Hammond needs you at the church. He said to tell you they’re starting in fifteen minutes.”

*It’s time already? I can’t do this. How can I go back in there, watch this happen?*

Ethan stood and offered me a hand up, pity in his grimace. “Come on. Can’t stay out here forever. Even if people get rowdy again, they won’t go after you if we’re together.”

Numb, I let him help me to my feet and forced myself to put one boot in front of the other. The church bells tolled a mournful rhythm, people began to file from all over the camp towards it, and my heart beat a march of dread within my chest. I wanted to hope, wanted to believe, but it seemed everyone had already resigned themselves to the same conclusion.

Jamie Lansen was going to die.
