Looking at this title, many would think I work at an NSFW costume store or some sort of adult-centered theme park for millennials who never really moved past their teen years. However, neither is the case. I actually work at a bookstore. Yes, a bookstore. It’s called the “Corner Palace of Knowledge,” and it is, in fact, a large, palace-looking structure that sits on the corner of the shopping district in a small town we few thousand residents occupy.

I was hired here about a year ago, and I work full-time, roughly 40 hours a week. I’m in college, and take all of my classes online. It’s convenient because I’m allowed to do homework while on the clock, I just have to be mindful of any customers. That is, if we had customers.

Nobody really shops here, aside from the handful of regulars who come in every day or at least once a week, and the random new person who will come in once, look around for a bit, and then never come back. I can’t blame them; it’s a pretty boring place to shop.

I can also see how running into any of us, the employees, may be confusing, or even off-putting to a person who has never been in here before.

For some reason, we are required to wear a disguise, and it can’t be the same one each time. Every shift, the disguise has to be different. It doesn’t have to be anything specific, expensive, or elaborate; We just have to be fully covered.

We are not allowed to talk about anything regarding our personal lives or use our real names.   We have name tags, but they all have simple titles for what each person mainly does around the store. Because I’m usually dusting, my nametag says: “Duster.” That’s why my co-workers call me ‘Dusty’ for short.

I don’t know how many of us are employed here, but I do know a few for sure. Normally, two people are on the clock at the same time. Because I’m here every day except for Thursdays and Sundays, I get to work with someone different each time. My favorite, however, is a woman whose tag says “cover-cleaner.” I like to call her CC. From the way her voice sounds when she speaks and some of the terminology she uses, I concluded she’s likely around my age, if not a couple of years older. She’s always wearing a mask that covers her whole face. She makes them herself as a hobby, which I think is a pretty creative way of dealing with the ‘dress code.’

Cleaning is very important here, as the owners like to keep a clean space. That, and there is little to nothing better to do around here. While I tend to spend most of my time dusting the shelves, CC carefully wipes down the book covers and places them back onto the shelf, leaving them to be reorganized alphabetically by “Organizer”. Oggi for short. I work with him on Tuesdays. He must be an older man, because his voice is coarse and sounds elderly. His back is hunched, and he grumbles a lot, too.

As the title says, there are no children allowed in the bookstore, which is odd because we do carry children’s books and even have a play section. Some of us have speculated that the rule was implemented a while ago, but the place was never renovated, so the kiddy space remains sitting and collecting dust, while the rest of the store looks spick and span, as always. I mentioned before that’s how the owners like it.

I’ve only met one of them, but apparently there are two others. The one who usually takes care of hiring and public affairs likes to come in every now and then to check on the store. He refers to himself as “Mr. Keys”, I assume because he has a habit of swinging his keychain around his finger.

Mr. Keys is, as some would say, a *character.* He never announces himself when he decides to drop by, but you’ll always know it’s him by the sound of his jingling keys. He comes wearing a ridiculously flamboyant disguise, matching his ridiculously flamboyant personality. He’s quite tall, standing well over 6 feet, and slender as a twig. If I had to guess, he’s likely in his late 20s, early 30s. He’ll come in, greet whoever’s working, and walk around the store. If something is not to his liking, he’ll mention it right away, and whenever he leaves, he always says these parting words: “Do not let in any children, and remember to wear your disguises.”

I know I keep mentioning how boring my job is, but there was something strangely charming about the mundanity of the workplace. It contrasts so much with the bizarre yet short list of rules my co-workers and I must adhere to.

In the time I’ve been employed here, I’ve never experienced nor witnessed the consequences of breaking one or more of the rules, as we are all careful not to. Not out of fear, but rather habit. Those who work here have all been employed for over a year, and for most, it’s been way longer than that. There hasn’t really been any need to hire anyone new after me, which is why I was surprised when Oggi informed me he would no longer be working Tuesdays because someone new had been hired.

She came into the store in a full disguise and introduced herself as the new sander. She would be coming in once or twice a week to refurbish the shelves by freshly sanding all of them for the shelf stainer (Stan), whom I’ve only met a select number of times since he often works on the days I’m off. I’m not sure why he wasn’t the one appointed to train the new girl, as if there was much to train her on, but their individual tasks just seem to line up more, so I wondered about that.

I called her “Sandy”, which she was okay with, and after taking a few minutes to go over the other rules with her, we got to work.

The operating hours for the store are between 3:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Oddly specific, but it never mattered to me because I’ve always struggled to keep a healthy sleeping schedule. I prefer to work the opening shifts, and this was no different than any other early morning. I was dusting the shelves so Sandy could start sanding them to prepare for staining. After a couple of hours, I told her I would be taking one of my allotted breaks.

I returned to the sound of the old telephone ringing. That’s another rule, no personal devices either, so we have to use a retro telephone. I’ve heard people complain about this, wondering why we can’t at least have a landline, but it’s nowhere near the hassle of having to figure out a new disguise to wear five days out of the week.

I walked over to answer the phone, lifting it from the stand. “Corner palace of knowledge, what will you be reading today?” The little slogan is printed on the sign hanging outside the entrance, and we’re supposed to use it as part of any greeting.

The other end of the line was staticky, and I was afraid the phone was finally breaking down. That thing was ancient. Just as I went to hang up, a voice emerged from the depths of the static, one that sounded cold in its straightforwardness.

“Good morning, Mr. Duster. We hope this message finds you well. You will have an extra task to do today. It is very important to be mindful and proceed with caution. It would appear Ms. Stander isn’t feeling like someone else today.”

The static was cut, and a subtle monotone sound indicated that the other end of the line had gone dead. I hung up, confused and feeling disturbed. I decided to go check on Sandy.

I walked around to the back of the store where we had been working, but she wasn’t there. I continued around the store, calling her name when I heard what sounded like a pile of books hitting the floor. I jumped and turned to find Sandy crouched down, carefully picking them up.

“Oh, there you are. Sorry if I startled you, I didn’t know where you went,” I said, approaching her to help with the mess.

As I got closer, I realized her hair was down. Her real hair. When she had come in, she was wearing a wig with some sort of head covering on, but she was no longer wearing either.

“I’m sure I mentioned this, but we’re not supposed to take off our disguises until we’ve either left the building or clocked out for the day. Company policy, I guess,” I explained.

Sandy stood up, her back still facing me. “I’m sorry, it’s my first day. Please don’t be mad,” she said. Her voice was dry, and she spoke flatly. This reinforced my confusion and put me further on edge.

“Are you feeling alright? You sound a bit… odd.” I said, hoping she might just be coming down with a cold or something.

“I feel amazing!!” She exclaimed, her voice sounding overly animated and pitched up.

This caused me to take a step back.

“Are you messing with me? ‘Cause this isn’t funny. We should get back to work.” I said, firmly.

She was unresponsive, standing completely still. Until a moment later, when she withered down to the floor and began crawling away on all fours. “Try and catch me!” She called excitedly, scurrying away.

“H- hey!!” I yelled as I gave chase. I ended up losing sight of her as she disappeared in the dark corners of the store, zig-zagging around the mountains of shelves lined to the brim with books.

I stood beneath the bright lights, calling Sandy’s name and telling her to knock it off and quit the gag already. I heard nothing for several minutes and was too scared to go looking for her again when I heard the sound of childish laughter. Except, there were no children, only a full-grown woman doing her best imitation of a little girl’s laughter.

I followed the sound, and was led to the abandoned play section, where Sandy was sitting on the floor obnoxiously giggling and clashing the old toys together. I wondered if she was having some sort of episode. Maybe she has a mental condition that the owners were not privy to before hiring her. I realized talking to her as an adult wasn’t working, so I tried addressing her as a child. This actually worked, and she turned to face me.

Her cheeks were bright red, and her eyes were big and ocean blue. She had the face of an adult, but the expression and even features of an infant.

“Hey, Sandy, why don’t we take a break and go finish our project. Then, we can come back and play some more! Does that sound good?” I asked softly.

She seemed to ponder my idea for a bit and responded with a resounding “no.”

I furrowed my brow, but tried to remain calm and understanding. Never did I think I would have to gentle-parent a co-worker I’ve only met today.

“Oh, come on. It’ll be fun, you’ll see! You like sanding, remember?” I said, nodding my head.

She crossed her arms and scowled at me. “NO!! No, no, no, no, NOOOOOOOOO!!!” She shouted.

I stood back, becoming increasingly agitated. “Young lady, come do your work this instant!” I said, raising my voice.

Sandy looked at me for a moment before bursting into tears. She threw herself onto her back and started flailing around on the floor. Her face grew red as she thrashed her arms and kicked her legs in a full-blown tantrum.

I stood in shock, watching this unfold. This was way above my pay grade, and this might be the only job I’ve ever had that actually pays pretty well.

I wanted to de-escalate the situation, but anything I said only seemed to make her tantrum worse. She began ripping out clumps of her hair, squealing and hiccupping like the way a baby cries, but with fully developed adult vocal cords. Her arms and legs were beginning to bruise from how aggressively she was slamming them repeatedly on the floor. She was gnashing her teeth, bits of tooth fragments flying from her mouth. She even bit off the tip of her tongue, spitting it out and bleeding from the mouth as she wailed.  

I was shaking like a leaf, and not knowing what else to do, I ran back to the desk and called the emergency contact number left on a slip of paper taped to the bottom of the telephone.

Sandy’s agonizing cries made my own throat feel scratchy and caused my pulse to accelerate as I stood, waiting for someone to answer.

I listened impatiently, when my ears perked up at the sound of jingling keys coming from inside the store. “Mr. Keys!” I said aloud.

The lights flickered, and I heard a loud \*thud\*. I went to find Mr. Keys when I tripped over something in the split second of total darkness that befell the store. I experienced vertigo as I picked myself back up. I turned to see what I had tripped on, my heart dropping at the sight.

It was a body. The big light lingering above the desk came on, and I recognized it to be the body of a woman.

She was completely naked, with the skin of her face having been peeled off. Her eyes, teeth, and hair were all missing as well. I gasped, covering my mouth with both hands, trying not to scream. Tears filled my eyes, my jaw tingled, and saliva built up in my mouth as I gagged. I stumbled back to the desk where I had the sudden realization that the cries coming from the play section hadn’t yet ceased. They were as loud and as tormenting as ever.

I don’t remember losing consciousness, but I awoke with a painful throbbing in my skull. I gripped the counter with my hand as I pulled myself up off the floor for the second time, and looked around. Mr. Keys stood on the other side of the desk, spinning his keychain around his finger. “Oh, good! You’re awake!” He said.

“What… what happened? What the hell was all that about??” I asked, still holding onto some disbelief about the horrors I witnessed.

Even through his disguise, I could see Mr. Keys grinning ear to ear, as usual. “It’s been taken care of; you needn’t worry about it any longer. Only concern yourself with your job here, Mr. Duster.” He replied.

“But, what about Ms. Sander? What happened to her?” I asked.

Mr. Keys stopped spinning his keychain. “She was… terminated. Ms. Sander was unfit to work here and will not be returning.”

I looked down at the floor, past where Mr. Keys stood. “And what about the body?” I asked, a looming realization creeping into my thoughts and running down my spine.

Mr. Keys tilted his head, clenching the keys in his hand. “I’ve already told you… It’s been taken care of; you needn’t worry about it any longer. Only concern yourself with your work.” He said, this time, his words sounded more like an order rather than a reassurance.

I opened my mouth to speak, but he immediately held his hand up to my face. “No more questions, Mr. Duster. Finish your shift, then go home and rest.” He said calmly as he turned and made for the door.

“Oh, and of course,” he began, the grin returning to his face as he twirled his keychain around his finger once more.

“Do not let in any children, and remember to wear your disguise.”
