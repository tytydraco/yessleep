“Clown killed by Bus,” was the headline on the morning news.  They even showed a picture of the clown in his full getup.  Superimposed under the image was the name, “Jingles.”

That was definitely the guy, I realized.  Puffy green jumpsuit, orange tufts of hair on the sides of his head, and a big red nose.  Pretty typical for a clown.  The only thing that distinguished him was a scar running down the side of his cheek.  Too deep for his thick white makeup to obscure completely.

“We’re very upset,” one of the carnies told a reporter.  “Jingles was beloved by all, and he will be deeply missed.”

I found that hard to believe.  The day before my son, Kevin, and I had a run in with Jingles at the local carnival.  Kevin wandered off while I was busy buying us both ice cream cones.  Panic struck for a moment as I scanned the crowd.  Then I spotted Kevin about thirty feet away, talking to a clown.

So much for, “don’t talk to strangers,” right?  Maybe Kevin was under the mistaken impression that clowns were exempt from that rule.  I rushed over, almost colliding with a teenage girl holding a stuffed pink teddy bear.

The instant I reached my son, I was struck with the stench of booze.  It nearly took my breath away.  Judging by the smell, the clown must've just taken a dip in a barrel full of whiskey.

“Remember,” I heard the clown say to Kevin, “keep that tucked away in your pocket!”

“What tucked away?”  I asked as he walked up to them.

“Oh, um,” the clown stammered.

I demanded to see what was in Kevin’s pocket.  The boy reached into his coat and pulled out a piece of bubblegum.

“Christ,” I thought to himself.  My son had literally taken candy from a stranger.

I turned to the clown and said, “Listen, giving my kid candy really isn't appropriate.”

“Oh look,” the clown said, “I didn't mean anything by it.  I'm a clown, you know, it's what I do.  I'm Jingles, the…”

“No you're not,” I said, cutting Jingles off before he could finish his sentence.  “You're just some freaking weirdo, so stay away from my son alright?”

That came out a little harsh, even for me, confrontational enough that it immediately wiped the smile off Jingles’ face.

“Listen asshole,” Jingles said to me, “I wasn't gonna do anything to your stupid kid.”

Things escalated quickly after that.  The ice cream was the first casualty.  There was shouting, a couple of f-bombs, then pushing.  Kevin started crying at some point.  Jingles wound up knocked flat on his ass.  Blood trickled out from under his bright red nose.

Finally Security showed up and got things cooled down.  I demanded that they fire Jingles.  “Guy is drunk for crying out loud,” I told a customer service representative.

By the time it was all said and done, the carnival refunded me the price for admission.  The people in charge kept saying, “We're very sorry,” over and over.  I was fairly certain that Jingles wouldn't be going back to work the next day.

I had no idea just how right that prediction would turn out to be.

“Sources say that Jingles had been let go from his job after an altercation with a customer,” the reporter concluded, ending the segment.

Well, that wraps up that then.  It’s not like I wanted the guy to die or anything.  That said, he did cross off every box on the, “creepy clown,” checklist.  Still, death seemed a little severe.

Only as I was brushing my teeth did I consider the possibility that I might bear some responsibility for Jingles’ demise.  Clown loses his job.  Clown gets depressed.  Clown walks in front of a bus.  Bye bye Jingles.

“Screw that,” I said to himself, spitting a wad of minty foam all over the bathroom mirror.

Jingles was a jerk.  I was protecting my son for crying out loud.  Besides, mentally stable people don’t off themselves over a lousy carnival job.  Then again, dressing like a clown doesn’t exactly scream, “mentally stable.”

“I didn’t kill Jingles,” I said to my reflection, “Jingles killed Jingles.”

Having sufficiently absolved myself of any responsibility, I drove all thought of the clown from my mind and went to bed.

It was dark.  It was cold.  My back was wet.  I was lying prone, staring up at a black void where the ceiling fan should’ve been.  A pale, green light flickered in the corner of my eye.  I turned my head to see a glass booth about thirty feet away.  Inside was a bench, bolted to the concrete.

It was a bus stop.  Letters were spray painted on the glass behind the bench.  They read, “These Ballz.”

What the hell was going on?  I sat upright, desperately trying to get my bearings.  I was on a sidewalk.  To my right was a brown truck parked in a tow away zone.  To my left was a green sign that read, “41st Street.”

“Forty-first?”  I muttered to himself.  “Jesus Christ, that’s on the other side of town.”

I was still drowsy enough to entertain the possibility that I might be dreaming.  I stuck my thumb in my mouth and bit down.  It hurt.  Definitely not a dream.

Panic quickly replaced any confusion I was experiencing.  Had someone broken into my house, kidnapped me, and dropped me off outside on the street?

No.  That was a stupid idea.

Sleepwalking, that had to be it.  I had woken up in the middle of the night, walked all the way across town, and decided to take a nap just outside the ghetto.

Before I had the opportunity to hatch any further speculations, a pair of headlights appeared at the end of the street.  Slowly the lights approached me, bobbing up and down as they went.  They were far apart and higher off the ground than a typical car.  A truck or SUV maybe?  

The tell tale “hiss” of hydraulic brakes identified the vehicle as a bus.  It pulled up along the side of the road and stopped.  Lights were on inside, but the windows were crusted with dirt and mostly opaque.  I could make out a single indistinct shape get up and walk to the front.

Another long “hiss” cut through the air, then the bus pulled away, revealing the bus stop again, as well as a figure.  It stood silhouetted in the pale glow of the booth.  Whoever it was, they were bald on top, with long tufts of hair trailing off either side of their head.

It was a guy, I figured.  His clothes hung loose.  The cuffs around his hands were puffy and oversized.  His shoes were way too big, ridiculously so, and they were red.

Bright red.

The nature of this person started to dawn on me.  Silly hair, baggy clothes, big red shoes.  It was a goddamn clown.  And not just any clown, was it?

It was Jingles.

The clown took a step forward, letting the street light wash over his face.  On his pasty cheek there was a single scar, too deep for his makeup to obscure.

“Howdy,” Jingles said, smiling wide.  His teeth were caked in blood.

The front of his green jumpsuit was filthy.  One of the pompoms was missing.  His eyes were a milky-white, almost as pallid as his complexion.

I scrambled to my feet, wondering how any of this could be happening.  Jingles was dead, killed by a bus.  Or that’s what they said on the news at least.

“Bet you wanna know what this is all about, don't ya?”  Jingles said in a silly voice.  “I told the Powers That Be about what you did to me.  They decided I deserved a little payback.”

“Powers that be?”  I stammered.  “What the hell are you talking about?”

Jingles smiled even wider and said, “Oh, you’ll find out soon enough.”

I had no interest in finding anything out.  In fact, I was done listening.  Sure, I was scared shitless, but backing down wasn’t in my nature.

I raised my fists up and shouted,  “Listen you freak.  I kicked your ass once, I can do it again!”

“Is that so?”  Jingles said.

The clown reached behind his back and pulled out a handful of balloons, conjuring them from thin air.  They were all different colors; reds, and blues, and yellows.  One of the green balloons had a big grin printed on it, with a series of triangles representing teeth.

The plastic on the balloon started to tear.  Instead of popping, the opening continued to spit apart, revealing a gaping black hole underneath.  Where the triangles had been were actual teeth, long and pointy, dripping with thick saliva.

One by one, each of the balloons sprouted fangs.  They gnashed and snarled, snapping at me as Jingles slowly walked in my direction.

“Got a balloon for ya.” Jingles said, with a chuckle in his voice.  “And don’t worry, since we’re not strangers anymore, it’s okay to take one.”

My bravado abandoned me completely.  I turned and hauled ass as fast as I could.  My bare feet made a pitter-patter noise as I raced down the street.  I took a sharp turn around the corner and kept on running, hoping to God I could survive whatever nightmare I found myself trapped in.

The sound of giggling came up from behind me.  I twisted my head around to see Jingles flying towards me.  The clown was levitating off the ground, pulled along by his handful of fanged balloons.  The sight reminded me of a person walking a dog too big for them to handle.

A red balloon lashed out at me, nearly catching me by the foot.  I stumbled, but managed to regain my footing and keep my momentum going.

“Nom, nom, nom!”  He heard Jingles screech.  “Almost gotcha!”

“Sonofabitch is enjoying this,” I thought.  But why shouldn’t he?  In Jingles’ mind this was revenge, his way of getting back at the asshole who ruined his life.

Was any of this fair though?  Sure, maybe I shouldn’t have picked a fight with the clown, shouldn’t have demanded that he be fired.  But it wasn't my fault Jingles was drunk on the job.  I didn’t force him to walk in front of that bus.  And goddamnit, Jingles shouldn’t have been giving candy to my son!

My blood was boiling, indignation overrode my better judgment.  I spun around and shouted, “Listen you shithead.”

Instantly one of the blue balloons shot forward and latched onto my crotch.  I felt its teeth sink into my pelvis, sending a spasm of pain rippling through my body.  I lurched backward in shock, tumbling over onto my back.

The Balloon pulled away, leaving a bloody ring of teeth marks around my groin.  I reached down and cupped my hands over the area.

“At least everything’s still there,” I thought to myself.

Jingles let out a high pitched cackle.  “Yikes,” he said.  “Nearly took out all the future Kevins there!”

The clown hovered over me, his smile vanishing from his dead face.

“Why not take it all the way though?”  Jingles said, hatred burning in his eyes.  “Why should you have everything and I get nothing?”

Balloons swarmed around Jingles, their mouths salivating hungrily.  Slowly they crept towards me, their teeth glistening under the street light.  As they grew close, they opened their hideous jaws.  I was struck with the sweet stench of cotton candy and rotting meat.

I closed my eyes.  What else could I do?  There was no running, there was no fighting back, and there was no reasoning with Jingles.  I was going to die, murdered on the other side of town by the ghost of a clown I just met yesterday.

But death never came.  I waited, assuming I’d feel a myriad of teeth sink into my flesh at any second.

A loud “hiss” brought me back to reality.  I opened my eyes and saw a bus, pulled up along the side of the street.  Jingles was walking over to it.  His balloons were trailing behind him.  Their vicious smiles had turned into frowns.  They seemed disappointed.

Before Jingles got on, he took one last look at me.  The hatred was gone, replaced instead by a weary resignation.  With Jingles on board, the bus let out another “hiss” then drove off into the night.

“Sorry ‘bout that,” I heard a voice say.  It was coming from over my shoulder.  Its tone was low and empty.

I turned to see a robed figure.  It towered over me.  Chains were wrapped around its nebulous form.  Dangling from the chains were locks and keys.  No face was visible within its hood.

“Looks like things got a little outta control there,” the figure said.

It reached out a hand, offering to help me up.  The hand was a pale blue, the color of a drowned corpse, with bruises running up its wrist.  I decided not to take it, lifting myself off the ground instead.

“Um, who…  what…”  I stammered, my tone appropriately confused considering the circumstances.

“Right,” the robed figure said.  “You’re probably wondering what’s going on.”

Honestly, I was too shocked to wonder much of anything.

The figure continued, saying, “I’m the Messenger of the Custodian.”

“Who?”  I asked.

“Nevermind,” the figure answered.  “All you need to know is that I represent the forces who allowed Jingles to return from the dead and attack you.”

The, “Powers That Be.”  That’s what Jingles had called them.  Frankly, it was all a bit much to process.  I had gone from being hopelessly average to having a conversation with something resembling the grim reaper.

“We just wanted to apologize,” the Messenger told me.  “You know, for any inconvenience.”

I couldn’t believe it.  This thing  was essentially a supernatural customer service representative.  I looked down at the bloody stain seeping through the front of my pajamas.

“By inconvenience,” I said, sounding very annoyed, “you mean this?”

“Yeah,” the Messenger responded, “ouch.”

No kidding!  Once again I was indignant.  My sense of entitlement overwhelmed the gravity of the bizarre situation I was in.

“You mean to tell me,” I said to the Messenger, “all of this happened because you guys screwed up, and not because of anything I did?”

“Both,” the Messenger answered.  “We screwed up and you deserved it.”

“What did I do to deserve this?”  I asked, motioning to my injured crotch.

The Messenger tilted its head downward, then waved its hand, saying, “It’s not that bad.  Look, you definitely deserved some kind of comeuppance.  I hate to break it to you, but you really are a prick.”

“Hey,” I shot back, offended.  “Now just wait a second…”

Before I could finish the Messenger cut me off, saying, “I mean it too.  Certifiably, thermodynamically, you’re an asshole.  In fact, you should probably work on that, unless you want another Jingles on your hands.”

The Messenger let out a dry, hollow laugh as it finished its last sentence.

It dawned on me that I was in no position to argue, so I shifted gears, saying, “But that Jingles guy was a total freak, right?”

For a being incapable of having an expression, I got the feeling that the Messenger was shocked.

“No,” it said to me.  “Jingles was well liked.  He was just an alcoholic, that’s all.”

Now I really felt bad.  Jingles was only trying to be nice when he gave Kevin a piece of candy.

“Oh yeah,” the Messenger said, apparently reading my mind.  “Jingles felt obligated to keep an eye on the kid until his negligent parents showed up.”

“Negligent,” I thought.  “Asshole.”  Cripes.  Maybe I was a prick.

“It’s time,” the Messenger said, its voice drawing my attention forward.

The black void beyond its hood bore down on me.  I could feel myself being pulled forward, falling into a pit of absolute darkness.  Invisible things brushed up against my skin.  They flooded around me, slithering and crawling all over my body.

First they tickled, then they scraped, then they started stinging.  I could feel thousands of tiny little mouths biting all at once.  They dug at my flesh, burrowing underneath.  I was being torn apart, inside out, piece by agonizing piece!

I woke up, screaming, writhing.  I was in my bed.  I saw the ceiling fan spinning quietly overhead.  A dream, I realized.  Forty-first Street, the bus, Jingles, the balloons, the Messenger; the whole damn thing was a crazy dream.  

“Freaking nightmare’s more like it,” I thought to myself.

Then I felt a sharp pain in my lower body.  I threw back the sheets to reveal a red stain on the front of my pajama pants.  I shot out of bed and ran to the bathroom.  Even though I was afraid to look, I knew that I had to.  I pulled down the front of my pants.  The material stung as it peeled away from my flesh.

Reflected in the mirror I saw a ring of bloody teeth-marks.

A parting gift from Jingles the Clown.
