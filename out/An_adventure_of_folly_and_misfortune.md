This is my first time writing fiction since high school, a good 10 years ago - so forgive any literary faux paus and this is draft 0.9, so there are a few bits to iron out. And I would love any suggestions, comments or critique. Enjoy the story, and again I would appreciate any comments you have on the flow, and what might improve the general consistency of the story. Its written from the perspective of a narrator, just in case you're wondering. But anyways, enjoy the read.




Our story begins with four friends, all studying at the university of Exeter on the southern coast of England. Douglas, Emily, Evelyn and Andrew (named for his parent's love of Scotland, and their heritage in St Andrew's). The aforementioned four friends worn by the year of studying they recently endured decided to go on a jaunt to Cornwall on the south-western edge of England, in a small village called Anglesand, right on the coast with pleasant weather (for England that is) - famed for its surprisingly regal ancient church and town hall for a village of its size. Once a great prosperous town, built in the Roman era of Great Britain but slowly depopulated during the War of the Roses, and the later war of the Roundheads and Cavaliers (convoluted, I know).

Setting off immediately post exam season, before receiving their results as they had been working hard and felt they deserved a long break (as 22 year olds, they didn't fully understand the rest of life to come). Douglas insisted on driving and as early as possible so as to not drive in the dark as he hadn't properly repaired the lights, classic for Douglas. But as it was the best car for the windy roads of Cornwall and the car being a passion project he had been working on for years; he insisted on giving it a full road test .The group all being students and barely out of their teens, were fully unprepared for the road and journey ahead; bringing only the bare minimum of summer gear, a few pairs of raincoats and obviously sunglasses; perhaps a pair of binoculars would've been handy given the latter part of this tale. But it was early June and the weather was meant to be pleasant according to the Met office.

They arrived in Anglesand in the late afternoon, and journeyed straight to their Airbnb with unsurprisingly Evelyn taking 20 minutes to figure out the process of the keybox; the party had endured their final exams that morning and wanted to catch a nice early nights sleep to start early in the morning, but ended up drinking and playing cards and drinking games late into the night.

When they eventually awoke lethargically in the morning, surprisingly early given their heavy drinking the night prior - again not unusual for a group of students. Whisky, wine, and beer all involved. Heavy rain had began overnight so they settled in to watch a comforting movie and wait for the rain to stop - which pleasantly occurred around midday. Unusually, they found the town deserted; which for midday on a Friday they thought was a bit unusual, but figured it was a local custom. As there was a village fete being held that day which was advertised which they had noticed the day prior, and will be mentioned again later in this tale. They set out to explore the town, starting with the fabled church; which was adorned with beautiful iconography. However, all of these fixtures were quite odd for a town of this region; ancient as it was.

Within the church, the first thing the group noticed was a masterfully crafted statue of Caesar during his death throws on the ides of March, situated beside a small statuette of Romulus and Remus being weaned by their surrogate wolf mother (this being a pseudo-roman church), a painting of the vestal virgins - and all the other less unusual things you would find in a church from the 4th century: an icon of Jesus on the cross, a beautiful maple wooden pulpit, with intricate carvings of the virgin Mary. The final odd piece, another icon being of Prometheus providing fire to the humans of antiquity - all in all, quite a strange arrangement of objects, but being students, young and foolish they found it disturbing in the slight, but fascinating and a great story to tell their friends back in Exeter. Perhaps if they had tried to leave the village at this time, their fates would have turned out better.


Next on their list of sites to visit was the infamous town hall. Which they were surprised to find dilapidated and generally in a poor condition; not the highly maintained and beautiful regal building they had expected; but being recent adolescents and foolhardy they explored the town hall almost falling through some of the rotted wooden flooring as they wandered around the dilapidated hall. Again, after visiting the church the group were worried, but foolhardy as they were; continued on and found the entrance to the cellar of the town hall (not an easy undertaking, being under further rotten floorboards which Douglas ripped up, being as adventurous as ever, and figuring himself somewhat of a handyman). There they found even stranger items than in the church itself, being built in the 4th century they were clearly placed closely after the church was built. Old scrolls, rolled up paintings of long dead dukes and most disturbingly (especially for Emily) a wall of skulls with a room positioned behind. Douglas as we have discovered by this point, was a perhaps overly brave young man, broke down the door so they could finish their exploration. Inside, what they found was disturbing; ancient skeletons likely dating from the Roman period who had been interred, possibly due to a plague of the era or something more nefarious. The oddest part of this section of the church was most of the skulls looked not long dead, or fresh if you rather. Figuring they had explored the whole church, and worried a daemon or other beast (Emily and Evelyn being of the superstitious kind) may appear to consume them like the persons presumably belonging to the skulls of the people on the wall, they swiftly left and headed out into the early afternoon sun.


By this time it had reached the late afternoon once more, and there had not been a sight of a single other person other than those of the group themselves; which they thought was odd but there was advertised for that evening an annual village festival which can have a tendency to turn into a camping trip of sorts; they assumed everyone had drank a bit too much and were just continuing being jolly and merry; nothing wrong with that.

After the visit to the town hall, they all figured they'd go on a bit of an adventure down to the shore and explore the cliffs, rock pools and swim in the surprisingly warm east Atlantic waters to comfort their minds and bring some peace to their increasingly uncomfortable holiday (accompanied by some beers of course, students after all). For summer, given England is quite far north it got dark surprisingly early, so they jumped in Douglas' car and headed back to their Airbnb; for more drinking and general relaxing after their hard year.

It was the third day by this point of their planned short weekend adventure, and they still hadn't seen a single person or even an animal, be it a: deer, rabbit or even a field mouse; which were meant to be quite common in the region. Emily being the most skittish of the group suggested they leave the village as it was starting to seem something unusual was clearly occurring and it was best to leave before a daemon or other creature turned up, which everyone bar Emily thought was hilarious but as Douglas was very lets say 'fond' of Emily, agreed and they packed up and set off. They followed the same road they came to Anglesand down on, but passed the same signs over and over again eventually finding themselves back in Anglesand. At this point they all noticed their phones had not been receiving signal since they had arrived in the village - its a rural place so they didn't think much of it, but were very obviously highly concerned that they couldn't leave the town. At this point Andrew started to become incredibly anxious and suggested they headed to the top of the cliff overlooking the beach and relaxing until they spotted a passing boat they could flag down. They slept there overnight and increasingly they all grew more anxious over the clearly growing seriousness of their situation.

When the sun arose on the 4th day. The group were all growing increasingly sleep deprived and desperate for relief; they decided to try to head out of Anglesand again and hoped this time they would be able to get back to Exeter; to home and rest with an incredible story to tell. Regrettably, the same prior situation occurred and they ended up right back were they started, they set back off for the cliff again hoping to see a ship to take them out of what was turning into a hellish experience - they brought wine and the last of their whiskey, and being inspired by their vision of the icon of Prometheus set up a fire and tried to keep themselves merry.

Upon reaching the morning, they were beginning to view mirages of boats on the horizon and began calling out until their voices turned hoarse with their protestations. None of them responded to their pleads for aid. Evelyn was the first to call out, followed by Emily; this woke Andrew and Douglas who continued the farcical calls along with their companions; Emily and Douglas retired in the early evening to try to rest, hoping to preserve their remaining food. But Evelyn and Andrew continued screaming until their voices were worn by their protestations, and they too following their Promethean inspirations from the visit to the church starting a fire, to warm the group who only had blankets and one sleeping bag claimed by Evelyn.

The weather by this point on their 'short' weekend jaunt had turned to a mix of sleet and snow, quite obviously unusual for England in June. But surprisingly the ground was supplying an almost unnatural heat, which kept the group warm enough to ward off hypothermia whilst they slept; given Douglas and Emily were by this point coupling the cold wasn't a huge threat for the newly formed couple. However, at this point the supernatural nature of Anglesand had started to reveal itself, and perhaps revealed why the village had been essentially abandoned by the Romans, and then the following Anglo-Saxons. Only leaving a small village populated by reclusive persons who never ventured far from the village - given the nature of the story we will never know.

Andrew was the first to begin the slide into madness, and soon the rest followed. Hallucinating and dreaming they were home with their parents back in Exeter. Finally spotting a boat heading towards them on the horizon they rejoiced and slid off the cliff all being ecstatic that their fate had finally turned around. Once in the now frigid waters, the group laughed and laughed whilst swimming around one another and that is where their story ended, and is alas all we will ever know. The boat was an illusion. The village of Anglesand did not turn up on any map when their family eventually realised they had all not returned on time - the story remains a mystery to this day. However, if you are ever suggested to visit Anglesand or see a sign directing you to it, immediately turn back - as you will likely never return.
