Ever had those nights when your mind begins to imagine something horrid? Like, what if there were rotting fingers clutching a rusty blade that were inching towards you from beneath your bed?? Or what if a shadow entity has been tailing you the entire time? I’ve spent much time alone and know that feeling too well. Deep down you know that your brain is just being a dick yet for some reason a small part of you is scared and you begin to pay a little more attention to your surroundings. The moving curtain in the window that was never a worry is now something that catches your eye, the shadow of your hand on the wall as it doom scrolls on your phone is now a movement registered by your brain. 



It’s as if some part of you is now dedicated to keeping an eye out, as if you are waiting to get that feeling of being watched by someone, yet it doesn’t come. Well, that’s how I felt when Bala and I left for Munnur village to visit the orphan boy who had now grown into a hardworking, everyday man. I didn’t have to wait long. After receiving the call from Bala’s mentor, I quickly hatched a plan to make my first meeting with the suspected Sentinelese man a bit less weird. I had my gear, and thus I decided to pretend to be a small-time documentary maker looking to compile an anthology of exceptional survival stories. It was the half truth, but somehow I was okay with that. 



Two days after the call, we left for Munnur. It wasn’t a long trip, only 3 to 4 hours if the roads were great, but that is when this cold, slimy tendril of dread wrapped around my heart, and squeezed it with each passing second. What was I doing? I had never been the kind to lie to people on a whim, yet here I was concocting stories and weaving a web of deceit thick enough to suffocate the truth… 



As Bala and I drove with simmering silence as our third passenger, I began to weigh all the possibilities. I was going to need money to fund this trip if it was to happen, I would have to bribe people, hire the shady ones and maybe even invest in some illegal arms, not to mention pay Bala, pay for my stay, food and if I was to continue my lifestyle, a lot of marlboros and Budweisers. So now that I had already lied my way this far, something in my brain convinced me that there was no reason to stop now. 



I had decided to convince our firm back home to fund my trip under the guise of a documentary. I mean, who would give up the chance to fund and release a documentary about North Sentinel Island? A sting operation that exposed the secrets of the most isolated tribe? Sure, they would risk prosecution in India, but that would barely be an issue once we were out of the country and the footage was on the web…yeah…these few thoughts were enough for me back then. I didn’t show it, but during that car ride, I had decided that I would lie to Carl, and if my suspicion about the man we were about to meet was true? 

  


If there was a small possibility that the man I was about to meet was Sentinelese…I would show Carl the footage, and I knew he wouldn’t be able to back out after that. But before guilt crept up my spine and invaded my brain, our car came to a screeching halt. We had reached our destination. Now that I look back, I wonder if my guilt was being held back by the same ‘something’ that I dreaded so that I could continue with my obsession. Either way, when we got out, Bala’s mentor, Govind, greeted us. 



He was short and fat but not the ugly kind, though his crooked teeth, red lips and the local unbranded cigarette in his mouth highly disagreed with me. He struck me as an odd man. After warning Bala about something in the native language, he looked at me and stuck his hand out. I thought he wanted to shake my hand, but when I reached out, Bala stopped me and pulled me aside. I can still hear Govind’s snickers in the back of my mind. I've always hated making a fool of myself, whether it be waving at a girl who isn’t even looking at you or a foreign man who was treating this as strictly business. Once Bala had explained what was happening, I realized that the man was simply asking for his money, and now that I think about it, why would he shake my hand in the first place? 



And so I took out ten thousand rupees (roughly $120) and handed them over. I wanted to say something snide, make a remark, but the man treated me like putrid boil and quickly left before I could even speak. Bala patted me on the back, and we picked up our bags and walked towards a nearby house. It was nothing fancy, a white colored two storied brick and mortar building with a small yard outside. Had it not been for my encounter with Govind, I would’ve even liked the place, but that should’ve told me how the day would go. Today wasn’t my day, for when we entered the place, an old couple was looking at us as though we had come to rob them of their souls, as though we were vampires entering their house without permission.



I could tell from their posture and scowls that we were unwelcome here, and if they could do anything about changing that, they would’ve done it a long time ago. Bala and I folded our hands courteously and then decided that it was best if we waited by the gate. The old man was exceptionally built considering his age. He was wearing nothing but a vest and the traditional dhoti. His arms were scarred and hardened by years of fishing, while his wife was the opposite; she was a delicate woman dressed in a summery sari with graceful movements. Bala leaned in towards me, and while smiling towards the couple, slowly murmured



“His parents..adopted…dad not happy…soooo not happy”



He didn’t have to tell me this; I wasn’t a toddler, but I appreciated the heads up nonetheless. The man had folded his arms, and someone naive would’ve thought he was being defensive, but I knew better; this was a call for war, a call to do something stupid, and I knew it too well, for I had spotted the hooked machete lying in the window near him. I would later learn that this was a Kattari, a commonly found blade in almost every household in southern India. People use it to cut coconuts, hard vegetables, and occasionally someone that pisses them off. 



I decided not to look him in the eye and avert my gaze, and this is when I saw his wife approaching us. She calmly gestured us towards the two chairs she had set up in the front yard and began speaking with Bala in the native language. Despite the tense atmosphere, I was glad to be able to set down my backpack; my gear wasn’t doing my back any favors. I decided to pull out my phone and pass the time, but this is when the woman gently tapped on my shoulder and said



“He is our son, we might not be his parents, but he is our son. We love him very much, please …please be nice to him…. and don’t take him away from us…”



“No, trust me, I’m only here for a few interviews, ….we just want to talk to him…. tell his tale…and I”



But that is when she interrupted me and said…



“It’s okay.”



It was a weird response, and for a moment, I thought maybe she could see through my lies. Maybe the father could, too? But I wasn’t here to take their son away… I was simply here to interview their son, and that part was God's honest truth. This is when Bala looked at me and said…



“Look Phillip… these are Mr. and Mrs Sastry, they’re Setu’s parents. He’ll be here in 15 to 20 minutes ….just do your best to not piss them off…”



“What was his mother saying to you?”



“Umm… look here… people don’t take kindly to your kind… I mean journalists, TV personalities, celebrities….anyone related to Entertainment…. it's a common belief that you guys only mean trouble…”



“And what’s his father’s deal?”



“Can’t say but I’m pretty sure he’s convinced that we’re here to steal his kid away by the looks of it…”



“Did Govind say anything about them?”



“Nothing about this, no…they’re supposed to be awfully nice….moved away from the coast when Setu was in the 7th grade…. father gave up fishing and started farming here in Munnur…mother’s a school teacher… If I had to guess, we’re a big unwelcome event in their perfect life…”



“I’m going to go out and smoke for a bit to try and relax…”



Bala nodded, and I headed outside. But when I lit and inhaled the elective cancer that I had been addicted to since school, I realized that my feeling of dread had only heightened since getting here. I was noticing everything in my periphery, the swaying grass, the jumping crickets, the little bit of dust in the wake of a passing motorcycle and then suddenly I froze. 



Something was slithering against my left foot, I could feel it slithering forward, with the canvas of my shoes as the only wall between it and my sweaty toes. I knew what it would be; they were very common in this part of the country, and when I looked down, my suspicions were confirmed; it was a snake. But when I looked closer, I realized that it was a cobra. Cobra…that should’ve rung church bells in my mind, it still does to this day, but back then, well, like I’ve told you…something had lowered my IQ, muddled my decision-making skills. Because instead of standing still or backing away from a snake that is one of the most venomous on the planet, I decided to snap a picture. 

  


The things we do for clout…and honestly, taking a photo while standing still wasn’t a bad idea… ‘Whaaat waaas’ a bad idea was to tap my cigarette and get rid of the excess ash before doing so. The snake turned around instantly and its fangs, like hollow needles filled with death, snapped inches from my flesh as the ash hit its tail end. Reflexively, I pulled my leg away and stumbled to the ground. It was inches away and rearing on its back, flaring its skin and ready to pounce on me, but that is when Setu’s father grabbed the snake by its tail and flung it into the patch of greenery on the other side of the road. 



He grabbed me, pushed me to my feet, aggressively wiped the dirt off of my clothes and then snatched the cigarette from my hand and walked away. I watched him walk towards the nearby cluster of shops while smoking my Marlboro. Dumbfounded, I walked back into the house with jello knees.



“Why do you look like that?” Bala asked



“Like what?” 



“Like scared?”



I was having a bad day, and the last thing I needed was for my guide to make fun of me, so I decided to brush off his question. This is when the sound of a motorbike entering the yard interrupted our conversation, and I was relieved to see that Setu was finally here. I was taken aback by his appearance. I had known better than to expect a child; I knew he was older than me, but seeing the man parking his bike a few feet away from me was unreal. He was dark skinned, just like others, yes, but there was something different about him. 



Like his every feature was different from what I had come to know as common in this part of the country. His eyes were warm and welcoming, his smile bright, and his build was surprisingly muscular. He was supposed to be working in a bank, yet he looked fairly out of place. I didn’t want to be rude by continuously staring at him, so I looked away once we shook our hands, but I had this growing feeling in my stomach, my gut was screaming at me, my mind was buzzing with bees once again, for I knew in my heart that I had stumbled upon some kind of treasure… 



Setu’s father returned while we exchanged pleasantries. He had his lunch, and we then decided to head to the nearby body of water so that we could talk business. 



“I’ll be honest with you Phillip …I’ll be upfront… I’m only doing this for the money… I don’t like to tell people about my past…”



“It’s okay man, I don’t mind as long as you tell us your heroic story…”



“Huh…yeah”



His yeah was steeped in sarcasm, and I instantly knew that heroic was the wrong word to use. And so I kept my mouth shut until we reached our destination. It was a rather large mossy pond with overgrown weeds and a huge open area beside it. Not the ideal location in my eyes, and so the setting sun would have to do most of the heavy lifting in my frame. But I was too desperate to waste a day just because I didn’t have the perfect shot. Over the years, I had learned that it was best to let people know what you were going to talk about before the interview. I also knew that I needed to get Setu comfortable in front of the camera. So I set up my shot and then took a seat with Setu in front of it. I told him why I was doing it and offered him a Marlboro. He gladly took it and said…



“My mother doesn’t know that I smoke….and she doesn’t let dad smoke in the house…”



I chuckled, “So that’s why he snatched mine away.”



He laughed, “Don’t mind him, he means well. I love them both, they’ve been the best to me, I couldn't have dreamed of better parents even if they aren’t mine…”



“Your mom seems great, and your father saved me from a Cobra …so I am not complaining.”



This is when Bala joined our conversation, “Ah, so that’s why you were scared.”



I shrugged my shoulders. “So…you want to tell us your story before we roll the camera? You can tell us the story first to iron out the kinks ….don’t worry about mistakes, we can always start over again or add a cut when the camera’s rolling..”



“Yeah yeah…”



Those yeahs were laced with reluctance….I knew it, and so I decided to let Setu take his time…he sat down on a nearby stone, grabbed a stick and began fidgeting with it. He then turned towards me, sighed and said…



“My earliest memory is being woken up by the harsh sunlight and then experiencing excruciating pain. I could feel grains of salt between my lips every time I gasped, I could feel them between my eyelids and I could feel them in my ears. Panic was the first thing I felt, my first memory, my first real emotion and when I frantically looked around, there was nothing but churning water for miles. My legs stung, my hands burned and blisters covered every inch of my skin that was outside the water. 



When I tried to crane my neck my back stiffened, muscles locked up and I screamed loudly. I couldn’t see it, but I could feel it, the huge wound on my back that made it difficult to twist or bend. I soon realized that my left arm was locked around a piece of wood as though my body was involuntarily forcing me. It was as if, even though my mind didn’t want to survive, my body did. It took an excruciating amount of effort to loosen my grip, I had to will each finger on my left hand to slowly ease up and by that time I had realized that this piece of wood was my best hope for survival. I held on to it with my right arm as I slowly relaxed my left. 



Eventually I calmed down and learned that dipping my head, neck shoulders or arms in the water was a bad idea. They had blisters all over which hurt like hell, but what hurt more was when the salty water around me made contact with them. I had tried to climb onto the piece of wood at first only to realize that it wasn’t big enough to hold my entire weight….I don’t know how many times I lost and regained hope in that first conscious hour on the sea….but somehow I held on and to this day I don’t know how…or why for that matter…”



He looked into our eyes momentarily and then looked towards the ground after that. I couldn’t fathom half of the things he had said, I couldn’t imagine them and Bala’s eyes were filled to the brim with concern and pity. None of us spoke, and after a brief pause, and after regaining his composure…Setu continued…



“Why was I trying to survive? Why was I here? Who was I? These….these questions became something else in the next few hours…they became ethereal entities that I had to accept were here to stay with me. They wouldn’t be solved or answered, not by me or the sea around me… all I could do was stay with them…hunger and thirst were banging at the door of my mind but these three entities, these questions were overpowering their screams. I didn’t even remember my name, I didn’t remember anything… I had once again given up and had accepted my fate. 



The sun was going down and I knew that passing the time at night was only going to hound me more. So I decided that if I was going to die of starvation here, I might as well go out doing something that I like. Somehow I knew that I liked fish, I don’t know why or how, but I liked them. I knew they were colorful and so I began counting them one by one until I fell asleep. The wood was soaked enough that I could indent it with my nails and so I began to mark it. I don’t remember falling asleep but I did and I was thankful for that. 



Dying in your sleep seemed like the most humane way to go, back then. But then, the sound of thunder woke me up, it startled me awake….I still remember, fear, confusion tingling down my wet body when I suddenly jolted back to consciousness. I still remember how dark it was around me, I couldn’t see my own hand even if it was touching my nose and then it happened, lightning lit up the sky around me and briefly I could see myself. But then nothing happened, no thunder. That day, even before I knew what science was, I realized that sound is much slower than light because when the sound finally reached my ears, the sheer intensity of it caused me to lose my grip on the wood. I panicked and thrashed, flailed my arms around wildly but they caught nothing but darkness. My tiny hope of survival, the tiny piece of wood keeping me afloat, my only connection to land in the vastness of the ocean was gone….”



Bala couldn’t help but gasp at this, and Setu simply shot him a bleak smile. That smile I tell you, it was like that smile, that tiny gesture of happiness carried the weight of the world behind it, as if it was a barrier straining to hold back every emotion that was itching to burst out. Maybe that’s why lips bend like that, for they are maybe straining to hide what wants to get out. Setu lit another cigarette and then said…



“My heart was beating so fast I could feel the veins behind my ears pulsing, I was crying, weeping and had begun to breathe through my mouth. But then lightning struck again and I saw that the piece of wood was a few feet away from me…on my right. The sight of that little piece imbued me with something I had never felt before. I now know that it might have been adrenaline but I zipped towards it as though it was the only thing I ever wanted in my life. When my finger brushed against its coarse texture, I wrapped my body around it as though a mother holding onto a baby whom she thought she had lost….no…no… I was the baby and the piece my mother, for I clung on to it with all my strength, hugged it like the mother I knew I had lost. 



I then decided that I won’t sleep and simply stared up at the sky. The tiny stars in the sky gave me some sense of hope. I decided to keep staring at one and it gave me some sort of joy…. I don’t know how long I stared at it but it must’ve been a couple of hours at least…and I swear to you I could feel its warmth on my cold wet body. Must’ve been a psychological thing or a trance, I don’t know but I fell asleep once again..”



I saw Setu’s eyes sinking with each word he said, and I could swear his voice seemed to crack and groan with every pause he took, and now that he had stopped for a moment, I couldn’t help but say…



“Hey if you want…we can continue this tomorrow or if you’re having second thoughts, I’d understand…”



“No…the worst part is almost over… as I said…I fell asleep even though every part of my brain screamed at me not to do so. And then I woke up to the sound of water splashing around me. I thought my time had come, that the huge monster in the sea had come to take me, that some fish big enough to eat a child like me was chomping down on my arms and legs. I began to thrash instinctively, I kicked, screamed, wallowed and writhed like a fish out of water ….even now, when I look back… I don’t know where I got the strength to do that. 

  


Then, after a minute or so, I heard voices….voices of people, someone saying the word “Amaiti” over and over again. Back then though, I didn’t know the language….only knew that someone was speaking to me over and over again….I instinctively stopped thrashing and when I looked around I realized that a man was holding me, he had his arms under my shoulders….there were people ….people here around me…and then when I looked to my right I saw light…and what looked like a house…but how was it here? How was a house floating on water? I was convinced that I was dead and these were ghosts taking me away for eternal torture, and so I began fighting back once again. But I was no match for the man’s strength. 



I clawed at his arms, tried to hit him in the face, but eventually, he managed to drag me towards the floating house, and another ghost pulled me onto its roof. Of course, I now know that it was a boat and those men were simply trying to save me, but the kid me could not comprehend the situation. As soon as I was on the roof of the house, I huddled in a corner and began to cry and scream whenever anyone tried to approach me…not that many tried, every ghost around me was wincing and looking away from me. None of them looked me in the eye, none …except one man who kneeled down and sat beside me. His eyes were comforting, I remember staring into them as he smiled…and it was like I was in a trance. 



When he saw that I had calmed down, he turned his back towards me, sat between me and the other ghosts, and somehow shooed them away. With a single motion of this man’s hand, every ghost went scurrying away. Back then I thought that this must be god…only god could have the power to send so many ghosts away with a single wave of his hand. Once all the ghosts were gone, the God simply sat there….he didn’t move or say anything, he merely sat with his back towards me, and slowly, I couldn’t feel my heart trying to burst out of my chest anymore. And slowly, the three questions that had barricaded my mind faded away. 



It didn’t matter who I was, didn’t matter where I was, and the last one was answered. I now knew why I was trying to survive, so that I could eventually end up here. However, the departure of questions meant the arrival of hunger, thirst and most of all pain. I lost control over my arms, my spine folded, and I slumped to the floor, content that this was a good place to die if I was going to. God must’ve heard my head hitting the roof of his floating house because he quickly rushed towards me and grabbed me. He propped me up in his arms and put his water bottle to my lips and I sipped on it for what seemed like an eternity. 



It felt good, but I still couldn’t move my arms or legs without losing strength a few seconds later. I simply lay there in his arms as he carried me to what seemed like soft ground made of dough. He covered me with what I could only describe as the thinnest bark I had ever seen, and minutes later, God told me to eat some white flesh. I tried to nibble, but my jaw wouldn’t move; all I could do was lick it. God turned away from me for a few moments and then came back and began to pet my head. I don’t know when, but I suspect I had fallen asleep seconds later. 



This God is the man who found me, he adopted me; he had carried me to his bed, and when he had turned away from me, it was so that he could wipe his tears. He couldn’t bear seeing a child who couldn’t eat but only lick bread. 



So yeah….that’s kind of what happened, Phillip….are you happy with it?”



I was shaken out of my stupor when Setu addressed me. I had been imagining it all, I had been envisioning it, imagining the grumpy old man I saw today as a kind-hearted man who would comfort a strange kid and even cry for him. I didn’t want to make Setu feel awkward, so I quickly blurted out. 



“It was great, you’re a natural storyteller, I am sorry though… sorry you had to go through so much.”



Setu simply shrugged and said, “So do we start recording now?”



I nodded and struggled with the idea of whether I should tell him what I think about his origins. His story only made me more and more suspicious, but I decided to play my cards close to my chest back then. I set up the shot, pinned the Mic on Setu’s collar and hit record. Once I gave him the thumbs up, Setu smiled, looked at the camera and said



“Um Hi…My name is Setukrute Sastry… and this is my story…”
