I'm a university student and live with two roommates, Dennis and Jordan. Dennis left a couple days ago for a wedding. Friday evening, Jordan was about to go to the liquor store. I raced out of my room with cash as he was going downstairs and told him to grab me a couple of spiked Arnold Palmer tall boys. He left at about 6 PM.

I fell asleep writing a paper. When I woke up, it was dark. Around 9. I was ready to party (surf the web while drinking) so I went downstairs to see if Jordan had gotten me my drinks. His case of beer and my tall boys were in the fridge when I checked.

"Thanks, man," I said. I could see his leg hanging off the side of the sofa. The TV was on. He didn't respond so I figured he was asleep. There was a weird movie playing on the TV. Just a bunch of silent dutch-angle shots of a dark house.

I went upstairs. As I was passing Dennis's room, I saw that his door was open. His desk lamp was on and his arm was sticking out from under the blankets on his bed. Back a bit early.

I returned to my room and lay in bed sipping one of my drinks and watching anime on YouTube. I passed out at some point and woke up very groggy around 1 AM. I corrected the precarious position of my laptop, unobstructing my view of the doorway.

Someone was waving at me out in the hallway. It's hard to describe. The hallway light wasn't on but the window let in some moonlight and I could just see his arm "waving". I put it in quotes because it was more like flopping. Up, elbow bent, down, arm flopped out. Up and down like that, slowly.

"What are you doing? Jordan? Dennis?" I said. He didn't reply. "Dude, just go to bed. You're drunk."

He slowly withdrew his arm. The floorboards creaked down the hall and down the stairs. Whatever. I cracked open my other can and listlessly scrolled social media. On Instagram my feed was full of mostly food and hot girl posts until I saw a new one from Dennis. A selfie of him on a dance floor, a picture of him with the bride and groom, a selfie of him disheveled but soyfacing and giving a thumbs-up in a hotel room. "What a night. Congrats to the happy couple! Currently recovering from the wildest wedding reception ever, lol!" Posted just 20 minutes ago.

I went into the hallway and turned on the light. I passed Jordan's room--the door was open and his room was faintly lit by the hallway light, showing his pale foot sticking out from under his blankets--and went down the hall to look into Dennis's room.

I ventured a bit inside to look at the mystery person's arm poking out of the blankets but thought it would be intrusive to go any farther and turned back. It was probably his girlfriend; she slept over sometimes. Just not without Dennis.

I headed to the bathroom, glancing warily into Jordan's room as I passed, and went straight to the sink to drink from the tap like a thirsty dog. I turned on the water and drank greedily for a few seconds before I gagged and spit it out. It tasted like blood and when I pulled away I saw that it was running red. I stared as the water ran redder and redder and thicker until it wasn't water anymore, just blood slopping out. Finally I slammed the faucet handle down. Blood clung slick around the drain.

As I was staring dumbfounded at the sink, I detected movement behind me in the mirror. Startled, I looked up and drew in a silent gasp when I saw Jordan peeking out from behind the half wall that separated the hallway from the stairs in the reflection of the mirror. He was just visible from the nose up. Eyes glassy and half-closed. Hair matted with blood. Directly below him should have been almost the bottom of the stairs. He was too high up to be standing there.

A blood-streaked arm was suddenly thrust up into the air beside it and flopped violently back and forth.

"Hi, Daniel!"

The voice was like that of a bad cartoon character, like someone poorly imitating Mickey Mouse if Mickey Mouse were a heavy smoker. High pitched and shrill and textured like sandpaper. Not even trying to sound like Jordan. His face did not even so much as twitch and his head swiveled unnaturally like he was a ventriloquist dummy.

"Why don't you come and watch the show with us?" the voice rasped, the head bobbing with each syllable. A laugh track burst from downstairs, from the TV.

I had the will to say "What the fuck are you?" but couldn't muster the breath for it.

"It'll be fun! Your mom and dad will be there! Mrs. Sandler will be there! Everyone will be there!"

My parents died in a car crash two years ago. Mrs. Sandler had been my teacher in the third grade but passed away from cancer in the middle of the school year.

I didn't turn around, just kept my eyes fixed on his reflection as I slowly, carefully shut the bathroom door with my foot. The squeal of the hinges seemed deafeningly loud. When it was closed I locked it, then sat on the floor and braced my feet against it.

No sooner had I done it did I hear what sounded like a stampede pounding the floor, closer and closer to the bathroom until an immense weight slammed against the door. Just once. I couldn't help but whimper as I sat there hyperventilating under the waning light of the flickering bulbs.

I happened to have my phone in my pocket. With shaking fingers I fat-fingered nearly every three-digit combination of numbers before I managed 9-1-1.

"9-1-1, what's your emergency?" a woman on the other end said.

"Someone's in my house! My roommate is dead! Help me! Help!" I screamed. I shrieked and braced the door harder with my feet when white fingers prodded underneath it, dragging limply across the floor.

"Hee-hee, hoo-hoooooo, I'm gonna get yooou!" the voice rasped through the phone. The TV burst with a whole audience of laughter downstairs.

The line went dead.

I tried texting everybody to get help for me. My friends, my siblings, Dennis, the landlord. Everything I typed auto-completed to "Come and watch the show! Come and watch the show!" Now I'm getting texts from my parents' old numbers telling me to come downstairs and watch the show.

Something is flopping around in the bathtub. There's blood splattered all over the inside of the shower curtain. I can't get up to see what it is. The fingers keep prodding at me under the door. It's screaming with laughter out there. Everyone downstairs is laughing.

If you can read this, please call for help. I live in River Falls, Wisconsin, at A House Where You Can Watch The Show!
