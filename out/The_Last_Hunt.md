Clunk Clunk clunk!!!!!! Squueeeaaaaakkkkkkk the suspension on the 99 jeep cherokee xj was about to beat us to death going down the rough two track in the Ouachita National Forest. Michael looked over at me and asked if I was ever going to get around to installing the new upper control arm bushing laying in the floor board behind his seat.

 Yeah sure with all my free time I laughed, I had free time but it's hunting season and this is serious business! I'm not about to waste a scarce day off work to turn wrenches. 

 The road was rough and washed out with large ditches and gravel carried down from flash floods in the spring, the state doesn't get in much hurry to fix these roads but they will sure demand you pay the permit fee to hunt the public land there…. But that's why I chose this area, it's rugged and remote and we shouldn't run into anyone else. With some luck we will have the big hollow between the two mountains to ourselves, and so far not so much as a set of tracks in the road has been in ahead of us. 

  Where are we going? Asked Michael as I was navigating a rough wash out. Michael and I had been friends for so long we can't even remember how we actually even became friends to start with. As such we had been on many hunts like this and I knew he was worried. “Wasn't scared of the dark just what's in it!” He would always tell me. This is a spot neither of us had ever been to before and my only knowledge of the area was from my dear friend Google earth and a topo app on my phone. 

 Theres a ridge that runs up the mountain and halfway up it has a saddle that connects to another ridge. I was going to head towards the saddle and hunt there til dark unless I see something I like before I make it that far. You can go with me and split off along the way or hunt the other side of the hollow up to you. (Knowing full well he would go with me being a scaredy cat). I told him.

 We parked at the gate got our gear on and headed off. The soft crunching of oak leaves under our feet, my favorite time of the year when trees are still holding some leaves and there's always that loamy earth scent. The further we got from the jeep the more that nagging feeling started to raise it's head from the depths. The feeling of impending doom. The feeling something is off. 

  We had made it about 300yd from the jeep when Michael said he likes the woods on the south side of the old log road we walked down. It was open mixed timber with a small creek that parallels the road. It was definitely nice woods but I never had much luck down low like that. Told him I would meet him back here at dark and we parted ways. 

  I continued down the road for another 500yd before I got to where I planned to turn back to the north and head up the ridge that would take me to the saddle I planned to watch. I turned off the trail at 900ft of elevation, the saddle was at 1350ft with top of the mountain at almost 1600ft in elevation. 

 It was beautiful with temps in the mid 50s slightly overcast and just after 1pm. The leaves on the oaks that still clung On mostly red or yellow with very little green left slightly rattled by the breeze. Despite the beautiful scenery there was the feeling something wasn't right but I couldn't place it. I could tell Michael was apprehensive but that's nothing new. 

  Was it the fact that I was unfamiliar with the lay of the land? No cell service? Worried about getting lost on the way back? Surely Not that. It was simple I was hiking up, if I walked down far enough I'd come out to the road. Yet it was there like melted snow running down between your jacket and skin down your back. A feeling that something wasn't right sunk it's icy skeletal fingers into subconscious. But I had a Renington model 700 chambered in .300RUM one of the most powerful magnum .30cal hunting cartridges commercially available and a Ruger Super Blackhawk .44mag under arm in a fine tooled leather shoulder holster. 


  After 30yrs of hunting the Ouachitas the most dangerous thing I had ever ran into was always other humans. I knew realistically there was nothing to be afraid of. Rifle season is only so many days and even less of those are time off work, I wasn't giving up my opportunity at true mountain monster giant whitetail buck. I continued on ridge that would get to the saddle passing several nice rubs on the tress where bucks rub the bark off the trees with their antlers. Many hunters will vet hung up sitting by those rubs not realizing 95% of that is done at night. No sir the caliber of deer I was after wouldnt be caught down there before dark.

 The ground gave way to large loose chunk novaculite from baseball up to football size scattered about which made the walking hard as it could often slip out from under your foot about sending you crashing down. I was glad to be past that where the trees made a belt along the mountain of mostly mature pines and larger boulder sized rocks, this is where I would cut back to the east to get to the saddle I hoped to catch a big buck come across just before dark. I was sitting on a boulder taking a quick break when I heard some smallrocks come tumbling down. Hoping to cut the hunt short and see the big buck or even a mature black bear as it was bear season easing along the steep side of the mountain.

  Much to my surprise and frustration it was a person. A rough man appeared to be in his early 60s was stealthily as possible heading towards me. The frustration that I felt not knowing where all he had came from probably messing up my hunt filled my mind just short of rage. I realized it's just hunting and it's public land. It's here for all of us and he was here first so the thought of anger slowly subsides. As he came closer I noticed his clothes.

  As per state law you had to wear an orange vest and orange hat during firearms season and he had neither. He had black leather boots that looked worn out, dark navy wool pants, a dark brown woolen jacket, cap of the same and even carried an old single shot trap door style rifle chambered in 45/70govt seeing the extra cartridges in the leather belt around his waist. Unbelievable. That Hour drive from home just to get to where we turned off the highway, another 45min down the rough 2 track and then a 30min hike only to run into a local that looked like he was off the cast of some elaborate character from moonsiners. 


  He was easily 6ft tall and slender with long dark and a black beard to the middle of his chest like a 1895 Phil Robertson from duck commander I thought to myself trying not to laugh aloud. He approached Cautiously eyeing me, before he could say anything I greeted him in a whisper with “seen anything?” He just stared at me with a long silence before finally speaking.

  You shouldn't be he here he said as he stared at me like I was in his living room uninvited.

 It's public land, I have a right to be here I replied in a hushed but raised voice. 

  He just looked at his back trail up the mountain and back to me when his hollow piercing dark eyes laid on me I just wanted him to take his gaze off of me and fast. 

  It's not safe here, you need to leave he said as he clutched his rifle at his side. You better be gone before dark. The nights not safe.

Just Unbelievable now I'm being threatened it seemed like it was his hunting spot and he thinks he owns the land. I leaned away to set my rifle up against a tree so I would be able to draw my .44magnum quickly if needed. Once it was against the tree I stood up and turned to face the man amd let him know I wouldn't be intimidated and I was going to continue to the saddle and hunt til dark but he was gone. Just poof. Gone.

  What a weirdo I thought chalking it up as he was hiding behind one of the large bull pines there. I gathered my rifle and continued west glancing back to see if he was watching but never saw another glimpse of him. Man that was wild he was dressed like he came out of a movie set I thought. Maybe he liked reenacting and wanted to go back to the Late 1800s early 1900s. Be cool to take a bear with that old single shot loaded with black powder cartridges just like the old days. 

  It's funny how fast my mind wrote it off as a local and I moved on. I could see the saddle and approached it with caution stepping from one large rock to another to be silent as possible. I froze in placed and scanned up ahead for the perfect place to sit. There it was a larget whiteoak with a cedar grown up next to about 4ft tall. I cleared the leaves back to reveal bare dark soil and the unmistakable fresh earth scent and settled in for my evening hunt. I could see around 150yds down the saddle that was covered in mixed hardwood and the steep mountain above me was choked with boulders, small cedars, mountain laurel and Brian's. Perfect bedding for a big buck. 

  It was almost 3pm and I haven't seen much of anything save for a grey squirrel 15min ago that was frantically burrying acorns under the leaves. Must be hard digging up here little buddy thought to myself. As I scanned the area I became more aware of smaller trees that were broke off about 7ft high all the way up the mountain that I could see. 7 in total all in a line. Must be a bear I thought and got excited about the bear hide on an old pack frame for a mount and all the bear jerky. The wind picked up as the cloud cover increased. Perfect conditions but why did it not feel perfect? The longer I sat the more I realized thar since the squirrel had left it had gotten dead quiet up there. 

 No birds making noise, no squirrels in the distance barking nothing. I had the feeling something was watching from the boulders but I couldn't see anything. I assured myself it was just my imagination and I wished I never watched all those videos on YouTube about missing people from national parks under odd circumstances. Boulders. Boulders where a common theme in the terrain they came up missing. I try to stuff it to the back of my mind and think about the giant that would walk out at any minute……. The longer I waited the worse the feeling got and everyone else sensed it too judging by how still the woods were. 


  I was hoping I would hear Michael shoot just.so I'd have an excuse to leave early when the smell hit me. It wasn't like any smell I had ever encountered before and I had been round plenty black bear to know it wasn't a bear. It was like a cross of wet dog, rotting meat and fresh dog crap from a dog that had a steady diet of cheap food. It was putrid and filled my nostrils. The increased sensation of being watched seemed to peak just below sheer terror. But for what? A smell? I couldn't see anything or hear anything for that matter, and what was with the strangers warning? “It's not safe here”? I just chalked it up to me invading a locals hunting spot or maybe he had a moonshine still somewhere close and thought I'd rat him out.

  But now? I wasn't sure and the wind shifted carrying the smell off with it. With the overcast and the sun sinking below the mountain it started to get dark early and I could hear moment from the boulders above me. I shifted around slow and quiet getting ready for a big buck to pop out at any minute it was close to the edge of briar and mountain laurel tangle I knew it would be there any second when it just stopped. No sound. Eerie silence on the mountain, not even the leaves rusted that still clung to trees. Just the tinnitus and nothing. When I heard an scraping noise like nails on chalkboard back up the mountain and too my left. It was no doubt the sound of large loose rock slowly pushed against a larger rock like something stepping slowly on it.

   I'm  not sure how I knew if it was just the gut feeling or perhaps some carry over spec on our DNA from an earlier time but I was being hunted and I knew it. I could heard what sounded like disembodied whispers coming from behind me that would come and go in undulating levels of intensity and every fiber of muscle was wanting to bolt down the mountain fast as possible but I knew it was too dangerous. I had to walk out. 

  Sunset was at 5:27pm but with the overcast it would be dark before then and it was already 4:55. I couldn't take it. Whatever it was it was behind me no more then 70yd away and felt like pure evil. Hatred even. The smell was back as the thermals pulled the scent from up the mountain downward. I stood quietly as possible and unsapped the button on the holster to my .44mag. I held my rifle to my shoulder and leaned around the tree not really sure what I expected to see but there was nothing. I looked into the thicket through the trijicon scope but could see nothing out of place. I slowly started down the way I had come half walking sideways so I could look back up the mountain and kept my rifle ready finger rested on the outside of the trigger guard and thumb on the safety ready to push it off.

  Just before I entered a thick spot of mountain laurel I had to work my down through I heard what sound like jaws popping shut like a bear or hungry wolf may make and caught a glimpse of movement behind the tree I was sitting against previously. I brought my rifle up but it was getting to hard to see. I could faintly make out a swaying from behind the tree. It would blur the edge of the tree in a steady rhythm maybe 8ft tall. Like it was taking such big breaths it forced it to become more visible when it inhaled. I thought I was scared off by a bear and my imagination when I realized in the fading light it had a pointed ear. Almost like that of a Doberman that had its ears cut. Bears don't have pointed ears it's time to go. NOW.


  It was a struggle to go through the loose rock and try to watch behind me whatever was there was always just out of side but I could hear it crunching the leaves clacking of rocks as it stepped and hear it popping its teeth together. Suddenly that .44mag that always gave me peace of mind suddenly felt like no more then a child's cap gun. I was moving as fast as I could now full blown adrenaline dump crashing through Brian's cutting my shins up and then the worst happened. 

  I went down hard and crashed into the rocks having been tripped up by a fallen limb about the size of your arm. I instinctively held my rifle up so it wouldn't get damaged as it could mean the difference in life or death. I was in terrible pain as my right knee and forearm took the brunt of the fall and I was scrambling to get up feeling the wetness of blood run down my right leg from the spill. I realized I was on a mound of football shapped rocks unmistakably in the shape of a shallow grave. Of course there's rocks all over but these were placed here deliberately. I could hear whatever was following me closing in as I get to my feet I hear something crashing towards me from in front.


  This is it I think as I get ready to fire my rifle from the hip in the now complete darkness at whatever is running at me with a now feverish jowel popping coming from behind like the smell of blood drove it into a frenzy just as I'm fixing to fire the noise in front of me darts off the side of the ridge past towards the creature behind me. Great now there's two of them ganged up I'm thinking as I'm trying to scramble down to the road still, if I can just get to it I could run without fear of tripping on these rocks.


  BOOM! I froze in my tracks. How did a gunshot come from behind me? I could smell the rotten egg acrid smell from black powder smoke. I remember the old man and the gun he was carrying. He must've had black powder loaded in his cartridges. No time to wonder.  I was getting out of there when I heard the shrieking and crashing around behind me followed by another BOOM! Then silence. Thar Erie foreboding silence when the deep laugh erupted and seemed to fill the holler with the maniacal laughter. 

  I hit the gated road that would lead back to the jeep running sure I was going to have a heart attack before I made it. 

  Michael was no where to be seen until everything was illuminated and at this point I figured why not I may as well get abducted by aliens but it was Micheal and headlamp you could see the next county with. He was terrified and frantically asking me what I shot and what the noises were as I unlocked the jeep throw my stuff in. We are off as I recount what happened. He had went back to the jeep and waited shortly after we parted ways because he though he heard talking and felt like he was being watched. We rode the rest of the way home in silence.

 That was the last time he went hunting. Said he didn't have time anymore but I feel like it had to do with all that happened that afternoon. 

  It was 4 years later when I found the article on folklore from the Ouachitas. One tale told of two bear hunters in 1901 that went into a big hollow set up camp and we're attacked on the second night. The survivor claimed he buried the other after he found him ripped to shreds by his bedroll after coming back into camp. Said he buried his friend and claimed a wild dog like beast 8ft tall killed him. Sheriff charged him with the murder and hung him.


  Now I question if it really was a local I ran into or something else entirely…..
