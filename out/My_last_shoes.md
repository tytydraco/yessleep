I shouldn’t have gone into that shop.

It wasn’t on the map. It wasn’t on the street yesterday. Just a narrow doorway squeezed between two shuttered buildings, a crooked sign above it: “Shoes For Every Soul.”

Inside, the air was heavy—like damp cloth and dust. Rows upon rows of shoes lined the walls. None of them had price tags. None of them looked new.

I wasn’t alone.

An old man stood behind the counter, his eyes pale as if cataracts had turned them into glass. He didn’t blink once. Just smiled with teeth too small for his mouth.

“You’ve come for a pair,” he said.

“I’m just looking,” I muttered. But the shelves pulled my gaze anyway. Shoes with scuffed soles, dried mud still caked in the grooves, laces frayed as though gnawed. None of them matched. Every pair was unique… too unique.

One caught my eye. Black dress shoes. Polished to a shine but cracked deep along the edges, as if they had walked for decades. Something about them felt… heavy.

Before I could stop myself, I picked them up.

Cold. Not leather-cold. Skin-cold.

The old man’s smile widened. “They chose you.”

I tried to put them back, but my fingers wouldn’t let go. The shoes pulsed faintly in my palms, like a heartbeat.

“Who wore these?” I asked.

He chuckled. “Who still wears them, you mean?”

The lights flickered. For a moment, I saw something impossible—rows of figures standing in the shop, blurred, faceless, barefoot. Their ankles were raw, red, torn open where shoes had once been ripped away. And they were staring at me.

I stumbled back. “What the hell is this place?”

The man leaned forward. “Every shoe has a soul. They walk until the owner can’t. Then the shoes… look for another.”

The shoes twitched in my grip. I dropped them, but they landed upright, toes pointed toward me like waiting feet.

“Why me?” My voice cracked.

“Because you’re next.”

I ran. I don’t even remember how I made it out the door. When I looked back, the shop was gone. Just brick walls.

I thought I was safe—until I got home.

They were there. By the bed. Perfectly placed. Waiting.

I locked them in the closet. Boarded it shut. But at night, I hear them shuffle inside, scraping against the wood. Sometimes, the boards bulge outward, like something’s pushing.

And the worst part?

Last night I dreamed of walking. Miles of endless road. My feet bled, skin peeling away inside the shoes. I tried to stop, but my body kept moving, every step tearing me apart. Ahead of me walked hundreds of others, their legs stiff, their shoes identical to mine.

When I woke, my sheets were damp with blood. My feet are blistered raw, though I never left the bed.

The truth is sinking in now. These aren’t just shoes.

They’re graves.

And once you wear them, you never stop walking. You just keep moving long after your body gives out, until the shoes decide they’re tired of you. Then they find another.

They’ve chosen me.

I hear them at the door right now. The boards are cracking. I don’t think I’ll be able to stop them much longer.

If you find a pair without an owner don’t touch them.
