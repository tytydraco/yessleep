It held a recipe card.

But instead of a recipe it read:

*Cactus Cacti*

*Dufus Dufi*

*Move from 2D to 3D*

*Or your ears will bleed till you die*

The penmanship was wack. Like bad graffiti from a Brooklyn train yard in the '80s.

Well, that was this morning. Now I've just been sitting at my desk in shock watching the clouds roll by and wondering why I keep seeing things slither out of the corner of my eyes.

I look back at the recipe card, but it keeps saying the same thing. And there's a little blood maybe coming out of my ear. Anyway, I figured I'd just write it all out in case some baby cactus comes shooting out my guts like in Alien.

It's not like the envelope was unexpected. It all started about a month ago when I met....

***Edna***

Edna was the new tenant who had moved into the apartment directly above me.

I figured out there was a new tenant above me because I immediately started picking up bad vibrations. I mean her footfalls sounded like there was a baby brontosaurus running rampant in apartment #3D. And it appeared to be revved up like a deuce, another buffalo running blind in the night.

Anyway, I caught sight of Edna in the ample flesh trying to open her mailbox the very next day. It appeared Edna was not doing well. She cornered me in the vestibule. 

There was a sticky note she had apparently put on the mailbox. Then as if downshifting from thinking to *herself* to speaking to *me*, "and then, it just won't open. I put the sticky noot \[sic\] on the box with highlighter but nobody rang my bell or gave me a new key or my mail. I might have very important correspondence, Walter! 

***Very, very important correspondence!*** **Don't you agree?!?**"

"I dunno. I haven't read your fan mail," I said and that's when Edna grabbed my upper arms hard and plainted, "What do I doooooo, Walt?"

"Don't call me Walt," I said. "And call the landlord. They'll help," as I wriggled free from her not negligible grip.

"Can you come with to call, Walt-I-I-I mean Walter!"

Scratching my head I stepped back.

Edna was not a small girl in the way Fatty Arbuckle was not a small boy.

"No," I said, doing a low-key Ali shuffle before floating like a butterfly out the vestibule door into the fresh air.

"I love you, Walt!!!!" was the last thing I heard but like I said my ears keep getting a bit bloody as of late so I ain't exactly sure what I heard is what was said, if you catch my drift.

Anyway, I didn't see Edna after that, and the sticky note was off her mailbox so I kind of chalked it up to life-sucking. And I did feel a little bad about stuff so I anonymously left a big thick burnt orange rug in a box on her doorstep.

I even heard her open her front door and exclaim, "OH MY GOD! NO WAY! A RUG! FOR MY BEDDY! JUST WHAT I PRAYED FOR!"

And just like that her buffalo steps were muffled enough to allow my life to return to some semblance of normalcy. Except for the teeth grinding and stuff. But you try to give up a 41 year nicotine habit cold turkey and you see if you get up to your ears in no sleep too.

But then the tap-tap-tapping began. Right outside my bedroom window. Sounded like a marble hitting the glass. And every time I got up to investigate it would stop. Tap-tap-tap. Plus I had that 3M plastic insulation over the window cause of the air conditioner and well, Brooklyn winter ain't exactly balmy.

And it kept happening. And I was compensating for the no nicotine with lots of cafe bustelo and even more nosleep but the hits just kept tap-tap-tappin' on my bedroom window. And not pleasantly tapping like Gregory Hines.

And then, two nights ago the proverbial shit hit the fan.

*This was no tapping accident.*

It was more like a **BAP! BAP! BAP!**

I got up and ripped that fucking plastic off. And guess what I saw?

A fucking mannequin head on a rope bang-bouncing off my bedroom window.

I screamed. Then I screamed again, even louder, when I realized the mannequin was me. I mean it looked just like me. Bald head. Big nose. Bigger ass lips.

And then I saw *blood* dripping out of its ears.

And then the bloody head went up, up & away. Gone man, like in one second.

That's when I'd had enough and my Brooklyn got the better of me like Spenser going off on bullies in Valediction.

That's when the dude in #2D laid in to the *#3D* bell trying to get a grip on reality.

From the other side of the door something stirred. Then, I felt the earth move under my feet. And then, well then the door opened and I saw ***it***.

Not just buffalo Edna. But the host of heads. Mannequin heads everywhere. And they all looked at me. But worse, they looked just fucking *like* me.

Some fucking Invasion of the Body Snatching bullshit right there I muttered under my breath feeling anger getting the bitter of my better.

Edna looked at me with the strabismus malocchio and said, "I knew you'd come for me, *Walt*!"

"Don't call me, Walt," I said and meant it. 

This was going too far. And there was a strange odor in her place. Like old cat food and mothballs and dirty socks.

"You're my soulmate!" she said and I said, "If you don't cut the shit Edna, I will complain. This is harassment."

And then Edna's face changed. It no longer looked out of touch with reality but more like she knew something nobody else did.

"How do you know your head is not one of mine?"

Then, without warning Edna's flesh-roll-laden hand suddenly darted out making a soft fist. Edna pinched my nose between the top portion of her bent index and fuck finger before jamming her left thumb up in my right nostril.

Her fingers smelled like cat food, mothballs and Velveeta.

"GOT YOUR NOSE," she bellowed before breaking into a witchy cackle that eventually doubled her over. I noticed her fuchsia gabardine stretch pants began to darken with a rapidly expanding wet spot. It began north expanding across Edna's thighs. The spot became a line that thickened as it traveled down, down, down past her cankles before pooling at her feet and beginning to seep into the hallway.

"Wanna come in and see my Walter collection, Walt?"

And that's when I felt my ears began to ring. Then I felt somebody step on my grave. Horrified, I deked for my crib without further ado.

Now I'm looking at the recipe card and wondering if I'm *cooked*....

Anybody got advice for this tired-ass bald dude whose head may, or may not, be made out of *bloody* plastic?

No cactus am I? Cacti?
