Help me and my friends are stuck in an abandoned hospital filled with faceless people.



So the day started off with me and my friends and we were hanging out at my house bored as all hell.



“Bro this is lame” Derek groaned at me.



“Yeah let’s do something”Alex said playfully, shoving me.  



“Okay fine, what do you guys want to do” I asked. 



“We could go and explore that abandoned hospital on the outside of town” Derek said hesitantly. 



“Bro no the lurker lives there” Alex responded his voice shaking.



“Seriously Alex there's no way you still believe in the lurker” Derek scoffed as he made fun of alex.



“Yeah don't be a wuss Alex” I retorted to Alex. 



“Come on we're going” I responded as I stood up. 



Alex and Derek stood up as we grabbed flash lights, just in case it got dark.



Then we left my house, the cold air cooling us off as we walked. “Alex, how can you still believe in the Lurker?” I asked. “Because i've seen it” Alex whispered as the wind blew through the air.



“Dude no you haven't” Derek scoffed at Alex.



“Yes, I have Derek. Stop being a dick Derek” Alex yelled at Derek.



Me and Derek snickered as we walked along the asphalt slowly turning to dirt



The trees blocked out the moon as we walked along the dirt, as I would catch glimpses of something moving just beyond my vision.



“Guys d-did you see that” Alex stammered as he spoke



“No Alex you're just being paranoid” Derek blurted out at Alex flicking him on the head.



“Goddamit Derek stop hitting me” Alex yelled as Derek giggled at Alex's outburst.



I could hear a faint whisper in the tree line I quickly turned and looked towards where i heard it 



“Shhhhhh I hear something” I said as we intently listened 

Alex let out little whimpers as I scanned the canvas of trees and shadows trying to see anything.



The moonlight peaked through the leaves and the smell of leaves filled my nose.  



As I scanned through the tree line I could make out the outline of what seemed to be a man's face, peeking out from behind a tree with a massive grin.



That was not what creeped me out, it was the fact that his face was twelve feet off the ground. A chill ran down my back as I concentrated on the man's face, the face darted behind the tree.



I stood there my body feeling ungodly heavy my heart hammered against my chest



Alex touched my shoulder 



“Did you see something?” he asked as his voice was not even above a whisper and his hand was shaking. 



I listened for anything but all I could hear was the wind blowing through the wind 



“Bro what are you guys doing” Derek said as he shook us out of it  



Me and Alex quickly shushed him, the sound of twigs snapping and leaves rushesling getting closer. 



We didn't even wait, we just broke out into a full sprint as our feet dug into the dirt as we ran and stumbled.



We all staggered out of the forest, the moonlight hit my face. 



I looked up and there it was the abandoned hospital. It stood in the moonlight, a monolith in the shadows of the night.



I quickly turned around and fumbled with my flashlight as I used it to look through the tree line frantically, my breath coming in ragged gasps.



“Guys what the was that”Derek yelled at us his voice was shaking. 



“There was a man in the woods” I whispered to him.



We all slowly staggered to the hospital not looking away from the tree line.



The sound of twigs crunching echoed through the night sky.



We continued to back up into the hospital and fell in are body slammed against the ground with loud thuds



Alex and I swiftly pushed ourselves off the ground and looked towards the treeline.



The now forgotten in our hands.



I could only make out faint shadows moving through the trees.



It went dead silent all I could hear was my ragged breathing and Derek and alex standing up.



“What do you mean?”Derek whispered his voice echoed through the abandoned hospital.



“What was that Jacob” He asked his me as hid behind me 



Before Derek could fully interrogate me we all heard it a loud snap.  



We all stood there looking at the treeline with our breaths coming in ragged gasps as we stood in silence.



The wind completely stopped as if holding its breath in anticipation.

 

The silence lasted for three minutes as the wind blew through the air.



Derek tried to speak but the sound of another twig snapping rang through the cold night air this time closer.



I turned around and motioned for us to move deeper into the hospital slowly and quietly.



Every step we took was painstakingly loud and slow in the nights air 



With every step we made every breath we took as we made our way further into the abandoned hospital.



As we made our way deeper into the hospital the sound of twigs snapping leafs russelling grew louder and louder



I felt my breath catch in my throat as I slowly turned around to look towards the entrance.



Time seemed to stop as I processed what I was seeing.



There were a pair of elongated legs that stood at the entrance of the hospital motionless.



I felt my blood run cold and my mouth went dry as I struggled to stand my body shook.



The thing's hands slowly descended, its fingertips were replaced with multiple baby hands, its multiple pairs of hands slowly gripped the frame of the door, its bones creaked with every movement. 



I felt the urge to scream slowly run through my body.



Alex grabbed my hand and dragged me into one of the empty rooms his hands shook as he put a finger to his lips.



His eyes were filled with fear as he looked at me.



“Wait weres derek” I whispered to Alex my voice not even above a whisper then a loud baby like shriek filled the hospital.



My eyes darted towards the hallway to see Derek standing there, his body shaking, his body paralyzed with fear.



The hospital shook as the sound of moist hands smashing against the ground filled the building. 



The thing crawled over to Derek as he tried to scream his body shook as the thing slowly cupped his face making him look at its face.



It let out a loud squeal as a bright light shined from its face covering Derek's face.
