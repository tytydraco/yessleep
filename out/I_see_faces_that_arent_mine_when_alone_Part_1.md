Throughout my life, I have believed that ghosts and the paranormal are not real, and are instead figments of the imagination, created to stimulate the brains fascination with the unknown. However, my bravery up to this point in life is now in question by both me and my girlfriend ever since I began explaining to her what I've being seeing both in the day and at night.

For a little bit of context, we have recently moved into a apartment complex that sits just outside of the city, in-which we both work. This complex however once existed as an "lunatic asylum" in the early 20th century, as was alleged to having staff brutally assaulting its residents. The conditions in which this place existed have been described as "horrid" and "hellish". Due to this it closed for many years before being bought and refurbished in the early 2000's. I believe that this may have some kind of supernatural link to my present issue, but I'm not too sure right now.

With this in my mind, what I'm about to explain is just one of the accounts of the things I've been seeing:

In the evenings when the sunset hits my windows, and the dark begins to set in, I begin to feel uneasy. Trapped almost. Like I'm being watched and I don't want to be caught looking. Usually I can just shake this feeling off as tiredness from the days work I'll have done, but on my days off the feeling just isn't right. The hairs on my neck stand up, and I feeling oddly stiff across my body. All of this to me was just something that I thought was just in my head, until the other day when I saw something looking at me in a mirror that sits across my bedroom. It was only glimpse, and in my mind was just a trick of the light. Nonetheless it got a jump out me me before I brushed it off, and decided to go to bed. Shit like this started happening every now and again, where I'd see something out of the corner of my eye but i always just called myself a idiot and moved on. This was until the other day.

I was brushing my teeth before going to bed at around 10pm, when I looked up from rinsing to see half a darkened face peering around my door. It was a shadow with dead, staring eyes and opened maw just staring at me, like a curious animal. I jumped out skin before turning to see nothing there but my wardrobe and laundry basket. But I know what I saw. This face was real. Within that second of seeing it, its expression has been engrained into my head, like it's become a part of me. I slept with my light on that night regardless and struggled to sleep even like that.

I now keep seeing this face everywhere I go. Wherever there's a dark corner, I see its eyes gazing at me, and whenever I'm on my own, I feel it watching me from behind. Almost like a predator with prey. I told my girlfriend after a few weeks because she began to question frequently why i seemed jumpy when I'm in the flat. It's safe to say that she thinks I'm a bit mad. I don't blame her.

I wanted to share my story because I feel as if its presence is only getting more daring, and i worry that it'll advance further. I shall submit further notices if such a thing happens, but for now, wish me luck.
