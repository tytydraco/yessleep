I stared at the list, read it over and over again, I was so shocked that I had already memorized the entire list, every word. Okay, I've read many stories about rules on Reddit and this list isn't that weird, let's be rational, I really shouldn't help other employees, they might want to take advantage of my kindness and they're also getting paid, right? And let's be honest, coming back at 3am is really dangerous, it's best to avoid leaving so late unnecessarily, and about the tent, maybe, well, I shouldn't go in where it's not a problem, well, it's okay.

I kept repeating to myself so many times that the rules were normal and rational that I even gained enough confidence to start work.

I looked at the list of toys that needed fixing.

1 - fix the fence behind the hot dog cart, all the necessary equipment in the cabinet next to the desk.

2 - pick up the trash around the cart, the cleaner didn't come today.

3 - fix one of the bumper cars, it has a loose steering wheel, blue car.

ok, reasonable, for a first day there are few things to fix.

I went out of my office and there was silence, it seemed like I was completely alone, which scared and comforted me at the same time, I went first to fix the fence, it seemed easy to me, I had everything I needed for that so I went there.

there were several carts lined up, hot dog carts, ice cream carts, among other carts with other foods full of sugar and sodium, in one of the carts, the one furthest away, there was a guy wearing a uniform, I assumed it was another employee, his back was bent, he seemed to be picking something up, I ignored him.

I started fixing the fence. It was an easy job to put up some more boards, put in some nails, and it was done. Nothing difficult so far. I walked over to the bumper car to try to fix the steering wheel and I saw that it was next to the circus. This made me a little nervous. I could hear some footsteps inside the tent, people laughing and talking. It seemed warm and friendly. It made me feel even more paranoid because I was so scared of the rules.

I got to the car and started trying to tighten the steering wheel. It was almost done. I don't know if it was the feeling of curiosity, because I had been asked not to go to the tent. I had an uncontrollable urge to go inside the tent. I kept looking at him and he seemed more handsome every time I looked out of the corner of my eye, more attractive, more inviting.

I was trying to stay sane, reminding myself of the rules.

"Don't go in the tent, DON'T GO IN."

I tried my best to ignore the tent. I went to do the last thing on the list, clean the floor near the hot dog cart. I looked at the time and was shocked, it was already 12:00. How was that possible? The fence took a while, but not that long. I ran to clean near the cart as quickly as possible.

I just wanted to finish everything and go to my room, look at the time and play some stupid game until it was 2:55 and go home and get my money, that's all.

I got to the cart and the floor was really filthy, it needed to be cleaned. In front of all the carts it was filthy, full of hot dog wrappers and even pieces of ice cream cones. Who doesn't eat the cones? There must be exotic children in this park.

I started cleaning until I heard footsteps coming behind me. Someone touched my shoulder and I felt my soul go back and forth. I looked and it was the guy who was moving things when I came to fix the fence. His uniform had his name on it: Noof. What kind of idiot is called Noof? It's the worst name I've ever heard.

"Hey, man, a lot of work today?"

"Actually, no, I'm almost done with everything, what do you do for a living?"

"I clean things, organize some things, clean up the vomit of kids who have the brilliant idea of ​​eating too much ice cream and going on the fast rides."

"I'm a handyman, basically fixing random things."

"Do you want help with that?"

I was on the alert "don't accept help from anyone", but honestly, these rules seem exaggerated to me, the tent seemed nothing more than warm and friendly, there were people laughing and having fun while they were probably organizing things inside, and nothing strange happened, and this guy seems perfectly normal to me, maybe I should refuse just to be safe?

"No need, you better finish your job."

"Are you sure? There's a lot to clean."

"It's okay! Don't worry."

"Okay, I'll be near the tent if you need help."

"Okay."

I kept thinking about the rules, how I should refuse any help and that they would beg me to help, but this guy seemed very calm and not at all insistent.

I continued cleaning.

When I finished I looked at the clock, 2am, ok, I'm going to my room and stay there until it's close to my exit time, on my way I passed by the tent and bumped into Noof again.

"Are you done?"

"Yes, finally."

Do you want to come with me and the others? We'll play cards inside.

I was a little nervous. He wasn't insisting, he was simply making me a proposal. Looking back on those rules now, they seem ridiculous and exaggerated. All the other employees must be inside chatting to pass the time, and I was refusing to do so so I could stay isolated in my office, scratching my balls.

-"Sure, let's go."

We were going to the tent, talking about the park, making small talk. I heard the sound coming from the tent again. It seemed a little different now, as if the conversations were kind of fake, you know those superficial conversations in movies, when the main actors just pass by people on the street, as if they wanted to seem like they were having fun. It wasn't the same as what I heard before. I was nervous.

Noof was a few inches behind me, talking to me, but I could feel his eyes reading me, seeing if I was calm or nervous. I looked at the clock, 2:30, almost time for me to leave. I was tense. It seemed like a different atmosphere now. When I got to the entrance of the tent, it was closed. Noof just looked at me and smiled. He opened the tent for us to enter. I looked inside and nothing. It was all dark, as if no one had ever been inside.

I remembered the laughter, the warm conversations, and I felt like I was crazy, dreaming all of this. I felt Noof's eyes behind me, looking inside me, reading each of my actions.

*PLUFT* I got scared, so I looked at the stage and saw a guy dressed as a clown lying on the floor.

The lights came on, there were several people dressed as clowns in the chairs, drooling and staring at the stage, they seemed hypnotized, the guy on the stage started to say:

*we were waiting for you, what's taking so long, you idiot* and a forced and bizarre laugh from him and everyone in the audience started, everyone was looking at me.

I felt a strong blow to the head, Noof hit me with something made of iron, I passed out immediately.

When I woke up I was sitting in one of the chairs, tied up, watching the show, I'm dressed as a clown, I'm not sure how much time has passed, my head hurts, I hear footsteps outside the tent, it sounds like a hammer hitting wood, it's dark here and everyone seems anxious, shaking with anticipation, excited for the next one to come on, I hear Noof's voice in the distance, talking to someone.

I remember the damn pamphlet that brought me here, I remember the conversation with the owner of this hell, talking to me as if he wasn't leading me to my end, I remember the rules, one in particular.

1 - just do YOUR job, if other employees come asking for your help, or offering help, don't help, don't accept, turn around and continue your tasks, don't answer, the more you talk, the more they will insist and maybe convince you.

I remember my work list.

2 - pick up the trash around the cart, the cleaner didn't come today.

I remember the first conversation I had with Noof.

"actually no, I'm almost done with everything, what do you do for a living?"

"I clean things, organize some things, clean up the vomit (...)"

"The cleaner didn't come today..."

"I'll clean things up..."

There's 1 more empty seat next to me, apparently there's only 1 more person left, something big is going to happen, something the world wasn't expecting.

I don't know what they did to me. When will the next person come? When will it happen? I'm so happy, so excited, I can't wait.

I've never written a horror or suspense story, this is the first one, I did it more to distract myself and try something new, I hope it was fun to read it, hugs <3
