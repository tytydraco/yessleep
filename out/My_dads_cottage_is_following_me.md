Growing up my dad always talked about his family’s cottage. It was a little lakeside spot in Ontario that my grandpa built when my dad was young. They spent every summer there. Tales of the dogs being goofy and teenage watersport shenanigans were common around our dinner table, but because my dad had moved across the country here to British Columbia after marrying my mom I’d only seen the cottage once as a kid.

I was ten, and some of my memories of the cottage are pretty vivid. It was my first cross country flight, it was a place that had been built up in stories for years, but most of all it was just a fun place for a ten year old. Well most of it was fun. The cottage itself was a bit of a let down, it was small, three cramped bedrooms lined up at the back of the house with a single larger room at the front that housed the kitchen in one corner, the table against the windows at the front, and a little seating area to the side with a shelf of board games and books. My dad and I generally ended our days there with a game or two of cribbage using the old beaten up board he would pull off that shelf. There was a map of the surrounding area hung up on the back wall and a truly terrifying shag rug in the sitting area. The kitchen relied heavily on linoleum. The dining table was a work of art though, built by my grandpa with one of the fallen trees on the property so it was the perfect length for the whole family to have a spot to sit. The cottage had a gently peaked roof and a small stilted porch to keep the whole place level as the lakefront gently sloped down to the water. It was wood paneled all the way around, with an electrical box at the back and a second, burnt silhouette of an electrical box next to it from where the cabin had been struck by lightning back when my dad was in his teens.

That trip was the only time I got to meet my grandpa in person, and even then there were a lot of us there. It was a family reunion, so with my dad’s two brothers, one sister, plus spouses and cousins, there were enough people at the lake that most of us were staying at neighbors’ places nearby. The only moment I got alone with my grandpa we played tic tac toe on a cheap aluminum set that my grandpa had found down the back of the bookshelf. He beat me three times in a row. Not a surprise, I was ten after all. Just like my dad he was a sore winner, and I had a sneaking feeling he would have been an even worse loser, though I didn’t find out on that trip.

But another reason why I have such vivid memories of that trip is because of what happened on the day we were leaving. I was coming up from the water towards the cottage when I saw someone tall and unfamiliar strolling casually around from the back of the house and up towards the front door. Someone I didn’t recognize heading up to the cottage wasn’t weird, it had happened half a dozen times while we were there, neighbors came calling pretty regularly and with so much family in town it might just have been the next distant relation rolling in after us. But two things were strange, even to a ten year old. Firstly, the way the figure walked was odd, springy and leaned-back, like how people look when they walk backwards, except they were walking forwards. And secondly, the figure looked shadowed, like when you’re standing in the sunlight looking at someone in the shade. Just a bit harder to make out details. The odd part was it was the middle of the day, and the figure walked through no shady spots, yet I couldn’t make out their face or exactly where their limbs ended. 

All strange adults are hard to tell apart as a kid, and I was already heading back to the cottage, so I followed it up and through the front door, surprised to find there was nobody inside once I got there. I went through every room of the cottage, checked the closets, checked under the table and the sink. Nobody was in the cottage, maybe for the first time since we had arrived, including the stranger I had just seen enter. It’s a little thing, almost certainly a combination of a child’s imagination and a bit of misremembering, but now I’m not so sure. Now I think it wasn’t a person at all that wandered casually around the back of my dad’s old cottage and disappeared inside of it. 

The important thing to remember is that this cottage existed in Ontario, across the country from where I live. It was built four or five decades before I was even born, by a man I only met once.

My grandpa passed away when I was fourteen. It was sad, but mostly sad because of how hard it was on my dad. Their relationship was complicated, and I know they didn’t get the chance to really sort things out before he went. Not that they ever would have, neither of them were good at talking about emotions. We flew back for the funeral but it was hectic and we didn’t get a chance to visit the cottage again; it passed to my uncle, Paul, my dad’s older brother, and I figured I would probably never see it again.

I was very wrong.

That summer I was invited to a friend’s family cabin on the Sunshine Coast. Ocean coast, not lake. We would be there for a week, romping around and swimming and talking about the girls we liked, the perfect way to spend a couple weeks as a teen.

When we arrived we pulled up around the back of the place, wood paneled and one level. I was pretty focused on being a good guest so I helped pull stuff out of the back, grabbing the massive cooler with a week’s worth of food and carrying it around the front, up the steps to the stilted porch and in the front door, where I dropped it in surprise.

The cabin looked exactly like my grandpa’s.

It had a long table at the front that was made from a single tree trunk, a horrible shag carpet, three bedrooms at the back, a linoleum kitchen in the corner, and a map on the back wall. My friend’s family followed me in and the following interaction went something like this.

“Hey you okay?” asked my friend’s mom, clearly a little annoyed I had dropped the cooler.

“Yeah, just, this looks exactly like my dad’s family cottage back in Ontario,” I replied.

“Oh that’s funny. It was probably built around the same time as this place. My dad built it when I was very young, I know architecture wasn’t his specialty, he just wanted everyone to have somewhere to sleep and somewhere to eat. We added the porch when I was about your age, nice to have somewhere to have coffees in the morning, y’know?”

“Yeah, I guess it was probably the same with my grandpa. Plus with the water right there I suppose there’s not that many design options,” I said. In the end I guess I did half the job of convincing myself that it was a coincidence of waterfront cottage design.

My friend’s mom helped me bring the cooler to the fridge so I wouldn’t drop it again, and we finished unloading the car. My bag had been shimmied to the back of the trunk so I went out last to grab it and close up, and it wasn’t until then that I noticed on the back of the cottage there was a scorched silhouette of an electrical box right next to the working one. 

When I asked my friend about it he claimed it was caused by them having a fire too close to the back of the place one night. When I pointed out it looked exactly like an electrical box he said, “oh yeah, weird.”

I should have left then, although I don’t think it would have helped.

Being fourteen and not wanting to dwell on anything that didn’t involve running around and high school gossip, the spooky similarity of it all slipped out of mind. I had only been ten when I saw my dad’s childhood place after all. 

On the last night I was staying with my friend I noticed the map on the back wall was of lake country Ontario, not coastal British Columbia. I would have asked someone about it but everyone had already turned in. I had stayed up reading, catching some much needed alone time after a week of sharing space with someone else’s family, and had just closed my book and was doing a last look over the cottage, noting the eerie similarities one more time when I decided to take a closer look at the map. It was worn and a little faded, but undeniably Ontario, it had the towns and lakes listed.

I brushed my teeth in the kitchen sink, hairs on the back of my neck standing on end the whole time. The cottage only had an outhouse with no real bathroom, and changed in the front room to avoid disturbing my friend, and just as I was going to creep in and try to fall asleep I heard a noise behind me. It was the clinking of an aluminum tic tac toe set.

I turned around and my grandpa was sitting at the long kitchen table, pulling the pieces off the little board. He looked up at me and scowled ever so slightly.

“Come on kid, we said we would play, let’s play,” he looked back down and started sorting the pieces into x’s and o’s.

I don’t believe in ghosts. Not in the way they’re generally represented and talked about at least, if ghosts exist I think they can only be an extremely personal, immeasurable and unfathomable phenomenon. And at that point there were only three realistic possibilities for what was happening to me. The first was simply that I had fallen asleep while reading and was having a vivid dream, which was very likely. The second was that this was some kind of hallucination or psychotic break, decently likely considering just how vivid this all was, I could remember where I had been prior to this, I could feel, see, hear, and smell. And finally there was the possibility that this was a genuine visit from my dead grandfather, his ghost, spirit or lingering soul. In the first option I was in no danger, the second option, if my brain had already broken none of this would matter, and if this was actually a visit from my late grandpa I figured I should spend some time with him while I could.

So I sat down at the table and played tic tac toe.

At some point between the ages of 10 and 14 I had gotten a brief spurt of interest into game theory, strategy and solved games. So, I knew how to always win (or at least never lose) at tic tac toe. We started playing in silence, and it being a children's game the first round ended quickly, with me winning. My grandpa scowled again, squinting at the board.

“Finally learning, boy. Good,” he said, but he didn’t look happy about it.

The next game he went first, and we drew.

“It’s cold here, eh,” my grandpa said as we were setting up the board again, “wasn’t expecting it to be so cold.”

“I guess,” I said. It wasn’t that cold, nippy at worst. I followed it up with the question that had been burning at me since I sat down, “how are you here Grandpa?”

He smiled with his lips pressed together. “I’ll need a scotch before I can answer that properly,” he said, and gestured for me to go first.

“Did you just come to play tic tac toe with me? Do you have something you want to tell me? Or… ask me to do?”

He huffed. “Can’t a man just play some games with his –” he looked up at me and then back down at the board, “grandson? Is that so strange?” He placed his piece.

*It is if he’s dead,* I thought to myself, but apparently the powers of authority and ancestry extend beyond death because I didn’t say it out loud. I placed my next piece and my grandpa got very still. I think he was realizing he was going to lose again.

“Let me win,” he said quietly, looking down. His voice had gone flat and cold.

“What? Why?” I said, perhaps a little more sharply than I should have. It was stupid, but when I was ten he had never let me win, why should the rules change now?

“Please,” he said, and something fell out of his mouth onto the board. It was a tooth. He looked up and said, “please let me win, I can’t stay here.” But I couldn’t register his words because one of his front teeth fell out as he spoke, and before it could hit the table another tooth folded into place from behind it. Another tooth, then two then three fell out of his mouth, pushed by teeth from behind like dominoes, but they were coming faster than his teeth could fall, clattering tinnily onto the aluminum board, his mouth was full of teeth and they weren’t slowing down. “Please!” he yelled, muffled by a mouth full of bone, and stood up reaching out to grab me by the shoulders. Before he could touch me a voice said something behind me and I wrenched around to ask for help.

My friend was standing there looking disgruntled and not at all freaked out by the tooth-filled old man behind me. I looked back and my grandpa was gone, along with the fallen teeth and tic tac toe board. It was just a quiet, empty cabin looking out at the water.

Apparently I had been yelling and had woken my buddy up. I apologized and said I would explain in the morning. I think he could tell that I was freaked out because he didn’t push any further, and we clambered into the bunk beds to sleep. I was very glad to be in a room with another person, but I didn’t get very much sleep that night. I told him the whole story on the drive back the next day, everything from the cottage similarities to the strange figure to my grandpa begging to win. When I got finished he held his arm up to me.

“Look at that,” he said pointing at his arm, “you got my hairs to stand on end. Dang dude, why didn’t you tell that one around the fire last night? That’s a perfect ghost story, I’m gonna steal it.”

I told him I was serious, that it wasn’t just a ghost story, but all he said was “I believe you man, that’s why it’s so spooky!” And then said he would draw a salt ring around the cottage next time we went, but I was never invited back. Mostly because life changed quite a bit for me when I got back home.

My uncle Paul had died suddenly that weekend. He had been sick on and off in his youth, and the combination of immuno-suppressant drugs he had been taking for decades were hard on his heart, which gave out. Uncle Paul had visited us every third christmas or so, he called regularly, he was close with my dad. Obviously, my father took the news hard, compounded by the fact that a lot of Paul’s estate was passed on to him. Including the cottage.

My dad got very busy very fast. On top of his work he was flying back and forth to Ontario to sort his brother’s will, organize the funeral, visit the family. Paul had been a fun uncle but a bit of a… disheveled individual from an adult’s perspective. He had made some strange monetary decisions that my dad was determined to rectify, or as my dad used to say, “what kind of an idiot would do that on purpose?!” This was often followed by an angry outburst at whoever made the next loud noise, and then a period of quiet stillness where he was clearly trying not to cry, and everyone else was trying not to make any noise. My dad was never great with emotions.

The summer I was sixteen we flew out as a family to Ontario. It was a concentrated effort to see our relations for something other than a funeral, since those had been the only other times we’d been back. We did a bunch of touring around, saw our parents’ childhood homes, went to a Blue Jays game, and went up to the cottage.

I was pretty apprehensive.

I had divulged my terrifying evening at my friend’s cottage when visiting Ontario had first come up, and that launched my dad into a story about his ghostly visit from an old Boy Scout leader when he was in college, which led to a story about the one time he had tried magic mushrooms, which led to the beginning of a story about Uncle Paul’s stoner phase that my dad stopped halfway through. I brought it up again as we were pulling down the long drive towards the cottage, but my dad didn’t respond. My brother called me a coward and pulled out one of my arm hairs.

We crept around the final bend and could see the cottage, its scorched back end the definitive marker. To me it seemed to be hunched down and waiting, poised on nonexistent haunches waiting to spring, full of a strange and undesirable life. But to my dad it was clearly far too devoid of life. We came to a halt and nobody got out of the car. Everyone was silent. Then my dad started to cry, the full bodied sobs of a man left without a trace of his childhood. His cottage once bustling with life and happiness, youth and family was now just an empty shell, a few walls and a roof. Hollow. My mom put a hand on my dad’s arm until the sobs stopped and then without a word we turned around and began the drive back. I couldn’t help but feel relieved, and also a little guilty that I hadn’t been able to summon any excitement about the cottage to make my dad feel like it was alive again.

Life was normal for a long time after that. I went through high school, got into one of the local universities, met a girl, all the big life stuff you’re supposed to do. Everything was as it should have been for a long time, and it was the easiest thing in the world to forget one odd coincidence that caused a bad dream when I was fourteen.

And then my dad got sick.

It started as skin cancer. Normally skin cancer is one of the most treatable types, but it cropped up on him fast, small, and in multiple spots. The doctors did the best they could at cutting the tumors off, and he was doing chemo regularly, but they clearly missed something, or it was just too aggressive. It got into his lymph nodes and spread, beyond the point of operation. It was about a year and a half of watching my dad wither, being eaten in parts by the many small cancers across his head, his jaw, his back, as well as by the treatments trying to keep him alive. It was slow and brutal. You could hardly recognize him by the end, not just physically because of the many surgical sites that had never healed properly, his locked jaw taking his weight down to just a skeletal frame; but also because all of his fiery emotion had been sapped from him. He was hollow when he died. Skin and bone and weeping sores, missing teeth and glazed eyes, with sickly skin and a crooked back.

The following months were a rollercoaster of terrible emotions, anyone who’s been through grief will tell you something similar, but I was finally starting to come out of it when my girlfriend’s family invited me to their ski cabin for a weekend. It would be a nice couple days away from it all. Some cold air in my face and a cozy fire sounded perfect. 

Her parents were always talking about this cabin, “the Chateau” as they called it, because they had been slowly and painstakingly renovating it by hand for the last three years. They were always excitedly mysterious about it when pressed, just saying they had put a lot of work into it and we would get to see it when it was ready, which it finally was.

My girlfriend and I drove up together on Friday after class, her family already up there opening the place up. The sun was out and I was feeling well and truly happy, music playing loud, landscape snowy and clean. I wasn’t thinking about how this was my first time visiting anything resembling a cottage since I was fourteen, after all it was “the Chateau” not a cottage in any sense of the word. But when we pulled into the cul-de-sac my blood ran cold. I knew this place.

The Chateau stood out like a sore thumb, every other cabin was made of a mix of stone and rounded logs, with firewood stacked under steep A-frame eaves and small windows to make insulation easy. The Chateau was my dad’s old cottage, wood paneled, gently peaked roof, a stilted front porch that should have been impossible on flat ground but for some reason wasn’t. 

My girlfriend parked the car and hopped out excitedly.

“Come on, I can’t wait to see what they’ve done with the inside,” she said and bustled up the steps, the sight of her going up stairs but remaining on the ground floor hurting my brain, and disappeared inside. I got out into the silent white stillness of the winter evening. I walked around back to find the burned shadow of the electrical box where I already knew it was. I stood in front of the cottage in the quiet, feeling numb but not from the cold. 

I guess I don’t quite know why I went inside. Undoubtedly there was the naturally dangerous human curiosity that drove it to a certain extent, the need to find out how this could be, but there must have been more at work inside of me than just that. I may never know.

I was expecting to find my girlfriend’s family inside, the three of them marvelling over a linoleum kitchen that looked like it was from the seventies even though they had just renovated it, a shag carpet, an inexplicable map of Ontario. But this time the cottage didn’t wait for the deep of night. When I stepped inside there was only one person there, still skeletal thin, cancerous sores still openly weeping: my dad.

In his hand he clutched a cribbage board. It was the same one that lived on the bookshelf in his childhood cottage, this cottage as I’m now sure it was, and he clutched it in his emaciated hand like a drowning man clutches a lifesaver. 

As I entered my dad began to move, painstakingly making his way over to the long kitchen table and began to set up the cribbage board.

“Come on kiddo, let’s see if I can skunk ya,” he said. It was clear that he was trying to be lighthearted, trying to summon the essence of cheer we used to have when we played crib on weekend afternoons, but the cancer in his jaw meant he had to speak through nearly clenched teeth. And his eyes were still so hollow. 

I had sat down and cut the deck before I really registered it. I had dreamt of my dad pretty frequently since he died, always something along the same lines. I would be going about a regular day when I would be struck with the sudden reminder that my dad was dead, that I would never see him again or hear his voice, and just as I would begin truly breaking down over this fact he would arrive. Walk in through the front door or bike up the driveway, not just alive but cancer free and happy. And then in the midst of my new relief that his death had all been a terrible misunderstanding I would wake up to the reality that he was in fact gone.

This was like the reverse of that. I felt like I was in a dream where I thought my dad was alive, he was right in front of me after all, but he would drop dead just as I realized it. Maybe that would be for the best.

We played in silence. The cards were shuffled and handed out, decisions made, pegging done back and forth, points counted, and repeat. It’s impossible to truly get enough time with the ones you love, impossible to say absolutely everything you need to say, but despite this we played in silence. Just the sound of cards and pegs. 

I was losing.

I had been playing with my head down for some time, afraid to meet my father’s hollow eyes, when I heard him make a noise and looked up. The tumors on his head had grown, multiplied horribly beyond what they ever had been in life, blood streaking from burst skin and dripping onto the table and floor, flaps of skin and chunks of hair dangling from his face, forced aside by the swollen tumors. His jaw was now totally locked by the masses, but I saw that for the first time tonight, the first time in months before he died, his eyes were clear.

“Run,” he said, clear as day. 

I did. I didn’t hesitate, I didn’t wait for him to repeat himself. I can’t help but feel like in that moment it was truly my dad speaking to me, not the horrid cottage that had been following me for the last decade, or whatever terrible creature that had made its home inside of it, but some version of my dad that reached out to speak that word. 

I leaped for the door, the old hinges squealing as I ripped it open. I heard noises behind me, wet splatters like massive zits popping, and the sound of something hard and brittle scraping across wood. As I got the door open, there was a sound like  someone twice my size vomiting and belching at the same time, and a gust of air was vacuumed past me into the cottage. I didn’t look back. I made it to the car and got it started with no issues, operating entirely on instinct, before I looked up as I backed down the drive. The mouth of the cottage yawned open, my dad’s disfigured form silhouetted in the entry, seeming to hang like a puppet rather than stand. I drove away in a daze.

My girlfriend called me 20 minutes later. I immediately felt awful. I had ran, without sparing a thought for her or her family, and realized with a wash of relief when she called that I had assumed they had been absorbed or murdered by the strange cottage. Hearing her voice was a balm, I made up a lie about getting a frantic call from my mom and apologized for not coming inside to let her know about my sudden departure. I resolved to ask her about the Chateau later, what she saw when she entered it, where she had been when I went inside, but I was too rattled to ask then and there. I don’t think anything she would have said would have helped, at most it would have made me sound crazy. Although, I suppose I must be.

You see, I drove home to my mother’s house, my childhood home. Where I grew up, where my family still lives, the most comforting place I know, a building I am so intimate with I can navigate it inside and out with my eyes closed. But I turned the corner onto our block just now and it isn’t my home that’s sitting just behind the sidewalk.

It’s my dad’s old cottage.
