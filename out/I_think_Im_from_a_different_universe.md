I almost wish that I was crazy. Then what happened would make sense. It could be written off as a problem in my brain that had an answer as to why it had happened. Maybe it would have happened more than once so I could write it off as something explainable. Hallucinations. A break in reality in my head. But no. This only happened once and nothing has seemed right since.

When I was a teenager, just shy of my sixteenth birthday, my class took a trip into the city to visit an art museum. I was never big on art, so to say I wasn’t paying the greatest deal of attention was an understatement. I never understood what the big deal is about some of these works that dead people of the past have made. Yes, they are beautiful and impressive. No, I could never in a million years paint something that amazing. But I simply don’t get what the big deal is. But there was this one painting in one of the rooms in the back. It caught my eye long enough for me to be distracted by it. Nothing spectacular about it. The colours of the smears of paint of whatever abstract thing the artist was trying to convey caught my eye.

Then everything around me was quiet. Eerily quiet for the middle of the afternoon with more than one school in the building for field trips. I turned around and I was completely alone. The room was empty of my classmates who had been with me just a moment ago. Thinking I had been left behind as they moved on to the next room, I made my way through the museum only to see more and more empty rooms. The further I walked…the more deserted the place looked. The lights got dimmer as if the bulbs were in desperate need of changing. The walls and rooms got empty and emptier the more rooms I passed through trying to find my class.

The creepiest part was that I couldn’t find the exit. Look, I know museums are big and can be a bit of a maze at times. But I couldn’t find any sort of exit out of the building. I couldn’t even see any exit signs after a while.

At this point, I am completely freaked out. Did I stumble into the backrooms that everyone online is always talking about? It can’t be. That’s just another silly internet urban legend. Though it really is the only explanation I can come up with. With those thoughts in my head, I started running back the way I had come. Maybe I could retrace my steps and everything would be okay again. Right?

What felt like hours passed of me walking when I turned a corner and everything was back to normal. The art was back on the walls, people were shuffling through the rooms, and my class was…right there looking at that same abstract painting that had caught my eye so long ago. I caught the eye of my teacher and she gave this little nod to me as if to acknowledge my reappearance but nobody else said anything! It was as if those hours I spent running through the empty museum never happened.

For the rest of the trip I stayed so close to my teacher that more than once she had to ask me to back up, to give her some personal space. Back at school, things were so normal seeming that I was almost angry. I kept expecting something to be out of place or different. Yet it was all the same. My locker was still a mess, my bus was still number 47 that took me to the church a few blocks from my home. Even the ever changing bulletin board outside the church was the same! 

That was until I got home. It’s hard to explain. Things felt as if they were supposed to be there, but they were in the wrong spots. It sounds silly writing it all out now but it’s true. On my desk in my room, my lamp was always on the corner of the desk closer to my bed but now it sat in the corner by the wall. It wasn’t as if someone had moved it while I was at school. There was no ring of dust or discolouration from where it had been. No, that was where it belonged, just not where I remember it being. Little things like that kept cropping up the rest of the day and into the morning. The umbrella we kept in the front closet wasn’t red, it was red and white striped. The folding chair we kept in the gap beside the fridge in case of guests was no longer there. When I asked my mum about it, she asked what chair I was talking about. There was no mustard in the fridge and dad put mustard on just about every type of meat we ate.

I tried to tell my parents about this and they told me I must have had a bad dream the night before that stuck with me. This wasn’t a dream. I know it wasn’t. I’ve had bad dreams before. This was too real. When I told my aunt, she gave me a little chuckle and said I must have slipped in from another universe, that somewhere out there there is a universe where I died that I must be from. I don’t know if that is a comfort or if it makes me even more uneasy with what happened.
