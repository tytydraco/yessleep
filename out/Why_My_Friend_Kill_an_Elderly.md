Hey,folks, it's me again, you can read Part 2 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16y378k/i_dont_know_where_the_evidence_points/) and Part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16y378k/i_dont_know_where_the_evidence_points/)  
  
I couldn't sleep that night after my last encounter; the horrific package from the police had left me shaken. I needed to uncover the mystery and find out what had happened to Rafael, but I wasn't too keen on risking encountering more macabre things.  
  
The next morning, I decided to do more research on the spiral symbol. I combed through old newspapers [(I found this archived material interesting, in case you understand basic Portuguese)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19LNF8w6E3BQ0oa_ytjO0iQQ6dHQ9iFum/view?usp=sharing), talked to elderly residents of São Miguel das Águas, and even searched the town's archives. It seemed like the symbol had a long and dark history in our town, dating back decades. It was associated with bizarre events, cults, organized crime, disappearances, and bank robberies. The more I dug, the more convinced I became that there was a hidden force at play in São Miguel das Águas.  
  
As the days passed, tension in the town escalated. People whispered about the symbol, and some began reporting strange occurrences. Pets went missing, eerie sounds were heard in the middle of the night, and an overall sense of unease hung over São Miguel das Águas like a dark cloud. Symbols were now graffiti'd on banks, carved into trees, on banners; some of them were from young vandals and other fools trying to make a joke, which made the police's job of finding the culprits even more challenging.  
  
My research didn't yield precise answers, so reluctantly, I decided it was time to risk revisiting Pedro's cabin. I needed to learn more about the symbol and its connection to recent events, and even if he wouldn't let me in, I figured I could extract some information from him. As I approached the secluded house amidst the trees, a sense of fear washed over me. The tall grass swayed threateningly in the wind, and the ancient trees seemed to stretch out with twisted branches as if warning me to turn back. There was no animal sound, no crickets, no birds, not even mosquitoes, which were common in the region.  
  
I pushed the creaking door once more, and this time, the darkness inside was even more oppressive. I called for Pedro, but there was no answer. My heart raced as I ventured further inside, dimly illuminated.  
  
Then, I saw it.  
  
On the wall, drawn with what appeared to be fresh blood, was the spiral symbol. It was larger and more intricate than any I had ever seen, and it seemed to pulsate with unnatural energy. My breath caught in my throat when I realized the blood was Pedro's, as his lifeless body sat on the couch, pale and with a cut mark on his neck.  
  
A shiver ran down my spine, and I knew I had to get out of there. I tried to scream, but my voice simply lodged in my throat. As I turned to leave, a voice whispered in the darkness, sending shivers down my spine.  
  
"Leaving so soon, L?"  
  
I froze, my heart pounding in my chest. The voice was familiar, but it was impossible. It couldn't be...  
  
Slowly, I turned, and there, in the shadows, stood Rafael. He was pale, his eyes empty, and his body seemed to flicker like a candle in the wind.  
  
"R-Rafael? Is that you?" I stammered.  
  
He didn't respond, but the corners of his mouth twisted into a disturbing, unnatural smile as he brought his single index finger to his lips, letting out a "shhh." He began to approach me, and I stumbled backward, my mind racing.  
  
Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind me, trapping me in the cabin with this sinister version of my friend. I tried to reach for my phone, desperate to call for help, but it had disappeared. I must have dropped it on the way here.  
  
Rafael continued to advance, his movements abrupt and unnatural. His joints moved upward, making him resemble a spider. I retreated to a corner, my heart pounding, and that's when I noticed the glass spheres on the floor. They were the same ones that had replaced the eyes of the bovine head in the gruesome package. And they bore the spiral symbol. That thing wanted to do the same to me.  
  
I tried to reason with Rafael, pleading for him to snap out of the trance he was in, but his words were disjointed and unintelligible. It was as if he was speaking in a language I couldn't understand.  
  
Just as I was about to succumb to despair, a sharp cry echoed through the cabin. It was the Murucututu, perched on the window, its yellow eyes fixed on Rafael. The bird emitted a piercing scream, and Rafael convulsed, falling to the floor.  
  
I seized the opportunity to escape, pushing the cabin door with all my strength. The daylight outside was blinding, and I stumbled into the fresh air, gasping.  
  
As I ran away from the cabin, I heard Rafael's agonizing screams behind me and the sound of the Murucututu's wings flapping. Was the bird somehow helping me? God, I hoped so.  
  
I didn't look back. I kept running, my heart pounding, until I finally reached the town. I knew I had stumbled upon something much darker than I could have ever imagined, and I had no idea how to stop it.  
  
Now, I'm posting this here, hoping that someone can help me understand what's happening to Rafael, to me, and to the rest of the town. I led the police to Pedro's cabin, and they found the body. The results of the autopsy haven't been released yet, but I believe suspicion is falling on me; I've seen them whispering and looking at me. Besides, I fear I might be the next victim of the spiral symbol.  
  
Please, if anyone has any information or advice, I beg you to share it. My sanity hangs by a thread, and I truly need to understand why my friend killed an elderly man.
