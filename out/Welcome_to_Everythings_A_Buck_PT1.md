I’ve been working at Everything’s a Buck longer than I can track. Shifts blend together, weeks melt into months, and I’m not convinced time works the same way inside these walls as it does outside.

Management doesn’t call. They don’t text. They don’t even send emails. The only “instructions” I ever get show up as notes scrawled in jagged handwriting on things that should not be notes—like inside a frozen pizza box, or stitched into a pair of sweatpants.

It’s just me here. One employee. One store. And whoever wanders through the doors.

November 3rd
First customer this morning was a guy with coupons stacked higher than the register. Some were printed on normal paper. Some on parchment. One on something that looked suspiciously like human skin. The register beeped and took seventy-five cents off a dented can of peaches. He left looking smug. I was just glad he was gone.

Around lunchtime, I heard plastic balls clattering. Walked past Aisle 4, and sure enough, a ball pit had appeared out of nowhere. Cheap inflatable walls, rainbow-colored balls, toddler sitting in the middle of it with his head wrapped in aluminum foil like a baked potato.

I blinked, looked around for the mom. By the time I turned back, the ball pit was gone. Just a damp circle on the tile where it had been.

 Right before close, a kid in a business suit walked in. Couldn’t have been older than five. Little leather briefcase, shiny shoes, dead-serious expression. He didn’t say a word. Dropped a handful of ancient coins on the counter, stared at me until I rang him up for a pack of gum, then walked back out into the parking lot.

Swear to God, his briefcase was heavier on the way out.

When I went to lock up, I found it again: a hand pushing up through the linoleum by the freezer section. Pale, veiny, nails chewed down to the quick. Didn’t move. Didn’t wave. Just… waited.

I sighed, grabbed a traffic cone from aisle seven, and set it gently over the hand. Like always.

Before I left, I saw a note taped to the inside of the front door. Sloppy handwriting, like it was scribbled in the dark:

“Inventory is coming.”

Suddenly, I wasn’t tired anymore.

November 4

The hum of the fridge sounded different, like someone breathing through a snorkel. I ignored it.

First customer was Cheryl from the vape shop. She hangs around sometimes when business is slow on her end. Bought a single lighter, flicked it on, then stared into the flame like she expected to see something. I told her she could hang out in the breakroom, but she said the walls in there “whisper too loud.” Then she left.

Second customer… was harder to ignore. A man walked in wearing a trench coat stuffed so full of writhing things I couldn’t see his arms. He shuffled to the counter, pressed his chest against the register, and I heard faint meowing from inside his coat. He leaned forward and whispered, “Do you price match?”

I said no. He left, coat still writhing.

The ball pit showed up again around 3 p.m. this time. No toddler. Just empty. I threw a broom into it to see what would happen. The broom never came back up. I left it alone.

Inventory hasn’t “arrived” yet, but something’s moving around in the ceiling tiles. Could be rats. Could be something pretending to be rats. Either way, not my problem until it falls into an aisle and starts asking for assistance.

The hand by the freezer was back, poking up from the linoleum, twitching a little. This time, instead of covering it with the traffic cone, I tried speaking to it.

“Can I help you?” I asked.

It scratched a single word into the floor with its fingernail: “Soon.”

By the time I blinked, it had retreated under the tiles again.

When I went to lock the doors, there was another note waiting, taped inside the glass. Same jagged handwriting as before.

“Make room. Inventory is large.”

I don’t know if that means more stock, more customers, or something else entirely. But I’ve got a bad feeling about tomorrow.

November 5th

I came in this morning and found someone had written “OPEN 25/8” across the front windows in what I hope was ketchup. Management hasn’t said anything about it, so I left it.

First customer was a woman dragging a shopping cart with three squeaky wheels. She filled it with nothing but off-brand shampoo, muttering, “One for every head.” When she got to the counter, I asked if she wanted a bag. She laughed, hair falling over her face in clumps, and said, “It’s already in the bag.” Then she left—cart empty.

Second customer was worse. A teenager wandered in wearing sunglasses at night, reeking of gasoline. He bought two lighters and asked if we had any “discount matches, the ones that scream.” I told him no. He frowned, hissed, and every bulb in the ceiling flickered at once. When I looked up again, he was gone, receipt still printing.

Around noon, the ball pit came back. Third day in a row. This time there were two toddlers inside, both with foil-wrapped heads. They were playing patty-cake. Every time their hands touched, the overhead lights buzzed louder. I went to grab another traffic cone to block off the aisle, but when I came back the pit was gone. The air smelled like burned plastic.

The suit kid came back. Same little briefcase, same serious walk. Put a single pinecone on the counter, stared at me until the register beeped, and left with a box of chalk. I’m not going to pretend I understand the exchange rate.

The hand showed up late tonight, closer to closing. It didn’t scratch anything this time—just gave a little wave before retreating. I waved back. Felt rude not to.

When I went to lock the doors, there was no note taped to the glass this time. For a second I thought maybe things were settling down. Then I looked down.

The note wasn’t on the door—it was slipped inside my jacket pocket.

“Inventory arrives tomorrow. Prepare.”

I’m not sure how they got it in there. I didn’t feel a thing. But after that the day pretty much wrapped up as usual waving goodbye to the hand, knocking on the wall three times to see if it knocks back, saying goodbye into the empty darkness and heading home for the day. I will update y’all with more as the days go on.
