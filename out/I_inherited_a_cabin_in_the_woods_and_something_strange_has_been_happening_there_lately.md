When my grandfather passed away in early 2020, I inherited his cabin in the forests of southern Norway. He was a carpenter by trade and built it himself in the 1960s as a weekend retreat. I spent many summers there as a child, so when my parents initially wanted to put the cabin up for sale, I insisted on keeping it. Reluctantly, they passed it on to me. 

The first strange incident I can recall happened about 3 years ago, in early 2022. The sun sets early in the winter here, so I arrived at the cabin in the afternoon, shortly after sunset. I strapped on my headlamp and started unpacking my car. Just as I had opened the boot, the wind suddenly died down. The usual rustle of leaves and distant bird calls vanished, leaving behind an emptiness that felt unnerving. 

You don’t realize how loud the forest really is until you experience a true silence. I looked around, slowly scanning the treeline with my headlamp.  

The forest became darker by the minute. Eventually, I decided to switch off my headlamp so it wouldn’t act as a beacon revealing my location. Growing up, I’d learned that when the forest falls quiet, it often indicates that a predator is nearby. 

I realized I only had two options, either remain by the car or make my way over to the cabin and quietly unlock the door.
The cabin sits in a clearing about fifty meters from the gravel patch I call a parking lot.

I eased my car’s boot shut and crept toward the driver’s side door, figuring that if something really was out there, I’d be safer inside my car. 

The sound of the door opening echoed between the trees. A moment later, the familiar background noise faded back into existence as if nothing had happened.  

I suppose it was a minor incident, yet it still lingers on my mind. It was the first time I’d experienced anything like it. Since then, I’ve read a lot of stories about this phenomenon, and it seems to be a common occurrence. However, experiencing it firsthand is unsettling in a way that sticks with you.  

The next strange incident happened just two weeks later. I woke up in the middle of the night to a loud noise outside. Peering through the blinds of my bedroom, I realized it had come from the small playhouse near the edge of the property, close to the tree line. The old structure had been repurposed as a shed for storing gardening tools. The sound had likely come from the wooden door being slammed shut, and the impact seemed to have left the door hanging halfway open.  

In retrospect, going outside to investigate wasn't exactly the brightest idea, but I got dressed, grabbed a flashlight, and stepped out into the cold night. When I reached the shed, I saw that the padlock had been unlocked and was lying on the ground. A few centimeters of snow revealed a set of footprints running parallel to the tree line before disappearing into the woods. A wave of unease washed over me as I realized I wasn’t alone.  

I hurriedly closed the door to the shed and ran back to my cabin. Before I stepped inside, I glanced toward the tree line. I felt an intense dread, the unmistakable feeling of being watched from the darkness. 

I stayed up until morning, and in the comfort of the sunlight, I went outside to investigate the footprints again. They circled the entire property along the tree line, including the path that leads down to the parking area. The prints looked bipedal, but the distance between each step was over twice that of my own. 

November 2023. I was laying in bed, listening to a podcast, when I heard what sounded like footsteps on the roof. They moved slowly from one end of the house toward my bedroom, then stopped directly above me. A stillness followed. I tried to rationalize what I’d heard. Squirrels sometimes wandered across the roof, but whatever this was sounded much heavier. The silence continued for a few more minutes, which turned into an hour and I eventually fell asleep. The next morning, I noticed deep scratch marks on the door leading up to the attic.  

In the summer of 2024, my girlfriend and I decided to stay at the cabin for the weekend. I was in the living room watching TV while she had gone to the grocery store. The kitchen is around a corner from the living room, and there is a backdoor in the kitchen that isn’t visible from where I was sitting. Suddenly, I heard her voice calling out from the kitchen, asking for help carrying in the groceries from the car. Assuming she had just returned early, I walked out the front door and headed down the path toward the parking lot. 

Halfway there, I froze. Our car was absent. I felt dizzy, wondering if I had imagined her voice. I had to choose between going back inside to investigate or making the twenty-minute walk along the gravel road through the forest to the main road. In hindsight, perhaps it was a stupid decision to go back to the cabin, but I walked back to the front door and peeked inside. I listened for a few seconds, but I couldn’t hear anything. That’s when I noticed that the forest also had fallen completely silent. 

I combed through each room, searching for any indication of an intruder, but to my relief, nothing seemed out of the ordinary except for the backdoor being unlocked. 

I still regularly visit the cabin on weekends and holidays. Even after everything I’ve experienced, I haven’t been deterred. There’s something about that place that keeps drawing me back. I suppose the one positive thing to come out of all this is that I never forget to lock my doors.
