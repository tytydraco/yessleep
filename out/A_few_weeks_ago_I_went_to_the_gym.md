I used to have mixed feelings about going to the gym. Ever since I first started, I found it difficult to contain my unease around the mindless grunting, the sweat droplets smeared on each machine, weight, and cushion- the breathy smell of exasperation erratically thrown from the lungs of each and every participant in what felt like some kind of near-silent disjointed iron-paced chant. 



The heat of my campus’s closet-sized gym was especially notable, as each station was close enough to each other that, should someone be using one adjacent to you, it would be inevitable that you felt their body heat mixing with yours in the miasma of stale air. They used a large mirror in the back to both allow people to check their form, but also, I think, to give the illusion that the room was larger than it really was. I preferred to avert my eyes from it- seeing the whole mess of people in one glance always made me a bit nauseated. It amplified how overwhelming the place was, usually. 



It wasn’t like that, one Saturday evening. Trundling my way up the stairs, I was relieved to see the gym was rather vacant. Poking my head above the banister as I made my way to the top, I noticed that it was actually completely barren, save for a few abandoned towels hung over some machines. Not even a staff member was there, which they were obligated to be for safety reasons. Attempting, and subsequently failing to scan myself in, I assumed then that the student staff took the emptiness of the gym as permission to slack off somewhere. 



That wasn’t my problem, of course. And so I began my warm-up. A simple 15 minute brisk walk on the treadmill. The sunset refracted noticeably in the thick edges of my high-prescription lenses and quickly withdrew as the sun descended below the trees. When I stepped off and began my bench presses, I saw the overhead fluorescent lights, one flickering, as if indecisive about whether it wanted to be alive or not. Relatable. It purred just softly enough to make the silence of the gym feel loud. 



Over an hour later, the sky heralded the rising moon, and spiders on the other side of the windows set up their lively camps for the night watch. Still, no other humans had come to disturb us. As I pushed against gravity for my last tricep curl, I felt the muscles and sinew in my upper arms glide against each other, a soft pop brought fourth as an air bubble between bone and bone had found it’s escape route in the motion, and I realized how blissful it was to be able to hear something so minute. Solitude brings about the perfect conditions for a state of flow. 



But despite how much I savored it, it felt odd. Forbidden, is perhaps a better word. Ever since beginning college, being given some simple space away from others has seemed like an expensive luxury. Dorms that pack students together like sardines in a tin, cramped public transport, lectures occasionally disrupted by a bumped kneecap, even in the bathrooms there’s often an irritating bustle. 



Don’t get me wrong. My irritation with others being everywhere I go isn’t personal, usually. And in fact, even when it is, I find myself prone towards a patience that obfuscates my frustration well enough. After all, I find that, when people truly do irritate me with their audacity, their judgmental thoughts, or their refusal to think of things with the appropriate scope of complexity, explaining my scruples and allowing my annoyance to show does nothing to absolve the lack of consideration they can muster. The lack of empathy. And then, hanging on that thought, my inner sense of camaraderie began to chatter and guide me. 



I wondered, with some amount of horror, if the gym truly had been vacated in haste. What if there was an accident? Rarely does the world echo it’s happenings in the absence of the voices of others. 



Perhaps, shortly before my arrival, someone had decided to experiment with more weight than usual, biting off more than they could chew, and had masticated their bones in the jaws of one of the benches, and the student staff member had rushed onto an ambulance with them, neglecting to lock the door in the whirlwind of events, and this quiescence was therefore produced? Walking to each nook and cranny of the gym, I half expected, half earnestly hoped, that I would find a staff room with a dozed-off slacker inside. But I found no such thing. 



Unable to assuage myself, my legs carried me to the leg press for my final exercise. I plucked the abandoned towel from the machine, observing nothing notable about it, and laid down my own, nestling into the seat. I heaved the seat backwards with my thigh muscles engaged as a cricket outside cheered me on, and I thought, still somewhat pleased, that whatever had happened, it would likely turn out alright, if anything had really happened at all. 



When I had finished, I stuffed my towel into my bag and took a final gulp of water, throwing in the empty bottle too, and automatically raised my arms to release my hair from the over-sized hair forks which so loyally held my calf-length locks for me. It was then that I finally looked into the large mirror on the back wall.



Throughout the whole two hours that had passed, it seems that, out of habit, I had not once looked into the mirror. I counted 9 people in the gym then, not including the staff person who was sitting at the computer by the entrance, staring into his phone as he bit into a barely-ripe banana. I also didn’t include myself, because, well- I wasn’t there. My body didn’t show up in the mirror at all. I wondered if, perhaps, all this time, I’d been mistaken, that it was not a mirror, but a window, a window leading to some extra room of the gym I had overlooked just as easily but- but no. 



The machines were the same as the room I stood in. The layout. Even the towels had been perfectly reflected with exception of the one I’d moved from my side, which still was draped over the leg press machine on one side of the mirror, yet lay crumpled on the overhead press directly to my right. 



I stood for more than a few minutes that night, staring at the whole oddity, trying to discern how the apparent prank was constructed. Of course, I realized already that it was no prank. Nobody did ever show up in the version of the gym I was standing in. I figured, perhaps, I would ask my doctor to check if I had wound up inheriting my father’s schizo-affective disorder at a statistically unusual stage of development. My knees buckling between exertion and anxiety, I stumbled down the staircase and began my route home with my heart thrumming to the tune of a stifled panic. 



In this state, altered by fear, I found myself having made a wrong turn, and decided to consult Google maps fairly shortly into the journey to my dorm. As I opened my phone to the home screen, between one step and the next, the clock display suddenly jumped backwards from 9:43pm to 7:21pm right in front of my eyes, which noticed a sudden light on my peripheries. 



The sun was again in the sky, soon to set, but my muscles still surely remembered the past two hours of work they had done. 



It’s been over a month since that night. I figured out that, no matter when I go, once I make it exactly 0.37km away from any of the gyms exits, time goes back to whatever time it was when I entered that same radius from whichever entrance I choose. I’ve learned to ignore the people who give me odd looks when I bring my tape measure. 



I thought, at first, I should maybe run screaming to anyone who might listen that I’ve found some kind of spacial-temporal tear somehow centered around my local campus gym. That I should write about each experiment I’ve done to determine the effects it produces, collect video evidence, try to bring someone along with me, point out  how, based on all my observations, people on the street who enter this 1/e +/- 0.08km  (depending on entrance/exit chosen as origin) radius about the gymnasium who don’t intend to enter the building disappear at that radius for just 1 frame in the professional high-speed camera I bought, immediately reappearing and continuing onwards and yet, those who apparently intend to go inside disappear, and then, a few minutes later, nonetheless appear inside and start working out only on the other side of the mirror, and so on. 



But, then, I realized that even if I did, I know how people would react. I know how they are. I know that they can’t see it, this thing that makes no sense, this rift, just like they miss so many other little things. 



So I’ve accepted it as a gift. A gift from the universe, for me and the nearby creatures who seem to accept it as simply as I do now. It’s my refuge away from the nonsense and noise that everyone else produces. I go to the gym almost every night now- sometimes I even sleep there. I even have a pet cat living there now, a fluffy gray tomcat I’ve named Sir Waffleton who I always tell to stand back when I do squats with the barbell, lest he become Sir Pancake. 



Honestly, it’s been years since I felt so much peace and fulfillment. But today, something has happened that made me again feel a bit guilty for having this space. 



You see, about an hour ago now, I watched an older man in the mirror have a heart attack on the stationary bike. He fell off, smacking his head hard into the corner of the nearby treadmill, a pool of blood quickly forming around the undeniable crack in his skull as other gym-goers around him began to panic. He entered a little under an hour than I did, and maybe I could have prevented this, but I figured there was no way to do it and actually be listened to. I mulled over it for the whole day before I left. I heard the sirens pass by as I wrote this, and, while I can’t say it to anyone else, I really am sorry.
