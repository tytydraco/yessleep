I know you guys don’t allow dreams on here. If you did this place would probably be full of every fever dream or childhood nightmare that ever happened, but what’s happening to me is different. My dream came true. I never told my husband Patrick about it; I’ve never told anyone about it. It was just a dream.

Let me start over, for as long as I can remember I’ve had a recurring nightmare. It’s the same every time, and every time I wake up terrified. It’s very simple but I will try to be as descriptive as possible so that you can understand why I am so freaked out. I will be in my basement with a sauna in the corner that I now recognize to be the worst place imaginable. The sauna is an addition, made of wood and tucked in the corner of the room. The door to the sauna has a small glass window, nothing large enough to fit through, and the face of a snarling bull burned into the wood. The inside of the sauna is very standard, containing only a small iron stove and two benches on either side of the cramped room.

In the nightmare, I will enter the sauna. I’ve tried to avoid this on multiple occasions, but I enter the sauna every time. Then I cook. The door becomes jammed in some way, and I have no chance to escape. No matter what I do, the stove keeps providing heat and the room gets hotter and hotter. I sizzle and cook in the sauna, desperately trying to open the door or stop the heat. It is so painful. You would think that a dream couldn’t hurt that much. That due to the fact I’ve never experienced being cooked alive my brain couldn’t come up with that sensation. But I cook and burn and sizzle and scald until my skin bubbles and my eyes melt. Then I wake up.

It's an awful dream and it has never gotten better even now. The last time I had the dream before this all started, I woke up screaming and ran to the shower to cool down like usual. The pain usually lingers for a little bit. It’s psychological is my best guess. Patrick always comforts me after even though I’ve never told him about the nightmare. It’s personal, y’know? Just a dream that I had to experience every once in a while.

And I could deal with this, it was just a dream after all. Then Patrick started a new home improvement project. He’d been on a DIY kick for the past couple of years, so it didn’t strike me as much of a surprise, he’d even redone our entire kitchen which I very much appreciated. So, when he told me he was going to start building a sauna, it unsettled me, but I didn’t think anything weird was happening.

Of course, I told him that I didn’t want a sauna, but he was very persistent. We actually got into an argument about it. So, I caved and let him start his little passion project. I just wouldn’t use the sauna after he built it. Plus, it’s not like I avoided every sauna, I’d gone near the one at the public rec center all the time. As long as it wasn’t the sauna in my nightmares, I would be fine.

That was the plan at least. Patrick had been studying the engineering behind constructing a sauna for the past couple weeks, so it had mostly slipped my mind. When he told me where he planned on building the sauna though, I started to be concerned. It was in the exact spot where that hot coffin sat in my nightmares. I tried to talk Patrick out of it, that he could build the sauna anywhere else in the house. But apparently, the sauna had to be there. Something about ventilation and fire hazards. 

Again, I trusted my husband. I mean there’s no way it could be anything malicious, I had never told Patrick about my dreams. I just wouldn’t go near the damn thing and that would be fine. But he kept working on the sauna and my nightmares became more and more frequent. I felt the fat in my body liquefy as the boiling heat fried my skin. Do you have any idea what that feels like? To breathe in and feel hot stinking air that hardly provides any relief. That smell of your own skin dripping off as if I am a lit candle and my body is burning wax.

Patrick’s project had been getting closer and closer to completion when I finally knew that something was wrong. When he told me that he had gotten the door burned to have the face of a bull, I had a panic attack. It was the same face that I saw in all my nightmares, baring its teeth and expelling hot suffocating air out of its nostrils.

I screamed at Patrick to demolish the entire thing, to burn it before it could burn me. We got into another big argument and Patrick went to stay with his parents for some time to cool down. Then it was just me and the sauna, alone in the house. I stayed away from the thing, of course, I stayed away from the thing. That was until I went to sleep though.

I had gone to sleep in my bed and had been woken up by the nightmare again, but this time I awoke in a very different spot. I was standing upright in my bedroom hall, sleepwalking. I quickly ran to the bathroom to cool the burning sensations in my shower, but I found it concerning that I had woken up outside my bed. The only thing close to a sleep disorder that I ever had were the recurring nightmares. The second time it happened, and I found myself halfway down my basement staircase, I knew my fate was coming to an end.

I tried locking my bedroom door, handcuffing myself to the bed, and even not sleeping at all. Every time though, I would find myself closer to the sauna in my basement when I slipped unconscious. I recorded myself to see what was happening. Every time I would have the dream, you could see me writhing in pain and screaming, and then suddenly, I calmly get out of bed and start walking towards my basement.

I haven’t gone downstairs to try and destroy the sauna, I don’t even want to get close to the thing. I’m afraid that if I get close to it then I will go inside, and my dreams will come true. I’ll finally truly experience what it’s like to melt and boil. I don’t know what to do, I have nowhere else to go and I can’t stay awake forever. Every night I go to sleep, I have the dream and I am a little bit closer to the sauna. Patrick has stopped answering my calls and my friends don’t believe me anymore. I just don’t want to burn but I think I don’t have a choice.

Last night I woke up after feeling my bones turn into liquid and my hand was on the door handle. I was seconds away from going into the sauna and starting the stove. I’m terrified that the next time I go to sleep, I’ll find myself in that cramped wooden room. And I have a feeling the door won’t open when I try to rush to cool myself down. It’s funny, they say a dream lasts around 15 minutes, but I am scared that it will take much longer than that for me when it finally happens. That’ll I’ll feel every bit of myself burn and melt and scorch until my brain boils like a strew on the [stove](https://www.reddit.com/r/CursesAndBoons/comments/180iwt6/welcome_to_cursesandboons/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
