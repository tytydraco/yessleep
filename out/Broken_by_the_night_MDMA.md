On January 12th, 2024, my happy, healthy, successful 43-year-old life was irreversibly turned upside-down by one Friday night.

This is the journey I never could have imagined in my wildest dreams. And a cautionary tale about party drugs I had no clue was even a risk.

Some will see this as a timely case study at the intersection of medicine, pharma, policy, and brain science. Others, a harrowing dive into extremes of the human mind. 

As the one who lived it, I’m writing my story as therapy — assembling, ten months later, the shards of a shattered life, mind, and heart in one place. 

Here goes…

At my brother’s 50th birthday in Cabo, Mexico, along with other party guests, I was offered cocaine as part of the festivities. By no means a user, I’m also not a novice. I consider my profile that of a normal millennial in that I’ve never looked for anything, but am also open-minded and not afraid to try something passed by friends.

For context, I’m a responsible and educated guy with a bunch of advanced degrees. I manage a small but thriving international company. This background is not a brag, just to establish that until January I lived a drama-free life, successful by any metric. I’m also by nature an understated middle child, so making noise or having weird stuff happen to me is not my thing. Until that night, I’d found a way to coast through life under the radar, without anything big ever going wrong.

Being in my early 40s, my partying days have been over for a while, and January was probably my first time in a decade — since business school — touching party drugs of any kind.

Over several hours at a restaurant called Bagatelle, where the first dinner of the three-day birthday bash took place, I had a dozen+ lines/bumps of coke while sipping champagne. It was a festive if over-the-top scene. Our group of 40 danced atop the long birthday table, stepping over dinner plates, as magnums of champagne carried between waiters were poured into mouths like parishioners taking communion. Not your typical Friday night, but all were having fun celebrating my bro. So chemically speaking, cocaine and alcohol were the first ingredients in my blood.

As midnight approached, I was handed by a banker friend of my brother’s what I was told was MDMA brought from San Francisco. I’d taken molly twice before in my life — once at a wedding in Prague, and before that at a club in Aruba — and had good experiences both times. I didn’t particularly want to take it that night in Mexico, being late and feeling tired from flying out of DC at the crack of dawn… so I nearly said, “no thanks.”

But your brother only turns a half-century once, and I didn’t overthink it. I split the cap in half with my fingers, swallowed what I figured would be a light dose, and kept on with the party.

Biggest mistake of my life. Across all years. The one that changed everything… Even Dostoyevsky couldn’t have imagined what lay ahead.

When added to the cocaine and alcohol in my system, MDMA instantly had a negative effect. In my two previous experiences, I hadn’t mixed it with any other drug. But this time was different. I felt an overwhelming anxiety never before known in my life.

An hour into that state, I had to leave the afterparty. I was consumed by unease and couldn’t continue to talk with people. When I got back to my room at Esperanza, I wasn’t able to sleep. This was no surprise since cocaine makes the process of settling down belabored, so I lay awake, passing out after sunrise.

When I awoke that afternoon, the panic and anxiety hadn’t gone. I stayed in my room, skipping day two of the birthday bash, waiting for the malaise to abide. I’d never had a mood disorder or taken a psych med, so experiencing such long-lasting unease was an entirely new sensation to me.

A third day came and went cooped up. My phone filled with videos from the birthday as I skipped the close of the 72-hour celebration.

And that’s when the real problem started…

On the third night, when I tried to sleep, no sleep came. 

None. 

Day four, Jan 16, I flew to Mexico City for routine work meetings and events. The same pattern continued that night — and the one after — no sleep.

By the end of the sixth sleepless night, having barely scraped through what would have otherwise been stress-free work obligations in CDMX, I flew home to DC, assuming all would return to normal in my own bed.

Nothing changed back home.

A seventh sleepless night became an eighth with an hour or two of broken rest, always springing wide awake with churning anxiety. It was as if my brain had gotten stuck in “fight or flight” mode, with no off-switch.

Now, in my prior life, a restless night — say, from a red-eye flight, before a big speech, or a tough board meeting — would lead to sheer exhaustion and crashing hard the next evening, catching up from the lack of rest. But “catch-up sleep” never came with this bizarre MDMA insomnia. I simply did not get sleepy, no matter how many sleepless nights passed.

After two weeks, I knew in my gut something big was wrong. After consulting my family doctor, I was referred to a psychiatrist for the first time, who began to treat me with introductory sleeping pills, starting with trazodone. These didn’t put a dent in the insomnia, and I was rotated to stronger categories of prescription.

This process repeated for the next month as I worked with a growing team of doctors, psychiatrists, and sleep neurologists who wrote scripts for sequentially more heavily controlled meds. These trials included every sedative Rx under the sun. I won’t re-list them by name, suffice to say that I left no stone unturned. Just the “categories” of sleep-inducing prescriptions I cycled through, searching with doctors for one that worked, included orexin inhibitors, adrenergic receptor agonists, benzodiazepines, z-drugs, melatonin modulators, mood stabalizers, gabapentinoids, conventional antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, atypical antidepressants, and, eventually, anesthetics — a la Michael Jackson. I had every possible bloodwork panel done, a sleep study (sleeping 50 minutes across the night), an MRI, EEG, hired a CBT coach, etc… none of this helped or provided doctors any insight into what had happened in my brain.

By the three-month mark, I’d trialed 40+ on-label and off-label prescription drugs. Here let me explain how so-called “psych meds” work. When prescribed “on-label” to treat mood disorders like depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc., these drugs take weeks, if not months, to work. But when prescribed “off-label” for the sole purpose of promoting sleep, these same drugs either work or don’t on the first night, providing diminishing returns thereafter as sedation tolerance builds. That’s how I was able, under doctor supervision, to trial every sleep-inducing Rx in existence over 90 days, searching for an illusive solution.

The newest “designer” sleep drugs, like the DORAs, had to be specially ordered by the pharmacy. I was becoming so desperate as weeks past that for one called Quviviq (which had helped Matthew Perry), and insurance wouldn’t cover, I shelled out $1k for a month's supply not knowing if it would work…. it didn’t.

Against these sleepless nights, I tried to wear down my brain by spending every day lifting in the gym and running miles outside. My goal became to tire myself to sleep, and I was like a warrior fighting this battle. I got into the best shape of my life as a side-effect. People’s passing compliments couldn’t imagine the dark source of my physical transformation. Still, nothing changed at night.

Piece by piece, I removed as many potential triggers from my world as I could think of in the hope that putting one of these on the back burner might somehow help me recover. So, fighting my heart in a tug of war that insomnia eventually won, I pushed all intensity and passion from my personal life into the background — shutting out love in a way that has haunted me since.

At work, I’d been doing what I could to keep on top of running a company, masking my increasingly exhausted appearance and debilitated mental state — reminiscent of [Edward Norton’s workplace struggle with insomnia](https://youtu.be/8pDY_9u5Sn0?feature=shared) in Fight Club. Anyone who saw me in those days will know that the giveaway of this scene being fiction is Norton’s eyes aren’t nearly sunken enough, as mine had become.

On days when I simply couldn’t function, I couched my absence as “migraines” among colleagues and friends — too embarrassed to say I wasn’t sleeping, something that comes naturally to everyone, including me for the 42 years prior. On top of this embarrassment, I was also ashamed by the source of my plight — a frivolous party drug, an admission I couldn’t broadcast beyond doctors. So I gutted it out in silence.

Eventually, the mental and physical toll became unsustainable, and I had to start an indefinite leave of absence from the job I loved. I cut out all travel and personal commitments — canceling trips, reassigning roles, and appointing surrogates. Still, nothing I did to streamline my life changed the sleeplessness. I never yawned. Never got tired. And all I could ever manage was an hour or two of heavily medicated sleep — holding out hope with each passing week that a new prescription cocktail might finally bring restorative rest.

Across three months, I’d invested tens of thousands of dollars seeing all top experts in a 4-hour radius of DC, most of whom don’t take insurance. Yet I was no closer to a solution, let alone a basic understanding of what medically I was facing. I even went to hospital ERs, begging to be put into a medically-induced coma for one night of rest. But not being suicidal, I could never get past triage. I reduced my daily routine to the calmest activities, a strict sushi diet, textbook sleep hygiene, and so on. But no matter what I did to LuLuLemonify my life, I couldn’t sleep. It was a hell you can’t imagine, without relief — not one night.

By mid-April, month four, encouraged by my doctors and the few closest people I’d let into my struggle, I took the next step and checked myself into the first of a series of private hospital residencies to treat this mysterious condition with 24-hour care. To put this in perspective, during my past two decades at work, I might have taken one sick day every 3 years. So flying to a clinic, let alone taking weeks off work, was completely out of character to say the least.

In late April, through the first weeks of May, I travelled to Texas and checked into one of the top behavioral health facilities in the country. It’s the kind of private hospital oasis set among manicured gardens and quiet walking paths that takes away your phone on arrival, so nothing can distract getting well. While there, I was placed on a different kind of medication — an SSRI — with no obvious relationship to sleep. It was instead prescribed to treat the increasing anxiety surrounding me in this saga as I shut my life down. Lexapro, a serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, works on the neurotransmitter 5-HT — just like MDMA.

Miraculously, and unexpectedly for doctors, Lexapro put me to sleep. For two weeks, my life was back to normal as I overcame the curse. I flew home filled with gratitude, energized to restart where I’d left off with more passion and appreciation than ever. I jumped into work and rebuilt the personal connections I’d so missed. After what I’d been through, I felt my life had been handed back to me in a way that’s impossible to describe unless you lose it for a while. I was beaming. While it baffled doctors that Lexapro put me to sleep, no one second-guessed the positive results. After all, Lexapro targets the same protein as MDMA, Serotonin (5-HT) — a signal fire as to what had gone wrong in the first place that January night.

I felt like I’d at last beaten by far the scariest thing I’d ever faced, and for two weeks, Lexapro was my lifeline. But then, in a cruel twist of fate still hard to look back on now, as I adjusted to its SSRI effects, insomnia came right back. I stuck with Lexapro in the hope this was a transient side-effect, but by week seven of the trial, my sleeplessness was worse than ever. I tried other serotonin modulators like Trintellix, but nothing put me back to sleep. The honeymoon of Lexapro became a bittersweet memory of rest and happiness that disappeared as unexpectedly as it had arrived.

A few weeks later, in June, I was finally able to see the chief sleep neurologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Christopher Earley, who I’d been trying to get in with for months but is booked a year in advance as the national authority on sleep science and the brain. A family friend on the Hopkins board helped get me up the list.

On hearing my story, after examining the details of my chart, and consulting with his colleague at Hopkins, neurologist [George Ricaurte](https://karger.com/nps/article-abstract/42/1/5/232593/3-4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine-Ecstasy-Induced?redirectedFrom=fulltext) — a well-known researcher on methamphetamine and MDMA neurotoxicity since the 90s — Dr. Earley told me what I’d taken that night in Mexico caused a “one in a million” reaction in my brain. When combined with the volatile punch of dopamine from all the cocaine, MDMA caused a “Serotonin Syndrome” that down-regulated my 5-HT receptors and transmitters through a rare but devastating neurotoxic reaction. Serotonin controls sleep in a way that requires a delicate balance to get right. When damaged by chemical forces, it can throw everything out of whack. This is why a few days of insomnia, anxiety, and malaise after molly is common — just not usually long-lasting, much less, permanent. For most people, damaged 5-HT proteins restore quickly; but in rare cases, lasting, even irreversible neural damage can occur. Dr. Earley told me I wasn’t the first he’d seen and referred to cases in the medical literature about a range of neurological disorders from even one-time MDMA use.

With candor I appreciated, Dr. Earley couldn’t say if my brain would ever recover, why Lexapro stopped working, or if anything would ever help me sleep again. Seeing the exhaustion in my eyes, Dr. Earley agreed to treat my case on “an experimental basis,” and ordered a weeklong sleep study for more data. Becoming an experimental patient to one of America’s most seasoned neurologists was both affirming, given the extremes I’d been through in my search for a cure, but also terrifying, for what it signaled about the road ahead.

June gave way to July and the 6-month anniversary of my insomnia was fast approaching. As this dreary milestone neared, I became increasingly isolated and was fast losing hope. I hadn’t worked in months, had retreated from friends and family, and lost precious parts of my private life that meant the world to me. More than $200,000 had been spent going to the world’s top medical clinics — ending up at The Retreat, a full-service boutique facility outside of Baltimore that runs $50k per each 20 days and accepts no insurance. No price was too high, investing whatever it took to get me better, knowing not just sleep but increasingly my entire future was on the line. But even after seeking out the best of the best, no one could stop the insomnia, tell me how long this hell would last, or if it would ever go away.

We’d also run out of medications to trial, the last on the list being the narcoleptic anesthetic Xyrem (aka GHB, the infamous date-rape drug from [Diddy’s parties](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/sean-diddy-combs-baby-oil-was-allegedly-laced-with-date-rape-drug/4002710/?amp=1)) — a Schedule I narcotic prescribed by Dr. Earley for me “off-label” as an extreme last resort. As one the most controlled substances in America (only one central pharmacy is authorized to dispense it), Xyrem was taking forever to get approved, required passing through a bunch of safety hoops, and costs  $25,000 per month. Receiving it was weeks or more away with no indication Xyrem would work where all others failed.

Sleep deprivation is a form of torture considered among the worst. It makes you go crazy and not think straight. We’ve all experienced at one point in our lives the relentless feeling that comes after just a single sleepless night. In as little as four days, sleep deprivation breaks prisoners of war into giving up classified secrets. So by the time July rolled around and my insomnia hit the 6-month mark, the once unfathomable thought of cutting my life short slowly started to creep into my mind as the last-resort for rest. My insomnia had literally become a death bed. 

Compounding this was a Catch-22. It’s paradoxical, but the most effective sleep drugs prescribed by doctors for life-saving rest also come with “black box” warnings in their fine print about triggering severe depression and suicidality. So my hopelessness about not sleeping was being chemically amped up by the very same medications I’d been prescribed in the hope of sleep. I was trapped in a “damned if you do,” “damned if you don’t” loop with no way out between crippling depression from not sleeping, or crippling depression from sleeping pills.

This snowballing downward spiral is how — coming from a guy who’d in December 2023 been the happiest in my entire life, with a thriving company I was expanding, beloved waterfront in Canada and on the Chesapeake I’d spent years developing to enjoy forever, a top-floor place in the city, financial freedom, supportive mentors and colleagues surrounding me, a dream job that took me to all corners of the earth, love in my heart, in short, everything I ever wanted and more — by the time July 2024 came around, the person I’d become was not recognizable as the same me. It was two different lives. Because I couldn’t sleep… I couldn’t think, I couldn’t engage, I couldn’t feel pleasure. I was a walking zombie who hadn’t rested since January. It was pure hell – far worse than anything I could have ever imagined would happen to anyone I knew, least of all, to me.

So for an eternal optimist who’d never felt down for any stretch, much less considered the idea of cutting my life short, even in my wildest nightmares, even as something I’d understand in other people who were suffering, never able to grasp what could bring someone to that state… by July, suicidal ideation had become my everyday struggle.

It’s sometimes said that self-harm is selfish. I thought that way too. But through the unending attrition of my hell, what eventually felt most selfish was continuing to drag everyone in my life through it with me. A clean break would free us all from the black hole.

Let me be clear on something. Mental weakness played no role in what follows. Those who’ve known me know I’m virtually unbreakable. No one builds the life I did without limitless resolve, nor could they survive the parts of this story still to come without iron will.

But the laws of nature are fact. Absolutely no one — no matter how resilient, no matter how brave — can fight biology forever and win. Sleep exists for a reason. We cannot be without it. There is simply no alternative.

After spending the sleepless night of July 4th watching fireworks on the Baltimore skyline from my room at The Retreat — remembering my old life watching fireworks the year before on the Tred Avon River among friends and family, now a distant memory of a past life when all was still well — two mornings later I finally gave up my last hope of ever getting better. Hope was replaced by the sinking feeling of a kamikaze pilot called for his last mission, summoned for one final test of courage. The universe had left me only a remaining way to end the endless insomnia, and give myself the rest I’d been desperately seeking for so long…

Pushing back tears, I scribbled a short goodbye note, remembered one last time the life and people I’d been in love with before this all started, cursed God for cursing me… and tried to kill myself.

I’d always flown under the radar in life, never seeking attention. So doing the unthinkable wasn’t a masked plea for help, as can sometimes be the case with those who choose pills or cuts, and rarely succeed by design. That wasn’t me for a minute. I’m a quick study and my method represented a decision. I made a strong noose and secured it at such a height that nothing could allow me to turn back once the process began, knowing there would be — I had no idea how long — intense pain before blacking out. I told myself it couldn’t feel worse than what I’d already endured. So I bit my lip, prepared for that moment, and the eternal unknown to follow.

Against every probable outcome, I partially failed, or partially succeeded — depending on the measuring stick. You could call it the first piece of good luck I’d had in six months, coming at a crucial time.

On the other hand, what I did forever changed my relationship to the life I once had and always wanted, to the people around me, and all that follows. I’m still here, but not in a way that feels like me — with brain trauma far beyond chemicals that can’t be fixed by medicine, no matter how far I search for a cure this time around. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

People asked, how I survived. It’s a horrific second act.

Since my original intent was to share a drug advisory, and not explore psychological torture, I hadn’t planned to delve into the next chapter of my saga since July. But since it’s part of the ripple effect from that January night, and although it includes some shameful details, I’ve been astounded by the stories of others as I’ve navigated all this uncharted territory. 

So here’s the rest of my tale….

At the end of my third week in The Retreat outside of Baltimore, in early July, with the best doctors in the country no closer to helping me than any had been at the start of my journey six months before, I gave up all hope of getting better.

Despite sharing with my therapists a growing belief that the end was drawing near, and petrified family members calling doctors to warn of the despair in my voice and what they feared was coming next — naively, the nurses had loaned me a 14-foot charger cable.

In some nearby woods, out of view, I fastened the cable to a sturdy branch on an overturned log above a stream, doubled it twice around my neck, and slid my body off the edge. I’ve always been drawn to water, and dying in suspension above a trickling creek felt like the most peaceful place on campus I could think of to say goodbye to the world. I passed out almost instantly as the noose caught and cinched tight. Sometime later — no one knows how long — one of the cords snapped, then the other, and I fell.

Two sudden bursts of orange flooded my head in flashes of the most intense pain I’ve ever known as consciousness returned. My eyes popped open, and I jolted back to life, like something from a movie. But the right side of my body was entirely numb, I had twitching fingers, double vision, pulsating pupils, uncontrollable shivering, and other weird thermodynamic effects from starving my brain of oxygen long enough to shut it down. This was all later diagnosed as an anoxic brain injury to my left hemisphere.

When alert enough to rise, I stumbled back to The Retreat and turned myself in. I was escorted to the emergency room at Geater Baltimore Medical Center in a delirium, coping with the terrifying effects of the brain injury I’d just suffered, compounded by the insomnia that broke me down in the first place. Nothing, it seemed, not even hanging, would let me escape. I felt trapped in an episode of Black Mirror or The Twilight Zone.

Then, in a twist of dark humor from the universe (that even mad Dr. Earley laugh when he later heard), I became sleepy in the hospital for the first time in 6 months. Somehow, shutting down my brain reset it in a way that brought back intense fatigue — which none of 40+ medications had been able to do. So I dozed in and out of consciousness for three days, as MRIs, echocardiograms, and other tests were done to see if I’d had a stroke or a heart attack.

In spite of the self-inflicted asphyxiation that had brought me in, I was being kept on the hospital’s stroke floor with minimal security — rather than its protective psych floor. It may have been my well-groomed appearance and cultured manner that deceived doctors into not seeing the risk, ignoring the heinous fact of what had just occurred. And so that’s how, shortly before I was scheduled to be transferred to a trauma unit next door, on the afternoon of July 9, still in an anoxic delirium, I broke free from the sitter assigned to watch me when distracted, and bolted to the 6th-floor exit down the hall from my room. Without pause, I dove head-first down the stairwell center — figuring a six-story fall would surely end the suffering once and for all.

But security chased and reached for my foot as I went over the ledge, catching it for a split second — just long enough before I slipped through their hands that I flipped as I free-fell down the stairwell center. Because of these mid-air somersaults I collided with and bounced off railings, which zig-zagged my free-fall obliquely enough that I ended up hitting on a landing 3 floors below, instead of traveling all 6 stories. 

Moments after impact, screams from above sounded the alarm sounded, and doctors from every floor rushed to the stairwell, peering down in disbelief. Through my motionless glazed eyes — against every odd — I had a pulse, still. 

Somehow, even going three floors headfirst didn’t kill me, as it did fellow musical soul Liam Payne recently in Argentina. But when the back of my head hit concrete, it deviated my eyes in a way that now makes 3D vision hard (called strabismus), and gave me a condition known as “Acquired Aphantasia,” which means losing your mind’s eye. So when I close my eyes now, I can’t see anything, can’t picture what people look like, can’t recall visual scenes from my past, can’t envision the future, can’t lock onto my eyes in the mirror, am not able to absorb written words without saying them, can’t navigate without GPS, and a myriad of ways that losing your imagination reshapes you. It feels like losing the visual part of your mind. I was told my whole life I’m a “visual person,” so losing this half feels like losing my essence.

In more dark humor from fate, this neurological aboration is also exceedingly rare, just like the MDMA insomnia before it. Acquired r/Aphantasia is uncommon with head trauma because rear-occipital and parietal-lobe damage happens far less frequently than frontal, as with sports collisions and head-on MVAs (car crashes). So I’m navigating this new chapter, literally, in the dark. Flying blind. No one knows for how long. Likely forever. 

After my fall, the scent of liability attracted hospital attorneys like sharks to blood, who to protect themselves, threw the book at me. I was strapped to a gurney, sent to a ward, and locked away for 40 days. Much of that time was spent on “1:1,” which is like solitary confinement, but with a guard standing at arm's length, 24/7, even in the shower, even in bed. 

Still in a trance from my head colliding with cement, I thought about Moses in the desert. I began to talk to my guard — this alter ego beside me — like the Voice in the Burning Bush. Her name was Sam.

When strong enough to walk, I walked in circles. Endlessly. Sam's voice beside me brought periodic news of the outside, beyond the walls… an assassin shot Trump at a rally, but the bullet grazed his ear… a giant bridge across the Chesapeake collapsed nearby, cars dropping into the water as stones into a pond. My world — inside and out — had become magical realism, like a Hundred Years of Solitude. Fiction had turned into fact in this Borgesian labyrinth. My life had gone from not sleeping to an unending dream.

Given my apparent penchant for transforming medical settings into deathtraps, ward leadership was terrified of a lawsuit. So that meant all eyes on me, day and night, a never-ending watch. My life was paper scrubs, paper spoons, rubber mattress, plastic pillow, no sheets, metal toilet, no lid, Stockholm shower, no curtain. Strip searches at sunup and sundown. The pattern repeated, day after day after day. I’d become their Al Capone… Hannibal Lecter, without the Goldberg Variations to keep me company… the Kurt Cobain of insomnia. But none of this overzealous posturing mattered. The moment to protect me had come and gone before I arrived.

I did my time, and six weeks later was eventually released in mid-August. Since then, I’ve survived by planting and cutting trees on some acreage I own, and long adventures with my dog [Peanut](https://www.instagram.com/theotterholt/) — trying to keep at bay depression’s downward force of gravity on a level I never knew existed in this world. Worn out by what’s become ten months with no rest, now navigating unsettling deficits of a new brain trauma — I keep thinking back to my old life before this story started, and the dreams I left behind along the way as my world caved in. I can’t understand why any of it happened, and on top of it all, I’m not able to sleep much, still...

Most recently, I’ve spent September, October, and November fighting poison with poison — doing every brain-reset protocol known to man, including five weeks of Ketamine, seven weeks of [TMS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32830052/), four [Stellate Ganglion Block](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10029323/) injections (used by the military), and soon, triweekly ElectroConvulsive shock under general anesthesia. But none of it touches me. My mind’s gone blank. My heartlight’s out. There are no stars in the sky.

When you add it all up, what I’ve lived since January is so unbelievable it couldn’t be fiction — only real life. And now the sleepless nights that started it all are the prelude of a stranger chapter I’m still waking up to.

I’ve never been a fan of melodrama, but I can’t help the inescapable feeling of missing life’s chance — derailing onto the wrong track from one night out, my train now headed in another direction. After being the driver my whole life, I’ve become its passenger, seeing where each day goes. I don’t know how this new ride in my new brain shapes up. Fortunately, I can still write, but I’ve lost the ability to be succinct (as you may have gathered) from Aphantasia. I now have to say everything in my internal monologue, I can’t just look at words to know them. I need to hear them. It’s all the sea change.

The harder they come, the harder they fall. The happy, go-lucky me of December 2023 now appears as a character from a distant movie I miss. Every moment radiates out of the past. Through the fog of time between then and now, it’s m a miracle and a curse that I made it. January 12 will always mark in some way the last day of my life.

My story from one night may rank among the most adverse, life-changing MDMA reactions of all time. I know I’m the exception to the rule, not the rule.

But I also know I’m not alone. I’m not the only one.

This platform is full of testimonies from terrified people experiencing lasting insomnia after even a single use. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/s/l88p1xECmC) is one among many, here’s [another](https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/s/R77cNigJ0y), all variations on the same theme. Most get shot down by a mob who’ve only had positive experiences and doubt that the same drug could do so much damage to someone else. You can’t truly understand until it happens to you. I never thought it would be me, and have since discovered so many lives broken by Molly’s dark side.

If you look up medical cases in NIH literature, you will find things like permanent [anxiety disorders](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5968564/) and intractable [psychosis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3304680/) brought on by even single-dose MDMA in people with no prior mental health history, as it was with me.

If you dig through user blogs for what is known as the “long-term comedown” (LTC) phenomenon, there are troves of heartbreaking accounts all around the world of MDMA creating neurological and physiological consequences lasting months, years, sometimes forever.

Without a doubt my story is rare… as Dr. Earley said, a “1 in a million” neurotoxic event…

But if I had any idea I was playing the lottery that night, even at one in a billion odds, even a trillion, I would never have taken the cap handed to me. I loved my life too much to risk it. What hit my brain, eventually took away the best parts of me. I can’t make sense of why it happened, nor will I ever. It’s too crushing.

I’ll also always wonder what good was waiting just around the corner in life if only I’d dropped the pill in my hand. It’s too much to think about now. I made the wrong choice and it’s done. I can’t explain fate. I wasn’t perfect, but I didn’t deserve this. No one does.

For 999,999 people out there, this reaction will never occur, and, since the chances are slim, you’ll soon forget this story. I would have too. Before that night, I never worried. I didn’t know the first thing about medicine, the brain, or drugs. I never stressed. I was living a charmed life and got lucky at each turn. Everything just worked and was good. I was living. That was me and many of you. I hope all of you. I’m jealous you’re still in that world, the one I had for 43 unforgettable years.

But for the next one-in-a-million out there, just maybe, my story gives pause before plugging chemicals into your brain with the power to reshape it in unforeseen ways. Each of us makes our own choices, but from where I stand now, life is too precious to gamble toying with its supercomputer. Our mind is our universe and because it surrounds us, it feels like it will always be the same. As the sun always rises, we carry the Illusion that our mental world is permanent. I did before that night. But the truth is we don’t understand this universe, let alone what can throw off its axis and rotation for good. I learned too late.

I wish I never had this story to tell. I’d give up anything to go back and drop that cap when it was in my hand. It’s a “what-if” moment I’ve replayed ten thousand times, what feels like every hour, sometimes every minute. I can’t change the past, but I hope my story makes this journey useful to another’s future.

Some who know me asked…

Did the system fall short? No.

No, in that MDMA put the writing on the wall. That was my choice, and while it's on its way towards legalization in a bunch of countries including the US, Mexico is not one. Ironically, that morning, Jan 12, Mexican authorities seized on arrival CBD lip balm in my toiletry bag — a stocking-stuffer I’d received on my birthday three days before, purchased over-the-counter in DC. So there is no global consensus on what is safe and what is not.

No, in that I was treated by countless compassionate doctors who did the best they could. Dr. Earley stands out because of his plain-spoken honesty, but he is not alone. There were too many superb neurologists and psychs to name: Yurewics, Fayed, Israel, Hale, Kemp, Rosenthal, Singh, Foster, the list goes on.

Most importantly, No, in that there is not a neurobiologist on earth who understands the human mind. We simply have not reached a point of anything more than presumption at best. So how can any doctor be faulted for not finding my silver bullet?

On the other hand…

Did the system fall short? Yes.

Yes, in that MDMA (3,4-Methyl​enedioxy​methamphetamine) was first synthesized by Merck Pharmaceuticals, owner of the same patented drugs I would later take to fight its damage. You break it, you buy it.

Yes, in that the very medicines prescribed to give me life-preserving sleep gave me life-destroying depression.

Yes, in that nurses at a top-notch medical facility loaned me a 14-foot cable, who knew I was approaching the breaking point. Had I arrived with that cord in my belongings, it would have been confiscated for the glaring risk. 

Yes, in that I turned myself in to the ER in self-induced anoxia, only to be assigned a room beside an unlocked stairwell — when an entire trap-proof floor existed in the same hospital to protect patients in volatile states.

My story seems worth telling if for no other reason than the questions that intersect here across medicine, policy, pharma, drugs, mental health, and brain science.

But none of these questions matter to me now. I wasn’t thinking about any of them as I sat on the log, rolling back the reel of time.

I was remembering the people and places I love.

My story’s told. The question now is how to move on.

I was always loyal to my company and grateful for the colleagues and mentors I share it with. They’ve been loyal all these months, flying the plane, awaiting a return, never giving up hope. I’m told I need a haircut, but blessed to have them in my life, and so much more.

The last thing left to face is my heart.

As a kid, I spent summers at Langley Pool, a small club set on woods beside the Potomac River. Each day, I’d see a reclusive old man with long grey hair enter the neighboring forest — stark naked — and walk a secret path, only he knew, to a tucked-away cove. For as long as anyone could remember, he’d [been building a half-mile long dam](https://wtop.com/news/2011/11/naked-ned-hunts-for-the-infinite-along-the-potomac/) out of rocks by hand in the rapids that, across decades, single-handedly redirected the course of one of America’s most famed waterways. To this day, his handiwork is visible on Google Earth, just west of the American-Legion Bridge.

Legend had it Crazy Ned, as he was known, was stuck in an endless loop from a bad drug trip that broke him, like the [strange case of the frozen addicts](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x95edl8). Looking back, Ned’s appearance in the haze of my childhood, now seems almost like a Biblical omen… this Sisyphus cursed by a pill to push stones against the current forever… a Hailey’s Comet sent to me as a warning from the stars.

But I never saw the sign.

And now the stars — even Karlvagn — have all gone out.  

In the ensuing darkness, there’s no place left to hide from my heart. It’s been sealed shut since May, burying memories that forever haunt me. The shining eyes, dreamy promises, melodies shared, all the time in the world, our own little universe, infinite, the one we wanted, everything, elsklingdom. 

I was once the luckiest. Those who saw, saw pure happiness. I had it all, in my hands, the best parts of a life in the making. But from dreamland to dreamlessness, it slipped away, piece by piece, ripped from my fingers, stripped bare, carried off, a thief in the night, night after night, every night, endlessly, until it all vanished, the ruins of insomnia.

Coming up on the first anniversary of the night that started it all, I keep thinking back to this time last year — healthy and strong, my dreams in motion, soundly sleeping, embarking on what I thought was becoming, like a lightening strike, the brightest chapter of my life. I’d always heard, “From the brightest day, comes the darkest night.” Now I know.

Sleep is like true love. It finds you when you’re not looking. It fills you with dreams. Its melody is a nocturne. And when you lose it, you lose everything.

There is one difference. Everyone knows sleep. Few ever know true love. I could never have known it then, but I lost both that same night.

This December, each carol echoes a bittersweet reminder of those last weeks of shining eyes one year ago, before my story began. I miss those days like you can’t imagine. I’ll never get the shining eyes back. Or why they slipped away.

Here’s hoping ECT erases all the memories — like [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](https://youtu.be/yE-f1alkq9I).
