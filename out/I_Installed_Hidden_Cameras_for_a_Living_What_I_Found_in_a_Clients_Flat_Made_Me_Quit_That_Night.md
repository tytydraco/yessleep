My name’s not important. I used to do freelance surveillance work in London — for private investigators, suspicious landlords, even cheating spouses. Mostly legal, sometimes… grey. You’d be surprised how many people pay to have someone watched. You’d be even more surprised how often they’re right to.

I wasn’t proud of what I did. But it paid the bills. There’s always demand for someone who knows how to install covert cameras and keep their mouth shut.

A few months ago, I got a job through a guy I know — let’s call him Murray. He does risk assessment for property developers, but moonlights in more sensitive services. He passed me a number. A client wanted cameras installed in a flat he owned in Bethnal Green. Nothing fancy — just covert, motion-triggered, night vision, no cloud storage. Strictly local. Disposable. The kind of job that’s over before anyone notices it happened.

I met the client at a Costa by the station. He introduced himself as Mr. Hallam — early fifties, clean-shaven, white shirt, no tie. Banker or ex-military, maybe. Eyes like he was always trying to figure out how much you cost.

He said he was a landlord. One of his long-term tenants — a woman in her late twenties — had started acting “odd.” Not paying rent, deadbolt always locked, covering the peephole. Said she’d been living there six years with no issue, but something had changed in the last month.

“She’s scared,” he said. “But she won’t say of what. I think there’s someone staying there. Someone she’s not telling me about.”

He wanted hidden cameras in the hallway, living room, and kitchen. Not the bathroom. Not the bedroom. He was very specific. “Nothing that would make this illegal,” he said. “You know what I mean.”

I told him I understood. He paid in cash. Half up front, half after. Typical arrangement.

The flat was on the third floor of a converted townhouse. Narrow stairs. No lift. I went in mid-morning while the tenant was at work. I had the keys and a letter saying I was from the maintenance team. No neighbours asked questions. Most people in London don’t want to get involved.

It was a small place. One bed, tiny lounge, cramped kitchen. Sparse furniture. Curtains drawn. No personal touches — no photos, no fridge magnets, not even clothes on the floor. I found that weird. Like she was trying not to leave a trace of herself.

I did the job in about two hours. Tucked the hallway cam into a smoke detector. Kitchen cam inside a plug socket. Lounge cam behind the TV stand. All motion-triggered, local feed to an encrypted thumb drive. Standard kit.

I left the cameras running and told Hallam I’d be back in a week to retrieve the footage.

Five days later, Hallam called. Voice tight. “I need you to pull it now,” he said. “Today.” No reason given. I went after dark, used the same excuse with the same keys. The flat was empty again. No sign of anyone. But something was different.

The hallway light was off — the one that’s always on a timer.

I checked the switch. Someone had ripped the fuse out.

I grabbed the drives and left.

I reviewed the footage at home. The first few days were quiet. The woman — I later found out her name was Erin — mostly kept to herself. Ate alone. Rarely turned on the lights. Sat on the floor in the lounge with headphones on. Never brought anyone over.

But on night three, something changed. Around 2:40 a.m., the hallway cam clicked on. Erin walked past it slowly. Not toward the bathroom — just walking back and forth in the corridor. Over and over. Wearing the same clothes as the day before. No shoes. No sound. No expression.

She did it for six minutes.

Then she stopped. Turned to face the smoke detector — the camera — and just… stared.

She stood there for a full minute. Then she mouthed something.

No audio, but it looked like she said: “He’s in the walls.”

She turned and walked back into the lounge. Camera shut off.

I flipped to the kitchen cam. Nothing for hours — then, at 4:10 a.m., motion. Erin again. Sitting at the table, hands flat. She looked up toward the kitchen window.

There was a man’s reflection in the glass.

But when she turned to look behind her, there was no one there.

She got up and left the kitchen.

The next two nights, the same thing. She barely slept. Paced. Stared at the walls. Whispers, lips moving. Not once did I see anyone else enter or leave. She never made a phone call. Never opened the door.

But every night, she looked at the same spot on the kitchen wall. Right next to the boiler.

And on night five, something happened that still makes my blood go cold.

At 3:22 a.m., the lounge cam triggered. A figure appeared in the lower corner of the screen. Crawling. Slowly. From behind the TV unit. Wearing a grey hoodie. Head down. Bare feet.

It wasn’t Erin.

She was asleep on the floor, by the radiator.

The figure crept halfway across the room. Then stopped. And watched her. For forty-eight minutes.

Didn’t move. Didn’t make a sound.

Then, just before 4:15, the figure turned its head — toward the camera.

Not directly. Just slightly. Enough to know it saw it.

Then it slid backwards — backwards — behind the TV unit again.

I called Hallam. He didn’t answer.

I drove to his address, the one on the invoice. It was a Mailboxes Etc. dropbox. I never saw him again.

I reported what I’d found to the police. Took some convincing, but eventually they got a warrant and searched the flat.

They found a crawlspace behind the kitchen wall. It wasn’t meant to be accessible — just a gap between old plumbing — but someone had cut a hole through the plaster behind the boiler. Just wide enough to squeeze through.

Inside, they found:

\- A thin sleeping mat   
\- Energy bar wrappers   
\- A phone with no SIM card   
\- And a notepad

The notepad had detailed logs — timestamps, diagrams of Erin’s movements, notes like “left flat 9:32 a.m.”, “asleep 1:13 a.m.”, “humming in bathroom.”

It went back at least a month.

They think the guy had been living in the walls for weeks.

Watching her.

Erin was relocated. I don’t know where. I was never told.

As for me — I quit that line of work. Deleted everything. Sold the gear. I’ve had a few sleepless nights since.

Because the police never found out who he was.

No prints. No DNA. No sign of forced entry.

And the footage I gave them? The clip of him crawling out from behind the TV?

It was gone.

Wiped.

Like he knew how to find the drives.

Like he watched me install them.
