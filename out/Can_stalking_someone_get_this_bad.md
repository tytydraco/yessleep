 

Do you guys know what the popular term yandere means? Well I do, I know a little too well because I’m a little bit of yandere myself. I’m willing to go to extremes, I’m willing to obsess if it’s for the person I love...

“Strumming my pain with his fingers”

Oh yes! You have no idea how I feel every time I hear this voice! His gentle humming. It’s the only good part of my day. I feel my heart beating faster and faster, as I hear how he opens the door and I can hear his footsteps now. But his voice is the best part. The way he is singing. So gently and softly.

“Singing my life with his words.”

And that’s when he finally comes in. He's tall, athletic, blond, endless blue eyes. I feel so small and insignificant as he is towering over me. All I can do is squirm. How can he sing so softly when he looks so strong and rough.

“Killing me softly… Oh hi there, sorry I was humming to myself. thank you for coming here on such short notice.”

He smiles at me and I feel like dying. He's the only one who makes me feel so special. I can feel little butterflies in my stomach. All I can do is nod and that’s it. In reality, I just want to reach out and touch his blond hair, which reminds me of autumn leaves, but he’s so tall, how can I reach…

“Hey, I have to go now! Take care of my baby brother for me alright?”

He smiles and once again all I can do is nod, but I want to tell him so many things, about how I like him, how I would do anything for him. But all I can do is just simply stand there and watch him as he leaves out the door singing.

“Killing me softly with his song”

And there isn’t much I can do other than watch him leave. Now is my chance! I giggle to myself. First of course I check out on his baby brother. Thankfully he is sound asleep. So I can finally go to Jake’s room! Yes, his name is Jake! I rush to his room and I can’t help but have a little heart attack. I can’t believe I’m finally here! After loving him from afar for all these years! Me and Jake! Jake is the quarterback! I’m the creepy little goth girl nobody talks to at school. But Jake! He s different! He is the only one who treats me nicely! Always says hi! We even seat together on some lessons. And he's so nice! I love my Jake!

So now I’m here in his room!

I knew where he lived, I followed him once or twice, okay way more times! But I never thought I would be here in his room! I lay on the bed, and I can feel his smell all over the bedsheets! This is amazing! I look through his things, his clothes, I make sure to sniff through all of them. His smell! It makes me ecstatic. I even go through his underwear; it makes me blush. What am I doing? I even tried to access his laptop, but it isn’t as easy.

Time is going a little too fast, so I need to do what I actually came here to do. I take out a little surveillance camera. It’s tiny and easy to hide. I make sure to check in my phone that all is visible on my phone. I feel my heart skip a beat. I really can’t believe that I’ll be able to see him, every day now.

That’s when I hear loud footsteps from the doorway. But I can also hear someone laughing. It’s a girl… a girl is …. Laughing….

“Telling my whole life with his words”  
“Jake you’re a great singer!!!”

All I can do is rush into the next room where Jake’s baby brother is. He’s still sound asleep. Maybe I gave him too many sleeping pills? Never mind. I turn on my phone and put on my earphones to make sure that I hear everything.

I can see Jake enter his bedroom, with… I know that girl… she’s always bullying me…I hate her… why her… I feel hatred fill my stomach, but there is nothing I can do, I can’t even move all I can do is stare at my phone screen.

“I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style”

Jake is humming, he’s so beautiful, he’s taking off his shorts, she’s kissing him, his pulling her hair. I can feel the tears fill up my eyes, gosh I want her to die so much!

“And so I came to see him, to listen for a while”

“Jake stop singing it’s weird.”

I hate this girl, she doesn’t get Jake at all, he asks him to stop singing? She’s a nobody, how can she say that. Can’t Jake see that she is just a phony?

“Really?” Jake smiles with his perfect smile, he looks out of this world, he's pulling her closer. “And there he was, this young boy, a stranger to my eyes.”

He keeps on singing as she rolls her eyes and keeps on kissing him. I feel dizzy. I hate this this is awful!

“Hey, can you tell me why you bully Jane?”

Did Jake just say my name? I feel weird, I’m still crying but now, something feels weird in my heart.

“Who cares about that dumb creep.”

She said it. And that’s when I feel my heart beat faster. I hate her, I wish she would just die, I hate her.

“Oh really?” Jake smiles and then all of a sudden with his one hand he grabs her by the neck.

“Jake what the fuck that hurts let go!”

“Strumming my pain with his fingers”

His humming and then all of sudden he throws his fist into her face.

“one time, one time.”

His singing and smiling, his choking her with one hand and punching her with another one. She’s struggling, but he has a firm grip over her, I can hear a light sob, over his humming.

“Singing my life with his words”

His expression isn’t changing, as the girl’s face is turning into a bloody pulp, she isn’t even resisting anymore, Jake s covered in blood. His white face is all red now. I’m there speechless. I can feel the terror slowly creeping from my legs and I can feel the hair at the back of my neck stand up. I can’t even move. I finally snap out and reach out for the door. I need to get out of here. It’s locked.

“Killing me softly with his song”

That’s when I look at my screen and all I can do is shiver in terror, he's looking right in the camera, I can see his eyes, his face, and hair covered in blood. He is smiling at me.

“See what I did?” he's smiling and holding the girl with her hair, she isn’t moving, I don’t think she is even breathing. “I won’t let anyone say anything bad about you, my little princess!”

All I can do is fidget with the door, I can’t open it, it’s clearly locked from the inside.

“Hey, no need to fidget with the door silly.” He smiles as he drops the dead corpse on the floor. “Just want for me for a bit! I’ll clean up this mess and I’ll be there in a minute!”

All I can do is shake; his eyes are looking straight at me.

“And don’t you dare call the cops you silly goose!” he giggles “I do love you; I would kill for you as you can see, but if you betray me, I’m going to blame everything on you! You dummy! Just wait for me for a bit! I’ll be there after I clean myself! I want to look the best for you!”

He turned around and all I can hear in the background is:

“Telling my whole life with his words”

It’s been an hour, managed to type this out here, but all I can do is wait here, if I call the cops, I know that he will blame everything on me, it will be more logical, I’m the creepy goth girl, he’s the popular quarterback, who are they going to believe in? All I can do is wait here in terror and fear. My phone is going to die out soon, then what? Turnes out I wasn’t the yandere one after all… but the worst part is hearing his voice, so calm and out of this world, he never stops singing.

“Killing me softly with his song”   


Just what the hell should I do?
