Day 1: I'm writing this because I'm stranded out in space‚ and I'm starting to get lonely. I'm gonna run out of food soon‚ but frankly‚ I'd rather die out here than face my boss with a failed mission. My name is Arthur Thiel‚ from Portland‚ Oregon. If you find this‚ then you probably found my body‚ and the planet that I'm stuck on.Day 2: I found water. I tested its Ph and it came out normal‚ and it seems okay. I'm gonna drink it‚ I'll update you.Day 3: It was okay‚ although it tasted dusty. I also found a pretty rock. It's in my pocket now.Day 4: I think there was something in the water‚ I'm feeling weird‚ like I want more‚ more than normal.Day 5: Nothing interesting happened today.Day 9: I forgot the last few days‚ but I saw something. I don't know what it was. It looked like a person‚ but it was far too tall‚ and it just stood‚ watching me. I've seen it getting closer‚ but I don't think that it's hostile. I'm going to name it Ash.Day 12: Ash's been getting closer‚ and I don't know why. It's outside of my shuttle now. And I'm running low on food‚ so I need to start rationing.Day 13: There's more of them‚ at least another three. I'll name the others Matt‚ Kirsten‚ and Fiona‚ after my family. They're the only family I have up here.Day 22: Matt gave me something. A knife. I saw it leave it outside‚ and it dissapeared before I could get to it.Day 25: I'm changing. I've noticed that I'm getting taller now‚ and I don't like it.Day 26: I don't remember the last time that I've showered... I'm going back to the water to bathe.Day 27: There was something in the water‚ it looked like those things‚ but smaller‚ and it bit my ankle. The wound's been swelling.Day 38: Sorry about not saying anything. I think that I'm starting to communicate with all of those things.Day 40: There's hundreds of them. Maybe even thousands‚ all standing outside of my shuttle. I can see them now‚ they don't have faces. It's just a void of darkness. I think they take offence to me.Day 41: I offered them the knife‚ and they took it. I'm worried."Day 43: It's inside. Standing over me. It's not moving‚ and I'm writing this now. It's just staring at me. I think this is Kirsten.Day 44: Theres more. Ash joined. Every time I move around‚ they follow me.Day 58: The shuttle isn't safe anymore. It spoke to me‚ kind of. I heard it's voice in my head. It said "We know what you are. We know what you did.". I don't know what I did. I've done lots of things.Day 59: I tried to commincate with one‚ the one who spoke to me. It responded with one word. I asked it what it meant by "We know what you did"‚ and it only said "Hypomania.".Day 65: I got cell. I don't know how‚ but I did. I looked up Hypomania‚ and it means " Hypomania and mania are **periods of over-active and high energy behaviour that can have a significant impact on your day-to-day life**. Hypomania is a milder version of mania that typically lasts for a shorter period. This is usually a few days, although the length of time can vary.". I don't know why that's something bad.Day 91: I'm scared. They've started screaming. I can't hear myself. They're all just staring up at the sun‚ screaming.Day 99: The sun seems so beautiful. My face hurts‚ and my mouth is gone. I think I'm turning into one. I want to go outside and look at the sun.130: It's so pretty outside‚ I can't help but scream.Day 134: I'm one of them. I have a gun. I can't become one of them. My face is gone‚ like them. I'm going to shoot myself.  
Day 135: Goodbye.  
Day 136: *this entry is blank*  
Day 452: I found this notebook. I don't want to read it‚ but I'm going to.  
  

Day 453: I found the body. I think I touched it. I'm going home‚ but I think that I'm "Infected" too. God save Earth.
