My job is not the easiest thing in the world. Or the safest.

People have their heads smashed into the ground on a regular basis. Men and women have their hands and feet torn off their bodies all the time. Experienced soldiers in full body armor are sliced in half, chewed up, and swallowed by things I can only describe as not of this world. But I'll be lying if I say the pay isn't good. In fact, that's the only thing keeping us from quitting.

My name is Marsh, and I work as a special ops foot soldier for a private military corporation task with capturing and restraining monsters before they are discovered by the general public. In other words, I work at an interdimensional traveling agency for monsters. Security division. Which means, the amount of crazy I'm asked to deal with almost every week is anything short of pure insanity.

The work is scary.

Very scary.

Imagine hunting down a mutated lizard creature through an active sewage tunnel in the deepest of darkness, only to begin getting picked off one by one by the same mutated reptilian abomination because it suddenly winked off your radar and is now pulling your teammates underwater and tearing them to shreds.

Or, imagine chasing down a part snake, part woman hybrid through a dark alley, who is capable of seeing in the dark, smelling her opponents coming a mile away by licking the air, and spitting hot and slimy acid which is able to singe through your clothes and melt the skin off your bones.

Or, if that isn't frightening enough, imagine being trapped in a dark underground facility with the dead bodies of at least a hundred scientists strewn about the area, with numerous deformed and demented devil creatures prowling through the silent and bloodied halls, searching for their next victim.

So yeah. The work is, definitely scary.

It typically takes us a few hours to capture a target. Sometimes it might take us longer than a week. But the general protocol after capturing a creature is to gather up the body, dead or alive, and drive it off to one of our many undisclosed temporary holding facilities strewn about the country. After that, it's all about playing the waiting game and boiling a few rounds of coffee while we run shifts to keep an eye on the subject and wait for the higher ups to send in a van to cart it off to the even bigger super-secret government facility located somewhere on the planet.

That's it.

The thing is, every once in a while, strange things somehow manage to get sucked into this world. Maybe they’re beings from another planet or solar system, or the simple manifestation of some of humanity’s most messed up and twisted minds. Some of these entities don't want to outright destroy humanity at first glance. Most of them just want to survive and others just want to be left alone. But there are also those that won't hesitate to rip you into a million little pieces the second you do so much as enter their field of vision. And those are usually the creatures that make our jobs a million times harder.

Currently, I am upstairs at one of our secret facilities nursing a broken leg. The lights are turned off and the AC is cranked up to its maximum capacity. Some of my squad mates are out for the night chasing down another assignment. Others are downstairs right now guarding several abominations locked up in a few of our cells. One of such creatures is the Brazilian flying fish. A walking abomination of a sardine with robot legs, a sword, and two machine guns strapped to its back. This particular creature is known as subject 4 16, and currently has 253 kill count to its name. 

Another very dangerous interdimensional prisoner is known as subject 3:3:3. Aka, Razorback. This monster is a blend between a giant oversized alligator man person and a metal porcupine. He currently stands at a whopping 15 ft, and the best way to describe him is to imagine a great humongous bodybuilder with an alligator's snout, tail, and a hedgehog's back full of massive metal porcupine spikes. He currently has a kill count of 662 and has escaped confinement at least three times. Hopefully, there's no way he's escaping this time.

And the last but most certainly not the least, is subject 4 4 7.

We call him Bobby for short.

He is a 12ft tall, behemoth of a monster with snowy white fur, deep black eyes, and razor-sharp yellowish teeth. He is classified by our superiors as extremely dangerous and intelligent and should be placed under constant supervision 24/7. He is also the reason for my current broken leg. But compared to what he did to some of the other soldiers during the covert operation organized to capture him, my injuries are just a slap on the wrist. Some of my mates were not so lucky.

At 0 800 about two nights ago, we got a ping from our surveillance team up north. A drone had picked up movement of a large white furry creature strolling through the mountains in British Columbia, and all physical and bio signatures indicated that it was most likely Bobby. Further investigation showed he had escaped multiple attempted arrests by the fire team native to that quadrant and had racked up a body count of 17 victims in the span of his run. A lone hiker. A couple camping in a tent in the mountains. Two police officers who had gone into the woods to investigate the disappearance of the missing hiker. And a pleasant family picnic that had ended in a bloody mess after this large, and imposing, grizzly white creature resembling a man had stepped out of the trees and attacked the dad. Killing the man by smashing his skull and traumatizing the poor man’s family before escaping into the trees.

The remaining 11 victims are casualties of special ops foot soldiers who tried to apprehend the thing but failed. Needless to say, Bobby needed to be stopped at all costs. And fast.

It took us half a day to prep for the hunt. The other half was spent forcefully keeping our butts down in the helicopter seats. When we finally arrived at the top of the cold and snowy mountains, the other fire teams were already present, armed, and ready to go. Fire team 1, and fire team 2. With a shared number of up to 24 trained army personnel between the three teams. No infantry support.

We offloaded our stuff and quickly began setting up a makeshift campsite in case it was going to be one of the longer missions. The last time we had to camp out for quite some time on a job was when we spent the better part of a month trying to capture the Brazilian flying fish hiding away somewhere in the waters of Antarctica. We finished up our tents and went about filling up on a few MREs, which quickly dissolved into friendly chatter and moments when we actually began to know about each other. And the second the last rays of sunlight disappeared over the horizon and the blanketed night sky began rolling in, we got a unified signal from the various squad leaders that it was time to move.

We got off our asses and began to reattach some of our combat gears to our uniform. Helmets. Belts. Jackets. And lots of lots of ammo packs. The last thing to get picked up were our bags, weapons, and automatic rifles. And the moment the squad leader gave the thumbs up to press forward, The Hunt was on.

We filed out into the cold and windy darkness, each team led by the designated group leader. Other than the soft crunch of fresh snow underneath our boots, nobody from the collection of soldiers made a sound. The cold breeze continued its vicious howling all around us, and the layers of falling snow were starting to make it difficult to see. We pressed on, only stopping when one of the group leaders had to consult the mapped-out directions provided by the drone to make sure we were moving in the right direction.

We weren't just performing a random sweep of the terrain. We were being specific. We were looking for its home, hideout, or whatever you choose to call it. And the second a soldier in the front reported finding giant footprints in the snow, was the second we knew we were getting close.

We continued onward, and soon came face to face with a massive rough stone triangular shaped opening leading into a deep dark cave. There was a whistle from a personnel in the crowd, and a collective moment of shock, wonder, and horror as another soldier followed it up by saying: well just how big is this thing? Then the trooper who had first found the prints, called the attention of her superior after discovering something strange with the positioning of some of the tracks.

There were two sets of footprints. One pair led up to the mouth of the cave, passed the entrance, and disappeared into the darkness inside. The other pair led away from the entrance and continued on a downward slope along the side of the snow-covered structure before vanishing at a corner with a million possible directions as to where the target might have gone.

But that wasn't the worst part.

The prints leading up to the entrance of the cave weren't fresh. Drops of snowflakes had already started to cover them, and they were quickly losing their depths by the second. The footprints leading away from the entrance, however, were still fresh. Still retained their depths. An indicated to the squads that whatever was residing within the cave had only stepped out mere minutes before.

That was bad.

Part of our plan was to capture Bobby while he was asleep. Although it was less impressive, it was also much cleaner and more effective, and it was going to have less of our troopers killed. Now that it was all but confirmed that he might be awake and walking about in the Snowy darkness, it was only going to make things worse. And after a quick deliberation on the situation by the three group leaders, a decision was made.

Fire team one was going to round the corner and go search for any trace that the creature might have continued in that direction. Fire team two was going to walk up to the interior of the cave and search inside for any hidden surprises. And fire team three. The group I was a part of. We were tasked with providing overwatch and serving as secondary backups to either of the two teams. If ever such need were to arise. And arise it surely did. Just not in the way we were expecting.

Several minutes past and the curtains of falling snow only seemed to thicken. The wind started to push against our backs even stronger and the cold was all but turning us into ice sculptures.

Fire team two were halfway down into the heart of the cave, and fire team one was still continuing on their trailing pursuit along the mountain side. None of the two teams had met up with any sort of resistance whatsoever, and the pending confrontation was only making me sweat despite the cold. It took a little while longer, but someone eventually found something. Fire team two had stumbled across what looked like a circular metal structure at the bottom of the cave, with a bunch of heavy wires and chords connected to the back of the thing. Further scans showed that it resembled a decent-sized unlicensed underground interdimensional transporter, with the only things missing being a couple screws here and there, and a megaton fusion powered generator.

Now. It's no headline material to learn of monsters who slowly begin to develop the skills necessary of handling certain human tools and technologies. A good example of this is the Brazilian flying fish who currently do wheels twin machine guns and one katana strapped to its back. But monsters who turn smart enough to gather the exact components and materials needed for interdimensional travel, they become a problem. Only the agency is allowed to possess and operate interdimensional transporters of any kind. And the last time the technology fell into the wrong hands,, an entire small town was almost flooded by an army of war hungry devil gremlins from hell. So, never letting that happen again became the number one priority in any operation.

Fire team two was ordered to immediately begin disassembling the thing, while fire team one pressed on with their search in the snow, still following the footsteps. We remained locked in our position, waiting and listening. The layers of falling snow were too dense to see through, even flashlights coupled with night vision only helped a little. And just as I assumed the squad leader was about to call off the operation and postponed the hunt to another day, something happened.

Several burst of machine gun fire began to ring out in the distance, followed by the guttural roar of something big and angry. Our coms and speakers instantly flared up with chaotic chatter and frightened cries for help, and the soldiers of fire team one sounded like they were being torn apart by an unkillable enemy. We simultaneously turned towards our group leader, with fear and anxiety starting to seep through our lungs  and settle within our chests. But instead of giving the order to run backup and go assist the soldiers, he had one finger up in the air while his other hand was twiddling with the volume controls on his earpiece. It took us a second to figure out what particular noise he was trying to toon in on.

Underneath the vicious tearing of flesh, screaming, and thundering assault of automatic gunfire, there were several phrases in the background being repeated over and over again by one of the soldiers.

“Shit!”

“It has a generator!”

“It's coming towards the cave!”

“It has a generator!”

“It's coming towards the cave!”

My stomach sank, and a chill ran down my spine. Of course it was coming here. Why wouldn't it?

Our team leader immediately gave the go-go-go signal, and the entire group spread out into the night to take up tactical positions near the cave. Snipers to the sides. Marksmen in the middle. Guys and gals with the heavier weaponry at the back. Our objective was suddenly a whole lot simpler. Well, simple enough to understand that is. No matter what happens, do not let the giant furry snowman enter the cave with the generator in hand. Failing or retreating was not an option.

As we lifted our heads up to face the darkness in front of us, we lined up our rifles so we were gazing through the scopes and rested our fingers on the triggers. Sedation never worked on creatures like Bobby anyway. They're just too big and something in their blood boils the toxin before it's even allowed to take effect.

The strong winds continued their vicious howling all around us and the cold breeze was starting to freeze over our faceplates. In the distance, the chatter of rapid gunfire continued for a little while longer before suddenly coming to an abrupt halt. After that, no other shots rang out. The screaming in the speakers suddenly stopped. Nothing else made a sound.

The place was dead silent. The only thing I could make out were the cold winds and the sound of my nervous breathing flowing in and out of my nostrils. Which was interspersed with the erratic thump thump thump of my nervous beating heart. Nothing else.

I usually refer to those moments as the calm before the storm. The moments when it's almost as if time itself is at a standstill and nothing else exists. But it never lasts long. And soon, the insanity starts up again.

Our speakers suddenly crackled to life and fire team two asked if they should split their team in half and come provide backup. Our group leader replied by telling them to prepare for the possibility but stand by at the moment. That was the very decision that almost got half of our team killed because no sooner had he given those orders that one of our snipers caught something trudging towards us through the snow.

“Bogi in bound.” A female sniper on the right said. “10:00.” She added, tracing the target through the enhanced double-level optics on her weapon's scope.

It took a second for the sniper on the left to confirm her discovery.

“Got it.” The male sniper on the left said, and I suddenly wished my equipment also came with enhanced night vision and double level optics because I couldn't see jack shit through the curtains of thick snow in front of me.

“Permission to fire?” The girl asked, no doubt her weapon already zeroed in on her target as she slowly squeezed the trigger on her rifle preparing to fire.

“Granted,” The group leader replied, and the simultaneous bang of two powerful sniper rifles went off as their armor piercing rounds disappeared into the darkness and sped towards their target. Then the group leader requested a status report, and we were all delighted when both snipers claimed a direct hit. But the excitement was short lived. The creature was still standing.

The only thing the high precision bullets managed to do was tear off a chunk of its face and force it to sink down to its knees for a second, but it wasn't enough to bring it down. At least, not entirely anyway.

Annoyed, the group leader ordered three more shots in quick succession, but none of the bullets hit home this time around as the creature suddenly got to its feet and started barreling in our direction. The calm was over, and the storm was now rolling in. Literally.

The snipers continued shooting into the darkness and the moment the creature entered our field of vision the entire squad opened fire. The night was suddenly lit up by orange flashes from our combined weapon's combustion blasts as every soldier emptied all of their magazines in the body of the thing. Bobby was a raging behemoth at that point, letting out guttering roars and smashing into troopers as if they were nothing. His entire fur from head to toe was a bloodied mess, with deep gashes all over his body from bullet wounds, and missing flesh ripped apart by speeding shrapnel. The air smelt of spent gunpowder and hot smoke, but Bobby did not relent from beating our asses to a pulp.

His first victim was one of the marksmen standing in front of me. He simply grabbed the dude by the head and flung him backwards as if he were tossing away a ragdoll. That particular soldier ended up with a dislocated collarbone and several spinal injuries. He is currently receiving treatment in one of our nearby hospitals. I really hope he makes it. 

The second dude was not so lucky. After throwing away the first marksman, Bobby lurched forward once more. He was still clutching the megaton generator and simply swung it into the face of the second soldier. Blunt force trauma to the head from a creature as big as Bobby and an object as thick as a fusion generator killed him instantly. Poor guy never had a chance.

The third guy was a bit lucky. So was I.

Bobby had taken so much lead into his body that he was finally starting to slow down. His attacks weren't as vicious anymore and the generator he was still carrying only seemed to complicate things for him. He simply slammed into the third soldier with a powerful sweep of his arm, sending the trooper flying into the snow with minimal injuries. When we finally came face to face, he clearly planned to strike me with the metal generator, just like he did the second guy.

However, just as he initiated the swing, a female soldier rushed up behind me and pushed me out of the way. She took the brunt of the impact on her side before flying and tumbling backwards near the mouth of the cave and coming to a stop unconscious. Several broken ribs. A slightly punctured liver. And internal bleeding. These were just a few of the injuries she had suffered for taking a blow that was meant for me. I don't know why she keeps doing that, I keep telling her to stop but she wouldn't listen. The soldier in particular was Olgha Harris, a senior member of fire team 2 and my unofficial self-appointed babysitter when we were out in the field. She was gravely wounded for putting her life on the line to save mine instead of her own, but I was glad when I found out after the mission that she would make a full recovery. But even though she had risked her life to save mine, I wasn't quite out of the woods just yet.

Hails of bullets continued rushing towards Bobby as he lifted his arms to shield his face. Although he had stopped attacking the rest of the soldiers, his goal of wanting to enter the cave was something the rest of the troopers could still not allow. He pressed forward despite the fact, and the surviving soldiers backed up a couple of steps while still firing steady rounds of flesh tearing projectiles at him. And as soon as fire team two finally arrived to join the fight, the combined fire power became too much for Bobby to handle. He began to slowly move backwards not paying attention to where he stepped. At this point I was still on the ground behind him, after being pushed out of the way of his earlier swing, and I was trying my best to stay below the line of gunfire while belly crawling out of the way.

You can probably guess what happened next.

Yep. This massive behemoth of a monster stumped right on my lower leg with his full weight. This was of course followed by a sickening snap as waves of unbelievable pain shot through my nerves and registered in my brain.

I screamed through clenched teeth, and I suddenly felt light-headed and dizzy. The pain was already unbearable, but it only got worse when he lifted his leg up to continue his retreat. I tried crawling away faster from the flying shrapnel that followed him, but I was no longer quick enough. That's when an 800-millimeter slug snaked out the point of a rocket launcher which was fired by one of the soldiers at the back and hurtled towards Bobby. The shockwave caused by the explosion that followed the impact slammed my head against the ground. That combined with the severe pain from my broken leg made me lose consciousness. Just like that, the mission was over. And as crazy as it might sound, it was a success.

Bobby had been knocked out thanks to the rocket and would not be waking up for quite some time. The fallen and wounded soldiers were gathered up and transported via helicopter to the nearby hospitals.

Fire team two was able to successfully decouple the interdimensional transporter, and the various parts were collected and transported to a research facility located at HQ.

Sadly, fire team one made up most of the casualties. Almost every single soldier was killed in action. Those that survived later succumbed to their injuries at the hospital. In the end there were only three survivors. But their noble sacrifice was the only reason the rest of us were able to come back home. We will always be grateful for that. And we will never forget a single name or face belonging to those soldiers who gave their lives to save ours.

*******

All right guys, I've decided to stop here for the night. It's almost a quarter past midnight and I want to hobble to the mess hall to look for Olgha. She was released from surgical recovery a few hours ago, so she should be there. I am going to scold her a little for continuously risking her life to save mine, then I am going to thank her a lot for once again risking her life to save my ass. Her team is currently on an assignment to capture a massive spider frog that was found in a woman's backyard, but as she is still recovering she wasn't allowed to go. So I've decided to go keep her company while she ate. 

Anyway.

I really have to be going but as soon as I have more free time on my hands I will be sure to come back and tell you more stories. The Brazilian flying fish. The warrior princess from another solar system. A giant robot lobster with an armored outer plating capable of withstanding the shock from a mini nuclear warhead. And much more. For now though, I must be going, and I will talk to you later.

Stay safe.

Marsh.
