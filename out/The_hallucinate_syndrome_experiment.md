Flipping through the pages, I felt a chill creep up my spine. The notebook contained a detailed account of a horrific experiment conducted in 1978. It spoke of trapping individuals in isolated rooms, exposing them to hallucinogenic gas, and paying them $100 for every hour they endured. The experiment was known as 'The Halluse Syndrome', and the experimenters were Leo, Mark, Alex and Jonathan - all scientists with a dark fascination."
and i will now explain in detail excatly whats written in the notebook”

"Before we started the experiment, Alex got over his nerves. He wanted me to rethink. He thought it was a ”harmfull” experience. But i just told him: "You're just weak. Go do something useful. Or I'll put you in there with them!"

:log 2:

"And then it began."
The experiment unfolded as Leo described in excruciating detail. The rooms were quiet, pitch black and without sound. Scientists delivered food and water without a word and maintained an eerie silence. Participants had the option to quit, but as the text in the notebook explained: "NONE has made it through 5 days..."

HOUR 1: 

The first hour in the dark, isolated chambers was a disorienting descent into sensory deprivation. The participants groped in the pitch-black gloom, hands trembling as they searched for some semblance of familiarity. The absence of light played tricks on their minds, and some began to report subtle, disturbing distortions in their perception. A few saw fleeting shadows lurking at the edge of their vision, and strange, ethereal whispers seemed to flicker through the air like distant radio transmissions. They had entered the realm of the unknown, a place where reality and hallucination blur into a confusing haze.

HOUR 5: 

The fifth hour marked a turning point, where the boundaries between reality and hallucination became increasingly porous. Whispers, faint but persistent, insinuated themselves into the minds of the participants. These disembodied voices were like echoes of forgotten memories, beckoning, persuading and sometimes begging them to abandon their torment. It was as if the very air around them was permeated with a spectral chorus of voices, each pleading for release. Still, despite the growing anxiety, 47 individuals remained steadfast in their resolve, determined to endure whatever this experiment had in store.

DAY 2: 

As the second day dawned, the situation took a nightmarish turn. At precisely 10 o'clock in the morning, the chambers rang with agonizing screams that pierced the oppressive silence. The participants described the source of their torment as an ominous voice, one that seemed to emanate from the very walls of their enclosure. It pleaded for flight, its tone shifting from desperation to menace as it warned of impending terror. This voice was relentless, unrelenting in its torment, leaving the participants breathless. Only 30 individuals persevered through this harrowing day, their minds frayed at the edges.

DAY 3: 

Gray, grotesque creatures materialized in the inky darkness of the chambers on the third day. These twisted apparitions taunted and tormented the participants, their ominous laughter echoing like an ominous symphony. The voice that had tormented them since the beginning grew more terrifying, its utterances filled with dire threats that made them shudder. Shadows danced on the periphery of their vision, and some swore they could feel icy, sticky fingers brushing against their skin. Participants were locked in a macabre dance with their own fears, with only 15 souls enduring this day of relentless psychological onslaught.

:log 7:

DAY 4: 

On the fourth day, physical torment joined the psychological horrors. Deep cuts appeared on the participants' bodies, mysterious wounds that defied explanation. These injuries required surgery upon release, a grim testament to the disturbing nature of their ordeal. The gray monsters, once mere apparitions, now manifested with terrifying clarity. They seemed to derive sadistic pleasure from feasting in the arms of the hapless victims. The Voice's promises of impending doom hung in the air like a malevolent mist, and only 5 participants endured the relentless torment, their minds teetering on the brink of madness.

:log 8:

DAY 5:

 The fifth and final day was a descent into a nightmarish abyss. Hundreds of gray monsters, grotesque and insatiable, swarmed the remaining three participants. These creatures pulled them towards a yawning abyss that defied comprehension, their eyes glittering with malice. The voice, now more deafening and tormenting than ever, filled every corner of their minds and drowned out rational thought. The participants were thrown into a living nightmare, a maelstrom of terror, pain and hallucinations from which there seemed no escape. The abyss beckoned, and the participants teetered on the precipice of their own sanity, their fates hanging by the thinnest of threads.

:log 9:

Only 2 of the 3 last people survived. The 2 WHO survived threw themself out. Whitout eyes, arms and lost mutch skin. The last survivor died just a minute later. And exactly no one knows why he even stayed there for this long. But i guess that no one will ever know. I killed Alex, mark and Jonathan after that. I know that the grey creature or whatever it was, Are proud over me. I will put on the gas and get in the chaimber myself. NOTE THIS! Me leo. Im not crazy. Im just really willingly doing what humanity wants! And the humanity wants progression! ”end off log”



thats in detail everything thats been written in the notebook.  I continued to read this harrowing account, my heart sank and my mind struggled to comprehend the depth of human suffering described in the notebook. The last pages of the notebook were blank, leaving the ultimate fate of the unfortunate participants shrouded in darkness. I couldn't help but wonder if anyone had survived this horrible experiment or if it had consumed them completely.
With a heavy sigh I closed the notebook, its cover creaking softly as if echoing the silent screams of those who had endured 'The Halluse Syndrome'. The laboratory around me remained desolate, a haunting reminder of the horrors that had unfolded within its walls.
I knew this ominous tale would stay with me, a terrifying reminder of the darkness that could inhabit the human mind and the depths to which individuals could be pushed in the name of scientific curiosity. As I left the abandoned lab, I couldn't shake the feeling that some secrets were better buried, hidden in the shadows of history, never to be unearthed again
