I (43F) think something is following  my son (17M). 

A couple nights ago he went to hang out with some friends. Ever since he came home he’s been acting..strange. He won’t talk to me no matter what I try. He’s locked in his room and won’t come out. And some of you might be like ‘Well isn’t that just normal teenager?’ and maybe it is for some but my son is NOT like that. He’s an amazing boy and I’m truly worried about him. Especially after what happened last night. 

It was maybe 3:00 AM? Somewhere around then and I woke to crashing and screaming from his room. I ran to him and when I opened the door I saw him sitting straight up, eyes wide open. His eyes were vacant and he had this creepy grin plastered on his face. I was horrified. But that’s not even the worst part. I heard scratching coming from above my head. I looked up and saw this slim, spider-like black creature hanging from the ceiling. Its claws were dug into the roof and its eyes were glowing red. It was staring at my son, not looking away. I didn’t know what to do. This..thing clearly wanted him. For what I had no clue. 

It’s the morning now and I didn’t get any more sleep. My son is still in his room and I haven’t been back in. I’m considering calling a medium or maybe an exorcist to get rid of this creature. 

UPDATE: I called the medium and I’m even more worried than before. As soon as she walked into the house she looked like she was going to be sick. She told me she felt a very strong evil presence and no shit. There was A FUCKING DEMON HANGING FROM MY SONS CEILING. Sorry, sorry. I’m just freaking out a little here. When I took her to my sons room and showed her where I saw the demon, fear filled her face. She told me it wasn’t good. She said my son had brought a demon home. It’s been a couple hours since she left and all I can think about is what did my son do that night? Was he really with friends? 

UPDATE 2: I saw the demon again tonight. I was brushing my teeth when something brushed against the top of the mirror. When I looked up I saw it. Its long black limbs, red eyes, and sharp teeth. Something was dripping from its teeth and a drop of it fell on my forehead. When I reached up and wiped it from my forehead my fingers came away red. It was blood. I screamed and ran out of the room. I locked myself in my bedroom for what must’ve been an hour. After the hour mark, I realized I hadn’t heard my son in his room since before I was in the bathroom, showering and getting ready for bed. When the demon had showed up with blood on its teeth. What if..what if it was my sons blood? I raced to his room and there he was. Laying dead on the bedroom floor. Blood pooled around him and his eyes were wide open, that same stupid grin on his face. I couldn’t stand to be in that room any longer so I ran back to my room. It’s been a couple hours now and I can hear the blasted monster scratching at my door. Sooner or later it’s going to get in and I think we all know how that ends.
