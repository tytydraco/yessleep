As stated above I need a rational explanation for wahat happened.

There is a little back story but I am still shaken from what happened.

I love camping big time camper I have done alot of solo camping typically in the great bear Lake area of Ontario and last weekend was my new wife Yue and my first camping trip.

I'm going to make a very long story short

We went camping together over the weekend and I had planned on staying a week alone my wife had to work so on Sunday she left the only access point to the camp is by boat (very important information) I own a fishing boat.

I dropped her back to shore got her back to the car after she left I made my way back to the camp.

Evereything was normal I had a blast fishing Sunday Monday and Tuesday.

But after what happened I was scared enough to say Naw in going home and that's saying alot like I have been chased by moose in heat bears and coyotes that wanted to eat me and fuck I shook it off like nothing.

On late Tuesday night early wenday morning it was late very late the stars were out and it's pitch black like there's literally nothing but forest in the area.

I was sitting by my camp fire just watching the embers burn and I hear crunch crunch coming from off in the distance behind my camp in the forest I just figured it was a bear so I did what I normally would I got loud grabbed my bear made stoked the fire up and just continued enjoying the night.

The crunch stopped and yah I went back to my fire thinking back my danger census should have been going off because it was quiet and yah it's the forest it's quiet but not that kind of quiet there is always sounds from bugs bats birds ect.

After some time passed I hear the crunch of what I thought had to be a bear behind my camp but this time much much closer and Bears them selfs are scary fucking things so I did what any person would do I screamed a Huge RAHHH to scare the animal off.

Now what happend next shook me to my core.

Someone/thing said BABe babe I'm here the real scary shit was it was my wife's voice
(One thing any man can attest to is you know your wife's voice)

I screamed WHOS there and got a response of babe (when my wife and I talk we call eachother babe)
Proceeded by a fast paced crunching sound moving towards my camp at a much faster pase a brisk walking speed.

My stomach dropped everey alarm bell in my head went off and the flight or fight sense kicked in my bodie almost moved on it's own and I sprinted to my boat 

I pushed that shit in the water the boat is a key start and yah I gunned it full throttle 

I forgot to untie the boat from the tree it was on that's how scared I was but yah the tieoff roap snapped.


I moved so fast like I was out of there I hit a rock I put a nice big dent in the underbelly of my boat.

Now if you know the great bear Lake at night it's black Blacker than black you can't see your hand infront of your face kinda black

I got my self to the middle of that lake and ankered down I spent the night in my boat with my eyes wide open.

I listened intently I could hear something tearing my camp apart.

Something let out this horrific scream.

And I stayed in the middle of that lake untill high noon.

I did go back to my camp.

All my shit was torn apart

But I know it was not a bear the cooler was tipped over the food was everywhere but not eaten.

I left my wallet there so I know it wasn't a person I found my wallet tossed money still inside.


So yah I'm not going back alone.


Someone just give me some peace of mind give me some rational explanation
