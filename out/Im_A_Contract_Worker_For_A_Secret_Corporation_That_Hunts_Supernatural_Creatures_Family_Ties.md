Some work came my way, just small jobs here and there. Dr. Fillow needed to look at my leg soon. Lately, I’ve been feeling a dull pain coming from it. The last time he was here he just re-wrapped the bandages saying it was fine. We both knew this leg was temporary. Unlike supernatural creatures, attaching a new limb wasn’t easy for humans. I was lucky the current one lasted as long as it did. We often chatted a little whole he was here. I think the main reason why I was avoiding him was because I didn’t want to explain my failing relationship. Dr. Fillow could be a bit nosy.  

Was it even a relationship? We never made that clear. Ito still replied to my messages and we sometimes called each other after his jobs but we hadn’t seen each other in a while. Was he really that busy with work? 

August called asking if I was free. We hadn’t had a job together for a while so I agreed. He didn’t give a lot of details about what we would be doing. Sometimes The Corporation called for workers before they got the full scope of how much man power would be needed. August either wanted to do less work, or he wanted to be around a friendly face for once.   

I arrived outside of a forest to meet him. I saw a few Agents huddling around waiting for more details. I didn’t recognize any of them. Deep down I had hoped this was a nice and easy job with Ito. He wasn’t around most likely off doing something more important. I took a glance off in the woods. Nothing appeared out of place so I didn’t understand why we had been called. 

August found me. I tried sounding excited to see him. He easily noticed my lack of energy.  

“What’s bothering you Home Slice?” August asked.  

It was impossible to tell if he was joking or thought that was current lingo people use.   

“I think Ito is avoiding me.” I admitted.  

“He’s an Agent. They deal with world-ending dangers every other day. I'm sure he's either working or recovering.” August shrugged.  

“I know that. I just have this nagging feeling at the back of my mind.” I sighed.  

August didn’t seem to care too much about my relationship worries. At least he was good enough to listen and give advice on a topic that bored him.  

“What are you expecting from him? Do you want this all to be public? Do you want to move in together and get married someday? Or is this all just for sex?” He said in an oddly serious tone I wasn’t used to hearing from him.  

I opened my mouth to respond unsure of what to say. I shook my head and he went on.  

“You two need to talk openly about what you both want. There is nothing wrong with just enjoying each other's company. If he’s not ready to commit right now you need to decide if you can wait, or if you two need to break things off.” 

I nodded already knowing all this but I needed someone to say my thoughts out loud.  Although it would be hard to follow his advice if Ito didn’t want to talk in person.  

“You almost sound like you know what you’re talking about even though no one wants to date you.”  

He took my insult as a compliment and gave a peace sign and a dimpled smile. Our conversation ended with Evie arriving with someone else. When April saw us, her face turned into a dirty scowl and she hid behind her handler.   

With August and April next to each other it was obvious they were related. August stiffened and didn’t look down at his sister as she fumed.   

The air between them was cold and heavy. And I got stuck in the middle of it. Evie shrugged showing she had dealt with this kind of situation before.  

I had no idea what happened between the siblings to act so coldly with each other. April took hold of my arm to cling to as she gave August death glares.  

“Are you two going to be able to work together or should one of you go home?” I asked looking between them.  

“I don’t know what you mean. It’s only you and me standing here. And we work just fine with each other.” April replied, nose up.  

“What on Earth did you do to your little sister?” I said to August point blank.  

I didn’t feel like dealing with this immature bickering. August didn’t acknowledge his sibling hissing at my side.  

“I told you! I don’t have a brother!” April said sounding younger than she looked and she started to violently shake me.  

I caught the eye of an Agent and silently begged for help. He shook his head and hurried off leaving me to deal with the grave I dug.  

“I suppose you could say I did something in a previous life that my family, no, species would not agree with due to their foolish pride.” August said, hands neatly folded behind his back and eyes staring forward.  

“Our customs aren’t foolish! What’s foolish is that you're letting us be used like chained dogs!”  

April peeled away from me, her face red with anger and tears in her eyes. Evie’s eyes fell to the side distraught. She was the one holding their leash and she felt guilty because of it. August and April had lost their home, their family, and their freedom because of the collars. And from the looks of things, August was the one who tightened the spell on their throats.  

“I made sure my only family walked off that mountain alive. No matter how much you hate me for it I would do it again because I love you.”  

This time August addressed April directly when he spoke. She couldn’t hold his gaze and turned away frustrated. She left a swift kick on his shin and fled the scene. I let her go wanting her to cool off before we started working.   

We needed to wait for nearly an hour to find out what we were all doing there. Finally, a woman with a clipboard called us in to go over the task for the day.  

“We found an underground lab made by the Hunters. A cleaner went through and we have gauged the threat level to be lower than we first assumed. We shall keep four to do the final sweep while the others can be assigned to another task.” She explained and started to direct Agents away to a new assignment.  

I was told that there was a simple medical plant gathering request they wanted me to take. I was going to leave but heard they wanted August and April to work together. That wouldn’t be good at all. The other two that were going to stay was a shorter woman standing next to a creature I’d never met before. He was very tall with a messy head of mossy hair. He adjusted his large sweater annoyed he was struck working while others got to leave.   

August was trustworthy enough to work without his handler. Evie was free to go. She offered to get me to my next job. I shook my head and approached the woman with the clipboard.  

“Would I be able to stay here?” I suggested.  

She noticed the tense air between the four people that was meant to work together. She realized they needed a meditator.  

“That would be fine.” She agreed.  

April hustled over to take my arm again, her sharp teeth showing in a smile.  

“If you die, can I eat your brains?”   

That was unsettling however she was a friend so why should I turn down her request?  

“Share them with your brother.” I told her.  

Evie wished me luck with pity in her voice. I was already starting to regret my decision. Turns out Evie knew the one who assigned out tasks. She quickly swept the women away the pair instantly started talking about a new bubble tea place. I got jealous of them.  

The rest of us were left behind. We awkwardly stood waiting for someone to talk first. I took the hit and introduced myself and the stubborn siblings.  

“This is Moss and I’m Jessie.” The short woman said with a bright smile.  

Her voice sounded overly friendly. She gave me the impression that she was forcing a preppy personality. The man beside her made a small annoyed sound. He twitched when a flux of power tightened the black ring around his neck for a split second like a shock collar.  

“You don’t seem like a Moss.” I said with an uncomfortable feeling starting in my stomach. 

Supernatural creatures normally did have a lot of basic names however something about the pair caused some doubt. Jessie looked familiar even though we had never met. I squinted and it clicked in my head she had similar features to Evie.  

“He doesn’t want humans to know his real name. Moss is a good enough nickname for him.” Jessie explained.   

I took the hint to drop it.  

“Are you and Evie related?” I asked moving on.  

“Oh yes. Distant cousins. We’re one of the rare humans who has the power to create extremely binding collars.”  

I hadn’t done that much research into Evie’s family. I wasn’t even sure what her last name was. I knew she had to be decently well-controlling magic if she could handle keeping the collar on August and April. From what I heard April had recently been transferred over to her because they got along so well. And that was just the two supernatural creatures under her care that I knew about.   

Since none of us wanted this day to go on for any longer we headed towards the not-so-hidden door that led to an underground lab. Hunters created these places fairly often. I had no idea where they got the funds for it. They studied anything from supernatural creatures to viruses that might be used to kill any monster it came into contact with. I’ve dealt with at least five or six labs that created monsters as weapons only to fall into ruin. It’s always the same thing. The Hunter deny they were the ones who made the labs and then put Agents or Contract Workers at risk cleaning up their mess when it all goes wrong.  

Inside was the run-of-the-mill three-floor research building. The top floor had abandoned offices with destroyed computers and shredded paper left behind. The second floor would be a larger area where they stored whatever samples they would be studying. And the third floor was always a not-so-secret lab where everything went wrong.  

We mostly ignored the first floor. Any bodies of the workers had already been taken away. Blood stains of where they were killed were left behind. From the smell of things, it had been a few days since this lab was taken over. Thick vines had grown through parts of the hallways. It took me a few minutes to notice dark moss growing in the sticky dried piles of blood.   

I bent down to touch it trying to see if it felt any different than normal moss. April gave me a disgusted look and August handed me some wet wipes to clean my hands with.  

Since we found nothing useful on the first floor, we went down a long stairwell to the second floor. It would be harder to find the entrance to the third last floor. August and April thankfully didn’t start bickering. Jessie stayed in the back of our group checking her nails and showing off how little she wanted to be there.  

“You’re human right?” She asked me and it drew my attention away from the large dark room filled with overturned computer desks.  

August started looking at the leftover sheets of paper trying to find any interesting reports. Moss had stayed silent the entire time only moving when we did.  

“I am.” I answered her trying to avoid a conversation.  

I found it odd we were even here. Why make four people look through a lab that appeared cleaned out already? I didn’t see any signs of a threat still here. Jessie didn’t catch my hint and kept talking.  

“I heard you helped out in a job some Agents died on a recently. I never caught your last name. What family are you from?” She had slid over and carefully took my arm to flutter her eyelashes hoping I would fall for her charm.  

Now I knew why she wanted to talk to me. There was a great deal of human Contract Workers but the ones who lasted the longest belonged to a well-known family. There were families like Evie’s that had one special ability and were neutral. They worked for both The Corporation and The Hunters. August might have been passed around between Hunters before Evie’s family bought him. Supernatural creatures could become collared if they made some sort of deal. From what I heard that was what happened and most likely Evie’s family wasn’t the ones who leashed him.  

If I was from a highly respected family skilled with magic Jessie wanted to cozy up with me. If she married into a powerful family that meant less work if she had a kid, she could semi-retire.  

“I’m not special. I was just born with slightly better magic control than others.” I told her and took my arm back.  

She raised her eyebrow appearing a bit annoyed as if I was lying to her. For some odd reason, even April glanced over as if she didn’t fully believe what I said. I wanted to drop the topic. A loud banging interrupted our conversation and it made us focus back on the task at hand.   

The not-so-hidden door to the third floor was broken down by a raging creature. It tossed the steel door across the room aiming for the weakest target which was Jessie. I grabbed her at the last second to drag her to the ground. She cried out alive but not happy. Since Jessie had been attacked Moss moved to protect his Handler.  

He was faster than the crazed creature that charged into the room. His hands turned into thick branches that easily tore into the flesh of the figure. Green thick blood gushed from the wound, the liquid turning into moss as it dried. The person had been made up of vines with glowing blue eyes that flickered out after Moss forced a claw into its stomach. The vines shriveled up, then crumbled away revealing a small frail person underneath. Their pale skin clung to their bones and oddly enough they appeared happy for a split second before falling limp.  

I watched Moss carefully take hold of them and place the small body on the floor. The air caught in my throat when I realized why the four of them had been picked out for this job. 

“Go clean up the last floor so we can get out of here.” Jessie ordered before I could stop her.  

“No! Don’t let him go down there!” I shouted as I started running between desks. 

He was too fast. We left Jessie behind not matter how much she complained. August didn’t understand what was going on but he knew I wanted to get to stop Moss. Even though he picked me up so we could move faster we didn’t catch up.  

He practically flew down the stairs manhandling me with April following behind. Moss already reached the third floor, his hand deep in the chest of an already half-dead creature. A creature that had the same mossy hair as him.  

The room was large and filled with destroyed equipment and bodies. Some were half-formed with vines, others looked like normal people half starved to death with leaves or moss for hair.   

August put me down and I ran over to grab hold of Moss’s arm trying to keep him from attacking the last living person. My hand touched his neck only to be blasted back with a spark of powerful magic. His collar was tighter than April’s had been. It had an iron grip on him. He couldn’t move or speak in a way his handler disliked. April at least had enough freedom to joke around and choose things like what to wear or what to eat.  

Jessie finally got down the stairs out of breath complaining the entire way. I hadn’t let go of Moss’s wooden arm. He stood still staring at the bodies around the room. His face frozen in a silent rage pressing against his collar wanting to explode.  

“Ugh it smells terrible down here. If everything is dead let’s torch the place and get out of here. I have other plans for today.” She said dismissing the horrors around us.  

If April and August didn’t also have collars, I bet they would toss out a few choice words at this woman. They glared at her silently letting their feelings be known.  

“The creatures that are here... They’re the same species as Moss, right?” I asked slowly.  

Jessie didn’t appear to care in the slightest. She checked her phone to see no signal. Since she had nothing better to do, she answered my question.  

“They were, I dunno, part of the same village or something. Living out in the woods together. Since they needed to take over dead human bodies to live my family gathered them all up. Why not? They were a threat. We kept Moss cause he was the strongest and sold the rest. How were we supposed to know where they ended up? I don’t see why we needed to clean up this mess.” 

I found myself crossing the room not knowing what I was doing. A white-hot rage filled my chest that blinded me. August and April held me back before I did anything stupid. If they weren’t there, I would have slapped her.  

“What are you so upset about? They were only plants.” Jessie shrugged.   

I was going to curse her out when I suddenly felt a burst of heat at my back. Magic crackled through the air so intensely that we all needed to step away from it. Moss stood stock still, a murderous gaze burning through the white sparks coming from his chest. Power strained against the collar on his neck as he fought with everything he had to break it. This woman made him kill the last of his family after they had been tortured. No one would blame him for lashing out. But I needed to stop him.  

“Don’t-” I shouted only to get knocked back by another burst of heat.  

I’ve heard rumors of this happening but I’ve never seen it in person before. Each supernatural creature has an internal magic source. Once that source runs dry, they die. How powerful they are depends on how much magic they hold. Only on very rare occasions, a weaker creature could temporally become a thousand times stronger. Their internal magic becomes unstable. The power leaks out, becoming a deadly force impossible to contain. Sometimes the creature can control it enough to create miracles. All rules and logic related to magic are tossed aside whenever someone goes far enough to burn up their soul.  

That was what it looked like to me. A blinding white flame of pure heat and rage engulfed Moss, his black collar burning away within seconds. Jessi was too stunned to move. I yelled at Moss to stop as if it wasn’t already too late. The flames made my eyes water and burned my fingertips which got too close.   

He lashed out at Jessie first. A long vine shot out stabbing into her chest. Within a second she was covered in the white flames that quickly spread to the walls next to her.   

August knew we needed to get out of there. Jessie had been standing in the only doorway that was now burning. He dragged us to a wall. With the tip of his claw, he scratched a crude rectangle that would be our way out. He didn’t have a key on hand so instead she shoved his clawed hand into the wall pouring magic to create a spell. He didn’t have enough power to go very far. My guess was he aimed to connect this makeshift door to the main lab entrance to get us at least three floors above the flames. A small spark landed on his shoulder instantly burning away part of his shirt and flesh. He didn’t notice. He just opened the connection and shoved us through.  

At the same time, we went through the door, Moss’s magic exploded. He destroyed the door that had just been used. I’ve never heard of someone being stuck between connections. If we were a millisecond slower, I don’t know what would have happened. The spell got scrambled and it caused us to be spit out a few feet off the ground outside the lab. Landing on the forest floor hurt but I was glad we ended up where we did.  

A sea of white flames tore through the entire lab. It shot up into the sky setting the trees ablaze. April screamed and huddled down with her hands over her head trying to stay away from the fire. She was an insect so naturally she hated flames. The fact these were made of pure magic would put anyone on edge. A long shape burst out of the ground, rolling in the sky with a loud roar that shook us down to the bones.  

Moss had transformed into a fiery wingless dragon. His head was made up of twisted branches and vines with the rest of his body the pure white dangerous flames. Soon they burned away revealing a long shimmering form composed of different colored leaves. His internal magic was still going crazy. I couldn’t judge how long he had left. Maybe ten minutes at the most. 

I watched him tear through the sky, swooping down to rip trees out of the soil. He was lashing out at anything alive. Yes, I was scared to death of him and what he became. But at the same time, I felt a deep sadness at what happened. He could have used the power he gained by burning his soul to transform into anything. Why did he become a dragon?  

Because they look cool. It was such a simple childish action that didn’t match the rage he displayed.  

I grabbed hold of April to get her to move. I had an office key in my pocket to get us out of there but no doorway to use. We didn’t have time to think. Moss noticed us through the trees. He wasn’t in his right mind anymore. Anything alive was an enemy. Moss only had a short while to live and he planned on causing as much damage as possible.  

With such a terrifying beast coming down on us we didn’t have that many options. April was so scared she froze. The heat and rage coming from Moss were enough to tear through anything nearby. Behind us stood two trees with a branch reaching out between them. It was good enough to use as a doorway. August stood in front, his human face burning away. Long dark claws ripped through his skin ready to defend against a monster he had no chance at beating.  

I turned on my heel dragging April toward the trees. My body felt heavy as we moved. It hurt so much to turn my back on a friend. I knew this was what he wanted. August would do anything to keep his little sister alive.  

I shoved the key out and turned it. An uneven connection was made. A blast of heat and magic hit us so hard that we ended up rolling into the office through the doorway. April crashed into a desk hard enough to knock it over. We were a few feet away and I had let go of the key. I needed to grab hold of it again to remove it to close the connection. I rolled back to my feet only to have something come flying through the doorway to knock me back to the ground. Carefully I pushed August off, his chest still smoking from the burst of magic and body limp. He was alive but badly injured.   

April got up and dragged him further into the office just in time. Moss’s large head shoved its way through the door, his body getting stuck for the moment. His deadly jaws snapped at our feet, eyes glowing a deep blue narrowed in hatred.  

My mind raced. He thrashed hard enough to create cracks along the doorway. If he broke the connection, it would cause an explosion that could kill us. If he somehow got through, we were dead. Simple as that. And he could rip through the office killing anyone inside for a few minutes until he burned out. Or he could shoot a blast of magic that would destroy whatever was nearby, like us.   

I heard a woman scream. A dark-haired office worker bravely rushed over to help April. Because I opened this doorway, I might be the cause of her death. Who else was in the office? Klaus? Was he strong enough to live through this? Lupa might be but he would never put himself in danger. No matter how hard I tried to think, there was only one option.  

April screamed at me to stop when she saw what I was doing. I ran toward the doorway dodging teeth long enough to touch the connection. Moss turned his head to sink his jaws deep down into my stomach. The wind was knocked out of me. I thought I might die from the pain and yet I pushed on. I focused on looking at the thousands of threads that made up the spellwork. If I found the right one and cut off the connection properly it would be like gently closing the door. No explosion. That was a hard thing to do with a set of teeth grinding at my internal organs.  

I pushed harder getting lost in the sea of threads. My eyes watered and they felt like they would burst. The pain in my head overtook the feeling in my stomach. All at once things around me snapped.  

I found myself standing alone in an empty office. The silence was the most frightening thing I ever experienced. I strained my eyesight so much I broke it. At that moment I could not interact with the supernatural. All magic was gone from my life. I could have walked away. The wound in my stomach had been caused by a creature that no longer existed to me. If I accepted that, I could have lived a normal life. Something my mother always wanted for me and knew I could never have.  

To hell with that. I wasn’t going to live if that meant leaving a mess behind for the people I cared about. I reached out grabbing a hold of an invisible thread. All at once the teeth came back, all the noise and the horrors that a life involved in magic hit me at once. I refused to back down. I just needed to close off this spell.  

The connection snapped shut cutting off Moss’s head from his body. His magic faltered. He didn't remove his jaws. I felt the strength fade from my limbs. Slowly I leaned down to rest against the head of the creature that was going to take my life. A pool of blood flowed down from the wounds to my feet. It felt warm. I was so damn tired. I wanted to sleep. Slowly I found myself petting the rough skin as if Moss was a cute dog and not a wild beast. Faintly a thought came to mind. I wanted to know what Moss’s real name was. It was a shame he would die without it being known.  

My eyes refused to open. A scent that reminded me of a summer field came over my senses. If this was the afterlife it wasn’t too bad. A faint whisper came in the air. It was a word I couldn’t pronounce. It sounded like a warm breeze which calmed my heart and yet, felt a little sad at the same time.  

I should have died. I should have died a lot of times by now. This was the first time I opened my eyes again with them wet with tears.   

When a supernatural creature burns up their soul for power they can go against all rules and logic of magic. Like healing someone from an almost sure death.  

My clothing had been trashed. A fresh set we set next to me for when I woke up. I wasn’t in the medical room in the office. Instead, I was on a cot in the room where I normally made reports. With some effort, I changed and then sat at the table. I wanted to get up to see if August and April were alright. My body simply refused to move..   

The door opened. Klaus walked inside; his dress shirt half tucked in. He must have been called into the office on short notice. I expected him to be angry. Instead, he placed a hand on my shoulder.   

“Is everyone ok?” I asked my voice hoarse.  

“Yes. August is resting. I know you’re tired however, I need you to do something for me.”  

I was too weak to refuse. He took my hand to place it against his chest. I was confused and then suddenly was tossed into a sea of magic similar to how it looked as I tried to find the spell threads of the doorway. Soon I realized that Klaus had opened up to let me see his internal magic source. It was deep. He may be one of the strongest people I met if not one of the top strongest within The Corporation. Something inside that sea started to take shape. A word? No, a sound. I clued into what he wanted to show me. 

I drew back in a panic. I gasped in the air, hands shaking. My vision returned to see him smiling normally as if he hadn’t done something humans didn’t have the proper words to describe.  

“That was... we’re not close. Why did you almost show me your True Name?”  

I felt almost dirty. I pressed my hand against my chest trying to stay away from him. A True Name was something so important to a supernatural creature that if someone knew it, they could completely control them. Most creatures could spend their entire lives not letting it be known. There should be no reason why Klaus would ever share it with me. 

“Richmond, was your mother’s maiden name Doherty?” He asked avoiding my questions.  

It felt like I was sinking down into the chair from such a simple question. It was just a last name. One that my mother ran from for her entire life. I’ve changed my last name so many times and yet I never forgot the one she made me promise to never use.  

“How...” My throat became too dry to speak.   

I suddenly regretted asking him to elaborate. I wanted to get out of the room and far away from what Klaus would say next.  

“A European Hunter family has been using the name Doherty. There was a rumor a woman fled the family while pregnant a few years back.” He said in an even tone trying not to upset me.  

It was as if the walls started to close in. Suddenly I was forced to face the facts I’d been denying my entire life.   

A Hunter family was different from the Hunter organization. The Hunter group would take in any human who hated supernatural creatures and would toss away their life to kill them. A Hunter family had the same goals however they would do anything to achieve them.   

They selectively had children with who had the most desirable traits. From the moment they were born would be raised to hunt down monsters. Hunter families were made up of strict traditions that created living weapons.   

I was stupid to ever let myself assume my sight was just an accident. That any human could have this kind of control over magic without generations of effort. My mother did everything she could to leave that life behind. She always told me my father was a random one-night stand. How true was that? Was it her choice or her family's choice to get pregnant?   

I couldn’t breathe. I got to my feet; a wheezing sound came any time I inhaled. I had come from a family line that slaughtered thousands if not more supernatural creatures. Not just the dangerous ones but innocent people just because they weren’t fully human. If anyone knew my true bloodline, they would rightfully hate me. I was no better than the ones who sold Moss’s family to the Hunters. No, where I came from was worse.  

“I’m not-” I choked out to Klaus as panic took over.  

Did he think I kept this all a secret on purpose? That I took a job as a Contract Worker to take down The Corporation from the inside? Anyone who found out about my real last name would never trust me.  

“Hey, it’s fine. Sit down for a minute.” He was gentle and carefully got me back in the chair. 

No matter how hard I tried I just couldn’t get enough air in my lungs. I felt his hand on my back. With some effort he got me to drink some water.   

“I don’t believe you have anything to do with that family. You had a chance to see my True Name. You refused. In case you haven’t noticed, I’m a bit of a big deal. Having control over my power is more than any Hunter could ever hope to accomplish.”  

I finally calmed down enough to think clearly. He was right. If I had his True Name I could either do a great deal of damage to The Corporation or kill him. His death would be a massive blow on its own. In general, the Hunter families played nice with The Corporation and worked with them to defeat end-of-the-world threats. If they had the strength to take over, then the Hunters would do so in a heartbeat.  

“You seem a bit overconfident.” I said trying to make a joke to lighten the mood.  

“No, just stating facts.” He replied with a smile.  

When you were as strong as him, you were able to say those kinds of things. Klaus took a sharp inhale through his scarred lips and carried on.   

“I fully trust you and I’ll make that known. I won’t tell a soul what family you’re related to however a few rumors have started. No regular human should have the power you do. Hunter families have hurt a great deal of Agents and Contract Workers. That has caused blind hatred. No matter what I say, or what you do, some will not see past something as minor as a last name.”  

I sank into the chair letting those words roll around for a minute. There would be no avoiding the rumors. He would do his best to keep them under control but I’d cut off a doorway spell. I’ve never heard of anyone shutting a spell down without backlash. And what about the family I came from? If they heard about this they may come to try and take this power for themselves. I might be too far gone for them to fully control but they may do other things to try and use me to create a desired offspring. All of this was a mess.   

The door opened as April interrupted our conversation.   

“You better not be making out in here. Richie is taken.” She hissed at Klaus.  

I was glad she was protective of me even though her concern was misguided. Klaus laughed off her comment and then went to a mini fridge in the corner. He pulled out three small containers of ice cream to hand to her.  

“Go see how your brother is doing.” He told her.  

Our conversation was done. I stood up unsure of what my future would be like from now on. He needed to make some reports and talk to some very powerful people about what he learned. I followed behind April to the medical room, my pace slowing to a stop. She noticed and waited for me to speak up.  

“If I tell you something, can you keep a secret?” I asked her.   

“Depends.” She said slowly.  

Even though that was her answer I knew I could trust her.  

“I’m from a Hunter family.” I said my nerves on edge waiting for her response.  

There was a chance she would find out the truth after the rumors started to spread. I didn’t want her to think I was hiding things from her.  

“Well, duh.” April shrugged and carried on.  

For a moment a weight was lifted from my chest. It was obvious to everyone but myself that I just wasn’t normal. She still cared about me regardless of that. We didn’t speak again until we arrived at the small medical room. August was resting in a bed. His chest was so still it worried me.  

April sat in a chair beside him, her knees tucked up and her bare feet on the chair. She handed two of the small ice-creams and kept one for herself but didn’t start eating. August looked terrible. His internal magic source was weak. It would take him months to fully recover from this. I feared he could be tossed right back into a job too soon. To The Corporation he was just a resource they bought and could use up. 

“This is my fault. August was the strongest in our village and now look at him.” April said in a small voice that didn’t suit her at all.  

I wanted to refuse that statement but I knew it would just upset her.  

“What happened?” I asked.  

She took a few minutes to respond and collect her words.  

“Humans wanted our mountain for a ski resort. We were told ahead of time and we could have left. We had lived and died there for generations. We just couldn’t leave behind our land and the ones we buried on the mountain. The humans hired Hunters and then waited until August was away from the village. By the time he came back, everyone had been killed except for me. He knew how valuable he was alive. In exchange for my life, he let that collar be placed around our necks.”  

I listened to her speak then offered my hand for her to take. Tears came to her eyes that she tried to hide by pressing her face into her knees.  

“If died sooner he wouldn’t have to go through all this. Or if I wasn’t born in the first place... I screamed at him to let me die on that mountain with everyone else. Why didn’t he listen to what I wanted for once in his stupid life?”   

This had been what tore them apart after their family had been killed. April saw what August went through and she blamed herself. Deep down she didn’t think she deserved to be saved so she went so far as to say he was dead to her. Creating distance between them had been easier than facing her feelings.  

“Sometimes big brothers need to be the bad guy. It's our job.”  

August had woken up while she spoke. He weakly sat up, his face pale and bags under his eyes. He was wearing a loose shirt that showed his insect-like body. Only his human face returned. It would take a bit longer for him to recover enough to be able to fully transform back into a human disguise.   

April’s face turned red. She sputtered trying to think of something to say to him. Instead, she threw her ice cream container at his face and stormed off. She wasn’t the best at expressing her emotions. Maybe someday she would figure it out. I found some napkins to help August clean off the melted ice cream from his hair and let him lay back down.  

He weakly thanked me for taking care of her. He asked about Moss sounding like he could barely stay awake. I didn’t tell him much of what happened. Only everything turned out fine and no one died when we got into the office. I reached out to take his cold hand with both of my own trying to warm it up. His clawed hands were smooth and sharp. I couldn’t get over how fragile he appeared. How was I ever afraid of him when we first met?  

“I need to tell you something.” I told him. 

August kept his eyes closed but he nodded. 

“I’m from a Hunter family. They use the last name, Doherty. I honestly wasn’t trying to hide that from everyone I just... I didn’t want to accept it.” 

I expected him to pull away. He lost everything because of some hired Hunters. One of my family members might have been the ones who destroyed his village.  

“That’s a silly last name. You would think they would use something more menacing. It makes them sound like they punch dough for a living.” August said, his voice weak.  

I laughed. I couldn’t help myself. A mixture of emotions hit me so hard that I leaned down to rest my head against the bed.   

“I’m scared of becoming a monster.” I softly admitted.  

I had tried so hard to help people. And yet I’ve done nothing but watch August slowly die in front of me every time we worked together.  

“Bad people don’t worry about being a bad person.” He said.  

I lifted my head enough to see a tired dimpled smile.   

I felt terrible he got his ass kicked that day and I was using him for emotional support. I should be letting him rest.   

“Do you want your ice cream?” I offered.  

“Yes. And I want yours too.”  

He did give out some solid advice so I handed it over. I couldn’t do much for him and hanging around for too long would keep August awake. I made sure he was fine before leaving. I walked out through the office pausing to watch people tidy up the area we trashed. If I hadn’t been born with these skills a lot of people would have died today.   

I couldn’t help but think how things would have been different if my mother hadn’t run away or if I hadn’t been born at all. Was she happy with her choices and the life she led? Had I done more harm than good by just being here?   

I left the office not stopping to talk to anyone. I simply had too many thoughts swimming through my head. I wanted to call Ito, to just spend the night and forget things for a while.  My finger hovered over the call button. In the end, I spent the night alone. I knew if I leaned too heavily on him it wouldn’t be good for either of us.   

Things would be changing for me after today no matter how much I wanted it all to stay the same. I just hoped the people I cared about stayed in my life.
