We called it The Factory because no one could remember what it used to be. Grain, people said. Feed. Maybe soy. It sat alone at the end of a road that turned from asphalt to gravel to dirt, like the town itself had run out of nerve halfway there. Four stories of brick the color of old blood, with black eyeholes where glass had been. A metal fire stair zigzagged up the side, clinging there like a spiderweb, and every wind made the treads shiver and sing.

It was about a mile beyond the last ranch house and two beyond the Dairy Queen. The fields around it weren’t corn, not that year; shoulder-high weeds and foxtails, Queen Anne’s lace, milkweed pods split open to fur. The only other building nearby was a low concrete block that used to be an office and now had a roof like a curled lip. A chain-link fence enclosed the lot, but it crouched in the grass and buckled in places where people had crawled under. Somebody had hung NO TRESPASSING signs on it. Somebody else had shot holes in the signs.

We were twelve and thirteen, and the town was a circle of nothing to do. There were five of us most days: me, Jamie, Tyler, Cody, and Hannah. We had bikes and a deck of cards with three queens missing and an old soccer ball that veered left and a set of walkie-talkies that only sometimes worked between the cul-de-sac and the creek. We had empty afternoons two inches deep with heat. We had the factory.

Jamie had the ideas. He didn’t look like a leader in movies. He didn’t have broad shoulders or jawline you could strike a match on. He was wiry and light on his feet and he talked with his hands. He had a grin that made you forget you’d sworn not to do whatever he was suggesting. Tyler followed him everywhere, taller by a head, the kind of kid who did dumb things out of loyalty and then apologized to teachers with his whole face. Hannah was sharp like a new blade; she did things because people told her not to and laughed while she did. Cody was the youngest, soft-cheeked and fast to pretend he wasn’t scared. He chewed his hoodie strings until they were hard little ropes. Me? I wasn’t brave or funny or mean. I don’t really remember how I became friends with the others. Just that one day I woke up and couldn’t remember life before knowing them.

The summer I’m talking about was dry. Dust made a skin on everything. The weeds at the edge of the lot whispered when you walked past, and grasshoppers snapped out of the way in arcs like thrown pebbles. The only shade was the building’s own shadow, cool and thin and not much use unless you moved with it. We liked to go at the end of the day, when the heat was thinking about giving up.

The first time we played manhunt there, we did it because Jamie said the words in the tone that made things inevitable: “You’re all too chicken to play for real.”

“Define ‘for real,’” Hannah said, rolling her eyes.

“Inside,” he said. “Whole place. One person counts, everyone else hides. No roofs. No silos.”

“We’re not going in the silos,” Tyler said, horrified at a danger none of us had actually suggested.

“Obviously,” Jamie said. “First one caught counts next. No crying. No ‘I heard something, you guys.’ You hear pigeons. Or rats. It’s a building.”

He cut the fence where it sagged and we bellied under, one by one, the metal taste of rust in our mouths. The factory door had been welded shut long ago, but other doors had not. The low office had a kicked-out panel on the back. We went in that way, under dangling wires and a strand of yellow tape that had lost its warning words. It smelled like mildew and old work: cardboard, spilled oil, mouse shit. Someone had spray-painted a cartoon dick on the back wall at kid height. Someone else had spray-painted “SAM + CHELLE 1997” in careful bubble letters under a dusty calendar from 1994.

Past the office, a hallway opened onto the main floor and the smell changed. The air had a mineral sting. Dust motes drifted like snow in our flashlight beams; the shafts of light from the broken windows turned them into glitter. The room was an open field of concrete with metal skeletons rising at irregular intervals: frames of machines, hoppers like giant funnels, chutes that angled down into the floor and vanished. A catwalk crisscrossed the higher half of the room, rust drops darkening the floor underneath where it bled. Somewhere a pipe dripped into a metal bucket: ping… ping… ping. Pigeons made cooing sounds that weren’t sweet at all in that empty space.

“Smells like the inside of a penny,” Hannah said.

“It’s sick,” Tyler said, and I couldn’t tell if he meant cool or gross.

We scattered because that’s what you do when a place is too big and you’re trying to act unafraid: you move, make noise, pretend the fear is behind you. Jamie put his hand on the brick beside the door and said, “Sixty. Loud. Ready? One, two, three…” His counting rolled and bounced, filled the place, made it seem both more and less empty.

I grabbed Cody’s sleeve. “This way.”

“Where?” He was trying to make his voice tough. It came out breathy.

“Office upstairs,” I said, though I didn’t actually know if there was one. It seemed like the kind of factory that would have an office upstairs, a little fishbowl to look down at people working. We edged along the wall and ducked into a tangle of old machinery, ducked again under a belly of rusted panels, and found a staircase that took us up through the smell of pigeon shit and sun-warmed metal to a small room with windows that were grease-gray with age.

There was a desk in there, tipped sideways. A rolling chair on its back. A mug cemented to the floor with what had once been coffee, glued there with dust. A calendar curling up at the corners. A jacket on a peg, frozen in a hunch. The windows looked down over the main floor like a control booth in a bad movie.

“Perfect,” I said. We slid behind the desk. Cody breathed like he’d run a mile.

A clatter of feet on metal made us flinch. Tyler on the catwalk, moving too fast. A pigeon shot across our window, close enough that I saw the gleam of its eye.

“Twenty-seven… twenty-eight…” Jamie’s voice floated up. It made my skin run cold even though his tone was bored. The bored tone is how you know boys are going to do something stupid. They have to act like nothing could possibly happen.

Cody grinned at me, a quick flash of teeth. The grin said all the things this game was supposed to say: I am not scared. I am with my friends. This is ours.

Footsteps sounded in the hallway outside our little office, slow and soft. They weren’t on the catwalk, and they weren’t running. They had a weight to them that made me imagine boots. They stopped just past the doorway. I held my breath. Cody held his. I could hear something else: a breath, faint and steady, not mine.

I leaned to the crack at the desk’s edge, just an inch, enough to see a sliver of the doorframe and the rectangle of the hall beyond. There was nothing there. Empty concrete. A peeled stripe of paint.

The breath didn’t go with the empty hall. It was close and not close. Cody’s eyes asked, Do you hear that? Mine said, Don’t move.

“Ready or not,” Jamie yelled, “here I come!”

The slow breath paused. The footsteps moved away, unhurried, and vanished into the general noise of a building settling into itself.

“Probably Hannah,” Cody mouthed.

“Probably,” I mouthed back, even though Hannah didn’t walk like that. She had a hop to her and an impatience that telegraphed itself in little toe-taps. These steps felt like someone who didn’t have to hurry anywhere.

Jamie took too long to find us because he found Tyler first. Tyler is too tall to hide and too honorable to cheat. After a while a hand grabbed the back of my shirt and yanked and I yelped and it was Hannah, grinning, triumphant. “Get your asses up, you turtles,” she whispered. “You coming?”

“We heard someone,” Cody blurted.

“You heard me,” she said, and rolled her eyes in a way that made the whole idea of the breath feel like something embarrassing I’d invented to be interesting. We let her pull us out into the hallway, and the echo of our sneakers overran the echo of anything else.

We played two more rounds that evening. I got found fast because I’m not good at standing still. The pigeons went off every time anyone moved too fast. The light slanted and turned the dust gold, then copper, then the kind of brown you get on the bottoms of your feet when you play outside all day. Cody hid behind a stack of wooden pallets that looked like teeth, then in a half-open chute that I made him get out of because “you’ll get stuck and we’ll all have to explain it to someone with a clipboard”.

We left at sunset, drunk on dust and triumph. There was a smear of rust on Cody’s cheek like war paint. Hannah had pigeon crap on her sleeve and didn’t know it. Jamie hopped the fence with a cocky little pike-kick. Tyler went over awkwardly and then reached back to pull me through because I got my shirt snagged on a curl of wire.

“Again tomorrow,” Jamie said, because he didn’t know how not to push a thing until it gave way.

“Again tomorrow,” we said.

I remember that ride home in the blue hour like a photograph someone left in the sun: us arrowing down the road in a ragged line, the factory falling behind us and coming along anyway in the ringing in my ears, the feeling that everything we’d done had woken something up that had been sleeping.

The second day we brought better flashlights, a disposable camera, and snacks. The camera was a green Kodak with a lever you had to grind your thumb against to move the film. I’d bought it at the gas station with money from mowing Mrs. Rennie’s lawn, planning to use it on the last day of summer before school, photograph the creek and our bikes and our faces making faces. I took a picture of us at the fence, Jamie doing the same kick, Hannah flipping the bird, Tyler looking annoyingly like a yearbook photo even when he was making fun, Cody trying to look tough and failing. That picture still exists. It’s in a shoebox somewhere up high on a closet shelf where I can’t see it by accident.

“Rules,” Jamie said at the office door, suddenly serious. “No roofs. No silos. No going past the orange line.”

“What orange line?” Tyler asked.

Jamie took us inside to the main floor and pointed at a rectangle someone had painted on the concrete around a big metal cabinet and a cluster of tanks. The paint had faded to the color of cheddar cheese past its date. The line had words by each corner: DANGER / DO NOT ENTER / LOCKOUT / and a fourth line that pigeons had decorated beyond reading.

“You don’t cross the line,” Jamie said. “You can hide behind stuff near it, but you don’t go in there, and you don’t go down the hatch if it’s open.”

“How do you know there’s a hatch?” Hannah said, hair in her eyes, tone full of dare.

“Because my cousin worked here before it closed,” he said. “He said they dropped things into pits and ground them up. Like,” he made his hand into a blender. “You fall into a hopper, no one hears you except the guy who has to fill out the safety form.”

“Gross,” Cody said, half-admiring.

We played. We were louder than we meant to be and quieter than we thought we were, the way kids are. The building made everything both. Our voices warped around corners. Our footsteps split and rejoined. The wind outside made the stair squeal and the squeal came from everywhere. We scattered and found each other again in pockets of shadow, grinning. 

The first round, Hannah counted loudly while chewing gum, and I thought: her gum doesn’t pop like that. The sound was off somehow, sticky where hers is crisp. But I didn’t see anyone else chewing when I peeked. Second round, Tyler counted, and while he was at “twenty-nine… thirty…” a door down the far hall swung shut with a soft kiss even though no one was in that direction.

Third round, it was my turn to count, and when I got to fifty everyone was gone and my voice sounded small. That’s when I noticed the chalk marks.

They were low on the wall near the baseboard in the hall by the old offices, near where the light from a window made a pale rectangle. Five sets of hash marks clustered together, each with a name scratched in kid handwriting between: J /T / S/ H/ C. The sixth said E. 

Five of us and E. 

“Guys?” I called, too loud. It came out like a question. “Jamie?”

The stair on the far side clanked with someone’s foot where it shouldn’t have. Cody skittered by at the end of the hall, saw me looking, made a face like I was already caught. Somewhere higher up, a pigeon batted itself into a window again and again with a stupid thump. The chalk marks waited. I touched them, and chalk came off on my finger that felt new, not decayed and powdery. We hadn’t made them. Someone else had, recently.

“Ready or not,” I said, and took my own advice.

I found Tyler behind an overturned conveyor belt. I found Hannah sitting cross-legged behind an array of pipes, chewing gum that clicked sharp on the roof of her mouth. I found Jamie by the loading dock, tucked between the buckled rubber bumper and the cinderblock like a cat. We counted again, swapped roles, fanned out, came back. The afternoon thickened and the light came in sideways and at a certain point Cody didn’t answer when we called his name to give up.

“Hiding too good,” Jamie said, trying to be impressed.

“Cheating,” Hannah said, trying to be annoyed.

“Cody!” Tyler bellowed. It turned into three syllables, more a sound than a word.

No answer. Not a giggle. Not the scuff of shoes. Not a pigeon thump. The building leaned in like it was holding its breath with us.

We spread wider. We checked stupid places: inside the old metal cabinets full of nothing, behind the tipped desk upstairs where I’d thought we were clever, inside the little bathroom whose stall doors had been kicked off but still felt private, like you should knock. I felt the kind of trembling I associate now with low blood sugar and then thought was fear or excitement. We yelled and the yelling made a shape that seemed impossible not to be heard.

We found his backpack sitting open behind a stack of pallets near the orange line. Inside: a warm Capri Sun, his inhaler, a handful of Skittles melted into a smear, a pen he’d chewed to death, the other end of his hoodie string that wasn’t yet a rope. That’s when the fear stood up and took its coat off.

“He wouldn’t leave his bag,” Tyler said. He sounded like he was practicing talking to an adult later.

“Cody!” Jamie’s voice cracked on the second syllable. He didn’t look at any of us while it did.

“Maybe he went outside to pee,” Hannah said, but it didn’t sound like she believed it and it didn’t sound like a joke, either.

We did the thing you do when you’re kids and you’ve made a mistake big enough to see: we panicked badly and then tried to be sensible. We agreed to meet back at the office door in five minutes. We each took a floor, moving too fast, catching ourselves, moving too slow. I went down, to the lowest level, to the place where the concrete sweated and the standing water in the middle of the floor had a skin on it. The pipes down there had insulation that hung off like rotten fur. There was more graffiti down there that wasn’t dicks or initials. Letters in a different hand: little neat block capitals that said QUIET HOURS and CLEAN MONDAY and names and times that read like a work schedule and a map to a life I didn’t want to picture. Above a rusted sink someone had written, in that neat hand, NO ODORS. Underlined. Three times.

There was a bedroll by the far wall. A real one. Zippered black nylon, laid on top of cardboard, with a folded blanket and a hat sitting on the blanket like a person had put it there with care. Next to it: a grocery bag I recognized from the cheap store in town, with the corner of a loaf of bread peeking out. A plastic laundry line stretched between two pipes with a shirt draped over it to dry. The shirt had missing buttons but had been washed and rung out and hung with equal pieces on each side like someone for whom symmetry was a kind of dignity.

Next to the bedroll, in a neat line: five cigarette butts lined parallel to the wall. Not thrown, not crushed. Arranged.

I went stiff, like my bones had opinions. I felt seen from the back. I wanted to turn around and look behind me and at the same time not turn around because if I didn’t see it then it wasn’t there. The air down there was colder than it should have been in a summer afternoon. Not cold like air conditioning but cold like air that had spent a long time pressed against stone.

“Guys,” I said to the room, and I meant our faces and I meant the ones we hadn’t met. “Guys.”

When I moved, something moved with me. A shadow invented by before and after, my own shoulder catching my own light. I walked backwards to the stairs, then ran up them, then forced myself to stop and walk so I could breathe. At the main floor, I ran.

Jamie was already at the office door, white where he wasn’t sunburned. Hannah came up with her mouth set tight, hands dirty. Tyler didn’t come at all; we had to go find him, and he was in the hall by the chalk marks, rubbing them with his thumb hard enough to grind dust into his skin like he was trying to erase. “Those weren’t here yesterday,” he said like a prayer. “Those weren’t here.”

We went outside. I know that sounds like giving up. It wasn’t. It was a need as physical as thirst. The light stabbed our eyes and made the world look too bright, too flat, like we’d come in from underwater. 

Jamie held onto the fence post and put his head down. 

Hannah said, “If he’s hiding as a joke I’m going to kill him.” 

Tyler counted us under his breath: one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. His mouth shaped the numbers like they were a spell.

We yelled Cody’s name in the weeds and it wavered in the heat. We called into the office. We called at the loading dock. We called at the door to the stairwell that goes to the roof even though the rule was no roofs. The building hummed like it did not care about rules or names.

When we went back in, the orange line was different. It had been broken near one corner, a chip out of the paint you wouldn’t have noticed unless you were looking for how the world changes when you’re not in it. The metal cabinet within the line had a lock on it with the loop pried open. I could see the silver brackets bent slightly. There were scuffs on the concrete from something being dragged. Next to those scuffs: a smear of dirty water from a wet shoe.

My foot lined up next to it. Mine small in my head, Cody smaller in my head - this other shoe print wrong. The tread had a boxy shape, a little square in the heel like a stamp. None of us had soles like that.

“Okay,” Jamie said. “Okay. Okay.” He was saying it the way people say I’m fine when they’re bleeding. “We go get help. We go now.”

He ran. We followed. We left Cody’s backpack because we had this stupid idea about leaving a place the way you found it so you didn’t get in worse trouble than you were already in; that’s the kind of thinking that tells you how old we were. We ran for the road, for the bitey gravel and then the softer shoulder and then the hot asphalt that radiated through our soles. Jamie biked so fast he almost ate it twice. Hannah sprinted and then got a stitch and bent double and swore at herself and ran anyway. Tyler trotted like a good machine. I kept trying to go faster and my legs kept reminding me I had no more go faster in me.

By the time we got to the first house on the edge of town, a ranch with a kid’s plastic mower in the yard and a faded flag, my throat tasted like pennies and bile. A woman with sun-weathered arms opened the door and frowned at us like we were a raccoon she hadn’t decided whether to feed or chase.

“There’s-” Jamie said, and then had to stop and bend and put his hands on his knees not to puke. It didn’t work.

“Inside,” she said, instantly changing shape. “Inside now.”

Police came. Parents came. The factory that afternoon was a done-up version of itself: grown-ups in vests, a van with its hazards blinking, the sound of radios making everything more real and less immediate at once. I stood under a tree at the edge of the lot and watched strangers walk through the holes in the building I already knew and wished I didn’t. 

An officer named R. Spencer, according to her name tag, crouched to look me in the face and asked me to say everything from the beginning. I told her about the chalk marks and the bedroll and the cigarettes lined up and the orange line and the shoe tread and the breath outside the office the day before. 

They looked. They yelled his name the way we had, like names are nets you can throw over a person and bring them back. They shook their heads at things only grown-ups shake their heads at. Codes, liability, the right papers to force locks. They did force the bent lock, eventually. The metal cabinet had electrical switches inside, long handles with tags that said things like FEED AUGER 3 and EMERGENCY STOP. I saw a man touch one with his pen and then record something in a book on a little shelf. I saw another man take a camera out and photograph a smear that the rest of us had not seen yet: a faint brown line on concrete, dragged and then broken, then dragged and then stopped. The pigeons went wild when the flash went off.

They took us home when the light started to go, because you have to take kids home. Cody’s mother stood in her yard in a T-shirt and pajama pants and cried loud, the kind of loud that makes neighbors look away and then look back because that sound is a public event. Nobody told her to stop. Cody’s father was a block of a man with a flattened voice who kept saying, “He’ll be in the creek. He’ll have gone to the creek,” like he was going to will the boy into a normal kind of mistake. He had a beer can in his hand that he squeezed without drinking.

We all lied in our own ways about where we’d been. Nobody wanted the other part of the trouble, the trespassing kind. It didn’t hold. In small towns, nothing does. By morning, everyone knew where we had been. By afternoon, the factory had more signs, fresh and bright, plastic and red, barking orders at kids who already knew how to slip under the fence.

There were searches. There were men with sticks poking through the ditches along the road. There were volunteers in neon vests doing a line across the fields like a slowed-down parade. There was a helicopter that hovered for one hour and then left. The sheriff stood on the hood of a truck and spoke through a megaphone and the words “no evidence of foul play” floated over the heads of the adults. Someone put Cody’s school picture on a poster and then a bigger poster and then a whole wall in the gas station. There was a reward. 

If you’re waiting for me to say we found his shoe or his hat or a lamp of bone, I won’t. That’s not the story I have. I have the story where a kid goes in and does not come out, and for the rest of your life your body will look for him every time you see a boy in a hoodie with the strings chewed hard. I have the story where you watch adults take a building seriously for a week and then less seriously and then not at all. The story where the sheriff says into a reporter’s microphone, “we are investigating all possibilities, including that the boy may have run away,” and you feel something rot slowly inside you at the way the word *including* can hold a lie.

After five weeks, the posters got wet around the corners in the night and curled and had to be replaced, and they weren’t. After a year, the factory wore a new padlock like a brooch and half the windows were boarded and someone had painted over the graffiti with square gray patches that made the whole building look like a broken crossword.

We were all changed and not changed. Jamie got meaner and then quiet. Tyler learned how to take tests without thinking about anything else and left for college two years ahead of me. Hannah got a girlfriend, then another, then a boyfriend, and then left for a city and never came back for more than a weekend. I froze whenever I smelled wet cardboard. 

There were things I didn’t say then that I can say now. Two weeks after Cody disappeared, I went back by myself. This is where you shake your head and say, you idiot. I know. I went on a weekday when my mother thought I was at the library and my father was on a long-haul and the heat had broken into a September that felt like a long breath out. The fence had a new repair that sagged differently. I went through it. I went around to the low office and ducked in past the dead strip of sun. I carried the disposable camera in my back pocket because my stupid brain had decided evidence had something to do with light.

It was quieter without the others. The pigeons cooed and shat and cooed some more but they didn’t spook as easily with one set of feet. My own footsteps felt rude. The main floor had the square gray paint. The orange line looked freshly bright again because the sheriff’s department had dusted it for prints and rubbed it dull and someone had come later and decided the thing to do was paint the danger sharper. The neat chalk marks in the hallway were gone. The wall was a chalky smear like a chalkboard badly erased. Over it, someone had spray-painted a bubble tag with a date and a handle I didn’t recognize.

I went down to the low level, because that was what I had not been able to stop thinking about. The air had that stone-cold again. The bedroll was gone. The cardboard had been collected and baled by someone who thought about hazards. The laundry line had a new string, bright nylon with no shirt. The wall over the sink still said NO ODORS, twice, once in the careful hand and once in bigger letters that rounded like a child’s and underlined hard enough to scratch plaster. There were more cigarette butts, but they weren’t in a line anymore. Just a pile.

I took pictures without looking through the viewfinder properly: the sink, the corner where the bed had been, the floor where the bed wasn’t, the pipe. The flash made the whole place strobe and in that instant I saw how the puddle in the center mirrored the ceiling, and how the ceiling had a stain that looked like a hand that looked like water that looked like nothing. The disposable camera whined. I wound it with my thumb until the little red dot in the viewfinder went solid again.

That’s when I heard the voice. Not words but a cough. The wet little cough of someone who doesn’t quite clear their throat because there’s no one to hear if they do. It came from above, from the stair, from the place where the shadow pooled at the angle where the wall met the underside of the steps. Not a footfall. Not a pipe. A sound made by tissue, by meat.

“Hello,” I said into it, because I didn’t know what else to say and I had the sense, like a deer has, that running would be the wrong thing even though walking wasn’t right. “Hello?”

Nothing. Then, not in answer: a soft scrape. The sound of a shoelace being pulled tight against an eyelet.

I stayed where I was and put the camera at my chest and pressed the button. The flash slashed the dark and made the angle under the stair into a picture, and in that picture was a pale coin of a face that might have been only a smudge on the concrete, a shoulder that might have been a beam, and an eye. I know how that sounds. Plenty of people have told me plenty of times that I saw what I came to see. That it was pareidolia, a word with enough syllables to make people feel safe. I took three steps back, then turned, then walked as fast as walking lets you, then ran when I hit the hallway. The building let me go like it hadn’t known I was there in the first place.

Two days later I took the camera to be developed. The clerk gave me a claim ticket and laughed at the outdatedness of it and told me they still did a few rolls a week for weddings and old men who never learned. I came back a week after that when the prints were delayed because the machine had eaten someone else’s negative. When the envelope was finally in my hands I stood outside in the heat and flipped through the pictures and felt stupid and scared in equal measures and then I felt heat rise up my neck under my hair and into my face. Photo one: us at the fence, stupid and easy. Two: Hannah’s gum bubble mid-pop, the gum a weird gray in film. Three: light sliced into the main room, dust like galaxy. Four: a blur from moving too fast on the stair. Five: the hallway with no chalk marks yet, just a smear. Six: the sink with NO ODORS. Seven: the corner where the bed had been. Eight: the angle under the stair.

If I show it to you, you’ll see whatever you come ready to see. Maybe you’ll see a stain on concrete. Maybe you’ll see a dark smudge where the shadow is heavier. Maybe you’ll see the edge where something that has been there a long time meets the place where it hasn’t. If you’re me, you’ll see an eye looking directly at the flash in that stuttering instant, and you’ll imagine the way the dark blooms back in after the flash and how someone standing too close would stay still so as not to scrape their shoelace again.

I told no one. Not because I wanted to keep it. Because I already knew what adults would say, and because the photo doesn’t prove anything except that the building has corners. I put the envelope in the shoebox. I told myself the person who slept there was someone who had been careful to have dignity: clean Monday, no odors, neat cigarettes, a softened bread loaf, a hat. I told myself the running was rude. I told myself all the stories I needed to be the kind of person who could finish high school and turn eighteen and move away.

Years have gone by like they do, in a way where you don’t notice until you do. Cody’s mother moved. His father didn’t. Once, when I was visiting home because a friend’s mother died and you go, whether or not you want to, I saw him at the gas station buying cigarettes and windshield wiper fluid, and he said my name and then stopped like the hand he’d put out was about to touch a stove. “You were there,” he said.

“Yes,” I said. There wasn’t a way to say “I’m sorry” that didn’t sound like “I feel bad,” which wasn’t the point.

He nodded. He paid. He left. The door chimed and chimed and then the station was quiet except for the cooler’s hum.

The factory came down the year after that. Not all at once, the way buildings fall in movies. In pieces, in a long insult. They took the stair first, and the sound of it coming down woke me in my new apartment three miles away even though there was no way the noise could carry. They combed the footprint like a cat burying a thing. They poured a slab. They put up a fence and a sign that said COMING SOON: SELF STORAGE.

I went one last time before it was all gone, because I wanted to see if anything was there that would make any adult say anything new. The fence had a real lock, not the kind you snip with the cheap tool set in a boy’s garage. I walked the perimeter in the evening and watched swifts stitch the sky and listened to insects vibrate their bodies into noise and when I got to the place where the office had been I stopped. There was a square of nothing. Gravel had been raked into new order. And there, half-buried at the edge where the machines had not yet done their work, was a coin.

No, not a coin. A circle from the neck of a plastic bottle. That ring that pops off when you unscrew the cap the first time. It was orange. It made a perfect loop in the dust. Someone had threaded a shoelace through it, the way kids do when they are bored and make talismans. The lace had knots in a pattern I recognized in the stupid way your body recognizes a step pattern at the top of stairs in a dark house. The knots were spaced close together on one side and far on the other. That was the way Cody did them: three, then a thumb’s width, then two, then a thumb’s width, because he’d told me one afternoon it made him feel like he was counting time.

I didn’t pick it up. I didn’t photograph it. This is the part where a stranger reading this will say, it was trash. It was nothing. There were a hundred boys. There were knots at a hundred laces and rings at a thousand caps. I can’t argue with you from here. I didn’t pick it up because I didn’t want to put my hand into the exact space where his might have been. I didn’t want to be wrong in the other direction. I didn’t want to take something that someone had left to say, I was here.

We still played manhunt for a while after that, not there. In someone’s yard, in the new subdivision that smelled like drywall, in the little woods by the creek where water skates zipped like handwriting. We always counted wrong after that. We always counted slow and ended fast. We got bigger and got smaller. We learned to drive. We left and then left more. Now, when friends suggest an urban explore, when someone invites me to an art installation in a warehouse that is beautiful and full of light, I tell them I have a thing and make my voice warm and not sorry. The truth is, I do have a thing. It is a room full of dust and a low ceiling and a voice that coughs once and a shoe that drags only when someone isn’t trying to be quiet.

If you need a moral, I don’t have one. If you need a clean line to draw a circle around the bad thing and make it stop, I can’t hand you that, either. We say we were kids and we didn’t know better. That’s true like most true things: at a slant. We knew the factory was a place where adults told us not to go and we went anyway. We knew cutting a fence is the kind of bad you can brag about. We didn’t know the precise weight of another person’s breath in a corner. We didn’t know how long not knowing can last.

People who read stories like this always ask what you’d do different if you could go back. It’s a dumb question. We always go back, in our heads, and we always do the same thing and sometimes we do it faster. If I’m forced to answer, I’d say: I would have stopped at the office door. I would have looked at Jamie and said, “No game today.” I would have taken the camera home and used it on the creek and a picture of a dragonfly on a shopping cart and our stupid faces. 

I don’t get to do that. I get to put it here and say: there are places that are empty because they are empty, and there are places that are empty because someone has learned to make themselves thin. If you are a kid reading this because you think fear is a thing you can carry like a trophy, it isn’t. It’s a magnet. It will find the iron in any room and pull.

I have the shoebox. I have the picture. I have a knot pattern I can’t untie. I have the smell of pennies when fear peels back the skin of the world and shows you the dark underneath. I have all the reasons you’ll tell me this means nothing and all the reasons I can’t stop hearing a cough under a stair.

That’s my record. That’s my whole story. I hope you don’t ever need one.
