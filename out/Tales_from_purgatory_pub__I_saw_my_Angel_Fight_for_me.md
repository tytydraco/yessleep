I had never before beheld such an expanse of ruinous grandeur, nor had I ever known such terror as when I first stood upon the plateau that marked the edge of Purgatory. The air itself seemed to hum with an unseen resonance, neither sound nor silence, but something in between—a dreadful vibratory force that pressed upon my skull like the weight of an unspoken truth. The sky above was a churning miasma of colorless, shifting light, an oppressive mockery of the celestial sphere.

And before me, poised against the cosmic nightmare that threatened to engulf this forsaken land, was my angel.

I do not know his name, nor have I ever dared to ask. Names, after all, hold power, and I cannot fathom what might occur should I utter his in the presence of the ravenous things that lurk beyond the veil. He has no wings, no luminous countenance to inspire awe—only a presence that exudes something deeper, something primeval, something vast.

The horrors that roil beyond the boundary are without number and without reason, their forms incomprehensible to the human mind. Some slither where there is no ground, their undulating bodies defying gravity’s grasp. Others are great, bulbous things, their membranous flesh pulsing with a nauseating cadence, eyes—if they could be called that—blinking in erratic, impossible sequences. A few are nothing but voids, gaps in reality where existence itself seems to tremble and retreat.

And yet, my angel stands firm.

His form, though humanoid, flickers at the edges, a silhouette against the chaos, as though he exists in a state neither here nor there. A great sigil, ever-changing, writhes upon his chest, shifting through symbols older than the world, sigils of warding and of war. He does not speak.  boundless.

I do not know how long we have been here. Time is meaningless in this place. I do not know if the battle can ever truly be won. All I know is that my angel—nameless, faceless, immutable—stands between me and the abyss, and as long as he does, I am not lost.

But I wonder.

Even angels must tire.

Yet the angel, my silent sentinel, does not falter. He raises his hand once more, and the air crackles with a force that does not merely repel the abominations but unmakes them, casting them back into the void from which they came. The sigils upon his chest blaze with impossible light, shifting and folding into patterns beyond human comprehension. The horrors recoil, but they do not cease their assault.

For they are endless. They are hunger incarnate. And the angel, my angel, is but one.

I feel the weight of the cosmos pressing against this fragile barrier, sense the fraying edges of reality as they claw at its seams. Even as my protector stands unyielding, the thought lingers at the edge of my consciousness, insidious and cold—

What happens when he can stand no more?

The thought festers in my mind like a parasitic growth, its roots burrowing deep into the marrow of my sanity. The things beyond the veil sense my doubt, and I feel their glee—a mirthless, hideous thing that slithers through the void like a whispered blasphemy. They press closer now, an inexorable tide of writhing abomination, their movements a grotesque mockery of life.

The angel does not turn to face me, yet I know he is aware of my fear. The sigil upon his chest pulses, and for a fleeting moment, I feel its warmth against my skin—a reassurance, a promise. But even that comfort is fleeting, devoured by the yawning abyss that encroaches upon this forsaken plateau.

Another monstrosity lunges forward, its shape amorphous yet terrible, a thing of gaping maws and grasping tendrils that undulate with obscene purpose. It moves not through the air but through the very fabric of existence, slipping between realities like a serpent through reeds. The angel raises his hand once more, and the sigils blaze with a light that is not light, a radiance that is instead the assertion of order against the maddening entropy beyond.

The abomination shrieks as its form unravels, dissolving into a miasma of shrieking vapors that dissipate into the ether. Yet even as it perishes, a dozen more emerge from the formless dark, each more terrible than the last.

I clutch at my temples, the pressure of their presence a crushing weight upon my thoughts. They whisper to me now, their voices seeping into my skull like an oil slick upon water. They offer release, knowledge, power—temptations as old as the stars themselves. I know their promises are lies, yet the terror of unending battle gnaws at my resolve.

The angel does not waver. He cannot waver. But I see it now—the flicker, the infinitesimal moment where his sigils dim, the barest hesitation as he raises his hand once more. The forces that seek to devour us have noticed it too. Their gibbering cries rise in a chorus of malice, and the tide of them surges forward with renewed fervor.

The plateau trembles beneath me. Cracks spiderweb across its surface, and through those fissures, I glimpse what lies beneath—not rock or earth, but something else entirely. Something vast and watchful, a thing whose mere awareness is a violation of reality. The plateau is not a place. It is a boundary, a prison. And it is failing.

I turn to the angel, desperation clawing at my throat. "What are you?" I whisper, though I know he will not answer. He never has. He never will.

But this time, he does.

His voice is not sound but a tremor in the fabric of being, a resonance that shudders through my bones and etches itself upon my soul.

"I am the last."

The words settle upon me like a shroud, their weight more terrible than the horrors that surround us. The last. Not the strongest. Not the first. The last.

The plateau trembles once more, and from the depths below, something vast and nameless stirs. The veil is thinning. The boundary is breaking. The angel raises both hands now, and his sigils blaze like dying stars, their radiance burning against the darkness.

But even as he stands, unyielding, I know the truth.

Even angels must fall.

And when he does, I will be alone.

A sound unlike any other erupts from the void, a cacophony of shrieking despair and chittering hunger. The entities beyond the veil sense the weakening of their adversary, and their glee manifests in tremors that ripple across the plateau. I stagger, the very ground beneath me undulating as though something beneath stirs in anticipation.

The angel moves now, a slow and deliberate raising of his arms, and the sigils shift into new configurations, ones I cannot comprehend. The symbols coil and writhe, forming impossible geometries that sear themselves into my vision. For the first time, I see the struggle upon his expressionless face—an exertion beyond anything mortal, an effort to stave off the inevitable.

Yet I feel it, and I know he does too. The tide cannot be stemmed forever.

I do not know how long we have fought here. It could have been hours, years, or an eternity. Time ceases to hold meaning when faced with the infinite. But now, I sense that the conclusion draws near.

Another abomination surges forth, this one different from the others. Its form is shifting, refracting through space like a twisted mirror of reality itself. It moves without moving, existing in multiple places at once. Its eyeless face turns towards the angel, and a sound—neither word nor thought but something in between—emanates from its being.

"You cannot hold forever. You will break."

The angel does not reply. He only raises a hand, and the sigils burn brighter.

The entity shudders as its form contorts, its multitude of existences collapsing into a singularity that is then no more. But I see it now—the cost. The angel's sigils flicker, his stance less steady. The battle is claiming him.

I turn away, unwilling to bear witness to the inevitable. Yet my gaze is drawn downward, to the fissures widening at my feet. From within those black depths, a radiance pulses, but it is not light. It is a hunger more ancient than time, a presence that has slumbered beneath the boundary since before the first star ignited.

The plateau shudders violently. Chasms yawn open, and the abyss hungers. The things beyond the veil know what lies beneath, and they do not fear it—they revere it.

And then, the angel speaks once more.

"You must leave."

I do not know how. I do not know if it is even possible. But his words carry with them an urgency, a force that demands obedience. Yet I hesitate. How can I abandon the only barrier between reality and the chaos beyond?

A sudden shift in the air sends me sprawling. The veil convulses, its fabric tearing as something beyond comprehension forces its way through. The angel stands firm, but I see it—the moment of weakness, the crack in his indomitable presence. He can no longer hold alone.

A choice stands before me—one I do not wish to make. But I know, deep within my marrow, that if I stay, I will perish. And worse—I will become one of them.

The angel's sigils flare with one final burst of brilliance, and I know what he has done. He has given me the only chance I will ever have. A portal—framed in the same burning glyphs that cover his being—flickers into existence behind me.

"Go."

I do not wish to leave him. But I must. I stumble backward through the portal, my vision consumed by its searing light.

And then, silence.

I awaken behind a bar, the scent of aged wood and whiskey filling my nostrils. The dim glow of hanging lamps casts long shadows, and the murmur of indistinct voices drifts through the air. A glass rests in my hand, half-filled with something amber and warm.

I do not know where I am.

And worse—I do not remember how I got here.

But I know that somewhere, on the edge of reality, the battle continues.

And the angel—my angel—stands alone.
