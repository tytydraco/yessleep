***I live alone. That’s important.***

***It was fall of 2013. I had just moved into a cheap, quiet apartment in northern Illinois after finishing college. Nothing fancy — one bedroom, middle of nowhere, four units total. The kind of place you pick when you’re broke and want to be left alone.***

***My job back then was late nights at a 24-hour diner. I’d usually get home around 1:30, sometimes closer to 2 if I had to close up.***

***That night started like any other.***

***I remember it was cold. Not freezing yet, but sharp enough that your breath showed. I parked and noticed something immediately: my doormat was gone. Dumb thing to fixate on, right? But I remember thinking it was weird. Who steals a doormat?***

***I stood there for a second, staring at the bare concrete outside my door. Then that feeling hit me.***

***You ever get that sudden, primal wave that something’s off? Like every hair on your neck is trying to whisper “you’re not alone”? Yeah. That.***

***I got inside fast. Locked the door. Triple checked the deadbolt. Didn’t even take off my shoes. I just stood there listening.***

***Nothing.***

***So I shook it off. Told myself I was overtired. Heated up leftovers, sat on the couch, TV low. Probably twenty minutes passed.***

***Then came the knock.***

***Not loud. Not urgent. But deliberate. Three slow knocks.***

***I froze.***

***I wasn’t expecting anyone. Especially not at 1:57 AM.***

***I crept to the door and looked through the peephole.***

***There was a man standing there. Hoodie pulled up. Face lowered so I couldn’t see anything but his mouth and chin. No movement. Just… standing.***

***I said — because my dumb instincts kicked in —***  
***“Uh… can I help you?”***

***He didn’t answer.***

***Then, a second later, he said:***

***My full name.***

***Like my full f\*\*ing name.\****

***First and last. No mistake.***

***I didn’t say anything. I just backed away from the door like it might explode. I grabbed the kitchen knife from the sink, turned every single light off, and crawled to the bedroom. My heart was beating so hard it hurt.***

***I was whispering to the 911 operator when I heard it again.***

***Knock knock knock.***

***But not at the front door.***

***My bedroom window.***

***He had walked around the building.***

***I didn’t have curtains yet — just moved in — so I ducked below the window and held my breath. I didn’t even want to blink too loud. The dispatcher kept asking if I was okay. I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.***

***Eventually, I heard the cruiser pull in.***

***By the time the cops got there, the guy was gone.***

***But here’s where it got worse.***

***One of the officers walked back toward my door and said, “Hey… was this under your mat?”***

***It was a folded piece of paper. Dirty. Wet from the concrete. On it, written in shaky pen, was:***

***“You’re lucky I like to wait.”***

***I moved out seven days later. Haven’t lived alone since.***

***And I still have no idea how he knew my name.***
