Well, I decided to create this post about an event that I'm experiencing in my day-to-day life. I tried discussing this with my friends and family, but the only response I got was laughter as if what I was saying was a joke. When I searched about this they say it's something called d√©j√† vu, but I believe it's not. Well actually I have d√©j√† vu myself, but this was different. I have done these things before... everything that I'm doing now I have done before it feels like is repeating, I cannot remember most of it but I remember I have done this exam before as if I can't remember what was in the exam, maybe you might say I might have done a similar exam like this but this isn't a normal exam it's a board exam so its impossible that I have something similar like this, its not only the exam paper its all the studying its all the going outs its all the gaming that repeats. I know the majority of people won't believe this, I also don't think this is something magical but it might be a syndrome that I have. What are your ideas about this? üòä

Edited: So I tried posting this but the MOD wants me to at least have 500 words in this post which I believe I have to talk more about this and myself. Well this is something that started experiencing a few months ago, so it is not something I have experienced in my lifetime, I'm 16 years old and going to be 17 end of this year and I am going to an international school, I have a younger sister along with my mom and dad. I'm also a person who is interested in theories that are connected to the universe. I also have some theories that I made myself up ( one of which talks about the possibilities of teleportation using speed ). Now talking about the experience, I had multiple occasions which I see and remember I have done this before, this might have happened twice but no the same thing happened to me for the 3rd time, which leads to a feeling like I'm stuck in a loophole, not a normal loophole but a long one. I have no idea what to say about this, my head hurts right now typing this and the moderators want me to type 500 words minimum what the hell dude? I'm going to talk about some shit that won't be related to the main story okay? So think of this as the end of the story. Why does sour candy feel addictive? when I eat one I cannot stop feeling the sour taste of different flavours. I never felt that way for other sweets even for other sour-related food. Do you guys feel the same about sour candy? Do you know what the worst possible time for eating sour candy? right after brushing your teeth. The taste that I get eating sour candy after having toothpaste in my month could be the worst taste I have experienced.
