Working at the hospital most days has its ups and downs. Especially with the budget cuts we’ve endured these past months. It’s gotten harder to understand what the administrators expect of us when we’re stretched so thin. Honestly, it’s a struggle for patients to even see a doctor these days. It’s difficult to reconcile that a system meant to care for people so often just… guesses. So often, it shrugs.  
  
What I’ve learned is this: the only thing that saves a patient any more is a doctor bending the rules. Or one of us nurses actually putting in some work.  
  
It started small, these unconventional methods. A burn victim came in, and we had no available rooms, no proper anaesthetics. Just me and three other nurses scrambling for a solution. Then I thought of something, nearly expired experimental medications for pain relief for chemotherapy, stockpiled for another department. The others hesitated. It was a risk but it worked. The patient recovered. Slowly, they came to see things my way.  
  
Now? Our unit reports a five percent better recovery rate than the others. But we don’t talk about how. Not to patients, not to doctors, not even to new nurses until they’ve been broken in properly.  
  
Other cases had improvised solutions. But then came the ones that didn’t. The ones where we had to decide, fast, who got pushed through and who wouldn’t last the wait.  
  
After a while, the solutions got… creative.  
  
The second time, it was a child. Leukaemia, with the oncology unit backed up for weeks. His mother begged, her voice fraying at the edges. The boy’s veins stood out like ropes beneath his papery skin, his breath wet and laboured. I’d seen the signs before. He wouldn’t survive the delay.  
  
So I took one of the spare chemo vials. It was expired, technically, but what wasn’t these days? I diluted it. Half-dose. Just enough to stabilize him until real treatment could begin.  
  
He seized within minutes.  
  
Not the slow, fading kind. Violent. Back arched like a bowstring, fingers clawing at the sheets. We pinned him down, shoved a bite guard between his teeth. His mother screamed. The other nurses looked at me like I’d handed him poison.  
  
Maybe I had.  
  
But by morning, his counts improved. The oncologists called it an unexpected remission. The mother cried in relief. Nobody asked questions.  
  
It was after the kid that I started paying closer attention to the chemo vials.  
  
The drug name was unfamiliar startup’s logo, a snake eating itself. When I asked Admin about the stash, they just shrugged. "Probably a trial batch. Don’t overthink it."  
  
The other nurses hesitated after the seizure. Too risky, they said. But the kid lived. And when I checked his charts a week later, his counts were cleaner than any of the oncology unit’s regulars.  
  
So I took a few vials home.  
  
Heavily diluted, obviously. Just enough to test. I told myself it was research. That if I could pinpoint the right dosage, we wouldn’t have to gamble next time.  
  
The micro-dosing sharpened me.  
  
I worked double shifts without fatigue. My hands never shook. I calculated dosages in my head faster than the pharmacy’s software. The other nurses whispered about me. How is she always the first to spot the crash? But only Clarissa watched me with real fear.  
  
She was the one who clung to protocol, even when it failed. The one who panicked when textbooks didn’t save a coding patient, then glared when our vials did. When Admin announced random drug tests, she actually smiled.  
  
Joke’s on her. The tests came back clean.  
  
Whatever was in those vials, it didn’t metabolize like normal chemo. At the right dose, it was invisible. Perfect.  
  
That was until the first patient we treated showed up.  
  
Their skin had cracked.  
  
The old burns had healed wrong, leathery and discoloured. No, these were deep, jagged splits, like something inside had grown too large for the flesh to contain. They ran from the clavicle down, precise as surgical incisions, following the spine in unnervingly straight lines.  
  
Then the smell hit. Sulphur, like thick and coppery blood left to rot in a rusted can. It clung to the inside of my mask, coating my tongue. One of the nurses gagged; another, Clarissa's hands, started sobbing.  
  
I dragged her into the supply closet before she could hyperventilate. Her pupils were blown wide, her breath coming in hitches.  
  
"Look at me," I hissed, squeezing her wrist too tight. "You say one word—to Admin, to a patient, to your fucking priest—and we’re all done. You understand? No severance. No references. Don't forget how the job market is like now. You'll create a black mark that’ll follow you to every hospital in the state."  
  
She nodded, tears cutting clean tracks through her foundation. Good.  
  
But later, alone in the staff bathroom, I peeled off my scrubs. Pressed my fingers to the base of my own neck, where the skin had started to itch.  
  
I gathered the nurses one last time.  
  
More patients would come. More cracks, more sulphur, more questions we couldn’t answer. The vials had to disappear. Every record, every note gone. I made sure of it.  
  
What happened to that man was wrong, yes. Maybe even sinful. But what choice did they leave us? We wade through death every day. We kneel beside it, stitch it shut, send it home with a smile and a prescription. If we hesitated every time the rules didn’t fit, the morgue would overflow by Tuesday.  
  
The meeting ended at midnight. I stayed behind. Security helped me load the "expired inventory" into the van. A hundred dollars silenced their curiosity.  
  
Now, alone, I had to bury it.  
  
I stopped for gas. That’s when the itch spread.  
  
It started at my neck, then slithered down to my elbow, slow and deliberate, like something crawling under my skin. I scratched until my nails caught on dampness. Pulled back my sleeve.  
  
Oozing. A wet, glistening split, barely a hair’s width, but deep. Too deep.  
  
I turned my head.  
  
The stench hit me like a fist. Sulphur and spoiled meat. It was back.  
  
I slammed my hands against the steering wheel. Once. Twice. The pain grounded me.  
  
In the rear-view mirror, the vials gleamed.  
  
I reached back, fingers trembling, and felt the crack widening beneath my collar.  
  
I made it home just as the itch became a fire under my skin.  
  
Parked crooked in the driveway. Brushed past my husband’s questions, my daughter’s outstretched hand. Locked myself in the bathroom.  
  
Strip. Inspect. Fix this.  
  
The mirror showed the truth: jagged fissures branching from my neck to my ribs, weeping that same translucent ooze. The smell had already seeped under the door.  
  
A knock. "Honey? You okay?"  
  
"Fine." My voice didn’t sound like mine. "Order the pizza."  
  
The shower hissed to life. I scrubbed until my skin burned, but the ooze clung like oil. My daughter’s voice floated in, muffled: "Ma, why’s it smell like matches in here?"  
  
Then, the solution: a single 50ml vial tucked behind the towels.  
  
I drank it.  
  
The reaction was instant. My bowels turned to water. The cracks hissed, edges fusing like melted plastic. Pain gave way to numb, blissful relief.  
  
"Ma! Pizza’s here!"  
  
I leaned against the tiles, breathing hard. The vial had worked.  
  
For now.  
  
I started to grow nervous, about how long I would need to take the vials to prevent the cracking.  
  
Maybe I could trace the manufacturer, find a generic, something to make it feel less… nameless. But every search hit a dead end. No website. No FDA listing. Not even internal inventory records. The department that originally asked us to store it couldn’t explain where it came from or why.  
  
I kept searching. Through pathology reports, procurement records, even my own tampering with the vials and nothing. Every attempt to dilute the dose, to ration it, only made things worse. The cracks came back faster, deeper.  
  
One night, they split me open across the abdomen. I barely made it to the bathroom before I vomited on the tile, choking on the stench. You just never get used to it, as soon as you catch a whiff.  
  
Work didn’t get easier. If anything, it became a mirror where I saw pieces of myself in every body that came through. The morgue reeked of sulphur on the bad days. Then, without warning, time began slipping faster.  
  
A month ago, I realized the worst of it: I’m running low. My supply, what little I have left. Might last three months. Maybe less. And then? Then I’d be just another corpse on the slab.  
  
Pathology have told me what they can’t dispose of a body the same day, they make exceptions. Cut it open, drain it dry, bleach everything before the smell sets in. Apparently, it works.  
  
I can’t stop thinking: That’s going to be me. They’ll bleach me before my husband even gets there.  
  
He suspects something. He thinks it’s another affair. How could I tell him this? Show him this?  
  
I just think about how alone I am now. Especially now that I’m the last one left. Everyone else quit, transferred, or disappeared. Clarissa... she didn’t make it.  
  
I went to her funeral last week. I wasn’t welcome. The contempt from the other nurse's fouled the air. Before the service even started, I had to leave. The itch had come back worse than ever. Like something was clawing its way out every time I took the vial too late.  
  
Sometimes I think there’s no way out. But then, something happened.  
  
Last week, the final patient I ever dosed came back.  
  
I saw them in the ER, just a flash of a face through the cracked door of trauma bay two. But I knew. Same hollowed eyes. Same pallor. Same veins that once pulsed wild with fever and fear.  
  
They were supposed to be gone.  
  
Not dead. Just… processed. Discharged. Out of sight, out of the nightmare.  
  
But they were back. Sitting upright, legs swinging over the edge of the gurney, like they hadn’t spent weeks with death curled in their lungs.  
  
Their eyes met mine. And they smiled.  
  
Not grateful. Not kind. Something else. Something knowing.  
  
I couldn’t breathe. I turned and walked until my knees hit tile. I didn’t cry. I couldn’t. I convulsed. Bent over the sink in the staff bathroom, gasping like I was the one coding. That smile kept replaying in my head, stretching wider every time. As if they knew what was inside me. As if they’d seen it grow.  
  
I didn’t go back to the floor. I couldn’t.  
  
By the time I returned the next day, Admin had already filled out the paperwork.  
  
Leave of absence. Burnout.  
Perfectly understandable. The last veteran finally cracking under pressure.  
  
The others bought it. Why wouldn’t they? They’d seen enough of their own breakdowns to know the shape of one. I even nodded along, played the part. It was easier than the truth.  
  
That I’d seen a ghost come back wearing flesh I helped rewrite.  
  
So now I’m home. Resting. Recovering.  
  
Just long enough to die in private. I'm not sure what else I can do to stop this.
