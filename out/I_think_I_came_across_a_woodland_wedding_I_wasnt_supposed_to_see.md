The rules seemed simple enough- it was a free nature preserve. Despite living in the area almost my entire life, I’d never actually been here. In high school, it was always open when I couldn’t be there, and closed whenever I drove by on weekends. The preserve always gave off a very mysterious vibe, probably because I was never able to go. 



Until now. 



Granted, I’m 30 now; so while lazing around my place trying to figure out how to spend a Saturday, I figured I’d go out and shoot. I had photographed in almost every park and nature centered space around my house except here. A quick search showed that the preserve was actually open today, and had pretty normal hours that teenage me didn’t think to look up. Closed on Mondays, open Tuesday-Saturday, from 8-5. 



Despite hitting every light on my way there, the drive was short. With my camera bag riding shotgun, I sped down the highway almost missing the dark brown sign saying “Belkin Hollow Nature Preserve” and had to make a sharp turn to enter. Past the rusted iron gates was a gravel road with a large white sign in red letters that said the following: 

  


**Rules of the Nature Preserve:** 

Stay on the trails at all times.

Please don’t park on the lawn

Bikes, ATV’s, UTV’s, and other such vehicles are not allowed. 

Please don’t litter. 

Photography that is being done professionally requires a permit.



My car wandered down the winding gravel road to an empty parking lot, found my spot, and checked the clock- 4:00pm. I got out and felt my boots crunch the gravel underneath them as I tried to figure out where to even begin-the place felt like a ghost town. The Information Center was devoid of any life at all and the more I looked around the more I began to realize how bare bones the preserve seemed to run. It seemed as though no one worked there; buildings were locked, there was no sign of any sort of human life. 



I picked a trail and began to walk, feeling the still sleeping earth crunching beneath my feet. I always liked the ‘in-between’ parts of the season; late March going into April was always particularly nice as it was still cool outside, everything seems dormant, but there were little signs of spring-daffodils starting to sprout, little pieces of green here and there. It was peaceful, and I liked it that way. I came across a weathered sign that through chipped paint read “Swamp Trail” and off I went.



Minutes turned into hours, and before I knew it, the sun was starting to set. Shit, I should get to my car. I turned around and began my way back walking a bit before realizing; I made a left to get here, so I needed to make a right to get back to my car… right? The Nature Preserve isn’t big, so no matter which trail I take in theory I should end up back at the parking lot at some point. The iron gate at the entrance seemed pretty old-I should be able to just open the doors and let myself out if I ended up leaving after they closed, it’ll be fine. 



The sun gleamed through the barren trees as it began to set in the distance over the river, the beauty of the preserve quietly presenting itself and I was ready to capture it all. I’ll stick to the trail and enjoy the walk back to my car. 



But.. None of this looks right.



I know I haven’t been here before, but the longer I walked it felt like the further I was from my car. Trying to use GPS didn’t help - no bars. With the sun dipping, and the temperatures with it, I needed to get back to my car, and I needed to do it soon. 



The trail that I had started to follow seemed to go nowhere; the gravel simply… stopping, almost in a line if it was possible. Out of the corner of my eye I spotted it- an overgrown, tangled trail that looked as if it hadn’t been taken care of in a decade. I guess it’s not surprising, there weren’t even people working at the preserve when I got there. A trails a trail, and maybe this one could lead me back to my car sooner rather than later. 



I should have stayed off that damn trail. I shouldn’t have even left my house.



As I wandered down the trail, it was different. The air was different. Warmer, brighter- ‘springier’ if that was even possible. The further I followed it, the more it felt like spring. New green growth, flowers blooming on either side - as if they were used as railing to guide people down. Inspiration poured out of my camera, I quickly filled SD card after SD card.

  


Why on earth was this trail ever neglected? 



After what seemed like a few minutes a clearing came into view; green, blooming trees bending and twisting into an arch, with bits of sunlight peeking through the like fairy lights, with what seemed to be logs set into rows. It was breathtaking. 



And then I noticed it - the longer I looked, the more that came into view. It was a wedding venue. The logs, they weren’t empty. Seats filled with what looked like figures of shadows and light; if it was even possible, it almost looked like there were trees and flowers seated in attendance. What’s next, woodland creatures?



Suddenly, the flowers on the ground began to sing, in a language that couldn’t be described or understood-it was beautiful, ethereal… It was old. It was very old. 



The bride appeared at the end of the aisle- she was drenched in pure sunlight, as she almost floated down, her sleeves bellowing in a sudden slight breeze as her dress glistened like the morning spring dew. 

She was breathtaking. And in a flash, I saw the picture appear in my mind, I had to capture it. That was my mistake.



My shutter had been silenced, any tracking lights had been turned off, and it was a good-quality full frame camera; it was quiet, and it was fast. There’s no way I should have been heard. But I was. No sooner had my finger left the shutter button the world seemed to stop turning. Everyone had their eyes on me. 



Faces, if you could call them that, were distorted, aged, and uneven. Eyes glowed, their teeth yellow, ragged, and scraggly.



I suddenly felt the need to get the hell out of dodge, and leave. 



The bride looked at me next. Her eyes boring holes into my body, the air surrounding me seemed to go from cold to warm to sweltering - the light that had enveloped her dress was now blinding, and despite trying to move my feet felt as though they had been melted into the dirt. 



And then she screamed. Rows of sharp, pointed teeth smiled sinisterly at me while she did it.



It was a piercing, deafening scream. I felt the blood run down from my ears, as everything became muffled. She raised her arms, casting light over where I stood and the congregation stood. 



They began to make their way towards me. 



I tried to turn and run-but I couldn’t. Looking down, my boots were covered in thick, green, lush, moss that began climbing up the heel, and it looked like it was going to try to capture me. Thankfully, a quick slip of my boots and I was off. I turned and fled. 



The trail, once warm and blooming, turned dark, cold, and sharp. The once clear path now riddled with logs and roots - was this forest trying to trip me? My lungs on fire, I tore my way down the path I had taken just moments earlier. 



The screams intensified. And there was more than one. They were getting closer. 



I pushed my legs harder, demanding they carry me as quickly as they could out of this place. I didn’t try to remember which turns I took, I was more concerned with the creatures that were gaining on me as I tried to escape. 



And as suddenly as I had gotten lost, I saw it-the clearing where my car was. Shining under the moonlight, my SUV waited patiently for me. Fumbling with my keys, I was able to confirm that they car battery was still working, and was able to unlock my car. I’ve never heard a sweeter sound, sweet and clear. 



Sound. I touched my ears, and where blood once was trickled out, was nothing. No dried blood, nothing at all. I slowed to a jog, and listened - the quiet rush of the highway near the entrance, and my own hard breathing, while my heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. 



I made it to my car, quickly hopping in and locking it because I’m not taking any chances. I turned it over and heard the hum of the engine come to life. Looking around, there was nothing. 



No figures. No light. Nothing. I must have looked like a madman running out to my car, if there was anyone else to see me. I decided shakily, to check my camera and make sure it was unharmed. 



And they were gone. All of them, gone. 



All the shots I had taken of the trail, the blooms, the wedding venue - as if I hadn’t taken any pictures at all. My phone began vibrating and popping, message after message coming through. 



Holy shit, it was 10pm. 



Normal ‘hey when are you coming home’ messages turning into more concerned messages, turning into missed calls - from my fiancée, my best friend, my parents. The last text saying that if I didn’t respond he was going to call and put in a missing persons’ report. 



I texted him back. Told him I was okay, and that I was on my way home. 



The drive home was as short as the drive there, and to say that my fiancée was miffed was an understatement. He wondered where I was, why didn’t I text him back, didn’t he know how worried I had made him? 



And what was I going to say? There’s no way he would have believed it, not like I had any proof to show anyways. 



So I told him that I got tired after my hike and decided to nap in my car- what was supposed to be half an hour turned into a few, and I apologized profusely. 



Not totally approving of the apology, he accepted it, and sat back down in his chair, and resumed the youtube video he’d been watching. After peeling off my dirty outdoor clothes and taking a shower, I finally began to feel normal again. 



As I washed my face in the sink, I noticed something-right under my earlobes. A small, white symbol, on both sides. A sun on one, and a moon on the other. It was hot to the touch, as if to serve a reminder of what I had escaped, but healed. If I didn't know any better, I'd say it was almost like a tattoo.  



I tried to sleep, and I couldn’t. I could only see the bride’s face. The faces of the creatures in attendance every time I closed my eyes. 



That was three days ago. Today is day four. At this point, I’m willing to try anything so I can get some sleep. Tea, melatonin, edibles, even doctor prescribes Ambien. Nothing. 



I’m hoping that by writing this out, either someone who has dealt with this will have some advice, or maybe just getting this all down will be enough. 



But those faces. I still see those faces. And every time I pass that nature preserve, I feel those symbols burning deeper into my skin.
