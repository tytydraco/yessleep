I am one of the unlucky ones. I spent every moment among abled with this crippling feeling of unbelonging. Sure, I had friends in my ‘’senseless’’ community. It was not enough. And maybe it was ungrateful of me, I couldn't contain this urge to be *normal.*

Connecting to the deepest level? Seeing more than on the surface? Such a mundane thing for normal people. They would pity me for the lack of something I couldn't even comprehend.

  


Endless ruminations of my mind were taking turns with a boring reality I had as a life. 

My sleepy older brother mumbled through the yawn:

“Sun is sure grumpy today, isn't it?” 

What a typical way to describe weather for the abled ones.

  


“Seems just as usual warm today to me. A little cloudy, maybe,” I replied with disinterest. 

  


My brother gave me an encouraging pat on the shoulder and said: 

“I’m sure the parietal implant will give you everything you need.”

  
  


The evening before the surgery, I couldn't brush off the uneasiness. The charming smell of Baskoro’s dinner was my only distraction. Almost everyone would support my decision to get the parietal implant. It was recently patented and vigorously tested in private experiments but not yet widespread for the public. Though Baskoro would still be concerned about unnecessary risks. It was his last chance to change my mind. 

“It's going to be alright. I was waiting for this for so long! I can’t just drop it,” I argued.

  


“It is never too late,” He said and let out a sigh, “Sometimes, it’s hard to abandon your commitment, but are you truly sure if it is worth it?” 

I didn’t say anything. He knew I had already made up my mind.  

“Though, it is ultimately your choice,” he added, staring into the window. I didn't have to see his face to know he had that grumpy look.

  


I wanted to see it through. It was chilling to my bone marrow, yet I wanted to know the truth. I was meant to feel what I was ripped off from my birth.

20 years. I had spent 20 years of my life looking for patterns in these glances and I failed to see any. As if sixth sense perception was so deeply embedded in every moment of your life you can't pinpoint what makes it *normal*. Different from mine. 

  


I can admit that bitter envy is clouding my judgement. But if I don’t see it through, then I will spend my years with doubts and regret.

  


In the hospital’s corridor I heard a child's cry which is common for sterile white rooms smelling of alcohol. A girl's parents were trying to soothe her as she left the cabinet rubbing her temples. Getting used to something entirely new cannot be easy. Though, the younger the patients are, the bigger are the chances of success. 

  


“It'll get better in just a couple of hours!” The familiar voice of my doctor rang through the door. It opened with an inviting creak. 

  


He picked up a new pair of gloves and put them on with a loud pop of plastic in preparation for testing my senses. 

The flashlight checked my vision, common odors like coffee tested my sense of smell, and some other trials were commenced for taste, hearing and skin touch. Following the final check before the procedure, the swirls of excitement and anxiety were drowning me, and my thoughts were rushing, failing to anchor to anything calming. Anesthesia finally let me have just a moment of peace. My memories after that were fuzzy and in odd order.

I woke up in what felt like only a second of restless sleep. To my surprise I felt only a little bit of nagging pain. I couldn’t form any thoughts, and in that state they let me rest.

  


I was disturbed by my doctor after two hours of a feverish nap.

  


“Time to test!” he eagerly said and got a triangle. Its metal glittered in the sun rays. Reflections were painfully blinding due to the headache. Time was moving so excruciatingly slow, I couldn’t wait for my honour. The doctor hit the triangle with a stick. It was silent. I looked at the doctor in confusion since I could hear steps behind the door and the wind outside. He stared into my eyes searching for a result. I shifted uncomfortably in the chair. 

  


“I hear nothing from this triangle. Is that normal?” I asked with caution. 

  


He rubbed his chin. “That is unusual but not unheard of. Did you ever feel the 6th sense indirectly through other basic 5 senses? For example, blind can dream visually and discern light from darkness.”

  


“Even if I did, I won't be able to say specifically what,” I replied. 

  


“Well, as you have been told already, the implant truly doesn't give you the sense. It helps you create new neural paths in your brain so it can imitate the feeling for you. Not only it might take awhile to get used to it, but, I'm very sorry to say, in your case it is possible that it won't be as effective as it was expected to be at first. But we will see.”

  


I swallowed to ease the dry throat. There was a weird mix of relief and disappointment in my stomach. I knew about this possibility already, but it should have been enough to finally blend in.  

  


Though, and I couldn't tell if it was my imagination, I could almost feel the neuron paths being generated as the new information that I couldn't discern yet is being processed. The pain was minor, it was lingering in the background of my conscience. 

  


I finished dealing with the documents and the scheduling of the next check-up and went outside under a dense barrage of clouds. I could see the spots of light and shadows running on the asphalt, as clouds were passing by with immense speed. Not sure what got into me when I rushed under the cover of a cafe to avoid another trail of sun, just like when I was a kid messing around outdoors.

When I could see clouds last enough to cover me all the way through to my home, I was relieved to get proper rest back home.

  


It was barely 4 pm when I dropped onto my bed and fell asleep in an instant. I hoped I would sleep as if knocked out. But my dreams were a mess of unintelligible shapes and sounds. I felt so hot and uncomfortable. Delirium visions were afflicting my restless sleep. No position was right, no pillow was soft. Viscous fake awakenings were taking turns with vexing terrors.

  


Scorching pain hit my ears - a roaring scream was tearing my mind apart. I jolted out of bed and everything was rolling before my eyes as I was trying to find balance under unending torture. The screeching was unbearable, it took seconds - a negligible amount usually, but painfully long in this moment - to get a hold of the situation and shut my ears with palms. It didn't get any quieter. My wide opened eyes looked around in despair. Where is this torturous sound coming from and why can I not possibly block it out even slightly? Sweat was covering my neck as I was panting from excruciating pain, still helplessly holding my hands on my ears in lack of anything else I could do. Headache was pulsating in my head as if drills were rearranging my brain matter with each thrust of pain. I crawled whimpering to the corner of the room trying to curl up in an embryo pose. My human intelligence regressed to the basic existence of a primitive creature that could feel nothing but this unending pain. 

  


My mind was blank for an unknown amount of time and, slowly without being conscious about it, I came to my senses and it was finally quiet. My body felt frozen and it was scary to move, almost if slight flick of a finger would bring torture back. I slowly opened my eyes and cautiously sat down trying to process what had happened. One thing was clear - the scream I supposedly heard wasn't a sound. 

My thoughts were like lazy flies rumbling trying to get a hold of the whole picture. My mind felt like a sore body on the next day of the most extensive exercise. I felt somewhat like an animal that barely escaped a predator. Yet, it was lurking. I had to think fast. 

Maybe it was some sort of case of synesthesia - an anomalous blending of the senses. Exactly - this is what the doctor was talking about, experiencing something through another sense. I rubbed my temple that was yet to completely recover from anesthesia. What input could make me hear such an awful noise? I got up with my legs slightly shaking. I felt utterly pale and exhausted even though I had just woken up. 

  


I sighed and calmed down. It was morning and the sun was leaving stripes on the floor and my bed through the curtains. I walked to the window to close them in hope to resume my sleep and to deal with whatever that was later. I reached out and sun rays hit my finger - a scream put sharp claws around my mind. I froze and gasped. Sounds were racing through my head. My thoughts were reduced to screaming once more. Two seconds later I flicked it away like from a burning stove in pain. 

  


The *Sun*. I heard the *Sun*.

  


Third eye has opened just to be met with blinding pain.

  


I kneeled so I wouldn't be hit by sun rays and my trembling hand closed the curtain with a struggle because of an uncomfortable angle. I collapsed right there on the floor under the window sill. I was taking deep comforting breaths trying to sort out what had happened, what I felt. I clutched my finger in the palm and instead of burning sensation I heard echoes of the voices from far away. 

I came to the conclusion that the curtains were possibly moved by wind and Sun hit my face through the opening. This is what caused me immense torture. Does everyone with 6th sense feel the Sun the same way or have I had an unsuccessful procedure with terrible complications? Truly, abled people are happy under the Sun. They cherish it and share it with each other. One thing is certain, I need to get it fixed, I cannot imagine living avoiding the sun like some sort of vampire. Some legend might come after me and kill me in my sleep.

  


I got up and started changing for an emergency doctor's visit. Danger wasn't immediate and I wasn't sure if I could explain myself without being sent to a psychiatrist check-up. And so I couldn't call an ambulance. I picked up my phone and stared at the screen with a few concerned messages from friends and family. What should I say? I was really insistent on getting this implant. It feels embarrassing to admit it wasn't a great idea after all. I decided to put it off worrying everyone until I'm sure it is serious and long-term. I copy-pasted "I'm doing good. Resting. Getting a check-up today. Thanks for the concern!" with slight changes to each person depending on my relationship with them. 

I put the phone down and started brainstorming how to cover all of my skin. I put on long clothes and gloves. At first, I thought that an umbrella should cover my face and neck, but the possibility of pain hit me like a whip. A vivid memory from long ago made me shudder. Once reflected light in my car’s mirror hit me in the eyes and it almost made me lose control of the vehicle. An umbrella is not safe enough. Is it appropriate in this situation to dress like I’m actually invisible? I have bandaged my face, put a scarf around my neck and put sunglasses on. During that, I received a call on my phone and struggled to accept the call both mentally and physically. Physically, because the touch screen is not responsive enough to my glove’s material, and mentally because it was Baskoro. 

  


“Hi, how are you?” I tried to speak as nonchalantly as possible.

  


“Are you alright? The text you sent was weird,” he deadpanned. I panicked almost audibly. I couldn't possibly guess his reaction besides most likely justified scolding. 

  


“Yeah, everything is good! I'm going to the doctor right now for a check up,” I replied, with hopes my voice wasn’t shaking. 

  


“Alright, I'll be right there.”

Before I could even protest he ended the call. You can’t escape the inevitable. 

  


I was never so anxious about going outside before. When I opened the door to the street fully bright from sunlight I was covered in goosebumps. There was no open skin. First step out. I became aware of the sun rays trying to penetrate through the pores of my clothes but even if they were reaching anywhere, thankfully, I could barely feel it. If I heard something unusual I could mix it up with the city noise.

I was completely focused on the road, ignoring glances from passersby. 

  


When I finally entered the clinic, Baskoro was already there. He was talking to a nurse and she was visibly giving him a cold shoulder. I approached him carefully, trying to think of how to explain myself. 

Confusion and concern appeared at his usually steady face. 

“What happened?” he said with an indiscernible tone.

I felt like something was stuck in my throat and realized I was on the verge of crying. If I say anything, absolutely anything, I would just burst down. 

“Hey, come here,” he whispered softly as he slightly squeezed my arm to lead me to sit on the couch. He tried to look into my eyes through the dark lenses of my sunglasses, “What happened, Lise?”

I felt as if I lost something important. A connection with people I've already had. And now, I'm stuck in this limbo between abled and senseless. 

  


I cried my heart out without saying anything. He waited for me to be able to talk. I took my glasses off since they were collecting tears and removed bandages from my mouth. 

  


I kept stuttering as he was patiently looking at me. “I don't know. Something went terribly wrong and I was in so much pain because,” I took a raspy breath, “I heard the Sun.”

I looked down at my shoes expecting a response but he was waiting for me to continue. 

“You are not going to lecture me? You were mad at me, weren’t you? Since I told you about my plans and you were right all along.” 

  


He snorted. 

“Why are you hurting so much? You had no idea *this* could possibly happen.”

  


“Thank you,” I said with a barely intelligible and trembling voice.

  


“Thank me later when I'll make this place fix this nonsense”.

  


A mean looking nurse heard me out while barely paying attention. She glanced at me with a mix of annoyance and disturbance. She took my measurements, suddenly swore and walked off in a rush. I felt myself going increasingly pale. 

  


I was furious. The adult patients that were permitted to have experimental implants were possessing some sort of a curious pair of genes: one that would allow the sharpest 6th sense, and one that would apparently cause loss of 6th sense at the same time. Scientists wanted to find out why.

“The procedure was an enormous success even if you don't agree with me right now. No, even if I remove the implant, neurons’ connections have already been established so you would keep your 6th sense. It has heightened activity and sensitivity compared to the general population. You should feel privileged and grateful. You might need to reassess your religion and your place here.”

  


“What?” I was baffled, “Not to be disrespectful, but how is religion relevant here?” 

  


“Your attitude is the reason why it is so painful.”

  
  


Sun imagery is everywhere in human history and religion. Saints halos, personification of the Sun, rituals and dances. What is the Sun but not a God? Powerful beyond comprehension. In size so unimaginably enormous, yet so far way out of human grasp. It will blind you if you dare look at it. It is life, it is death. It is a gentle touch of warmth and unbearable scorching heat. It can disappear to our doom at any moment and it wouldn't be to anyone's surprise. 

  


“Sun is not sentient,” I said with a shaking voice. 

  


“Do you think something capable of communication is not sentient? You spent your life in darkness, deaf to the call. People pitied you for your overwhelming ignorance! And now you want to go back to your intoxicating foolishness? Too late. Accept the gift and pray to listen closely to the Sun.”

  


My blessing, My curse. I always hear it now. It is loud during the day when the Sun is looming over my existence. It is quiet at night, where the Moon is a pathetic reflection of the Sun's light in its absence. I was going through life, oblivious to the overwhelming presence of the star. Everything I hear, feel, think is touched by the Sun. 

  


It is an absolute peak of Sun activity in its current 11 year cycle and the highest peak since 1976.
