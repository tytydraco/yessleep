It started on my 23rd birthday.

I was sitting at the table with my family singing happy birthday to me. I was looking at everyone's smiling faces, singing along with them because just sitting there always feels so awkward. I was smiling back at all of them, and we were all so happy.

And then I saw their faces change. Fast.

I watched as all of those smiling happy faces quickly turned into panic-filled ones full of fear and dread as I felt a large hand place itself on the back of my head.

I should mention that my cake was a large, three-tiered cake that my Grandma had made, her classic yellow cake with chocolate frosting. Everyone's favorite. To help stabilize the layers, my Grandma put little wooden dowel rods in the cake. Everyone in my family knew about those little wooden dowel rods, and knew not to do anything stupid.

Well, everyone except my uncle.

No one expected him to show up, so they didn't bother telling him about them. Everything would have been fine if he just hadn't done what he did.

Confused and unaware of what was mere milliseconds away from happening, I felt the large hand shove my head down into the cake.

My ears were filled with the screams of my family as I felt those little wooden dowel rods puncture my eyes, nose, and throat. While the rest of my family understood the horror of what was happening, it took my uncle a little bit longer to notice the blood that was trailing off the side of the cake. Maybe I would have been okay if he hadn't continued to smash my face into the cake before realizing something was wrong. Maybe.

I heard my Grandpa yelling as he tried to pull my uncle away from me, but it was too late. There was no saving me. I just hoped that my family didn't have to see those little wooden dowel rods sticking out of my face.

As I sat there, hunched over, unable to stop death from taking me, my life flashed before my now ruptured, skewered, and bleeding eyes. I thought about every moment leading up to that birthday, and how I wished I could just keep living. I wished that what was happening wasn't happening, and that I could start that day over and tell my uncle NOT to do the stupid thing that would end up killing his oldest niece. I prayed for another chance at life, at that day, at that minute. I wished so desperately for that moment to have never happened.

And when I woke up the next morning, I found out it didn't.

According to the video, my uncle showed up, yes, but he didn't shove my face into the cake. He just stood behind me singing happy birthday like everyone else. According to the video, I did not die at my 23rd birthday party.

But I know I did. I felt it. 

I felt death claw at my being as much as I felt those little wooden dowel rods pierce my throat and nasal cavity. It couldn't have been a dream. I KNOW it wasn't. Even now, I remember what it felt like when the wood pierced my eyes. I remember the squelching sounds as my eyeballs were punctured. As my esophagus was stabbed, gushing blood as it poured out of me. I remember hearing the crunch of my skull as the wood forced its way up my nose and into my head. I remember every agonizing moment of that death. But I was too afraid to ask my family if anything even remotely close to what I KNOW happened happened. I didn't need them thinking I was losing it. So despite what I know happened, and despite that video not showing the truth of that night, I dropped it. I dropped a secret nobody else knew I was keeping.

And life went on. Until it happened again three years later.

That time, I feel like I could have stopped it. I at least had more of a fighting chance than the first time I died. Plus, when has playing chicken fight in the pool ever gone completely right? I had my cousin on my shoulders as we were playing against my sister and her sister. Just two sets of sisters laughing and having fun, enjoying a nice, warm, sunny day.

There had been a few close calls of almost choking on water for both me and my sister. If you've never been the base in a game of chicken fight, you're basically drowning the whole time while being choked by the person on your shoulders. Not intentionally, but still, it happens.

We were all having a good time until I felt my cousin start to slip. She knew that she was supposed to let go of me if she started to slip off too much. We had played chicken fight so many times before, and she knew what to do. That happy medium between fighting to continue playing the game and trying to win, and being too far gone and just taking the loss by falling off. She knew, and still, on that day, she held on. She held on when I told her she was choking me. She held on when I told her I couldn't breathe. And she held on as I tried to get to a more shallow part of the pool so I could stop inhaling water.

Maybe it was my fault for moving. Maybe it was hers for holding on so tight. Maybe it was inevitable, and neither of us were to blame. All that matters is that when I went to get out of the pool, she slipped off, jerking my head around violently as she fell.

I think I hit the ground shortly after she hit the water. Or at least, I assume I did. Maybe my body fell back into the pool with her. Maybe it fell forward and I landed on the concrete, making no move to break my fall, because I couldn't. I was dead before my cousin hit the water.

Unlike the first time, my neck being snapped was a much faster death.

That time, there was no video to prove what happened, but there were pictures. Pictures of us playing in the pool with family members that weren't there yet. Pictures of us smiling together after the sun had already set, even though I knew I died in the sunlight. Pictures of moments that couldn't have happened, supposedly taken after a moment I remember that never did.

I had to let that one go too. I didn't know what was happening, but three years had passed between my first death and my second, and no one else seemed to notice but me. It's so hard trying to pretend like you haven't died before.

My sixth death was the first one that I truly saw coming, but couldn't do anything to stop.

I was 32, and I went on a singles cruise with some friends of mine. A week of margaritas, men, and soaking up the gorgeous sun in Malibu. It was day four of the cruise when I was approached by a man I wasn't interested in. He had previously tried getting to know me a little more, but I declined his offers. For days, I tried staying away from that man, but when you're on a boat, there's nowhere to go. It's always so hard when they don't take no for an answer.

On that fourth day, the man found me when I was alone, and kept getting closer to me. I felt cornered, and scared, and I didn't know what else to do, so I put my hands up defensively to try and keep him away from me. That upset him, and he shoved me. Hard. So hard I fell backwards over the railing I was leaning up against, and I fell off the boat.

It wasn't the impact as I hit the water that killed me. It wasn't even the fear of realizing that I was paralyzed from the waist down. No, death came slower than all of that. Death got me when I desperately tried to stay above the surface of the water using only my arms. I'm not sure who could've fought the current of the water that was rushing underneath the boat as it passed me by. I'm not sure how long I would have lasted out there even with the use of my legs.

Drowning is a slow, terrifying, peaceful thing.

First, you try holding your breath. Once you can't hold it anymore, your body goes into fight-or-flight mode. The problem with being submerged under water is that there's nothing to fight, and there's nowhere to run. Water rules its own territory, and once you're too far under, there's no coming back to the surface. Your body instinctively tries to breathe, and you open your mouth. Water gets in. Your epiglottis - the part of your body that prevents liquid from going down your esophagus - reflexively closes, and then attempting to breathe isn't even an option. You go from desperately trying to stay above the water,  to panicking once you’re under it, to choking once it’s inside of you, and then...

Peace.

I didn’t realize there was a peace to drowning. Once your lungs stop burning and your body doesn’t have the oxygen to fight anymore, there’s a calmness to what comes next. Like you’re drifting off to sleep. Your body goes still, the pain goes away, and you fade out of consciousness in a state more tranquil than I can describe. Like you’re floating in the air and your existence is effortless and infinite. And then you fall unconscious. I don’t know if my body ever floated back to the surface that day, but I do know that when I woke up the next morning, one of my friends was telling me all about how inappropriate that man was being before she told him off and he walked away from us. If only that’s how I experienced it. 

There were other quick deaths over the years. Appendix ruptured at 35. Was jumped in an alley at 40. Shot in a drive-by at 45. Got t-boned by a semi-truck at 48.

By my count, I've died 16 times over the past couple decades, all of them ranging from stupid little mistakes to crazy freak accidents that no one could have prevented.

And as horrible as those previous deaths were, the most recent one was by far the worst.

I was 51. My daughter and her friends were taking a trip to El Paso, and they got a flat tire on the side of the road. I was only an hour away from them when some animal ran in front of my car. It's so hard fighting reactions. I had grown up being told that you should NEVER swerve to avoid hitting an animal, but in that moment, it's just what my hands did. My car ended up, flipped over in a ditch, and I was pinned inside my vehicle. No one drove by. No one saw me. No one heard me. Even when my daughter tried to call me to see where I was, my phone had landed outside of the car and I couldn't reach it. I was stuck. I stayed stuck. And I died stuck. A person can last weeks without food, but water? 3-5 days, most sources say. My body gave out on the third day. Lack of water is one thing, but baking under the blazing Texas sun in 100°F weather while being pinned underneath a vehicle adds a whole new layer to things. That was an agonizing death. I tried so hard to free myself from the car, even if it was only enough to reach my phone, but I couldn’t. So I laid there dying, baking, and suffocating under the hot Texas sun.

And now I’m here.

I'm 55, I have a job that I love, with a family that is as big as I want it to be, and I couldn’t ask for more in life. I just got home from a dinner with my friends to celebrate a new promotion I got at work. I have a cupcake next to me to help celebrate, and a candle one of my friends gave me as a gift.

I don't know when I'll die again. If it'll be hours from now, weeks from now, months from now, years from now. I'm just going to focus on the good in my life, and hope that I get to live a long time with the people I love.

I think that's all I have to say. I just wanted to get this out while everything was still present in my mind. I remember those deaths. I remember the pain and fear of every one of them. And I can't help but feel like the next time will be my last. Although I’ve thought that same thing about all 16 of my deaths.

So I won't focus on that. Instead, I'll focus on the good parts of this moment, like the beautiful house I live in, and the nice candle my friend got me. "French vanilla." My favorite scent.

I think I'm going to light it after I post this. There's a really strong egg smell I want to get rid of.
