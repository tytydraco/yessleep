Nobody ever told me that the ride to Massachusetts from California took quite so god damned long. Or how much evil there really is out in those forboding marshes. 

Yet there I was years ago,  motorcycle roaring like a demon as it ripped across the states with four other bikes rumbling right on beside me. 

I dread that day with every waking moment, and the only reason I am bothering telling this to anyone is because my therapist thinks it might help stop the cold sweats and screaming fits. So here we go. Enjoy.

My compadres and I were apart of a biker gang in Southern California called the Grave Runners. We weren’t the biggest operation, but we were certain-fuckin’-ly aiming for it. My brother Trey cofounded the Runners with an old school, long bearded, no shit taking rider everyone called Croc back in 99’.

When I turned 18, my brother came to me and said, “Scott, get you’re bike. You’re rolling with us now.” And that was that. From then on, I was one of them, through and through.

That was back in May of 01’. I rode and bled for those wonderful bastards, and they did the same for me. Still would to this day… if anyone was left to ride with.

We moved plenty of product from the north border, all the way down the west coast, and down through to the southern border. We had agreements with some of the big dogs who ran the drug running show, so we didn’t often get fucked with by other groups. And when they did, well… they never showed their faces on our turf again, or anywhere else, for that matter. We were often contracted by clientele along the west coast to bring them their desired unlawful product of choice. 

Seven years later, we would be on top of the smuggler food chain. We served all sorts of rich assholes, government officials, hell we even brought in immigrants, for a price. Everyone and anyone who needed some bad shit moved, or even sometimes some decent but desperate folk, knew to come to us. That summer, we would receive a job that would change my life forever… it would topple that little empire we had carved out of this land for ourselves over the years.

The day was sweltering hot. Red and tan stones littered the sand strewn desert that surrounded one of our smaller hideouts. It used to be a gas station in the 50’s, but seeing how nobody was stupid enough to come out this way, it was long since abandoned. The blazing sun beat down on our fortress of solitude every damn day, peeling the lead paint and warping the abandoned, dust covered vehicles all around the property. 

I had been waiting for a client to show up, a no namer with promises of a huge payout if we succeed. The payment would set us up for life, and would provide a huge expansion to our business, and plenty of money for booze or guns. 

I was itching to get going, and I thought about just calling it off and heading out after a few hours of waiting. That’s when I saw her.

A scrawny woman covered in a dirty, tattered black robe. She stood partly behind the tall gas station sign out by the road. Her appearance was shaken… as if she had been roughed up on the way here. Her skin looked like it would be pale and loose, if she was not burnt from the sun and ragged from the winds. She limped on her left leg as she nervously wheezed and scattered forward, holding a small black box under her arms with care and unease as she shuffled at me surprisingly quickly. 

I waited as the sun beat down on us just overhead, the whole desert shining slight reflections from a sandstorm in the distance. Something felt off about her. She appeared to be hurt, obviously, but… Something about the way her eyes looked. She was sizing me up on the way over, I have seen the look a thousand times. So I kept cool, let her do the walking. She got to about thirty feet away, and stopped abruptly. Frail looking, freakishly long fingers grasped onto the underside of the box as she bent down to set it on the ground.

“No,” I shouted, “bring it to me, or the deal’s off.”

The strange woman stopped mid way, and slowly turned her head to me. In a shrieking voice that sounded like it was dragged against against sheet metal, she shrilled loudly over the coming winds, “Somehow, I doubt that, dearie.”

With that, she dropped the lock box and scurried off, out into the desert. She kept dragging her leg quickly out into the vast wasteland, right into a rumbling sandstorm that was quickly tearing it’s way towards me. 

I sighed slowly. Fucking junkie courier, is what I thought. Not wanting to get caught up in the sandstorm, I grabbed up the box and slung it into my pack. I hopped up on my bike and started riding south to try and avoid it altogether.

The storm ripped across the landscape and casted dark and impossibly long shadows across the sand of the now darkening desert, thrashing about rocks and the little plant life that we had out that way. I had seen plenty of shitty weather, but this… It was absolute madness. I felt a cold shiver down my spine in the searing heat as the darkness of the storm devoured the land, crawling with malicious intent in my direction. As I made it well out of reach of the storm, I looked back. 

I almost thought I could still see that crazy bitch, running though the storm. It looked like her, or whatever I saw, was being ripped apart slowly as it made its way through the hellish sands. It looked like flesh was being thrown into the wind and swirling bits of bone began to mix in with the howling winds.

When I got back to Trey, I didn’t even know what to tell him, to be honest. I knew going was a bad idea, fucking horrible, whether what I saw was real or not. But… I knew for sure if I told his ass, he would call me a pussy and go without me. So, like a dumbass, I rode out with him. I wish I stopped it all then and there…

On the ride from Cali to the deep and old marshes of Massachusetts, I kept track of the roads we took, mentally noting how easy it would be to move product along the side roads we took all the way there. The journey took us about a week, and I rode with four other members of the gang. All the big wigs of the bunch were here to check out the new prospective clients: Trey and Croc, of course, then there was Cid, he was our contact in the ATF, and Reggie, our top enforcer and quite charismatic with a shotgun.

We all dressed in normal motorcycle club attire, and our bikes were as tricked out as they can get. We had our Grave Runner insignia on our jackets, a skull with a gold tooth and a crack going down the front of it. We kept our weapons in a bag on Trey’s motorcycle, along with the package. We decided it wasn’t worth popping open that box, in case it was a bomb or a bio weapon, or a box of fuckin’ cancer gas, or who knows what. I knew deep down it wasn’t drugs, even though the woman who dropped it off had obviously been tweakin’. 

We knew we had arrived at the marsh before any sort of sign popped into view. The place we were headed was in a huge national park, an ancient marshland called Moongallow Nature Reserve. It’s old native land that goes relatively untouched, due to the hostile bullshit living in that marsh. In a little town nearest to our destination, I learned that the locals are too afraid to talk about that hell hole. At the time, I was pissed that everyone was so cowardly... I didn’t know any better. 

The locals watched our every move when we were in town. Most of them were missing digits, eyes, and some had this putrid flesh rot that started grow over their skin and seemed to slowly peel back at the surface in strange tendrils that snaked along their skin like rotted veins. They made the hairs along the back of my neck prick up as they stared at our convoy exiting town, towards the marsh. 

We knew we had arrived because the whole place had this ominous energy in the air. The smell of the decaying, blackened trees that littered the surrounding forests. The musty and somewhat yellow fog that hung high into the tree branches.

The sounds of splashes in the distance as unseen creepy crawlies slid into and out of the murky waters. It was like we left the old world and were driving our bikes straight into another realm. Croc and Trey took point, I road next to Cid, and Reggie rode in back. We tore through the wilderness and only stopped when we finally hit a stone and dirt path.

All of us parked our bikes behind some nearby trees. As soon as they were turned off, the sound of resting and chirping crickets and other insects droned against the quiet marsh waters and mud.

“It’s about fuckin’ time!” Reggie yelled out, causing some birds in the tree above us to flap and flutter quickly away. “I was gettin’ tired of sittin’ on my ass for once!”

We all looked at him, and Trey growled in a low and hushed voice, “You need to shut the fuck up. Now. Whispers from here on, boys,” As he said this, he unzipped the duffle bag that was strapped to his bike. From inside, he pulled out three Glocks, an Uzi, and a 12-gauge shotgun. He handed me the Uzi, and handed the shotgun to Reggie. Trey, Croc, and Cid got the Glocks. Trey kept the package in his duffle bag and slung it over his shoulder.

Croc grumbled in his old southern drawl and pointed at me, “Scott, you’re baby sittin’ Reggie here and y’all are taking six o’clock while we take point n’ make the delivery. Follow behind us bout’ a hundred feet or so. Far enough in the fog where someone n’ front of us won’t see’s ya.” 

Reggie furrowed his brow. “Babysit? Now listen here ya old bas-“ Before he could finish his sentence, Croc gave him a slap upside the back of his head that sent him stumbling for a moment.

We all chuckled, except Cid. I noticed he was staring into the fog, like he was trying to make sense of something in the distance. His hands held tightly to his Glock as he stared wordlessly into the slowly churning mists. I called to him. “Hey Cid, you alright man?”

Cid quickly snapped back to the situation at hand and spun around, nodding to me. “Yeah, yeah… I think I saw an animal out there or something.” He walked up to us and chambered his pistol, nodding towards the path we were about to tread.

“Well alright then,” Trey nodded as he spoke, “It’s time, gentlemen. Let’s move on.”

I don’t know how long we walked out into that desolate marshland. Hours, at least. Not a lot happened during this part of the walk. The air in the wilds made the hairs on my arm stand on end. It was unnaturally cold outside, even with the sun still high in the sky.

The fog overhead only showed us a spirit-like visage of the sun, a silhouette reminding us that we were not completely condemned to some strange alternate universe. I could barely see Trey and Croc walking ahead. Cid must have been in front of them, because I couldn’t see any sign of him through the thick fog.

After a couple hours of trudging through the muck and overgrowth, the sound of skittering splashes caught my attention to the left of us. It was just out of sight, whatever it was. And it seemed to be keeping pace with us. I used my walkie talkie and let the others ahead of us know we might have a stow away on our little expedition. The three others stopped and I silently signaled Reggie to move towards the sound while I watch his back.

Splashing sounds came from what felt like just out of view. The cold and moist air hung thick around us like a blanket that was just a little too thick, snuffing our lungs with the cloud of the slowly churning fog. The air was so cold and sharp, it almost felt like I was breathing in frozen flakes of metal with every slow breath I took. As Reggie and I moved towards the sound, it moved away, almost as if perfectly in step with us as we went. It never stopped. The fog began to thicken the further we went. We were ten yards or so into the marsh, and already the surreal yellow fog was twice as heavy as before.

I felt a bit strange thinking it… But it was almost as if the splashing noise drew closer with the fog, staying just outside my field of vision. A sickly sweet smell pierced through the fog as the splashing began picking up in a rhythmic pattern. Like someone was marching in place, and our arrival was it’s cue to speed up. We moved another ten yards until the fog’s edge was only about another fifteen feet away.

The splashing was just on the other side of the wall of mist in front of us… However, I made note that there were no waves being riled up in the water nearby. I looked over to find Reggie, but I guess the fog swallowed him up before we got there, because I couldn’t see him anywhere nearby. I only knew he was nearby because I heard his voice slice through the marsh with a strong 

“Stop right there, or I’ll shoot!”

The splashing stopped. For a few seconds, all I could hear was my breathing. Quickly, the splashing shot through the unseeable marshy depths, like a sprinting mad man just beyond sight was barreling through the water towards us.

Then an ear splitting KABOOM went off somewhere close to my right. 

The trees and water echoed a crackling and thunderous tone as Reggie’s shotgun went off. The sound of splintering wood and the angered grunts of Reggie came through the other end of the blast. I moved quickly to where the blast came from and found him, frowning as he looked down on what appeared to be a very bloodied and very dead goat. It had jet black fur that was half matted to it’s body from the marsh water. Two large curled horns protruded from the water, half sunken into the sludge-like liquid. It’s eyes were still open, a golden yellow color to them as they looked into our very souls. It had some sort of… Red paint or blood on it to form a strange symbol I had never seen before. It was three triangles intersecting by the middle corners with a crudely drawn eye in the middle. Looking at it sent a stinging chill down my spine.

Behind me, I heard the splashing of my brother and the others as they made their way to us. Reggie looked sternly at the dead animal and spoke quietly to me, “That wasn’t like any goat I saw before, Scott. It was… I thought he was a man before-“

Trey caught up to us and spoke out, “What the fuck happened? Now the whole swamp knows we’re coming!” Reggie pointed to the dead goat with his shotgun and Trey sighed. “You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me… Let’s get the fuck out of here and get this box dropped off.” Everyone turned and went back towards the path we had been taking. As I did, I stopped for a moment and looked around.

The goat still laid there, bleeding from the gaping wound in it’s neck. For a moment, I thought it was looking at me. As if the eyes were fixed to me as I went. And as it slipped out of view, I thought I heard a sliding and sloshing sound in the muck just beyond the fog wall. I didn’t even want to know… We had to get the hell out of there.

“Listen Trey,” I tried telling him, “Something really messed up is going on out here. I think we’re walking in to a trap.”

Trey scoffed and continued leading us through the marsh and towards our mark. He was never the type to take advice. “Alright, noted. Even if this is a trap, we’re going to go in. If they decide to fuck with us, they die. If not, we get the biggest payout of our lives, boys. Either way, this gets our name out there for anyone who needs to know that we’re not the guys to fuck with.” He was cocky, arrogant… a moron, if you will. But he was… is my big brother, and I’d be damned if I was going to leave him out there for any reason, come hell or high water.

We kept going for what felt like centuries but was probably only a couple of hours, when the sun started finally peeking through the seemingly endless fog clouds that loomed over us. We came to a clearing in the marsh. In the center  was an old willow tree that stood on a small bit of grass next to an old looking hut made of wood and thatch. The tree stood tall and wide over most of the clearing. It seemed so huge in the strangely visible area. 

The air here was thin and cold, like there was no heat from the sun, just a vacuum of some sort in the middle of a marshland.There was another rune painted on the tree’s trunk, this one in a dark green paste. It was an intricate lotus shaped emblem that almost seemed to glow by the sun’s rays. The nearby hut was moderately sized, it could easily house one or two people. It looked like it was made long ago, and was almost entirely covered in different runes and sigils. Some were a dark red color, others were purple. 

None of it really made sense at the time, but I’m almost certain that we were screwed the moment we stepped foot in that clearing. 

We finished sloshing our way through water and mud and finally stood on solid ground. Croc stepped forward first, he gave us a grin. “Well shit, maybe they weren’t lying’ after all gentlemen. Let’s me n’ Trey head up first and talk to the client. Watch our backs, if you can confirm us meeting with the client, good, but do not get fuckin’ seen, y’hear?” He gruffed at us like the old bastard he was, but I knew he and Trey could handle themselves. 

The two went forward and to the door of the hut while we hung back by the willow tree.I could barely see a figure inside when they lit a candle, but I lost fight as soon as the door closed. It looked like there was a very old man inside sitting at a table. I barely got a glimpse of him, but his skin looked like it hung low from his body. I felt like I already knew he smelled like decay or formaldehyde, or some shit like that.

About fifteen minutes go by and I start to get antsy. I don’t like waiting as is, but waiting here was just agonizing. I kept scanning the surrounding fog and the house, listening to Reggie and Cid discuss what they had seen thus far. Suddenly, a gun shot rang out. Followed by another, and a third shot, all coming from the hut. 

We bolted for it. Cid reached the door first, and scrambled into the small hut. Trey was clutching the box under one arm while he used his free hand to continue shooting at the old man who was standing next to his table in the middle of the room. Croc started shooting and backing towards the door, shouting “What in the god damn?!”

The old man was horrible to behold. His skin had begun peeling from the sinews inside of his body, and the smell alone could peel the paint from my motorcycle. Pasty white skin was dropping to the floor in clumps as the old man stood there, splashes of bloody viscera smacking against the old walls of the hut. The bullets didn’t even faze this asshole. 

As his body continued melting from his muscles and bones, he began to chant some sort of incantation in a deep and gurgled voice, choked up by his own melting flesh. As he did, the melted flesh seeped into the floorboards of the hut quickly. The old man’s body was twitching and rattling with putrid energy, and wheezing up thick purplish-black ichor as he kept his dark magic in motion.

Within seconds, skeletal hands with stringy strands of flesh were smashing through the weak floorboards. It looked like there was a basement or a pit below the hut. The floor began smashing apart as Trey and Croc quickly ran out the door. The rest of the inside of the hut collapsed as skeletal remains began being infused with the molded and rotting flesh that seeped out of that old man, or thing… Whatever the hell it was. The skeletons began clawing their way out of the huge hole one by one, causing the rest of the hut to collapse around them. 

They quickly recovered and dug their way out with wretched fleshy claws that protruded from their arms. The old one was now floating above the sunken pit as the last of his flesh fell into the pile of ancient remains. More corpses started to dig their way through the ground outside of the hut nearby. I felt my words getting caught in a lump in my throat as I tried to process the beings making their way towards us.

The sickly sweet scent of decay assaulted my nose and I wretched as I stepped back and began firing my uzi into an increasingly growing mob of the vile monsters. As if on cue, the others ran to my side and we continued firing into them as they crawled from the depths and began running in our direction. 

The skeletons were surprisingly quick, and a few closed the thirty foot gap before we could put lead in their bones. One got close enough to slice at Cid, who was just to my left. He screamed in agony as the flesh blade pierced his arm, and he instantly went to the ground. Reggie put a shell through the monster’s head and it exploded into the muck below our boots.

I kept shooting, but out of the corner of my eye I could see Cid was writhing in agony in the mud. It almost looked like he was having a seizure. I turned to look at him and go help him, but I noticed right away that it wasn’t going to happen. Cid’s face was twisted in an animalistic fury with bloodshot eyes that stared into my very core. His arms began to bubble and almost fold in on themselves as two long and sharp bone blades ripped through his skin with a sickening snap and a fleshy squirt of viscera. His features contorted and elongated, his knees buckled backwards and his body started shambling towards me, blood and spit flying from his mouth. I turned and gunned him down with the uzi. It took most of a mag to put him down, and for a moment I didn’t think he would go down at all. 

Even after hitting the ground, I could see his eyes were rolling in an inhuman fury and he was trying to regain his balance and get up for another attack. I could feel sweat pouring down my face as my heart tried to pound through my ribcage. I had never seen anything like this in my entire life. More zombie-like beings were piling up around us as we backed up towards the center tree in the clearing.

Over the clambering of monsters and gunshots we heard the old man’s voice call out from the trees and skies, “Give me the artifact, foolish traitors. You know not what you now possess.”

I looked over at my brother while I popped another mag into my gun, shouting in disbelief as we fended off this unholy hell spawn, “What the FUCK did you do in there, asshole!” If I had known that was the last time I was going to talk to him, I would have said something entirely different. 

As the last word left my lips, I heard a gunshot go off in the distance. My brother’s head blew up like a fuckin’ cantaloupe getting hit by a sledgehammer. I almost vomited right then. I could see figures approaching us from all sides of the trees. More gunshots went off, and the horde began to fall apart under the new shots. 

The monstrous form of the old one, now almost fleshless, was mostly a skeletal abomination with lines of sludge-like muscle keeping him moving. Two meaty and glistening white orbs stuck out of his eye sockets, and the air around us started tasting like copper as it bled across the basement floor of the hut. 

He began taking fire from some distant gunmen, and with a disgusting noise, like the hiss of a snake crossed with a wet and guttural jackal scream, the monster chanted out some sort of words in an old language and just exploded into light and vanished into dust that floated off into the wind.

A group of the locals that we had came across earlier had come by while we were in our scuffle. They were all dressed for cold weather and packing some serious guns. Some guys had .50 cals on them, and I couldn’t help but think they brought it just for that nasty old monster in it’s hut. 

I walked right up to the woman who was giving commands, but before I could say a word, I was being grabbed by a few of her henchmen and being dragged to the tree we were retreating towards. I saw they had Croc and Reggie surrounded, but the two decided to surrender. At this point, we were out numbered thirty to one. Some of the villagers were repeatedly putting down the crowd of twenty or so ghouls as they continuously reanimated every time they were killed. Men with flamethrowers were approaching the horde as the others corralled my friends and I against the tree.

The woman I had approached earlier began speaking to the villagers in another language, I think it was Dutch they were speaking, looking back, but they all followed her command without question. She looked like she was beautiful once. 

She looked to be in her early thirties, but it was hard to tell, given that she had one of those wretched flesh infections across her face. A mass of black, dripping tentacles protruded from her right eye socket, the rotted meat dripping in tiny bits from it occasionally as she spoke. The tendrils reached down the side of  her neck and went below her leather coat. I gagged as I saw what appeared to be a monstrous, pasty yellow eye tucked in the folds of the growth of what must be pure evil itself. Even from a distance the sight of her was enough to give you nightmares.

I wanted so badly to be speechless. But these fuckers killed my brother. So I yelled at the bitch, “I want whoever shot my brother out here right now. I don’t care who the fuck you people are, someone’s going to pay!”
