Hello ya'll, i'll try and keep on track as best as I can.

I work for an armed security company. We handle normal contracts along with the oddball contracts that nobody ever wants to pick up, which happens quite often. I've been working here for about a month now, and i've been encouraged by family and friends to share my experiences with you all. 

To start this off, i'm no small girl, i'm 5'11 and grew up on a farm. After my parents kicked me out at the ripe age of 18, I had been bouncing from job to job for a while, going from blue collar to working in an office, taking calls and helping customers.  However, due to my supervisor being a dick over a comment i made to a rude customer, i was let go. It wasn't even that bad. After this,  I went on craigslist to look for a better job, when this offer caught my eye: 

"Wanted: Nightshift Armed Security Guard.
Needing a reliable officer that can follow simple rules and be able to react to threats calmly.
Hours will be 5:30 P.M to 6:30 A.M. Monday-Friday. Overtime is 2.5x. Hourly rate: 35/hr. CALL: 889-332-8976" 

I couldn't believe my eyes when i saw the ad, and i quickly called the number to schedule an interview. A tired voice picked up, and the call went as follows: 

Me: "Hello, my name is Samantha, and i was wondering if the position for your nightshift security was still available?"

The man introduced himself as James, head of security, then followed up with: "Ah yes, we need a new hire, and fast. I have a couple questions before we get started, if you don't mind." 

Me: "Go right ahead, i'm an open book"

J: "Question one, are you a felon or have a violent criminal history?"  I replied to the negative, and he continued: "Question 2: Have you, at any time, had or have panic attacks or any type of PTSD?"

I answered to the negative again. He said that I could come to the site for an in-person interview, and asked if i owned my own gun. I answered to the affirmative, and he gave me the address, telling me to go to a little grey metal shed near the building. 

James seemed normal while i was speaking with him, so i didn't have any real suspicions until i put in the address on my laptop. It came up as an old nursing home, still semi-active. I asked if it was the right place, and he told me yes, that it was just a little run down due to no contractors being able to fix the outside. As we were wrapping things up,   he told me to be there a little bit before 5:30, as he did not want to conduct an interview past sundown. I thank him for his time and give my goodbyes, then end the call. Something just felt off though, so I decided to bring along my .45 just to be safe, in case this offer ended up like those craigslist stories. 5:00 rolled around rather quick, so i got ready and hopped in my car and started driving, thinking about what if it ended up being a ruse. Keeping my thoughts down, i'd resolved to just stick it out. I turned down a gravel path, looking around as i pulled up to the property after 20 minutes of driving. Fields of grass surrounded this place, the main building and a concrete parking lot being the only real civilization for miles. The nursing home was a bit more run down than it looked, the once proud red bricks now faded to a sickly pink, the windows dirty on the outside with vines growing up around them. It gave the whole property the impression of both rustic and ill-cared for. Looking sround some more,  I spotted a few beat up cars in the lot, the only newer one there had the security company's logo on the side. Waiting for a second, i took a deep breath,  got out of my car, and saw one of the nursing staff still in the building looking out at me through one of the filthy windows, staring as if surprised i came out there. 


I breathed a sigh, and made my way to the little grey building a little ways away. Once there i got this eerie feeling that maybe i should turn around and go home. However, i mustered up some courage, and I knocked on the door. The same voice that i heard earlier, rang out with a cold: "Who's there?"  I replied with: "It's me, Samantha, your new hire".  

After a few minutes, the lock clicked open, the door swinging open to reveal a short and stocky man in a security guard's uniform. His beady eyes locked onto me as if trying to set me on fire. 

Me: "James, right?"

The man squinted at me, then nodded his head, motioning for me to come inside. I stepped onto the shed, and saw a table with two office chairs on either side, a monitor on the same wall as a window with a black desk underneath it. He pointed at an office chair and told me to have a seat.

James then placed a contract in front of me that read as follows: 

"Dear employee, thank you for choosing T.S.S as your employer. Our number one priority is the customers we serve. Due to the nature of this occupation, T.S.S will be waived of all liability on the date signed below.  You will be paid 35 dollars an hour, non negotiable. Your overtime will be 2.5 times for every hour over 40 you reach. 

Hours are: 5:30 P.M to 6:30 A.M, a total of 13 hours. Monday-Friday. 

Calling in sick is encouraged, as any slight in your perception could have dire consequences.

If this system is abused, you will be immediately terminated without investigation.  Other forms of time off must be made 2 weeks in advance except for; Loss of family member OR Loss of Signifigant other. This will fall under sick leave.

Thank you for choosing T.S.S, 

[REDACTED]"

I looked up at James, and found that his steel-like eyes were locked onto me, waiting with baited breath to see if i would sign.  I grabbed the pen out of my pocket, and signed on the dotted line.

James then snatched the paper from the table and filed it, briskly walking to his file cabinet, then a tall metal cabinet. He opened the creaking door, then started pulling a uniform out from it, it looking the exact same as his. A grey long sleeved service shirt, black combat pants, and a vest with the company's logo on the front and back.  He set my new clothes on the table in a small pile, along with a duty belt and combat boots.  Briskly walking over to the door, he tells me to put the clothes on, as he's out of time to leave. His worried expression being reflected in the black metal of the door. He looks back at me for a second, and says:  "There's a binder on the desk. Read it, it may end up saving your ass."

I shot him a puzzled look, then looked at the desk, then back at the doorway. When i looked at the doorway, he's gone. I called out to him: "Hey dude, i know there's a hidden camera. If you wanted to see my tits, you coulda just asked."  Complete, eerie silence. Realizing he was actuslly gone, I criticized myself, then brushed my feelings off, and started getting changed after locking the door. Once i got my gear on, i sat down at the desk nearby, and opened the binder.

The first page was the company logo, and then an introduction letter, saying when, where, and who founded the country, along with other boring items. Then i flipped to the second page, and it read: "Duties of a Nightshift T.S.S Officer. 
1. Any and all residents should remain inside unless cleared to do so by nursing staff. Failure to follow this directive will cause immense discomfort and possibly death to either you or the resident. 
2. Between the hours of 5:30 PM and 6:30 PM, any persons entering the property will remain completely safe. 

3. Your morning relief will arrive no later than 7:00 A.M, but no earlier than 6:15 A.M. If you hear a knock on the door between these times, and see a figure dressed in your uniform, do not open the door under any circumstances. Lock the door and kill the main lights, it will go away if he thinks you're not in there. 

If you fail to shut the lights off before it notices you, or you do open the door, draw your pistol and swifly shoot yourself in the side of the head. Trust us, it's far better than what it has in store for you.

4. Under no circumstances will you enter the nursing home with your weapon out or holster unclipped. You may draw it once you enter, but no sooner. One of our residents WILL surprise you and wrangle your gun away if you fail to follow this directive. He has an uncanny sense of strength, and has hurt several personel. 

5. Monitor the cameras for any static. 
if you see any static, respond to the location immediately with force and shoot the doctor. It is not a doctor, and it will kill the patient if given the chance. The main door access code is 6676

6. If you see a duplicate number on this sheet at any time, do NOT follow the latter of them. This is one of the entities trying to get you killed. 

6. Rush into the nursing home and open fire on any nurses you see. They are trying to kill the residents, and do not put out static. 

I glance at the sheet again, blinking hard, seeing the duplicate disappear. "Well, starting early. I like that in a coworker.", i think to myself, half joking.

I was about to call out to the empty room, but something stopped me. A slight tapping noise, coming from the main door. I froze for a second, then quickly slid my way over to the door, hitting the lightswitch and locking the door as quietly as possible. I looked out of the peephole, and there stood a pizza delivery driver, looking confused as all hell. I was about to open the door, but heard the entity speak, its english broken and monotone: "Have pizza, why you closed? I guess i go back to pizza factory."

I wanted to crack a joke at him, but something deep inside me indicated that would be a grave error.  I looked back out of the peephole, and the entity's eyes had changed to completely black, letting out one final sentence before vanishing: "Pizza no cost money, only cost your soul."

I don't know why i didn't leave right then and there, or why i haven't at all yet. Something keeps luring me back here. I think it's called...money?

A few hours passed with no event, just me listening to supernatural on netflix, my eyes focued on the camera monitor, when i spotted one of the cameras flickering with static, just barely visible. I checked the room number, 22, and went to go into the building, when something caught my eye. Rule 4. I quickly holstered my gun and locked the holster, then sprinted to the door, basically punching in the access code. I booked it down the hall, my breath getting shorter and shorter, when i finally hit room 22. I readied my gun, and tried the handle. Locked.  I stepped back, then swiftly put my boot to the door's lock area, causing it to swing wide open. 

The scene i saw before me was actually kind of funny, a resident was weirdly happy, and the entity was dressed as a mix between a clown and a doctor. It turned to me as the door flew open, and it was the same damn face from before. I joked with the beast, saying: " damn dude, how many jobs do you have? Like, i know the economy's tough, but shit man."  

As soon as those words left my lips, he held up 4 fingers, then put down his other ones so that the middle remained. I quickly called him rude, then shot the bastard twice. He teetered for a second, then fell to the floor, disappearing in a cloud of dust once he hit the tile.   

I walked over to the resident, checking her over for any wounds. She thanked me, and told me that i was a good child. I blushed, of course, and quickly walked out of the room. As soon as i crossed the doorway, one of the charge nurses stopped me in the hallway. It was a pale and petite blonde gal that just looked awfully familiar, i couldn't place where i'd seen her before. Anyways, i ignored the blatant deja-vu, and introduced myself. She returned my gesture and said her name was Charlie.  Then she asked me a phrase in latin, to which i give her a bewildered look.  "Uh...run that by me again...in english ?"  

Charlie's face relaxed, and apologized for the weird phrase, as she has her own directives to follow.  

"No way? I found a rule list in my office..er, shed ..whatever you want to call it. Thought it was a joke until i saw the duplicate. " i sighed out of fatigue and boredom, then asked if she had any coffee or something of the sort.  

She replied: "No, i do have these smelling salts though. Keeps my mind awake and doesn't make me shit myself. I have a couple of spares if you want them. "  I told her that would be amazing, and followed her to the nursing staff's locker room. The more we walked, the more i realised something was a bit off about Charlie. 

Being the gentlewoman i am, i asked if she was alright. She stopped and became stiff, then answered in a cold tone: "Yes, why would i not be? Is there something you're expecting?"  I answered no, and told her that maybe i can do without the smelling salts, when she turned and locked eyes with me. 

"You know i'm not human, don't you?" 

Before i could get out a, "Well i kinda fuckin figured", she resumed: 

"Look, Sam. I'm lonely, and probably your only ally here. If you're even just slightly nice to me, i promise it'll pay off.  Your shifts will not have anything to put you or anybody else in peril.  As long as you're nice, nobody dies or gets hurt.  Do we have a deal?"

I sat there for a second in shocked silence, then slowly nodded my head, extending my hand for a handshake.  She took my hand with a grip like steel and skin lukewarm. 
Charlie turned her head and smiled at me, giving me a kiss on the cheek, her lips slightly burning my skin. She then whispered in my ear: "It's 6:00, you should really get back to your office."

I looked at my watch, and sure as shit, 6:00. I said my goodbyes to her and made my way outside, the sun slowly peaking over the hill. I get inside, and my last 30 minutes tick by like nothing. 


Thank ya'll for reading, and stay tuned to learn about the tit-vines and other weird entities.
