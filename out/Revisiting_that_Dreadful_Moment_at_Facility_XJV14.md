I must have fallen asleep after finishing my report, as I woke up in my bed surrounded by paramedics. The familiar faces of my dormitory neighbors peered in from the doorway, their expressions a mix of concern and curiosity. Several people had heard loud screams coming from my room.

“I could be having night terrors,” I said to one of the paramedics. “Though it’s been years since I had them.”

“It’s possible,” replied a female paramedic. “I recommend you see Dr. Siti on the seventh floor. She might help you understand what’s happening.”

I nodded. “I don’t remember any dream prior to waking up, though.”

“It’s common not to remember dreams,” she replied. “We’ll send a report to Saed. We recommend at least three days of rest before continuing your work. You seem physically fine to me.”

I sighed in relief.

As she and her colleagues were about to leave, she paused and said, “I read the incident report involving you and patient 20134. I can't imagine having to make the decision you did, even though it was necessary. I hope you feel better soon. You had no choice.”

Then they left. I kept thinking about what she said and fell asleep again, somewhat comforted by her words.

The next day, I called Saed to inform him that I would visit Dr. Siti for an overall assessment. He agreed and suggested I take at least five days of rest. I thanked him and insisted that three days would be sufficient.

As I exited my room, searching for the elevator, I heard a loud bang behind me, almost like a gunshot. I ran to the nearest corner and hid. When I peeked around, I saw nothing—just people going about their day.

I relaxed a bit, thinking it must have been an auditory illusion. I should mention that to Dr. Siti.

The elevator ride to the seventh floor felt interminable. Each floor dinged by slowly, giving me too much time to dwell on recent events. When the doors finally opened, I stepped into a quiet, dimly lit hallway. The air was cool, and the soft hum of the ventilation system was the only sound.

I found Dr. Siti’s office and knocked gently. A soft voice invited me in.

As I entered, I found myself in a space that bore no resemblance to a doctor's office. The walls were sterile white, illuminated by cold ceiling lights. There was no desk or chair—only a bed in the corner. As I turned around, thinking I must have entered the wrong room, I noticed there was no door.

“How did I get in here?” I whispered to myself.

I tried to calm myself, wondering if some external force was playing tricks on my mind. Then I heard those damned words coming from behind me.

*I am so sorry.*

I turned around in shock, only to find that the bed in the corner had disappeared. The words echoed again.

*I am so sorry.*

I spun around once more, only to find myself in a typical office setting, standing in front of a middle-aged woman at her desk. She smiled and gestured for me to sit down.

“Have a seat,” she said warmly. “My name is Dr. Siti. I read the reports from the paramedics, Saed, and Cecilia. I see that you have been through a lot.”

I kept silent, looking down at my fingers. I didn’t know whether to trust my surroundings. Everything felt off, like a distorted reflection of reality. Yet, the familiar sensation of my fingers grounding me provided a small anchor amid the confusion.

“It’s okay,” she continued. “You are in a safe place here. No human can harm you.”

I maintained my silence, still unsure of what was real.

“How have you been coping with everything?” she inquired gently.

“Not great. Not great at all,” I replied, finally sitting down and breaking my silence.

“Good,” she said with a smile. “Well, good that you finally spoke to me. Not great for what you experienced.”

She paused, giving me time to gather my thoughts. “Do you want to talk about your experiences? Are you ready?”

“I guess so,” I said hesitantly.

I paused, trying to find the right words. “It was my first day in my new role here at Facility XJV-14. I was to replace the senior technician who relocated to a new facility. My first assignment was to assess patient 20134. I—”

*I am so sorry.*

I stopped, my eyes wide open, searching for the source of those accursed words.

“Is something wrong?” Dr. Siti inquired with a worried look.

“I thought I heard something,” I replied, my voice trembling.

*I am so sorry.*

The words seemed to come from her, but her mouth hadn’t moved, and the voice didn’t match hers.

“Is that what you heard?” Dr. Siti asked, her expression calm but curious.

I looked at her, puzzled by her question.

“Is it, 'I am so sorry'?” she said with a knowing smile.

I stood up, suddenly in shock while locking my gaze with hers.

She kept smiling as she spoke, “Why did you do it? Why did you murder one of us? My own kind?”

“I… I had no choice,” I replied, trembling, while slowly walking backward towards the office exit.

“You definitely did. There was another choice,” she continued, still smiling. “How do you plan to repent for your terrible sin? How do you plan to seek forgiveness for a life stolen by you?”

She paused, her smile unwavering, her gaze locked onto mine.

I turned and tried to sprint for the door, only to find myself facing Dr. Siti. She was right in front of me.

I stumbled backwards to the floor, shocked by her sudden appearance.

“Let’s see. Ah yes. Let’s revisit that moment, shall we?” she said, her voice dripping with malice.

The room around me began to warp and twist, the walls melting away to reveal the scene of the incident with patient 20134. I was back in that room, the air thick with tension and fear. Dmitri was there, his body rigid and unresponsive, and Cecilia was frozen in place, her eyes wide with terror.

I could feel the weight of something cold and heavy in my hand. The patient’s crystalline form shimmered before me, and a sense of déjà vu washed over me, filling me with dread.

“No,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “Not again.”

I dropped the gun, closed my eyes, and covered my face, holding my tears at bay.

“This can’t be real,” I said, trying to reassure myself.

*Oh. But it is.*

I opened my eyes, staring at myself—or someone who looked exactly like me—holding the gun pressed against the patient’s forehead.

“You did it before. Let’s do it again.” My clone stared at me intently before shifting its gaze to the patient. Its expression changed to one of regret and remorse.

“I am so sorry,” it said to the patient. Then it cocked the pistol and shot the patient right in the forehead.

I looked away, screaming in terror, letting out a violent sob.

“You didn’t like that, did you? Then why did you do it?” its voice inquired upon my dreadful decision.

“I… had… no choice,” I replied, trembling and crying.

“But you did. Let’s do it again, shall we?” it said to me.

I didn’t turn around to see. I could hear it say those accursed words, *I am so sorry*, then the cocking of the pistol, followed by the awful sound of a gunshot that echoed through the sterile room.

“Let’s do it again,” it said.

It replayed the same sequence of events that I didn’t want to relive. Over and over, the nightmare repeated, each iteration more harrowing than the last. The relentless cycle of horror seemed endless.

Finally, in a burst of anger, I turned around and yelled, “What do you want from me?!”

The clone shot the pistol at the patient’s forehead, then looked at me. It smiled and said, “To repent.”

It walked towards me and slowly changed its form to Dmitri.

“I need you to repent,” it said, its voice eerily calm as it placed a small, cold object in my right hand.

I found myself staring at the object. It was a small black crystal, beautiful yet perplexing.

“But how?” I said, my voice trembling with desperation.

As I looked up, interrupting my examination of the crystal, I found myself standing right in front of Dr. Siti’s office. The transition was so abrupt that it left me disoriented, my mind struggling to grasp the reality of my surroundings.

I looked around, unsure of what I was seeing. The walls were the familiar sterile white, just like every other room I had been in during my time here. The cold, clinical atmosphere of the facility seemed to press in on me from all sides, a sensation I had grown accustomed to over the few days since my arrival. I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself, but the weight of the crystal in my hand told me otherwise.

No. It was real.

I could hear faint footsteps behind me, walking away. It looked like a tall fellow in a security uniform, his back facing towards me. Somehow, he looked familiar.

My thoughts were interrupted when I heard that same soft voice behind the door, inviting me in.

I stood still, trembling. Thinking.

*Should I accept the terrible sin that I have committed? Or seek forgiveness through this black crystal?*
