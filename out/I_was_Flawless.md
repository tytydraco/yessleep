I was never pretty. I wasn’t ugly, just plain. My skin was dull, my features unremarkable, my lips too thin. I spent years trying every beauty product I could find, but nothing worked. The girls on social media looked effortless, with dewy skin, full lips, and perfect symmetry. No matter how much I tried to copy them, I always fell short. Then I found the ad. It popped up on my feed late at night, a sleek black jar with gold lettering: FLAWLESS Beauty Beyond Imagination The model in the video looked unreal. Her skin was porcelain-smooth, her cheekbones razor-sharp. The way she smiled, it was like she wasn’t even real, like she was sculpted by some divine hand. The ad claimed it wasn’t just makeup. It enhanced you, bringing out your “true, perfect self. ” The website had no reviews, no social media pages, no brand history. Just a BUY NOW button. It was expensive, $250 for one jar, but I didn’t care. I clicked the button.

The package arrived two days later. The jar was heavier than expected, the black and gold design giving it an almost ancient feel. Inside was a thick, glossy cream, dark-like ink. It had no scent. When I touched it, it clung to my fingers, cool and silky. I smoothed a thin layer over my face. The moment it touched my skin, it sank in, like it was absorbing into my pores. A tingling sensation spread over my cheeks, my lips, and my forehead. I rushed to the mirror. And I gasped. My skin glowed. Every imperfection vanished, no redness, no pores, no dullness. My lips looked fuller, my cheekbones sharper. My face was still mine but perfected. I looked beautiful. For the first time in my life, I felt seen.

On day 2, the next morning, I expected to wake up to my normal, boring face. But when I peeled back the blankets and shuffled to the mirror, I was still perfect. The cream hadn’t smudged, hadn’t faded. My skin was still flawless. My lips were still full. My reflection was breathtaking. I didn’t question it. I went about my day, basking in the stares, and the compliments. “You look amazing. ” “What’s different about you? ” “I can’t stop looking at you. ” I was addicted. That night, I applied another layer before bed. It sank in faster this time.

On day 3 something was wrong. When I woke up, my skin felt tight, like my face was shrinking. I stumbled to the mirror and nearly screamed. My features were too sharp. My cheekbones jutted out unnaturally. My lips were too full, stretched over my teeth. My skin was too smooth, too plastic-like. I touched my cheek and felt a sickening resistance, like pressing on something that wasn’t quite skin. Panic twisted in my gut. I grabbed a washcloth, scrubbing desperately, but the cream wouldn’t budge. It wasn’t sitting on my skin anymore. It was part of me. My phone buzzed, a text from my best friend, Mara,  “Hey, are you okay? Your face looked kinda… different yesterday. ” I wanted to tell her. I wanted to ask for help. But another text came through before I could reply. Mara, “Actually… can I be honest? You looked amazing. I’ve never seen you so confident. ” I stared at the screen. My fingers hovered over the keyboard. Then I caught my reflection again. I was beautiful. Maybe I was overreacting. Maybe it was just an adjustment phase. I smoothed another layer over my face.

On day 6, at work, people kept staring. But it wasn’t admiration anymore. It was… unease. Mara, who had complimented me just days before, barely made eye contact. My boss hesitated before speaking to me, his expression tight. At lunch, I overheard whispers. “She looks different. ” “Yeah, but not in a good way. ” “Like… uncanny. Like she’s trying too hard to be perfect. ” The words should have hurt, but they didn’t. Because when I looked in the mirror, I knew I was beautiful. They were just jealous. That night, I applied another layer.

 On day 7 I didn’t leave my apartment. Not because I was scared, no, not at all. But because the world outside didn’t deserve to see me yet. Not until I was complete. Perfect and flawless.I spent the morning in front of the mirror, watching myself. Not just checking my reflection, I mean watching. Admiring. My cheekbones, my lips, my impossibly smooth skin. Every angle was perfect. Symmetrical. But the longer I stared, the more incomplete I felt. There was still something wrong. Something is missing.
    
I grabbed my phone, flipping through my old photos. The ones from before. The ugly ones. My skin is uneven and textured. My lips are thin and colorless. My nose is slightly off-center. My stomach twisted in disgust. Had I really let people see me like that? Had I really lived like that? How had I ever thought I was enough? A ding snapped me out of my thoughts. A text from Mara, “Hey. I’m really worried about you. Please talk to me.” I rolled my eyes. She just didn’t understand. No one did. People feared what they couldn’t have. What they couldn’t achieve. My fingers hovered over the keyboard. I could invite her over. Show her. Maybe even let her try it. If she just saw, she’d understand.

On day 8  I didn’t respond to Mara’s text. I didn’t need to. She was coming whether I wanted her to or not. But that was fine. I had nothing to hide. I used the extra time to perfect myself. I sat at my vanity, the dim light casting a soft glow over my features. The jar of Flawless sat beside me, a silent promise, a gift I had been chosen to receive. I traced my fingers over my face, feeling the unnatural smoothness, the way my skin no longer had warmth. The way my reflection seemed to move a fraction of a second behind me. But I didn’t care. The world had spent years ignoring me, overlooking me, treating me like I was nothing. And now? Now they couldn’t look away. I dipped my fingers into the jar again, scooping out another layer. The cream pulsed against my fingertips, cool and thick, almost eager. My breath hitched as I smoothed it over my cheekbones, down my jawline, across my lips. The sensation was intoxicating. The more I applied, the less human I felt, but the more perfect I became.

A knock at the door jolted me from my trance. Mara. I turned to the mirror one last time, adjusting my smile. It was perfect. Not too wide, not too forced, just enough to seem normal. I opened the door. Mara gasped. “Oh my God,” she whispered, stepping back. I tilted my head, feigning innocence. “What’s wrong? ” Her eyes darted over my face, her throat working as she swallowed hard. “You… you don’t look right. ” I smiled wider. “You said I looked amazing before. ” Mara hesitated. “Yeah, but… something’s different now. ” Her voice lowered. “You look like a… like a doll. Like something trying to be human. ” A flash of irritation rippled through me. Jealousy. That’s what it was. She was jealous. I stepped closer. “You’re just not used to seeing perfection up close. ” Mara flinched. “Jesus, Sam, listen to yourself.” She grabbed my wrist. Her fingers were warm. Too warm. “Whatever this is, you need to stop. Wash it off. Get help. ” I stared at her hand on my wrist. Her skin was textured. Uneven. Flawed. Disgusting. I yanked my arm away. “You don’t get it,” I said, my voice sharp. “I don’t need help. I’ve never been better. ” Mara’s eyes darkened with something I couldn’t place. Pity? Fear? Disgust?

She reached into her pocket, pulling out her phone. “I’m calling someone. ” My entire body stiffened. “No, you’re not. ” I moved without thinking. Fast. Too fast. Before she could react, I knocked the phone from her hands. It hit the floor with a sharp crack. Mara gasped, stumbling back. “What the hell is wrong with you? ” I didn’t answer. My gaze had fallen to my reflection in the hallway mirror. I swallowed hard, Mara bent to grab her phone. “i-im leaving,” she stammered. My fingers twitched. I couldn’t let her leave. She’d tell someone. She’d ruin everything. “You don’t need her. ” The whisper wasn’t just in the mirror this time. It was in my head. In my blood. I stepped forward. “Mara, wait.”

My voice was too smooth. Not quite my own. She froze. I reached for her, but a sharp, blinding pain shot through my skull. I screamed. My knees buckled, hands flying to my head. It felt like something inside me was splitting apart, tearing at the seams. Through my blurred vision, I saw Mara, eyes wide with horror. And then, a small, thin crack formed along my jawline. My skin split. I choked back another scream, scrambling to the mirror. The crack spread, curling upward, flaking at the edges like dried paint. Like a mask breaking apart. My breath came in short, ragged gasps. Beneath the perfect, flawless skin, I saw it, the black void. It wasn’t flesh. It wasn’t skin. It was nothingness. Mara was saying something, but I couldn’t hear her over the blood rushing in my ears. I pressed a trembling hand to my cheek, and felt the way the surface shifted, the way it resisted like something unnatural. Like something not human. I turned to Mara, desperation clawing up my throat. “Help me,” I whispered. Her face twisted with horror. “Oh my God,” she breathed. And then she ran. I didn’t stop her. I couldn’t.

I got up and my hands shook as I grabbed the jar. My fingers, now smooth and void-like, curled around the lid. I needed to destroy it. But then A memory surfaced. The cream had sunk in the moment I applied it. It became part of me. So maybe, it could be drawn out. I scrambled to my bathroom, knocking over bottles and brushes, searching for something, anything to cleanse myself. I turned the shower on full blast, scalding hot, and stepped under the water. The heat burned against my hollow skin, but I felt nothing. I grabbed my old exfoliating scrub, the roughest one I had. A last resort for bad breakouts. I squeezed it into my hands and scrubbed hard. The first layer was peeled away in thin, black strips. A sick, oily residue sloughed off my arms, my neck, and my face. I scrubbed harder, my fingers raw and frantic. The water running down the drain turned black. The voice in my head screamed. “No! You need me! You’ll be nothing without me! ” But it was wrong. I had been me before this. It could be me again. I kept scrubbing. The black void beneath my skin cracked, the emptiness splitting apart. And then something gave way. A sharp, searing pain shot through my body. My vision blurred. My knees buckled, and I collapsed onto the shower floor.

On day 10 I woke up in bed, tangled in damp sheets. For the first time in days, I felt real. I rushed to the mirror, my heart hammering. My face stared back at me. My face. My skin wasn’t perfect anymore. My lips were thinner again. My cheekbones weren’t unnaturally sculpted. I ran my fingers over my cheeks, and they felt warm. Soft, human tears welled in my eyes. I didn’t care that I wasn’t flawless. I was me again. I ran back to the bathroom, expecting to see traces of the black substance in the shower. But the water had washed it all away. Only the jar remained on the counter. I hesitated before grabbing it. The black cream inside was still. Lifeless. I took it outside, pried off the lid, and poured the contents onto the dirt. The thick, inky substance oozed out, but instead of soaking into the earth, it just evaporated, like it had never existed at all. I buried the empty jar deep in the trash and didn’t look back.

Day 30 It’s been a month. The whispers in my head are gone. My skin still has its imperfections, little scars, and uneven texture. But I don’t care. I don’t need to be flawless. Yesterday, I deleted all my beauty apps, and unfollowed every influencer that made me feel like I wasn’t enough. And for the first time in years, I looked in the mirror,

and smiled.
