Hi. My name is Martin. I am living with my small family in this village sice my birth. It was very nice then, but nowadays it is becoming more n more left out. I usually being seen that people from our village are leaving homes and our village is becoming abandoned day by day. Whenever I ask my father about this, he just rugs off the topic saying it's because of trauma they are going through. But, he never explains about it.
In last week, a girl nearly about my age moved in at our neighbourhood. I was very excited to meet and greet them, but my father strictly said me that I can't be allowed to do so. I was upset and went upstairs crying. After 2 days, I heard my father talking to our front home neighbour Mr.Rex. He was saying that next door family looks kind-a-different and not familiar with ourselves. I thought that father was thinking too much. But...
the next day, when I was playing on terrace with marbles, I heard scream of that girl. I saw that while doing some garden work, she had an injury and blood was oozing out of wound. I could see that she was feeling pain....I ran down immediately and was thinking continuously," Yes dad..you were right..! They're Different.. They're Alive...!"
 My friend Sam told upto this...and said, " I can guess that you've imagined what will happen next...!" 
I took a deep breath and started the story to bring it at alternate ending with a suspense at end....
"I rushed downstairs, excitement mixed with concern," Martin thought. "Father's warnings, Mr. Rex's whispers, and now this... What does it mean?"

Martin's father, John, looked up from his book, eyes narrowing. "What's going on, son?"

"The girl... she's hurt," Martin exclaimed. "I saw blood."

John's expression changed from calm to alarmed. "Stay back, Martin. I'll handle this."

Martin hesitated, but his curiosity got the better of him. He followed John to the neighbor's house.

As they entered, Martin saw the girl, Emily, holding her wounded hand. Her eyes locked onto Martin's, and he felt an unsettling connection.

John quickly took charge, applying a strange, pungent liquid to Emily's wound. The bleeding stopped, and Emily's pain seemed to ease.

"Thank you, Mr. John," Emily said, her voice low and mysterious.

Martin sensed something off. "How did you...?" he began.

Emily's gaze silenced him. "It's just a scratch," she said.

Martin's mind reeled. What was happening? Why did his father know what to do?

That night, Martin snuck out to investigate. He crept to Emily's house, finding her in the garden.

"Emily, what's going on?" Martin asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Emily turned, her eyes glowing in the dark. "We're not like them, Martin," she whispered. "We're... different."

Martin's heart pounded. "What do you mean?"

Emily's smile sent shivers down Martin's spine. "You'll see," she said.

As Martin turned to leave, he noticed something. Emily's wound had healed. Completely.

"Emily, your hand..." Martin stammered.

Emily's eyes gleamed. "We heal fast," she said.

Martin's world shifted. What secrets lay hidden in this village...?
