You get used to strange calls when you work in the sticks.

I’ve been a deputy for Travis County going on twelve years. The area we cover is mostly farmland, pine woods, and the kind of rural sprawl where someone can disappear and not be found for weeks. We’ve got four towns and more livestock than people. The roads out here are quiet—until they’re not.

Last week started like any other. I was sitting in my cruiser eating a gas station sandwich and listening to a scanner call about some teenagers throwing rocks at a highway sign when dispatch patched me something else. A possible missing child. Six years old. Property out near Sable Creek. I groaned, shoved the sandwich into the passenger seat, and headed out.

The boy’s name was Cody Mercer. His father, Charlie, met me in the front yard with shaking hands and wild eyes. “He was just playing with the dog,” Charlie said. “Chased him around the back. Then he was just… gone.”

I walked the property, checked the shed, the garage, the edge of the woods. It wasn’t until I stepped into the old barn that something felt off. The air was still and close. Dust floated like mist through shafts of sunlight. Then I heard it—thumping. Faint but steady, like someone knocking from underground.

There was a hatch near the far wall, half-covered by hay bales. I opened it and the smell hit me—damp, old dirt, like something buried long ago and forgotten. I shined my light down.

The boy was sitting in the crawlspace. Smiling.

No fear. No tears. Just that blank, wide-eyed grin. When I pulled him out, he didn’t ask for his dad. Didn’t say a word. He just started humming. Some slow, tuneless melody, like he’d been doing it for hours.

I brought him back to Charlie, who burst into tears and wrapped him up in a hug. I asked Cody where he’d gone. He looked at me and said, “Down.” That’s it. Down.

I didn’t mention the dirt under the hatch was smooth and untouched. No way a six-year-old dug into it. No signs of anyone crawling in or out.

That night, I sat up late in bed, staring at the ceiling. I kept hearing that humming in my head. It didn’t sound like a kid’s song. It sounded older.

Two nights later, I was patrolling Route 12 near what locals call Deadman’s Curve. We’ve had more fatalities on that bend than anywhere else in the county. Something about the grade and the slope of the trees makes it hard to see what’s coming.

At around 11:40, dispatch got a call from a trucker who’d nearly hit someone standing in the middle of the road. “Woman in a white dress,” he said. “Just standing there barefoot, staring at me. I swerved and almost went into the ditch.”

I pulled up ten minutes later. Found the skid marks he mentioned, clear as day. No sign of a woman. But there was fog creeping in from the woods, thick and low, like dry ice at a concert. It hadn’t rained in over a week.

I got out of the cruiser and walked toward the trees. My flashlight barely cut through the mist. And then I saw her.

She was standing just past the ditch, still as stone. Long dress, hair hanging wet down her back, arms limp. No shoes. No movement. Just staring at me like I’d interrupted something.

I called out. She didn’t flinch.

My radio crackled suddenly with a burst of static so loud I winced. I turned away for half a second—just long enough to adjust the volume. When I looked back, she was gone.

I swept the woods for over an hour. Nothing. When I checked my dash cam later, there was no trace of her. Just me walking into the fog, talking to no one.

I didn’t report it. Figured no one would believe me. Hell, I barely believed it myself.

The weirdest call so far came from Ray Boone. He’s a drunk, lives alone in a trailer just outside Nolan’s Creek. He called 911 just after 2 a.m. Said someone was trying to break in. Claimed it was his ex-wife. Thing is, she died in a car accident in 2016.

When I arrived, he met me outside in his boxers and boots, clutching a baseball bat. “It’s her,” he kept saying. “She came back. She knocked on the windows, Clay. With her head. I heard the bone.”

I didn’t ask how he knew that. I just told him to stay inside while I checked around.

There were dents in the aluminum by the kitchen window. About head height. Three of them. Spaced out evenly, like someone had leaned forward and hit the metal repeatedly. There was something dark smeared between the dents—looked like oil at first, but when I touched it, it flaked off like dried blood.

I walked the perimeter. Found nothing. No tracks. No signs of entry. I was about to get back in my cruiser when I heard it—three soft knocks on the rear window.

I turned fast. No one there.

Then it came again, from the passenger side. I shined my light. Movement in the trees, fast and low to the ground, like someone crawling. Whatever it was, it was gone before I could blink.

Ray got arrested for threatening me when I returned inside. Said I “brought her with me.” He was shaking, teeth chattering, eyes unfocused. I had to drag him to the cruiser.

I’d normally write him off as a drunk lunatic. But that knocking? It followed me all the way back to the station. Three soft knocks. Just behind me. Always just out of sight.

⸻

The station’s been quiet lately. Too quiet. Sheriff Duval mostly keeps to his office now. Doesn’t talk much since the stroke. There’s only four of us rotating shifts, so the bullpen’s rarely full.

I was going through paperwork on Monroe’s old desk when I saw him walk past the window. Monroe. He died last year in a rollover out near Ellison Bridge. But there he was—same uniform, same boots, same frayed patch on the shoulder he always said he’d fix.

I stood up. “Monroe?” I stepped into the hallway.

He turned to look at me.

His face was calm, expressionless. But his eyes didn’t move. They were locked on me, but not really looking. Like someone wearing his skin, playing dress-up, imitating how he used to stand.

He smiled. Then turned and walked into the evidence room.

I followed him in.

The room was empty. Cold. The chain on locker #6—the one holding Monroe’s badge and personal effects—was swinging back and forth like someone had just brushed it.

Duval found me standing there five minutes later, staring at nothing.

I never told anyone what I saw. But I left my phone recording on my desk while I went after him. When I checked the audio later, there was about thirty seconds of static—deep, wet, sucking static—and then something that sounded like my name being said through gritted teeth.

⸻

I got hurt the last time. Real, physical pain. No imagining it this time.

Someone called about an abandoned truck near Miller’s Orchard. It was parked in the middle of a pasture, door hanging open. No driver in sight. Inside, the keys were still in the ignition. Wallet and phone on the seat. Belonged to a man named Hector Alvarez.

I started walking the field, calling out. The grass was waist-high, the sun low. About fifty yards out, everything went quiet. No birds. No wind. Just stillness.

Then I saw the footprints. Small. Bare. They looked like a child’s. Too small to be Hector’s. They led toward the treeline and stopped dead in the middle of the field.

I took a step closer and something grabbed my ankle.

Not brushed. Not snagged. *Grabbed*. Tight. Cold fingers, wrapping around my boot like a vice.

I shouted and fell back, firing my weapon without thinking. Twice. The grip loosened and I scrambled away, heart jackhammering in my chest. There was nothing there when I looked. But my boot had a handprint on it. Dirt-smeared. Child-sized. Thumb too long.

I filed a report. Left out most of the details. Said I thought I’d startled a coyote. Hector’s still missing. So is the truck.

⸻

I don’t know what’s happening in this county, but I know it’s getting worse. I feel it every time I pull out of the station. Every time the sun starts to go down.

Things are changing. Creeping out of the woods and the fields. Slipping through cracks in the walls of people’s homes. Showing up on cameras, then vanishing when you look again. And they’re not just showing themselves anymore.

They’re *touching us*.
