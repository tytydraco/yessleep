“That’s ridiculous. You mean to tell me that y’all have a legend here that there is a man who is at a urinal and kills anyone who comes next to him?”

My trainer took a swallow of his coffee. “Fine, can’t say I didn’t warn you though.” 

I’ve heard people talk about their scary legends, but nothing as ridiculous as what he told me.

“He is easy to spot. He wears a black three piece suit. Even our supervisors don’t dress that fancy. If you see him when you walk in, just go back out and you’ll be fine. Go to a different bathroom if you need to.” 

“Why wouldn’t management or human resources warn us about him?”

“Who would want to have a job here if they told everyone? We gotta make a living. Besides, not everyone believes it. I’ve seen him though. It’s also not like he comes in here daily. Sometimes there’s been years worth of gaps of people spotting him.” 

I get it, it’s October. Halloween pranks are funny and all that jazz. 

“Okay then.” 

My trainer seemed like a good guy. Perhaps he was a bit fuzzy in the head though. But this factory job was gonna help take care of my bills and help me get on a better path. 

I took another bite of my biscuit and took more notes on how to properly do the job. We were walking around the place as he gave me a brief tour when my morning coffee did what it does. I walked in the bathroom and only seen guys in their uniforms and favorite sport team hat. 

I go to my lunch break and tell my fiancé what bogus story I was told. She laughed and said “what about the shitting man?” I laughed ridiculously loud. 

After I was working in my area for a few hours, I told my trainer that I had to go slip by the bathroom. 

“Make sure to keep an eye out for the peeing man!” He was being ridiculous.

I walked into our locker room which has three stalls and two urinals. They are on the opposite side of the room from the door. I looked at up and seen someone in a three piece suit at the urinal. The air felt colder than it did prior. Something in me just told me to stay still. 

Another new employee came walking through a different door to go to the next urinal. I called out. 

“Hey!”

He turned back to me and gave me a strange look, “howdy.” 

He got to the urinal and unzipped himself. He turned to the man in the suit. “Nice suit. Are you with corporate?”

The man turned his head to look at him and his skin was slightly blue. He reached up with his hand and shoved the employees head into the wall. He dropped down and his head was being beat into the urinal. He started choking him. I don’t see how this is possible, but he shoved him into the urinal hole. The man was wheezing for air. Blood and parts of the man’s insides were mushing out. He flushed but not everything went down 

The peeing man walked over to a stall and stepped in. He looked up at me with a smile that was from ear to ear. He waved his bony fingers at me before flushing and going down the drain. 

I sprinted out and told my trainer what happened, I was hyperventilating. He took me by the arm and walked me over to Human Resources where I shared my side of the story. 

The balding man smiled and told me that me and my trainer were getting a month paid off work. “We appreciate if the public didn’t know about this. We’ll also set you up with one of our counselors if you’d like.”

I’ve been too shocked to tell my fiancé what happened so far. I told her that the company laid off so many employees for the month. My trainer sent me a text that concerned me.

“Don’t go see that counselor, tell them you’re perfectly fine. That counselor is really a hypnotist. They chalked it up that the employee left early and they haven’t heard from him since. They fudged the time and his truck is gone. They closed down the bathroom, claiming it to be renovations. They are bringing in a priest disguised as a plumber to do a cleansing. I’ve seen this all before. “
