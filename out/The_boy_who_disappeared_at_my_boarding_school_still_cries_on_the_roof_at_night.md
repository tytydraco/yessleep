The St. Michael Boys' School stood like a brooding titan at the edge of Kasang, its Victorian spires piercing the low-hanging fog that shrouded the hill. Every morning, the mist would roll in, thick and suffocating, swallowing the ancient building whole, only for it to emerge, ever more sinister, from the gloom. The air here was heavy with whispers, the kind that sent shivers down your spine and made you glance over your shoulder, certain that someone—or something—was watching.

I was sent here by my parents, who thought this place would be my salvation. One of the best schools in the country, they had said. A chance to prove myself, to live up to the expectations that had been heaped upon me since I could remember. From our home in Delhi, they had shipped me off to this remote hill station, hoping the isolation and discipline would mold me into the son they had always wanted. But from the moment I arrived, I knew something was terribly wrong with this place.

My first night at St. Michael Boys' School was restless. The dormitory was an old, creaky structure, the wooden floors groaning under the weight of history and secrets. I lay in bed, staring at the shadows that danced on the ceiling, cast by the flickering candlelight. The wind outside howled through the trees, sounding almost like the mournful wails of lost souls. Sleep eluded me, and I found myself drawn to the terrace, seeking solace under the cold, clear sky.

The terrace was my refuge. After everyone else had gone to sleep, I would sneak up there, wrapping myself in my thick, woolen shawl to fend off the biting cold. It was on one such night, a week into my stay, that I met Amir. He was a senior, a tall, lanky boy with a mop of unruly hair and a perpetually bored expression. I found him leaning against the parapet, casually smoking a cigarette, the red ember glowing like a solitary firefly in the darkness.

“Can't sleep either, huh?” he said, not looking at me as I approached.

I shrugged, feeling awkward. “Yeah. This place... it’s hard to get used to.”

He chuckled, a low, almost sinister sound. “You'll get used to it, or it'll drive you mad. One or the other.”

We stood in silence for a while, listening to the wind. Finally, Amir spoke again. “I'm Amir, by the way. Twelfth standard.”

“Arjun. Eleventh,” I replied, feeling a bit more at ease. “Why did you come up here?”

He took a long drag from his cigarette and exhaled slowly. “Sometimes I just need to get away from it all. This place can get to you, you know? Especially at night.”

I nodded, understanding the sentiment all too well. “Yeah, it's definitely different from what I'm used to.”

Amir looked at me, his eyes glinting in the moonlight. “You'll find it's more than just different. There's something... off about this place.”

I felt a shiver run down my spine. “What do you mean?”

He laughed, a hollow, humorless sound. “It might be too much for your first night. Let’s just say you’ll know the stories about St. Michael soon enough.”

His words hung in the air, heavy and foreboding. I wanted to press him, to ask what he meant, but something in his tone stopped me. Instead, I nodded and turned to look out over the fog-covered grounds.

As we stood there, the wind howling through the trees, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching us from the shadows. The terrace, once my refuge, now felt like a place of dread. And as I looked out into the darkness, I couldn't help but wonder what secrets St. Michael Boys' School was hiding, and how long it would be before those secrets came to find me.

The days passed slowly, each one a repetition of the last. Classes were rigorous, designed to push us to our limits, but my mind was never fully present. Instead, I found myself drawn to the mysteries of the school, the whispers that seemed to linger in the air long after the bell had rung.

Every evening, I would head to the terrace, hoping for another encounter with Amir. There was something about him that both unsettled and intrigued me, a sense that he knew more about the school’s secrets than he let on. Sure enough, a few nights later, I found him there again, the faint glow of his cigarette the only light in the thick darkness.

“Back again?” he asked, without turning around.

I nodded, moving to stand beside him. “Couldn't stay away.”

Amir smirked. “This place does that to you.”

We stood in silence for a while, the only sound the distant hoot of an owl and the rustling of leaves in the wind. Eventually, I gathered the courage to ask what had been on my mind since our last conversation.

“You mentioned something being off about this place," I began, choosing my words carefully. “What did you mean?”

He glanced at me, his expression unreadable. “You're persistent, I'll give you that.”

“I just want to understand,” I said, the truth of my words surprising even me. “I need to know what I'm dealing with.”

Amir sighed, flicking his cigarette into the darkness. “Alright, but remember, you asked for it.”

He leaned against the parapet, his gaze distant. “This school has a history, Arjun. A dark one. You see, a long time ago, something terrible happened here. There's a reason why it feels like the walls themselves are whispering secrets.”

My curiosity was piqued, and I leaned in closer. “What happened?”

“There was an incident,” he said slowly, as if weighing each word. “A student disappeared. His name was Raj. One day he was here, and the next, he was gone. No one knows what happened to him – well there are theories but no one really knows anything. But ever since then, strange things have been happening.”

I felt a chill run down my spine. “What kind of things?”

Amir's eyes met mine, and in them, I saw a flicker of fear. “People hear voices, see shadows that shouldn't be there. Sometimes, you can hear footsteps echoing in empty halls, or feel a cold breeze when there's no wind. It's as if the school is alive, haunted by the past.”

I swallowed hard, the weight of his words settling heavily in my chest. “Do you believe in ghosts?”

Amir's laugh was humorless. “I didn’t, until I came here. But this place...it changes you.”

I shivered, wrapping my shawl tighter around myself. “Why did you stay, then? If it's so terrible?”

He looked away, his face shadowed. “Some of us don't have a choice. And besides, there's a part of us that needs to know the truth, no matter how terrifying it is.”

His words resonated with me, and I realized that I felt the same way. There was a pull, an undeniable need to uncover the secrets of St. Michael Boys' School, even if it meant facing whatever haunted its halls.

As the night deepened, Amir turned to leave. “Get some rest, Arjun. You’ll need it. And remember, some things are better left undiscovered.”

I watched him disappear into the darkness, my mind a whirl of thoughts and fears. The terrace, once my sanctuary, now felt like a place of foreboding, a reminder of the unknown terrors lurking within the school's ancient walls.

I didn't sleep that night. Instead, I lay awake, listening to the creaks and groans of the old building, wondering what secrets it held and how long it would be before they revealed themselves to me. And as the first light of dawn began to creep through the windows, I made a silent promise to myself: I would uncover the truth of this school, no matter the cost.

While the days here blurred into a monotonous routine, but the nights...the nights were a different story. Each evening, I found myself drawn to the terrace, haunted by the mysteries that lurked in the shadows. Amir's warnings echoed in my mind, but curiosity outweighed fear, driving me to seek answers to the school's dark secrets.

One particularly cold night, as I made my way to the terrace, I found myself alone. The air was thick with fog, the chill seeping into my bones despite the warmth of my shawl. I glanced around nervously, half expecting Amir to materialize out of the darkness with his usual nonchalant demeanor.

“Amir, you here?” I called out, trying to keep my voice steady despite the rising unease in my chest.

There was no response, only the eerie silence of the night. I chuckled nervously, the sound ringing hollow in the dense fog. “Guess it's just me then.”

I turned to leave, the hair on the back of my neck prickling with a sense of foreboding. But before I could take a single step, I heard it—the soft, muffled sound of footsteps approaching from behind. My heart leaped into my throat, and I turned back, expecting to see Amir's familiar silhouette emerging from the mist.

“Hey, Amir, are you trying to scare me?” I called out, hoping for a laugh to break the tension.

But there was no laughter, no response at all. Instead, the fog swirled and shifted, obscuring my vision and sending tendrils of fear creeping up my spine. I took a hesitant step back, my pulse pounding in my ears, when suddenly, I heard it—a sound that froze the blood in my veins and turned my bones to ice.

Sobs. Soft, heart-wrenching sobs, coming from the corner of the roof. I strained to see through the fog, my heart hammering in my chest as I moved closer, against every instinct screaming at me to run.

“Hello?” I called out, my voice trembling with fear. “Is someone there? Are you okay?”

No response, only the sound of choking sobs growing louder with each step I took. I rounded the corner, my breath catching in my throat as I beheld a sight that would haunt me for the rest of my days.

There, huddled in the corner, was a figure of a boy. He wore the familiar maroon blazer of St. Michael Boys' School, his shoulders shaking with silent sobs. I hesitated, unsure of what to do, my mind racing with a thousand questions.

“Are you alright?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. “Can I help you?”

The boy didn't respond, didn't even acknowledge my presence. Slowly, cautiously, I moved closer, my heart pounding in my chest. I reached out a trembling hand, intending to comfort him, when suddenly, he looked up.

His eyes were white, devoid of color or humanity. His face twisted in a grotesque mask of pain and fear, his tears replaced by thick, red blood that streamed down his cheeks like rivulets of crimson.

I stumbled back, a scream rising in my throat as terror consumed me. This was no ordinary boy, no lost soul seeking solace in the darkness. This was something else, something otherworldly.

With a primal instinct for survival, I turned and ran, my feet pounding against the cold stone of the terrace as I fled from the horror that lurked in the shadows. I didn't stop until I reached the safety of my dormitory, the echoes of the boy's cries still ringing in my ears.

Breathless and trembling, I burst into Amir's dormitory, my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. Amir stirred from his slumber, blinking sleepily in the dim light, but I could see the momentary flicker of concern in his eyes as he registered my panicked state.

“Arjun, what's wrong?” he asked, his voice thick with sleep.

I didn't waste a moment. “Amir, you have to wake up! Something-something terrible happened on the terrace!”

Amir rubbed his eyes, still groggy from sleep, but the urgency in my voice seemed to jolt him awake. “What are you talking about? What did you see?”

I glanced around, realizing for the first time that we weren't alone. Jatin, Amir's roommate, lay in his bed, his expression a mixture of irritation and confusion.

Jatin grumbled, rubbing his eyes and sitting up. “What's going on? It's the middle of the night, Arjun!”

But I didn't have time for pleasantries. “I saw something on the terrace, something...unnatural. You have to believe me!”

Both Amir and Jatin exchanged skeptical glances, but there was a spark of curiosity in their eyes that I couldn't ignore.

“People have only heard things up until now,” Jatin said, his voice tinged with doubt. “No one has ever seen anything before.”

“That's what I thought too,” I replied, my voice barely above a whisper. “But I swear, I saw someone. It was...horrifying.”

Amir sat up, his expression serious. “Alright, Arjun. Show us.”

I recoiled, my heart leaping into my throat. “No, I can't go back there! Not after what I saw!”

But Amir was already reaching for his pack of cigarettes, his determination unwavering. “We have to see for ourselves. We have to know the truth.”

Jatin sighed, resigned. “Fine, let's go. But if this is some kind of prank, Arjun, you're going to regret waking me up in the middle of the night.”

Reluctantly, I led them back to the terrace, my every step heavy with dread. The fog had thickened, swirling around us like a living entity as we ascended the stairs, the air heavy with the weight of the unknown.

As we reached the top, I felt a chill run down my spine, the memories of what I had seen flooding back with crushing force. But I pushed the fear aside, steeling myself for whatever horrors awaited us in the darkness.

The terrace was empty, the only sound the distant hoot of an owl and the rustling of leaves in the wind. I scanned the shadows nervously, half expecting the ghostly figure to materialize before us once more.

But there was nothing, only the oppressive silence of the night. I turned to face Amir and Jatin, my heart sinking with a mixture of relief and disappointment.

“I swear, he was here,” I said, my voice, trembling with fear. “I saw him, I swear.”

Amir reached out a comforting hand, his expression sympathetic. “I believe you, Arjun. Maybe-maybe it was just a trick of the light, or your imagination playing tricks on you.”

I shook my head, the memory still fresh in my mind. “No, it was real. I know it was.”

Jatin scoffed, his skepticism unwavering. “Well, there's nothing here now. Let's go back to bed before we get in trouble.”

But it was too late and we heard someone coming towards us.

“Who’s there?” The night guard yelled. “Which one of you scoundrels is it tonight?”

As the echo of the voice pierced the silence of the night, our hearts leaped into our throats, fear coursing through our veins like icy tendrils. Amir and Jatin exchanged panicked glances, their eyes wide with terror as the realization dawned upon us - the night guard was patrolling, and we were about to be caught trespassing.

Without hesitation, Amir grabbed my arm, his grip firm as he propelled me forward, his urgency matching the pounding of our hearts. “We have to go,” he hissed, his voice laced with terror. “Now!”

Jatin nodded in agreement, his eyes darting nervously as he scanned the darkened corridors for any sign of movement. “Quick, follow me,” he whispered, his voice strained with desperation. “I know where we can hide.”

With adrenaline-fueled determination, we dashed through the west wing of the hostel, the shadows swallowing us whole as we moved deeper into the darkness. The air grew colder with each step, the oppressive weight of the night pressing down upon us like a suffocating blanket.

The dim moonlight filtered through the windows, casting eerie shadows that danced along the walls, their twisted forms resembling grotesque specters lurking in the gloom. Every creak of the floorboards, every rustle of the curtains sent shivers racing down our spines, our senses heightened to the point of hysteria.

Jatin led the way, his footsteps echoing hollowly in the empty corridors, his breaths ragged and uneven as he navigated the labyrinthine passages with the skill of a seasoned navigator. But even he couldn't hide the tremor of fear in his voice as he urged us onward, his eyes darting nervously at every shadowy alcove and hidden nook.

The darkness seemed to close in around us, suffocating and oppressive, as if the very walls of the hostel were alive with malevolent intent. I could feel the weight of unseen eyes upon us, watching, waiting, their presence a palpable threat that sent my heart racing with terror.

But still, we pressed on, driven by the primal instinct for survival, our every step a desperate bid to escape the clutches of the night. And as we moved deeper into the west wing, the sense of foreboding only grew, the air thick with the whispers of the past and the shadows of the unknown.

I wanted to scream, to cry out for help, but the words caught in my throat, choked off by the suffocating grip of fear. All I could do was cling to Amir and Jatin, my grip white-knuckled and desperate, as we ventured further into the heart of darkness, each moment fraught with the promise of terror and the threat of the unknown.

And as we disappeared into the depths of the west wing, the night swallowed us whole, our fate uncertain and our souls haunted by the echoes of the past. For in the darkness of St. Michael Boys' School, no secret remained buried, and no sin went unpunished.

“No one stays here anymore,” Jatin murmured, his voice barely above a whisper. “Not since Raj's disappearance.”

I swallowed hard, the name sending a shiver down my spine. “Raj?”

Jatin nodded solemnly. “Yes, Raj. He used to live here, in this very wing, around fifty years ago.”

Amir chimed in, his voice tinged with sadness. “Students say he was in love with a girl from the neighboring village. They believed...they believed the villagers caught them together and...killed them.”

The weight of Amir's words settled heavily in my chest, a profound sadness washing over me like a tidal wave. The thought of two young lovers meeting such a tragic end filled me with a deep sense of sorrow, the darkness of the night seeming to mirror the anguish of their untimely demise.

We lingered in the west wing for a while longer, the oppressive atmosphere weighing heavily upon us. But eventually, we made the unanimous decision to leave, to retreat to the safety of our own wing of the hostel and bury the events of the night deep within the recesses of our minds.

As we made our way back through the corridors, the silence hung heavy around us, broken only by the soft echo of our footsteps on the cold, hard floor. Each step felt like a journey into the unknown, the darkness pressing in around us like a living entity.

And then, just as we reached the threshold of the west wing, I heard it—a soft whisper, barely audible above the sound of our own breathing.

“Arjun..please don’t leave me alone here.”

I froze, my heart pounding in my chest as I turned back, searching desperately for the source of the voice. But there was no one there, only the empty expanse of the west wing, shrouded in darkness and silence.

For a moment, I considered telling Amir and Jatin, sharing the chilling encounter that had sent a shiver down my spine. But then, a sense of unease washed over me, a primal instinct urging me to keep the truth buried deep within the recesses of my mind.

With a heavy heart, I turned away, following in the footsteps of my companions as we made our way back to the safety of our own wing of the hostel. And as we slipped beneath the covers of our beds, I vowed never to speak of that night again, to bury the memories deep within the shadows where they belonged.

As the months passed and the memory of that fateful night in the west wing faded into the recesses of my mind, a nagging curiosity gnawed at me, an insatiable desire to uncover the truth of Raj's disappearance. I found myself drawn back to the empty corridors of the west wing, night after night, my footsteps echoing hollowly in the silence as I wandered through the darkness with nothing but a lamp or a flashlight to guide me.

At first, fear gripped me like a vice, every shadow and creak of the floorboards sending shivers racing down my spine. But as time went on, I grew bolder, my determination to unravel the mystery outweighing the creeping sense of dread that threatened to consume me.

I would sit alone in the darkness, my thoughts consumed by the tragic tale of Raj and the girl he loved, weaving stories in my mind of clandestine meetings and forbidden romance. Perhaps, I thought, Raj had snuck out of the school to meet his beloved, their love doomed from the start by the cruel hand of fate.

And so, on the last day of the term, before I left for Delhi to spend the month-long break with my family, I found myself drawn back to the west wing one final time. As I sat alone in the darkness, reading a comic that I had borrowed from Amir, I heard footsteps echoing in the distance, drawing closer with each passing moment.

At first, fear gripped me, uncertainty clouding my mind as I strained to see through the darkness. But then, a figure emerged from the shadows, a boy around my age, his features familiar yet foreign. He wore the school uniform, his maroon blazer tarnished and worn, a ghostly echo of the students who had come before.

“Hello,” he said, his voice soft and gentle. “Mind if I join you?”

I hesitated, uncertainty gnawing at the edges of my mind as I studied him. There was something off about him, something that didn't quite sit right. His school uniform was dirty, his maroon blazer stained with what looked like dried blood.

And then, as he drew closer, I saw it—the chilling realization that sent a shiver racing down my spine. His eyes were white, devoid of color or humanity, his gaze fixed on me with an intensity that made my blood run cold.

The boy I had heard crying on the terrace, the specter that haunted the west wing, he was standing before me now, his presence a stark reminder of the darkness that lurked within these walls.

I wanted to scream, to run, to escape the clutches of the nightmare that had become my reality. But as I looked into Raj's eyes, I saw something there—something human, something vulnerable.

He didn't want to hurt me. He just wanted company, someone to share in the loneliness that had consumed him for so long.

Raj's smile softened, a flicker of gratitude shining in his haunted eyes as he listened to my words. “You're not scared of me,” he mused, his voice tinged with a hint of wonder.

I shook my head, meeting his gaze with unwavering determination. “No, I'm not scared of you,” I replied, my voice steady despite the lingering fear that gnawed at the edges of my consciousness.

Raj nodded, a solemn expression crossing his features. “You had the entire year to be scared of me, to fear what I might do,” he said quietly. “But you didn't. You stayed by my side, a silent companion in the darkness.”

I felt a lump form in my throat at his words, a surge of emotion swelling within me. “You were lonely,” I said softly, the weight of his loneliness pressing down upon me like a heavy burden. “I could see it in your eyes, feel it in the echoes of your cries.”

Raj nodded, a sad smile playing at the corners of his lips. “Walking these corridors alone...it's more cruel than anyone can imagine,” he admitted, his voice tinged with sorrow. “That's why all of you students hear me cry out in the darkness, a silent plea for companionship in the endless night.”

Before I could respond, Raj's apparition flickered, his form wavering like a candle flame in the wind. I reached out instinctively, my fingers brushing against the empty air as he spoke, his voice fading into the shadows.

“But it's not safe for you here anymore,” he said, his words a chilling reminder of the dangers that lurked in the darkness. “You should leave.”

Confusion clouded my thoughts as I struggled to comprehend his warning. “Why?” I asked, my voice trembling with uncertainty.

As Raj's words washed over me, a sense of horror and disbelief settled like a heavy weight upon my chest. The truth he revealed was more chilling than any ghost story whispered in the dead of night.

“No one knows what really happened to me,” Raj confessed, his voice hollow with despair. “The story of me being killed by the villagers...it was all a lie concocted by the school administration to bury the truth.”

I listened in stunned silence as Raj recounted his harrowing tale, the reality of his suffering more agonizing than I could have ever imagined. He spoke of the relentless torment he endured at the hands of his classmates, the constant abuse and humiliation that had become his daily reality.

“All I ever wanted was to be friends with them,” Raj admitted, his voice tinged with bitterness. “But they cast me out, beat me, bullied me at every turn. I tried to run away, to escape this prison, but my family always sent me back.”

Tears welled in my eyes as I listened to Raj's heartbreaking story, the injustice of his plight a cruel reminder of the darkness that lurked within the human heart. He spoke of the fateful night when the bullying went too far, when his tormentors took him to the roof of the hostel and subjected him to one final act of cruelty.

“They took turns hitting me,” Raj whispered, his voice choking with emotion. “And then one push was too strong. I fell.”

The horror of Raj's words echoed in the silence that followed, the weight of his suffering pressing down upon us like a suffocating blanket. I struggled to comprehend the depths of his pain, the cruelty of those who had driven him to his untimely demise.

And yet, even in death, Raj's soul remained trapped within these walls, his tormentors shielded by their wealth and privilege while he languished in the shadows, a forgotten victim of their cruelty.

As Raj's words sunk in, a chill ran down my spine, the full weight of his revelation settling like a heavy stone in the pit of my stomach. The horror of what he had endured, the injustice of his fate, it was all too much to bear.

“Can you escape this school?” I asked, my voice trembling with a mixture of fear and desperation.

Raj smiled sadly, his eyes reflecting the pain of a thousand lifetimes. “Maybe,” he replied softly. “But I choose to stay.”

Confusion clouded my thoughts as I struggled to comprehend his words. "Why?" I asked, my heart pounding in my chest.

Raj's smile widened, a flicker of mischief dancing in his haunted eyes. “It's not safe for you here anymore,” he explained cryptically.

I furrowed my brow in confusion. “Why?” I pressed, my voice tinged with urgency.

“Because I can't keep holding them back,” Raj replied, his voice filled with resignation. “I stay here because it's the only way I can torment those who tormented me—for eternity.”

The realization hit me like a bolt of lightning, the horror of Raj's words sinking in with sickening clarity. “You mean...?”

Raj nodded solemnly. “When I found myself trapped in this realm, I sought out every one of my classmates, here in the west wing,” he confessed. “I whispered in their ears, drove them to madness, led them to their deaths—all from the same terrace where they pushed me.”

The terror of Raj's revelation washed over me like a tidal wave, the horror of his vengeance casting a shadow over my thoughts. I looked into his eyes, searching for some sign of remorse, but all I saw was a cold, unyielding resolve.

“You were a great friend to me this past year,” Raj said softly, his voice tinged with sadness. “But you must never come back to the west wing again. If you do...I cannot guarantee your safety – from them.”

With a heavy heart, I nodded, the weight of his words settling upon me like a shroud. I understood now the true nature of the darkness that lurked within the walls of St. Michael Boys' School, and I knew that I could never escape its grasp.

In the days that followed my encounter with Raj, I made a solemn vow to leave that night behind me, to bury those memories within the recesses of my mind. I never spoke of Raj to anyone, not even to Amir or Jatin, who had left for college now, their absence a stark reminder of the passage of time.

As I returned for my final year at the school after a month-long hiatus, I resolved to put the events of that night behind me, to focus on my studies and leave the ghosts of the past where they belonged. But try as I might, I could never shake the feeling of unease that lingered in the air, the echoes of Raj's torment haunting me like a specter in the night.

Nights passed in restless slumber, the sound of sobs and cries echoing in the darkness, calling to me from the rooftop where Raj had once stood. But I knew in my heart that it was not him who cried out in the night.

And yet, the cries persisted, a constant reminder of the darkness that lurked within the walls of St. Michael Boys' School, a darkness that refused to be silenced. And as I lay awake in the dead of night, listening to the mournful wails that echoed through the halls, I knew that some secrets were meant to remain buried, lest they consume us whole in their unrelenting grasp.
