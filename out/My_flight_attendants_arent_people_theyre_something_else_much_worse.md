I remember my first transatlantic flight to America quite well. A little too well. I remember being so shaken with excitement to board an A380. My dad and I even got to the airport early just so I could see it pull up to the gangway in all its glory. Two stories with enough space to fit about 850 passengers. Truly a modern marvel. My dad sat in the waiting area while I was busy taking pictures. It was going to be my first time in the US. We had gotten a cheap connection to take us to NYC, the city of dreams, at least that’s what you see in the movies. Boarding went smoothly, and the people at the gate were all smiles. I remember being pretty upset when we got to our seats that they put us right next to the toilets, but at least I had a window seat. We stuffed our luggage in the overhead bin and tried to get as comfortable as possible with the little legroom we got.



The boarding process was soon completed, and we watched the flight attendants give us the safety instructions. I hadn’t noticed them since there were so many people moving about, but now I had a clear look at their faces. I peeked over the seats in front of me. A young blonde woman (typical Munich girl) was opening and closing the seatbelts, demonstrating how to use them. She wore bright red lipstick and was smiling left and right. I remember looking at her and feeling that something, I didn’t know what exactly, wasn’t right about this. Her movements seemed jagged, almost forced and more artificial than real.



I couldn't quite shake off that odd feeling as the plane taxied down the runway and finally took off into the night sky. I gripped the sides of my seat as the engines jumped into action. Not long after, it was a smooth ride again. My dad settled in with a book, but I was too excited to sleep. I watched the lights of Munich fade into the distance and then turned my attention to the in-flight entertainment system.



Hours passed. I watched some dumb revenge action movie, and the hum of the engines became a soothing background noise. Dinner was served, and the attendants slowly moved down the aisle with their carts. As the young, blonde flight attendant approached our row, I again couldn't help but feel that her smile was too wide, too fixed. Her eyes, though, were the most unsettling. They were a bright, icy blue, with no warmth in them, almost as if they were devoid of any humanity.



"Dinner, sir?" she asked my father, her voice sweet like honey. We had the choice between a chicken pasta and a pesto pasta. So much for diversity.



My dad took his tray and thanked her. When she turned to me, her eyes locked onto mine for just a fraction of a second longer than was comfortable. Even though I’m German and eye contact is like our whole thing, my stomach sank a bit. I muttered a thanks and took my tray of pesto pasta, trying not to shiver.



After dinner, the cabin lights dimmed, signaling that it was time for the passengers to get some rest. The attendants walked up and down the aisles, checking seatbelts and gently urging people to recline their seats and sleep. I wasn't tired, though. I decided to watch another movie, and halfway through, I felt my eyes beginning to droop. A little dazed, I glanced around and noticed something. Almost every passenger in the rows around me had fallen asleep at the same time, including my dad. Though that’s kind of expected, still it was eerie, like they were all puppets whose strings had been cut. Slumped over in their chairs, some had their mouths wide open; others were cuddled deep into their Lufthansa pillows.



I felt a sudden pressure in my bladder and decided to take a trip to the bathroom. If I was going to go to sleep, it was best to take care of that first no matter how tired I was. I carefully stepped over my dad's legs, climbed over the guy next to him, and made my way around the corner where the toilets were. The room was small and cramped, but I was grateful for the privacy at least. After I finished, I splashed some water on my face, trying to shake off the creeping feeling of unease. It was like I had taken a sleeping pill; my mind was wide awake but my body wasn’t. Two fronts fighting inside me. I washed my hands and put my hand on the door handle. That’s when I heard a strange clicking sound and something else, really quiet.



As I opened the bathroom door a crack, I could hear hushed whispers and saw movement in the aisle. Peeking out, I saw the flight attendants behaving in a way that made my blood run cold. They were not tending to the passengers or resting. Instead, they were hovering over the sleeping travelers, doing something I couldn't quite make out. Their shadowy figures scurried down the aisles, moving quickly from seat to seat.



The blonde attendant was closest to me. I could make out the faint glow of her lipstick in the dimmed lights. She was just a couple of rows down from ours. Just as I tried to take a closer look at what she was doing, her head jolted around towards the bathrooms. Quickly I retracted my head back into the room. I didn’t feel safe at all. That creepy feeling I had from the start flooded my body. Inside me was a scared animal, kicking and hissing to not go outside under ANY circumstances. I hit the light switch to turn it off. If I was going to see what was going on, what THEY were doing to everyone and what they were going to do to my dad, I had to be careful. I stuck my head back out more carefully this time. There she was again; she had cleared a row and was now closer to me. I squinted my eyes.



She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, metallic device that looked like a standard pen. She placed it against the temple of a sleeping man and pressed a button on the back of it. A faint glow emitted from the device, and the man twitched slightly but didn't wake up. A strange silver glow flowed from the man’s head straight into the pen. The attendant's smile grew wider, more grotesque, as she lifted the pen up to her mouth, pressing the button again. The device released what it had captured moments ago into the flight attendant’s mouth as she visibly contorted with joy. Then she snapped back and quickly moved on to the next passenger, repeating the process.



I ducked back into the bathroom, my heart pounding in my chest. What the fuck were they doing? Harvesting something? It didn't make sense, but these attendants were extracting something from the passengers, I was sure of it.



Summoning all my courage and holding my breath, I peeked out again, hoping to get a clearer view of anything. Maybe I was hallucinating what I had seen. At least that’s what I hoped. What I saw next made me gasp, and I nearly lost my balance. The attendants' appearances were changing as they got closer to the back of the plane. Their skin began to ripple and shift, revealing an almost translucent texture beneath that was slightly glowing in the dim lights. They transformed right in front of me. I could see it happening to the blonde flight attendant and the other shadowy ones further back. Their features elongated and distorted, eyes growing larger and more luminescent. Their hands sprouted additional fingers, long and thin, with sharp, claw-like nails.



The transformation was horrifying. They no longer looked remotely human. These creatures, these things, were harvesting something from the passengers, something vital to them.



I pulled back into the bathroom, trying to steady my breathing. I had to do something, maybe warn someone. But who would believe me? Everyone was sound asleep. And what could I or they possibly do against these monsters? My mind raced as I tried to come up with a plan. I was sweating profusely.



Suddenly, there was a soft knock on the bathroom door. "Is everything alright in there?" It was the blonde attendant's voice, but now it didn’t sound sweet anymore; it was distorted, almost like two voices speaking in unison. My blood turned to ice as I realized they knew I was awake.



"I-I'm fine," I stammered, trying to keep my voice steady. "Just needed a moment."



"Alright," she replied, her voice dripping with false sweetness like a honey trap. "If you need anything, just let us know."



I heard her footsteps retreating and knew I didn't have much time. I had to get back to my seat and somehow wake my dad. In the time I had contemplated what to do, they must have already extracted whatever they needed from everyone, including my dad. Still, I thought that maybe together we could figure out what was happening. It was my only hope.



Taking a deep breath, I slowly opened the bathroom door to an empty aisle. The things, those beings, were gone. I crept back to my seat, praying that the creatures wouldn't come back. As I slid into my seat, I gently shook my dad's shoulder. "Dad," I whispered. "Wake up."



But he didn't stir. He was still fast asleep. There was a faint residue of the extracted glowing liquid on his temple. Panic surged through me. What were they doing to him? To all of us?



I glanced around, my heart beating so hard that it made me want to vomit, and saw the attendants at the front of the plane, moving down the aisle again. I had to act quickly. Summoning every ounce of courage, I reached for the call button. If I could create a distraction, maybe I could wake up some of the other passengers and alert them to what was happening.



Scared shitless, I waited for someone to notice the light above my row. Heavy steps moved towards me until they stopped right where we sat. I looked up in terror to see the blonde attendant standing over me, seemingly returned to normal.



"Are you OK, sir?" she asked, a kind and caring smile on her face.



My mind raced; what the fuck was I going to say? Calculating the outcomes of this conversation, I instinctively settled on the best for all of us.



"I’m fine; I just wanted to see if you had any water for me. My throat is really dry."



"Of course, sir, I will be right back."



We soon landed in Boston. For the rest of the flight, I just sat there staring into the black mirror of the screen in front of me. I  didn’t understand what I witnessed, and I still don’t to this day. My dad woke up just as we landed, and he seemed well-rested. When we left the plane, the lead flight attendant smiled wide and wished us a good time in America. I could have sworn there was a faint silvery glow in her eyes.



As for our time in New York, it was incredible. My dad was severely jetlagged, but I was just fine, so I went out early to walk around Central Park and have breakfast sandwiches at a deli around the corner almost every day.



The flight back and all flights I’ve taken after that were fine. Nothing strange ever happened, although I didn’t sleep for a second on any of them. I still can’t wrap my head around it. Has anyone ever noticed anything like that on their transatlantic flights?
