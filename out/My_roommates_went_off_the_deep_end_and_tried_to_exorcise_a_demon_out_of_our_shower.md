I live with two roommates, one I met in high school (we'll call him Chris) and the other someone he met from church (who I'll call Isaac). Rent is a bitch so shortly Chris and I moved in together, we agreed to bring in Isaac because he was moving out. 

Some context, I live in Alberta, basically imagine Texas but Canadian. A product of that is we have a lot of religion in our town. Chris was basically "THE Christian" of the group, we had multiple "Chris"s so we would differentiate them with their "defining character traits", there was Hair Chris who had long hair, Short Chris who was short, and Christian Chris who was working to become a pastor. 

He's chill about it, and he's chill about me being an LGBTQ atheist. He might be an uber Christian but he's not an asshole. Isaac, on the other hand...

Isaac is basically the opposite. He doesn't know much about theology but still makes it everyone's problem when it's mentioned in conversation. If I knew he was as homophobic as he is, i wouldn't have agreed to let him move in. But, he's Chris' friend, so I don't really mind so long as he doesn't bug me. 

Anyways, shortly before Isaac moved in, I was going to come out to Chris as trans. Before then I was just using "queer" as a catch all term to explain "idk what i am but I'm not a dude and I'm certainly not straight" without saying all that. But once Isaac moved in I changed my mind. If Isaac knew i was trans, I'd never hear the end of it. 

So, I stayed closeted. But I didn't let that stop me from doing some vocal therapy in the shower. Basically, transgender people undergo vocal therapy to change how they sound when they talk, most commonly it's trans women like me feminizing our voices. Going off the title, I'm sure you can see where this is going. 

Some people use singing exercises, some use mantras, the method is different for everyone, but I was far enough in my journey from "learning the girl voice as a joke" all I had to do was to get it consistent for long periods of time. So, I used poetry. I'm a huge horror fan, much to the chagrin of Chris and Isaac, but I chose to memorize some Edgar Allen Poe for practice anyways, not thinking it would have this huge of an effect. 

The walls are thin as fuck, so I ended up catching the attention of Chris first. He was confused by why he was hearing a girl's voice coming from the washroom when I was using it, and I explained that I was listening to a podcast where someone analyses poems, and they had a bunch of episodes covering Poe's works. He bought it and stopped asking thereon.

Then Isaac noticed. 

He asked me the same question Chris did, and I gave the same answer, until he decided to "test" something, as he put it. 

We have a bluetooth speaker in the washroom we use to listen to stuff while in the shower. We all share it, but I don't usually use it. The music makes it harder to get my resonance right. 

One day, this mother fucker took the speaker out of the washroom before I showered. I didn't notice, and he heard "the voice" again. 

He confronted me about it again and I called him out on being weird because I couldn't think of a cover story, and he backed off. 

Ever since then he's been acting REALLY suspicious around me. I caught him trying, and failing, to use my laptop because he doesn't know how linux works and couldn't rationalise my laptop not having chrome on it, he stole basically all of my sketch books and refused to give them back before he "gave them a good look with eyes that read the good book", he gives me obnoxious side eyes at every conceivable moment, overall he was being an asshole. 

I asked Chris to talk to him because he's his friend first and foremost, Isaac would never listen to me before and there's no way he'd listen to me now. 

Fast forward to the next night and now CHRIS IS ACTING WEIRD. This asshole got his hooks into Chris too.

Chris' weird behaviour isn't nearly as bad as Isaac, he just seems jumpy around me. Every time I talked with him after the discussion he had with Isaac he would look worried afterward.

Eventually I caught Isaac rummaging around in my dresser and the pot finally boiled over. A huge screaming match ensued in which both of them accused me of being a Baphomet worshipping satanist. Chris was hesitant to side with Isaac at first but his centrism gave way after a handful of "well he makes some good points" moments. 

In the heat of the moment, I said I was a satanist, i eat babies, i steal souls, i sacrifice goats, and I cursed our apartment. Basically everything I could say that would make Isaac physically recoil, I said. 

and then it started. 

The next morning I found a circle of salt around my bed. it took longer than I care to admit to vacuum it all up. He managed to get it all along the wall too somehow. To this day I have no idea how he did that while I was in bed. 

He basically stood in my room waiting for me to wake up so he could laugh at my face about having a "spiritual shield keeping you from leaving your bed". I pushed it out of the way and cleaned it to the best of my ability. He wasted perfectly good table salt for this shit. 

It ramped up in intensity over a few weeks. More salt barriers of varying types (he even bought and ground up a Himalayan salt rock lamp to see if that would work), talismans, bible verses, he hit me with a stick that was "blessed by a priest" once. He doused my bed in holy water, he bought a shower head that would purportedly "bless the shower water", it was getting out of hand. This whole time I keep voice training in the shower btw because I'm nothing if not a stubborn bitch. 

And finally, last week. Chris is too flighty to talk to me and doesn't want to be confrontational to his friend, and Isaac calls in a guy he found on the internet to perform a week long exorcism on our apartment. Coincidentally, the first day of this "exorcism" is the day I'm out visiting family. 

I come back to my apartment and the first thing I see is this guy who looks like if Guy Fieri turned his life around and became a catholic. The second thing I see is the fact that my room is boarded up. The third is a bag being pulled over my head. 

The next seven days felt like a fucking fever dream. I was tied to a chair in the shower, Christian Guy Fieri was constantly chanting every hour of the week, Isaac doused me with ice cold water every ~10 minutes, and Chris was nowhere to be seen. Knowing him he probably couldn't bear to watch this shit happen to someone, but couldn't find it in his heart to try and stop it. 

A few hours in they took the gag off and I tried to tell them this was complete insanity, obviously they didn't believe me, they just wanted to hear what my voice sounded like to tell if they "surfaced the demon yet". I told them Chris would know none of this is theologically accurate and they're probably doing more harm than good, but all I was met with was more chanting. So I said nothing. 

I want to say a day passed but I'm not entirely sure, either way I was getting exhausted. It was the last time I saw Chris, when he walked past the door Isaac and Fieri left open by accident. He said something but I couldn't hear over Fieri's chanting. All I knew was he looked worried. I think he pitied me. 

Eventually I had enough and was about to give them what they wanted, i was going to "let the demon talk to them" and basically act out getting "the demon" removed from my body, thanking them, and leaving, but I wasn't able to. 

Just as I was about to start the bit, the lights started flickering. They took it as them succeeding in the exorcism, but then things were flying off the walls. The mirror behind them shattered. Fieri was clearly shaken by all this, but Isaac was confident. He kept chanting as the conman he hired tried to stop him. He kept shouting about how "it's almost here" and "we're in the endgame"

Isaac left to go fill the bucket again and I was given a moment to try and get through to the conman. He had no intention of continuing the chanting. He knew all of this was a plan to get money, but Isaac was so adamant on continuing that he felt he had to keep going until he got results. 

I told him these are the results he was asking for and got him in on the plan. It was the only way to cut this shit short.

When Isaac got back in, he once again poured the water on my head after getting it "blessed" by the conman, and I started pretending to have a seizure. Once I stopped I put on the girl voice and channelled my best Disney villain impression.

Fieri hit me with more chants as I told him to, I started spitting expletives, and "passed out".

They untied me and dragged me to the couch, where I was left to "wake up", I waited a few minutes to really drive it home. The whole time they had the TV on, so it wasn't that hard to gauge how long I'd faked being out. 

But literally the moment I woke up, the TV was off and another circle of salt was put around the couch. The conman was nowhere to be found. Isaac was sat in front of me in the chair I was sat in. I tried to "stay in character" as best I could, but all Isaac did was stare at me. I was starting to freak the fuck out, asking where Chris was and where "the priest was", what he was doing, why he basically tortured me for 3 days straight, and still. nothing. 

I completely had enough, I tried to leave but once I stepped over the line of salt I actually passed out. Waking up back on the couch, still soaking wet, still shivering my ass off. I tried to leave a few more times, but each time I would either reach over the salt or my body touched it, I'd blink and I'd be back on the couch. 

A day passed and I lost most all of my energy. honestly i was shocked how i was still alive. Exhausted, no sleep, no food, no water despite being drenched in it, all caused by the man sitting in front of me, who i couldn't even touch because of a fucking salt line. It didn't even feel like a physical exhaustion, it was mental. I expended all my rage, and I hardly had any sorrow in me to begin with, and there was no way to feel joy in this place i was stuck in. 

Another day passed, and it occurred to me. I was dead, this was hell. Constantly reliving what my last moments probably were, on loop for eternity. In real life I figured I probably "woke up", tried to leave, and got my skull bashed in by the nutjob who thought i was possessed. Each time I left the circle, I would get knocked out, but I still tried to leave well over 3 hundred times. 

It's the only way I could rationalise what was happening to me, how any of this could've happened. 

A day passed. I tried to leave 55 times. 

A day passed. I tried to leave a single time.

Before I knew it, it was a week since I was put on the couch. 

A week in hell. 

A week of staring at the ever deteriorating husk of the monster that put me here. 

And it was finally, finally over.

I got up one more time and left the circle, this time finding myself in my actual apartment. Isaac was gone, I was wearing a completely different set of clothes, dry as a bone. TV was on, Chris on the computer in the other room, and I was free. 

I went over to ask Chris what the fuck just happened, but before I could say anything, he told me "don't ask anything."

so here I am. Isaac is nowhere to be found, Chris ignores anything I ask about, and nobody acts like anything happened. Like I didn't disappear for a week. There's no trace that any third person ever lived in our apartment, only that Chris was sent money from a separate account to cover a third of our rent. 

It's like it was being sent to and from two accounts owned by the same person. 

I'm moving out as soon as I can, probably going back to live with my parents. I have no clue what any of this means, but it probably means something and I don't have the mental energy to solve them. I never want to think about this again, and so long as I never see Chris again, I'm sure I can get away with that.
