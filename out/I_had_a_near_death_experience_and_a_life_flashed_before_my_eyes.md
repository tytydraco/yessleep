Part 1

“Hannah you honestly can’t be serious. I want to believe you but there’s just no way Jason would do that. Jason. He loves me.”

“Okay mom I won’t try to convince you anymore. I’ve been telling you this man has been hurting me for years. He touches me mom. He doesn’t love you. I’m 19 now I won’t stay here and let it happen to me anymo-“

“You shut your mouth Hannah” my mother said as she slapped me to the ground. 

I run from that prison she calls home and I’m walking down the sidewalk all around me are street lights. It isn’t late our neighbor, Laurie, is out walking her German shepherd. 

I didn’t bother to pack anything I was too much in a rush to leave that place before he returned. I knew my mom wouldn’t believe me. She never did. Her boyfriend has been assaulting me since I was 14 when he first moved into our house. She doesn’t listen. While she’s wrong for not believing her own daughter I’m not surprised. This man is a better liar than the most prominent politician. He could deceive God. 

Let me tell you a little about my life other than Jason completely ruining my childhood. My mother was the best right up until he came into our lives. My dad died when I was just 2 so it’s always been just us. My mom was never interested in other men until Jason. She was madly in love with my father. My mom used to be my best friend. I’d tell her about the crushes I had. All of my friends. She would always help with school work and she hosted the best sleepovers out of all my friend’s parents. 

I was a happy child for a long time. When I was 16 I got a job at a retail store so I could start saving money to leave my moms house. I’ve always wished we weren’t so alone. My dad was one of a kind according to my mom but his family is a different story all together. They wanted nothing to do with my mom or me. For reasons my mom won’t talk about. My moms family is either dead or estranged she won’t talk about her own family at all. So I have no where I can fall back. 

I wanted my mom to come with me. That was the start of this argument. That man is evil I told her. Just come live with me. I finally have enough money saved for a small apartment or trailer just come with me. I was begging her. “Hannah”

Lost in thought I finally heard someone calling my name. “Hannah Hannah come here girl” 

It was Jason. How he found me so quickly is beyond me. He was supposed to be working tonight. I had been walking down this sidewalk for 20 or 30 minutes I had already made it to a whole other neighborhood. And it was dark not as many streetlights and I was scared. So I started to run. 

And so did he. 

I had a good start on him so I thought I was safe if I just kept the distance between us. 

But Jason he ran towards me like his life depended on it. I guess it did in his mind. He knew what it meant to not have me under his finger anymore. He knew if I told anyone what he was doing to me all these years he would spend the rest of his life in prison. 

All I wanted was to get away. I didn’t want the trial or the hassle of sharing those things he did to me. Those things I let him do to me. Although I know it’s my trauma telling me that. Never changes the facts. I always felt like I could’ve I should’ve done more to protect myself from that monster.

I hear the pounding of his footsteps gaining on me. And somehow he manages to grab my hair.

I won’t go into detail about what he did to me in that small alley beside the sidewalk where it felt like the whole world could see but no one said anything no one stopped him. He beat me especially bad this night. He had a knife to my throat the entire time. I knew he intended to kill me. He stood up to put his pants back on and I saw my opportunity to get away.

I used every ounce of strength I had left and kicked him right in the balls and jumped to my feet. Clothes hanging off me like I was homeless which I guess I was. I made it to the sidewalk and it’s time to cross the street but I have to make sure he’s not behind me so I go to check and I see he’s still doubled over holding himself but he’s looking at me and he’s angry.

I ran across the street without a second look.

Tires screeching and the sound of brakes struggling. I heard glass shattering. And the last thing I saw was the blue chipped paint of the SUV that tried to keep from smacking into me slam right into me and pinned me against a telephone pole.
