It still watches me.

Back a couple years ago, I came back home from a date with my boyfriend at the time. At my house there’s a gazebo on my porch, it was huge.
I’ve always hated walking in the dark, so I got my boyfriend at the time to walk me to the doorstep.

While we were walking by the gazebo to walk up the porch steps, I felt something pierce into my ankle and try to drag me. It’s claws were wrapped around my ankle, and it’s nails was digging into my skin. 

My boyfriend was trying to get me away from whatever that damn thing was. 
It let out a blood curdling scream whenever my boyfriend got me loose.
In the moment, I froze. Because, this couldn’t be happening right? It’s not real? But my boyfriend saw it too. 
I felt it looking into my soul through my eyes.

It was the tallest thing I’d ever seen “person” wise. It was pitch black, it had these giant white eyes. It had a gaping mouth, but with no teeth? It was so boney. It’s ribs were huge, it made up most of the top part of its body. 
It was tall.

It left a bruise and scratch marks on my ankle. I had dirt all over my clothes.
My boyfriend was freaked out because he didn’t know what it was, neither did I? He helped me get cleaned off and changed my clothes after I took a shower. He aided my wound on my ankle.

A little bit after we never saw it again.
At to a peak I could only remember it’s face. I tried not to let it bother me a lot.
My boyfriend doesn’t remember much about that night either.
But weird occurrences happened.

I would wake up with long scratch marks down my back, from the top of my shoulders all the way down. 
I would find scratches all over myself and I felt as if something was watching me at every corner.
I started having these nightmares about that thing.

I can’t tell you how many times my boyfriend would have to shush me and lay me back down because I’d be yelling and panicking from the dream.
Then we met again, I was taking a bath
And it appeared again. It started choking me under the water, and I felt like I was fighting for my life.
When I got back up out of the water it finally let go. It was screaming, I felt my ears ringing.

My boyfriend had just gotten home and came to aid me and I guess comfort.
The thing has stayed since. It hasn’t gone away, I feel it’s eyes on me at every corner. 

I would see it in different places, my boyfriend would try to block it out. 
He’s also trying to look for another apartment or house to move in.
The thing is very unhappy about this and has tried to hurt my boyfriend multiple times.

Me and my boyfriend don’t leave each-other alone anymore because of this.
Right now I’m 7 months pregnant and me and my boyfriend doesn’t want to expose our child to this.
The thing is very aware of my pregnancy.

My boyfriend won’t leave me alone at any minute while this thing is here. We always see it in the main back corner of our bedroom. My boyfriend feels traumatized but tried to bury it down for me. I know he doesn’t want me stressed out but I don’t know what else to do. We want to tell someone professional but we would sound crazy. 

Me and my boyfriend try to stay out of the house so we don’t see it as much. We go to his parents house very often and stay there. His parents are aware of the situation and is worried about the our unborn child. 

Right now my boyfriend and I are at our house to pick up a few things. I’m waiting for him to get done and as I’m writing this it’s looking at me, standing a few feet away with its gaping mouth open. Me and my boyfriend are trying not to acknowledge it.
