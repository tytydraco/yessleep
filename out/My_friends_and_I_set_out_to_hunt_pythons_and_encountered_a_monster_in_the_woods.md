The fat cop tapped his fingers impatiently on the beige table in the dimly lit interrogation room. I suppose the dim light is supposed to be intimidating but, after eight hours of nearly nonstop questioning, it was more comforting than anything.

“Why don’t you tell me one more time what happened to your friends” he snarled, clearly unimpressed with the story I’d finished telling only moments ago. I inadvertently let out an exasperated sigh and dropped my head into my hands. He scribbled something into a small, coffee-stained notebook. Crossing his arms above his big belly, he leaned back onto his too-small metal folding chair and silently waited for me to respond.

“I’ve told you three times already.”

“Well tell me again!” he demanded, punctuating the sentence with one loud smack of his open palm on the rickety table between us. I jumped, not expecting the sudden increase in volume.

“Okay!” I yelped. “Okay... It was a hot day...”

\~ \~ \~ 

It was a hot day in South Florida and the iguanas were sunning themselves on the vibrant green grass lining the canal. The airboat bounced gently as it floated atop the water towards our drop-off point in the Everglades. Beau, the airboat operator, was telling us a long-winded story about his time in Vietnam during the war. I think he was happy to be in the presence of other veterans, though Alex, Rick, and I spent our time serving in the Middle East. A far cry from the forests of Vietnam. A far cry, too, from the humid, mosquito-filled air of the Everglades. The three of us really were out of our element as we headed deeper and deeper into the swampy wilderness.

"If I were 20 years younger, and 'bout 50 pounds lighter, I'd join you boys out there today and show you how it's done" chimed Beau, patting his rotund belly. "Ain't nothing sound more fun than blastin' the head off a python, or so I'd imagine." He released the controls of the airboat just long enough to pantomime the motion of repeatedly shooting a rifle with his calloused hands. This made me chuckle. Looking around the boat, it occurred to me that we really were just a bunch of middle aged buffoons looking to relive our glory days. Alex, Rick, and I intended to do so by hunting an invasive species of python through the thick brush of the South Floridian wetlands. Beau did so by transporting us from shore to wetland on our mission like the Vietnam-era helicopter pilot he once was.

Alex, who had grown out a bushy handlebar mustache for exactly this occasion, had a pair of sleek, black night vision goggles dangling around his thick neck, despite the fact that we weren't planning to stay out past about 4pm. Rick, on the other hand, was wearing a short sleeve shirt -- though I had repeatedly warned him about thorns and poison ivy-- and had brought almost nothing in the way of survival gear except a leather tool belt that held a small pistol on one side and two bowie knives on the other. I would pay a lot of money to see him fight a 12-foot python in hand-to-hand combat but, if all went well, I might get to witness it for free. Since Rick was chronically underprepared, and Alex was chronically overprepared in all the wrong ways, I had purchased us each a new machete-- paying extra to have them professionally sharpened-- and insisted that we bring them along.

"Did you both bring your machetes?" I asked, hoping they'd remembered to pack at least one useful piece of equipment in their tattered camouflage backpacks.

"Sir, yes, Sir!" shouted Rick, planting his extended palm on his forehead in a traditional military salute, which had the dual purpose of answering my question and mocking me for asking it at all.

"You know you're not in charge out here. We don't have to listen to you anymore," said Alex. "But yes. I brought the damn machete." He was pretending to be a hard ass but I could see a hint of smile peeking out beneath his ridiculous facial hair. Unfortunately, and by the grace of God, these two idiots were my best friends, and I was excited for a long day of hiking, banter, and bloodshed.

\~\~\~

"Bloodshed?" the cop repeated, flipping his lips downward as he scribbled in his miniature notebook. I didn't have to look to closely to see that his handwriting was borderline illegible and sloping slightly downward as the sentence went on, and on, and on. He must have thought that bit was important.

"Python blood," I clarified.

He let out a gruff chuckle, which turned into a continuous dry cough as he waved his hand for me to continue.

\~\~\~

By the time we arrived on the island, we each had a mile wide grin plastered on our faces. We gathered up our supplies and, one by one, stepped off the boat and onto the soft mucky embankment. My brand new boots immediately began sinking into the brown sludge, which was roughly the same texture as bread pudding. Alex and Rick shifted their feet from one position to another, trying to fight gravity, and failing just as I was. I pulled a granola bar out of my backpack and ate while listening to Beau's instructions and the pitter patter of small critters chasing one another beneath the underbrush. There was a small gator, only a few feet long, warming its cold blood on the opposite side of the channel. The sun reflected beautifully off its rough exterior and I understood why women once paid good money for alligator skin shoes and handbags.

"Alright, boys. I'll wait here. Head back before the sun gets to settin', you hear?" he said while attaching wriggling live bait to the hook on the end of his fishing pole. He leaned back in the captains chair, fetched a cold beer from the styrofoam cooler between his feet, and cast his fishing line into the algae tinted water beside the boat. "Ya'll have fun now and holler if ya'll need rescuin'!"

He must have thought that was a funny joke because I could hear his continuous laughter slowly fading as we walked away, heading steadily into the damp woods. We walked for quite some time, violently slicing through vines and briars with our recently sharpened machetes, partially for ease of mobility through the thick foliage but mostly just for fun. I felt vindicated that, despite the ridicule I’d endured for insisting upon the machetes, they were already proving both useful and entertaining.

We hadn't been off the boat fifteen minutes before my upper lip sweat began beading up and running down both sides of my chin, leaving a trail of dewy moisture reminiscent of Alex's mustache. The air was chicken noodle soup, and we were the overcooked carrots floating in the warm, salty broth. My sopping wet shirt clung to my skin and my too-long hair stuck to my forehead. The heavy backpack digging into my shoulders was filled to capacity with water bottles but I'd began to fear they wouldn't last.

"Woo-eee," howled Rick, wiping sweat off his forehead and flicking it onto the ground, "it's god damn hot as shit out here." Rick had a way with words. If he hadn't been such a damn fine soldier, he may well have been a poet.

I could hear the words before they even came out of his mouth and began rolling my eyes in advance. "You know what they say," said Alex, right on cue, "it's not the heat. It's the humidity." Rick and I let out an audible groan in unison. It echoed slightly and sounded almost melodic against the din of invisible crickets and almost imperceptibly buzzing gnats.

We continued on, mostly in silence punctuated by the occasional outburst as one or the other of us was bit by something swarming, crawling, or flying across our arms and necks. Alex liked to help Rick by smacking the mosquitos on the back of his head with a bit of extra force, to ensure that they were really dead. Rick, in turn, would shove Alex forward and laugh as he weaved and bobbed in the silty mud trying to regain his balance. It seemed there wasn't a single dry patch of land for miles. The entire Earth may well have been a puddle for all the splashing we were doing as we headed steadily into the wilderness, further and further away from Beau and his cooler full of refreshing, ice cold beer. Hopefully, there would be three left for us when we returned to the boat this afternoon.

"God damn it! I haven't seen one damn living thing out here except you idiots. Not a bird or a squirrel or a gator and definitely not no damn python", Rick whined as he stabbed through the bark of a tree with his favorite bowie knife. The one with a carved deer bone handle. He was right. We'd been fighting our way through thorns and gloopy muck for at least two hours now and hadn't seen so much as a lizard in the last fourty-five minutes. Rick twisted the knife around in the tree, clearly upset that he hadn't had the chance to shoot his shiny new gun.

"You know what it means when it's quiet like this?" Alex asked, gesturing his arms vaguely towards our lush surroundings. Rick slipped his knife back into it's leather holster and turned towards us, waiting for Alex to finish his thought. We stood silently for a moment with nothing but the incessant humming of hungry mosquitos to indicate that there were other living creatures in the woods besides the three of us.

He continued in a whisper, as though he feared the mosquitos might overhear something private. "It means there aren't any prey animals left." Rick and I exchanged a sideways glance. Alex leaned in close and lowered his voice even further. "If there's no prey, there must be an abundance of predators." With that, he stood up straight and returned to his normal speaking voice. "Come on, guys, we must be getting close to the pythons. Maybe we'll even find a nest. You know, they pay extra if you find a nest."

I couldn't fault his logic, though I didn't much like it. I suppose I should be thrilled at the thought of an abundance of pythons. More pythons means more to shoot at, and a higher chance of actually hitting something. Though the thought of an *abundance* of giant, slithering reptiles sent a shiver down my spine. Or maybe that was just a bead of sweat. I don't know how many pythons I was expecting, or hoping, to encounter, but it certainly wasn't any more than three. One for each of us. Maybe that had been naïve. They are invasive after all.

Alex and Rick began pushing their way forward through the vines. I followed mindlessly though I began to feel unsettled in my surroundings. We trudged on for ten or so minutes, maybe more, without saying a word to one another. The entangled branches and cascading vines around us were suffocating. The briars were knives and the mud was quicksand. Clearly dehydration was beginning to set in. "Hey, I'm going to stop for a minute. You guys go on ahead," I announced.

"You sure?" asked Alex, looking around warily, "I'll tell you, I'm not sold on the idea of putting much distance between us. Even though I don't particularly care for you fellas."

I threw my backpack onto the muddy ground and used it as a makeshift chair. It was lumpy and uncomfortable. "Don't worry, I'll catch up. Your damn stomping is scaring away all the pythons anyway," I joked, stamping my foot on the soggy leaves to imitate his heavy walk.

"He has a point, Alex," added Rick, "Maybe we should go different directions for a bit. We only have another two hours or so before we need to start heading back towards Beau, anyway. We could meet back up at the boat."

I choked on my water. The thought of splitting up for more than a minute or two made me uncomfortable but I felt I couldn't protest since, in a way, it had been my idea in the first place. Despite, or especially because of, everything we'd been through together, I didn't want to let the guys know that I was feeling apprehensive. After all, what we were doing amounted to no more than a walk in the woods. We'd been through worse than this in basic training. I put on a brave face, knowing that if I didn't, they'd relentlessly mock me every chance they got for at least the rest of our trip, maybe longer.

"Good idea, Rick," I replied, turning to Alex, "unless you're too chicken." Rick laughed and flapped his arms like wings, teasing Alex in exactly the same childish way I had been afraid of them teasing me. Alex sighed in response. "Fine, we can split up. Just don't go too far. Try not to do anything stupid, and, I don't know, yell if you need help or something, okay?" he relented.

"Aye, Aye, Cap'n" Rick barked, snapping his palm onto his forehead in the same overexaggerated salute he'd used on me back at the boat.

After I divvied up what little water I had remaining in my backpack, we said our goodbyes, and headed off in a different direction. Rick slapped my ass as he headed past me towards a slight opening in the trees to the west. Alex raised his hands up above his head and fashioned his fingers into peace signs, in what I'm assuming was intended to be a mediocre Richard Nixon impression, before stepping over a downed tree and disappearing into the woods to the north. The crunching of leaves under boots slowly faded away until, eventually, I heard nothing at all. My heartbeat and breathing were the only audible sounds left to hear as I stood alone in the wilderness. Turning slowly in a circle, I surveyed my surroundings and considered which direction I should take further into the woods, if I should go further at all. Images of Beau lounging in his captains chair, fitting another worm to his fishing hook flashed through my mind and I briefly considered abandoning my pursuit and heading back to the boat early.

It wasn't so much the silence as the oppressive stillness that bothered me. Large trees with interwoven branches loomed overhead blocking every hint of a breeze. Nothing splashed in the murky puddles. Nothing scurried along in the bushes. There wasn't so much as a rustle of the leaves to suggest the presence of a single living creature, hidden from view by the dense foliage, and while I'd never cared much for squirrels, I found myself longing to catch even a glimpse of one.

Since Rick had gone west, and Alex north, I chose to continue on in the direction we'd already been headed before splitting up-- east. It seemed to be the direction with the most amount of space between the trees, making it easier to slip through the foliage without expending too much energy hacking through vegetation. My machete arm was beginning to ache. So were my feet. Blisters had begun to form between my big toe and its neighbor as my slightly too-small shoes crammed them together with each step.

It had been more than ten minutes since the crunching of Alex and Ricks boots behind me had faded into memory and the oppressive stillness of the woods enveloped me completely. I passed the time and ignored the pain in my feet the same way I had in basic training, by imagining which famous sitcom characters would win in a cage match. I was torn between Kramer from *Seinfeld* and Phoebe from *Friends*, leaning towards Phoebe, when I first noticed the smell.

The scent of decomposition lingered in the moist air, sticking to my skin and my clothes. Even when I held my breath, I could smell it. I could almost taste it, even. I pulled my wet shirt over my mouth and nose, breathing through the fabric to block the acrid smell. Though really all it did was replace the rotting smell of decomposition with the sour smell of my own rancid sweat.

The branches and roots in this small clearing were strewn, snapped and broken, across the ground, and in the center, laid the bloated corpse of a deer. My feet, without the consent of my brain, much less my nose, walked me closer to the corpse. I stopped a foot or two back, blocked from moving closer by an impenetrable, almost palpable, curtain of the sickly sweet scent of decomposition, carried back and forth from the rotting deer to my nostrils on the wings of buzzing flies. From this distance I could see that the deer had certainly not died of natural causes, unless you consider having your rib cage snapped and broken inward to be natural. The corpse was mangled in a way I hadn't noticed from the edge of the clearing, with a collapsed ribcage and twisted spine, causing its front and back legs to jut out in opposite directions. The eyes, at least, the bits of them that hadn't been overtaken by flies and maggots, bulged outward from the sockets as though they had tried to flee, leaving the rest of the body behind.

Any creature capable of crumpling a deer like an empty aluminum can must be much stronger than any I'd be comfortable encountering in the wild, at least not without shitting my pants. My eyes scanned the tree line, searching through the leaf litter and swaying vines for any hint of something that might be waiting for an opportune moment to attack. My knuckles turned white as I squeezed my fingers around the hilt of my machete. My heart wasn't racing so much as pounding in my chest. My position in the open clearing left me more vulnerable than I cared to admit in the moment. Slowly, very slowly, I turned to examine the trees behind me, where I could have sworn I'd heard the faintest sound of twigs breaking only moments before. I held my breath and stared straight ahead, daring the creature to make an appearance and meet the newly sharpened edge of my machete. A minute went by. Then two, maybe more, and nothing, not so much as a lizard, came forward into the clearing. My heart rate slowly returned to its steady rhythm. The tension in my shoulders released. Animals kill each other in the woods all the time. This was nothing out of the ordinary. I let out a chuckle, and made a mental note to tell the boys all about the mutilated deer when we met up later. Beau, more than anyone, would be interested in hearing about the more gruesome aspects of our day, decomposing deer corpses included.

I'd only just released the hilt of my machete, allowing the blood to return to my knuckles, when my relief was interrupted by an abrupt and piercing scream. My viscera lurched inside me at the shock of such a vibrant sound. A second scream tore through the tree tops from what sounded like the direction Rick had gone after we split up. We hadn't been walking for long so he couldn't be far behind me. I ran, trampling my own muddy footprints and taking a branch to the eye as I forced my body through the trees.

"Rick?" I yelled, "Rick?"

A gunshot echoed through the trees in response. A single bird burst through the leaves and flew overhead, proving I hadn't imagined the sudden noise. "RICK" I screamed, louder this time. As loud as my dry mouth would allow. My throat began to feel desiccated and my tongue stuck to my soft palate with every swallow.

Rick did not respond. Not another scream or even a yelp to direct the wild movement of my body through the dense brush. The bird, perhaps my only living companion in these woods, had fled in the opposite direction. Tears stung my eyes, even more so in the eye that had been scratched by the branch. I yearned for even a brief glimpse of my friends. A peek of a t-shirt through the leaves. A flash of skin as they ran past. The glint of a machete. A single sound would be welcome. A screech. A cough. A barrage of insults, even. Anything besides the hollow echo of my rapid breath and the whir of swarming gnats.

I'd only vaguely perceived a rustling in the branches in front of me before I collided violently with a person moving just as wildly in the opposite direction. "God damn it all to hell!" Alex cursed, having landed hard in on his ass in the mud. "You the one doing all that damn screaming? What the hell're you shooting at?" He stood and brushed the mud off the seat of his pants before helping me to my feet.

"It'd better be a damn huge python and you'd better've hit it square as hell on for all that hollering. You scared the every loving shit out of me, man," he scolded.

"Wasn't me," I replied, gulping air into my lungs, "must have been Rick. Haven't seen him yet. I heard him screaming, same as you."

"God damn it." Alex threw his hat onto the ground like an angry baseball coach on the sidelines of a losing game. "I bet that asshole is fucking with us."

A glint of light caught my eye. The reflection of a single sunbeam off a metal object partially covered by wet, brown leaves on the sodden ground. My dry mouth became, somehow, drier. "I don't think he's fucking with us, Alex."

We'd collided at the entrance to another small clearing, clearly created through forceful means as the palms and shrubbery had been disturbed. The trees were bent and broken at unnatural angles, as though they'd been intentionally snapped. The smaller plants had been flattened against the leaf covered ground. "This looks similar to the clearing where that deer got crushed," I said.

"What the fuck are you talking about, Dan?" Alex demanded. Right, I hadn't told him about the deer. When would I have had the chance. Before I could explain, I was silenced by the the pressure of a heavy, slithering sensation atop my boots.

I wasn’t particularly afraid of snakes but having one writhing in place on top of an appendage was certainly not my favorite. And this one felt very large. Though I suppose that's the problem with pythons, isn't it. They're usually large. Slowly looking down, I was surprised to see not scales but a long, pink lump of muscle, split on one end. The forked end of the tongue squirmed and flitted about over my boots and the bottom of my pants. I choked on my breath, afraid to turn my head and see the snake that may be attached to the other end of such a massive tongue. A stifled gasp sounded beside me and I knew that Alex had noticed the tongue, and probably the snake it was attached to.

"Dan..." he whispered, gripping my bicep with an unnecessarily strong hand.

"I see it," I replied, eyes steadily fixed on my feet and feet planted like an oak tree in the ground.

"It's his machete," he said, raising a pointed finger towards a scatter of trampled bushes on the opposite edge of the clearing. The tongue receded from my boots, back into what I could only imagine to be the fanged maw of the single largest living being on the planet. The crunch of dry leaves sounded out beside me, like beneath a boot clad foot on a city sidewalk in autumn, as the massive creature slithered away to who knows where. I couldn't bring myself to look up and see which way it was going. My breath caught in my throat, too afraid to exit my lungs and enter the hellish wetlands that the rest of us had walked into willingly. The ringing in my ears was so loud that Alex's words sounded warbled and far away as he tried to get my attention. The *womp womp womp* of his urgent pleas barely registered as anything more than the wind rustling through the trees.

He smacked me on the back of my head. "Dan! Look!"

"Huh? Ricks machete?" I asked. His words crashed into my brain all at once. Right, the metal object on the ground. I turned my attention towards the silver glint at the end of his outstretched arm. Alex was right. Ricks machete was laying a few meters away, partially obstructed by branches and mud. Alex picked it up and examined it. The previously shining, never before used blade was now slightly bent and partially coated in a mix of mud and a slick reddish brown liquid.

We stood, looking at the blade, digesting it's meaning in the sweltering humidity. We'd both seen enough bloody weapons to recognize the red brown coating on the blade and we'd both seen enough sharp force trauma to hope the blood wasn't human. There were no other signs of Rick in the clearing. Not his backpack, gun, knives, tank top, boots, bad attitude, or sarcastic comments. Certainly not his body, dead or alive.

"He must have been attacked by that big ass fuckin' snake," I finally offered, thinking this the most logical conclusion.

"What the fuck are you talking about, man?" Alex asked. He shot me a look that would have made Medusa shut her eyes and run.

"The big ass snake that was licking my boots over there." I pointed to the faintly visible track of a large slithering belly in the mud. It was wider than I would have guessed and I'd have guessed it was about a meter wide.

"Shut the fuck up, Dan," Alex snapped. "This is fucking serious, okay? You of all people should understand that. Rick is somewhere around here, missing his machete and probably fucking bleeding and you're going on about, what? Dead deer and big ass pythons? We haven't seen one god damn python all god damn day, Dan." He was shaking the machete around for emphasis and only narrowly avoided slicing me into ribbons.

His tirade was interrupted as a snake the size of a Ford F150 and twice the height— not including the portion of its body obstructed from my view— rose up, out of the brush, and loomed mere inches behind Alex. Before I could utter a warning, a massive pink tongue flitted across the back of his neck. He shuddered, dropping the machete, and slapped the back of his neck as though the tongue were merely a spider or a fly or some other inconsequential being. "Alex, do not turn around," I commanded, reaching my arms out to grab him.

"Why?" Alex asked, "what are you looking at?" The snake loomed higher, becoming, somehow, even larger and more imposing than it had been moments ago. Its yellow eyes locked on mine as I pulled Alex closer to me. "Just do not turn around. Walk forward slowly. Towards me," I repeated.

He turned around. Of course he turned around. All men will turn around when asked not to, just as all men reach out to touch artwork in a gallery even though, or specifically because, there are posted signs directing them not to do so. The next moments were a blur. Alex screamed, as expected. So did I. He ran, or attempted to run, but didn't get far before the unhinged jaws were around him in his entirety, swallowing him down, down, down into what I can only hope was a quick and painless death. For a second, before he disappeared completely behind pointed teeth, I saw only a pair of mud caked, worn down boots against the empty blue sky of the clearing.

There was nothing left to do but run, and so I did. As fast as I could. Shedding gear as I jumped over logs and tripped through puddles. Briars dug through my shirt and into my flesh, ripping, and tearing as I forced my body through tight spaces at great speed. Sweat ran down my arms, mixing with blood, and stinging my wounds.

~/~/~

"Is that what happened here?" the cop asked, gesturing his meaty palm toward the thin scabs lining my arms from my shoulders to my fingertips.

I nodded. "See, those look to me like the kinda wounds someone might leave behind if they were fighting for their life. Or, lives, in this case." He raised an eyebrow and watched my face.

"These scratches are from the briars," I repeated, keeping my voice and my face as still and emotionless as I could manage under the circumstances.

He let out a chuckle as he flipped to a new page in his notebook and wrote a few more sentences before pausing briefly to scribble the pen in circles at the top of the page. He tossed the pen in a wire wastebasket in the corner of the room and stood up.

"I'm going to refill my coffee. While I'm gone, you better think real hard about how you want this story to end 'cause right now it's not looking too good for you, son."

Left alone in the dark interrogation room, I wondered what Alex and Rick would think of this situation. Alex would know exactly what to say to the cop to smooth everything over. He was always good with authority. He was the only private who could show up to inspection with a wrinkled uniform and not get his ear drums blown out by the drill sergeant. Rick. on the other hand, would inevitably make me laugh despite the looming threat of serving twenty-five to life. He'd do a surprisingly accurate impression of a community college dropout turned unreasonably stern cop and I'd forget, for a moment, that he was dead and that I was being blamed for it.

The cop re-entered the room, pen in one hand, coffee in the other. He'd been gone for long enough that my tears had dried, leaving only clean streaks in my grime covered face to show they were ever there. For the first time since I'd stepped off Beaus airboat, alone, I admitted to myself how exhausted I really was. Emotionally and physically. I was more than ready for this to be over so I could curl up in bed and sleep for days, and days, and days. Even if it meant I had to sleep on the top bunk above a heavily-tattooed guy named Diesel who snores like a chainsaw and brews hooch in an aluminum toilet.

"Alright," grunted the cop, "you were running through the woods and getting all tore up by 'briars.'" He emphasized the last word and raised his hands to mime an exaggerated quotation mark.

"Right," I agreed, "the briars."

~/~/~

I don't remember a whole hell of a lot after that. Somehow, I managed to find Beau. He was sitting on his boat, just where we'd left him. Drinking beer and fishing, just like he'd said he would be. I launched myself from shore onto the boat, screaming and hollering for him to start the engine and get the hell out of there as fast as he could. "Where are the t'others?" he asked. "Dead, I hope," I replied. We argued for a minute, I think. He asked me questions. Question after question, quickly, and at a high volume. I don't remember what he asked, and I don't remember what, or if, I'd answered, but eventually the boat was moving quickly across the water. Away from the snake, which is all that really mattered anymore. The ride back was silent except for the whir of the motor and the gasping sobs escaping from my mouth. Though, Beau must have phoned the police. The sun had sunk well below the horizon by the time we made it back to shore but every detail of the dock and palm trees were visible in the blue and red light of the waiting cop cars and ambulances.

~/~/~

"Blue and red light, huh?," repeated the cop. "You think this is some kind of creative writing class, son? This ain't no damn joke. You understand?"

"You asked me to tell you what happened. Well, that's what happened," I replied.

“Right, right," he said, closing his notebook and folding his beefy hands together on the table. "So you really expect me to believe that your friends were eaten by some big snake?” His perpetually raised eye brow silently mocked me.

“A very big snake," I clarified, “and no, I honestly don’t, but I don’t know, maybe you and some other officers could go out and see for yourselves. It might still be hungry.”

"Oh, don't you worry, son. We've got officers out there now. Matter o' fact, I heard they already found that bent up, blood covered machete you mentioned. It's been sent off for fingerprinting and DNA testing. I have no doubt we'll find your fingerprints on the hilt and the blood of at least one, if not both, of those young men on the blade. That should be enough for any jury 'round these parts."

He tightened a pair of handcuffs around my wrists. A little too tight, if you asked me. They really weren't necessary as I had no plan to run or to fight. The solitude of the holding cell was more than welcome after hours of non-stop questioning. It is said that the truth will set you free but the sound of the key in the lock was proof that the truth will set you free only if it is believable to those with a limited view of reality. The rusty bed frame creaked beneath my weight as I laid down. This may well be a king bed at the Ritz Carlton for how tired I was. I closed my eyes and prayed to the universe, or whichever deity was listening, that I would dream of anything, anything other than snakes.
