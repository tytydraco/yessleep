>*We at the Organization have been paying close attention to this subreddit! We have noticed your enthusiasm and engagement with the post “Tape Labelled One Hour Photo.” In an attempt to get ahead of the media, we're here to answer any questions you have about the work once and for all! This way we can avoid any sort of confusion about the work. We have selected the questions from some of the top comments on the original post to answer here.*

&#x200B;

Q: Is the tape labeled “One Hour Photo” real?

A: No. The Tape is not real.

&#x200B;

Q: Is the apocalypse real?

A: No. The Apocalypse is not real.

&#x200B;

Q: What was the reason for the title of the tape?

You're probably wondering what this is by now and how it's being sent to you.

A: The original author of the work refuses to comment on this. The entry was a submission for one of

our many creative writing programs we have for employees at the Organization. We host various

writing and art events at our company to promote creativity! One Hour Photo is a service offered in

stores like Snapfish and Walmart that allows customers to have their photographs printed on high

quality materials. The photos are either delivered or sent to the store via e-mail and it takes about one

hour for the photos to be made. Some stores even offer to develop film from older cameras, isn't that

cool?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Q: What was the reason for the lake of fire and the giant hand at the end of the world?

A: The original author of the work refuses to comment on this. The lake of fire may represent

pollution and global warming, and the hand may represent humankind part in the climate disaster we

currently find ourselves facing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Q: Why is the story about a hurricane?

A: We all remember 2005 and the damage brought by that particular hurricane season. Many of

us lost so much in that year that a hurricane is very much a fear that is still relevent.

&#x200B;

Q: What is the Organization? Are they bad guys?

A: While we appreciate our employees creativity in making our company a part of their writing

submission, the way we are portrayed is part of why we wanted to take this opportunity to talk to you,

the community! While the name “The Organization” may imply some amount of suspicious activity,

we are a simple pharmaceutical company with various philanthropic and cultural programs all around

the world. After our merger we picked a simple name for our company because we wanted our

actions in the world to speak for themselves. All of our funding comes from publicly named donors

and various government grants you can all find on our website! In addition to operating our business

in total transparency in accordance to the law, we have also made several of our medications without

patent so that they can be produced by pharmacies all over the world to the benefit of mankind!

It's a little hard to get in here so you need to focus.

&#x200B;

Q: What is the United States Department of Spiritual Health?

A: The United States Department of Spiritual Health is a program created by the United States

Surgeon General Dustin Moore in 1988. The USDSHM was created as a branch of the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and

was created with the same mission statement. The USDSHM is dedicated to the health and safety of

the citizens of the United States of America. Many of the medications and machines  produced by the

Organization are used by the USDSHM in order to extend the lifespan of human beings as well as

provide afterlife care.

&#x200B;

It's 1:30 in the morning. You are reading stories on your phone. Nothing is wrong, nothing is

outside your house right now. That doesn't mean you should go looking.

Go inside your bathroom. Look into your mirror. Maintain eye contact with your reflection and repeat

your name. Wait until your reflection blinks. You are now safe.

Q: Are ghosts real?

A: Everyone knows that ghosts are real.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You're probably wondering what this is by now and how it's being sent to you. It doesn't matter how, but you need to know some things and sometimes it's easier to send a flea instead of a bird. All that

having been said, you have no reason not to trust your government at least.

Q: What does WFTV stand for?

A: WFTV is a call sign for the news television station in Orlando, Florida in the USA. The W

indicates that is is a station east of the Mississippi river. In 1923 the station WLOF-TV changed their

sign to WFTV (Wonderful Florida Television) as a celebration of their fifteenth anniversary

broadcasting. Isn't that cool?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Q: What was the \_\_\_\_\_\_?

A: The author of the work refuses to comment on this.

I haven't listened to the tape, but I know about it. It's obviously not the only one. There are copies,

sometimes it comes out a little differently. Sometimes the male reporter gets his head cut off live on

broadcast, sometimes other worse things happen in the hysteria. Each time though, IT comes and

normally around the fifty-four minute mark sometimes as last as fifty-eight the broadcast ends.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Q: What really happened during Hurricane Katrina?

A: There are a significant amount of people here who seem to claim that Hurricane Katrina was

a man-made disaster created by the government in order to cover up some type of experiment. What

we now know is that the hurricane that destroyed most of the eastern coast of the United States was

in fact a paranormal phenomenon. There are more in depth analysis of the event in detail on the

USDSHM I don't have enough time to paraphrase the whole video, but hopefully you'll believe that I'm

not faking here. There really is a video tape from another parallel world  and it shows a broadcast in

which the world ends. I'm not really smart enough to “get it” but people are saying things are lining up

that the same thing will happen to you. It's already happening here and I don't know how many other

times main website, but what we know is that the hurricane was “enhanced” by a current of

paranormal energy that has been drifting around the in the Atlantic Ocean for some indeterminate

amount of time.

Need to be more vigilant I don't know why but they are trying to hide this. Don't pray. You don't know what you are praying to. I've come here to warn you. They are going to offer you easy answers, find your own. Do your best, and just know what it happens there is nothing you are going to be able to do about it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Q: Is God real?

A: No, God is probably not real.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Q: What happened to Air Force One during the story? Did President Bush die?

A: We are aware of the Internet's proclivity to make absurd inside jokes but we have no idea

who this could be referring to.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Q: Where is the Organization located?

A: We are located all over the world with headquarters in Orlando and San Francisco, as well as

research facilities in Lunenburg, Saarloq, Dakar and Georgetown.

There is something in the Atlantic Ocean. I'm taking a big risk communicating so openly like this. It's likely to cause more problems but I'm sorry if the transmissions comes through a little choppy; it's all going to end soon. For me at least.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Q:

A: The author doesn't wish to be named and would like to remain anonymous for the benefit of her family and friends.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Q:

A: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ was a devastating Category 5 Atlantic hurricane that resulted in 1,393 fatalities

and caused damage estimated between $97.4 Billion to $145.5 billion in late August 2005, particularly

in the city of New Orleans and it's surrounding areas. It was the costliest tropical storm on record, and

damage as far as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ was recorded. Isn't that cool?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Q:

A: No, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_	is not real.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Q: What should we do?

A: Keep taking your vitamins. Smile a little more widely and more generously. Tell your friends

you love them, hold them close when you can. If you have family you still like, have a meal with

them. You never know when it will be all over.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Q: What is happening to you?

A: The world is ending. But for me not you. Currently the sky is red and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ writhe

through the sky, they're beautifully terrifying. Booming voices from the sky are telling me to kill

myself. I'm alone in my house with something that we invented with the sole purpose of being able to

write this to you. I'm sorry if it doesn't make a lot of sense, we didn't have a lot of time and I had to

hijack another post. It may have had some unintended consequences. Go to the mirror, is your

reflection still there? Is a minute still 100 seconds long?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Q:

A: I just thought you needed to know. You should know. We did. And there was still nothing we could do.

&#x200B;

Q: Is the tape labeled “One Hour Photo” real?

A: No. The Tape is not real.
