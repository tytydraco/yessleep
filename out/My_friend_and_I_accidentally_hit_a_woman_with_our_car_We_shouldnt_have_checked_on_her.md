I always loved going on road trips with my friends. There was something about being on the open road, with nothing but the wind in your hair and the promise of adventure ahead. So when my friend Tim suggested we take a detour through a small town in the middle of nowhere, I was all for it.

The town was quaint and charming, with old-fashioned buildings and friendly locals. We stopped at a diner for some lunch, and that's when we saw her. A woman sitting in the corner, her eyes fixed on us with an intensity that made me shiver.

We tried to ignore her and focus on our food, but something about her made us uneasy. And when we left the diner and started driving again, we realized that she was following us.

We tried to shake her off, taking a few turns here and there, but she was always right behind us. It was like she knew exactly where we were going. And then, just when we thought we had lost her, she appeared in front of us, standing in the middle of the road.

We slammed on the brakes, but it was too late. We hit her with a sickening thud, and I felt bile rise up in my throat. We got out of the car, dazed and horrified, and that's when we realized something even more terrifying.

The woman was still alive.

Her body was twisted and broken, but she was still breathing, still staring at us with those intense eyes. We tried to help her, to call for an ambulance, but she just kept muttering something incoherent.

And then, suddenly, she sat up. Her eyes rolled back in her head, and her body contorted in ways that I didn't think were possible. She let out a blood-curdling scream, and then, just as suddenly as it had started, it was over.

She lay still on the ground, her body a twisted mess of flesh and bone. And then, from within the pile, I heard a sound that made my blood run cold.

We heard a low, guttural growl coming from the woman's mouth. It was a sound that didn't seem human, and it sent a shiver down my spine. As we stood there, frozen with fear and shock, the woman's body began to twitch and convulse.

Suddenly, she sat up again, her eyes wide open and filled with a terrifying, otherworldly energy. Her skin began to peel away, revealing something dark and twisted beneath it. It was like watching a nightmare come to life before our very eyes.

We stumbled backwards, trying to get away from the horror unfolding in front of us. But the woman seemed to be drawing closer, her body writhing with inhuman movements. It was then that I realized that whatever this was. It wasnâ€™t human.

Whatever this thing was, it had taken on the form of a human, but it was something much older and much darker. And it was coming for us.

With a scream, we turned and ran back to our car. But even as we drove away, I could feel the creature's presence still lingering in the air. It was like a cold, creeping feeling that seemed to follow us all the way home.

We never spoke of that day again, but the memory of that creature has haunted me ever since. It was a reminder that sometimes, the things we fear the most are the things that are closer than we think. And that, sometimes, the road less traveled can lead us down a path that we can never come back from.

But even now I can still sometimes hear that low growling noise from the darkness.
