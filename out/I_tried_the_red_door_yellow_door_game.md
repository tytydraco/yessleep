Hello! I would like to share an experience that I have through the game "Red door yellow door". Before I start I want express that I do not believe something supernatural happened, I know that the game is mostly psychological. Lastly, I share this experience because I would love to here other experiences from this game.  
  
So, I tried the game with my friend at my home. We sat in my bed and she started saying "Red door Yellow door White door" multiple times. I tried to "imagine" some doors and then suddenly I started having a very clear image of my "surounding" in my mind. So, basically, what I started seeing was a dark brick hallway and in front of me where 3 doors. A brown door at my right, a yellow one in front of me and a red one at my left.

  
So, she asked me what I see and I started explained to her the room. She asked which door I want to open and I told her that I would like to open the brown door at my right, so after that I went to the brown door and opened it. At first I saw nothing, it was just black but shortly after I saw a little far away a bench with a steet light next to it and a man sitting on it. The man had a long wizard hat and he was sitting as something was bothering him or just thinking. The man seemed to wear normal clothes, like a t-shirt or a jacket and pants but for some reason he also had his wizard hat on him. He had his one elbow on his leg and his hand on his head.

  
Anyways, when I saw this I just couldn't think anything and immediately started feeling very uncomfortable with the vibe. After 1 minute I think I just closed the door and I didn't tell anything to my friend. I felt like I din't want to tell her what I saw due to how uncomfortable I felt. Eventually, she pressured me to tell her and when I finally told her she got a little mad (with every right because is very important to tell everything to the guide person). After that I told her that I want to open the yellow door and I saw nothing. The same with the red door. When I told her that the 2 doors leaded to nothing she told me if I want to turn around and see what is behind me.  
  
I did and what I saw was the same dark brick hallway but this time it lead to 2 directions, left and right. In the middle wall was a light above, but the weird thing is that the light only lighted the right direction. The left direction was just black, as if there was an invisible wall that didn't let the light to pass.   
  
  
When I describe to her what I saw she asked me where I want to go and explained to her tha I wanted to fo the right direction because the left one didn't "let" the light be bright to its direction and I was scared to see what is there. So, I walked and went to the right direction, after I turned my head to see what is there I saw the same hallway with 2 directions and a light in the middle of the wall but this time was a tall man standing there.  
  
I couldn't see his face because he was looking down and had his hood on since he was wearing something like a grey ? hoodie jacket. His hand were fisted as he was about to fight me lol. He also was wearing jeans and simple white shoes like the adidas? anyways  
  
Even though I couldn't see his face, somehow I knew that he was around 25 years old and that he wasn't the first man that I saw. He was someone else and also that he wanted to harm me.  
  
I told my friend immediately what I saw and she told me to turn around and leave, I did, I turned around and walked fast but I already felt him beside me and because I was scared I opened my eyes and we stopped the game.  
  
My friend told me that my eyes where moving left and right all the time and also very fast, as I was "sleeping" you know and she could see my face when I felt uncomfortable and scared.  
  
After that, when I opened my eyes I just started crying.  
  
So yeah, this was my experience with this game, what do you think? have any of you achieved this game?
