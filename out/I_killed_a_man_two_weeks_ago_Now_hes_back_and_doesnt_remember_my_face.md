I was moving to Warbury, out of the banged up SUV I’d been holing up in for the past few months ever since I lost my job. After months missing rent even the nicest realtors will kick you out. I arrived late at night, probably 4:00 AM. I could’ve planned better, but I received the news of my father’s passing and my inheritance in the evening, and I was aching to sleep on something that wasn’t some shitty car seat.

 I was excited, and yeah, I feel bad about my dad, but I hadn’t talked to him since my childhood, and this would’ve been my first night off the street for a while. 

Being in a new town was really weird. It was obvious everyone knew each other, and had their own goings-on, but arriving late at night you couldn’t really help but feel like you were disturbing society–like some stalker that didn’t belong. The nerves really got to me.

I was walking down the street, bunched up in a coat I bought three years ago, and it could hardly maintain any warmth. It was wet, too, it’d just rained and the sidewalk’s divots had pooled into little brown spills. 

I saw some guy walking down the street too, he was on the other side of the road. He crossed the road behind me. I told myself he wasn’t following me, but with his hood pulled up and the time of night, I decided to make a move, even if it was just to ease my nerves.

I blurted, “You need anything?” 

He didn’t respond, he just kept walking.

 At that point I was getting nervous, why the fuck would a guy be following me in the middle of the night? 

“Hey, stop.” 

No response, just the continued rhythmic splishes as he walked.

He wasn’t stopping.

 I reached for my gun, tucked away in my sweats.   

“Stop. I’m not going to ask again.” 

He didn’t.

I pulled out my gun, and fired twice, piercing his chest. 

The kid dropped to the ground. He was only a fucking teenager, couldn’t’ve been more than 16. a hoodie on his head, a mass of soggy brown hair,

and airpods in his ears.

**Fuck.**

The music was loud enough that I could hear the rhythm pittering out from the earbuds.

He was a good kid. Going places. 

His name was Joey, went to the local high school, good parents, a happy home. More than I ever had.

I took that away. 

I didn’t even call the police. I just ran.

The police had nothing they could pin on me, but the people around town knew. 

It was obvious, a new guy in town, and a kid ends up dead on the same night the guy arrives. The death stares and the rumors, the closed blinds in town. I was the enemy. But it didn’t last long. Because two weeks later, Sunday, *Joey* was back. 

Don’t know how the fuck it happened. A miracle?

Not with my goddamn luck. 

And I had that straight. It wasn’t zombie shit though—*god I wish it was*. I was scared shitless for days, to be honest, I had myself up in my old man’s house like it was the Walking Dead.

Til’ *he* came to deliver the newspaper. Dad must’ve never cancelled his subscription.

That’s when I got a real good look at him: Not a zombie, normal clothes, didn’t even seem to remember me, yet I still had to feel fuckin’ guilty. I killed that kid, but he’s back. It was an accident, and there weren't any *real* consequences, so it mustn't’ve counted, yeah? I didn’t even buy that gun to use it, I was mugged a few months back and I just needed it to feel safe again.

Anyways, it’s Tuesday now. I haven’t been out of the house a lot, and I don’t know what I’m going to do about Joey, but even from the tiny amount I saw of him before his death, something seemed off. If I get a chance, I’ll try to write back here again.
