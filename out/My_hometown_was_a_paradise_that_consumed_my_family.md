Pilar was always a strange place. From an outsider’s perspective, it looked like paradise - the walls of lush, tall trees framing a seemingly endless carpet of bright green grasslands, accompanied by a constant cool wind, and an ever-present silence that only amplifies the uncomfortable aura this place holds. But to me, and the people of this little village, it was nothing but a mere blank canvas, awaiting for the brushstrokes of vivid viscera. There are a thousand stories I could tell to explain why I never wanted to come back. A thousand reasons buried beneath that beautiful, deceiving surface. 

I grew up poor. We were a family of farmers, and my sister, Joanne, and I learned early on that we weren’t like the kids we saw on TV. They had plastic toys, beautiful clothes, and all the time in the world to play. We had hand-me-downs, patched sandals, and chores waiting before the sun even finished rising. “Finish your rice,” Mama would say, scooping the last of the morning's food into our plates. “You’ll need the energy. Your father’s starting on the south field today.” And we knew what that meant; another day of planting under the blistering summer sun, sweat stinging our eyes, and dirt caked beneath our fingernails. But we didn’t mind. We knew what hard work looked like at a very young age. What love looked like, too. My father, tall, strong, and always smelling faintly of soil and sweat, made it his mission to carve little slices of wonder into our lives. Every weekend, no matter how tired he was, he’d take us exploring. 

We’d chase each other through the hills until our legs gave out. Swim in cold, glittering lakes while Mama waited at the shore, scolding us with a smile. Sometimes, if we were lucky, we’d trek to the hidden waterfall behind the western ridge. “Think there’s treasure behind it?” Joanne once asked, her tiny hand clutching his as we climbed the mossy rocks. “If there is,” he grinned, “it’s the look on your face right now.” She laughed. I did too. Those were the best days of my life. They lasted until I was about eleven years old.

I remember the day it all stopped. It was a Saturday afternoon, the kind where the air shimmered with heat and even the dogs lay flat in the shade. My father, though worn from hours in the fields, burst through the door with the biggest smile I’d ever seen. “Who’s ready to go for a swim?” he said, practically beaming with childish joy. Joanne and I sprang up. “Me!” she shouted, already grabbing her towel. “Not without me!” I called, chasing after her. Mama shook her head and laughed as she handed Father a cloth bag of boiled eggs, fresh fruit, and cooked rice. “Don’t stay out too long, be home by dinner. I’ll be preparing your favorite.” she warned. “And stay out of the deep part!” “No promises,” Father grinned.

From our small home, we walked past the rustling cornfields and sluggish carabao, then slipped through the crooked wooden gate that opened into the forest. The trees closed around us, their shade a welcome relief. We knew that trail by heart, every bend, every root and stone underfoot. Father led the way with his old machete, hacking vines and branches with that steady rhythm we loved. Then, just past a grove of narra trees, the trail broke open and the lake appeared. Calm. Shimmering with a blue heavenly hue. Paradise. Our little playground.

That afternoon, my father brought his makeshift fishing pole, a long bamboo stick with frayed line tied to the end. “Let’s see if your old man still has some luck,” he said, settling onto a flat stone by the water. Joanne and I stayed close to shore, laughing, splashing, chasing small fish in the shallows, collecting empty snail shells. It was the kind of joy only children know. It was loud, carefree, untouched. Hours slipped by, Father patiently trying and failing to hook a fish, each tug ending in disappointment, though he never let it show. Then the air shifted. A cold breeze rolled in, not the kind that signaled evening, but something heavier and unnatural. It draped over us like a damp shroud.

Father stopped humming. He didn’t stand, he snapped upright. His fishing pole clattered to the rocks. His hand gripped the machete before his face registered fear. “Out of the water,” he said, low and assertive. Joanne hesitated. “But Papa…” she whispered. “No, Jo. Get up. Now. Please.” His voice cracked on the last word. One of the scariest things a child can witness is the moment an adult breaks their illusion of control. The moment you realize they’re just as scared as you are. That was the moment I knew something was terribly wrong.

“Come on!” my father shouted, voice cracking with panic. He yanked Joanne by the arm and tore into the forest, crashing through the underbrush like a man possessed. “Papa, why are we running?” I gasped, chest tightening with each step, lungs burning from the cold, unnatural air. He didn’t answer. Just shot me a glance, fleeting but fierce, and in it I saw everything: fear, urgency, a silent scream. Joanne was crying now, her soft sobs twisting into raw, panicked wails that echoed through the trees, cutting through a silence far too deep. No birds. No chirping insects. No rustling leaves. Just the slap of feet on dirt, the snapping of twigs, and our frantic breaths, ragged and rising. The silence felt alive, like the forest itself was holding its breath. Panic blurred everything. Trails vanished. Familiar trees became strangers.

Light dimmed with every step, as if the woods were closing in on us, swallowing the day whole. Then a sudden jolt of pain. My foot caught on a thick, gnarled root, and I hit the ground hard, the air knocked from my lungs, skin tearing as my arm scraped across rock and dirt. Father skidded to a stop. For a split second, he let go of Joanne, her small form still running forward, unaware. He grabbed me, hauling me up with trembling hands, but then his eyes widened, and I saw it: that flicker of horror blooming in his face. “Joanne,” he breathed. Then louder, broken: “Baby, wait!” Through the thickening trees, I could still see her, a tiny silhouette bobbing deeper into the dark, where the forest turned dense and the light simply stopped.

We ran, limbs screaming, hearts pounding, every breath a knife to the chest. My injured arm throbbed, but adrenaline roared louder. Branches whipped our faces, clawing at us as we chased her deeper into the suffocating darkness.

That’s when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it. Even in the deepening dark, the pale color of flesh stood out against the dense green of the woods. A figure, barely visible, half-hidden in blur, but unmistakably human. And they were moving in the same direction we were, in a quickening pace. I forced myself to keep running, lungs aching, the pain in my arm worsening, the sound of my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I told myself I was imagining things. Just panic and exhaustion. Just hallucinations induced by the dying light. Between my own ragged gasps, I caught the rhythm of another breath, this one much harsher, deeper. Guttural. It didn’t sound human. Each inhale and exhale scraped the air like a growl, slow, wet, and feral. I turned my head, expecting a large animal.  But what I saw running beside me was a man, naked, pale, sprinting on all fours with unnatural speed and movement, his limbs bending too far, too wrong. Not running. Chasing.

There was a glint in its eyes. Not just hunger, but craving. . I wanted to scream, to call for my father, but the sound caught in my throat. Even if I had managed to yell, I knew he wouldn’t hear me,he was too far ahead, too lost in his own panic. His pace had changed. “Joanne!” he kept shouting, voice cracking under the weight of fear. “Joanne!” From my side, the rhythm of limbs on the forest floor grew faster—flesh slapping against earth in a sickening cadence. Hands and feet, pounding in a blur. That’s when I realized it. It was gaining on them. Whatever this thing was, it was moving with an impossible speed, and it wasn’t after me. It was after her.

We ran. Branches clawed at our clothes, the ground beneath us uneven and cruel. Joanne didn’t stop until we crashed into another clearing, panting and raw. Then Father froze. Towering before us was the cliff. “This must be the foot of the mountain,” I thought, but the words felt hollow, distant, meaningless. Joanne, poor sweet Joanne, had led us here away from the trail, away from the familiar farmlands, away from home.

She stood there, small and trembling, her chest heaving with each breath. Confused, exhausted, and terrified. “Joanne! Baby, hold on, we’re coming!” Father shouted, desperation cracking his voice. He surged forward, his slippers tearing through the grass. Only a few meters. Just a few more steps and she would’ve been safe. But monsters don’t care about distance. The bushes near her rustled, not a whisper, but a violent thrashing. It didn’t run. It lunged. A predator pouncing at its prey. A blur of limbs and bone, the creature slammed into her like a shadow given weight. Its hand snaked around her neck, cracked fingernails digging in with surgical cruelty. Her young flesh gave way like wet paper. Blood oozing from the gashes, velvet veins crawling down her torso.

Father stopped, horror anchoring him in his pace. The thing's eyes Stygian and reflective like oil, locked onto his. It snarled, bearing its grotesque teeth. And then Joanne screamed. Not a cry. Not a wail. It was a sound no child should make. Piercing, primal, as if her soul was being torn free from her throat. Father charged, machete raised high,  trembling hands white-knuckled on the handle. But the creature didn’t wait. With a single, grotesque motion, it lifted Joanne off the ground, her legs kicking helplessly, and began impossibly climbing up the steep cliff.  Its limbs moved too fast. Not like a person. Not even like an animal. Like something that had watched things crawl and decided it could do it better. Joanne was still screaming. And Father, he kept running. Swinging at the air, false threats of desperation.

As the creature reached the summit, Joanne’s screams faltered. Her voice softening into broken whimpers, then slipping into silence. Her tiny frame hung limp in its grasp, limbs dangling like a string-less marionette. The thing turned. Slowly. It stood there at the cliff’s edge, silhouetted by the pale light of the moon, its grotesque form barely human, its spine arched unnaturally, limbs too long, too thin. And its eyes, those soulless pits, burned down at us, filled with something cruel and hungry. Then it bared its teeth in a dreadful triumph. The fangs caught the moonlight, gleaming like knives, as if daring us to follow. It had her.

Father didn’t think. He just ran. Hands to stone, fingers clawing at the jagged cliff-side, he began to climb with wild, trembling urgency. Blood smeared the rocks as sharp edges tore into his palms, but he didn’t stop. He couldn’t stop.  “Joanne!” he screamed, over and over, her name bursting from his throat in raw, broken howls. Each cry sounded less human, more like a wounded animal, grief and terror stripped bare. Above him, the creature was already vanishing into the trees, its limbs twitching and snapping with unnatural speed, Joanne’s limp body dragging behind. Her head rolled with each step.  The hunt was over.  And still, Father climbed. He slipped. The cliff tore at him, pulling skin from bone, and he crashed back to the ground with a sickening thud, but before the pain could even settle in, he scrambled forward again, bloodied hands reaching for the rock like a drowning man gasping for air. Adrenaline fueling his battered and bloodied limbs.

He climbed.

He fell.

Again.

And again.

And again.

Each time, the stone took more from him, skin, blood, breath, energy. His knees buckled, his elbows split open, his hands became raw meat. But he kept going, because the alternative meant accepting what he couldn’t. He tried to scream again, but caught in his throat, strangled by sobs and dirt and dust. The cliff blurred in front of him. But he kept clawing. Because somewhere in the dark, his daughter was being taken. And he had nothing left but the climb.

I don't remember how long he stayed there. Maybe minutes. Maybe hours. He just lay at the base of that cliff, hands bloodied to the bone, body trembling, whispering her name like it might call her back. But the only answer was wind through the trees. The unforgiving and uncaring silence returned, as if nothing had happened. Father looked like the last thread holding him together was about to finally snap.  

When I finally stepped closer, I saw he was holding something in his hand. Joanne’s slipper. Small, crumpled, stained a deep, horrible red. He stared at it like it was all he had left to anchor him to the world. He didn’t speak. Just stared at his mangled hands. Like his body hadn’t realized yet that she was gone. Like it still thought it could hold on. That’s when he looked up at me, his eyes doused with liquid grief. “Oh, son. Our Joanne, she-” I didn’t know what to do at that moment, but I gave him a tight embrace. An embrace of fear and sadness.

That was when it hit me. The fear, the grief, the understanding that she wasn’t coming back, and I broke. The tears came fast and messy, hot against my dirt-streaked cheeks. I sobbed without shame, my chest convulsing as I tried to breathe through the terror, through the guilt. I cried for my sister. For my father. For myself.

We didn’t go home that night. We wandered, our bodies and minds were lost, hollow. The forest felt different after that. It watched us. It listened. The trees seemed closer. The shadows heavier. The skies more oppressive.

When we finally stumbled back into the village, the sun was rising, casting a pale, golden light over the fields. Pilar looked almost unreal in the morning calm. Dew clung to the leaves like pearls. Chickens clucked lazily through the grass. The distant sound of a water pump creaked in rhythm. Smoke drifted peacefully from early cooking fires. It was the kind of morning that made you believe the world was kind. The elders were already waiting at the edge of the square. They didn’t ask questions. They didn’t need to. Father still had the slipper in his hand. And they knew.

Mother rushed out the front door the moment she saw us, her face lit up with frantic hope, eyes scanning for Joanne. Her lips began to form her name. Then Father held up the slipper. Blood-soaked, dirt-caked, pitifully small in his hand. Mother froze. For a heartbeat, everything was still, just birdsong, rustling leaves, and the warm hum of a village waking up from its slumber. Then the scream came. It tore from her like something being ripped from deep inside.

The sound that didn’t belong in such a peaceful morning. A banshee’s howl echoing across the quiet farmland. Her knees buckled as she clawed at the dirt, her cries shattering the silence with wave after wave of agony. She screamed Joanne’s name until it didn’t sound like a name anymore, just a broken, unintelligible, empty plea. The neighbors peered through curtains. Doors closed. The chickens scattered. The stares piercing the back of our heads.  And still, she screamed. The kind of scream that makes the earth feel too small to hold it. The kind of scream that etches itself in the crevices of your brain, forever stuck.  That was the last time I saw my mother as I remembered her. After that day, something in her went silent. She still spoke, still cooked, still moved about the house but her spirit had quieted, broken down into the bare essentials, her soul left catatonic.

My father never spoke of the creature again. He never even said Joanne’s name. But I heard him some nights. Whispering. Praying. Sometimes begging. He would talk in his sleep, intelligible mumbles of dread and suffering. I never went near the edge of the forest again. Not for years. Not even when I was older, stronger, or foolish enough. Because Pilar has never forgotten what happened. You see, what happened to Joanne, is just one story. One of many I could tell you. There are others. This place, this beautiful, cursed place—it remembers everything. And if you stay long enough, like I did, so will you.
