For the last couple years, I’ve been working at a cemetery out near the edge of town. It’s decently large as I think we cater to the majority of the postal code. Now, it’s not a job that I would have been eager to get, not because I am afraid or really think much of it, it’s just the optics for other people. For me I don’t really see what we do being much different from what a long term storage facility does. We too put boxes filled with inanimate objects into holes then bury them forever. In fact I’d argue that 4’ x 8’ full of gran’s lifelong accumulation of belongings carries more of her soul than the nicest mahogany casket that we drop into the earth. But regardless, it did turn out to be a fine job, and honestly it was quite boring until the day I met her. 

Two months ago, we had just concluded a service for a young woman. It went fine, as far as I can recall, I remember that there was a small mention about how the girl’s sister hadn’t made it, and there was some sort of familial dispute over what they wanted to do with the body I guess: burial versus cremation. Both these things gave me something to ponder while I waited. I should clarify that my responsibilities were a bit of a catch-all. I would keep an eye on the cemetery- I hesitate to say “guard”, really I would just walk around and dissuade any precocious teens from trying to tag a headstone. 

The more exciting part was for burials. I would operate the excavator and dig the graves and after the service, once the casket was lowered in, I’d fill them back up again. So during the service itself, I just listened to the families and friends give their last parting words and then I’d wait until everyone left to go retrieve the excavator from the shed. 

After the last mourner had walked away dabbing their tears with a tissue, I went to the shed. Because we don’t want to tear up the grass with the excavator’s treads I have to lay down a trail of plywood sheets leading from the dirt path over the grass to the open grave. It was when I had placed about half the sheets that I looked up and saw, next to the grave, a black umbrella facing me. Someone was holding it but it was so low to the ground they must have been sitting and it was positioned in a way that I couldn’t see even an inch of them. 

I judged that someone from the service must have decided to return to say some last words before their dearly departed was lowered into the ground. I decided the most polite, if not fairly inconvenient, thing for me to do was to wait and give them a little time. So I stood and hung my head in sort of faux reverence. While my head was low and I was idly waiting there, I heard music. It was soft but there was a definite melody in the air. There was a delicate singing with a drumming thump beneath it. It was beautiful and strange. And if you’ll allow me, I would say ‘haunting’. But all the same I have to admit I didn’t like it. I couldn’t place it but it felt discordant in a way that was unpleasant to me, it made my skin tingle and it felt difficult to stand still.

I decided to break my silence and clear my throat. The music stopped immediately but the person didn’t face me or even acknowledge me. It wasn’t just that the song was unpleasant, I also needed to get this grave filled because it was a late service and we were pushing into the evening. The sun was already casting a soft reddish haze over everything and before long would be tucking behind the horizon. It was preferable that I not have to operate the excavator in the dark, so I needed this person to finish up their goodbye. I gave them a moment longer to let them have the opportunity to begin the interaction on their own terms, but as that moment, then a few more, went by I thought it would be up to me to initiate. 

I orbited around the umbrella giving them a wide enough berth so as to allow them some space as they were dealing with their emotions. I was picturing that they were probably frantically trying to wipe tears from their eyes, but as I came around I was surprised to see they were smiling.

*She* was smiling. Crouching there, swathed in the deep shadow of the umbrella was a young woman. I’d bet she was somewhere in her twenties, but it was fairly hard to tell from the obscurity the shadow around her was contributing and the heavy stylized makeup she was wearing. 

She had a coat of white face makeup with black lipstick and black eyeliner, as is the fashion with many goth people, and I am confident in saying that’s what she was. I will say here that I am not a stranger to goth and alternative cultures, as while my job does tend to hinder me greatly in meeting and dating girls of the mainstream population it has proved to be a bit of a boon with women in those communities. 

And besides most of her makeup, her hair was also black, as was her- actually it would be easier to say- nearly everything she had on her was black. She had a black band t-shirt which had one of the few pops of color in the red font of the band’s name. It was in one of those metal or hardcore style fonts that are nearly impossible to read though. Beyond that she was wearing an assortment of layers and accessories. 

Now most interesting were her boots. They were in the style of popular goth boots. Specifically; I believe they were “demonias”, or at least something similar, but what was remarkable was that hers were pink, instead of black, and they were spotless. And thanks to their several inches of platform, even crouched she was suspended above the ground. 

I will say I did not expect to see someone like her there, especially not smiling at me, and was suddenly at a loss for words. So she broke the silence, and said “Hi”. I squeaked a weak “hi” back. Using that momentum I pushed through to saying that I was coming with the excavator to fill the grave, and would unfortunately need her to leave so I could safely operate the machine. She maintained unblinking eye-contact, and I sort of fell apart at the end and conceded that she could stay there until I finished laying the boards down and it would take a few more minutes to go back to the shed and then return. Her smile flexed wider and she thanked me. I nodded, having given up on trying to maintain any air of authority, I turned and left. 

After laying the last few pieces of plywood down I turned and walked to the shed and looked back and saw her umbrella’ed shape still there. Thinking to myself I realized that she must of course be the sister that hadn’t made it. I realized too, that would give me the perfect opening to try to talk to her again when I returned. Though it did feel maybe wrong to hope to socialize with her at her sister’s grave if that was in fact the case. In the end, I decided that it would be okay to ask if she was the sister and to just keep things neutral and that maybe she would appreciate the opportunity to talk about it. 

It actually didn’t matter what I thought because by the time I had pulled the excavator out of the shed, only a minute or two later since I’d seen her, she was gone. A quick scan across the whole graveyard and I didn’t see her anywhere. Honestly, I was just impressed she could make that distance in those shoes. But then again, I’ve met some girls who dressed like her who could probably run an obstacle course halfway to black-out drunk in boots like hers. All the same it was good because the sun was setting quickly. 

I got the grave buried and boards put away before late. And as I was locking up I sighed to myself that I would never really know why she was there. I was wrong. 

In fact it was the very next day that I saw her next. Close to the same time, but it was still about an hour until I would be closing up. Weirdly I only noticed her when she had already made it to the grave, this time it was filled with packed dirt and a couple rolls of fresh sod. I was making my rounds when I saw her on the way back- “my rounds”  is really just a glorified way of saying I was taking a walk. 

When I recognized that it must be her again I decided that last night’s strategy for talking to her was still sound. So as I finished “my rounds” and walked back up the dirt path I cut into the interior toward her.

Immediately, I stopped in my tracks. I could hear that singing again. And I think it was this moment I realized she was the one singing and that it wasn’t coming from a speaker. Though it just had this melodic fullness to it that felt like it was an edited and arranged piece of music but I know that a capella artists and powerful singers can do incredible things and she may very well be in either of those groups. 

Again though it shot a tingling feeling through my skin and as I decided to begin walking toward her again I realized I was having a bit of trouble balancing. Not unlike if you’ve ever stood up too quickly and you feel dizzy and like for a moment you don’t really know intrinsically which direction is up. 

My vision and other senses worked basically fine so I was able to take a couple steps forward without tripping on myself, but in the moment I had a funny thought. It made me think of how in movies with astronauts when they’re trying to dock the ships or maneuver a robotic arm to grab something they have to use impersonal controls and the limited vision of their little computer screens to guide themselves. It felt a lot like that. 

Then suddenly, my sense of balance returned. I lifted my eyes back from the ground and I saw with a start, that I was standing only a few feet away from her. Somehow I had crossed a much farther distance in that daze than I’d realized. She was looking back at me, not smiling this time, but with a more neutral expression. 

This was not how I anticipated this going, and I feared how awkwardly I may have lumbered my way up here. Quickly, I tried to move on from that by mentioning how she was here again. And then asking if she was perhaps the deceased’s sister. After a quiet moment she said yes. Then she said her name was “Bel”. 

I said “Like the beauty and the beast?” 

She laughed then said, “Almost, but it’s spelled B-E-L.” 

I nodded. Then trying to judge whether it was time for my exit or not I decided to ask her about what she was singing. Specifically if it was like a modern song or like a hymn or something. She said no, neither, it was a very old kind of song. It was a “cemetery song”. I debated whether that name was more of a description and would just be stupid to ask what a cemetery song was but it was how she said it that made it feel like there was more there. 

So I asked her what was a cemetery song, and prepared myself for condescending eyes and “it's a song you sing in the cemetery \[you dumbass\]” but instead she smiled and said it was a specific type of song that you sing for the dead. 

I said “Oh like at a funeral”

She laughed and then said very carefully, “No, no, no. They’re not for the dead like that, they’re *for* the dead. It’s for them to hear” 

A shiver ran down my back. Now I’ve certainly heard some ideas and beliefs many times wilder than that said by other goth and alternative people, but it was something about how calmly and matter-of-factly she said it that unsettled me. 

I didn’t know what else to say so the conversation stalled there. And I could tell she was getting ready to sing and I didn't want to be caught in that again so I started to move on. 

I made it decently far before she started singing again. 

It was such a strange song and now as I try to think of what it sounded like or what she sang or anything specific I’m floundering to think of anything. In the moment I remember thinking how particular and strange it was. I could even recognize, maybe not English, but definite chunks of words of some language, but now it feels like waking up from a dream where I suddenly can’t remember a single specific thing about it. 

\-speaking of a “dream”- 

It started the first night after the burial. I had a dream that I couldn’t remember so well. Only that I felt hot and like I was suffocating and then I jumped up in my bed covered in sweat and gasping for air. 

The next night, it was much worse, and I remember it far more vividly. It was dark, but not like night time dark, it was an unfriendly, cruel, choking dark. I remember trying to reach out and find something in the blackness. I immediately did. In fact I quickly realized there was a wall all around me, well within reach. A new wave of terror came over me as my claustrophobia kicked in. 

Even as my heart was racing and I was panicking so hard my dream was losing focus and falling into a bit of a distorted mess, as I believe my brain was losing its image processing abilities amidst the panic and biological changes my fear was causing, I still didn’t wake up. I mean dreams do tend to feel so much longer than they actually are but I swear this one just kept going and going until finally I shot up in bed. 

As soon as I could, I got out of bed to change my shirt to a dry one and I realized I had pissed myself. I think I may have been eight years old the last time that happened. 

I took a shower then drank tea until the sun rose.

The next day was an easy day, fortunately. I just needed to fix a fence post that had gotten a bit wobbly and go on “my rounds” from time to time and that would be all she wrote. 

After returning from one such walk I sat against a tree and struggled to keep my eyes open. I’ve never slept in a cemetery before but at this particular moment it seemed like an inevitability. My eyes repeatedly flirted with closing all the way when on one particularly concerted effort to open them again I saw a little fuzzy spot in my vision that wasn’t there before.  

The feeling of curiosity woke my mind back up enough that I could focus my vision and I saw it was a familiar black umbrella-toting individual. Unease grew in my stomach and chest, which was unnecessary because I had already decided I wasn’t going to get close enough to hear her sing if she had come back again today. I was far away from her sister’s grave this time and well outside earshot. But despite that my body didn't seem interested in falling asleep anymore. I remained exhausted but nonetheless alert and awake. 

She kept returning every day at about an hour before I closed up for the night. While I made sure to stay far enough that I couldn’t hear her, I'm confident she was always singing because of the way I could see her mouth moving even from a distance. 

After about a week since we had laid her sister to rest we got a strange directive from the family. Something had happened and the bottom line was that we would have to dig up the grave and the body was to be exhumed and sent for cremation. I don’t think I have to explain that this is an extraordinarily unusual request. I asked the couple who owned the cemetery if this had ever happened before and they said no. And in fact we didn’t even have the proper equipment to retrieve a casket. A small crane had to be brought in so that we could lift the casket out of the now reopened grave.

It was when we opened the casket that things got even stranger. When the lid was unlocked and lifted up, I thought for a moment that thick clusters of mold had been released as soft white bits fell out and danced across the grass. One piece came to rest near my foot. I bent down to look and realized it was a little bit of cotton filling, like for a pillow. I had a hot uneasy feeling climb through my stomach.

It was the gasps that told me I was right. 

Looking up I saw the underside of the lid. The soft velvet covered padding was shredded, its filling had diffused into the rest of the coffin, and now onto the grass around it. Underneath where the padding had been, the wood bore long deep scratches- hundreds of them. 

What remained of the velvet hung in strips and was speckled with red. The nails on the girl’s fingers were broken, every one, and seemingly in their place, each finger tip was bristling with splinters.

I looked past her hands toward her face. Apparently someone behind me did the same, as I heard them vomit. I will not describe it here. The last thing I am willing to share was told to me later on. Which was that, curiously, blood soaked pieces of cotton filling were packed so tightly into her ears that they were spilling out.

I haven't seen Bel since. Nor have I ever found anything like what she sang again, except occasionally, when I'm sleeping very deeply, I'll find myself in a nightmare where I'm wrapped in suffocating darkness and far far away a voice gently sings.
