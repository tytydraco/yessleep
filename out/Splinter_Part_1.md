“Happy birthday Sweetheart,” Ms. Tonya waved as I stepped out of her class with a feeling of lingering anxiety in my chest and a slow creep of excitement. All 5 of us had been planning this hangout since the start of senior year. My father was the manager of a reasonably popular haunted house attraction for our area and he also just so happened to be long time friends with the owner. So ever since eighth grade and when me and Gavin started working there three years ago it became our tradition to come out and rent a nearby cabin for two nights and mess around in the haunted house until late at night. It started at first as just me, Gavin and Lynn but over the years it transformed into me, Gavin, Lynn, Ethan, and Rob.

My name is Blake. I’m a terribly average guy compared to the others. I like writing, movies, and books, specifically horror and that's all there is to me, besides a diagnosis of social anxiety and depression. I used to wear a leather jacket like Negan from “The Walking Dead” thinking it made me look cool but in reality I seemed like a dork I’m sure. I’m not tall but I’m not short either, I’m not humorless but I’m not a class clown like Ethan, I’m not fat but I’m not skinny. The only thing that sticks out is my long wavy hair. That’s why I’ll say I’m terribly average.

Gavin was my best friend out of the group. Same average height as me with curly brown locks of hair draping down his back, he just clicked with me on every little nerdy thing we found. Just as awkward as me, he stumbled over his words a lot but still managed to crack me up every time he said a joke.

Ethan was a self proclaimed goofball. He was constantly throwing out a joke, good or bad, to anyone who would listen. 6 ’1, chubby but strong, constantly wearing basketball shorts, even in winter, and hoodies over his short, blonde hair, he could make any get together into a hysterical room of laughter or the biggest argument between 5 people you have ever seen. Not only did he like to joke but he liked to argue and most of the time start those very arguments, but he never meant any harm and we never actually got mad.

Then there was Lynn. Constantly draped in black attire she was the chillest out of our group, she was the type to constantly have an earphone in and would just tune in to the rest of our conversations to listen. On the chance that we brought up anything she adored though it was like a spark on gasoline, she could go on for hours and hours but I never protested. 

I walked down the school's winding hallways with fellow bus riders surrounding me on all sides. The gossip of white trash rednecks and painfully bland and dumb blonde girls swirled around me like a tornado. God did I hate school and the people there. I just stuck to my friend group all the time and ignored the drama even when I was in the eye of the storm. I just kept my head down and walked faster wanting to get the school day over and the festivities started. I finally raised my head to see the beautiful glass doors leading out and my excitement rose. I pushed the door open, holding it for a second for the guy behind me and feeling the rays from the grey sky shine on me. I looked to see Gavin, Lynn, and Ethan all in a circle in front of the bus talking. Suddenly I felt the mass of uneasiness cocoon and sprout into weird awkwardness even though we’ve spoken every day for six years. I had classes with Gav and Ethan but none with Lynn this year sadly, so we didn’t see each other much which prompted her to turn and say what she said next.

“Happy birthday dumbass!” she said with a cool attitude then chuckled and smiled.

At that moment the anxiety and awkwardness folded into itself and back into its cocoon as I smiled back.

“Haha shit for brains,” bursted out of my mouth before I could think. She hugged me laughing.

Gavin chuckled as well, moving closer. “Dude thank god they switched when report cards were coming out otherwise I would’ve been under house arrest.”

“What the hell man, failing grades is Blake's trademark not yours!” Ethan belted out.

“Oh fuck you tubby!” I laughed along.

He bumped my arm with his elbow playfully but hard enough for it to hurt which was right on brand for Ethan. We walked onto the bus, the unfamiliar red seats intriguing me as Lynn and I slid into a seat opposite to the other two. I had never ridden the bus to Rob’s before, usually he drove us there, but today we were. We would meet him there, meet up with Kirsten, drive to the haunt, mess around and then stay at the cabin once one am struck, at least that had been our ritual these past years minus Kirsten joining us.

Ethan leaned over as we passed through the tidy suburban streets. “Dude, so when are we gonna plan that DND campaign?” Truth be told I had forgotten about it entirely. As I thought about my response I felt the cushion behind me rise up.

“What the hell bro, planning a Dungeons and Dragons campaign without me?!” I knew then the first spark of the day had flown as I felt her hovering over my shoulder. Gavin awkwardly opened his phone to scroll as I enjoyed the banter. They spoke the entire twenty minutes about ideas of a campaign and even their made up characters. I butted in with a couple ideas but I didn’t know much about Dungeons and Dragons or Warhammer or any of the board games they swore they would play one day. By the time Ethan had flown the conversation through hoop after hoop of topics we arrived just in time to avoid a tirade about how Fallout is the best videogame franchise ever. We strolled up to Rob’s door feeling like Reservoir Dogs and knocked candidly.

He opened the door with a clumsy smile. “Howdy doody!”

His pleasantry fell so flat we bursted out in laughter.

“What’d I do…” he mumbled uncertainly, adding to the laughter.

We just waved our hands aside and walked in.

Rob was kind of awkward but a really kind and fun guy to be around. About 6 '2 and skinny with constantly messy hair, he always spoke in a monotone voice as if high constantly yet completely sober. His nerdy interests were even more niche than our weird ones but they were interesting and damn was our music taste identical. We spent hours on end freshman year listening to Arctic Monkeys and Black Sabbath in gym class.

As we walked in Ethan continued talking about Fallout and other rpg’s to Rob while me Gavin and Lynn talked over characters and character arcs in horror games and media. I waltzed into Rob's kitchen to make coffee for myself and Ethan as the minutes went by and he kept talking. The coffee brewed in the machine and dripped into the pot, I felt my chest tighten out of nowhere as my thoughts drifted into the recesses of my mind, places I didn't want to focus on. I closed my eyes and thought of fun times with the group but I think it made it worse. I filled the mugs then poured the milk and stirred the sugar in as I felt a tap on my shoulder.

“Whatcha doin?” Lynn questioned with a soft smile.

I snapped out of it, “O-oh just making coffee.”

“Let me have it.” I handed her my mug as she moved closer expecting her to drink but she just inhaled the steam. “Hmmmmm.”

“What are y-”

“I hate the taste of coffee, I just love the smell,” she said exhaling and handing the cup back to me. I took it back with shaky hands as she treaded over to the pantry. “Down to raid Rob's pantry?” I smiled and sat the mugs down with a clink.

About 3 minutes later Rob finally walked in to see us giggling like school girls while holding two donuts in each hand. “My donuts…” he whined like a wounded puppy.

In the moment of snickering that followed the door knocked almost so quietly that no one heard it.

“H-h-hello…” a timid girl's voice came through the door. 

“Oh Kirsten’s here.” Rob said in his constant monotone voice. He opened the door and there she was.

Kirsten was a petite girl, she seemed like the wind could blow her off her feet and through the air. She rubbed her barely visible hands together in the oversized hoodie she was wearing. Ethan and Gavin's argument in the background over which movie to watch that night seemed to make her jump like a cat just from the volume. I immediately recognized her, we had classes together back when I used to be just as uptight as she was now. I sympathized with her. I also knew by the ruby redness in her face and her gorgeous blue eyes staring at his feet that she liked Rob and Rob liked her. Those beautiful blue eyes could capture any man's heart in an instant I swear. I chuckled and wiped my glaze covered fingers with a napkin and sipped my coffee as Rob made introductions since she was joining the group for the first time. 

“Hi…” she murmured bashfully.

We all said our separate hellos and Ethan immediately started talking music with her. I’m glad, I think it loosened her up as her stiff figure relaxed. Although any time Rob got close she became a wooden board again.

After the shared greetings we packed our small backpacks with snacks and changes of clothes and piled into Rob’s massive jeep.

“Yo thanks again for being the communal driver,” I spoke to Rob from the back of the car.

“No prob man!” He said back a little louder than intended as we pulled out of his driveway and headed to the haunt.

The drive was about thirty minutes there. When Ethan leaped for the bluetooth connect button Kirsten jumped again for the hundredth time and Lynn chuckled. She jumped even more when he started his heavy metal playlist. Lynn and Kirsten tried talking to me but we couldn’t hear because of the dumbass with radio privileges. Those privileges were snatched and given to me after accidently hitting play in the Little Caesars drive-thru. Rob and Gavin finally seemed at peace in the car listening to British pop-rock with me like it was that freshman gym class again.

We drove up and down winding roads, past lodges and lakes, and over a rickety rust bucket of a bridge. Along the way Ethan cranked down the radio with a swift hand movement. “Has Kirsten heard the story?”

“What story…?” she asked innocently as we turned a corner, the trees blocking out most of the ash grey sky.

Me, Gavin and Lynn collectively groaned. “The stupid ass story of the haunt…” We said simultaneously.

“I-I still don’t get it,” Kirsten mumbled.

Ethan turned in his seat to face us gripping the back of the seat intently with a sly smile. “Okay, in the 1800’s there was a mansion on the property where the haunted house is today. The family that lived there was the rich dad, his wife, daughter, and a collection of maids he had amassed over the years. The maids started showing up missing with no evidence as to where they had vanished in the mansion that once stood. One by one the townsfolk noticed the dwindling number of servants. Rumors began of the man being a satanic cultist who was sacrificing the women to the devil. The head priest in town, an influential and charismatic man, led with the rumors and claimed that the rich man was committing unspeakable acts of pure refined evil and needed to be stopped. The town formed a mob and when they stormed the mansion they found the man in the cellar skinning the dismembered corpses of his wife and young daughter. The town stood in shock too scared to even lynch the man. He took his blade and slit his own throat, vowing alliance with Satan as he gushed blood onto his skinless kin. Those in the area believe he was trying to ascend to a higher form of being, a demon, and that his ritual to the devil finally worked when he sacrificed his family. Even today you can hear the abomination he has become in the depths of hell screaming and cackling in joy.”

Kirsten looked colorless like she had just watched a puppy die.

“If only any of that bullshit was real,” Lynn retorted with fiery sass. “Gavin and I have checked the libraries and even online and there is no evidence to show there was ever a rich devil man or some spooky mansion where maids were led to slaughter. It. Is. Bullshit.”

“God you're no fun!” Ethan pouted loudly.

Rob chuckled and made the last turn onto a long stretch of road, the grey beams of light engulfing the car again. Five minutes later the road led us there to the parking lot to the left of the haunt,

The grass parking lot was about seventy feet from the cabins to the right but about two hundred feet to the left was the haunted house and that was our first destination.

Me and Gav carried the pizzas over to the haunt as the others trekked in front of us with blankets and bags leading the way, still arguing whether the story was true or not. Coming from the parking lot we walked into the left side of the metallic building then walked around to the front with wooden planks nailed to the metal sheets to give it an “Evil Dead” impression. In front of it though was a field that if you walked straight away from the house led to a creek running through the woodland town. We decided to sit and eat there to unwind in the frigid autumn breeze before playing hide and seek.

As I sat the few pizza boxes I had ferried over on the blanket Kirsten had sat down I looked up. The group was laughing at dumb inside jokes, taking a slice, or straightening out the blankets in Rob's case. It was a joyous scene even Kirsten joined in on with her own innocent childlike laughter and jokes.

It hurt. It hurt a lot. We all planned on having different careers. Doctors, lawyers, mechanics, and even the horror author I hoped to become. We all were splintering off into our own tales. The cocoon of anxiety sprouted again in my chest and the mass of anxiety fluttered its wings and summersalted into my stomach. I’m so scared of losing them, losing this. I clutched the hem of my shirt. “Why now? On my birthday? C'mon dude don't think about it.” That phrase my brain had conjured up repeated until I felt the warm soft crust of the pizza in my grasp. “It's gonna be okay… right?”

We all sat down to eat. Gavin and I made double-decor pizzas out of two slices and laughed when the others began chanting “fatasses” until we finished three double decors. We leaned backwards, my hand falling on the grass. Ethan kicked my foot teasingly as I made mock bloated groaning noises. Lynn sat criss cross apple sauce beside me showing me posters of my favorite bands asking which one I wanted to stop and get tomorrow.

“You don’t have to get me anything man.”

“Duh I do, it's your freakin birthday, you deserve it.” She retorted with a snort at how dumb I sounded in her mind. “Plus I want to.”

“Dude I know you want that Arctic Monkeys poster.” Gavin said cockily.

“See, even Gav knows.” she smirked winning this court case.

“Fiiiiiine.”

“So what was your favorite song again?” Gav questioned knowing it would start a rant. That had lit my own spark to talk about my favorite bands and the cocoon closed up again. I chuckled as we talked over songs and how important they were to us. Black Sabbath, Nirvana, System of a Down, all of them getting us through break-ups or rebellious phases, or even just one bad night. I got up to grab another slice when I noticed my hand had left a deep black handprint on the blanket.

“What the hell?”

I ran my hand across the blanket and the handprint became a black streak through the snowy cloth. I looked at my palm and saw there was a dark, ashy grey substance coating it. Ash? Gavin looked at the grass and saw that patches of the field were stained with streaks of the ash or whatever it was.

“Has someone lit a fire recently?” Ethan quizzed.

I thought for a mere moment before answering. “No, people don’t touch the place after the last night open for the year.” I pointed over to the fire pit used to keep employees warm on icy nights and the silver tin keeping the fire at bay. “If they did and had a brain they would use that.”

Lynn cocked her head to the side thinking as Kirsten itched beside her eye. What kind of fire could leave trails of ash like this? That question flowed through our heads.

Gavin chimed in. “Could wind have been strong enough to blow ash out of the fire pit?”

“The tin would’ve caught it,” Lynn said with a calculated stare.

Rob took his turn. “Maybe a burning animal?”

“I've not heard of any fires recently…” Kirsten spoke.

“That's the most likely theory though. Maybe lightning set it ablaze,” Ethan snickered at the wild possibility..

“Whatever lets just get to hide and seek,” I smacked my hands together to dust them off and took another slice to eat as we approached. “Actually Kirsten probably needs to be shown around…” I said. I instantly saw Rob's eyes glisten with the thought of “Holy shit the time is now!”

He stepped forward, “I’ll help her through.”

I had to hide my devilish smirk and bite my tongue before I blurted out “Wonder why?” at his cheesy attempt. Lynn chuckled under her breath and Kirsten smiled lightly knowing exactly what I was thinking.

I led the group in front of Rob and Kirsten into the entrance. The first room had five lines in it. The walls, ceiling, and floor were made of either wood, plaster, or in the case of the outer walls of the place metal sheets. All the rooms on the inside were plaster. All the actors' tunnels were wood. Everything was roughly painted black with a decade worth of chipped paint and wear and tear, for that matter the whole place did in a charming antique way. The entry room had 3 doors. A hidden one to the front left of the entrance to enter one half of the employees only halls. One directly in front of the entrance permanently opened because of a wedge under the door, that was the way into the haunt after your group waited in the five short lines. To the left of the entrance was another hidden door leading into the second side of the employees only halls.

The power was out so I pulled six small dinky flashlights from my bag and passed them out. Ethan twirled his between his fingers, Lynn put an earphone in, and Kirsten clutched hers like a lifeline before using her other hand to pinch Rob's sleeve between her pointer and thumb adorably.

I led us through the winding corridors with my light as the others lit up little trinkets and props lining desks and shelves. We went through a kitchen with shiny rubber guts and limbs strewn about, a bathroom with a toilet spray painted brown and the lingering smell of fart spray, church pews with mannequins draped in white sheets (that one in particular always freaked me out), a tunnel with football field turf mangled into fake vines growing up the sides, a jail cell room that had a door with a tempered glass window that was on the bigger side of the room. That door led to a security room. And a boiler room with paper flames and too many little powerless heaters to count.

About half way through I heard Kirstens already shaky breathing become that much more uneasy. Ethan and Rob looked at her with concerned eyes. “It’s a bit claustrophobic huh,” she murmured.

Rob pointed upwards. “Well all of these rooms don't have a like… wood roof, just tarp under a metal roof farther up so it isn’t that cramped in reality.” It eased her a bit but not much. I assume the death grip her pinched fingers had on his jacket helped though.

We wound around hall to hall sometimes taking wrong turns into secret doorways not meant for customers to go through. Finally at the exit we took a turn through a hidden compartment to the employees only hallway. Walking through we saw make up rooms filled with masks and chairs, hidden compartments for actors to pop out at you from, and the two security rooms with cameras set up around the haunt. One of those security rooms on each side of the haunt. You see, the employees only hallways were split into two by the entrance room so each side had its own security room. The hallways made an L shape that were split in the middle by that room. It was a pain to go from one hall to the other when the place was open but it worked. We went through the same path another time to make sure that Kirsten memorized some of the layout, by that point the sun was setting and excitement was climbing.

We all gathered in the entrance room and decided on the seeker as darkness set on the field outside. Rules and parameters were set and where we could go was stated and then the game commenced. Ethan sat counting as Rob and Kirsten ran off together and Gavin, Lynn, and I parted ways. We ran through hidden spaces winding around the main path and long, chilling corridors. I found a rusty barrel to slip into in the boiler room as footsteps pitter pattered all around me. I could hear Lynn locking in and running to my right and Rob and Kirsten's combined giggles to my left. We were all together.

Games went by in flashes. Hiding in lockers, running through the halls with Gavin as Rob sprinted after us, hiding in an old cramped fridge that stained my pant leg, as many creative hiding spots as I could find. After five games like that we all circled again in the entrance. 

Kirsten started counting and Lynn grabbed my wrist, “c-mon!” She hauled me through the halls, nearly bumping me into every object jutting out in the whole place as we went. She dragged me to the eerie chapel room and we both curled into the little space in the altar laughing. We sat staring at the floor while Kirsten seeked. I would steal glances at her and I think she would at me in that little confined space. Our breathing seemed like airhorns in silence. My fingers gripped my own sleeve out of dread and nervousness.

Lynn was moving to go to college out of state after this year. I was dreading it, especially since this year we had no classes together. Another reason for the anxious thought of my friends leaving me forever to fly around in my stomach flapping its wings. I can’t stand that damn thought. Our tightly woven collective being stretched in different directions and unwound until we are all apart. My chest would tighten every time it crossed my mind. Lynn noticed I think. Her hand outstretched and her fingers grasped my wrist. Her thumb ran back and forth on me soothingly and I heard her breathing soften before mine followed soot. I felt warm in that moment, like time had stopped for us. We heard footsteps and Kirsten's shaky light lit up the spaces around us. Her hand pulled away from mine gently as she put her finger to her lips.

When I heard the footsteps come closer I burst out of the alter throwing my hands up and yelling like a mad man. I swear she looked like a cat the way she jumped out of her skin. I laughed my ass off as Lynn and I stumbled back to the entrance nearly in tears at her fearful reaction. Next found was Gavin who waltzed into the room laughing just like us.

“Dude I just scared the shit out of Kirsten!” He said with a pep in his step.

“Is everyone gonna scare her?” I laughed along with him.

He sat to the left of me as Lynn listened to music through my headphones since hers had died. “So have you had a good birthday so far man?” He said with a polite and earnest smile.

“Yeah I’ve loved it so far dude. You guys make every year great.” He gave a nice grin.

“Good.”

We sat in comfortable silence for a while. That comfort, that presence he has, that's why he's my brother in my eyes. No matter if it’s just chatting about nerdy stuff or having serious deep conversation he’s always there. He was there for me through the worst parts of my life to hold me up and vice versa. 

“So whatcha getting with your birthday money?” He asked.

“Probably some games. Got any ideas for multiplayer games?”

“Oh yeah Rob brought up the idea of like… god I can’t remember the name of it but it’s like a multiplayer game set in the woods and you connect your mics and you can’t talk or the thing will find you,” Gavin seemed hyped up as he described it.

“Oh shit you’re talking about Don’t Breathe!” I lit up in recognition. “Yeah fuck dude I’ll get it tonight and we can play it after this cabin trip.”

“Shweeeet!” He laughed.

We chuckled together remembering old memories of various games with various people.

“So how’re things with Becca?” I asked, giving him an equally earnest smile.

“Things are going great man… she's like the perfect girl for me, yah know?”

“See I told you while we were working at the haunt this year that breaking out of your shell would be worth it.”

“Yeah I guess you were right.”

We both looked forward. “You ever get worried the friend group will split up after high school?” It came out of my mouth without a thought.

“Sometimes. Not really worried about you though just the rest, scared they'll split off. But I always get reassurance whenever we hang out that it’s not gonna happen.” His hands rubbed together to keep warm as the night progressed and the night got colder or maybe he was worried like me, maybe the reassurance wasn't enough.

“Yeah…” I muttered, reassured only slightly at his remark.

“Sup shit birds!” We jumped as Ethan screamed. He laughed at us all being scared besides Lynn who took my headset off her head confused at what had happened. Soon Rob had been found by Kirsten then we piled together for another game and my turn was up. I was the next seeker. 

The others all scattered and hid as I counted upwards. I could hear them rushing to find their spots as my time to count ticked by. “One, Two, Three.” I focused on them, the feeling of it all, the feeling of being with my friends or the feeling of being alone in that dark room. I can’t remember. “Forty four, Forty five, Forty six.” That bug in my chest sprouted once more. It dove to the pits of my stomach, dread poured down that same pit weighing me like chains over my shoulders. No reassurance was gonna be found at this moment, no safety. “One hundred, One hundred and one, one hundred and two.” I covered my eyes and touched my face in a desperate attempt to ground myself. It didn’t work. “One fifty eight, one fifty nine, one sixty…” Two minutes had passed and I took my forearm off my eyes. “Ready or not here I c-” I looked outside.

A lone figure stood in the field. It had a white sheet over it and two eye holes like a tacky Halloween costume in a low budget slasher film. Its shoulders were impossibly broad, too wide and tall to be normal, nearly at chin height. The sheet draped down to the figure's toes covering all of it. The sight was uncanny. I felt chills slither up my back and my panic level rise. I just stared at the shape in the field like it was otherworldly, no, it was otherworldly. Those small holes in the cloth were too tiny for a person to see. The shoulders weren't proportionate, and why have it pool at your feet to cover your entirety. That thing was off, it was off in every way.

Time seemed to slow as I backed up slowly. I shut the entrance to the haunt as I did, breaking the line of sight between the sheeted figure and I. The room submerged in inky darkness. I clicked my flashlight on to illuminate it. I walked into the passageways trembling. “Guys come out! Something's wrong! Guys!” My voice reverberated back to me like a faint cry for help. “Guys I’m serious there's someone outside! Guys…” My voice cracked like I was a little boy on the verge of tears. I clutched my light with both hands as I turned each corner expecting a man I had never seen before to be sprinting at me. “GUYS!” Only my voice filled the silence, nothing else.

I could hear the plastic handle tapping against my clammy palms as my beam of light quivered. I scurried through the kitchen searching for anyone then into the chapel. My heart froze and my veins filled with ice. Nine figures all draped in white sheets. “Fuck…”

I scanned them for inconsistencies. Everyone of them were a different kind underneath. One was bigger, another was tiny, and the other had almost cartoony proportions. There were less consistencies than inconsistencies and the one thing that was consistent were eye holes on every mannequin. At least none had weird shoulders I thought, hoping I could trick myself.

I swallowed and felt sweat build on my head in the forty degree weather. I could feel the stares of these ghosts burning through the sweat and into my core. My feet dragged as I padded through the crowd of them. My brain was screaming at me every time I looked into those terrible eyes, seeing nothing but black holes staring back at me. I scooted past the first mannequin, my whole body tight, my arms and thighs squeezed together. A crack broke through the silence, loud like snapping celery. I jumped and pointed my flashlight outwards like a gun as if it would protect me. I looked at the mannequins surrounding me and noticed it. The sheeted mannequin in front of me had a larger left shoulder than its right.

It lunged at me with ferocity and shrieked into my face, two hands wrapped around my left arm as I screamed in terror. The things shriek was like a wailing coyote and a baby's anguished cries for its mother at the same time. I leaped back knocking over the mannequin behind me but the thing's arm stretched in an otherworldly way. I heard its joints pop out of place and its dark burnt skin stretch and tear like leather. The ligaments and muscles pulled and snapped like stringy bits of beef jerky through the tears in its skin. The hands gripped tight enough to feel like my arm could be snapped. I watch one arm's elbow snap the opposite direction as if its bones were made of twigs. I reached back, prepared to throw a punch into its wrist. Its bones were weak like a rotting carcass and the wrist let out a god awful crunch as my knuckles slammed into it. It let out an infant's wail as I pulled from its doubled grip. As I scrambled to run I glanced at the two arms. Both had thumbs facing to its left. It had two right arms. I watched in utter shock and horror as more ghastly frail arms wrapped around the two and hid them back up its raised cloth. An ungodly smell of mold and shit filled the room. I nearly fell to vomit at a mere whiff of the scent but my fight or flight carried me back through hall after hall.

I banged into walls in my sprint slamming my knee and shoulders into countless objects. “HELP!” I screamed for the others, my voice completely broken with fear. My foot slammed into something and I fell to the ground. I rolled on my back and crawled backwards in my panic. I was back in the entrance room but the door was shut. I started to hear footsteps all around me shuffling and banging on the walls. I heard giggles swarm around me like bees and I felt those eyes burning holes into me again through the darkness. I curled up at the shut door, my whole being shaking like a leaf. “HELP ME!” Footsteps rushed through the darkness towards me at incredible speeds. “HELP!!”

Gavin grabbed my shoulders tight. “Dude what happened, are you okay!?” I looked up to see the five of them standing there nervous as to what happened.

“Dude this better not be a prank like we thought…” Rob said his hands gripping the hem of his jacket. 

Lynn looked at me with worried eyes, “Yeah, what happened?” she said, concerned. Ethan looked anxious to find out if I was okay, and Kirsten was shaken badly clinging to her shoulders bundling herself in her own arms.

“SOMETHINGS IN HERE!” I said with tears filling my eyes. Gavin looked down seeing dark ashy handprints on my jacket sleeve.

“Something?” Ethan mumbled.

THUD THUD THUD.

Three knocks came from the left employees only halls. Gavin raised me up in my disheveled state with a hand on my back and we slowly edged ourselves towards the hidden door. I moved forward putting my shuddering hand on the door frame and pulling it open. Something made a clang against the metal wall and we stared down the empty hallway. Silence overtook us. It seemed like no one even dared to breathe. Then the wood door to a scare actor's cubby creaked open slowly. Dirt and soot fell from hand prints on the door. Seven handprints.
