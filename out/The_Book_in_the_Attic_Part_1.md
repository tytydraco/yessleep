“Oh Michael, I just wanted to make sure you’re safe.” Mom’s voice came crackling through the phone as her overly anxious tone caused its old receiver to struggle. The landline in this place was always bad but ever since that freak storm came through two days ago, everything here has been getting even worse.

 “I’m fine, mom.” I say as I tried to calm her down again, “The water’s nowhere near the house, alright? Everything’s fine, you don’t have to call every few hours.” I tried to hide just how annoyed I was getting from her constant phone calls, but the sigh I heard from the other end of the line proved that I didn’t do such a good job at that.  
“Just let it go, Beth. Let him figure it all out himself for once!” I could just barely hear dad’s voice from the other end of the phone, he was probably creeping over mom’s shoulder or something.

 I’m honestly surprised that he even cared enough to eavesdrop on our conversation in the first place. But honestly, I really didn’t give a shit what he thought; he had been on my ass ever since he and mom helped me get this place from our realty firm. And besides, this was my first house straight out of college so he could just back off! 

“Michael? Michael, are you still there, honey?” I heard mom’s voice again, seemingly after waving dad off. “Yeah… Yeah, I’m still here. And you know what? I CAN figure this out myself, alright?” I said a little louder, hoping dad could hear it. The call went silent for a moment, before I heard her speak up again. “Ok, Mikey… ok.” Her words were spoken so quietly, they were almost impossible to hear. “I believe in you… We both do… But could we just come and check in on you in a few days; if it's possible by then… Please?” 

As I listened to her speak, I couldn’t help but feel a little guilty. That didn’t sound like her usual gaslighting tone… no…  Maybe she actually meant what she was saying that time.  
“Yeah… Sure, that’s fine, Mom.” I said reluctantly, “Until then… No more calls, alright?”  
“Oh, alright Mikey.” she answered back, “I promise… Cross my heart and hope to die!”  
With that, we both finally hung up, and I was again left alone with the aftermath of that week’s recent disaster.

I put up the phone and walked towards the living room to check outside again. I flung back the curtains just to be met with what I already knew. The streets were filled to the brim with murky water, and dark clouds continued to cast foreboding shadows throughout the neighborhood.  
“Son of a bitch!” I hissed through clenched teeth. The news had been talking on and on about how the city would have the streets cleared by Friday. But at that point, Friday was two days ago!  
‘What the hell is taking them so long?’ 

With an angry *swish* I closed the blinds back up, more willing to accept the depressing, grayish lighting it created than the sight of what was keeping me trapped in my own house. That, and I was sick of looking at the “sold” sign that I forgot to take down before the rain started. The last thing I needed was to be reminded of how the firm claimed yet another victim. 

I fell back on the couch as I tried to figure out what I should have been doing, since I was probably going to be trapped there for another two days or so.  
“Tch, let him figure it all out himself… Like you’d even let me… I thought you said I was an idiot…”  
My mind continued to bring me back to that part of the call as dad’s dismissive words echoed throughout my head.  
‘Let him figure it all out himself… Let it go Beth, let him figure it all out himself…’ I sat up, unable to relax after having to hear that old dickhead’s voice again.  
“Fine… I’ll figure it out!” I said, as I got up to put my shoes on to check the outside of the house for any water damage or something. 

As I made my way out the door, and down the porch’s mossy steps, I took the time to glare out at the rest of the houses. Everyone had been trapped inside since the storm, but that didn’t stop some people from trying to drive through the water in their big ass trucks every now and again. Honestly though, I couldn’t help but find it entertaining to watch them stall out in the middle of the flooding. I shook my head at the old Silverado that got abandoned near my front lawn that Sunday, before taking a lap around the house in search of… well… anything, I guess. 

The sound of water splashing up from the drowning grass greeted each of my labored steps, as I checked the foundation for any signs of water seeping in. But I didn’t really see any problems with it. That was good news at least. Luckily for me, my place was on a small hill, so my yard was only dotted with a few large puddles here and there; so, I really doubted that I’d see anything too serious.

As I continued creeping around my house, I reached the old cellar doors near the backyard.  
“Ah damn it!” I groaned as I remembered that the basement was probably the only place I needed to check... Right? Why couldn’t I concentrate?! Did that call really put me off that bad?  
“Come on man!” I growled at myself, “Grow up and focus!”  
The longer I stood there staring at the old double doors, the more I realized that I really didn’t know what I was actually doing. 

With both the flood water blocking every road in and out of the neighborhood, to mom and dad treating me like a moron, I was starting to feel overwhelmed. I desperately needed to find something to do before I went insane.  
“Whatever…” I groaned, as I went over to the basement’s hatchway and undid the deadbolt. I decided to just go down and check the place out really quick as I made my way back inside. After flinging the double doors open, I carefully make my way down the old stairs to get to a more comfortable angle to slam them shut behind me. A choice I would regret as I left myself in total darkness for a while. After fumbling around for the light, I managed to flick it on and was relieved to find that none of the water got down there yet. 

I took a minute to take the old basement in and noticed all the spare crap my parents left down there. I guess they couldn’t have been bothered with getting it all out. I mean the same could have been said about the other rooms in the house too, especially the second floor. And that’s when it hit me, I might as well finally go through all that trash now that I was officially trapped inside. Honestly, I didn't really know why I hadn't bothered to do that for the four weeks I lived there. I probably could have used the space.

Oh well. After moving some boxes away from the walls, just in case the water started seeping down there, I decided to just start upstairs since that’s where I spend most of my time anyways. I climbed the steps that lead to the kitchen and left my shoes by the back door as I grabbed a box of trash bags, just in case. I slowly make my way to the dining room to clear out the old cabinet mom and dad left there. 

I rummaged through both the shelves and the drawers for the first time, just to find that the entire thing was empty. Well, aside from the ballpoint hammer I found in the bottom drawer. They probably used it to put up all the crappy “art” they hung on the walls around the room. I decided to just ignore it and go upstairs after leaving it on one of the shelves.

I slowly made my way to the second floor to sort through all the boxes that were left in the two bedrooms up there. Both rooms took me a total of three-or-so hours to sort through, but eventually I managed to go through all the useless crap that was being kept in all the boxes. Despite finding nothing interesting, I still found myself feeling better despite that morning’s drama. I didn’t know if it was the fact that I was being productive for the first time in a few days, or maybe it was tossing out some of dad’s shit, but honestly, I was definitely in a better mood. 

After getting the trash bags full of old papers in one pile downstairs, and the now labeled boxes in another, I took a short break before starting on the last part of the house.  
The attic.  
At that point, I never even went up there before, and I also couldn’t see dad ever getting his old ass up there either. After fishing out the flashlight I kept in my room downstairs, I went back up to lower the trap door to the attic. 

After a few minutes of me struggling to grab the pull cord, I managed to finally get a hold of the damn thing.  
I decided to give it a gentle tug before slowly pulling it open. I watched as the sketchy looking ladder awkwardly unfolded itself down to my level, as a small cloud of dust littered the carpet.  
‘Nice’, I thought to myself, ‘Well, I forgot to vacuum anyway.’  
For a moment, I found myself just staring up into the darkness.  
For whatever reason, the attic gave off an unexplainable sense of foreboding that caused chills to run up and down my spine. It just felt… off.  
Like it was more than just a typical creepy attic… no… I could tell that something was not right up there, but I didn’t know what.

However, at that moment I was so determined to show my parents that I was capable of being on my own, I was able to quickly shake it off.  
“Calm down, man!” I said to myself.  
“If there was actually anything wrong with this place, I probably won’t be living here right now!”  
With that, my paranoia was replaced with embarrassment at the fact I let something as stupid as a dark attic freak me out. So, I took a deep breath, clicked on the flashlight, and started climbing up the ladder.  
The palms of my hands started to sweat, as the ladder began creaking from underneath me.  
However, I managed to get to the top without any other issues. 

After reaching the top, I stood up and shined my light across every corner of the room. Just to be kind of disappointed at what I saw.   
Old installation, that I prayed wasn’t asbestos or something, dangled from the ceiling and the whole space was empty aside from some boxes near a window at the end of the room.  
‘Oh well.’ I thought, ‘I made the effort to get up here.’  
I carefully made my way towards the window, hoping that the old boxes were hiding something dad’s inspectors missed.  
After I dodged some spider webs that hung from the ceiling, I finally reached them. 

There were four boxes in total, all of which were various sizes. Three were stacked on top of each other while the fourth, the bottom half of a small shoe box, was sitting on the floor next to them; a stack of yellowing papers rotting away inside of it.  
I decided to just go through the other boxes first, since they might actually have something in them.  
As I went through each one though, I was again disappointed to find nothing.  
The only things that were even kind of notable were some old brushes and oil paint.  
That, and more worn-out packing paper that were clearly just stuffed haphazardly into the other boxes as well. 

Honestly, I didn’t even know why I was even up there to begin with anymore… I could have deep cleaned every inch of that place or have gotten promoted at our firm for the second time… but they’d still probably would have continued to look down on me.  
Ever since the housing market crashed, they were being impossible to deal with! 

"You need to wake up, Micheal!" Dad shouted at me the last time I saw him in person. 

"You saw what happened to the economy! To us! Our entire livelihood! When are you going to grow up and take responsibility for yourself and quit acting like such an idiot?!" 

That was after a car accident too… and I was the one that got rear ended. 

"I don’t know…" was all I said to him. 

He couldn’t have been bothered to show up for the last piece of paperwork for that place, but he drove his ass over just to show of how little he thought of me.  
Despite the fact I paid for that car myself. Despite how much I put down on that house without their help, even though they OWNED the firm…  
They still treated me like an idiot... While spending what little free time we all had emphasizing how much we seemed to hate each other.  
Be it Dad’s blatant dressing-downs, to Mom’s off-hand comments and threatening to leave Dad’s sorry ass like **I** had to be the one to tell her to stay. 

"Your father has been coming home drunk again… Like always." Or maybe, "Oh? Well then how would you like to go live with your father after we separate, Michael?!"  
Then she’d break down and call herself a horrible mother again, and after I had to convince her she wasn’t, it was always "Let’s go somewhere this summer and reconnect as a family!"

 “Forget it…”  
I lazily tossed the boxes back in the pile, completely ignoring the fourth one. Screw it… I didn't need to fake some home project anymore, as if I ever needed to in the first place. 

As I stacked the pieces of shit back on top of each other, I couldn’t help but toss down the last one with a little more force than I meant to.  
A choice I would regret, as a large cloud of soot blasted me immediately afterwards, as the old papers from the shoe box went flying everywhere, in dust-ridden circles.  
“Dammit!” I shouted as I kicked the boxes at the wall. I step back for a moment, trying to calm myself down. However, a glance outside the attic window towards the flood that was holding me prisoner, prevented me from soothing myself. 

“Why is this happening now?!” I screamed out the window, as if the filthy water outside would give me an explanation for its intrusion into my life. 

I leaned against the wall as I gazed out at the ruined state of the neighborhood.  
Honestly it was almost symbolic.  
As I continued glaring furiously out at just one of the causes of my distress, something on the floor caught my eye.  
A little red glimmer shined up at me from the top of the old shoe box. Confused, I kneeled down to investigate and found an old leather-bound book staring back at me. 

Its dark green binding was wrapped tightly around it but seemed like it was beginning to rot away. The pages looked like they were in even worse condition by the brownish color the edges of the paper had.  
However, the most notable thing had to be the red gem that was implanted on the cover of the book.  
It was shaped like a little oval and looked smooth to the touch.  
The gem was surrounded by elaborate designs that looked like they were sewn in from another cut of leather. They consisted of various shapes and emblems that, together, formed a circle around the jewel.   
For whatever reason, finding this book made that feeling of unease return almost instantly. 

‘This isn’t right… This shouldn’t be here… Why would Dad’s guys leave this up here? This isn’t right’

Normally, I would feel stupid for being afraid of a book. But I just knew that there was definitely something wrong with this thing.  
Despite that, however, I found myself reaching for it. And before I knew it, I was holding the damn thing.  
“What are you?” I whispered as I looked down at it, the feeling of the old crusty leather making my fingers itch. 

I looked deeply into the jewel, almost lost in its haunting beauty. It was like it held all the answers to whatever it was that caused my woes. As if this tome could set me free from…  
I shook my head in an attempt to clear my thoughts. “It's just a book, idiot!” I groaned to myself, before running my thumb over the red jewel… *drip… drip…. drip…* I looked down at the three drops of blood that now stained its leather cover. 

My nose was bleeding… excessively.  
I lifted my right index and middle finger to one of my nostrils and wiped away at the long trail of blood that started running down my face.   
I looked down at my fingers in shock at just how dark the pigment of it was. It looked almost… black. 

‘This… isn’t… right…’

I wiped my nose with the sleeve of my hoodie, ignoring the large stain it left behind, as I felt myself starting to get lightheaded.  
I braced myself against the wall while the once overwhelming sense of unease, was replaced with a sudden obsession to see what was inside the book. It was as though it was calling out to me… Begging me to run my fingers up and down its weathered pages.  
To look deeply into the words that were scrawled within. 

As I looked back down at the jewel that was implanted in the book’s cover, I felt as though I had no choice but to answer its plea. No matter how hard I tried to fight it... I needed to see what was inside. With shaking hands, I moved to finally open up the book to the first page.  
As my fingers caressed the underside of the cover, I could feel my heart pounding in my chest.  
I let out a deep breath, one that I didn’t even know I was holding in the first place and flung the book open.

Within an instant, I felt the wind get knocked right out of my body as I was forced to stare down at what was before me. 

The book had no words… or at least not words that were written… It was as though it forced me to stare deeply into a blinding light that burned my eyes intensely. I felt the very foundation of my soul quake, as the disorienting aura of the world in which the book demanded I saw violated every last one of my senses.  
It was as though the gates of Limbo itself opened for me, and its victim’s sufferings were transmitted as a ray of unholy force. I have no idea how long I stood there for… clenching that… thing… as it tormented me.  
The last thing I remember… I was on my knees, rubbing my eyes furiously. 

It was like I was trying to get whatever I saw off my eyes themselves.  
I used every inch of my hands to attack my own eye sockets as they burned intensely. It was like they were set on fire from the inside, and I couldn’t help but claw at them.  
As I desperately scratched at my own face in an attempt to make the burning stop, I began to feel a strange substance begin to drain from my tear ducts.  
I struggled to open my eyes, just to see that blackish ichor that came out of my nose earlier now coating my hands.  
It began to rush out in a sudden and painful surge, as bile rose up from my stomach. 

The pain forced me down to my hands and knees as I clenched the floorboards.  
Suddenly, a hellish stew began to drench the ground beneath me.  
After a torturous fifteen minutes or so, it all finally stopped… and I began retching at both, the pain and the sight of the blackened gore under me.  
I grimaced as I tried to get to my feet, bracing myself against the windowsill as I struggled to catch my breath. My hands fought to keep their grip on its short outcropping, as every one of my fingers were drenched in slippery gore.

I tried to gather myself, as I leaned my forehead against the dirty glass of the window. I did everything I could to slow down my breathing, as I fought against myself.  
After a while, I was able to properly open my eyes again. As I slowly began to regain my sight, I carefully turned around to take in the carnage that was now all over the attic’s floor. I stared down in disgust and fear at the indescribable mound of bile that exploded out of my body, it even began to stink up the damn place. 

I had to quickly turn away, before I found myself vomiting again, and decided to just focus my attention on the outside for a moment.  
As I glared out the window, I noticed something.  
I swore I saw it in the water outside.  
I tried to focus on, what appeared to be, some kind of large shape that was hunched over near the abandoned truck at the edge of my lawn.  
At first, it just looked like a shadow or something, but as my sight became less blurred, it seemed more like a giant wad of hair.  
That’s when the thing moved behind the truck almost instantly.  
Like it was trying to hide from me. Like… Like it knew I was watching it. 

As I pressed my face against the window in an attempt to get a better view of the thing, I was suddenly met with a familiar glittering light.  
But this time it wasn’t coming from inside the attic… No, it was coming from the thing outside.  
Two little red orbs glared at me from behind the front bumper of the old Chevy.  
They appeared to be a set of crimson eyes that glared up at the attic window… and right at me.  
I met their gaze, as a painful migraine started creeping across my temples.  
I quickly turned away, and slid down the wall as my ass met the floor.

Regretfully, I got some of the bile on my shoes. But at that moment I didn’t care. I was overwhelmed… terrified… everything that had just happened to me at that moment… It was too much. I was drained and my mind was completely numb.  
However, I decided that enough was enough. I needed to get the hell out of there.  
I forced myself on my hands and knees and crawled around the gore puddle as I made my way back to the ladder… back to safety. 

‘Hurry! Hurry!’ 

I shouted at myself as I fought my way further.  
‘We’re so close! Almost there, man! You’re almost there!’.  
As I got closer to the ladder, I slipped down to an army crawl.  
An accident that, for whatever reason, put the fear of God in me. It was as though I was being attacked… Like the book, or the thing outside, was now coming for me.  
With a primal surge of adrenaline now rushing through my veins, I clawed my way to the ladder as fast as I could. Almost throwing myself to the second floor in the process.  
However, when I did finally reach it, I was able to steady myself and climbed the ladder back down. 

The moment my feet hit the floor, I forced the ladder up and slammed the trap door back into place.  
I glared up at it for a moment, almost expecting to see something start banging against the attic door or something.  
But no… the house fell silent. The momentary peace was almost unbearable though. Like… Like the quiet before the storm that put me in this situation in the first place.  
But this time, the house wasn’t as safe as it was before. I struggled to think of what to do next, as I stood alone in the middle of the hallway. 

But what could I have done? After something so… messed up… Something so unpredictable… I had nothing… Nothing that would make everything okay again.  
‘Call someone… You need to call someone…’ I told myself as I quietly made my way back downstairs.  
Yet, as I reached the living room, all I did was just sat down on the couch and stared at the wall.  
“Call someone? Call who?” I say, as if I was demanding the answer from myself.  
‘Emergency Services? A Priest? Mom…’ I stared on more intently, as my eyes traced along every ripple in the white paint that covered the wall before me. 

“The roads are blocked… They’ve BEEN blocked. Emergency Services have been struggling to get here for days now… if they can’t do it… I doubt anyone can…”  
I looked towards the curtains, as the growing darkness of the approaching evening doused my home in shadows.  
“And there’s something outside… What if it hurts her? What if it hurt them both?”  
Mom… Dad… I was worried about them too. What if that thing was still there if, or when, they came to check on me? Could I really have lived with that? 

I tried to get to my feet, but I just ended up collapsing onto the couch.  
Before I knew it, I was asleep as the events from earlier had left me too weak to fight off my own tiredness. I laid there all alone, like I always did, as I drifted off into a deep sleep.

I tried to scream… I fought just to make a sound… all in a futile attempt to cry for help.  
‘Help… Help me…’ I shrieked from inside my own head, as the overwhelming agony that each breath left me silenced my pleas. I tried to look down at myself; I tried to see what was wrong. But I just couldn’t move.  
Each time I tried, I was met with pure torture. It was my bones themselves, my ribs to be more pacific, they were shattered and digging deeper into my lungs with every breath I took. 

In pure desperation to make the pain stop, I held my breath. I was hoping that the temporary relief would do something to help me endure it. But all that managed to do was delay the inevitable for me. And besides, I was in too much shock to hold my breath well enough for it to matter.  
Each raspy gasp I made, caused a shock wave of agony to echo through me. Every breath, every slight movement, it was… indescribable.  
As I laid there, clenching my teeth, I felt as though someone was standing over me. Looking down at my ravaged body… but doing nothing.  
‘Help… Why aren’t you helping…’

I woke up in a violent jolt that almost sent me to the floor.  
I found myself back on the couch… all in one piece again.  
I ran my hands up and down my torso, as if to clarify that I was okay.  
And to my relief, I was.  
I sat up on the couch as I tried to calm myself down again.  
‘What’s happening to me? WHY is this happening to me?’ The book, the “bleeding”, the thing outside, and now that dream?  
What the hell was going on? Was I going insane? Was this all cabin fever or something? Did I slip myself shrooms and forget?  
I tried to think of any excuse I could to explain this away. I just couldn’t handle any more of… whatever this was. 

But I was quickly brought back to the reality of my situation, as I looked down at myself.  
I was disgusted by the blood stains of various shades that drenched my hoodie, like some kind of demonic tie dye. And of course, my dumbass had to wear white that day too.  
I tried to get to my feet, as my legs shook from under me.  
As I finally managed to stand up straight, I wobbled over to the light switch. Just to discover that the power was out.  
Dammit! No power… no phone.  
I groaned in frustration, as I walked towards the curtains to take a look outside again. I didn’t care what I saw the day before, if the coast was clear I was going to get the hell out of there. 

As I slowly pulled the window hangings apart, I poked my head out to scan the streets for any sign of that… thing.  
I stared intently at the truck in particular and was happy to see nothing.  
“Good…” I whispered to myself, “Maybe I can make it…”  
I stepped away from the window, as I looked towards the door. I knew that I wasn’t in any shape to walk through all that water, but I didn’t care.  
Hell, I’d swim down the street if I had to. Because there was no way I was about to stay there alone for any longer.  
That book, if it even was a book in the first place, was still in the house.  
And if that was the case, screw this house! 

I braced myself against the wall, as I creeped my way to the front door. When I finally reached it, I placed a shaking hand on the doorknob…

I felt my blood turn cold the very moment I heard it…  
That horrible feeling of forbidding from the attic had once again struck me from out of nowhere.  
I stood in stunned silence as the sound of a loud howl echoed throughout the neighborhood. Its haunting cry caused my house to vibrate, as the growing wind carried its dark call.  
“That was just a dog!” I told myself, “Just a freakin’ dog! We need to get out of here, NOW!”  
I stopped to catch my breath, as I readied myself to open the door again.  
However, as I began to slowly pull it open…

*Splash! Splash! Splash!*

Something was running through my yard… and it was heading straight towards my front door!  
I slammed it shut right as whatever it was stopped at the edge of my porch.  
For a while, I stood there in stunned silence as I held onto the doorknob so hard that my knuckles were turning white.  
For a fleeting second, I contemplated fighting whatever was out there.  
But I decided to just lean my ear against the door and listen.  
Nothing… There was no sound what-so-ever.

But I still decided to just walk away as I was too tired to deal with anything, anymore.  
I retreated to the kitchen after making sure the door was locked and leaned against the counter as I tried to steady myself.  
‘What was that? What am I supposed to do now?!’  
As I fought to keep myself standing, I noticed a familiar gleam from the corner of my eye.

*Drip… Drip… Drip…*

I couldn’t bring myself to look down at the three drops of blood that now stained my kitchen’s tiles, as all my attention was on the book again. 

It was laying on the floor, leaning itself against the refrigerator.  
The glittering of that daman jewel shone out at me despite the lights being off.  
I looked down at it in horror, as I felt a weight form in the pit of my stomach.  
Just the sight of that thing was enough to send me tumbling to the cold floor.

As I struggled to get back up, I stared at the book in a crazed panic.  
I could feel a tight pain begin to swell around my temples, as though my growing headache threatened to crush my skull into paste.  
Since I was unable to stand up again, I decided to force myself to crawl out of the kitchen… and away from that… thing.  
As I slowly inched forwards, I tried to avoid looking at the book as it began to call out to me again

I… I swear it said my name… It said my name to me!  
It told me of what would await me if I were to answer its call… How it was sent to save my very soul.  
“Piss off!” I shouted as I squeezed my eyes shut in defiance, “Get away from me! Just leave me alone!”  
*Thump*  
I winced as my forehead hit the floor.  
As if on pure instinct, my hands grabbed the sides of my head, as the agony of my migraine became unbearable.  
Without time to properly prepare myself, my face just hit the floor when my crawling was interrupted by that wave of absolute torture.

But I wasn’t going to listen to it this time…  
No!  
I told myself over and over that I would NEVER open that thing up again…  
Never again!  
Through clenched teeth, and bleeding ears, I slowly dragged myself away from the book.  
“Come on… Come on!” I shouted, as I struggled to endure the pain.  
I don’t know how long it took for me to slither my way to the living room, but when I finally got there, I was rewarded with the end of my agony.

Even though strains of blackened blood continued to roll out of my ears, I was almost crying from the relief. ‘You did it, man! You did it!’  
After giving myself about a minute to recover, I stared up at the front door. And I decided that I didn’t care about what was outside anymore, I was leaving.  
I fought to stand up again, using the back of the couch as a crutch, and stumbled towards the door.  
When I finally reached it, I heard that terrible howl.  
This time, it was lower, and I felt pure hate behind its haunting tone.

‘I don’t care…’  
I braced myself against the door, as I heard something creep its way through my muddy yard.  
‘You think I’m scared of you?’  
I clenched the knob tightly after hearing another howl… closer this time… right outside my door.  
‘I don’t care anymore…’  
The entire house shook while the lights flashed on and off again.  
‘I’m leaving…’  
Without a second thought…  
Without any hesitation, since I never gave myself enough time to think about it…  
I flung the door open…  
And I saw it staring back at me…

I quickly slammed the door shut, right as the thing lunged at me… barking and… and screaming.  
I threw myself against the door as this… mutant dog thing tried to break its way inside.  
I threw all of my weight against that door as it did the same right back.  
Its deranged barking slowly turned into pure shrieking… like… Like I was listening to something being tortured to death right on my porch.

I screamed as I struggled to keep the door closer; but it just wouldn’t stop.  
And right as I started wearing out, I felt it thrust one of its massive paws through the opening in the doorway. For about a second, it kept that mangled looking thing on my forearm; before it dug its claws into my flesh.  
I never felt anything like that before… it was…  
Despite everything the book did to me, it was nowhere near as painful as that thing’s nails slashing me open like that.  
I screamed so hard; I thought that I might tear my throat apart.

With one adrenaline fueled push, I thrusted the door back in its face; and crushed its leg or arm or whatever between the edge of the door and its frame.  
I heard a whimper from outside, but the thing still wasn’t letting go of me.  
So, I kept bashing myself into the door, over and over and over again.  
Until, finally, it retracted its paw and ran back into the flood water.

I managed to flick the lock back into place before I feel over, grasping at my injured forearm.  
I groaned in pain as I held my arm to my chest, a searing pain rushing through it with every pump of my own pulse.  
As I laid there defeated, the realization that I wasn’t going to be escaping that house hit me.  
I stared up at the ceiling as I struggled to think of what to do next.  
That was when I felt it again… My head started to throb… And I felt the blood begin to gush out of my nostrils.

It's taken so much of my blood from me… and replaced it with something else…  
Something worse...  
How haven’t I just fainted?  
Hell, why wasn’t I blind?  
It was coming out of my eyes about a day ago.  
No… It needed me to see…  
It WANTED me to see.

I slowly turned my head upwards to glare at the book, now leaning against the couch a few feet away.  
I winced at the glittering lights that shone from its jewel.  
It was waiting for me, and I swear I felt a sense of smugness coming from it.  
I hate that thing.  
I tried to shout a spiteful protest at it, but it was no use.  
I was far too worn out to do anything but stare at it, pain echoing through every ounce of my body.  
I was helpless… powerless… My defiant rage was replaced with fear.  
Fear at the realization that I was at this thing’s mercy…  
Like I always was from the start.

I couldn’t fight back, and I knew it.  
I don’t want to admit it… But I cried… I cried harder than I ever cried before.  
As I looked up at the book through tearful eyes, I watched it begin to open itself up.  
I didn’t care enough to fight it anymore, I just waited to see the horrors that were calling after me.  
I felt myself lose all control over my own body as it flipped through its pages.  
It was like there was no end… they just kept going on forever…  
As I watched the pages fly by at an unnatural speed, my body went completely limp as I started struggling to breathe. Each breath was becoming more and more painful by the second.

‘Not again… No… Please, not again…’

I slammed my eyes shut as I felt the familiar agony of my ribs crushing into my lungs.  
The sharp bones that slowly stabbed into me, sent waves of unbearable torture through me.  
I dug my nails into the hardwood floor, as I struggled to endure the constant agony that each breath left me in. As the pain continued to grow, the pages began to flip faster and faster as I again heard the book cry out to me.

For almost three whole hours… I drowned in my own, shattered lungs as the Hellish chorus from the book shrieked through my very soul.  
It wasn’t until a crack of thunder rattled my house, that I finally woke up from my own personal hell.  
The room finally fell silent, and again I was broken.  
I couldn’t move… couldn’t think… Even though I was able to breathe again, it was in rapid pants that just weren’t enough.  
It was like I was still suffocating.

“Michael… Michael Mallas…”

It came from across the house… the dining room, I think.  
But I didn’t look up to see who it was… I was still paralyzed.  
I just continued to stare up at the ceiling.

“You have read my book… Seen my home… And you have felt what waits for you.”

I listened as they stalked their way closer to me, I didn’t hear footsteps…  
But I just knew where they were.  
I don’t really know how to explain it, but it's like when you sense someone staring at you across the room.  
But it felt… colder…   

“That is what waits for you, Michael. The suffocating… the shattered body. One day, that will be how everything will end for you.”  
It said as it finally stood over me.  
“Every experience in your life… Ends in a tormented whimper at the side of a dark road. I am sorry, Michael.”

I tried to focus my vision on what was standing over me… but I could barely see it. It just looked like someone put a black cloak on a stand and left it there.  
No arms… no face… Just a hooded cloak, hovering there like the darkness of the room was all that was inside.

“I can make that go away… Save you… Like I have many others before…” 

The tone of its voice was low and smooth, like it was trying to fake a nicer sounding one for my sake.  
“What… What do you want?”  
I managed to croak out.

“YOU”

I felt my heart sink…  
It didn’t need to explain anything else.  
I knew what it meant, and I couldn’t believe it… It wanted my soul…  
‘How cliche.’

“If you agree, I shall send both my tome and my hound away. And I will personally see to it that your passing wouldn’t be for a very long time. That, and it will be oh so very peaceful. But if you refuse.”

It then looked down at me, two red orbs glaring hauntingly into my soul…  
The soul it wanted so badly…

“You know what will happen to you… But not what I will do to you as payment for your refusal.”  
It leans itself back up before adding,  
“You have until tonight… Do not try to run again.”

And with that… It was gone… And I could move again.
