I had a dream. In that dream I was in a box. It was made out of obsidian. I could see that because of a tiny light that shined through. That little circle let me know where I was. Otherwise it was dark. I could only walk. And as I walked, I realized I was in a square. I don’t know how much time there was. In dreams I don’t understand much. I don’t know where I was. Nor should I even care. I didn’t feel any fear. 

I should have felt fear.

A door opened, and I walked through it. And now I was in complete darkness. I had clothes on, but I didn’t have shoes. I could feel the cold surface. Still obsidian. I kept walking on land. I could see nothing. There were no sounds except my own breathing. I never talked. I kept walking.

I could smell something metallic. I kept walking. And then a limb grabbed my left leg. 

I could feel the fingers press against my skin. As I tried to fling it away I fell, and as I fell, three more hands grabbed each of my limbs, and began to pull me apart. I could feel the pain. I could feel my skin stretch. Cuts emerged. Somehow my bones never left. I don’t know why my bones never left. But the blood was seeping out.

And then I could feel something try to drink my blood. I could feel something just slurp it up. I was getting terrified. My heart was beating.

And finally I woke up. I looked around and saw I was in my own home. There was nothing much. 

Then, the next day I went to sleep again. I went to bed around 11 pm. I didn’t pay much thought. I thought it was just a nightmare. As I went to sleep, I woke up in a wooden box. Square. There was a glass ceiling above, and below there was a carpet. And in front of me, there was a woman at a desk. She was beautiful in a dress. I was sitting down on the carpet, and she asked me a question.

“Do you want resin?”

I said yes. She said okay. And she handed me a piece.

Then I woke up again. But I saw something on my left hand, on my wrist. Somehow I had a cut, that said “Resin.” And then I went back to sleep.

Next day after, I went back to sleep again. This time I was nervous. I was awake till 2 am. Finally somehow I went to sleep. I didn’t wanna. I was scared of what I would see.

This day was a yellow box. Color of a lemon. It was just painted so. I was in this box, and the woman came back in. As she came back in, she came to my left wrist. She looked at my hand. “Resin” was still engraved in it. Though, throughout the day it had started to fade away. It was just a scratch. As she saw that, she held my hand, and she looked at me and smiled.

I was terrified.

“I have resin. Do you want it? On you?”

I said “No.”

She asked “Do you want it on me?”

I said “Why?”

“Because, it can be a deal. I have it on me right now. Then you have it later.”

I said “Sure.”

So she looked into her pocket, and pulled out a piece.

“I have it on me right now.”

And then she gave it to me. “You will have it forever.”

I said “Okay.” And then I woke up.

I could swear I saw a shadow move away. And I looked at both my right and left wrist, and I saw the word “Resin” on it. I don’t know what was happening.

Next day I was just researching resin, and it clicked. “Reins.”

I don’t know how to explain that. I just felt every single hair on my body stand. “What am I into? What is happening?” I stayed awake the whole night, and I stayed awake the whole day until finally I collapsed.

I woke up, and this time I was in a red room. It was like the yellow room but painted again. The red was a dark red. I looked in front and the woman was already there. She walked towards me.

“You learned didn’t you?”

I said “Yes. I do not want anything.”

And she said “How can you not want anything? Isn’t it silly?”

I didn’t care. I just wanted to run. Immediately I ran towards a wall and began to claw. I began to claw and the blood began to seep out. She began laughing and walked towards me. And then she took one of my fingers and began to suckle on it.

I wanted out. This was too much. This was too much. I began to yell. She just smiled. And finally I tried to escape her grasp. As I tried to move away she grabbed both my right and left wrist, and put her feet on my left and right, and she splayed me.

“You are not going anywhere. You’re mine. Remember?”

I was just held. And then I woke up. I saw the shadow, and this time it was slower to move. I looked at my wrist. “Resin.” I looked at my legs around my ankle. “Resin.”

I began to laugh. “What the hell is happening?”

Next day after that I went to church, and asked a priest. I was embarrassed to tell anyone. The priest could offer nothing much. It was shocking. I showed him, and the priest said “maybe you are carving these into yourself.” I said “Why?” And the priest said “I don’t know. In the past we used to look at God. Now we realize the demons are with us. But still pray.”

But I told him about the shadow. And he said “Yes, maybe it is something beyond us. But it is now with us.”

I wanted to sleep that night. I was scared. I was alone. I wanted somebody with me. And that’s when I realized. She knew I wanted somebody. People will take advantage of us. The demon knew what to do then.

I went back to sleep, and when I woke up, she was right in front of me. I told her “What do you want?”

She said “I want your blood. I am like a vampire. I don’t have fangs, but I can tear you apart. But I don’t wanna tear you apart. I kill you I don’t have blood.”

I asked her “Why did you say I wanted resin?”

“Oh… Because resin isn’t just ‘reins.’ It’s also ‘risen.’”

I said “What does that mean?”

And she said “You’ll find out.”

And then I woke up and I saw her right in front of me. She wasn’t a shadow anymore. Her eyes were red. Her skin was gray. Her hair was splintering. She walked on to my bed, and looked at me. And then, she took a nail, it was sharp and she sliced right across me. There was a wound, and the blood began to spool, and she began to suck, and I stood still. And then she left.

And I heard “You will always be mine. You can’t do much now. Tell somebody else, they will never believe you. I will make the scabs go away. I will make you feel more pain than you ever have. You can not escape me. You are mine, and in due time you will like that. You want this. You know you want this.”

And she left. And so I am now typing this.

Somebody please help. I just heard “siren.”
