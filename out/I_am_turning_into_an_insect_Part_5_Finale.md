Hey everyone, this just might be the last post I make (under this name, at least).

Tonight was the night, and a massive storm held its power over the facility, and most of the utilities went out.

We saw this as an opportunity, and my queen told me that she wanted me to do something for her.

Alongside breaking her out, she wanted me to find her children, and save them as well, since the guards would take any larva she would lay.

I agreed to this, being the loyal worker drone I am, And rushed to the metal door.

Due to not being held down by electric pistons, I easily beat it down with my enhanced strength and pressed on.

No more would I be stopped by my fear, I roared and jumped on top of a guard, ripping his organs out with my claws, swallowing any fear of punishment I may have felt.

The security was foolishly weak this time since nobody wanted to work during such an insane, long storm.

I wandered the facility, looking for the testing labs where my queen's children would be kept.
 
Soon, at block e, in sector 6, I found a holding chamber where all of the naturally born hybrids were kept, including her larva.

I easily knocked down the small metal door, and set the bees free, They ignored me and immediately swarmed to return to their mother.

Alright, the time for favors was over, now for some destruction.

I crept through the vents and watched, I may not be able to take the whole security staff on equal terms, but that won't stop me from sabotaging every last system I find.

I landed in the security room and started to break all of the weapons and crush the bullets.

Then, I smashed the camera system to pieces, bashed the life support engines, and otherwise took care of every single system they had.

Good, now I just needed to get rid of their generators.

The storm was bad enough, once I did that, they would have no power at all, and it would be easy pickings from that point on.

There were a lot of close calls, my new body is fast and thin, but that didn't stop one of them from spotting my tail as I darted across the hall.

If it wasn't for some clever distractions, and an even more clever silent take-down, I may have been caught.

Regardless, I found my way to the generator room and kicked the generator again and again, before also damaging the breakers, now they were helpless.

I watched as my kin easily clawed their way out, now that they were free of restraint, and viciously overran their captors.

Knowing I could not forget her, I returned to my old cell and helped my queen move.

She cannot stand due to her severe mutations, So I had to carry her, not that I minded.

I made sure nobody serving this vile place was left alive, I spared Buddy and the cleaning staff, they had nothing to do with the misery I had been granted.

I watched from afar with my queen as Buddy escorted the horrified staff into their cars.

And now that horrible place can be left to rot, I made sure to grind every last bit of research into bits, hopefully, I set them back by a few years.

I won't tell where for obvious reasons, but now my queen has started a hive in a deep cave near the lab, Now she can relax, but my work has just begun.

Mark my words, I will hunt down every sorry motherfucker who perpetuates this cycle.

I am not immortal, I know that soon, the facility will kill me, experiment on me, or otherwise take me out of action.

And quite frankly, I accept that, but I will not rest until I know that I can drag this place into hell with me.

My name is Thomas Baker, I am a mantis, and I bid you farewell.
