 

Although I really wasn't too popular in elementary school, I finally made a few friends in middle school At the time I was 12 so I guess I couldn't claim to have been popular, but at least I had a few friends to hang out with. It all started when I skipped school with a guy named Adam one day. Not having much to really do, we went around to the guitar shops and played guitar. I guess he didn't know that I played and when he knew that I did, we ended up spending a lot more time hanging out. I also met some of his friends too. We mostly just hung out and played guitar all of the time. It wasn't my absolute favorite thing to do, but I had friends for the first time, so that was cool.

One Friday at school, Adam, who lived with his grandmother, told me that she was going to be out of town for the weekend. He said he was going to have a couple of guys over and that I should be there. I, of course, was happy to have something to do.

Adams grandmother lived right on the edge of town. It was a two story house next to the train tracks. Adam lived in the attic and that is usually where we were when we were hanging out and playing guitar. I really didn't know all of Adam's friends, so I was feeling a little strange about being around all these people.

We stayed up really late playing guitar and hanging out the first night there. It was nice, but there was one guy who was freaking me out a little bit. His name was David and he was just a bit weird. He didn't really play the guitar at all. He also didn't talk much, which I thought was weird and unsettling considering the fact that he would just stand there in a dim shaded Connor of the room we were in just staring .  Anwyays We were all up in Adam's room so were all sprawled out on a few pieces of furniture. I was laying on the bed and at one point, the guy Ken reached over and pulled the mattress up. Without actually asking for Adam's permission, he got out his dirty magazines and began looking through them while they other ones of us just played guitar. That just struck me as weird.

Even weirder, he didn't really interact well with any of us when he was looking at the magazines. However, occasionally I would catch him looking up from his magazine and staring at me. He would be smiling and just looked unpleasant. which at the time really made me uncomfortable

Even though it was pretty warm in the attic, we all sort of drifted off to sleep at some point. It wasn't unusual. But I had a hard time sleeping in Adam's bed. I was uneasy and woke up once. I was surprised to see David who was still up and still checking out those jag mags. And he was looking at me with just the most unpleasant looking grin. I immediately just closed my eyes, unsure if he was aware that I ever got up.

The next time I woke up, he was still at it. I stumbled out of the room, mumbling something about needing a glass of water. When I was downstairs, it was much cooler than in the attic. I decided to crash on the couch. I mean, I told myself I did it because it was cooler. But I really did it because of David. He just gave off a creepy vibe

I fell asleep pretty quickly and was woken up later. When I heard someone fumbling around in the kitchen. I figured it was one of the guys getting a glass of water. So I just flipped back around and tried to go back to sleep.

I woke up later because I felt the couch moving. I must have turned around in my sleep because I was no longer facing the back of the couch. I looked and immediately noticed what was moving the couch. Ken was sitting on the floor with his feet bracing against the couch. He had his pants down and was **jerking off** with one hand while **holding a knife** in the other. And he was looking at me.

I was really freaked now. But I don't think he noticed that I opened my eyes. With him holding the knife, I really didn't want to shock him or anything. So I closed my eyes and pretended to go to sleep. However, it was hard to think about anything other than what this freak was doing. I just held my breath and waited until it was over.

When it was, I felt him take his feet off the couch and stand up. I then felt the tip of the knife on my back as he traced it along the side. I prepared to be stabbed... but thankfully I wasn't. After a minute, he took the knife back to the kitchen and went back into the attic. I slipped out of the house and went home. I couldn't be in the same house as that freak and when I told Adam about it, he went ballistic. I never saw the guy David again. Something else I'd like to mention is that as I was leaving Adam's house I heard an unsettling groan coming from the basement and as much as that freaked me out my curiosity got the best of me So I walked slowly and quietly and peeked through the keyhole in the basement door and saw Ken fucking licking Adam while sleeping in his ear and sniffing him and kept on doing suddenly when Adam woke up he looked over and saw David's face staring right at him he screamed and then David proceed to pin him down and touch him without Adams consent and kept on doing it to the point where it's considered abuse after I saw that happen I Instantly rushed out of there as fast as I could I didn't talk to Antony about for a whole month 10 weeks later I asked Adam what happened and he proceeds to say that it fucking traumatized him and after Adam was done sexualy abusing him he tried to slit open his wrist and then procced to stab him so Adam had to punch him and then strangle him down a few minutes later he was unconscious so he called the cop's and explained what had happened they then took David to Jail It turn's out that he was a registered sex offender and was mentally deranged

 ***Oh, and just so you know, this isn't anti gay or anything. I don't even think Ken was gay, he was just weird.***
