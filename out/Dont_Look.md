 

I just found this in one of the top drawers of my desk in the apartment block I moved into last week. It's a nice place, one bedroom, bathroom, kitchen/living room combo. Cheap too. Nice area, plus I got a flat that overlooked the inner courtyard. Bedroom was surprisingly well furnished, bed, wardrobe, desk with a lamp and chair, beanbag and spare mattress.

But I was looking through the cabinets and drawers and stuff, just to check that the previous tenant hadn't forgot anything. I think it's a joke. It's not very funny if so. Maybe the landlord figured out I was moving in alone and told the old resident as some form of prank, like a mild hazing ritual, you know?  

It's a letter, written on some sort of old-style blotting paper. It's slightly crinkled and dry with age like it was done many years ago. Written in some form of fountain/ink pen. It gets... scrawled and hard to read towards the end. 

It reads:

*"You. Whoever you are.*

*When the clock strikes ten to midnight.*

*Don't look in the shadows.*

*Seriously.*

*Don't.*

*I know it may be hard, especially now that I've told you not too, but hold strong and*

*Don't* 

*Look.*

*Not even a glance.*

*Not even out of the corner of your eye.*

*Don't look.*

*I hope you never feel them. I'm sorry for making you aware but I wasn't until my neighbour told me about them, what they do.*

*They are fast, faster than you can even imagine. They hunt in the dark and will never stop, not until they have found and eaten their prey. You.*

*I bet you can feel it now, can't you? The growing heaviness in the air.*

*But, DOnt LooK.*

*They are coming for me. The clock is ticking closer and closer to that dreaded time.*

*I'm not going to look I'm not going to look I'm not going to look*

*It just chimed.*

*Oh God*

*I can hear them, stealing into my room*

*This desk*

*I moved it so that I faced over the courtyard*

*That way I didn't need to see them, I could stare into the moon but-*

*The skies are cloudy tonight. I've only got my lamp.*

*I can* 

*I just need to*

*wait*

*That's a child?!*

*They can sound like, like*

*Amy*

*they sound like amy*

*she, shes so lonely and sad*

*i could help*

*they are crying and screaming*

*i could help*

*all i need to do is* 

*no*

*nononononononono*

*dont look dont look dont look*

*if i write it enough*

*its fine*

*its fine*

*its fine*

*but*

*surely a little peek wouldnt matter right?*

*no*

*no*

*but it cant really hurt*

*i don't know*

*it feels like they are whisphering*

*go on*

*look*

*i could just*

*ill just have a peak*

*i could help them*

*i could help her*

*my precious little amy*

*my my*

*no no!!*

*dont look*

*its a trick*

*its a* 

*ill just* 

*one glance*

*just one look*

*just to see her one last time*

*just one*

*oh God*

*oh God please*

*i looked*

*dont*

*dont*

*dont*

*look*

*God please help m"*

That's where the letter ends. It's just a joke, right? The creepy thing is, the shadows seem a little darker right now, and there was no light from the lamp when I turned it on. And I checked the weather. It's meant to be cloudy tonight too. But it's just a joke, right? Right?
