Hello nosleep Reddit-ers, 

I need help. About 8 years ago I acquired what I now believe to be a haunted or cursed object. Yes, she happens to be a doll, but moderators, please hear me out. I really need help. 

She is a small porcelain doll that I bought for $3 from an antique store I used to frequent in college. She was so sweet looking and I had never seen another tiny doll like her, so I took her home. 

She is about 3" tall by 1.5" wide, she is hand-painted, made of porcelain, and has delicate articulated limbs. She didn't come with clothes and I never thought to try to buy or make any that would fit her. 

I didn't know that she was haunted or cursed until a few years ago when I came across her again, having packed away many of my things from college. 

I had put her in a velvet bag and hadn't disturbed her in a long time. My life had been going really well up until then. I was finally at a consistent and happy mental place since graduating college, and when I found her, at first, I was delighted. I had forgotten about her and as I said before, she is a very sweet looking little doll, so I admired her for a while before putting her back where I found her. 

The weeks following my finding her again were filled with an onslaught of various life issues, bad luck, and a serious depressive episode-- the worst I had experienced since college. 

A few months later, I was re-organizing art supplies in my basement and disturbed her again. Once more, I experienced another string of life issues, various things breaking, and a period of having a very bad mental space. 

It was after that second experience when it finally clicked that each time I had disrupted her, my life and metal health went haywire for a while. 

I thought I might be overreacting, but the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. 

It was shortly after buying her when I really started struggling with my mental health in college. I had her in my room when my roommate and I started having serious issues and they ended up moving out. She stayed on display while I struggled with the worst nightmares and night terrors I have ever experienced. She sat on my work desk in the same room I made my un-aliving attempt. You get the picture. In the worst times of my life, I remember her being there. 

I've had an interest in finding a way to get rid of her before, but I've always put it on the back burner since I don't think there is a way to get rid of her without massively disturbing her and possibly pissing her off. 

Well, just before I made my account and started typing this, I accidentally bumped the velvet bag she is in while looking for something, and found myself profusely apologizing to her before backing out of my basement and turning off the lights in the hopes that she would be appeased. 

It was this reaction that made me realize that I can't do this anymore. I am, logically or not, actually afraid of this little doll and I don't know what to do with her. 

I want her out of my house and I don't want to have to sell her to do it. That would require taking her out to take pictures of her, and then proceeding to upload her onto my phone, my laptop, or both, in order to make a listing. I don't know how much that would anger her and I don't know if uploading a picture of her would allow her to access my devices. 

I was once advised to cut a hole in my wall and patch it up with her in it so that she could never be disturbed again, and so that once I eventually sell this house, I would be rid of her, but I don't like that idea at all.

I need her gone, but I don't want her going to just anyone. I need to find someone or some place that knows how to handle a haunted and/or cursed object, and can protect themselves from it. Any guidance as to how I can do that or where I can send her to would be greatly appreciated.
