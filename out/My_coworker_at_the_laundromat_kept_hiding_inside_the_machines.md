Last year I worked at a laundromat near my parents before I moved away to college. I saw the advert in the window when I was shopping with my Dad, and figured it was an easy way to earn some money. 

The woman who ran the laundromat 'interviewed' me and I started that same day, but not before she introduced me to her daughter—who also worked there. She was called Mia, was really petite and really...odd. 

The first time I met her she immediately said, "Hey! Can you do this...?"

Then she did this weird thing with her eyes that made them vibrate. It's hard to explain, like they were rapidly moving side to side, and the whole time she had this toothy smile on her face like it was the most amazing thing in the world.

Mia must have only been a year or two younger than me, so still in her teens, but her behaviour seemed really juvenile and kind of try-hard.

Anyway, I just figured she was trying to break the ice in her own way, so just kind of rolled with it. I got through the rest of the day with just small talk and didn't think too much of it.

I was barely a week into the job when I first caught her hiding inside one of the machines. She'd somehow managed to climb up and curl herself up in one of the big tumble dryers. I wouldn't have even noticed had I not walked past and heard her giggling inside the drum, scaring the shit out of me.

"What're you doing?" I asked, annoyed she was dicking around whilst I was working my ass off.

Her large eyes watched me in the darkness, her legs pressed up against her flat chest. 

"I'm just cleaning it."

"Right. Okay."

I'd literally cleaned the lint out of the machine just this morning so didn't buy her bullshit for one minute. Anyway, she climbed out of the machine like a creepy gymnast shortly after, earning a few strange glances from some of the customers, but no one was hurt.

The next time was worse. About three days later I was helping this young mom set up a load of laundry after her machine broke in her apartment. It was her first time in a laundromat so she didn't really know where to start and had brought her kid along too, although she wasn't doing a very good job of keeping an eye on him.

I'd just finished walking her through the different powders, prices and settings when I heard that same eerie, echoing giggle again towards the back of the store—only this time it was followed by a child's laughter. As soon as I heard the sound I had a weird hitching feeling in my gut. Although I'd only known Mia for about a week, I knew leaving a random kid with her would be like leaving them unattended by an open electrical socket. Anything could happen.

"Sorry, I'll be right back," I said to the mom, leaving her to load her washing into the machine.

Most of the machines in the laundromat were 10kg washing machines. We also had a few larger 18kgs, and one massive front loaded 33kg machine used for washing duvets etc which Mia's mom had affectionately christened 'The Beast'.

The whole time I'd worked there I'd never seen it used once, yet I found Mia half inside The Beast that day, playing with the kid stood in front of it. Her bottom half was inside the drum, elbows resting on the rubber seal with the door open as she handed quarters to the boy. She was pulling funny faces and doing that weird thing with her eyes again, making him laugh. 

The sight made me freeze for a second, wondering what the hell she was playing at.

I heard the boy ask her, "What do I do?"

"Just close the door," she explained, "and press the big red button."

It was only then I realized she was trying to bribe the kid into locking her inside the machine and switching it on.

"Mia!" I hissed, hurrying through the maze of machines to confront her.

"But what will it do?" The little boy asked her.

"I'll go on an exciting ride!"

I finally reached the door and grabbed it, putting an end to the madness. Both Mia and the kid looked annoyed, like I'd interrupted a great game of theirs.

"What did you think you were doing?" I snapped.

"It was just a little fun—right kiddo?"

The boy laughed as Mia tussled his hair before he finally scampered off back to his mother, who was still piling dirty underwear into the machine at the other end of the store, oblivious.

"Hey, just chill," Mia said, sensing my anger as she slid out of the machine. "He wasn't really going to do it."

I shook my head and walked away, knowing the kind of shit my own little brother would do for a few dollars.

Later that day, Mia's mom came out of her office to check on us and I thought about ratting Mia out right there and then, but the way she seemed to always dote on her strange daughter like the sun shone out of her ass made me pause.  

Why would she believe me over her own flesh and blood? After all, I hadn't even made my first paycheck yet and I really needed the money. That thought alone ultimately made me decide to just let it slide.

I didn't know how much I'd come to regret not bailing right there and then.

A few days later Mia and I were both working the evening shift. It was nearing closing time and the place was dead. I was just putting a damp sock in the 'lost and found' basket when she appeared at my shoulder and asked, "Do you like me?"

I frowned, and focused on the sock. "Yeah, of course."

I knew I'd over egged the lie as soon as it left my mouth, but I wanted to keep the job at least until college started. 

"Then why do you never look me in the eye?"

I forced myself to turn away from the basket and finally face her.

"What d'you mean?"

"Do you like me?"

Her face had a sudden seriousness to it. Whenever I'd seen her before she'd always had the ghost of a smile on her lips, and a playful look in her eye, but now she looked almost disappointed in me somehow.

My mouth felt dry as I croaked out a, "Yes." 

"Liar."

I felt my awkwardness switch to fear as she did that weird vibrating thing with her eyes again, only this time they seemed to pull mine in. It was like I had tunnel vision all of a sudden.

I tried to take a step back but my legs felt cut off from my brain. Instead, they followed her as she slowly walked backwards towards the row of machines lining the rear wall. 

Panic set in as I realized she was leading us straight towards The Beast. The playful look on her face returned as she sensed my fear.

"Don't worry," she said, her voice sounding like it was at the end of a tunnel. "It's just a little fun."

Her vibrating eyes never left mine as we reached the huge machine, she opened the door at her back and started to climb in. In my periphery, I saw her arms and legs contort in a nightmarish way. The whole time her head stayed fixed in space, her eyes now the centre of my universe. 

Once she'd crawled inside her voice called to me from the darkness of the drum.

"Close the door and switch it on. Wash cycle, max spin."

I felt powerless to obey. I watched as my arms closed the door and programmed the cycle. The panic inside of me rose, making me feel like I'd vomit if I still had control over my body. 

As my finger hovered over the 'start' switch I held onto one last sliver of hope. The cycle wouldn't start without money and I was fresh out of quarters. Yet as she ordered me to start the machine and the button clunked home and the door locked without any complaints, I realized she'd already preloaded the coins. The sick creep had planned this right from the start.

I heard the machine fill with water and felt tears spring into my eyes as I realized I was about to watch someone drown to death in the worst possible way. The drum part-filled to her chin but Mia never took her eyes off of me, not even as the machine started to spin.

I didn't know if it was the trance like state she'd put me in, or if her neck wasn't...*human*, but her head filled that thick glass door and never rotated an inch. I remember watching a nature documentary on birds of prey and how owls’ heads remain stable in flight to better track their prey, and Mia’s face reminded me of exactly that. Just this pale, big, black-eyed face staring back at me through the glass. 

She must have forced me to stand like that, watching her 'drown' for a good half hour because I remember the floor starting to shake as the machine hit its spin cycle. The drum whirled about her horrid face like an optical illusion, pulling me in and never letting me go until finally, the sudden surge of power caused the lights overhead to flicker.

My eyes lost sight of hers for a moment in the darkness, and I blinked for the first time in what felt like an eternity. The top halves of my eyeballs felt like dry gritted glass as they finally slid down on the tears collecting below.

Suddenly in control of my own body again, I flung a hand over my eyes and looked away. I heard Mia calling to me from the machine, trying to get me to look at her again but I wasn't falling for it.

My brain felt foggy and my legs felt drunk. For a split second I thought about trying to switch The Beast off before realizing it wouldn't work mid cycle, and it'd only release the true monster currently trapped inside of it. Whatever 'Mia' was, clearly wasn't human and I dreaded to think what she'd had planned for me next.

I remember half-running, half-stumbling past her mom's office door, praying it wouldn't open in case she tranced me too. Thankfully, I managed to stifle my sobs and it stayed shut, leaving me to slip out the laundromat door into the night. 

I never went back again. When my parents asked why I quit I told them I needed more time to focus on my studies instead, which seemed to shut them up. 

A couple of days ago, I finally mustered up the courage to look up the laundromat on Google Maps street view. 

I didn't know if I was hoping to see if the store had closed, or if anyone had left any bad reviews complaining about the creepy teenage girl that worked there, but I found neither. Instead, all I saw was what looked like another ad for hire in the window and the silhouette of a small woman with bleached blonde hair staring out the window. 

I didn't know if that was Mia, or just a bored customer, but I closed that browser window real quick. 

I'd hoped telling my story on here would somehow help me to process it, but now I've told it I don't really feel any better. I still can't use the dorm laundromat because every time I close the machine door I see her creepy owl-like face staring back at me.

I'm either hand-washing or buying new clothes these days, which is breaking my bank account. I think I need help. Maybe I should see someone?
