Me (19m) and friends (also 19m) got bored at a sleepover to the point where we had only YouTube autoplay to keep us awake until one of my friends chimed up. “Woah boys look what I found.” We me and my other friend looked over wondering if we finally had something to do at this sad sleep over. “I found a weed vape.” We’d never done this before so all of us were a bit hesitant before we just committed. Smoke filled the room the horrible taste of it filled our throats. “Bro this tastes like absolute shit!” We all agreed and put it back not thinking much about it and sat down to watch YouTube autoplay again. 

The effect of the weed hit like a bus each of us were laughing and struggling to move. I talked up first. “Thirsty, hungry.” I said like a zombie I knew they agreed by the look on their faces so we slumped into my friend’s kitchen and grabbed all the simple needs Water, chicken and coke. 

After we ate one of us said the dumbest thing ever  “Wanna camp up the mountain?” All of us not thinking straight nodded in agreement. So we went in the shed and grabbed a three man tent so we could all fit. 

We started hiking up the mountain each of us shitting ourselves thinking the tweets of the birds had been something. “Bro” said one of us “this is fucking terrifying!” But we kept on.

We’d had made it finally. We set up camp and sat down inside the tent and got some shuteye.

I woke up about 1-2 am and rolled over my friend was gone. 

I tried to wake up my other friend to ask for help looking for him but he wouldn’t budge.

So I opened the tents shitty window to look out to see if he was there but nothing absolutely no one at all.
So I started shouting his name for a few minutes until my vocal cords stung out of nowhere I heard his voice call back.

“H-hello” i heard from a few yards away from wherever my friend was.

I tried yet again to wake up the friend that was in the tent to come and help me look where the other friend’s voice was coming from because I am not the type to go looking in the dark by myself but yet again he didn’t wake. 

By now i was getting pissed “why did he leave the tent without telling us.” I said to myself. 

So I’d went back to shouting his name for name again “hello!” “Bro where are you!?” 

I head his voice in the distance again but sometimes was different.

“Hello guys” his voice said silently but now it was closer but I still couldn’t see anything at all.

And my friend isn’t the quiet type he’s a loud jock type of guy always making some kind of noise so this was quite new.

I heard something new this time meat crunching? Like if you feed a dog raw meat a sloppy sound.

Thats when I saw it “hello.” It said looking over the thing eating what was left of my friend his skin worn by it like some fucking coat. 

I felt like I couldn’t breathe properly I was scared out of my mind I tried waking my friend who was still in the tent with my even punching him but nothing.

The thing started crawling over to the tent i ran.

 “No, no, no,”. I unzipped the tent and ran out and didn’t stop running I couldn’t stop running I won’t stop running.

By now I’d had ran halfway down the mountain I knew both of my friends had been eating by that grotesque fucking beast so i wasn’t going back up to get anything I may had left. 

I got to the small nature made bride thats how I knew I was close to getting out of this hellish mountain I ran over it trying to get out luckily I did I had made it back into the neighbourhood I was safe.


“Hello.” 


I heard it behind me I didn’t know what to do besides look in awe and terror.

It was tall a fleshy thing the colour of its pulsating skin was about the the same colour of gums it was so disfigured it bones unnaturally it was wearing the skin of my friends like some sort of gimp suit. 

I ran back into my friend’s house he had gave me his house keys as a joke earlier in case I got scared and wanted to go back to the house.

I grabbed food to last me a week and went up in his attic the only place I thought it couldn’t go anywhere else.

After 2 days I left and went back to my home first thing I did was vomit in my toilet the thought of my friends being eaten by thats thing make me sick to my stomach.


I now stay in my house scared to leave. Scared it will eat me next.
