I'm a Freshman and it's almost the second marking period. I've gone to school every day this year, but something's always been off about this school. I always assumed there was someone pranking us when the bathroom mirrors were cracked, battered, and had messages written with condensation and handprints trailing down, but today the world seemed to stop. 

The windows show nothing but the darkness of the night, but 10 minutes ago it was noon. The lights started flickering and now they're out, and the beetles that infest the school have all disappeared. Someone in my class fell to the floor and we all thought it was a joke, until he didn't see him breathing. All our calls to 911 don't go through, and the doors to the outside won't open. Someone ended up jumping out the window, but disappeared before we could check if he landed safely. The principal is doing nothing, and we're screaming for help. I called my mom and she said she was on her way to the school, but then said never responded afterwards. 

We started to get hungry and luckily there was enough food to feed us for awhile. We also found out the power was on, just the lights were shattered. When we ventured to the office the found the principal dead on the floor with all the office ladies dead next to him. The bathroom mirror has been shattered as if something called out of it, and the one person who ventured by themself hasn't returned. Every now and then we hear scraping under the floorboards, and I'm scared something might pull me under. My one and only friend started crying blood before dying for god knows why, my brother disappeared into the darkness of the cafeteria and we're planning on sleeping in the auditorium. 

We tried to be positive and have some kind of dance in the gym, but a ton of people died of heart attacks. There are only 52 kids left when we had 257 earlier today. 205 kids are missing or dead. I wish I hadn't have come to school today. Our phones starting running low on battery so bunkered down in a classroom where luckily no one died, but something almost broke down the door. If only I had payed attention to the clues that this would happen. 

Earlier this year Someone killed a girl in the 400 Hall bathroom with a knife. That person was me. She made fun of me all of last year and I had to reenact my avenge. I thought I would finally be free, but I'd never be free. I know it's her, I know she senses me, I know she senses my fear. She feeds off fear. She told us when she's do it, but we all ignored her, know it's her revenge. As we sit here in this empty classroom full of textbooks no one's opened, waiting to be killed like pigs at the butchers. But I know she won't allow me such mercy.
