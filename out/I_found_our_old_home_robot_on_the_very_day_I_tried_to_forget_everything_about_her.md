She's been gone for two years. Most of her stuff was boxed up quite long ago, but yesterday - while I was digging through the hall closet to replace a dead light-bulb, I found our "ballie".   
  
A tiny, telepresence robot shaped like a white ball on wheels, ballie had kept us connected during the worst of distance. Late-night check-ins, rolling into frame to say good morning, glitchy video calls that somehow made it feel like she was right there with me. Long distance was very hard, but ballie made it easier. It made *us* stronger.

She died in a car accident. I don’t like to remember much else. 

Finding it should’ve been nothing.. just another thing to throw away or donate. It was wedged behind an old box of clothes, scuffed up and still dusty from the move. For some reason, I sat there on the floor with it in my lap for a long time.  
  
I couldn’t remember the last time we used it, or why I hadn’t just gotten rid of it after her funeral.

I checked the battery hatch on instinct. All empty. I didn’t know what I expected.. that it might power up and chirp her name, or replay some forgotten message she’d left behind. Maybe that it would feel like her again, just for a second.

I put in fresh batteries. Nothing happened. 

Some part of me was relieved. I left it in the corner of the living room, by the bookshelf, facing the wall.

I didn’t mean to keep it. I just didn’t throw it out.

That night, I couldn’t sleep - it was not just an ordinary day. A special day, it could have been, had she been here with me.  
  
The house felt heavier than usual. I kept thinking about her.. not the good parts. Not the laugh or the smell of her hair. Just the crash. The sirens. The finality. I didn’t remember the anniversary until I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, eyes welled with tears and the room bathed in the gray, dim light of everything.

It would’ve been 3 years today.

Sometime around 2 AM, I heard something moving. A soft yet glitchy mechanical whirr. Something rolling across the wooden floor, possibly in the living room of my apartment.

I sat up, heart in my throat. It was dark, but I could hear some chaotic movement in the silence of it all. I left bed to walk through the corridor, the whirring getting closer. I had to reach the end of the passage to switch on the lights. 

Just then, something caught under my foot and I fell flat to my face. I was already troubled and the dry eyes from me crying in bed made it really hard for me to see anything clearly.

I lay on the ground for a while. My nose hurt. I could feel a cold stream of blood flow from my nostrils, meeting my lip. My tongue could taste the metallic, salty taste it had mixed with the tears from my eyes.

The whirr seemed to zoom past. I then heard something hit a corner again and again.  
  
I sat up, gasping, hand pressed to my face, and saw it. A dim, orangish-red light in the corner of the living room. Ballie was there, by the wall. The fresh batteries I had put in, perhaps they were already dying.

I couldn’t believe my eyes.

I crawled forward on my knees, dazed, vision blurred. The light beneath its lens flickered violently now, painting the floor in dull red pulses. Its speaker hissed and popped, the air thick with low static.

Then, in a voice that wasn’t hers but *wanted* to be.. it said:

*"Don... et me b… gon-."*

*"Don’t let me… b… goneee…"*

Glitched. Broken. Robotic.

Again. Louder.

*"Don’t… let… me… be… gone!"*

The red light throbbed with each word, and Ballie jittered slightly, its wheels twitching like it was straining to move, or hold something back. The tiny screen on its front once used for calls flickered to life.

Through the static and digital noise, I saw what looked like a face. Pale. Still. Almost featureless, but unmistakably hers or some corrupted echo of it trapped in black and white distortion, flickering in and out like a bad connection from a world that no longer exists.

And then it stopped moving. 

Just sat there, screen buzzing softly. Watching me, dying its death.

I stayed on the floor, nose still bleeding, my chest tight with something between fear and grief.. unable to crawl forward or back.

I don’t know what I brought back when I turned it on.

But it wasn’t her.
