I was 16 when I first learned guitar. I was really good at it. So good, in fact, that I began playing on street corners at Gainesville FL. I never made so much money before.... but there was a small issue. Well, I didn't tell any of these amazing donators that I wasn't homeless. I had a beard before I was even 15, my dad's side of the family are some hairy people. On top of that, I always wore tattered clothes that I got from the thrift store. I even created a fake stage name for myself.

The people that donated would tell me motivating things and hand me either money or food; both of which I'd just slide into my backpack. They'd try to give me a job or get me to come to their church, and I'd just entertain the conversation till it was over and they were gone.

Let's fast forward two years. I'm 18. I was now living in South Alabama. Throughout my Senior Year, I'd visit different college towns to play music under the guise of a homeless traveler. My favourite place was Andalusia, Alabama. It was always so warm and welcoming. People really loved me there, and I began developing friendships with everyone in the community... including some of the homeless folks.

My plan was flawless. I'd park my Truck at a Walmart 2 miles away. Then, I'd walk, with my Guitar and Backpack, all the way to a Dollar Tree and start playing music. The manager knew me well, at this point, and eventually I didn't have to ask for her permission to play there. I'd stay all weekend there playing my music, returning to my truck at the end of the day to go to sleep. Eventually the Summer Heat got the best of me, and I began sleeping in an abandoned house.

It was a nice house. There was no atrocious smell, the windows were all still there, and there wasn't that much dust as I recall. I always kept a rolled-up yoga mat in my bag, and eventually I started spending my weekends sleeping there.

One weekend, an Older Black Homeless Man approached me while I was playing music. He had a really chill vibe to him, and we started talking about Jimi Hendrix (that's the quickest way to get me Ramblin). I let my guard down and told him that I wasn't really homeless. He wasn't really bothered, but by this point a White Homeless Man started to approach. This guy looked considerably younger compared to the black man. He had snake bite studs on his bottom lip and really long chin hair. Tattoos all the way down his body.

As soon as White Dude approached the Homeless Black Man, he struck up a conversation with him. I sensed they probably knew each other, so I gave them some privacy while I went to get something to drink from the store. When I came back, the white dude was now glaring at me, while holding my guitar and attempting to play "Love is what I got" by Sublime. I said, "Let me show you something". He handed me the guitar back, I proceeded to start playing the guitar solo to the song, and that's when he snapped. "You're out here taking our money! That's fucked up! You're not homeless motherfucker".

The man was causing a scene. Me and the Black Homeless Man were doing our best to get him to calm down. I even offered to half it with him, to which he got even more angry and took off on his bicycle. The Black Homeless Man told me to pay him no mind. He said the dude probably had mental issues. The rest of the weekend carried through fine, and I never saw that guy for a few more weekends.

This happened on a Friday. I was late on packing up for the day. By the time I reached the abandoned house, it was dark, and I couldn't see very far ahead of me. I setup my mat, and I go straight to sleep.

I don't know what I was dreaming about, but I know what I woke up to. I heard someone whisper "He's just a kid". I immediately snapped my head up. I saw Snake Bite Stud Guy leaning right over my face. To my left, was the Black Homeless Man, and to my right, a Third Unknown Homeless Man (I don't remember anything about him). There was a small amount of Illumination coming from Snake Stud's phone light. "Tell me who you really are", Snake Stud leaned closer, "and don't lie to me". 

I explained that I was a boy who recently graduated High School, and I was only out here for some quick cash. Snake Stud pointed his light at the wall which revealed a spray-painted symbol of a circle with an "X" inside it. I definitely didn't see that last time I was in there. That must mean that these guys have been following me. What if they were in the building the whole time I was starting to sleep?

"This is our house" he said, "Go back to your truck, and get out of our town... or something bad's goanna happen to you". Snake Studd leaned back, took a couple steps to the side, and turned his phone light off. I couldn't see any of them now. I picked up my belongings and walked through the creaky front door. Tears are starting to run down my face as I start to process what just happened. Meanwhile, the Secadas outside are getting louder and louder.

I take one last look at the house, and of course, I can't see anyone though the pitch blackness behind the windows. I survived that ordeal, but now and then I start to think to myself, "What would've happened if I wasn't a young man?" What was their original intentions for me? Let this be cautionary to all young and aspiring musicians. If your ever on the street, and you're pretending to be homeless to get more money, you better watch your back, or The Hobos will watch it for you!
