Working the night shift wasn’t exactly part of the plan. After a nervous breakdown at my last job, I needed something quieter. Something far away from screaming bosses, impossible deadlines, and the kind of stress that turns your bones to dust.

Now I spend my nights at a tow company. I’ve got a car loan at 26% interest, a binder labeled “New Tuna” that contains everything I need to know about the job, and a list...one that some old guy left behind before he retired. I’m starting to think that list might be more important than I realized.

* **Rule 1**: Don’t answer calls after 3:00 a.m. (this we’ve already gone over)
* **Rule 2**: If you hear someone knocking at the dispatch window, don’t open it.
* **Rule 3**: Ignore the passenger in the back seat of a tow truck in the shop.
* **Rule 4**: Don’t assign any calls to “Driver 13.”
* **Rule 5**: If the GPS glitches to a blank screen, give PulsePoint a reboot.
* **Rule 6**: If somebody calls askin’ for a 1987 Chrysler New Yorker, just say NO and hang up. Don’t bother explainin’.
* **Rule 7**: If a customer mentions “the shadows,” transfer the call to an empty desk right away.
* **Rule 8**: Don’t send a driver to Route 9 durin’ a full moon.
* **Rule 9**: Always say goodbye at the end of each call, even if it’s dead silent.
* **Rule 10**: Don’t answer calls from your own number.
* **Rule 11**: If the lights flicker twice, step outta the room for five minutes.
* **Rule 12**: Never answer to somebody callin’ your name unless you see 'em.
* **Rule 13**: If you get a second call about the same accident, ignore it.
* **Rule 14**: If the office phone rings three times and stops, let it go.

The system we use is called PulsePoint. It tracks trucks via GPS, lets me assign calls, upload videos, and stream live footage from the field. Each truck is equipped with three cameras: a front-facing dashcam that shows the road, a cabin cam mounted inside to monitor the driver, and a rear camera bolted to the back of the truck. The official reason is for safety...to protect us during accidents or disputes.

Unofficially, I think Henry, or whoever really runs this operation, uses them to make sure the wheel lift drivers aren’t driving with their booms down.

The job is simple. A call comes in, I log the info, assign it to a driver, and monitor their progress. That’s it. No customers. No pressure. Just me, the screen, and whatever snacks I remember to bring.

The night started off normal. Tyler was working heavy duty, Mike was handling personal property impounds, and Damon was on call in case we got anything from PD.

Just after 3:00 a.m., the phone rang. The sound cut through the silence like a knife. The caller ID was blank. The numbers looked scrambled...not the kind of glitch you’d see from a bad connection. I stared for a second too long before picking up.

“Thank you for calling Henry's Runners and Wreckers. How can I help you?”

A woman’s voice came through. She was breathless. Frantic.

“Please. There’s been an accident. Route 19 just past Wells Hollow. My husband’s unconscious. He won’t wake up.”

That raised red flags immediately. We’re not police dispatch. PD usually calls us, not the other way around. But I was told in training that people sometimes call us directly if the wreck isn’t bad enough to need emergency services. So I stayed calm, slipped into routine. Got the location, logged the coordinates, and assigned it to Tyler since he was just four minutes away.

I tried to keep her talking. “Is he breathing? Are you hurt? Do you need help contacting police?”

“I already called them. They said they’re on the way. But someone needs to get the car out of here. It’s not safe.”

That phrasing didn’t sit right, but I didn’t argue. She added, “There was something in the road. He swerved. We hit the guardrail.”

Then her voice started to fade. The line went quiet, but I could still hear something. Faint breathing. Or something close to it.

“Ma’am?”

Click.

I checked PulsePoint. Tyler’s icon was moving toward the location. I was about to call the police myself to make sure she’d actually reported the accident when the dispatch phone rang again. Tyler this time.

“Hey, Rach? I’m here. There’s nothing. No car. No wreck. No people. Just road.”

I pulled up the front-facing dashcam. His headlights stretched into the dark. Nothing but pavement and trees. I switched to the rear camera.

Something was there.

Tall. Upright. Just beyond the glow of the taillights. It wasn’t moving. Not in a startled, deer-in-headlights way. It was standing still. Too still. Like it had been there long before Tyler arrived.

Like it had been waiting.

The darkness clung to it in a way that didn’t feel like a shadow. It was more like the light had refused to recognize it. Like the world was actively forgetting whatever it was. No features. No face. No eyes. Just a shape.

Still. Watching.

But it didn’t feel like it was watching the truck.

It felt like it was watching the camera.

Watching me.

Like it knew I was there. Like it had been aware of me long before I noticed it.

I swallowed hard. “Tyler... don’t get out. Can you check behind your truck? Just put it in reverse. Tell me what you see.”

He sounded confused, but did as I asked.

“It’s just trees back there. Why?”

I checked the cabin cam to make sure he was looking. He was.

I switched back to the rear feed.

The figure was gone.

The phone rang again. Same scrambled number. I picked up.

“Dispatch.”

“It’s me,” the woman said. Her voice was different now. Softer. Distant. “Are they coming?... Are you coming?”

I tried to stay calm. “Our driver is already there. But he can’t find you.”

“I see you,” she whispered. “He just doesn’t see us.”

Her words sent a chill through me.

“Stay on the line,” I said. “I’ll have him check again.”

I flipped back to Tyler.

“Can you drive up and down that stretch again? She swears she sees you.”

He sighed. “Sure. But there’s still nothing. It’s just empty.”

I watched his headlights sweep the road. No wreck. No body. Nothing.

Then the woman came back on the line. Like she had waited for me to return.

“He’s here with me now,” she whispered.

The line was too quiet.

“But he’s not breathing.”

My throat tightened. “Ma’am... who’s with you?”

A pause.

“I didn’t make it.”

The line went dead.

I stared at the screen. My hands hovered over the keyboard. Useless. I switched back to Tyler.

“I’ve looped around twice. Still nothing. Want me to keep looking?”

“No,” I said. “You’re clear. Head back in.”

“Copy that.”

I pulled up the CRM to check for that scrambled number. It had been logged before. There was only one note attached:

DO NOT ANSWER THIS CALL AFTER 3 A.M.

  
That morning, when the sky finally started to bleed gray and the weight of night began to lift, I found Carl out in the shop.

Carl was supposed to be retired. At least, that’s what the company email said. But there he was, leaning against the side of his former flatbed with coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other, staring at the concrete like he expected it to crack open beneath him.

I stepped in quietly. I was still shaken from the night before.

“You’re not gone yet?” I asked.

He didn’t look up. “Came to grab my last paycheck,” he muttered. “Left a couple things in the toolbox.”

He took a sip of coffee, then added, “Guys like me don’t really retire. We just fade out.”

I hovered in the doorway. The silence stretched too long between us. Eventually, I said it.

“I got an email the other day.”

He looked at me for the first time. His expression didn’t change. “You got it, then?”

I nodded. “That was you? It didn’t have a sender. Just a blank address. How did you do that?”

He didn’t answer. Just took another drag of his cigarette and turned his eyes toward the dispatch office.

Then he looked back at me and said, “You didn’t reboot after it blinked, did you?”

I stared. “What?”

“It’s not about the window,” he said. “Not really. The window’s just where they knock first.”

My stomach turned. “What’s going on, Carl? I need real answers. No riddles.”

He didn’t say anything. Just stared at me. It felt like he was trying to figure out whether I was ready to hear whatever it was he wasn’t saying.

I turned to leave. “You’re messing with me.”

“You spoke to her?” he asked.

I froze. Slowly, I turned back around. He didn’t have to explain who he meant. I nodded.

He didn’t react right away. Just stared past me. Then finally said, “I’ve heard that voice before.”

He lit another cigarette. This time, his hands were steady, but his voice was low and drained.

“It was almost forty years ago. I was new. My dad was retiring, showing me how to handle the flatbed. We got a call from PD. A car had gone off Route 19 near Hollow. They said it was mangled, needed a flatbed. We pulled up before sunrise. The cops were already there. Their lights were spinning through the trees.”

He paused.

“But there was no one in the car. Just blood. Driver’s side. Passenger side. Smeared across the windshield. But no bodies. No footprints. No drag marks. Just a warm car and empty seats.”

I didn’t say anything.

“We waited while the cops searched the woods,” Carl continued. “Felt like hours before they gave up and told us to haul it.”

He stared off at the far wall like he could still see it.

“They never found anyone. Not that night. Not ever. But that’s not what sticks.”

I waited.

“What sticks,” he said, flicking his ash onto the floor, “is that the calls never stopped. Always the same time. Always the same woman. Always a number that doesn’t look right.”

His face had changed. The fear he’d been trying to hide was starting to show.

“She cries. Says her husband isn’t breathing. Begs for help.”

He dropped the cigarette and crushed it under his boot.

“She doesn’t know she’s dead,” he said. “She still thinks someone can save her.”

My voice was barely audible. “Why didn’t you tell me?”

He laughed once, dry and empty. “Because once you answer, it’s already too late. That’s how she finds you. Not through the crash. Through the phone. Through whoever picks up.”

He stood slowly and brushed ash from his jeans.

“You can try to forget. Think you’ll stop hearing her voice. Think the silence won’t follow you into your dreams. But it will.”

He looked back toward the dispatch office. The monitors behind the blinds were still glowing, casting a faint white light across the floor.

“She knows who hears her,” he said. “And she remembers every single one.”

I took a small step toward him. My breath was shaking. My eyes searched his face for something solid. Something I didn’t want to find.

“When did you hear her first?”

He didn’t answer.

I swallowed. “When did you hear her last?”

There was a long pause.

Tom walked in. “Carl,” he said. “Your check.”

Carl took it without a word.

Tom turned to me next. “You should probably be heading home,” he said, not meeting my eyes.

And just like that, the moment was gone.

Carl disappeared into the yard, envelope in hand. Tom went back inside.

I stayed where I was, alone again.

Wondering who would knock next.

Or what would answer if I did.
