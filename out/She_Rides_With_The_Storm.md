**It’s crazy, thinking about what happened. How so much has changed in eight years. All because of a woman, a woman who rides with a storm. She takes people, she takes them and no one knows where they end up. All anyone has is the small bit of information that she’s coming, or, if it’s too late, that she’s already there. Cloudy skies, warm drops of rain, interference with electronic devices and all animals in an area suddenly herding together and just start… watching you. Waiting. I’m alone now, more alone then I have ever been. I had my sister for a while but, she succumbed to the madness of our obsession with finding out what really happened that night.**

**Our mother was a strong, beautiful woman, she could do anything. She raised us by herself and even though she could be strict at times, there was never a time we thought she didn’t love us. She’s gone now too, taken. Taken by the woman… that** ***thing*** **that rides in the storm. Eight years of pain and suffering. Never forgiving and never forgetting. I can’t and no matter how many times I wish I could, but I won’t.** ***Never.***

**Eight years ago, I was maybe eighteen or nineteen. Hard to tell now, but I remember the coming days so, so very vividly. It’s like they’re imprinted on my mind, flashing through my head over and over again, playing like a film projected at the movie theater or a drive-in. Every little detail has stuck with me and I don’t think they’ll ever leave. It started with the animals acting weird. I came home from class to find a bunch of raccoons, cats and dogs just watching me from the end of our block. It was crazy.**

***I have to get a photo of this***\*\*, I thought, but when I pulled out my phone, they got aggressive and I raced into my house.\*\*

**I slammed the door shut, I was freaking out, but the adrenaline was amazing. My mom jumped up from her spot on the couch and asked me what happened. I told her about the animals, and how weird it was. If I’m being honest, I’m not so sure she believed me, but it was certainly a story to tell. I remember my nose beginning to bleed right after and that was strange because my mother’s did too and later so did my sister’s when she got home from work.**

**I think this is how we were marked. Chosen.**

**The next day, almost nothing in the house worked. The lights began flickering, outlets stopped working, our phones wouldn’t turn on and the TV’s would turn to static, giving my sister a good scare. At the time, I thought that was so funny. My sister, Abigail, she used to try and scare me a lot when we were younger so I saw it as my** ***revenge***\*\*, if you could call it that. Over the next few days, we’d have rapid thunderstorms. It was loud, the raging cacophony pounded, it was almost deafening. The lightning though, it was almost as bright as the sun. Blinding.\*\*

**I decided to go on a walk during one of these storms, figured I could get a good picture of the sky. It started pouring almost immediately and I was forced back inside, recoiling with pain. The rain was burning hot. I still have the scar on my hand to prove it.**

 **My mom raced over, asking what happened. She was worried, I was scared and my sister was confused.**

**“The rain, it… it burned me!” the pain was searing.**

**You know the feeling you get when hand sanitizer seeps into a cut on your finger? Imagine that, but all over the back of your hand and you can smell burnt flesh. I could see parts of my hand bubbling, it felt like acid. I quickly raced over to the kitchen sink to put it under cold water and I felt relief. The pain hadn’t stopped, but I no longer felt like my body was on fire. I was covered in sweat at this point. My mother handed me some burn ointment and then we wrapped my hand with bandages.**

**“Keep it clean,” she said. “We’ll check daily in case of infection.”**

**My mother was always so cautious, being the daughter of a doctor does that I guess. My sister asked me what happened and I told her what I had said before, that it was the rain. “Weird, must have something to do with global warming,” she said. I chuckled and agreed no clue what was going to happen next.** 

**The next day, our noses started bleeding again and our dog, Candy; she was beginning to act weird. This large, German shepherd was acting like a puppy. She was old, tired, hardly moving and loved being outside yet she was now acting like a small, overly attached puppy. She whimpered every time we tried to take her outside, she started pissing and shitting inside the house. It was just… odd to say the least. Abigail figured that it was probably getting close to when we’d have to put the old girl down but I didn’t wanna think about that. That dog was basically my best friend. Mom bought her when she was in college and as the family grew Candy had become our rock. The only one holding us together.**

**That’s why** ***she*** **used Candy to take my mother.**

**Candy has finally gotten back to her old self. Her really, old self. Candy had spent the entire day outside like normal so we didn’t realize that no one had let her in when it started raining. The sun had set and it got dark out. The storm was raging, thunder and lightning flashing and booming. It was like the wrath of God if ever there was one. We were watching TV, just waiting for the thing to turn off or go to static when mom looked over at the window and saw Candy staring at us from outside.**

**“Oh, my God, Candy,” she said.**

**My sister looked at me, we could have sworn someone had let her in hours earlier but now we weren’t so sure.**

**Mom grabbed her rain gear and headed towards the door. I asked if she wanted me to go with her, Abigail offered too but mom just said that she’d needed us inside. “Someone has to dry off the dog when she gets inside.”**

**She opened the side door and went outside. I tried turning on the porch light to make it easier to see, but it wouldn’t turn on. We decided to open the window and shine the flashlights from our phones outside. Suddenly, I got a weird feeling. The burn on my hand started to itch and I felt uneasy**\*\*\*.\*\*\*

***Must be the rain***\*\*, I thought.\*\*

**Then my sister and I realized that we couldn’t see Candy or our mom. That’s when we heard our mother scream. It was blood curdling, terrifying. Paralyzing. That’s when my burn started… burning. Pain shot through my entire body and I fell to the floor as Abigail raced towards the door, calling for mom. She was about to go outside when something slammed the window shut, drawing our attention towards it. That was when we saw it, saw her. The Woman.** 

**She was dressed in this black, Victorian style dress. She was old, her hair was patchy and her face, good God, her face, it was… it was horrifying. Decomposed, burnt with these long, dirty teeth exposed due to her lack of lips, one eye was a menacing, glowing yellow while the other was a white, milky bulb. Her skin was leathery, almost as outstretched as her smile. She reached out towards the window with a long, boney finger and tapped three times on the glass.**

**“Let me in,” she said. “Let me in.”**

**We couldn’t move. I couldn’t stand, the fear was mixing with the pain felt and heavy on my chest. My head began spin, my nose leaking blood. The last thing I can remember was seeing some type of spark from her finger, cracking the glass. In a flash of lightning, she was gone and I had lost consciousness.**

**I remember waking up a few times that night, only my eyes wouldn’t open and my body wouldn’t move. There was something heavy on top of me. Like someone was sitting on my chest, it was suffocating. When I woke up the next morning, it was to clear skies, but the day was gloomy as ever. I raced into the living room to find my sister on the couch, unmoving. I could see the crack in the window with burn marks around it's web-like form. I looked at my sister, deep down I knew that I knew the answer but I had to ask anyway. I just to hold onto the hope that the events of the last night had a dream. A nightmare.**

**“Abigail, where’s… where’s mo­­­—“**

**“You saw what happened, David,” she said. “Mom is… she’s gone.”**

**Tears welled up in her eyes as they began welling up in mine. For hours we cried together, just sitting in that one spot, not moving.** ***How could we?*** **After a while, I realized that Candy was missing too and after a bit of prying, my sister told me what happened after I had passed out.**

**She immediately began trying to help me. I wasn’t breathing, so she attempted CPR and after a few minutes, she had been able to revive me, she looked over at the window to see Candy in the middle of a giant herd of animals. She was with cats, other dogs, raccoons, birds, bears, roosters, chickens and even a lion. After another flash of lightning, they were gone too. The next few claps of thunder sounded like our mother screaming and this had sent her into hysterics, but all she could think about was helping me.**

**I always find myself thinking if I had died; if she hadn’t revived me, then, maybe there would’ve been time to for Abigail to save our mother.**

**We were alone now, we couldn’t say anything to anyone so, just like our mother, we disappeared from the face of the earth, taking all the time we could to find her.**

**We certainly found Candy though, part of her at least. All the animals were found dead in a field and we assumed the worst for mom, but we were not gonna stop looking so we looked and we looked. About three year later, everything fell apart. Abigail lost it, and I mean really lost it. It began raining one night, a harsh storm, no warnings, just a normal storm. She couldn’t take it, I tried my best to stop her but I just couldn’t. she ran off into the night, screaming for our mother, begging the woman to bring her back home. I still haven’t seen my sister since and my mother is still missing to this day.**

**My burn still gets itchy when it rains and I find myself hiding in a closet like a terrified child until it’s over. It’s like my mark is a warning. Telling me to hide before I get taken next or succumb to madness like Abigail.**

**Honestly, it’s enough to make a man go crazy. I just want my family back…**
