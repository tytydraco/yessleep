[\[Part 6\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/170qsni/the_road_to_new_wilderness_part_6/)

The cafeteria of the New Wilderness visitor center hummed with the low roar of breakfast rush-hour. Cutlery clinked, voices mumbled in two-dozen separate conversations, and chairs scraped on the tile floor as people came and went. Pots and pans banged loudly behind the nearby kitchen doors, from which floated the heady aroma of cooking food. Outside the nearby windows, the sun barely crested the perimeter wall, sending soft golden rays into the room, and the cold plastic of the chair stuck to my bare calves.  
“Here.”  
I looked up from my almost empty plate to find Jamie pushing her little yellow square of cornbread my way. “You don’t want it?”  
She threw me a conspiratorial wink. “Gotta ease you into the insurgent life. Besides, I know where we can get better stuff. But you still don’t want to skip your breakfast ration.”  
My first morning at New Wilderness had been a long one so far. Jamie let me sleep in for an extra two hours past the standard wakeup, but I still woke up exhausted. Upon reaching the visitor center where breakfast was served, I’d been confronted with a harsh reality; my days of generous breakfasts with mounds of gooey pancakes and crispy bacon were long gone. With a little over 300 people living inside the fort walls, food was strictly rationed, and everyone but the night rangers had to be up at 5:30 to start the day. Power to lights, air conditioning, and wall outlets was cut off from most buildings during the daytime to conserve power, and already I could see the humidity fogging on the cafeteria windows. My meager ration of one fried bison patty, one square of cornbread, and a serving of stewed beans seemed to disappear all too quickly, and I fought pangs of homesickness at the thought of dad’s legendary grilling skills.  
*He and mom are probably worried sick right now.*  
Crunching down the buttery cornbread, I pushed the feelings away, and smiled at Jamie in between bites. “Thanks. So, what are we doing today?”  
Jamie drained her glass and nodded toward a dry-erase board on the far wall gridded off with tape, names and instructions written in each box. “Every day, you check the work roster. It’ll show where you are for the next week or so, but sometimes things change. Just because you’re a ranger doesn’t mean you won’t get crappy jobs, especially for things like wall repair, or mending pasture fence. Besides, if you work during the day, they won’t schedule you for a night op unless it’s a dire emergency. Sean makes the roster every week, and updates it daily, so if you’ve got a problem, take it up with him.”  
We turned in our trays and trudged out into the rising heat of the day, the humid air already sticky on my skin. Thankfully, we didn’t have to wear the uniform shirts unless on patrol, so Jamie and I both sported cotton t-shirts, and loose athletic shorts that made the temperature much more bearable. Jamie left her AK in our room, but still wore her pistol belt everywhere she went, and I felt somewhat out of place walking around empty handed.  
Turning left to head back toward the lodge, Jaime pointed things out as we went, daylight bringing the fort to life. “Just about every building has living spaces in it, so always knock whenever you go anywhere. Rangers have the lodge, mechanical garage, and armory; workers get the campsite and cabins. Researchers stay on the other end, in the clinic and animal buildings.”  
We looped through a narrow asphalt driveway that cut between two rows of square, gray-painted cabins, where people moved to and fro-going about their work. Some of these also carried guns, but they seemed to be more older people, pregnant women, and younger children. Groups hacked weeds from the gardens that occupied nearly every available space between the residential buildings, including several large plots outside the row of houses. Others headed off toward the signs leading to the animal barns, or toward the front gate to work in the larger fields and pastures that ringed the fort. Even from inside the walls, I could smell the starchy green corn fields in the morning breeze, and there were neat lines of beans, pumpkins, potatoes, carrots, and onions all up and down the little roadway. Small wire coops with little flocks of chickens dotted every backyard, and occasionally I spotted a roving dog or cat prowling for rodents among the crops, though there were far less than I’d expected to see. An old woman busily milked a tan-and-white speckled cow by hand right next to the roadway, and four young boys ran in circles to herd a stray piglet that had escaped a backyard pen. Despite the modern clothes, weapons, and asphalt, it felt more like stepping back in time than the world I knew. No one held a cell phone, no lawnmowers roared, every child of all ages seemed to be outside, and the people threw themselves into their work with backs bent in the wavy glare of the morning sunshine.  
A group of what looked like junior-high age girls watched us go from where they sat on a porch step, mending clothes by hand with needle and thread, and whispered to each other, pointing at me.  
Unnerved, I stuck closer to Jamie, and avoided their gaze.  
*You’d think I was wearing a sign or something.*  
“Rumors spread fast.” Jamie cut through a side path in one yard, and led me out toward a larger, open area. “It’s a small community, and everyone knows when a newbie comes in. They always have eyes the size of watermelons when they see this place.”  
Stepping out from the housing row, I almost let my jaw drop.  
A long building made from cinder blocks sat to my left, with the words ‘Shower house’ painted over the two doorways, one with a male stick figure on the door, the other a female. A laundromat stood on the opposite side of the building, and not far from the shower house sat a campsite ringed with half a dozen campers and vehicles. But those weren’t what caught my attention.  
Dozens of big tents were pitched in a circle about 50 yards square, and a small crowd moved amongst them, voices calling out and chattering on the morning breeze, along with savory smells that made my stomach rumble.  
Her grin at my expression bordered on the giddy, and Jamie waved me on, plunging into the morass. “Welcome to the market. Come on, let’s see if the kabob stand is open.”  
*Kabobs?*  
My mouth watered at the aroma of cooking meat hanging in the air, and I followed, slipping through the various groups of people to let my curious eyes wander.  
It seemed you could buy almost anything here, each tent bearing a table in front of it for goods exchange, often with more hung on wooden racks behind them. One woman sat behind a loom in her tent, weaving gorgeous bits of colorful cloth, which two more women stitched into dresses, blouses, and pants to hang up for display. Another stall held a grizzled old man surrounded by cages, filled with various rabbits, birds, and even strange beasts like salamanders with three sets of legs, and turtles with glowing purple spikes on their shells. A burly man in a shed beat red-hot metal into shape with a hammer and anvil, his forge roaring with flames in the background, the *tink, tink, tink* of hammer-stokes almost rhythmic in its effort. Handmade garden tools adorned his merchandise table, shovels, hoes, axes, and several things that I only recognized from a few times I’d been to country-themed restaurants in the big-city. Other vendors hawked their wares to passers-by like something out of a medieval village, calling to me with warm smiles and sing-song voices.  
“Shoe repair, any size, any make!”  
“New gardening tools, pre-sharpened!”  
“Herbal medicine! Cure headaches, nausea, and bug-bites!”  
*If only mom could see all this. She’d spend a fortune here.*  
Not bothering to hide my amazement, I jogged after Jamie, wishing I had my camera. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.  
I found her standing by an open-sided tent, occupied by two round-faced women in aprons who worked a big stove made from patched-together sheets of scrap metal. An old green chalkboard hung from one of the tent poles, with prices scratched in neat white lines. Heavenly smells of baking bread, frying meat, and spicy stew hit my nose, and already a line was forming behind me.  
“You like fish?” Jamie called above the din, as she dug into a pouch on her belt.  
My face flushed hot, as I realized I didn’t have any money, my empty wallet back in our room. “You don’t have to—”  
“Two fish kabobs.” Jamie arched her hand over the table in front of the stall and proceeded to drop fourteen shiny little cartridges into a round plastic jar at the end of the table. This jar had many such rounds in it, tiny as a pencil in diameter, and no coins or paper dollars that I could see.  
Confused, I watched as one of the women speared several golden-brown chunks of meat onto two wooden skewers before wrapping them in flat dry corn leaves.  
“Here you are, darlin.” The woman beamed and waved the next person behind us forward. “I can help whoever’s next.”  
I waited until we were a few yards away to start in on my kabob, the delicious fish tender and juicy with a slightly peppery flavor. “Wow, thank you. I thought food was being rationed?”  
At my words, several people snapped their heads around to glare at me, as if I’d screamed some kind of horrible slur at the top of my lungs. The fish stuck in my throat, and I fought a nervous tingle in my spine.  
*What did I do now?*  
Jamie took me by the arm and gently, though with enough urgency to make me understand, guided me away from the numerous angry stares. “Don’t say stuff like that in the market, okay? This is Worker territory, and people here get really upset if they think the old rationing system is going to come back.”  
She stopped in between some tents, where there were less prying eyes, and went back to devouring her own kabob in gusto.  
Frustrated at having caused a scene only a few hours into my first day, I nibbled at my fish, and glanced over my shoulder in unease. “I don’t get it. What old system?”  
Jamie paused to lick at the grease on her fingers, already halfway finished with her food. “Basically, food from the fields and pastures outside the walls is part of the communal ration fund. Like our corn fields, the bison herd, that sort of thing. Everything in the market is stuff people went out and got on their own or grew in their own gardens. Part of Sean’s market reforms.”  
I looked down at the fish in my hands, still confused. “Reforms?”  
She finished her kabob and tossed the leftover skewer and greasy corn leaf into a nearby metal drum that seemed to be set up for such reasons. “It’s kind of a long story. Come on, we’ve got to get you to the armory to meet Andrew. I’ll explain on the way.”  
Scarfing down more of my food, I tagged along, grateful to get further from the earshot of others. We crossed back toward the visitor’s center, where people passed us back and forth on the paths on their way to whatever jobs they had for the day. It amazed me how, in the daylight, this place seemed so much bigger, with so many people crammed into it.  
Another building caught my eye further to our left, tucked against the perimeter wall. It had a strange, almost makeshift roof built over it, and the walls looked discolored in places. No one moved in or out of it, and where the front door should have been, there was only a yawning dark hole.  
“What’s that?” I craned my neck to see it better.  
Jamie stiffened, her eyes regarding the dilapidated little building with something like pain in the emerald irises. “It’s the old check in building. Our first commander, Randy, had his office in there.”  
The fish turned over in my stomach at her response, and I tried to think of a sensitive way to ask her more. “So . . . was there a fire?”  
“You could say that.” Jamie snorted, an angry, almost bitter expression on her face. “It was the first and only time ELSAR tried to hit us from the air. Two helicopters came in one morning and dropped rocket on us. Both hit the check in building. Carter’s militia scrounged some anti-air rocket launchers from a convoy we’d ambushed days before, and they fought the choppers off, but not before the building collapsed. Randy and three others died in there. We built a roof over it and left it as a memorial for all the people we’ve lost so far.”  
Kicking at a loose pebble in the gravel path, she cast a glance around, as if to ensure there weren’t others nearby. “Carter took over as commander after that and tried to run things like back in his military days. Everything was handed over to the administration, everyone worked every kind of job, and he had absolute authority. When he decided to attack what he thought was a weapons convoy near the town of [Collingswood,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14h920e/i_survived_the_collingswood_massacre/) no one could speak against him, even when Carter’s plan called for us to herd mutants right into them like they’d done to us.”  
A few workers walked by, and Jamie stopped talking until they left, her suspicious glances making the hairs on my neck stand on end.  
“Turns out, it was a humanitarian mission to bring food, meds, and water in for the municipal government. The mutants got out of control and attacked the town instead. ELSAR had to drop bombs in order to stop the stampede. We lost 26 rangers that night, and Carter wouldn’t let us try to rescue anyone out of the flames. Collingswood burned, with all its 5,000 people.”  
*Mother of God.*  
I blinked at her, unable to speak. A whole town, destroyed? How? It didn’t seem possible . . . but yet I knew that in this place, anything was possible.  
She sighed and tugged at the belt on her waist to adjust it. “We tried to keep going, but Carter’s system meant no one could forage for extra supplies without his permission. Even if they did, it would be confiscated for the central fund anyway. Food began to run out because no one wanted to risk their lives only to have their stuff taken from them, and when we caught people hording rations, Carter ordered us to shoot them.”  
My feet stopped before I could think to, and I almost fell over in shock. “Wait . . . *us?*”  
Jamie cringed in a shame that rivaled the way she’d looked during the story about her brother. “Yeah. At first, I supported Carter, even when he started the crackdowns, because I thought it was the only way to survive. I wanted Bill’s death to mean something, even if I had to follow someone I didn’t always agree with.”  
I searched her face, noted the way Jamie avoided my gaze, and swallowed hard. “So, what did you do?”  
“I managed to avoid firing squad duty for a while.” Jamie stirred the rocks with the toe of her boot, her tone low and morose. “But I still helped with arrests. I was scared they’d turn on me if I refused. All that changed when they dragged one of my friends to the firing line and ordered me to shoot. I couldn’t bring myself to pull the trigger, so they put me against the wall with him. Luck was on our side though. Sean had secretly gotten a bunch of rangers, workers, and researchers together to force a vote on New Wilderness leadership. They marched on the armory at the last second, and Carter’s men refused to fire on them. Turns out they were tired of starving too.”  
We started up the road between the animal enclosures, and Jamie pulled a steel canteen from her belt to unscrew its cap. “Sean was voted in as acting commander in a landslide. He passed reforms that made the Assembly a permanent part of the park’s government, and changed how we handled supplies and job positions. We still have communal fields and livestock for now, since we don’t have a lot of that to go around, but people can have their own small gardens and animal pens around the living quarters, and whatever they can scrounge from outside the walls is theirs to keep. Only .22 cartridges can be traded as currency, since we need the rest for fighting, and those who bring stuff in from the outside have to contribute a small amount toward the kitchens as a tax. Everyone works, but you can change factions whenever you want to, as long as you still pull your weight. It’s not completely free, I know, but its way better than Carter’s system . . . and we haven’t had to shoot anyone since.”  
Mind spinning, I accepted the canteen when Jamie held it out for me and gulped down the cold water. “Jeez. So that’s why he was angry with Sean last night?”  
“Exactly.” Jamie rubbed at her left hip bone as if the belt chafed without proper trousers to hold it in place. “Sean made it so that the commander has to get votes from two of the three officials who lead each voting faction to take action on things, and each faction leader can be voted out by the Assembly. Dr. O’Brian leads the Researchers, Ethan Sanderson leads the Workers, and Rodney Carter leads the Rangers.”  
“Carter?” I stammered and looked around to be sure no one else was close enough to get angry at my words. “But . . . I thought the whole uprising thing was to get rid of him.”  
“And we barely did it without a full-blown civil war.” Her eyes took on a jaded gleam, as if Jamie were reliving a day without sun or warmth. “It was Sean’s way to keep the peace with Carter’s supporters and prevent anyone trying to get revenge. But Carter thinks his centralized system can work now that our numbers are fewer, and he's been a thorn in Sean’s side ever since the emergency election. Ethan on the other hand is one of Sean’s best supporters, but he wants to go back to the freedoms we had before the Breach, where everyone has their own land outside the walls without communal rationing. Dr. O’Brian wants to keep things the way they are, but she also wants to ban mutant hunting, so her teams can study them better, which would keep us from clearing out more farms for food production. To make it worse, not everyone in each faction votes along their group lines. Some researchers vote ranger, some rangers vote worker, and some workers vote researcher. Everyone wants something, and since the Assembly meets once a month to discuss and debate, people get nasty.”  
Remembering how hateful people were about politics the few times I’d been on social media, I let out a slow breath of unease. “So, that’s why you didn’t want me to say anything back there?”  
Jamie grinned, a rueful, tired smile. “Uh huh. Our first ever general elections are in a few weeks, and this whole place is a powder-keg because of it. Sean’s doing his best to hold it all together, but the only person everybody listened to was Randy and . . . well . . . you know what happened there. Between the mutants, ESLAR, and our own squabbling, we’re lucky there’s anyone left in New Wilderness at—”  
*Crash.*  
I didn’t have time to respond, as the large metal fence to my right exploded, the pipes rending, the wire shredding. A massive gray shape barreled out of the hole and flung its head to free itself from the tangled ball of mutilated steel mesh. Dust rose in a cloud from its tramping feet, and tremors shuddered through the ground at every step it took, two thick pointed horns on its square nose. Both ears of the creature were laid back on its long, broad head, and two dark brown eyes regarded me with wild distrust.  
*Oh man.*  
The breath stuck in my chest, and Jamie froze, her eyes wide.  
“Don’t. Move.” Her hand snaked toward the brown flap on her pistol holster.  
I’d seen a rhinoceros once before at the zoo in Louisville, but they’d always been napping, or walking lazily around their feed troughs. This one snorted and pawed at the dirt, shouts from the background growing as more people ran toward the animal. Something had to be wrong with it for the creature to just shove through a reinforced fence line, and it took every ounce of willpower I had not to turn tail and run.  
Between my fingers, the greasy remnants of my kabob slid out of my grasp and hit the gravel with a soft *thump*.  
Its big head swiveled my way, and the rhino let out a low rumble.  
Jamie whipped the handgun from her belt, and in a split second, the rhino charged, its footfalls shaking the ground, the massive front horn pointed right at my chest.
