I shut the trunk and immediately started my drive back to New York. I drove as fast as I could and rushed to my apartment the moment I reached the city. When I opened the door to Luke’s room, I heaved a huge sigh of relief to see him with Jennifer who was helping him with his lessons.

I sank into a couch in the hall, teetering almost on the verge of a breakdown.

I think Jennifer somehow realized my state of mind and excused herself before leaving for her apartment. She also goaded Luke into coming and sitting next to his dad. The kid came and sat beside me, wrapping his arms around me and resting his head on my chest.

An overwhelming avalanche of guilt engulfed me, as I sat there thinking about my friend Eric, while also experiencing a feeling of intense relief, upon seeing that my son was safe.

Luke recalled me waking him up in the middle of the night, but he dismissed it as a dream, as he eventually woke up in his own bed. He then pointed his hand at a sealed envelope placed on the center table, just a couple of feet away from us.

When I picked the envelope, I noticed the wax seal had a trident symbol embossed on it. I ripped it open and took out the letter. It read -

WE HAD A DEAL

GET BACK TO YOUR REGULAR LIFE

DON’T WORRY ABOUT THE COPS

 

A simmering rage gradually took hold within me. I wanted to get up and break every item in my apartment. Luke’s embrace was the only comforting antidote that prevented me from releasing all that pent-up frustration.

So I simply closed the letter and proceeded to get along with my daily chores. I showered, brought groceries, cooked, cleaned and then took Luke out for soccer practice. We were back home by 6 and I got about getting ready for my next appointment.

Once I was dressed, I simply sat in the living room, looking at the phone placed on the table, waiting for it to go off. And at 7:00 PM sharp I got the coordinates for my next pick up.

I got off the couch, headed to my liquor cabinet, and pulled out a full bottle of bourbon.

After taking a big swig from it, I sat in the car and tossed the bottle onto the adjacent seat.

As the engine purred to life, I hit the streets and got ready to pick up my new passenger for the night.

The person I was supposed to ride with for tonight turned out to be Gandhi. When I arrived at the designated spot, I saw him dressed in a traditional loincloth with a shawl wrapped around his torso. Gandhi placed his walking stick on his lap after settling into his seat, and remained nonchalant as he observed me take another swig of bourbon.

I pressed the gas pedal as soon as he closed the door, and started driving toward the drop point. When I eventually slowed the car down at a signal, I saw a patrol car parked along the sidewalk. For some inexplicable reason, their presence immediately reminded me of the sealed envelope.

 I then lowered my window and hollered at the officers seated inside the car, and they waved back in acknowledgment.

I took two large gulps of bourbon in front of them, but I was a little taken aback when they ignored me even though my car was a mere 10 feet away from theirs. Next, I dangled my entire arm outside the window and started pouring the alcohol onto the street.

When even that went ignored, I banged the bottle against the car’s door continuing to empty its contents onto the road as I kept staring at the cops with a smile on my face. I became livid when the officers simply smiled back at me and then continued their own private conversation.

In a fit of anger, I got down from the car and threw the bottle at their vehicle, where it hit the bonnet and shattered to the ground, finally managing to grab their complete attention.

However, I stood there in stunned silence when I saw the cops searching for the culprit in every possible direction except mine, while I was simply standing a mere 3 feet away from them.

The officer pushed me away and continued to search for the perpetrator. They looked ahead, they looked back and then at the sides, even underneath the car. When nothing made sense, they glanced at the upper floors of the nearby buildings to check for potential mischief makers.

The officer then went on to even ask me why I was staring at them, and ordered me to get back to my car. During this entire episode, Gandhi sat in silence in the back seat, his face betraying no emotion or acknowledgment.

And then the signal turned green, giving me the go ahead to keep driving straight as per the GPS system, I instead took a sharp right turn and started going off course from the required destination. I pressed the pedal as the car quickly began to pick up speed.

50 mph

70 mph

80 mph

I swerved dangerously every now and then, to avoid colliding into other cars even though I knew I had a passenger I was responsible for in the back seat.

‘I mean he is not exactly a citizen of the year is he?’ I thought to myself, as I continued to live on the edge. He might be dressed as a great man, but he wasn’t him. He didn’t even look Indian. He looked more Asian, maybe Japanese and was younger too, probably early fifties.

And then Gandhi spoke for the first time since the entire trip.

“Perhaps, it is better not to test your luck against someone who is very good at breaking down people slowly”, he said, in a calm and detached voice.

In that moment, I felt the anger in me dissipate, and I couldn’t understand why. But I knew he was right. Things could get even worse than what they were now. I slowed the car down to a stop and turned back to look at him.

He had his sight fixed on the window, looking outside and lost in thought, although he seemed very much aware of his surroundings.

“What on earth is going on here?” I asked him, feeling helpless and unable to keep the bitterness away from my voice. “What sort of madness is this?”

Japanese Gandhi continued to observe the vehicles passing by without offering an immediate answer.

“Please drive”, he said moments later, and that was all he would offer.

I sighed deeply and turned around in my seat feeling disappointed. I started the car and slowly got back on the correct route.

Once we reached the location, I saw a fair number of people assembled at a square, which was odd considering it was late, and night had already fallen. There was also a small crew of people holding cameras reporting from the scene.

I removed the ticket from the GPS screen and threw it outside. I then dug into my shirt pocket and removed all the other tickets I had collected so far and threw them out as well. They quickly submerged from view as people walked over them, blending into the activity at the square.

As the reporters clicked away at their cameras, I for a moment wondered what would happen if I suddenly jumped out of the car right now butt naked holding a machine gun? Would the crowd only notice me and not the gun I was holding in my hand? Will I continue to have the same kind of selective invisibility that I had a few minutes back?’

While these bizarre thoughts lingered in my head,  Japanese Gandhi meanwhile had already stepped out of the car and slowly strode towards the square, holding his walking stick at hip level, treating it like it were a samurai sword.

As I began turning my car around the block to head back home, I observed him shift his grip on the stick, raising it horizontally to chest height, and then pulled at it, to unsheathe what appeared to be a long sword.

 I no longer felt any interest in watching the event, except sadness for what would follow shortly.  Before navigating the corner, I glanced at my rear view mirror one last time, and saw Gandhi had his sword raised above his head like a warrior, and charged into a group of people protesting peacefully over gun violence. I could tell my mind was simply numb and already getting accustomed to the violence. I simply drove back in silence.

Once I was back home a few hours later, I realized Luke had already gone to sleep. I felt a profound gratitude towards Jennifer for watching over him during my work hours.

When I finally entered my room and turned on the light, I found all the discarded golden tickets lying on my bedside table. They had somehow mysteriously found their way back into the house.

Frankly, I wasn’t surprised anymore, nor did I have any fuel left to feel another round of emotions for the day. I lay down on my bed and fell fast asleep.

 Over the next few days, I chauffeured all sorts of clients.  There was a woman who was dressed like a bird with large wings attached to her back. I drove her round New York for two hours where we would stop at various places to feed pigeons and she would even sing for them.

Though not a very skilled singer, she sang from the heart, and the tears flowed freely down her cheeks while the birds flocked around her. As her voice reverberated through the air, the pigeons quietly ate from her palm and flew away only when she finished singing.

When we finally stopped by the Brooklyn Bridge, she walked towards the railing and climbed on top of the ledge. For a moment, I feared she was going to jump, but the women simply strapped the wings to her forearms and stood on the ledge, with outstretched hands and began singing again.

A hoard of pigeons rushed towards her, but this time the birds looked angry. One pigeon perched on her forehead and plucked her eyes out, instantly blinding her, while the others pecked away at her body, causing her to scream in agony as she fell into the East River.

There was another case where I had to wait outside a hospital. A surgeon stepped out of the building still dressed in scrubs. As he approached me, he threw away his mask, gloves and even the shoes he was wearing, and climbed into the car barefoot.

We drove for many hours, well beyond the outskirts of the city to finally stop at a train station in a small town located in the middle of nowhere. He boarded one of the coaches of a goods train and simply lay on his back as the train began its departure. I could see a couple of scalpels jutting out of his pocket. God only knows the kind of havoc he was about to wreak in some remote corner of America.

Then there was a case where I dropped different people in the same farmland one at a time, over a period of five days. They dressed themselves as cowboy; a Red Indian, a confederate soldier and an African American slave respectively, while the last one turned up as a former US President.

Every time I arrived at the farm with a new passenger, I found the ones already assembled there huddled around a large bonfire. They sat in silence as they patiently waited for all members to arrive.  The moment George Washington set foot on the farm, the guns were out for what would be a duel to death.

I often woke up in middle of the night pondering what fate eventually befell the passengers who travelled in my car. I guess I could simply chalk it down to fear over my own wellbeing and whether I too might meet a similar end. I mean how long before one of these passengers see me as their target? Or what would happen to me once this month long gig was up? Would I become expendable and face the same grim fate as those I had driven?

So, I regularly scanned the news looking for any information available on my passengers. But going down that rabbit hole only unearthed more questions to which I had no answers.

In some cases, the people involved were apprehended and imprisoned. For instance, the clown was eventually caught and thrown into jail after being involved in more than half a dozen brawls around the city. But what made him quit his high profile attorney job in the UK and move here to the city in the first place? 

Then there were cases where the passengers didn’t even make it through the night. I learned from the news that the man with the sword was apprehended by the public and subjected to street justice, where one of the protestors disarmed him and used his own sword to drive it through his heart like a stake.

When the body of the woman dressed as a bird was recovered from the river, there were also separate news reports of pigeons dying of poisoning at multiple locations. 

I also learned from the news that the man dressed as batman was a stunt double in the film industry. The police were still following leads about a possible getaway driver from the scene, but eyewitness accounts so far proved to be contradictory and unsatisfactory.  Camera footages at the site also proved inconclusive.

The owner of a farmland called the police when he found bodies in his farm following his return from vacation. The police closed the case citing it as a ritual killing leading to the death of all four involved. But I was the only one who knew there was a fifth person at the scene. The Red Indian had obviously survived and he was in the wind now.  And so was the surgeon who boarded the train. I could not find any information about him.

As the days turned to weeks, I had become accustomed to any and all kind of unpredictability from my passengers. But I kept stacking up the tickets as time went by.

The initial anger that I had nursed in me, had died down by this point and I simply became numb and hollow from the inside. All I could think of was to get through with this ordeal and get back to my regular life. I still hoped that would be a possibility for me.

And the last day finally did arrive, where I would chauffeur my 30^(th) and hopefully last customer of this month-long nightmare. I was already sitting in my car with my eyes closed, holding my phone and it buzzed as usual at 7:00 PM. Once I figured out my new destination, I started the car and braced myself for a final ride wondering what was in store.

When I reached the Guggenheim museum, I could see a small crowd of people returning from a party. The attendees, a mix of men and women spanning various ages, were impeccably dressed in fashionable attire, and I wondered how I would be able to pick my passenger for the night.

Amidst the sea of faces, a young woman in a vibrant red dress caught my eye. An elegant pearl necklace adorned around her neck, capturing the subtle glow of streetlights, and her expressive eyes suggested a depth of mystery to her. Her artfully arranged hair added to her allure, and a ring on her finger, likely a ruby, added a touch of opulence to her already captivating presence.

I started the car and slowly drove to the point where she was standing. Our eyes met and she instantly broke into a warm smile.

"Hi Mathew," she said, gesturing at me to remain seated as she settled into the car, taking the seat next to mine. She retrieved a gold ticket from her clutch, placed it on the screen, and leaned back while launching into a smile again as she looked at me.

I gazed straight ahead, and started to drive without acknowledging her.

"Fine," she said, remaining unfazed by my stoic response as she began fixing her makeup. “We anyway have a long night ahead of us. You can take your time to get to know me if you want.”

“My name is Pamela by the way. And you can call me Pam, when you become increasingly fond of me” she added, giggling.

I ignored her comment and drove in silence for the next 20 minutes, but my heart slowly started to flutter again when I became increasingly familiar with the route I was on.

I realized we were driving straight back to Mr Devlin’s hotel.  As the navigation system beeped, I brought the car to a stop, and the new Trident Regency came into view, located just a few meters away.

When she saw the look of confusion on my face, Pamela quickly responded, “You are my date for tonight Mathew. Didn’t you know?” she asked with an air of innocence.

“No Ms Pamela. That can’t be right. I am only a chauffeur. This was my last day on the job,” I said, a little lost for words as I tried to process the unexpected turn of events.

Pamela flashed a mischievous smile and casually continued, "Well, Matt, then let's make your last day a memorable one, shall we?"

“Now get going. We can’t be late” she said, looking into a compact mirror while adjusting her hair even as I sat still in my seat.

“Come on Matt. Go and check your trunk!” she urged, a sense of urgency in her tone.

I immediately felt a lump form in my throat when I heard those words and it reminded of what happened at my friend Eric’s safe.

For a second, I instantly worried about my kid but I had been following along with all the rules. When I looked at Pamela, her expression was unreadable but I saw no malice in her.

I got down from the car and slowly approached the trunk uncertain of what awaited me. Upon opening it, I discovered a new tuxedo, neatly folded in packing paper.

Reluctantly, I tried it on and to my surprise, found it to be a perfect fit, even earning a nod of approval from Pamela herself.

She quickly leaned in closer to fix my hair at the sides, and then wrapped her arm around mine, causing me to flinch slightly.

“What is it, Matty? Haven’t you ever felt a woman’s touch before?” she asked, looking me in the eye with a mischievous glint in her voice.

Well, she’s not entirely wrong.

I haven’t been with another woman since Luke’s mother died at childbirth. Life got in the way I guess.  But I hardly doubt unsatiated lust as a factor is at play here, when compared to all the events that transpired over the last one month.

Observing me getting lost in my thoughts, Pamela gently nudged me in the ribs “hey don’t lose out on me Matt. The night is not going to be short on excitement. I promise.”

“Oh, I don’t doubt that," I said, nodding in acknowledgement.

“Excellent!” she replied excitedly, as the two of us climbed the stairs to enter through the doors of the Trident Regency.

This was my first time setting foot inside the hotel, and my initial impression was a dominance of the color red. My eyes immediately darted toward a sharp-looking Trident logo on the reception wall, while the expansive lobby boasted gleaming red Italian marbles, creating an atmosphere of sophistication and old-world charm.

Pamela directed me towards the elevator where a peculiar looking figure was already waiting. He sported a hat and a large trench coat, his face concealed by a mask and black goggles. He was standing with a file neatly tucked under his arm.

Once the elevator door opened, we all stepped inside. The display panel revealed that the building had around 50 floors in total. Well 51 actually, the top most floor had no number and was marked ‘D’.

I could see that floors 40 and above were restricted to the general public. Pamela utilized her ruby ring as a key, inserting it into a slot next to the display, and pressed 44. The masked man pressed 41, repeating the process with his own ring.

More and more people entered the lift as it ascended, bringing us all closer together. However, the higher it went, the quicker people vacated it, finally leaving only the 3 of us as we now entered the restricted zone. 

The man with the mask stood just inches in front of me. When his floor arrived, he stepped out, turned towards me and Pamela, and bowed once before heading off again.

My attention, though, was more focused on the narrow corridor I saw in front of him. It was filled with hundreds of people dressed just like him, their faces covered, with all of them holding onto a file. They were seated in a row of chairs that stretched farther than the eye could see. Before I knew it, the elevator door closed again.

‘Who are these people? What on earth is this place?’ I began to ask myself.

When the doors opened again, I was looking at a large hall with hundreds of people seated at tables busy playing cards. Pamela seized my arm, leading us into the hall, where the manager promptly escorted us to a pair of vacant seats at a table.

“"Where are we? What's going on?” I asked Pamela, bewildered by the situation.

“We're going to play a round of poker, Matt,” Pamela explained.

“But I don’t have any money,” I responded.

“We don’t use money here, Matt," she replied, and that was when I grasped it for the first time, noticing the gold tickets neatly stacked at every table.

“But I don’t have mine with me now,” I replied.

“Don’t be silly, Matt. What do you think that is?” Pamela asked, smiling and pointing to my right.

To my utter surprise, my stash of gold tickets had magically appeared out of nowhere and was resting on the table in front of me. I could already feel my head spinning, with beads of sweat forming on my forehead, even as we sat in an air conditioned room.

When I pulled out my pocket square from the tuxedo, a small slip of paper fell onto my lap. I picked it up and opened it."

The message read – ‘Don’t spend the tickets’.

The note also caught Pamela's attention as she grabbed it from my hand, and I saw her eyes widening in surprise as well.

Before she could utter another word, I abruptly stood up from my seat and dashed toward the hall's entrance.

Once inside the elevator, I started pressing the buttons for the lower floors, and realized the ring was needed for activation.

Pamela arrived at the elevator entrance with a couple of security guards by her side. She had an annoyed look on her face and was about to direct her guards at me.

Just then, I noticed a button lighting up on the display marked 'D,' the topmost floor of the building. Pamela noticed this too, from the display on the outside.

As the doors sealed shut, I caught a curious smile on her face, prompting her to signal her guards to stand down, while a shiver ran down my spine, leaving that as my last image of her.

When the elevator reached the final floor, a cold gust of air welcomed me from a dimly lit corridor. Small pots of fire lined either side, barely allowing me to see more than 10 feet ahead. Stepping cautiously onto the corridor, the pots automatically began to ignite as I slowly moved, illuminating the path before me.

Then the temperature began to rapidly change as I continued to walk ahead. The chill I felt at the beginning was now replaced by a hot breeze, and I could already feel the back of my shirt sticking to my skin.

Finally, I stood before a grand entrance, its massive doors adorned with large ominous looking goat carvings. The doors then suddenly opened on their own, and I took a deep breath before deciding to step inside.

I felt an unsettling aura envelop me as soon as I set foot inside.

Fires raged against the walls, as they ebbed and flowed in a rhythmic fashion, lending the place an unnatural crimson glow.

At the center of the chamber, I saw Mr Devlin sitting on a large throne, his tail gracefully mimicking the dance of the flames around him.

Above the throne, a pentagram symbol with a goat's head embedded within, hung ominously.

Mr Devlin looked very different from what I had seen last of him. The heavy set frame with the salt and pepper hair was gone.

 Instead, the one sitting in front of me looked like an incarnate of the devil himself.

Bald, with fiery red skin and menacing horns that adorned his head, he exuded an otherworldly presence. With a slender frame and a face seemingly untouched by the passage of time, he looked to have stopped aging at 30.

The devil's piercing gaze met mine, while a chilling silence gripped the room.

"Greetings, Mathew. What a delightful surprise," Mr. Devlin's voice cut through the crackling of the flames. “It’s not everyday someone stumbles right into the devil’s lair” he said breaking into a smile.

“Why don’t you sit down first?” he continued, pointing his gaze at a chair that appeared magically in front of me.

I hesitated, feeling a knot tighten in my stomach, unsure of what awaited me in the presence of this threatening presence, but I did as I was told.
