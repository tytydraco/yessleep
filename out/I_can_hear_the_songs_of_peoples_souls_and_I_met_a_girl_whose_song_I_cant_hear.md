I don't know from where I have the power, if it can even be called one. They aren't exactly "songs" with lyrics and all, more like melodies played by undetectable instruments, and they aren't that clear. It's like you see a person wearing cologne and you know because you smell it - I see people and know they're wearing their songs by the click of random melodies in my head. 

Twists and turns can appear for some, but most are stable, unchanging rhythms that loop if you listen to them long enough. The songs are different to everyone, and at some point I've figured that the short pieces reflect people's moods, longer ones their personality. Mine is ominous and a little raspy, but it has a lot of surprises when my mood changes. A brutal person has a strong melody like which you used in the army, but if they are scared, the melody can take a very gloomy turn. A gentle person has ballad-like songs that will go even more upmood if they're happy, and heart-breaking when they are, well, heartbroken. The list goes on with more variety and combination, because what people are if not clusters of utmost complications? 

When I was a child I thought it's common sense and everyone can hear the songs like me. I grow up learning it the hard way. I don't NOT like this - I love music, I have a dream of working in the music industry, and I think it's a gift to be able to tell what people have in minds before they explicitly spell it out. I didn't wish for it, though, because I've soon realized that I have to rely on it strictly to communicate with people. I can't talk to anyone without the music to detect their feelings - which was never the case.

Not until I met her.  

I met her a long while ago when I first came to that city, working a minimum wage job to pay for the rent in a collapsing studio apartment on the top of an old-modeled building complex. I met her when I had nothing but a guitar and a wild dream of one day being a famous street artist, which was soon grinded to dust with the harsh of reality.

She was...aluring. Scary, even more as I didn't hear a thing from her, but she draws me to her like a magnet to a piece of iron. She gives out the same vibe as a stubborn beast you're not comfortable getting close to, but you will take deep pride in ever being able to do so. We met in a local bar, chatted over cheap beers, unimportant, unimportant, went to my apartment, and before I knew it, it became casual. 

I don't think I ever loved her, and she me, either. I was a stupid freshly graduated adult who weren't supposed to know better. We stumbled and fell into a wicked game of lust, at best. I was lusting for the pride of getting over my fear and taming the sole person from whom I never hear a song. I was also indulged in the delusion that one day I could fill in the blank of her silence, giving her a song worthy of her existence. I never knew I could have had it better, but I never wanted better to begin with. 

And she, she's a monster feasting on my lust. 

After almost a year, just as I was thinking about writing her a short piece of music and introducing her to my friends and family, she initiated our breakup. Completely out of nowhere. So elegant, with style, like she always did. 

“So, thrilled for a breakup?” Asked her.  

It was a breezy summer night. The new moon was half asleep, and the stars felt like they were sick of shining. It was a night out of the ordinary, with the unusual crispy touch of the air despite it being only mid-August, the usual cold, indifferent, unimpressed tone of hers. She said something so huge with so little damn given.

I remember looking up in surprise, how else should I react? She didn't seem to mind me, she never, in fact, minded anything. She was sleazily sitting with her back against the window frame, her feet dangling above the floor, and her eyes out there, like ever, wandering over the dimly lit streets, the closed doors and tattered buildings, somewhere just right over this thin wall, and yet always too far beyond my imagination. 

“Your game of pretense stinks like rat gut,” her chuckle of that night still hurts at the recall. She saw throught me, didn't she? “Aren't we too old for that crap, I daresay?”

And when I asked her to clarify her riddling craps, she replied with a name that stuck to me. “Playing deaf now, you effing deafman?" Not an answer, but another riddle, with a touch of an annoying chortle.

I guess she wasn't wrong. Deafman was the literal name for him who turned deaf when the situation calls for it. As far as I remember, it was what she said. She never filtered her words, and sometimes the brutality stings harder than I expected. Quick, blatant, and straight to the point. Like a knife to my heart.

“You no longer like the song of my soul,” she declared. 

Now that I'm thinking of it, she was chanting. There was enough disappointment in it for me to almost feel guilty, but I'd been close to her enough to detect her vile tricks. The disappointment, were there any, was solely because I pretended to not understand her words, so she couldn't talk in eerie riddles and still receive a decent answer. It was out of her boredom, never about me. 

“So what's even in it to stay in this relationship, I daresay?” She presses on, insisting on that monotonous voice, and songless soul.

Her words made me wince. She was speaking in a lazy, carefree manner, but her sinister intention was all over the place. Gaslighting, guilt-tripping, and manipulation were her regular gadgets, weren't they? Sometimes I feel like they were all understatements, nonetheless. Her games over one's head were way more lethal. 

“You don't hear it, but it doesn't matter. You wouldn't even like it if you did, I daresay.”

She dared speak for my mind, she dared get into my head, she dared mess with everything I'd rather keep to myself. I didn't know it better then, but I do now. I never meant anything to her, I was merely her spoiled frolic. She thought she could just barge into my life and cause a catastrophe, then get away with so little trouble. She was right. She was a demon, and I'm but a humble human. From the start, I'd never been her match.

On that uncannily cold night of August, she broke up with me. She said it so easily, and then she jumped off from her usual spot on the window frame into the room, probably to face me for the last time. A gust of wind moved along her steps, as I recall, chilling me to the bones. She stood on the creaking floor, with her usual smirk, on tiptoe, grabbing my chin and forcing me to look at her. She asked me why I didn't hear her song.

"How come did you never hear it? Aren't you fucking gifted, deafman?" 

How come could I answer that? I was still busy with my thoughts, and then her scent as she turned to face me. I remember her reeking of chaos, as ever. Of smoke and metal, blood and fire, of corpses and the unfortunate souls that probably have withered under her ruthless rampage. She was full of rage and horror, she was an abomination of never-ending bloodlust. She was the very first case I ever relied on smell, not hearing, to tell one's personality. She was not like other people. She was inhumane. 

And yet, she was there, in my sight, looking no different than anyone of the living human race. And yet, there was no song. And yet, I saw her clear, like a useless tiny porcelain doll. And yet, I couldn't help feeling overwhelmed, squeezed, and crumbled in her palms. It's always been like that since the moment I decided that falling into her bewitching trap wasn't the only unwise thing I'd done in my disaster of a life, and probably wouldn't be the last.

She stayed unfaltering as my shadow swallowed her whole, her smirk flaring like a wicked flame in the darkness. It was her attitude that did the trick, I know. She seemed to know how to hide her mind, so well that even her song failed to reveal it, probably too damn well as it flushed everyone she no longer wanted to toy with her away. I saw it coming the moment she approached me in that bar, and I thought I could bear the mess that came along with her enchantment like a full goddamn package.

I couldn't be more wrong. She was like a sweet poison, and, although it took me longer than many to realize it, poisons were never meant to be a fancy drink. Poisons should be stacked away in a far-off cabinet, even better six thousand miles under the ocean floor, never within anyone's reach. Poisons can be addictive at first, but the high always wears off, and when it's gone, whoever is stupid enough to hyperfixate on it would be left to suffer a severe consequence.

I was that one, it seems, the dimwitted bitch who got too close to the dangerous load of harmful substances and took gulps after gulps of it, probably still yearning for more, never knowing my limit.

Her song was never there, but her voice served as the alternative. It was stale and infiltrated with the roar of hatred, but it had a rhythm that made my heart jump in terror. It was only then that I realized my choice of words. Terror. I used to look at her with excitement and curiosity. Terror was barely a spice adding up to the mixture of intoxication that bound us together. And then terror was on the tip of my tongue, the base of my thought, the first and only thing I could associate her with.

A thousand answers were popping up in my mind back then, but I decided to go with the one-thousand-and-first, the recently added up and arguably the only unfiltered truth and a horrible choice, considering that we were on the verge of a fight. A question.

"How do you know that? I never talked to you about my ability." 

I got a mysterious smile for an answer. It was pervasive, but there was a speck of honesty. It was perhaps the first time on that night, ever since she opened your mouth, that she was sincere.

Now I think I know why. She was a narcissistic psychopath. She didn't give a crap about me, my feelings, or her feelings regarding me. The only thing that could squeeze some truth out of her flippant lips were shits about herself, solely and specifically, nobody in the picture but her goddamn self.

“You listen. I observe,” she smirked, that obnoxious smirk again. “You hear people as songs, and I read them as books. I no longer see anything worth my time in your book, not anymore. No spark. No fun. Nothing. Suppose you should have felt the same about my song grom the start, instinctively, and that's why it was never there for you. It's for the better, I daresay.”

I remembered everything she said at that moment, explaining her way of reading people to me as if I was a moron. Maybe she did think I was. Maybe I was, for falling into the abyss of her manipulation and mistaking it as love. Maybe I am, for still thinking of her with that much fixation, after all this time.

The wind of that night was cold. It snuck from outside through her movements, it filled up the air between us. It makes me shiver, even at the recall. And she didn't even flinch. She was familiar with the cold, perhaps, from the glacier that flows instead of blood in her veins. I used to think of it as her unique beauty, and who was I but a hopeless beholder?

Yet, like the pain-worthy high that came with the deathly poison, the exhilaration wore off. With time, with familiarity, with all the distance she intentionally kept up between us, and with the iciness serves as the core of whatever relationship she dragged me into. The very same thing that she was offering me a way out of.

I didn't protest. What was there to fight for, considering that she never looked that fondly at me and I just thought of her with terror. I turned my back at her, I heard her move and reach her usual spot at the window, again, but I knew it was over. She made adieu sound almost comforting.

A part of my heart back then was screeching like a pig at the butcher's blade, urging me to hold her back, and a part of my own song had turned into a weep. I didn't want to not see her, even after the sudden breakup proposal she just dumped on my head. Like a bowl of shaved ice in the middle of winter, causing brain freeze and pain to consume, the sweetness of her poison lingered and called, and it was the hardest thing to wipe away in an instant.

But I did what I could do best, and I'm still doing it now, whenever her ghost returns to haunt me in my looniest dreams. I picked up my old guitar and plucked the strings, tuning it for a lower, quieter, ominous, and whispery song, also toning down my blaring rhythm in the process. I wasn't surprised one bit to see it fade quickly.

She was right about my version of a book. I couldn't see it, but I could imagine how it displayed. The pages were filled with scribbles, horrendous doodles, and nonsensical words. None of them mattered to her as none of them was about her. It wasn't like she'd ever given me anything to jot down. Everything about our relationship had always been my desire and admiration, written with delusion and exhilaration. Now that they were gone, so were the feelings. Now that they were gone, there was no reason for me to pine over her. 

And with my book closed and the early verse of the song played, I heard a creak at the window, then a soft thud. I'm still hearing them now, sometimes, when the past reaches me further than a memory fragment. She bid me her part of the farewell, and then she no longer had a reason to remain by my side.

Still, the August wind, to me, is forever chilly. The night's dark, and wherever I go, the empty spot by the window stares at me with a surge of detest. As if she's never really gone, as if her ghost stays in that specific spot, as usual, waiting for my song to burst into another meaningless riddling fight. I choose to simply not look at it. I don't want to feed the tiny part of me that would feel sad knowing she's no longer there.

Instead, I focus on my music. There's a melody that I've tried to create, again and again, never thinking of the day it'd make it into reality. It didn't take long for me to adapt, transferring what was merely a concept in my head to a feast of the ears, giving a body to a piece of something that could have been a memory fragment given it'd ever existed. Still, I know, it isn't the thing.

She won, to that extent. She showed me the real deal and overran my mind with the concept of a living individual without a song, perhaps the one and only ever existed. I've heard great songs in my life, much better, even, and still, nothing can overwrite the empty silence she left. The melody played on my guitar sounds so stale, so replicated. A feigned intoxication.

But I never hope to ever meet her again, I don't want to ever have to deal with her again, so that attempt is the only thing I have. I'm but a hopeless beholder, after all, a musician fucked-in-the-head who has nothing but the songs in his collection to catalyze his meaningless existence. It's her I've fallen out of love with, not the desire to fill a song into that absence. And while she did a cruel thing stealing my chance to fulfill it, it's a good thing that I'm skilled enough to feed my hunger, with an ample replica of my intoxication.
