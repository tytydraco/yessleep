They say that in our town, you can always smell the rot before you see it. It drifts in on the early morning fog, carried from the shore, tangling in the warped wooden beams of our old homes, settling in the folds of our clothes. We learned to live with that smell. It was as natural as the salt on our tongues, as normal as the crooked geometry of our winding streets. I’d grown up breathing it, never knowing anything else.

But lately, that smell had changed. It had grown heavier, more viscous. It clung, not just to our clothes, but to our skin, and it seeped into our dreams. It was the smell that woke me in the cold pre-dawn darkness the morning after my father disappeared.

I remember I sat up in bed and thought I heard something scratching at the walls outside my window. The boards of my attic bedroom were thin, and the sound of the surf was always there—a distant roar—but this was something else: a whispering, rustling noise. Like fingernails scraping across rotted wood. I held my breath, paralyzed, waiting. Eventually, the scratching stopped, or maybe I drifted back into a half-sleep and pretended it did.

By daylight, my father still had not returned.

My father was a fisherman, like most men in our town. He left every morning to take his small boat past the breakwater and did not return until well after dark. He rarely spoke of his work, and I never dared ask what he pulled from those waters. The catches were meager and often strange—fish with tumors, crabs missing half their legs, eels with bulging eyes. Sometimes he came home with nothing but a bundle of starfish fused together in horrifying knots. Mother would say nothing, only nod and take the malformed creatures away. I never knew what she did with them.

The day he vanished, I found my mother in the kitchen, staring silently out the window toward the beach. The tide was low, and the exposed rocks gleamed in the early sun. She held a carving knife in her hand, not cutting anything, just holding it, squeezing it. The smell was worse inside than out. It seemed to emanate from the basement door, an oak slab to which I’d never paid much attention before. But that morning, I swore I saw it tremble. Just a gentle shiver, as if something pushed against it from the other side.

“Mother,” I said quietly. “Should we send someone to look for Father?”

She turned, and I noticed how red her eyes were. She hadn’t slept. Her mouth opened, but no words emerged. Finally, she shook her head. “He’ll come back,” she whispered. “They always come back.”

At the time, I didn’t know what she meant by “they.” I thought she was just upset, speaking nonsense.

The next night, I went out looking. I knew the town’s men would be huddled in the tavern by the shore. Even in the dead of night, it never really closed. It smelled of kelp and old beer. But when I arrived, I found only silence and empty stools. A dozen mugs stood half-filled and abandoned. The door was open, creaking in the wind.

I walked through empty streets and saw no one. Yet I felt watched—windows were shuttered, but I sensed eyes behind every crack. I remember passing old Mr. Kerrigan’s house and hearing a low moan from inside, a wheezing rasp that could have been pain or laughter. I hurried on.

I wanted to check the pier. The moonlight was weak, but I could still make out the shapes of boats bobbing in the distance. As I approached the beach, I stepped on something soft and yielding. I looked down and recoiled. It was a cluster of sea cucumbers, knotted together with strands of black seaweed. Among them were small crabs that weren’t scuttling away but lying still with their legs curled inward, as though embracing the rotting mass. I kicked them aside, but they clung to each other, a single grotesque organism.

At the shoreline, I found my father’s boat. It had drifted onto a rocky outcropping, half-sunken, the hull pierced and oozing brackish water. The net inside was shredded. More of those malformed sea creatures lay in a pile at the bottom, and I saw something paler underneath them. Leaning in, I recognized a scrap of my father’s coat. And then I noticed the blood. There wasn’t much, just a trail leading from the boat into the waves. It looked almost deliberate, as if painted on the surface of the water, glistening in the moonlight.

I backed away, heart pounding. Somewhere behind me, I swear I heard soft laughter.

The next morning, my father came home.

I heard him first, scraping at the door frame with what sounded like a dull blade. I rushed downstairs to find him in the entryway. Mother stood off to the side, trembling. Father’s clothes dripped with seawater, and his hair hung in thin, matted strands. He smelled like old fish guts left too long in the sun. But that wasn’t the worst of it.

He had changed. His eyes were swollen and surrounded by inflamed skin. His lips were cracked, and when he looked at me, he smiled with a mouth full of tiny, needle-like teeth. I hadn’t remembered them being that way. His hands shook, fingers tensed into claws. He said nothing, only nodded and walked past me into the house, leaving a wet trail behind him.

Mother followed him silently into the basement.

I wanted to scream, to demand an explanation. But something in the house had changed, too. The air weighed heavily on me. The basement door closed with a dull thud. I stood at the top of the stairs, my heart thumping so loudly I could hear it, and I could have sworn I heard voices below. Wet, slithering voices.

Over the following days, I kept my distance. Father did not speak. He did not return to fishing. He seemed to spend all his time below the house. I grew curious, and when both my parents were out—Mother collecting driftwood for the stove, Father gone who knows where—I crept into the basement.

It was a cramped space with a low ceiling and beams blackened by age. We used it mostly for storage: preserved fish, jars of pickled kelp, old nets. But now, there was something else. In the center of the dirt floor lay a large wooden box, half-open, reeking of decay. Inside were twisted masses of things I could not identify: fleshy lumps with barnacles, translucent sacks writhing with parasites, and a shape that looked almost human but impossibly deformed. The stench made my eyes water. I had to clamp a hand over my mouth to stifle a cry.

On a shelf, I found a rusted metal tool with hooked ends—something between a fishing gaff and a surgeon’s instrument. The handle bore my father’s initials. I placed it back carefully, heart pounding. Before I could leave, I noticed something etched into the wooden beam nearest the box. It was a shape: a crude spiral engraved deep into the wood, each swirl lined with reddish-black crust. The spiral made me dizzy. I blinked and looked away, hurrying up the steps.

As I closed the basement door behind me, I imagined that spiral spiraling into my mind, coiling inside my head like a parasitic worm.

Our neighbors began to disappear. Sometimes I would see them walk into the fog and never return. Other times, they’d vanish overnight. The tavern remained empty. The few people I still encountered on the street would not meet my gaze. I approached one—an old woman whose name I think was Eliza—and asked if she knew what was happening. She stared at me with watery, bulging eyes and said, “The tide brings them back to us. The tide always brings them home.”

Her voice was barely human, more like the rasp of shells rubbing together.

That night, I heard my mother humming. She hadn’t hummed a tune since I was a little child. The sound drifted upstairs as I tried to sleep. It was a lullaby out of key, each note drawn out and trembling. I crept downstairs to find her in the kitchen. She was hunched over the sink, scrubbing something with a stiff brush. I approached quietly and saw it was a piece of skin—pale and rubbery, flecked with barnacles and sea lice. It was draped over the cutting board. She hummed as if washing a piece of laundry.

I gasped. She turned, startled. For a moment, her eyes were wild and full of terror, then they relaxed, and she tried to smile. But her smile broke into a grin too wide, stretching her cheeks painfully.

“You shouldn’t be here,” she said, voice wavering. “Go to bed.” Her voice softened. “It’s… it’s just old nets. I’m cleaning them.”

I glanced back at the “skin” and realized it might indeed have once been part of a net—albeit a grotesque, organic one. Something was very wrong, but I had no idea what to do.

I left her and returned to my room. I did not sleep that night. I sat in bed, listening to the scratching and shuffling sounds that drifted up from below. And something else: a dripping, as if water leaked steadily through the floorboards, drop by drop.

Morning brought an oily fog that coated the entire town. I ventured outside, hoping to find someone—anyone—who still seemed sane. What I found was a silent procession along the beach. A dozen figures, wrapped in old tarps and fishing nets, shambled along the shore. They carried something large and misshapen between them, something that dripped with thick fluid and left a trail behind. I could not see their faces, but I could hear low chanting, a sound like bubbles breaking in thick mud.

They disappeared behind a cluster of black rocks. I followed at a distance, careful to keep out of sight. Beyond the rocks was a small cove I had never explored. The procession stopped there. I peered around a boulder and saw them lowering their burden into a shallow tide pool. The water churned and frothed, as if boiling. I noticed shapes wriggling beneath the surface—eels, or maybe something else, their bodies twisting in impossible knots. The figures leaned in as if listening, then all at once they stiffened and turned my way.

I pulled back, heart racing. Had they seen me? I didn’t dare look again. I crawled away on hands and knees, trying not to retch at the smell that hung over the cove.

When I returned home, I found my father sitting at the kitchen table. He stared at me intently with those bulging eyes, his hands folded neatly in front of him. He did not blink.

“We must leave,” I blurted out. “Something’s happening to the town. We have to get out before…”

Before what? Before everyone turned into… into whatever he had become?

Father only tilted his head. His lips curled back, revealing those needle-like teeth again. “The town belongs to the tide,” he said, voice slurred, as though speaking with a mouth full of jelly. “We all belong here. We can never leave.”

He reached out and gripped my wrist. His skin was cold and damp. I tried to pull away, but he was impossibly strong. He dug his nails into my flesh until I cried out. Mother hovered behind him, eyes lowered, as if ashamed. Her hair seemed thinner than before, and patches of her scalp were visible, raw and scabbed.

“We stay,” she whispered. “We stay until the feeding is done.”

I did not know what that meant, but I knew I had to escape. That night, I packed a small bag. I intended to slip out and run along the coastline until I found a path out of this cursed place. I prayed the next town over would not be like this—that I could find help, alert someone.

But as I opened my window to climb out, I saw them: dark silhouettes scattered across the street, their heads angled up at my window, their eyes gleaming faintly in the moonlight. They were watching. Every single one of them. Waiting.

I closed the window and sank to the floor, sobbing quietly.

I did not see my father or mother the next morning. The basement door was open. Against all sense, I decided to descend again—maybe I could find something that would help me understand how to break free.

The stench was overwhelming now. By the dim light of a single bulb, I saw that the wooden box was gone. In its place was a pit, a hole in the dirt floor that hadn’t been there before. It slanted downward, lined with slick, pulsating membranes that resembled giant fish gills. I peered into the hole and saw it went deep, deeper than the foundation of our house should allow, perhaps all the way down into wet caverns beneath the town.

A low moaning sound issued from the depths of that pit. It sounded like my father’s voice, but stretched and distorted. The spiral symbol was everywhere now—etched into beams, painted on jars, carved into the stone foundation. Each spiral seemed to shift when I wasn’t looking, coiling tighter, pulling my gaze deeper into its center.

I backed away, nearly tripping on a bundle of fishing line. I hurried upstairs, slamming the basement door, and shoved a heavy chair against it. Whatever lay down there, I did not want it coming up.

At midday, the fog lifted slightly, and I ventured outside again. The world felt wrong. Buildings leaned at strange angles. The cobblestone streets shone with a faint, slimy residue. In places, the ground seemed to ripple, as though stretched over something moving beneath it. The smell was worse than ever, a heady combination of decay and brine.

I found one person—my old classmate, Miriam—lurking in an alley. She was hunched over, gnawing on something. When I called her name, she turned slowly. Her face was gaunt, her cheeks hollow. Her pupils were oddly shaped, elongated like a fish’s. She opened her mouth, and a tiny crab scuttled out, dropping to the ground at my feet. Then she giggled—a high, broken sound—and darted away, limbs jerking awkwardly.

No help there.

I tried to leave town along the main road, the one leading inland. But as I neared the outskirts, I found the road blocked by heaps of washed-up debris. It looked as if a recent storm had hurled half the ocean floor onto the street: rotting kelp, seashells grown together in hard lumps, starfish fused into fleshy disks. And embedded in the pile, I saw human limbs, tangled and covered in coral growths. Faces pressed through layers of barnacles, twisted in silent screams. The stench made me vomit. There was no way around this barrier. It rose higher than I could climb, and the mass seemed alive, shifting and clicking in the silence.

I stumbled back, tears in my eyes, and ran home.

That evening, I felt the town stirring. A distant droning hum drifted through the streets. It came from all directions, as if the houses themselves were moaning. I looked out the window and saw people moving together in a single direction: toward the beach. They carried torches and nets, hunched figures shambling in uneven steps. They were drawn like moths to a flame.

Without thinking, I followed them. I stayed in the shadows, careful not to be seen. The procession led me back to that secret cove, where the tide now rolled gently in, bringing something with it. I crouched behind rocks and watched.

They formed a circle at the water’s edge and began to chant. The sound was wordless yet rhythmic, like the distant cry of whales. My father stood at the front of the group, and next to him was my mother, holding his hand. The moonlight made their features more monstrous: Father’s teeth glistened, Mother’s scalp gleamed with open sores.

Then, as the water receded, something large and pale emerged from the surf. At first, I took it for a whale carcass washed ashore. But as it slid forward, I realized it had too many limbs—long, rubbery appendages studded with barnacles. Its body was a mass of writhing tissue, and its head… oh, God, its head. It had human features twisted beyond recognition. Where eyes should be, I saw blistered cavities, and the mouth was a funnel of needle-like teeth, much like my father’s. As it dragged itself onto the sand, it emitted a sickening groan.

The townsfolk knelt, pressing their foreheads into the wet sand, their backs contorting. Father and Mother stepped forward, arms raised. The chanting grew louder. The creature’s limbs unfurled, revealing suckers that dripped black slime. It reached out and caressed Father’s face with a malformed tentacle. He shuddered and grinned. Then, he opened his mouth wide, and the creature lowered something into it—a chunk of its own flesh, torn from its body, glistening and twitching.

I had to bite my tongue to keep from screaming.

One by one, the townsfolk came forward. Each received a piece of the creature’s flesh and ate it. Their eyes rolled back, their bodies convulsed. As they rose, I saw transformations taking hold at once: necks elongating, fingers fusing, hair dropping away. The air was filled with squelching sounds, the slither of moist tissue rearranging itself.

I knew I was next, if they found me. I tried to crawl away, but my hand slipped on the rocks, dislodging a small stone that tumbled noisily into the tide pool. All heads turned.

I froze. Father stepped toward my hiding spot. “My child,” he called softly. His voice warbled, each syllable bubbling from his throat. “Come join us.”

I bolted. I ran along the dark shore, stumbling over debris. Behind me, I heard their uneven footsteps and choked laughter. A glance over my shoulder revealed not just the townsfolk, but the creature itself slithering after me, dragging its bulk over the sand. They moved strangely fast, their malformed bodies propelled by unnatural strength.

I fled inland, but the barrier of dead sea life blocked the main road. I tried another route—a narrow alley between two houses. But everywhere I turned, I found the path blocked by twisted barricades of driftwood and rotting flesh. The town had changed into a maze designed to trap me. The spiral symbol flashed in my mind, making me dizzy.

I ended up cornered in the old watchtower near the edge of town. It was a wooden structure, half-collapsed, and as I climbed the rickety stairs, I could feel the boards sagging beneath my weight. I could see them gathering below—Father, Mother, and the rest—surrounding the tower.

“Come down,” Mother called. “We can’t ascend without you. You’re the last one. We must all feed, or it won’t be complete.”

She held up her arms, and her fingers were now spines of cartilage. Her eyes shone with a cold hunger.

The creature loomed behind them, its bulk quivering. It let out a low moan that rattled my bones.

I looked down. Beneath the tower was a writhing carpet of inhuman forms, all reaching for me. I was trapped.

I searched my pockets, hoping to find something—anything—to help me escape. Nothing. Just lint. If I jumped, I’d fall into their hands. If I stayed, they’d tear the tower down. I could already feel them pulling at the supports, making the structure sway.

“Why?” I screamed. “Why are you doing this?”

Father’s head twitched at an odd angle. “We have been chosen,” he said, voice scraping. “The tide brings forth the Great Feeder. We are its children, nourished by its flesh. It will reshape us, remake us into its image. We will ascend from these rotten shores and spread beyond.”

I shook my head, tears blurring my vision. My family, my home, all lost to this… thing.

The tower trembled violently. I had minutes, perhaps less, before it collapsed.

And then I saw something—at the base of the tower was a trapdoor leading to an old cellar. If I could slip through there, maybe I could tunnel my way out, or find some hidden route.

I waited until the tower groaned again, then jumped down onto a crossbeam, and from there, dropped through the trapdoor into darkness. I landed hard, twisting my ankle. I stifled a cry and crawled forward. The cellar was damp, water pooling on the floor. I felt along the walls until I found a narrow passage, a drainage tunnel leading underground.

I entered the tunnel and crawled through foul-smelling sludge. The chanting and moaning above faded. Perhaps they’d lost track of me. Or maybe they knew exactly where I was going.

The passage led downward, spiraling—a shape that mirrored the carved symbols. My hands slipped on slimy moss, and my breath came in wheezing gasps. Eventually, the tunnel opened into a cavern lit by bioluminescent fungi. The glow revealed more horrors: hunched figures crouched around pools of stagnant water, feeding on pale, eyeless fish. They looked up as I entered, their faces slack and drooping. One crawled toward me, leaving a trail of mucus.

I backed away and took another passage, my mind numb with terror. Each corridor twisted more than the last, spiraling deeper, until I no longer knew if I was below the town or somewhere else entirely.

At last, I stumbled into a large chamber. In the center lay a shallow pool of black water. Stalactites dripped from above, and the walls were carved with spirals. The smell was suffocating. As I approached the pool, I saw something stirring within it—tiny, larval creatures wriggling under the surface. They had human-like faces, twisted and incomplete. I leaned over to look closer, horrified and fascinated. One of them looked like me. It had my eyes, my nose, but distorted, as if seen through murky glass.

I screamed and stepped back, tripping over a lump on the floor. It was a chunk of that pale flesh I’d seen the creature feeding my father. It pulsed softly, as if alive.

Footsteps echoed in the tunnels behind me. I had nowhere else to go but through. I splashed into the pool, wading chest-deep, disturbing the larval things. They whimpered softly, brushing against my legs. On the far side of the pool was a narrow slit in the rock. I squeezed through it, my shoulders scraping stone.

On the other side was a small hollow. To my horror, I found my parents waiting for me. They stood nude, their skin covered in weeping sores. Their bodies were partially fused—Mother’s arm melted into Father’s ribcage, their legs twisted together. They smiled with identical sets of needle-like teeth.

“You have come home,” Father said. “You cannot resist the tide.”

I backed away, but hands seized me from behind. Townsfolk with elongated limbs and dripping faces. Miriam, with that crab crawling from her mouth. Mr. Kerrigan, his neck stretching like rubber. They pulled me into their embrace.

I struggled, screamed, but it was useless. Father reached out, holding a piece of that fleshy mass. It squirmed in his grip like a living organ. He pressed it against my mouth.

I clenched my teeth, trying not to inhale the stench. They pried my jaws open, chanting all the while. The creature’s flesh touched my tongue, and I tasted salt, decay, and something else—something alive and hungry.

The world swam before my eyes. My muscles twitched. I felt my bones soften, my skin grow clammy. The chamber spun around me, the spirals on the walls coming to life, twisting and tightening. I felt myself changing, my mind slipping into a void filled with churning black water and snapping jaws.

Through the haze of my transformation, I saw the Great Feeder again. It emerged from the darkness, pushing into the cavern, folding its bulk through impossibly narrow tunnels. It was everywhere, filling the space with its stench. I realized now it was the town itself—the houses, the roads, the beaches—all just part of its sprawling, organic mass. We had lived on its back like parasites, and now it was reabsorbing us.

My parents knelt beside me, stroking my hair as it fell out in clumps. My fingers fused, and my lungs filled with thick fluid, allowing me to breathe underwater, or whatever this foul atmosphere was. I felt new teeth emerging behind the old ones. My eyes bulged, adjusting to the dim light.

I tried to hold onto a scrap of my old self—my name, my childhood memories, the feel of sunlight on my face. But they were slipping away like sand through my fingers. The Feeder’s mind pulsed in mine, whispering that I belonged to it. I was just another spawn, another piece of its endless life cycle. There was no escape, no salvation.

At that moment, I managed to wrench free for an instant—just long enough to scramble backward and bump into the wall of the cavern. The chanting grew urgent. Father and Mother hissed, their mouths stretching wider than any human mouth should. Their eyes bore into me, commanding me to submit.

I pressed myself against the slimy rock, panting. My bones felt wrong, bending at unnatural angles. My vision doubled. The larval faces in the pools giggled softly.

A sudden hush fell. The townsfolk parted, allowing the Great Feeder to approach. It lowered a tentacle, coiling it around my waist. Its skin was rough and cold, and it lifted me into the air as if I weighed nothing. I dangled before its colossal head, staring into its empty sockets.

I expected it to devour me. Instead, it spoke inside my head, its voice older than time:

\*\*You are the last to join. Now the cycle can complete.\*\*

I felt my heart give a sickening lurch. What did that mean?

The Feeder opened its maw. Inside, I saw endless rows of teeth, and beyond them, another world—a dark ocean writhing with impossible shapes. It brought me closer, and I saw my reflection in its slick teeth. I was barely human now. My skin was pale and rubbery, my eyes wide and unblinking, my mouth already sprouting needle-teeth.

I tried to scream, but only a wet gurgle emerged.

The Feeder’s jaws closed around me, not biting, but encasing me in darkness. I felt wet heat, smelled the rank odor of its breath. Something latched onto my spine—a feeding tube, perhaps. I felt my essence draining, my memories dissolving. Images of my childhood home, my parents’ once-human faces, the old market and the smell of fried fish—these flickered and went dark.

And then new images surged in. Visions of countless generations absorbed by this creature, towns eaten whole, their inhabitants reshaped into something monstrous. I was just one more soul in its gut, one more cell in its body.

In that final flicker of consciousness, as I lost the last shreds of my humanity, I understood the truth. The Feeder had always been here, sleeping beneath our shores. The town was built atop its flesh, and we were its livestock. Periodically, it awakened, summoned by unknown tides and cosmic cycles. Then it reclaimed what was always its own, twisting and devouring until nothing human remained.

The spiral symbols I’d seen were its signature, carved into our minds and walls. They ensured we never escaped, that we always turned back inward, into the Feeder’s embrace.

As my new brothers and sisters pressed closer, singing their horrible lullaby, I felt myself merging with them. My parents wrapped their contorted limbs around me, welcoming me into the family of horrors. My senses expanded until I could feel the entire town—the houses now dripping with organic growth, the streets pulsing with veins of black blood, the townsfolk all joined in an endless, churning mass of flesh and bone.

In the end, there was no escape. I became part of it. My voice joined the chorus, bubbling and gurgling. My body bent to the Feeder’s will. We rose together, a single organism, crawling from the subterranean caverns back into the moonlit night. The town writhed and twisted, lifting itself from the shore, dripping with filth and gore.

Somewhere on a distant horizon, there might be other towns, other unsuspecting villages. We would find them. We would spread, devour, and reshape, as we had done here. The Feeder’s hunger was insatiable.

As I looked out through dozens of eyes—my own included—I saw the black ocean shimmering. The starlight reflected in oily patterns on the waves. The smell of rot and salt filled my lungs—or what had once been my lungs.

And I realized that this horror would never end. It would go on, forever, a cycle of feeding and transformation, leaving behind only nightmares and empty shells.

I tried to scream once more, but now my scream was the Feeder’s scream, echoing across the silent waves. And no one outside the town could hear.

That was the worst part, the final spine-chilling truth: the silence beyond our twisted shores. There would be no rescue, no pity. Only the night, the tide, and the endless hunger.

We slithered into the cold surf, drawn by ancient instincts. The water closed around us, dark and thick. In the dim glow of distant plankton, I saw the silhouettes of countless others like us drifting in the deep, waiting to be summoned. Soon we would rise, and where we rose, no human soul would remain untainted.

This was our end and our beginning. The town had become the Feeder, and I was just a voice among many, drowned in eternal hunger.

The last remnant of my human self curled into a fetal knot inside my mind, weeping soundlessly in the vast darkness. A futile gesture. Everything human was gone, consumed by the tide and the teeth and the spirals of this monstrous fate.

In that absolute silence, with no one to witness, we sank deeper into black waters, ready to rise elsewhere, and feed again.
