I’ll try not to beat around the bush here. I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years about 4 months ago. The more accurate description would be that she ghosted me. I haven’t had so much as half a day without thinking about her and what she did, and a lot of that is owed to her nightly appearances in my dreams.

It’s a complete day ruiner whenever this happens. I feel a mix of disgust, guilt, shame, anger, and a general sense of great defeat every day after waking up. I’ve gone more quiet around everyone I know, more than I usually am. Some days I don’t sleep or sleep for only a few hours in the hopes she won’t show up. When she does, it’s something different every time but usually it boils down to one of a couple things. The first is that she shows up at my place and comes on to me, we start hooking up, and I wake up in the middle of it. The second is that I run into her with her group of friends out in some public place and we talk, and the length of that conversation varies each time. I’m always weak when I talk to her, desperately begging for any answers as to why. Her answers are always covered up by wind or the distortion of my brain, but I hear the words “I love you” at the end of it before she walks away. Other times it’s brief flashes of close affection like we used to have. Her holding my face, scratching my back from behind while kissing me on the neck, cuddling, or running her hands through my hair while I laid my head on her lap. I don’t know if anyone else is like this, but every time I dream, I’m fully immersed and believe it to be reality. I could never lucid dream because any time I realized I was dreaming I woke up immediately. So each and every one of these dreams has been like reopening that heartbreak all over again. Every day I’ve woken up to the crushing realization that she’s gone, and I’ll never get that closing conversation with her.

Now, I probably wouldn’t be posting this if it was just that. But there is another dream I had a few days ago, and I can’t get it off my mind. In this dream, I’ve hit the worst kind of bad luck jackpot in the world and ended up on the bus back to our hometown together (for context, we both attend college a few cities away from home and take the bus to get back for breaks). We sat next to each other, with less than an inch of room between us, for the next 5-6 hours for the ride. In this dream, I’m much more assertive. I let my anger come out, and my jumbled thoughts start spilling forward in a way that isn’t quite satisfying, but seems to have an effect on her. If you’re going to tell me I should start journaling my dreams, you’re totally right, but I haven’t. This is a rough recollection of what I said to her:

“You know, I always really loved you. And I always put up with the times when you didn’t give an ounce of it back to me. I waited for you, for weeks on end, ready to welcome you without so much as an apology if you ever came back. I had to accept all on my own that I was never gonna get something as little as a goodbye. You knew I didn’t have any friends when we moved up here, you knew how alone I was, yet you left me all alone, and expected me to give you everything. I forgave you every single time you forgot something important to me, or disrespected me, or humiliated me, but I’ll never forgive this. Tell me, how easy was it to walk out the door for the last time? How easy was it to cut me off on everything? How easy was it to throw away all those cards I made you, the gifts I bought you, and delete all those pictures of us together? Did you even care, ever?”
She didn’t respond, just looking straight forward, then out the window. It shattered my heart again.
“ANSWER ME!” I shouted. She turned back to me, and blankly said this:

“The end of the cul de sac on Whispering Needle Way. Go there, in the field of dirt, and bury the last card. Return the next d-“ and it cuts off there before she finishes.

 I assumed she said “day,” but it seemed her directions were pointless. I went to where she told me to, card in tow, but there wasn’t any field of dirt. The end of the cul de sac just leads into a forest. Just for the sake of thoroughness, I still buried the card under some dirt. It was the last card she gave me that I couldn’t bear to throw away. I would’ve forgotten about what she said, but I had the same dream last night. This time though, I woke up at 4 in the morning. It was still pitch black outside, and it seemed cosmically pertinent that today, right now, I go back. I put on some more cold appropriate clothes and slipped out my dorm room, and made my way back to the cul de sac. I really didn’t expect anything, and part of me really wanted nothing to happen. To my amazement, the forest was completely gone, somehow totally leveled to dirt in the day or so that I’d been away.

I stepped out of the car and noticed a possibly even more confusing sight, four people stood there in a small spread out circle, each holding powered on flashlights. Possibly because of my confusion, or my fear, I couldn’t approach them. I just stood there on the sidewalk until one of them noticed me. They pointed their lights at me, murmured something, and then started walking away. I started jogging toward them, and slowed to a speed walk when I got close to them. I still found myself unable to use my words very well. By the time I had an idea of what to say, they stopped. The man closest to me spoke.

Man 1: “Can we help you?” 

Me: “Uhhhhhhhh….” I took 5 seconds before I responded.
“Why are you guys here?” 

Man 1: “Why are YOU here? Did you find this place off of the forum?”

Me: “What forum?” Someone else behind him spoke up.

Man 2: “Hey, how did you find this place anyway?”

Me: “I don’t think you guys would believe me. Seriously, who are you guys?”

Man 2: “We’ll tell you if you answer me already. Why are you here?”

Me: “Someone told me to be.”

Man 2: “Okay, I understand your caution, but cut it out. I’m gonna wager a guess and say this “someone” was in a dream of yours. What did they say?” 

I was stunned into silence for a few moments, realizing these people might understand my plight.
Me: “She told me to come here, and, uh, bury a card, and come back later. Does that make any sense?” Another person's voice came up.

Woman 1: “She? You said she?”

Man 2: “Who is this woman you’re talking about?”

Man 1: “What was on the card?”

Man 2: “Wait, wait, where did you bury the-“

Me: “Can you stop, please? My God.” I summarized everything that I’d seen up to that point.

Woman 1: “Holy shit, we haven’t gotten one of these in a while.”

Me: “One of what? I’ve told you guys everything, please, for God’s sake, tell me what’s going on here.”

Man 2: “I need you to make a decision for me first. What we’re about to do is dangerous. You may get hurt. Are you sure you want to know? You could go home now, and live your life in safety. If you come with us, you’ll likely never be the same.”

Me: “I… I don’t know.”

Man 2: “I’m gonna give you a day to decide. It’s likely not much will happen tonight. If you don’t show up 24 hours from now, the forest will return, and you will never see us again. Choose wisely. Oh, and bring a mask.” They turned around, and walked into the darkness. 

Since then, I haven’t really been in reality. I went to my classes today, but I couldn’t tell you a single thing that happened. My mind has been on this decision. I wish I could tell you guys more, but this is all I know so far. What I’m hoping you guys could tell me is what I should do. I have a strong feeling there are answers, and possibly more waiting for me at the end of that cul de sac, but that could also mean my death for all I know. If there’s any way I could get her out of my dreams, please, do tell me. If not, I know what to do.
