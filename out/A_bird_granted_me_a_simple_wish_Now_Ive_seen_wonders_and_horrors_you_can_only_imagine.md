A few days after my thirtieth birthday, I saved the life of a blue jay, scaring my cat away at a crucial moment. Grateful, the bird granted me a wish. Unfortunately, the jay was also impatient and only gave me fifteen seconds to decide. 

“I’ve always wanted to be smaller,” I said, and it was true. As 6’6 woman, I’m constantly met with gawking stares and reminders that the world isn’t built for me. Clothes don’t fit, cars are too small, and the only men who want to date me are fetishists. 

“Yep!” said the blue jay before flying off to look for worms. 

The next day, I woke up, and I was 5’8. Getting in the car was awesome. It felt like I’d boarded a plane and been upgraded to first class. No one on the street even looked at me. I headed to Macy’s and bought a whole new wardrobe. Everything fit right off the rack. 

I swept out the doors, my arms laden with shopping bags, and had to stop myself from bursting into song.

The next morning I was 4’5. None of my new clothes fit. Outside, people were staring again. I couldn’t reach the pedals of my car. I ran out to my yard and screamed at the blue jay, but it just startled away. Maybe it wasn’t even the same bird. 

I went inside and cried and watched TV. All day, the blanket seemed bigger and bigger, and when I measured myself just before bedtime, I was three foot two.

The next morning, I was no more than a foot tall. Getting out of bed was terrifying. I clung to the fitted sheet and I rappelled down the side of the mattress and finally landed in a heap on the floor. 

I stole clothes from an old Barbie my niece had left in my office and headed out the cat door. Outside, I yelled at the birds again, and they looked at me hungrily.

“Why would you do this to me?” I shouted. “I saved you.”

A blue jay fluttered down and examined me.

“Are. You. Mouse?” it asked. “You. Funny.”

And I realized the bird wasn’t malicious. It was an idiot. 

“Please,” I said. “Can’t you undo the wish?”

“Worm!” shouted the bird, and it flew off to fight over a piece of rope with another jay.

By the end of the day, I was less than an inch tall. For the first time, fear truly set in. I would only keep getting smaller. Perhaps I would eventually disappear. Or perhaps there was no such thing as disappearing. 

Perhaps you could grow smaller and smaller infinitely. I wasn’t sure. But I knew that as far as my old life was concerned, I was basically dead, a tiny ghost walking the world unnoticed. 

That night, I tried to sleep in the warmth of a paper napkin I’d dropped a few days earlier, shaking with cold and fear, wondering what the morning would bring.

It became difficult to tell how small I’d grown by the next day. I only knew the fibers of the paper towel stretched out like a thick, massive spiderweb that stretched out in all directions. 

Around me, I now sensed the movements of terrifying mites that towered over me like great eldritch beasts. They examined me with their greedy eyes, and opened their mouths to reveal teeth sharper than fine hairs. I could imagine them cutting my body into pieces finer than glass dust. And I ran, covering inches in hours, screaming that I didn’t want to die.

Soon, I was stepping past impossible viruses whose wiggling hairlike tentacles flopped at random, threatening to break my skin with the faintest contact. The universe no longer seemed to be in order but was breaking down to chaos. Nothing had a mind but merely moved. I began to sense the wavelengths of light as having true width. Soon, they were longer than my body.

My mind began to untangle as I realized I had been a knot before. It was as if the intricate folds of my brain were being pulled taught to become an infinite string. I would have shaken with terror, but my body was not as it had once been. I was something not quite human now.

And then the world became empty. The distance between all things seemed to become infinite, though at times the air buzzed with the humming of electrons, or perhaps something else, unknowable.

I grew ready to disappear. I’d never believed in anything, but now I’d witnessed a feckless bird with unimaginable power. Perhaps I should have called to it. Instead, oddly, I found myself praying to myself. And then my voice disappeared in the hum of all things.

But when I should have blinked away, I instead felt a new heaviness inside. I looked at my fingers and saw myself adorned with infinite rings, and where rubies and sapphires might have set, instead I saw red giants and black holes. Whole galaxies were moles and scars along my arms.

But I kept shrinking. Soon the largest star adorning me was our own small sun, and then it too was gone, replaced with gas giants, then smaller, rocky worlds.

On my sixth day shrinking, I was the sky. 

And then on the seventh, I woke in my own bed.

As I sat up, my cat pounced up on my feet, dropping a mangled blue jay onto the comforter.

“Good girl,” I said, giving her a small rub with [my large, ugly hand.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
