The comfortable chair was one of those expensive gaming chairs. There were three of them in the room, their unique shade of red popping against the bright lights. The matte black, circular table I was sitting at was a piece I'd consider buying myself. The wall color of the room reminded me of an overcast day in the south, one of those deep gray cloudy storms that just seem to come out of nowhere on a hot summer day. They last for only thirty minutes before the clouds reveal the familiar blue of the humid season.

If I had closed my eyes, I could have imagined I was back home. But that wasn’t going to happen as two people sat down. This was the first time I was meeting them in person, but I had been exchanging emails and texts with Shelby. She was a soft-spoken woman with green eyes that looked like lush green grass and a shade of natural blonde hair that I personally envied. She gave a gentle smile as she settled into her seat.

"Are you ready?" Kyle asked his partner on their channel. Though I suspected he was interested in more than just friendship, judging by their interactions. His shaggy, light brown hair and well-trimmed beard suggested he put a lot of effort into his appearance, likely to impress Shelby.

I nodded as I watched Kyle sit in his chair, trying to smooth out his egg-shell colored shirt with Sid Vicious printed on it for the camera. "How does everything look from over there, Chuck?" he asked, looking a few feet away from the table where the three of us sat.

Another man, with thinning red hair, slouched in his chair behind a laptop. A folded table beside him held a few cans of Red Bull and a small bag of chips. Unlike Kyle, he seemed unconcerned with appearances. The screen's glow illuminated his pale complexion. "It looks good over here. Give me a moment, and I'll get the chat ready," he replied.

"Thank you so much for agreeing to do this, Claire," Shelby said, her eyes filled with sincerity. "I know we've been talking back and forth, but I'm glad you can finally share your story."

"I'm just tired of hiding," I replied.

"Yeah, this one might finally put us on the map," Kyle chimed in. He adjusted his microphone and laptop, revealing the top of his shirt. "How do I look over there, Chuck?"

"You look good," Chuck replied, giving a thumbs-up. He then returned his attention to his laptop, typing rapidly with intense focus. "We should be ready to go live in just a few minutes."

"So how do you wanna open this, Claire?" Kyle asked, his face radiating curiosity and excitement. "Do you want to just go into the details about your rescue and what you saw that night?"

Shelby  gave Kyle a look before turning back to me. "How about we let Claire decide how she wants to tell her life story, Kyle?"

"Sorry, you're right," Kyle replied. "It's just so fascinating, and I'm sure our viewers will be absolutely hooked on this story."

"Let her tell her story in her way," Shelby said, starting to type lightly on her laptop. The room echoed with the clicks and clacks of keyboards as the three of them focused on their screens. I sat in silence, wondering if I had made the right choice in doing this live stream. Surely, I had, because I had a feeling this was the right platform to tell the story.

"Are you guys ready?" Chuck asked, stretching his arms out and looking at the three of us. The two of them glanced at me, pausing slightly, as if time had stopped. Kyle's eyes were wide with eagerness, while Shelby looked at me with empathy. All eyes were on me, waiting for my answer.

I nodded and gently said, “Yes, I am ready.” 

“Are you positive, Claire?” Shelby asked one more time to be sure.

“Yes.” 

"Alright, let's do this!" Kyle exclaimed, clapping his hands excitedly. He nodded to Chuck, who began clicking his laptop even more furiously, while Shelby shifted in her chair and I waited with anticipation.

"In three... two... one," Chuck said, clicking a single key before falling silent. A slight awkwardness crept in; this was a first for me. But with an audience now, it was time to tell the story.

"Hey everyone, it's me Kyle."

"And I am Shelby, welcome to The Sinister Southern Stories, where we talk about everything spooky below the Mason Dixon line!"

"Today, we have a special guest," Kyle announced, turning to me. My stomach fluttered, and a light sweat broke out on my brow. I nodded gently. "Her name is Claire Lamb, and she's kindly joined us to share her story."

"Thank you again, Claire," Shelby added.

"Thanks for having me," I replied, my voice slightly trembling with nervousness. My stomach churned, and I felt more sweat forming on my forehead, my face reddening.

"So Claire, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?" Kyle asked. The weight of countless eyes seemed to bear down on me, and I felt a wave of nausea.

"Claire, are you okay?" Shelby asked, noticing my discomfort. I smiled weakly, trying to compose myself. *Silently*, I reassured myself that I could do this. "Take your time, Claire," she continued.

I cleared my throat and said, "My name is Claire. I'm from a small town in Tennessee, and I'm the only survivor of a death cult."

"What was the name of the cult?" Kyle asked.

"We called ourselves The Black Chapel."

"Why did you call yourselves that?"

"We did everything in an old-fashioned chapel that was painted entirely black," I replied. It had been so long since I talked about it, but the building, the pitch-black shade, flooded my mind. It was as if I could see it more vividly with each word that left my mouth.

"Not a lot of people have heard of The Black Chapel. Why is that?" Kyle asked as I kept seeing flashes of dark stairs, the deep creak the third stair would make if you stepped directly in the middle. The dark doors with the cracking paint and the brass handles. If I closed my eyes, I could swear I was there.

"It wasn't as well-known as others, mainly because we had a tiny membership of fifteen people," I answered. "We didn't really attract much attention, and the town we were in did their best to keep it a secret."

"It's true. Finding information on it isn't exactly easy," Shelby chimed in, looking over at Kyle. "They didn't court the same fanfare as something like Waco or Jonestown. They were just considered the weird hippie type until that night."

"So fifteen members, and you're the only survivor, correct?" Kyle asked as the familiar clicking of a keyboard sounded from Chuck's direction. He was typing furiously, and when I glanced over, he had a strange look on his face. "Fifteen total, including yourself?"

"I am the only survivor, yes," I answered.

"Why is that?"

"Because thirteen of them died in the chapel that night."

"Then what would have happened to the fourteenth?"

"He was—"

"Guys, the chat's reporting a strange hissing noise in the audio," Chuck interrupted. As I paused, the three of us turned to look at Chuck, who was still typing, his expression a mix of confusion and frustration. "One user, hannemanisgod, is describing it as if a walkie-talkie were underwater."

"Is it some sort of weird feedback from our mics?" Kyle asked, adjusting his microphone and moving his computer around to see if the noise was coming from him.

"No, I don't think it's coming from you, but I can hear it, too," Chuck said. "It almost sounds like a broken radio going in and out."

"Could we possibly be picking up a signal from somewhere around us?" Shelby asked.

"I mean, it's possible, of course," Chuck said, scratching his head. Kyle started to look down at his laptop, turning it to face Shelby and me. The three of us watched the screen. It was like watching a bizarre reflection of the three of us staring while live on camera. He pressed a button and turned up the volume slightly.

A walkie-talkie submerged underwater was a solid description. All the different sounds were muffled, each static hiss, crackle, and pop dampened to an almost inaudible level. "What the hell is that?" Kyle asked, before another sound fought through the other noises.

It sounded deep and warbled, as if someone were speaking through it. I couldn't tell what they were trying to say, but it was getting louder, as if purposely trying to break through the wall of inaudible hissing and crackling.

"Let me try something," Chuck said aloud, his voice echoing through the room and Kyle's laptop speaker. He started typing again, and suddenly it stopped. There was silence. "That's weird."

"What did you do?" Shelby asked. "Some of your tech magic?"

"No," Chuck responded. "That's why it was weird. I didn't do anything. It just stopped."

"Alright, well, I don't know what to say other than the show must go on," Kyle said, furrowing his brow as he turned his laptop back to face him. "So, Claire, you said thirteen died in the chapel that night, but one didn't. Can you elaborate on that?"

The feeling in my stomach returned, and my mouth went dry. I cleared my throat again and continued, “Uncle Earl shot Sherry outside the chapel.”

“Who is Uncle Earl, and why did he shoot Sherry?” Shelby asked.

“Uncle Earl was the most trusted among us. He told him he had to do it.”'

“Who did?”'

A tear rolled down my cheek. I could see him so clearly in my mind: those dark brown eyes that seemed to pierce your soul, that long dark hair that swayed in the slightest breeze, and his full beard with the streak of gray on his left cheek that he joked was a sign of ancient wisdom. "His name was Thomas Purcell, but we called him Father Aralu," I said, my voice trembling.

"He was the founder of The Black Chapel?" Kyle asked, oblivious to my tears. Shelby noticed my distress and showed concern.

"Give her a moment, Kyle," she said.

"It's fine," I said, still a bit choked up. "Yes, he was the founder of it."

"So his name was Thomas Purcell, but he wanted to be called Father Aralu, or something like that. Why?" Kyle asked, as I searched for words. How does one explain such an absurd thing?

"Because he believed he was an immortal sorcerer," I replied. "He thought he was centuries old."

"Did he have any history of mental illness?" Shelby asked as Kyle nodded in agreement. That is the general consensus that most people make about him. In the minds of the average person, it was the only logical answer for why someone would believe they were an ancient sorcerer.

"I don't know," I answered. "I don't think anyone knew much about him before joining the chapel."

"Tell us what life was like before that night, just paint sort of a picture for our audience," Shelby asked. "Was there always a hint that something like that night could happen?"

"No," I said. How do you tell people who only know the worst thing that until one somber fall night you never had any idea that the worst thing would happen? Would they believe you? 

"It was actually a pretty peaceful life."

"How so?" Kyle inquired.

"It was like having a huge family with you at all times. We spent summer days plucking fruits and vegetables from the crops while singing. We spent the fall planting hearty greens while chanting affirmations. Every night we ate together, while Father Aralu would tell us tales of his past lives."

“How did you join up with them?” Shelby asked.

"I was born there, in the berry field to be exact," I replied.

"You were born there in the berry field?" Kyle asked in disbelief. We had just gone over the circumstances of how I ended up joining, much less my birth that took place mere yards away from the black chapel. "So your mom and dad raised you there?"

"No, my mother died a couple of days after giving birth to me, and my dad had left the group months before I was born."

I paused and started to feel a burning sensation on my wrist. It felt like a sunburn pulsating after getting out of a hot shower. I rubbed my arm. It reminded me of that night, the pain, the surprise that something so awful could be done to me. "Who raised you then?" Shelby asked.

"Earl and Sherry raised me," I said as Kyle's eyes widened with excitement. This is what he wanted: the nitty-gritty of the story. My wrist started to feel more painful. It felt like it was radiating heat now.

"Guys," Chuck interrupted. My words and thoughts came to a standstill. Chuck squinted at his laptop's screen. "In the chat, a user going by PerfectDrug89 said to check this weird thing and posted a timestamp. They say they see something weird.”

"Is the stream quality okay?" Kyle questioned with a hint of disappointment in his voice, as I rubbed my arm. The pain had subsided. "We were just starting to get to the good part."

"Kyle!" Shelby chastised him. "Claire, give us a moment to see what is going on."

"What the fuck is this?" Chuck blurted out, his eyes glued to his screen as he kept clicking on his keyboard. "I just see this black blob on the screen when I go back to the timestamp."

"Is it still there?" Shelby asked. Chuck shook his head. 

"No, it's gone now. It disappeared a couple of seconds after the PerfectDrug person pointed it out."

 "Where was it on the screen, Chuck?" Kyle asked as he got up from his seat, walked over, and crouched down looking at Chuck's screen. He began clicking again, and the two watched silently for a moment. 

"It's only around her right arm."

"But it's gone now?" Shelby said, as I sat silently. The pain might have disappeared, but the knots in my stomach had returned. "Maybe we should start wrapping this up and we can pick it back up again tomorrow."

 "No way," Kyle said. "It was just starting to get good." 

"That's not up to you, Kyle," Shelby snapped as Kyle looked taken aback by the tone of her voice. He paused for a second before letting out a sigh and settling back down in his chair. He then locked eyes with me.

"You're right, Shelby," Kyle replied. "But I don't think it's your call either. Claire, what do you want to do?"

I didn't want to do it anymore. My stomach kept feeling sour. It felt like I was getting hot flashes, and my head started to throb. I wanted to rest and come back another day, maybe. But then the words left my mouth, almost uncontrollably. "I am fine. We can keep going, Kyle."

"Are you sure, Claire?" Shelby chimed in, her eyebrow curled slightly. I don't think she expected that to be my answer. Kyle gave me an approving grin as Shelby. "You don't have to feel pressured to do this today, Cla—"

“But I want to, Shelby,” I interrupted assertively. “I want to tell my story.” 

“So you were raised by Earl and Sherry, why them?” Kyle questioned. 

“Well, I told you Earl was his most trusted follower, and Sherry was the second to that. She was Earl’s wife also.” 

“He shot his own wife?” 

“Yes, and that was the event that caused all of it to unravel.” 

"How did it unravel?" Kyle continued to press. As in my mind, I relived the moment of Sherry's face recoiling in horror as she turned towards the door of the chapel. Her heavy footsteps fumbled across the nave's aged wooden floor. The shock on Earl's face was evident as he watched his wife, the woman he called the love of his life, pushed through those doors into the pastures outside, trying to escape.

"Earl shot her once, but she kept running, so then he shot her again, and she screamed from the top of her lungs. I've never heard anything so loud in my life, Kyle. Apparently, someone who lived on the road with us heard it, too. They called the Sheriff's department."

"Where were you, Claire?" Shelby chimed in. I took a deep breath. I closed my eyes and felt the cold wood on my back, my legs squirming trying to break free, and the look on Father Aralu's face. "What was happening while Earl was shooting Sherry?"

"This," I answered, showing my right wrist. The markings, deeply cut in the flesh, lay bare, obscure symbols from books of centuries past, deep wounds that after years have not healed. “I laid on the table bound to it while he cut these into me.” 

"Jesus, Chuck, can you get a close-up of that?" Kyle said. Everyone was silent as I presented my wrist to the camera for a moment. I let them soak it in before Kyle cleared his throat and continued, "So what happened after that?"

"Earl returned and stood next to Father Aralu. They started to hum in perfect harmony, all of them as he placed his hands on the side of my head. We couldn't just let Sherry undo all the preparations for the ceremony."

“Why not? They just killed someone.”

“Because it only works once every hundred years, Kyle.” 

“What does this ceremony consist of?” Shelby asked as Kyle leaned back into his chair. He tried to keep a straight and serious face, but I could tell he was fighting back a huge smile. This is what he wanted.

"It requires sacrifice," I explained. "As I laid on the table, I remember seeing the dim light reflect off the knives as they pressed them against their throats. But they kept chanting, even as the blood ran down their necks, dripping on the floor below.”

“Jesus christ.”

“Have you ever heard someone chant with their throat cut open?”

"I can't say I have," Kyle responded.

"It makes a weird gurgling noise. It loses the note that they try to use, and it gets really messy before they fall.” 

“I bet,” Kyle said uncomfortably. He sat up straight in his chair, a pause in his questioning, as if he was trying to search for what to ask next. Shelby also looked uncomfortable by my description. “So who rescued you?”

"Two deputies, I can remember hearing the doors to the chapel burst open and I saw two flashlights hit Father Aralu's face.”

"Then what happened?" Shelby said with a sense of dread on her face. We had talked about it, but I never went into this much detail. "Can you remember it, Claire?"

"I do. I remember feeling his blood hit my face from above me. They shot him in the head. He muttered something before he collapsed."

“What did he say?” 

“That all of us will live through the dark blessed child.” 

"That's when you blacked out, right?" Shelby said as both Chuck and Kyle's faces were stuck in shock and awe. I looked straight towards her and nodded. "Did you ever get to see the deputies again after that, maybe to thank them for rescuing you?"

"No, I never saw them again. A couple of weeks after the incident, they died." 

"How did they die?" 

"Deputy Miller, he was the one who fired the shot that killed Father Aralu. He was killed in a hunting accident. One of his friends accidentally shot him. Strangely enough, in the same spot that killed Father Aralu." 

"And the other one?" 

"Deputy Parker? He got run over at a traffic stop."

"That's wild that both of them passed so soon after," Kyle interjected as he looked down at his laptop. I could see a small, cracked grin on his face. My stomach recoiled again, and it felt more painful than the discomfort I was experiencing before.

"The chat is really popping off right now with a lot of questions," Kyle said, looking over at Shelby. My head felt like it was in a vice grip. I felt a high-pitched ringing in my ears. It kept getting louder and louder. They noticed it, too.

The two of them looked over at me. As I cleared my throat, "Sorry about that, but is this everything you wanted?"

"Thank you for telling your story, Claire," Kyle responded. "We're getting lots of great feedback on it so far." 

"You know no matter how successful the show is, it's never going to happen, right?" I blurted out suddenly and coldly. Kyle seemed taken aback by my tone. It surprised him, and to be honest, it surprised me, too. 

"What's not going to happen?"

“She’s never going to fuck you.” 

"Excuse me?" Shelby said, shocked. But another sound stopped everyone. The sound was coming from Chuck's table, the sound of vomiting. Violently and continuously. The sound of his bile hitting the table and dripping on the floor was actually pretty humorous.

"Chuck, are you okay?" Shelby said with concern. She got up from the table and hurriedly went over to check on him, but he continued to empty the contents of his stomach. "Chuck, what's going on?"

"It's her face!" he screamed, pointing at his laptop screen. "Look at it!"

"What's going on?" Kyle said, standing up in shock from his seat. The look of terror on their faces as they looked at the screen. Kyle looked puzzled until he looked at his own laptop screen. "Holy shit!"

"Don't be so rude. What's wrong with my face?" I asked as I felt a smile from ear to ear spread across my face, almost involuntarily. Kyle backed away from the table as I reached for Shelby's laptop, turning towards me.

"Oh, I see the camera can see the truth," I said with a laugh as I looked at the screen to see the skin from my face, a discolored grayish green, slowly melting down as if it were a candle to the flame. “Well, I say it’s time to call it a day.”

"Claire? What's going on!" Shelby cried out as Kyle ran over to join them, putting some distance between the two of us. I stretched out in the chair for a second, my joints and bones cracking with each motion. "Claire, what's going on? Talk to us!" 

"Claire is still here, all of us are still here. Hundreds of us," we said in unison, facing the camera and smiling for an audience who were frantically typing on the screen in bewilderment. 

"What do you want?" Kyle screamed out as we walked closer, each step sending a loud crack of joints croaking through the room. We placed our right hand on Chuck's laptop, blood oozing from the carvings on our arm, and said, "We want all of you to join us," before closing the laptop to end the stream.
