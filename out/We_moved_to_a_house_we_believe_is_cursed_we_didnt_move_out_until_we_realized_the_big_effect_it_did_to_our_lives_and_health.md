It was May 2020 and the pandemic just started. Everyone is on lockdown, but somehow my parents tried finding a larger house to move into since the apartment we currently lived in was a bit small, we are a family of 5 and my cousin and her baby just moved in with us so we needed a much bigger space. With extra precaution against the virus, my parents went house hunting and they came across this bungalow that is inside a family compound. It was obviously bigger, had more bedrooms and had a wide and open yard for our dog so we thought it was perfect, only when we got inside the house greeted us with a dark and gloomy energy. No one lived in the house for 2 years so the entire living room to the kitchen was dusty, the bedrooms have sketchy words written on it's walls. The one that creeped us out the most was the closet on my parents bedroom where cross, jesus, bible verses are written everywhere from the cabinets to the walls like straight out of a horror movie.

And just like any horror movie cliches, we moved in anyway. The first few months was okay, nothing sketchy and creepy really happened not until my niece's 1st birthday. On that very same day I brought home a orange kitten, but as soon as it stepped on the house's floor my dog thought it was a toy and he attacked it, causing it to die. And just a month later, my mom started having problems with her heart. She was hypertensive before, but she could handle it and can even bring herself to the hospital but this time she was weak and we even had to rush her to the hospital due to heart attack 2 times in the span of 3 months. Not only that, we adopted another dog who mysteriously started puking blood and eventually passed away. Also, when we were in our previous home we were financially stable and never really run out budget. But at this home, we started struggling financially for no reason. My dad's work was doing really great but we're always running out of money, my mom also lost her home based job. 

At that moment, we knew something was going on. 

We never really believe on ghosts, bad luck and stuff like that. But my mom eventually tried contacting my grandma who knew stuff about seances and rituals. In my country, old people have this ritual called "pagtatawas" where it attempts to diagnose an affliction or psychological disorder by interpreting shapes produced in water by heated alum or molten wax droppings from a burning candle. She tried doing it, and the shape that kept on forming was a mango tree with it's branches forming a Y shape. All of us had goosebumps when we realized that the same tree is just behind our house. Things got even weirder when my grandma asked if there was an abortion that happened in that house.

All of us just stared in horror, cause before we moved in we heard rumors from our neighbors about this house. Based on their story, the house was rented by prostitutes years ago. And one of them, aborted their unborn child and there were two versions on how she disposed the child. It was said that she flushed it down the toilet, or buried it beside the mango tree behind our house. The tenants who rented the house before us have their daughter who had a perfectly fine heart but mysteriously started having problems with it, they moved out immediately. My grandma explained that the unborn baby was trying to find a mother figure and couldn't cross to the other side and it somehow attached itself to my mom as soon as we moved in, that was the reason she started having problems with her heart. 

At first we were hesitant to believe it. Maybe it was just because of the stress that pandemic has caused. But it wouldn't go this far to give my mom two heart attacks in 3 months just because of stress? Also we can't just move out immediately, this house drained our money and we're only living on minimum wage at that time. The last 4 months we had left living on that hell, it was my dad who started having problems with his health. Both of my parents was weak and had compromised health, we lost two pets inside this house, my parents started fighting and arguing in a way we never saw before.

At that time we were starting to believe it. This isn't just stress, this is something else. My mom called a priest and an old woman to bless the house. When they got to the house, they were hesitant to come inside like they were scared. They did their thing, prayers, lit up some candles and stuff but left immediately. The old woman told us before she left, "there's lots of souls in here. not just the unborn child, there are old souls who lives here. if I were you, I'll move out". 

Sounds unbelievable and straight from a horror movie right? But believe me, she really said that. 

At Christmas, we were happily celebrating. And this bitch ass neighbor who's a family member of the owner of the house confronted us. He started blaming us for their misfortunes, and that ever since we moved in they also started having problems themselves. But we literally know the real reason he confronted us was because we were paying the rent to the owner instead of him cause he's a money hungry motherf\*cker and their family members chooses to celebrate and hang out with us more than him. We always had tension with that guy ever since he almost ran over one of our dogs that led to the poor dog have broken hips. They got into this huge argument with my parents that even got the police involved, thanks to that guy he just ruined our Christmas which is already miserable considering everything that happened to us inside that house.

My dad knew this was the last straw. He immediately told us to pack our things and we're leaving. We are never ever stepping inside of this house again. We stayed at my cousin's for a week. We were homeless until we found a decent apartment. As soon as we moved in everything was light. My dad is stable financially again, my mom got better and got multiple job offers from different companies. We are happy, stable again and just kicking it in our new home. I pass through that house everytime I go to school and I think it's fully abandoned now.

Looking back on that hell experience just gives me the chills. That could literally be a plot of a horror movie, but it isn't. It was real, and we are more than happy that whatever was in there, curse or what it didn't follow us.
