So you died, the pain finally leaves your body after agonizing minutes and you take your last breath on this miserable earth. The staggering shock that separates your soul from your body can be terrifying, a strange tingling in a part of your body previously unknown, and then for the first time in your life, you see.  
  
I've talked to some sinners who freaked out with the experience and sensation of being a spirit leaving their body, and to be honest, I don't blame them; it can be too much information to absorb all at once. But I've also heard of sinners who embraced the experience as if they had already gone through it countless times, which makes me wonder if all that spiritual bullshit about out-of-body experiences was really true, probably not. My money is on it being just excuses for poor souls to get high without society's judgment.  
  
Back to the post-death moment, as soon as you kick the bucket, you can know exactly where you're going. Some wise guys from the silver city theorize that sins committed in life accumulate like weight on our souls, and when we die, it all comes down to a simple question: Are you light enough to fly to the sky and join our benevolent, sadistic, and proud creator in his heavenly abode? Or, more commonly, are you so heavy with the mistakes and atrocities committed in life that you fall, fall beneath the earth, fall beneath the mortal plane like a shooting star and smash like a bag of shit in Gehenna?  
  
If you're reading the pages of this diary, I guess it's safe to believe that you're the second option.  
  
And since this is the case, welcome to the pit of misery, pain, and suffering we call Hell! Don't mind the mess, we didn't have time or consideration to tidy up the house for visitors.  
  
Just like you and all the billions of sinners scattered across the 9 circles, I've also been in your shoes a long time ago. Confused and scared, not understanding a damn thing and still processing, you know, the fact that those religious nutjobs were somehow right about the existence of a God, heaven, hell, and all that jazz. But don't put them on such a high pedestal, you wouldn't believe the number of 'good-faith Christians' down here with us.  
  
Don't despair, dear sinner, for in your stained hands lies your greatest chance of survival. In these dusty pages, I've kept all my experiences and rules, and if you're smart enough, you'll manage to use them well enough to last in your new home. But before you proceed, I want you to know one thing, the most important rule, the one you must never forget: **Never forget where you are.**  
  
If we ever meet, rest assured I'll be calling in that favor :)  
  
When I started writing this crap, it was just in a futile attempt to preserve my sanity and have some sort of hobby while hiding under the rubble of an old military base, so don't expect good temporal continuity. I wrote my rules as I remembered them, and when I had the patience for it, of course.  
  
Without further ado, welcome very much, squat in the cover of the nearest structure, and control your breathing well. You wouldn't want to be caught until you're sure what's waiting for you out there.     

***Rule number 6: Do not underestimate the intelligence of the voids.***  
My throat was itching like never before in my afterlife, my eyes were watering so much they blurred my vision, breathing was hard due to the heavy lungs, a sign of my growing fatigue. I wiped my snotty nose with my hand, the same irritated and scratched thanks to the constant rubbing of my glove. The leather mask making it difficult to breathe was the icing on the cake of misery; I needed to rest.

  
I crouched behind a small mound of rubble in an alley. I threw the heavy bag on the ground and collapsed against the wall, sweaty and with a throbbing pain in my back. I rested with my eyes and ears attentive, occasionally checking the small metal bar at my waist, listening to the constant dripping of infected water in the dozens of screwed-up and run-down buildings of the not-so-abandoned city.

  
I remember that on that day I was hungry; at that time, I was still unaware of the hedgehog pits and struggled to feed myself. For days, I had ventured into the red region in search of nutrients, and so far, I hadn't found anything.

  
The red region is the name sinners from the circle of Wrath give to the southwest region of the immense metropolis, a conglomerate of red fungi took over the region, spreading a deadly miasma in the air that slowly destroys your body, depleting your energy reserves in the first three days, devouring your muscles by the fifth day at most, and taking control of your brain at the end of the seventh.

  
The messed up thing, my friend, is that even after all that, you don't die. Your body becomes a shell, a void container full of this red crap, but even so, you are still conscious, trapped in the confines of your mind, forced to feel everything, witness everything, until someone takes pity and ends your suffering. And believe me, most of us will stay far away from your decomposed body; after all, what guarantee do we have that you would do the same for us?

  
But even with this risk, I was desperate, and if you're smart and know who to talk to, you can equip yourself well enough to resist the red miasma. Make no mistake, it still affects your body, but it takes a bit longer. At the time, I thought I would be quick enough, and thinking back, I actually was; my mistake was being dumb as hell.

  
Sweating like a pig, with my feet sore and my body suffering from the initial effects of the miasma, I was about to give up everything and sell my body in the north zone for a few bags of food when my alert ears caught a sound. With the agility gained from various nighttime attacks and robberies, I stood up with the backpack on my back, my hand around my knife, and waited.

  
Holding my breath, attentive and restless, I heard that strange wet sound once again, as if a fresh sack of greasy meat were being thrown on a table repeatedly. Leaning against the wall, I approached the edge of the alley, and using the reflection of my knife, I investigated the street.

  
In the middle of the street, I saw a void; what was once a man was now naked, skeletal with moldy flesh, tufts of red hair protruding from his mouth, eyes, and ears. The fingers of his hands were skinless, a mixture of exposed flesh and bones, tainted by the red curse. The poor bastard was at the mercy of the fungus, crawling in a random direction in search of nutrients.

  
For a moment, I made the right decision and turned to get the hell out of there, but then naivety knocked on the door, and I thought, "This thing needs to eat as much as I do, maybe... if I follow it, I might end up finding a goldmine!"

  
I don't even need to say it, I know exactly what you're thinking now; this was the stupidest decision anyone has ever made in all nine circles, and I agree, but when hunger, insanity, and fear inevitably take over your head, dear sinner, don't expect coherent actions from your part.

  
The damn thing moved slowly; now I realize it wanted me to follow it, and at the time, I did. Cutting through alleys and turning corners, descending hills and crossing apartments, without realizing I was venturing further and further into the red zone.

  
Soon everything was covered by the damned fungus; the structures were completely taken over, the miasma was so intense it was like a red cloud hanging over the entire place, but still, I continued, ignoring all the signs in my desperation. When the void finally stopped, we were in some kind of industrial area, with factories and parking lots taken over by the fungus, hidden by the miasma. Parts of voids stuck in dense conglomerates of that red crap and walls, garbage cans, and puddles of water.  
My head was throbbing, my thoughts clouded by a strange buzz, my eyes red from irritation. My skeletal arms trembled under the weight of my bag, the rotten smell covering the city, and it proved unbearable from the first step I took in that damn region, it didn't seem so bad at the time; I remember a sweet and faint fragrance in the air.

  
The void descended into a dark underground parking lot, and not so carefully I followed. The floor of that place was slippery, as if someone had just waxed it. The conglomerate covering the walls was different from the surface one; it was thicker, almost like skin, and pulsated at a constant rhythm. As I descended, I noticed the strange increase in temperature, which even in my altered state, I found strange, but the sight that greeted me as I entered the dark underground erased my doubts.  
In the center of the void parking lot, there was a collector.

  
In hell, there are few ways to get food; the strong and capable prefer to hunt newcomers for their meat, the experienced and cunning look for hedgehog pits, and the lucky ones find collectors. These strange creatures are like huge and fat birds, the size of turkeys. Their small wings prevent them from flying, but their strong legs, which look much like those of a horse, enable them to run at inhuman speed, and if cornered, their sharp claws can cut through metal like butter. But what makes them special, and gives them the endearing nickname, is their habit of collecting scraps of meat in their pouches, think of the kangaroo's pouch, to feed their offspring.

  
If you're lucky and find a mother collector, you'll have food for a good while.

  
In my extreme hunger, I approached with the knife in hand, and without the collector noticing me, I cut its throat and stabbed its belly several times.

  
Without finding it strange that it was alone so far from its natural region.

  
Without finding it strange that its leg was already broken, preventing it from escaping.

  
Without noticing the group of voids approaching from the darkness.

  
I was lynched by a dozen voids, roaring like madmen, punching, kicking, and dragging with a force impossible to have with muscles so wasted and limbs so rotten. As I cried out in pain and despair, I could only watch as they tore off my limbs and devoured my entrails.

  
When I woke up naked in the central region, I was grateful to have been killed before the miasma consumed me. Even today, I have nightmares in which I see myself as a void, wandering in the red region in search of sinners.  
  
Rule number 6: Do not underestimate the intelligence of the voids.  
  
**Bonus: Food never comes easy; if it does,** ***ignore it.***
