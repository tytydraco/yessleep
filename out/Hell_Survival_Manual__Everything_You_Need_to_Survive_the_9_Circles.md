I can't believe it worked.  
  
Those nuts from the silver city were right! Even a broken clock is right twice a day...  
  
For now, that doesn't matter, I'm free! Damn, how I missed the fresh air! Although things up here aren't exactly as I remembered.  
  
I still feel a strange weight in my heart; I can sense it, if I died now I'd go straight back to that place. I have to do everything to prevent that from happening, which means clearing the weight from my soul.  
  
I'm not exactly in a situation where I can help others; damn, I can barely help myself. For now I'm living in a homeless shelter while trying to find a job, which is kind of a hard thing to do when you don't have documents, or a history, or any kind of record. I mean, I did have these things once, but after I died I'm sure my dear wife with all her love and passion threw them in the trash.  
  
The library's wifi sucks, and this computer must be older than the concept of time, but it'll do, it has to.  
  
I stumbled upon this place while searching for experiences similar to mine. I have no idea if half of the accounts here are real, but I hope you believe mine.  
  
I escaped from hell.  
  
I still vividly remember the centuries I spent there, yes, centuries. Time seems to move differently when you die.  
  
I'm writing this here in an attempt to do a good deed and stay in the good graces of the man upstairs. Maybe by reading this, you'll decide to live a good life like monks in Sumeria, or donate all your belongings to the first charity that comes along, you know, become good people.  
  
But if for some reason you end up in that place anyway, let this serve as a quick guide of what not to do, and if you're lucky, survive hell and find a way out.  
  
I'm getting strange looks from the lady behind the counter; I better hurry up.  
  
I still remember the sensation upon waking up. One moment I was on the operating table, vision blurred, doctor yelling at the anesthesiologist, lights dancing. From what I could gather, the bastard had gone out to have fun a few hours before my surgery, clocked in not so sober and ended up screwing up the dosages, waking me up at the worst moment.  
  
A domino effect started, resulting in a massive loss of blood.  
  
When I came to my senses, I was dead.  
  
It was horrible; I feel claustrophobic just remembering it. It was as if I were trapped in a cast of cement covering my entire body. I couldn't see, I could barely breathe. A tremendous weight on my heart emerged, as if an anvil had been placed on my chest. I felt immense dizziness and an overwhelming sense of fear and shame.  
  
I wanted to scream, cry, anything to get me out of that prison.  
  
Something heard my prayers.  
  
I was ripped out of my body; that monument of flesh and bones was no longer necessary for me. I stayed still coming to my senses, watching the doctors desperately trying to save me, but it was futile.  
  
I felt watched, as if something was evaluating me from all sides. A primal fear rose up my throat as I collapsed into tears.  
  
Remembering it now, I think I finally understood; my soul knew exactly what was happening.  
  
And it could feel where I was going.  
  
I begged, screamed on my knees for one more chance, but how many billions before me had done the same? What reason did they have to listen to me? I felt like I was falling, I saw myself passing through the floor as I struggled to rise. I fell, lower than the deepest pit, lower than the earth, lower than this earthly plane. My hands tremble just remembering.  
  
I fell like a shooting star through a dark sky. A foul air filled my lungs as my eyes adjusted to the sight below me.  
  
Up here, we have many names for it: hell, abyss, limbo.  
  
Down there, they all call it Gehenna, the last city to ever exist.  
  
My first day in Gehenna was like those of many who came before me: I fell like a sack of shit into a pit of tar.  
  
Still in shock from it all I struggled trying to get out.  
  
That black goo is always as hot as Satan's oven, sticking to your skin, and if you don't get rid of it quickly, it can dissolve you in a matter of minutes. I fought until I was out of strength and sank, agonizing as if drowning in boiling oil, my screams of pain muffled by the pit until my last moments.  
  
For the second time that day, I died.  
  
Imagine my surprise when I woke up again, falling directly into the black lake.  
  
I don't remember how many times I suffered in that loop until I finally managed to escape, naked and with my legs red raw.  
  
Around me, collapsed buildings and filthy houses, uneven ground with sharp and jagged rocks everywhere I went, a black sky through which people fell constantly, and a foul air that weighs heavy and hurt to breathe. I could hear strange grunts, like those of a hyena.  
  
With fear gripping me, I followed my instincts and fled, running aimlessly with bare feet sinking into the ground towards the city. I could hear something following me, several things hunting me.  
  
They seemed to be enjoying the exercise. I don't know what was worse, not knowing where they were or what they looked like.  
  
In the distance, I could see what looked like the entrance to a subway.  
  
Without thinking, I ran, fear propelling my body, which only became heavier with each step. I could hear the panting of several creatures behind me, the flapping of wings and the cacophony of guttural laughter prevented me from looking back.  
  
The exhaustion was overwhelming, the pain indescribable. I stayed focused only on the subway; maybe I could lose them down there. With one last effort, I threw myself down the stairs and was embraced by darkness.  
  
I crouched behind a bench and covered my mouth,trying to control my breathing.  
  
With my eyes fixed on the stairs, I could clearly see the figure of the monster descending them. At first glance, its appearance reminded me of a skinless lion, but it was much larger than the king of the jungle. Its two pairs of eyes resembled those of a reptile ,jaw opened wide displaying two rows of uneven sharp teeth, wings like those of a raven, its four legs proudly displayed huge claws still stained with blood from its last hunt, and its tail was almost as large as its body, coated with a carapace and ending in a sharp point, reminiscent of a scorpion's stinger.  
  
I was too scared and tired to do anything other than be quiet and wait, hoping it would miss me.  
  
Too tired to realize that with its physique, catching a wounded prey shouldn't be difficult.  
  
Too tired to notice the dozens of others lurking in the darkness.  
  
Too tired to realize that I had been led to its lair.  
  
As I was massacred by the pack, I realized they were doing everything possible to keep me alive until the last moment, cruelty was ingrained in their nature.  
  
As I fell once again towards the pitch pit, I finally realized that every piece, every being in this place was made solely to agonize and torture, to cause pain and lamentation.  
  
As I died for the third time in the same day, I came to understand the true nature of hell.  
  
Eventually, I managed to escape from the pit and the pack of hunters, fleeing far from the city, away from the buildings, and collapsed at the entrance of a cave.  
  
Guess this is a good stoping point, It's almost time for my job interview; a former convict chef gave me a chance to work at his burger joint.It's not the best, but I can't afford to be picky right now.  
  
Hell holds many dangers; if you find yourself there upon death, go as far away as possible from the tar pitsâ€”it's the favorite hunting ground of the scavengers.
