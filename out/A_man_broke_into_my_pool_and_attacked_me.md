I (22M) have the best job a broke college student could ask for. Being a lifeguard is mostly easy work, it pays extremely well, and I can ask for time off as much as I want and my boss (42M) will almost never say no. I can also basically do whatever I want (within reason) because he needs all the guards he can get. As a student with afternoon classes, the only hours I can reasonably work are morning shifts, and lucky for me the pool opens at 6:00 in the morning. This meant I would have to get there at 5:30 sharp so that I could open the pool for all of the older folks who would get there real early.

I’ve worked this job since my senior year in high school, so I’ve been there almost 5 years, and I know how the place ticks. If I get there a little bit early, I get paid a little bit more, and my boss never even notices. So I always get there about 15 minutes early just to roll out a little extra dough. Nobody else on the morning shift seemed to mind this because I can get almost everything done that they would need to do in the morning before they even got there so I never got any complaints.

The morning chores were fairly simple, and there weren’t many of them in the first place. All I had to do was turn on the lights to the whole facility, check the chems in the main pool, and the baby pool, make sure the temperature of the pool was ok, and make sure the night shift guards didn’t miss any trash when they cleaned up the main pool area. 

Now before I get to the story, I’m gonna give a description of the layout of the pool I worked at because it’s an important piece. The light switches were all a couple yards from the main entrance behind a panel. The chems and temperature of the pool were all located in what we call “The Pump Room” which was all the way across from the entrance to the pool. The pump room basically had all of the pumps (obviously) and then a door to the back of the facility that no one ever used. The pump room was also right next to the guard room, which was where all of the lifeguards hung out when they weren’t up on stand. In the guard room, we had a small room with a deadbolt. I think it was meant to hold all of the electrical stuff, but we all just used it as a changing room, hence why there was a deadbolt. However, I should mention that the deadbolt didn’t do shit. It was a crappy one that my boss probably got from Home Depot that had the “Vacant/In Use” label on it which you could turn with your fingers on the outside if you put enough pressure on it.

One morning, I got to the pool at 5:15 as usual and started turning on all of the lights. It was always a little eerie to be in such a large area with all of the lights off, especially because if I fell in the pool I wouldn’t know which way was up because it was so dark. I walked over to the guard room to grab the key for the pump room, and left the key in the door like I always did because I would go in and out of the pump room a lot when I was opening. I checked the temperature, and then went back to the guard room to get the chem set. While I was in there, I sat down to check if my girlfriend had woken up or not yet, and when I picked up my phone, I heard the unmistakable sound of water sloshing around. Someone was in the building with me when no one else was supposed to be.

None of my coworkers would just immediately get into the pool without saying hello or even changing first, and I knew that none of my coworkers cared enough to get to work early. They were always late. With my phone in my hand, I quietly ran over to the changing room and engaged the deadbolt as softly as I could and then started texting my coworkers. None of them responded because they were probably driving. I didn’t know what to do, and I didn’t want to call the police in case it was just some confused elderly person who let themselves in. I know it was stupid, but getting the balls to actually call the police is harder than most people would think.

I waited there in silence for about 10 agonizing minutes just listening to this person swim, until they just got out of the pool. I didn’t hear any water sloshing anymore, but I wasn’t sure if that meant they had left or not. For all I knew, they could be right outside of the door, and the moment I opened it, they could attack me. Finally, I heard a door open and shut, and it turned out to be one of my coworkers. Christina (26F) knocked on the door of the changing room to let me know she wanted to change into her uniform and said good morning. She looked very confused when I walked out of the room with my regular clothes still on and asked me why I didn’t change.

I told her what happened and she immediately started to panic, thinking that the person might still be here. We rushed around looking for the person thinking they might be hiding somewhere, but we didn’t find the person. My coworker scared me half to death when I heard a short scream. I thought she had been attacked, but she had found something. She pointed out wet foot steps leading out of the pool and into the pump room. But the weird part was that the footsteps weren’t bare. They looked like the footprints a dress shoe would make, where it had the gap where the arch of the foot would be. We both warily walked into the guard room, but the footsteps faded away as the shoes dried. We couldn’t find the person in there anywhere and we were thoroughly creeped out. Obviously Christina believed me, as there were obvious footprints that couldn’t have come from me, but there wasn’t much we could do about it. The police would search just as thoroughly as we had, and it would all be a waste of time. We decided not to tell anybody so we wouldn’t freak anyone out and just went on with our day.

The next day, I was so scared to go back into work that I brought a pocket knife just in case. I was genuinely shaking before I was able to turn on the lights, but no one was there. A weight lifted off my chest, and I knew there was no one there today. I continued with my duties, but at the exact same moment as yesterday, I heard the same sloshing sounds as before. It made me jump, but this time I was somewhat prepared for this. I got the pocket knife out slowly, and crept to the edge of the doorway to take a peek. What I saw was absolutely horrifying. I saw a grown man in a fitted suit sitting at the edge of the pool and kicking his feet in the water like a little kid.

A gasp left my mouth before I could stop myself. I was expecting some disheveled homeless man. Maybe just a creepy smiling old lady. Even something paranormal, but not this. He turned his head the moment he heard me. He had a very serious look on his face. Like all the muscles were completely relaxed. Somehow that made it so much creepier. 

He quickly got up, and started running my way. I immediately ran into the changing room one more time and struggled locking the door. I thought he would catch it before it was locked, but he was too slow. I thought I was safe for all of 5 seconds until I saw the lock slowly turning back. I was frozen in fear, and I couldn’t move a single muscle. The door swung open, and I got the strength to lift up my knife, but not to hold it properly. He easily disarmed me, and turned my weapon against my neck. His eyes stared wide, but his mouth was still completely neutral like he was in a trance or something. 

Like a psychopath, he didn’t immediately kill me. He lightly dragged the knife across my neck, making deep cuts, but not deep enough to do too much harm. He was enjoying this, I could tell. Thank goodness I heard the main door shut at that moment. Christina finally got here. The man heard this as well, I could tell because he dropped the knife and ran.

I heard Christina let out a quick scream in surprise, and soon she was in the changing room with me. We called 9-1-1, and my boss, and my neck was all patched up at the scene. They weren’t bad enough to need to take me to the hospital, and I’m very grateful because there was no way I would have been able to afford that at the time.

Christina told my boss, the police and me that she saw the man run straight into the pump room. They thoroughly checked and found no one, but what they did find made a lot of sense. The door to the outside was mistakenly left unlocked, and nobody had noticed it because nobody ever used that door. He may have been coming in for weeks, and only made the noise when he wanted me to know he was there. I wish I knew why everything happened, or if they ever caught him, but I doubt it. I never heard anything else about it, but I still work there. However, I have started getting there about 5 minutes late to my shift. It doesn’t cost me anything, and I think my boss understands. I just hope that from now on, he locks that door.
