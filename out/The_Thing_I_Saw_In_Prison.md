Don’t know how long this will stay up, or if anyone will even read it. But I've had too much time to think. Some things eat you alive if you don’t let them out. I’m typing this from a questionably obtained phone, sitting in the dark. Because what I saw in here.... doesn’t feel like it belongs anywhere in this world.

I remember they brought him in on a transfer late one night. He was shackled like the rest of us, his name was read off and forgotten just as fast. He was thin pale and just felt... off. His eyes kept drifting, never fixing on faces or walls. He looked drugged out of his mind.

For the first couple days nobody really paid him any attention. In a place like this... that silence is safe. Most of the time at least. He’d sit on his bunk for hours barely breathing. The other thing that stood out was how little he slept how his eyes would snap open and dart around wildly at the smallest sound. It was odd, moving different directions and moving far faster than any eyes I'd seen.

By the third day the shaking started. Not like full convulsions but just this low tremor. Reminded me of my grandma and her epilepsy. People noticed but people always notice weird stuff. You learn fast not to ask too many questions.

Then came the blinking... it was rapid. Unnatural.... like his eyes were shorting out. Alot joked constantly he was possessed, and a lot of guys laughed. However an equal amount also kept their distance.

The night it happened... I knew it felt wrong from the start. The block was too quiet like everyone was waiting for something. I was laying on my bunk when I heard a sound I can never forget. It was wet and tearing, like stiff meat being slowly pulled apart. 

A scream followed sharp and high, and that’s when I looked across the block. His jaw was opening, stretching farther than possible. His jaw popped and rolled, like those nature documentaries of those snakes that unhinge their jaws. Skin split along the sides of his mouth, and something black pushed through. Slick like oil and moving like it had joints in too many places. Like every single point along its spine arms and legs were twenty jointed somehow.

It crawled out of him. Folding and unfolding itself as it dropped to the floor with a heavy wet thud. It was as if it was both solid and liquid. The man's hollow skin slumped backward, empty. Like a grain sack emptied and tossed aside.


The thing didn’t hesitate. It launched itself at the nearest guy. Wrapping itself around his face. There was this.... absolutely awful muffled scream and gurgle as he went down. The man clawed and scraped at his face as he fell back, blood rolling down the wall as he slammed into it. Sounded like a watermelon being stomped on. He just started shaking and then spasming.

That’s when I realized it wasn’t hurting him, or externally anyways. It was moving. Passing itself along. Testing out a new body.

By the time the guards came rushing in, it had already jumped again to another larger inmate. Batons and firearms were used as the alarms screamed, but it.... it didn’t care. The lights flickered, the power seemingly failing. It slipped away in the chaos somehow. When the lights finally came up... three guards were on the floor, tore to shreds. Arms looking shredded cheese or ground hamburger.

The next day they said it was drugs. They said.... it was a psychotic episode that turned violent. They scrubbed the floors over and over and over and moved people around like fuckin furniture. Anyone who talked too much got sent somewhere else. Solitary if I had to guess.

I tried to talk about it once, but was promptly beat within an inch of my life by the old hands. The message was silent but painfully clear. So I kept my mouth shut. I still do. That’s how you survive, right? But.... sometimes at night... I still see the blinking in other inmates. The little twitches and convulsions they try to hide, and my stomach sinks. Always makes my blood run cold. All the other old hands have died or disappeared and sometimes I think the guards know more.... that they allow it to run rampant.

I don’t know what that thing was, or where it came from. But I don't think it ever really left this place. All I know for sure is it wore a man like a god damn coat and discarded him when it was done. I don't think I'll ever sleep well again.
