Have you heard of a woman who carved out her own eyes because God said so? Yeah. I'm talking about the woman who was on drugs and did it out of psychosis. 

Well, that's what they said but that's not what I saw. I not only saw how she carved out her own eyeballs, but I was also beside her when that happened and I'm telling you, it's not because of drugs.

I was minding my own business, eating ice cream by the fountain, when a woman sat not too far from me. She was wearing a denim dress and a tattered sneakers, her black hair healthy and long. We met each other's eyes and smiled to acknowledge each others presence and went back to what we were doing. This girl was drawing something on her sketchpad and I don't know what it is but she looked so peaceful drawing it.

When I was done eating, I grabbed my bag on the ground and composed myself to walk away. I was never really good at leaving someone behind, even if it's a stranger, so I was actually building up my courage to say 'bye' and be on my way. But when I tried to call her attention, I noticed something strange. There was a hazy shadow behind this girl, shaped like a humanoid figure but not distinct. It's like the thing is here but when you focus on it, it's blurry and seems like a transparent figure, blending in the background.

Then suddenly, the shadow crouched down and whispered something in her ear in an erratic way. The shape of the shadow glitching and disappearing. When the shadow totally disappeared out of view, the girl froze, letting her pencil fall on the ground. I tried to talk to her but I got no answer. I waved my hand over her face, still no reaction so I decided to leave her. As I was about to leave, I unconsciously covered my ears when I heard the most blood-curling scream from the girl. Keep in mind we're only meters apart so it was sickening. I snapped my head to her direction and the girl was now standing and looking up to the sky, still screaming.

And in that moment, I knew I was going to remember this scene  forever. The black-haired girl, scooped her eyeball with her hands while laughing maniacally. I froze on the spot, not knowing what to do while she chewed on her first eyeball. Blood was gushing and dripping down her face when she was about to scoop her second one but the cops got to her real quick. You'd be relieved that her one eye was saved but I kid you not, she bit the other cop's arm and scooped her eye so fast and swallowed it. I think the cop was traumatized because he fainted when he looked at the eyeless human in front of him, laughing and giggling. The girl collapsed and eventually died from blood loss.

The people who witnessed it says that she was on drugs to rationalize what the woman did to herself but I know. I know that there are things out there that cause chaos for fun and part of their fun is playing with people's minds, making them do unimaginable things to themselves. I believe it because I've been noticing things in my apartment that I swear I consciously didn't do it but it was there anyways. Like buying cartons of meat and storing it in the fridge, feeling groggy for slitting my wrists, and I feel like it's whispering something to me right now. I just can't seem to understand it but I think I--
