I woke up to fog.

Fog is pretty common in our area. We live in a little valley and the fog just sort of pools here, especially in the early morning. But this fog… this was *different.*

For one, it was incredibly thick. When I let Tucker (our dog) out for his morning bathroom break, he sprinted into the backyard—and completely disappeared.

"Tucker?"

Our backyard is big, but not *that* big. I could hear him pawing around in the grass, but I couldn't see him—or the far side of the fence.

Of course, my kids loved it. "Cool!" Adrian yelled. "It's like we're living in a cloud!" Emma said.

I was less thrilled. I could hear the cars roaring by on the main road, less than thirty feet from our front door. But I couldn't see them. And, probably, they couldn't see us. “That's a *lot* of fog. Really dangerous to be driving right now,” I said.

"Reminds me of that time up in Maine," my wife started.

Ah, yes. The Maine fog story I'd heard a hundred times. That's what marriage is, basically: repeating the same stories to each other until one of you dies.

"It was like pea soup, and I…"

I pulled back the curtain and peered out the window. Okay, I could see the wind spinners ten feet from the door. And the outline of our row of privacy shrubs. And maybe, if I squinted… I could see the soft outline of the cars passing. But nothing beyond that.

"*Wham!—*I crashed into a tree. Well, it was a tiny one, little more than a sapling, really…”

I turned around. The kids were crowded around the sliding glass door with Tucker, watching the fog. They were ready to just jump out there. I wasn't sure I liked that.

"And even the tow truck couldn't find me!" Mary broke into laughter—she always did at the end of the story. I forced a laugh, too, pretending I was listening.

"Daddy? Can we go outside?" Emma asked, tugging at my hand.

"I don't know…"

"*Please?*"

"Fine. Okay." As soon as I opened the door, they rocketed outside. And disappeared. Sighing, I ran out after them, blindly maneuvering through the white.

Wait.

Where *were* they?

I stood in the backyard. Thick fog surrounded me. I couldn't see the back door anymore. I spun around, squinting at the hazy outlines of the picket fence, trying to orient myself. "Adrian? Emma?

"We're over here!" came Emma's voice, somewhere to my left.

I breathed out a sigh of relief and stepped to the left. And there it was—right there—Emma's and Adrian's playhouse. Weird. I'd been picturing myself more to the right, where Mary used to grow roses a few years ago.

"This is a house on top of a giant cloud," Emma proclaimed. "This is a flying scooter!" Adrian yelled, making *whoosh*noises as he pushed the scooter through the mud.

I sat on the damp grass, watching them closely as they played. Two hours later, the fog was as thick as ever. Usually in this area, the fog slowly dissipates as the sun rises.

But not this time.

At 9 AM, the fog was still a thick white blanket, obscuring everything that was more than twenty feet away.

And that's when I realized something else.

Our backyard faces a row of other backyards. The one three houses to the left has this pair of yappy little white dogs (don't ask me what kind, they all look the same to me.) Yapping away at this or that constantly.

This morning, they were completely silent.

*I guess everyone's inside.* Then I frowned. *Maybe they're inside for a reason. Maybe they know something I don't.*

I quickly pulled out my phone and shot a text off to a few of our neighbors. Five minutes passed, then ten. No one replied. Did a few Google searches with our town name and “fog,” “mist,” “weather.” Nothing about it online. I sat in the grass, watching Emma and Adrian play inside, idly twirling the phone between my fingers.  

Mary appeared out of the fog, her silhouette slowly darkening as she stepped towards us. “You want to take your morning run? I can watch the kids.”

“Uh, no. It’s too foggy.”

She quirked an eyebrow at me. “I thought you committed to exercising every day.”

“Yeah, but these are extenuating circumstances.”

“Fog? I could see rain, or snow… but *fog?”*

Dammit. I’d made Mary my accountability partner in getting fit, after chasing the kids for more than ten minutes would leave me panting for air. And she was not easy on me. “Fine,” I grumbled.

She smiled smugly.

I went inside and put on my workout clothes, then left. The fog was just as bad in the front yard as it was in the backyard. I crossed the driveway—then stopped.

*Huh?* Usually, when there was such thick fog like this, our cars would be covered in a thin coating of glistening mist. But today, they looked dry as a bone.

*Weird.*

I turned down the sidewalk and continued down, away from the main road. My pounding footsteps were loud in the silence. Houses loomed through the fog like colossal monsters, slowly fading into view.

Then I heard whistling. A clear melody, cutting through the fog. It took me ten more paces until I saw the source—old Mr. Frank Cambry, out working on his yard.

“Hey, Jared!” he called as he saw me.

I slowed to a stop. “Hey. What’s up with this fog, huh?”

“Oh. I don’t know.” He shrugged, then brought the pruning shear back up to the shrub. *Snip.* “We’ve always got fog.”

Frank was constantly working on his lawn. It was the pride of his home. Some men like their cars, or computers, or a man cave in the basement. This guy loved his lawn. His bushes were always pruned, his grass always a vivid shade of green, even in the fall.

But still. Working on the lawn in extreme fog? A little weird, even for him. Then again, I was the one jogging in it.

“It usually lets up by now, doesn’t it? It’s almost 10 AM.”

He didn’t take his eyes off the shrubs. *Snip, snip.* “I don’t know about that,” he said, noncommittally.

“And it’s really *thick* fog. Like thicker than usual. You don’t think it’s weird?”

“Nope.”

Then he started whistling again, as if to signal the conversation was over.

*Kind of rude,* I thought, glancing at him. Then I continued running, down the sidewalk, taking my usual loop around the neighborhood. The houses passed by me, all dark, all quiet.

I was about ten houses down when the whistling stopped.

It didn’t slowly fade away, like I’d expect it to as I walked out of range. And it didn’t cut off abruptly, either, as if Frank had decided to stop whistling.

No—it had quickly faded into silence. Like someone turning the dial down on a radio.

*Huh, that’s kind of strange.* But I continued running down the sidewalk, thinking nothing of it. It was so surreal—the houses across the street were blurred and washed out, gray silhouettes with no detail. Several feet in front of me, the sidewalk faded into white nothingness.

*Where the sidewalk ends.* Maybe in seconds, I’d be careening off the edge of the world, into a void of nothingness.

*What a happy thought.*

As I got close to home, the sharp barks of two yapping dogs jolted me from my thoughts. *Ah, finally, my old yappy pals.* I kept running, my legs aching, lungs burning—

And then I froze.

Just like the whistling, the barking stopped. A quick fade-out. Like someone turning down the dial of a radio.

My heart sank. *There is something really weird about this fog. It’s… muffling sound? What the fuck is going on here?* And I thought of Mr. Cambry. His rudeness about it all. *Does he know something I don’t?*

I sprinted back to the house. Ran out into the backyard, pulled Mary aside. “There’s something really weird going on. Let’s get the kids inside.”

“But they’re having so much fun.”

“Yeah, well.” I opened the playhouse door, reached my hand inside, and grabbed Emma’s arm. “Come on,” I said, pulling her gently. “We need to get inside.”

“Nooooo, I don’t want to!”

“Too bad. We need to—” I stopped. “Emma. Where’s Adrian?”

“I don’t know.”

“Mary! Where’s Adrian?”

“I thought he was in the playhouse with Emma.”

“Well, he’s not!”

“He’s got to be in the backyard,” Mary said, plainly. “That’s why we have the fence.”

“He knows how to open the gate. You know that!” How could she be so calm?! “Adrian? Adrian, where are you?” I shouted.

My heart dropped as I whirled around, searching for any trace of him. A muddy trail from scooter wheels. Footprints. A little silhouette. But there was nothing—only fog. Adrian was only 4; he didn’t have the sense that Emma had. The sense not to talk to strangers. Or walk into the road.

Oh my God. The road.

Cars roaring by, in thick fog, that wouldn’t see him—until it was too late.

I ran blindly through the white, up the side yard. The gray silhouette of the gate slowly faded into view.

*No.*

It was open.

“Adrian!” I screamed. “Adrian, where are you? Come back here! Right now!”

Oh, God. The fog made this impossible. He could be running into the road right now, and I wouldn’t know.

“Adrian!” I screamed, running wildly.

And then—just like the whistling—a sound faded into my ears.

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

My heart dropped. “Adrian!” I screamed, running towards the sound.

The silhouette slowly came into view. Adrian, at the far end of our front yard. Standing in the corner between the side of the house and the picket fence.

Slowly bashing his head into the fence.

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

“Adrian!”

He took a step. Smacked his head into the wooden fence. *Thump.* Feet slid back in the mud. Took another step. *Thump.*

“Adrian!” I grabbed him by the shoulders and pulled him away. “Why? Why are you doing that?”

He looked at me blankly. There was a swollen lump on his forehead, already darkening with a bruise.

“Adrian?”

He broke eye contact. “I don’t know,” he muttered to the ground.

“Were you trying to hurt yourself?”

“No. I was... trying to get back to you and Emma and Mommy.” His lip quivered. Then he threw his arms around me and squeezed, holding on tight. “But I… I got lost.”

*Got lost? In the fog?* I glanced around. The fog was bad, but clearly he could see the fence a few feet in front of him. Him repeatedly smacking into it was deliberate.

“It’s okay, Adrian. It’s okay. Do you want to go inside and get some chocolate milk?”

He nodded.

I walked him back inside, holding his hand tightly. Reassuring him that everything was okay, that it was all better now.

But everything was definitely *not* okay.

 

\*\*\*

 

The fog was still there when the sun set.

The four of us sat around the dinner table, eating quietly. Not much to say. Emma was still sulking about outside playtime being cut short, and Adrian just looked around with a listless, empty gaze. My wife attempted to fill the void with rambling conversation a few times, but it never picked up. 

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

That horrible sound repeated in my head. Over and over again. Adrian was a wacky kid, and he didn’t always look out for his safety. He was fond of doing risky things, like jumping off the sofa, spinning in the office chair, climbing on things… but I’d never seen him *intentionally* hurt himself.

*Thump. Thump. Thump.*

And the dazed look in his eyes, when I’d stopped him. It was like I’d woken him from a trance. He was trying to get back to us, and he’d gotten lost in the fog? So he decided to pound his head against the fence, over and over?

I shuddered and pushed my plate of pasta away.

“You’re done?” Mary asked.

“Yeah, I think so.”

“Wow. Nobody feels like eating tonight, huh?”

“Can I go play with my dolls?” Emma asked.

“I want to go, too,” Adrian added.

“Five more bites. Both of you,” Mary said, pointing her fork accusingly. Then they ran off, and it was just the two of us, clearing dishes from the table.

“Everything okay?” she asked, plunging Emma’s Frozen dish under the faucet.

“Yeah. Just… shook up from the whole Adrian thing earlier.”

“Sure.” She grabbed the sponge. “That kind of behavior is common, though, Jared. Some kids bite themselves or bang their heads to cope with emotions or get attention. He’s only four. He’s still got a lot to figure out.”

“Yeah, I guess.”

That was another thing that bothered me. Mary seemed so… calm… about everything. About the fog, about losing Adrian, about him banging his head. Years ago she’d been the other way, worrying about everything. When she was pregnant with Adrian, we’d gotten news that something looked wrong on the ultrasound. In the end, everything was fine—but for the few weeks we didn’t know, Mary was an absolute wreck.

And now, she didn’t care?

I grabbed Adrian’s dish and hit it against the side of the trashcan. Fat rigatoni pasta slid off and fell into the garbage with a goopy *splat.* I slid the plate onto the counter and turned around.

I froze.

Emma’s Frozen dish was lying shattered on the floor. Elsa’s face split right in two. And next to it, lying on the kitchen floor… was Mary. One arm splayed out, the other tucked across her chest. Dark liquid seeping into her pink dress, dripping down from her face.

Her eyes wide. Blank. Unseeing.

“Mary. Oh, my God, Mary?”

I dropped to my knees. Reached for her shoulder. “Mary, what happened, what—”

“Jared?”

I whipped around.

Mary was standing behind me. Holding the Frozen dish. “Are you okay?” she asked, extending a hand to help me up off the floor.

I looked down.

There was nothing in front of me. My hand was touching empty tile.

“Uh. I’m… I’m fine,” I stuttered. I grabbed the next plate off the stack and plunged it under the sink, my hands trembling.

*What the fuck just happened?*

*Did I just… hallucinate… my wife being dead?*

I glanced out the window. The fog blanketed the entire backyard, thick and heavy. I could barely see five feet into the backyard. I shuddered.

And then something clicked.

“Mary, um… do you think it the fog… isn’t really fog?”

She looked up at me. “What do you mean?”

“Could it be some sort of smoke? Or spillover from the power plant? Or… some sort of gas?” My voice was hurried, now. Frantic. “Something that messes with our minds? A drug?”

She gave me a weird look. “Uh, no. I think it’s fog.” She reached over and shut the sink off, then slid her plate in the drying rack.

“But—but, um, Adrian’s acting so odd, and—” I hesitated, then decided not to mention what I’d just seen. “Well, I’m not feeling so great, either.”

“It’s just fog. You’re worrying about nothing.” She smiled at me, then walked out of the room.

I stared out the window. The fog hung in the air, thick as ever.

 

\*\*\*

 

I sat in the rocking chair.

Emma was on the floor, drawing pictures with Adrian. Mary’s head rested on my shoulder, as she read some thriller.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about what I’d seen. There’s a reason why I didn’t tell her about it—a good one.

A few years ago—I don’t even remember exactly when it was, now—Mary and I weren’t in a good place. I’d lost my job, been unemployed for several months, and was turning to alcohol. Some nights I’d just drink myself silly in the study all night. Usually, nothing came of it. The worst I’d do is piss myself and fall asleep. Embarrassing, sure, but nothing more.

But there was that one night…

The kids were at her parents’ for the weekend. I’d decided to stay home drinking instead of going with her to a friend’s dinner party. She came home late. Like 1 AM. Later than just a “dinner party” should go. She’d lost the cardigan, too, revealing her strapless dress.

By that time, I was the worst sort of drunk. Drunk enough to let my temper get the better of me, but not drunk enough to be sloppy and incoherent.

I accused her.

*“You were with Brandon, weren’t you?”*

*“Jared, you’re being ridiculous. We’ll talk in the morning.”*

*“Don’t lie to me!”*

*“I’m not! You’re drunk and acting out. Leave me alone.”* She walked towards the kitchen. I followed her—and got a whiff of what I thought was cologne, in my altered state.

*“For God’s sake, I can smell him on you!”*

*“Jared, stop it!”*

And then I said them. Those four little words, that shattered our marriage in an instant.

*“I’ll fucking kill you.”*

My lowest moment. Drunk, depressed, and threatening the person I love the most. I would give anything to go back in time and take it back. Believe me. And every moment of my life since then has been me working to correct it.

But it still bothers her. Sometimes when we have a bad fight, she brings it up and starts to cry. Sometimes, when I move quickly or unexpectedly towards her, she flinches a little. A lot of marriages have a stain like that. An awful moment, a betrayal, a break of trust. And no matter how hard you try to wash it away, the stain is always there.

So, no. I wasn’t going to tell her that I’d hallucinated her being dead.

I rocked slowly in the chair. It squeaked under my weight. Emma giggled, and Adrian colored furiously, his crayon scratching against the page. Mary linked her arm with mine, smiling up at me.

The fog. It had to be some sort of chemical, messing with our minds. Making us hurt ourselves—like Adrian. Making us hallucinate. Because I’ve been a drunk, I’ve had mental health issues, and I’ve been a total fucking mess.

But I’ve never *hallucinated* anything in my life.

I glanced out the window. The fog hung thick and heavy in the air, obscuring everything more than a few feet past our windows. We were like an island, just the four of us here in a house disconnected from everyone and everything, among a sea of roiling fog.

Alone.

 

\*\*\*

 

I sat on Emma’s bed. Adrian had already fallen asleep, but Emma needed her quota of bedtime stories before she would even *think* about sleep.

“Can we read the Frozen one, Daddy?” she asked.

“You always ask for that one.”

“It’s my favorite.” Then she lowered her voice to a whisper. “Daddy? Is Adrian okay?”

*Dammit.* I’d tried to be so quiet when I talked to Mary about it. But Emma must’ve heard. I swear, sometimes I think this kid has supernatural hearing.

“Yeah. He’s going to be okay,” I whispered back. I smiled at her, tucked a blonde curl behind her ear. “I promise.”

And then I started the story, because I didn’t want to answer any more awkward questions. Of course, she had more for me.

“Why is it so foggy?”

“I don’t know. The weather, I guess.”

“It’s weird.”

“I know.”

“Can I play outside tomorrow? Even if it’s still foggy?”

I paused. “I don’t know.”

“Okay.” She squeezed my hand. “Will you get Mr. Snuggles for me?”

“Sure, sweetheart. Where is he?”

“In the playhouse.”

I hesitated. “He’s in the playhouse? Outside?”

“Yes.”

I glanced out the window. The fog was still there, diffusing the moonlight, making the night look lighter than it actually was. The streetlamp in front of our house floated among the silhouettes of leafless trees, surrounded by a wide halo.

Strangely, I couldn’t see any of the other streetlamps—even though they were only several feet away.

“I’ll get him for you tomorrow.”

“But I can’t fall asleep without him.”

“Why did you bring him in the playhouse?”

“We were having a tea party.”

I frowned, sighed, hemmed and hawed.

“Pleeease?”

“Okay, okay. I’ll be right back.”

I went out of her room and walked down the stairs. Then I was standing at the sliding glass door, staring outside. The fence extended on either side of the backyard, disappearing completely into the white. The grass, too, just faded away. Like our backyard didn’t even exist. No sign of the playhouse. Tucker lifted his head sleepily from the dog bed, staring at me.

*Am I really doing this?*

Ugh. My head was pounding, and I was *so* tired. But I had to do it, for Emma. Enduring her resisting sleep for an hour or crying would be way, way worse.

I opened the door.

Outside, it was silent. Not quiet—absolutely silent. No rattling of branches, no quiet murmurs from the houses next door. The air was cool against my skin, but it didn’t have that heavy feeling of humidity. Which was weird, considering the air was probably mostly water vapor at this point.

I continued blindly into the fog. After a minute, I found the fence. *Okay, good. I can use this.* I walked forward, one hand trailing along the edge.

And then I saw it. The peaked roof, the faux shingles, the little cut-out windows. I crouched down next to it, pushed the little door open. The hinges creaked. I ducked my head, turned on my phone’s flashlight, and peeked inside.

A soccer ball. A plastic pot. A toy car. Lots of dirt and dried leaves. And Mr. Snuggles, sitting next to a dirty teacup.

“Ugh.” I contorted and grabbed the stuffed animal. Then I got up, stretching to my full height, and looked around.

*Which way is the house?*

I wasn’t even sure. I took a step away from the playhouse, then two. I couldn’t see a damned thing. I took a deep breath, breathing in the weirdly non-humid fog, and searched for the fence. *Ah, there.* So just walk parallel to it…

My foot snagged on a root. I tumbled forward. My arms flailed out in front of me.

I was at the tree—*further* from our house. “Look at you. Lost in your own backyard,” I muttered to myself.

And then I stopped.

There was a small hole in the tree, right under the branches. The kind of hole that birds might build a nest in. An irregular shape, with the bark hanging over it in a point at the top. I’d noticed it a few times, when hanging our birdfeeder or playing outside with the kids.

But here on the ground, I saw that there was another hole. Right at the bottom of the tree.

It was the exact same shape.

I pulled myself up. Looked at the hole near the branches, then down at the hole at the base. There was no mistaking it—they were the *exact same hole.*

“What the fuck?” I whispered.

I paced around the tree, examining it closely. And then I saw it. A third hole, right in the middle of the tree. The exact same shape.

I didn’t know what to do.

So I turned around and began to run.

Towards where I thought the house was—but I couldn’t be sure. Everything was a sea of white. I couldn’t see the playhouse, or the fence. I was running blindly.

Then I saw the light.

Our floodlight, dimly shining through the fog. I clawed my way up and stumbled through the grass, onto the patio. I grabbed the glass door, wrenched it open, and stumbled into the kitchen. Turned on the faucet, splashed water on my face.

“Are you okay?”

Mary’s voice, from behind me.

“Yeah. I just… I got lost out there. Kinda scary,” I said, turning towards her. “But I got Mr. Snuggles, and that’s what—”

My breath caught in my throat.

Blood. All over her fucking face. Trickling over her left eye and down her cheek, as if she were crying blood. Dripping down her chin and onto the floor. *Tap, tap, tap.* I could hear it hitting the tile. Rhythmically. *Tap, tap, tap.*

And on her forehead… a horrible wound.

Like someone had bashed in her skull with a hammer.

“Oh my God, Mary…”

“What?”

And then it was gone. Just like that, *snap,* it was gone. And she was staring at me, with her large eyes and pretty little mouth, looking at me with concern.

“I…” I let out a shuddering breath. “Nevermind. I’m going upstairs. Emma’s waiting for me.”

 

\*\*\*

 

I woke up at 6 AM the next day.

I ran over to the curtains, hoping to see the road. The sidewalk. Our neighbors across the street. But when I pulled them back, all I saw was fog.

“Mmm,” Mary groaned sleepily. “What time is it?”

“A little after six.”

“Okay.”

I stared out the window. The fog was slowly lightening from deep gray to a haunting blue, pierced only by that one streetlamp. Our front lawn was quickly subsumed by the fog, falling off only several feet from the front door.

I walked back to the bed.

“I think we should do something. This isn’t… normal.” I turned to her, squeezing her hand.

“You’re right,” she started. “I think we should—”

And then she just stopped.

No. She didn’t *just* stop, like she lost her train of thought.

Her entire face was frozen. Her body was still. Her hand was limp in mine. “Mary? *Mary?”* I shouted. Grabbing her. Shaking her. Looking into her eyes. But they were totally blank. Empty. Lifeless.

Like I was looking at a doll instead of a person.

“*Mary!”*

She jolted into motion.

“*Call-some-neighbors-and-see-what-they-think.*”

She said the words fast, slurring them like she was drunk. Then she just sat there, smiling at me, like nothing was wrong.

“Mary. Oh my God… are you okay?”

“Of course I’m okay,” she said, brightly.

“No. You just…” I faltered, trying to pick out the words. “You froze up. It was awful. I thought—I thought maybe you were having a seizure, or—”

“Jared, what are you talking about?”

“What you just did!”

“I didn’t do anything.”

“What, you’re saying you forget what happened *thirty seconds ago?!”*

“Jared, please. You’re acting crazy.”

“No, I’m not! The rest of you are acting fucking crazy!” I stood up, backing away. “Adrian, smashing his head against the fence. You getting all paralyzed for a second. And me… I’ve been seeing things, Mary. I didn’t want to tell you. There’s something in this fog—or maybe the fog itself is something. A chemical, messing with our heads. But you think I’m crazy, don’t you?”

She averted her eyes.

And that gave me the answer I needed.

I went into the bathroom and slammed the door. Splashed water on my face. Then I just stared at myself in the mirror.

And something clicked.

What just happened to Mary conjured up a clear memory. A memory of playing Skyrim for the first time on my old laptop, with the terrible RAM. An hour into play, the main character freezing up, and then suddenly shouting out the words at double-speed.

That’s exactly what Mary did, just now.

I watched the water drip off my face. Heard them plummet into the sink. *Tap, tap, tap.* But I just stood there, my hands growing numb against the cold counter.

*Could it be?*

Another memory flashed through my mind. A memory of playing Minecraft with Emma. *“Daddy! Daddy!”* she said. *“I don’t want the computer to keep freezing up!”*

*“You’re flying too high, that’s why. The computer can’t keep up, rendering all those mountains and valleys in the distance.”*

*“Can you fix it?”*

*“Sure.”*

I went into the settings. Changed the “Render Distance,” so that the computer would only show the landscape within fifty blocks of the player.

And that’s when the game took on the appearance of thick fog.

*No. No. It can’t be…*

But the memories were coming faster, now. The bark on the tree, with that same damned hole. Like a repeating texture had been plastered all over it. Adrian smashing his head into the fence. Like an NPC that had gotten stuck in a corner. Mary repeating the same story about the Maine fog.

What if they weren’t people?

What if they were just sets of code?

“Daddy? Daddy, where are you?”

Emma’s voice. Coming through the door. I backed away. Tears burned my eyes, and I turned away trying to hide it.

“Jared, are you okay in there?”

“Tell her to go away. Please.” My voice trembled.

“Jared?” When I didn’t reply, I heard her muffled tones. Then the scattered footfalls of Emma, skipping away.

I pushed the door open. Mary sat on the bed, eyes locked with mine. She offered me a small, sympathetic smile.

"Mary."

"Yes?"

I opened my mouth, struggling to say the words. To get the confirmation I needed. I didn’t want it to be true. But I had to know.

I had to.

"It's so foggy out," I whispered.

She paused. Blinked.

And then she started.

"It's like that one time in Maine! It was so foggy, I..."

*No, no, no.* I opened my mouth, fighting back the urge to cry.

“Jared, what—”

"Do you even love me?" I stepped towards her. "Do you even know who I am?"

"Of course I love you, Jared.”

"You're only saying that because that's what you're *programmed* to say! Dammit, don't you understand? You're not real! None of this is!”

She stared at me.

And then her face began to change.

Her flesh flickered, like a malfunctioning TV. Then it rippled, as if made of putty. She slowly stood, took a step—and then she was right in front of me.

Blood dripped down her face. Her neck hung strangely to one side. Her arms were stiff, hanging limply at her sides. And she wore that pink dress, the one she was wearing on the kitchen floor, the one she wore when she went out with her friends that awful night.

“Jared…”

I turned and ran. Down the hallway, into Emma’s room. I crouched down next to her, brushing her face, tears running down my cheeks. “Emma. Emma, please…”

Her eyes snapped open.

And then her face rippled, just like Mary’s had.

“No. No, no, no.” I backed away. My foot hit something solid, and I whipped around.

*Adrian.*

He stood behind me. Totally stiff. Hazel eyes staring blankly into mine. “No, please…” I started down the stairs. The tile floor rose up below me, freezing into a pixelated mess. The stairs began to stretch and buckle.

I lost my balance and pitched forward.

Then there was only darkness.

 

\*\*\*

My eyes snapped open.

I was sitting alone in a small room. Three white walls, the fourth floor-to-ceiling darkened glass.

In front of me stood a desk. A computer sat on it, the screen black. Several wires trailed up from the ports, leading up from my head.

*What…*

I heard whispers. Coming from somewhere. Thought I heard the words *he’s awake,* coming from the other side of the glass. Saw shadows shifting and moving. Too dark to make out well.

“Jared Donahue,” a voice said, through unseen speakers. “Do you remember why you’re here?”

Emma, Adrian, Mary… their faces swirled in my head, foggy and distant. Sharp pain throbbed through my head. I glanced at the computer, then the desk, then my hands.

My hands.

Attached to the table with handcuffs.

Pain jolted through my skull. The fantasy suddenly evaporated, and the memories came rushing back. All of them. Tears burned at my eyes, and I began to cry.

“You remember, don’t you?” the unseen voice said.

*“I’ll fucking kill you,”* I’d said to Mary. On the worst night of my life.

But it didn’t end there.

The memory of what really happened played in my mind, as vivid and horrible as if I were doing it all over again. After saying that, I’d charged into the garage. Grabbed the hammer on the worktable. I found Mary in the kitchen, facing the sink, eating some crackers on Emma’s Elsa plate. She whipped around, eyes widening. But it was too late.

I brought it down on her head.

The plate shattered. The body fell. Blood everywhere.

My entire world—gone.

“Jared Donahue. For killing your wife, Mary, you have received the Life Penalty,” a voice said through the speakers. “You will continue to see the life you could have had on our computers. And then—every day, when we unplug you—you must come to terms with what you’ve done. All over again.”

I stared out into the darkened glass. I could barely make out the faces, but among the crowd, I thought I saw two teenagers standing together. A boy with hazel eyes and a girl with curly blonde hair.

“Emma? Adrian?” I whispered.

They didn’t acknowledge me. They just stared, eyes burning with hate as they looked at their mother’s killer.

I stood in front of the window, staring out at the fog that had rolled in overnight. Emma pressed her face to the glass, and Adrian was whispering “oooooh” over and over again. Such sweet kids.

“That’s a *lot* of fog out there,” I said, as I took a sip of coffee.

Mary looked up at me and smiled. "Yeah. Reminds me of that one time up in Maine.”

Ah, yes. The Maine fog story I'd heard a hundred times. That's what marriage is, basically: repeating the same stories to each other until one of you dies.

I sat down, took another sip of coffee, and [listened.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)
