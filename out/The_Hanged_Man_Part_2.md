[Okay, so I should’ve told you about Tara.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14u4txz/the_ghost_girl_part_1/) Honestly, I was positive she wouldn’t turn up. And my post was already long as it is. And I’m not exactly proud of how I behaved back then.   
  
Tara, as you may have gathered, was the third person referenced in the rhyme. She only joined our friendship group a month or two before Joanne disappeared. I’d never quite gotten the story about her social fall from grace, as Joanne and I were quite literally the last people in the school anyone would think to share any gossip with and Tara refused to talk about it.   
  
Yet there she was, at our table, one Tuesday lunch time, every eye in the room trained on her. She took a deep breath, as if resigning herself to what she was about to do, and plonked herself down without even asking if it was okay. Not that we minded. At the bottom of the barrel, there was always room for more.   
  
She was already stood in front of the oak tree when I turned up, her coat zipped all the way up to cover her mouth and her hood pulled tight over her head.   
  
“Matty? Where’s Joanne?” Her eyes darted around wildly.   
  
“Dunno, I just got here. I’m surprised to see you.”  
  
In the short time they knew each other, Joanne and Tara had never exactly clicked, and so her disappearance didn’t affect Tara in the same way it did me. Tara’s dry sense of humour was lost on Joanne who had a tendency to take things literally. And Tara would never let her defences down long enough to find out how perceptive, caring and genuinely warm Joanne could be.   
  
They both made an effort with each other, in their own ways, but it was like they could never quite match up. They were ships passing in the night. Radios tuned to different frequencies.   
  
Joanne invited Tara on our ghost hunting expeditions and Tara sometimes politely accepted, despite clearly finding the whole thing silly and childish. Tara pushed for us to do other things together, and Joanne sometimes politely accepted, despite not being comfortable at roller discos or shopping centres.   
  
There was nobody at fault but both girls were much more comfortable when the other wasn’t around. Trying to get them to connect was like trying to push the same poles of two magnets together.   
  
This was not at all helped by the fact that I was attracted to Tara from the moment she sat down at our table. And as a young boy with all the hormones, I confess that I probably prioritised her when it came to making plans. Joanne never said anything to me about it, but our relationship became slightly more distant in the weeks before she disappeared, and, although I selfishly pretended otherwise, I knew that she was hurt that I wasn’t spending as much time with her. The walkie talkies had been an olive branch of sorts. Of course, if I’d known I’d never see her again, I would have done a lot of things differently.   
  
“I didn’t want to come,” Tara said,  
  
“You got the letter too?” I asked.   
  
“And the rest.” She bit her lip, still looking around as if Joanne might sneak up on us. I didn’t want to ask what ‘the rest’ was, but I sort of understood. The letter alone would not have been enough to get me to come here today. Tara was a sceptic too. Whatever her walkie-talkie incident had been, it had shaken her up.   
  
“How long shall we wait?” I asked.   
  
Tara ignored my question. “I don’t even remember it. Promising a reunion. Do you?”  
  
“Vaguely,” I said.   
  
I actually remembered it quite well. Joanne wanted us to make a blood oath but Tara was scared of blood so we used spit instead. It was pretty gross. We stood by the oak tree, which by then was lightly moistened with our saliva, and promised that we would meet up when we were adults, right here.    
  
“Well where the fuck is she?” Tara was now shifting her weight back and forth nervously.   
  
We’d chosen the oak tree back then because of one of Joanne’s favourite ghost stories; The Hanged Man. According to legend, a little boy used to play and climb on the tree. One day, he ignored his father’s pleas to come down and so his father followed him up the tree and a chase ensued. When the little boy fell to his death, the father was overwhelmed with grief and hanged himself from the same tree three days later. Apparently, the hanged man entices small children to climb the tree and pushes them to their deaths.   
  
There were no records whatsoever of any children dying on the tree, so the Hanged Man clearly wasn’t doing a good job, but the tree made a perfect spot for a ghost story, and, apparently, a reunion.   
  
We waited for a few more uncomfortably cold minutes in an awkward silence, before I asked, “Shall we just go home?”  
  
But Tara wasn’t listening. She was staring ahead. “They made a playground,” she said, nodding at the slide, swings and climbing frame ahead. “It used to just be open space.”  
  
“Yeah…”  
  
“Let’s go on the swings,” she said.  
  
“No thanks.”  
  
“You’re scared?”  
  
“Nope. I’m a grown up.”  
  
She ignored me and walked over to the swings, but instead of sitting on them, she just stared ahead blankly. I followed behind, leaving a bit of distance between us, lest she took my following her for enthusiasm.   
  
“Morning Mr. Magpie. How’s your wife and children?” she said, her hand raised in a salute.   
  
“Thought you weren’t the superstitious type?” I said.   
  
“Morning Mr. Magpie. How’s your wife and children?” Tara repeated.  
  
“There’s not even a magpie there, Tara. Seriously. I’m going home.”  
  
She turned around to face me then and I saw her face had gone pale and her eyes glazed over slightly. Then, without even a glance at me, she jumped on one of the swings and started swinging. Higher. Higher. Faster. Faster.   
  
“A drop of Nelson’s blood wouldn’t do us any harm,” she sang.   
  
“You’re being really weird,” I said.

**“Matty, what the fuck are you doing?” said Tara’s voice, except her lips weren’t moving.**  
  
She leapt off the swings then, in full flight, and as she landed on the floor, her ankles crunched loudly. I ran over to check she was okay but she ran off again, hobbling slightly but still surprisingly fast.   
  
“Let’s climb the tree,” she laughed.   
  
“We’re not climbing a tree, Tara. Are you drunk?”   
  
“Come on, Matty. You can’t still be scared of the Hanged Man.”  
  
“The Hanged Man isn’t real. And even if he were, he’s interested in children, not grown women.”  
  
She was already climbing the tree.   
  
If I hadn’t been so freaked out, it would have been impressive to watch her. Her arms and legs moved expertly, navigating the branches as if with no effort at all.  
  
**“Matty, you’re scaring me,” said Tara’s voice again. But her face was calm and still and her lips were definitely not moving.**   
  
I hadn’t ever seen anyone get this high up a tree before. Not that I’d seen many adults climbing trees, but the whole thing looked quite bizarre. Sometimes a branch would creak and she would leap back, finding another place to plant her feet with ease.   
Higher and higher she rose.   
“Tara get down. Seriously.  I’m not coming after you.” She was so high up now I had to shout.   
“Fine,” she shouted back. Given how high up she'd made it, I could only just make out her lip pouted in a sulk, like a child having a tantrum. And just as I opened my mouth to chastise her again, she stopped, let go, and fell backwards, hurtling towards the ground.   
As soon as the thought entered my head to try and catch her, I was already too late.   
Like a coward, I looked away as she landed. But it didn’t matter that I couldn’t see because the sound was nauseating. I looked up to see her in a heap, limbs on top of each other at odd angles.   
And then, as if nothing happened, she was picking herself up slowly. For a moment, as she pulled herself up, I was quite sure that she’d left half of her body behind on the floor. It was such a mangled mess that I couldn’t quite make out which part of her was supposed to go where. And as much as I wanted to help, as she crawled (or perhaps more accurately slithered) over to me, all I could do was recoil.   
“Ms Polly had a dolly and her head popped off,” she sang. As she sang, she pushed dislocated limbs back into their sockets. And as she did so, she started to look sort of human-shaped again. Except for her neck. It was twisted slightly, making her look slightly to one side, but she didn’t seem bothered by it at all. 

  
**“Matty, stop it. I want to leave,” said Tara’s disembodied voice.**   
“What’s happening?” I said. “This isn’t funny. You’ve scared me. I’m scared, okay? I’m going home now.”  
“Matty, I’m going to swim in the river. You should come,” she said.   
“You’re not swimming in the river. It’s freezing. You’ll get yourself killed. Come on.”

**“Matty put it down. What is wrong with you? Stop it,” said Tara’s voice again.**   
“Tara what’s happening?” She was already sprinting to the river. Something was clearly very wrong with her. Or with me. I chased her at full speed. I wasn’t going to let her do this.   
She continued on, undeterred. She was nearing the bank now. There was nothing else for it. I dashed forward, grabbed hold of her from behind and pulled her away. I couldn’t let her go in. Not in this weather. 

I could hear her making little noises, which I initially thought were sobs, but as she turned around, I saw that she was, in fact giggling, And then, although I was easily twice the weight of her, she pushed out at me with such surprising power that she knocked me backwards before plunging herself into the freezing cold river.   
  
**“Someone help,” said Tara’s voice.**   
  
The Tara I could see in front of me was splashing her own face with glee. “Fishy, fishy, fishy, come swim in my sea. Sharky, sharky, sharky, you can’t catch me."

It probably only took me seconds to get her out, but it felt like minutes. Thankfully, she was breathing. She looked up at me, coughing and spluttering, and I knew immediately that she was back to normal.   
  
“Matty, what did you do?” she said.   
  
“I saved you,” I said. “You’re welcome by the way. What the fuck was that?”  
  
But she was backing away from me, looking terrified, and then she was sprinting off out of the park. Before I could even consider whether I should go after her, I heard the squeal of tyres and she was gone.  
  
\*  
That night was just as strange as the last.   
The walkie talkie that I’d smashed up was lay on my bed, as good as new. I didn’t even hesitate before shoving it into a bag and getting into my car. This thing needed getting rid of, once and for all. And if people can dispose of shopping trolleys and old bikes in the canal, then it seemed like as good a place as any. I ignored the sound of Joanne’s static voice coming out of my bag on the back seat. 

*“10-4. Ready to rumble.”*   
*“Oh. I forgot to say ‘over’.”*  
*“Where are you, Matty? Over and out.”*  
Once it was disposed of, I sort of expected to feel better, but I didn’t really. Maybe it was because even though I never truly believed in any of this stuff before , I was now a hundred percent sure that whatever was happening to me was supernatural in nature. Or maybe it was because after what happened with Tara, I knew that it was nowhere near over.  
Or maybe it was that I knew, deep down inside, that when I got back home, that walkie talkie would be waiting on my bed as good as new.
