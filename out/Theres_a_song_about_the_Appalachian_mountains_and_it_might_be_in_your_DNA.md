I'm a geneticist, the first college graduate in my family (my mom left Appalachia at 17, for a waitressing job and a fisherman in Alaska, my dad was the fisherman) and I can honestly say it's a fantastic career. I love what I do, and up until recently I wouldn't have traded it for anything in the world. Now… I'm almost wishing I had never left Alaska. 



First of all I want to say for the record that both my parents are some of the smartest, best people I know. My mom knows every plant there is basically, and she can recognize local plant life on sight, naming it's genus and species, what it does, and where it’s native to. When I was a kid she would take me on a walk and say, “Okay Sammy, I need you to find me something that’s safe to eat.” And I would run off into the woods and come back with something. The fun thing about that game was that a lot of plants native to Alaska are edible, so it was pretty easy to try and stump her by bringing random bark or something like that. Although, it was pretty hard to stump her. Whatever I brought back she would teach me about its properties, what it can do, and what the best way to use it is. If she didn’t know for sure, we would take a sample of it home and check to see if it was in any of her books.



Every once in a while she would tell me a little about Kentucky, she lived in this little town right at the base of black mountain. Sometimes while she and I were hiking behind our house after school, I would get to hear about some of the rare plants she found as a kid while hiking through the hills she grew up in. Red Elderberry, Hobblebush, the cool thing is after painting a word picture so descriptive I almost could've drawn it myself, she would go on to pull out a notebook or paper scrap (which she always seemed to have with her) and draw me a beautiful picture of the plant. She gifted me that notebook when I left for college, and I spent some of my spare time pasting in the loose drawings and adding descriptions, or little notes.



I never really asked her questions about her childhood. Whenever I asked about Kentucky she would talk about the plants, or sometimes tell me something about her family (she had seven siblings). But when I asked more complicated questions, she would give me an evasive reply. When I was a kid I figured she just preferred talking about plants. As I got older, I assumed the past might be too painful for her to talk about.



 Sometimes while gathering food for dinner, or herbs for her medicine cabinet (Mushrooms Magic Cabinet she called it, for some reason) she would stop and kneel down to show me something, usually going on to sketch it for me too. She always said she wanted me to understand the rich world of natural science, and plant remedies. I'm glad she taught me about that, on those long afternoon hikes through woods so thick I wondered how many hundreds of years it had been since someone else had tread on our same path. 



My mom used to purchase the old encyclopedias that salesmen sometimes hawked door to door. She paid a ton extra once to have color picture encyclopedias delivered to our house, in NoWheresLand Alaska. When she showed my dad the bill he just sighed, kissed her on the head and said, “the price of having an intelligent wife.”



My dad is basically a walking farmers almanac. He’ll glance up at a clear blue sky and say in that deep mountain drawl of his, “Ah hate when the weather takes a turn lahk that.” And the next day a storm will sweep through, knocking down trees and blowing out power lines. 



I asked him once how he got a super power like that, and he said, “Workin’ on boats, Meery, you either learn the sea or the sky, or both. If you learn the sky you'll survive, if you learn the sea you'll manage on the job, but if you learn both you'll find a second home.” (Both my parents had their own individual nicknames for me, based on my full name: Samira).



Honestly I always felt the same way about the forest. If you know the sky well enough to predict the weather, and the land well enough to know what's healing, you'll be okay. The forest is a great home for anyone willing to learn from it. Or so I thought.



I won’t lie. I had an awesome childhood. 



I spent my time split between Earth and sea, learning from one or both of my parents. Dad would take me out on the fishing boat and teach me how to run it, mom would take me into the mountains and teach me about plants. Back then schools in that part of Alaska could be pretty lax, which meant I got a lot of time to learn from the two best teachers I ever could have asked for. I know it's not like that for every kid, I got lucky. 



When I graduated from my dinky little highschool, I took a full ride scholarship in North Carolina, right at the base of the Appalachians. The only time my parents visited me during college was when I graduated, first with my bachelors, then my masters, then my doctorate. They came to all three graduations, even though every time my mom was looking around like she expected someone to jump her, and my dad clutched her arm like she might just float away.



I didn’t think about it as hard as I should have. My mom lived in Kentucky, not North Carolina, so I assumed (and I feel guilty about this now) that my sweet backwoods parents were just nervous being in such big crowds. And even though I was a little hurt that they didn’t spend any weekends visiting me at college, I waved it away because they were probably just scared to leave home. I didn’t give either of them the credit they deserve. To be honest, I didn’t give their fear the credit it deserved. Looking back I realize now that I assumed I was just smarter than them. I’m not, and if I had realized that sooner it would have saved a lot of people a lot of pain.



After I graduated I began looking for a job. Finding a job as a geneticist isn’t usually like trying to find a job with a degree in something like… I don’t know, business. You don’t go on indeed and submit 40 applications, you talk to your professors, you make contacts during school with people you hope will offer you a job after you graduate. I got four job offers, one in Seattle Washington, one in Pittsfield Massachusetts, one in Texas, and one in California. 



California and Texas got ruled out instantly, too hot for me. Seattle was harder, I loved the idea of being on the water again, and my dads route sometimes took him close to the Seattle coast so maybe I could see him more frequently. But there was just something about Massachusetts that called to me. I discussed the options with my mom, and when I told her that I was thinking about taking the job in Massachusetts all she said was, “If you think that’s a good idea.”



Again, I made the mistake of assuming she just didn't want me to be so far away. I assured her over and over that I would come home for Christmas, birthdays, and every important holiday, but it didn’t seem to make any difference for that strange sad tone she held in her voice every time we talked about it.



Finally, I threw caution to the wind and accepted the job. I moved to Massachusetts in October, and that was when things first started to get weird. It started with my mom. She called me on my first day there and our conversation started out normal enough.



She seemed cheerful as she asked, “So what do you think of the house? Does it look like it did in the pictures?”



I glanced around at my living room, “Well it’s a lot smaller than the pictures made it look, but the wood floors are gorgeous and they seem to be in perfect condition. I’ve got a huge front porch and I’m really excited to put some furniture out there, maybe a hammock or something.” I walked into the kitchen, getting more into my narration now. “The kitchen is about the same size as the one in that air BnB we stayed in a few years ago.”



She laughed, “So, postage stamp sized?”



I joined her laughter, “Yes. But the fridge is a pretty new model, and the oven seems to be in good condition. About as much storage space as my college dorm room, but I can work around that. Oh and there’s this super cool brick support beam at the corner between my living room and kitchen, and it runs all the way through the house up into the attic where I have my bedroom, which makes that area feel really cool and chic.”



Her smile shone through in her voice, “You always have loved that old school chic style. What’s your bedroom like? Is it big enough?”



I nodded as I started climbing the stairs to my attic room, “Yeah it’s basically the size of the first floor, and I have my own little ensuite bathroom up there which is awesome. There’s also a nice big window in there, and I think that’s where I want to put my desk. Then my bed can go across the room, and I’ll still have plenty of space.”



I know my mom pretty well, and her tone seemed to shift from truly upbeat to forced lightness, “Do you have curtains for your windows? And is the only bathroom upstairs? That’ll be annoying when you have guests.”



I glanced at the empty curtain bar and the stack of blackout curtains on the floor next to it with a sigh, “Yeah I really should get my curtains hung tonight, or I won’t sleep very well. You know how badly I need my blackout curtains. And no, there’s a half bath in the laundry room on the first floor. I don’t have a garage, but that’s fine I would honestly rather have the laundry room. It’s just off the kitchen, and there’s a back door in the laundry room too to get out on the back porch.”



Her voice got more serious, “Do your doors have deadbolts?”



I had made my way back downstairs by that point and I glanced at the solid wood front door, “Back door yes, front door no.”



“And you have curtains for all the windows? Not just your bedroom?”



I rolled my eyes, “Yeah, but I can wait a while before I hang those.”



She paused then said, “I’m not trying to be bossy, but that needs to be a priority. I’ll order you a pizza or something so you don’t have to worry about cooking tonight. But get those curtains up tonight, before the sun goes down please.”



I smiled, “Thanks mom, I really appreciate that. I’ll text you my new address so you can do that. You’re the best.”



She replied, “It’s my pleasure sweetheart. Do you have a lot to unpack?”



I glanced at the few boxes that were scattered around, “Not really. The movers did a lot of the hard work for me. My dishes are in the dishwasher and I’ll put them away later. And I can put my clothes away pretty slowly.”



She asked, “Has anyone told you what to do yet?”



I laughed, “Mom, I haven’t even had my first day at work yet. I have no idea what my job responsibilities are.”



There was no laughter in her voice, “Listen to me carefully Samira, please. I’m not going to say this more than once for fear of you thinking I’ve lost my marbles so you’d better take notes.”



I had a flashback instantly to the time when I was little and I almost stepped on a snake. I remember my mom yelling, in this stern voice that sounded nothing like her, “Samira! Stop right there!”



I remember stopping with my foot in the air, looking down, and nearly peeing myself when I saw the snake curled up right in front of me. How I missed it but she spotted it from ten yards away I still don’t know, but her tone gave me the exact same feeling now. I ran to grab a pen and paper and told her when I was ready.



She took a deep breath like this was going to take a lot out of her and said, “First, no whistling at night. Ever. Not even to call the dog inside, you hear? You don't know what else will hear you whistling and come running.” I didn’t have a dog yet, but I knew better than to interrupt. “Second, close the blinds at night. I don’t care if you're on the ground floor, penthouse, or in the basement. If you have a window the blinds need to close as soon as the sun starts going down. If you can see out, other things can see in.Third, find an acorn and put it on your windowsill, preferably the one in your bedroom but anywhere will work. Now I know you Sammy, and I know you’ll stop taking notes when you don’t understand what I’m saying, so keep on taking notes and just trust me, okay?”



I giggled, she had totally caught me. My notes right now said:



1. No whistling at night
2. Close the blinds at night (duh)
3. Acorn?



I went back and added “put acorn on windowsill” then said, “Okay I’m still taking notes, what’s next?”



Instead of going on she said, “Read back to me what you have so far, exactly as it’s written down.”



I sighed but did as I was told, and she said, “Alright that’s good enough. Four, always carry a flashlight, keep a good penlight in your purse and never trust a light you see at night that doesn’t come from you or your home. Do you understand?”



I nodded, remembered she couldn’t see me, and coughed out in a dry voice, “Yeah, carry a light always and don’t trust lights that aren’t mine… Yeah I don’t know if I follow. Do you mean like don’t stand in front of lights on the road? I did that once when I was five mom, and you can’t blame me, the midnight sun makes everyone weird.”



The midnight sun in Alaska is this phenomenon where the sun disappears almost completely in the winter, then stays up for 20 hours or so (sometimes more, depending on where you are in Alaska) in the summer. When I was really little, apparently I would point to any light source and say “sunrise?” Including standing in the middle of the road and pointing at an oncoming truck. 



You can’t blame me for being confused. You try going to bed and waking up in the dark, getting an hour of light, and then being plunged back into darkness.



Finally my mom let out a dry laugh and said, “You’ll get what I mean later, just remember to carry your light okay. Five, don’t trust any voices or music you hear after dark. If you hear my voice asking you to come outside and help me with my bags there’s something I need you to know. *I will never come visit you out there.* Understood?”



I got a cold chill even as her words made my cheeks blush furiously. She had hurt my feelings, and to be honest if she had told me this before I took the job, I probably would have gone to Seattle. “Mom-”



She cut me off, “It’s not because I don’t love you, and it sure isn’t because I don’t miss you. But you need to have that in your head, don’t trust any of the voices you hear at night, no matter who they sound like. Make my voice sleep on the front porch and see what it looks like in the morning.” She sighed and we sat with the dead air for a long time before she went on. “I’m sorry Sammy. I’m not doing a great job, I just don’t- I hoped you would stay away from Appalachia, that’s all. Call me any time, and be safe. Okay?”



I nodded, feeling hurt and not knowing what to do with it but I said, “Of course mom, I love you.”



She said, “I love you too. And I have one more thing for you to write down.”



I slid the paper back over to me with an eye roll that I was glad she couldn’t see, “Number six. Fire away.”



She said, “You may have grown up in the Alaskan wilderness, but that is nothing compared to the wilds of Appalachia. Don’t you go thinking you can do a solo hike at night or something else crazy, just because of where you grew up. You are Alaskan at heart, not an Appalachian. Don’t test the wilderness.”



I wrote down *Don’t test the wilderness*, and said, “Okay no solo night time hikes while whistling and chit chatting with the voices in my head. Got it.”



Instead of laughing she just said, “Please come home Samira. You don’t need to-” I heard what sounded like a muffled sob and then my dad came on the line.



He said, “Hey Meery, just wanted to say hi and I love you. Your mom misses you somethin’ awful.”



I nodded and gulped down the sob building in my own throat, “Dad is mom okay?”



I expected him to chuckle and assuage my fears but instead he said, “She’s the okayest she’s ever been, it’s you we’re worried about. If Appalachia gets to be too much you can always come back to Alaska. Just remember that sweetheart. We’ll help you find a job. It’s not starting over or giving up if all you’re doing is coming back home.”



I wasn’t sure I agreed, but I hung up after saying goodbye and I love you about a thousand more times. I figured I wouldn’t hear from my mom again for a while, but she called me every single night for the first month. She never referenced our first conversation except the occasional “Did you remember to close your blinds?” Or the one time she asked if I had found an acorn for my windowsill yet. I had, and I sent her a picture of the acorn sitting on my window ledge to make her feel better. She sent me back a thumbs up, and my dad texted me “that’s a damn good acorn, Meers.”



As a result my first month all alone in a rental house in Appalachia was extremely boring. My routine became pretty simple: get home from work, make dinner, close the blinds while talking to mom, then relax and go to bed. My weekends were similar. I would wake up, open all the blinds, make some coffee and maybe breakfast, then unpack something. After the first month she stopped calling every day, although we still usually talked every day, at least over text.. Before long we settled into a nice routine, where we would call each other every couple of days. It wasn’t remotely the same as being in the same house as her, but it was still good.



Then after a while,  I got to start working on my first really big project. Genetic memory in regards to evolutionary advantages, safety, and (drum roll please) folklore. It turns out that some stories just seem to pop up naturally, whether they’ve been taught or not. Don’t wander through the woods alone? Every culture has some kind of folklore with that message. There are all sorts of stories that just seem to occur to people naturally. Even more interesting is that genetic memory seems to work for some really random things, like for example a specific tune.



First of all, here’s how genetic memory works. Let’s say you’re obese. There’s a really good chance that someone, somewhere back in your family lineage went through a famine. So their DNA basically built in safeguards for their future ancestors to survive a famine. But, if you’re living in a modern day first world country you probably won’t experience famine, so your body is just retaining resources because of that ancestor. The same is true for schizophrenia, a lot of researchers now believe schizophrenia is basically a mistyped genetic code, designed for survival but tweaked just a little bit by some force of nature. I spoke with a psychiatrist who said that individuals with schizophrenia tend to be excellent at pattern detection, and paranoia (one of the symptoms) can be helpful in a true life or death situation.



My team was working on studying which genetic lines held the same core memory for this one specific tune. I’m not great at music but the tune is basically a three second high note, two second lower note (like a dip), the same three second high note followed by a two second higher note (like going up a hill), a sustained three notes, another one second dip, and another two second lower note. Try it. You’ll recognize it.



Everyone on my team spent roughly three months humming this tune constantly, I would hum it as I drove to and from work, while I did dishes, while taking the garbage out. It was familiar to most of us, especially the people who had grown up in and around the general area we’re in now, but based on our studies with the control group, people from all over might automatically know or recognize the tune.



The only people who said they didn’t recognize it were the few members of our team from different countries, though even the guy from the UK who looks so pale it’s like his printer ran out of ink recognized it. I recognized it too, which I didn’t think was very meaningful, but I was excited to be part of the group. We spent six months studying the genetic strands of our participants, and found that all the people in our trial study shared the same basic genetic makeup. Once we had that down, all we had to do was figure out what was so special about this tune, why was it being passed down literally through DNA?



A lot of my coworkers and I started spending our free time together, doing things like escape rooms, rage rooms (a few things that didn’t happen in rooms), and the occasional hike. While out on one of these hikes one of my teammates proposed a camping trip.



I won’t lie, my moms warning briefly entered my head, but it wasn’t like I was going camping alone, I would be in a huge group of people. What was there to worry about?



The group that wound up going on the trip consisted of me, a woman my age named Marybell who told us if anyone called her that she’d bury us all under the mountain (Mary is okay, Bella is okay, Marybell is not okay), a guy named Scott, a guy named Gabriel, a woman named Lana, and a guy who looks like a  faded picture, named Leano. 



Interestingly, I was one of the only people with any connection to Appalachia who agreed to go on the camping trip. The Friday before we all went out my supervisor, an older woman with beautiful dark skin and gorgeous curly hair named Nora, pulled me aside and asked to speak to me.



Once we were alone she said, “are you going on that camping trip?”



I smiled, “Yeah I am. Do you want to come too?”



She looked more stern than she did the day I broke a vial of samples, “Don’t you know better?  Excuse me for being blunt, but I thought you had family from this area. Don’t you know better than to go out in those mountains at night?”



I had told her that my mom was from here, and I offered an apologetic smile, despite feeling insulted and a little confused, “My mom left Kentucky when she was seventeen, way before she had me. I grew up in Alaska, so I’m pretty used to the wilderness. And if you ask my mom, I’m Alaskan, not Appalachian.”



Nora lifted her hands in a surrender gesture, “If you think you can handle it. Just be safe, try to keep the rest of them safe too.” I gave my assent and stood to leave, as I exited the room she called out one final piece of advice, “Don’t whistle.”



I chuckled uncomfortably, but a chill ran up my spine. 



On Saturday I woke up when it was still dark outside, grabbed all my supplies, and jumped in my car. It was 3 in the morning, we wanted to start our first day early so we could find a place to set up camp and just relax for a while. One of the guys knew a place near a waterfall in the mountains, and we planned on trying to find a spot nearby to set up. He said it was about an 8 mile hike from where we would park to where we would end up. Depending on terrain and our walking speeds, that could be a three to five hour hike, which is why I packed everything into my car, locked it, then went back inside to make a large thermos of coffee to drink while driving to the parking area.



I opened the kitchen blinds so I could keep my eye on my car (I’m paranoid about leaving that much stuff in my car when I’m not in it) while I made my coffee. I ground the beans, my eyes resting blurrily on my cell phone as I flipped through videos while trying to wake up. 



Once the coffee was ready and sitting in my thermos, I went to the front door, locked it, and made my way back to my car. About ten feet past my car, which was still a couple yards ahead of me, a deer stood in the shadow cast by one of the large trees on the property. I stopped to admire it, feeling a pang of homesickness as I thought about my mom.



Much to my surprise, the deer began to approach me. Deer in Alaska are pretty brave from what I hear about other places, but even there wild animals don’t normally approach you at random, in the middle of the night, when they aren’t used to you yet.



An alarm bell went off vaguely in my head, and I rushed around to the driver side door of my car, got in and locked the door. I felt a little silly being so paranoid, but it was dark and my fear that the animal might have rabies or something was pretty strong. I took a deep breath once I was buckled in and looked around to see where the deer had gone. It was still roughly where I had seen it before, standing in the shadows near the tree line. It could have been my imagination, but it looked for a moment as though the deer leaned against the tree nearest to it, like it was trying to get on two legs.



I shivered as I started my car, swung it around onto the road, and started driving. I glanced back at the deer, and for a second I could have sworn I saw it standing on its rear legs. Not braced against the trunk of the tree, but standing firmly on its two rear legs, it stepped out of the shadow and I saw its face was entirely bone as though the skin had all been pulled off. Then I turned a corner and I couldn’t see it any more, what must have been an optical illusion was gone, and replaced only by darkness.



I was the last person to arrive at the parking lot where we were all meeting, but I was quickly forgiven when I shared the thermos of coffee and asked, “So is it normal for deer to walk around on two legs out here?”



Marybell rolled her eyes, “Don’t start, it’s way too early for pranks.”



I chuckled, but made a face at her, “Who says I’m making a prank, I’m really asking.”



Marybell lifted an eyebrow, as Scott slung an arm around me, “Tell me what this nifty two legged deer was like Sammy-Rah.”



I rolled my eyes and shrugged his arm off, side-stepping to put some distance between us, “I came out of my house this morning and there was a deer standing off in the shadows staring at me. As I was getting ready to leave, it got up on its back two legs and started walking at me. I got in my car and left, but I could still see it standing on two feet as I was driving away.”



As I spoke, the group's collective smile began to fade into a vaguely concerned frown. All of a sudden I felt the distance, just how far away I really was from Alaska. It made me miss my parents.  Briefly considered telling them about the face made of bone, but if their reactions to the information I had already shared was any indication, they weren’t going to be inclined to believe me.



Then Leano laughed and said, “I see, she does prank us. This is to set the tone? So to speak. Yes?”



It took me a moment to process what he said, but when I did I decided to run with it. I didn’t want the group thinking I had a screw loose. So I just smiled and said, “Gotcha.”



Leano laughed uproariously, and the rest of the group gave me a mixture of eyerolls and chuckles that, at least, made me feel like one of the gang. I figured I could worry about the weird deer later, I mean honestly it wasn’t that big of a deal. We gathered our things, locked our cars, and started the long hike just as the sky began to lighten in the East. By the time the sunrise graced us with its explosion of colors across the Eastern sky, we had made it probably two miles into our hike. I was already exhausted.



I hiked a lot with my parents and friends back in Alaska, we even did lots of camping trips where basically all we did was hike or swim. But the trail we were on was steep in some areas, rocky in most areas, and hard to set a rhythm with. As a result I felt like I was constantly bumping into people, getting ahead or falling behind.



By the time we took a break to eat, I think we were all wondering why we had signed up for this. Even Leano, who usually has an almost annoyingly positive attitude, looked silent, paler than ever, and just a little unhappy. My spirits plummeted. If Leano was having a bad time, the rest of us were screwed.



We got our packs back on our shoulders, looked around at each other as if to say, ‘we may as well finish what we started’ and got back on the trail. Just before I was getting ready to say that we should turn back and go see a movie or something, there was a bend in the trail, and we were looking out over the most stunning landscape I’ve ever seen.



I need you to understand, I’m from Alaska. “Stunning landscape” should be old hat to me, everything there is stunning. But there was something about the way the world looked, stretched out below me in a tie-dye of colors, oranges and greens, the blue water I could see in a few places, and beyond that a sky line that seemed to stretch on forever.



I didn’t hear myself gasp but Marybell stopped next to me and said, “I know right? Every time I come out in the wilderness I get that same feeling. Awe doesn’t even begin to describe it.”



I nodded at her, grateful she understood, “Yeah, I thought Alaska had the monopoly on beauty in nature. I didn’t- I wonder why my mom left this place?”



The words just kind of popped out of me, but Marybell took them seriously. “Oh is your mom from Massachusetts?”



I shook my head, “No, Kentucky. But she grew up in the Appalachian mountains, or like right at the base of Black Mountain. She used to tell me stories sometimes… I don’t really get why she left. Although she would probably say the same thing about me leaving Alaska.”



Marybell’s eyebrows shot up, “I think I understand.”



I lifted my own eyebrows, waiting for her to respond, but she turned away and kept moving, as if she hadn’t just left our conversation in the middle. 



When we got to our campgrounds we all went and set up our tents first, I’m guessing I wasn’t the only person who was thinking a nap on my sleeping bag sounded perfect. When I finished setting my tent up I stepped back and looked around to see if anyone else needed my help. Pretty much all of us had our own little one or two person tents. Marybell seemed to have finished first and was helping Lana. Gabriel and Scott were apparently sharing a tent, and working together on it, and Leano was already done, and putting rocks in a circle to form a fire pit. I went over and started helping with sourcing and arranging rocks, then we collected some fire wood and got everything set aside, ready to go for when we needed it.
