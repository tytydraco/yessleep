Three months ago, I stumbled upon an old, dusty box while rummaging through the basement of my aunt’s house. The basement itself was a forgotten relic of the past, filled with cobwebs and the scent of aged wood, a place where time seemed to stand still. Inside the box was something even more peculiar: an ancient-looking Ouija board. The wood was worn, the letters faded, and the planchette had an unsettling feel as I touched it, as though it had absorbed the energy of countless sessions over the years.

When I showed it to my aunt, her eyes lit up with a strange mix of curiosity and excitement. My aunt has always been drawn to the occult, with a particular interest in esotericism. She’s the kind of person who believes in the power of crystals and spends her evenings reading tarot cards. So, it didn’t surprise me when she eagerly unpacked the board, brushing off the dust with reverence, as though handling a sacred artifact.

What did surprise me, though, was when she asked me to join her in using it. I had always thought of these things as harmless, just a game people played to scare themselves. But the way my aunt’s hands trembled slightly as she set up the board made me hesitate. Still, curiosity got the better of me, and I agreed.

We sat across from each other at the small, round table in the center of the room. The only light came from a flickering candle, casting long, dancing shadows on the walls. My aunt took a deep breath and placed her fingers lightly on the planchette. I followed suit, feeling a strange sense of anticipation in the pit of my stomach.

“Is there a presence here with us?” my aunt asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

For a moment, nothing happened. The silence was thick, almost suffocating. Then, slowly, the planchette began to move. It was subtle at first, a slight twitch, but soon it glided across the board with a purpose of its own. My heart raced as it spelled out a single, chilling word: “Yes.”

I felt a cold shiver run down my spine. My aunt, however, seemed almost exhilarated. She pressed on, her voice trembling with a mixture of fear and excitement. “What do you want to tell us?” she asked.

The planchette paused, as if considering the question, before it began to move again, this time with more urgency. The words it spelled out were terrifying:

“I can tell you the future.”

A knot formed in my stomach. My aunt’s face had gone pale, but she continued, as if compelled by some unseen force. “What does the future hold?” she asked.

The planchette moved quickly now, almost frantically, spelling out a series of predictions that made my blood run cold:

“Someone will try to break into your house.” “Your dog is going to die.” “There will be tanks and military aircraft around you.”

We both sat in stunned silence as the final word was spelled out. The room felt colder, the candle flickering as if it, too, sensed the shift in the atmosphere. My aunt finally broke the silence, her voice shaky. “That’s enough for tonight,” she said, and we hastily packed away the board, but the words lingered in the air like a dark cloud.

A month passed, and I had almost managed to push the experience to the back of my mind, convincing myself that it was just a creepy coincidence, a trick of the mind. But then, the first prediction came true.

It was late at night when my aunt heard a strange noise outside her bedroom window. At first, she thought it was just the wind, but then she saw a shadow moving outside. When she realized someone was trying to break in, she screamed so loudly that it scared the intruder away. Later, we learned that the person was from a children’s home only 150 meters away, but that didn’t make the experience any less terrifying.

Two months later, the second prediction struck with brutal accuracy. My aunt’s dog, a lively and healthy companion, suddenly fell ill and died within days. The loss hit her hard, not just because of the grief, but because of the growing realization that the board’s predictions were coming true.

The only thing that hasn’t happened yet is the presence of military aircraft and tanks. But with everything else coming to pass, I can’t help but feel a gnawing dread in the pit of my stomach. What if the final prediction is just around the corner? What if it’s only a matter of time before we hear the rumble of tanks and the roar of aircraft overhead?

I’m left wondering if we’ve unleashed something we don’t understand, something that’s still out there, waiting. What do you make of these events? Do you think it’s just a series of eerie coincidences, or is something darker at play?
