I have a relative who is a former prison guard.
He says that the job of a prison guard is not to watch over inmates.

The real job of a prison guard is not to monitor inmates, but to teach them human warmth.
Such an uncle would listen to the inmates’ stories whenever he had time.

Most of the stories were about the crimes they had committed.
Those who turned themselves in would talk about why they turned themselves in.
Let’s assume that the prisoner is A.

A was originally an ordinary businessman. The reason he is in prison is murder.
It was this person’s wife who was murdered, and after the murder, A, having trouble disposing of the body, put the body in pieces in the refrigerator of his house.

When he came home from work, he took out parts of the body from the refrigerator, cut the meat into small pieces, shattered the bones with a blender, and flushed them down the toilet in his room.

Such days went on for several days, and most of her body was flushed down the toilet.
The last thing that remained was the head, and he still couldn’t bring himself to chop this up into small pieces.

One day, after several days of having only the head left in the refrigerator, A had a dream.
In the dream, his wife was sitting on the table in his room with her head down.

She seemed to be lying down very deeply, so he could not see her expression.
But her hand on the table was shaking from side to side.
Gradually, the shaking became quicker and quicker, and her fingernails and fingers began to fly around the table.

In no time at all, the elbow was gone, and bright red blood gushed from the torn arm, the bones banging against the shattered table.

When A woke up, his whole body was drenched in sweat, and he was so shocked that he couldn’t move.
Finally, he calmed down and went to the living room.

The refrigerator was slightly open, and his wife was staring at him from there with only her head.
Startled, A closed the refrigerator and the door with duct tape.

At this time, A had not yet thought about turning himself in.
That day, A, untouched by the head in the refrigerator, had no choice but to buy a new refrigerator.

Since it was a small refrigerator for one person, he did not ask for delivery from the store, but took it home.
The existence of the refrigerator with the duct tape was never made public.
His wife was sitting in the same place in the same dream that day.

The difference was that the dream started at the end of yesterday.
Bright red blood was dripping from his wife’s arm on the table.

Now her feet were kicking the floor.
The movement became more and more.
Blood began to ooze onto the floor, and the flesh of his legs began to scatter.
On the table, arms are being swung around, splattering blood.

A’s cheek is also splattered with blood, but she is unable to move and watches the scene.
In my head, I was screaming, ‘Hurry up and wake up,’ but the dream never ended.
The blood splattered all over the room was glistening.

Suddenly, I felt my limbs stop moving, and my face, which had been downcast, began to rise little by little.
Her bangs, which had been hanging down, were now sticking to her cheeks.

Through the gap in her hair, I could see her eyes staring upward at A.
When her face was fully up, she said
“Aaahhhh, give me back my body, give me back my body!
I want my body back! ”
At the sound of this voice, A was finally able to wake up.

He was still sweating all over.
At this point, A was apparently hungry to deal with the head in the refrigerator.
When he jumped out of bed and went to the refrigerator, the thought disappeared completely.

The duct tape that had held the head so sturdily in place was all shredded, and the wife’s head had tumbled out of the refrigerator.

Her eyes were wide open and she was staring at A.
It seems that A had come to the conclusion that he could not escape, and he turned himself in.
According to my uncle
The regret of the murdered person lives on forever.
