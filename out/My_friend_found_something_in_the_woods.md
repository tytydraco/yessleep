My group of friends has always liked the outdoors. The four of us have always enjoyed a weekend of camping and fishing. I would’ve never guessed it was going to turn out like this. I always hear stories of crazy things happening out in the woods but I never thought it would happen to us.

Last weekend wasn’t out of the ordinary to begin with. We packed up and headed out to do some back-country camping. We heard of a new place near a lake where my a distant friend had been once or twice. We were told that this area was quiet and had great fishing.

Our group consists of four guys who have loved camping in the wilderness for our whole lives. Todd is maybe the roughest of the four. He stands at 6 foot 3 and is up for almost anything. Ryan is definitely the smart one in the group. He usually doesn’t let Todd do the dumbass things he wants to. I honestly think Todd might’ve been sent to the hospital a dozen times if it weren’t for Ryan. To be honest, I don’t add much to the group. I’m just there for the good time and really follow what everyone else is doing. 

Liam is a little bit different. Before last weekend, I would’ve called him the skittish one. Never really wanting to do any of the dumbass shit we’re getting ourselves into. Not to make fun of the guy, but he just usually doesn’t get into trouble. It’s for that reason, that I have such a hard time trying to stomach the things that I saw this weekend.

We hiked for about two hours to find the perfect place to set up camp. God, it was beautiful out there. A nice open place right beside the lake. The water looked almost like glass with the reflection of the hot sun shining up to shore. Who knew a place so beautiful could be filled with so much horror.

We decided to take two tents instead of four this weekend to conserve some weight. I got bunked with Ryan and Todd was set up with Liam. Before we had even finished getting camp set up, Todd had started to blow up his inflatable kayak. Liam was trying to get Todd to help finish setting up their tent, but Todd didn’t really care. I’m lucky a got set up with Ryan because he has a serious “work before play” mentality. 

Todd was already on the water by the time we had finished setting up. I was ready to join him as we only had a few hours of daylight left. Ryan and Liam weren’t too keen about going fishing right away and suggested going on a hike to check out the area. I’m not one for hiking, and Todd isn’t either so me and Todd set out on the water while Liam and Ryan went out to the woods.

After about two and a half hours of no luck on the water we paddled back into camp. It was getting close dark and we were hungry. Back at camp, Ryan and Liam were sitting by a newly lit fire. Before I even stepped a foot on that campsite I knew something was wrong. A tightness in my chest that felt like a hand squeezing from the inside. As we walked up to camp, I got my first look at the source of the bad feeling.

“Look what I found!” Liam yelled with a smile

The volume of his voice startled me and I took a small step back. In his hand there was a small wooden doll. When I laid my eyes on it my heart skipped a beat. I was frozen in place for a moment, unable to move. Hesitant, I walked up to get a closer look. It looked like one of those creatures from the movie “Trolls” only slightly chunkier and without the crazy hair. It fit in the palm of his hand and had an eerie feeling to it. 

Suddenly I had the urge to take it. It felt as if an unknown force had thrusted my arm outward to grab this trinket from the hands of my friend. Almost with the same force, Liam instantly pulled back his hand. His eyes filled with rage. Not just a joking rage you use when you yell at your friends about something stupid, a real pure rage.

“NO.” He said firmly with a voice that echoed across the lake

As quickly as the urge came to take the doll, it was gone. My lungs felt empty and my heart just the same. I took a deep breath and looked at Liam, hoping his rage had left him too. It hadn’t. He looked at me with the same rage in his eyes, staring.

“Sorry, I don’t know what came over me” I muttered with a neutral tone

I had never seen Liam like this before, he was usually so kind. I looked at both Todd and Ryan, they looked both as confused as me. Eventually Liam’s rage disappeared and he went back to normal. Well, not normal there was something off with him. I knew it was because of that damn doll.

We roasted some hot dogs and talked around the fire as the sun set. Liam was oddly quiet during our conversation. He didn’t say a single word and ate in silence. He only perked up when we mentioned the doll. 

“So where’d you find that thing anyway” Todd asked with his mouth half-full of hot dog

Ryan looked at Liam to answer, but he just sat there silently, staring.

Ryan answered “It was inside of a tree, maybe a squirrel hole or something I’m not sure. I went to grab it but Liam-“ 

“It’s mine” 

A chill trickled down my spine. After an hour of not speaking, the only words he says: “it’s mine”. Two simple words. Two words that chilled me to the core. he stared at the three of us with a deadly look in his eyes and didn’t move a muscle. 

“What’s going on with your eyes man?” Ryan asks

He was right, something was off. Liam’s eyes were always bright blue. But now, they seemed darker, a kind of gross yellow. Almost what I’d imagine a wolf to have. 

Liam didn’t respond. Just sat there, clutching this doll so tightly in his hands that his knuckles were turning white. Something was terribly off with him. That doll was affecting him in some way none of us could comprehend. 

We took a second to grab our bearings and continued to talk. Somehow we shrugged off the odd things that were happening to Liam. I know now that we should have taken that fucking doll away from him. If he had I’d still see Liam as the nice guy I know he truly is.

Once we went to bed is when the real terror started. Me and Ryan shut out the lights not long after we got in our tent. It was hard to sleep with the sound from the other tent. Todd and Liam were arguing about something and it sounded pretty heated. I never asked Todd what the argument was about but I assume it was about that doll.

The argument went on for about a half hour until it suddenly stopped. All I could hear was the sound of the frogs croaking and the odd chirp from a bird. Then I heard footsteps going out into the woods from our campsite. Slowly growing more distant and eventually, out of earshot altogether. 

I assumed that Todd had gotten pissed off at Liam and went to take a piss or something. The only problem, I saw no flashlight go out into the woods. I looked over at Ryan but he seemed to be asleep. I played there and thought for a few minutes. I figured I’d better check in on the other tent to see what was going on. 

I slowly climbed over top of Ryan to get out of the tent. I grabbed my flashlight and walked over. I zipped open the other tent and I saw Todd sitting there in his underwear. Alone.

“Where the hell is Liam” I asked quietly 

“I don’t know he just got up and left.” Todd said without a care in the world, ”His dumbass didn’t even take a flashlight.” 

It only struck me then how out of character this was. Liam wouldn’t even go out in the woods alone WITH a flashlight. Never mind in the dark without one. He must be really pissed or something is terribly wrong

“Don’t you think we should go find him?” I asked with a hint of frustration. 

“Liam does not want to talk to me right now” I could tell that Todd was afraid by the way he muttered his next words. “Something is wrong with him man, I don’t think anyone should be around him right now”

I left without saying another word to Todd. Once he makes a decision he’s set in his ways. I knew he wasn’t stepping a foot out into those woods. I thought he was just being dramatic, making an excuse to stay safe in that tent. Todd could not have been more right. I wish I had known.

I shook Ryan awake and told him Liam was alone in the woods without a flashlight. 

“That god damn idiot” Ryan spat out as he threw some pants on. 

It’s not often that good Christian Ryan uses the lords name in vain. I guess he just wasn’t  too happy about being woken up in the middle of the night. 

We flicked on our flashlights and pointed them in the woods. Even with the beams shining full blast the woods were as dark as ever. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something awful would happen in those woods. 

Every minute in those woods felt like they dragged on for hours. I could feel my heart pounding on my chest like an animal trying to break free. The horrible feeling I had when I saw that doll had come back. It had never felt more real. The only thing keeping me sane was the sounds of the forest. I’m usually not comforted by buzzing bugs or screaming crows, but something about the noise calmed me.

It couldn’t have been more than 10 minutes when we found Liam. The noises of the surrounding forest cut out instantly. Like someone had just pressed pause on their phone. Me and Ryan stopped and froze, as if we had turned to stone on the spot. 

I had never felt so vulnerable. I had the feeling I was being watched. I could see Liam’s yellowed eyes in the back of my head, piercing my mind. I knew that he was looking at me. I just couldn’t find out where. I snapped out of my petrified stance and started to look around, Ryan quickly followed suit.

I couldn’t see a thing. Even with the flashlights the darkness has consumed the forest around us. Something broke the silence. Barely audible, but it was there. A laboured breath, almost like a panting dog. The sound that was so quiet, was somehow so loud. It consumed everything around me, I couldn’t place where it was coming from.  

Again, I froze in place. Something had fallen on my shoulder. I reached my hand up to touch the foreign object. It was wet. Wet? What out here would fall on my shoulder that’s wet? I pointed the flashlight at my hand. It was red, dark red. It was a drop of blood. 

I felt my ears pounding with the beat of my heart as I looked at the liquid on my finger. The only place it could’ve came from was up. I looked above me and saw the source of the breathing. a pair of yellow eyes looking straight at me. That stare locked me in place. Any muscle I tried to move, was halted by an unseen force. It was up high, really high. Higher than any man I knew could climb. up there on that tree, perched the man I knew as Liam. 

His body was darker than the night itself. His arms looked to had grown a foot in length, his legs too. Maybe my mind was just painting a grim portrait but I swear, his body was different. I couldn’t make out a single facial feature. All I saw was a blank canvas with those glowing yellow eyes. I knew it was Liam. I remembered those eyes by the fire as if it happened five minutes before. It was him, it was Liam. 

Under one of his large hands looked to be a small rodent. Or at least what was left of one. I remember it so clearly. Every time I close my eyes I can see those eyes staring at me. Like the snap of a rubber band I regained control of my body. I ran. I ran back to camp faster than I’ve ever ran before. I could only hope Ryan was following me because I was NOT looking back. 

I entered the clearing of our campsite and saw Todd standing in front of his tent.

“What’s going on? I heard screaming”

I don’t recall screaming or even making a single sound. Ryan must have cried out while I left him there. I looked at the kayaks on shore and know that was the only way to be safe.


“Get in a fucking boat!” I screamed at Todd.

I looked back to the forest and i saw Ryan running into the clearing with his eyes wide. He stopped for a second and clutched his heart to catch his breath.

“Boat!” I screamed. this time, directed at Ryan.

As I looked back Todd had one kayak in the water, dragging a second. As quickly as before, I ran to the boat and jumped in. Ryan followed not far behind. I paddled, and paddled until my arms gave out. Only looking back to see that Ryan and Todd were close behind.  


“What happened? Why are we out here it’s damn cold!” Todd yelled with confusion. 

I hadn’t even noticed he was still in his underwear. That was the least of my worries at this point. Neither me nor Ryan felt the need to answer Todd. To petrified to say a word about our experience.

My heart had finally decided to slow down. A part of me wanted to look back at our camp, see if that creature was there watching us out in the lake. No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t find the strength to look. Without saying another word, I laid down in my inflatable kayak. The small waves rocking me back and fourth made my eyes feel heavy. I eventually dozed off. 

I woke up to the bright light of the shining sun. The rocking sensation I felt the night before had disappeared. I looked around and saw that I was beached up on a rocky shore. I was on the same side of the lake as the campsite, I could my neon green tent not three hundred feet from where I had landed. Along with the tent was two kayaks up on the shore. Someone had gone back.

Who would be so stupid to go back to shore with Liam around. If Ryan had seen what I saw, there’s no way he would’ve gone back. It had to be Todd. I looked around me again, I saw Ryan’s kayak not too far from me. He had ended up quite close to where I was, about twenty feet further from the camp than me. 

I paddled over to Ryan and gave him a few pokes with my paddle until he woke up. 

“Todd went back” I said calmly to Ryan. 

Even being awake for seconds, Ryan knew how dire this situation was.

“He did what?” He asked me firmly. 

It was less of a question and more trying to cope with what he just heard. He kicked off and we paddled back to the campsite. Strangely, nothing felt off when we were approaching the campsite. Nothing like what I had felt coming back the day prior. I just knew. I knew by some feeling in the back of my mind that the doll was nowhere around our campsite.

We beached our kayaks and hopped out on to dry land. Once I stepped on that rocky shore the uneasy feeling returned. This time it wasn’t about Liam, it was about Todd. 

After the walk back to the truck Ryan called. the police were there within minutes. I told them that Todd and Liam must have gone out into the woods in the night and didn’t come back. We woke up to find neither Todd nor Liam asleep in their tent. Ryan told them a similar story. Not one of us said a word about the doll, or what we saw in the woods the night before. As of now the investigation is still ongoing. It’s Wednesday now, they went missing Friday night. 

I have no doubt that Liam is still out there somewhere. A little piece in the back of my mind, like a distant memory trying to pry its way out. I can hear what sounds like Todd screaming. Not a scream like I’ve ever heard from him, a scream of terror. 






I didn’t mean to make a wall of text like I did here, but I couldn’t really sum it up with less words. you have any questions about this experience, maybe something I missed please ask. I’m writing this late at night and I’m far from an author. I apologize for any grammar mistakes or anything of the sort.
