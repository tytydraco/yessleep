-LOCATING....

Hello? Come in world 274. Ah its, SAM ITS FLASHING. WHAT? OH OKAY ITS ON? GOOD. THANK YOU SAM. 
Hello, this is a message to world 274 from world 239. I'm not sure how this will get through, but its vital that continue listening this.Or reading, or watching. My name is Charles, I am an agent and I'm from world 239, much like your own except in roughly 20 - 80 years in the future hence why I can contact you now. The technology is far more advanced but we can not pinpoint what time zone you're in right now, we only know it will happen to you too. 

You'll most likely be seeing this on a social media app, maybe as a meme, a video, or just a post. It may even appear on your television as an advert. But do not take it as a joke or a story, you need to listen. 

On the 25th of July, 2043, at 1.45 am EST,  the world fell dark. The whole planet lost power, somthing from deep in space will hit the planet, knocking all power out for about a minute. We aren't sure why this happened, but it's theorised it's because of the radiation that damaged it. This is the beginning, if this event is carried out then sadly, your fate is sealed. It may not happen the exact time, date or year, but when it does know that its the beginning of the end. 

We first spotted it's presence on the 5th March, 2062 whilst studying the stars, and we spotted several of them disappearing. There was quite a chunk od space that lacked anything. 

We pointed the hubble telescope at this area, and could see multiple stars begin to, well 'blip' out of existence. However, we were unable to see the cause of this phenomenon, so we moved onto using the [REDACTED] telescope. I don't think you've invented it yet, so the name won't get through. There's lots of rules for multi-universal communication. Moving on, from this we could see gas clouds, planets, stars being dragged back into some kind of void. A black hole, about 5 lightyears away, frighteningly close. The power put back in 48 was caused by the supernova that formed the supermassive black hole, the radiation briefly affected the equipment on Earth. But the scientists working on this assured the government's that we would get close to it, and the public was not informed. The whole thing was hushed, documents were signed, everything forgotten. 

In 2068, on the 18th November the truth escaped. I was working in [REDACTED], and was told about the black hole named "titan". The patch titan had ripped through in the sky had grew to horrific amounts, the public was waging wars, demanding to know why part of the sky was inky black and it was obvious they had lied about titan not being a problem. At 4.2 lightyears away, Proxima Centauri had gone. We are next. We are moving towards the great destroyer, and so is our sun. The whole solar system will eventually be ripped apart by titan.

 We have about a year left, depending if another planet doesn't smash into us first, or we get torn apart by the masses of gravity. But either way we are to die. The date now, is 19th April, 2070 and the gradual pull of gravity is ever growing stronger.

 I wish you luck world 274, I really do. All we can do is pray but maybe you can develop a way out. It might not be too late.
