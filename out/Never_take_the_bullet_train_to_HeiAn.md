I'm from a relatively small town on the border of Myanmar and China. Lush green mountains surround us on all sides and most people have lived their whole life here. I always saw it as a peaceful farming town, one of thousands like it all over China.



Nothing really special about it looking from the outside in but those who lived here long enough hear whispers of a ghost town.



It doesn't exist on any map, and goes by many names, Hei Shi, Gui Dong, and of course Hei An.  Legends say its a town full of cannibals that pick off anyone who gets too close, some say its just an endless field of graves that never lets you leave, and others say its home to the gates to Hell.



They could all be real or all could be fake. Very few people are willing to talk about it but I know one thing.



Hei An exists.



A few years ago I started a job working with the newly built railway station. We have one high speed rail that connects us to the rest of the country and it only has a few stops a day. My job is just making sure people don't wander off where they aren’t supposed to go but one day I was asked to work the night shift next week.



The person who worked the night shift before recently retired and they haven't found anyone to replace him yet. Probably due to not looking if i'm honest. We aren't a large city but people still need work, and this job is pretty cushy.



At the time, I had no reservations about taking up the night shift as it's basically playing your phone and making sure no one breaks in or so I thought.



I arrived for my normal shift around 8 in the morning. It was pretty empty minus a handful of people. A teller who sold the tickets, a younger female coworker who works the metal detector. Lets call her Sandy, and a few passengers waiting on the last train. Some of them seemed familiar but I can't say I know them.



"Hey Sandy, anyone give you any trouble?" I asked half joking



"Same old same old."



"How many chickens did they try to snuck aboard today?"



"Too many," she said, putting her hands to her temples.



For those who aren't familiar with the railway system, certain things aren't allowed to be carried on to the train. Some obvious stuff like knives, explosives, chemicals, and live animals. Though people tend to overlook the live animal part.



To be honest the chickens are probably less troublesome than most children..But rules are rules.



The first thirty minutes of my shift were uneventful till I saw this scruffy guy with a thin leather jacket and a small travel suitcase approach the security desk.



I didn't see him when I walked in and before I could see what he wanted, he swerved and went to the center of the station.



He stared up at the list of departures. A large electronic board over the entrance to the platform where people can see to check for updates. He stood there for several minutes, eyes never looking away from the board.



"Can I help you sir ?" I asked him.



no response.



I stood there a moment before waving my hand in front of his face.



He didn't react.



It was like he was in a trance. I wasn't sure what to do, if this was some kinda stroke or a mentally ill individual?



I put my hand on his shoulder.



Then he started screaming. His face beet red as I stepped back.



"Sir? Sir?! Calm down!".



He didn't even look at me as he tried to rip out one of the chairs bolted to the ground. His screams were incoherent and his movements frantic.



I looked over at Sandy who was on the phone with the police.



"Sir! Sir! Calm down so I can help you."



His blood red eyes looked at made, and he whispered one word



"Hei An"



before bolting and jumping the turnstile out onto the train platform.



"Sir?!" I went out to follow him but he vanished. He wasn't on the tracks, we only had two of them. No train had arrived, it's possible he ran off into the mountains that surrounded the station but he would have to run faster than the train for me not to see where he went.



"Is he gone?" Sandy asked me as I came in.



"I don't see him anywhere"



Sandy went back to talking to the police, and basically what they said was that due to the attack on the Kunming station a few years ago, they advised us to evacuate do to the possibility of a planted bomb and abandoned luggage.



We did just that.



For three days no trains stopped by our local station. They did a sweep of the building, the nearby tracks, woods, and found nothing. The luggage left behind, from what I heard, was just clothes and other normal things.



That kinda makes sense as it was able to get through the scanner but I also wouldn't be surprised if some details were left out. He was definitely mentally unsound, and I even told the state police that.



One weird thing that got me suspicious is when I mentioned he said HeiAn they turned to look at each other like they heard that before. I might be looking at things too deeply, one case in a billion and it just happened here. A not mentally sound individual spooked even more out of his mind by a local ghost story.



Nothing I needed to worry about. Nothing I get paid to worry about.



Things went on as normal and eventually I was scheduled for the night shift.



When I say no one was there, I mean no one. The front door wasn't locked and all the lights were on. The list of departures was empty so it was made since no one was waiting but at least someone who works here can stay so I can come and lock up. Hesh. The younger generation.



I locked up and made my rounds, patrolled around the platform and nothing. It all looked pretty normal lit only by flashlight on a cold windy night. Deep down I felt a sense of uncertainty, maybe even a hint of dread.



Toughing it out and quickly returning inside to see that it was just as empty as before.



A few hours passed and I started to feel at ease. I was just being silly, even if that guy came back. He Is just a man and I'm behind a locked door with a direct line to the police.



I chuckled at myself, I'm a grown man. I can handle myself.



As I told myself those very words the lights flickered. I was in near total darkness for just seconds but the ease I once felt washed away.



When the lights came back on I noticed an arrangement of flowers at the security desk. I walked a few steps forward and swore I heard for a brief moment the echoing laughter of children behind me.



No one was there.



The flowers were still sitting on the desk with a message attached. The message was in Mandarin for obvious reasons, but it was basically a love note addressed to someone I will call Lisa. I don't know any Lisa, and nobody who works here has that name.



The lights flickered three times before turning off completely. My flashlight refuses to turn on leaving me with only the dim moonlight coming through station windows.



Dead silence till a familiar click sounds. The bulletin board of departures and arrivals came back to life with only one city listed in bright red



HeiAn.



The board began to glitch and the words darted across the screen and broke apart. I just stared at it clutching the bouquet in my hands.



The sliding doors to the platform opened by themselves as a distorted voice came over the PA. I couldn't really understand what it said but I heard it. The sounds of the train pulling into the station.



I wasn't sure if I was just losing my mind or stuck in a nightmare I can't wake up from.



The front door slammed open and through the murky darkness I saw several shadowy figures by the door. They poured in one by one like they were waiting in line.



I stood frozen as I watched them shuffle by as if they were undisturbed by my presence. They looked like rotting corpses up close with tattered clothes and blank white eyes.



Almost didn't notice the hand on my shoulder.



I didn't look back. His grip tighten and a deep voice said



"Ticket?"



"huh?"



"Ticket, sir. Where's your ticket?"



I turned to face him. He looked almost normal, a young man in an old train station uniform. His skin was a pale white and his eyes unblinking as he waited for my response.



"I...I don't have a ticket"



His smile stared to waver as he asked "You don't have a ticket?"



"Yeah, I just work here..."



His eyes filled with rage as the skin around his eyes, once smooth, had dozens of crows feet and wrinkles.



"WHY ARE YOU EVER HERE?!" His voice boomed throughout the station.



"I..I work..."



He cut me off "Security!".



From over the door but one, giant jet black dogs with bloodshot eyes came out and snarled. A blood red liquid dripping from their mouths.



"We don't like dead weight here," the man said.



Before I could say anything he whistled and the hounds went loose trembling the walking corpses in their way.



I booked for the only exit. The train platform with the black as night bullet train. It has red stained windows and went on forever in both directions. The doors were open but I ran down the platform hoping to lose these hounds in the mountains.



One hound stood between me and the end of the platform staring me down as the rest ran closer and closer from behind me.



"Train now leaving for..."  followed by a ding sound as the door to my right started to close.



I throw my hand in the door to hold it open just enough to squeeze my fat self through without being ripped to shreds. The door quickly slid on the hound's mouth.



The whispering sound it made almost made me feel sorry for it as it fell off from the train.



The train car was filled with empty seats and It was indistinguishable from a normal one. Except, the door leading to the car had a cartoonishly large lock and chain wrapped around it.



"Clearly not going that way" I murmured to myself.



Luckily, the.door to the previous car was wide open.



Peering my head through only to see nothing but another empty car but the door on the opposite side was open.



Slowly walking down the aisle like tip toeing over egg shells. I expected the worse but I found nothing.



one idea managed to creep into my mind.



"Is it endless?"



No... No. I couldn't panic if I start to panic, everything will get worse.



I took a seat as I clutched the bouquet in my hands.



One deep breath, two deep breaths, and three deep breaths as I listened to the shuffling of the train.



I pulled out my cell phone but it wouldn't turn on, neither would my radio.  Panic creeped on the edges of my mind but I pushed it back.



Someone must be controlling the train. I couldn't decide if finding the person was suicide or not considering what happened at the station but waiting for whatever happens at HeiAn didn't sound much better.



I tried to get up from my seat but something was pulling at my arm.



the train was engulfed in darkness as a hand came over my mouth.



Struggling was no use as I felt like a fly trapped in a web. A whispering murmur played in my ear.



"sssshhhh".



I stopped and saw red glowing eyes from the window. one pair of eyes quickly became two, four, and then dozens in every window.



"Don't look at them" I heard in a whispering voice.



The windows started to flex with their high pitch shrieks and wails. Sounds that left a scar on my conscience. Sometimes when I close my eyes I still see their piercing red eyes and their shrieks echoing in my head.



When it finally stopped I didn't notice. I heard nothing but them and saw nothing but total darkness clamping around me. Felt like death, maybe even worse than that.



"When did the lights come on?" I asked over a mumbling murmur.



A hand grabbed mine, firmly squeezing. "They are gone now."



"Gone" I repeated as the world around me started to lose its haze.



Sitting in the sit right next to mine was a woman in her early 20s. Incredibly pale, and almost paper thin.



"What were those things?"



Her eyes drifted down from my face to my chest.



"Those are lovely flowers," she said.



"Thanks, but what the hell are those, The HellHounds?"



She looked back up at my face "HellHounds?"



"HellHounds, like demon dogs, dogs from Hell..."



she nodded but her eyes fell back down to the flowers. "Where did you get such lovely flowers?"



"They aren't mine."I said while giving her the bouquet with the card.



She started reading silently to herself. I got to stretch my legs and peer down the empty corridor. Nothing but seemingly endless trains cars.



Looking back at the woman from before I saw that she was crying.



"Are you all.." she sprung up out of her sit and ducked under my arm running down the corridor. She said something through the tears that I didn't hear.



"..Wait" I called out, chasing the only somewhat sane person who knew anything about this place. No matter how fast I ran, the distance between us only lengthened.  a few feet away quickly became dozens till she was outta my view completely. Almost like she dropped under the horizon all at once. I ran and ran but never caught up exhausting myself till I sat on a new row of sits.



Panting, and completely out of breath. "the only person that seemed... to know anything  about anything gone into the wind"



The train cars disappeared off into the horizon. It was pitch black outside and I couldn't see even a couple of inches in front of my face like I was swallowed into a void.



Those train cars are truly endless, my watch is stuck at 2：13 AM so, I don't know how many hours I walked. I might as well just stand in place. Dehydration would probably kill me in 2 or 3 days if this goes on. I would rather take my chances jumping from a 400 kph train than to die like that. Quick and painless, though my mom always said I was stubborn and that quality of ours kept me going.



All the train car lights started to flicker as the train slowed to complete halt. Taking my chances I tried to pull open the train door but it didn't budge. I was so focused on opening the door that I didn't realize the lights were.off till a pair of red glowing eyes peered back at me.



A loud frenzy of screeches followed as hundreds of red eyes peered through the window. I was too afraid to breathe, let alone move.



The sound of cracking glass echoed from behind me.



"Shit"



They burst through flooding into the room and I never ran faster.



I felt their breath on my neck and their claws at my heels. Never looked back a single time but saw thousands trying to break the windows I ran past. And then my worst fear. A dead end.



"What, how?" It's like the end of a train car just appeared in front of me.



They were at every window and quickly swarming down the passage.



No escape.



I turned around.



These things, I saw them but I can't really describe them. My eyes didn't understand what they were looking at.



Readying my fists as a blinding light lit up the entirety of the train car. I couldn't see anything but I heard them wrath in pain with the clattering of their feet scurrying off.



When my eyes readjusted it was as if they vanished into thin air. All the broken windows were good as new, and no broken glass. The only proof they were here at all was a nasty gnash on my arm. Must have gotten me when I wasn't looking, but at least it wasn't my throat.



I wandered.forward till a hand gripped my shoulder.



"Are you okay?"



When I saw the women.from before I had a mix of spiraling relief,and anger



"Your arm?" she asked



She banadged me up as we sat together in silence. I had a million questions but I couldn't ask them, I guess it was the shock.of what I just went through.



"All done"



I pulled my arm back examining the bandages.



"You're really good at this," I told her.



”I should be, I'm a nurse"



"A train nurse?"



"Certified and everything" she replied, not hearing my dumb question.



I looked at her, really looked at her.  Flowers clutched in her hands and not a speck of dirt or wrinkle on her clothes. She looked like she had just left home and got on the train just a few moments ago.



"How long have you been on this train?"



She looked back at me as if she was lost in thought. A few seconds passed before she leaned back and sat forward.



"Do you have a working phone or anything?"



She didn't answer.



"Hey, I just realized I don't know your name. Mine is Tobey. You?"



Her face lit up as she looked at me. "My name is Lisa"



"Well, Lisa...Something about this train isn't right, Lisa. I think we better find a way off but I need your help to do that."



"Okay", she says as the scent of flowers hit my nose.



"Lisa? Like the name on the card?"



"Yeah my boyfriend sent this to me, I guess he really does care. Thank you for delivering them, I was so...Like lost before."



"umm..Yeah no problem. Now we need..."



A familiar ringing sound echoed throughout the room.



"Next stop: Hei An"



At this point I forgot this train ever had an original destination at all.  Wasn't sure to stay on the train or risk getting off into what could possibly be Hell on Earth.



Lisa's face was one of muted dread. "Should we hide?"



Hide? I thought. The only place I could think to hide is under the seats and no way am I fitting in 6 inches of space in the most obvious spot ever.



"Where?"



"Anywhere."



I refrained myself from any sarcastic retort as the train speed indicator began to descend.



I ducked behind the row of seats in front of me and Lisa soon crouched beside me. I almost told her maybe she should hide.behind a different row but having another person next to me give me comfort. Probably a false comfort.



The speed of the train dropped and dropped till leveling off at 70 kmh. Everything was silent, even the rustling of the train was barely a whisper. My heart didn't dare beat too loudly.



The silence was soon broken by a slapping sound from the train cars ahead of ours. I couldn't quite place it till Lisa said "Is that footsteps?"



They became louder and louder.till they were almost deafening then it just stopped.



A voice boomed from the front of the car.



"Tobey, it's your stop."



"How did he know my name?" I thought I tried to peek between the seats.



"Tobey, Tobey, Tobey... It's your time to go." smacking the top of a seat with a baton. "You've been marked, and they're waiting."



What's he talking about? Whatever, it was. I bet I rather not find out and with him checking every aisle we did the only thing we could.



Run.



Lisa was the first to burst into a full sprint right behind me. I heard him grumble but I couldn't make any of it out.



We ran and I kept checking behind but he wasn't chasing. Distance just gave comfort. A false comfort.



Lisa screamed and my head snapped back to look ahead. He was standing in the doorway in front of us.



"You can't run away"



The slamming of the door behind us cemented that fact.



"Who are you?" I asked.



He took a few menacing steps forward "The conductor, and my job is too remove the vermin like you"



A few moments of silence "Then talk us home, no way we are going to HeiAn."



His covered his eyes before slamming his heavy baton into the seat several times



"You can't go back!"



He took a few steps forward and he swung at us just missing my head.



Before I knew it his hand gripped around my wrist dragging me closer to the open door. No matter how I struggled he didn't slow down.



Lisa sprung up and kicked him in the back of his knee causing him to let go of both himself and his baton while falling out of the train car.



Lisa extended a hand while another hand gripped around the door frame. Without a second to spare, I bashed the conductor’s head in with his own baton dropping him out of the quickly closing door. He ran alongside the train pounding on the door but it was futile and then he was gone.



Not knowing what to do next and exhausted I took a seat and looked over at Lisa. Her exhausted face lost quickly to my blurring vision.



Everything went dark.



The chirping of birds stirred me awake and my eyes opened to the blue cloud patchy skies.



“Where am I?” I said as I stood up. I was alone and a few dozen feet from the tracks surrounded by empty fields. 



With the warmth of sunlight on my skin “I made it back.”



Editor’s note:



I did some research and found out that there was a body found on the tracks on the opposite side of the country. A woman clutching a bouquet of flowers, her name was Lisa Chen.



The article was dated 2021.



I don’t know what to make of this. I couldn’t find any other article and my head has been hurting all day since I got home.



If you can share anything you find about her, I appreciate it and thank you all for hearing me out. I've been feeling tired all day, it's probably nothing but I’m gonna go to the doctor’s tomorrow.
