A fierce burning on my thigh yanks my focus. My finger slips on the controller, and crimson splatters on my screen.

“Head shot! BOOM!” Don’s voice screeches into my headset and I yank it off, cursing.

I look at the burning spot. My birthmark seems a little inflamed. Did something bite me there?

“I was distracted, dude,” I yell into the mic.

“Excuses, bitch!”

I drop the headset and exit the game. Don will call me a sore loser, but I don’t care. I’ve warned him for the last time to stop calling me a bitch.

I press down on the skin next to my birth mark. The redness gets more vivid with the skin taut. I flinch as another searing pain shot through the spiral mark.

I’ve a love-hate relationship with my birth mark. Love, because it’s cool as hell.  Who else has a perfect, fibonacci proportioned spiral as a birthmark? Hate, because the universe seems out to get it. It’s easily aggravated. Insects love biting in that spot. Cuts happen to land there. In the summer heat, it rashes. In the winter, it cracks.

I grab a half-used tub of aloe vera and slather some on. The relief is instant, but short-lived. Another stab of pain.

It’s never been this bad before. I study the skin. The spiral is filling up with welts, such that it’s getting three dimensional on my skin.

I trace the spiral and the burn intensifies.

I think about going to the doctor. But it’s late, and I don’t want to pay extra for night charges. So I do the next best thing.

I down a bottle of wine, grab an ice pack, strap it to my thigh, and fall asleep.

\*\*\*

The man’s face is lit by candle light. He’s kneeling, bound. The veins on his forehead are bulging. His right eye is swollen shut. Red lines trace across the whites of his left eye. Sweat slicks his face and neck. His breath comes in laboured rasps.

“Let him go.” I hear myself say in a lower pitch than my actual voice. I feel the blood throbbing through my veins. An icy rage envelops me.

“Or?” a voice sneers. I look up at an ugly face full of glee. My brain tells me that the tall, heavyset man before me is called Naro. He walks over to the man with the swollen eye, and something flashes in the dull orange light.

A gaping tear blooms on the bound man’s chest. A guttural scream escapes the man before he squashes it. Blood spurts from the torn flesh.

I feel that tear in my heart. Sharp despair lines my gut. I want to make a rush at Naro, disarm him. But I’m bound too, I realise.

“Or I will spend the rest of my life making you pay,” I hiss.

“Do that. Live a long, healthy life. I wanna watch you try.” The man splits the bound man’s flesh again, carves out another chunk of meat.

This time, the man doesn’t make a sound. But his pain slams into my mind.

“Stop!”

“Say please.”

“Please.”

“Nope.” The man tears another chunk of flesh from the man’s arm. He holds the chunk in my face, the tendrils and muscles dripping blood.

I scream.

And I awake, soaked in perspiration. Fear cloaks my senses. It takes me a moment to realise I’m back in my bed.

I find the switch, and sit in the fluorescent light for a good twenty minutes before I’m able to move. It is unlike any nightmare I have ever had. It was so visceral, so real. And the heartbreak. The intense terror and pain. That crazed need to protect the bound man.

I’ve been playing too many violent games. I’m going to tone it down. Play Stardew Valley or something for a while.

I can’t take my mind off the dream. The emotions feel seared into my body. I’m still shaking by the time I’m sipping coffee at the table. I can’t imagine going into the office in that state, so I call in sick.

A heavy shadow clings to me the entire morning. There’s a crushing sense of loss I can’t make sense of.

My birth mark has turned a violent maroon. The welts are filled with pus. I’m burning up. It looks like calling in sick wasn’t a lie after all.

I get dressed, slowly. Even putting my arms through my sleeves hurt. I head out the door, and the sun hits my eyes like a hammer.

I groan and shield my eyes with my arm. I give up on public transport and call a taxi.

\*\*\*

The doctor is alarmed by my welts. He insists on an immediate incision and drainage procedure. I agree.

The pain is unbearable. I scream as he cuts the abscess open and drains the pus. It feels like he’s boring a hole in my thigh with a jet of boiling water. The doctor looks stunned by my scream, then miffed. “It doesn’t usually hurt,” he says, accusatorily. I want to punch him in the face.

He cleans the wound, each swipe of disinfectant feeling like acidic sandpaper on raw flesh.

I’m trembling and sweating in pain by now. The doctor stares at me, puzzled. “You have a really low pain tolerance,” he comments. I grip my fists tight and ignored him.

He gives me a course of antibiotics. Strong ones. And pills to bring down my fever. And sends me home.

When I reach home, I take the medication and pass out on the couch.

I awake at night from the pain. I undo the dressing, and see pus and blood pouring from the spiral. A wave of nausea sweeps through my stomach, and I dry retch.

I’ve barely laid back down before I pass out from the pain.

And the next dream begins.

I’m cradling the body of the man I saw. Calling his name. “Boe, please. Please don’t leave me. Please.”

I’m wrecked with sorrow. I’ve never felt anything of that intensity. That level of pain. That pure despair.

And rage. Such rage. It doesn’t feel natural for my body to be able to harbour such intense rage. I worry that my flesh might crack apart, and send forth waves of hatred and fury to demolish everything in its path.

I want to kill Naro. I need to kill Naro.

But I can’t get to him. I writhe in my helplessness and rage.

That’s when I make the terrible decision. One I never thought I’d turn to.

My family is more than familiar with spells and curses. And one curse, above all, was strictly forbidden. Used only once in our family’s history, by my grandmother.

My mother told the story often. I think telling the story helped her heal. Helped her make sense of it. My grandmother had only one daughter. My mum. My grandfather wanted more children. A boy, above all. But a birth complication had rendered my grandmother infertile.

So my grandfather had taken home a mistress. It slowly drove my grandmother mad. She had finally snapped, and cast a curse on my grandfather.

She sat down, wrote of a death - my grandfather’s. Then she carved a perfect spiral onto her arm. Carved it, while chanting strange words. My mother repeated those words often when she told the story. The first time she told the story, she left out the words. The second time, she said them in a trembling voice. Her tone became bolder over the years. I think it was her way of taking away its power, to show that she was no longer afraid of those words.

The strange words had a lyrical tilt. And were composed of simple syllables. I could see how my mother remembered them so clearly, so many years later. That, plus the trauma of it all.

My mother couldn’t stop her, and was too young to understand exactly what my grandmother was doing. Not until it was too late.

My grandmother ended the ritual by pressing the piece of paper, with grandfather’s death written, onto the spiral wound on her arm.

My grandfather died of a heart attack that night. Just like what my grandmother had written, on the piece of paper. So did my grandmother.

I sit up. I’ve no paper with me, but there’s cloth. I untie the cloth knotted around my lifeless husband’s wrists, and write, with his blood, on the long strip of cloth.

Pain, agony, death. I hesitate, then dip my finger in more blood. In this life, and the next.

Then I begin to scratch out a spiral, as perfect as I could make it, on my thigh. I’ve to press hard for my nail to rake the skin. I tear off a strip of skin, then another. I don’t flinch at the pain. At that point, with my husband dead beside me, the pain feels cathartic.

Naro comes in then. Looks at me in my madness, and laughs.

He just watches as I complete the spiral, chanting the familiar words spun from memory. He calls out to his men, “Look at this crazy bitch!”

I take the cloth with the blood written words, and I press it onto the spiral.

Naro just laughs, and laughs. Until the cloth begins to flame. I scream then. Pain tears through the spiral into my bones. The cloth burns into a blackened crisp, leaving just the spiral wound on my thigh.

Naro’s eyes widen. And he begins to clutch at his chest. He pulls his shirt aside. A spiral marks  his chest.

A spasm of pain rips through my spiral wound. I flinch, and moments later, Naro doubles over in pain. I grin.

\*\*\*

I awake to Don knocking on my door.

I push past the crippling headache and pain in every part of my body and open it.

“I feel like shit,” he says. He looks like shit. Pale, shaking, sweating.

“What the hell. Me too.” I weakly gesture for him to come in.

“What happened to you?” he asks once we’re seated.

“This,” I say, showing him the spiral of blood and pus on my thigh. “Think it got infected.” No way was I telling him about the crazy dreams.

Colour bleeds from his already pale face.

He stares at the wound on my thigh, a touch of horror in his eyes.

“Gross, huh?” I ask.

“It’s…” he stops abruptly, and just stares at my wound.

“I don’t know what happened. Bunch of welts, then this, after the doctor drained them. That reminds me,” I say and reach out to down the antibiotic pills.

“I…I saw it,” he sputters. “I thought it was just a stupid dream, but…”

“Saw what?”

“The spiral. I saw it. In a dream,” Don says, voice uncertain, almost embarrassed.

My jaw tenses. “What do you mean?”

“I saw…there was this…well this woman was carving it on her thigh. I…I remembered you had a birthmark right where she carved it. It looked…I thought of you…I thought maybe…I…after the dream, I thought of you and I just felt like I needed to come see you.”

A chill sips into my veins.

“Was there a man, dead? Tied up?”

He stares at me with horror.

“Yes. You dreamt of her too?”

“I was the woman. In the dream.”

He’s silent. He keeps staring at me. His pale face mirrors mine. His forehead is too, beaded with sweat.

Then silently, he pulls down the neck of his tee shirt.

A dark crimson spiral marks his chest.

I gasp. Another wave of pain roils through my body. Then it clicks. A stab of fear pierces my gut.

“You’re…you’re Naro. The murderer.”

His face darkens. I swallow.

“And you’re the one who doomed us both. For two lifetimes.”

Rage sweeps through my body. My face heats up.

“Because you murdered my husband,” I spit. Then I blink, surprised. The fury was sudden, intense.

“Your husband from a past life. Why the hell did you have to damn us both, this life too?”

I have nothing to say. But rage keeps rising, overwhelming me in waves. I want to reach out, slam his face into the table. To tear at his eyes.

But I bury the feelings, force myself to be logical.

“So, you don’t think it’s just a dream,” I say.

“Not if we both had it. And from different points of view.”

“The spiral on your chest, it appeared the day we were gaming?”

He nods. “Shortly after you logged off.”

It’s getting less and less likely that it was all just a series of coincidences.

“It’s getting worse,” I say. I slump over on the sofa. I can’t keep my head up from the weakness and the pain.

“Same.”

“Did you see how long it took? From the pain, ‘til death?”

“In the dream? No. I awoke after you…that woman was chanting, pressing stuff against the spiral.”

My legs are beginning to ache in a horrendous way. Like little cracks are forming in the bones.

“Why’s this happening now?” I ask.

He shrugs, “How the hell would I know.”

I study his face. He looks about the age Naro was in the dream. I don’t theorise out loud.

“So… we just…we die?” I ask instead.

“I was hoping you could undo this.”

“Me?” I say weakly. “I don’t know what this is.”

“Do you remember the words? What you…that woman did?”

“Sort of, not really. Not exactly. I…”

“You did this,” he snarls, grabs my shirt, face wrecked with pain. “You undo it.”

Rage surges once again, mixed with fear. “You did this. Murderer,” I bark, shoving him hard.

He stumbles back, then bends over in pain.

“Get out!” I cry, then pull out my phone. “Get out before I call the cops.”

He lunges at me, tries to grab at my phone.

I dodge, causing pain to ripple up my side.

I dial the police. The phone rings. He swears, turns, and staggers out of my apartment.

I hang up. Limp to the door, lock it. Then I slide to the ground, giving in to the pain.

\*\*\*

It’s night now. The pain has only gotten worse. I don’t even know how I’ve typed this all out. I keep having to stop, to let the roaring waves of pain subside before I can continue.

The wound is crusted up now, with new welts pushing the bits of dried blood up.

The medication doesn’t help. The painkillers don’t work.

Just two days ago, I was planning out a month-long trip for the end of the year. I was thinking of quitting. Changing jobs. Getting an internship at a botany design place.

Now I’m in almost constant, unbearable pain. And apparently, about to die.

My feet have turned purple. And the veins around my hands are blackened. I might call the ambulance soon. Maybe other doctors can help. I doubt it, in my heart of hearts, but it’s worth trying.

I think of the rage I felt in my past life, the rage that leaked over into this one. I understand why she did what she did, the woman who I might have been in the past life.

But I don’t want that fate. Not in this life. I resent the woman. I resent Naro. They should have kept their bullshit in their own lifetimes. Another blast of pain.

I’m calling the ambulance now. I don’t know how, but I’m going to fight this. Fuck Naro. I’m not dying with him. Not this time[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkSeas/)
