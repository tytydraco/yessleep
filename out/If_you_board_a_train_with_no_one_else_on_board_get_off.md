While my phone still has a charge, I need to write this down and share it with you all so that you don’t make the mistake I made. I no longer exist, at least in the world I once was in. I’ve been onboard this train transcending time and space for the last three days, and I’m still trying to understand how this happened. I know this probably sounds like confused ramblings to you all reading this, so allow me to explain.

It all started when I got off work three days ago. I had to work late and finally finished around midnight. I don’t own a car currently and live, or at least used to live, too far to walk or bike to work from home. I also don’t take the bus; it takes too long, and I’ve learned that taking the train is much quicker than getting to and from work. When I arrived at the subway, I sat on the bench and waited for my train. While sitting there, I scrolled through my social media, looking at the happy lives of my friends and family. My sister posted pictures of her family on their trip to Venice, Italy. A few more scrolls down, I saw that my old high school friend had proposed to his girlfriend of three years. The more I scrolled, the more I realized how alone and unaccomplished I was. I don’t have a girlfriend or a family outside of my parents and sister. I haven’t done much with my life. After I graduated high school, I went into the Army but was dishonorably discharged a year in for getting into a physical altercation with a 2nd Lieutenant. After getting discharged, I hopped around different low-end jobs and finally landed the job I now have as a desk worker. It doesn’t pay the best but is luxurious compared to my previous burger joints and cashier jobs. Still, I’m 28 years old, and it’s as if my life is just passing by, and I have no chance of experiencing it. 

In the middle of my self-pity party, my train pulled up. I got up, boarded the train, and sat at the bench closest to the door. After sitting down, I quickly realized no one else was in my carriage. This isn’t normal, and even though it’s late, I’ve never found a carriage completely empty. Upon this revelation, I got up and looked through both door windows into the other carriages. Still, I didn’t see anyone in them either. At first, this frightened me and presented me with feelings of unease. I thought that maybe I should get off this train and take a taxi home. But I quickly pushed off the anxiety I was feeling and told myself, “At least I don’t have to deal with any late-night weirdos.” The train finally started, and upon leaving the station, I sat back and pulled my phone back out to play my puzzle game. In the middle of me playing on my phone, the lights in the carriage started to flicker. It startled me, but I assumed it was due to the typical shitty maintenance of the train, good ole American Infrastructure. However, after the lights seemed to fight to stay on for about a minute, they went completely dark. I couldn’t see anything beyond the light of my phone screen. It was solid dark in the carriage for at least 30 seconds. I was about to turn my phone flashlight on when a sudden bright flash burst through the darkness and directly into my eyes.

The strength of the light was so intense I became disoriented. Then, as fast as the light came, it disappeared. While my vision was still blinded due to the light, I became deafened by sudden voices all around me. The next thing that came was the smell of musk. The closest thing I could describe it as is it smelled like you dived into a pool full of football players' jerseys and jockstraps after a long game in the middle of summer in Alabama. When my vision returned, I realized where the stink and sounds came from. Somehow, my carriage was packed to the brim with people. I was taken aback by how quickly I went from being alone to being surrounded by people. I jumped backward with a yell and quickly gained the attention of the people around me. Everyone stopped to look at me and promptly returned to their conversations or whatever they were doing before. The next thing I knew, some kid who couldn't be older than 13 came up to me begging to use my phone to try to call his parents. The kid stunk and had long, stringy hair sticking to his forehead with acne and sweat to accompany it. Before I could answer, a woman who looked to be in her twenties with curly brunette hair came up behind him and told him not to scare the new guy already. With a look of defeat on his face, the kid apologized for jumping me and returned to his seat further down the carriage. The woman followed the boy back to his seat with her gaze before turning back to me and sticking her hand out for a handshake.

 Luna: "Hello, my name is Luna, what's yours?" 

After a brief pause, I stuck my hand out in return.  

James: "Uhm, James." 

Luna: "Nice to meet you, James. I just wish it had been under better circumstances." 

Still reeling from what was going on, I asked,

James: "Yeah, uhh, can you explain to me what the fuck is going on right now?" 

Luna: "Hey, no need for that kind of language. I understand it is scary when you are new, but children are nearby." 

Awestruck, I looked around and saw a woman holding a child to the immediate right of me, staring at me with a frown. I apologized and looked back at Luna. 

James: "Please explain to me what is happening and how you and everyone else got onto my carriage." 

\*Luna frowned\*

Luna: "Well, actually, I don't fully understand it. I've been on here for the last two weeks, and from what I have gathered, everyone ended up here after getting onto a train with no one else on it, and then suddenly, the lights in the carriage go out, and a very bright light blinds them. When you finally regain your vision and senses, you realize you are no longer alone. Sounds like what you experienced?" 

After registering what she said, I replied,

James: "Uhh yeah, that's what I just experienced." 

\*Luna smiled\*

Luna: "Yep, I remember going through that." 

James: "Wait, didn't you say you've been on here for two weeks? Have you not gotten to your stop?"

 Luna laughed,

Luna: "Funny thing, I don't think my stop exists anymore, and I'm willing to bet yours doesn't either." 

Her last statement made me nervous. 

James: "What do you mean by that?" 

Luna: "Exactly what I said, my stop and your stop no longer exist. I don't know if you will believe this. It took me a few days, but once you experienced that flash, you transcended into a different plane of reality."

Her remark makes me want to question her sanity, a different reality. She couldn't be serious, but before I could respond, she cut me off. 

Luna: "Trust me, I know it sounds crazy, but can you think of an explanation for how you entered an empty carriage, the light went out, you somehow saw a bright light that made you temporarily blind, and then when you regained your sight, you found yourself in a loaded carriage with people in different states of cleanliness?" 

I sat with her remark for a while and eventually had to concede to her question. I had no idea how anything had happened in the last five minutes. Still, I couldn’t believe that one second, I was on my way home, and the next, I was in an entirely different existence. 

James: “Okay, so if what you said is true, how do I get out of here? Do I need to get off and board a train going in the opposite direction?” 

Before I could continue, she cut me off.

Luna: “There is no going back, and trust me, you don’t want to get off this train.” 

Puzzled, I had to ask the obvious. 

James: “Well, why not?”

After a moment of silence, Luna looked uncomfortable.

Luna: “Like I said, we are in a different reality. None of the stops are in our previous reality, and each stop is a game of Russian Roulette. In my short time here, I’ve seen several different stops. Some look nice, like the front cover of a luxury resort brochure. Others look…well…less inviting.” 

Luna stopped and seemed to stare off into a horizon that wasn’t there.

James: “What wasn’t inviting about it?”

Luna seemed uncomfortable but responded.

Luna: “Well, one stop looked like hell. Like an actual lake of fire with the sounds of thousands of people screaming in pain. In the distance, there were flying demons that looked like bats but were the size of a small airplane. I could feel the intense heat from the open door. Of course, no one got off at that stop.”

This was still all too much for me to comprehend. One second, I’m on my way home, and the next, I’m here learning that “hell” is an actual place I could get off at. While gearing up to ask more questions, the train began to slow down, and the intercom said.

Intercom: “Alright, passengers. The next stop is Pearlwave Bay. To the passengers of carriage 48, please make sure at least five of you depart your carriage so we can stay in regulation. If five do not volunteer, we will have to send the authority to choose which of you to remove.”

The person on the intercom spoke in a startling, soft, but disturbing voice. I looked out the window as we began to stop at Pearlwave Bay. It was beautiful, reminiscent of Luna’s earlier comment that some stops look like the front cover of a luxury resort brochure. In the distance was a beach with sparkling water. The beach was abandoned but had several umbrellas with chairs set up. There were also a few Caribbean-style huts that appeared abandoned. The sky was a bright blue, with only a few clouds scattered across the sky. The sun was shining, and I could feel its warmth coming through my window. Overall, this looked like a dream location. I turned to Luna, who appeared to have a grim facial expression.

James: “Hey, what’s wrong? This looks like a great vacation spot?”

Luna: “That’s the thing, it looks like a great place to get off and stay, right? You don’t know if this is a facade to make you feel welcome for slaughter or just a nice beach.” 

James: “A ‘slaughter,’ what are you talking about?” 

Before Luna could respond, I saw four people from the carriage next to ours get off at the stop. I looked at the door and saw that it was the 48th carriage that the intercom spoke about. That would make the carriage I am in the 49th. The four people who exited the carriage appeared to be a family with a father and mother figure and two kids, one a boy and the other a girl. The parents looked to be in their forties, while the boy looked twelve and the girl appeared to be eight. They also looked like they were still reasonably clean, similar to me, so they must have just gotten on the train in the last day or so. They huddled around the father, trying to appear confident in their decision to get off at this location. While watching them make slow steps further away from the train, I heard the intercom come back on. 

Intercom: “Carriage 48, only four of the five have gotten off. You have thirty seconds to volunteer one more person to get off the carriage. If no one removes themselves, the authority will decide for you.”

The last statement came through with tangible harshness. I looked at the door window into carriage 48 and saw utter panic with people arguing and pointing at one another. From what I could hear through the door, people were yelling, “YOU, YOU HAVE BEEN HERE THE LONGEST!”  I also hear someone yell, “YOU ARE THE OLDEST! SACRIFICE YOURSELF!” I saw no one get off, and after thirty seconds, the intercom came back on. 

Intercom: “Alright, carriage 48, the Authority is coming to remove one of you.” 

Suddenly, carriage 48 turned quiet. I turned to Luna to ask. 

James: “Who or what is the ‘Authority?’”

Luna: “You will see soon enough.”

I looked out the train window and saw the family standing close by, but they all turned to look at the carriage they had previously stepped out of. Suddenly, a massive figure standing around 8 feet tall came walking toward carriage 48 from what looked like the front of the train. The figure, who I assumed was the "Authority" mentioned over the intercom, appeared human but without a nose or mouth. It only had two eyes, which burned a dark crimson. It was wearing what seemed to be an old train conductor outfit. It walked past the family and stepped into carriage 48. Frantic screaming erupted in the carriage next door, and around five seconds later, the Authority stepped back out with a young woman. The woman was carried by her left leg, which looked twisted and broken. She was frantically trying to claw at the doorway or anything she could to hold onto. Her hands finally found the door handle, and she clutched it with all her might. The Authority kept walking forward until it realized the woman was holding onto the door handle. The Authority let go of her leg and grabbed her left arm. Without hesitation, the Authority ripped the woman's hand off. The woman released the door handle with her other hand to grasp her newly amputated limb. Blood from the woman's arm was shooting everywhere, including on the family, who I just realized were screaming bloody murder. In a moment of intense courage, the father charged the Authority and tried to tackle it to the ground.

However, the Authority didn't budge and instead turned towards the man with no facial expression. When the man realized his mistake, he turned back towards his family to run. Still, it was no use as the Authority grabbed ahold of him by his head and, within an instant, popped his head open like a watermelon. It was chaos; the children were screaming, trying to run towards their now-deceased father while the mother held onto them with a face of horror. The Authority turned back towards the front of the train. It returned to the engine from where it came, disregarding the carnage it left outside carriage 48. Soon after the Authority boarded the engine, the train began to pull off. As we began to pass by the five passengers, I made eye contact with the young woman who expressed genuine, untamed fear. The intercom came back on. 

Intercom: "Let's hope our former passengers enjoy their stay at Pearlwave Bay." 

I looked at Luna, whose facial expression seemed to be a mix of sorrow and resignation. She turned away and made her way back to her seat. I turned back to the horizon before we passed through a tunnel to leave Pearlwave Bay. I could swear I saw large ripples in the water in the distance before the bricks and dark of the tunnel cut off my gaze. 

After Pearlwave Bay, we stopped at a few other locations. One was a snowy wonderland, one was a forest village, and the last was a Mountain cabin. Fortunately, no one had to depart again. Our carriage will likely have to depart a few members at the next stop as we seem to have reached capacity.

My phone battery is at 78%, so I will stop here. Please heed my warning: if you board a train with no one on it, immediately get off!
