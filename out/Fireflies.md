What is the secret word for all the goodness in the world?

If you know where to look, on a humid July night, you can find it in a churchyard near the Potomac River.

There, you’ll discover, bottled into three sounds inside a glass jar wrapped by a label with eight letters, one name buried in a chest of pirate gold, like a twirling waltz in 3:8 time.

Each letter holds a clue to the warm glow of summer lightning bugs housed inside.

But to experience the warmth of gentle summer nights, you need to first know the chill of spring and autumn. Because as Tolkien, who loved riddles, said, “What lies beyond stars and under hills, comes first and follows after” is darkness.

I write these words in the darkness of a cold hospital room, with two books left here by others who didn’t know me, my company on Christmas Eve: The Hobbit and The Bible. Their stories meander with mine.

This secret word, my buried treasure, knew darkness too, but not in the dramatic way of martyrs like Job or Jesus. Hers was in an understated Bilbo Baggins way that appreciates the little things. My vanquisher of sadness, my breaker of night, was not a grey wizard with the Staff of Moses. She was an unassuming little dirty-blond girl, reluctant and unexpected, as true heroes always are, the glowing ember in my journey there and back again, through Mirkwood, over the Misty Mountains, into the fiery cauldron of Mordor, and on to the Shire.

Nobody loved a cozy Hobbit hole more than this creature of green pastures, she and her elf dog, Sparkly Wigglebutt.

But like a gentle Shire brook trickling over rocks that form ripples rising out of the water, this bubbly river otter knew her share of sadness. There is salt even in the clearest ocean and steam rising from the deepest trenches where it is said life began, so there was already a drop of black yin in the sea of white yang that came into my life one New York winter night on the Upper West Side, in the form of goodness that had sadness in her, too.

She was the first person I knew to have taken antidepressants, and I called her the crazy one for it. No words were ever more misplaced. When a dark cloud of yin consumed all the yang that had accumulated in my luck-stricken life for 42 years, that little drop of sadness became the source of her unending understanding. She accepted me when I lost my ring of sleep in Gollum’s cave, and storm clouds rained down a relentless hail of depression as I desperately searched in vain for rest like Sméagol crying over his lost precious.

So, what is this secret word?

This Ark of the Covenant housing summer’s embers rests, not on four golden legs like the one Moses built, but on two legs, a living da Vinci code that needs an Indiana Jones to crack, letter by letter. She met him once and always kept him in her passwords. So here’s my best effort to raid the Lost Ark, HarrisonJacksonFord style.

What starts with caring, curious, cute, cuddly, compassionate, mainly composed, but sometimes not?

When a person lives in your memory and you in theirs, is there one face from a moment in time that stays? Was it as kids on the school bus to Indian Lane? Was it in my 20s when a chance encounter led to a ruined Barbour jacket? Was it in my 30s when a hand tapped my shoulder at my little brother’s Lincoln Center wedding as Wynton Marsalis played the first dance with his trumpet? Was it in my 40s as she slept in a chair beside my bed in the hospital? Was it eating fish fingers in bed in Anguilla or nibbling ramen in bed on Kalorama? Was it lying sideways on the sofa at P Street, M Street, or Pecks Point? Or was it a revolving door, like a little warm nook, the sound of a suitcase dropping on the floor at midnight, soft paws running out, a sleepy voice in the background mumbling, “Hey,” before rolling back over to sleep, my side of the bed already turned down to crawl right in.

The answer to these questions is the second letter —

All of them.

April. April first. April fools. One little joker appeared in a mixed litter of mutts on an island in the Chespeake that was the first place in Maryland to be settled, born of a stray dog, Naomi, who a mailman kept finding on his route in the remote hills of West Virginia, begging each day for food, a trait she’d soon pass on to the most talented beggar of all time, whose adorable eyes coaxed the mailman into finally bringing her home, and later giving her over to foster care, our little clown already growing fast inside mama Naomi as the surprises of a lifetime, one advertised as a Shepherd mix who was anything but, and had it in his blood to win over the hearts of every mailman, delivery person, and grounds worker he ever met all of whom ended up working for him, a perennial prankster who got the last laugh, tricking us into falling in love with him on first site as a two week old in a photo captioned “Peter Rabbit,” but who despite his bunny legs and Beatrixe Potter personality, was always for her, from the moment she first saw him, a different name, never once imagining he’d be part of our family, having told me long before her finger swiped over the adoption listing on City Dogs Rescue, that the only way I could bring home a pup was to put a ring on it.

No words were ever taken more literally. I’ve always been fast at problem solving, like Saint Mark writing the shortest account of Jesus’ life, so it only took me six weeks to go through the secret adoption process, and show up, one Friday evening as the sun was setting on the steps of the Jefferson Memorial, with a tiny puppy in my arms, who, before she spotted him, caught the eye of a group of visiting school kids, swarming me first in the dozens, then hundreds, to pet the little fur ball as I proceeded towards her, like a Pied Piper arriving with his flock, my flute, a little beagle mut wearing a royal blue neck band bearing a small pendant with the freshly printed words “Hello, my name is Peanut Butter,” whose eyes she saw first, two giant marbles that would become the source of all that connected us, our love of life's simple things, so that it didn’t matter that she only saw second the platinum diamond ring attached to that same collar, because the most unbreakable ring was the living one in my hands, my eternal companion, the one who took me to every forest path and river trail within two hours of all the places we’ve ever lived, not to mention every neighbor’s house to collect and bring my mischievous little runaway home, and her nighttime companion during all my long trips abroad, and more recently through my never-ending hospital stays, my cozy surrogate to keep a cold bed warm.

Speaking of river trails, a river runs through the third letter in the Garden of Eden, flanked on either side by the Tree of Life. It is said that this river brings the End of Night and the End of Curses in an eternal spring whose magic runs through Middle Earth, growing from a hidden trickle to an Enchanted River, from a quiet melody into a roaring Moldau symphony. This is the playful world of river otters and river chipmunks.

At my childhood home on Georgetown Pike, there was a creek that ran through life. I built dams in it every year, which, as I grew, got stronger and lasted longer before eventually always washing away in Spring floods, repetitive work that allowed me to develop as an artist and an engineer hand-in-hand in a way few pursuits offer a young mind, perhaps alongside writing music, which I also did. At that place called Cloisters, filled by the ever-present sound of little fingers on a Steinway and pencil ledgers on the back of my bedroom door marking heights on each birthday, in the height of summer, my younger brother Ben and I would head to the churchyard in back of our house after dinner at dusk with two glass jars, filling them with as many fireflies as we could find. Lightning bugs are notoriously hard to catch because, like Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, you can't know their location and direction at the same time. By the time you run to the site of a flash, they've already flown somewhere else in the night sky.

Ben loved bugs like no one else. I searched the markets of New Delhi one year for Glow Worm toys to surprise him on Christmas. In our churchyard in Mclean, the one where Christmas Day football games happened with me as the quarterback, where I learned to pitch curveballs by throwing at a strike zone I painted by hand onto a white shed with black ink from a mulberry tree, the same tree on whose low-hanging branches Lindsey Wheeler and I would later spend so many nights as high school sweethearts, that was the place where Ben and I would fill glass jars with hundreds of flashing lightening bugs, bringing them to our rooms as lanterns, like flickering candles whose embers disappeared as we dreamed. Futile as our efforts were to keep the glow burning overnight, Ben eventually connected me to one firefly whose ember never ran out, no matter how many nights she was at my bedside.

That is why this is the letter of The Remembrance of Things Past, because her voice is my Madeleine, conjuring memories from that churchyard that foretold her and millions of moments since then.

But this is also the letter of regret, the kind of hair-pulling loss and bewilderment that leads to frantically moving giant rocks at midnight, blasting Nirvana on the stereo, singing Idioteque at full volume, crying and shouting in the early morning darkness, running from myself and the world, Searching for Lost Time to escape everything that became broken as result of one night, dreaming of feeling whole again, chasing down any hint of who I was before through the eternal winter fog that enveloped me this year with no light on the horizon and no sign of lifting. This is the letter of 43, a number I don’t want to ever from a year I don't want to remember.

The fourth letter is, of course, what was always right in front of me because good things come in small packages. But it’s also the letter of sadness since, of course, I discovered that truth too late. Of course means 20/20 hindsight with no foresight in a world of tears running, drying, and still to come — so many I am now a river, the only river I never loved. “Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you if you can find my beloved; I am faint of heart.” But we didn’t go to church, so I never read those words until tonight in this hospital room.

Of course was also my intuition, my saving grace. It's what Arturo said allowed me to hold so many constituents with competing interests together, coaxing them to get the job I wanted done, despite and because of their differences. Arturo was my greatest teacher, and Hilda helped me discover how to bring dreams and companies to life. I owe so much of who I am to them — not the me of today, but the me of yesterday who gave back all he received and more. They showed me how to be strong, but never shrewd, like ego-driven companies with close-fisted cultures no one wants to be a part of. Instead, like them, I always gave the benefit of the doubt, letting intuition guide me in the drawing room, the board room, the salesroom, and at the negotiating table.

My firefly does that, too, in her own way with everyone she meets. That’s part of what connected us and why she is adored by everyone who knows her. Because we all want to live in a world that sees the glass as half full. She still sees me that way even after everything. My intuition about her was right. Never has one been more rewarded, perhaps undeservingly so.

Intuition is what caught my eyes when I saw her in my first year at Potomac, so many grades below me, and again the night before my first work trip abroad in my early 20s, just the same as it did in my 30s one Saturday afternoon in a stone Oxfordshire Orangerie bathed by music and light. Never has generosity been more pure than hers in a way no words can capture because life is lived, not written.

I lived 42 charmed years, either lucky or unlucky. Lucky to experience so much, so many adventures, such good around me; unlucky to learn so little about what it means to suffer, about that hidden half of the human condition that every true teaching is an attempt to make sense of, from the moment the apple was first picked in Eden to the last cry on the Cross. But you can't know that world from parables, you only know it when the darkness comes and rips your life apart, like a curse sent by God to Egypt, sent to me in my 43rd year. That’s how my hands and feet are nailed to a cross in the form of hospital needles as I stare glassy-eyed into the void, crying out in my head for a redeemer to take me away.

A redeemer did come tonight, not to bring me salvation but to show me what grace means. She appeared in the form of a crack-head named Kyvonna with a lazy eye, a sworn Crypt and supposed cousin of Snoop Dogg, who returned to the hospital on Christmas Eve, three hours after being discharged, the same day I met her, to bring me my one and only present. She came back for me, my secret Santa, bearing pretzels and Gatorade, like frankincense and myrgg. That is the kind of grace you can’t know until you're strung up on a post, thorns prodding your veins, your mouth parched dry, surrounded on either side by nameless sufferers bearing their own crosses… a mute with two teeth who could checkmate me in a dozen moves, a head-on car-crash survivor who graduated from one of the best school’s at 15 but now can’t string together a sentence, a card shark with 12 inches of stitches holding his head together having tried to end it all following a botched surgery that took away his vision without warning, a catatonic Mexican boy who mumbles incoherent phrases, a Native American woman who sits in silence all day with her ancestors, and my roommate, a dreadlocked homeless man suffering COPD who coughs all night long — all of us watched here by two Roman guards of Pontus Pilot, a Dutch-speaking nurse from Guyana, and a Francophone RN from Cameroon. Even the Christmas Truce of 1914 brought a more likely crew together for yuletide than our lot tonight.

Kyvonna coming back is why intuition only takes you so far, because life’s strangest, deepest lessons come from the places and times you could never imagine in your wildest dreams or scariest nightmares has been the case through my torturous, earth-shattering, eye-opening, all-encompassing 43rd year, one that as it draws to a close, has still left me breathing, sort of.

The fifth letter is the letter of limitless. Of keeping the heavy light, as she always did, making the light whole, the full following, and the flowing grounded.

It’s the letter of everything in its right place, which she managed, even when my world was spinning on its head. You create this balance by bringing two poles together like opposing magnets. That is what her force did for me, and hopefully, I did for her in moments.

If only doctors understood this. When you’re a hammer, everything’s a nail, and when you’re a psychiatrist, every problem’s a pill. Just as mice share 85% of our DNA, in the medieval world of psych drugs, we’re all mice being fed chemicals no one understands. That’s why most people who attempt suicide do so on meds as prescribed, as was my case all three times. The Columbine shooters were on SSRIs.

Correlation doesn’t equal causation, but Clay Christiansen, who mentored my best friend, Wrede, famously said that people don’t buy hammers to put nails in walls; they buy them to get a job done. Psychiatrists don’t understand what getting a job done means. Instead the hammer nails blindly into trees without seeing the forest.

In the northern forests of Canada, at my college, there was a pale-skinned, dark-eyed student who roamed the fringes of all experiences there. He was older than the rest of us at Bishop's because he never graduated despite getting perfect marks. Instead, he just continued to add new majors each year. So by the time I met Paul Michaud of Quebec City, he spoke eight languages fluently, all learned through classes he kept retaking until he had them memorized, like the name and birthdate of everyone he met on campus, including me, which he memorized from our first encounter. You could find Paul waiting outside on the pub on any given night as last call sounded, silently accompanying some group back to dorms over the Massawippi Arches, aurora borealis dancing in the northern sky, only to be seen a few hours later at the crack of dawn walking the first school group to morning classes, the same solemn, drained, expressionless, look in his eyes, one he could never shake. 

What made Paul the omnipresent lurker of campus nights, mornings, and all in between?

Insomnia.

“Dark shadows ring my eyes, yet my prayer is pure.”

Paul’s eyes were dark from never sleeping, but his heart was pure. I knew this because I made friends with him in a way few others did and came to understand the silent torture he suffered in a prison that never released him during the four years I was there. He was sleepless on the day I graduated, just like the day I arrived, and is probably still that wandering figure on campus decades later. No matter where he is, if he’s alive, he will remember and be able to tell you my birthday in any language.

During the time I knew Paul, I never imagined his quiet desperation foretold some part of my future, as the same black rings I first wrap his eyes eventually came to wrap the eyes of the only other true insomniac I ever met: me in my 43rd year. 

But this is not the letter of watching life go by, as Paul did, and as I’ve done this year, missing out on so many things, heartbreaking chances, the biggest ones  given to me, which arrived at the end of last year, the kind of surprise you wait 42 years for, hoping, like Field of Dreams, that if you build it, they will come. I saw Babe Ruth step up to the plate in November last year, but two months later, I was injured on the sidelines for the first time in my life, so I couldn’t throw my signature curve ball. I had to forfeit the matchup of a lifetime.

Instead of watching from the sidelines as Paul did, and I did this year, the fifth letter is the letter of living, childhood living, easy living, lucky love, young love, the kind I had at my fingertips for 42 years before drug-induced insomnia reduced everything to a picture of a picture in a blurry, pixilated, upside-down game of telephone.

What makes a drop become an ocean, expand a ray of light into a sunny sky, and grow a blade of grass into a field of barley? Life. Plain and simple.

That’s what soul mates show you, not just when it feels good but also when it hurts. She taught me that even if I'm no longer able to hold up to my end of the bargain as anguish and regret beat me down in a way I can’t shake, no matter how hard I try, no matter how strong I am inside. This year brought gravity on a superhuman level that smothered me and forced me to watch everything I ever wanted burn away, little by little, before my eyes, so soon after, it finally all arrived in my life. That is the kind of torture sociopaths do to ants, plucking away their arms one by one without killing them, to allow them to see their world fall apart as they languish paralyzed in pain.

Was it the sequence of street drugs, bad luck, doctor drugs, and bad doctors that combined to turn me into a legless ant? Or was it written in the stars to teach me a morbid lesson, like Abraham tasked to kill his only son? Was it the random cruelty of nature or a divine sociocpathic punishment that I lost it all just a few months after I finally had all I ever wanted.

Either way, the song remains the same.

The sixth letter is for I.

I belong.

“I belong to my beloved, and my beloved to me.” 

This is also the letter of the worst I. The narcissistic I who got caught staring at his reflection, who put himself first more than I want to remember. The I that Paul warned Timothy about in his letters from Rome. The I of selfish decisions, moments I hid, when I did what I wanted. The I of long trips alone, plane rides through the night to Alaska, Patagonia, Belize, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine, and the scenes of so many other adventurous cheating nights spent with faces and names I can no longer remember.

But I is not only the letter of confession.

It is also the letter of redemption, of cozy Interstate drives with a little hot water bottle on my lap as a copilot. Of so many trips together abroad, of Italian wine in the Tuscan sun over a river, or lying in Capri over a bay, imagining a magical future that was always waiting for us, but in the end, through this year’s u-turn, never came as imagined.

This is the letter of all I did and didn’t do. The times she said, "I’m proud of you," and I didn’t say it back, but I feel it now. I’m proud of you — far more than of myself.

I always knew I didn’t know best. No one does. So I’ve always liked making decisions with input from teams. Maybe it was being a middle child or a musical kid. Whatever the reason, I have an innate affinity for polyphony over solo voice in navigating complex questions.

But then, in July and again this December, when I was suffering beyond belief, grappling with the biggest decision of my life, I had to decide it all by myself. The paradox of suicidality is that you can’t bring anyone in with you to honestly talk through your suffering and the logic behind your escape plan because every social norm and legal protocol is designed to shut the thought down on arrival or lock you up for having it.

This broken system left a guy who never wanted to make a decision on his own to make the most irreversible choice of his life three times without any input despite being surrounded by well-intentioned people. That is my Zeno's paradox, the Achilles heel of my downward spiral since July, one that I hope society someday finds a better way to address.

This is the letter of forgiveness and humility.

It's being in the ICU when the dumbest and fattest sitter was the nicest and wisest in what she said to me. There I was in restraints with a tube streching my lungs in a terrifying state no one should ever have to experience. And in that moment, she taught me lessons. Who is Falstaff now? Who is the one being laughed at? Being mean is no way to be. I’m sorry. I can’t say I learned my lesson; it's more like the lesson learned me.

My lightning bug refused to see the ugly in me, only the good. She saw it in how I treated colleagues, partners, animals, trees, and the thousands of people I helped along the way, with kindness, and her approach to the world, too.

So I am the good, the bad, and the ugly. 

Ugliness is part of what surrounds me in this sterile hospital room tonight, track lines running down my arms, hands, and legs like a secret map of my subcutaneous highways, a stock photo on the wall of a misty river I can’t bear to look at for the nostalgia rivers bring, and an orange crayon in my hand to scribble these notes, feeling things that no words could ever capture, and no man should have to feel. 

You enter life with a light heart and an open mind. You leave it with a heavy heart and a mind filled with memories of past lives and what-ifs from another earth. In between, if you're lucky or unlucky, you learn to forgive and be forgiven. Learning what forgiveness means is the hardest thing because no one ever wants to hurt or acknowledge they hurt someone else. We’re always right in our own eyes. Only now can I see all the things I did wrong that need forgiving. And by writing this, I already know she forgives me. Because small gestures say big things. I could say more by writing less. That is her forgiving love.

The seventh letter is next. It's for why you can’t keep lightning bugs bottled up. Because the beauty and tragedy of life is that it's good times are here one day, gone the next. That is what every great parable since the dawn of time has tried to make sense of, from God punishing Job for no reason, to a spoiled Salome ordering the head of John The Baptist to be served on a plate for her amusement.

This letter is about moving forward through these kinds of tragedies. Knowing that basking in life's warm glow won't last forever, as I did for so long in my life, but also trying to somehow believe that freezing in its arctic cold, as I do now, is a season that may someday also change. This is why its the letter of not giving in, not letting go, not losing hope.

When the plague of the firstborn became the plague of the middleborn, and unending sleeplessness brought me to death’s doorstep, as I became the crazy one and her little Wellbutrin cap was a baby Asprin compared to the Halloween stash I had to take each night, when I finally I gave up, she didn't. 

She showed me what never giving up on me means. I wish I had that belief in myself.

She was by my side on the stroke floor after I hung myself, as arrogant doctors said I was in shock when I was experiencing something more dangerous, anoxic delirium. 

She was by my side at the trauma unit after I jumped headfirst down a six-story stairwell, as arrogant doctors said my cognitive impairments — losing my mind’s eye and splintering my vision — were delusions.

She was by my side when I woke up last week in the Revive and Resuscitate ICU from a three-day coma after ODing, intubated with a breathing machine down my throat, having swallowed a bottle of pills that arrogant doctors told me would make me feel better, but, like so many psych meds, did the opposite.

This heavy-handed approach of doctors masks their deep-seated insecurity about not understanding the human mind. They are like secret Soviet police fitting evidence to a flimsy theory pegged as their answer, without really knowing actually happened: “Show me the man, and I’ll show you the crime.” That is the science of psychiatrists.

But each of these scenes also shows her limitless grace. How she was by my side, nursing me back to life so long as she had breath, despite all I did to take mine away.

If you want to know the human mind, just ask 15 people to look out a window and tell you what they see. What you will hear is what in music we call, Theme and Variations. Because there is far more neurodivergence than convergence in how we interpret the world. This is why prescribing psych drugs is like asking a window washer on an airplane tarmac to course-correct a flight falling from 40,000 feet. Window washers work on planes, but they don’t know how to repair engines. When it comes to the engine of the human mind, no one on earth is qualified to make repairs. The motto of doctors is to do no harm. They would do less harm by not hiding behind fancy jargon and volatile pills, and instead being humble about what they don't know.

When I look out a window, I see 10,000 words that trace my life growing up, from the first sounds my mom taught me to the vocab I built during each sequential year at school, up to words like "intubated," that I only learned this week after it happened to me. This arsenal of language is how, glancing through a window, an almost infinite list of words fills my pallet.

When I look out a window, I see a mind that can pick out 20 people I’ve met from a sea of 1000 nearly identical faces at any one of the thousands of concerts I’ve been part of in my career.

When I look out a window, I see an endless love of learning, of all I invested in this mental universe. My whole life, I've been diligent at making deposits each year to grow, protect, and nourish this resource for the future. I did it because I love thinking. That is why this year is so unexpected and hard to accept, because I was the last person I ever imagined would have my mind wrenched away by a drug-induced virus. I've become the driving instructor crippled by a car crash.

That's why, now, when I look out a window, I see a mind not just a mind that gave me every opportunity for 42 years, but also one that closed all doors for me in my 43rd, as it went from regular to irregular, from my most renewable resource to my most costly liability, from my saving grace to my mortal danger, from my rock to my kryptonite, literally overnight. A mind can be the most beautiful, positive, transformative force in the universe or the most ugly, oppressive, and terrible one. As Whitman said, bright facing the sunshine, dark in its shadow.

When I look out a window, I see the old clear lens that allowed me to learn everything I did about the world and myself. “Know thyself,” the Oracle at Delphi said. But now I see the world through a bent lens, when that seems to give me very little that I can hold onto. As my mind changed, my soul seems to have vanished with it. It now feels futile to try to win anything back because my dreams, which were my fuel for 42 years, suddenly all feel gone. That is how one night robbed me of my present and future, leaving me on Christmas Eve to write about my past.

Never hand this universe of the mind to doctors who speak a language their own colleagues outside of psychiatry can’t understand. Jargon is the canary of ineptitude. Because more dangerous than a lost mind is one imprisoned by the ego of insecure guards who each add their own chemical fingerprint to a hubristic concoction like artists applying brushstrokes to a canvas passed from one hand to the next before the paint has even dried — palimpsests that never get clearer with time, only muddier. No brushwork ever helped me because for all my life until this year a blank canvas was all I needed. My default factory setting was the right one.

But my world went dark this year as heavy oil paint bled into me, obscuring everything from view. Eventually, only one light remained, shining through the caked-on layers of a clouded mind. It was this Lonestar that reached me as fireworks rained down from my room at the Retreat on the Fourth of July. It was this Lonestar I looked up to as I sat on a log, pleading with God to release me from the curse before cursing him. And it was this Lonestar I heard over the phone tonight as carols played in the background from a beeping hospital room on Christmas Eve.

That undying ember is why I am still here, despite everything. I haven’t yet known total darkness because she never let me, much as I tried to make it all go black.

And so, the last letter is everything.

Everything said and unsaid. Said but undone. Dreamed and believed. All we saw in each other — every moment of laughter and tears. The ones shed, and the ones still to come, which will eventually run dry before eternity sets in. 

This letter is for the memories that come back after the screams, sirens, beeps, calls, papers, and inquests have all faded. It’s the familiar purr of little good things. Of seeds planted that will grow forever, of the thousands of trees I put in the earth, endless privet hedges I laid beside the ocean, the ancient white oaks I uncovered to be nurtured in Royal Oak, the red oaks lining our driveway at Knights Bend, the most soothing entrance on earth, curving along the river of life, like the Return to Eden in Ecclesiastes.

This is the letter of every branch I painstakingly limbed by hand to create light for plants below or to open a view like Capability Brown, of the acres of grasses I cleared and manicured, the geometrically arranged apple orchard I planted wrapped by bluestone borders that now bear fruit, of river rapids built by hand across so many summers to glisten and sing in the afternoon sun and reflect the light of a Harvest moon rising in the northeast, at the head of a private sleepy hollow.

This is the letter of drystone walls laid, piece by piece, to a secret rhythm, granite stones I moved trip by trip from the quarry, as pieces of a giant earthen puzzle coming together, stone fugues organized in an homage to the genius of Bach brought to life in nature, in fieldstone fences patinated by the oxidation of time, covered by the gentle swirl Virginia creeper, cloaked in the sound of wind whispering down the gentle Tomifobia, the flood of light from boathouse doors swinging opening on Lac Mephremagog to let an afternoon spent waterskiing get underway.

This is the letter of wind gusts sweeping across the white-capped Choptank in winter, salt spray from a 20-mile fetch bringing relentless waves breaking over rocks, a navy Chesapeake swallowing the red winter setting sun when it sinks to its most southerly corner of the open ocean in December.

This is the letter of the last light vanishing into the horizon at a property I now call Last Light, the splash of little paws wading into brakish water from a pebble beach to fetch a stick I threw, a cold swim he’d rather not take, but does to show me, in his own way, what love means. In all the Jack London books I read about mighty wolves and unbreakable huskies, I never imagined a little beagle mutt would unlock the deepest key to my heart. Never was there a more endearing man’s best friend.

This is the letter for each of these moments and an infinite kaleidoscope of others across two countries, two rivers, three homes, three lives, four seasons, four paws, and millions of forgotten moments in between, the kind that only come back now in dreams. “There’s a sudden joy that’s like a fish, a moving light, I thought I saw it.” That’s how they all feel to me. And I see her in so many — the ones where I am standing tall, healthy, and strong, making speeches at an awards show or entertaining crowds in a cocktail as I did so many times in my sleep — and the ones that had me crawling this year on broken hands and knees, lost to myself and the world, the desperation of Paul Michaud’s black-ringed eyes slowly, relentlessly, turning into my own.

This is the letter for every time I should have said I love you and didn’t. For each memory, I took for granted while it was being made. For all we imagined walking on the pink sands of Harbour Island, rum punches in hand, gazing out into endless white bonefish flats, dreaming the dreams we dreamed before Mexican dice rolled a different fate for me one Friday night, breaking me to the point that on Christmas Eve, nearly one year later, I can’t remember what any of those dreams felt like. That is the saddest part of all — not losing the memories, but losing the feeling.

This is the letter of those moments hopefully returning someday, even if only in dreams, as an eternal summer, where the little guy is in the nook, somewhere between her legs and mine, on the sofa, on a night before January when I could still drift easily and soundly to sleep, passing out in the first minute of Rainday Antiques, as she watches Cobra Kai next to me, three peas in the pod, tree frogs singing outside, little friends peering in through glass windows with giant eyes as summer fireflies dart back and forth in the sky beyond.

“When the darkness enveloped and wrapped and cloaked me,” as it did for Bilbo’s companions in their journey through the soot of Mordor into the flames of Smaug, her ember kept me seeing up from down, forwards from backward. With no oxygen left in my world, she held a candle that never went out. It brought me back to life three times this year and kept me from falling over the edge more than anyone will ever know. But it’s not like her to take credit. She did it all silently, lovingly, with a light touch, a smile, and a laugh, because that's who she is at heart, and that's what this last letter is about. Because everything is not just what it meant for me, but also what it meant for her — which was for better and for worse, in sickness and in health, till death do us part.

This is the letter of good times, bad times, and most of all, the times I held that bottle in my hand.

Can you spell the secret word to unlock its buried treasure?

If you’re Indiana Jones, you can.

If you’re Bilbo Baggins, you can.

If you’re Moses, you can.

If you're me, you can.

Because no matter how far gone my mind may be, I will always be able to spell it. It’s imprinted on me. Forever.

But deciphering this burn-after-reading hieroglyph is like finding the lost ark, only to have the temple walls collapse around you. Uncovering the name of this eight-letter secret opens the lid on her jar of fireflies and sets all the lightning bugs free. Because you hold true goodness just long enough to feel its glow and know what that part of life means before turning those living embers back to the summer night so that white sheets can be turned down, bedside lights can be turned out, the air conditioning can be turned up, and an elf-hound can curl up at the foot of the bed, resting his head on an ankle, the stars shining down above in a world where all is still well.

I've dreamed of being back in that world every waking hour since January, just to feel it once more as the man I was before a chemical mind virus turned me into a ghost I don't recognize. Maybe I will feel that warmth once again when I am made whole in the next world, as scripture promises. But it's also written that I may be condemned to suffer for eternity in the next one, depending on how I leave.

Didn’t Jesus leave when the pain became unbearable? Wasn't he the one who pleaded, "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" Did he not cry out on the cross before the earth at Golgotha shook and his soul was lifted to heaven?

One February afternoon two years ago, I wandered alone through the Mount of Olives. with its shady groves and ancient monasteries. I sat for a long time in silence at its foot in the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus sat in agony, foreseeing his betrayal and crucifixion. But I could not foresee any part of life's betrayal and the unimaginable suffering waiting just around the corner for me eleven months later.

When it comes to scripture and banishment, I was condemned a year ago in Cabo with a crippling curse I’ll never understand. I tried every treatment to rid the affliction, but each step I took only made the suffocating pain worse and more overbearing.

I don't know what God does and doesn't forgive, but I know his Son understands suffering as my kindred spirit. I always heard it said but never felt it until now: I have a friend in Jesus. Given all I've been through, he will leave me a seat at his table of forgiveness no matter how I get there.

In the small hours of the morning, I sometimes wonder if I already died on one of those July days when the odds were stacked against my survival. It increasingly feels like I'm already wandering through fiery brimstone, forced to watch the things I love get ripped from me, one by one, like the legs of an ant writhing in pain. It’s morose to think this is hell on earth, but every time I try to say goodbye, I keep being sent back in worse condition than I was in before, like a repeating zugzwang. 

Does this world sound like heaven or hell? Like divine or devilish intervention?

Either way, as this broken year draws to a close, one solitary flame remains around me. Hers is the Olympic torch that withstood the whipping wind when all others burned out — forgetting, betraying me, giving up, fading away, retreating from a life made increasingly invisible by my never-ending search for Sméagol’s lost ring of sleep, worn down by the attrition of the hardest year I could ever imagine — in spite of which, or perhaps because of which, Bilbo's riddle is truer than ever in my heart: that without her, above her, below her, before her, and after her, all returns to darkness.

Because hers is the goodness of fireflies in summer, filled with the laughter of two brothers chasing flashes across the night sky. 

You can still find lightning bugs in that churchyard on Georgetown Pike, glowing embers in the darkness of July, dancing to the faint echos of little voices long gone but not forgotten, so long as we both shall live.
