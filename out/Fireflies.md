What is the secret word for all the goodness in the world?

You can find it if you know where to look, bottled into three sounds in a glass jar wrapped by a label with eight letters, like a spinning waltz in 3:8 time. 

Each letter holds a clue to the warm glow of summer lightning bugs inside.

But to experience gentle summer nights, you must first know the chill of spring and autumn. Because as Tolkien, who loved riddles, said, “What lies beyond stars and under hills, comes first and follows after” is darkness. 

As I write this in a dark hospital room, I have two books left by others who didn’t know me as company: The Hobbit and the Bible. Their words meander with mine.

She knew darkness, but not in the dramatic way of martyrs like Job or Jesus. Hers was in an understated Bilbo Baggins way that appreciates the little things. Because my vanquisher of sadness, my breaker of night, was not a grey wizard with a staff. It was a reluctant, unexpected, unassuming little dirty-blond girl, the hero of my journey there and back again, through Mirkwood, over the Misty Mountains, into the fiery cauldron of Mordor, and on to the Shire. Nobody loved a cozy Hobbit hole more than this hobbit of green pastures and her elf dog, Sparkly Wigglebutt.

But like a gentle Shire brook trickling over rocks that form ripples rising out of the water, this bubbly river otter knew her share of sadness. Like salt in a clear ocean, like steam rising from the deepest trench where it is said life began, like a drop of black yin in a sea of white yang, the goodness that came into my life one New York winter night had sadness already inside her, too.

She was the first person I knew to have taken antidepressants, and I called her the crazy one for it. No words were ever more misplaced because when a dark cloud of yin this year consumed all the yang that had accumulated in my luck-stricken life over 42 years, that little drop of sadness inside her was the source of unending understanding and acceptance as I lost my ring of sleep in Golum’s cave and collapsed over months searching for it under the increasing pressure of depression’s pull of gravity as each day passed without finding it.

So, what is this secret word for goodness that also understands sadness? The Ark of the Covenant housing summer’s golden embers rests not on four golden legs like the one Moses built, but on two, a living da Vinci code that needs Indiana Jones to crack, letter by letter. She met him once and always kept him in her password. So here’s my best effort to raid the Lost Ark, Harrison Jackson style.

What starts with caring, curious, cute, cuddly, compassionate, mainly composed, but sometimes not?

When a person lives in your memory and you in theirs, is there one face from a moment in time that stays? Was it the face when we were kids lost on the school bus to her house on Indian Lane? Was it in my 20s when a chance encounter in a bar led to a ruined Barbour jacket? Was it in my 30s when a little hand tapped my shoulder at a Lincoln Center wedding with Wynton Marsalis as its band? Was it the face beside me eating fish fingers in bed in Anguilla or nibbling home-cooked ramen in bed in Kalorama? Was it the one lying sideways on the sofa at P Street, M Street, or Pecks Point? Or was it a revolving memory, like a little warm nook, the sound of a suitcase dropped so many times on the floor at midnight, little paws running out, a sleepy voice in the background mumbling, “Hey,” before turning back over to sleep, my side already turned down for me to crawl right in.

The answer to all these questions is the second letter.

All of them. 

April. April first. April fools. One little joker appeared in a mixed litter of mutts on an island in the Chespeake that was the first place in Maryland to be settled, born of a stray mama, Naomi, who a mailman kept finding on his route in the remote hills of West Virginia, begging each day for food, a trait she’d soon pass on to the most talented beggar of all time, whose adorable eyes coaxed the mailman one day into bringing her home, and later giving her over to a rescue for adption, our little clown already growing fast inside her as the surprises of a lifetime, a surprise advertised as a Shepherd mix who was anything but, who had it in his blood to win over the hearts of every mailman, delivery person, and grounds worker he ever met all of whom ended up working for him, a perennial prankster who got the last laugh, tricking us into falling in love with him on first site as a two week old in a photo captioned “Peter Rabbit,” but who despite his bunny legs and Beatrixe Potter personality, was always for her, from the moment she first saw him, a different name, never once imagining he’d be part of our family some day, having told me long before her finger swiped over the adoption listing on City Dogs Rescue, that the only way I could get a dog was to put a ring on it. 

No words were ever taken more literally. I’ve always been fast at problem solving, like Saint Mark writing the shortest account of Jesus’ life, so it only took me 6 weeks to go through the secret adoption process, and show up, one Friday evening as the sun was setting on the steps of the Jefferson Memorial, a tiny puppy in my arms, who, long before she spotted him, caught the eye of a group of visiting school kids, swarming me in the dozens, maybe hundreds, all petting him as I proceeded towards her, like a Pied Piper arriving with his flock, my flute was a little beagle mut with a royal blue neck band and a small pendant bearing the freshly printed words “Hello, my name is Peanut Butter,” whose eyes she saw first, those two giant marbles that would become the source of all that connected us, our love of life's simple things, of animals, of coziness, so that it didn’t matter that she only saw the platinum diamond ring also attached to his collar second, because the most unbreakable ring was the living one in my hands, my eternal companion who took me to every forest path and river trail within the vicinity of all the places we’ve lived since then, not to mention every neighbors house to bring him home, and her nighttime companion during all of my long trips abroad, and more recently my never-ending hospital stays, a little surrogate keeping her warm.

Speaking of river trails, a river runs through the third letter like it does in the Garden of Eden, flanked on either side by the Tree of Life. It is said that this river brings the End of Night and the End of Curses, an eternal spring of life whose magic runs through Middle Earth, growing from a little trickle to an Enchanted River, from a quiet melody into a roaring symphony of the Moldau. This is the playful home of water creatures like river otters and river chipmunks.

At my childhood home on Georgetown Pike, there was not a river but a creek that ran through my life. I built dams in it every year, which, as I grew, got better and lasted longer before eventually washing away every Spring in floods, repetitive work that allowed me to develop simultaneously as an artist and an engineer in a way few pursuits offer a young boy, perhaps with writing music, which I also did. At that place called Cloisters, filled by the ever-present sound of little fingers on a Steinway, in the heat of summer, my younger brother Ben and I would descend into the churchyard in back of our house at dusk with two glass jars in hand, filling them with as many fireflies as we could catch. Lightning bugs are hard to catch because, like Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, you can never know their location and direction at the same time. By the time you run to the site of a flash, they have already flown somewhere else in the night sky.

Ben loved bugs like no one else. I would search the markets in New Delhi for Glow Worm toys to surprise him with on Christmas. In our churchyard back in Mclean, the one where Christmas Day football games always happened with me as the quarterback, where I learned to pitch a baseball into a strike zone drawn by hand onto a white shed with black ink from a mulberry tree, the same tree on whose low-hanging branches Lindsey Wheeler and I would spend so many nights as high school sweethearts, that was the place where Ben and I would fill glass jars with hundreds of lightening bugs brought back to our rooms as lanterns to keep us company overnight, the embers slowly disappearing as we dreamed. But futile as our efforts were to keep the glow overnight, Ben eventually connected me to one firefly whose ember never ran out — it didn’t matter how many nights.

For that reason, this is the letter of the Remembrance of Things Past, because her voice is my Madeleine, conjuring memories from that churchyard that foretold her and the millions of moments shared since then.  

But this is also the letter of regret, the kind of hair-pulling confusion and utter loss that leads to frantically moving giant rocks at midnight, blasting Nirvana on the stereo, singing Idioteque at full volume crying, avoiding myself and the world, Searching for Lost Time to escape everything that became broken as the result of one night, dreaming of being whole again, of chasing summers embers in the eternal winter that surrounds me now with no light on the horizon. It is this year's letter. One the world should never see.

The fourth letter is what was always right in front of me, because, of course, good things come in small packages. But it is also a letter of sadness since, of course, I discovered this truth too late. Of course means 20/20 hindsight with no foresight in a world of tears left drying, running, and still to come — so many that I am a river. “Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you if you can find my beloved; I am faint of heart.” But we never went to church, so we never heard these words until I read them in a cold hospital room.

Of course was also my intuition, my saving grace. It's what Arturo said allowed me to find ways not to hold close so many people around me with competing interests, engaging them to get the job I wanted done both despite and because of them. That is how ideas are brought to life, but I was never shrewd in business like others. Instead, I gave everyone the benefit of the doubt, in both sides of the negotiating table, and she does too in her own way with everyone she meets. That’s part of what connected us, and part of why she is adored by everyone who knows her. Because we all want to live in a world that sees our glass as half full like she does. She still sees me that way even after everything. My intuition about her was right. Never has one been more rewarded, perhaps undeservingly so. 

Intuition is what brought me to her when I saw her in my first year at Potomac so many grades below, and then again before my first work trip to Latin America in my 20s, and later, in my 30s, one afternoon in a light-filled orangerie in The Cotswolds, Song for the Moon soaring in the background, the only time I ever promised my life to someone. Never has generosity been more pure than hers in a way writing could never capture because life is lived, not written. I lived 42 charmed years, either lucky or unlucky. Lucky to experience so much, so many adventures, and so much good around me; unlucky to know and learn so little about what it means to suffer, about that hidden half of the human condition that every great book is an attempt to understand and decipher, from the first moment the apple was picked in Eden to the last cry on the Cross. But you can't be known this world by reading it, as I did for so many years. You only know it when that dark side of life comes to find you, as it did me this year. That’s how my hands and feet are nailed to a cross right in the form of needles. I am staring out, crying for my redeemer to come.

And then, like a prophecy fulfilled, a redeemers did come to tonight from the most unlikely place, and showed me what grace means. My redeemer is a former crack-head called Kyvonna with a lazy eye, a sworn Crypt and supposed cousin of Snoop Dogg, who returned to the hospital tonight on Christmas Eve, three hours after being discharged, to bring me my one present this year. She came back for me, my secret Santa. That is the kind of grace you can’t know until you're strung up on a post surrounded by others who are also bearing crosses of their own, a mute who has two remaining teeth but could checkmate me in a dozen moves on the chess board, a car crash survivor who graduated from one of the city's top private schools at 15 but now can’t finish a sentence, a card shark who has 12 inches of stitches holding his head and ear together having tried to kill himself after a botched eye surgery took away his vision, a catatonic 20-year-old Mexican who mumbles in a way that is impossible to understand, a Native American woman who sits in silence all day, and my roommate, a dreadlocked homeless man with COPD who coughs all night, all of them and me being looked after by two Roman guards, a stern charge nurse from Guyana, and a Francophone RN from Cameroon. Even the Christmas Truce of 1914 brought together a more likely bunch for yuletide than our lot tonight.

That is why intuition only takes you so far in life because its biggest lessons come from the places and times you could never imagine in your wildest dreams, or scariest nightmares, as the case has been for me these 12 months through my horrific, torturous, earth-shattering, eye-opening, all-encompassing 43rd year, one that has left me, barely breathing, sort of.

The fifth letter is not for any year but for better or worse, in sickness and health, words that never meant much to me until this year. Now I know what sickness means, and what for worse means. This is the letter of til death do us part.

It is also the letter of limitless. The letter of keeping the heavy light as she always did, the light whole, the full following, the flowing grounded. It’s the letter of everything in its right place. You create this balance by bringing two poles together like opposing magnets. That is what her force did for me, and hopefully, I did for her.

I wish doctors understood this. When you’re a hammer, everything’s a nail, and when you’re a doctor, every problem’s a pill. But just as mice share 85% of our DNA, in the medieval world of psych drugs, we’re all mice being thrown chemicals that no one understands. Of those who attempt suicide, most do so taking psych meds as prescribed, as was my case three times. The Columbine shooters were on antidepressant SSRIs. I know correlation doesn’t equal causation, but Clay Christiansen, who mentored my best friend, Wrede, said people don’t buy hammers to put nails in walls; they buy them to get a job done. Psychiatrists don’t understand what it means to get a job done. Instead, they hammer nails into trees without seeing the forest.

At college in Canada, there was a pale-skinned, dark-eyed boy who roamed the fringes of my experiences at Bishops. He was older than the rest of us because he never graduated despite getting perfect marks. Instead, he stayed enrolled by continuing to add new majors each year, so by the time I met Paul Michaud of Quebec City, he spoke eight languages learned through classes he kept retaking until he had them memorized. He knew the name and birthdate of everyone he met, including me, from my first encounter. You could find Paul waiting outside on the pub on any given night as the last call sounded, accompanying a group back to dorms in the snow over the Massawippi Arches, aurora borealis dancing in the early morning northern sky, only to be seen again a few hours later at the crack of dawn walking with the first school groups to classes, carrying the same solemn, drained, expressionless, look in his eyes, one he could never shake. 

What made Paul Michaud the omnipresent character of campus? Insomnia. “Dark shadows ring my eyes, yet my prayer is pure.” Paul’s eyes were dark but his heart was pure. I know this because I made friends with him in a way few others did, and came to understand the torture he suffered from not sleeping, a prison that never left him during the four years I was there. He was a sleepless student on the day I graduated, just like the one when I arrived, and may still be that same figure on campus to this day. During the time I knew him, I never once imagined the despair in his eyes foreshadowed my future, the face of the second and only other true insomniac I’ve ever met: me in my 43rd year. 

But this not is the letter of watching life go by, as Paul did, and as I’ve done this year too, missing out on so many things. Instead, it's the letter of living, of easy living, the life I had for 42 years before drug-induced insomnia turned everything upside down, and my world became a picture of a picture of a picture, blurry and distant.

Because what makes a drop become an ocean? What expands a ray of light into a sunny sky? What grows a blade of grass into a blowing field of barley? Living. That’s what soul mates do with you, not just when it feels good, also when it hurts. She taught me that, even if I'm no longer able to live up to side of the bargain, beaten down by unending psychic pain that I just can’t bear, no matter how hard I try and how strong I’ve been.

The sixth letter is for, I. I belong. “I belong to my beloved, and my beloved to me.” 

This is also the letter of the worst I too. The narcissist I who got caught staring at his reflection and put himself first more than I want to remember. The I of long trips alone, plane rides through the night, Alaska, Patagonia, Belize, Canada, and the Czech Republic, Ukraine, and so many other scenes of adventures. This is the letter of cheating with faces and names I've long since forgotten. If selfish decisions, moments I hid, and did what I wanted to do, not what was right.

This is also the letter of cozy Interstate drives with a little hot water bottle on my lap as a copilot. And countless trips together abroad, Italian wine, sitting in the Tuscan sun over the river, imagining an indefinite future that was always waiting for us but never came as imagined. Of all I did and didn’t do. All the times she said, "I’m proud of you," and I didn’t say it back, but I feel it right now. I’m proud of you — more than I am of myself.

I always knew I didn’t know best. No one does. Arturo taught me that. So, I learned to make decisions in teams. Maybe it was being a middle child, or maybe it was being a kid who sang in choirs. Whatever the reason, I've always had an affinity for harmonies over solo takes.

But then in July, and again this December, when I was suffering beyond belief, grappling with the most significant decision of my life, I was left to decide it by myself. That is the paradox of suicidal thoughts in our society — you can’t bring anyone to talk with about what unimaginable suffering feels like and the logic of your roadmap to escape it, because every social norm and medical protocol is designed not to listen but to shut the thought down on arrival, or lock you up for having it. So for a guy who never once wanted to make a solo decision, twice I’ve had to make the most significant, irreversible decisions of my life in July and again in December without any collaborative input despite being surrounded by every support that exists. For a guy who never took decisions alone, having to make this one in isolation is my Zeno's paradox. Someday I hope society finds a better way of resolving this conundrum in a way that doesn’t dismiss it.

This is the letter of forgiveness and humility since we're talking about decisions made alone, and mistakes.

It's why in the ICU this week was the dumbest and fattest sitter also the nicest and the wisest in what she said. There I was in restraints with tubes down my throat in a way no one should ever have to experience or be seen in. And she taught me a lesson. Tell me, who is Falstaff now? Who is the one being laughed at? Being mean is no way to be. I’m sorry. I can’t say I learned my lesson; more like the lesson learned me.

My lightning bug refused to see the ugly in me, only the good. She saw it in how I treated my colleagues, partners at work, fellows, animals, trees, and the thousands of people I helped along the way, with kindness, her approach to the world.

So I am the good, the bad, and the ugly. 

And now, ugly is all that surrounds me in this empty hospital room, track lines of running down my arms, hands, and legs like secret maps of my veins, a platform bed in the middle, a nurse to my back, and a photo on the wall of a misty river I can’t bring myself to look at for all the memories rivers bring back to me. It's just me alone in this room with a crayon to scribble these words, feeling things in my heart no words could ever capture. 

You enter life with a light heart and an open mind. You leave it with a heavy heart and a mind filled with memories of a past life and what-ifs from another earth. In between, if you're lucky or unlucky, you learn to forgive and to be forgiven. Learning what forgiveness means is the hardest thing to do because no one ever wants to hurt or wants to acknowledge they hurt someone. We’re always right in our own eyes. Only now can I see all the things I did wrong that need forgiving. And by writing this, I know she’s already forgiven me. Because small gestures say big things. I could say more by writing less. That is her forgiving love.

The seventh letter is about what comes next, moving forward. This is the letter for why you can’t keep lightning bugs bottled up because the tragedy and beauty of life is that it's here one day, then gone the next. That's also what every great book ever written is about. But while we're basking in life's warm glow, as I did for so long, or freezing in its arctic cold, as I am now, this letter is about moving ahead, not giving up, not giving in, not letting go, not losing hope. She showed me what all of that means in what she did to help me. She never gave up on me for a minute. Not once. I still haven't found the same conviction in myself.

When, like Job in the Bible, the plague of the firstborn became the plague of the middleborn, and unending broken sleep brought me to death’s doorstep, as I became the crazy one and her little Wellbutrin capsule felt like a tiny piece of candy compared to the Halloween stash of prescriptions I took each night to help me sleep, in those moments when I gave up, she didn't. 

She was by my side on the stroke floor after I hung myself, as arrogant doctors told me I was in shock when I was experiencing something far more dangerous: anoxic delirium. 

She was by my side on the psych floor after I jumped headfirst down a six-story flight of stairs, as a different group of arrogant doctors told me that the cognitive impairments I was experiencing — losing my mind’s eye and splintering my vision — were delusions. They are still here six months later.

She was by my side last week in a different hospital when I woke up in the ICU from a three-day coma after ODing, intubated with a tube down my throat, having taken too many pills other arrogant doctors told me would make me feel better, but, like so many psych meds I've tried, had the opposite effect. 

The heavy-handed approach doctors masks deep-seated insecurity, like the Soviet secret police fitting all evidence to a theory they already have in mind: “Show me the man, and I’ll show you the crime.” That is the quasi-brain science of psychiatrists. 

But each of these scenes also shows her limitless forgiveness and grace, always by my side, bringing me back to life as long as she had the breath and hands to do so.

If you want to know about the human mind, just ask 15 people to look out a window and tell you what they see. What you will hear is what in music is called, Theme and Variations. Because there is far more neurodivergence than convergence in how we interpret the world. This is why prescribing psych drugs is like asking a window washer on an airplane tarmac to course-correct a flight falling from 40,000 feet. Window washers may work on planes, but that doesn’t mean they understand engines, let alone how to repair them. When it comes to the engine of the human mind, no one does.

When I look out a window, I see the tapestry of my life unfold. I see a mind that can pick out the 20 people I’ve met in a crowd of 1000 nearly identical faces at any one of the thousands of concerts I’ve been part of in my career. I can see 10,000 words in a single view that trace my journey growing up, from the first sounds I learned from my mom, to the increasingly complicated vocabulary built through every grade of school and university, even up to new descriptors like "intubated" that I am still learning as I write — an infinite series of verbs, adjectives, nouns, adverbs, flora, fauna, and so many other things that just a single glance through a window can reveal.

Looking out the window, I see my love of learning, of investing in my mind as a precious object, as my universe. Among everyone I know, I was one of the most diligent at making deposits in my learning development across my entire life, protecting and nourishing for the future. That is why this year is so tragic and unexpected for me. Because I am the furthest from the person who would have a drug-fueled night introduce a virus that crashed my system in a way that no reset could fix or undo.

This is how the same mind that gave me opportunity for 42 years closed all opportunities in my 43rd year. How I watched my mind go from regular to irregular, from my renewable resource to my costly liability, from my saving grace to my mortal danger, from my rock to my kryptonite, nearly overnight starting in January. Because a mind can be the most beautiful, positive, transformative, ugly, oppressive, terrible force on earth all at once. As Whitman said, “Bright when we face the sunshine. Dark in its shadow.” It is the lens through which we learn everything about the world and ourselves. “Know thyself,” said the Oracle. When the lens is bent, as mine is now, we can’t say I.

No matter what, don't hand this universe over to doctors who speak in a language their colleagues outside of psychiatry can’t understand, let alone patients. Jargon is the canary of ineptitude. Because more dangerous than a derailed mind is one imprisoned by the ego of guards who each add their pharmacological fingerprint, like artists applying brushstrokes to a canvas passed from one hand to another before the paint has even dried, palimpsests that never get clearer with time, only muddier. The paint never helped me, because, for 42 years, a blank canvas was all I needed. My factory setting was the right one.

And this year, as my world went dark with so many brush strokes that obscured everything from view, eventually, only one light remained, the one I thought about as fireworks rained down from my solitary room at the Retreat on July 4, the one I looked up in the sky to as I sat on the log crying two days later, the one I heard over the phone as carols played in the background from my hospital room on Christmas Eve. That light, her light, is why I am still here, despite everything. I don’t know total darkness yet because she never let me. Her ember has always been flickering.

The last letter is everything.

Everything said. Unsaid. Said but undone. Everything dreamed and believed. All we saw in each other, every moment of laughter and tears. The ones shed, and the ones still to come, which will eventually run dry, before eternity sets in. 

It's the memories that come back to you when the cries, sirens, beeps, calls, and endless talking have all faded. The little things. The parts that will grow forever in the thousands of trees I planted, the privet hedges I laid beside the ocean, the ancient white oaks I nurtured in Royal Oak, the red oaks lining the driveway at Knights Bend, every cut limb done by my hand, the acres of grass I cleared and manicured, the apple trees, the river rapids I built, the beautiful rhythm drystone walls, patinated by oxidation and covered by swirls Virginia creeper, the sound of the wind whispering over the Choptank, the Tomifobia, the sound of pully-powered boathouse doors opening on Mephremagog, the spray of Chesapeake waves breaking on rocks from a northwest swell, the splash of little paws wading out from the beach to fetch a stick. 

This is the letter for each of these moments and everything else in between. “There’s a sudden joy, a fish, a moving light, I thought I saw it, rowing on the Lakes of Canada.” 

It’s the letter for each day I should have said I love you and didn’t. Each moment I took for granted. Of all we imagined walking on the pink sands of Harbour Island with a rum punch in hand, the dreams we dreamed before the dice rolled a different fate for me, starting last fall, then sealed by one night in January, breaking me to the point that I eventually gave up in July, and again in December, so that, here on Christmas Eve, I can’t remember what any of those dreams feels like now. But sweet memories will come back when the dust settles, I promise. 

This is the letter of those memories, of eternal spring, where the little guy is in the nook, somewhere between her legs and mine, on the sofa, or bouncing back and forth between our laps on a long ride. Where I’m sleeping soundly like I did before January, passing out in the first minute of Rainday Antiques, as she watches Cobra Kai next to me, three peas in the pod, summer fireflies peaking in through the window.

“When the darkness enveloped and wrapped and cloaked me,” as it did for Bilbo’s companions in their journey through the soot of Mordor and the flames of Smaug, her ember kept me seeing up from down, forwards from backward, even with no oxygen left in my world, she held a flame that never went out. It brought me back to life three times and kept me from falling over the edge more than she or anyone will ever know this year. But it’s not her to take credit. She did it all silently, resiliently, lovingly, with a light touch a smile, and a laugh, because that's who she is and that's what this letter, everything, always meant to her — for better and for worse, in sickness and in health, till death do us part. 

This is the letter of all the times I held that bottle of goodness in my hand. 

And now like Indiana Jones cracking the code and reaching the lost ark, only to have the temple walls collapse around him, this eight-lettered jar of fireflies has opened. The lightning bugs are flying free. Because you can only hold it briefly, long enough to feel the glow of true goodness and know what that means, before turning the embers back to the summer night, so that the Sparkly Wigglebutt can curl up in his nook, the lights can be turned out, and the stars can shine above in a world where all is well. I've dreamed of going back to that world every waking hour since January, to feel that secret goodness bottled up once more before I became broken.

Even now, her ember is the last glowing thing I have with certainty, already made partially invisible by the One Ring, worn down by the attrition of the hardest year of my life — but knowing, more than ever, without a shred of doubt, the truth of Bilbo's riddle — that before her, without her, and after her, all is darkness.

Hers is the vanishing goodness of fireflies on a summer night filled with the laughter of brothers chasing bugs. You can still find them in that churchyard, flashing in the darkness, dancing to the faint echo of two little voices long since gone.
