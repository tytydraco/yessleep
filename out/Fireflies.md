What is the secret word for all the goodness in the world?

You can find it if you know where to look in a churchyard near the Potomac River for a word bottled into three sounds inside a glass jar wrapped by a label with eight letters, like a spinning waltz in 3:8 time. 

Each letter holds a clue to the warm glow of summer lightning bugs housed inside.

But to experience gentle summer nights, you must first know the chill of spring and autumn. Because as Tolkien, who loved riddles, said, “What lies beyond stars and under hills, comes first and follows after” is darkness. 

I write these words in the darkness of a cold hospital room with two books left here by others who didn’t know me, now my only company on Christmas Eve: The Hobbit and the Bible. So their words meander with mine.

The glass bottle knew darkness too, but not in the dramatic way of martyrs like Job or Jesus. Hers was in an understated Bilbo Baggins way that appreciates the little things. Because my vanquisher of sadness, my breaker of night, was not a grey wizard with the Staff of Moses. Instead she was a unassuming little dirty-blond girl, reluctant and unexpected as heroes always are, the hero of my journey there and back again, through Mirkwood, over the Misty Mountains, into the fiery cauldron of Mordor, and on to the Shire. 

Nobody loved a cozy Hobbit hole more than this hobbit of green pastures, along with her elf dog, Sparkly Wigglebutt.

But like a gentle Shire brook trickling over rocks that form ripples rising out of the water, this bubbly river otter knew her share of sadness. There is salt even in a clear ocean, and steam rising from the coldest, deepest ocean trenches where it is said life began, so there was a drop of black yin in the sea of white yang that came into my life one New York winter night, in the form of goodness that had sadness inside her, too.

She was the first person I knew to have taken antidepressants, and I called her the crazy one for it. No words were ever more misplaced because when a dark cloud of yin this year consumed all the yang that had accumulated in my luck-stricken life over 42 years, that little drop of sadness inside her was the source of unending understanding and acceptance as I lost my ring of sleep in Golum’s cave and collapsed over months under the increasing pull of depression’s supercharged gravity as each day passed searching for its restorative power. 

So, what is this secret word for goodness that understands sadness? The Ark of the Covenant housing summer’s warm embers rests not on four golden legs like the one Moses built, but on two legs, a living da Vinci code that needs Indiana Jones to crack, letter by letter. She met him once and always kept him in her password. So here’s my best effort to raid the Lost Ark, Harrison Jackson style.

What starts with caring, curious, cute, cuddly, compassionate, mainly composed, but sometimes not?

When a person lives in your memory and you in theirs, is there one face from a moment in time that stays? Was it the face when we were kids on the school bus to Indian Lane? Was it in my 20s when a chance encounter led to a ruined Barbour jacket? Was it in my 30s when a little hand tapped my shoulder at my brother’s Lincoln Center wedding with Wynton Marsalis as the band? Was it the face beside me eating fish fingers in bed in Anguilla or the one nibbling home-cooked ramen in bed on Kalorama? Was it the face lying sideways on the sofa at P Street, M Street, or Pecks Point? Or was it a revolving memory, like a little warm nook, the sound of a suitcase dropped so many times on the floor at midnight, little paws running out, a sleepy voice in the background mumbling, “Hey,” before turning back over to sleep, my side already turned down for me to crawl right in.

The answer to all these questions is the second letter.

All of them. 

April. April first. April fools. One little joker appeared in a mixed litter of mutts on an island in the Chespeake that was the first place in Maryland to be settled, born of a stray mama, Naomi, who a mailman kept finding on his route in the remote hills of West Virginia, begging each day for food, a trait she’d soon pass on to the most talented beggar of all time, whose adorable eyes coaxed the mailman one day into bringing her home, and later giving her over for foster care, our little clown already growing fast inside her as the surprises of a lifetime, one advertised as a Shepherd mix who was anything but, who had it in his blood to win over the hearts of every mailman, delivery person, and grounds worker he ever met all of whom ended up working for him, a perennial prankster who got the last laugh, tricking us into falling in love with him on first site as a two week old in a photo captioned “Peter Rabbit,” but who despite his bunny legs and Beatrixe Potter personality, was always for her, from the moment she first saw him, a different name, never once imagining he’d be part of our family, having told me long before her finger swiped over the adoption listing on City Dogs Rescue, that the only way I could bring home a dog was to put a ring on it. 

No words were ever taken more literally. I’ve always been fast at problem solving, like Saint Mark writing the shortest account of Jesus’ life, so it only took me six weeks to go through the secret adoption process, and show up, one Friday evening as the sun was setting on the steps of the Jefferson Memorial, with a tiny puppy in my arms, who, before she spotted him, caught the eye of a group of visiting school kids, swarming me in the dozens, then hundreds, to pet the little fur ball as I proceeded towards her, like a Pied Piper arriving with his flock, my flute, a little beagle mut wearing a royal blue neck band bearing a small pendant with the freshly printed words “Hello, my name is Peanut Butter,” whose eyes she saw first, two giant marbles that would become the source of all that connected us, our love of life's simple things, so that it didn’t matter that she only saw later the platinum diamond ring attached to that same collar second, because the most unbreakable ring was the living one in my hands, my eternal companion, the one who took me to every forest path and river trail within two hours of all the places we’ve ever lived, not to mention every neighbor’s house to collect and bring my mischievous little runaway home, and her nighttime companion during all of my long trips abroad, and more recently through my never-ending hospital stays, my cozy surrogate to keep cold beds warm.

Speaking of river trails, a river runs through the third letter in the Garden of Eden, flanked on either side by the Tree of Life. It is said that this river brings the End of Night and the End of Curses, an eternal spring of life whose magic runs through Middle Earth, growing from a little trickle to an Enchanted River, from a quiet melody into a roaring symphony of the Moldau. This is the playful home of water creatures like river otters and river chipmunks.

At my childhood house on Georgetown Pike, there was not a river but a creek that ran through life. I built dams in it every year, which, as I grew, got better and lasted longer before eventually washing away each Spring in floods, repetitive work that allowed me to develop simultaneously as an artist and an engineer in a way few pursuits can offer a young boy, perhaps along with writing music, which I also did. At that place called Cloisters, filled by the ever-present sound of little fingers on a Steinway and ledgers on the wall of my height once a year as I grew, in the heat of summer, my younger brother Ben and I would run out into the churchyard in back of our house at dusk with two glass jars in hand, filling them with as many fireflies as we could find. Lightning bugs are hard to catch because, like Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, you can never know their location and direction at the same time. Because by the time you run to the site of a flash, they have already flown somewhere else in the night sky.

Ben loved bugs like no one else. I would search the markets of New Delhi for Glow Worm toys to surprise him on Christmas. In our churchyard back in Mclean, the one where Christmas Day football games happened with me as the quarterback, where I learned to pitch curveballs by throwing at a painted strike zone I drew by hand onto a white shed with black ink from a mulberry tree, the same tree on whose low-hanging branches Lindsey Wheeler and I would later spend so many nights as high school sweethearts, that was the place where Ben and I would fill glass jars with hundreds of lightening bugs, bringing them back to our rooms as lanterns to keep our rooms lit overnight, like flickering candles. But the ember always slowly disappearing as we dreamed. Futile as our efforts were to keep the glow overnight, Ben eventually connected me to one firefly whose ember never ran out no matter how many nights she was at my bedside.

That is why this is the letter of The Remembrance of Things Past, because her voice is my Madeleine, conjuring memories from a churchyard that foretold her and millions of moments shared since then.  

But this is also the letter of regret, the kind of hair-pulling loss and bewilderment that leads to frantically moving giant rocks at midnight, blasting Nirvana on the stereo, singing Idioteque at full volume crying, avoiding myself and the world, Searching for Lost Time to escape everything that became broken as the result of one night, dreaming of being whole again, chasing down any hint of summer’s embers through the eternal winter that surrounded and enveloped me this year with no light on the horizon to keep my bearing. This is the letter of my 43rd year. One the world should never see.

The fourth letter is what was always right in front of me, because, of course, good things come in small packages. But it’s also a letter of sadness since I discovered that truth too late, of course.  Of course means 20/20 hindsight with no foresight in a world of tears running, drying, and still to come — so many that I am now a river, the only river I never loved. “Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you if you can find my beloved; I am faint of heart.” But we’re not into church, so we never heard those words until I read them here in a cold hospital room.

Of course was my intuition, my saving grace. It's what Arturo said allowed me to find ways to hold close so many diverse people with competing interests, engaging all of them to get the job I wanted done, both despite and because of their differences. Arturo was my greatest teacher, he and Hilda helped me discover my own way for bringing ideas and then companies and strong business models to life. I owe more to them than to life itself. She showed me how be strong but not shrewd or greedy in business, like so many others who work tirelessly to build a company only to hand it defined my a close-fisted culture no one wants to be a part of. Instead, like Hilda, I gave everyone the benefit of the doubt, letting intuition guide me on both sides of the drawing board, the board room, the sales room, and the negotiating table. 

My firefly does this too in her own way with everyone she meets. That’s part of what connected us, and part of why she is adored by everyone who knows her. Because we all want to live in a world that sees the glass as half full like she does. She still sees me that way even after everything. My intuition about her was right. Never has one been more rewarded, perhaps undeservingly so.

Intuition is what brought me to her when I saw her in my first year at Potomac so many grades below, and then again the night before my first work trip to Latin America in my early 20s, and later, in my 30s, one afternoon in a light-filled orangerie in The Cotswolds, the only time I ever promised my life to someone. Never has generosity been more pure than hers in a way my words cannot capture because life is lived, not written. 

I lived 42 charmed years, either lucky or unlucky. Lucky to experience so much, so many adventures, such good around me; unlucky to know and learn so little about what it means to suffer, about that hidden half of the human condition that every great book is an attempt to understand, from the first moment the apple was picked in Eden to the last cry on the Cross. But you can't know that world by reading it, as I did for so many years. You can only know it when that darkness comes and rips your life apart, like one of the curses God sent to Egypt, sent to me in my 43rd year. That’s how my hands and feet are nailed to a cross right in the form of hospital needles, as I stare glassy-eyes into the void, crying out in my head for the redeemer to come take me away, to end the suffering.

Like a prophecy fulfilled, a redeemer did come tonight from the most unlikely place, not to carry me to salvation, but first show me what grace means. She appeared in the form a crack-head called Kyvonna with a lazy eye, a sworn Crypt and supposed cousin of Snoop Dogg, who returned to the hospital tonight on Christmas Eve, three hours after being discharged, to bring me my one and only present. She came back just for me, my secret Santa, bearing pretzels and Gatorade. That is the kind of grace you can’t know until you're strung up on a post, a crown of thorns poking your veins, your mouth parched and dry, surrounded on either side by other forgotten sufferers bearing their own crosses… a mute with two remaining teeth who could always checkmate me in a dozen moves on the chess board, a head-on car-crash survivor who graduated from one of the best school’s at 15 but now can’t finish a sentence, a card shark who has 12 inches of stitches holding his head and ears together having tried to end it all following a botched eye surgery that took away his vision without warning, a catatonic 20-year-old Mexican who mumbles incoherent phrases, a Native American woman who doesn’t even mumble but sits in silence all day with her ancestors, and my roommate, a dreadlocked homeless man with COPD who coughs all night — all of us looked after by two Roman guards charged by Pontus Pilot to hold us here, a Dutch-speaking nurse from Guyana, and a Francophone RN from Cameroon. Even the Christmas Truce of 1914 brought a more likely bunch together for yuletide than our lot tonight.

That is why intuition only takes you so far, because life’s biggest lessons come from the places and times you could never imagine in your wildest dreams, or scariest nightmares as the case has been for me through my torturous, earth-shattering, eye-opening, all-encompassing 43rd year of life, one that has barely left me breathing as it draws to an end, sort of.

The fifth letter is for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, words that never meant much until I learned what sickness means, and what worse means. This is the letter of til death do us part.

It’s also the letter of limitless. Of keeping the heavy light, as she always did, making the light whole, the full following, and the flowing grounded. It’s the letter of everything in its right place, which she managed, even when my world was spinning on its head. You create this balance by bringing two poles together like opposing magnets. That is what her force did for me, and hopefully, I did for her in my best moments.

I wish doctors understood this. But instead, when you’re a hammer, everything’s a nail, so when you’re a psychiatrist, every problem’s a pill. Just as mice share 85% of our DNA, in the medieval world of psych drugs, we’re all mice being thrown chemicals no one really understands. That’s why most people who attempt suicide do so taking psych meds as prescribed, as was my case three times. The Columbine shooters were on SSRIs. 

I know correlation doesn’t equal causation, but Clay Christiansen, who mentored my best friend, Wrede, famously said that people don’t buy hammers to put nails in walls; they buy them to get a job done. Psychiatrists don’t understand getting a job done means. They hammer nails into trees without seeing the forest.

At college in Canada, there was a pale-skinned, dark-eyed student who roamed the fringes of my experiences at Bishops. He was older than the rest of us because he never graduated despite getting perfect marks. Instead, he stayed enrolled by continuing to add new majors each year, so by the time I met Paul Michaud of Quebec City, he spoke eight languages learned through classes he kept retaking until he had them memorized. He knew the name and birthdate of everyone he ever met by heart, including me, from our first encounter. You could find Paul waiting outside on the pub on any given night as last call sounded, sober, silently accompanying some tipsy group back to dorms over the Massawippi Arches, the aurora borealis dancing in a northern sky, only to be seen again a few hours later at the crack of dawn walking with the first school groups to morning classes, holding the same solemn, drained, expressionless, look in his eyes, one he could never shake. 

What made Paul Michaud the omnipresent character of campus nights, mornings, and everything and everywhere in between? Insomnia. 

“Dark shadows ring my eyes, yet my prayer is pure.” Paul’s eyes were dark from never sleeping, but his heart was pure. I knew this because I made friends with him in a way few others did, and came to understand something of the silent torture he suffered from not sleeping, a prison that never released him during the four years I was there. He was a sleepless student on the day I graduated, just like the one when I arrived, and may still be that same figure on campus to this day. I can promise you no matter where he is, if he’s still alive, he will be able to tell you my birthday in an any language taught at Bishops. During the time I knew him, I never once imagined the despair in his eyes foreshadowed some part of my own future in the face of the second and only other true insomniac I’ve ever met: me in my 43rd year. 

But this not is the letter of watching life go by, as Paul did, and as I’ve done this year, missing out on so many things, so many heartbreaking chances, the biggest ones ever given to me, which came at the end of last year, the kind you wait and work 42 years for, hoping, like Field of Dreams, if you build it they will come. 

Instead, this is the letter of living, easy living, getting lucky, the life I had for 42 years before drug-induced insomnia made my world a picture of a picture of a picture — a blurry, distant, and upside down morose game of telephone.

Because what makes a drop become an ocean? What expands a ray of light into a sunny sky? What grows a blade of grass into a blowing field of barley? Living. Plain and simple.

That’s what soul mates do with you, not just when it feels good, also when it hurts. She taught me that, even if I'm no longer able to hold up to my end of the bargain, beaten down by relentless anguish and regret I can’t bear or shake, no matter how hard I try, no matter how strong I am deep down inside. This year took weight to a superhuman level, smothering me and drowning me, forcing me to watch everything I wanted and had disintegrate, little by little, before my eyes. That is the kind of inhumane torture sociopaths do to ants, picking off their arms one by one without killing them. Allowing them to fester.  Was it the sequence of illegal drugs, bad luck, legal drugs, and bad doctors that combined to make me that ant this year? Or was it written in the stars by a God who was forsaken me, like Abraham tasked to kill bus own son?

The sixth letter is for I. I belong. “I belong to my beloved, and my beloved to me.” 

This is also the letter of the worst I. The narcissist I who got caught staring at his reflection, who put himself first more than I want to remember. The I that Paul warned Timothy about in his letters, the I of long trips alone, plane rides through the night to Alaska, Patagonia, Belize, Canada, and the Czech Republic, Ukraine, and the scenes of so many other adventures. The cheating I who spent nights with so many faces and names on the road I can’t remember. The I of selfish decisions, moments I hid, when I did what I wanted to do, not what was right.

But this is not only the letter of shame in hindsight. 

This is also the letter of cozy Interstate drives with a little hot water bottle on my lap as a copilot. And countless trips together abroad, Italian wine, sitting in the Tuscan sun over the river, imagining an indefinite future that was always waiting for us but never came as we imagined. Of all I did and didn’t do. All the times she said, "I’m proud of you," and I didn’t say it back, but I feel it right now. I’m proud of you — more than I am of myself.

I always knew I didn’t know best. No one does. I’ve always made decisions in teams. Maybe it was being a middle child, or a musical kid. Whatever the reason, I've always had an affinity for polyphony over solo takes.

But then in July, and again this December, when I was suffering beyond belief, grappling with the most significant decision of my life, I was left to decide it by myself. That is the paradox of suicidality — you can’t bring anyone in with you to truly talk about what unimaginable suffering feels like and the logic of your roadmap for escape, because every social norm and medical protocol is designed not to listen but to shut the thought down on arrival, or lock you up for having it. So that left a crippled guy who never once wanted to make a decision alone in my life, left three times to make the most irreversible decisions of my life without any real input despite being surrounded by every well-intentioned support that exists. This is my Zeno's paradox, one that I hope society someday finds a better way to address

This is the letter of forgiveness and humility.

It's why in the ICU this week the dumbest and fattest sitter was also the nicest and the wisest in what she said to me. There I was in restraints with tubes down my throat in a way no one should ever have to experience or be seen in. And in that state she taught me a lesson. Tell me, who is Falstaff now? Who is the one being laughed at? Being mean is no way to be. I’m sorry. I can’t say I learned my lesson; more like the lesson learned me.

My lightning bug refused to see the ugly in me, only the good. She saw it in how I treated my colleagues, my partners at work, fellows, animals, trees, and the thousands of people I helped along the way, with kindness, her approach to the world too.

So I am the good, the bad, and the ugly. 

But right now ugliness is all that surrounds me in this hospital room, track lines running down my arms, hands, and legs like secret map to my subcutaneous highway of veins, a platform bed in the middle of this room, a nurse to my back, and a photo on the wall of a misty river I can’t bring myself to look at for the nostalgic memories rivers bring me now. So it’s just me alone in this room with an orange crayon to scribble these words, feeling things in my heart no words could ever capture. 

You enter life with a light heart and an open mind. You leave it with a heavy heart and a mind filled with memories of a past life and what-ifs from another earth. In between, if you're lucky or unlucky, you learn to forgive and to be forgiven. Learning what forgiveness means is the hardest thing because no one ever wants to hurt or wants to truly acknowledge they hurt someone. We’re always right in our own eyes. Only now can I see all the things I did wrong that need forgiving. And by writing this, I already know she will forgive me.  Because small gestures say big things. I could say more by writing less. That is her forgiving love.

The seventh letter is about what comes next, moving forward. This is the letter for why you can’t keep lightning bugs bottled up. Because the beauty and tragedy of life rolled into one is that everything’s here one day, gone the next. That's what every great book since the dawn of time is also about. 

So whether basking in life's warm glow, as I did for so long, or freezing in its arctic cold, as I am doing now, this letter is about moving ahead, not giving up, not giving in, not letting go, not losing hope. She showed me what all of that means. She never gave up on me for a minute. Not once. I still haven't found the same conviction in myself.

When, like Job in the Bible, the plague of the firstborn became the plague of the middleborn, and unending broken sleep brought me to death’s doorstep, as I became the crazy one and her little Wellbutrin cap felt like a tiny piece of candy compared to the Halloween stash I had to take each night for an hour or two of broken sleep, in those crushing moments when I gave up, she didn't. 

She was by my side on the stroke floor after I hung myself, as arrogant doctors told me I was in shock when I was experiencing something far more dangerous, anoxic delirium. 

She was by my side at the trauma unit after I jumped headfirst down a six-story flight of stairs, as different arrogant doctors told me the cognitive impairments I was experiencing — losing my mind’s eye and splintering my vision — were delusions.

She was by my side last week at a different hospital when I woke up in the ICU from a three-day coma after ODing, intubated with a tube down my throat, having taken too many pills that arrogant doctors assured me would make me feel better, but, like so many psych meds, had the opposite effect.

The heavy-handed approach of all these doctors masks deep-seated insecurity, like Soviet secret police fitting flimsy evidence to a theory they already pegged as their answer: “Show me the man, and I’ll show you the crime.” That is the quasi-brain science of psychiatrists. 

But each of these scenes also shows her limitless grace, always by my side, always bringing me back to life, for as long as she had the breath and hands to do so.

If you really want to know about the human mind, just ask 15 people to look out a window and tell you what they see. What you will hear is called in music, Theme and Variations. Because there is far more neurodivergence than convergence in how each of us interprets the world. This is why prescribing psych drugs is like asking a window washer on an airplane tarmac to course-correct a flight falling from 40,000 feet. Window washers may work on planes, but that doesn’t mean they understand engines, let alone how to repair them. When it comes to understanding and repairing the engine of the human mind, no one on earth knows how. It’s better to be humble than to hide behind jargon and random chemicals, neither of which anyone really has a clue about.

When I look out a window, I see the tapestry of my life. I see a mind that can pick out the 20 people I’ve met in a sea of 1000 nearly identical faces at any one of the thousands of concerts I’ve been part of in my career. 

When I look out a window I see 10,000 words in a single view that trace my journey growing up, from the first sounds my mom taught me to the increasingly complicated vocabulary I built through every year at school and university, even up to new descriptors like "intubated" a new word I learned this week after it was wrenched from my throat. Those 10,000 words represent an infinite arsenal of verbs, adjectives, nouns, adverbs, flora, fauna, and more that could all be adapted to things I see through a glance out of a window.

When I look out a window, I see my love of learning, of investing in my mind as my universe. Among everyone I know, I was among the most diligent at making steadfast deposits in my development across my life, protecting and nourishing my mind for the future. That is why this year is so unexpected and bitter for me, to have that future wrenched away by a virus that crashed my system in a way no reset could fix or undo from one, thoughtless, drug-fueled night.

When I look out a window I see the mind that gave me every opportunity I wanted for 42 years, and then closed all doors in my 43rd year as I watched it go from regular to irregular, from my most renewable resource to my most costly liability, from my saving grace to my mortal danger, from my rock to my kryptonite, nearly overnight. Because a mind can be the most beautiful, positive, transformative, ugly, oppressive, terrible force we have, all at once. As Whitman said, “Bright when we face the sunshine. Dark in its shadow.” 

When I look out a window I see the lens through which we learn everything about the world and ourselves. “Know thyself,” said the Oracle at Delphi. But when the lens of our mind gets bent, what can we know? I don’t know myself anymore. That is the worst pain because when the soul inside you has vanished, you can’t win anything back, you can’t live for anything, you can’t work for anything. That is what this year did to me. All those things disappeared, not just from my present, but also from my future. 

For that reason, never hand that precious universe over to the custody of doctors who speak a language even their own colleagues outside of psychiatry can’t understand, let alone patients. Jargon is the canary of ineptitude. Because more dangerous than a derailed mind is one imprisoned by the ego of insecure guards who each want to add their pharmacological fingerprint to it, like artists applying brushstrokes to a canvas passed from one hand to the next before the paint has even dried, palimpsests that never get clearer with time, only muddier. No brush strokes ever helped me anyhow because, for 42 years, a blank canvas was all I needed. My factory setting was the right one.

And this year, as my world went dark with so much heavy oil paint bleeding into me and obscuring everything from view, eventually, only one light remained, shining through the caked on layers clouding my mind. It was the lonestar that reached me as fireworks rained down from my solitary room at the Retreat on July 4. It was the light I looked up to in the sky as I sat on a log pleading with God to release me from the curse, before cursing him for cursing me. It was the ember I heard over the phone as bittersweet carols played in the background from my hospital room on Christmas Eve. 

That undying light, her ember, is why I am still here, despite everything. I haven’t yet know total darkness because she never let me, much as I tried make it all go black. Her ember was always flickering.

And so the last letter is everything.

Everything said and unsaid. Said but undone. Dreamed and believed. All we saw in each other, every moment of laughter and tears. The ones shed, and the ones still to come, which will eventually run dry, before eternity sets in. 

This letter is the collection of memories shared that come back after the screams, sirens, beeps, calls, papers, and endless inquests have all faded. It’s the familiar purr of little good things. The seeds planted that will grow forever in the thousands of trees I put in the earth, endless privet hedges I laid beside the ocean, the ancient white oaks I uncovered to be nurtured in Royal Oak, the red oaks lining our driveway at Knights Bend, the most soothing entrance to any property on earth curving along the river of life, like the Return to Eden in Ecclesiastes. 

This is the letter of every limb and branch I cut by hand to create light for plants below, or to open a view like Capability Brown, of the acres of grasses I cleared and manicured, the genetically arranged apple or bird I planted wrapped by bluestone borders that now bear fruit, of the river rapids I built by hand during so many summers in Canada to glisten and sing in the afternoon sun, and reflect the light of a Harvest moon rising in the  northeast, at the head of our private hollow. 

This is the letter of drystone walls laid, piece by piece, to a secret rhythm, stones I moved trip by trip from the quarry, like pieces of a giant earthen puzzle coming together, stone fugues organized like an homage to the genius of Bach brought to life in nature, in granite and fieldstone fences patinated by the oxidation of time, covered by the gentle swirl Virginia creeper, cloaked in the sound of wind whispering down the gentle Tomifobia, the sound of boathouse doors swinging opening on Lac Mephremagog to let a water ski outing begin.

This is the letter of guests sweeping across the white-capped Choptank in winter, salt spray from a 20 mile fetch across the Chesapeake bringing relentless waves breaking over rocks, a navy ocean swallowing the setting red winter sun when it sinks into its most southern corner in December, as I watch it out on a walk with my sidekick, the splash of little paws cautiously wading in from a pebble beach to fetch a stick I threw, cold water he’d rather not wade into but does it to show me, in his way, his loves. In all the Jack London books I read about mighty huskies and wolves. I never imagined a little beagle mutt would hold the key to my heart. Never was there a more endearing man’s best friend.

This is the letter for each of these moments that come to my mind across two countries, two rivers, three homes, three lives, four seasons, four paws, and a million memories in between. “There’s a sudden joy that’s like a fish, a moving light, I thought I saw it.” That’s how these moments feel to me looking back now. I see her in so many of them — the ones where I was standing tall, healthy, and proud, making speeches at an awards show, or entertaining crowds at cocktail — and the ones I hope no one ever remembers, when I was crawling on broken knees, lost to myself and to the world. 

This is the letter for each day I should have said I love you and didn’t. For each moment I took for granted. For all we imagined walking on the pink sands of Harbour Island, rum punches in hand, dreaming the dreams we dreamed before Mexican dice rolled a different fate for me, sealed by one Friday night in January that broke me to the point that I eventually gave up on life in July, and again in December, so that, here on Christmas Eve, I can’t remember what any of those old dreams still feels like. 

But sweet memories will come back in time when the dust settles, I promise. 

This is the letter of those memories, an eternal summer, where the little guy is in the nook, somewhere between her legs and mine, on the sofa, on a night before January when I could still drift soundly to sleep, passing out in the first minute of Rainday Antiques, as she watches Cobra Kai next to me, three peas in the pod, tree frogs peering in through the windows, summer fireflies beyond them darting back and forth in the sky.

“When the darkness enveloped and wrapped and cloaked me,” as it did for Bilbo’s companions in their journey through the soot of Mordor and the flames of Smaug, her ember kept me seeing up from down, forwards from backward. Even with no oxygen left in my world, she held a flame that never went out. It brought me back to life three times this year and kept me from falling over the edge more than anyone will ever know. But it’s not like her to take credit. She did it silently, lovingly, with a light touch, a smile, and a laugh, because that's who she is at heart and that's what this letter is about. It’s how the concept of everything always included for her — for better and for worse, in sickness and in health, till death do us part. I wish I was that strong still. But I’m weak and broken. She knows how hard I tried and will forgive me someday. 

This is the letter of hard times, good times, and most all, the times I held that bottle in my hand. 

So can you spell out the label now? If your Indiana Jones you can. 

But this is a burn after reading hieroglyphic, like Indiana Jones finding the lost ark, only to have the temple walls collapse around him. Uncovering the name of this eight-lettered jar of fireflies opens its lid and sets all the lightning bugs free. Because you only hold true goodness long enough to feel it’s glow and know what that part of life means, before turning those living embers back to the summer night, so that bedside lights can be turned out, the air conditioning turned up, old Sparkly Wigglebutt can curl up at the foot of the bed, and the stars above can shine in a world where all is still well. I've dreamed of going back to that world every waking hour since January, to feel the goodness bottled up one more time as who I was before I became broken. Maybe I will know it again in the afterlife.

But even now, at the end of this broken world, her ember is the last glowing thing I have with certainty in my life. All others have betrayed me or faded away, one by one, from view, retreating from a life already partially invisible through my exhausting search for the lost ring of sleep, worn down by the attrition of the hardest year in the life of anyone I’ve ever known — but in spite of which, the truth of Bilbo's riddle rings stronger now than ever in my mind and my heart — that before her, without her, and after her, all returns to darkness.

Because hers is the goodness of fireflies on a summer night filled with the laughter of two brothers chasing flashes across the sky. 

You can still find lightening bugs in that churchyard off Georgetown Pike, glowing in the darkness, dancing to the faint echos of two lvoices long since gone but never forgotten.
