What is the secret word for all the goodness in the world?

You can find it if you know where to look, bottled into three sounds in a glass jar wrapped by a label with eight letters, like a spinning waltz in 3:8 time. 

Each letter holds a clue to the warm glow of summer lightning bugs housed inside.

But to experience gentle summer nights, you must also know the chill of spring and autumn. Because as Tolkien, who loved riddles, said, “What lies beyond stars and under hills, comes first and follows after” is darkness. 

I write these words in the darkness of a cold hospital room with two books left here by others who didn’t know me, now my only company on Christmas Eve: The Hobbit and the Bible. So their words meander with mine.

The glass bottle knew darkness too, but not in the dramatic way of martyrs like Job or Jesus. Hers was in an understated Bilbo Baggins way that appreciates the little things. Because my vanquisher of sadness, my breaker of night, was not a grey wizard with the Staff of Moses. Instead she was a unassuming little dirty-blond girl, reluctant and unexpected as heroes always are, the hero of my journey there and back again, through Mirkwood, over the Misty Mountains, into the fiery cauldron of Mordor, and on to the Shire. 

Nobody loved a cozy Hobbit hole more than this hobbit of green pastures, along with her elf dog, Sparkly Wigglebutt.

But like a gentle Shire brook trickling over rocks that form ripples rising out of the water, this bubbly river otter knew her share of sadness. There is salt even in a clear ocean, and steam rising from the coldest, deepest ocean trenches where it is said life began, so there was a drop of black yin in the sea of white yang that came into my life one New York winter night, in the form of goodness that had sadness inside her, too.

She was the first person I knew to have taken antidepressants, and I called her the crazy one for it. No words were ever more misplaced because when a dark cloud of yin this year consumed all the yang that had accumulated in my luck-stricken life over 42 years, that little drop of sadness inside her was the source of unending understanding and acceptance as I lost my ring of sleep in Golum’s cave and collapsed over months under the increasing pull of depression’s supercharged gravity as each day passed searching for its restorative power. 

So, what is this secret word for goodness that also understands sadness? The Ark of the Covenant housing summer’s gembers rests not on four golden legs like the one Moses built, but on two legs, a living da Vinci code that needs Indiana Jones to crack, letter by letter. She met him once and always kept him in her password. So here’s my best effort to raid the Lost Ark, Harrison Jackson style.

What starts with caring, curious, cute, cuddly, compassionate, mainly composed, but sometimes not?

When a person lives in your memory and you in theirs, is there one face from a moment in time that stays? Was it the face when we were kids on the school bus to Indian Lane? Was it in my 20s when a chance encounter led to a ruined Barbour jacket? Was it in my 30s when a little hand tapped my shoulder at a Lincoln Center wedding with Wynton Marsalis as the band? Was it the face beside me eating fish fingers in bed in Anguilla or the one nibbling home-cooked ramen in bed in Kalorama? Was it the face lying sideways on the sofa at P Street, M Street, or Pecks Point? Or was it a revolving memory, like a little warm nook, the sound of a suitcase dropped so many times on the floor at midnight, little paws running out, a sleepy voice in the background mumbling, “Hey,” before turning back over to sleep, my side already turned down for me to crawl right in.

The answer to all these questions is the second letter.

All of them. 

April. April first. April fools. One little joker appeared in a mixed litter of mutts on an island in the Chespeake that was the first place in Maryland to be settled, born of a stray mama, Naomi, who a mailman kept finding on his route in the remote hills of West Virginia, begging each day for food, a trait she’d soon pass on to the most talented beggar of all time, whose adorable eyes coaxed the mailman one day into bringing her home, and later giving her over for foster care, our little clown already growing fast inside her as the surprises of a lifetime, one advertised as a Shepherd mix who was anything but, who had it in his blood to win over the hearts of every mailman, delivery person, and grounds worker he ever met all of whom ended up working for him, a perennial prankster who got the last laugh, tricking us into falling in love with him on first site as a two week old in a photo captioned “Peter Rabbit,” but who despite his bunny legs and Beatrixe Potter personality, was always for her, from the moment she first saw him, a different name, never once imagining he’d be part of our family, having told me long before her finger swiped over the adoption listing on City Dogs Rescue, that the only way I could bring home a dog was to put a ring on it. 

No words were ever taken more literally. I’ve always been fast at problem solving, like Saint Mark writing the shortest account of Jesus’ life, so it only took me 6 weeks to go through the secret adoption process, and show up, one Friday evening as the sun was setting on the steps of the Jefferson Memorial, with a tiny puppy in my arms, who, before she spotted him, caught the eye of a group of visiting school kids, swarming me in the dozens, maybe hundreds, to pet the little fur ball as I proceeded towards her, like a Pied Piper arriving with his flock, my flute, a little beagle mut with a royal blue neck band bearing a small pendant with the freshly printed words “Hello, my name is Peanut Butter,” whose eyes she saw first, those two giant marbles that would become the source of all that connected us, our love of life's simple things, of animals, so that it didn’t matter that she only saw later the platinum diamond ring attached to the same royal blue collar, because the most unbreakable ring was the living one in my hands, my eternal companion who took me to every forest path and river trail within two hours of all the places we’ve ever lived since then, not to mention every neighbor’s house to collect and bring our little runaway home, her nighttime companion during all of my long trips abroad, and more recently through my never-ending hospital stays, a cozy surrogate to keep her warm.

Speaking of river trails, a river runs through the third letter in the Garden of Eden, flanked on either side by the Tree of Life. It is said that this river brings the End of Night and the End of Curses, an eternal spring of life whose magic runs through Middle Earth, growing from a little trickle to an Enchanted River, from a quiet melody into a roaring symphony of the Moldau. This is the playful home of water creatures like river otters and river chipmunks.

At my childhood home on Georgetown Pike, there was not a river but a creek that ran through life. I built dams in it every year, which, as I grew, got better and lasted longer before eventually washing away each Spring in floods, repetitive work that allowed me to develop simultaneously as an artist and an engineer in a way few pursuits offer a young boy, perhaps along with writing music, which I also did. At that place called Cloisters, filled by the ever-present sound of little fingers on a Steinway, in the heat of summer, my younger brother Ben and I would descend into the churchyard in back of our house at dusk with two glass jars in hand, filling them with as many fireflies as we could catch. Lightning bugs are hard to catch because, like Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, you can never know their location and direction at the same time. So by the time you run to the site of a flash, they have already flown somewhere else in the night sky.

Ben loved bugs like no one else. I would search the markets of New Delhi for Glow Worm toys to surprise him on Christmas. In our churchyard back in Mclean, the one where Christmas Day football games always happened with me as the quarterback, where I learned to pitch a baseball into a strike zone I drew by hand onto a white shed with black ink from a mulberry tree, the same tree on whose low-hanging branches Lindsey Wheeler and I would spend so many nights as high school sweethearts, the place where Ben and I would fill glass jars with hundreds of lightening bugs brought back to our rooms as lanterns to keep us company overnight, the embers slowly disappearing as we dreamed. But futile as our efforts were to keep the glow overnight, Ben eventually connected me to one firefly whose ember never ran out no matter how many nights she was at my bedside.

For that reason, this is the letter of The Remembrance of Things Past, because her voice is my Madeleine, conjuring memories from that churchyard that foretold her and millions of moments shared since then.  

But this is also the letter of regret, the kind of hair-pulling confusion and utter loss that leads to frantically moving giant rocks at midnight, blasting Nirvana on the stereo, singing Idioteque at full volume crying, avoiding myself and the world, Searching for Lost Time to escape everything that became broken as the result of one night, dreaming of being whole again, chasing down any hint of summer’s embers through the eternal winter that has surrounded and enveloped me this year with no light on the horizon to keep my bearing. This is the letter of my 43rd year. One the world should never see.

The fourth letter is what was always right in front of me, because, of course, good things come in small packages. But it’s also a letter of sadness since I discovered that truth too late of course.  Of course means 20/20 hindsight with no foresight in a world of tears running, drying, and still to come — so many that I am a river. “Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you if you can find my beloved; I am faint of heart.” But we never went to church, so we never heard these words until I read them in a cold hospital room.

Of course was also my intuition, my saving grace. It's what Arturo said allowed me to find ways to hold close so many people with competing interests, engaging them all to get the job I wanted done, both despite and because of their differences. Arturo was my greatest teacher and he and Hilda helped me discover in my own way how to bring ideas and companies to life. My own way meant never being shrewd or greedy in business like so many others who build a company and a culture no one wants to be a part of. Instead, I gave everyone the benefit of the doubt, on both sides of the drawing board and the negotiating table. 

My firefly does too in her own way with everyone she meets. That’s part of what connected us, and part of why she is adored by everyone who knows her. Because we all want to live in a world that sees the glass as half full. She still sees me that way even after everything. My intuition about her was right. Never has one been more rewarded, perhaps undeservingly so. 

Intuition is what brought me to her when I saw her in my first year at Potomac so many grades below, and then again the night before my first work trip to Latin America in my early 20s, and later, in my 30s, one afternoon in a light-filled orangerie in The Cotswolds, the only time I ever promised a life to someone. Never has generosity been more pure than hers in a way my words cannot capture because life is lived, not written. 

I lived 42 charmed years, either lucky or unlucky. Lucky to experience so much, so many adventures, such good around me; unlucky to know and learn so little about what it means to suffer, about that hidden half of the human condition that every great book is an attempt to understand, from the first moment the apple was picked in Eden to the last cry on the Cross. But you can't know that world by reading it, as I did for so many years. You only know it when that dark side comes to rip your life apart, as it did me this year. That’s how my hands and feet are nailed to a cross right in the form of hospital needles, as I stare into the void, crying out in my head for the redeemer to take me away and end the suffering.

Like a prophecy fulfilled, a redeemer did come tonight from the most unlikely place to show me what grace means. She appeared in the form a crack-head called Kyvonna with a lazy eye, a sworn Crypt and supposed cousin of Snoop Dogg, who returned to the hospital tonight on Christmas Eve, three hours after being discharged, to bring me my one and only present this year. She came back just for me, my secret Santa. That is the kind of grace you can’t know until you're strung up on a post, a crown of thorns poking your veins, surrounded by other forgotten sufferers bearing crosses of their own — a mute with two remaining teeth who could checkmate me in a dozen moves on the chess board, a car crash survivor who graduated from one of the best school’s at 15 but now can’t finish a sentence, a card shark who has 12 inches of stitches holding his head together having tried to end it all following a botched eye surgery that took away his vision without warning, a catatonic 20-year-old Mexican who mumbles in a way that is impossible to understand, a Native American woman who sits in silence all day remembering her ancestors, and my roommate, a dreadlocked homeless man with COPD who coughs all night — all of us looked after by two Roman guards of Pontius Pilot, a charge nurse from Guyana, and a Francophone RN from Cameroon. Even the Christmas Truce of 1914 brought a more likely bunch together for yuletide than our lot tonight.

That is why intuition only takes you so far, because life’s biggest lessons come from the places and times you could never imagine in your wildest dreams, or scariest nightmares as the case has been for me these 12 months through my torturous, earth-shattering, eye-opening, all-encompassing 43rd year of life, one that has just barely left me beating, sort of.

The fifth letter is for better or for worse, in sickness and health, words that never meant much to me. But now I know what sickness means, and what worse means. This is the letter of til death do us part.

It’s also the letter of limitless. The letter of keeping the heavy light, as she always did, the light whole, the full following, the flowing grounded. It’s the letter of everything in its right place, which she always managed, even when my world was spinning on its head. You create this balance by bringing two poles together like opposing magnets. That is what her force did for me, and hopefully, I did for her in my best moments.

I wish doctors understood this. But instead, when you’re a hammer, everything’s a nail, and when you’re a psychiatrist, every problem’s a pill. Just as mice share 85% of our DNA, in the medieval world of psych drugs, we’re all mice being thrown chemicals that no one understands. Of those who attempt suicide, most do so taking psych meds as prescribed, as was my case three times. The Columbine shooters were on antidepressant SSRIs. 

I know correlation doesn’t equal causation, but Clay Christiansen, who mentored my best friend, Wrede, famously said that people don’t buy hammers to put nails in walls; they buy them to get a job done. Psychiatrists don’t understand getting a job done means. They hammer nails into trees without seeing the forest.

At college in Canada, there was a pale-skinned, dark-eyed student who roamed the fringes of my experiences at Bishops. He was older than the rest of us because he never graduated despite getting perfect marks. Instead, he stayed enrolled by continuing to add majors each year, so by the time I met Paul Michaud of Quebec City, he spoke eight languages learned through classes he kept retaking until he had them memorized. He knew the name and birthdate of everyone he met by heart, including me, from our first encounter. You could find Paul waiting outside on the pub on any given night as last call sounded, stone cold sober, silently accompanying some tipsy group back to dorms over the Massawippi Arches, aurora borealis dancing in the early morning northern sky, only to be seen again a few hours later at the crack of dawn walking with the first school groups to morning classes, holding the same solemn, drained, expressionless, look in his eyes, one he could never shake. 

What made Paul Michaud the omnipresent character of campus nights, mornings, and all times in between? Insomnia. 

“Dark shadows ring my eyes, yet my prayer is pure.” Paul’s eyes were dark from never sleeping, but his heart was pure. I knew this because I made friends with him in a way few others did, and in doing so, came to understand the torture he suffered from not sleeping, a prison that never left him during the four years I was there. He was a sleepless student on the day I graduated, just like the one when I arrived, and may still be that same figure on campus to this day, and he’ll still know my birthday in an any language taught there if you ask him. During the time I knew Paul, I never once imagined the despair in his eyes foreshadowed some part of my own future in the face of the second and only other true insomniac I’ve ever met: me in my 43rd year. 

But this not is the letter of watching life go by, as Paul did, and as I’ve done this year, missing out on so many things, so many heartbreaking chances, the biggest ones ever given to me, the kind you wait 42 years for. Instead, this is the letter of living, of easy living, of getting lucky, of the life I had for 42 years before drug-induced insomnia made my world a picture of a picture of a picture, blurry, distant, and upside down.

Because what makes a drop become an ocean? What expands a ray of light into a sunny sky? What grows a blade of grass into a blowing field of barley? Living. 

That’s what soul mates do with you, not just when it feels good, also when it hurts. She taught me that, even if I'm no longer able to hold up to my end of the bargain, beaten down by relentless anguish pain and regret that I just can’t bear or shake, no matter how hard I try, no matter how strong I’ve been my whole life. This year took weight to a superhuman level, smothering me, drowning me, forcing me to watch everything I wanted and had disintegrated little by little before my eyes. That is the kind of inhumane torture little sociopaths do to ants, picking off their arms one by one without killing them. Illegal drugs, bad luck, legal drugs, and bad doctors combined to make me that ant this year. 

The sixth letter is for I. I belong. “I belong to my beloved, and my beloved to me.” 

This is also the letter of the worst I. The narcissist I who got caught staring at his reflection and put himself first more than I want to remember. The I of long trips alone, plane rides through the night to Alaska, Patagonia, Belize, Canada, and the Czech Republic, Ukraine, and the scenes of so many other adventures. This is the letter of cheating with so many faces and names I've long since forgotten. Of selfish decisions, moments I hid, when I did what I wanted to do, not what was right.

This is also the letter of cozy Interstate drives with a little hot water bottle on my lap as a copilot. And countless trips together abroad, Italian wine, sitting in the Tuscan sun over the river, imagining an indefinite future that was always waiting for us but never came as we imagined. Of all I did and didn’t do. All the times she said, "I’m proud of you," and I didn’t say it back, but I feel it right now. I’m proud of you — more than I am of myself.

I always knew I didn’t know best. No one does. Arturo taught me that. So, I learned to make decisions in teams. Maybe it was being a middle child, or maybe it was being a musical kid. Whatever the reason, I've always had an affinity for harmonies over solo takes.

But then in July, and again this December, when I was suffering beyond belief, grappling with the most significant decision of my life, I was left to decide it by myself. That is the paradox of suicidality in our society — you can’t bring anyone in with you to truly talk about what unimaginable suffering feels like and the logic of your roadmap to escape it, because every social norm and medical protocol is designed not to listen but to shut the thought down on arrival, or lock you up for having it. So for a guy who never once wanted to make a solo decision in my life, three times I’ve had to make the most irreversible decisions of my life without any collaborative input despite being surrounded by every well-intentioned support that exists. For a guy who never took decisions alone, having to make these ones in isolation is my Zeno's paradox. Someday I hope society finds a better way.

This is the letter of forgiveness and humility.

It's why in the ICU this week the dumbest and fattest sitter was also the nicest and the wisest in what she said to me. There I was in restraints with tubes down my throat in a way no one should ever have to experience or be seen in. And in that state she taught me a lesson. Tell me, who is Falstaff now? Who is the one being laughed at? Being mean is no way to be. I’m sorry. I can’t say I learned my lesson; more like the lesson learned me.

My lightning bug refused to see the ugly in me, only the good. She saw it in how I treated my colleagues, partners at work, fellows, animals, trees, and the thousands of people I helped along the way, with kindness, her approach to the world.

So I am the good, the bad, and the ugly. 

Ugliness is all that surrounds me in this empty hospital room, track lines running down my arms, hands, and legs like secret map to the world of my veins, a platform bed in the middle, a nurse to my back, and a photo on the wall of a misty river I can’t bring myself to look at for all the nostalgic memories rivers bring back to me. It's just me alone in this room with a crayon to scribble these words, feeling things in my heart no words could ever capture. 

You enter life with a light heart and an open mind. You leave it with a heavy heart and a mind filled with memories of a past life and what-ifs from another earth. In between, if you're lucky or unlucky, you learn to forgive and to be forgiven. Learning what forgiveness means is the hardest thing to do because no one ever wants to hurt or wants to acknowledge they hurt someone. We’re always right in our own eyes. Only now can I see all the things I did wrong that need forgiving. And by writing this, I know she’s already forgiven me. Because small gestures say big things. I could say more by writing less. That is her forgiving love.

The seventh letter is about what comes next, moving forward. This is the letter for why you can’t keep lightning bugs bottled up. Because the tragedy and beauty of life is that it's here one day, gone the next. That's what every great book since the dawn of time is also about. 

And whether basking in life's warm glow, as I did for so long, or freezing in its arctic cold, as I am now, this letter is about moving ahead, not giving up, not giving in, not letting go, not losing hope. She showed me what all of that means. She never gave up on me for a minute. Not once. I still haven't found the same conviction in myself.

When, like Job in the Bible, the plague of the firstborn became the plague of the middleborn, and unending broken sleep brought me to death’s doorstep, as I became the crazy one and her little Wellbutrin cap felt like a tiny piece of candy compared to the Halloween stash I had to take each night to help me sleep, in those moments when I gave up, she didn't. 

She was by my side on the stroke floor after I hung myself, as arrogant doctors told me I was in shock when I was experiencing something far more dangerous: anoxic delirium. 

She was by my side at the trauma unit after I jumped headfirst down a six-story flight of stairs, as different arrogant doctors told me that the cognitive impairments I was experiencing — losing my mind’s eye and splintering my vision — were delusions.

She was by my side last week in a different hospital when I woke up in the ICU from a three-day coma after ODing, intubated with a tube down my throat, having taken too many pills that arrogant doctors also assured me would make me feel better, but, like so many psych meds, had the opposite effect.

The heavy-handed approach of all these doctors masks deep-seated insecurity, like Soviet secret police fitting flimsy evidence to a theory they already had pegged as the answer: “Show me the man, and I’ll show you the crime.” That is the quasi-brain science of psychiatrists. 

But each of these scenes also shows her limitless grace, always by my side, bringing me back to life as long as she had the breath and hands to do so.

If you want to know about the human mind, just ask 15 people to look out a window and tell you what they see. What you will hear is what in music is called, Theme and Variations. Because there is far more neurodivergence than convergence in how we interpret the world. This is why prescribing psych drugs is like asking a window washer on an airplane tarmac to course-correct a flight falling from 40,000 feet. Window washers may work on planes, but that doesn’t mean they understand engines, let alone how to repair them. When it comes to the engine of the human mind, no one does.

When I look out a window, I see the tapestry of my life. I see a mind that can pick out the 20 people I’ve met in a crowd from 1000 nearly identical faces at any one of the thousands of concerts I’ve been part of in my career. I see 10,000 words in a single view that trace my journey growing up, the first sounds I learned from my mom to the increasingly complicated vocabulary I built through every grade of school and university, even up to new descriptors like "intubated" I am still learning this week — an infinite arsenal of verbs, adjectives, nouns, adverbs, flora, fauna, and more that a single glance through a window reveal.

Looking out a window, I see my love of learning, of investing in my mind as my universe. Among everyone I know, I was among the most diligent at making deposits in my development across my life, always protecting and nourishing my mind for the future. That is why this year is so tragic and unexpected for me, to have that future replaced by a virus that crashed my system in a way no reset could fix or undo from one, thoughtless, drug-fueled night.

This is how the same mind that gave me every opportunity I wanted for 42 years closed all doors in my 43rd year as I watched it go from regular to irregular, from my most renewable resource to my most costly liability, from my saving grace to my mortal danger, from my rock to my kryptonite, nearly overnight. Because a mind can be the most beautiful, positive, transformative, ugly, oppressive, terrible force we have, all at once. As Whitman said, “Bright when we face the sunshine. Dark in its shadow.” It is the lens through which we learn everything about the world and ourselves. “Know thyself,” said the Oracle at Delphi. But when the lens gets bent, what can we know. I don’t know myself anymore. That is the worst pain because you can’t win anything back, you can’t live for anything, you can’t work for anything, when the soul inside you has vanished. That is what this year did to me.

For that reason, no matter what, don't hand any mental universe over to the custody of doctors who speak a language even their own colleagues outside of psychiatry can’t understand, let alone patients. Jargon is the canary of ineptitude. Because more dangerous than a derailed mind is one imprisoned by the ego of insecure guards who each want to add their pharmacological fingerprint to it, like artists applying brushstrokes to a canvas passed from one hand to the next before the paint has even dried, palimpsests that never get clearer with time, only muddier. No brush strokes ever helped me anyhow because, for 42 years, a blank canvas was all I needed. My factory setting was the right one.

And this year, as my world went dark with so much unfamiliar heavy oil paint obscuring everything from view, eventually, only one light remained, shining through the caked on layers clouding my mind, reaching me as fireworks rained down from my solitary room at the Retreat on July 4, the light I looked up to in the sky as I sat on a log pleading with God to release me from the curse, the light I heard over the phone as carols played in the background from my hospital room on Christmas Eve. That undying light, her light, is why I am still here, despite everything. I haven’t know total darkness yet because she never let me, much as I tried make it all go black. Her ember was always flickering.

And so the last letter is everything.

Everything said and unsaid. Said but undone. Dreamed and believed. All we saw in each other, every moment of laughter and tears. The ones shed, and the ones still to come, which will eventually run dry, before eternity sets in. 

This letter is that litter of memories that come back to you after the screams, sirens, beeps, calls, papers, and endless inquests have all faded. It’s the familiar purr of the little good things. And the seeds planted that will grow forever in the thousands of trees I put in the earth, endless privet hedges I laid beside the ocean on both sides, the ancient white oaks I uncovered to be nurtured in Royal Oak, the red oaks lining our driveway at Knights Bend, the most soothing entrance to any property on earth, like the Return to Eden in Ecclesiastes. This is the letter of limb I cut by hand to create light for plants below, or to open a view like Capability Brown, the acres of grasses I cleared and manicured and plotted, the apple trees wrapped by bluestone borders now bearing fruit, the river rapids I built by hand over so many summers to glisten and sing in the afternoon sun and under a rising Harvest moon. 

This letter is the secret rhythm of drystone walls I laid, piece by piece, trip after trip to the quarry, like pieces of a giant earthen puzzle coming together, stone fugues brought like an homage to the genius of Bach brought to life in nature, walls patinated by the oxidation of time, covered by the gentle swirl Virginia creeper, cloaked in the sound of the wind whispering down the gentle Tomifobia, the sound of boathouse doors swinging opening on Lac Mephremagog to let a water ski outing begin, or gusts ripping  over the mighty Choptank in winter, or the salt spray of Chesapeake from a 20 mile northwest fetch bringing relentless waves breaking over rocks, a black ocean with the red winter sun setting into its most southern corner, out on a walk with my sidekick, the splash of little paws cautiously wading in from a pebble beach to fetch a stick I threw, cold water he’d rather not get into but does it to show me, in his way, he loves me. Never was there a better man’s best friend. In all the Jack London books I read about huskies, I never imagined a little beagle mutt held the key to my heart.

This is the letter for each of these moments across two countries, two rivers, three homes, three lives, four seasons, four paws, and a million memories in between. “There’s a sudden joy that’s like a fish, a moving light, I thought I saw it.” That’s how the best moments feel to me looking back now, and I see her there in so many of them — the ones where I was standing tall, healthy, and proud, making speeches at an awards show, or entertaining crowds at cocktail — and the ones where I was crawling on broken knees, lost from myself and the world. 

This is the letter for each day I should have said I love you and didn’t. She always deserved it. For each moment I took for granted. Of all we imagined walking on the pink sands of Harbour Island, rum punches in hand, dreaming the dreams we dreamed before Mexican dice rolled a different fate for me, sealed by on January that broke me to the point that I eventually gave up in July, and again in December, so that, here on Christmas Eve, I can’t remember what any of those dreams still feels like now. 

But sweet memories will come back in time when the dust settles, I promise. 

This is the letter of those memories, an eternal summer, where the little guy is in the nook, somewhere between her legs and mine, on the sofa, on a night before January when I could still drift soundly to sleep, passing out in the first minute of Rainday Antiques, as she watches Cobra Kai next to me, three peas in the pod, tree frogs peering in through the windows, summer fireflies beyond them in the sky.

“When the darkness enveloped and wrapped and cloaked me,” as it did for Bilbo’s companions in their journey through the soot of Mordor and the flames of Smaug, her ember kept me seeing up from down, forwards from backward, even with no oxygen left in my world, she held a flame that never went out. It brought me back to life three times and kept me from falling over the edge this year more than anyone will ever know. But it’s not her to take credit. She did it silently, lovingly, with a light touch, a smile, and a laugh, because that's who she is at heart and that's what this letter is about — how everything truly meant for her for better and for worse, in sickness and in health, till death do us part. I wish I was also that strong still. But I’m weak and broken. And she knows how hard I tried. So she will forgive me someday. 

This is the letter of hard times, good times, and most all, the times I held that bottle in my hand. Can spell out the label? 

If so this is a burn after reading hieroglyphic. Like Indiana Jones cracking the code and finding the lost ark, only to have the temple walls collapse around him, uncovering this eight-lettered jar of fireflies has opened its lid and set all the lightning bugs free to fly. Because you only hold true goodness long enough to feel it’s glow and know what that means, before turning those living embers back to the summer night, so that bedside lights can be turned out, old Sparkly Wigglebutt can curl up at the foot of the bed, and the stars above can shine in a world where all is well. I've dreamed of going back to that world every waking hour since January, to feel that goodness bottled up one more time as who I was before I became broken. Maybe I will know it in the afterlife.

But even now, at the end of this broken world, her ember is the last glowing thing I have with certainty in my life, as all others have betrayed me or faded one by one from view, retreating from a life already partially invisible through my exhausting search for the lost ring of sleep, worn down by the attrition of the hardest year in the life of anyone I’ve ever known — in spite of which, the truth of Bilbo's riddle rings stronger than it ever in my mind and my heart — that before her, without her, and after her, all returns to darkness.

Because hers is the goodness of fireflies on a summer night filled with the laughter of brothers chasing flashes across the sky. 

You can still find lightening bugs in that churchyard off Georgetown Pike, glowing in the darkness, dancing to the faint echos of two little voices long since gone but never forgotten.
