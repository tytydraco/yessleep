I walked into class and found my desk. Class hadn’t started yet, so everyone was chatting, laughing about whatever was funny that day. We had two teachers—History for one hour, Literature for the next. Every classroom was the same: green chalkboard, a broken clock frozen at 12:00, and white brick walls. The halls had black-and-white checkered tile floors and blue lockers that nobody used. Room numbers were printed on plaques beside every door.

Right before class began, one of the teachers came over to me with a gift. She said it was for being such a hardworking student. It was a small blue iPod with simple buttons and a pair of decent black earbuds. The iPod had some preloaded tracks—video game sound effects and music. I could tell she thought it would remind me of the games I used to play. She meant well, but the games weren’t ones I played. Adults never really got tech.

In this world—our school—we all lived on campus. It was just high school, but things didn’t work like they do in the real world. Time didn’t move here. Only the teachers had working watches, and that’s how they kept track of when to take us to lunch or to the “nighttime level.”

Each hallway ended with a staircase. One led up to the nighttime level, where it was always night. The other led down to the lunchtime floor. After class, we’d go eat, then roam the lunch and class levels during free time. Below that was the main floor—the one with the school’s only exit. We could go outside, but not off campus. And below that? That’s where we weren’t allowed to go. Ever. The teachers reminded us daily: if you went down there, you wouldn’t come back.

At the end of every day, we went to the nighttime level. Always dark outside. Always. We’d get ready for bed and lie down in assigned dorms. Sleep came with a risk—something they called “infinite night paralysis.” Basically, if your body forgot how to wake up, you were gone. Couldn’t wake up without sunlight. That’s why whoever woke up first had to make sure everyone else got out of bed. If someone didn’t wake up… they were reported. Taken to a hospital. If they woke up again, they were barred from ever returning to the school. Too risky.

That was our life. Frozen time. Rigid schedule. Weekends with family, then right back in.

One day after class, my friend group came to me with a plan. They wanted to explore. More specifically, go *up*—past the nighttime level. The forbidden level. I said no at first. They kept pushing. Eventually I gave in.

That night, we met at the stairs. Not everyone showed up. But enough of us did. My best friend—the one who came up with this whole thing—took charge. Before we climbed, she gave one last out. A few bailed. The rest of us kept going.

We joked and laughed on the way up, passing landing after landing. White brick walls boxed us in on each side, with a glass wall behind us. One by one, people gave up. Got tired. Went back down. Eventually, only three of us were left: me, my best friend, and one other girl.

We reached a door. My best friend opened it.

The other girl backed out, said she wasn’t comfortable. That left me and my best friend. I stepped through the door.

It was daytime.

We had stepped into another school—same structure, but different colors. Brighter. Students welcomed us like they’d been expecting us. A teacher brought us to the principal’s office. Then… skip forward a month.

My best friend, once focused on exploring, was now obsessed with popularity. She had a new circle around her and wanted nothing to do with me. In fact, she turned on me. Started bullying me. Everyone followed her lead.

Insults. Pranks. Isolation. I sat alone at lunch. People avoided sitting near me in class. Eventually, the teachers moved my desk to the back. Even they stopped defending me.

One day, my friend broke something personal—something from my mom. I snapped. Screamed. After that, the whole school pretended I didn’t exist. Total silence. Like I was invisible.

I threw myself into schoolwork. It became the only thing I had. I didn’t matter. Nothing I did mattered. My life became routine. Just motions. I stopped thinking. On weekends, I’d sleep without waking, but I was always up for Monday.

My ex-friend ate lunch with her new group in a glass-walled lounge I could see from my classroom. The classroom had a wall of square windows that let me watch her from across the hallway. Same structure, different world.

Let me explain that.

The first school—my *real* school—was normal looking. White brick walls, blue lockers, tan doors. Classrooms with brown desks and cheap plastic chairs. Bulletin boards. Green chalkboards. Nothing fancy.

This new school looked nothing like it. Classrooms were arranged in a grid, separated by hallways. Each had one wall made of square glass panels surrounded by wood. Teachers could see where you went. Desks were minimal. No teacher desks. Just an office chair. Wood-paneled walls. No personality.

Worst of all: my mom wasn’t here.

She was still in the old world. Probably wondering where I was.

A year passed like that. One day, I went to the bathroom at night and saw my reflection. I’d forgotten my own face. That mirror jolted me out of whatever trance I was in.

I remembered my old school and decided to go back.

I made it down the stairs. Back to the old halls. But nobody recognized me. Not even my old friends. It was like I had never existed.

Eventually, I asked a teacher about my mom. They told me she had moved out of state after learning her daughter had died.

I didn’t just vanish from memory.

They all thought I was dead.
