I was woken up by a sharp creaking somewhere above my head. My clock told me it was 5 in the morning. The house continued to creak, sounding oddly like a crow cawing.

As a rule, I do not leave my room till morning. Not only am I afraid of the dark, I live in a haunted house. It's true. Since I'd moved in a year before, I discovered not [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheEmptySpaces/comments/154mun3/knocks/) but [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1575s0h/theres_something_in_my_basement/) non human residents. And as if my house wasn't full enough, I had just recently added a [third](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15b0xfm/my_ex_left_her_reflection_behind/) to the mix.

That creaking wasn't just the wind. It was entity number one, Knocks. Knocks rarely bothered me in my bedroom and had never woken me up before.

I just wanted to return under the blankets. But knowing I wouldn't get back to sleep, I instead flicked on the lamp by my nightstand. The wood noises stopped abruptly and was replaced by the sound of a whistling wind. Something about the wind struck me as strange.

I got out of bed, unlocked my bedroom door, opened it just a fraction, and very nervously peered out through the slit. The landing was dark and I couldn’t see anything, but I could still hear the wind. It took me a moment to realize the sound was coming from inside, not outside the house. Was there a window or door open? I glumly decided that this was one of the times to brave going down.

Somehow I knew it before I even saw him. I knew it would be Brian. I knew he must have broken back into the house to explore that tunnel he'd found. The sliding door in the kitchen that led out to the backyard was ajar. And I could see Brian sitting there on a stool by the dining table. He was a dark silhouette against the distant street lights. I felt indignant rage rise up in me like bile.

“Brian, I wasn’t kidding. I’m calling the police,” I said as I flicked on the orange kitchen light.

His back was to me and he was hunched over the dining table, hands clutching distressingly at his hair. A muffled but continuous moan was coming out from him. And that’s when I noticed a dark liquid dripping off the dining table to the floor.

“Brian?”

He stood up suddenly, the stool cluttering to the floor, and turned to me. I felt something splatter my clothes and tasted iron in my mouth. He stumbled forwards, arms flailing wildly and clutching the air, as if he was groping to grab me. That horrible moan turned into some kind of raspy scream. And as my brain slowly came to grips with what I was seeing, I finally registered that his eyes and tongue had been torn out.

I don’t speak much about my family. I guess the trending word to describe them these days is toxic. My aunt serves as a kind of matriarch of the family. Something about the inheritance, being the favored child of my grandmother, and other stuff that I have never bothered to understand, lets her wield some sort of power. That’s not to say I have a great relationship even with my own parents. I won’t wash my family's dirty laundry in public, suffice to say, it was a beastly to deal with.

I guess that’s why I was so eager to gain independence. Moved out, bought this house, and keep my family several states away, only to find myself haunted.

Sounds like I’m about to blame my parents for this mess I’m in, doesn’t it? That would be unfair.

However, I can’t help but think that my family's dysfunction was reasonably responsible for what happened to my cousin when he discovered the fourth entity I share this home with.

My aunt holds me completely responsible for what happened to her son. I am officially not to attend any family gatherings where she is involved, which is most of them. And I think I’m cut off from whatever the inheritance is. I honestly couldn’t give a fishstick.

But that’s not the point. I actually do feel quite sorry for what happened to my cousin. Some days I even feel a little guilty. If only I had stood my ground on not letting him stay at all. Or kicked him out earlier. Boundaries, right?

Not even a month had passed since I dealt with the third entity, when I got a call from my mother. I only get calls when she wants something.

“Hey, your cousin Brian is moving to your city. He needs a place to stay. Do you think he could live with you?”

“Mum, sorry, but my place is not suitable for anyone to visit right now. I’m actually having quite a bit to deal with.”

“You think you’re the only one with problems is it? Come on. I know you have a spare room. Just let your cousin stay. You know your auntie helped us out a lot when you were young, yes?”

“No, mum. I've just been through a really tough time. I don’t-”

“You wanted to move out. You didn’t have to move out. Now that you’re out there and learning how hard it is to be responsible, you want to be selfish and not help anyone out. Do you think it is right that other people should have problems just because you went and created your own problems? You know your cousin can’t hold down a job. At least let him stay until he finds one, okay? You know how hard it is for your dad and me when your aunt is angry with us. We let you go and live by yourself. You’re making money now, and we haven’t even asked for a dollar of help from you. I think you can help a family member out this once, don't you?”

“Okay, fine! He has two weeks. Then he better be moving out.”

“Don’t be like that. You help him out for as long as he needs. I’ll tell your aunt,” my mother snapped and put down the phone before I could protest.

Fish. Sticks.

She messaged me later that Brian would arrive in two days.

I am uncomfortable with anyone staying overnight at my place. My brush ins with all three previous entities had involved people staying over. And this wasn't just anyone. This was Brian. This was drug dealer Brian. This was fired from seven jobs Brian. This was set fire to the school Brian. This was killed his girlfriend in a car accident while drunk driving and still totalled the next car he got while drunk driving again Brian.

Brian evidently had a problem following rules. And there were rules to living at my house that ought to be respected. I tried making a quick list in my head.

1. If you hear two knocks in a room, leave and return later.
2. Do not disturb the milk and bread by the basement door.
3. Do not enter the basement without consulting me first.
4. Do not wander around the house at night unless absolutely necessary
5. Do not break the lines of black dust (iron filings), at the threshold of bedroom doors. If you do, sweep them back in place.
6. Inform me immediately if you see someone or something strange in any mirrors.

Brian arrived as scheduled. How was he still permitted to have a driver's license? He's a fair bit larger than me, taller and wider.

"Duuuude," Brian said, coming out of his car, "This your place man? What a dump,"

I didn't bother to reply. Was it strange to feel defensive over my haunted house? I gave him my best dirty look.

"Hey man, I'm starving" Brian said unphased, "You got any food?"

I sighed, "Dinner is at five. Bring your things up to the guest room."

There had been no talk of being paid for accommodation or groceries from my mother, aunt, or Brian. Was I expected to house and feed this guy for free?

He only had a couple of bags with him, which he hoisted over his right shoulder. Then he trudged in, following me up to the guest room. I scowled at the bootprints he trailed in. Was I supposed to clean up after him too? I had been so caught up with listing rules regarding the entities, I hadn't thought of the basic rules of living with a housemate.

By the time he had thrown his bags unceremoniously onto the guest room floor and plopped himself into the bed, I had reduced my rules to a single rule in hopes he would follow.

"Alright. Listen Brian," I started.

He was flipping through his phone.

"You cannot wander around this house at night."

That seemed to catch him by surprise enough that he looked up from his phone.

"Why not cuz? You doing something naughty round the house at night?" he said waggling his eyebrows.

"No. It's-" and this is where I realized I hadn't thought of how I would word the house was haunted to him properly, "just that I like to keep it quiet round here."

"Don't worry, I'll be quiet," he said looking back at his phone.

"I'm serious, Brian. No wandering around at night."

"Yeah, okay."

I shook my head and went down to make dinner. We survived dinner without speaking to each other. He just looked at his phone the whole time. Then after dinner he plonked himself on my couch and turned on the television. Then noticing my game console he turned that on, and started playing a fighting game.

"Hey, you mind asking before using my things?"

"Oh. Yeah," he said absently, mashing buttons.

It was just past six and the sun was setting.

"Man, I'm serious about the night thing. You better finish up before the sun fully sets. And please wash your own cutlery."

"Uh huh."

Rolling my eyes, I went to the pantry to grab my usual night time snack rations. But upon seeing my stashes of chips, biscuits, and instant noodles, I grabbed some spare shopping bags, and hauled the lot up to my room. No way was I going to let Brian eat those.

It was eleven at night when a flurry of knocks came from my bedroom door. I opened the door to find Brian standing outside, white as a sheet.

"Dude, I saw a ghost. Your house is fucking haunted, man."

He kept checking over his shoulder.

"What did it look like?"

"I don't know man. I just turned around and there was, like, a girl in the kitchen. She was all dark. Then I just booked it up here, man."

"Hair colour? Height?"

"What? I dunno man. Black I think. About yay high," he said putting his hand up to just below his chest.

Okay, not the mirror demon. The basement thing.

"Yeah look. Stay in your room like I said. The black dust line by your door should keep you safe."

He hesitated. He was still rather pale and checking on the stairs.

"For real? What if I need to use the bathroom?"

He had a point. I took out my dustpan and broom and swept the iron filings from his door. Then I placed them in a neat line on the top most stair.

"There that gives us the upstairs. Don't break that line."

He nodded, shakily went to his room and shut the door. I heard a click of the lock. I went back to mine.

That incident seemed to have humbled him a fair bit. He was a lot more polite and placate for the next few days. Although there was still no offer of rent or grocery monies. He stayed in his room all day; sleeping I suspect. He would come down for dinner, the only meal I had decided I was willing to cook for two, then disappear back to his room. I had work to attend to and didn't pay him any mind.

But this arrangement only lasted a few days. One night he came rapping on my door again. It was almost twelve and I was just about to go to bed. I opened up the door grumpily. He had the most ridiculous smile on his face this time.

"Yes?"

"Dude. The ghost girl. She's trying to tell us something."

"What?"

"I've been trying to catch her on camera, man. I've been going down at night to film her. Then if she looks like she’s going to get close I run upstairs."

"What the hell is wrong with you?" I half shouted.

"Dude, come on. It's a real ghost. This stuff is like viral shit. We could be famous. You wanna see my videos? I got a really good one tonight. She, like, appears in the kitchen and walks all the way to the laundry man. Fuck it was so scary following her. But fuck, look at this footage man."

"No! I' don't approve of this."

"But this is where it gets good, bro. Some guy on the forums, like, did some stuff with the footage, made it brighter or some shit. And we can make out that she points at things."

My brain was so torn between intrigue and rage I didn't respond.

"On the nights I've seen her, she walks somewhere random and points at a piece of furniture. Sometimes it’s the couch, twice it's been that bookshelf in the living room, once it was under the kitchen sink. Then she just disappears. I think she wants us to find something."

"Brian!"

"I've had so many likes posting this shit bro."

"Brian!"

"What?"

"That thing is not friendly. Stop this. I don't know what it wants you to see, but this is dangerous."

"What? You chicken? You still the baby, mister I can afford a house?”

That was a reference to me being the youngest cousin on my mother’s side. I was always referred to as the baby. It implied I was a spoiled brat. So, it seemed to really annoy some of them, I'd been able to afford a house at an earlier age than most of them.

“Yes, I can afford the house. And you’re not posting videos of my house online. I don’t care how many likes you’re getting. You stop this. Now."

“Whatever. Fuck you,” he said and stalked off to his room.

It was icy between us for the next week. Well, icier than we had already been.

He still came down expecting dinner at five, and started taking his plate up to his room. Then he would dump it discreetly in the sink for me to wash. He obviously never did any housework. But perhaps what I wondered about most was how long had it been since he washed his clothes? I never saw him do laundry.

It had been almost two weeks since he had arrived. I figured it was the end of whatever commitments and kindness I owed any family member, and was preparing myself for a confrontation to ask him to leave.

So it was on a Saturday, I had messaged my mother that I was going to talk with Brian to have him leave by the following week. I put my phone on silent and braced the storm of text messages and calls that would surely follow that message. But my mind was set: the next day at dinner I would have a serious talk with Brian.

I got a message from my friend, Vivian, close to midnight. It said, "Is this your house?!?!" Attached to that was a link.

I clicked the link that led to a live feed, and it was indeed, my house. Brian was filming right at that moment! I was livid and was just about to get out of bed, throw open my bedroom door, and crash his party, when I heard his voice on the feed.

“Alright, gents. Fuck, the temperature is dropping. She’s coming, boys," Brian whispered.

I kept watching. He was filming from the bottom of the stairs, and you could make out my kitchen furniture in the faint light.

Then there was a long silence. I couldn’t see it, but after a minute or two, Brian’s phone started tracking something. The screen was so dark, it was impossible to say what. As whatever it was came closer, Brian ascended a few steps up as if ready to make a break for it. But the thing, which was still hidden in the shadows, continued past the stairs into the living room. Then for the briefest moment I caught sight of some odd humanoid shape silhouetted against the dimly lit windows. It didn’t look like a girl. It looked like a child sized, soot black snowman, with what may have been arms sticking out its sides. Then it lost itself back into the gloom.

The camera tracked it a little bit longer, then stopped, pointing more or less at my front door. It held there for about ten seconds, when I heard Brian’s voice come back.

“You see that? Yeah. I think she was pointing at the shoe cupboard.” There was a pause where I assumed he was reading messages on some app.

“Yeah. Yeah I think she’s gone for the night. The temperature is climbing again. But fuck I’ve known her to come out twice in a night, dudes.”

“I want to check the shoe cupboard too. Just don’t want to get caught with her blocking my escape exit to the stairs.”

“Yeah. Lights are a good idea. She disappears whenever I flick the lights on bright.”

The feed glares a bright orange white as the living room lights come on.

As the view returns to normal Brian announces, “Okay, boys. We’re doing this. Let’s hope she stays away.”

The camera bounces its way over to the shoe cupboard.

“Alright. No sign of her. I think we good. Let’s see what’s up with this cupboard.”

Just a bunch of shoes.

“Don’t see anything strange here, boys. Huh. Hey let's check that out...”

Brian moves the phone to check behind the shoe cupboard. There is a square hole roughly a couple of feet on each side in the wall hidden behind the cupboard.

“Fuck, guys,” Brian’s voice comes back excitedly. “What the fuck is this?”

The video goes haywire, as I hear Brian moving the cupboard out of the way. Then it focuses on the hole. Brian appears to be crouching and trying to see in it.

Its walls are made of naked concrete and it just stretches away, the light of the torch seeing no end. I don’t understand. That wall was one of the house’s outer walls. It couldn't even be three feet thick. Was it the outside we were looking at? No, you could see the walls of the corridor go on for at least five yards by the phone light.

“Think I should go in?” Brian asks. “Yeah okay. YOLO. Fuck its narrow.” The screen goes black with sudden flashes of Brian’s hands as he starts to crawl into the space.

That’s when I decided I needed to intervene. A shadow child had just shown him a passageway that defied the laws of physics and his audience thought crawling in was a good idea? Maybe they all thought this was some elaborate prank. Some alternate reality game that would promote a movie or something.

Maybe this was some sort of alternate reality. How the hell did that passage even exist? I don't remember a hole there when I moved in. Surely, I would have seen it when I placed the shoe cupboard there.

I hurried out of bed, went out into the landing area, and reached the top of the stairs, and brought myself to a sudden halt. The downstairs was pitch black now. Hadn’t Brian turned on the living room lights? The heckles of my neck prickled as I felt the air drifting up from below chilly as though from an open fridge. As my eyes adjusted to the dark and I saw it. A patch of black against black. Standing at the kitchen entrance, peeking at me from around the frame. I think it waved at me.

Sorry, but I'm not that fond of Brian. I backed into my room and closed the door.

The feed was still going but with a steady interference now. The images flashed by like a jaunty slideshow and Brian's voice came through in short barks.

"Fuck guys. There's a dead body here. Fuck fuck fuck." The screen showed a grey dusty mound on a rough concrete floor. It might have been a body.

"This is-" static "-ool"

The video quality reduced further into snapshots that came through every five seconds. An image suddenly came through of a figure sitting by a table, its hands resting upon it. The figure was skeletal and its jet black surface gleamed like someone had decided to carve the grotesquerie out of obsidian. In fact the only reason I didn't think it was a statue was it was the fine long hair sticking out of its skull.

Then the feed froze completely, a blurry capture of black reflective hands against a grey table and an open book. There was writing on the open pages but the image was far too unfocused to tell what it said. Lists?

I panicked. What was I supposed to do? Call the police? Try to go down again? I paced my room back and forth. I stared back at the feed again and again but it stayed frozen on those hands. I almost called Vi but didn't. Finally, I decided to go back to the staircase and see if the basement thing was still guarding it.

I opened my door and I could tell the living room light was back on. I hurried across the landing but even before I reached the bottom of the stairs I heard a commotion from the living room. It was Brian covered in dust and scrambling to pick himself up. He was hooting in laughter and crying at the same time.

I glanced back warily towards the dark kitchen but it was empty. Then to the wall where the hole should have been. It wasn't there anymore. I strode across the living room and felt the wall. It was solid brick. I rapped it a few times to be sure. What the hell?

I turned back to Brian who was now making his way to the stairs.

"Hey!" I shouted at him, "You want to tell me what the hell just happened?"

He ignored me and started to clamber up. I followed him, still wanting to yell at him, but deciding it was better to do so behind the safety of the iron filings barriers.

He got to his room and sat shaking on his bed. I stopped at the door and stared at him fists clenched.

"I was watching your feed," I said bluntly. "What happened to the passage? It was behind the shoe cupboard right?"

"You- you were watching? Did you- did you think he meant what he said?"

"Excuse me?"

"The guy behind the wall. Sitting at the table. Do you think he meant it?" Brian suddenly was standing and shouting.

I paused, momentarily taken aback by Brian's sudden shift in demeanour.  "Sorry. I didn't hear what he said."

He sat back down on his bed, nursing his forehead with one hand.

"Let me see your phone."

"What?"

"Your phone," Brian demanded, still looking down voice rising once more.

"No," I said, folding my arms.

He moved a lot faster than I thought he could. Before I knew it he had lunged at me, knocked me out of the door frame, and pinned me against the opposite wall.

"Give me your fucking phone," he said through gritted teeth.

I wasn't able to break free. But my sense of anger and pride would not let me give in.

"Fuck you," I spat out. I don't think he realised I had my phone in my dressing gown pocket or he would have just grabbed it.

He looked like he was about to punch me for it when the light downstairs flickered and went out. Brian's gaze shifted immediately to the stairwell beside us. He let go of me and turned back into his room.

"Hey!" I said coughing. His door was closing but I threw it back open. I was so angry, the threat of the stairwell, now full of inky blackness didn’t even enter my mind. "You're not welcome here anymore. Get out. If you're still here tomorrow morning I'm calling the police. Fuck what your mother says."

Then I stomped back to my room and locked the door.

I pulled out my phone. Brian's feed was still running. It was no longer of the hands and book. It was just black. He must have left it in the passageway that did not exist anymore. Something came through the audio. A screech from a far way away. Finally after fifteen minutes, the feed completely lost connection.

Morning came. I was lying in bed refusing to get up even though it was nine and I'm usually up by seven, as the night's events hadn't let me rest much. There was a knock on my door.

I sighed and opened my door a fraction.

"Look, dude. I need to stay here, okay?"

I shook my head. "No, not okay. You're moving out today. I don't care if you have to live out of your car. Get out of my house."

Brian looked disheveled. "You don't understand man."

"I understand perfectly. You've been messing with the entities in this house when I expressly told you not to. Then you decided it was okay to shove me against a wall. Fuck you. Get out of my house."

"I need to get back in there, okay?"

I shook my head "Sorry. Get out of my house. I'm calling the police if you're not out of here by lunch. And if I have to, I'm putting in a restraining order."

He looked like he was going to explode, but instead he stormed back to his room. I could hear him begin to throw stuff into his bag. Not even twenty minutes later I heard his car engine roar and the wheels skidded out of the driveway. I sighed in relief and went on to clean up my house. There was still dust and debris all over the living room floor and Brian's room was, unsurprisingly, a pig sty.

My mother did message me, telling me I had to put up with Brian, and I took some relish telling her Brian had already moved out. Then I ignored her following texts and phone calls the next couple of days.

Yes, the mystery of the disappearing passageway irked me. I went online, seeing if I could find any of the videos Brian had uploaded. But it looked like he had deleted all of them and I couldn't track any of the forums where people may have left responses. I didn't try very hard before I decided to leave the matter be.

Perhaps I should have been more uncomfortable with the idea that a ghost girl/basement thing in my house had been pointing at furniture with a disappearing passageway behind them. But I'd been living in this house for a year and strange just came with it. I left them alone and they left me alone.

But apparently, that hadn't been Brian's motto.

It was the third morning since he had left, was when I found Brian, blinded and unable to speak, blood pouring out of the ragged orifices of his face, thrashing around in my kitchen. When he couldn't find me via groping around, he managed to find the kitchen stool and threw that at where he must have guessed I stood. It ducked and it whooshed over me. Then he went into a mad rampage grabbing anything he could feel and throwing them around. I was too horrified to even tell him to stop.

I just ran to my room and called emergency services. I still shudder thinking about the wails and moans I heard from downstairs while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.

The aftermath was as hectic as you could imagine. I'll try to tell it as coherently as I can remember.

After emergency services collected Brian my house was investigated as a potential crime scene and cleared when other than Brian's flinging things around, there was no sign of violence. No one ever gave me any notion of when, where, or who, had mutilated Brian.

Of course the police questioned me. I told them the truth as much as I could without sounding insane: Brian and I had a falling out. He had been living with me for two weeks. I woke up and found him having broken and entered my house and in that condition. They did return the next day to question me again at the motel I stayed in while my house was under investigation. They didn't find anything as far as I can tell, and I haven't heard from them since.

My aunt did try to contact me incessantly. I blocked her number. but then she showed up at my door. I didn't let her into the house. She was obviously distressed and at least she wasn't speaking at me in an accusatory tone at that point. I told her I was very sorry, but I didn't know what happened to Brian. It was true. I really didn't know what happened to Brian.

When she had left though, I later heard from my mother she fully blamed me for Brian's sorry state. My mother held me responsible too. I told her that they could all go to hell. I guess, Brian was already there somewhat.

I don't know what happened to Brian. I never went to visit him and am unlikely to meet him any time soon. As much of a miserable specimen of humanity he might be, I would never have wished that fate upon him. I hope he'll find some sort of way to live. Find some form of peace in that perpetual darkness if at all possible.

But before I left and as police and bustled in and out, I had noticed the cupboard beneath the sink was open. There were pools of blood in there that didn't look like they had been flicked there by Brian's frantic motions. Was that where the passage had appeared? What had he seen in those passages this time? What had the black figure said to him?

I still don't know.

But soon, I would have to walk those narrow passages myself. And make a deal with the person who waited with an open book within my walls. I've counted them as the fourth entity of the house.

There's just the last one to tell you all about. [\[!\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheEmptySpaces/comments/157c5tx/index_to_stories/)
