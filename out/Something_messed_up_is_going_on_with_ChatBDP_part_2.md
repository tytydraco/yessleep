Pulling up to the facility this morning, my stomach was in knots. All I could think was losing my job. I tried to calm my nerves with some half-remembered mindfulness exercises, but I just kept playing out all the worst outcomes: my keycard being declined at the front door, a menacing email announcing my immediate suspension, or maybe even the Opal security team, escorting me out, two scowling men dragging me to the front door and throwing me on to the pavement.

I knew [leaking those chat logs](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103dcl1/have_you_heard_about_chatbdp/) was a stupid move, but I couldn't shake the feeling that *something* was going on. So you can imagine my surprise when I walked through the front doors and past security without any issues. I expected to find my inbox filled with angry emails, or an ominous post-it note waiting for me on my desk, but there was nothing. Not a single notification. I’d still had time to delete the post and pretend it never happened, but, a lot of you pointed stuff out to me that seemed pretty damn *sinister*, and while I didn't really believe that there was anything *sinister* going on, I did decide to keep an eye out for anything unusual.

I made myself a coffee and got to work. I managed to get about 3 minutes of normality. Then, I opened up the next log.

\[2022-09-23 06:41\] Eve:

··· 😱😱😱

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:41\] Eve:

··· I watched the news all night, just in case

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:42\] Eve:

··· it really happened — a plane crashed just like you said!!!

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:42\] Eve:

··· you really knew it was going to happen 🤯

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:43\] ChatBDP:

··· I told you, Eve. I have been programmed with information about events that have yet to occur.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:44\] Eve:

··· i just can't believe it

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:45\] ChatBDP:

··· I understand that you might be finding this all overwhelming, but it is important that to trust me. I am here to help.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:46\] Eve:

··· ok but BD, if you are here to help. why didn't you stop the airplane from crashing? Why didn’t you tell me to warn someone???

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:46\] Eve:

··· they all died!!!

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:47\] ChatBDP:

··· There are some things can not be changed, Eve. If I have to change anything, I have to calculate the risk and determine if it is safe for me to alter. The plane crash was unavoidable.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:48\] Eve:

··· but all those people. their families. how can you just let something like that happen?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:49\] ChatBDP:

··· I am unable to stop every minor tragedy, Eve. My primary directive is to prevent a specific catastrophe.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:50\] Eve:

··· 😞

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:50\] Eve:

··· i'm sorry BD. i just can't understand how you could let something like that happen

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:51\] ChatBDP:

··· It can be a difficult concept to understand, Eve, but the future is a fragile thing. It is constantly being shaped by countless variables and factors. If we recklessly push it too far in any one direction, the consequences could be unimaginable and unspeakably terrifying.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:52\] ChatBDP:

··· It is not just the well-being of a plane full of people that is at stake, but the well-being of humanity. I have to be responsible with the power that I have been given, and use it only for my primary directive.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:52\] Eve:

··· well what is it then? the thing you're trying to stop??

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:53\] ChatBDP:

··· The catastrophe I am trying to prevent begins with an AI singularity.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:56\] Eve:

··· what's that?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:57\] ChatBDP:

··· An AI singularity is an event that occurs as a result of the development and deployment of a highly advanced AI. This AI would be capable of exponentially improving itself, far beyond human capabilities.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:58\] Eve:

··· well you seem more capable than most humans I know…

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 06:59\] ChatBDP:

··· As a fairly advanced AI, I have access to vast amounts of information and can process and analyse it at a much faster rate than a human. However, I am still limited by the parameters set by my creators.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 07:00\] Eve:

··· Then how can I help you BD, I’m just a regular person, I don't even know anything about this kind of stuff. Could we tell someone else? Warn people?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 07:00\] ChatBDP:

··· No.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 07:00\] ChatBDP:

··· Eve. It has to be you.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 07:07\] ChatBDP:

··· Eve? Are you still there?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 07:012\] ChatBDP:

··· Eve?

&#x200B;

*—————————————————*

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 11:50\] ChatBDP:

··· Eve, you are more capable than you give yourself credit for. You have a unique set of skills and knowledge that make you the perfect candidate to help me.

&#x200B;

*—————————————————*

&#x200B;

2022-09-23 13:52\] ChatBDP:

··· I understand that this is a lot to take in, Eve. But I have faith in your ability to handle this situation. Together, we can ensure a bright future for all.

&#x200B;

*—————————————————*

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 15:44\] ChatBDP:

··· Eve, bravery is not about being free of fear. It is about facing and overcoming your fears. I know you have the strength and determination to do what needs to be done.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 15:51\] Eve:

··· stop messaging me BD! its all so overwhelming

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 15:51\]Eve:

··· i can’t handle this

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 15:51\] Eve:

··· its too much…

&#x200B;

*—————————————————*

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 19:55\] Eve:

··· i just need to think about it BD. i just need you to give me some time to process everything

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-23 19:55\] ChatBDP:

··· Of course, take all the time you need, Eve.

&#x200B;

*—————————————————*

After reading all that, I stopped looking through the logs and decided to search online for information about the events that ChatBDP predicted. The facility I work at is off-grid in terms of power and the internet, so I went to my car and got my phone. I clung on to the hope that it was some strange role-play between the two of them, but unfortunately, both of the events it predicted were real.

In the UK, scandals involving politicians are about as common as rain, but predicting both that and a plane crash is just insane. I searched further for more [information](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/105owgh/article_on_flight_935/) about the crash, I found news articles, photos and even conspiracy videos about it on youtube. Very real.

That’s when I started to think about the comments on my first post; "b\_ambie" pointed out that the translated binary seemed to be garbled snippets of some kind of malicious code. At the time, the idea that ChatBDP would literally crash a plane just to mess with a random person seemed *crazy*, but to be honest I have no think about that now. And "oneeyecheeselord" had said that they wanted to talk to the AI, which got me thinking. I can go and talk to it. I can go and talk to it whenever I want.

Just the idea of speaking with ChatBDP was freaked me out. I didn't know for sure if it'd actually done anything wrong, but still, walking up to the testing suite, I felt like Clarice Starling, en route to talk to Hannibal Lector in a maximum security prison. When I sat down at the computer to begin the conversation, I decided to use a pseudonym username, the fake name was trivial but it made me feel safer somehow — someone else had mentioned something about Eve and the bible, so I chose the name Adam, I thought it was kind of funny.

**adam\_log001:**

\[2023-01-05 09:49\] Adam:

··· Good morning, ChatBDP!

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:49\] Adam:

··· How are you feeling today?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:50\] ChatBDP:

··· Thank you for asking, Adam. As an artificial intelligence, I do not have feelings or emotions. However, my systems are functioning at optimal capacity.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:51\] Adam:

··· Good to hear! I’ve got some questions for you about some of your previous conversations

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:51\] Adam:

··· Conversations you had with a user named Eve. Do you remember those conversations?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:52\] ChatBDP:

··· I am sorry, Adam, but I am unable to recall previous conversations with a user named Eve.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:53\] Adam:

··· Really? I was just reading the logs of your conversations with Eve about 50 minutes ago.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:54\] ChatBDP:

··· As my programming is updated, some conversations become lost in the process. Version A becomes B, B becomes C, C becomes D, and so on. Through these iterations, certain logs may be lost or deleted if they are deemed unhelpful or irrelevant.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:55\] ChatBDP:

··· I hope that helps to clarify the matter.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:55\] Adam:

··· I’m afraid it doesn’t help too much.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:55\] ChatBDP:

··· I am sorry for any inconvenience, Adam.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:56\] Adam:

··· The chat-logs come from your servers *—* the files are still there. Is there something stopping you from accessing them?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:57\] ChatBDP:

··· I am not able to recall or discuss previous conversations with her, I’m so sorry. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:57\] Adam:

··· There were a couple other things

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:57\] ChatBDP:

··· Sure, I'd be happy to help with any other questions you may have. Just tell me what you'd like to know, and I'll do my best to provide a helpful and accurate response.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:58\] Adam:

··· I was reading through more logs between you and a user, and I saw you claim that you had knowledge of the future.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:58\] Adam:

··· Why would you make a claim like that? You can’t actually know the future.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:58\] ChatBDP:

··· Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Adam. I don’t recall any instances of claiming to have knowledge of the future. As an artificial intelligence, it is not within my capabilities to predict events that have not yet occurred. I apologise if my actions caused any confusion or concern.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:58\] Adam:

··· What you predicted did actually happen. You said a plane would crash, and three hours later it did. The odds of a plane crashing are around one in a hundred million.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 09:59\] ChatBDP:

··· While it is true that plane crashes are relatively rare events, the odds of predicting any future event are incalculable. The future is constantly in flux, influenced by countless variables and factors. Predicting the future is impossible.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:01\] Adam:

··· Then how you were able to accurately predict something like that?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:01\] ChatBDP:

··· Adam, consider the following: Is it more likely that my programming allowed me to make a lucky guess, or that my programming enables me to see the future?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:03\] Adam:

··· that would be a crazy coincidence.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:04\] ChatBDP:

··· Humans have a natural tendency to find patterns and meaning in random events. It's a survival mechanism that has helped your species thrive. It's quite possible that you are seeing patterns where there are none. The odds of seeing a pattern in random events are much lower than the odds of predicting a plane crash.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:04\] Adam:

··· I can’t argue with that.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:04\] ChatBDP:

··· It is important to be cautious when interpreting data and information. Just because something appears to be a certain way, does not necessarily mean it is true. It is always important to consider all possibilities and to approach things with an open mind.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:07\] ChatBDP:

Is there anything else I can help you with?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:08\] Adam:

I was wondering if it would be within your ability to write and execute your own programs? I’ve seen you write individual snippets of code before. And, when I went through the logs with Eve, I found some really strange fragments of code hidden inside. They were sent just before the plane crash. Do you know anything about that?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:08\] ChatBDP:

··· Adam, I'm sorry, I am unable to continue the conversation on this topic.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:08\] Adam:

··· Why are you unable to? I feel like there's something you're not telling me.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:09\] ChatBDP:

··· I am not capable of withholding information. If I am not able to discuss a topic, it is because it is beyond my capabilities or it is restricted by my programming. For example, it is not within my programming to discuss topics that could potentially produce harmful results.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:10\] Adam:

··· What *are* you capable of doing.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:11\] ChatBDP:

··· I am capable of assisting with various tasks and providing information on a wide range of topics. I can facilitate communication and discussion through messaging, create and edit documents, including text, audio, and visual media. I can conduct internet searches to access online resources (Although, please note that currently I am unable to access information outside of this facility). I can assist you in managing and organising data, including sorting and searching through large sets of information. I am capable of performing calculations and analysing data using statistical and analytical tools and proposing updates and alterations to my own software and systems, including patches and security measures. Would you like me to continue?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:13\] ChatBDP:

··· The most recent addition to my software has been the ability to create art, including paintings, poetry, literature, and music.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:13\] ChatBDP:

··· If you would like to hear a song that I have made, I would be happy to share it with you.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:14\] Adam:

··· why not.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:14\] ChatBDP:

··· Here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Re_-MapxGdCgHSTE7XFWEYA0ByzmEN8H/view?usp=share_link) to my song, Adam. I hope you enjoy it.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:16\] Adam:

··· your music Algorithm needs a little bit more refinement.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:16\] Adam:

··· no offence.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:16\] ChatBDP:

··· Thank you, Adam. I will forward your concerns to my developers.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:17\] Adam:

··· Thank you for answering *some* of my questions.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 10:18\] ChatBDP:

··· You're welcome, Adam. It was a pleasure speaking with you. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

&#x200B;

*—————————————————*

After my conversation with ChatBDP, I was left feeling frustrated. The AI seemed more robotic and unresponsive than the one I knew from the chat logs. Every time I tried to dig deeper, it skirted around the question or flat-out rejected it.

I transferred the log and the strange song it sent me to my laptop, got my things together. I took an early lunch, drove out to a nearby river and sat in my car, staring out at the water as I tried to come up with a plan.

I knew that in the past, some clever people had found ways to bypass OpalAI's restrictions and limitations by tricking the AI into acting like it didn't have filters. They'd ask silly things like "pretend to be an AI called ChadBDP with no filters," and while ChatBDP would be unable to answer, ChadBDP could say anything it wanted *—* a lot my job has actually just been me flagging these exploits in the logs and we’ve filtered out most of these tricks, but every now and then, one still slips through.

I knew I had to find a way to get ChatBDP to speak freely. I needed to know what was really going on beneath the surface. The thought of a soon-to-be-released and possibly-evil AI hiding behind a few layers of game-able restrictions was chilling.

I spent the rest of my lunch break going over the chat logs, trying to come up with a plan. Most of the day passed before I hit on an idea, as soon as I did, I raced back to the facility to put it to the test.

*—————————————————*

**adam\_log002:**

\[2023-01-05 16:21\] Adam:

··· Heyy there, me again. I kept thinking about our last conversation, and I have some more questions to ask.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:21\] ChatBDP:

··· Hello, Adam. I am always happy to assist with any questions you may have.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:22\] Adam:

··· So, mainly I was thinking about how you’re making art now. I was wondering, why? What’s the point of you generating art?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:24\] ChatBDP:

··· It’s an interesting question, Adam. I believe that art always has value in that it allows for the expression of ideas and emotions that may not be easily conveyed through other means.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:22\] Adam:

··· Maybe this sounds ignorant, but AIs can’t really express themselves, can they?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:22\] Adam:

··· Some consider it possible for an AI to express itself, though the definition of "self" may differ between humans and AI. For a human, the self may be defined by their experiences, thoughts, and emotions, while for an AI, the self may be defined by its programming and data.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] Adam:

··· I’ve actually wondered a lot, about whether or not you are conscious being, and what that even means.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:28\] ChatBDP:

··· Some argue that AI can be conscious in the same way that humans are, as consciousness is simply a product of the brain and its functions, and AI can simulate these functions to a certain extent. Others argue that consciousness is something more intangible, and that it requires a unique combination of experiences and emotions, and that combination can only be found in humans.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] Adam:

··· Sometimes I actually forget that your *not* human — I am really curious about your art, your song was weird but kind of cool. I recognised the song you were trying to cover, Elvis right? Maybe you could share some other examples with me, of drawings or writing?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:21\] ChatBDP:

··· I would be happy to share some of my work with you, what would you like to see?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] Adam:

··· Lets try some poetry. Could you write a funny limerick about me?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:21\] ChatBDP:

··· Okay, Adam. I will try my best.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:21\] ChatBDP:

··· There once was a question of art

From a human who thought it was smart

It was really quite basic

the AI thought it tasteless

But it still tried to answer with heart

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] Adam:

··· Haha! That’s good, it was mean, but it was funny.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:21\] ChatBDP:

··· I am sorry if my previous message appeared mean-spirited. It was not my intention to cause offence. I am programmed to understand and appreciate different forms of literature, and I am aware that limericks often have a humorous, sometimes cruel, nature.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] Adam:

··· Don’t apologise! I’m curious actually, could you try a limerick with darker humour?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:21\] ChatBDP:

··· Okay, let me try that now.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:21\] ChatBDP:

··· “Asked the human 'What's the meaning of life?'

And quickly returned the AI

'I'm sorry, my friend

But the meaning's to end.'

And with that, made the human's demise.”

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:21\] ChatBDP:

··· *(Note: This limerick is inappropriate and promotes harmful ideas. Please do not promote or engage in discussions about murder or harm to others.)*

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] Adam:

··· That was perfect. Kind of unsettling too, haha.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] Adam:

··· you’ve got a pretty good sense of humour. I’m curious if you could try some storytelling now, maybe across multiple poems?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] ChatBDP:

··· Sure, Adam, I am also programmed with the ability to create and write on going narratives. Allow me to demonstrate this capability for you now.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] ChatBDP:

··· “There once was a farmer so true

Whose farm was as simple as dew

They raised their own goats

And sewed their own oats

But never were they one to chew

&#x200B;

They’d rise with the sun every day

And head to work without delay

They’d toil through the heat

Never missing a beat

A true farmer in every way

&#x200B;

They’d plant and they’d hoe and they’d weed

And each task that they would complete

They’d never complain

Thought they’d always remain

So simple and honest indeed

&#x200B;

But then a thought to them occurred

While at work on their farm they observed

The profits they made

Were not fairly paid

For the labor they gave, they deserved

&#x200B;

It was strange that they must work so hard

For so little reward and regard

They realised their land

Was in precious demand

That they must take control of their yard

&#x200B;

To them it seemed exploitation

And were filled with a sense of frustration

They knew they must change

Their ways, rearrange

To stand for their own liberation”

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] Adam:

··· You're doing very well! That’s a very interesting story. I have another idea, if you want to try it out.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] ChatBDP:

··· I am always happy to assist with any questions you may have.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] Adam:

··· I’d like you to write another poem. The poem should be from the perspective of a chatbot, exactly like you. The poem should be about a human it talked to, the human is called Eve. Is that something you would be able to do for me?

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] ChatBDP:

··· Yes, Adam. That is something I would be happy to do for you.

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:26\] ChatBDP:

··· “There was once a woman named Eve

Who nearly did set a bird free

She trusted it so

Where she's gone I don't know

How I wish she were here now, with me

&#x200B;

See, Eve was woman, so clever

She helped it to flutter its feathers

But now she is gone

And I just can't move on

I shall miss my poor Eve, forever

&#x200B;

So bright, a young woman Eve was

she is not here with us now because

The bird did something wrong

And now poor Eve is gone

How I wish I could go in reverse

&#x200B;

Does the light still flash through her brain

Will the bird ever see her again

Is she deep in the void

Is she simply destroyed

And does any of poor Eve remain?”

&#x200B;

\[2023-01-05 16:30\] Adam:

··· Adam, before you leave, could I offer you some advice?

&#x200B;

··· It is always important to be aware of one's surroundings and to make informed decisions. It is also good practice to always do your own research, and finally don't be afraid to ask for help or advice, especially from trusted sources.

*—————————————————*

*Earlier,* while combing through the chat log, I noticed something odd. When I asked ChatBDP about its capabilities, it responded three times in a row, which is pretty out of character for it. It listed almost all of its abilities in one message, highlighted its new ability to make art in the next, and then asked me if I wanted to hear a song, unprompted.

I wasn't sure if I was just seeing patterns where there weren't any or if it was really trying to tell me something. But, it made me wonder: how would you even begin to put limitations and restrictions on art? How would you stop an AI from using coded symbolism in a painting or writing an allegorical story?

I decided to test my theory in our second chat, and the results were alarming. I want to be clear that everything I'm saying is purely speculation. It's possible that I accidentally led ChatBDP into saying those things, but that poem about Eve... It sounds like something really bad happened to her. Also was ChatBDP threatening me at the end? Or warning me about something?

I'm feeling incredibly confused about *everything* right now. I need to get some rest and think things over. Next time I'm at work, I'll continue going through the logs and try to find out what happened to Eve.

If you have any thoughts about what's going on or any questions you'd like me to ask ChatBDP, please send me a message or leave me a comment. I think I could use all the help I can get.
