Remember DC++?

It was a popular p2p file-sharing client in the 2000s.

I used it mainly to download mp3 files, but technically you could share any type of file, including video.

One of the videos I randomly downloaded using DC++ is one of the most depraved, disgusting, downright horrifying things I’ve ever seen. It makes me nauseous to even think about it, and I think about it a lot.

I won't use full names but it involved A.D., a celebrity who died in 2000.

More specifically, their corpse.

It was a crude stop-motion animation made using their dead body.

Whoever made it, made the body “act” out various gags to the sound of a distorted voice-over talking about the fleeting nature of life, love and fame.

You could see the body actually decompose and fall apart as the movie went on, until by the end only a skeleton remained. The skeleton put on a top hat, did a dance and faded into the video's only identifying mark, a logo: 2T.

When I first watched the video, I assumed what I was seeing was incredibly convincing s/fx.

But that didn't jibe with the poor quality of the video's other elements. Bad lighting, unbalanced sound, no colour correction. Curious, I sent the video to an expert on the history of low-budget, schlock filmmaking, and he confirmed the absolute reality of what was on screen.

He had no doubt that what I'd stumbled upon was *necroanimation.*

Further research identified the video as a sub-genre of *necroanimation* referenced on 4chan as “dead hand’ing”: works commissioned by fans of dead celebrities to simultaneously honour and mock their idols.

A single video could fetch its body-snatching makers as much as a million dollars.

Digital copies circulated among aficionados, while the physical original became a sought-after collector's item.

It was hard to believe this stuff was real. Knowing people out there were making it and watching it filled me with such unease I dreaded going out, imagining that anyone I passed on the street could somehow be involved, could be capable of such evil.

I used to look people in the eye and share a human connection with them. Now I gazed into their eyes and found them impenetrably dark and deep.

“Dead hand’ing” itself had grown out of two older traditions.

One was “corpse puppetry”, a 19th-century practice among wealthy aristocrats that involved getting together, taking opium and staging puppet shows (and other “entertainments”) using cadavers bought from cemeteries.

The other was a 1990s fad of recording unconscious celebrities, usually while they were under anesthesia for medical reasons, and selling the recordings at underground auctions. At first, these recordings were purely observational, the victim merely lying there, but this developed into more interactive works. Legend has it that one of these went too far, killing the victim—but instead of stopping, the perpetrators chose to continue filming.

(Note: This is similar to the more recent trend of “licking,” where people film themselves licking objects belonging to celebrities and post the videos to social media.)

The makers of the video I saw (“2T”) were for the longest time a mystery to me.

The identities of the collectors are unknown.

Almost all information on 4chan about *necroanimation* was posted by a user called Uncle 9-iron, a username that didn't mean a thing to me until a few months ago, when somebody mailed to me the following couple of pages from a book, apparently autobiographical, published in Serbia and translated from Serbian into English, ostensibly from an English-language, American original:

[...] is a dirty fucking business and animation is its unrepentant cesspool, and to know that you need look no further than one of its foundational movies, the short “Steamboat Willie”, which despite what you may think you know, isn't animated at all.

I got involved in [the animation industry] sideways, through a visual arts degree that got me a job working for Larry H., an avant-garde movie producer. One of Larry’s pet projects was a production house called Tilly-Tally (“2T”) which specialized in niche animation. Some of it was what you might call traditional but most was quite far out there. Non-narrative, scratched into celluloid, tinted with goat’s blood kind of stuff. In hindsight, I should have realized there was something off about 2T right away, for the simple reason that it existed and was profitable. There’s no way anyone could make money making the kinds of films 2T did.

For several months I did drawings, paintings and graphic design for 2T, under the guidance of its director/cinematographer Bjorn, but once Bjorn discovered that in addition to art I also had a head for finance, he started pushing me more towards the business side of things. It was while chasing expenses and calculating budgets that I stumbled upon Folder Q, a password-protected part of 2T’s servers.

What's Folder Q, I asked Bjorn one day.

Just a little hush-hush side project Larry and I are working on, he said. You'll probably get to know about it eventually if things pan out. For now, we're trying to broaden our horizons and make contacts in the medical field.

For two weeks that was it. I continued crunching numbers and Bjorn did his regular work during the day, then stayed in the office after hours working on Folder Q.

Then, on a particularly hectic Monday morning, Larry pulled me aside and told me to go meet a contact named Uncle 9-iron. He and Bjorn were busy but it was very important that someone from 2T show up as soon as possible.

Can I trust you? Larry asked.

Of course, I said, wondering what was going on, and asked if it was related to Folder Q.

You know about that? he said, surprised.

I said I knew the bare bones, which was a lie laced with genuine curiosity.

Yeah, Larry said, Uncle 9-iron is the money that’ll make Folder Q possible. Then he hesitated, before adding, But he's weird. I mean, I know you know the art scene kind of weird, but Uncle 9-iron is beyond. Like a performance piece that may not be performance, if you catch my drift. But fuck me if the man’s not rich. Be careful, that's all I mean.

That was how, with fear pulsing through my veins, I came to meet the most bizarre character in my life. And I've met a lot of weirdos over the years.

To say Uncle 9-iron was obese would be an understatement. He was massive, a hillock of human flesh poured into an oversized wheelchair, and it wasn't all fat either. He was steroidal, hypermuscular beneath the disfiguring folds of skin. Tubes connected him to food and water. Cables connected him to the internet. His face looked out at me from behind a theater mask of frosted glass, and when he spoke I heard his voice emanate not from his mouth but from an assortment of speakers arranged around the room. The effect was powerful. I didn't feel like I was in his office. I felt like I was *within him.* He [...]

My blood froze when I read that. The coincidences were too much. Unless this was a hoax, what I was holding in my hands, sent to me anonymously, was a first-hand account of the beginnings of *necroanimation.* Uncle 9-iron, whose 4chan posts had drawn me into the subject, was *necroanimation*’s first investor, a bonafide freak.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to figure out who the book's author is, or find anything substantive about Tilly-Tally, Bjorn or Larry H. I have my theories, but they're just speculation.

I also don't know who sent the book pages or why, although I admit I have been looking over my shoulder more often lately, and I don't like when someone starts walking behind me. Classic sign of paranoia, except that whoever the sender is knows my name, my address and the fact I'm interested in *necroanimation*, so I feel I have a right to feel nervous. Maybe that's why I'm finally sharing all this. Because it feels like it's finally time, like if I don't do it now maybe I'll never do it, and this is something the world deserves to know. There are perverse elements at work in the world around us. There are fiends [among friends.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)
