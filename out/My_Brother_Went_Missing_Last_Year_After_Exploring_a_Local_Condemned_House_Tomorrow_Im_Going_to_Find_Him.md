At the edge of my hometown, there's a condemned house, but you shouldn’t go there. It’s a bad place. Something hungry lies dormant within, waiting to latch onto everything it possibly can and wear it's victims like a costume.

 

“So, what, it’s haunted or something?” Dylan asked as he rifled through my glove box, looking for something to entertain himself with.

“That’s what I’m assuming. If what William wrote about was true.”

“Okay, but didn’t he go missing last year? You couldn’t possibly be thinking—.”

“He’s my older brother, Dylan. I can’t just put the fact that he might still be alive behind me.”

My older brother went missing last year, at least, that’s what everyone thinks happened. I had overheard him talking about exploring the condemned house near the edge of our town. Whether it was with friends or telling mom and dad about how cool he thought it was, I was well aware of what he thought of it. I could have stopped him.

When he left, he was quiet about doing so. I only woke up to the sound of him closing the window as he jumped from the second floor into our yard. I should’ve called for him, but I didn’t want to get him in trouble.

That night was the last time I ever saw William alive, but it wasn’t the last I heard from him. The next day, he left me a letter. The contents of which, have brought me to where I am today. I transcribed this before following in Will’s footsteps. This is my brother’s story. This is how he went missing.

 

“To, Rick.

Sorry to say goodbye like this, but I’m out of options. I’m not going to be around anymore, but you don’t need to worry about that. I’m writing this so you don’t end up making the same mistake I did. When you read this, tell mom and dad that I ran away, it’ll be easier for them to think that I did. It’s just— I can’t get it out of my head. I have to satisfy my curiosity, Rick. I’m sorry you have to find out like this, but when you finish reading, you’ll understand. Just, don’t be mad at me.”

 

Mom and dad are heavy sleepers, so I figured I’d be able to get out of the house without much of a challenge. Richie, on the other hand, is a light sleeper. I’m going to have to be quick if I want to leave without him noticing. My bedroom window leads to the sloped part of our roof, so I can get to the ground below without hurting myself.

Backpack, flashlight, notepad, camera, I had everything I needed. By the time I was ready to go, it was 4:46 AM. Dad was going to get up soon to get ready for work, I had to move quickly. Gripping the bottom part of my window, I eased it up as to not make any unnecessary noise.

By the time it was halfway open, I heard shuffling from the room to my right. Shit, Richie was awake, what was I going to do? I quickly finished opening the window and exited my home. Turning around, I quickly shut the window and dropped to the ground below without anybody noticing.

 It was winter, so it wouldn’t be light out for another couple hours. I got in my car and started it. Pulling out of the driveway, I wondered if what I was doing was worth it. Was whatever could have been in this house worth potentially leaving my family? I quickly pushed that thought to the back of my head and brought the house back to the front of it.

22 XXXXX Drive (not going to get it out of me that easily, little brother.) I punched the address into my phone and pressed on. Landon, one of my friends, had gone to the house a couple months earlier. Strangely, he made it out just fine.

He even recommended that I go to it and check it out for myself. I attempted to ask him to come with me, but he never responded. Okay, I lied a little bit. This trip wasn’t just to satiate my own curiosity; I was going to this house because I wanted to find my friend.

By the time I had begun to mentally prepare myself for what was about to happen, I was already in the driveway of the large, imposing house. I grabbed everything I brought from the passenger seat and left my vehicle. Two stories, and it looks like nobody has lived here since it was created.

I took a couple deep breaths and then pressed on. Grabbing the door handle, I figured it was going to be locked. To my surprise, the knob came out of the door in my hand, and it creaked open inwards. Sweet, didn’t have to look for a way in.

I passed the threshold and looked around, turning my flashlight on. Cobwebs clung to the ceilings and corners of the house and dust coated nearly every surface my light shined on. It smelled old and musty.

I did a quick walkthrough of the first floor and determined that there were 4 total rooms downstairs. A living room, a dining room, a kitchen, and a bathroom. On the side of the staircase was a door leading down to the basement.

This was what everyone talked about, but it was going to have to wait. There was nothing interesting in any of the downstairs rooms. There wasn't really anything interesting except for the kitchen.

I opened up the refrigerator and found the dusty, crumbling remains of whatever last meal the residents of this house ate. I had to shut the door when I saw the worms wiggling out of the pot.

Turning around, I went over to the dining table. Three plates set for dinner. Three plates with the same food I found in the fridge on them. Three forks. I went to leave but had to do a double take. I whipped back around and found I was right.

There was a mummified *finger* wrapped around one of the forks.

“What the hell?” The words danced in my head. I didn’t want to speak for the fear of alerting anyone else who might be in the house with me, but I was surely shaken now. I took out my camera and snapped a photo of the fingered fork. When I went to leave this time, I actually went through with it. Time to head upstairs.

I knew the house was old, and so I knew that the stairs would creak when I stepped on them, but they didn’t. That should have been my first sign to leave. The stairs being in good condition meant somebody took care of them. The only thing on my mind at the time was an answer as to the whereabouts of my friend, all rational thoughts pushed to the back.

I reached the second floor and did another quick scan of it. Four rooms again. Three bedrooms and a bathroom. Having seen what was downstairs, I was a little hesitant to explore the rooms this time. My fears were quickly suppressed by the feeling that I wouldn’t find what I wanted if I didn’t go any further.

The first bedroom was easy to get into because the door was out of the frame, and I couldn’t find it anywhere else. Creeping in, I looked around with my flashlight.

Nothing of real interest popped up, but I did find a pair of socks on the pillow of the bed. I started to feel sick. Looking closer, I could see that the socks were about the size of ones that would belong to a child.

Snapping the photo, I turned around to leave when I heard it.

*Somebody was downstairs.*

I stopped dead in my tracks. Could—could they hear me? They were still moving around so they couldn’t have stopped to listen to me.

I didn’t want to take my chances downstairs, so I crept back out into the hallway. Maybe I could hide in one of the rooms with a door. I crouch-sprinted over to the second bedroom and grasped the knob. I got up and turned it. *Unlocked*. Okay, now to just get in. I opened the door slowly and nearly screamed.

As the hinges of the door screeched, whoever was downstairs stopped. They knew I was up here now. Knowing I didn’t have to be careful anymore, I rushed into the room and slammed the door. By the time I had done so, they were upstairs.

My eyes darted around the room looking for anything I could use to block the door. They landed on a chair next to the bed. I almost fell over trying to get to it but didn’t. I picked up the chair and slammed it under the door knob at the same time whoever was upstairs with me slammed into the door. I was safe, and they couldn’t get in.

I backed up and slid down the wall into a sitting position. Either it was going to get in, or I was going to wait it out. I figured I could use the time to look over my photos. I scanned the picture of the fingered fork and noticed something. Zooming in and enhancing the image, I noticed something. I nearly dropped the camera when it hit me.

It was *Landon’s* finger.

When we were younger, he had messed around with one of his dad’s power tools and sliced the tip of his index finger off. It was able to be reattached but left a scar on his *right* index finger. That same scar was on the finger wrapped around the fork.

I’m not sure what scared me more; the fact that it was my friend’s finger on the utensil, or the fact that he had all ten fingers when he told me about this place. Before I could gather my thoughts, a voice rang out from behind the door.

“Hey… let me in.” It—it was Landon’s voice. Why was he doing this?

“How do I know it’s you?!” I yelled, desperation quickly overtaking me. I didn’t know if he could hear the fear in my voice, but I could certainly feel it in my body.

“I’m your friend, of course it’s me.” The voice was flat. Zero cadence, like a robot was trying to mimic him.

“I’m—what’s something only you AND I would know?” I had to throw something out. I needed him to say something about the scar. I spoke again, correcting myself.

“N—no, wait. What finger is your scar on?”

“……” I didn’t like that. I needed him to answer me.

“Landon. *What. Finger. Is. It. On?*” Regardless of the answer, I knew I wasn’t going to like it. The severed finger downstairs told me that much.

“……” He doesn’t know. He doesn’t know what scar the finger is on. *That’s not Landon*.

As if to solidify my realization, whatever was on the other side of the door slid something under it. I knew what it was. I didn’t need to look down to see, but I did anyways. Between my feet, was the *real* Landon’s severed finger. Before I could do anything else, I heard heavy footsteps as whatever was on the other side of the door ran downstairs.

After waiting for about 15 minutes, I decided it had to be safe enough to venture back out into the house. I crept downstairs and bolted for the front door.

There was a wardrobe in front of the door frame. I gave it my all, but it wouldn’t budge. I was stuck in here. I heard footsteps from the kitchen. It would take too long to go back upstairs, so I went to the only place I hadn’t yet explored.

*The basement*.

Opening the door, I crept in and closed it behind me. I turned on my light and ran down the stairs. This room must have been sealed off, because it smelled like *death*. I reached the base of the stairs and looked around. I had to stifle a scream and cover my mouth to stop myself from puking. There were dozens of corpses down here. No blood, no entrails and no insides.

I went up to one of them and it looked almost as though the corpse was withered. Not old, but like something had sucked the life out of it. What the fuck happened here?

I—I wasn’t the first person to come down here. As I heard the basement door close, I finally realized that I was *not* going to be the last person to do so either. I went to the opposite end of the basement. I know what happened to my friend now. That wasn't really him who told me to come here.

*Landon’s withered corpse was leaning against the wall, his mouth agape. Four fingers on his right hand.*

It’s him. As the footsteps behind me grow louder, only one thought goes through my head; “it’s really him.” I turned around and shined the flashlight on the thing wearing Landon’s skin. It raised its five fingered, scarred left hand and smacked my flashlight, destroying it and breaking my wrist in the process.

I fell to my knees and screamed out in pain. The thing walked up to me and put its hand on my head. Everything went black.

I woke up outside of the house, the sun shining on me. I sat upright and wheezed. My whole chest hurt, as well as my mouth and throat. It felt almost as though something crawled inside me. I got up and decided my next move. A force was drawing me back to the house, and I couldn’t resist it for long.

I trudged back home. It took *hours*. It was a school day as well as a workday, so by the time I made it back, I was the only one home, *good*.

I stumbled up to my room, the pain in my chest was nearly unbearable. I began writing a letter. A letter that would explain everything. I had to lie to mom and dad, if only to protect them. I could tell Richie though, he’d get it. Ugh, it’s getting worse now. I need to leave soon.

Rich, I’m leaving this on your pillow, you’ll find it. When you do, don’t come after me. I made this choice, so I have to deal with it. By the time you read this, whatever killed and impersonated Landon is likely to have done the same to me.

Tell mom and dad that I just ran away, that I got sick of living here. But also tell them that I love them. And uh, I love you too little brother. I need to go now, while I still have at least a *little* bit of control. Don’t come back for me.

From what I could read, there was a little splatter of blood on the corner, but there was nothing else besides that. After reading it and coming to my own conclusion, I knew what I had to do.

I had to *find* my brother.
