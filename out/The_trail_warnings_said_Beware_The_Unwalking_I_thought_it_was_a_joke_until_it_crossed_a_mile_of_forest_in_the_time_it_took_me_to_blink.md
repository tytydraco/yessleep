I believe that my world is based on objective, measurable facts. I built my identity on it. I’m a trail runner, an elite one if I may say, or at least I was. For me, I do not trust in stories, but every remote trail has its local legends, its boogeymen. Spook stories told around campfires by people who get winded walking to their car. I’ve always viewed them with a kind of arrogant disdain. Ghosts in the woods? Monsters in the dark? It’s just a lack of context. A snapped twig is a bear, a strange shadow is a tree, a weird feeling is just dehydration. There is always a rational explanation.

That’s what I believed, anyway. Before the trail.

It’s not on any official maps. It’s an unsanctioned loop, a brutal, unforgiving track known to the small, hardcore community of local runners simply as “The Needle.” It’s a 50 mile suffer-fest of punishing climbs and technical descents through one of the most remote, untouched national forests in the country. It’s a legend in its own right. And I was going to be the one to finally set a speed record on it.

I started at dawn. The air was cool and sharp, the forest silent except for the whisper of the wind. My body felt perfect, a well-oiled machine humming with potential. My watch was synced, my pack was light, my confidence was absolute. The trailhead was marked by a series of crude, faded warnings hammered into the trees. Scraps of wood with words painted in what looked like old house paint.

 “BEWARE THE UNWALKING.”

“STAY AWAY FROM THE TRAIL.”

“DO NOT PUSH FURTHER.”

I actually laughed. It was so perfectly cliché. The Unwalking. It sounded like something a teenager would invent to scare his girlfriend. I took a picture of the signs, a little joke for my running group later, and started my watch. The first few hours were a blur of green motion. My legs pumped, my lungs burned in that familiar, pleasant way. The forest was beautiful, I suppose, but to me, it was just a problem set. A series of obstacles, roots, rocks, inclines to be overcome with maximum efficiency.

Around three hours in, I reached the first major landmark: a high, windswept ridge that offered a panoramic view of the entire valley. I paused to hydrate and check my progress. The data was beautiful. My pace was solid, my heart rate was in the optimal zone. I was making incredible time. I stood there, feeling that familiar surge of physical accomplishment, and scanned the vast, rolling expanse of green.

That’s when I saw it. On a distant, parallel ridge, miles away, was a detail that didn't belong.

It was a tall, thin, dark shape, stark against the skyline. It was unnaturally still, unnaturally straight. It lacked the fractal, chaotic shape of a tree or the rounded, weathered look of a rock formation. It was just… a line. A vertical anomaly in a horizontal world.

I got out my phone, thinking it might make a cool, eerie photo. I zoomed in as far as the digital zoom would allow, but the image dissolved into a pixelated mess. The shape was just a slightly darker smudge. I didn't even bother taking the picture. A dead, lightning-stripped tree trunk, maybe. Or a weirdly shaped pillar of rock. Visually interesting, but ultimately meaningless data. I made a mental note of its GPS coordinate on my watch and continued my run, the thought was already fading.

The next two hours were brutal. The trail plunged down into a dark, damp valley, a punishing section of switchbacks and stream crossings. I pushed the pace, enjoying the burn, feeling my body perform flawlessly. When I finally climbed out of the valley and onto the next ridge, I felt phenomenal. I’d crushed that section. I stopped, panting, and glanced at my watch to confirm the massive distance I’d just covered.

The screen read:

Distance: 0.2 Miles

Time Elapsed: 2h 04m 17s

I froze. My breath hitched in my chest. It was impossible. a glitch ?. It had to be. My watch must have lost its GPS signal down in the dense canopy of the valley. That was the only rational explanation. Annoyed, I shook my wrist, as if that would fix it. I held down the button and rebooted the device. It took a long, frustrating minute to reacquire the satellite signals, its little icon blinking, searching. Finally, it beeped, the screen refreshed.

The result was the same. 0.2 miles.

A cold, unfamiliar feeling, something that was almost, but not quite yet, I think fear, began to uncoil in my stomach. Frustrated and unnerved, I turned and looked back towards the peak where I’d been two hours ago. It should have been a distant, hazy silhouette on the horizon.

Instead, it was right there. Looming over me, so close. It was as if I had barely moved at all.

And on the distant, parallel ridge, the dark shape was still there. I squinted. I couldn’t be sure, but it felt… larger. More defined. Closer.

I squeezed my eyes shut, then opened them again. The watch is broken. My eyes are playing tricks on me from the exertion. It’s a simple, logical chain of cause and effect. I forced the panic down, turning it into a hot, angry energy. I would just run harder. I would outrun the glitch. I started running again with a frantic, furious desperation.

The next few hours, the world broke.

The trail, which was famously a single, unbroken track, began to defy logic. I passed a distinctive, lightning-scarred oak tree, its trunk split down the middle in a jagged, black wound. I noted it as a landmark. An hour later, after a grueling climb up a steep, rocky incline, I passed the exact same tree. The same split trunk. The same blackened scar.

Panic finally breached my defenses. It flooded my system, cold and sharp. I stopped, gasping for air, my mind racing to find a rational explanation. I must have gotten turned around. I must have taken a branching path I hadn’t noticed. But there were no branching paths. The trail was a simple, brutal loop. My own data, senses, understanding of space and time, it was all failing me.

I decided to stop. To get my bearings, and force logic back into a situation that had become illogical. I found a small clearing, the sunlight a welcome relief after the deep gloom of the forest. I sat on a fallen log, my head in my hands, trying to calm my racing heart, trying to reboot my own brain.

I sat there for a long time, just breathing. When I finally lifted my head, I scanned the tree line, trying to re-establish some sense of normalcy.

And I saw it again.

What I saw on a distant ridge before. was just here. Standing at the edge of the very same clearing I was in, perhaps two hundred yards away, and what was just a shape. Is now a figure. It looked as though someone had taken a tall, dead, blackened tree and twisted it into the grotesque parody of a human form. It was impossibly tall and thin, its limbs like fire-hardened branches, its body a column of what looked like charred bark. It had no discernible face, no features, but I knew, with a certainty that defied all reason, that it was watching me. It stood utterly, completely motionless, its posture unchanged from when I had first seen it miles away.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t run. My mind was too busy trying to solve the impossible equation. How did it get here? Or, a more terrifying thought: had I, in my looping, nonsensical journey, walked in a circle and ended up right back where it had been all along? Had I been running towards it without realizing it?

I had to be sure. I had to apply my own logic, my own methodology. I decided to perform an experiment.

I kept my eyes locked on the figure. I refused to blink. I refused to look away. My heart was a frantic drum, but my gaze was a steel anchor. For ten solid minutes, I stared. The thing did not move a millimeter. Not a twitch, not a sway in the gentle breeze. It was as solid and still as the earth it stood on.

A sliver of hope, of rational explanation, returned. It was just a statue. Some macabre piece of local folk art, put out here to scare people. The looping trail, the GPS glitch, it was all in my head, a product of exhaustion and paranoia. I felt a wave of foolish relief.

I turned my head away for no more than three seconds. Just a quick, reflexive glance to my side to reach for my water bottle. The snap of my head turning back was just as fast.

The thing was now fifty yards away.

It hadn't moved. It hadn't taken a step. It was in the exact same silent, still, waiting pose. But the one hundred and fifty yards of dense, tangled forest that had been between us… was simply gone. The space, the distance, had vanished in the three seconds I had looked away.

The understanding hit me with the force of a physical blow. The warnings at the trailhead. BEWARE THE UNWALKING. It didn’t walk. It didn’t have to.

I ran.

My training, my discipline, my carefully engineered body, it all dissolved into the pure, animal instinct of a prey animal that has just seen the teeth of the predator. I just ran. The forest became a green, whipping, meaningless tunnel. My lungs burned, my legs screamed for mercy, but I pushed harder, calling on every reserve of strength I had ever built.

I refused to look back. The terror of what I might see, of how much closer it might be, was a physical weight on my shoulders. I just stared straight ahead, my eyes wide, focused on a future that didn't involve that silent, waiting shape.

And then I noticed it. I was running, my feet pounding the earth, my arms pumping. I could feel the motion, the effort. But the trees beside me weren't moving. A specific, moss-covered birch tree was just… there, in my peripheral vision, staying perfectly in place, no matter how hard I ran. I was a hamster on a wheel. I was generating motion, but I was not achieving movement. I was running in place, and the forest was a static, painted backdrop.

My mind shattered. A choked, terrified sob tore from my throat. I had to look back. I couldn't bear not knowing.

I risked a single, fleeting glance over my shoulder.

It was right behind me. So close I could have reached out and touched its charred, bark-like skin. It hadn’t moved. It was just… there. It had simply deleted the space between us.

The sight of it broke the last of my resolve. My foot caught on a rock I hadn't seen, and I went down, hard. My head hit the ground, and the world dissolved into a brief, brilliant flash of white light, and then, mercifully, nothing at all.

I woke up shivering. I was lying on the damp, cold ground, under a tree. I sat up, my head throbbing, my body crying of aches and bruises. I looked around. I recognized the crude, faded signs hammered into the trees. “STAY AWAY FROM THE TRAIL.”

I was back at the trailhead.

I don’t know how I got there. I don’t know what happened after I fell. I was just… returned. Discarded. The trail was still there, a dark mouth leading into the woods. I scrambled to my feet, my legs unsteady, and I fled. I didn’t look back. I got in my car and drove, and I didn’t stop until I was home.

I thought it was over. A nightmare confined to that cursed stretch of woods.

Then, a week ago, I noticed the patch.

It’s on the back of my left hand. It started as a small, discolored spot, about the size of a quarter. The skin felt dry, strangely hard. I thought it was a callus, or a rash. But it’s growing. The skin is turning a pale, ashen grey. It’s lost all its feeling. And the texture… the texture is all wrong. It’s developing a fine, vertical grain. It looks and feels, for all the world, like a patch of smooth, petrified wood.

I’ve been to three doctors. They’re baffled. They’ve taken samples. They’ve run tests. They have no answers. They use words like “sclerotic” and “unknown dermatological condition.” They give me creams that do nothing.

The patch is bigger now. It’s spread to my wrist. And I know, with a certainty that is slowly crushing the life out of me, what it is. I looked away, and it closed the distance. I ran, and it froze the space around me. I fell at its feet. It touched me.

And now, a piece of it is inside me. Growing.

I don't know what to do. Do I go back? Do I face it? Would that even do anything? Or do I just sit here and wait, and watch myself slowly turn into a tree? The facts are gone. The logic is gone. All that's left is this… this impossible growth. And the memory of a silent, waiting shape, and the terrifying knowledge that you can’t outrun something that doesn’t have to move.
