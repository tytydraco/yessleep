I managed to disarm the mechanic. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

It's not because I magically became a master swordswoman over the course of the past couple of weeks, though I have been getting better. I'm tired as all get out, but hey, I'm less bruised than I was after our first session. Or maybe I've simply become numb to it and that's just my skin, now. 

Either way, we'd advanced from me learning footwork to blocking as well as practicing my strikes. The nights were long and rough as we gradually expanded upon all of these lessons. 

There were many times that I found myself using some of the steps Deirdre taught me during our little dance parties, oddly enough. Honestly, if it weren't for her, I probably wouldn't be as far along as I am. 

Let me jump right to the day I knocked the wooden sword from the mechanic's hand. Just know that this moment didn't come easily. Neither did anything that followed afterwards.  

That particular sparring session was going better than previous ones had. Not much better, granted, but I had managed to block a few of his attacks and still had enough energy to keep moving somewhat fast.

Something I had noticed about the mechanic was that back in the mine, he didn't chase the white stag, at least not in the way most predators do. He’d *intercepted* it. Any time I'd ever tried to run from him, he'd always cut me off, always a step ahead from where I was going to be. This pattern became even more clear the more time I spent trying not to get beaten to death by him. He predicts where his prey is going to go and reacts accordingly. 

If I wanted to get one over on him, I'd have to find some way to break his line of sight somehow. Unfortunately, those fucking compound eyes make it so that he has fewer blind spots than humans do. 

He wasn't giving me any chances to get distance on him, always able to figure out where I was going to go next to keep me within his reach.  

I got the idea to make him block me then pirouetted behind him, ducking beneath his wings and actually managing to nick the bottom one. I heard him take in a sharp breath afterwards. 

There was a torrent of air, kicking up fallen leaves from around us, then he was out of Ratcatcher’s reach, though he did stumble slightly. It was only a small scratch right at the bottom of the lower set of Iolo's wings, probably no longer than a couple of inches, but it was enough to cause the delicate skin around the cut to blister until the iridescent membrane resembled bubble wrap. 

*That's it!*

Quickly, I brought up Ratcatcher just as a particularly aggressive strike almost battered my collarbone. The impact made me stagger, so I leaned into it, letting myself fall back to give myself some space. Of course, Iolo wasn't about to let me catch my breath after I had the audacity to graze him, and was already trying to knock me on my ass. He damn near succeeded. 

*Just need to get his hand. The reaction to the iron should be enough to make him drop his weapon.*

The barrage paused for a moment, long enough for me to notice his hurt wing twitch. He was a tad slower now and slightly less graceful. However, I'd also *definitely* pissed him off. 

Thinking that he'd be impaired on his injured side, I went for it, but he was expecting that. I tried to make it convincing. Make it look like I was focused more on that wing instead of his left hand. 

It must've worked because I took Ratcatcher in a wide arc and sliced the back of Iolo's hand. 

There was a hot sizzle, then his fingers jerked as if he'd been scalded. The wooden sword fell with a heavy thud. 

*I did it. Holy SHIT, I actually did it!*

Iolo laughed humorlessly, his head tilting, “That was good. I'll give ya that. Infuriatin’, but good.”

“Tell me what you know about the wedding photo. *Now.*” I demanded, raising Ratcatcher at him, not putting it past him to try to retaliate against me. 

He replied, “I’ll do ya one better. Let's go on a little field trip!”

Frustrated, I sighed, “Tell me what I'm up against first.”

“A lover scorned.” He said. “Or rather, a *muse.* Ya gettin’ me?”

*Oh no.* 

As I've discussed with some of yinz in my comments, terrible things tend to happen to humans that attract the affections of the Neighbors. Generally speaking, they don't see us as equals. As such, their love isn't formed upon a foundation of respect and tenderness, but of ownership. 

There are no greater examples of this than the Muses. 

These Neighbors intentionally seek out mortals, having a particular appetite for those who are artistically inclined in some regard. As the name implies, they'll offer their victims endless inspiration for the low, low price of the human’s unfaltering love and devotion. 

However, what they don't tell the victim is that they're slowly draining their lives over time. The longer the relationship continues, the more worse for wear the human becomes. Eventually, the human will be reduced to nothing but a husk as they are stripped of their life and sanity. 

What's even worse? Death isn't enough to break the bond between them. Whoever the Muse ensnares is fated to continue to remain their slave in the afterlife as well, forced to continue composing whatever poetry, music, or artistic pieces that attracted the Muse to them in the first place until another unfortunate soul is found to replace them.

When it comes to these Neighbors, prevention is the best treatment. As long as yinz politely decline their advances, they'll move on to someone else. However, once a human accepts their affections and all the creative benefits that come along with it, it's almost impossible to become disentangled. It's only over once the Muse says it is.  

On that note, the Muses can become highly violent if they suspect that their victim has been unfaithful to them. Even if the human tries to break ties kindly, the Muse will see it as infidelity. Like I said, it isn't over unless this Neighbor says it is. 

“You know where the Muse is, I take it?” I questioned. 

“Of course.” He confirmed. “Now, I expect you on your best behavior. Bring the sword, but don't ya go wavin’ it around unless I tell ya to. Understandin’ me, pup?”

I nodded, sliding Ratcatcher back into its sheath as I started to follow him. He retrieved his banjo, his keys jingling as he snatched them up as well. 

“Might wanna leave the four-leaf clover.” He advised. “Muses ain't so pretty when you can see the *real* them. And they don't much care for bein' unmasked.”

Iolo's wing twitched again. He grunted, then rolled his shoulder uncomfortably as if trying to work it out. 

*Serves you right, asshole.*

I reached into my pocket to pull out the clover, but began to overthink it. What if this was some sort of trap? No. As much as it disturbed me to acknowledge it, I had to admit to myself that Iolo is possessive. He’d raise hell before to allowing the Muse to enchant me. 

Once I set the clover down on a rock, the mechanic's ‘pretty boy act,’ as he eloquently put it, was back in place. The rash on the back of his hand looked far worse this way, the skin shiny red and blistered as if I’d poured boiling oil on him. 

Good. Shame he didn't go into anaphylaxis. 

He caught me looking at it and sneered, “Looks like I'm gonna have to stop goin’ so easy on ya.” 

I resisted the urge to groan as it sank in that training was about to become even more unbearable in the near future. 

Instead, I decided to say something I knew would irritate him, “You should keep an Epi-Pen on you. Wouldn't want you having a more severe reaction.”

His eyes slitted, but that smirk stayed in place. “Don't be gettin’ too cocky, pup.”

“Just looking out for you.” I replied coolly. 

“Ha! Yeah, *sure* you were. Let's get goin’.” 

In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have pushed my luck with him so much. He doesn't have much patience for me mouthing off to him to begin with. From the very start of the night, I'd put myself on thin ice. 

He had me follow him to his truck, opening the door for me in the guise of a gentleman. The rash on the back of his hand was even more grotesque up close. He hadn't been exaggerating when he'd told me that Ratcatcher was made of pure iron. The difference in reaction between it and the fire poker was a bit shocking. 

Prior to getting in, I snagged the wedding photo from the Jeep, thinking it could be useful. Before shutting the door, Iolo reached past me to retrieve a well-used bottle of aloe from the glove box. 

Yinz don't know how good it feels to finally be able to hurt him in a way that matters. Gotta enjoy every small victory I can get over him. 

By the time the mechanic took his place behind the wheel, he'd collected himself. His annoyance from me giving him shit earlier was swiftly fading away. At least, I'd thought it did. 

“What about the groom?” I asked on the way to visit the Muse, dreading the answer. 

I never outright told him that ‘the groom’ was my grandfather. That didn't seem like something he should know. He'd already assumed correctly that he was a part of my family, but I was worried that if he knew what the exact relation was, he'd find some way to use it against me. 

Iolo shrugged one shoulder, “It's hard even for me to find someone who's been erased. Figure we'd learn that when we pay his Muse a visit.”

Our destination wasn't far. A gravel driveway that led deep into the woods. The Muse had a baby pink mailbox with a handmade sign nailed to it: ‘Violin lessons here!’

That made my stomach drop. The Muse was looking for more. Someone to fill the void my grandpa had left. How many others has it taken? How many other people out there have forgotten somebody that they should remember? 

That thought made me want to tear up. All of those empty photos. Grandpa might've loved my mom. He might've loved me. He could've been the father figure I'd never had, but this Muse took that opportunity away from us. All of us.  

The Neighbors shouldn't have as much power as they do. Or, more accurately, I wish they didn't use their immense power to hurt us like this. They tear up families and people, then go back to teaching the violin or fixing cars like it means nothing. Though, I suppose to them, it doesn't. 

To my shock, Iolo left the banjo in the truck's cab, circling around to the covered bed. He reached in, producing what looked to be a violin case. Fucker's multi-talented, I guess. 

He smirked, “Haven't broke this thing out in a minute! Not since that lil' encounter with the devil while back!”

“Wait, the devil?” I asked dumbly, caught completely off guard by this passive admission. 

“Ya know? The devil? From the Bible?” 

“Yes, I *know* who the devil is!” I snapped, then shook my head. “You know what? I don't have the time or patience for this!”

He snickered, falling behind me as I marched up to the door to knock on it. 

The thing that looked like a woman smiled at me beautifully as she opened the door. Her eyes looked wrong. Too hungry. 

The welcoming expression on her face faltered when she saw Iolo behind me. 

If I didn't know Iolo better, I'd think his demeanor was friendly as he greeted her. “Howdy!”

“To what do I owe the pleasure, Huntsman?” She asked, though by her stiff tone, she did not take *any* pleasure in his presence. 

*Girl, same.*

“Just to learn a thing or two.” He held up the violin case for emphasis. “Saw your sign out front. I’m a bit rusty.”

The Muse's smile was strained, but she didn't dare refuse him, stepping aside to let us both in. 

When she shut the door behind us, she eyed him nervously, “You came here for a lesson?”

“I said I wanted to learn somethin’. Didn't say it was violin.” He replied with a wink, that wicked look in his eye. 

*Oh, God, what are you up to now?*

I took out the wedding photo, speaking to the Muse calmly despite my unease, “I'm looking for the person missing from this picture. Any information that you may have would be helpful.”

When I held it up to her, her eyes clouded with hatred. Her polite act dropped instantly as she snarled, “You get that *whore* out of my face!”

I was taken aback by this abrupt switch in demeanor. She had gone from apprehensiveness to bestial rage at the flip of a switch.  

Meanwhile, Iolo cackled, “Still a sore spot?”  

Shaking with fury, the Muse growled through clenched teeth, “You come into my home with a picture of *her?!* Who do you *think* you *are,* you wretched girl?!”

“Wait a minute!” I raised my voice slightly, putting my hands up between us. “I just want to know what happened!”

“What do you think?!” The Muse shrieked, her face turning red as she took a slow step towards me. “*He* told me he loved me! But then he tried to leave. *Nobody* leaves me!”

I took a step back from her. “Where is he now? Is he dead?”

“He’ll *never* leave me. Not ever again.” She growled, coming closer. 

As all of this went on, Iolo simply watched, that damned smirk on his face, seeming to love every minute of it. The violin case was open, but he wasn't in a hurry to get the instrument out. I was on my own.

That's when I began to hear whispers. They sounded close. Quickly, they became less frantic, quieter. The whispering thing was coming towards the house, *fast.*

The Muse tilted her head to such an absurd angle that it appeared as if her neck had been broken, “Come to think of it… you look a bit like her.” She breathed. “And you have *his* jawline. Yes, I see it now. The daughter of the whore and the unfaithful.”

“*Hoo,* you gonna let her talk to you like that, pup?” Iolo asked. 

I drew Ratcatcher, not daring to even blink as she suddenly glared at Iolo. “And *you!* What stake do you have in this?!”

He ignored her, grinning at me as he held up the back of his injured hand. “Show me this wasn't a fluke.”

I waited for her to come to me, knowing that the Muse would most likely be stronger and faster than me. 

As I did so, I made one last attempt to reason with her, “I didn't come here to attack you-” 

The mechanic rolled his eyes, interrupting me with an impatient sigh, “Jesus fuckin’ Christ, pup, enough with the ‘goody two shoes’ bullshit! I told you to prove somethin’, now you better fuckin' prove it!”

The Muse went for me, thinking I wouldn't be paying attention with him berating me. I slashed at her as she reached for me, slicing into her forearm. Her scream was familiar. I'd heard it before. Where had I heard it before? 

The moment the iron met her skin, her lovely disguise melted away. I saw the Muse for what she truly was. 

The mechanic hadn't been kidding about her true appearance. Her mouth resembled that of a leech, circular and lined with rows of sharp little teeth. It wasn't located on the lumpy, head-like structure at the top of her anatomy, but her groin. The rest of her appeared to be made out of clay, shifting and rippling with a patchwork of various facial features and skin tones. Grimacing mouths appeared at one point, then the next, she was all wide eyes. The only part of her that never changed was the horrific mouth between her legs. 

Iolo doubled over laughing at my reaction, “Didn't I tell ya?”

She cried out again, her doughy body beginning to stretch until she towered over me, her arms becoming boneless as they reached around me in a whip-like motion. I ducked away before the awful appendages could touch me, convinced that her melting flesh would be enough to change me in ways that nobody would recognize. 

A low hum shook my ribcage. In the corner of my eye, I saw the whispering thing in the window. 

The Muse didn't seem concerned with it, screaming obscene things about my appearance, my sexuality; you name it, she insulted it. All of the jealousy and bitterness she'd felt towards Grandma was directed at me. Meanwhile, I danced around the room as I tried to get close enough to cut her again. 

“*He’d never love you like he did me!*” She screamed, her voice shifting, sounding like a different person with each word. “*He’s MINE!*”

I avoided her arm again as it lashed over my head, taking the opportunity to swipe Ratcatcher’s blade along her side. The stretchy skin sizzled like oil in a pan, making my stomach turn. I leapt back just as she began to flail for me once more, yelling in what sounded to be a mixture of anguish and terror. 

“*You won't take him from me!*” 

The mechanic was watching from the sofa, scrutinizing every move I made with a faint smile. 

“*Huntsman! Do something!*” She pleaded, the desperation in her tone giving me pause. 

He smirked at me as if we were sharing a private joke, saying apathetically, “No. Stop. Don't do it.”

*God, he's an asshole.*

He clicked his tongue at the Muse. “‘Fraid puppydog’s not listenin’ to me.”

The Muse's body became cratered with rolling eyes again as she held one elongated hand to her bleeding side, snarling at Iolo, “Your pet will betray you as mine did!”

His *pet.* My lip curled in revulsion. 

“Oh, I'm countin’ on it!” Iolo cheerfully informed her. “I'm countin’ on her to fight me ‘til the very end.”

The way he looked at me scared me then. I swallowed, forcing myself to ignore the heat of his stare as best as I could. The Muse. Pay attention to the Muse.  

The whispering thing couldn't tear its orange eyes away from me as it loomed outside the window. It groaned. The only one who paid it any mind was me, but I didn't have time to focus on it. The Muse was limping towards me as she clutched at her side, blood pouring from her torso, staining the shiny wooden floor. 

Wrong. All of this was wrong. It wasn't like dealing with our usual atypical pests. Even when we do have to euthanize them (which again, we try not to, if we can help it) we’re humane about it. She was agonized, whimpering as she tried to hold her blistered skin together. I know she'd done horrible things to my grandpa and God knows how many others, but I still felt gross.

Between the Muse’s injuries and the fact that I reminded her of her heartbreak, there wasn't a doubt in my mind that I was torturing her. 

Iolo read my hesitation instantly, his disapproval obvious, “You gonna finish the job, or am I gonna have to?”

The Muse reached for me weakly, her body heaving. I swung for her midsection, hoping that if I could get her heart, it would be over. She didn't try to evade me. 

Afterwards, the Muse fell. She coughed wetly as the floor became slippery with her blood. She stopped moving. Her malleable flesh halted its shifts, reduced to nothing but a lump of red, wet clay.

The mechanic rose, approaching me. “How’d it feel, pup?”

*Terrible. It felt terrible.* 

“What are you actually training me for?” I asked instead, pointing the sword at him, already knowing that I wasn't going to like his answer. 

Before I could blink, he had my wrist. I tried to wrench it from his grasp, or at the very least rotate it enough that the iron could graze him, but Iolo was done going easy on me. 

He was close enough that the scent of black cherries covered up the stench of the Muse’s blood. “I told you already.”

“I know you can't lie, but you're also not telling me everything.”

He raised his eyebrows, the smirk evolving into a grin. “I said I'd make you a hero. Never said whose hero you'd be.”

My heart sank. I swallowed, fruitlessly trying to get away from him again, my mouth dry and only getting dryer, “You don't…”

He watched me struggle for words. I came up short, only able to get out, “I can't be a Hunter!”

“You can.” Iolo replied lightly. “And you will. The *‘how’* will depend on your performance goin’ forward.”

I shook my head quickly, feeling like I was about to dislocate my shoulder as I tried to yank my wrist away once again. “I- I'm not-”

There was a low hum from outside, the whispering thing growing restless, but Iolo ignored it, focused entirely on me. 

“You got a while to go.” He said calmly. “But I know you'll get there. Whether or not you’ll be where I want ya by Samhain will be the tricky part.”

Samhain. That's not far off. Not far off at all. 

“What if I don't?” I countered, trying desperately to free myself, as if by moving away from him, I could run from this life debt. And from what he wanted to do to me. What he wanted to make me into.  

The mechanic didn't hold me hard enough to hurt me, but enough that I couldn't move away from him. He gave my wrist one harsh shake, then Ratcatcher clattered to the floor, leaving me completely defenseless.

“What if I just stagnate?” I continued, heart pounding. “Would you want to recruit someone who can't do much more than the basics?”

“Let me spell it out for ya, pup, since it just ain't sinkin’ in.” He said, voive low, that hand not releasing its iron grip on me for even a moment. “You don't get a say in this. You *will* learn. ‘Less you want to spend the rest of eternity as a crow. Or maybe a hound. That one would certainly be fittin’, wouldn't it?”

“Why are you doing this to me?!” 

“Same reason that Muse took the groom.” 

He pulled me into him then. My eyes went wide as his lips pressed against mine, his other hand resting against the small of my back to keep me close to him. Shocked, I tried to push either him or myself away with my free hand, keeping my mouth still, refusing to return the kiss. There was another hum from outside followed by a bang against the side of the house. 

That's when it clicked. The whispering thing couldn't leave this forest. It had tried to get my attention so many times, but I could never understand it; worse yet, I’d thought it meant me harm. But looking back, every time it had seen me in danger, it had tried to intervene. It had eaten those crows. It distracted Briar. It had been trying to lead me away from the mechanic back when I was trying to diagnose Victor's condition. 

Oh God. How could I have been so *stupid?*   

My grandpa had been here this whole time. And I’d *run* from him.  

Thankfully, the interruption made Iolo break the kiss, glaring over his shoulder at the whispering thing. The whispers were still faint, but urgent, making my temples throb along with my frantic heartbeat. Once again, the whispering thing - Grandpa - was trying to protect me. 

I didn't want him to kiss me again. Being pressed against him like that, his hand cradling my spine, his chest against mine… it was too intimate. 

“Let me deal with it.” I said quickly, desperate to get out of his embrace. 

My heart fluttered in panic, mind racing with thoughts such as, *How did this happen? Why is this happening? Didn't Iolo say he hated me? What is this? How do I stop this?*

The whispering thing pounded on the house again. Its hum made the house shake. 

To my relief, Iolo's arms slid away from me, but not before he gave me a surprisingly soft peck on the cheek.

“Go meet your grandad, pup.” He breathed mockingly into my ear. 

Clearly, he'd made the same connection I did. Or… Oh, that *fucker.*

“How long have you known?” I demanded, tearing myself away from him the moment I was able to. 

He made his way to the violin case, either not noticing or not caring as he left bootprints in the chunky blood coating the floor. “A while.”

I snatched Ratcatcher off the ground as I snapped, “How long is ‘a while?’”

He smiled before repeating, “A *while.*”

I shook my head in irritation, absent-mindedly trying to clean off Ratcatcher’s blade. Focus on cleaning the blade. Don't freak out, *clean.* I confined the panic to my chest, as I rephrased the question, “When you had Briar go after him-”

“Not then. I just knew he was human once. Didn't realize he shared your blood, at the time.”

“How do I help him?”

He shrugged a shoulder. I could tell by that damned smirk he knew more than he was letting on, but of course, the bastard was content to keep it to himself. 

“Some help you are!” I grumbled.

I wanted to cry. But not in front of him. He was the last person I wanted to break down in front of. 

However, he'd pry those tears out of me soon enough. 

Trying to keep the hell I was feeling trapped within me, I darted outside, barely feeling the weight of the sword in my hand. The whispering thing shrank back. 

It used to have six legs, including the sharp, folded appendages on the front of its thorax. One of its hind legs was missing, making its movements jerky. I could see deep scars along its body, not unlike the scratches that were still healing from when Briar's thorns dug into my flesh two weeks back. He'd done a number on the whispering thing. 

But of course, the whispering thing couldn't die. The Muse wouldn't let him. No matter what Briar or anyone else had done to it. No. Not *it. Him.*

*They shouldn't have this much power.*

As I looked at my grandfather, contorted into something that nobody would've recognized as human in a million years, I grimly wondered if I was looking into a mirror. 

*Is this my future?*

Mouth dry once again, I put Ratcatcher into its scabbard on my belt, approaching him slowly, hand raised to show him I didn't mean him harm. One eye faced towards me, the other tilted towards the house, most likely watching for the mechanic. 

“I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.” I started, meaning it as I pulled out the wedding photo again. “She never remarried, you know? Even though the *leannán sídhe* tried to make her forget, I think she still had a sense that something was missing. That's probably why she hid this. It must've been hard for her.”

I tried to focus on the whispers floating around us. 

*‘Tried to leave… tried to leave… I can't breathe… Ciara… Ciara… Was she happy…’*

Ciara was my grandmother's name. 

“Grandma lived to be almost a hundred years old.” I muttered, then nodded. “I think she was happy. She was always there for Mom and I.”

*‘...Wouldn't let me die… Wanted to… Want to see her again… Let me die…’*

This was all too much. A painful lump rose in my throat that refused to go away no matter how many times I swallowed. The squeezing in my chest became unbearable. 

“How do I help you?” I asked quietly, the ache in my throat making my voice raspy. 

*‘...Release me…’*

A voice on the wind. A voice I'd know anywhere. A soothing balm to the torment surrounding me. Deirdre. 

The whispering thing's head turned towards it. I couldn't see where she was, but he seemed to. He started to hobble deeper into the woods.

The door opened behind me, reigniting the panic anew as I heard Iolo laugh darkly, “Oh, *caoineadh,* ain't you precious?”

I couldn't understand why Deirdre was taking this risk, trying to guide a lost soul right in front of Iolo. What was she thinking?! 

It didn't matter. I had to buy her time. 

Without giving myself even a second to overthink, I drew Ratcatcher at the same time as I turned towards the mechanic, knowing I was most likely going to get my ass handed to me. No kidding. 

He took a step back, narrowing his eyes as the sword whizzed harmlessly past him. I then held the tip of Ratcatcher to his throat, only an inch away from his skin. He didn't even flinch, those hazel eyes boring into mine as I saw his flesh turning pink just from the blade's proximity. 

“She can have him.” He said, the coldness in his voice making the hair on the back of my neck stand up. “But it'll cost her. And you if you don't put that thing away.”

“Cost her what?” 

His smile was a threat, “That's for her to worry about, not you. Now, you best get that fuckin’ sword outta my face.”

“Don't tell me what I can and can't worry about.”

“Why do you care so much for her, pup?” His eyes scanned me. “You're not fallin’ for her, are you?”

“You don't have to be in love with someone to care about them.” 

“Avoidin’ the question, puppydog.” His mocking demeanor didn't downplay the warning. “You *know* I hate that.”

“I'm not. It's the truth. I care about a lot of people. But I suppose something like you wouldn't be able to understand that.”

I had a feeling that'd annoy him, and I knew he was going to do his best to make me regret it. I took a step back and slashed where I thought he was going to go, but unfortunately, I'm not as skilled at anticipating others’ movements as he is. Ratcatcher hit empty air. 

My heart stopped when his breath tickled my ear, “*So close!”*

With a yell that was supposed to sound like a battle cry but in reality was somewhat pathetic, I spun, the sword finding nothing once again. Chest heaving, my eyes darted around. I checked the reflection in the blade. He wasn't behind me this time. Where the hell was he?!

He flicked my shoulder playfully. I didn't bother trying to swing at him again. He wouldn't be there. 

On the bright side, I had him distracted. He didn't appear to have any intention of following them and thankfully, he wasn't questioning me about Deirdre anymore. Iolo seems like the jealous type. I could imagine that his envious side was just as bad, if not worse, than the Muse’s. 

Was that movement to my right? No. He was toying with me. So where was he actually going to come from? Behind me? Wrong again. *Shit.*

Deirdre’s song sounded as if it was traveling further away. Guiding my grandfather towards wherever he belonged. I hoped it was with Grandma. 

Quicker than I could process, Iolo had wrestled me to the ground, the world spiraling as he rolled on top of me. The sword flew from my hand as my back hit the dirt, knocking the wind out of me. When he wrapped his injured hand around my throat, I dug my thumb into the wound, feeling blood and slimy, dead skin clump beneath my nail. This elicited a sharp hiss from him, but instead of flinching like I'd hoped, he seized my wrist, pinning it over my head, followed by the other one.  

His voice was frighteningly calm as he whispered, “You ever train a dog before?”

I thrashed, teeth gritted, trying to buck him off. 

“Sometimes, if ya give the dog a little too much leeway, it walks all over you. Forgets who's boss. Bites ya. You know what ya do to a dog that bites?” 

*Bad. This is bad.*

“You said yourself that you like it when I fight you!” I argued, a mortifying, desperate shake to my voice.  

“What do you to a dog that bites?” He asked slowly, still so chillingly calm as he brought my wrists together so that he could restrain them with one hand. The other came down to squeeze my jaw. Hard. 

*Shit!* My breath caught as terror overtook me. I squirmed beneath him, unable to remove the vice cupping my chin. 

“You muzzle it.” 

“Wait! *Wait! Please!”* I screamed, the fear making my whole body shake. *“Please!”*

Iolo's grip didn't loosen, his fingers continuing to dig painfully into my jaw. For an eternity, I held my eyes shut. For an eternity, the only sound was my labored breathing. For an eternity, I waited for my bones to *snap.* 

Several lifetimes later, Iolo finally whispered, “You may be a biter, puppydog, but at least now you know how to beg.” 

His weight disappeared, leaving me acutely aware of my jawbone, the ghost of his fingertips still digging into it. Tears flowed freely from my eyes then, completely against my will as my chest heaved. 

“You need a ride back to your car?” Iolo asked casually. 

Fuck. *Fuck!* 

“Yes.” I sputtered. “Just… give me a minute.”

Silently, I added, *‘You fucking cunt.’* 

It took a solid minute for me to calm down. The night replayed in my head over and over. The Muse degrading me. Finding and losing Grandpa within five minutes. Iolo kissing me. My bright future of being a tool of the Hunt. His fingers bruising my chin. 

*‘I'm countin’ on her to fight me ‘til the very end.’*

The only thing I could think of to do to release the mixture of shock, anger, terror, and loss was scream. It reverberated back to me through the trees as if the forest itself was echoing the sentiment. At that point, I didn't give a shit if Iolo heard it. That scream had been bubbling up within me, so intensely volatile that if I hadn't let it out, I’m fairly confident I would've lost my mind right then and there. 

The part of me that pathetically clung on to optimism tried to assure me that I've already hurt Iolo before using the tricks *he* taught me. I can hurt him again. 

But the life debt. That mother*fucking* life debt! It hovered over my head like the blade of a guillotine. 

To say I was freaking out would be an understatement. 

My mind went somewhere else. My body did the rest. It picked up Ratcatcher, placing it into its sheath. It silently walked me out to the truck. It was relieved when Iolo didn't bring up the scream, the kiss, or anything else. It got behind the wheel of the Jeep and drove me home. 

It's nice to have a body that can work without me. 

Deirdre was waiting for me. She didn't say a word. Just hugged me. 

I came back into my body then. It had done a good job, but it couldn't be the only one that got to enjoy that slightly-too-tight hug that Deirdre specialized in. 

“What happened?” She asked delicately, the embrace ending far too quickly for my liking. 

“My Grandpa.” I replied, feeling my eyes become wet again. “Is he safe?”

“The woman in the wedding photo was waiting for me to bring him to her.” She assured me gently, her thumb brushing a tear from my cheek. 

*It wasn't all for nothing. He's free.*

As much as I wanted to revel in this good news, I was too scared for her and for me. Iolo had said that her intervention would ‘cost her.’ And while I'd kept him from questioning me too much about her, there wasn't a doubt in my mind the topic would come up again. 

That was when I did something I warned yinz not to do: “Thank you. For everything.”

“It's I that should thank you.” She soothed, brushing another tear away. “I wouldn't be here without you. I’d still be confined to the river.”

Deirdre isn't like the mechanic or the Muse. She didn't take advantage of my admission to her, just as I knew she wouldn't. 

I've grown to trust her so much. Hopefully, not too much.  

I swallowed, attempting to get ahold of myself, and failing, “The mechanic. He… He might try to hurt you.”

Deirdre’s expression did not change, assuring me, “Let me worry about that. You have your own troubles. Don't take on mine. I knew very well what I was getting into.”

“If I lose you-”

She interrupted me, gently tilting my face down to gaze into her eyes, “Even the Huntsman has rules he must follow. He can reprimand me, but he can't kill me. You *won't* lose me. Now, stop being a mule and leave my troubles to me.”

A mule? The absurdity of it made me crack up. In retrospect, it wasn't that funny, but… it had been a long night. 

What's worse? I'd still have to return to him the next night and the night after that. I am bound to him until I can find some way to rid myself of that damned life debt. Or he makes me join the Hunt in some form or another. 

In other, better news, we do have two new hires. Both of them have read these posts, so they're pretty well aware of what they're walking into. At least, I think they are, but time will tell. 

Due to my situation, Victor will primarily be taking on the responsibility of training them, much to his chagrin. It's nothing against either of them; his social battery is just permanently drained. 

The first new Orion employee, Wes, isn't human, but that shouldn't be an issue. Most people around here are accustomed to looking the other way when it comes to the atypical. Generally speaking, as long as the guy with eyes that reflect the light doesn't bring trouble, they're happy campers. Others around here appear to be good at convincing themselves that there is a ‘perfectly reasonable explanation’ for why the new pest control guy needs to be invited in before entering their residences. 

Before the poor guy could even say ‘hello,’ Victor put him on the spot, looking pointedly at Reyna, “See, *that's* a vampire. Not me.”

Reyna slowly scanned the new hire from head to toe, then frowned at Vic as she jokingly asked, “Is there an upcoming height requirement to working here I should know about?”

Wes just nodded slowly, looking as if he were trying to suppress a laugh, “Nice to meet all of you, too.”

He seems alright enough, though I haven't had much time to get to know him well. Regardless, Victor wants to keep a close eye on him to ensure he's got control over himself, at least for the first few weeks. Last thing we need is a lawsuit because an employee bit a client.

Our other new hire, Cerri, came a few days later once she finished out her two weeks at some retail hellhole. What does it say about her last job that working at a place where employees are routinely threatened by Neighbors is preferable to her? 

As far as I know, she's human and to Reyna's relief, under six feet tall. 

When she first met the boss, Cerri did try to stand up straighter in front of Victor when she shook his hand, giving him a smile refined by years of customer service. 

Before her on-boarding, she did admit to me that she's a bit intimidated by him, so to break the ice a bit, I decided to do what I do best and annoy him. I rubbed two fingers together and called him like a cat: “*Pspspspsps!*”

His hand still in Cerri's, he slowly turned to stare at me like he was trying to blow me up with his mind. 

The stunt got me sent back to the Super 8 to deal with their most recent infestation (human fleas), but it was worth it. She seems a bit less skittish around him and I got to indulge in my favorite hobby of being a nuisance to my boss. 

As far as my situation goes, I must admit that I don't have a plan yet. We’ve all been digging and have not found a surefire way to get out of a life debt yet. That being said, I (mostly) freed the Weeper. I freed my grandpa. I imagine that I must be capable of freeing myself as well. 

I have until Samhain. Roughly two months to figure this out. 

I'm not giving up. None of us are.
