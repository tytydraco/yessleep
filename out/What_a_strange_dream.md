I have severe sleep paralysis and I always have hallucinations of demons, normally they last for about 5 minutes and I wake up in a sweat screaming to my mum.

I went to school as usual, with an abundance of homework and I normally hang out in the library trying to finish it off but I was in a hurry since I had to get a new prescription for imipramine (sleep paralysis drugs). I got on the bus and headed to the pharmacy where I got my pills which my doctor prescribed me as my hallucinations were getting more vivid and intense. It took around 35 minutes to get back to my house since we were quite isolated and were living on the outskirts of town, I pulled out my keys and unlocked the door.

My family were already home, I had two sisters who moved out and lived with my mum and step dad since my original dad died of unknown causes. Dinner was already ready as I sat down and ate it, my mum was weirdly quiet as she just looked down and silently ate her food. I didn’t think much of it as I went up to my room and finished off the rest of my homework, by the time I was done the sun was going off into the horizon and I decided to get some early shuteye. When I was in that state of dozing off I woke up to hear my mum and step dad arguing as usual and managed to block out there shouting and went to sleep, I woke up in a fit of sweat but I couldn’t move a muscle realising I was in a trance. 

I tried my best to stay calm and wait for my demons to come but I couldn’t see anyone until a black figure came from the corner of my room, I tried to let out of a scream but I couldn’t as all I could do was just watch as this figure came closer. It made a human appearance until I could make out a woman with red eyes and an inhumane smile, it was holding a wet blade and her clothes were stained. I realised it was blood and I tried to move but I could not move at all, this woman went closer as she started to resemble something quite familiar .. my mum…

She started chanting something in a demonic laughter and her smile grew wider as she was now looking straight at me, I could scream all I could do was cry as tears trickled on my ridged face. I could now make up what she was saying ‘an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth’ she looked at me hysterically as my eyes were watering and my eyes moving around anywhere but my mum if I could call here that. When I thought it was never gonna stop she slowly faded away as I snapped into reality and could finally move, I started crying in outrage as my actual mum came running in.

She asked me what was wrong but before I did I realised her hand was red and when she but my hand on my shoulder a red mark was left, I looked up at her and asked ‘’Mum, where’s stepdad?” She looked at me with a slight insane look “Oh sweetie he’s just gone to join your dad.” My eyes widened as my mum started to smile like in my trance, I nervously asked her “What have you done to step dad?” Her smile grew wider almost impossibly large as she replied “He just joined your daddy sweet heart, you know what they an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”. She grabbed my shoulder as my screams echoed through the house, my body was never found and my mum was never caught for what happened but too this day it is one of the most coldest cases in the world~the end
