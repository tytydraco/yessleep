A wee bit twisted, eh? Throwing some poor lad to the waves for him to be dragged down to the darkest recesses of the ocean, just to appease some eldritch deity. Well, you’d be right. And I can assure you firsthand, it’s much worse than you think…   
  
I’ve lived in this town my whole life. Most of us have, really. But then again, we don’t have much of a say in the matter. You see, something tethers us to this town. Something downright sinister. We can all feel it. This place… it exudes an air of malevolence that I can’t begin to describe. It’s as if a black cloud is constantly looming overhead, leaving us all with a feeling of impending doom. At least, that’s how it’s been as of late. Because twenty-four hours ago, we were supposed to send a young man to his demise.   
  
In all honesty, I shouldn’t even be telling you this. It’s an unspoken rule here that we don’t discuss our burden with outsiders. The less people who know, the better. So, then, why am I sharing this with you, you might ask? The answer is simple. I fear that soon, my home will no longer exist.   
  
I’ve lived in this little seaside village off the coast of Ireland for nearly seven decades. I’m not going to share its name with you for reasons that will soon become obvious. It’s safer this way.   
  
As previously stated, no one from this town is allowed to leave. There are around forty of us; most families have lived here for generations, but we do get the occasional drifter intending to pass through. That’s where the trouble lies - once anyone sets foot in this village, they’re stuck here forever. That’s okay, though. Outsiders usually act as our martyrs.   
  
So why do we do this? After generations upon generations, why do we still engage in such an arcane ritual?  
  
We don’t have a choice.   
  
This creature. This, deity - it controls the weather. The last time my ancestors failed to complete the sacrifice almost two centuries ago, it is said that a great storm nearly destroyed the entire town, costing dozens their lives.   
  
We call the thing Poseidon. None of us believe in Greek mythology, but it seems fitting due to its abilities. Now, don’t get me wrong. We don’t worship this abomination. No, on the contrary. The majority of us abhor it. Most of the townsfolk harbor a deep-seated resentment for the loved ones it’s taken from us.   
  
Now that you understand our reasons, I’ll explain what happened yesterday. And why I know that we’ve angered our malevolent protector.   
  
The sky was dark, angry black cumulonimbus clouds swirling menacingly above us. The ocean churned and writhed, indicating a brewing storm. A lump formed in my throat as I spared a glance at my comrades.   
  
The entire town was in attendance. The elders didn’t require us to show up, but it would feel wrong to miss it. Twenty years. One quick ceremony, and we wouldn’t have to worry about this for twenty more prosperous years. At least, that was what was supposed to happen.   
  
“Harold, I’m scared,” my wife whispered, shattering the silence.   
  
I slipped my hand into hers, interlocking our fingers. “It’ll be alright, Nora. We can make it through this. Be strong for me, yeah?”   
  
She gazed up at me, her fearful demeanor melting into one of steely resolve.   
  
“For you, anything.”   
  
I kissed Nora’s forehead and gave her hand a squeeze. I turned my attention back to the dock, where a young man was struggling against his restraints. A pang of guilt stabbed my chest like a lightning bolt. My heart truly shattered for him. He’d shown up a mere four days prior. Had he appeared just a week later, he wouldn’t be the one to lose his life.   
  
A sharp scream tore me from my reverie. The man’s gag had been lowered from his face, and he was shrieking at the top of his lungs. I remember thinking that he sounded a bit feminine, but I brushed it off. We just needed a biological male to sacrifice. He would do just fine.   
  
The O’Connell twins tightened their grasp on the wailing man’s arms. Those boys are tall as they are strong. With enough pressure, the man stopped squirming. The next part of the ritual still fascinates me.   
  
I watched as Pastor Murphy approached the man. He extended his palm, displaying a fine white powder. Before the man could react, he blew it into his face. He coughed violently before going completely rigid. I could see the panic drain from his expression as his eyes glazed over.   
  
The pastor made the sign of the cross, then clasped his hands together and closed his eyes. He calmly opened them and outstretched his arms toward the sky, gazing at the roiling clouds above.   
  
“Poseidon! Take this sacrifice and grant us peace and prosperity!”   
  
He turned to the glassy-eyed young man before him and pointed to a small fishing boat bobbing beside him in the surf. “You will take this boat and paddle toward the horizon. You will only stop when a creature presents itself from the deep. Rest well, my son. Your judgment day has arrived.” A harsh wind swept in as soon as he finished his statement.   
  
The man didn’t so much as nod. He simply hoisted himself into the boat and began to row out into the sea.   
  
We watched in bewilderment as the man grew further and further away. Other than his blond hair swaying in the breeze and his arms forcing the vessel forward, he was completely stiff. His movements resembled those of an animatronic, lifeless and taut. Whatever they give to the martyrs, that stark white powder, to this day, I have no clue what it’s composed of. And I don’t think I want to find out.   
  
Each denizen of the town waited with baited breath for the moment we all dreaded. Suddenly, when the little boat was nearly a football field away, it happened. Dozens of writhing, pitch-black tendrils emerged from the water, rising high above the helpless vessel. Each was at least two stories tall, extending from an unfathomably large, dark mass rising from the depths.   
  
Nora buried her face into my chest. “Please, don’t make me watch. I can’t stand to see this,” she cried, tears streaming down her cheeks. I tenderly pulled her closer, never once peeling my eyes away from the beast.   
  
One of the tentacles gently tapped the man on the head as if deciding whether he would be sufficient. It began to wrap itself around the boat, slithering closer and closer to its prey. I breathed an audible sigh of relief. It was almost over. Just one swift motion, and we would be spared for another twenty years.   
  
But that’s not what happened.   
  
Instead of dragging the man down to the murky depths, the appendage released its grasp. Then, with one fell swoop, it crashed down atop the fishing boat, smashing it to smithereens, and leaving its occupant floating face-down in the water. Gasps and shrieks erupted among the crowd as the tentacles submerged themselves once more.   
  
My eyes grew wide as Nora traced my gaze. Her face went ghostly white when she realized what had occurred. This had never happened. Throughout the centuries upon centuries of sacrificial offerings made to the creature, our gift had never once been rejected.   
  
We tried sending out another. One of our own, this time. His name was John, and he went willingly. Such a brave soul.   
  
We again watched as the young man proceeded to the spot from which the monster had risen. The spot where the wreckage still drifted among the rough waters. Then, he waited… And waited. But nothing came.   
  
All the while, the sky grew darker, until it was almost black as night. Once it became evident that we would not have a chance at redemption, Pastor Murphy signaled John to return. The crowd had all dispersed by that point. They were preparing for the worst - fortifying houses, gathering food and water, ensuring that they had all their arrangements in order in case devastation struck.   
  
Though the winds were ferocious and rain began to sprinkle down, I didn’t move an inch. Pastor Murphy and I were the only ones left on the dock when John rowed back to us. We hoisted him from the boat as it rocked violently back and forth. John’s face was sullen - defeated. The lot of us stood there in silence. We could smell death creeping up on the horizon. Every second was precious, yet we couldn’t bring ourselves to leave. Until John spoke.   
  
“I’m sorry. I couldn’t recover the body. But I did find this,” he said, extending a waterlogged wallet. Inside were two driver’s licenses. They both bore the name Aidan Conors. One depicted a man with short, blonde hair, while the other, evidently much older and faded with age, showed a woman with long flowing locks smiling back at us.   
  
That was yesterday. Nora and I are barricaded in the church along with several others. Our home likely won’t withstand the storm. Rain has been relentlessly pounding the village. I can hear the wind howling outside as I type. I don’t know if we’ll make it out of this alive. I can only pray that Poseidon will take mercy on us.   
  
But for the sins we have committed, I’m not so sure that we’re worthy [to be spared.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)
