“Well, this is officially the worst zoo ever.” announced Cynthia, as we passed an enclosure with a lonely monkey swinging back and forth between two branches.



I don’t even remember who suggested stopping at the little roadside zoo, after we saw the rusty sign by the highway, but we were all here, spending the first day of our supposed camping trip looking at depressed animals.



Our friend group consisted of five people. Cynthia and her boyfriend, Greg, our mutual friend, Christine, my girlfriend Julie, and I. The trip was supposed to be a late celebration of completing our finals, but it was seemingly doomed from the start.



The zoo was a sad excuse of one. Before the monkey, we saw a lion lying on the concrete beside a wall of his cage, a slim bear walking in circles, some zebras standing lethargically in the mud, an aviary, that had parrots with some plucked feathers, screaming at anyone who walked by, and a supposed reptile house which had an iguana with broken spikes in a terrarium that seemed too small for the thing to even turn around comfortably, a snake curled up in a corner, and the ugliest looking frog I’ve ever seen in my life, poking its eyes out from the water in an otherwise empty aquarium.



“Maybe this will help,” pointed Greg at a sign.

“ ‘Dinosaur kingdom! Giants of a lost world!’. Yeah, it’ll be epic.” -I groaned.

“I mean, it can’t be much worse than the previous stuff.”

“I guess”



We entered the area, walking through a gate, which was obviously a Jurassic Park ripoff, and were immediately greeted by a surprisingly well-made sculpture, positioned to look like it is running through the woods to get us.



“ ‘Allosaurus. This fierce predator lived in the Jurassic era, and it was known for preying upon creatures much bigger than itself, by ripping chunks out of them, using its strong neck muscles.’.” Greg read the sign planted at the feet of the allosaurus.

“What a cool guy.”

“Hey, I think he’s kinda cute. -Julie punched my arm playfully.”

“Yeah, especially if he was alive. Those knife sized teeth would be real adorable.”

“Okay, smartass, then check out this one! -Julie pulled me towards the next statue.”

“This isn’t even a dinosaur, but I’ll admit, he’s cute.” I looked at the derpy-looking giant plastic frog.

“ ‘Beelzebufo. The largest frog ever.’. “

“Cool.”



Other than this, the section ended up having a wonky triceratops, a stegosaurus with broken plates, a T. rex, one of those flying things, and a mammoth for some reason. We exited the zoo after looking at the allosaurus one last time, while leaving the “Dinosaur Kingdom”. It was really in a good shape compared to the other statues with peeling paint and broken parts.

“They probably installed it later.” said Cynthia.

“Maybe.” answered Greg.



The entrance of the zoo soon grew smaller and smaller in the mirror of my ancient Suzuki. The next hours went by slowly, as our car joined the others on the highway, every people in their own miniature universe, forming a never-ending line of vehicles, all going in one direction, like some strange fish school in a grey sea, surrounded by green, and the yellows of fall creeping in.



We spoke about meaningless things. Julie, ever so worrying, asked me for the fiftieth time if I packed the tents. Later, Greg followed up, wanting to know if anyone bought coffee.

“Babe, you know I have some energy drinks.” Cynthia snuggled him in the back seat.

“Yeah, and you know I hate those.”

“Well, more for me. -teased Cyn playfully.”

Some time after we spoke about our exams, and then I started a rather boring game of barkochba. But at last, our exit came, an open mouth of the forest, and I drove right in, leaving the school of cars.



Soon, we were bouncing around in our seats along dirt roads, while the engine roared like a dying dragon. That poor old car clearly wasn’t built for this.



“Okay, you can stop! This is the spot, I recognize it." Greg tapped my shoulder as we were driving by a small clearing.

“So, you’re sure there won’t be anyone around? No rangers telling us to fuck off? No kids yelling six in the morning? No teens sneaking around at night trying to find a quiet spot?”

“Yeah, you pretty much summarized it perfectly.”

“And how do you know of this spot exactly?” asked Julie.

“Uncle Tom showed me.”

“Isn’t he the conspiracy theorist, who was in jail once? Were you coming to search for bigfoot, or what?”

Greg blushed like a tomato, then a really quiet “yes” left his mouth.

“B-but I was like six. And I can’t deny, we heard a really strange roar or something.”

“Yeah, uncle Tommy probably ate too much beans for lunch.” -I added, and everyone burst out laughing.

“Okay, you got a point. But still, it’s a good spot for camping” -said Greg after the last chuckles stopped.

“Well, I suppose bigfoot tearing us apart is still better than moaning teens beside the tent at 1 A.M.” -Said Cynthia as she pulled out her backpack from the trunk.

 

We unpacked and set up our tents by the end of the clearing under the first trees. By the time we finished, the sun was setting, bleeding orange stripes on the grass.



After the tents were set, we immediately went to sleep. The car ride was more tiring than it should’ve been. Right before I fell asleep, a deep, bellowing sound echoed from outside. We looked at each other with Julie, and then I yelled “Very funny, Greg!”. There was no answer.



Morning came with chirping birds and golden sunrays that were slowly but noticeably grew weaker by the day. Our breath formed small clouds, disappearing nearly instantly, but still there.

“Fall’s sure coming early this year.” said Julie, while she snuggled me in her sweater.

“Yeah. But this is the best hiking weather. Still warm enough during the day, but not too hot.” I said as I snuggled her back.

Greg and Cynthia did the same on the other side of our campfire. After we finished breakfast and warmed up, we packed our backpacks and followed Greg into the forest, on a trail, which seemed more like an animal track than a proper hiking trail.



Most of the morning was normal. The landscape seemed untouched, and had a wild beauty. Trees towered above us, dark green moss covered their bark like an old jacket. Small, unnamed creeks ran through the woods, their splashing mixed with the chirping birds above. Squirrels were jumping around between the branches like tiny acrobats. A deer disappeared into the forest, startled by our footsteps.



But at some point, everything started changing slowly. The birds went silent for longer and longer periods of time. The squirrels retreated into the top of their trees. A sunbathing lizard scurried under the leaf litter on the ground, without any warning signs. Some time later Cynthia stopped.

“Don’t you guys feel like we’re getting watched?” she whispered.

Julie and I exchanged looks. We didn’t speak about it, but I sensed her getting more and more nervous, and I felt the same. But before we could answer, Greg let out an annoyed laugh.

“Told you not to drink the second can of Monster.”

“For the love of God Greg, they are energy drinks, not fucking drugs. I’m not gonna hallucinate because of caffeine.” Cnythia burst out.

“Don’t be hard on her. I feel it too.” said Julie silently.

“Yeah, me too.” I said.

“Fine. Sorry. But I didn’t notice anything.” Greg closed the subject, but the anxious sparks in his eyes told otherwise. Maybe he didn’t want to sound paranoid after the bigfoot fiasco of the previous day.



At that point, we left it at that, but we walked closer to each other after that. At some point in the afternoon, Julie grabbed my arm.

“Can we turn back?”

The forest was silent. For hours. And on rare occasions, it sounded like branches were breaking around us.

“Yeah.” I grabbed her shoulder.

“Guys, I don’t know about you, but we’re turning back.” I said.

“What? But we’re minutes away from one of the best spots.” Greg stopped in his tracks.

“Sorry, but I don’t care. This place is creeping me out. I don’t know what is here, but I’m starting to think your uncle Tommy wasn’t as much of a lunatic as I thought.”

“What do you think, babe?” Turned Greg towards Cynthia.

“We’re turning back as well. Now.” She said, looking him deep in the eye.

Greg let out a long sigh. “Fiiiine.”



The silent trees watched as we turned back the way we came. For hours, we walked in nearly complete silence. Then, the clicking noises started. They came from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. We glanced around nervously, but none of us could find the source of the sound. Well, all of us, except Greg. He walked, looking at the trail in front of his feet, still pretending that everything’s fine. The clicks filled everything. Except they weren’t really clicks. Now they sounded more like someone rhythmically knocking on a hardwood table.

“Donn’t they sound like they’re getting closer?” asked Julie silently after like half an hour.

“I don’t know honey.” I tried to sound indifferent with not much success.

Cynthia was silently crying, while hanging on to Greg’s arm like a drowning man to the last straw.

“Either way, we should hurry.” said Greg. He sounded defeated.

 

Another hour passed, and I asked the quiet question, that everyone’s been thinking.

“Are we… going in the right direction? I could swear I already saw that rock three times.”

“I don’t know. I can’t concentrate with this knocking.” Greg started to sound scared. This was not good.

“But, what should we do then?”



Before anyone could answer, Julie screamed. We jumped like springs, then all eyes followed her shaking arm, pointing into the woods. Something stood there. Something large. And motionless.



“I-I can’t believe. This can’t be.” I could only whisper as I stared at the dinosaur standing between two trees.



It was big, green like pine leaves, with white spots on its back. Yellow eyes fixated on us, and yet, motionless as a statue. A very familiar statue in fact. Allosaurus.



The seconds grew into minutes as we stared at the beast. It was clearly alive, I could see its chest moving with every breath, but it was still frozen in place.



“The hell should we do now?” Cnythia was surprisingly calm, considering she was on the verge of hysteria even before the dinosaur. Maybe the absurdity of the situation calmed her somehow.

“Walk away. Slowly.” I was surprised by the rationality in my own voice.



As I took the first step, the clicking continued. The allosaurus’ throat vibrated, as it produced the sound. Then it started growling in a deep, guttural sound. It lowered its head and stared at us, the deep growl bellowing between the branches.   



That sound. It awakened something in me. Some little, mouselike creature buried under millions of years of evolution in my DNA screamed at me to run. Run and hide. It’s not my time. It is the time of the giant lizard, and being out in the open means certain death. I resisted. The dinosaur still stood there, baring its teeth, and growling like a mad dog.



Greg broke first. He bolted into the woods, dragging the screaming Cynthia with him. This was enough for me. I glanced at Julie and saw that same primal fear mirrored on her face. The moment we started running, a triumphant roar echoed behind us, and we heard the leaves rustle and the branches break as the allosaurus launched after its prey. Us.



I ran. I heard Julie beside me, and the allosaurus after us. Branches crashed into my face, and thorns tore into my arms, but I kept running. The voice of survival screamed DANGER in my head, and I didn’t know anything else. I didn’t know who was the woman running besides me. I didn’t know who I was, or what I was. I just knew that there’s a dragon behind me, and I only have one chance at survival.



I don’t know how long we run, or what direction, but at one point, a clearing appeared. There was no hiding place in sight. I had no choice. I burst out from the trees, like a gazelle, nearly feeling the teeth of the lion sinking into its body. The shock of seeing my car dragged me back into reality. One last sprint, while frantically searching for my keys, and then, me and Julie finally got pulled out of the Jurassic era, and back into the present, where no dinosaur should still roam the Earth.



The engine screamed to life, and at that moment, the allosaurus emerged from the woods. It stopped on the clearing, staring at the car. I saw its eyes. It knew it lost. A roar tore the air apart and the beast made one last attempt to reach us. I lost control again. The growl was just a warmup compared to this. My brain didn’t scream danger this time. It yelled CERTAIN DEATH. Julie was stiff beside me, like a deer in the headlights.



The allosaurus sniffed the air, then slowly started walking towards the car. Its mouth opened, ivory teeth making high contrast with the pink gums and purple tongue. Saliva dripped on the windshield as the dinosaur lowered its head, looking right at us.



Then, it suddenly turned. Two figures appeared from the trees. They stopped on the clearing for a moment, turning their heads around, like they’re noticing their surroundings just now. The allosaurus left the car, and started running towards them, its hind legs working like pistons. The spell broke again.

 

I stepped on the gas so hard, that I thought the pedal will break, but the engine roared, and we sped to the dirt road, bouncing like a rodeo bull, tires kicking up mud, engine lights glowing up. A quiet growl echoed from the forest.

 

I’m writing this from a gas station. Julie is in the bathroom, trying to pull herself back together. I have no idea what to do now. I can’t stop thinking about Greg and Cynthia. We left them there. We should go back. But I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to set foot in any forest again.
