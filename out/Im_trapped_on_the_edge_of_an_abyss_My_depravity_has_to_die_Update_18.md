The world was mute as I drove home that day.

I couldn’t hear the rumble of my tires on the road outside. I couldn’t hear the hum of the car’s AC gently fanning my numb face. I didn’t hear any cars honking or dogs barking or birds singing at all as I pulled back into our apartments and stepped out of my vehicle. My car door slammed, but I didn’t hear that either.

Really, the only sensation I had was touch. I could feel every movement, but not on the outside. It was all within. The ache of my legs as I pressed the weight of my body onto them. The sting in my arms as I shut the door and pulled out my keys. For a little under a full year, I had been living with the steadily growing pain. Dismissing it as poor diet or neglect to stay in shape. Anything but the truth that I knew it could actually be.

Now, though, I felt it. The slightest movements that brought on the sting couldn’t be neglected anymore. They were everywhere. Like poison in my veins pumping into every crevasse I didn’t even know I had. My chest as it expanded with my breath. My hips as I sat in my car. My spine when I pivoted even slightly.

I didn’t hear the jingle of my keys as I pulled them out of my pocket.

I didn’t hear the sound of the door unlatching as I tugged it open. I felt the ache in my wrist though.

I didn’t hear Trevor’s voice greeting me from the kitchen, and I didn’t hear him saying my name to get my attention until I was in the dining area staring vacantly at the surface of the table, and he had said it about five times.

“Hensley?”

Like a crack of thunder, the world fell back into place. Sound rushed back into my ears, the scent of Trevor’s cooking flooded my nose, and the pain in my body fell to background static for only a moment.

Only a moment, chased away by Trevor’s smile.

It was uneasy, and he cocked his head with concern, “Everything okay?”

My face was pale and gave me away, but I lied anyway, “Oh, uh, yeah. I’m fine.”

“You sure?” He said, stirring the pot on the stove one more time before setting the ladle off and moving toward me, “You didn’t answer my question.”

“Oh, sorry. Uh… what was it?”

“How was your doctor’s appointment? You went today, right?”

I felt my throat hitch, and the world threatened to fall away again, leaving me with the pain. You’d think for all the silence I had while driving home, and all the time I had with it, I could have mentally prepared for this conversation better. I guess part of me had hoped that Trevor would have forgotten and just not asked, but I should have known better. He’d been telling me to go for months, and asking about my day was always his first priority.

I didn’t know what to tell him yet, so all I could do was try to delay the inevitable. Put it off and hope he didn’t ask more questions, “Oh, um, yeah, it was. It was good. Everything is good.”

He saw right through, or maybe he didn’t. Maybe he was just being his usual, concerned self, “Well, what did they say? Did they figure out what that pain was all about? Did the tests come back?”

I knew there was no skirting around it. There was no easy way to get it out. My head was pounding, and my bones were aching, and I just didn’t have the energy to keep up my little charade. I stared at my boyfriend for a few seconds in silence, stone cold nothingness on my face before I plainly spoke.

“I have cancer, Trevor.”

I could see him wince, but his face was pure stunned silence. I winced too, but only internally. It sounded so ghastly to say it out loud. Like an ugly, disgusting burp. A forbidden curse that I’d just invoked.

The doctor, she tried to sugarcoat it. Let me down easy. Talk in that soft, professional tone.

“I’m so sorry, Ms. Blake, but your results came back and… Well, I’m afraid they’re not looking good. There were several small tumors we found in your x-rays—just below your hip in this area here—and after some further analysis…um… the tests you submitted last visit tell us that it's something we call chondrosarcoma. It’s hard to catch because it starts so slowly, and the symptoms might not be immediately apparent, so it’s something that you wouldn’t be remiss for not coming in over sooner, but… In layman’s terms, it’s a type of bone cancer. And… I’m very sorry to inform you that since its formation, it’s begun to spread rather quick—”

That’s when the silence started. Not in the last sentence, but just before. So many words were used just to get to that one important one: cancer.

I don’t get why there needed to be all the fluff. I don’t care how it got there. I don’t care how many times I could have caught it before or exactly what kind it is if it’s already begun spreading; all that mattered is the now.

I have cancer. And that really was the short of it.

So that’s what I told Trevor. Plain and simple in the way that I thought was better. The deafening silence and look on his face told me that maybe I was wrong, though. I could almost see the floor falling out from him. I could feel the sickness brewing in his gut.

Maybe there was no good way to break that news. Maybe no matter how you sliced it, no matter how many words you added or took away, that single key one was the gut punch. Maybe the only way to avoid that sting was to be a child again. A child sitting on your dad’s lap, not fully grasping the concept of what cancer was.

Trevor was silent for so long that it began making me uncomfortable, so I shifted nervously to lean against the table, placing a hand onto it to stabilize my spinning world. Trevor did the same to the counter, then finally made a sound.

“Oh…”

“Yeah…” I returned.

Hearing me croak out a pity response finally brought him back down, and he shook his head, “Is… Is it the same kind that your—”

“Yeah.” I politely cut him off.

“How bad?” he asked me, his eyes filling with liquid desperation, “I mean, what stage is it?”

I didn’t respond at first. I just pursed my lips and shook my head, the handsome boy blurring in my vision. I blinked the water away and hoped it was enough, but his denial was high, and he wasn’t going to guess until I answered.

“The ‘too-late’ kind of stage.” I muttered only loud enough for him to hear.

Unlike before, sound was everywhere now. I could hear the pot boiling on the stove and the steady tap of the kitchen sink dripping. I could hear the gentle buzz of the lightbulb above the dining table, and I could hear the ambience from the city outside leaking in. Even with all of that, the silence between us screamed the loudest.

I spaced out at some point looking at the floor, losing myself to the numbness before I felt warm, safe arms coil around me. He hadn’t even fully gripped my back before I lay into him with all my weight, finally letting the tears I was holding back fall loose into his shirt. He cried into my hair, and together we stood there like that. Floating in the eye of the storm for just a moment, both of us on the same page.

I wish it could have stayed like that. I wish that’s where the conversation ended for the night, and we simply ate dinner then went to bed. I could have reflected more on what was happening, and maybe I would have sorted it out in my head. Trevor kept talking though, and my panicked mind didn’t like hearing what he had to say.

“This is going to be okay. We’re going to get through this. It’s never too late, Hen… W-We’ll find you the best treatment we can; I don’t care what it costs. We’ll beat this thing.”

I shut my eyes and squeezed him tighter, shaking my head against his chest, “That’s not how it’s going to go, hun…”

“Yes it is, Hen.” He shushed me, “Even if it doesn’t work, we have to try.”

“No, Trevor—” I started, pulling away and wiping my eyes. I looked intensely into his, then spoke sternly, “I’m not going to do any treatment.”

Before, when I’d dropped the ‘C’ bomb on him, he’d had a confused shock on his face, but it was undercut with a heart-sunken tone. When I told him I wasn’t getting help, though, the only thing he wore was pure disbelief.

“What?” Was all he could say, furrowing his brow.

“I’m not going to do treatment, Trevor. I’m not going to spend the last years—or less— of my life rotting away in a bed just getting sicker. I won’t live in agony till I die.”

“Hen, you won’t die,” he said, grabbing the sides of my arms, “That’s the whole point of getting help—”

“You don’t know that,” I said, “Nobody knows that. Not even the doctors. They can try and try all they want, but they’re just going to tear up my body in the process to uproot it. I’d rather die this way than kicking and screaming.”

Trevor gave me that dumbfounded look again before scrunching his eyes shut and placing a hand to his head, “Hensley, what are you talking about? There’s nothing wrong with chemo—yeah, it’s rough, but it’s better than nothing. And if there’s a chance you might live, why not just take it?”

“You already said it yourself, Trevor,” I threw up my hands, “Whatever the cost, yeah, maybe, but how much can we *actually* afford before that cost is too much? I’m not going to bankrupt everyone I love just to wring a few more years out. I know I sure as hell can’t afford it. Besides, we’re not married—I’m not going to take *your* money for *my* health.”

“I don’t care, Hen. I’d sell the clothes on my back for another day with you.”

“I do care. And I’m not doing that to you. You or my Dad, or anyone else.”

I saw frustration begin to tense at his face, “So that’s it then? Everything you’ve ever worked toward—all the relationships you’ve built and kept over the years, you’re just going to throw that all away?”

“I’m not *throwing it away,*” I snapped back in offense, “I have no choice. This all ends one way and you know it.”

“No, we don’t! We don’t know unless we try, Hensley.”

“Unless *I* try, Trevor.” I corrected, “You wouldn’t be the one who has to go through it. That has to sit there and rot in a bed while your body eats itself alive.”

I saw him ease off a bit, staggering over his own insistence, “I-I know that, Hen. But I still have to be the one to watch you die if you don’t try. I know it’s hard on you—I’m not saying it’s not—but it feels like you’re not even considering the option at all. I can’t see you like this, Hen, it’d ruin me.”

“Oh, you think that would be bad, Trevor?” I hissed, leaning forward and making him wince back. I could see in his eyes that he was only scared and confused and trying to keep his heart from cracking in two, but his desperate words were striking at my own, and I’d only just begun piecing the damn thing back together since he came into my life. Instead of easing off, I doubled down and let my own fear and confusion fuel my blind charge forward.

“Have you ever seen what chemo does to a person whose already too far gone? Like what it *actually* does to them? It’s not just the frail little person withering away in a bed like they show in the movies—no, that’s too perfect. That’s the easier pill for the world to swallow. They never show how much agony they’re in. The way they scream and cry in the night because the pain is too much to bear. They don’t show the disgusting things the body starts doing when they can’t control their functions anymore—or the way they can’t remember their loved ones in those last days when the whole process inevitably fails and their body starts shutting down.”

Trevor stared misty-eyed at me, his gaze seeing more than my trembling words, but he didn’t interrupt.

“*That’s* what you’re going to see if I fight this. The messiest battle of my life, then a corpse at the end of it all. If you think that is somehow better than me just letting my body shut down on its own, then sure. I’ll do the stupid fucking treatment.”

He could sense by now that I was using my favorite defense mechanism. Lash out and hope that I get my way. It wasn’t the first time I’d done this, and he’d learned by now how to call my bluff. The issue was, it had never happened with this topic, and the next words he spoke were ones that I was not ready to hear.

“Is… this about your mom?” he asked softly. There was no malice in his voice, only gentle concern, “Hensley, I know what she went through was hell, and I’m not saying that it couldn’t turn out that way, but every case is different. Do you really think that if she were still here, she would want you to—”

“*Don’t*.” I warned, “She’s not here. So don’t you dare speak for her.”

I could see the words that he still had prepared fizzle in his open mouth, but after a moment, I could see the resentment toward my stubbornness boil over, and he lashed back at me with thrown up arms, “Well, what do you want me to say, Hensley? I don’t know what you want me to do—I’m not letting you go. You *know* that. So what can I possibly do to convince you to just think about this for more than five fucking seconds?”

“Nothing, Trevor!” I lashed back, hot, messy tears streaming down my cheeks now as the pain became too much, “I’m the one who has the cancer here, so it’s my fucking choice! If I want to die in peace just let me die in peace!”

“I never said it wasn’t your choice!” he yelled back, “I just thought that as the guy who wants to spend the rest of his life with you, you might value my opinion! I can’t do that with you if you’re dead, Hensley!”

Those words were the hammer that made my heart splinter into a million shards. We’d talked about our future many times before. Laying in bed late at night. During stargazing dates. One's like the one he’d taken me on when we first met. We had several things planned already; dream vacations, places to buy a house when we had enough money, where we wanted our wedding venue. If there was anyone on this planet that I could ever imagine myself spending forever with, it was Trevor, and though that thought was set in stone, in the face of this new variable, it all crumbled to dust.

I saw what losing Mom did to Dad. His loneliness. His inability to move on. I couldn’t imagine the pain he felt every night crawling into a cold bed knowing she wasn’t there. I couldn’t do that to Trevor. For some reason, he loved me, and I couldn’t let that love blow up in his face. Maybe it wouldn’t be forever, but even just taking a fraction of his life up with my memory was too much to bear. All those future goals weren’t going to happen now, and I couldn’t let him hold out hope.

The next thing I said was something very, *very* stupid.

“You’ll be fine, Trevor. You’ll move on. We’ve only been together for a year.”

I could see all of his anger turn to ice, freezing him still, then at once, it melted away in the form of tears from his eyes.  

“I really hope you don’t believe that…” he whispered, barely squeezing out the sound.

The way it rattled like broken china in his throat made a wash of clarity instantly pour over me. I was cooled off now, and in the cleanse of the rising steam it fully registered what I’d just spat out. It was too late, though. Once the sting of my words had fully ran through Trevor, he finally got fed up with my bullshit, and his despair gave way to resentment.

“*Only* a year, huh?” he scoffed with defeated disbelief, “I guess I’m sorry for thinking it meant more.”

I wanted to step forward and grab him. Catch his wrist as he turned to storm off and pull him back into my arms. Tell him how sorry I was, and that I didn’t mean it. That I was just scared and tired and angry and the world. That I didn’t know what to do with what I had been told that day.

But I didn’t.

I stood there, my pride and anger still holding me stiff, and I watched as Trevor turned away from me.

“The soup’s done.” He said plainly over his shoulder, “Take whatever you want.”

That was the last thing I ever got to hear him say. That simple sentence. That unemotional, unrelated phrase detached from anything that was just said. I hadn’t thought about it much at the time, but looking back now, it almost makes me tear up.

Even after everything we’d just said—even after the hurtful thing I’d just threw in his face—all he wanted to do was take care of me.

He stormed into the back room and I stayed standing against the table. I can’t tell you how long I stood there for. Eventually, after an hour, I moved to turn off the stove, then put the soup away in a mindless haze. I wasn’t very hungry, too sick to my stomach, and I knew he wasn’t going to come back out. I collapsed into the couch and sulked there for another hour or two before I heard movement through the apartment, then keys jingling. The front door opened, then shut, and Trevor was gone.

He’d be back; I knew he would. Then we’d talk about what was said, and we’d make up. We’d talk more about my cancer and try to come to a conclusion on it. He’d convince me to try the treatment, and I’d probably do it for him and Dad.

But no matter how much I thought about it, my mind just kept running back to Mom. Running back to those last few years, every gruesome detail still so fresh in my mind.

I may have forgotten her exact face by now, but I still remembered her bony hand. How it felt like I might break her if I pressed too hard. The strain in her raspy throat as she cried from pain that was just too much to bear.

I needed to get away from it all. I couldn’t be there, tangled up in the mess.  

So with Trevor gone, I stood. I moved into my room and packed a bag. Only a few sets of clothes—I wasn’t going to be gone long. I just needed to get out for the night, like Trevor. Sort some things out in my cluttered brain.

All I left was a single note.

*Taking a trip for a few days. Might go see my dad. Need to get away and think. I’ll be home soon.*

*-Hen*

My biggest regret in my stupid, frantic effort to escape was that I somehow forgot to sign that I loved him.

And you know the rest. I put my phone on ‘do not disturb’, then drove for days and days, long past when I meant to. I drove until I passed through a place I wasn’t supposed to, and now I was trapped in hell. The truth is, though, I think I was in hell long before that, just a different kind.

Or maybe the Abyss wasn’t hell at all. Maybe it was a purgatory to see if I really deserved to go back and pick up the pieces I left behind…

I didn’t know if that was even an option at this point, especially with Ann holding the reins, but I did know one thing for certain: As I stood there in the club, surrounded by shifting mannequins and staring down the eyes of my depraved self, I came to a realization. One that I wish I had come to that night as I floated outside of my own body and watched myself tear apart one of the few people who cared about us.

I was sick of myself. I was sick of getting in my own way. I was sick of the ugly, angry, spite filled mug baring her teeth a few feet away. I didn’t realize how much hate I had for her until I was able to stare her dead in the eye. I screwed myself over, then Ann screwed me over a second time. I wasn’t about to be stopped by yet another Hensley.

“June, get the body to the door.” I said plainly.

Something about my tone must have radiated confidence and a plan, because June didn’t hesitate. I released my side of the scientist, and June stepped back with a grunt, limping her way over.

I did have a plan, and this time, it didn’t involve sacrifice. Yes, I was going to distract so that June could get away and save Hope, but it wasn’t to atone for anything this time. This time I was just pissed off, and I knew the only way that Depravity would stop following us was if she was dead.

It was me or her.

Her eyes flickered curiously toward June as she decided who she was going after, but I remedied that with words that I knew would cut deep into this versions brain.

“Come on, you dumb slut! You want to dance so bad—get the fuck out here!” I hissed over the blaring music.

I don’t know how my face looked the night I punched that one girl back at the bar, but if it was anything like Hen 5’s when she heard me sling the same insult, she was probably terrified.

Instantly, I took off running, weaving through the crowd of mannequins back toward the DJ booth. In my peripheral, I thankfully saw June safely disappear among the statues, but my attention was quickly drawn elsewhere as the distorted screams of depravity buried the music.

Hen 5’s massive, swollen palms pounded the concrete as she charged me on all fours, knocking plastic bodies aside like water in the wake of a boat. I suddenly realized how stupid my plan was given that she was so much faster, and I still had a bum hip from the hospital, but adrenaline seemed to patch the fracture momentarily as I pushed for dear life.

Each drum of her swollen hands against the floor was a reminder of the crushed red stain I would become should she catch me.

I hit the stage and vaulted up, sending an ache through my whole skeleton. Depravity was still behind me, but just as I’d hoped, she wasn’t getting far. The strings of the mannequins she was running through had already begun to tangle her like before, and by the time she’d reached my location, she had too many built up to continue forward until she tended to them.

In her raw fury, she set to work, releasing another scream in my own warbled voice and slashing at the ties. I didn’t waste a second, dashing back off the stage and through the crowd the way we’d come. I wasn’t leaving yet, though. This Hensley could actually leave this place, and I didn’t think she’d give up the chase so easily.

I watched the goliath throw her tantrum in my peripheral as I made it to the bar, then scrambled around, looking for the knife that I knew had to be somewhere. I found it tucked up under the counter where I first found the sharpener, but as I looked up, ready for round two, I was too late.

I ducked fast and dove behind the counter as Depravity came bounding like a bear before pouncing like a lion. She sailed over top of me then smashed into the wall of liquor, raining glass and alcohol all over the both of us. The stunt left her in a daze, but it didn’t last long, and she began clawing back up to her feet. Being more nimble, I beat her up, and thinking I had the moment I was looking for, I leaped forward, aiming for her neck.

I saw her eyes fix on me as her gangly limbs slipped on the soaked rubber mats, and as I closed in, she glanced to the side just barely. The knife caught her neck, but not in the way I’d hoped, and it only tore a sizable cut along the side.

Suddenly, I became aware of just how close I was, and my heart froze in my chest. In a cage between her arm, torso and head, she whirled to scream in my face before shooting her hand out and batting me hard.

The tips of her gnarly, feral nails caught my shirt, tearing at the stomach and making a hole, but luckily the main impact was from the back of her fingers. Still, the force was enough to send me flying upward and away, rolling me in the air so that my arm cracked the countertop on the way over its edge.

I thumped against the cement with a huff on the other side, the wind leaving my lungs. I couldn’t scream when my arm began pulsing with an agony like no other. If I thought the fracture in my hip was bad, I certainly had just broken my arm, and this was more apparent when I instinctively went to use it to get myself up. It could barely move, which meant I only had one left.

This should have been a death sentence in my mind, and you’d think it would instill a sudden, sobering fear in me that I needed to get the hell out, but somehow, it only amplified my rage even more. The pain was a frustrating itch that irritated me to no end, and I needed to pummel the person who caused it now more than ever.

I looked for the knife that had been knocked from my hand in the assault, only to see it nowhere in sight. It must have remained on the other side of the counter when I was cracked against it. Depravity was already getting up, though, and I was out of options, so to stun her a second longer, I grabbed a bottle on the bar and threw it hard with my only functioning limb.

It cracked her hard against the cheek, making her recoil against the cabinets, and in the tiny window I had, I grabbed another one, a tall vodka bottle that was peeking up above the raised counter. Smashing its end against the bar, it turned into a jagged circle of sharp teeth, and though I didn’t know how well it would hold up, it would have to do. Slowly, I began backing into the crowd.

Eventually, Depravity finally came to and began slinking over the counter, one limb gripping the wound on her neck, and the other supporting herself. She prowled down like a cat, eyes fixed on me, then bared her teeth again as her eyes twitched. Despite her clear fury, she didn’t follow me this time. Her gaze was analyzing the minefield that had already snared her twice before.

“Come on!” I shouted, my battered figure hunched low and arm dangling loose from my shoulder, “Get your ass out here you pathetic excuse for a person!”

Hen 5 didn’t bite. She just began circling the perimeter of the crowd like a shark, looking for an in.

I bared my teeth, my patience running thin, “Oh, what? So that’s it, huh!? You just give up!? A little trouble and you cut and run!?”

Her yellowed, bloodshot eyes stayed fixed on mine, malice living in the dark pits of her pupils.

“Of course you do! That’s all you’ve ever done! Things get tough, and you find whatever way you can to hide! That’s why we wasted so many years of our lives in this place! Why *you* wasted them!”

I heard a growl slip from her throat, even over the music, and her muscles tensed a bit.

“What are you waiting for, you stupid bitch! Come on! Do *something! Anything!*”

Tears began to well in my eyes, and I gripped the neck of the broken bottle tighter.

“How the fuck did Trevor ever even love you? He found a monster like *you* in this place, and somehow that was someone he wanted to be with? What a joke!”

Depravity kept prowling, but I kept spitting venom as my heart thundered in my chest.

I shook my head in utter exhaustion, blubbering out, “How did he do it? How did he see your vicious eyes and hear your obnoxious screams so many nights in a row and still find a way to live with us? To say that he wanted to spend his life with us? How could we be so apathetic to someone who cared so much!?”

My monstrous reflection finally halted and faced me dead on, her body unmoving and poised.

“He deserved better!” I screamed, tears streaking my cheeks, “He deserved someone like Hope! Someone who would have actually remembered to sign ‘I love you’ on a letter lying about us coming back home! Not you, or Ann, or *me*! So do it! Fucking—*come kill me*, then rot in this place forever, because *that’s* what we deserve!”

Depravity stared at me in stillness once again, weighing her choices, but not moving.

“DO IT!” I screamed at the top of my lungs.

In a flash, her screams joined mine as she barreled forward, kicking up plastic in her wake. The strings above plucked at her like forest bramble, some of them catching, some snapping, leaving a strange chorus of noise underlying the club’s thunderous beat. Finally, when I saw her steps begin to falter, I took off toward her, ignoring the pain as my broken limb flailed in the air.

Depravity was reared on her legs, lines tangling her shoulders and arms that she tried to break loose from, when I leaped up and jammed the bottle into the front of her neck.

Breath sifted through my gritted teeth as I panted like a feral beast, and my eyes were cold and calculated as I stared her own down with rage. They went wide at the shock of cold glass slicing her flesh, and her mouth fell open with a weak gasp before blood began to pour from it. It ran down her jaw like a faucet to the floor, and she tried to make a sound that only caught as a gurgle in her throat. Still, I could make out its intent. I knew because it was my own voice, after all.

It was a whimper. A scared, horrified whimper.

The Hensley tangled up before me went limp in her restraints, her rage boiling off as she tried to process what was happening. The sight made me abruptly feel cold, and the fire in my chest burned everything away into ash that sank heavy in my stomach. My fingers around the bottle in my hand began to ache with their familiar strained sting, and I felt them uncurl from the weapon as I backed away.

It slipped from the flesh, then crashed to the floor where it shattered to pieces.

Hensley looked down at me, and I looked up at her, and despite moments ago feeling nothing but raw, unadulterated anger toward the clone before me, I suddenly felt pity.

I hated her. I really did. Back in my college days, I hated the disgraceful version of myself that had withered away the years and hurt so many people in the process. If we really wanted to get down to the specifics, there’s a good chance that me being so constantly drunk and numb was what stopped me from noticing the ache in my body before it was too late.

And yet, standing there, looking at her eyes whose only difference was the pain held in them, all I felt was pity. Pity and sorrow.

She was scared. Beneath everything she ever did or had done back in that small college town, she was just a lost, anxious girl who didn’t know how to deal with something that cut her too deep to repair.

I could be mad all I wanted for the trouble she had caused me with her self-neglect, but at the end of the day…

She was me. And I had never meant to be a monster.

I stepped forward, with a shaking hand, my boots padding into the growing puddle of blood. She was still looking at me, her eyes so tragically forlorn. I almost saw her struggle to back away from me with what little strength she had remaining, but the strings kept that from happening.

I hated seeing her so scared and panicked, and all I wanted to do was help ease the suffering I’d just caused, so I did the only thing that I knew helped me to calm down. Something mom did for me long ago.

I raised a hand to her hair and began gently combing through the gnarled locks, doing my best to mimic a brush.

“Shhhh, it’s okay,” I murmured, “It’s going to be okay…”

Hensley eased up and went limp again, and her eyes settled in their sockets.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered, a stray tear running down my cheek, “I’m so sorry I did this to you…”

There was no forgiveness in her eyes. not even a level of understanding toward my words; certainly not at the deeper meaning behind them. She clearly understood my comfort, though, so I just continued to soothe her the best I could. Softly, I placed my forehead to hers so she could hear over the music, then began to hum Mom’s lullaby.

She kept looking into my eyes for a moment before they slowly slid shut, and she did her best to breathe past the blood in her throat while she listened. I shut mine tightly too and just continued to hum, trying to let go of the actions I’d just committed.

Slowly, all the sound fell away. The club music faded, the groans of the collapsing rig ceased, and all we could hear was my singing and her labored breaths.

I expected each one to be her last. I kept counting them one by one, waiting for the last release, but instead of that happening, something else occurred that I wasn’t prepared for.

I ran my fingers through her hair again, but I felt the locks come loose. I expected to see a wad of hair tangled around my fingers, but instead, I just barely caught a glimpse of it turning into glittering black sand. Confused, I pulled back and looked forward at her face. Her eyes were still closed, and her face was now peaceful, but that visage didn’t last long. Rather quickly, it began to sag and morph, her pale skin turning dark before falling away in the same obsidian grains.

I moved my hand to cup her cheek, frantic to hold her together even if she was dying, but it all sifted through my fingers like an hourglass. The same happened to her limbs and torso, allowing the strings that had held her to finally go slack and dangle freely, but what was left in the space before me wasn’t just air.

Beneath her body was a figure of glowing, warm light. A small shine peeked out from the receding sand where her figure once was, smaller and closer to my normal size. It hovered there for a moment—just long enough for me to take it in—then as fast as the sand falling away, it moved toward me.

I felt a sudden pressure in my lungs as I exhaled, almost like I was suffocating. It felt heavy as I tried to pull my next breath in, like the air was thick. As I managed to do so, the faint light collided with my body, passing into my skin then vanishing altogether.

I collapsed to the ground, coughing among the black sand and blood still piled beneath me. What the hell had just happened? What *was* that? I looked back up at the dangling ropes, then at the sand, hoping to find an answer. There was none, however, and while I sat there pondering, a sudden churn from the surrounding rig snapped me out of it.

The dust was falling heavier from the ceiling now, and I needed to move.

Limping through the street with one hand gripping my broken arm, I lumbered back toward the cliff side, eyeing the tower light the entire time.

Still off, thankfully.

While normally, that would have been good news, it was also a little concerning. We’d usually have another beast up here by now with how much time had passed since the last. Especially with the noise from The Warehouse behind me. Nothing was up here, though, the streets their usual deserted self.

It gave the same feeling as birds in the forest falling hush when danger is near.

I picked up the pace.

I tried to ponder what had happened to Hensley 5 back at the club as I walked, but I didn’t get far with speculation. I was still in the dark on most things about this place, so trying to put together a new piece of the puzzle this late in the game seemed like a lost cause. If I got stuck here, which was likely to happen when we gave Ann this stupid body, I would have all the time in the world to figure it out.

I caught up with June who was nearly to the door when I found her. I whistled low to get her attention, and after snapping toward me in fear, she saw who it was and sprinted over, leaving the limp scientist body in the cart.

“I’m impressed you got it in that thing alone,” I told her, “Hope and I could barely—”

She slammed into me without a word and hugged me tight, making me yelp in pain thanks to my arm.

June pulled away fast and placed her hands to her mouth, “I’m so sorry—Are you okay? What happened? I was so worried!”

“I’m okay, June,” I assured her, “Thank you for listening to me back there.”

“After the hospital, I had no reason to not trust you would make it out okay,” She nodded, “You didn’t answer me—are you hurt?”

“I’m fine,” I lied, “She just banged me up pretty good is all.”

June scrutinized my arm, seeing it was clearly not okay, but she didn’t call attention to it. Her mind was drawn elsewhere.

“The other clone… did she…? What did you do?”

I pursed my lips and stared into June’s eyes, not exactly sure what to tell her. We didn’t have a lot of time, and telling her what actually happened would take far too much explanation.

“She… won’t be bothering us,” I told her plainly, nodding in reassurance.

She surprised me by looking a little sad at the declaration, but nodded back, shying her eyes away and turning toward the body. I was glad she was always too timid to push for more.

“Do you think Ann is really going to hold up her end of the deal on this?” She asked me.

I took a deep breath, then looked toward the cliff where the door floodlight illuminated the wall.

“Well, we don’t really have a choice either way, and there’s only one way to know for sure.”

June nodded, then looked at the road with pursed lips, “Hen, if she doesn’t… are we going to be okay out here?”

I looked at her and bit my cheek, taking in her innocent, childlike fear. I couldn’t lie to her. I wasn’t going to tell her that I had some grand idea to save us or that the beast from below wouldn’t find us when it inevitably arrived.

After what I’d just come to terms with back at the club, though, I had a newfound sympathy toward this gentle version of myself, and I released my broken arm to take her hand.

She looked at me in surprise, and I just smiled at her.

 Together, we began the rest of the trek to the hatch.
