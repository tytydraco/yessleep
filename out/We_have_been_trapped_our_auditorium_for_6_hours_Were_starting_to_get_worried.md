I’m sorry if this isn’t very coherent. I’m really fucking scared right now.

I’m typing this out instead of my english paper. Since I don’t think it will matter much if I do it before 11:59. Like the title says, we’ve been stuck inside for about six hours now. We have spent this time calling our worried family and friends. Telling them what little we know. I thought maybe I would post here just in case someone knows whats going on. Maybe we aren’t the only ones experiencing this.


First off, you can call me Micah. Maybe this will help set me apart from the other stories here. Because time is of the essence. I am a member of a college theatre department, and we were getting ready for our production of “Something Rotten” tomorrow when our director got a call. This isn’t unusual, especially right before a show. But we all knew something was weird when she walked back in the auditorium, locked the door and told us all to sit down. 


“Okay. We are all gonna be here for a while. I just got off the phone with (College President). There's some sort of contagion going around in the area. And for right now we need to hunker down and wait it out. So we are back in quarantine for the time being.” Of course, we all started to panic. But our director quickly called an end to it by putting us back to work. We had nowhere else to be anyway. We all assumed it would be a few hours, we would all get tested or something, and be sent home. We just treated it like COVID. Some of us even making light of the situation.   

No one is joking anymore.


Two hours in, someone in a hazmat suit came in. They set us back down and had us approach one by one as they took a blood sample from everyone. Heidi, our lead costume tech, fainted when approached with the needle. They didn’t speak to us despite giving us short instructions. Mrs K, our director, was growing more worried with each person they tested. Finally, they left. Leaving us alone again to wonder what the hell was going on. With nothing else to do, and our phones dying. We decided to set up a movie on the cyc. When we got bored, we started having sing offs, then dance offs, then played games from Whose Line. We almost forgot that we were in danger.


We first noticed something was wrong with Mel when he started having trouble breathing. This dude worked out everyday and carried heavy set pieces like they weighed nothing. He was not one to tire easily. We decided it was time to try and settle down. We all rushed around, trying to claim one of the couches in the blackbox. At this point, Mel seemed to feel better. He joined in on the antics, physically picking up Cade from his favorite couch, much to everyone's dismay. We cheered and egged them on as they playfully wrestled. Cade outmatched by a mile. Just as we thought Mel might take the couch, he stopped fighting. Cade tried to egg him on a bit to get him going again, but Mel just heaved a few times before hacking up a blood clot and collapsing. He convulsed forever. Mrs K ordered us out of the room, but none of us moved. We were in shock. He was fine just minutes ago. Some people vomited. Some people swore. Some people started sobbing. Me, I just stared. I was frozen to the spot. I was the last one to leave simply because I didn’t have the will to move. This was real. This was scary. And we were trapped in here with it.


We still aren’t entirely sure what the symptoms are, so this might be something different. But I think not knowing is worse. We keep asking what happened to Mel. If he’s okay, does he have the virus or bacteria or whatever this thing is. Mrs K doesn’t know anything. And the hazmat people won’t talk to us. You would think we would be told SOMETHING. But right now it’s just all theories and fear.After the convulsions stopped, he was moved into one of the classrooms. They won’t tell us if he’s alive or dead. But Finley snuck a peak in before they closed the door. Apparently, he was bleeding from his eyes, nose, and ears. We aren’t holding out much hope.


This is when we started calling around. No one seems to know what we are talking about. Parents are saying it's not on the news, and it's not on any sort of social media. We’ve been posting a lot while we’ve been here and literally no one has seen it. My mom said it might be some sort of Halloween thing. Something set up by the school and upperclassmen to mess with freshmen. But this is too elaborate. And it’s a school night. We have class tomorrow. So we emailed our professors. It's pretty late so no ones gotten a reply yet. But we hope they can confirm that it's just a prank or that it's not as bad as we think. 


So far, everyone feels fine. We are just sitting around now waiting on an all clear, but we don’t think that's coming anytime soon. We have made some makeshift beds and sleeping areas. Mrs K is trying to get us some food besides the snacks in her office. We are all starving. We have water fountains, but we’re worried about it being contaminated, so we’re hesitant to drink from it.  


If anyone has any idea what could be going on, or if you heard of something like this happening, any information you can offer would be amazing.

Right now, there are 38 of us. Mel is in Classroom 124B. 

We are alone and scared. Please help.
