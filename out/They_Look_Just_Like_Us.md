I’ve been living out here for a while now. A small cabin, miles from anyone, surrounded by nothing but trees and silence. It was supposed to be an escape—a place to clear my head, to figure things out after everything that happened.

But I think I made a mistake coming here.

Because something else lives in these woods.

And the worst part?

They look just like us.

It started with the man at my door.

It was late—past midnight. A knock, slow and deliberate. Not the kind of knock you expect from someone lost or in trouble.

I hesitated before opening it.

The man standing there was off. Not in any obvious way—his clothes were normal, his face looked human—but something in the way he stood, too stiff, like he didn’t quite know how bodies were supposed to move.

“Can I help you?” I asked, keeping my hand near the knife on the counter.

He smiled. Too wide.

“I just wanted to see if you needed anything.”

His voice was hollow, like he was repeating something he’d heard before.

I forced a polite smile. “I’m good, thanks.”

He didn’t leave. Just stood there, smiling, until I slowly shut the door.

Then I heard it.

A second knock.

But this time, it came from the back door.

I didn’t sleep that night.

The next morning, I found tracks in the dirt outside. Bare footprints. Not just one set—at least five or six, circling the cabin.

I packed a bag. I was ready to leave, but my truck wouldn’t start.

Which didn’t make sense. It was fine yesterday.

I popped the hood, expecting a dead battery.

But something had torn out the wires. Ripped them, like an animal had been at them.

Except there were no bite marks. No claw marks. Just the clean, precise strength of something that wanted me to stay.

That night, I locked the doors and loaded my rifle.

And then, around 3 AM, I heard it.

Not knocking this time.

A voice.

Right outside my window.

“Hey, man… you okay?”

I nearly dropped the gun.

It was my own voice.

I turned slowly.

Outside, in the dark, something was standing just beyond the treeline. I couldn’t see it clearly, but I felt it watching.

Then it spoke again.

“You don’t look so good.”

It was me. My voice, down to the exact tone.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

Then I heard a new sound.

A second voice.

Lower, raspier.

“You should let us in.”

I didn’t sleep after that. Just sat there with my rifle, staring at the door.

By morning, they were gone.

I went outside, half-expecting more footprints, but there was nothing. Like they had never been there.

Except they had.

Because when I went back inside, my back door was unlocked.

I hadn’t touched it.

I started noticing more things after that.

At first, small details. A chair slightly out of place. A cupboard left open when I swore I had closed it.

Then, something worse.

I woke up one morning and found my own footprints leading out of the cabin.

Bare. Identical to mine.

Except I hadn’t gone outside.

That was two nights ago.

I haven’t left since. Haven’t eaten. Barely even blinked.

Because last night, they came again.

They didn’t knock this time.

They just watched.

I could hear them breathing. Could hear the slow, deliberate shifting of weight as they moved around the cabin.

And then, just before dawn, one of them pressed its face to the window.

I only caught a glimpse.

It looked like me.

But the eyes were wrong.

Too big. Too black.

And the smile—

I don’t know how to describe it.

Like it was still learning how.

I don’t know how much longer I can stay here.

My truck is dead. My radio only picks up static.

I thought about trying to hike out, but every time I step beyond the cabin, I get this overwhelming sense of wrongness, like something is waiting for me to go too far.

I think they want me to run.

I think they want to take me.

And the worst part?

I don’t think anyone would notice I was gone.

Because something else would come back in my place.

Something that looks just like me.

And no one would ever know the difference.
