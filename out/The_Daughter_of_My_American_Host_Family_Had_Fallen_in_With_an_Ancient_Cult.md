The metallic odor filled the cafeteria of Dunmore high school as Sophia dipped her entire book of shadows into a bucket of animal blood. She flipped through the book to make sure none of the pages could be saved. Her witch friends watched in horror as if it was their book that was being destroyed. 

I remember just two weeks ago Sophia was enthusiastically showing me her book of shadows. The notes and illustrations she had accumulated for the past 5 years were all gone. 

Sophia smeared some of the blood on her face and then proudly proclaimed that she was no longer a witch and was now something else, a word that I had never heard before. That was the last time I saw Sophia before the tragedy 2 months later.

\*\*\*

I knew Sophia Puso by chance. The Pusos stepped up when my assigned host family, the Russells, had an emergency and could not accommodate me for two weeks.

Sophia’s dad, Edward Puso, told me that he and his wife normally wouldn’t host a teenage male since they have a teenage daughter, but he saw my nerdy photo and determined that I was harmless.

&#x200B;

So, why would an aspiring film nerd like myself participate in an exchange program with a small-town American high school deep in Shenandoah Valley, Virginia? 

The short answer is, I was an idiot. I have a cousin who lives in Alexandria, Virginia and I thought that by choosing a high school in Virginia, Dunmore being the only one on the list, I could always retreat to my cousin’s place if anything bad happened. How was I supposed to know that there’d be literal mountains, as in, the Appalachian Mountains between us?

&#x200B;

Arming with knowledge about American high schools from movies, I thought for sure that a nerdy outsider such as myself was going to be at worst bullied or at least ignored. Well, the opposite happened.

&#x200B;

Maybe it was because I didn’t know their past or maybe it was because they knew I will be leaving soon, but people just started spilling their life stories to me. Within the first three days, before I even started school, I knew that:

* Ms. Helen, a neighbor of the Pusos, was so proud that she learned how to count cards from YouTube. She used her newfound ability at her country club and won a horse from her nemesis who was the ex-wife of her late husband.
* Caleb, a postman with a glasseye, told me that he suspected the farmhands on his brother’s farm had been stealing canned food from the kitchen.
* Ryan, a school bus driver who was also an avid hunter was livid that his ex-wife was trying to turn their teenage son into a vegan.

​​

Even Edward Puso confided in me. He told me that when he was my age, he was falsely accused of cutting off the brakes of his father’s car which caused the fatal crash that killed his parents. He was arrested and the case even went to the jury, despite the fact that Edward was inside the car. He even suffered a lifelong injury to his leg, which made him have to use a cane for the rest of his life.

&#x200B;

Edward’s daughter Sophia was a proud Wiccan, who had a giant pentagram painted on her bedroom door. Not knowing anything about Wicca, I thought she would be into black colors and dress in a gothic style. But Sophia’s room had large windows that let the sun in and were filled with beautiful flowers and cute drawings. 

&#x200B;

During the two weeks, Sophia was my chauffeur. She often took me to the go-to place for the people in the area, the Sunnyville truck stop. It was the largest gas station on Interstate 81 and had tons of stores. Teenagers could be seen hanging around in the back of the stores playing skateboards. 

On the last day before I moved to live with my actual host family, I was in a car Sophia when we passed a stretch of road with small wooden stalls to the side. I wondered aloud when this market was supposed to be opened.  We passed it every day both day and night. Yet they are always close.

&#x200B;

Sophia said she had lived here all her life and had never seen these shops open. To my shock, she actually parked the car and got out. I was amused and joined her in browsing around the empty stalls.

&#x200B;

I noticed that one of the stalls had 3 symbols placed on top of one another: an upside-down triangle made of six small circles, a cup, and without any mistake, a symbol of a penis.

I made a cliche joke about how some men are so compelled to doodle penises everywhere, but Sophia looked at the three symbols with strange intensity. 

&#x200B;

That night, as I was packing my stuff back into my luggage, Sophia knocked on my room’s door. She showed me on her phone that someone sent her a photo of us browsing the empty stalls. 

I was terrified that we were stalked. Sophia was surprisingly calm. She said that technically we were the ones who trespassed. She thought we were dealing with a clan way deep in the backwoods. The message sent with the photo said that ‘we are always open if the young witch is interested in some rare goods.

&#x200B;

Sophia excitedly typed back, yes. I warned her that these people might be dangerous. How did they even know that she was a witch? She then asked me if I would protect her. I told her yes, but I warned her that I would probably go down pretty fast. 

\*\*\*

I moved to the Russells and made fast friends with their son Mica because we both played an RTS game called Age of Mythology. Though he was three years older, Mica didn’t go to college elsewhere like most people and still hung out with the students at Dunmore. He said that he babysat most of them at some point.

&#x200B;

Mica filled me in on what happened to Sophia earlier that year. Her childhood crush, a baseball team captain named Theo, died in a car crash. There was heavy traffic on Interstate 81 that day, and all the cars took a detour deeper into the mountain. You can avoid traffic by choosing one of the parallel roads going south, but the closer you get to the mountain, the more likely you are to get lost. The roads at the based of the mountain was like a labyrinth.

&#x200B;

Theo was with his girlfriend who also perished in the crash. Sophia couldn’t even grieve openly for him, since very few people know about her crush. Sophia had to internalize all of her pain, not able to discuss it even with her witch friends.

&#x200B;

In the next few weeks I was surprised by how little I saw Sophia, despite still living only two blocks away from her house. I seemed to be the only senior at the school who still ride the school bus. Mica said he could drive me, but the dude woke up at 1 PM.  

I only saw Sophia in the hallway between classes. We just nodded at each other. If I had moved in with the Russells from the start, I would probably never said a word to her.

I remember the night before Sophia had a fallout with her witch friends, I had a vivid dream about her. I was in a crowded night market surrounded by forest. It took me a minute to realize that these shops were the always empty stalls we saw at the side of the road.  

&#x200B;

Sophia had her back to me. I tried calling her, but no words came out. She disappeared behind the curtain of one of the stalls, and the shop owner shooed me away.

&#x200B;

The shop owner had the same unique physical feature as the hundreds of people in the crowd.  There were two main types. One was the short stocky elderlies in ragged clothing. At least I thought they were old, since they were covered in wrinkles. They had enlarged features that made them look like someone who was cosplaying as a goblin but never bother to paint their skin green. They proudly showed off their crooked yellow teeth by having a permanent full-teeth grin. 

&#x200B;

Another type was these very tall women standing with their arms raised in the air, surrounded by these elderlies. They seemed to be in their own world, switching between closing their eyes and looking up while dancing in place. One of them was twirling small snakes in her hair, while another, held up a pig above her head and sucked on its teats. 

My eyes couldn’t help but focus on the big truck that seem to be blocking the night market’s entrance. It had large horns coming out of its side. They were so huge, no car could pass in the next lane.  

&#x200B;

As I was browsing the stalls, looking at creepy smiling fishes with human teeth, and a giant deer’s head covered in flies, I felt something hard and long pressed against my back. I thought it was a cane or something. If I had to guess, it was a leg of a chair. When I turned around and saw one of the old goblin-like men smiling at me. I looked down to see what he was jabbing me with, and it was the man’s reaction poking out of his pants.

I freaked out. I turned to look around and saw that all the elderly males at the night market had huge bulges sticking out too. And they were as big as their owner’s arm. 

I jolted awake, covered in sweat. I forced myself to laugh, thinking I had just been jabbed with a member by a gnome-looking grandpa in a dream. But then I felt a slight ache in my lower back, right where the old man jabbed me with his schlong.  

The next day, the fallout between Sophia and the witches happened. It was lunchtime and I made it to the cafeteria too late to see how it started. From what I gathered from the crowd’s murmur, Sophia was revealing how she got her hands on a very rare ingredient for a spell. Instead of being excited for her, the rest of her coven got freaked out. 

&#x200B;

Mel, who acted as the de facto leader of the coven, was struggling to press down her judgemental tone. But there was no mistake about it. The ingredient Sophia retrieved was used for only one type of spell. Necromancy. She didn’t expect Sophia to answer the way she did.

&#x200B;

So what? What’s so bad about necromancy? The other witches gasped.

Please show me any source that said necromancy is forbidden. And I swear to the goddess if you cite a CW show or a YA novel I’m going to scream so loud people in Baltimore could hear.

&#x200B;

Mel cut to the point. You want to bring back Theo. I know you love him. I know you are carrying immense pain, and I should have done more to make sure that you are okay. Theo was a lot of things to many people here. I missed him too. And I thought if you weren’t okay you would have shared your feelings with us, your sisters. But necromancy is not the answer.

&#x200B;

Sophia dropped all pretense. Do you know what is not the answer? Whatever this is. 

&#x200B;

There has to be more to witchcraft than eating rocky road ice cream from a bucket and binge-watching Buffy seasons 4-6. Our ancestors of yesteryear would be appalled that this is what modern-day witches are doing. We are supposed to be powerful! Our grandmothers were powerful! 

What have we done in the past 4 years that made any difference? Making useless pentagram trinkets to give away during bakesale? Oh, I totally forgot, Mel, you went on the intercom to cast a well-wishing spell for everyone to have a nice and safe Spring Break. How did that help Theo?

&#x200B;

Mel, in tears, broke. That is not fair!

Sophia screamed. What is not fair is that instead of helping me, you are dragging me down. I’m suffocating here. If this is witchcraft, I want no part in it.

&#x200B;

Then, the destruction of Sophia’s book of shadows in a bucket full of animal blood happened. In hindsight, Sophia probably expected her witch friends to try and stop her attempt at necromancy and planned the performance. She smeared the remaining blood on her hands onto her face and proudly proclaim.

I’m not a witch. I’m a Maenad.

\*\*\*

Dunmore high school did not have any video production courses. The closest thing was History of Broadcast Media, taught by Mr. Phillip Ores.

I took the class with Mel, but we never talked. 3 weeks after the event in the cafeteria and Sophia quit coming to school, Mel approached me and asked me to check on Sophia at her house. Since I was an outsider and Sophia spoke positively about me, she thought I had a better chance at communicating with her than anyone else.

&#x200B;

Now, in hindsight, I shouldn’t have said this, but I did have a big mouth when I was younger. I asked Mel why not just humor Sophia since her attempt to resurrect Theo will fail anyway. If she can, it would be mankind’s biggest discovery since wheels. 

&#x200B;

Mel told me that Wicca is her religion and she took it very seriously. Which means that she believed wholeheartedly that magic is real. And even though, like me, she doubted that Sophia could have resurrected Theo, she was afraid that in trying to do so Sophia may unleash something else. But, Mel also admitted that she was envious of Sophia’s heightened senses. Maybe she did try to enforce her authority as the leader of the group too much on that day.

&#x200B;

After agreeing to help, we listened to Mr. Ores’s lecture. Which was about reenactments.

Mr. Ores explained that when most people think of reenactment, they think about the American Most Wanted shows where unknown actors reenact a fugitive’s crime. But, Mr. Ores argued that reenactment may be one of the oldest forms of storytelling, second only to just telling the story straight at a campfire.

&#x200B;

Back in ancient times, theatre plays were considered to be religious events. When we watch Greek Tragedy now, we know that the olympian gods are fictional, but people back then truly believed they exist. The stories of Ajax, Agamemnon, and Antigone, to the audiences, were historical events that really did take place 800 years before their time.  

&#x200B;

Mr. Ores then introduced something else, something I have never heard before. It is called Cruel Fate Recital. 

He said that before the Greek tragedy reenacted a historical event, there was a type of ritual that aimed to make the events happen again for real. It involved cult members manipulating real people.

&#x200B;

Take, for example, a classic story about an older man who felt threatened by his adult son. He was afraid that his son will kill him, so he attacked his son first, who in turn, killed his father in self-defense. 

Well, these cult members will, over a long period, manipulate a real father and son pair to unknowingly try to kill each other. On the day of the fight, the father would be sabotaged and the son would win. 

&#x200B;

The logic behind Cruel Fate Recital is that something so tragic, such as a real father being killed by his real son, would surely get the gods’ attention. The cult members will then slaughter the adult son for his crime and sacrifice the body of both father and son to the gods to complete the ritual. 

After class, I asked Mr. Ores if he knew what a maenad was. I already searched for it on Wikipedia after Sophia said it. I know they were powerful frenzied followers of Dionysus. After Mr. Ores gave me a similar explanation, he asked me why I asked. I told him that Sophia said she was one, and Mr. Ores almost fell out of his chair.

&#x200B;

Mr. Ores checked outside the class to see if anyone was lingering outside then shut the door. He then told me in a hushed voice that he always suspected that there was a Dionysus cult activity in this area. They may have been here since European immigrants came to the Appalachia in the 1700s, but kept a low profile among the Presbyterians.

&#x200B;

I couldn’t believe that there are still followers of the olympian gods, since they were shown getting slaughtered by Xena and Kratos in various media without anybody protesting. Surely everyone must know by now that they aren’t real. 

Mr. Ores said that whether or not Dionysus is real is not the point, his followers believe that he is, and they are dangerous, especially the maenads. 

&#x200B;

Besides, Dionysus was always an outsider god. Even though during the classical greek era, Dionysus’ birth and life story was incorporated fully into the olympian gods' mythos, you can tell that something was different about him. It is very much possible that a few hundred years before the classical greek era, Dionysus was a main solo god of a powerful cult in the region, and the Greeks just had to add him to the pantheon as a way to incorporate those people.

&#x200B;

When I told Mr. Ores that I was going to go check on Sophia, Mr. Ores gave me a warning. 

The Cruel Fate Recital that he talked about in his lecture was very much a product of the cult of Dionysus. It was common for the cult members to recite the story of Pentheus. Their MO was, the cult members will entice someone to say bad things about Dionysus like Pentheus did, and if the person fell for it, the Maenads will rip that person to pieces. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

I went home and told Mica that Mel asked me to go check on Sophia. To get him to come with me, I told him everything that both Mel and Mr. Ores told me, including the dream that I had. 

Mica was laughing when I told him about the old men with erections, but he grew pale when I mentioned the truck with horns. He looked at me suspiciously, which made me nervous. He then showed me a screencap of the baseball team group chat. A few minutes before Theo crashed his car, he was on his way to a baseball practice but got lost in the maze-like roads of the backwoods. He then said that a truck with huge horns was in front of him and he couldn’t pass, making the situation much worse. That was the last thing Theo typed. 

&#x200B;

I tried to look on the bright side. If Sophia was with these people, maybe she will change her mind if she knew that the truck was responsible for Theo’s death.

When we got to the Pusos, everything felt very wrong. The air was thick, the sky was blood red, and the crows were all over the telephone poles but they weren’t making any sound. In front of the house, there were a couple of people dancing. They were the goblin-like people I saw in my dream.

&#x200B;

Nice to see you again, outsider, said one of the women. You know, our Lord Bacchus is an outsider too. You are from Asia, right? Our lord went to Asia too. Why don’t you let us take you apart? We will put you back together again, better than ever.

I couldn’t believe they admitted that they worship Dionysus just like that. 

They then started chanting: Outsider inside-out! Outsider inside-out!

&#x200B;

I saw that the door was open so I went in. If I wasn’t going to find Sophia, at least I can talk to Edward, who never left the house during the time I was there. I saw that some of the goblin-like people were passing out on the sofas. The house was a mess. It reeked of alcohol and wet sock. I made my way to the back dining room, where I saw Edward Puso sitting facing the wall. He had bandages wrapped around his head. When I asked him where Sophia was, he began to unwrap the bandages.

He said that Sophia was always his light. She made him see the truth. When she did ‘this’ to him, she did so because it was the only way that he could finally see.

&#x200B;

He turned to us to reveal that his eyes were gouged out.

&#x200B;

Both Mica and I jumped back. I asked him if Sophia did this. I suggested calling the police. Edward shook his head. He said his trouble was his alone to bear as only he could endure it.

He revealed that he did cut the brakes on his father’s car. He was mad that his father caught him acting inappropriately towards his own mother, and was going to send him to a mental institution. He then tried to injure his foot to help support his story that he was also in the car. But, as he was striking down the hammer, his guilt and self-hate forced his hand to hit a bit too hard. 

Then, the elderly women outside began chanting.

&#x200B;

>Eddie Puso got on his knees  
>  
>Begged the gods to hear his plea  
>  
>In blindness he finally sees.  
>  
>His sin will never set him free

Since then, various other tragedies begin to occur to the people of the small town. 

* Ms. Helen was informed that the horse she won from a card game was finally delivered to her barn. When she got there, she was ambushed by her late husband’s ex-wife.
* The postman Caleb didn’t know that his brothers were holding undocumented workers against their will and forced them to work on his farm as slaves. During their escape, they blinded Caleb’s remaining eye.
* Ryan took his son out hunting to spite his ex-wife. Ryan was shot by a scorpion airgun by a friend who mistook him for a deer.

A huge storm hit, and it wrecked Dunmore’s auditorium, a separate building from the rest of the school since it was built later. The principal asked Mr. Ores to clean up the mess and restore the auditorium. On Saturday, Mr. Ores invited me and other students to come help, telling us that we will get 10 community service hours for our troubles. About 30 students showed up, and Mica decided to join too.

&#x200B;

We were cleaning up the outside, and the auditorium itself was locked. But, I looked through the glass window and saw a shadow figure moving inside. I told Mr. Ores and he said there must have been a mistake. Not even cleaning people could be inside on Saturday. He then saw someone moving too.

&#x200B;

Mr. Ores, Mica, and I went in. Mr. Ores asked if anybody is in there. I almost pissed my pants when a person walked out of the shadow wearing a black rope and a Greek play mask. The mask wasn’t smiling or crying, it just looked shocked.

&#x200B;

The person walked towards the three of us in an unsteady disjointed step. Mr. Ores became angry to hide his nervousness and shouted, this is the school’s property, an outsider is not allowed in here.

The masked man replied in a raspy strained voice. But I am a student here. I’m Theo.

I have no idea what Theo sounded like, all I knew was that both Mica and Mr. Ores were stunned. 

Theo continued, I am here to see the rebirth of Sophia. Don’t you miss her? Don’t you want to see her? She’s on stage right now. Come and see.

&#x200B;

Without waiting for our response, the figure that claimed to be Theo opened the door and entered the main hall. All three of us followed in. The auditorium was surprisingly huge. There were people inside wearing ropes. But some of them took off their mask. They were those goblin-like people. The curtain slowly opened as we walked along the pathway closer to the stage. Then, I stopped in my track when I finally saw her.

&#x200B;

Sophia, in bloody pieces, joined together by wires, was hung like a puppet from the stage’s ceiling. Her torso was hollowed out and I couldn’t see what was inside because it was covered with flies. Her detached head was the most frightening thing I had ever seen. Her mouth was propped open with her jaw being lowered down further than possible when she was alive. In it, black grapes were stuffed inside. Her eyes were wide open.

&#x200B;

It took me an eternity of 5 seconds before I knew what I was seeing. I was looking at a dead body. Then, her eyes and head abruptly turned toward me. I screamed and fell to the floor. Mr. Ores helped me up and told both me and Mical to run.

  
As we turned and run, I could hear one of the goblin men said, I thought you want to say hi to Sophia. Come on, say hi. If you turn back around, it means you will join us.

Mr. Ores told us not to turn around no matter what. Just when we're about to make it out. We heard it.

*Guys?*

It was Sophia’s voice. There was no mistaking it.

&#x200B;

*Sorry I was gone for a while. You can turn around and look at me. See? I’m fine. Theo is fine too. See? We were taken apart and put back together again. And now that we are back together, we are better than ever.*

&#x200B;

I grabbed Mica and told him to stare intensely at the exit sign above the door as I did, to avoid accidentally turning back. I didn’t realize until a second later that Mr. Ores turned. 

Bright lights were shining behind us. We didn’t know what it was because we couldn’t look. We could do nothing when we heard Mr. Ores saying, Oh my god, no, it can’t be real. How is this part of reality? Mr. Ores then screamed. We could hear the sound of his body being dragged across the carpet away from us.

&#x200B;

Both Mica and I ran out, and we could see that some of the students that came for their community service hours were dancing in a frenzy. Both in the hallways and also outside.

&#x200B;

Mel couldn’t be found anywhere. Mica was running to his car and I just followed while dialing 911. But, I saw something that made me shout for Mica to not turn the engine on.

&#x200B;

The truck with horns. It came into the school’s driveway. I told Mica to duck and hide. If we drive past the truck it will ram us for sure. We both just have to pray that they didn’t know we were in the car. 

We heard the truck parked quite close to us. We heard whoever was driving turning off the engine. We heard him closing the door. We heard him walking closer to us. Both Mica and I held our breath. But, luckily he walked past us and went into the building. Mica finally started the car and got out of there.

&#x200B;

Northbound Interstate-81, we saw two police cars pass us on the opposite side. Mica stopped at Sunnyville truck stop. We got out of the car and both of us immediately vomited. Mica was crying and I wanted to too. Without thinking too much about how Mica must feel, I just blurted out that I have no interest in ever going back there and was going to go stay with my cousin. 

&#x200B;

Mica answered the voice call on his phone. Mel and a few other sane students locked themselves inside a small room next to the theatre hall. Mel cast a protection spell on the room and it seemed to work. The Maenads could not get in, and the people inside were immune to the frenzy. But now they were trapped.

&#x200B;

Mica told me to call my cousin and ask her to come to pick me up at Sunnyville as he was going to go back to Dunmore. I told him that he was crazy. The police were already on their way there. Mica said that he didn’t have other homes to go to. Unlike me, this place was his home. And even though those cult members had been here all this time, that never gave them the right to kill his friend and teacher like that. I felt incredibly guilty as I watched Mica drove away.

&#x200B;

About a week later, I was on a flight back to my home country. I have been checking social media to see how everyone was, but they all went radio silent except for Mel. Mel posted various poems on her timeline, which could have been protection spells. The post got zero likes and comments for the past few days. I wasn’t close enough with Mel to just DM her, but I tried to DM others I was close with, like Mica, but got no response.

&#x200B;

Then, I got a bunch of notifications that several people were posting on a friend’s timeline. I clicked on it and saw that people were leaving RIP messages on Mica’s timeline. 

‘RIP bro, I’ll miss you.’

‘Why does it have to be you? You are way too young.’

‘I can’t believe we won’t be seeing each other again. RIP.’

I felt numb while browsing through all the messages, trying to find some clue about what happened. One person finally asked, and another person replied with a link. The headline in the preview read: 21-year-old Mica Russells drove too close to the Sunnyville truck stop’s cliffside barrier, lost control, and fell off.

&#x200B;

Then, another fresh message popped up. Someone said. ‘Don’t worry, Mica isn’t dead. We just took him apart. We’ll put him back together. Then he will come back better than ever.’

&#x200B;

I was so mad I started hitting the seat in front of me repeatedly. The lady who sat in the front got up and glared at me. I apologized to her, saying I just heard a piece of very upsetting news about a friend. Despite my apology, the lady would not stop staring. After about six seconds, I got uncomfortable and was about to unleash my anger on her. But then, a flight attendant walked by and asked the woman if she was alright.

Without breaking eye contact with me, the woman revealed her slimy teeth grin and said. “Better than ever.”
