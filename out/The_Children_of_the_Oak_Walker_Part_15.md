[\[Part 14\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1aryymc/the_children_of_the_oak_walker_part_14/)

“You’re lucky to be alive, Miss Brun.” Mr. Koranti kept a slow pace so my still-groggy legs could take time to awaken, his arm interlaced with mine for support. “Whoever performed surgery on you before barely managed to stop the most active components of the growth before it reached your central nervous system. However, you had several internal infections, likely due to organic material they couldn’t reach. I commend their skill, considering how little they probably had to work with, but it made for an uphill battle on our end.”  
*That explains all the bloody mucous.*  
Half paying attention, I stared as we passed through the doorway, and found myself on the other side of an enormous metal-framed cube. Hidden windows lined the outside to allow staff to see in without my knowledge, and a bank of computer monitors were alight with what I realized to be my vital signs in real time. Heartrate, body temperature, brain firing patterns, all were on colorful display. Various cameras watched my little stainless-steel bunk, and an air-filtration system pumped sanitized oxygen into the room through a series of complex tubes. No one else stood in the surrounding room, one much bigger than my little cubicle, and filled with all sorts of machinery.  
Chugging more water from my new bottle with each step, I couldn’t help but marvel at the equipment, shiny stainless and white plastic, everything pristine. “So, what is all this?”  
Koranti flashed a proud grin to a hauntingly familiar machine with several set of robotic arms, raised like silver scorpion tails over the rubber bed inside their plexiglass tube. “What you’re looking at is state of the art AI-powered surgical technology, the first of its kind. These machines can scan, locate, and remove tissue from the body with the accuracy of a tenured surgeon, and the efficiency of a 3D printer. Since the operating table is air-tight, we can flood it with a special antiseptic fluid, which means a zero percent infection rate post-surgery, and with the help of a ventilator it’s even breathable. In eight hours’ time, our technicians pulled close to 100 feet of Breach growth from you and without a single incision out of place.”  
*And I felt every bit of it.*  
My insides made a sickened gurgle at the thought of the cold blades digging into my skin, the eyes watching me from the other side of the glass as I screamed inside my head, paralyzed. “I remember.”  
He patted my hand, and Mr. Koranti led me past an upright round tank that still held its light blue fluid, the sight of it enough to make me feel the slippery gel in my nostrils all over again. “Everything we did was for your safety. It was not for cruelty that we didn’t use anesthesia; we needed the growth to release its mutagenetic cytotoxins as we removed it, in order to stimulate rapid tissue regeneration. If we hadn’t, not only would you have lost your right eye, but large sections of your internal organs and abdominal muscles as well; an effective death sentence.”  
“I see.” I did my best not to look at the various trays of surgical tools, or the motorized operating gurney with padded manacles, the novelty wearing off as the tortuous memories came back. “Are . . . are we still in Barron County?”  
Winding through the maze of plexiglass, steel, and plastic, Mr. Koranti guided me to another doorway on the other side of the surgical room, with a keypad on the lock. “This is the advanced medical wing of the field headquarters we built in Black Oak, once the hostilities boiled over. It was one of our more expensive projects, but well worth it, as I’m sure you can agree. When we aren’t busy studying various specimens, our technology helps to save countless lives, particularly among our wounded soldiers.”  
This last comment seemed to be pointed at me, though not so much in anger as in civil objectivity. It occurred to me that, while we seemed to be alone, teams of guards couldn’t be far off, and my feet had only just stopped tingling. At this point, an escape attempt with no plan, no weapon, and no gear would be suicide. He knew that, I realized, and thus treated me like some visiting patient in his hospital rather than a potentially dangerous POW.  
*So don’t make yourself seem like a threat. Play dumb, play harmless, and keep looking for a way out. There has to be a weakness somewhere.*  
My ears picked up the distant rumble of diesel engines, along with the metallic clanking of something heavy moving over concrete outside. Black Oak had been the largest town in Barron County before the Breach, with almost 10,000 people at one point, or so I’d been told. If ELSAR had such an expensive base here, that could only mean they had somehow protected the city from the mutants, enough to maintain some semblance of normalcy for the citizens within. Granted, from what I’d heard from the soldiers, it wasn’t all going to plan, but the lights were on, the trucks were running with no concern for a fuel shortage, and they had medical care that our researchers could only dream of. Still, there had to be good potential hiding spots in such a large area, ones that even the soldiers would have overlooked. All I had to do was get out of here and find somewhere to lay low, until I could scrounge enough gear to get back to New Wilderness.  
“Either way, it’s incredible.” I didn’t have to try very hard to be impressed, heart thumping in my chest as I hung on Mr. Koranti’s arm. “How’d you get the money for all this?”  
That brought an amused laugh from him as he keyed in a passcode to the door, and Koranti led me into a wide hallway with black-and-white checkered floor tiles. “Our organization wears many faces to keep our true purpose out of the spotlight. Nothing too successful, so that we avoid public scrutiny, but proficient enough to bring in a steady supply of funds. You can’t find them on the stock exchange because they belong to us, are staffed by us, are a part of us. ELSAR doesn’t officially exist, and yet we are everywhere, in everything, from shoes, to toys, to eyeglasses.”  
“So, you aren’t with the government?” I ran my eyes over the barren walls, disappointed to find no windows, only solid sheets of white chemical board.  
“Of course we are.” His eyes twinkled in a way that remined me of a tiger in the grass, calm, but deadly. “They can’t afford to act without us. Who do you think bankrolls their campaigns? Who funds the wars? Even with their printing presses, Congress can’t tax the population fast enough to pay for all the things they want. From time-to-time they need a loan, one that doesn’t come with a receipt, so their voters never catch on. In return, they give us leeway to act as we see fit, to buy what we need, and go where we please. Democrats, Republicans, they all come to me . . . everyone from mayors to presidents.”  
Chills ran through my blood, as the truth sank in. He wasn’t lying, I could feel it in the words, the way he calmly spoke without hesitancy, as if Koranti didn’t care about what I knew, or who I would tell. Never in my life had I stood next to someone so powerful that they could bend an entire government to their will, and now I leaned on his elbow, too scared to let go.  
“Why?” I kept my eyes on my shoes, creeping worries in my head as to what he meant to do with me now that I was healthy. After all, a man this important could buy and sell girls like Kleenex, and no one would do anything to stop him. If he wanted me for something heinous, what could I do other than scream?  
“Do you know what a liminal space is?” He pivoted us to a pair of black elevator doors at the end of the hallway, and pressed his thumb to a digital screen, after which the doors slid open with an obedient *ding*. The interior of the elevator lay completely covered in mirrors, so that it seemed we were walking into a flood of endless doorways.  
Stepping inside with him, I watched the doors close, and took another drink of water for comfort, the bottle in my hands already close to empty. “No.”  
Koranti’s shadowy gaze traveled the mirror-finished walls of the elevator with an almost whimsical gleam. “A liminal space is a transitionary area, a space between destination and current location. A hallway is a liminal space, as is a stairwell, or a street, or even a window. A more philosophical example might be the journey from childhood to adulthood, the cultural shift between ideas, or the years between great historical events. It is a nostalgic, haunting place for many, one ringed with memories but never included in them, a necessary component of a forgotten part of life.”  
I chewed on my lower lip, and focused on his words, determined to understand even while I tried to spot some means of future escape. “Like an elevator?”  
“Exactly.” He granted me an approving nod, and the floor lurched with a slight jolt as invisible cables wound us higher and higher in the gargantuan building. “But what much of the world doesn’t know is that liminal spaces have a far more important, more sinister nature. For there exist spaces between spaces, transitionary planes between our reality, our cosmos, our creation, and others. This unseen ether is bound in place by a veil of intense radioactive and electromagnetic energy that helps separate it from us. Like the subdermal layer of skin beneath the upper layers that face the outside world, these spaces are with us everywhere, all the time, but never surface. Or at least, so we thought.”  
I watched the lights on a panel in the wall count upward from three to six, and Mr. Koranti carried on with his speech, the two of us suspended in a mind-bending kaleidoscope of reflections.  
“You see, Miss Brun, even something as awesome and immense as the universe isn’t perfect. It bends, stretches, tears. Holes appear from time to time, like storms on the sea, and through these holes slips the erratic, chaotic energy of the liminal realm, forming a Breach. Sometimes, it seals itself, like a volcano going dormant. Other times, the phenomenon becomes more active, producing anomalies like the mutant creatures roaming this county.”  
“How?” Too curious at finally being on the edge of true answers, I braced myself against a handrail as the elevator slowed to a halt.  
“The same way normal life is created in our universe; energy.” At the same *ding*, the doors slid back open to reveal a silver carpet-lined hallway with walls of glass on either side, and Mr. Koranti waved for me to go first. These reflected with darkness from the outside, and I could just make out flickers of light onto them from inside the elevator. “Like ours, the chasm passively seeks equilibrium, balance in all things, but without enough sentience to truly sculpt creation, the Breach simply makes copies of what its energy comes into contact with. Sentient life gives birth to any number of strange, fascinating creatures, and it’s no surprise that Breach-born life is just as diverse. It is from this that so many of our legends, myths, and conspiracy theories arose over thousands of years. What people thought were demons, aliens, or cryptids were merely the Breach-born scuttling out into the world, trying to establish their place in it. Every absurd story, every wild tale told around a campfire or on an internet forum, all hold some modicum of truth buried deep in our collective memory as a species, because at one time we really did see them. We just didn’t know what we were seeing.”  
Koranti led me out into the hall, and my feet ground to a halt halfway down it, jaw going slack in stunned amazement.  
The hallway wasn’t a hallway at all, but a sky-bridge between two three-story towers that rose from a central building beneath us of similar height. Scaffolding at the base signaled where teams of workers still labored around the clock to finish it, the men like swarms of ants all over the smooth concrete exterior. Below, the city of Black Oak stretched out in a sea of lights, the sun setting on the distant horizon in a brilliant sheet of orange, red, and pink light. Cars moved about in traffic, some kind of trolley system rolled down the main street, and circled around it all stretched an enormous steel barrier with blinking red lights along the top. Machine-gun towers stood at intervals every hundred yards, and men with guns patrolled the gates with dogs on leashes. Beyond the miles-long wall, no light could be seen in the dark trees or fields, as if the world dropped off into a bottomless pit. Helicopters swooped in and out of a large, clear area to the north of town, and a massive cargo plane with four engines climbed into the sky from the same spot, painted the slate-gray I’d seen so many times before.  
*They’ve got it all. A whole freaking city, sealed off from the outside. Unlimited ammo, oceans of fuel, warehouses packed with food . . . how are we supposed to beat that?*  
Pausing beside me, Mr. Koranti folded his hands behind his back, and looked down upon his captured city-state with a hard sternness in his expression. “The situation here is not unique; Breaches have been detected all over the globe. Ukraine, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Israel, everywhere there are signs of activity, and thus human conflicts engendered to conceal their location. Some are older, like yours here. We estimate this Breach to be from around 1901, when the county was founded. Others are very new; one just opened up in Scotland only weeks ago. Holes are appearing more now than any time in the magnetic record of our planet’s history, and we can only assume it is due to our increased technological footprint. With our satellites, cellphones, and signal towers, we’ve engineered the perfect conductive network to channel electromagnetic energy. Always they operate on two principles; if something is put into our world, something else is dragged out. This reflects on the consciousness of mass humanity, in that most don’t notice, or don’t remember when things go missing. Most Germans don’t remember the Bavarian mining town of Golschfort. It got sucked in sometime around 1945, right before Allied tanks could roll in to capture it. No one in Uruguay recalls the Piedras de Dios monastery. It just popped out of our world one day, poof, gone. Ask anyone in China about the Six-Dragons Gorge. They can’t recall it, because it no longer exists in our reality, and hasn’t since Mao’s Communists sent an expedition down the river that never came back.”  
My confidence began to wane, the sheer might of this operation enough to crush my hopes at escape. Our workers had labored for weeks just to put a log wall around New Wilderness. ELSAR had a steel and concrete fortress protecting every square inch of Black Oak, and had managed it in, what, six months? “So, how come you know? How can anyone know, and not have their memory wiped?”  
“That’s the mystery, isn’t it?” Taking my arm again, Mr. Koranti paced down the sky-bridge toward the plush halls on the other side. “Some people are allowed to keep their memories, to peer into the abyss and see beyond the curtain of our world. We theorize that those who are drawn into the Breach might keep all their memories once they reach their alternate destination. Who chooses them? We don’t know. Why is it so? We also don’t know. There is no rhyme or reason from what we can tell. But for those of us fortunate enough to be granted such mercies, we work to understand this new threat, and guard against it.”  
We came at last to a big set of red-stained cherry doors, which opened at a flick of Mr. Koranti’s hand, and I shuffled into a vast, extravagant office space. An imposing square desk sat near a line of windows that made up the entire wall, carved from a single piece of seamless black marble. A small ebony couch to one side of the room lay resplendent in gold settings, a birchwood coffee table in front of it, and a crystal decanter in a mahogany side cabinet held some kind of sparkling amber beverage. It smelled of mint, somewhat cooler than the hallway had been, though no sound came through the windows from the outside, as if the entire room were heavily insulated.  
*There’s more money in this place than both my parents could have earned for their whole lives.*  
Nervous, I sank onto the comfy sofa at his pointing, and watched Mr. Koranti pull up an onyx-colored armchair across from me. We weren’t alone enough for me to try and flee, or find something to stab him with, but I was sure no one would come running if he decided to pin me to the cushions at this moment. The feeling had at last returned to all my limbs, but even with my strength back, I knew I couldn’t match him for muscle mass. Despite his lavish attire, something about the man resonated with a martial prowess, the same aura I often had from Chris, but without the warm, comforting sensation of being protected.  
No, here I felt vulnerable, defenseless, weak.  
“What’s this have to do with me?” I kept my arms and legs drawn in tight, thankful that my scrubs were generous in their coverage, and calculated the distance from where I sat to the office doors, which had swung shut behind us. “I mean, I’m grateful that you saved my life but . . . why?”  
His well-kempt head cocked to one side, and Mr. Koranti studied me for a moment, as if gauging my response to a yet unspoken question. “You’ve no doubt witnessed the Breach’s effects on the local environment. Even normal life forms are not immune to the effects of its energy. Interestingly enough, it seems to be orderly in some ways, almost intelligent, as if the animals are being formed to better face this world than be consumed by it. Yet there have been no visible effects on mankind, not so much as an inflamed cancer cell or an extra chromosome. Not until *this*.”  
From a pocket inside his expensive suit coat, he produced a folded bundle of paper, and handed it to me.  
With tentative fingers, I unfolded a set of pictures, grainy, as if taken from a satellite. There were several snapshots of similar locations, and in a close-up, I could see a white clapboard church with two figures standing in the yard.  
One of them had long, golden hair.  
My eyes widened in recognition.  
*Eve.*  
“*Homo Melius*.” Mr. Koranti enunciated the words in flawless Latin, one finger raised like a professor teaching a class. “Man improved. It seems nature has decided to balance our inadequacies out with a new line of human, one better suited for this landscape than us. From our sources in the field, we’ve been told they have better sensory perception, better oxygen filtration in their bloodstream, and a higher firing rate of their synapses in the brain. It seems they are even born with a certain number of skills and memories built in, as if by some overarching program we cannot fathom. How or why they came to us is still quite a mystery. We haven’t been able to replicate such things with experiments of our own, but here they are, walking like angels among us . . . and now, we have a living hybrid.”  
A weight in my gut dropped, and I looked up from the pictures to find him staring at me, his smile no longer so bright, Koranti’s eyes focused and keen.  
*No.*  
Without a word, he reached onto his desk, and picked up a small handheld mirror, which he slid across the small coffee table to me.  
My hands shook, sweat beaded on my forehead, but I palmed the mirror, and held it up to my face.  
Two eyes blinked back from the silver of the mirror. They were set in my face, ringed by my dark hair pulled back in a functional ponytail, but they weren’t my old hazel.  
They were gold.  
Luminescent, shimmering gold.  
Where the oily black hair had begun to sprout under my old brown, there were now golden-blonde streaks that stopped where the growth’s march had ended, and around my right eye the silver tattoos either faded or stood out in the light depending on which way I tilted my head. Everything else was the same, the same me gaping at myself in shock, but it felt like I’d locked eyes with a complete stranger.  
*It’s got to be drugs. There’s no way this is possible. No one just changes their eye color overnight . . . do they?*  
My knees trembled, and a thousand questions swirled in my head as I shrunk back against the sofa. “W-Wha . . . I . . . how did . . .”  
Crossing the room, Mr. Koranti poured two glasses of the amber liquid, and swept back over the rug to hand me one. “It’s a shock, I know. Believe me, we were all just as surprised. No one thought a regular human could survive immunological fusion with Breach energy, much less incorporate it into their genetic system. You went un-responsive for three days after the surgery, and your brain activity spiked all over the place in that time. But the blood work doesn’t lie; you’re a Type 6, from the molecular level up.”  
Sipping the glass, I tasted the sweet essence of Port, and gulped down the rest of the mild alcohol in shuddery desperation. “What does that mean?”  
“You were infected with the same genetically altering substance which once made up the lifeblood of what we call Type 7’s.” He took the papers from me, and shuffled them to reveal a biological profile, with some photographs of white-eyed creatures baring their wooden teeth from inside metal cages. “You might know them as ‘Puppets’. Removing it caused a genealogical shift in your helixes. Your DNA meshed with the Breach-born material, and now your synapses have shifted firing patterns, your eyesight is well above average, and your eardrums have doubled in sensitivity. You’ve been adapted, tailor-made to survive in a post-human world.”  
Post-human. A terrifying thought, one that brought to mind ruined, empty cities, desolate landscapes, and forests teeming with monsters. I pictured Vecitorak’s hood in my mind, heard his raspy laugh, felt his knife in my ribs. A world ruled by his kind. That is what lay ahead, if we couldn’t stop this.  
“What do you want with me?” I squeaked, terrified of the words, my mind flashing to Chris, to the fantasy of our children, our farmhouse, of how it felt to be held in his arms. Even with the memory of his lips on Jamie’s fresh in my mind, I wanted him to burst through those doors, machine-gun blazing, and carry me off far away from this foreboding place.  
He sat back in his chair with a triumphant grin, and Mr. Koranti raised his glass to me in a toast that turned my blood to ice. “There’s a smart girl. I want you to join my team. Cooperate. You have friends in that little fort of yours, people who are making a difficult situation worse. You help me talk sense into them, they turn in their guns, and this whole mess can be cleared up in a day or two. In exchange for their safe passage into the green zone, you agree to stay on with us indefinitely. You’ll never want for anything ever again, food, gifts, or any sort of entertainment. All you have to do is remain with the company for research purposes, and your personal protection. After all, you’re a valuable woman now, and my organization isn’t the only one that knows about Breach-made phenomenon.”  
So, there it was. The truth of my captivity, the generous care shone to me, the reason why I’d been ransomed for the beacon. They wouldn’t let me go, I realized, not now, not ever. Sure, I didn’t have to worry about them putting me against a wall, but with this strange act of fate, I’d just become the most wanted girl in all of Barron County, maybe in all the world. I would spend the rest of my life in a lab, like a beetle on a card, being tested, poked, prodded, experimented on. Powerful people would pay money for my genetics, my blood, pieces of my flesh for their own studies. My children wouldn’t be my own, implanted in me by cold, cruel machines, or by ultra-rich men with the desire to have the world’s first Breach-adapted girl all to themselves for an hour or two. Once I’d carried them for nine months, my babies would be harvested like crops from a field, sold to the highest bidder to repeat my horrible existence, all in the name of science and profit. I wouldn’t be human anymore; I would be a product, a commodity, *property*.  
Property of ELSAR.  
“Well?” He raised one well-plucked eyebrow, and Mr. Koranti swirled his drink. “What will it be, Hannah? Do you want to save your friends, or not?”  
I thought of Chris, of Jamie, and the pain of their betrayal slashed through my chest. I’d never been wanted, never belonged, not here, not anywhere. They were happier without me, just like Matt and Carla.  
*Maybe everyone would be.*  
A tear slid out of my right eye, clear and pure, falling to splash into the last brown slick of the Port in the bottom of my empty glass.  
Shutting my eyes, I bowed my head to hold back the sadness, my shoulders heavy with the weight of my choice like an iron collar on my neck. “Yes.”
