The first time it happened, I thought I was just tired.

I turned on the water, let the steam rise, stepped in—same as always. Except when I reached for my shampoo, the bottle was gone.

Weird.

I glanced around, confused. That’s when I noticed the tiles.

They weren’t mine.

My bathroom had cheap beige walls, a cracked soap dish, and a drain that looked like it was one hair away from staging a coup. This one? White subway tiles. Fancy rain showerhead. A tiny fern on a shelf.

I wasn’t in my shower.

I was in someone else’s.

I barely had time to panic before the water pressure flickered, and suddenly—boom.

I was back.

Same old shitty shower. Same old water pressure that dribbled like a dying faucet.

I told myself I imagined it. Too little sleep, too much stress. Just a glitch in my brain, not reality.

But then it happened again.

And again.

Each time, a different shower. Sometimes normal. An old guy humming Sinatra. A woman shaving her legs, oblivious. Another man washing his golden retriever after a skunk had come too close.

I never saw their faces. Never stayed long enough. Just blinked in, blinked out.

Until one night—

I ended up somewhere I shouldn’t have.

The water was ice-cold. The walls, damp and rotten. The showerhead was just a rusted pipe, dripping black sludge.

And the smell?

Jesus.

Like something had died in the drain and spent a few months reconsidering its choices.

I turned to leave. That’s when I saw it.

The other person.

Standing just outside the shower curtain.

Not moving. Not breathing. Just… watching.

I couldn’t see their face. Just a tall, stretched-out shadow behind the curtain.

And then—

The curtain started pulling back.

I yanked the shower handle, trying to warp back—nothing.

The curtain slid open another inch.

I slammed my eyes shut. Not here. Not here. Take me back.

Something cold touched my arm—

And then—

I was home.

I stumbled out of the shower, gasping. My skin was damp, but not from water. From something else. Something sticky.

I didn’t shower again for three days.

When I finally did—

I wasn’t alone.

The portal was getting stronger. More random. More unpredictable.

One night, I stepped in and landed in a shower half-filled with blood.

Another, I found myself in a stall with walls that… breathed.

Once, I appeared in a prison shower, surrounded by dudes who could see me.

I got out of that one fast.

Then came last night.

I turned on the water. Took a deep breath. Stepped in.

And I was home.

My shower. My drain. My terrible pressure.

Relief flooded me. Maybe the portal had finally stopped.

Then—

The door handle turned.

I froze.

I live alone.

The handle rattled, harder this time. Then a voice.

Low. Wrong.

“You don’t belong here.”

The door burst open.

And the last thing I saw—

Was myself.

Dripping. Smiling.

Stepping into the shower.

And pulling the curtain closed.
