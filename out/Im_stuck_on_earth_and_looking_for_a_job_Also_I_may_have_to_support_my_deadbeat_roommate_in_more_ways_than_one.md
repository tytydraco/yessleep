Hello, Reddit, this is Evangeline Shirley, still not native to the human world, still unemployed. This is about the roommate I mentioned in [yesterday’s post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I didn’t plan on updating this… blog? thread? so soon, but I’m jobless and I’ve got nothing better to do. On top of that, something very surprising has happened; so here it is.

Two years ago, I met and moved in with a person by the name of Kit Sutton. She’s my age, and at the time, she appeared to have a stable income. She seemed friendly and responsible enough, and seeing as I was looking desperately for someone to share rent with, I didn’t really think things over. We chose a very small, two-bedroom apartment in an admittedly bad but more affordable part of town. Our furniture consists of haggled down old items mostly found on yard sales or the roadside. After all, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure, or so they say. Either way, things were going well at first. Rent was much cheaper divided by two, chores were completed in a turn-based system and food and household purchases were shared. Apart from using the word “actually” in nearly every sentence, Kit seemed to be alright.

Then she started showing her true colors and things turned sour.

I soon found out that my roommate was actually out of a job and had a habit of disappearing for days on end without so much as giving me a heads-up. The definition of deadbeat. We actually hadn't seen each other in two weeks when I ran into her at Tom’s Diner today. The diner is one of the places Nettie and I have come to frequent. The food there is cheap enough that even I can afford it.

I'd been hoping to grab a quick bite, and lo and behold, there she was. Impossible to overlook with her dyed blue sidecut and baggy sportswear. The faded red of the booth she was sitting in clashed with the subdued black and gray of her crop top and sweatpants.

"There you are! I was hoping I'd catch you here.” She rose to her feet upon taking note of me.

I felt anger bubble up inside me. Coming to a halt, I crossed my arms in front of my chest, fixing her with an icy glare.

"Equal parts hoping and dreading, actually," she added, scratching the shaved side of her head.

"Kit Sutton," I said in a low voice, deliberation weighing down each word. "I paid rent this month. Alone. *Speak.*"

"I'm sorry, okay? I had to leave in a hurry; something came up…"

"What was it? You don't work; what was so important that you had to leave me to cover for you *again*?"

"I mean it, I had to go! You wouldn't understand. But I'm sorry, I really am! And it won't happen again, I promise."

"Oh, you *promise*! Well, that changes everything!" It's not often that I employ sarcasm. Most of the time, I don't really know how to use it. That particular situation simply seemed to call for it, though. 

Footsteps drew my attention, and I turned to find that the waiter had come up behind us. "Everything alright?" he asked.

Briefly distracted and wanting to maintain decorum, I allowed Kit to pull me down onto the padded bench of her booth. "We're fine," she assured him. "We'll each have a chai latte, please."

The waiter grinned, shaking his head. "I don't think so." 

He'd vanished before Kit could protest, reappearing moments later to place a tall glass of coconut water in front of me. I smiled at him and he winked. I go there a lot.

"Chai latte will be up in a minute," he told Kit over his shoulder as he marched off again.

I took a quick, grateful sip before focusing on my roommate again. "You have ten seconds. Go."

"I got a call from an old friend of mine. I *had* to come and see them, they were in trouble..."

I shook my head. "This is the fourth time you've done this. I've reached my limit. I'm at a point where I'm basically supporting you financially. You never even buy your own food anymore. I feel like I'm running a hotel, except if I was, I'd at least be getting money when you leave."

Her face fell. "No, Evangeline, please no, please don't throw me out…"

"The fourth time."

"I know, but I'm not gonna do it again, I swear," she pleaded. "I'll make it up to you. I’ve got some money right now, I can pay up! And I'll find work, I'll figure something out, just give me one more shot."

"You’ve said that every time. It's exhausting."

Kit hung her head, looking utterly crestfallen. "I'm sorry. Can I… can I at least come over one last time, pick up my stuff?"

"Yes."

"Actually, can I take a bath there one last time?"

"You can stay until you’ve found something else. I’ll help you look. Also, I'll get back to you about the bills. You owe me," I reminded her.

"Yeah, I'm sorry. Damn, I'm gonna… I'm gonna miss the apartment. Gonna miss you."

"Don't try guilting me. You're barely around; I hardly know you at all," I deadpanned, downing the rest of my water as the waiter reappeared to bring Kit her drink. 

"I wasn't—whatever. Is there anything at all I could say to change your mind?" She wrapped her hands around her mug, black fingernails tapping the rim. "I always liked you. I mean it. I wish you'd let me stay."

"I wish you'd pay the bills."

"But I really will! Just give me a chance to find something stable. It's not easy getting by on just gigs!"

"And I would understand that if you weren't always so dodgy. I'm not going back and forth with you on this again." I rolled my shoulders, wishing the oncoming tension away. "To put it plainly, I do not trust you. I think you can see why."

I was fresh out of appetite, so we returned home on that note. Parting with Kit was more painful than expected, but I figured it was about time I set some boundaries. Nettie Peterson had always warned me of her. The two of them had met on a couple occasions and never really hit it off—my savior human was of the firm conviction that Kit was abusing my trust. In hindsight, she’d had a point. I don’t know why I didn’t act on her concerns sooner. Normally, I would jump to follow any and all advice my best friend gave me, but I guess I had simply grown accustomed to having Sutton around. She wasn’t an unpleasant character by any means; charming, funny, entertaining… I liked her music, too. She played the guitar and sang, occasionally in the streets or on the plaza with a hat on the ground in front of her. She’d happily accept any gigs that came her way. Whenever she was home, the apartment would be alive with her singing. 

I stifled a yawn as we walked. "Written any new songs lately?"

My half-hearted attempt at conversation was met with more enthusiasm than necessary. “Actually, yes! I haven’t been able to make heads or tails of it yet, but I’ve got some new lyric bits that are gonna add up to something really cool, I think. The working title is Sewer Rat Parade.”

“That is an intriguing title. You shouldn’t change it.”

“Right? I actually thought the same thing!”

“Nettie Peterson says your music’s weird, but I think she simply doesn’t get it,” I remarked.

"Nettie doesn't like my songs?" Kit looked crestfallen.

“Don't worry. They're great. Whatever you do, I really hope you’ll get famous someday. You should be.” I don’t know what possessed me to voice my thoughts like that, but despite the hard feelings, I figured she deserved some honest praise.

She jumped into the bathtub as soon as we got home while I sat down on our rancid old couch and picked up a book Nettie had lent to me a little while ago. Anne Of Green Gables. One of her classes was reading it and she decided I should, too, especially since she had named me after the main character. Anne Shirley, Evangeline Shirley. I have to say, I’m glad she came up with that; it is an absolutely lovely story. It somehow makes me wish I’d had my infancy stage on this planet, being cared for by human breeders. Their love seems so fragile and tender. Due to reasons unknown, I find myself yearning for that kind of devotion. It’s the strangest thing, how can I miss something I’ve never known?

So there I sat, completely absorbed, when an ear-piercing scream tore me out of my reverie. I immediately jumped up and ran for the bathroom door. "Kit? Are you alright?" I bellowed.

"Don't come in here!" she yelled back, her voice muffled as if through gritted teeth. "Stay out!"

My fingers were trembling, so I clenched them into fists and started pounding on the door. "What's going on in there?"

"I'm okay!" Kit barked, the fear in her shrill tone betraying her words. "I can handle it!"

"Handle what?"

No response. Just a low "oh shit, oh shit, oh shit" coming from the other side. 

"Kit?" I called out again, heart pounding like a sledgehammer. "Kit!"

A choked gurgling rang out from inside.

Fuck this. 

"I'm coming in!" I shouted. With that, I threw open the door only to freeze mid-step through the frame. 

Kit was cowering at the far end of the bathtub, arms outstretched and clinging to the towel rail. Her face was bright red, tears gushing out from her eyes. There was something wrapped around her neck, something wet and disgusting that reminded me of a furry dirty-blond snake with blue streaks. For a beat, I only stared at it in horror. Then I realized it. It was an amalgamation of hair, *our hair*, all fused and mixed up into one long, animate rope born from the shower drain. One of its ends had snaked around my roommate's throat and was in the process of squeezing the air out of her while another two had shackled her ankles. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and for a moment, I was almost paralyzed with fright. Considering my own inhuman nature, you'd think I would be less susceptible to such feelings of terror, but surprise… I'm not.

The panic in Kit's eyes was raw, true and palpable enough for me to snap out of it. Without thinking about it twice, I sprung into action. I grabbed onto the hair rope, its moist squishiness sending chills up my spine as my face twisted into a grimace of revulsion and distress. I held my breath and *pulled*, tearing at the living restraints with all my might. My muscles straining, I held against the strength of the sewer hair, employing every last bit of my own until finally, *finally*—it snapped. I was sent stumbling back and falling down on my behind, groaning in pain as I struggled to get back up. But it had worked. Kit had climbed out of the tub and, clutching her throat, began staggering over to the door, gasping for air. She was looking at me with wide, horrified eyes.

"Get the pipe cleaner!" I shouted.

She rasped out a sharp sound of affirmation and ran for the kitchen cupboard, naked feet rapidly slapping the linoleum floor. She returned within a few seconds, the bottle already unscrewed as she thrust it into my hands. I lunged at the writhing bits of hair snake squirming around in the bathtub and mercilessly poured the cleaning liquid out on top of them. They started struggling even harder, their movements growing frantic before they fell limp and shrank away, disappearing down the drain. I stared at the tub, my chest heaving as my pulse finally began to slow. Once I had regained some semblance of composure, I dumped the rest of the pipe cleaner in after them. 

Dropping the bottle, I turned and sank down to sit on the side of the bathtub. Kit was standing in front of me, her lean, muscular body trembling even though she didn't seem to notice. She still had the same look of abject terror on her face as before, her blank stare fixing me while she stood just as motionless, not even moving to cover herself up. 

"Why are there tentacles coming out of your back?" she asked in a whisper.

"Oh."

"You… you ripped that hair-thing apart with them. They popped up when you came in."

"Oops. Wait, I wasn't using my hands for that?"

"No, Eva. You were using your back-tentacles."

I craned my neck to catch a glance at them, and sure enough, there they were. Four of them, right there behind me, black and ooze-y and squirmy. Too bad about my shirt. They had torn right through it. I sighed, squeezing them back in. "Excuse me. That's just a thing my body does sometimes."

"Oh. I-I see." She began stroking her arms nervously before finally bending down to reach for the towel that was lying in a heap on the floor.

"May I ask why you were attacked by an amalgamation of our shower hair?" I inquired. "You seem to know something about that."

She pursed her lips, nodding stiffly. “I guess there’s a lot the two of us don’t know about each other.”

“Kit?”

“I gave up a lot to be the person I am today. I had to leave a lot of things behind, a lot of… people. Some of them want me back. That’s why I disappear sometimes.” Her voice was soft and husky as she buried her face in the towel, drying off her shock of blue hair. “Everytime I make it back, it’s honestly a bit of a surprise to me.”

“Who’s after you?”

“It’d be much easier if you didn’t know.”

“Seems like you need me to, though. How am I supposed to protect you if I have no idea what from?” I asked softly.

“Aren’t you gonna throw me out anymore?”

I shook my head. “You’re in trouble. And Nettie says when people are in trouble, you’re obligated to help them.”

“Then I guess I’m glad she taught that to you.” Slinging the towel over her shoulders, she gave me a shrug. “No need to wear clothes in front of you anymore now, is there?”

“Please do. It's weird."

“I know, Eva. Fuck… I need to go lie down.” She stopped just short of passing the doorway. “Hey, um… thank you. I owe you big time.”

“Pay your bills.”

This spells trouble, no doubt. I have enough on my plate already, as the saying goes, but I'm not about to leave Kit Sutton, terrible roommate though she is, to what would surely be a cruel fate. Who knows what she's involved in, but I am rather set on finding out. Any advice is welcome. I for one don't know what to make of this.
