I began reading without realizing that I was about to embark on a horrific journey into the depths of horror.  
  
The first few pages were full of mundane, everyday stories, but the further I read, the darker the entries became. The writer reported inexplicable noises and frightening shadows wandering through his house. I shook my head, trying to get the eerie thought out of my head.  
  
In the days that followed I heard strange noises in my apartment - a faint whispering that seemed to be coming from the walls. My heart was pounding with fear as I kept looking around, but there was nothing to be seen. I pushed thoughts of the journal aside and did my best to ignore the eerie incidents.  
  
But events took a dark turn when nightmarish visions plagued my sleep. Shadowy figures crawled along the walls while an icy chill ran down my spine. I woke up in a sweat, but the ominous presence didn't seem to want to leave my side even while I was awake.  
  
In the diary I found other disturbing entries about the dark forces that afflicted the author. He wrote of insomnia, loss of sanity, and an insatiable need for answers. I couldn't believe how similar our experiences were.  
  
One evening when I was home alone, I heard a loud creaking and popping in the hallway. My heart was beating wildly as I slowly made my way to check. A figure in tattered clothing stood in the hallway, eyes blank. I stared at her and could hardly believe my eyes. It was a terrifying apparition that seemed to be staring straight at me from the diary.  
  
I ran back to my room in a panic and grabbed the diary. I read desperately for a way out of this nightmare. The author described an ancient ritual intended to banish the dark forces. It was risky, but I felt I had no other choice.  
  
The following night I began to perform the ritual. Candles flickered in the dim light and incense gave off a strange scent. I recited the words written in the journal, hoping they would free me from the eerie presence.  
  
But the deeper I delved into the ritual, the more I felt the Presence thicken around me. The room filled with cold air and I heard an eerie whisper that made my blood run cold.  
  
Suddenly I felt an icy breeze on my neck. I turned and saw the figure from the journal standing right in front of me. "You can't escape," it whispered in a somber voice. "I found you, and now you're mine."  
  
In a last ditch effort to end the ritual, I summoned the remaining energy and closed my eyes. Everything went black around me and a bloodcurdling scream pounded in my ears.  
  
When I opened my eyes again, the figure was gone. The room felt empty and peaceful. Did the ritual work? I didn't know for sure, but the ominous presence actually seemed to have vanished.  
  
Since that night I have hidden the diary in a secret place and am trying to forget the terrible incident. But sometimes, when I'm alone, I still feel an eerie chill that chills my blood and I wonder if the dark forces are just waiting to strike again.
