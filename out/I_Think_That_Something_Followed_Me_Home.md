I (18f) work at a gas station, it’s maybe a 10 minute walk from my Moms house and I’m one of those people that doesn’t have their drivers license yet. I’m usually scheduled in the morning but my manager had put me down for a night shift that coming Friday. I don’t live in a bad part of town, in fact one could say it’s pretty great, but being a shorter than average girl and fairly attractive I really don’t like walking when it’s dark out. Now during my shift last night one of my friends had agreed to pick me up after but unfortunately something had come up and I was stuck walking home in the dark. I got everything done so that the shift after me would have a pretty easy night and as soon as my replacement came I was out the door.  
Now you’re probably wondering why I didn’t ask my coworker for a lift, and while that would probably have been better than walking alone I just didn’t trust the guy. He was this tall lanky man with a beard and tattoos covering his whole body; I’m surprised he was even hired in the first place. I also never worked with him but he was always on the 3rd shift so when me and my friends would come for some slushies he’d be at the counter keeping a suspiciously close eye on us, so clearly I just didn’t trust this guy with my life.  
Which was probably a good idea as when I was halfway back home I felt someone staring at me and when I looked behind me there was this tall silhouette of a person just standing there watching me. I couldn’t exactly see their face through the darkness but their eyes seemed to reflect like that of a cat. I was freaked out at this point so I kept walking but I could still feel the person staring at me and looking back once more they were still there. It was around this time that a car drove past with its lights on and I got a glimpse of the figures face. It was my coworker but his eyes were blank and dull though slightly reflective and a twisted smile stretched across his face. It didn’t look like the man I had seen no less than 10 minutes ago. What’s even worse is that he just looked taller, like he was wearing heels or grew a foot or so. As soon as the light hit his face and my brain registered what I was seeing I booked it.  
Thankfully whatever my coworker was doing he stopped once I began to run and even though I fumbled with unlocking my door I made it safely back home without seeing him again. I’m reporting him to the manager when I go into my shift today and hopefully they’ll finally get rid of him.  
Edit: When I went into work today the store was surrounded by police, the manager must have been too busy to call me due to all of the questioning but turns out my coworker had been found in the breakroom, or at least they think it’s him. The body had been skinned almost perfectly and now I’m kind of really freaked. I asked my friend to sleep over, as they say there’s safety in numbers.  
Edit 2: My friend never made it to my door, whatever's outside is not my coworker and it keeps calling for me, it sounds like Samantha, it’s begging for me to open my door. I called the police and they should be on their way but I don’t think they sent anyone, I don’t think they believed me
