I’m 16, and I work at the local grocery store. I’ve had the job for about a year now. Since I’m still in high school, I don’t work during the day. I usually get scheduled for three weekday shifts, mostly closing from 6 to 10.

This past Wednesday seemed like a normal night. It was around 9, maybe 9:30, and I was just waiting for my shift to end. I was up near the front of the store, restocking cans, when I noticed a man walk in.

I’m not great at guessing ages, but he looked like he was around 40. He was average height, maybe 5’10”, and had this really pale skin, like he hadn’t been outside in a long time. His clothes didn’t look dirty or anything, but they felt…off. Almost like they didn’t fit quite right, like he had put on someone else’s outfit. It was a plain gray hoodie and black jeans, but the hoodie sat too tight around the neck, and the sleeves were too short.

What caught my attention, was the way he moved. He looked stiff. Like, inhumanly stiff. He was walking as if he didn’t have any joints, just kind of rigid and unnatural. His arms hung straight at his sides, barely swinging, and his feet hit the floor hard with every step. It creeped me out a little, but I ignored it and kept working.

A few minutes later, I finished and my manager told me to restock some more things near the back of the store. So I grabbed the cart and headed back.

And then the man appeared again. Same strange walk. He looked like he was searching for something but had no idea what it was.

When he noticed me, he walked over and asked where the soda was. His voice was haunting: cold and flat, like there was no emotion behind it. It made me feel uneasy. Up close, his face looked wrong. Not scary, just wrong. His skin was smooth in a way that didn’t look natural, almost plastic. His eyes were sunken, but not in a tired way, they just looked hollow. And the weirdest part was how he blinked. It was slow, like someone acting out what blinking is supposed to look like.

I told him what aisle it was in, and then he did something that really freaked me out: he repeated my exact sentence word for word, then said “thank you.”

That might not sound super weird, but in the moment, it felt… off. I finished up and went back to my manager. I looked around for the guy, but I couldn’t find him anywhere. He must’ve left. I asked my manager if she’d seen him, but she said no. I asked the cashier later, and he said she had noticed his weird walk, but he hadn’t bought anything.

I went home and tried to forget about it, but I had trouble sleeping. I kept thinking about his face. It was uncanny. Like a copy of a real person. It just didn’t feel right. It’s been a few days, and I still can’t get his face, or the way he walked, out of my head.
