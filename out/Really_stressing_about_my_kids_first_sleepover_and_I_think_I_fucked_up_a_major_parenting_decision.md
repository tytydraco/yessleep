Yes, it was awkward as my son and I drove through the woods in complete silence. Sure, he’s getting to that age where it’s harder to strike up a conversation, [but the bigger issue was the stench of decay emanating from the rolled up rug in the back](https://redd.it/14xlmtu). I probably should have asked him what was in it.

But I didn’t.

I had finally resolved to broach the subject when he spoke first. “Turn here, Dad.”

I slowed the car. “This is a logging road. I’m not sure a 1999 Toyota Corolla can handle it.”

“It can. Trust me, Dad, you’ll be fine.”

I felt hypnotic as I followed his instructions without understanding why. 

Upon reflection, it was entirely possible that both my eleven-year-old child and I had independently made multiple poor choices during this entire ordeal.

“Behind this tree,” he announced. 

I stopped the car and got out, looking nervously around. “You can’t even see this spot from the logging road,” I noted aloud. “It’s completely hidden.”

Without a word, he reached behind a tree and pulled out two shovels, handing me one.

“Okay,” I heaved. “This has to stop. Tell me what’s going on, or I’m getting back in the car and taking us both home.”

He either didn’t hear me, or he gave an Oscar-worthy performance of acting like it. Instead, he started digging. I stood and watched for a full minute, awkwardly considering my choices. 

I couldn’t drive back without my son.

He wasn’t going to listen to me. 

And I couldn’t bear the thought of standing in the middle of Logging Road 1913 as he dug a hole in the ground for the next hour.

The two of us worked efficiently together. To be honest, it was the first time in a while that I felt we were both on the same page. It would have been a great father/son bonding moment under different circumstances.

“Okay,” he heaved when we’d dug a hole that was two feet deep. “Now the rug.”

I’d convinced myself that I could stop thinking for just a moment about why we were there; now I had to face reality. I opened my mouth to speak.

No words came out. What could I possibly say?

He grunted as the rug fell from the car with a *splat*. With determined efficiency, he rolled it to the hole we’d dug.

I said a silent prayer of thanks that it didn’t unravel, which allowed me to continue the illusion that I didn’t know what was inside. Grimy dirt and clay caked the rug as he pushed it forward, soiling his hands and fingernails as I stood back and watched. Within a few seconds, he had rolled the bundle into the hole we dug.

It was a perfect fit.

I shook my head, refusing to believe what I was seeing. 

Then the rug groaned. The noise swelled, like something inside of it was experiencing deep pain.

My breath stopped, my heart chilled, and fear crept into each one of my 206 bones as the bulge slowly expanded. 

Something was trying to get out of the rug. 

My head spun. Every possibility was horrible, but one thought had a silver lining:

If something was still alive, this entire nightmare could be reversed. We could unroll the rug, offer medical care, maybe even pay someone off, and forget that this whole thing happened. 

All things considered, it was the best we could hope for.

*CRACK*

My son smashed his shovel against the rug with more force that I had thought him capable of generating.

The rug stopped moving.

He turned to face me. The look of icy determination in his eyes was enough to send chills through my taint. 

“Well,” he breathed. “Start digging.”

He tossed the first shovelful of dirt onto the rug, which remained statue-still.

I didn’t know what to do.

So I stepped aside to type this up on my phone. In just a moment, I’ll help him, because I don’t see any other option. [Any insight would be appreciated](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
