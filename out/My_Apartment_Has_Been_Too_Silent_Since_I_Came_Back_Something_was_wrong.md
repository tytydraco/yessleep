Recently, I moved to a small town to start college and seek new opportunities away from home. As soon as I arrived, I was desperate to find a place that was both affordable and cozy. Fortunately, I found one: a small apartment in a distant neighborhood. Although it’s far from college, the tranquility of being away from the small local population brings me some comfort. I've always been a reserved person, someone who prefers a movie night to going out to parties with friends.



My classes are at night since I spend my mornings and afternoons working at a local supermarket to maintain my standard of living, which isn’t cheap in this little town. Despite having fewer than 28,000 inhabitants, everything here is absurdly expensive, far above the standards of larger cities. I don’t know exactly why, but this situation intrigues me.



Yesterday, I got home later than usual because the professor was late, extending the class. When I stopped at my apartment door, I was greeted by a faint, flickering light — a rather unwelcoming "welcome." The building’s appearance doesn’t help: the originally beige walls are peeling, revealing a mold-covered white beneath. The rusty intercom doesn’t inspire confidence, but I press it anyway. The light flickers again. "At least the rent is affordable," I think to myself.



Minutes pass with no response, only the static from the speaker breaking the silence of the deserted street. I insist, pressing the intercom again, and the sound echoes loudly, amplified by the emptiness of the night. Still nothing.



Growing impatient and shivering from the cold, I’m about to press it again when I hear the sound of locks being undone. The door opens slightly, revealing a narrow gap. It catches me off guard. Usually, Jaime, the doorman, would block any entry, questioning the purpose of the visit. Seeing the door unlocked, without Jaime’s usual questioning, unsettles me. There’s something strange in the air, a discomfort I can’t ignore.



I step in and close the door behind me, causing a loud noise that echoes through the central hallway walls. A long red carpet stretches ahead of me, as if inviting me to walk toward the stairs and finally reach my apartment. I move slowly, careful not to make noise. It’s late, and the last thing I want is to disturb the other residents.



But something bothers me: it’s too quiet. No muffled conversations, no footsteps upstairs, no TVs on, no children crying. An absolute, almost oppressive silence.



Before I realize it, I’m in front of my apartment door. The number 12 is engraved on a worn and rusty metal plaque. The “1” seems tilted compared to the “2,” as if desperately begging for repair.



I turn the key in the lock, push the door open, and switch on the light. The room lights up, revealing my small haven. Everything seems in place, exactly as I left it. I place my keys and phone on the desk and head to the bedroom to grab some clothes for a shower.



During the shower, I can’t shake the strange feeling that something is off. The entire building feels abandoned, as if all the residents decided to leave at once. The hot water runs down my body, and the sound of it hitting the shower floor is almost deafening in the absolute silence. Since I got off the bus and entered the apartment, I haven’t heard a single car pass by, a dog bark, or any other sound indicating life around me.



Now, I’m in my pajamas, sitting on the bed with my laptop on my lap, writing this post to share what’s happening. The dim light of the bedside lamp illuminates the room, casting flickering shadows on the walls, while the silence around me feels almost tangible. I decided to document everything, in case something strange happens, because this sense of emptiness won’t leave my mind.



My thoughts keep searching for explanations. Did the neighbors really leave? Maybe the building is under renovation, and they forgot to inform me. Or is it just my paranoia? As if this has always been normal, but I never noticed because of my busy routine. But no matter how much I try to rationalize, something doesn’t feel right.



Even though nothing has actually happened, the tension in the air is almost suffocating. I’ve decided that documenting this might be important — for myself or for whoever comes after.



If something strange happens, at least you’ll know I tried to tell my story.
