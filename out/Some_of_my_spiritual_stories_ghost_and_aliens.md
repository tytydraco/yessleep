So when I was in high school is this entity that lives in my house and they will definitely dark and so I was watching Family Guy and I decided to make a hot pocket and some Kool-Aid and Iâ€™m watching TV for over an hour and a half but after I turn off the lights and the TV and Iâ€™ll leave the vicinity from the living room all of a sudden my sisterâ€™s toy dog starts to bark and I was like what that makes no sense. 

Let me go see what I think Iâ€™m hearing. And so after I go to the living room, her toys dog literally turns his head to look at me and in that moment I said fuck this and I dipped my ass upstairs, but coming down the next day I look at the toy the toy was not on try me or the other settings to where itâ€™s every 15 minutes and so I asked my grandma did my mom or any of you guys turn off the toy and they said no and so I was just one of those instances or experiences that Iâ€™ve dealt with at the house. My sister has seen spirits there. Oh my uncle and my cousin has seen spirits. Theyâ€™re my friends, and all of them has seen spirits there so clearly I wasnâ€™t crazy.lol ðŸ¤£ 

so another one of the stories that Iâ€™ve experience is, Iâ€™m an Astro traveler I fell out of religion, but I fell back into religion being older, and Iâ€™ve experience a lot of crazy journeys through astral projection which you know all religions talk about it supposedly itâ€™s  supposed to be the highest form of what you could be spiritually

because at that moment youâ€™re connected to your soul and your soul and you is tied to one but yeah, I have a I got to meet this one race outside of the universe and when I decided to go up to space because my home is the beach I love the ocean my favorite animal is a killer whale thereâ€™s something about them. 

I just love them, but I love the ocean and their soul, I just had to fly up that day to test whatâ€™s out there in space and once I got to the breaking point between our planet in space, thereâ€™s a beam of light hit me and once the beam light hit me I was fine for a second, 

but then I freaked the fuck out and I think it and then I came back to seeing the earth being at the bottom of my feet, descending faster and faster and faster and I was like what the fuck and so I think it again and so that race that I met him there not like something that you would think of. 

Theyâ€™re not gray they donâ€™t look like anything that you would think of anything in the movie or whatever or even trying to read religions, but reading from Asian religions, it would kind of makes sense because they donâ€™t look like us or of what weâ€™ve created for aliens 

that we created and it was kind of shocking, but they were able to talk to me telepathically and I asked him why donâ€™t you talk to me physically or or you know something such like why donâ€™t you talk to me like that and they tried talking verbally to me and the person said telepathically after did you understand anything I said, and I said no 

but I asked him how do they make their crafts and he said we make our objects/planes and ships and all that stuff way more complicated than what it is to be and I was like what what do you mean!!! and he showed me but out of all the experiences that Iâ€™ve experience only certain experiences I canâ€™t remember them 

and what I mean by that is I remember everything that I experience I remember seeing him write it out on a chalkboard like itâ€™s math but every time heâ€™s riding itâ€™s a racing behind when heâ€™s riding and so for some reason Iâ€™m not be able to remember that but I able to remember everything else that Iâ€™ve experienced 

one of the other things Iâ€™ve been to heaven honestly itâ€™s one of the most beautiful things to ever see but do you know what this race do you know how I got to test drive a UFO which is pretty crazy but from my best experience is from being inside of it we all have guardian angels. 

Also, we are all technically fallen angels. Thatâ€™s something that no one wants to talk about but if all the fallen angels mated with humans overtime yeah but man being inside of the craft you can be from here and go to light speed 100 whatever it is youâ€™re seeing 

you literally skate across the lands like itâ€™s going by so fast and it doesnâ€™t make any sense but at the same time itâ€™s very shocking/remarkable because itâ€™s something beautiful and so I do think God our creator for allowing me not just to see spirit since I was seven and stuff going to 30 but Iâ€™m allowed to see these extra things and be able to understand it and break it down, so thatâ€™s just my story thatâ€™s me
