[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/6qofzBC60i) 
So we left off where I told him to go home. If you haven’t read Part I please go read that before continuing.

That night I contemplated telling my mom, or his mom. But who would believe me, oh my friend is acting weird and he’s probably a skinwalker or something. 

For the record I’ve never held any faith in the supernatural or anything religious, I know little to nothing about that kind of stuff besides baseline info you see on the internet. All I know is they can turn into animals and sometimes even people. 

I think whatever was out there that night killed Kane and crawled into his body or took the form of his body. Whatever happened, that’s not Kane. After that night I knew that. I woke up in the middle of the night, there was a dog viciously barking outside my house, when I looked outside I could see someone walking away. I think it was Kane. 

The next day I didn’t really hear from him, I spent all day hanging out at the house and even invited my girlfriend Kim over, we watched a horror movie and helped my sister with a science project since her spring break wasn’t as long as ours. 

In the middle of us all building a model of the solar system, easy grade A science project, there was a knock at the door. I got up to answer it and was surprised to see Kane’s dad standing at my door. 

“Hey Joshua, Kane isn’t here what’s up?”

He had this intense look on his face like he was about to bite his lip off, “Fuck- Sorry.” He spoke frantically. “He’s really not here?”

I stepped outside on the front porch and closed the front door. “What’s going on?”

“Kane kept leaving and coming back home last night. When his mom confronted him about it he didn’t say a word.”

“Yeah he was acting-“

“That’s not it Shawn. She got mad and raised her voice a bit as she tends to do when she’s frustrated, and he turned around and smacked her down to the ground.”

I looked at my friend’s dad and felt the desire to vomit everywhere. I wanted to tell him what happened, that I didn’t know what was going on but something was wrong with his son. I had no idea what to say, anything I could piece together would sound insane.

I looked at him, grim written all over my face. “I’m so sorry, if there’s anything we can do let us know.”

He looked at me like he knew I was hiding something, but he simply nodded and walked back to his car. When I walked inside I felt like fainting, what the fuck was wrong with Kane, he would never hit his mom, they had their struggles but he loved her more than anyone.

I stepped inside my sister’s room and that’s when I saw it. A squirrel sat outside the window, perching with its beady black eyes darting around the room but when it locked eyes with me it didn’t flinch. My heart skipped a beat before I came rushing at the window banging at it, it maintained eye contact. When my girlfriend and sister looked over it finally ran off and I felt insane. 

“Babe what are you doing?”

“Why would you scare a squirrel like that!”

Not able to come up with a rational explanation I said the first thing to come to mind, “I uh- It was acting weird.”

“What?” My girlfriend raised her eyebrow at me.

“I thought it might have rabies or something.”

It was dismissed and we finished up my sister’s project. That’s when I got another knock at my door. This time it was Kane.

“Uh- Hey. I just saw your dad. What happened with your mom?”

“Who?”

My gut tightened all over again. “Right. It’s late you should get home.”

“Can I stay here?”

“Why?”

“Can’t go home.” 

At the speed he responded it was like he was on drugs, I couldn’t stand to see my friend like this. Maybe I was wrong, maybe something happened in the woods and he’s changed and he needs someone to talk to, maybe I can help him. 

“I guess so.”

Kim ended up heading out when he arrived because the sun was going down, I gave her a kiss on the cheek and squeezed her hand tight before she left. Me and Kane were in my room, I got distracted on my phone as usual, but when I looked up at him he was staring out, past the hallway into the kitchen, watching my mom.

Both times, my mother and sister, it seemed like he didn’t have perverted or malicious intent. It was like he was studying them. 

“Hey Kane.”

He didn’t say anything but turned his head and fixed his gaze on me.

“What happened in the woods when we were camping?” 

He looked irritated at the subject being brought up, “Don’t want to talk about it.”

“Kane it seems like something bad happened and maybe you should talk about it.” 

For a split second he gave me a look that made it feel like my friend was back, a look that rationalized the concern I had for him and was ready to talk about it. But then his face returned back to the empty callous soulless husk of what used to be my friend. 

“Kane.” 

“Quiet!”

The sudden increase in his volume made me jump. Then my mom appeared in the doorway.

That was the only time I’ve seen him smile since we got back, he turned around and cheerfully said to my mother, “Yeah, just a dumb argument. Sorry for raising my voice.” 

That’s when I realised he wasn’t talking like Kane would, he was talking like I do. Using my mannerisms and tone, specifically the tone I use when speaking to my mother. This shook me to my very core.

My mother smiled, “Okay, be nice to each other, you guys have been friends since you were kids.” She walked back into the kitchen and Kane locked eyes with me. 

“Dude what the fuck is wrong with you lately.” 

He just stared at me, I hated this, I wanted to help my friend so desperately.

“Kane please talk to me, I want to help you.”

“They’re going to find out.” 

“What? What’re you talking about?”

“They all know. You know.” 

I didn’t respond and we both went silent, at the time I didn’t know what he meant, but now I wish I didn’t, I wish I never went camping with him. 

He sat with us for dinner but didn’t eat anything, we all talked about our days while he just watched, anytime my mom asked him something he smiled and responded, anytime her focus wasn’t on him he just stared at all of us, watching the way we ate, the way we talked, the way we got upset. 

That night I knew I was not staying the night with my troubled friend. I knew whatever was in my house was a danger to me and my family, but I couldn’t do anything, I couldn’t fight him, I couldn’t tell anyone. So we laid down for bed and I ignored it and went to sleep. 

I slept peacefully, as peacefully as you could. My dreams were filled with the estranged themes that have popped up in my life. When I woke up in a panicked sweat I was met with Kane’s eyes soullessly staring into mine but it wasn’t like he was looking at me, it was like he was looking into me.

“What the fuck are you doing!”

“Trying to- Ugh- I don’t know, figure it out.”

“Kane what the fuck is wrong with you?!”

“Nothing.” 

I couldn’t help it, tears started falling from my eyes, “This isn’t you, what are you? what do you want?”

“I can’t play Kane for long.” The smile that stretched across this strangers face was so disturbing and freakishly inhumane my brain couldn’t even process what was happening anymore 

“Please get out.” 

Like that he just left, when I looked out my window I didn’t even see him walking away. The things he was saying weren’t making sense, why the fuck would something take my friend, not even attempt to pretend to be him and now it’s stalking me and my family. I couldn’t fit the puzzle pieces together but I knew it was solemnly up to me. Tomorrow I can catch you up the rest of the way, I have to prepare for what is coming.
