(Part I)
Like the title suggests my friend has 
been acting weird since we went camping. But today it got a lot worse. To understand we need to go back to beginning.

We’re in our senior year of high school, we live in Portland Oregon, so we figured for spring break let’s get out the city and spend some quality time together camping in the wilderness.

Something you need to have a concept of beforehand is my friend, Kane, is a very up person, he’s energetic and he’s almost always happy, rarely seen him angry. 

He’s a kind guy who wants to spread kindness, so when I tell you this story keep that in mind. 

This all started 3 days ago on the last night of our camping trip. That day I told Kane I was hearing some weird noises in the woods, birds calling would morph into wolfs howling without intermission. 

When presented with this, Kane said, “Shawn you’re just paranoid, you’re so used to busses honking and cars tires screeching you’re overthinking the forest noises.”

“I don’t know man, it’s just freaking me out that’s all.” Kane put his hand on my shoulder and gave me the most genuine grin you could ever see.

“Calm down man, we’re fine. It’s just me and you out here, let’s have some fun.”

That day we went fishing at a river on the mountain we were camping on, we ended up swimming too but the water was ice cold so that didn’t last long. Kane caught a 8 inch bass which we ended up cooking for dinner over a fire along with some canned green beans I had brought, a small dinner but damn did it feel good to catch your own food, or in this case have your friend do it.

After dinner we retired to our own tents and winded down for bed, while I reached for my overhead lantern I heard footsteps, they were light like a coyotes or something that size, they were slow and they circled our camp site. 

At first I wanted to reach for the zipper of my tent but my primal instincts told me that was a bad idea. The footsteps circled until they became closer and heavier, suddenly I heard the zip of Kane’s tent. 

My attempt to whisper came out as a sort of yell whisper, “Kane what the fuck are you doing?”

“Checking it out dipshit what do you mean?”

“But it could be a wolf or something.”

“I got my deer knife chill out ya wuss, I’ll be fine.” 

It was then I noticed the initial footsteps had ended, it was completely silent, no crickets, birds, nothing, like every forest animal was anticipating a predator. I heard Kane’s footsteps circle the site before departing from hearing range. As I heard his footsteps trail off a sickening tightening feeling in my stomach occurred.

I waited anxiously until I heard footsteps in the distance, immediately I hopped out of my tent and in the distance I saw Kane’s outline in the shadows. But as he approached I saw his clothes were torn and dirty, a cut went from the center of his chest off to the side.

“Holy shit Kane what happened?”

He just stared at me with the most empty look I’ve ever seen in anyone’s eyes. 

“Kane?” My voice went soft and cracked, he could probably tell I was nervous but he still said nothing.

“This isn’t funny!” 

“Night.” He said immediately and then retreated to his tent.

I couldn’t sleep that night. In the morning we packed up all our camping equipment, I noticed Kane had thrown his bloodied clothes out to the woods and changed.

Weirdly though he was wearing his swim trunks, but I could still see his boxers so I knew he wasn’t planning on swimming. Well I didn’t at the time, I was too stupid to see the obvious signs that something wasn’t right.

When we got back into town he got lost trying to find my house, to the point where I drove because he couldn’t even understand how to follow google maps, or his left from right. Kane would never get mixed up like that, much less forget his left from right.

We got back to the house and my mom had prepared us some food but Kane refused to eat it. We tried offering something else but he wouldn’t eat anything we had to give him. 

Then when I tried to get him to play video games with me, he got confused and angry, he ended up throwing my spare controller and breaking it. Then when I got distracted I caught him staring into my younger sisters room, when I yelled at him about it he said,

“I wanted to know what she does when no one is watching.” I got way too freaked me out, I told him he should probably go home. 

I probably should’ve told someone about the signs, I should’ve told my mom he was watching my sister, I should’ve done something before we got to this point. I have to go to bed so I’ll leave you off at the end of day 1.
