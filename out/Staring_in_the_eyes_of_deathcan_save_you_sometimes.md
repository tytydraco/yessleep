My home town (where I still live) is so far away from everything else in Canada that the only town closest to us is 30 minutes away (45 minutes if you go by the speed limit) and both are surrounded by Mountains, while my town is at the mouth of a Channel of water leading out to the Ocean. You can name every major Natural Predator and my town has it, Black Bears, Grizzly Bears, Wolves, Wolverines and Mountain Lions. Due to the isolation of my town my Grandfather would regularly tell me to keep a weapon on me to stay safe (though it was likely just to make me FEEL safe) so I kept an old bent rusted Hatchet in my pants (where the belt sits) with a fancy sheath on the blade (Duct Tape). My Grandfather would also drill it into my head the advise that saved me "If you find yourself face to face with a Predator then must NEVER run.....if you turn around....if you run.....you are dead"

During one night while I was visiting my mother and sisters and watching movies I decided to head home late and started walking back at 11:30pm.....as soon as I stepped outside and closed the door I instinctively knew that something was wrong. I smelled something that I had never smelled before was thick in the air.....it was a thick and heavy Wet Dog Smell that had made my nerves go on edge, so I took the Duct Tape off my Hatchet and kept it ready. While walking I kept my head on a swivel and constantly looking around me....I got crossed a 4 way street and looked to my left....standing beside a Stop Sign was Grizzly Bear. While it beside the sign I imagined myself beside it and by my estimations I would say it's head was at my Chest level while it was on all fours (I stand at 5 foot 9 by the way)....I took out my Hatchet and held it in my right hand while slowly backing away, my Grandfathers words echoed in me head "If you run....you are dead". While I was backing away I unknowingly broke a Cardinal Rule with Predators and locked eyes with it, when it comes to predators they see eye contact they see that action as a Challenge to see Who is Stronger.

As I was backing away the Grizzly was slowly walking across the street to my side....but was walking towards the tree line....still locking eyes with me and surprisingly was completely silent as it walked. At that time it was as though the world around me didn't exist, Mountains turned Black by the draping darkness of night, the normally semi busy streets now motionless with slumber....not even cars....nothing that could have helped me in a fight for my life. I slowly backed away and it slowly crossed the street and now gone....though I could not lower my guard due to the street it went down went parallel to my route back home. Still walking back home I kept my Hatchet out, not caring how it looked if someone saw me, and noticed just how quiet small towns get when night falls.....not even my footsteps on the sidewalk made noise....but I safely made it back home without any other incidents. For any who read my post find themselves in the outskirts of Canada I ask you to please adhere to my Grandfathers advise....because Death can be avoided by not giving into Fear. Stay safe.
