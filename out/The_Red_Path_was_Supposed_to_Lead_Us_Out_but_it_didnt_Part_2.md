We stood frozen in the tunnel, stagnant water pooling around our feet, watching the mass ahead breathe and slowly inch closer.

It pulsed slowly, each expansion forcing the water around it to ripple, like the chamber itself was breathing. In the dim light of Rennick’s light, I could see smaller veins along its surface – this was something alive, even though it wasn’t meant to be.

“We can’t go through that,” Rennick flatly stated.

“No,” I admitted, “But it’s blocking the only way through.”

“The blueprint could be wrong again. Maybe there’s another way,” he reasoned, though his voice carried no conviction. The walls around us didn’t have any sort of hidden mechanism, and the only path out was through *that.*

Rennick sighed and pulled off his glove just enough to check his watch, his hands trembling.

“If they told us the truth about the infection time…” he hesitated.

“…we don’t have much time.” I finished.

I crouched down, unzipped the waterproof pouch at my side and pulled out a second phone – the one I didn’t leave at home. It was small, cheap and beaten up.

Rennick stared. “You smuggling tech now?”

“Not exactly. This one’s different. He’ll save us.”

I pressed the power button, and after a long pause, a green icon appeared on screen – there was no other apps or menus.

A chat box opened automatically, and a new message appeared.

>**Anonymous**: You’re late.

Rennick blinked. “Anonymous?”

I nodded. “You know him?”

“I know *of* him. His reputation’s huge. He’s supposed to be dead, though.”

“Yeah, well lucky for us, he isn’t.”

I typed quickly: *We’re in a treatment facility.* *Tunnel’s blocked by possible Subject. Advice?*

Three dots appeared immediately.

>**Anonymous**: I can’t track you, so I won’t be able to get a layout of the place.

Rennick raised an eyebrow. “You sure this thing’s safe?”

“Safe, as long as he doesn’t sell us out.” I looked straight at Rennick, a smile beneath my suit. “So, yes.”

Another message came through:

>**Anonymous:** You have two options. Double back and risk full containment breach, or go through it and hope it lets you through.

Rennick stared at the message for a long moment. “Hope it lets us through? That’s no option, that’s a prayer.”

“Then I hope you’re religious, because we’re not risking a breach,” I said, taking a cautious step forward.

I typed back: *If it doesn’t let us through?*

>**Anonymous:** Then keep moving. Assuming you’re in hazard suits, if it touches you, cut the section off.

The mass expanded, pushing into the tunnel walls slowly but forcefully.

“If we wait any longer,” I said, “It’s just going to close the gap completely.”

Rennick swore under his breath, then aimed his flashlight into the narrow slit of open water still left between the walls and the thing’s pulsing flesh.

“Alright,” he finally said. “You’ve done worse than this.”

We moved forward together, slow but steady. The mass trembled as we approached, threads unraveling from its surface and digging deep into the water below.

One brushed against my leg. I nearly jumped back, but Anonymous’s message flashed in my head. “*Keep moving*.”

The tunnel narrowed until my shoulder touched the living entity next to us. Rennick let out an audible groan of disgust, but he gritted his teeth and pushed ahead.

Halfway through, the passage behind us darkened, and the sound of water rushing in echoed faintly. Whatever this thing was, it didn’t want us to leave.

By the time we pushed free on the other side, my chest was tight and my legs ached.

Rennick exhaled shakily. “Now we have to take all this off?”

“Not here,” I whispered back. The living wall was still pulsing behind us, and I didn’t want to risk it following or attacking.

Before we could move forward, I heard a rhythmic splash coming from up ahead, just out of sight. They were getting louder with every passing second.

I turned the phone on: *We’re through, but something’s ahead.*

>**Anonymous:** Keep your lights low – it might not notice you if you stay out of its path.

“Not comforting,” Rennick muttered, dimming his beam until it barely lit the tunnel floor.

We moved forward into a space that opened wider than I expected. I’m still not sure what it was, but I remember hearing something from above.

I froze, tilting my head just enough to see the catwalk overhead. A human shape stood there in the dark – or at least what was left of one. The person was obviously dead, but I’d rather not go into the gruesome details of it. Although I’ll share this: a mass of the same growth we just passed clung to its frame, holding it upright like a grotesque mannequin.

Rennick’s light passed over it – and the thing twitched.

I froze. “Did you--”

*Snap*. A tendril holding it up tore free, letting the body slump forward. For a second, I thought it would fall right on us. Luckily, it didn’t.

Instead, a section of the wall opposite to us opened up – not like a door, but more like an organic being, like the wall was alive. Behind it, dozens of shapes moved.

They were bodies, just like the thing on the catwalk. Some were intact, some half-dissolved, but all of them suspended inside the wall with those slick tendrils that were chasing us before.

The corpse above let out a sudden, throaty moan – and fell. It hit the water behind us with a splash, which seemed to wake the wall.

The dozens of corpses propped up with tendrils started moving their heads – scanning the room and locking onto us. Then, their hands and feet started feeling their way across the floor.

“Is this even an infection? What are we facing here?” Rennick asked, knowing I was just as much in the unknown as he was.

The water at our feet began to ripple – not from our movement, but from theirs.

One of the corpses dragged itself halfway free from the wall, its lower body still fused to the mass behind it. Its hands groped along the tunnel floor, tendons moving unnaturally with each movement.

Rennick stumbled back, nearly slipping. “That’s not possible… they’re being *moved*.”

I saw it too – every corpse was guided by thick tendrils that coiled around their limbs like marionette strings. The wall itself pulsed, forcing them outward.

“We can’t stay here,” I blurted out.

But the opening in the wall widened, and even more bodies slid into the chamber – there must’ve been 50 by this point. One of them let out a shuddering exhale, while another screamed as if it was still a living man.

The water behind us splashed violently – I turned around to see the corpse from the catwalk rising from the water, its head turned toward us, and its jaw open wider than it should.

Rennick gritted his teeth. “They’re boxing us in.”

Suddenly, all the puppets stopped moving around.

Something else was coming. From inside the wall.

We felt the water surge toward us, slapping against our suit from whatever was coming out.

“We go back the way we came and risk the breach,” Rennick said, already turning and not waiting for my opinion – however, the tunnel behind us was gone. The living mass had completely folded over it.

I couldn’t take my eyes off the puppets – and off the imposing presence that was coming our way, getting closer while Rennick was trying to figure out an escape.

“Pick a direction!” he barked.

Ahead, the chamber split in two directions – one passage narrowed and crooked, while the other wider but half-collapsed. Both were equally bad options.

“That way!” I shouted, already moving toward the wider corridor. Rennick didn’t argue and followed after me.

The puppets twitched, as if the order had been given to follow. Tendrils snapped loose from the wall with *plops*, splashing into the water and slithering after us.

“Keep moving!” Rennick shouted, but he sounded winded.

We hit the end of the corridor and stumbled into another chamber that – out of nowhere – opened around us.

“What…?” Rennick gasped, looking around him.

The walls curved outward in ways that didn’t match the outside of the facility that we entered. What should’ve been concrete was instead a mixture of metal, flesh and tendrils. It was lined with giant tanks that towered far above us, vanishing into nothingness. Shapes floated around and inside the tanks – suspended human silhouettes like before, bodies curled in different positions.

I expected the puppets to flood in from behind, but instead the corridor went silent. When I glanced back, the tendrils that had chased us stopped at the threshold. Dozens of figures stood in the hall, their heads bowed.

Rennick whispered, “Why aren’t they coming in?”

“I think…” My throat tightened. “I think we’re already where it wants us.”

My hands shook as I pulled out the phone: *We’re in some kind of chamber that’s too big to exist, with bodies floating around. What is this?*

For the first time, Anonymous didn’t answer instantly. A minute dragged out into two, with Rennick pacing around, muttering under his breath.

Finally, his message came through.

>**Anonymous:** You weren’t supposed to reach it.

I stared at the string of letters. “Rennick--”

Another message appeared.

>**Anonymous:** That’s not part of the facility. You’re inside *it*.

Rennick leaned over my shoulder, reading the words as they appeared.

>**Anonymous**: The Order calls it Subject MOTHER. It isn’t an infection; you’ve been lied to. It’s a living organism. The Order feeds it regularly with people they need gone. Like you.

Sweat dripped from my forehead, and the room seemed to pulse with Rennick’s every step.

He slammed his fist against the side of his helmet and chuckled dryly. “After everything I’ve done for them… this is how they repay me?”

Another ping.

>**Anonymous:** Protocol PALEWAKE – global or existential level threat; containment is impossible. Only way to delay it is suppression and isolation. And they suppress it by feeding it.

I’ve heard about the PALEWAKE classification, but always been told not to worry about it. Seems like that was a lie as well.

>**Anonymous:** Its flesh builds the walls. The bodies inside them are deceased Order personnel – what you should’ve been.

I shivered as I typed my next message: *How do we get out?*

>**Anonymous:** I’ll call someone who can help you.

Rennick leaned close, his voice overflowing with panic. “Who the hell could help us with *this?*”

>**Anonymous:** He’s not someone you can trust, but believe me: he hates the Order more than you do.

He continued.

>**Anonymous:** His name’s been all over the leaks. The one who exposed maps, documents, vessels.

I shook my head. *Arthur? That lunatic is still alive? I thought he was killed by now.*

>**Anonymous:** Real and dangerous. The Order sent Subjects after him, but they were unsuccessful.

I stared at the pulsing walls that seemed to become more agitated.

“You think this Arthur can get us out?” I asked Rennick, my voice low.

Instead of a reply from my partner, the phone buzzed again.

>**Anonymous:** No one escapes MOTHER whole – you’re the first to survive this long.

A final message came through.

>**Anonymous:** The Order thinks you’re already dead. But you’re not, and I won’t let you die. Your existence is proof they can bleed – and proof that Arthur’s plan could work. He got the message. He’s on his [way](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/).
