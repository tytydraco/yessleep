I stood staring into the sink. It was the next day. I hadn’t slept at all, I was too busy trying to wash the blood off the pages of the book so that I could read more. I just ended up washing some of the ink and lead off. I lost track of time and only realized it when the sun came up through my blinds. I wanted to call out of work, but I needed to find some link between Grant’s book to reality. I needed to prove that maybe he was delusional, that maybe he did harm Raymond. Someone grabbed my shoulder and spun me around.

“Jaclyn?” It was an unfamiliar voice.

“Christ! What? What are you doing?” I was in my own little world when the new hire woke me up.

“Gosh, man, I was just introducing myself, y’know? Sorry, Lady,” said the new hire. I didn’t realize how harsh my words were at the moment; I told myself I was cranky from the lack of sleep, really, it was the lack of answers.

“Oh my, I’m sorry. My name is Jaclyn. You're the new hire? Nice to meet you! Sorry, I was just on autopilot, I guess.” I ended with a nervous chuckle that made me sound stir-crazy.

“Oh, it's okay, y’know? I was just asking cuz I think my schedule is all messed up. But bossman is telling me I’m staying here late with him because of an event or whatever pickleball tournament they are running here.” The new hire said before walking towards the board in the hallway.

He was right. He was scheduled until midnight along with Maxwell. The latest I’ve ever been here was 9:00. Grant and Raymond’s faces glared up at me from the bottom of the announcement board. The photo of Grant looked like he was staring into my eyes. I looked for a way to change the subject.

“So, what’s your name? Maybe Maxwell just wants to teach you as much as you can learn in a day. It’s your second day, right? I bet you will like this job! I’ve been here for just over three years!” My mouth rambled out.

“How long were they here?” He was looking at Maxwell and Grant. The question made the hallway fall quiet.

“Raymond was here for 10 years, Grant five.” My high-pitched fake work voice fell away. 

“Cool. Bet they got shit done, y’know?” He said as he walked back to the dish pit. I did know. Raymond taught me how to get 4 hours of dishes done in 30 minutes. Grant taught me how to dive and deliver food on the shitty golf cart. Grant also told me about the thing in the sink. I was fighting with the question, was there even anything in the sink all morning. I practically had my head down the drain with my phone flashlight for the first hour of my shift. The idea that Grant was a delusional and harmful person was what I was hoping for. I wanted to punch myself so hard bones would shatter just for thinking that.

The next few hours kept my mind busy training the teenage stoner. It was a blessing in disguise.

“Oh, dude, this stain just won’t come out! Do you think you can take over Jackie? I need to hit a dart.” It was whatever his name was. I was busy observing the blood stains on the poster again. It was the start of a large slash of blood that still hadn’t been cleaned up. I followed the slash up the wall, and it ended at a security camera. It was one of those things your brain never registers until everything else in your surroundings is silent. It was pointed right at the sink and to the drying racks behind it, where I was sitting. Maybe I could get my answer to whether the thing in the sink really exists. The security office was at the front of the retirement community. I passed by it every day I worked. I didn’t want to wait until the end of my shift, but I didn’t want Maxwell to be left alone with the toddler currently struggling to remove a ketchup stain from a ceramic plate.

“I’m gonna go check with Maxwell about your schedule, okay? Making sure all is good!” I said in my work voice. I needed to talk to a normal person for a few minutes. At least, maybe to discuss the camera and what I found in that journal.

“Uh, dude? I just asked for help. And you walk away? Whatever, man.” I paid him no attention as I walked towards Maxwell’s office. I grabbed the keys for the golf cart hanging on the outside of the office door before knocking. A quiet weeping came from inside the door. I paused. Maybe now wasn’t the time to talk about a camera and a bloody journal; instead, maybe a little check-up. I knock and here him quickly cleans up inside his small room. The door opens, and out pops Maxwell.

“Hey Jaclyn, need something?” He asks.

“I’m just making sure you’re okay. So, you okay?” He takes my words in for a second and thinks. I also take this time to appreciate the moment of being able to talk to him. Maxwell is always wearing a flannel over his work shirt; it seems like it would go good with a beard, but his face is clean-shaven nonetheless. The orange flannel he has on now matches his green eyes well. Green eyes that were bloodshot from crying. 

“Can, can I give you a hug?” I ask. He sucks on his lips and gives me a nod. It's a quick one, no more than five seconds long. It was awkward, but for a moment, I forgot all about everything. All about Grant. I hope Maxwell did too. I back off and sit down on the stool in the room while he sits back down on his chair. 

“Want to talk? About stuff going on?” I said. I couldn’t poison this man's mind with the contents of the journal or the fact that I believed that something lived in the sink. 

“Yeah. Fuck where to begin, am I right?” He chuckles out, but I chuckle with him. We talked for about half an hour. We talk about life, but mostly about Raymond and Grant. 

I share my favorite memory of Raymond, that being his band. They were a mariachi band that sometimes played for some of the residents. I usually snuck out to listen whenever they came. I always sat in the back, and he always, without fail, managed to see me and give me a thank you after the show. He was an amazing guitar player, makes me wish I stuck with it. Maxwell said his favorite memory of Raymond was all of the mustache grooming tips he got whenever there was downtime. Raymond did have a very well-trimmed horseshoe mustache.

Maxwell’s favorite memory of Grant is when he first taught Grant how to run deliveries. Apparently, Grant hit three mailboxes, 2 parked cars, and barely missed an old woman walking her dog. Maxwell was convinced that the flat tire was Grant's fault.

When I had to share my favorite memory of him, the journal crowded my head. I could see the memory I knew I wanted to talk about, but almost everything in it was altered. The joint Grant handed me at the end of my first shift was rolled in bloody paper, and his arm was still gone; he was using his ulna and radius to hold the joint. 

“I just have too many to choose from,” I said. I couldn’t describe what I saw. 

“I should probably go back and help the new hire.” I figured I spent enough time checking up with Maxwell and probably should go do something productive, not that this wasn't.

“Thanks, Jaclyn, I appreciate you.” He said right before he left his office. I was thankful for him, too. I’m glad he was still around. I forgot all about asking him for the new hire’s schedule. Oh well.

Right as the clock it 7, it was time to go check the security footage. I said goodbye to Maxwell and the new hire and headed for the door.

I had yet to lay eyes on it, the final barrier holding back the part of my body begging to believe in it. Hopefully, you know, I was going to prove that it was either mad ramblings or nothing else. Wouldn’t the police have checked it? If they had done this mystery would have been solved right away. I was beginning to believe that this might have been a futile trip. I pulled over next to the small building, got out of the car, and hastily walked to the door of the office, and without meaning to, pounded on the door harder than I imagined. I might as well go through with it. The door swung open, and Reggie looked down at me with surprise. 

“Oh, ohohoh hi Jaclyn, you gave me a scare.” He gave a hearty chuckle.

“Sorry, Reggie, I was coming to check something.” 

A puzzled look grew upon his face.

“Is… everything alright?” He asked.

“Yeah, I just… I noticed the security camera above the sink.” I barely finished the sentence before Reggie’s face changed color in an instant. He shifted his body just barely to block the camera feed behind him at the desk. Thousands of alarm bells rang in my head.

“Well… yeah? What about it? You know we can’t give out any of the footage, Jaclyn.” He said hastily.

“I never asked for footage, Reggie.” Those words came out of their own accord in a sudden bounce of confidence. Reggie was caught up in his words, trying to formulate a sentence.

“Look. I want to see what happened that night. You’ve seen it. The thing in the sink.” 

I took the biggest gamble of my life with that sentence. Either he would know what I’m talking about, or look at me absolutely bewildered. Reggie regained his composure and, with a blank, cold face, asked, “Did Maxwell send you?” 

Those four words derailed the momentary confidence I had found. Did Maxwell know about this? He didn’t tell me? All the confidence I had gained in that moment washed away. While my thoughts were running through my mind, my head started a slow, somber nod.

“Hmmmm. I guess it was about time. It’s been hard for us. I’ve never heard him refer to it as the thing in the sink, though. Come in.” Some of Reggie’s kindness returned to his face as he shot me a quick smile. He opened his stance and gave me a quick wave through the door. The security room was small, with barely enough room for a desk, an office chair, a water cooler, and the buttons to let the bar gate up. Reggie grabbed the back of the chair and swung it around, raising his palm and offering the seat. I sat, and he whips the seat around so that my face meets the screen. He pulls out a USB drive, plugs it in, and opens the folder titled “Offers.” Hundreds of video files pop up on the screen. No words are exchanged between us, only one of those hundreds of videos matters to me in the moment. Reggie doesn’t pay attention to the screen, his eyes slyly placed to the side of his skull, observing me. Each of the video logs is numbered, I see one, two, 23, 56, 89, 117, 130, and finally 147/148. The last video log. Reggie’s rotund body blocking me from leaving, tries to give me the comfort that I still have a choice of leaving this situation by asking, 

“Are you sure you want to see this?”

I don’t say anything, I turn my head, letting my eyes meet his. Although he is stone-faced, his eyes shake with a quiet pleading. I quietly nod, letting my eyes drift back to the screen. He rubs the bottom of his nose, opens the file, and turns away, opening his phone. The video doesn’t have any sound, and nothing is visible. The light above the sink flickers on, giving the cold metal below a white, sterile glow. The sink is the only thing visible for a while before a small orange glow starts in the corner, near the drying racks. The glow illuminates Grant’s face as he lights up a cigarette. Grant holds up something else to the lighter, letting it burn in his undamaged hand. He doesn’t move while the fire gets to his fingertips. He does the same thing for a few more items, but when it comes to the last small square-shaped paper, he walks into the light. It’s a Polaroid photo. He stares at it for a minute before holding the lighter up to it. He hesitates to burn the image. Instead, Grant crumpled the photo in his hand and dropped it to the ground, crushing it below his worn-out Vans. He puts an earbud in, clicks something on his phone, and walks toward the sink.

This is the first time that I have seen him for who he was, not the body left behind. He’s wearing ripped jeans and a logoless hoodie. The light shimmers across his black buzz cut and bounces off his silver piercings into the camera. His face unshaven and shaggy, sickly black bags pulling his eyes down so that you can see the red underneath. He takes one last toke of the cigarette and flicks it into the sink. Grant just stares, staring for an eternity deep into the darkness of the sink. He is as solid as stone; all that happens to him physically is that a large, singular tear falls from his face. I follow the glisening tear as it falls into the sink, where I finally see it.

The first feeling that washes over me is denial. I try to explain it away, that maybe the sink was just backed up, and that there was a plumbing problem, and some food at the end of the shift was pushed back up to the pipes. Maybe Raymond, at the end of the shift, left something by accident when he was closing up that night. Maybe we served a calamari dinner to the residents? I knew these were all false in my heart. The plumber came and fixed the garbage disposal that day. I closed up that as Raymond mopped, and the kitchen gave the residents chicken skewers for dinner that night. I knew my mind was trying to explain the unexplainable. But as another, then another, then a fourth shape slowly emerged from the sink, my eyes finally let my brain believe. The thing in the sink was real and was currently wrapping its tentacles around Grant.

I started to audibly cry out, “Move!” “Move!” but it was all in vain. He didn’t seem like he wanted to move; maybe he couldn’t. The tentacles looked exactly like what Grant had written down, except they didn’t seem to have an end. Grant was tall, over 6 feet. He had to bend down to wash burns and stains off the dishes. He was standing upright, and the tentacles were already wrapping around the backside of his head. The proboscises all seemed to have a mind of their own, each trying to stick deep into Grant’s flesh as they grew closer to the skin. 

Grant still hadn’t moved, yet tears streamed down his solid face. I could barely see the right side of his face, where his pupil was looking wildly around at the tentacles, trying to escape his skull.

Two of the tentacles started to caress the back of his head. They flattened out and sank their needles into his skull. I instinctively shot my hand up over my open mouth, and I used the same hand to block one of my eyes. I forced myself to keep watching. The two tentacles that had submerged their proboscises started to pull apart. Almost like butter, the back of Grant’s scalp and skull opened up, but it wasn’t violent. No blood poured out, no twitching, just a clean slide open, like two curtains on the stage, like it was that easy for a skull to slide open.

It still didn’t deter my body from shivering uncontrollably. The first two tentacles held the back plate of the skull open while the other two started flipping through Grant’s brain folds like a book. The proboscises didn’t sink into the brain, just gently caressed the bumps and wrinkles, like they were following words. Grant’s pupil had stopped moving. I would have believed he had accepted his new possession if the tears weren’t like waterfalls.

The tentacles kept reading his brain for minutes before they seemed to gather enough of what they were looking for. The two holding tentacles slowly unanchored from the back of his scalp. The skull and scalp slid right back into place, cleanly fitting in like nothing had happened.

Three of the tentacles retreated into the drain. The last one of the holding tentacles grabbed Grant’s wrist and started pulling his hand toward the sink. Grant’s statue was steadfast. I quietly pleaded for him to do anything, to attempt to run.

As his bandaged hand was dragged into the sink, up to his elbow, his other tattooed arm started floating up to right below the sink. I wasn’t expecting him to move. He was reaching for something. His fingers fumbled around looking for something underneath the sink. I couldn’t see, but I had a feeling it was the on switch for the garbage disposal. Grant’s pupil was as high as it could go; it was both escaping the pool of tears and the image of his own hand being ripped away. I couldn’t either. I had already seen the aftermath; there was no reason to watch it happen.

I turned around and slammed my forehead to my knees, slamming my eyes shut, only letting the biggest tears out. I swear, I thought I heard a sound in the video for a second. The sound of a click, and then a crunch. It sounded a lot like if someone dropped a carton of eggs, a loud crack with the sound of the yolk being squeezed and squirted out. I slammed my hands over my ears. It didn’t stop the noise of celery when you bite down on it; I knew it was Grant’s hand. I heard the blade got stuck at points, making the same particular sound of metal clunking against bone echo in my skull. I fell out of the chair, screaming, trying to get the sound out of my imagination. 

“Jaclyn? Jaclyn!” Reggie had rushed to my side, throwing his phone on the table. His hands felt cold on my back, reeling me back to where I was, and the danger I was in.

“Are you okay?” Reggie reached for his phone, typed quickly, and put his phone up to his ear. “Maxwell, we've got a problem.” It was all too clear to me that this was an operation. If I can’t get out now, all I can hope for is an easier death than Grant's.

I pulled my elbow in and pushed it out as hard as I could towards Reggie. I landed it on his shoulder. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to knock him off his feet. I scrambled to my feet and threw my body towards the door. I slammed into it and ran. I’m sure Reggie had told Maxwell that I had figured out that something was in the sink.

I ran past the golf cart; the thing only had a top speed of 15 mph, if you got lucky. My eyes were filled with tears falling behind me as I ran. I didn’t know where I was running to. I told myself that it was my car. But I knew deep down that I needed to see the thing for myself. He had logs of what I presumed were hundreds of deaths due to the thing in the sink. I didn’t want to believe any of this was real at first, but now, that’s all I want.

The last thing I heard from the security office was Reggie screaming into his phone, “Jaclyn knows! She’s coming straight to you,” trying to make me think that they hadn’t already set up a plan.

I arrive back at the kitchen, out of breath. I fumbled through my pockets, constantly looking back to make sure Reggie wasn’t behind me. I prayed I hadn’t dropped my name tag while running. After a mini heart attack when the first pocket came up empty, I ripped it out of my second pocket and scanned the barcode. The door unlocked, and I tore through the labyrinth of back halls until I reached the kitchen door. I grabbed the handle and hesitated. What was I doing? Most of my run had been focused on the monstrosity in the sink. I gave in to one last argument with myself. Maybe the video was CGI? To cover up for murders?

In this moment of uncertainty, I chose to try to lay eyes upon what I had been living in the sink. Maxwell didn’t matter anymore. All I wanted was to see the dark flesh that took my coworkers' no, my friends, from me. I opened the door and sprinted into the darkness. I tried to make a right turn but came in flying, sliding on a streak of dirty water and slamming into a drying rack full of pots, pans, and cutlery. All sense of stealth was gone as a cacophony of metal crashed onto concrete. I grabbed a knife and wobbled to my feet. If Reggie had caught up or if Maxwell was waiting, at least I had some defense now.

I followed the streak of dirty water to its source. As I grew closer, the single light above the sink called to me like the pearly gates of hell, a warm, ephemeral light. The light revealed something to me in that moment. What I had been following wasn’t water. It was a deep brown blood. It didn’t stop me. It only drew me closer.

I now stood where Grant had stood, staring deep into the sink. I stared into the blackness of the drain hole, a gluttonous black that swallowed all the light that entered. I stared for what felt like an hour, knowing whatever was in the sink was looking right back at me, studying me. That was all I could focus on. Nothing else mattered.

“Jaclyn!” I heard it, but I paid no attention. “Jaclyn!” Again, I heard it, this time as if underwater. “Jaclyn!” The muffled footsteps grew louder, and the small human part of me tried to look at whoever was calling, but I tried to move my hands to use the knife, but they wouldn’t budge. It felt like they were encased in a ton of concrete. I pulled with my shoulders and got the sensation they were moving, but my hands didn’t move an inch. I pulled my feet up with my thighs, but the same thing happened. I tried to look around, but it felt like a concrete neck pillow was trapping me. Nothing moved except my eyeballs. 

My vision felt more sunken in, and I couldn’t see as much as before. I felt myself shrinking into my brain, like a setting sun on the horizon.

I knew nothing was holding me physically. My hands were free, no shackles or anything. I kept receding into my mind until I bumped into something. It was squishy yet firm, almost like my back was against a trampoline. I tried to make a sound of shock, but nothing came out. I’m not even sure my mouth opened. The only thing I could see was the drain hole, until Maxwell came in front of me, blocking my entire view. He was crying, shaking me, trying to release me from my prison. He looked up and down, trying to find any crack to break the wall encasing me.

He stopped moving his head frantically, staring at the knife in my hand. His mouth quaked, eyes streaming tears. He reached for the knife, ripped it out of my hand, and without hesitation, ran the blade down my arm.

Nothing. No pain. No warmth from the running blood. Nothing. I was trapped.

Maxwell broke down into tears. He slowly backed away from the sink, letting me finally see the four darkest spires of another realm coming out of the retirement home sink.

I pulled with all my strength to get away from the sink. For a second, I stumbled back, but it was into the trampoline texture again. I didn’t know what it was the first time, but now it was clear. Whatever was in the sink was holding me hostage in my mind.

I felt millions of small proboscises sink into my skull painlessly, opening it like it had with Grant. Once the back of my skull was open, the thing in the sink used another tentacle to flip through the wrinkles of my brain. It was looking for something. All I could think of in that moment was more repressed memories it could devour. It took its time, making sure to read everything I’d known for the past 24 years of conscious life. It stopped where I thought would be the penultimate chapter of a book.

It removed its needles from my skull, all but one.

It was the first ounce of pain I felt while in its invisible grasp.

It retreated its tentacles, and my skull slid back into place. The trampoline texture receded from my back as an invisible current pushed me back to full view.

Luke warm blood dripped from my hand. Warmth, I felt again.

I looked down, my neck obeying, to see the gash Maxwell had left. Laying eyes upon it finally let my brain recognize my own pain. I unconsciously shot my hand toward the wound, grabbing it and trying to stop the bleeding.

I looked around to see where Maxwell had gone. Not very far. He was staring at me with emotions that scared me more than the encounter with the thing in the sink. He looked relieved, taking deep breaths with a small smile.

He dropped the knife and walked toward me with open arms, wrapping me in a cold embrace that smelled like iron and cigarette smoke. He whispered into my ear through heavy breathing, “Finally. Thank you,” His voice was shaky and dry.

I pushed him off, which didn’t deter his surprise.

“Please, Jaclyn, don’t fight it.” He was pleading, but I didn’t care.

I cut him off. “What the fuck is happening? What have you been doing?”

I couldn’t cry anymore. I didn’t even want to know the answers. I just wanted out of this pit.

“It’s okay to not understand. I still don’t get it all. Everything I know about it is a guess. It brings you to itself. Through any process, it sees fit.” He points towards the sink.

“Did that thing tell you that? And you believe it?” I was dumbfounded. 

“You did, didn’t you? You followed its call to this moment. Everything you’ve done was orchestrated by it. It sees something in you.” I let out a scoff, and my jaw dropped, but I never disagreed.

“There are goddamn tentacles in the sink!” I hated how he talked about it like it was a football coach, like it had a plan for me. “You don’t respect that thing. You’re scared. It’s nothing more than an animal! A predator!”

The skeptic in me never left.

Maxwell’s flimsy smile fell away, and he spoke his true mind, and it came out with a boom:

“I don’t want this anymore! I never wanted to be a puppet to some Cthulian house cat! I don’t know why it wanted me. It listened to me, just like you, and it followed me everywhere. I tried to run, move states, out of the country, just away from that thing. But it found me.” He took a moment to catch his breath, continuing with a far meeker voice.

“ It crammed itself into my car, under the hood. It took her. She didn’t even look at me when it went off the road. All focus, torn away so easily. Then, it was just me and it.” He looked for understanding in my eyes, but the only thing running through my body was confusion.

“Whoever ‘her’ was, it was just an accident, and I’m sorry! But you can’t blame it on this animal! You hurt Grant and Raymond!  You don’t get to blame that animal.” I was trying to convince Maxwell that this thing, whatever it is, is just a rabid animal. At least, that's what I told myself.

“Don’t you dare fucking say that about that monster. I never intended to hurt any of you! How was I supposed to know Grant was a water buffalo of trauma? No one ever brings that here to work!” He ranted in a wild frenzy of defense.

“You’re wrong.” But he was so incredibly right. I never saw any distress Grant put out; no one did.

“I was desperate to please it, so maybe that was a way it would leave me alone. So I brought it here. I thought a retirement home would be perfect for it. Years of regrets among the hundreds of residents would be a gold mine for whatever it wanted. I thought that it would only hurt those close to the end of their life. I thought it would be happy. And I was right. I thought it would come for them and leave me alone, though, not bring them to me to clean up.” Maxwell swallowed the knot in his throat.

“What are you even talking about? Regret? It eats flesh and blood just like any other predator! Nothing can eat thoughts!” I screamed at him.

“It doesn’t matter what you think, what you believe, it just chooses those who help it in any way,” Maxwell said as the room fell silent. 

Maxwell’s eyes looked past me, past everything, longing for something not visible in the distance. I felt adrenaline pooling in my calves and shins.

“Why me?” he asked as he broke the silence. The adrenaline was about to overflow in my legs.

Maxwell fell to the ground, crawling toward the sink. Whispering, “She’ll understand. She has to,” and “Take it away” over and over.

I did understand.

A dish pit would be the perfect place to house it: easy access to cleaning materials, plenty of drains, no carpet or cloth, just cold tiles. Right out back was a trash compactor. No one would notice the smell of rot if the stench of trash was already in the air. And the truck would come and pick up the trash. No one would bat an eye.

That explained everything in my mind.

Maxwell, someone whom I trusted ever so deeply, was a killer who had a perfect plan for hiding his victims. Reggie, a man meant to protect, was an accomplice. This was all just a plan of two sick men who wanted me to join them. That was the only rational explanation for everything.

I started moving again, away from the sink. Oh, that’s right. There was one thing I left out, the thing in the sink. Maybe I was hallucinating, like mass hysteria, or maybe I was drugged by Maxwell. I couldn’t craft a theory where those fit. I didn’t have to. I turned back one final time to see if I could catch a glimpse of the thing in the sink, to feed my undying hunger. The thing had now revealed itself. It stood on two front legs on the edge of the sink.

The second my brain registered what it was, it let out a shriek. I don’t know how to describe it. It sounded like 1000 voices all imitating a scream by whispering, yet I still felt deep in my chest. Claws ripped deep into the metal, anchoring it. It was no bigger than an opossum. Its skin was smooth and deep black. Wet food chunks covered its skin, making the room reek of putrid wet food. Its tentacles were holding Maxwell, coddling him as he cried to himself, I saw all of the small needles brushing his hair.

I whipped my head around and sprinted. It was the most I had seen of it, yet in the second I looked, I only got a glance. I didn’t want to look at it any longer than I had to. 

I couldn’t help but feel a deep foreboding dread in my stomach. I was right, it was an animal, but not from this world. It looked like it was vermin, like wherever it came from, whatever dimension spat this creature out, it was nothing but the very bottom of its food chain. Yet here, it dined on humans as much as it wanted.

I wasn’t going to let it hurt me or read me or whatever the hell it wanted. 

I ran past the blood on the floor, past the stench of the garbage disposal, and straight to my car. The sun and breeze failed to give me the sense of relief I desperately craved. I pulled out of the parking lot screeching. I didn’t slow down when I saw the barrier at the security office blocking my path. I didn’t slow for Reggie, waving his arms and trying to stop me. He jumped to the side as I slammed through the bar gate, pits of plastic or glass flying into my face. I didn’t slow for any lights or stop signs.

I only stopped when I pulled into my apartment complex and ran inside to hide within the false comforts of my home, where I tearlessly sobbed.

It’s been two days. I want the police to call me in for questioning, for interviews. I want to tell them about the tapes. I want to tell them about the trash compactor so they can find the bloodless body of the new guy. I want to tell them everything. Everything except the thing in the sink. I haven’t told them anything because it follows me everywhere. I know it’s there.

I turn my head for a second and see a dark shape move out of view, or the light from the lamp casts an undeniable shadow of a tentacle. I see scratch marks on my front door. Birds with hundreds of holes show up on my balcony like an offering.

 The same one it wants.

The only silver lining to this situation is that I don’t have to think about the betrayal from Maxwell since my mind was so preoccupied. The hurt I felt deep within my soul is undefinable. Only the sight and torment of an extraterrestrial creature could drown it out.

The truth is, I can’t tell the police. They’d think I’m insane. Maybe they’d think I killed that new guy. I know the police wouldn’t believe me. But maybe you all would.

I’m sharing this story now, online, to get the word out about this thing. I’ve reopened the blood-stained journal to write it all down. Be careful of this thing, whatever it may be or wherever it dwells. Maybe since you know about it now, it will come for you and leave me alone. I am so deeply sorry if that's the case. And just in the event it leaves me alone and wanders back to his home, I want to extend the warning Grant gave me back when I found the journal: If you’re reading this, please don’t apply for a dishwasher position at Riverside Memories Retirement Community.
