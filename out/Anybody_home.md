**Anybody home?**

This happened a couple of years ago after a family members birthday.

I was driving for about three hours when I realized I had taken the wrong turning and was hopelessly lost. I pulled over to the side and found my mobile phone in order to phone for help. Surprisingly, the battery had run completely low and I began to feel a sense of panic as it was rapidly becoming darker. In the distance, I saw the outline of a house and I thought that I could detect smoke coming out of the chimney. I decided that I had no option but to make my way to the house and ask for directions and for the use of the telephone as my family would be getting worried about me.

I drove to the house which was completely isolated and as I pulled up the smoke had vanished. The building suddenly appeared to be uninhabited, but I hadn't seen civilization for miles so I decided to ring the doorbell anyway. It’s ringing seemed incredibly loud due to the jarring contrast it had with the forest's eerie silence, and after a few minutes of failed attempts to reach whoever I hoped would be home, I decided to enter anyway to search for a wired phone. Afterall the house did look old enough to have one.  
I felt a burst of cautious hope as the door wasn’t locked, although as soon as I entered I got a feeling that something was off. On my right stood a pair of size 13 boots in desperate need of being cleaned and on my left was a brown leather jacket which due to its size could only belong to the same person as the boots. Now not knowing if I even wanted a response I in a slightly shaky voice shouted: “Hello! Anybody home?”.  
Silence.  
I began my search for a phone as I snuck across the old wooden floorboards, and as I entered what must have been the living room I through the window got a glimpse of something sticking up from the grass. I decided to look closer. It was a shovel, and next to it was a hole deep enough for an adult to lie down in. I started panicking and as the entire garden was fenced in I realised the horrid truth. The only way out was back through the house.  
I turned around half expecting to see someone standing in the window, but I was all alone.  
I had convinced myself that whoever had dug the grave was asleep and that I through sheer luck hadn’t woken him up by ringing the doorbell and shouting.  
Re-entering the living room from the garden gave me a view of the fireplace connected to the chimney. There was no sign of a fire, it had been deliberately put out with water. Even more anxious than before, I entered the kitchen and as I, silent as a mouse, crept across the kitchen floor I saw the freezer. Part of me wanted to take a look inside, but scared of what I might find I chose not to.  
I reached the front door. This time no boots and no jacket. Looking through the spyhole I saw nothing but the darkness of the tall now almost menacing trees. I decided to make a run for it. If I reached the car I could just drive away. I took a couple of deep breaths and whispering to myself I started counting down. “... 3, 2, 1”, I leapt out the front door running faster than ever before, however as I was nearing the car I saw the flat tires. I stopped, and with my heart still beating at an unprecedented pace, I saw him. He must have been at least seven foot tall as he stood up from behind the car. In his huge bony hands was a knife which also, even compared to the rest of him, was enormous. The only distinct facial feature I through the darkness could detect were his lifeless grey eyes. Seconds later I was sprinting through the woods. We must have been running for miles because he didn’t stop chasing me until we reached a small town, and that's when this sweet old lady invited me inside and called you for me.

“Okay, thank you for your time, I’ll see what I can do.” the policeman says as he stands up from the chair. He opens the door to leave the room and adds “If you just wait here my colleague will be with you in a minute or two for some further questioning.”.  
A couple of minutes go by before a new man enters.

This new guy isn’t wearing a uniform like the other policeman, instead he’s wearing a brown leather jacket and newly cleaned boots. The astonishingly tall figure locks the door with his scrawny hands and walks towards the table. As he’s nearing in, his cold and sinister grey eyes are revealed, this time they’re accompanied by a devilish smile that the darkness of last night had concealed. It was him.

He didn't hurt me, but there was no point continuing any further with this case.
