This is a story I will tell you that scares me to this day. 

As a child growing up in the early nineties, I always had a reoccurring nightmare that has been relevant to this day. I'm 35 years old, but this nightmare has always been a thing for me. Literally can't sleep without this being a thing. And now it's becoming more real. 

I always had the sleep paralysis demons blah blah during my early childhood. 4 years old and I had night terrors, colicky, what they used to call a difficult baby from 1-3 years old. But when I hit 4 years old I was able to communicate to my "parents" the stress of my dreams. This was only the beginning of the "gift" as I came to call it later in life. 

Imagine being in a dream, but knowing consciously that it is a dream, so you can take control of yourself or your actions. Lucid dreaming comes to mind. Imagine that power at 6 years old. And all you see is fucked up shit. Demons slowly slicing your mom's neck. Seeing your father getting dipped into acid, burning off his skin while he screams, then his bones, screaming even more...... This was my daily dreams at 4-6 years old. 

So I found a way to consciously take control of the dream. My mother is getting boiled alive? That's just not happening. Now I'm saving her consciously while I'm sleeping. My dad is getting burned? Nah he's fine now. I'm in control of all of this. I figured it out. When I'm asleep I'm on control. Regardless of the images presented to me, fuck you I'm controlling this.

Or so I thought.

When you gain true control of an unconscious sleep. There is rules to the ability.
1. Never acknowledge that you have gained control.
2. Never EVER eat or drink anything offered to you.
3.if you can figure out how to fly, take advantage of it.
4. This is your one shot to find true freedom. Don't waste it.


So I went through about 15ish years of lucid dreams without any kind of repercussions. Flowed the rules, never had an issue. Until one night. I had this dream, I was walking through a typical abandoned psych ward. And I got on an elevator. Pushed the button to 3. When it got up there, the doors opened and I saw a long corridor with doors on the left and the right side. But at the end of the hallway there was a woman. Gray hair, balding, elderly. She had a raspy kind of cackle. 

Originally her faced towards the floor. I couldn't see her face. Then she called and looked up towards me. Mind you I'm still in the elevator, she's a good 7 rooms down on this floor. But when she looked up at me her eyes were flashing black and white. (Imagine like a donut of white with a black border, but it just keeps going over and over. Like the old spiral psychosis things from the 50s)

She asked me (HA HA ha, aren't you a little to early.) and then proceeded to fly at my down the corridor. Screaming one consistent scream but getting louder and louder as she got closer. As I'm pressing the buttons in the elevator to escape this.

The doors close, she hits and screams the doors until I eventuallyove upwards in the elevator. Everything goes quiet as I hit level 7. The doors open...... It's the same exact floor and the same exact layout except there's no crazy eyed gray woman. I take a tentative step outside of the elevator, making sure I keep a hand on the door.

This floor is basically a hallway with countless doors on the left or right of me. A shadow appears and tells me, "these are all the decisions you could have made in your life, I will grant you one look, one opportunity, to see what it is, was, or could be. Choose carefully because it could come to pass."

I don't understand it because I'm still feeling from the old woman and I'm scared out of my mind. But I walk down this hallway, touching doors. Feeling the energy. "This one's cold. Fuck that" "this one feels right, but I don't trust it" "this one is.... Off" 

Eventually I end up on a door that feels very similar to the closet door in my bedroom, where I usually go to hide from everything when I feel scared. It makes sense to me. 

When I opened that door, there she was. Scream laughing at me, eyes black and white. And she dug her nails into my face. I woke up screaming, and to this day I have scars underneath my left eye.
