I suddenly felt myself sweating. What the fuck? I needed to leave, now. 

I whipped my phone out to try to take a picture of the note. Who would believe me if I didn't have evidence? I entered my passcode and noticed the battery was on two percent. "Well shit."

My hand was shaky and the photo looked a little blurry, but I did manage to take a photo. I frowned, that wasn't good enough, so I slid the sticky notes pad into my pocket and grabbed a pen from his office.

"You're not crazy, you're not crazy," I closed my eyes and repeated. I knew deep in my bones that what I was experiencing was real. If I was painted as an attention-seeking liar for telling my story, then so be it.

I put the thought out of my head and refocused. The only thing I was guilty of was being a nosy and disobedient tenant, who, if nothing else, was well-intentioned.

As I exited the office, I heard a door creak open. I faced the bedroom door in shock; it was open.

"This is way too creepy I need to leave right now, this is way too fucking creepy," I muttered to myself as I stood in front of the door. I felt transfixed in place. I wanted to go back downstairs but for some reason, my feet would not allow it. It was as if the bedroom itself was compelling me to enter.

I closed my eyes and pushed past the door, hands trembling. 

I opened my eyes to see an ordinary and empty room. I glanced under the bed and looked in the closet, and the bathroom. I felt relief wash over me. No dead bodies! 

I glanced around the room once more to see if maybe there was another note or letter left for me. I frowned, there was nothing. 

"Wait," I snapped back around, there was a small book on the bedside dresser. Maybe that was it!

I approached the dresser and stared at the book. The cover was an aged, unnatural yellow and was adorned with small, burgundy roses. That's when it hit me, this wasn't a book, it was a diary.

I gulped nervously as I picked it up. “You're fine, this is fine. No one is dead and you are fine.” I reassured myself.

As I opened the diary, I noticed Dr. Moskowtiz's name on the inside. I felt a sense of relief, maybe this would give me answers about his whereabouts.

I opened the first page. I squinted at the page. There was nothing... but dates? That was odd. 

I kept turning page after page. Dates were written, or nothing. I suddenly felt very stupid and silly, I had just wasted all this time and-. My trail of thought was interrupted when I read the words on the next page. 

"Dear resident, 

If you are reading this, congratulations! It is too late to save yourself. Don’t panic, I'm not going to hurt you. Indeed, I commend your bravery and resourcefulness. You disobeyed my house rules, found the note, got into my room, and even decided to violate my privacy and read my diary. Actions, however, have consequences. Had you not completed this last step, had you entered my room and then simply left, I would have excused every other violation and left you alone. But, seeing as you didn't do that, now you must pay the price."

The letter ended. I paged through the rest of the diary, was there anything else? There was nothing. 

As I closed the book I felt my fingertips burn. Was that one of the consequences? My blood ran cold. What other "prices" would I have to pay?

I felt my breathing become shallow and the world around me became shaky. My body began to wobble and fall. "No, what did I do?" I said, but my words felt strangled, as though something was crushing my windpipe. 

"What did I do? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to! I was scared, I was scared something happened to you, I was just trying to help! I was just," I strained to speak, "I was just trying to make sure you were okay."

My vision began to fade and before the world went black, I could have sworn I heard a soft voice whisper in my ear, "The consequences have just begun."

When I awoke I felt as though I was choking. Did I hallucinate that?

I held up my fingertips and noticed a slight singe. No, I didn't imagine that. "The consequences..." I blinked rapidly. No, no, it couldn't be!

But in my gut, I knew it was real. The burn, the whisper, the phantom strangulation. It was real.

I felt myself grow stiff as I realized the enormity of my mistakes. Did I deserve this? I didn't think so, but all I truly knew was that I was in danger. 

I steadied my body against the wall and exhaled. As I reached the doorknob and turned, I froze. It was locked, on the inside? That was impossible, there was no lock on the other side.

I inhaled and felt an anger rise in me. "No!" I screamed in frustration, "You're not keeping me in here! I'm not your fucking prisoner."

My eyes searched the room for something, anything. This door was coming down. No one was going to trap me here. 

I scanned the room again, for something, anything sharp or heavy. I searched the drawers. Nothing. All there was, was the diary. 

I hesitated. I didn't want to get burned again, so I removed a pillowcase from one of his pillows and grabbed the diary. Grasping the diary with both hands under the pillowcase, I hit it against the doorknob as hard as I could. I hit it again and again and again. I didn't know if it would work, but it was all I could do. To my surprise, the lock popped and the door unlocked. 

"Yes! Thank god, yes!"

I smiled and exhaled as I flew through the door. I ran downstairs and headed for the front door, but for some reason, I panicked. 

Fear paralyzed me and instead, I ran to my room and locked the door. 

Just as fear had stopped me in my tracks, an intense urgency inside of me said that I needed to write everything down, right now. I whipped out the pen and sticky note pad so quickly I cut my finger in the process. 

"Shit." The cut drew blood. I sucked on my finger and sighed as I began to pen my tale. Whatever happened, someone, anyone, needed to know what had happened to me.

After I finished, I felt as though my mind had turned to goop. The reality of everything that had happened to me was unbearably scary.

I held myself in a fetal position and rocked back and forth. I should have run out of the house, I should have called the police, I should have called my parents. But for some reason, I couldn't. All I could do was hold myself, cry, and rock slowly. After a few minutes, I heard a door unlock. 

My heart pounded so loudly that I thought I was going to die. I stopped breathing. 

"Hello," a man called out. "I know you're here."

That's when I heard his footsteps come closer. I immediately hid under the covers of my bed and breathed heavily. "I don't want to die, I don't want to die!" I said in between sobs. 

I quieted as his footsteps became louder and then stopped. I held my breath. Suddenly, I heard the doorknob for my room unlock and turn.
