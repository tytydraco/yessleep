It's hard to remember the first time I saw the inside of a body. You'd think something so disgusting would be burned into your mind forever, but I guess if you see something enough times your brain builds a tolerance to it. 

I do, however, remember a time where I wasn't accustomed to the sickly sight of the inside of a cadaver. A time where the grotesque smell of iron and rot, like spoiled fruit in a trainyard, still stung my nostrils so badly I had to pinch my nose through the mask covering my mouth. 

I remember a time where my hands still trembled, filling the bags, careful not to get the blood on my hands. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up whenever my father returned home and began putting on his gloves. I knew he would soon ask me to assist him, and I was too intimidated by him to refuse.

We'd step down into the basement, a foul and wretched air wafting from the door as soon as it swung open. That door still sits in the back of my mind, a simple oak door that leads down a flight of creaky old stairs. I hope it stays closed forever.

My father would look back at me as we slowly crept down into the basement, gloves and masks transforming us into something other than father and daughter. We were now cleaners, coworkers, and strangers. Maybe the attire was more than just a way to stay clean, maybe it was a way to disassociate ourselves from what we were about to do.

Despite the grotesque nature of the task, my father would still manage to check on me to make sure I wasn't too nervous or upset. I know he still cared about me deep down.

As soon as we reached the bottom of the steps, my father walked over to the many black bags slumped in a wet pile in the corner, and heaved it over his shoulder. He'd then take it to the table, and zip it open.

I tried to suppress my shaking every time he opened one of those bags, the essence of death plumed into the air as my father opened the black, plastic sarcophagi. Inside was always another dead person, and my father beckoned me to come closer.

I always reluctantly approached, fearful of the repercussions if I didn't follow his orders. I gazed upon their hollow, lifeless faces. Countless pairs of glassy grey eyes met my gaze over the many nights I assisted my father in his activities. Looking at their blue lips and pale skin you'd find it hard to believe these people were ever alive.

My father didn't need to tell me what he wanted me to do anymore, I had done it so many times and suffered so many punishments that I didn't hesitate to grab the large pair of scissors clipped to the side of the table. 

Cutting through flesh is surprisingly easy if you have the right tools. Though my small hands weren't that dexterous, I could easily slice through the abdomen of the cadavers lying on the table like I was cutting wrapping paper.

Like I said at the beginning, it's hard to remember the first time I opened up a chest cavity and looked at what was inside. Or why my father made me do it so many times. What I do remember, is what he did with what was inside.

My father would pat my shoulder, occasionally whispering a ‘good job’ or ‘it had to be you’. He would never cut them open himself, to this day I wonder why. It took a few minutes for me to break my sight away from the glistening red innards of the corpses, truly a horrific sight to behold.

The fear didn't subside when my father ordered me to scoop out as many of the innards as I could, and place them all in a fresh black garbage bag. 

I remember the mushy, slippery feeling of intestines snaking around in my hands, the soft, gooey muscles of the dead heart, the small and light pancreas, the wet and slimy kidneys.

I don't envy surgeons who willingly touch that stuff, the sight of the human innards plagued my nightmares for years. I would often have panic attacks in the dark hours of the night, when the only sound was my anxious breathing and heartbeat.

It's easy in those times to remember the wet and grotesque mechanisms at work inside all of us, I shut my eyes tight trying not to picture my own blood and organs shifting and writhing within my own body. I felt itchy, achy and sick visualizing myself being cut open on a table one day, the hot and slimy mess of viscera visible for all the world to see.

I'm more thankful for skin than anything, skin keeps it all hidden. There was no skin to guard the corpses on that table as I shoved the rotting innards in the black bag, carelessly getting fetid blood in my hair, on my apron and clothes. 

My father nodded, and grabbed the bag when I was done. My job was over at this point, I could wash up and go to bed. I didn't need to stay in that basement and stare at the hollowed out corpse. I didn't need to follow my father as he walked out the door with the bag full of organs.

One day, I was curious. Why did my father have me do this for him? Where did he take all the insides I emptied out from people? Where did he get all these bodies in the first place? I decided to follow him, follow wherever he went after he made me do his dirty work.

I was shocked to see that he didn't enter his truck. He simply walked down the driveway, then off into the woods, late into the night. He turned to face me and smiled.

“Do you wanna help some more?” He beckoned. I didn't respond, and he turned to continue walking. I knew following him meant I would inevitably have to help him with something, but I felt just as compelled to follow him then as I felt compelled to empty the bodies for him.

To me there was no choice, when a parent forces you to do one thing, every suggestion is an order. I glanced in every direction as we trudged through the woods, the dark night flooded with chirping of cicadas and crickets. My father would turn to check on me occasionally, making sure I was following his long trek into the dense forest.

Eventually I spotted a light in between the trees, and prayed that we'd reached our destination and could shelter ourselves from the oppressive darkness. It was a shack, a tiny and rustic wooden shed that would've provided little comfort in the wilderness. A small lamp post illuminated the tiny dwelling, swarmed by tiny flies buzzing loud.

My father paused in front of the door, and set the black bag on the grass with a wet squelch.
“Morgan, do you feel loved?” He asked, a subtle glistening of tears in his eyes. I shifted uncomfortably, I didn't expect such an odd question at that time.

I simply shrugged. Looking back, the answer was obviously no, and I think my father saw through me at that moment. 
“No, of course not. There's nobody out there for us Morgan. But there can be.” He said, putting his hand on the doorknob.

Between the chirping of insects and pulsing of my own heartbeat, I could make out a subtle, quiet breathing. Just beyond the shed door, I could make out the sound of deep, slumbering inhales and exhales. Something was inside the shed, sleeping.

My father hesitated to open the door, instead turning back to me and getting on his knees. I flinched slightly as he placed his hands on my shoulders.
“Morgan… Do you know what a Harkamogg is?” He asked excitedly, shaking me lightly.

I shook my head, and he chortled.
“Of course not, it's complete gibberish. It means nothing.” He stated plainly with an enthusiastic smile.

“It's my word, my creation.” He said, gesturing to the small shed. “I wanted a name unknown to any existing language, untainted by history, something I could truly call my own.” 

I looked at the shed in confusion, my father must have read my perplexed expression, as he continued to explain.
“It's been hard without mom, hasn't it?” Though my attention was still drawn to the shed, I could see his haunted, saddened face in my peripherie.

I nodded weakly.
“It feels like God doesn't love us, doesn't it? Why would he put us through this?” My father questioned, giving me a light shake. I bit my lip, I never liked it when Dad brought up Mom. I focused instead on the shifting sound accompanying the breathing coming from inside the shed.

“It's because God isn't real Morgan, your mother gave us more love than God ever did. Your mother was real, and she made something really special. You.” My dad brushed a hair from my forehead. I finally met his gaze, he was crying.

“Man invented God because they couldn't accept that mothers are the real creators of life. I don't feel love from any God… But your mother, do you still feel her love?” My father asked, tears streaming from his baggy eyes.

“Yes.” I whispered softly. It may have been the only word I spoke that night, and it may have been the last thing I said to my father. The breathing from the shed picked up in intensity, now sounding like a gurgling radiator.

My father paid no attention, only holding my head to his and continuing to speak.
“I've become a mother too, Morgan. That's what we're doing out here. I've created a miracle.”

The breathing halted as a loud cough and sputter sounded from the shed, and I flinched. My father grinned and looked back to the door, kneeling by my side.
“Morgan… meet Harkamogg. Your brother.” He whispered in my ear.

The doorknob on the old wooden door clicked, and the door opened a crack. A rancid odor flooded out, flies swarmed out in a thick cloud and scattered into the air. I took a step back in fear but my father clutched my back, holding me in place as I nervously watched the shed door creak open.

The soft yellow light of the lamp post did little to illuminate the shadows within the shed, the inside of the rustic wooden shack a dark abyss. Slowly, cautiously, I saw the silhouette of a large figure shift from within.

Its massive frame rose and fell with each deep, gurgled breath. The old wood squealed as it stepped towards the door. Its arm was the only thing I saw clearly, as it reached out of the shed for the black bag on the ground.

Its arm was red and glistening, seemingly soft and wet to the touch. I strained my eyes and realized that the arm had no skin or muscles, and wasn't structured like an arm at all. It was a mess of soft tissue and flesh, bright blue and red veins exposed, every segment of its bloated flesh pulsing and beating like a heart.

Its fat fingers wrapped around the black bag, and slowly dragged it into the darkness. I felt a sour sickness in my stomach when I realized why the arm looked so wrong, it was composed entirely of human organs melded together.

Wet and veiny innards glued and fastened into a person, the joints and tendons squishing and squelching as it moved its grotesque glistening body. I buried my face into my father's chest and held him tight, and he stroked my hair, whispering that everything was okay.

“Don't be afraid of Harkamogg… he loves us. He'll love everyone unconditionally, like God never did.” He affirmed. He reached into his pockets and pulled out several small candles.
“Now help me light these, sweetheart?”

I helped him light the candles and place them in a circle around the shed. As I knelt down in the grass to light them, I noticed many other half melted unlit candles in the dirt. After we were done, my dad made sure the shed door was closed, and he led me back home.

As we turned our backs to the shed, I shut my eyes tight and squeezed my father's hand as I heard disgusting slobbering sounds, the sloppy and grotesque slaps of tongues licking and lips smacking.

When my father put me to bed that night, I struggled to sleep even more than I had before. Whenever I shut my eyes I pictured my ‘brother’, Harkamogg, wrapping his warm and slimy arms around me.

It wasn't long after that my father would be taken away. I was plucked from the house and put in a foster home, never given the details behind my father's arrest. I remember how relieved, and sad I was to finally be away from that home.

Every night in that house after my mom died has been blended together in a fuzzy hazy mess, details and events of my life at that time are difficult to parse. 

I struggled to adapt to the foster home, to living life normally. For how long I had made a routine of hollowing out bodies for my father, I don't know. But it was enough time to feel a strange emptiness when my nights were no longer spent in utter disgust and terror, for it had become my world.

My life is mostly normal now, for years I had blocked out those memories as just an intense and bizarre nightmare. Something drew my thoughts back to my childhood however, something that happened recently that made my mind flash back to that awful night I saw the sickening abomination known as Harkamogg.

Last week, I woke up and felt no activity in my body. I felt empty, literally empty. I have no pulse now, no heartbeat, I don't even need to breathe. I don't hunger anymore, nor do I thirst. 

I feel dead.

Padding and feeling my abdomen, I can tell I'm empty. My innards simply aren't inside me anymore.

I know Harkamogg did this. I know he stole my insides, and left me in this dreadful, half dead state. Harkamogg is no brother nor God, as unloving as he is inhuman. From what little I've seen and sensed from his being, he is merely a barely cognizant sack of writhing meat.

My father thought he could create life, failing to understand that it simply can't be created reusing parts from already existing people. There is no soul in the scrambled mess that is my brother.

I'll record my search for him, I plan to return to that shed and see what I can find, then share more details here as they come.

Until then.
