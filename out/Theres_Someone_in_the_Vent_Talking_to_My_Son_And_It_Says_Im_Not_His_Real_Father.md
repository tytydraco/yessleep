We moved into this house three months ago. A modest two-story place in a quiet New Hampshire town. Trees out front. A backyard just big enough for Ethan to run around in. It even had one of those old metal air vents in the upstairs hallway — square, waist-height, probably from the '50s. When the central air kicked on, it made a soft hum. It was charming, in that way old things are when you haven’t lived with them in a long time.

Ethan, my son, is five years old. He loves dinosaurs, hates carrots, and has one of those hyperactive imaginations you laugh about with friends until it stops being funny.

About a week after we moved in, he started kneeling near the air vent. At first, I figured he was just feeling the breeze on his face, something I used to do as a kid. But after a while, I’d catch him whispering. Or worse just listening.

“Hey, buddy,” I said one time, kneeling beside him. “What are you doing?”

“I’m talking to the Whisper Man,” he said, as if it were the most normal thing in the world.

Chills.

“Who’s that?”

“He lives in the vent. He tells jokes. He’s funny.”

That night, I laughed it off with my wife, Emily. We figured he was just adjusting to the new place. Maybe a little lonely. Making imaginary friends. But a week later, I heard him again. Late at night. Around 2 a.m. I opened his bedroom door and found him sitting in the dark hallway, back to the vent, whispering. Listening. Whispering again.

“Ethan,” I said too loud in the silence.

He flinched like I’d caught him stealing.

“Bedtime, champ. It’s really late.”

He nodded and stood without a word. I watched him shuffle back to bed and crawl under the blanket.

Just as I turned to leave, he said: “He doesn’t like you.”

I froze.

“Who?”

“The Whisper Man. He said your voice is all wrong.”

My skin crawled. I didn’t respond. Just closed the door and went straight to our bedroom, where I lay awake most of the night.

\*\*\*

Things got worse next week. Ethan’s personality started to shift. Not in some huge, dramatic way just... subtly. He began asking strange questions.

“Do people still scream when you cut their eyelids off?”

“What color is blood when it gets old?”

I scolded him, of course. But he just shrugged, like I was the weird one.

At dinner, he once asked Emily if she thought her skin would come off “in one big piece or little tiny pieces.”

She laughed nervously. I didn’t.

Then came the drawing. He left it on the fridge, stuck under a smiling cow magnet. A crayon sketch of three people: a woman, a boy, and a tall, faceless man standing in front of a big square. The vent. He had written “Family” above them.

There was no dad.

\*\*\*

A few days after teh drawing I confronted Ethan about the Whisper Man.

“So, who is he, really?” I asked, trying to keep my voice calm. “Someone from TV?”

He looked up at me and I swear to God his eyes looked darker. Not the color. Just... darker.

“He told me I’m not allowed to say his name,” he said. “He said your brain would start bleeding.”

“Okay, buddy. That’s enough.”

“He said you don’t belong here.”

I crouched down.

“Listen to me. There’s no one in the vent. It’s just old metal and air. It’s not real.”

He leaned in close enough that I could smell something sour on his breath.

“He told me you’re not my real dad.”

I blinked.

 “…What?”

“He said he took the real one last month. You’re just wearing him.”

I swear, my blood turned to fire in my veins. I grabbed his small shoulders tighter than I should have.

“Don’t say things like that.” He stared at me. Unblinking.

“I want my real dad back.”

That night, I searched the entire house. The attic. The crawlspace. I even unscrewed the vent cover and shined a flashlight inside. Nothing. Just dust, dead spiders, and old cobwebs.

But when I leaned in — really leaned in —I swear I heard something. Not a voice. A rhythm. Like wet breathing. 

I pulled back and shut the cover.

\*\*\*

Emily left last weekend. Not permanently, but she took Ethan to her parents’ place. For a “break.” She said I was scaring him. Said I was acting paranoid. Distant. That Ethan had bruises on his arms.

I’ve never laid a hand on him. Not once. But I did grab him that one time — too hard — after what he said. I tried to explain.

But when I said the word “Whisperer,” she froze. Looked at me like I’d grown a second head.

She said Ethan told her the Whisper Man only talks to him because “Daddy’s meat is too old to hear properly.”

What the hell does that mean? She left with tears in her eyes. Said we needed space and that I should talk to someone.

Now it’s just me in the house. And the vent.

\*\*\*

Last night. I was brushing my teeth when I heard it. Not whispers. Laughter. Children’s laughter. Coming from the hallway vent.

I shut off the water and froze. It went on for five... maybe ten seconds. Then silence. I stepped into the hallway, barefoot on cold wood. The vent was open. The screws were scattered on the floor.

I didn’t remove them. Inside the vent, carved into the metal with something sharp, was a message:

“YOU’RE USING IT WRONG.”

I dropped to my knees. I don’t know how long I sat there.

\*\*\*

Today. Ethan came home. Emily had to grab a few things, so she left him with me for a few hours. Against her better judgment. He wouldn’t look me in the eye. Just sat on the living room floor, drawing. Eventually, I sat next to him.

“What are you drawing, buddy?”

He showed me. It was a picture of me. Only my face was peeling off like a mask, revealing something pale and boneless underneath. A white shape with no eyes and too many fingers. He had written one word beneath it: “Pretender.”

He looked at me and whispered: “He said you’re going to remember soon.”

That was an hour ago. He’s dozing upstairs now. But here’s the thing. Here’s the part that keeps hammering in my skull like a loose tooth:

I don’t remember last month. Not completely. Not clearly. I remember driving home from work one day and then… nothing. And then it’s just me, in this house, helping Emily unpack. Taking Ethan to the park. There’s a gap. A tear in the film reel. And sometimes I wake up already standing.

Once, I found dirt in my mouth. Another time, blood under my fingernails. Just a little. Not enough to matter. Until today. I found something behind the water heater in the basement. Something wrapped in plastic. Rotting. I only unwrapped enough to see the mouth.

It was mine. My real mouth. My real face. The one I’m not wearing anymore.

\*\*\*

I’m not writing this to ask for help. I’m writing this because I think the Whisper Man is real. I think Ethan is the only one who can hear him — because he’s pure. Untouched.

I think the thing in the vent got me, put me on like a Halloween costume, and is still trying to settle in properly. But I’m waking up too much. Fighting back. Maybe that’s why it’s slipping. Why I found the body. Why Ethan keeps drawing things he shouldn’t know.

I hear it now. The laughter. I think it knows I remember. I think it’s coming to finish the job.

If you find this message, check your vents. And for the love of God — don’t listen if something whispers back.
