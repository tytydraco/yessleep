Why don't I put things down when I run? I'm not sure if most people would even find this out about themselves, but I can confidently say at this point that when terrified, I'll just clutch whatever I'm holding and sprint-waddle away. 

I contemplated this as I booked it down the glittery halls of Banks Manor, a heavy black laptop tucked into my armpit. The laptop belonged to a mister Ronald Banks, my latest client. He was a tall blonde German fellow, decorated in neat grey tones and a red pocket handkerchief. 

He was currently on all fours, maniacally chasing me down as the laptop dug into my ribs. 

My eloquent prayers of 'shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit," were interrupted when I drifted around a corner and the floor fell out beneath me.

I wailed as I fell, landing in a soft mess of damp vines and bruising my...ego. The dry marble tones of the hallway zoomed out of sight in favor of a pit of foggy darkness, and I rubbed my hip as I stared up at the rectangular hole I'd fallen through. 

Let me back up a little bit to give you some context here. I'd arrived at Banks Manor about 45 minutes ago after being objectively manipulated by my boss, Eli. 

"Listen Eli, you meet me in person, or I'm not doing any more jobs for you."

"Piper, it wasn't me. I'm investigating it and I promise you, whoever sent you to Mona's will receive what's coming to them."

"Eli, I spent my last two jobs outside of my body. I'm clutching my tits right now just to make sure I've still got them."

Silence. 

I sighed. I really was a pushover. Eli appeared all powerful half the time, but it was clear at this point that for some reason, I was the only person he could call for this work. 

"Okay, dude, you get this one mercy job. After that, you're going to give me some answers or I'm going to track you down and give you a lifetime wedgie."

"Wedgy?" he asked, breaking his silence. 

"See? That right there. That's one of the answers I'm going to want. How do you not know Star Trek or what a wedgie is? Where did you come from? It's like you dropped out of the sky."

"Colder," he said, amused. 

"You said you weren't a demon?" I accused. 

"I'm not. I'm sending you the address."

With that, predictably, he hung up. 

I pulled my abused duffle bag out of the truck and trudged up to a glossy grey mountain of a house. 

At least there aren't any heavy-duty guards here, I mused. I'd done a job for Eli some time back at a similar, albeit smaller, mansion that had posted guards every 15 feet or so. I would later find out that it was to stop the owner, Mr. Kline, an anger-demon of some sort, from escaping. Hopefully whatever this guy's problem was, it didn't require ammunition. 

He looked like a regular person from the outside. Tall, blonde, well-mannered. Never judge a book by the cover. 

"Willkommen," he said when I stepped in, spreading his arms open in invitation. 

"Hey, there. Mr. Banks? I'm called Piper. I'm here to look at your laptop," I offered my hand as I spoke. 

He clutched my hand in his and it felt ice cold, a contrast to the homey warmth exuding from the rest of the space. After he lead me to the laptop in question, we made small talk while I booted it up and clicked around, flicking glances over at his smiling face as he explained his issue. 

"A few days ago, someone broke in. The camera system used to be maintained by a friend of mine, but they're overseas at the moment," he said, running a hand through his honeycomb hair, "Unfortunately, I didn't get a look at the culprit and whoever it was took something very valuable from me. I need to see this footage in order to catch them."

"Oh, I see. Why not just call the cops?" I asked. 

He dropped his head, placing a hand on his hip. 

"The cops and I aren't exactly bedfellows. Plus, I want to deal with this punk on my own, I don't want someone else catching my prey."

That's a weird word for a thief, I thought. I looked him up and down, trying to gauge what kind of supernatural he was. He wore a soft smile and looked more like someone's favorite poet than a vengeful predator.

"Ah, here we go," I said as I finally made my way into the camera server. The password was admin, of course. I made a mental note to have a talk with him about it before I left. I decided I was going to have to start a list of no-no's and start dispensing it to my clients. Rule #1, always change the default password.

We replayed the footage and saw a figure in a black hoodie and jeans prying the side-window apart and slipping in, before scrambling back out clutching a small purple sack. 

We heard a struggle as he landed roughly in the bushes under the window before sprinting away. 

We went out to check it out, and he bent deeply at the waist, taking a hearty sniff of the bush. I raised a brow but said nothing. I was beginning to hedge towards werewolf. Are there German werewolves? I didn't know. 

"Thank you, Miss Piper. I'll make sure you get your payment as soon as you leave. Which you should do now," he said. His voice had slowly gotten deeper as he spoke, his vocal chords seeming to gurgle the words out of the pit of his stomach. 

I took the hint. 

"Ah, of course. Glad I could help," I said, backing away slowly. 

I was on my way back to my truck when the thought struck me that I'd forgotten my duffle bag. Damn it. I really didn't want to go back in where Mr. Banks was brooding, but that duffle has all my main gear. I figured I could slip in and snatch it before he noticed. Idiot.

I knocked first, hoping I wasn't going to get tackled backwards by a giant albino wolf. No answer. 

I was debating how much it would cost me to just replace the whole kit when I heard an exclamation of pain from inside the house. 

"Mr. Banks?" I called, concerned. I heard a commotion that sounded like furniture being turned over and a heavy grunt of someone hitting the ground. I groaned. I wouldn't feel right if I just left him. There were no guards, no heavy gates. Maybe he wasn't a dangerous kind of supernatural? I didn't even believe it myself, but I creaked the door open and slipped inside. 

I peaked my head around the corner of the room with the laptop, and saw Mr. Banks lying limply over my duffle bag. I rushed over and felt his neck, not even sure what I was feeling for. A pulse? I guess? He felt slightly warm, a contrast to the ice his hand had been when we'd shaken. 

I'd tugged my phone out of my pocket and was in the middle of a debate on whether I should call Eli or 911, when his eyes popped wide open. I shrieked, my phone popping out of my hand and bouncing under the couch.

His eyes were blood red, all the way through. No iris, no pupil, just a bloody pit, dripping crimson tears down the sides of his face. 

I was frozen, my hand stuck mid-air as my gaze flipped manically between his ever-darkening expression and the direction my phone slid. Only a few times, though, because after a moment, all I could do was stare straight at those pits of eyes. 

He looked so angry. We froze there for what felt like minutes as I weighed my options, breath stuck in my throat. But before I could come to any meaningful decisions, his hand darted up and placed a vice grip on my wrist. I squeaked, hopefully menacingly, and ripped my hand away before sprinting. I cursed as my knee smashed into the corner of the table, the laptop sliding unceremoniously into my arms as I stumbled to catch it. 

Mr. Banks was on all fours now, growling heavily in what could by no reasonable means be called a human voice anymore. Straightening, the laptop clutched to my chest, I began to back away cautiously. 

I'd gotten two steps when he sprang. 

His pale face was streaked in bloody tears and slobber. It didn't even sound like he was pausing to breath, just a continuous low, menacing sound emanating from his stained lips. 

I stumbled across the doorway and slammed face first into the wall of the corridor, scrambling back before streaking in the opposite direction of the door. I didn't want to set whatever this was loose on the public. 

I clamped one hand over my nose and the other faithfully guarded the laptop as I streaked down the hallways. Sweat was dripping down my face and I heard the clamoring collateral damage behind me as Banks slid into walls, barely missing my coattails as he chased me through his mcmansion. 

In between darting glances this way and that like a chased deer, I wondered why in the hell he wouldn't have security of some kind. At Mona's, I'd heard of some sort of magical council. Shouldn't they be herding their members, taking precautions? 

Banks caught up with me right as I turned a corner, and got a swipe through my thigh, flinging a slash of blood at the walls before I dropped like a sack of potatoes through the floor. 

Banks hovered above me, screaming with rage but seemingly unwilling to join me in the pit. My stomach sank trying to think of what this creature would fear. My thigh was on fire, the blood sticking my pants to my leg and chafing against the wounds. 

After a few moments, I was able to tear my gaze away from the kneeling creature still snapping in my direction and get a feel for my surroundings. Through the mist, I could see two of the walls were bare, and one of them had a doorway with no door, just a rectangular hole in the wall. 

I gingerly rose, tilting my head back to try to stop my nosebleed and clutching my leg. Both to assess the wound and just because it hurt like hell. It seemed shallow, just three thin swipes, and I ripped a piece of my T-shirt off to wrap around it.

I was covered in sweat and soot, and I tried to wipe myself off and take a breath. My stomach was in knots, having barely escaped whatever Banks had transformed into and my only means of escape being a mystery hole in a wall. That's never the option you want left. 

I finally looked down and sighed, exasperated with myself, and set the laptop gingerly on the ground. I'd come back for it when I was bleeding less, I thought. 

Desperately wishing I'd clutched my phone tighter, I took a ginger step into the abyss of the doorway before plunging downwards again. I braced to hit the ground, but after a few seconds, I opened my squinted eyes and swiveled my head around. I was falling through a narrow dark hole, just enough space to reach out and touch the walls. I didn't dare, fearing half the skin on my hand being sheared off. 

I've heard that when people try to commit suicide by jumping, they die before they hit the ground from lack of oxygen, but I was able to breathe. I flailed as carefully as I could, trying to get some friction on the walls. Thank god I was a gymnast briefly as a kid, I managed a messy split and wore half the soles off my shoes slowing myself down. I was finally able to skid to a stop, but looking up, the entrance was gone. I had fallen so far that I doubted I would be able to climb back up. Plus, I had fallen for a solid 30 seconds. I worried I was in some kind of infinite fall, who knows if the top is even there anymore?

I was in full panic. Eli knew I was here, but would he know to search for me in this pit? Could he even get to it? I couldn't breathe, my chest heaving as I darted glances around the small space. I don't know where the light was coming from, but it was a dull red glow that seemed evenly dispersed among the hole. 

I had just about resigned myself to trying to ninja my way back up and praying for the best when the walls seemed to heat up. I felt it on my hands first and cried out, jerking my hands back from the heated wall. Soon it became too hot for my feet and I felt myself slipping. A tear slipped out of my eye as I slowly lost my footing and nudged down the wall. Eventually, I let go and began falling again. 

I screamed, sure I was going to fall into a pit of lava with this heat. But I just kept falling. My hand was still burning. I glanced down and saw one of my fingers glowing a pink energy, and images burst into my head. A car in a snowstorm, sliding on ice. The driver, clad in black gloves, swerved into the slide and slowly balanced out, gaining back it's traction. 

I got the idea. Lean in. This particular finger had been stolen and returned by what we're going to save time by calling a witch. But magic is complicated, doors opened can often be entered by other magical beings. I could be playing into whatever this is by leaning into it. 

Bereft of other options, I gingerly maneuvered my body around until I was facing down. Eagle-bombing towards the floor, I stretched my hands out superman style. I sped up and the heat intensified until I had to cover my mouth with one of my hands. My lips were burning so dry, they would start bleeding soon. 

At the apex of the heat, I hit a bend in the chute and slid unceremoniously into a well-lit treasure room. Piles of gold coins and diamond-encrusted jewelry laid in piles around an ordinary looking chestnut desk. 

I groaned miserably, unsure of which pain to address first, when a shadow fell over my face. I looked up to see a literal dragon. Half the size of the room, covered in emerald scales and ruby highlights. I turned my head to look at a claw the size of a water heater.

"What the fuck are you doing?"

I flinched, but something in me recognized that accent.

"You speak English?" I asked, stupidly. 

The dragon sighed, and I had a moment of manic giggling as he pulled off enormous spectacles that looked like toy glasses on him. 

"Just take some gold. I don't have time for this."

I blinked stupidly, the pain in my leg reigniting now that I was a millimeter more sure In wasn't about to be flambeed. I groaned, pulling my pants up off the wound and trying to readjust. 

"What happened?" he asked. He bent down and sheared through my pants with one long claw. I cried out. He'd been surprisingly gentle, but the scrapes were bleeding heavily and I was still reeling from hitting the bottom of the chute. 

"Ah," he said. He laid one scaly claw against my leg and I felt an intense burning. This was it, I was going to be heated up and popped like a kernel of corn. I moaned and tried to push his claw away but it was like shoving concrete. 

But after a moment, he raised his sticky green claw and revealed a fully healed, although still blood-covered, leg. I gaped at it and then back up at him. 

"That was your only mercy. Most who find a dragons lair would be my dinner. Consider yourself lucky."

"I'm...I'm not here to steal from you, you fucking lizard," I said indignantly. I was done. I had been sure I was about to lose my life one too many times for civility at this point. 

He looked down his long scaled snout at me.

"Then why are you here?"

I stammered for a moment before finally spitting out, "I just want my damned duffle bag."

He paused, looking back at me from the seat he'd returned to behind the desk. Then he exploded in laughter. It was a course laugh, and at the baritones, it sounded like he was growling. I waited for him to finish before standing up and brushing myself off. 

"You stumbled into a dragons lair? How did you make it through the traps?"

"The...the chute? thing?" I asked, continuing at his nod, "I, uh. I had a little help from a friend, I guess." I worried about what I would owe Monica for saving my life. She seemed nice, but magic users never give handouts. 

The desk held a rolled out parchment, next to an amethyst necklace. I loosely recognized it from my work with witches as a location spell. He must be trying to find the crook. I had a sudden realization that I was lucky he didn't think my presence here meant it was me. A brief image of myself encased in fire sent a shudder down my spine.

"So, you can heal people? That's a neat trick," I said.

"Well, it seems as though it was my golem that did it, so it seemed the least I could do, even for a petty thief."

I bristled.

"I told you i'm not here to steal from you. What would I even do with gold? Update your treasure hoard, dude. Maybe if you had an RTX 3080 in here," I mused, looking around.

He cocked his head in confusion and I laughed, the weight of impending death finally sliding from my shoulders. 

"You really want no treasure?" he seemed surprised, his german accent thickening.

"It's not that I'm a good person, you just don't have any good stuff in here," I teased, grinning at him, "I will take knowledge as a payment, though."

I launched a barrage of questions at him, the ones that had been scratching at my soul since I landed down here. 

"You're a dragon? Can you shoot flames? Can you bring people back from the dead? Where'd you get all this treasure? Are you also a witch? Is the tracking spell working? What's a golem?"

I probably should have been just trying to slip out as quietly as I could, but the fact that he hadn't smushed me like an ant yet fed my bravery just enough to ask. I had books upon books of supernatural lore at my house, but I'd never heard of real life dragons living among humans. 

He laughed again. 

"A golem is an empty shell that I can enter with my Lindwurm. Everything else is something we'll have to address later because my essence stone was stolen, and if I don't get it back, you're going to have a super-villain with Drachen powers running around. The council will have my tail if that happens," he finished wearily, taking the necklace in his hand and waving it around the parchment that I was close enough to realize was a hand-drawn map. 

"Begone for now, human. I'll call on you again," he waved a gigantic claw and I found myself dropped outside, next to my truck. My duffle manifested above me and dropped into my arms, pummeling me to the ground like an old cartoon. 

"Oof," I muttered, dragging myself and my bag back into the truck. I tugged the shorts half of my pants up and stared in wonder at the fresh skin there. 

My nose started leaking again and I dropped my head back, when my pocket vibrated. My phone had reappeared in my pocket, and for a moment I had the feeling of a semi-truck passing too close. The feeling of having just escaped being torn apart. If he can find and blink anything he wants anywhere he wants, what could he have done to me?

I fished my phone out of my pocket, and found several worried and one accusatory text from Eli. I decided he could wait until I got home and put on proper pants again.
