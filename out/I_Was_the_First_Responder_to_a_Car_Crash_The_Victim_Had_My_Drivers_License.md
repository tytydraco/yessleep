I’ve been a paramedic for eleven years. You get used to seeing bodies twisted in ways they shouldn’t be, faces you can’t unsee, and sounds that stick in your head long after you take off your gloves.

But nothing — *nothing* — prepares you for seeing your own face staring back at you from a stretcher.

It happened just over three weeks ago.

It was a quiet night. I was halfway through my shift, the usual routine of coffee, paperwork, and bad jokes with my partner, Jules. Dispatch crackled through at 2:13 a.m.: *“Single vehicle collision. Route 17 near mile marker 42. Unknown injuries.”*

Routine enough.

The drive was barely fifteen minutes. No traffic, just the rhythmic hum of tires and Jules humming along to the radio. When we got there, the cruiser lights from a county deputy were already painting the wet asphalt red and blue.

The car — a silver Honda Civic — had slammed into a tree. The front end was crumpled like tinfoil. Steam hissed from the radiator, mingling with smoke. The driver’s door was jammed.

I remember saying, “Let’s get the Jaws,” and Jules nodding before she went around the other side.

I leaned in through the broken window to check the driver. Male. Mid-thirties. Heavy bleeding from the scalp. Pulse — faint but there.

I froze.

Because the man’s face… it was *mine.*

Not just similar. Not just a weird resemblance. It was *me.* The same crooked nose from a high school fight, the same small scar under my left eyebrow, the same short beard I hadn’t trimmed in three days.

My throat went dry.

“Jules,” I said quietly, “get over here.”

She glanced in, expecting a medical issue. When she saw the face, she went still.

“What the hell, Ryan?”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

I checked the man’s pockets, hands shaking, as if I needed proof I wasn’t losing it. I found a wallet. Inside: my driver’s license. My photo. My name. My address.

Everything.

I stared at it so long that Jules had to snap me back. “Hey! He’s still breathing!”

We cut the door and pulled him out. His body was limp, but his chest was rising and falling. I went through the motions — oxygen mask, neck brace, vitals — but every move felt mechanical. Detached.

In the ambulance, as Jules drove, I sat beside him, staring at the face that shouldn’t exist.

He opened his eyes once. Just for a moment.

And I swear on my life — *he smiled at me.*

Then he whispered something I couldn’t hear over the siren.

By the time we reached County General, he was gone. Flatline.

I remember standing there in the ER bay, soaked in blood that felt too familiar, while nurses swarmed around us. Jules was pale. Neither of us spoke.

They took the body to the morgue.



I didn’t sleep for two days.

I kept replaying the scene, the whisper I couldn’t make out, the way his hand had brushed mine as if he meant to hold on.

Eventually, I went back to the hospital. I told the coroner I’d “left some equipment” on the gurney, but really I just wanted to *see him again.*

He was in drawer 14B.

They had cleaned him up. His face — my face — was peaceful now. I checked for any identifying marks that could explain this, some logical reason. But it was all there. The same tattoo on the shoulder. The same mole on the neck.

Then I saw something that made me step back.

A small laceration on the right palm — identical to the one I’d gotten a few hours earlier while cutting open the car door.

Except mine had already healed over.

I told myself it was impossible. Maybe some mix-up. Maybe a twin I never knew about. But I was adopted, and my parents were long gone.

That night, I dug through old boxes of paperwork. Adoption records, birth certificate, anything.

But something was off. My adoption papers were dated **June 17, 1993.**  
The man’s driver’s license said he was born **June 17, 1992.**

One year older.



A week later, I got a call from an unknown number.

When I answered, there was only static at first — then a faint voice:

“Thanks for taking my place.”

Click.

I stared at my phone until the screen dimmed.

The next morning, Jules called me, crying. She’d had a nightmare, she said. In it, I was trapped in a burning car, screaming her name. She could smell gasoline, even after she woke up.

I told her it was just stress.

But when I got to the station, my hands started shaking again.

The new shift roster was posted on the board. My name had been crossed out.

No one could tell me why.

When I went to HR to check my file, the clerk frowned. “There’s no Ryan Harlow listed here. Are you sure you’re with the county EMS?”

I showed her my badge. She looked confused. “This badge number was deactivated last week. After the fatality.”

The room felt like it was closing in.

I stumbled outside.

And that’s when I saw it.

A news van parked across the street. The logo on the side read *Channel 9 News – Fatal Crash Anniversary Coverage.*

The date below it: **November 1st, 2024.**

*Anniversary.*

I don’t know how long I stood there before I realized what it meant.

I pulled out my phone, opened the camera app, and turned it toward my face.

The screen flickered — and for a split second, I didn’t see my reflection.

I saw *him.*

Blood on his forehead. Eyes glassy.

Smiling.

Then the screen went black.

If you’re a paramedic and get a call to Route 17, near mile marker 42—

Don’t come.

Because I’ll already be there.

Waiting to take your place.
