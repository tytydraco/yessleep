*When Death approaches, it will not rise from the earth, nor will it be wearing a cloak or wielding a scythe. Death will arrive from a foreign land, bearing eyes like brilliant jades and hair the color of chestnuts, and it will broadcast only peace. In truth, it does not know what it delivers, but it will deliver it all the same. Little by little, step by step, it conjures Apocalypse.*

*A stranded Leviathan. Angel’s wings clipped. A curtain of night under a bejeweled sky. The demise of a king amidst a sweeping Tempest. Finally, an inferno, wrathful and pure, spreading from sea to sea, cleansing mankind from this world.*

*Listen closely, child: once the inferno ignites, there will be no halting Death’s steady march. Excavate its jades from their hallowed sockets, and their visions of Apocalypse will cease. Leave them be, and you will bear witness to the conflagration that devours humanity.*

*Tell no one what you heard here today.*

\-------------

The sight of the stranded leviathan was beyond surreal.

Shep left the truck first, whistling with awe as his boots hit the sand. Meanwhile, I sat frozen in the passenger’s seat, fixated on the impossible scene only thirty yards down the beach from us. Nervous sweat poured from my entire body, dripping down and pooling into the upholstery of the Sheriff’s car.

No matter how many times I blinked, wishing it away, it was still there.

The crisp snap of fingers broke my trance.

*“Meg - hey - where’d you go?”*

My neck spun towards the noise. With a look of irritation painted on his face, Shep stood outside the passenger’s side window, impatiently waiting for me to respond.

His face softened as I turned toward him, now wearing an expression of concern more than one of annoyance. When I caught a reflection of myself in the side-view mirror, I understood why. My skin lacked color, drained of blood until it sported a dull yellow-white hue like that of an elephant tusk. My pupils were wide and dilated, making my eyes look like two white olives with dark black pimentos. I was the picture of mind-shattering fear. Truthfully, I thought I was doing a better job of hiding my emotions than I actually was.

Not wanting him to worry too much more, I sent him away.

*“Yeah, I’m alright Shep. I’ll meet you out there in a few minutes, okay? I need some space to get my head on straight.”*

He nodded slowly and then walked off towards the beached titan.

Already, our makeshift plan was falling apart.

The division of responsibilities had made sense in the moment; Lucy would stay behind with Barbara to keep her calm. I would go with Shep to tell him more about the prophecy, while also seeing if the whale seemed to fit the criteria for "*a stranded leviathan*”.

But paralytic terror was preventing me from doing either task. I couldn’t force the words out of my mouth on the ride over to the beach, so it was completely silent. And now, I couldn’t force my legs to bring me closer to the stranded leviathan. Inspecting it up close may not provide us with important insight, but I wouldn’t know that until I looked at it myself.

*Maybe I should have stayed with Barb. I bet Lucy would have been out of the car by now.*

The more I thought about it, though, the more I realized this was the only functional distribution of labor. I can’t handle the vortex of Barb’s self obsession on her best days, let alone today.

As I considered the notion that my paralysis was akin to failing my wife, a tiny ember of self-loathing started burning in my chest. Knowing that depreciation might be my only way out of this car, I billowed that ember with everything I had.

*You’re being such a piece of shit, Meg. You’re still that kid listening to the prophecy over the phone and not hanging up. Get the fuck up, you doormat.*

My body exploded into action, inner revulsion melting away the paralysis. I threw the car door open and started sprinting towards Shep and the Leviathan, twisting my ankle as I did, but I ignored the pain.

I hoped Lucy was faring better than I was. It might not seem like it, but she probably had the important assignment.

\--------------

A few summers ago, we had a spree of teenagers ringing doorbells and then running off. No defacement of public property, no burglaries, no assault - no evidence that anyone was in any danger. It was just some dumb kids blowing off steam. Barb did not it see it that way, however. She feared that the criminality was bound to escalate; it was just a matter of when.

As a result of that fear, the woman blasted a UPS delivery man with duck-shot as she answered the doorbell, thinking he was one of the instigators.

Thankfully, the worker was mostly unharmed. Barb is not a marksman and the ammunition itself was rubber. She got off light: a few hefty fines and probation. Paid for the man’s medical bills, too.

Fear can make you a lot of things. It causes me to become paralyzed. It causes Lucy to run and hide. Both aren’t exactly healthy responses, but they aren’t particularly harmful, either.

Barb is a different story. Fear makes her impulsive and violent. The adrenaline is blinding. It transforms her into a person recklessly swinging a knife around in a dark room just because she can’t see anything.

Uncontrolled fear is a cancer - it grows into everything around it, overwriting whatever was there before it as its roots dig deep.

If more than just the three of us have been affected by the prophecy, I’m afraid of the voracious cancer Barb might be able to cultivate.

\--------------

By the time I reached the animal, Shep was already on the phone with environmental services. From what I could tell, he was working on getting a cleanup crew out to the shore as soon as possible to retrieve the carcass. Standing before the stranded leviathan, the smell of death lingered thickly in the air, the salt of the tide and the sulfur of decay combining to form an ungodly stench.

Closer to the omen, I expected my fear to intensify. Instead, I found that it quieted, and a peculiar sadness took over in its place. The majestic animal had died in such an undignified way, sprawled out alone on the beach for everyone to gawk at. 

I did a lap around the dead titan. Wasn’t sure exactly what I was looking for, but I figured I’d know it when I see it. To my relief, there wasn’t anything overtly foreboding about the cadaver. No prophetic phrases carved into its flesh, no mysterious pagan symbology painted onto it, nothing to link it to those damned words other than its arrival alongside the other potential omen, the grounded birds.

But then I saw something that caught my eye.

There was a patch of blackened skin on its underside, partially hidden by the way it had washed up on the shore. The pungent smell kept me from placing my head too close to the scorch mark, but from a few feet away, it looked like an electrical burn. I took a quick snapshot with my phone as Shep began calling to me from the other side of the mammal.

*“You all right over there, Megan?”* he hollered, realizing he had lost track of me while he was on the call.

Before I could respond, he jogged around the corpse until he found me, clearly more than a little concerned about my state of mind.

*“So…is this your stranded leviathan?”* He asked, with a tiny lilt of sarcasm flavoring his speech.

Suppressing a twinge of embarrassment, I shook my head in the affirmative.

*“For the first time in my life, yes, I honestly think so.”*

He focused his gaze on me.

*“What do you mean, 'your life'? I thought these calls you and Lucy had been receiving were new?”* His questions lacked even a modicum of confusion. He spoke with strong, decisive language, giving me the impression that he’d just confirmed a hunch. Apparently, Shep had seen through our lie from the very beginning, or at least had his doubts.

*“Look Shepherd, we didn’t give you the whole truth because the whole truth is absolutely batshit.”*

A small chuckle escaped his lips, and I continued.

*“I’ll give you the full story, but I need to ask a favor first.”*

He walked closer, placing a firm but reassuring hand on my shoulder.

*“And what would that be, ma’am?”*

I struggled to contain the fear that was once again bubbling in my stomach. For Lucy’s sake, I pushed on.

*“Could you drive me over to the arcade on the boardwalk? There’s something I want to show you.*”

*“Everything will make more sense if it’s still there.”*

\--------------

A flick of the wall light bathed the boardwalk’s underground storage room in a faint yellow light. The basement smelled intensely damp, almost fungal. Its scent was stagnant and putrid, like a mausoleum that had been newly unsealed for the first time in a century.

The room lacked any methodical organization. Clearly, the town added broken or retired items to the basement without forethought. The result, unfortunately, was that the area looked more like a junkyard than a storage space.

Shep stood in front of me, surveying the disarray with almost as much amazement as he did the whale corpse. From my vantage on the last descending step of the narrow staircase, I had a little elevation to help me orient myself to the room’s congested architecture.

*“Can you spot the fortune telling machine from where you are?*” Shep asked.

*“Remember, someone may have thrown that thing out years ago.”*

I scanned the room, trying to identify the shape of that windowed crate against the veritable cityscape of refuse. My eyes danced over a half-disassembled bumper car, a snow cone machine that was tipped forward on account of missing its front wheels, and stacks of old signage from businesses that have long since gone extinct. But so far, no luck.

*“Not yet, but this ain’t exactly easy,”* I sighed.

*“Well, if you can’t see it from where you are, I think we’ll have to call this a wash. I don’t want you digging through the garbage. That’s an easy way to throw out a back or contract tetanus,”* he replied.

I felt my phone vibrating in my pocket, but I didn’t let it distract me. I needed to find this damn thing. Even if it didn’t help clarify what was going on, it might help convince Shepherd that everything I told him on the way over was real, rather than some bizarre manifestation of childhood trauma.

\--------------

To Shep’s credit, he listened intently to what I had to say, seemingly without judgment or scrutiny. That said, he was skeptical of the events that I had described.

He was right to be skeptical, even if his disbelief stung.

Memories, he reminded me, aren’t *true* history. They’re more like made for TV movies based on historical events. Truth is the foundation, but that foundation is often buried under layers of emotion, flawed retrospect, and new context as you age.

*You can’t look at memories like they’re fact*, he said, *especially ones that are that old.*

Wisdom that would only become more crucial as the events of the evening unfolded.

\--------------

Just then, I saw it. The bottom half of a wrinkled face framed behind plexiglass barely visible from under nautical props that used to be part of a popular mini-golf course.

“*There!*” I screamed, pointing a tremulous finger at the appriation from my childhood.

Shep followed the trajectory of my gesture, and locked his eyes onto what I saw. It took him a few minutes, but he was eventually able to drag the machine out from the rubble.

Once Shepherd had placed the box in front of me, I knew it was the right one. But it was so different from what I remembered.

First off, the material that made up the crate wasn’t jagged and splintered, like coffin wood. Instead, it was actually cheap plastic painted to look like drift wood. Not only that, but the face in the window was not nearly as haunting as I recalled. The skin was tattered and gray-blue like I remembered, but the expression was neutral and unoffensive. A little uncanny, sure, but not demonic or supernatural, like the memory that lived in my head.

I remembered one thing correctly. The plastic machine displayed “*The Last Great Seer*” embroidered in gold typography above its face.

*“This is it? This is what has you and Lucy so freaked out?”* Shep asked, dubious that so much fear could be born out of such a benign-looking contraption.

I ignored his question, instead asking, “*Is there any way to turn it on?*”

He spun his head around the perimeter of the machine and found that the power cord was still present and intact.

*“Sure, Meg. Let me see if this old devil still runs.”*

The sheriff started looking for a power outlet. As he did, I felt warm comfort drip slowly into my veins. I carefully inspected the box. There was no way this ancient thing could really have given us so much heartache.

Maybe this is all just a terrible coincidence. I mean, Barbara grew up around this town, too. It’s possible that she experienced the prophecy from this machine early in her childhood, the same as we did. It didn’t fully explain what was going on with the birds, nor the beached whale, and it certainly didn’t explain the motives of our shared tormentors, but those loose threads didn’t mean an apocalypse was on its way, hot on the heels of our kind Icelandic neighbor.

The only thing I noticed that was a bit odd was a small T-shaped hole on the back of the machine. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say it looked like where you’d plug a landline into.

Almost like someone could’ve used the animatronic fortuneteller as a phone.

As if in response to my internal rationalizations, something abruptly plunged the storage area into complete darkness.

*“Damn buggy wiring,”* Shep said from somewhere deeper within the blackness.

“*Meg, you still on that last step? Can you flick the light and see if it comes back on?*”

“*Yep, I’m on it.*”

I carefully leaned forward, gripping the banister with one hand while sliding the other up and down the surface of the wall to my right, looking for the switch. Eventually, I found it, and I began moving it up and down. The knob clicked, but no light came to our aid.

*“No luck, Shep.”*

I reached my hand out until I found the sheriffs shoulder, and I guided him safely back onto the stairs. Once we got back to the ground level, a pounding terror ripped into my torso.

The top of the stairs dumped us out in front of the boardwalk. In the time we had been in the storage area, twilight had transitioned into a moonless night. But it shouldn’t have been as dark as it was. The boardwalk is littered with street lamps that automatically come on before sunset. But just like the storage area, they were all empty of light.

Shep climbed out of the stairway behind me, swearing as he did. He had noticed something in the sky, opposite to the direction I was looking.

*“My Lord, what in the living fuck is that?”*

When I turned around, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. The blue green light reflected damningly off of Shepherd’s wide eyes, confirming my worst fears.

Above us, there were gleaming, twisting sheets of cosmic light. I counted five separate bars, each of them the size of multiple football fields. They were primarily aquamarine, accented by some smaller flecks of indigo. It reminded me of the aurora borealis, but we sure as shit weren't in the great north.

I couldn’t hold back the words. It felt like withholding an exhale. If I didn’t let it spill out of me, I was liable to suffocate.

*“A curtain of night under a bejeweled sky.”*

In a flash, I remembered Lucy was under the same sky. But not with me.

She was with Barb.

I wrenched my phone out of my pocket; the heavens tinting the screen ghostly, neon colors as I saw what I ignored while searching for *The Last Great Seer.*

4 missed calls from Lucy, followed by a text message and a picture.

*“Barb gathered nearly everyone at the chapel, except Ari. Practically everyone in town was tormented by the prophecy when they were young. They’re all acting crazy. What they’re talking about doing is insane. Voting about what to do first. Come ASAP and bring Shep.”*

Although none of us are religious, we use an abandoned Pentecostal church as our town hall. It’s the biggest communal space we have.

The picture was hazy and out of focus, which I took to mean that Lucy had taken it in secret. There was a white board next to the pulpit, which was covered in things like:

***-Excavate its jades from their hallowed sockets, and their visions of Apocalypse will cease. ?Remove eyes. (5 Tally marks next to it)***

***-Excise the bull’s manhood, and Apocalypse will fall. ?Castration (2 Tally marks)***

***-Flay its carapace, and Apocalypse will be exposed. ?Skinning (4 Tally marks)***

The list went on and on.

Standing at the pulpit, I could clearly see Barb, eyes burning with frenzy, hands gesturing wildly toward the pews.
