I’m writing this from my bathroom. The door is locked, and the shower is running so he can’t hear me typing. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should call the police or a priest, but I need to get this down while I’m still thinking straight.

It happened today. God, was it only this afternoon?

My son, Toby, turned six. Toby has had a rough year since his mom walked out. He’s been quiet. Too quiet. He spends hours in the backyard just... staring. Or digging holes. The therapist said it was normal for a kid in his situation to want to "control his environment."

I wanted to give him one good day. He asked for a clown, but money is tight. I couldn’t afford the $300 professional agencies. I found a flyer stapled to a telephone pole near the school: *UNCLE BUMBO. $50 FLAT RATE.* No phone number, just an address three blocks away.

I went to the house on Friday. It was a wreck—overgrown weeds, peeled paint. I knocked, but no one answered, so I left a note with my address and a $50 bill in the mailbox.

Today, at 2 PM, Uncle Bumbo showed up.

He looked... rough. His yelloow satin suit was filthy. His wig was matted. His makeup was caked on like dry plaster. And the smell—it was this sickly, sweet stench of mothballs and damp earth.

"Hey, thanks for coming," I told him at the door. "Just keep it PG, okay?"

He didn't say a word. He just nodded—a slow, weird movement where his head dipped too low—and shuffled past me into the backyard.

I watched from the kitchen window while I prepped the hot dogs. He was terrible. He didn't do magic. He didn't make balloon animals. He just sat in the white plastic lawn chair in the middle of the grass and let the kids swarm him.

But the kids loved it. Especially Toby.

Toby climbed right into his lap. He grabbed the clown's hand and waved it around. He poked the red nose. He was laughing—actually laughing—for the first time in months.

"Look, Dad!" Toby yelled at one point. "He's a heavy sleeper!"

Then Toby punched the clown in the stomach. Hard.

I winced. "Toby! Be nice!"

The clown didn't react. He didn't flinch. He just slumped there, grinning that painted red grin, staring at the sky.

I figured the guy was drunk or high. But for fifty bucks, as long as he didn't fall over, I didn't care.

By 5 PM, the party was over. The other parents picked up their kids. One mom wrinkled her nose as she left. "You might want to check your plumbing, Arthur. Something smells dead in your yard."

When the last car pulled away, I walked into the backyard.

Uncle Bumbo was still sitting in the chair.

"Okay, pal," I said, walking over. "Show's over. You can go home."

He didn't move.

"Hey." I reached out and shook his shoulder.

He was stiff. Not tense—*rigid*. Like wood.

I shoved him, just a little.

He tipped over. The whole chair tipped with him. He hit the grass with a heavy, solid *thud*, but his limbs didn't flop. His arm stayed stuck in the air, frozen in that awkward wave.

His head hit a landscaping rock. The impact popped the red plastic nose off.

Underneath, the skin was black and purple. I saw things moving in the nasal cavity. Maggots.

I scrambled back, falling on my ass. I started dry heaving. The guy wasn't drunk. He was a corpse. He had been dead for days. Rigor mortis had set in.

"Toby!" I screamed, scrambling to my feet. "Get inside! Don't look!"

But Toby was standing right there. He was holding a slice of cake. He wasn't looking at the body with fear. He was looking at it with annoyance.

"You broke him," Toby said flatly.

My brain couldn't process it. "Toby... do you know who this is?"

Toby tok a bite of cake. "It's Mr. Henderson. The homeless man who sleeps in the shed down the street."

The world started to spin. "How... how did he get here?"

"I used my wagon," Toby said, licking icing off his thumb. "I pulled him here this morning before you woke up. He was heavy."

I stared at my son. My six-year-old son. "He's dead, Toby. He's dead."

"I know," Toby said. "He wouldn't do the magic trick I wanted. So I gave him some of your sleeping pills. The blue ones. I put them in his whiskey bottle."

I stopped breathing. My sleeping pills. I had just refilled them last week. I checked the bottle this morning—it was empty. I thought I had misplaced them.

"I put the makeup on him so he’d look fun," Toby whispered, looking down at the rotting man. "But he was boring. He just sat there."

Toby looked up at me. His eyes were empty. There was no guilt. No horror. Just a cold, calculation.

"Can I have a pony next year?" he asked. "Ponies don't sleep as much."

I sent Toby to his room. I told him to play his video games. I haven't called the police yet. If I call them, they take my son away. They put him in a facility.

But I’m looking at the lock on the bathroom door, and it looks so flimsy.

I can hear footsteps in the hallway. Small footsteps. They just stopped outside the door.

"Dad?" Toby is calling. "Are you in there? I want to show you a magic trick."

I don't think I'm going to open the door.
