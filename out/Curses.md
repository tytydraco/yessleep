"I just don't like the way they talk to each other." I told Henry once we were alone. 

Even though I had dated Henry for nearly five years now, this was the first time I'd met his family. It hadn't seemed odd to me once we'd first met, Henry was American after all and America is a long way away from England. Once I'd realised that he had more than enough money to go and visit them but never chose to, then it seemed a little odd. But the truth he'd told me at the time was that he wanted to find out who he was apart from them. I didn't understand, but I respected the boundary.

"What do you mean?" Henry asked.

"Seriously? I mean the way they're always cursing at each other."

Once Henry had proposed we'd decided that a trip out to his family was for the best. Henry had started speaking to them again last year so clearly whatever crisis of self discovery he'd been having had finally resolved itself. He'd told me that his family were rich and successful enough and that he'd wanted to find success that wasn't simply handed to him. Now that he'd made a name for himself in business circles despite only moving into that field a couple of years ago, I figured that he was happy that he'd found a life that nobody could claim was bought for him.

"Some people just swear more." Henry said, "It's fine."

"It's too much."

Being around Henry's family was overwhelming at first. His sister was a model I'd seen on magazines, his father wasn't a man I'd heard of but was a higher up in a product development company I certainly had heard of and his mother was a very well known writer, albeit under a pen name. Polite conversation revealed that the family had been enjoying success for some time and that Henry's cousins (who weren't there today but I was told I would definitely be meeting next time) were also some combination of rich, well known and famous. The first time I heard Henry's mother swear I had to bite my cheek not to laugh. It seemed hilairious, this incredibly posh and proper woman casually calling her husband a bastard.

By the fifteenth time it wasn't so funny anymore.

"I suppose it's just what you're used to," Henry argued, "I mean I call some of them bastards and they say it back. None of us mind."

"Well I do mind. Are you going to talk to me like that next?"

"I would never s-"

"Then clearly you can see that it's not normal. So if you wouldn't speak to me like that and aren't going to talk to our child like that then do *not* try to make me seem crazy for being uncomfortable."

Henry was silent.

"When are we even supposed to be telling them that little fact anyway?"

"I think I should tell them by myself so th-"

I shook my head.

"No. Don't be ridiculous. I'm the one who's actually pregnant, I deserve to be part of the announcement."

"Of course." Henry nodded, "We'll tell them together."

But that was a lie.

The next day I woke up in the bed alone to the sound of an argument somewhere else in the house. A slamming noise made me sit up bolt upright and two of the voices were getting steadily closer. Finally, the door to our bedroom was thrown open by Henry's sister Eve with Henry himself only a few steps behind. He tried to drag her back out but the pleasant, friendly woman I met yesterday slapped him across the face.

"She deserves to know," Eve said quietly, "and since you didn't have the guts to tell her, I will."

Henry didn't explain himself but sat heavily on the floor with his head in his hands. Eve looked at him with disgust before turning her attention back to me.

"I'm really sorry, but we aren't who you think." Eve said.

"You aren't... Henry's family?" I asked confusedly.

She laughed quietly.

"Yes and no, I suppose. I don't know how to... Right. You know that I'm a model?"

It was a stupid question. There were probably people living under rocks who recognised Eve's face. She searched on her phone for something and then showed it to me.

"Now honestly, do you think that girl could be a model?"

I could only figure out that the teenager in the photo was Eve from context - they barely even looked similar. She wasn't hideous there by any stretch but the girl in the photo was fairly average and there were changes between younger Eve and current Eve that growing up and a good make up team weren't enough to cover.

"I look different, right?" Eve prompted, "More of a glow up than you were expecting?"

"If you're worried that I've seen photos of you in the house and would tell reporters you've had surgery then I would never. I don't care. Isn't plastic surgery normal for models anyway?"

Eve looked sad.

"That's the thing, I never had surgery. I saw some model show on TV once and I was just blown away by the glamour of it. Once I'd decided that was what I wanted my hair got shinier, I got taller, even my pupils changed colour just a bit. Before the year was out I was approached by a model talent scout without any of us reaching out for one. It was like someone else was pulling the strings and if you look into the success of any of the other family members then they'll have a similar story."

"I tried to get away from it." Henry said quietly, "I thought that maybe if I put enough distance between me and my family then maybe the success wouldn't follow me, but it did. I even tried changing careers and that wasn't enough to throw it."

I laughed.

"You're talking like this is a curse! You're upset because you're successful? Really?"

"Someone's pulling the strings for us. Henry said that you'd noticed that we kept saying 'bastard' at each other. Did you notice we didn't say it about everyone?"

I had, though not at first. Eve, Henry and their father were all sworn at but their mother wasn't once. In a story about one cousin the word 'bastard' featured heavily but in another it wouldn't be said once.

"There is a man in this house that you think that we're related to," Eve said, "but it is important for you to know that we aren't."

"So your big secret is that your mother cheated with someone powerful?"

"She never cheated. Neither did my uncle, my cousin, my grandmother or anyone else who married or dated their way into this family. They didn't have to. Yet even without them cheating if you were run a DNA test half of it would come back as of our lineage but the other half, it wouldn't even make sense. The results would squirm in front of you and we know that because far away from prying eyes we've looked ourselves. We're not human Katie, not really. And we may live a charmed life, literally I suppose, but we know it isn't our own."

"That wouldn't even make sense at a basic level." I argued, "Maybe the man I thought was your father isn't biological. That wouldn't mean that the DNA you have that doesn't come from your mother is inhuman but maybe it's not his. But your uncle can't get a woman pregnant and then it be related to him but not the woman he's had sex with."

"You're still thinking like a human." Eve said glumly, "but things like eggs and sperm and gametes are meaningless to the creature our ancestor made a deal with. A long time ago a man offered offspring for success and *maybe* he only meant his own but that deal has been kept in our family all the way to present day. If you want to birth my brother's child then I'm not trying to stop you but you have to understand that it won't be yours."

"Then whose would it be?"

"Something unknowable. Something that can give us everything we want if we respect it or ruin us if we don't. Calling each other bastards is a way of showing that respect. Never calling the man who raised us by... the title that role would usually imply is another."

"You both look like normal humans to me."

Eve nodded.

"We look this way because we are permitted to. I told you that I was made to look beautiful when I desired it. Likewise, family members who have direspected the being who has given us our gifts, our actual father, they get transformed too. In a far less pleasant way."

Henry was crying and I wondered how long he'd believed the things I was being told.

"I don't believe you." I said finally, "I'm going home."

It had never occurred to me that someone might stop me. It hadn't even occurred to me that my plane ticket back to the UK wasn't for another week. Fortunately, neither of these points really mattered.

"If it had been a few years ago then I'd have no way of proving any of this to you," Even said with tears in her eyes, "but we used to have a brother. He did something that greatly offended our father and..."

She trailed off, her voice too thick with emotion to continue. Henry was sobbing at this point.

"You said we looked human." Eve said once she'd gotten herself slightly more under control, "The man in the basement doesn't look human anymore. We couldn't let someone find him but we couldn't... we couldn't kill him either. I'll leave you to think about it but if you want to keep the child growing inside you or to remain part of this family then you need to believe me. Nobody will stop you from going home, I'll send you enough money for a first class plane ticket as soon as we're downstairs. But if you need proof then come find me."

With that, Eve led Henry out of the room and left me alone with my thoughts.

I began to pack straight away but only a few minutes in I was sat on the bed on my phone, googling Henry's family with an intensity that I should have done years ago. I couldn't find everyone but anybody that I could find was a success. If they changed career paths then that instantly went swimmingly for them, just as it had with Henry. I couldn't find anything suspicious but then again would someone or something powerful enough to let people almost waltz into being CEO's and movie stars really not be able to cover up or spin a couple of disappearnaces here and there?

The idea of respect being important made me think of the tales of fairies I'd been told when I was small. Granted, the idea of humans calling each other bastards and humans being so scared that they'd call magical beings fair folk wasn't the exact same but it was similar enough. The photos Eve had showed of her younger self weren't enough to prove her story but her modelling debut hadn't been much after and the photos online were drastically different. Photoshop would make sense for the professional shoots but when she'd gotten famous enough that paparazzi and bystanders alike would snap her photo in the street it was no longer as certain an excuse.

Did I believe her? If not, would I leave?

As if in protest to my stress I felt a kick from inside me.

"Don't worry," I said in a soothing tone, "We'll have each other no matter what else happens. I love you."

Then after a pause I added two more words for safety.

"You bastard."

That was it then. I needed to know the truth for the baby's sake, if not my own.

I went to ask to take a look at the man who lives in the [basement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leavesandink/).
