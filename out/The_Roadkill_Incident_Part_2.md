Next thing I knew I was in a field. The sun beamed warm, white light and a weeping willow stood in front of me. Dandelions swayed in the gentle breeze, filling the air with a fresh, earthy scent. A blue butterfly fluttered by, evoking memories of simpler times. I felt no sickness, only peace. It looked like my grandparents ranch, the last place I truly felt at ease. I reached out to touch the butterfly, but it vanished before I could register its presence. 

A low, deep, and unsettling voice rang in my head, “*Ben*.”

I woke up still on the floor, leaned against the wall, shotgun in hand. Kevin lay on the floor across from me, thankfully still breathing. He was fast asleep. I turned my head to the microwave clock. Nine in the morning. We had been asleep for a few hours. I still felt massively weak, but the rest had built up some energy, allowing me to move a little. I shifted my way up the wall and lifted myself up, groaning in pain as I ascended, staring at the blood-filled vomit on the floor. 

“*Benjamin*,” I heard the voice again. “*Benjamin, please let me out*,” it begged.

I couldn’t pinpoint where the voice was coming from. It was panning from ear to ear like Kevin said. It was everywhere. Then, it started to moan, sounding sad. I covered my ears trying to drown it out. “Shut the fuck up!” I screamed.

“*It’s so cold. Please let me out. Please. Please*.” 

“Where are you?!” I shouted. Kevin started to shuffle. “Where the fuck are you?!” 

“*I can make the pain go away, Ben. I can heal you of this burden*.”

“Where are you?” I asked again firmly.

“*Open the garage, Ben*.” 

My heart sank. The thing I locked up, was it talking to me? I couldn’t tell what was real anymore. Was I just hallucinating from the miasma or ‘Radiation Poisoning’ plaguing everyone?

“*I won’t ever leave. Not unless I get what I want. Only then I can cure you and Kevin of what ails you both*.”

“How can you do that?” I asked the monstrosity, eyeing the locked door.

“*You would never be able to understand*.” 

“How do I know you won’t kill us?”

Silence.

“Answer me!” I demanded.

Nothing.

Kevin started shifting himself awake, slowly lifting his head. He coughed and spat up blood. His eyes were nearly sunken into his skull, and his face and head were covered in small, burn-like blisters. I rushed over to him to help him up. He could hardly speak, but he uttered some words that terrified me. “I don’t wanna feel like this anymore, Ben.” 

“Me neither.” 

“It said it could fix us.”

“Has it been speaking to you too?”

He spit more blood onto the floor and nodded.

“Kev, it’ll kill us.”

“How do you know that?” He angrily frowned at me. I noticed him eyeing the shotgun in my hands.

“My instinct. You didn’t see its face under the truck. It looked right at me and it smiled.” I pulled my shotgun back and stepped away to give myself some space. “It was the most evil, cunning smile I’d ever seen. Anything that looks like that doesn’t have us in it’s best interest. I had to run away from it instead of shooting it for christ’s sake! As far as I’m concerned, that thing stays in the garage until I can figure something out. We can’t go anywhere.” 

He just stood there staring me down, holding his shoulder as he had been laying on the floor for a couple of hours. I painfully slung the shotgun sling over my right shoulder, wincing as I did. A dry cough escaped my throat. I grabbed a glass of water and downed the entire thing, then offered one to Kevin. He declined, not looking up to look me in the eye. 

“What, Kev?”

He spoke up, resentment in his tone, “I don’t want to be sick anymore, Ben. It said it can help us.” His pale, patchy head was lit by the bright sunbeams beaming through the living room blinds. Shadows cast over his sunken eyes, making them appear entirely dark, with the glint from his tears giving the impression of white pupils. He sounded genuinely hurt, as if I had just delivered the worst news of his life. All I did was just stand there. Some silence passed until I finally responded.

“We’re not opening the door, Kev.” I firmly told him. “I’m not letting that thing out. We will figure something out.”

“You also told me you’d get me a doctor.” 

“I feel just as bad as you. I don’t feel like a doctor can help.”

“I highly doubt that.” His words carried a chilling breeze with them. 

I did my best to ignore him and peered outside. Living in the country meant neighbors were few and far between. From what I could see of the neighboring houses, some people were dead on their lawns, while only a few were staggering slowly, resembling zombies in agony. 

I noticed a large shape in my peripheral. Mr. Reynolds was walking towards my garage door, crowbar in hand. He had no teeth and lost all his hair. His skin was red, as if sun burnt, and he had a look of rage on his face. My garage had a sturdy, aluminum door that I had locked electronically. I was confident he wouldn’t get in. He just eventually started banging on the door a few times and attempting to lift it, but only failing. 

“Ben!” He shouted as he made his way to the front door. “We have to let him out!” He started jiggling the knob to no avail. “Open the fucking door! He said he can make me feel better!” 

My heart leapt into my throat, throbbing with a cold, unsettling dread, like a creature trying to claw its way out. I grabbed my shotgun tensely, hoping I wouldn’t have to use it. 

“I got my shotgun here, Bob! Don’t make me use it!” I could see his gaze through the small window in the door wide and full of anger. He started slamming his shoulder into the door. “I know you feel it too, Ben. We could all feel better once you let him out!” 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Bob. Please go home.” I pumped my gun and aimed it in front of me with all the strength I had. Adrenaline surged through me, giving me a boost. Even though my door was locked, Reynolds was a retired fireman, so he had knowledge on how to break down a heavy door. I stood my ground and waited for it to come down. 

After about ten slams, the door gave way, and he stumbled in, crowbar still in hand. He cursed under his breath and scrambled to his feet as quickly as he could. His cheek was bruised, and he was missing more teeth. He was falling apart. I hadn’t taken the shot yet, but I gave him another warning. 

“I said go home, Bob. You’re not yourself. I’m not opening the garage.” 

He made eye contact with Kevin, “Your friend here wants it too.”

“Well he’s not fucking getting it!” I raised my shotgun level with his head, finger on the trigger. “Now get the fuck outta my house!” 

He screamed and lunged at me, swinging the crowbar, nearly knocking the barrel of the gun away from his head. This whole move was his complete undoing. 

There was a deafening bang and a bright flash in front of me. When the light died down, Mr. Reynolds no longer had a head. A jagged, bony stump of spine stood straight up, blood spurting out like a fountain. Flaps of meat hung down to the shoulders, and his corpse crumbled to the floor, blood pooling everywhere. From the barrel of the gun, a line of smoke flowed out like a spirit. 

I ejected the spent shells and pulled the last two that I had in my coat pocket. My hands trembled as I reloaded the gun. I never killed anyone before. My mind felt fractured. Adrenaline was the only thing keeping me moving. Voices scrambled in my head, calling me a murderer. Shocked, all I could do was stand still. The front door was still wide open, the wind whistling in. I started to feel sick. 

I turned away crumbling to the floor and vomited once more, blood mixing in with the bile. A terrible, putrid stench began to permeate the room. I was certain I just shit myself, feeling only liquid and possibly blood in there too. 

“*Let me out!*” The voice in my head shouted, extending each word with relentless persistence. It felt like my head was splitting in half. I winced and yelled, gripping the sides of my head in agony. 

I should’ve paid more attention to Kevin. Everything that had just happened unfolded in a mere thirty seconds, giving him just enough time to gain the upper hand and attack me. He rushed up behind me, locking me in a choke hold. I dropped the shotgun as he pulled me back, and we wrestled desperately on the floor. 

I struggled to reach for the weapon, but Kevin kicked it away with his foot and tightened his forearm around my neck, choking me. I fought back ferociously, tensing my neck to make it harder for him to maintain his grip. Desperately, I clawed at his face, finally finding his eyes and digging my fingers in, scratching down his face, my fingernails peeling off in the process.

I felt horror beyond words when I pulled off his face. His skin peeled away effortlessly, chunks of his flesh dropping onto my shirt, blood filling my mouth. He screamed and tightened his grip. A primal monster, driven by a desire just to feel normal again. 

I could hear him under his breath, “Yes, mom.” I kept clawing at his face with whatever fingernails I had left, feeling bone beneath my fingertips. No lips, no nose, and no skin. I had worn his face down to nothing, and we still fought. Rolling over onto my knees, I managed to get my arms underneath his forearms. I could breathe again, if only briefly. 

I didn’t have much fight left in me. In a ditch effort, I reached for Reynolds crowbar. 

I reached, and he pulled.

I reached again. 

He pulled back. 

My final reach turned into a desperate tug of war with my neck, choking me further. Despite the suffocation, I managed to grab it, swing it back, and hit Kevin in the face with it from behind. He let go, collapsing onto the floor, but only closer to the garage. Gasping for air, I turned to face him. He struggled to pull himself up, holding his exposed skull above the right eye. I thought I saw his eyes turn red. 

It was a reflection from something now floating in the living room. Initially unsure, within seconds, I recognized it was a drone. Despite its presence, my focus remained on Kevin. Perhaps some voyeur was spying on our fight, but I didn’t care. I watched as he stumbled his way to the garage door.

“I just want to be better!” He unlocked and opened the door. A twisted smile stretching across what remained of his cheeks. 

The light from within spilled out and he stood there, a haunting figure in the doorway. Within seconds, a growl erupted from the creature and it lunged at Kevin like a lion on a gazelle. It’s teeth and claws shredding at him like a flesh plow. As this happened, the drone swiftly flew out of my house. 

Kevin’s screams were shrill, bloodcurdling. He was being brutally mauled by the thing. It picked him up, shaking him like a dog toy, then dropping him and repeating. His flesh was torn and flung all over the place. Amidst his screams, he shouted things that saddened me deeply. 

“MOMMY! NO MOMMY NO I LOVE YOU!” Kevin’s cries echoed through the room as the creature continued to maul him. After a minute or so, he was dead, his body flopping to the floor like a rag doll, blood pooling. The creature then turned its attention to me, giving me that same, godforsaken smile it gave me earlier.

I turned and ran for my shotgun. Just as I grabbed it and turned around the thing was right behind me. I fired, the blast sending it reeling, but it was still alive. Struggling to get up, I realized I had no more shots on me. I dropped the gun and reached for the crowbar. The abomination rose to its feet glaring at me with a malevolent intensity. It began to step towards me slowly, growling, its teeth vibrating ominously. 

I raised the crowbar with both hands, ready to give it my all “C’mon you ugly fuck!” 

As it prepared to pounce, a deafening bang erupted and blinding white light filled the room. I dropped the crowbar, clutching my ears against the ringing. As the light faded, I began to hear men’s voices. Suddenly, I was forced to the ground, and as my vision cleared, I found myself staring down the barrel of an M4 assault rifle. 

“Don’t fucking move!” the voice yelled. 

Men in yellow hazmat suits swarmed the area. The creature was now ensnared in some industrial grade metal net? It flailed about screeching and making other noises that aren’t recognizable. More men arrived with a glass tank with quarter size holes lined across the top. They managed to scoop the thing up, and with some struggle they dropped it into the small prison. It slammed against the glass, creating a huge racket. Several men removed the tank from the house while I still had a gun pointed to my face. Others began placing Mr. Reynolds and Kevin into body bags. 

“Should I take this one out, sir?” The man with the gun asked. Another man approached from behind, his face visible through his hazmat suit. He had small, circular glasses, and a nice neatly kept beard. 

“No he’s a dead man anyway. Don’t waste a bullet. Go outside and help.”

“Yes sir,” he replied, lowering his gun and walking out.

The older gentleman crouched down to my level, his hazmat suit squeaking like cheap leather pants. A look of genuine praise spread across his face. “Congratulations, kid, you're a hero.” 

“What?” I responded, confused. 

“If you never locked that thing up, we never would’ve found it. You did a good job standing your ground with it. Most are very easily persuaded by it. It’s a master of manipulation. You didn’t let it get to you.”

“You said I was dead anyway. You’re saying you can’t help me?” I asked, my eyes filled with a fleeting ray of hope that was quickly dashed. 

“No. I’m sorry.” He looked sad. “You were in its vicinity for hours. There's nothing I can do. Same goes for everyone in the area.” 

I started to cry. I knew for sure now death was on the way. There was no hope. 

“Hey, I promise, your death will not be in vain, sir. You did an amazing thing. Something that we couldn’t do. Your family will know. Everyone will know.” He placed a hand on my shoulder. “I didn’t want this to happen. You saved everything.” He stood up, making old man sounds on the way. He motioned for all his men to leave the house. As they filed out, he paused at the door, looking back at me one last time, “Sincerely, thank you.” Then he shut the door, leaving the weight of his words and the silence of the aftermath. 

The house was quiet, an eerie stillness settling over the scene. It was nothing but a cesspool of bodily fluids. Blood, vomit, and the stench of shit and death permeated the air. The metallic taste of blood lingered, as if I had put pennies in my mouth.

I couldn’t believe everything that had happened in the past few hours. My life had completely changed and was now coming to an end within the span of one night. He kept calling me a hero, but I sure don’t feel like one. How can I be a hero when I’m responsible for the deaths of so many people? 

Kevin would’ve never been involved if I didn’t call him. I should've just gone and taken care of the thing alone. I should’ve never called into work. Was all of this even really for a good cause? 

I just couldn’t let that thing out. I had a gut feeling nothing good would come of it, and unfortunately, I was right. Whatever it was, it had the ability to infiltrate our minds, manipulate, and disturb us to do its bidding. The sickness it emanated, whether it be radiation or something else, was a living nightmare, and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. I suppose anyone strong enough could resist it. I had no idea I was capable. I always thought I was weak-willed, especially being an alcoholic and prone to temptation. I guess, in a way, I learned a lot about myself within these past few hours. It’s a shame I’ll never get to apply these lessons to my life, which I could feel was slowly starting to fade. 

I decided to write all this down and report what happened to the best of my ability. I don’t know if it will make any sense to anyone; hell, it still doesn’t make sense to me. I’m actively dying on my couch typing this out, so I don’t care if you believe me or not. Whoever does, feel free to speculate and theorize. I’ll be dead before I get any answers, so hopefully someone will have them. 

I just got up to make myself one final drink and I saw my reflection in a picture frame in the kitchen. I look like a skeleton. Half of my fingernails are gone, and most of my hair has fallen out without me noticing. Maybe in the tussle with Kevin.

I can see an orange glow outside and the smell of burning wood is very potent. I got up to look out the window and the strangers were shooting flamethrowers into the houses in my neighborhood. Smoke billowing into the sky, making it look overcast. There’s so much, it’s blotting out the sun. 

I’m sorry, Kevin. I’m sorry about your mom and all the pain you endured tonight. I’m sorry I never really got to know you. You seemed like a good dude, and most importantly I should’ve never called you. You most likely never would’ve experienced any of this if I hadn’t. I’m so very sorry. You deserved every bit of life and it was my selfishness that led to your death. 

Every time I close my eyes I can see the weeping willow. In the corner of my eye in the hallway, I think I can see my grandmother peeking her head around the corner smiling at me unnaturally. I can catch a glimpse of a blue butterfly fluttering in her direction. I think I’m going to find some shells for my shotgun because I can hear them outside now. I don’t want to burn alive in my last moments. To everyone who knew me, and everyone who didn’t, goodbye.
