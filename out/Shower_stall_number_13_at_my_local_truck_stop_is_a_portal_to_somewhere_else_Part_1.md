*I said I'd never go back...* 

I paced the floor, dragging my knuckles against the living room wall. 

*Maybe just another peek...* 

***NO!.....****no.* 

I stopped when I noticed the string of blood. It was bold and almost angry against the eggshell paint. I'd always hated the textured walls and ceiling of this house, hiding dirt and grime in the swirls. 

The landlords way of getting the drywall done cheap, no sanding or finishing required, I was sure of it. 

I brought my knuckle to my mouth, the taste of blood was bitter and coppery. 

*Fuck it...* 

There was no resisting the allure of that frequency. The eternal hum that hung in the air when I'd discovered that other place. I'd been too afraid to see beyond the veil for more than a second... but that glimpse...

It consumed me.... it was all I could think about.

After climbing into my old Toyota I hesitated, keys hovering an inch away from the ignition. 

My gut, intuition, the Holy Ghost, whatever you wanted to call it screamed for me to go back inside, to forget all about that place but I couldn't... the hum vibrated between my ears, it tickled a part of my brain that almost made me drool... and I needed to see it. Just once, just for a little more than a second this time. 

It was fifteen minutes to the edge of the county line, but it had felt like fifteen seconds. 

3:13am glowed from the radio in the dash. 

Neon lights splashed across the asphalt parking lot of the truck stop. Barely a soul in sight except for an old Peterbilt with a trailer parked near the dumpster pad and a beat up Hyundai near the front entrance. 

I wiped the moisture from my palms on my jeans as I entered through the vestibule. 

Sweat dripped from my brow as I asked for the shower key. The cashier eyed me suspiciously, probably wondering if I was an addict, and I couldn't blame him, I certainly felt like one. 

He conceded after the brief hesitation and tossed me a key that was tied to a plastic ruler. 

I nodded and tried not to run in my excitement back to the showers. 

The walls were lined floor to ceiling in aqua blue porcelain and smelled faintly like bleach.   
  
The key clacked against the ruler as it trembled in my hand.   
  
*Stall 1... 2... 3... 4... 5...*   
  
For being 6'5'' and having a large gait, I was taking steps smaller than a child.   
  
*Stall 6...7...8...9...10...*   
  
Why am I here? Why do I need to see?   
  
*Stall 11...12...*  
  
What if I don't make it back this time?  
  
**Stall 13.** 

The hum in my head turned from a pleasurable itch, to a nauseating force. My mouth filled with saliva and I felt as if I could vomit.   
  
But it was too late to turn back now.   
  
I pulled back the plastic curtain almost expecting to be immediately engulfed by a brilliant light...   
  
But it was more blue tile, a shower head, two nozzles and a drain. 

*Shit...* 

I tried to retrace my actions from last week. 

I twisted the hot water nozzle full rotation to the right, cold water a quarter rotation left. 

The water pelted against my Carhartt, soaking my clothes, but I didn't care.   
  
I waited for a moment, but nothing... what else did I do? 

Foolishness and desperation crept up my spine. 

Had it all been in my mind? Maybe I'd had a stroke or somethin' and didn't realize... 

Just as I was wondering how I'd explain my wet clothes to the attendant and was about to turn off the water, a great vibration traveled from the soles of my feet to the top of my head. 

I yelped in pain. 

It was so sudden and violent that I'd damn near bit my tongue in half it felt like. 

But I barely noticed that coppery taste this time as the tiled wall fractured and split before opening inward. 

"*Oh my God..."*
