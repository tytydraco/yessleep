Let me tell you about jonathan schuler, a man born in a different timeline, where germany became the dominant power in ww1, and turned the entire world into one big country, the GWA(German world alliance) 

jonathan schuler was born in the year 2127 in germany, his mother dying when he was 5, and his father being an alcoholic and beating him frequently,during school, it was always clear, that he was alot more intelligent than his peers, but also more socially awkward, he was kind of an outcast because of it. 

In the year 2139, a newly founded insurgent group called the NRA(New Rebel alliance) declared war on the GWA, stating that the GWAs regime was oppressing the people and that they need to be stopped. Jonathan saw through this though, he saw this for him obvious attempt to gain more power, and when he was 17, he joined the ranks of the GWA heer, fighting against insurgents in the south pacific. 

He was well liked by his comrades, as his abnormally fast mind, and physical fitness made him a formiddable fighter.

 This was the first time in his life, where he felt truly respected, but here plays in another factor for jonathan, he always had fantasies of violence, but his father never cared to go to a psychiatrist with him, and this "psychosis" made him make the connection
Killing = praise but killing = pain, so pain = praise

On his third battle, an enemy soldier surrenders to him, and instead of taking him as a POW, or killing him, he takes him to a hidden place in the forest, tortures him mentally and physically, then proceeds to gut him for every piece of meat that jonathan sees as edible. 

Then he cooks him up and feeds him to his comrades, telling them its pulled pork, they liked him even more, as they thought he genuinely feeded them pork, and fills their empty stomaches, he feels pride as he now knows how to statisfy his brethren in arms, and his psychosis. 

He keeps repeating this, for 3 months, he keeps taking people to his hideout, and gutting them for their meat. Hes able to do this to 27 people, burying their remains(usually bones, uniforms, plate carriers, and Fotos they had on them)

One day, a bunch of his comrades follow him, curious where he got all this "pork", but what they find disturbs them completely, they see jonathan cooking some sort of meat stew, and has 3 people bound to chairs, they are completely mutilated everywhere.

 They take jonathan, and execute him publicly, then they see his "graves" for all of his victims, but digging into them, there were just bones and NRA  uniforms in each of them. 

At his execution, jonathan laughs, he clearly has no remorse. He gets shot, and thats his end.

Please tell me your thoughts about this character, and if you would like to hear some dialogue between him and his victims. 
He will be featured as a side character in a movie im planning to make, called "revolution", but i personally think hes one of the better villains i ever wrote.
Please also feel free to ask questions

(This is just a small roundup of his character, but let me know if you are interested in reading more of him)
