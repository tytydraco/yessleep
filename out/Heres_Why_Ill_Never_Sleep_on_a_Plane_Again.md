This all happened a year ago when I ran into this guy while waiting for my plane at the airport lounge. No one would believe me even if I told them why I would never sleep on the plane. I intended to keep this a secret to keep my job. But I need an outlet, or I will be crazy... so here it goes...

"Aerophobia, the fear of flying, is an instinct encoded in an almond-shaped cluster of neurons in our human being's lizard part of the brain. It screams the consequences that may occur when we take our bodies off the ground, all from our ancestors' memories that are deeply engraved in our blood and bones."

The above lengthy statement summarized the lecture the stranger I met in the airline lounge had been giving me.

I sighed, loud and intentional, while swirling my half-glass of merlot and checking the airline app on my phone. My plane was still only halfway en route from a major Midwestern city to my terminal in a Southern coastal city. Thanks to the ripple effects of previous flight cancellations since this morning, my departure time had been delayed for more than three hours. I thought I could pass the time in the lounge easily, but now I have to listen to this guy's unsolicited, endless podcast-style speech, all because I was too polite to say no when he asked if the bar stool next to me was empty.

Frustrated, I finished the rest of the wine in one big gulp, and the stranger beside me said, "So, do you agree?"

Shit, I almost forgot he was still talking. "Uh, sorry. I wasn't paying attention." Out of courtesy (Damn the manner my parents taught me!), I followed up, "What were you saying?"

"Our feet have their purpose - to support us to walk on the solid ground. They also link our body and soul with nature. When we fly, it's like we are cutting our connections with our core in the earth. It's unnatural for the human body to be in the air for that long. Doesn't that scare you?"

I laid my phone on the table and looked at the stranger closely for the first time. This man was in his forties or fifties, Caucasian, and thin-built, but with a big beer belly sticking out under his chin. His long pepper hair was tied back to cover the balding spots on top of his head, and his face was tanned and flakey. He was sporting a set of brown checked suits with the same wrinkle level as his face.

I assumed he was a salesman trying to strike up conversations and build networks with potential clients in the airport lounge. After all, this is a great place to meet many potential customers if you have the thick skin to bother people who are exhausted and busy minding their business. I am also a sales representative for a company that sells AI solutions as a service. I fly out of my city every week to different locations, which gets mentally and physically draining. That was why I lowered my guard and gave this guy some attention, not to discourage his hustle. But this conversation was taking a weird turn. I surely didn't want to entertain him anymore.

"I never thought about it this way, " I said, pulling my laptop from my purse. "Alright, nice talk. I've got to get some work done before boarding." This was my best firm yet polite hint that I was done talking to him.

"Busy, busy, busy, I understand. I used to be on the road a lot for the M&A work, too. until I found my enlightenment." The man smiled but didn't seem able to take my hint.

I hummed once as the answer. My eyes were still glued to the laptop and my fifty unread emails. I couldn't stop wondering why this man was at the airport if he hated flying that much.

The stranger sipped his beer, looked at travelers passing us, and said, "Ok missy, I appreciate you listening to my rant. How about I get you another glass of red and get out of your hair?"

Before I could protest, he's already turned and asked the bartender, "Can you get her another glass of what she was having?" He pointed at my glass and pulled a dollar bill from his beat-up wallet. "Here's the tip."

I know that bartender's probably laughing inside. In this economy? What could a dollar get you?

The cold and blood-red liquid was quickly presented next to my laptop. I whispered thanks as the man finally left his seat as promised. I let out another long sigh and stayed focused on my screen to beautify the PowerPoint I had prepared for my pitch. Some time passed, and my phone vibrated. The airline sent a text message informing me that my flight had finally arrived, but the boarding gate was pushed further away from where I was. I growled, packed my things, and slipped off the stool.

"Ma'am? You forget your thing." The bartender stopped me.

I turned around. The young man was holding a palm-sized white linen bag in the air.

"No, that's not mine."

He frowned. "The gentleman who left said to make sure you take it with you."

"What? That's weird." This strange offering took me aback. "Can you just throw it away?"

"Um, I'm not sure if I could do that." He put the bag down on the marbled counter. "This looks like some organic matter in it." He poked the bag, and I could hear the rustling sound coming out. "If you don't mind..." He lowered his voice, "This is my first week at work. I'm not familiar with the rules. I'm not sure if disposal of this thing is allowed or not… could you just…." He looked at me with begging eyes, "Take it and throw it away somewhere along the way to your gate?"

Out of politeness and sympathy for this green bartender, I reluctantly nodded, grabbed the bag, tossed it in my purse, and exited the lounge.

Boarding was fast enough. Thanks to two glasses of red wine I downed in the lounge, as soon as I sat in my comfortable business-class seat, I passed out like there was no tomorrow.

Suddenly, the violent shaking woke me up. I opened my eyes and just caught the elderly passenger beside me drop the hot coffee on his lap.

"Damn it's hot!" He cursed.

Before I could offer him a tissue, the seat under me suddenly dropped abruptly and lifted up, and with a "ding," the buckle-up sign was turned on.

The captain announced:" Flight attendants, keep your seatbelts fastened."

It's not a good sign when flight attendants must stop working and buckle up like the rest of us. I felt a pang of anxiety creeping up in my chest, but I brushed it off. Turbulence happens, I told myself; It's perfectly fine. We are like flying through jello—you can shake the gelatin however you want, but the plane won't drop—things are under professional control.

That's when I felt the plane start tilting downward. I opened the window blinds, witnessing the clouds rush past me at full speed. Soon, we were no longer passing clouds, and the green patches and gray lanes appeared outside the window. Panicky cries filled the plane.

"Holy shit, are we falling back to the earth?" I said.

The old man beside me was still trying to dab his wet pants with his two square paper napkins, regardless of the fact that he was facing downward at a jarring degree like the rest of us. He turned to me, "What? What are you saying? Isn't this normal?"

Before I could reply, a silver coffee kettle flew out of the kitchen. With a loud, muffled "pang," it hit the man's head, knocking him unconscious, and his blood splashed all over my white, pressed shirt.

Passengers screamed behind me while more objects whooshed out of the front cabinet—the feeling of losing gravity sent waves of nausea from my stomach to my throat. I held my best not to vomit or start wailing like my fellow neighbors. I started chanting all the prayers that I could conjure up, hoping this was just a dream.

The plane's nose tilted further, and we were sat vertically like in a roller coaster. One teenage boy screamed and slipped down the hallway and past me. I tried to grab him, but the force was too strong, and he rolled down too fast for me to react. I could only guess he happened not to have his buckle fastened tight enough. Temporarily safe in my seat, I was not in the most comfortable situation. My back was facing the direction of the sky at a 90-degree angle, my blood was floating all over my body but my head, and the tight belt on my belly was inching into my ribs, suffocating me, threatening to squeeze the air and wine from my body.

Crying, cursing, and praying echoed through the cabinet. Lights started flickering, and a pungent smell of coffee and piss filled the air. I still could not believe what I was experiencing. We were plunging directly back to the earth. My worst nightmare had come true, and I did not know it would be this soon, this real.

Another violent shake pushed me off the seatbelt, and my face hit the chair back in front of me hard. "Ah!" I whimpered, but I did not feel the pain as expected.

"Ma'am, ma'am, are you alright?"

I opened my eyes and saw the old man, who was supposed to be oozing blood unconsciously in his chair, looking at me with his blue, cloudy eyes filled with concern.

"I'm sorry?" I sat up straight. Looked around. The plane was still flying - thank God - horizontally. No cries nor screams could be heard anymore. My heart pounded so fast that it could jump out of my throat. I rubbed my eyes; was that just a nightmare? No, it cannot be. The whole scenario was too realistic to be a dream.

"I didn't mean to bother you, but you were crying," my neighbor passenger said.

After he said that, I sensed a trace of warm liquid on my face. I quickly wiped my tears off with the back of my hand, blushing out of embarrassment. "No, yeah, sir, thank you for waking me up."

He still looked at me with concerned eyes. "You know, life is short. Don't let anything - work, school, or family - stress you out. Once you get to my age, you'll hardly remember what or why you were worrying about those things. They will work out eventually; God has his plan for you. All you have to do is believe."

He must be thinking I'm another burned-out road warrior. I gave him a light smile and said, "Thank you, I will surely remember that."

After that episode, I could not go back to sleep anymore, so I stayed awake and reviewed my presentation for the tenth time. The rest of the flight was uneventful. After we landed, I turned off the airplane mode. I texted my boss that I'd landed and would send him the presentation soon after I got a better connection.

A news banner popped up on my phone screen as I was texting my message. The title reads: "Breaking News: Horrific Plane Crash During Descending." I opened the new window. The tragedy had happened only 2 hours ago, around the same time as I was having that bad dream in the middle of the air. This plane was taking off as usual, without interference from the weather or other planes. Still, the plane suddenly took a nose dive and crashed into the farmland nearby. Rescuing is ongoing, and no death or injury numbers have been officialized. But anyone could guess the results would be pretty bleak, given the wreckage footage the news is showing.

Why did this event seem similar to my nightmare a thousand miles away? As more emails came into my phone, I couldn't give the incident a second thought, so I went about my day.

\###

I killed it at the sales pitch, and the 3-day meetings flew by like a breeze.

Thursday afternoon was our time to fly home. My boss booked a similar 7 pm departure flight to his home city, so we shared the ride to the airport. In the car, we compared our notes on our wrapped-up meeting and agreed that we had a high chance of winning the contract.

On the bus shuttle to the airport, my boss checked his phone and said, "You know that crazy plane crash that happened on Monday?"

I answered him in my most nonchalant tone: "Yeah, I only read the title. Did they find any survivors?"

"No, it's so fucking sad. All of them, passengers and crew staff, were believed to be dead from the impact. Did you see the video?"

"I don't like to watch that stuff; they kept me awake at night," I said. "Did they ever find out how the plane could fly straight to the ground?"

"Nah, they've just uncovered the black box and sent it to the capital, no details yet. Shit's crazy. My wife literally called me and asked me to cancel my flight and drive home after she read the news. I was like, it takes 7 hours without traffic to drive from the Midwest to the East Coast, and then what, does she want me to drive to all the places forever?"

"Right? Only if we could." I laughed.

"It's much safer to fly than drive anyway. I told her this kind of thing doesn't happen daily, but you know, wife gotta be wife."

"Let's just hope this doesn't happen again soon. Especially not for our flights."

"It won't. You've got nothing to worry about," my boss said as the shuttle bus stopped. "Well, here's my gate. "He pulled up his carry-on. "Let's regroup for our check-in meeting tomorrow."

I nodded. "You have a safe flight!"

He saluted back to me and hopped off the bus.

My flight home wasn't delayed, so I considered it a huge win. I didn't want to look at the work stuff for one more second on the flight, so I started reading the book I bought from the airport store's best-seller shelf. I was only about ten pages in, and my eyes started blurring. I put the book down on my chest and dozed off.

I was waking up from my own involuntary coughing. Immediately, I felt hot - flaming hot - all over my body. For a second, I was confused about why I couldn't see anything. Once my eyes adjusted to the light, I realized the flight cabinet was engulfed by thick smoke and fire. The open blaze was coming from the plane's rear end while passengers ran towards the exit door. Two men were already pulling the emergency exit door, but either door's red, bulky handle wouldn't barge, and the captain's inflight comm was fried. He spoke like rapid-fire, but his voice was distorted and drowned out by muffled statistics and white noises.

One more man stepped into the right end of the door and grabbed the door handle's tail, and one woman stepped on the door's ledge. With a few more pushes and pulls, a bright light cast into the smoke-filled space, and the door finally unclutched. The fresh air blew in, making the fire's tongue grow.

"We have to move now! Come with me!" A flight attendant crouched next to me. Her curly black hair was spread all over her face. I looked at her hazel eyes glowing from the fire but couldn't recall seeing her when I boarded. She unbuckled my belt and lifted me, placed my belly on her shoulder, and walked towards the door. I was half amazed by her strength and half confused about how this was remotely possible. I looked down at my feet and gasped - when did I become so short that a petite lady could carry me like nothing?

The flight attendant halted as she moved down the hallway. A massive crowd was glued to the spot like a mountain blocking us from advancing further, and their movement to the exit was painfully slow. Every second was like a century passing in the inferno. Swears filled the air, mingling with desperate cries and shoves. Suddenly, "BLAM!" A thunderous explosion shattered the air, ripping me away from the flight attendant's grasp. The force slammed me onto the floor. "No!" I heard the flight attendant cry out. Instantly, another deafening "BANG!" filled the space, accompanied by the chaotic symphony of shattered glass and crackling crimson flames swirling around me. Then, darkness eroded my vision, erasing everything left to see.

"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Southern coastal city's International Airport. Local time is 11:25 pm…"

"What?" I said, realizing my throat was burning.

"Welp, that must be a hell of a book. Put you to sleep through the whole way." The man who sat next to me said.

I looked down at the book. It was that boring book about not giving a fuck about everything, "For sure, it gets repetitive fast after the shocking openings."

"This is home for ya?" He stood up and helped me with my overhead carry-on.

"Yeah, you?"

"No, I was supposed to head to a city in Florida for my brother's bachelor party, but it looks like the plane coming in caught on fire after it landed." He said, "I may end up getting a voucher to stay in this place for a night. Do you have any late-night bite recommendations? I'm tired of going to those tourist trap places…"

My ears rang, my throat was dry like sandpaper, and I could no longer hear the men. A flight caught on fire, same as my dream again? Could this be another freaky coincidence? It's not like my dream manifested the whole thing, or I suddenly became a seer who can predict omens, right?

Realized the guy was still staring at me expectantly. I said, "Sorry, I don't actually go out in town these days, so I'm coming up blank. A lot of good restaurants are probably closed by now. You can always hit up the famous party street for some late-night scenes." Seeing his disappointed face, I added, "I'm sure you can still get decent local sandwiches at one of those bars that open up late."

"I appreciate it. Well, I'll have to find someone to help me sort out my flight schedule first and then get the food.

"If you don't mind," I said, "Can you tell me your supposed incoming flight number?"

"Sure, let me see." He pulled up the airline app on his phone. "It was ABC### (I'm hiding the numbers for obvious reasons). So, are you heading home directly, or want to get a bite together?"

"No thanks. I'm absolutely beat. I hope you have a good time in this city, though."

On my Uber home, I couldn't help but delve into the reports surrounding ABC###. The flight caught on fire shortly after taking off. The fire erupted from the plane's rear end, spreading too fast for flight attendants to put it off. The pilot made an emergency landing, but the emergency exit doors malfunctioned for no definite reason reported yet, which compounded the damage, and half of the flight passengers were killed from burning and smoke inhalation.

Among the passengers who lost their lives, the youngest victim was a 6-year-old girl. One of the brave flight attendants tried to carry the young girl toward the exit as her mom had succumbed to a lack of oxygen. However, during the process, one of the engines exploded, and the girl was hurled down the hallway and consumed by the blaze. The flight attendant who recounted the event suffered minor external injuries and was rushed to the nearest hospital along with other survivors for overnight observation. The news videos showed her profile picture - a young woman in her twenties with long, curly black hair and hazel eyes.

"As I was saying, clients liked what they saw and wanted our team to fly in the following Monday to meet their CIO directly," my boss said.

I frowned.

"Oh, someone's not happy about flying again?" My colleague said.

I cursed myself for forgetting the camera was on. "No, it's just those flight incidents are getting really disturbing. "

"Try to get some sleep this weekend," my boss said. "But if you want to forgo the rest time for the party, you can always sleep on the flight."

Sure, like I would ever dare to sleep during the flight again.

After the call, I started unpacking my luggage. While taking out my notebook from the backpack, a small bag slipped out. The damn bag of dirt that weird man left for me had been living in my bag for this whole time; I completely forgot to throw it away.

I picked up the bag and untied the rope around its opening. The bag only has specks of dirt inside. I poked the dirt with my index finger, and a warm pulse shot into my brain. "What the hell?" I dropped the bag on the ground. It didn't move a bit. The sensation was familiar, cozy, and welcoming, like returning to a safe space, Nana's country home, or a long-lost ancient motherland unveiled itself once more.

Could this be the culprit that sent me all those weird visions in my dream? What did that strange guy say he worked at again? I quickly jumped on LinkedIn and searched for a Merger and Acquisition law firm based in the Southern city; more than 12 million results came back on Google. I pulled my hair, knowing I had no slight clue about what that man's name was or if he was even still employed.

I went to the fridge and grabbed one can of hard seltzer. Taking in the surprisingly refreshing sip, I checked the label. It's a citrus flavor, and the label says, "Enjoy the natural sweetness without added calories." I returned to my laptop and typed in the keywords "M&A lawyer, Nature, Aerophobia, Southern city," and a LinkedIn page came up as the first search.

"R. N., a former Mergers and Acquisitions lawyer with 30 years of experience in the industry, has recently exited the firm due to aerophobia. Embracing a new calling, R. has transitioned into serving as a spiritual leader, helping communities return to nature and find inner harmony." His LinkedIn profile said.

I clicked the connect button next to his broad grin picture and waited about ten minutes. Still, no reply to the invitation was accepted. He probably couldn't answer me anyway, so I closed the laptop.

I was waiting in my terminal to board the plane to the Midwestern city again on Monday morning. My boss and colleague were chatting about Saturday's football game, and I checked the news about the flight incidents. Nothing traumatic happened during the weekend.

After boarding the plane, I was ready to pass out on the flight again when my phone vibrated, showing a new notification that R. had accepted my invitation. I checked the window. The flight was waiting to get into the take-off lane. I still had time, so I quickly messaged him, "Hey R., do you remember me?"

"Yes." He replied.

Oh, suddenly, he doesn't want to be talkative anymore. I replied, "I wanted to ask you about the bag you left for me."

After one second, I followed," Never mind. This is crazy. It's probably nothing."

"The bag that ties you back to the ground? Yes, that's my gift for you." R. typed back, "I hope you carry it with you whenever you fly."

"What do you mean? What would happen if I didn't take it with me?"

"Haven't you seen those punishments for running away from Mother Nature with your own eyes? Oh, I bet you did. That's why you come to me for an answer. Isn't it?" I can see his smirk through the message asking for a punch.

Taking a deep breath, I quickly typed, "Guy, spell it out. I have about 5 minutes to take off. I had some bothersome dreams that happened to be the same as the real flight incidents. Are you saying those are connected? What am I being punished for?"

"A real professional can connect the dots," he answered. "I've told you, it's not natural for us to fly this high. Mother Earth's wrath has found you. But she is merciful. If you take the soil with you, you are keeping your connection. She'd just recast the condemned consequence for others."

"Are you serious? So this jerk mother would kill other people to show me how bad it is for me to take the flights to do my work and earn a living? I didn't do anything to you. Why did you have to curse me with this voodoo shit?"

"You are still not awake. This is a blessing, not a curse!" And beyond all things, he added a smiley face emoji at the end of the message.

My blood boiled. I couldn't tell if this guy's been dead serious or if he was at the last stage of a delusional rampage. The flight attendant came by and reminded me we were about to take off - that meant I needed to turn my phone to airplane mode.

I answered her, "Of course," but lowered my head to the phone and typed, "R., what will happen if I don't have that bag of dirt with me?" I did not even bother opening the overhead cabinet and pulling my luggage out to search for the dirt, as I knew for sure I had not packed that bag with me for this flight. Waste management is probably already picking it up from my trash can and carrying it to the landfill. Dust to dust, ashes to ashes.

R. didn't reply immediately this time. I anxiously stared at the phone as the flight safety video played.

When the flight lifted off the air, my heart sank to the bottom of my stomach.

Three dots appeared on the message, showing he was typing.

"Do not ever sleep on the plane." The message came through: "Maybe that will work."

"Maybe? What do you mean, maybe?!" I typed back, but my phone lost the signal, and the message I sent stuck in the forever circle symbol.

I glanced at the passengers, who listened to the music, closed their eyes, tried to get some rest, or chatted with their companions. They were going through the routine like any other day on the plane.

R. never replied me again - the asshole blocked me after our last conversation.

This is why I never sleep on my flight anymore, no matter how long the trip is—a four-hour domestic flight, a ten-hour trip to Europe, or thirty-two hours of international flights to South Asia —and I am so, so tired…
