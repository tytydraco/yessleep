I got the first message last Monday. Just a casual ding from an unknown number.

“You forgot me, didn’t you?  Roxanne 💋”

I didn’t know a Roxanne. No old flame, no ex, not even a friend by that name. Probably spam, I figured. Deleted it and moved on.

The next day, I got another one.

“You looked cute in that hoodie, blue always was my favorite on you.”

That gave me pause. I’d worn a blue hoodie that morning, was this some AI-generated scam? A lucky guess?

I replied:
“Who is this?”

No answer. I blocked the number.

but the messages didn’t stop.

“You always blink twice when you lie. Did you know that?”
“I saw you at the gas station. You looked sad.”
“You don’t remember, but we were in love.”

I stopped sleeping well. I was constantly looking over my shoulder. At red lights. In elevators. At the front door.

I asked my friends. Nobody knew a Roxanne. One of them joked, “Maybe she’s your stalker ex from a past life.”

Not funny.

I came home Wednesday night and found a package on my bed. No postage, no name.

Inside: a framed Polaroid of me sleeping.

In my own bed.

Taken from inside my room.

Taped to the back was a note written in looping cursive:
“You looked so peaceful. Still mine. – R.”

I called the police.

They did a sweep. Nothing.

They checked the photo for prints. Nothing.

I changed the locks. Bought cameras. Installed a deadbolt and slept with a knife under my pillow.

Didn’t matter.

Saturday night, my power went out.

And then I heard her voice.

Soft. From the hallway.
“You’re not running anymore. That’s good. I hate when you run.”

I locked my bedroom door and backed away. My phone lit up in my pocket.

“Let me in, baby. You owe me at least a conversation.”

There was a tap, tap, tap on the door. Not pounding. Just… patient.

I screamed. Called 911.

When the cops arrived five minutes later, she was gone. No sign of forced entry. No prints. No Roxanne.

I showed them the texts.

They weren’t there.

Gone. Every last one.

They suggested I talk to someone. Maybe get help.

Help?

How do you get help for something that leaves behind Polaroids and perfume on your pillow?

Today’s Monday again.

Exactly one week since the first message.

I moved in with my sister. She doesn’t believe me either, but at least I’m not alone.

This morning, she went to the store.

I made coffee.

My phone buzzed.

One new message.

“You can hide in someone else’s house, but it’s still your heart. And I’m in there.”

Attached was another photo.

Me.

Taken seconds ago.

Standing in the kitchen.

Holding a cup of coffee.

I dropped the mug. It shattered.

I ran to every window. Nothing. No one.

I stared at the phone in my shaking hand, afraid to look at it again.

Another buzz.

“Let’s talk. This time, I’ll make sure you remember me.”

I don’t know who she is. I don’t know what I did. Maybe she’s a ghost. Maybe she’s just broken.

Or maybe… maybe I did know her once.

Maybe I did something terrible.

Maybe forgetting her was the worst mistake I could’ve made.

I don't know what she wants.

But tonight, the power just went out again.

There’s movement in the hallway.

The floorboards creak.

And I hear her whisper, right outside the door

“I missed you.”
