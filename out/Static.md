Losing a finger bought me a week of silence.

And I’d trade another in a heartbeat for just one more peaceful day.

I work at North Point Hardware, a squat gray box just outside Portland. Towering metal shelves. Forklifts older than most of the guys who drive them. The place reeks of mildew and lemon cleaner, a sickly-sweet rot you could scrub for days and still wear home. 

Nothing ever changes here, at least not in the nine years since I started. Still the same flickering fluorescents. The same heavy silence before the morning shift.

I like that part best. The silence. No one talking. Just me and the machines and the fog curling at the base of the roll-up doors.

But quiet always comes with a price.

I’m not good with people. Or words. Or anything that requires a smile and a handshake. But I know this place. I know what tools go where. What belongs.

And I know when something doesn’t.

The noise started about a year ago. A hum at first, low and strange like a busted fan blade spinning behind the walls. Mechanical, but not quite. I asked my manager about it but he just shrugged. Said if I wanted peace, the library was hiring.

No thanks. Too many words.

At first I could ignore it. Just another annoying buzz in a warehouse full of them. 

But then it followed me home.

I shut off everything. Even flipped the main breaker. Nothing. Still there. Like a tuning fork pressed against the inside of my skull. I drank half a bottle of bourbon and slept in the bathtub. Didn't help. The next morning I tore my trailer apart. Smashed anything that could click or whir. But the sound continued, taunting me.

So eventually, I stopped fighting it.

That’s when work got weird. I started losing time. I'd black out restocking shelves and come to with bruises I didn’t remember earning. The other guys said I screamed at a customer, full volume, right in his face. I don’t remember that either.

The noise got louder in the quiet. Worse in the dark. Strongest when I was alone. But what really set it off was the new stuff.

Fresh deliveries of brand-new tools were like fire behind my teeth. I opened a box of paint brushes once and nearly passed out from the pressure. The heat. The static.

This became my new normal. Until I dropped a pallet jack on my hand.

Left pinky. Crushed it between the steel wheel and the floor. The sound was... thick. Like biting through a soggy celery stalk. I screamed. Loud enough to scare myself.

And then.

Nothing.

No hum. No hiss. No teeth-grinding pressure behind my brain. Just my own breath and the steady drip of blood against concrete.

It only lasted an hour, but it was the best hour I’d had in months.

A few weeks later the noise came back, angrier, building till I couldn’t even see. In a blur I slammed my hand against a shelf so hard it split. Didn’t even think, just needed the sound gone.

And for the rest of that day, it was.

That’s when it clicked. Pain is the price of silence.

So I started experimenting. Doors. Filing cabinets. Anything that hurt just enough to buy me peace. I wrapped my hand in gauze and told the guys I was clumsy. They said they knew. 

Dicks.

After another month of work mishaps and bandaged excuses, things took a turn. I was closing alone. Found myself in aisle twelve. Bolt cutters. Big ones. Yellow handles.

I slipped my ring finger between the blades, no hesitation. My hand moved like it had already decided. It sat there, waiting, the metal pressing into my skin.

That’s when I saw it.

At the far end of the aisle, a shadow. Not a person, not a thing. Just an absence. It didn’t move so much as flicker, like heat rippling off asphalt, dark and pulsing. It leaned forward and my ears popped from the changing pressure.

I blinked, and it was gone. 

And so was my finger.

The world went white. It was like chewing tinfoil with a mouth full of fillings, electric and wrong in every direction. The snap echoed inside me, settling somewhere deep. Somewhere final.

But after?

Silence.

Thick, bottomless, goddamn beautiful silence. Paid for in full.

Lasted almost an entire week.

Now I’ve got four fingers on my left hand and I don’t even miss the fifth. Not really. Sometimes it tingles, phantom-like. But mostly? I'm fine.

Well, sort of fine. The sound started again.

At first just a murmur. Then a tap. Then a clawing, like frantic fingernails digging at the inside of my skull. My fingers would twitch whenever I passed the new circular saws. I kept finding myself standing before the belt sanders, waiting for nothing.

And just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore…

Dana walked in.

New hire. Mid-twenties, maybe. Hair pulled back with an elastic band, dark circles under her eyes that have probably been there since birth. Quiet. Floaty. Like she was a second out of sync with the rest of the world.

She wore a glove on her right hand. A thick, padded thing. She didn’t mention it and no one ever asked. Her left hand though?

Absolutely flawless. Nails filed. Deep burgundy polish. Unscarred.

I couldn't stop staring.

She waved at me that first day, just the left. That one perfect ungloved hand. And I swear to God, the vibration in my skull spiked.

I smiled back. Didn't blink. Couldn’t. 

And her hand. 

Her hand.

It moved like it had never known pain. She handed me a clipboard and our fingers brushed.

The noise exploded. A sonic boom inside my skull. I almost threw up. My knees buckled. My tongue went metallic and thick. She just grinned.

“Easy there. The static’s always worse in the mornings.”

I froze. Think I might have laughed.

That night I sat in the dark studying my hand. Four fingers. The fifth one’s absence throbbed like a missing tooth. My skin crawled like it was waiting for something to tunnel out from underneath. 

Couldn’t sleep. The pressure was back, worse than ever. I’d already lost a finger, but it still felt like I hadn’t paid enough. Like I still owed it something.

I thought about Dana. Her smile. Her voice.

Her perfect hand.

Four fingers is quieter, sure. But is it enough?

Maybe there’s a recurring cost for silence.

The next morning I followed her into the break room, a box cutter in my pocket and an ugly thought chewing through my mind. I watched from the doorway, heart thudding. Her phone slipped free and fell to the floor.

Here we go.

She bent to grab it. My hand was already in my pocket, closing around the box cutter. Tight. I lunged forward.

And I saw it.

Her ungloved right hand.

Two fingers gone. The rest bent and shiny with scar tissue. Twisted. Not recent.

She held it out for me to see, her eyes locked onto mine.

"You hear it too," she said, a relief in those words.

It wasn’t a question.

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.

"The static," she whispered. “It eats pain like candy. How bad do you miss the silence?”

Then she walked out like nothing had happened, her mangled hand hidden once more.

I just stood there, paralyzed and buzzing.

Of course. 

Of course I wasn’t the only one.

My thumb twitched and the static void filled the doorway, hovering where Dana had just been.

I still had a debt to pay.

And I was running low on fingers.
