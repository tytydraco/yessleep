In hindsight, I should have known *something* was wrong with The Caeles Academy of Acting. 

Maybe the fact that it doesn't exist to the outside world. 

This place prided itself on *famous* alumni it didn't actually name, and a once in a lifetime opportunity to work with the best in the business. 

It's what I wanted. 

More than anything.

After enduring four years of high school with barely a semblance of a drama club (we met every month, and our teacher was an alcoholic), and countless failed auditions, I was ready to take my acting career seriously. I had one year. 

According to my parents, I had *one* year to make a living from my passion. 

If it didn't work out, I would be on the first plane back to Connecticut. 

It's not like they didn't trust me. I think they were just scared I wouldn't be able to financially support myself. So, I got a job right out of high school and slipped a year. Drama schools are expensive, and college’s are cut-throat on who they take on. I found Caeles Academy by accident–or, I guess it found me? 

After researching cheap drama classes, auditions, academy’s, literally anything to progress my career, an ad popped up. 

Not exactly flashy. 

Just a date, a time, and a promise that they only take the best. I ignored it, but throughout the week, I started getting more ads. Just the words, “IMPRESS US - - JOIN CAELES ACADEMY NOW.”

Followed by, **“BE WITH THE BEST, AND BE THE BEST. JOIN THE S CLASS NOW.”**

When I googled the academy, nothing came up. 

I gave up, clicking on the ad, which sent me straight to an application form. 

I filled in my details as more of a joke. But I wasn't expecting to get an email back. Again, it was a time, a date, and that exact same tagline: “Impress us.”

However, Caeles Academy was *different* from what I imagined. 

I was expecting a university building, or at least *some* modern structure. 

Judging from their marketing and ads, I figured they could at least afford decent premises. Though I was mistaken. When I stepped out of the Uber, I found myself staring at what looked like an abandoned office tower, a red-brick monolith in the middle of nowhere. 

Which was crazy, because I *swore* a girl wearing a bikini had strode through the doors, with nothing but her phone, and a coffee tucked under her elbow. 

According to the text sent from the academy, the auditioning rooms were on the third floor. 

Tipping my head back, the checkerboard of broken windows didn't exactly instil confidence. 

Neither did the clunky set of automatic doors that took a while to open. 

It was a summer's day, and the heat was already baking through my dress, sweat sticky on the back of my neck.  

I wanted to make a good impression, but the heels were a little over the top.

Though I had also seen a girl casually walk in wearing a two piece bikini. 

“Well?” 

Freddie’s voice made me jump. I forgot I was on the phone to him. I was excited the whole car-ride, already high on five coffees, and now I was silent. 

If I perceived the ‘academy’ from an objective standpoint, it definitely looked like the perfect place to be brutally murdered. But my own personal opinion was it was.. *okay.*

“What's it like?”

I pretended not to see a rat scuttling under an old candy wrapper. 

“It's… fine.”

“Just *fine*?”

I could hear the smirk in my friend’s tone. He couldn't wait to tell me it was a scam, and had been reminding me all week I was essentially willingly selling myself to the black market. I was stubborn, so, *fine* sounded better than my initial first impression. 

Which was to turn around, walk away, and completely block the place from my memory. 

Unfortunately, at that moment, I valued my pride over my awareness. 

“It's… okay.” I said, trying to find positives. I was staring at a looming grey building with shattered windows and a resident rat living near the door. I had a hard time figuring out how the girl from earlier had just casually strode inside, barefoot too. I glanced down at the ground, immediately regretting it. 

Like there weren't bits of chewing gum and grime stuck to the concrete.

“Huh.” Freddie said, his tone creeping into teasing territory. “You're really selling it.”

“It just looks like a building,” I muttered, my gaze glued to the rat, who looked a little too comfortable. 

Maybe it was a pet.

I was getting progressively more infuriated the more I stared down this place. Judging from the decades old writing ingrained into the door, it used to be a dentist surgery. “What do you want me to say?” I wasn't even trying to hide the scorn from my voice. “It's a building that looks like an academy.”

“Can you send a picture?” Freddie asked, “Ooh, wait, I'll face-time you.”

“That's, uh, that’s not really necessary–”

I was cut off, suddenly, when a guy threw himself through the automatic doors, palms first. He took two stumbled steps forwards, one back, and lifted his head, half lidded eyes finding the sky, before dropping to his knees and heaving up pinkish liquid. 

I could see him trying to hold it in, slamming his hands over his mouth, only for it to splurge through his fingers, showering the ground in greyish pink froth. 

Like he'd downed a bottle of Pepto Bismol. 

Inching towards him, I realized it *was* Pepto Bismol. 

The stink made my own stomach churn.

“Missy?”

I found my voice. “Uh, can I call you back later?”

Before my friend could answer, I ended the call, slipping my phone in my pocket.

The guy was still heaving, coughing up globules of *pink*. 

“Are you okay?”

The sound of my heels click-clacking on concrete made me cringe. The guy noticed, flinching away. Closer, and I could see his scraggly blonde hair.

He was handsome. 

Without the bile spewing down his chin. 

Early twenties, wearing a fitted white shirt now covered in streaks of bright pink. Part of me wanted to make a half-hearted joke, but getting even closer, so close I could smell his pepto-breath, I noticed he was trembling, his hands clenched into fists. 

When I attempted to awkwardly pat him on the shoulder, he twisted around, so fast my morning coffee slithered its way back up my throat. 

His eyes were wide, almost feral, studying me like a wild animal. 

I noticed the whites of his pupils were red, like he'd burst a blood vessel.

*Theatre kids were intense, though I had never met THIS kind of intense.*

“Are you… going in there?” The guy’s voice was a child-like whimper I wasn't expecting. 

It looked like he was slowly regaining clarity, staring down at his filthy shirt, his hands stained bright pink. 

I nodded, uncertainly, offering him my water. “Yeah. Did you audition?”

He shoved it away, slapping himself in the face. “I… I don't know.”

“You… don’t know?” 

Suddenly, it was like something had contorted in his expression, a switch being pulled. I wasn't expecting him to twist around so fast. The guy slowly cocked his head, his lips breaking into a grin. His eyes, however, stayed the same. 

“Of course I've auditioned.” He said, with a laugh. 

“It was the best experience of my life!" His mouth formed an almost mocking frown. 

“Unfortunately, I didn't make the cut. Which is a real shame. I'm sure Caeles would have benefited from my talents.” 

What was weird, is that his mouth was moving, but he wasn't even looking at me, frenzied eyes caught in an oblivion I couldn't see. 

When he *did* look at me, his expression crumpled all over again.

Pepto jumped to his feet, brushing himself down. 

I couldn't take his over the top smile seriously, when his eyes were screaming, hollowed out caverns silently begging me to listen.

This guy was fucking crazy. 

“Wait.” Pepto whispered, when I turned to walk away. 

He pulled out his phone, tapping the screen before shoving it in my face. 

**I HAD SO MUCH FUN AT THE CAELES ACADEMY AUDITIONS :)**

When I could only stare at him in confusion, Pepto’s gaze flicked to his phone, swiping bile from his lips. 

His eyes went cartoon wide, like he couldn't believe what he himself was typing. 

“That… that's not what I was trying to say!” He tried retyping it, but the guy was just writing strings of emoji hearts. 

I didn't know what to say. I had dealt with rejection before, but I had never gone this far. Pepto was having a full on mental breakdown, his body shuddering, teeth chattering, blinking eyes and lips parting as if to speak, but choking on his words. When he started clawing out his hair, I took the opportunity to make a quick getaway.

Before I could make it to the doors, though, Pepto jumped in front of me, waving his phone directly in my face. 

“Just…” he pointed at the screen. “It won't let me…” Growing frustrated with himself, he let out a wet sounding sob, clawing his fingers through his hair. 

“Fuck, it won't let me…it won't let me type! It's not letting me type!” 

By now, he had tufts of hair stuck between his fingernails. I don't know why his first reaction was to immediately try ripping his hair out. 

A quick glance at my own phone reminded me of my own audition that was in five minutes. 

Meanwhile, I was dealing with what I was pretty sure was delusion, denial, or a mixture of both. 

I was considering pushing past him, when Pepto’s phone screen hit me in the face. Again. 

This time, though, there was coherent writing. 

**“FIND LUKE.”**

“Luke?” I said. “Who's that?”

“Luke!” The guy was bouncing on the heels of his feet. “He's my…” Pepto drifted off, his eyes going vacant, as if I could physically see his brain being plucked from his skull. Pepto dropped his phone, and I grabbed it before it could hit the ground. His hands went to his curls, clawing, scratching, until he was drawing blood across his forehead. 

“I… I don't know! I can't… I can't remember. Luke. He was my… he was my… I don't know, I can't… I can't–”

I stumbled back when he let out a shriek, scratching at his face. 

“Fuck!” He whimpered. “Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!”

Pepto grabbed my shoulders, shaking me, his fingers digging into my skin. 

“I don't know who he is.” He gritted out, pink froth pooling from his lips. 

Pepto broke out into a sob. “I don't… I  don't know who he is, but you can find him, right? You can… you can find…”

Again, he trailed off mid sentence, his hands going limp around my shoulders. 

I managed to side step him, swallowing a cry. 

“Yeah, I'll, um, I'll find him for you.”

Pepto backed away, suddenly, stumbling over himself. 

His gaze found mine, vacant, like a baby deer.

“Find *who*?”

I didn't wait around to answer him, pushing through the doors and stepping inside. 

The interior was unsurprisingly even worse than the exterior. 

The elevator was broken, so I had to run up three flights of stairs. 

I expected at least an attempt at an academy, even in the dregs of an old dentist surgery.

What I got, though, was a never ending staircase, obnoxious photos of teeth greeting me on every level. 

The third floor was… less clinical. 

I strode directly into a waiting room filled with college aged students, either sitting on plastic chairs, or standing around, rehearsing. 

The room itself was cosy enough, a navy carpet and a TV playing a random Twitch stream. 

Situated in the middle was a desk with a bored looking woman behind it. 

Her smile was fake. I could understand her pain. She was stuck in a room with theatre kids all day. 

“Sign here.” She prodded a sheet of paper. 

I was convinced her voice was AI. 

While I was scribbling my details, I took a moment to notice the stark difference from the kids entering the room, to the ones leaving. The kids entering wore wide, confident smiles and were social butterflies, chatting amongst themselves. 

The kids *leaving* reminded me of pod people. 

They left the room silent, in an orderly line with dazed smiles on their faces, like they weren't sure where they were. 

I watched one guy walk directly into the wall instead of taking a left toward the exit, and a girl straight up just toppled down the stairs.

The kids waiting with me named them *rejects*. 

I wasn't convinced until I glimpsed an empty bottle of Pepto Bismol sitting on the floor by the window. 

Thinking back to Pepto, that made a *lot* of sense. 

I was still dazedly staring at the bottle, when my name was called. 

Jumping to my feet, I did my best to calm myself down, straightening my ponytail. Pepto had really screwed with my head. I could barely even remember the lines I had been rehearsing for a week straight. 

I was muttering my lines to myself, when I stepped through the door. 

The door that apparently turned you into a pod-person on the way out. 

For a moment, I thought I was blinded by stage lights. 

It was so bright. 

The glow bathing me was clinical, stabbing into my eyes. 

When I blinked, I found myself standing in front of three shadows sitting in front of me. 

Their chairs were made of leather, far different from the plastic ones in the waiting room. 

So, they *did* have filthy cash. 

I was looking at one man, and two women. 

They were… average?

I expected them to be more glitzier, but they were just regular people. 

The man was in his late twenties, maybe early thirties, a stiff looking brunette wearing a suit and tie, one leg crossed over the other. His eyes were narrowed slightly, lips curved into the start of a smile. Like I *amused* him. 

The women were polar opposites. 

One of them was my Mom’s age, grey hair and floral clothing. She took a sip of water, her gaze burning into me. 

Google told me not to be intimidated by their stares, but it was impossible. 

These people were carving holes into my skull. 

Sitting next to her, a younger girl who seemed to own the color red. 

Her hair simmered, blood red, while she herself was sculpted in a dress, perfect cherry lips spread in a wide smile.

With a little too many teeth. 

They studied my face like I was already theirs, drinking in every inch of me. 

Freddie said I had to find a weakness in their expression and use it to my advantage. 

If I could find the prick of a genuine smile, I could become their favorite. 

“Hi!” I said. My caffeine intake was starting to take effect. 

I didn't realize I was bouncing up and down until I caught myself. 

Red’s smile stretched wider. 

Maybe they liked my eagerness.

“My name is Misa.” I introduced myself, staying casual, keeping my arms by my sides. “I'm twenty one years old–”

I choked on my next words when Red spoke up. “Impress us, Misa,” Her voice was a smooth, almost seductive rasp, and I felt myself fall into it, enveloped in sugar that was too sweet, and yet I couldn't stop myself. She folded her arms across her chest, her gaze challenging me to do something different. To make her *want* me. 

“Show us something we have *never* seen before.” She stood up, cat-like eyes narrowing, “Show us how desperate you are to join this prestigious class.”

I nodded, and began. 

I had planned a whole monologue, practised it over and over again, forcing Freddie to judge me with a none biassed opinion. 

I was three lines in, when Red started laughing. 

“Stop.”

I did, my cheeks heating up, and she started clapping. 

“Sweetie, oh, stop, you're adorable!” She said, her lips curving into a cruel smirk. 

She leaned forward, like I was something that entertained her, jostling her heeled foot. “We don't take amateurs. I think you need to go back to school.”

This woman was definitely a psychopath. 

Empty eyes sparkling with a gleam that definitely enjoyed humiliating candidates, and a twisted smile that was a *little* too wide. Red made me want to crawl into the ground. 

She made me want to turn around, leave the room, and quit my dream. I was aware of my own fury, my embarrassment turning my cheeks crimson. I matched her. 

Maybe that's what she wanted all along. To wear the color of her victims. 

Taking a shaky step back, I started to nod, started to agree, my mouth choking with the words, “You're right. I'm sorry for wasting your time."

I had never received proper constructive criticism from a professional standpoint. 

Which meant I really did suck. 

But I didn't move. I didn't want to move, and Red continued laughing, her companions sitting in silence. 

The man rolled his eyes with a loud, exaggerated sigh.

Like I was *boring.*

The older woman pulled out her phone. 

“Misa, you are…cute.” Red said. “But you're not *quite* what we are looking for.”

I wasn't sure I could admit it right there, but she made me feel things. 

Like I was ignited. 

Like I was going to prove this crazy bitch wrong.

I found my voice, strong and confident, despite my hammering heart.

“Give me another chance.”

Red’s lips curled. “So cute, Misa. Oh, sugar bear, It would be better if you left the room. Unless you want to embarrass yourself further! In that case, be my guest!”

She turned her attention to her nails, nudging the guy. 

“Dinner?” She hummed. “I'm thinking of Italian. You are quite the wine connoisseur, Nicholas. Why don't you introduce me to your favorite?”

“Hey.” I blurted. 

They ignored me, getting a little *too* close. 

I don't know why I continued, reading my lines, screaming them, so I would be heard. I read them perfectly, and tweaking the genre from drama to romance, and then to horror. I became three different characters, a high school girl struggling with cancer, a final girl, and a woman going through a divorce. 

I was fucking perfect. 

But they weren't listening to me, caught up in their own conversation. 

I tried again. 

And again. 

And again. 

By now, I was on my knees, my fingers ripping into my hair. I was seeing red. 

“We want originality, Misa,” Red said, sucking her teeth. 

Her voice crawling into my skull was enough. 

She still wanted me. 

The thought polluted the back of my mind, taking a strangling hold. She still wanted me. When I lifted my head, Red wasn't looking at me, her gaze on the table grains. “Show us something new.”

I got to my feet, panting, my breath in my throat. 

I became a screaming, strangled mess, a woman who lost her baby. 

Red’s interest was piqued. Only slightly. Through my fraying vision, she slowly turned in her chair. “Again.” She clapped her hands, “Come on, Misa! We want *new!* We want never been *fucking* done before! Are you deaf?”

I couldn't stop the sobs escaping my mouth. 

They lost interest again, right in the *middle* of my reading. 

“Why can't you look at me?” I found myself spluttering. 

When the man pulled out a bottle of water, I pulled off my heel and lobbed it at his face. 

“Look at me!”

He did. Slowly. His gaze found me, for perhaps the first time. 

Not as an amateur, but as a potential candidate. 

Around the twentieth attempt, I started to laugh. Never been done before? I could feel my fingernails already in my scalp, clawing chunks of my hair out. 

Reality contorted, and I felt myself drop to my knees. I was still laughing, spluttering, sobbing. I could still hear her in my head. Never Been Done Before. I started slowly, dragging my fingernails down my face until I felt the harsh sting. 

“Again.” Red said, and her voice led me to stare down at my hands, at pinkish flesh glued to my bones, fleshy mounds. 

So easy to tear. I didn't even feel it. 

Only the sudden, unbridled euphoria of biting into my own skin, locking in my jaw, and ripping into myself. 

When I tore it from the bone, warmth filled my mouth, and I was choking, guzzling down my own flesh, mulling it in my mouth and swallowing.

I can't remember how I got so deep, and why I didn't stop.

Why I didn't fucking scream. 

But it didn't matter. 

Red was standing up. She was clapping, her lips spread into a grin.

Her applause filled me with stars. 

So, I ripped my hair from my scalp, a hysterical giggle escaping my lips. 

She *loved* me. 

I could see her jumping up and down, clapping. 

Louder, and louder. 

Her applause controlled me, twisting and contorting me into hers. 

I didn't even think. I wanted to impress her, and doing *this* was doing just that. 

My fingers were delving into my right eye socket, clawing my eye out. It didn't even hurt. Not with her thundering applause that was deafening, beautiful, an orchestra in my ears.

When I was semi conscious, my eye was crushed in my hand, but my vision was still mine, almost too clear. I could see streaks of red blurred between my lashes. My hair was caught between my fingers. But I wanted to do *more*. 

When I stumbled to my feet, Red’s smile was so beautiful.

The man, however, looked horrified. 

“Someone bring in the one of the successes,” Red’s voice was a shrill giggle, “Bring him in!” she clapped her hands together, and I spat out a fleshy thing. “I want to see them together! I want to see the future in front of us!”

Footsteps coming towards me in slow, shuddery thumps. I looked up, and a shadow was dancing around me. 

When I slowly rose to my feet, I half realized I’d bitten my toe off. The shadow had a face, a boy who was younger than me. I think he *used* to have hair, but half of it was gone, half of it was still stuck between his fists. When I found his eyes, I found twin caverns instead. 

Eyes that were still physically there, and yet there was no life. 

No spark.

I was staring at a dead body, a flesh puppet who had lost his strings. 

When he grabbed my hands, pulling me into a waltz, I caught a smear of scarlet trickling down the back of his neck. When I followed it upwards, his head was covered, slick, dripping with red. 

Like me, *he* matched her too. 

And he was beautiful, she told me, her push, her thunderous applause, guiding me into a waltz. 

His feet moved, perfecting every step, and my foggy mind couldn't understand why. He matched my every move, the two of us floating across the floor. 

My feet knew the steps before my mind. 

How could *he* dance? I thought, dizzily. 

How could he dance, when smeared scarlet followed his twisting, and turning and pirouetting feet? 

Because underneath that swimming clinical light, the back of the boy’s head had been carved away, a perfectly sculpted cavern where his brain should have been. I could see the severed stem, where it had cleanly plucked out. 

His fingers cradled in mine were wet. Swimming in blood. 

His *own* blood. 

Spinning round and around, I imagined myself as a princess. 

I  saw an 18th century ballroom lit up around us. Glittering smiles and glasses of champagne, long, flowing ball gowns.

I blinked, and my head was tipped back, gliding in blood once again. 

When he pulled me to his chest, I stumbled, and a name came to light. 

*Luke*. 

I had found him. 

Our finishing spin left me hard to breathe. 

My body was broken, ripped into, and yet somehow *not*. 

By the time we were finished, the two of us bowing, my mind was full of fog. 

Cotton candy.

“Congratulations!” Red’s smile was inhuman, stretching right off of her face. 

“You're in the S class!”

I was led through a door that wasn't the one I entered from. Inside the room were a dozen or so students, kneeling on the floor. They were missing parts of themselves, like unfinished puzzle pieces. 

I dropped onto my knees next to a girl without a head. I could only see her torso, but I knew she was smiling. 

Looming over us, was the goddess Athena drenched in blood that was still wet.

Dripping, pooling from every crevice of her dress. 

Looking closer, this statue was *moving*. 

Something sickly crept into my mouth. 

Her right eye was human, a twitching eyeball sandwiched inside the stone. 

It didn't match her. It was wrong, horrifying, like a painting, a real *human* eye struggling to focus on us. 

And then, my own gaze found the statues head, where a *real* human brain had been forced inside perfect white, pink, greyish mush dripping down the sculpted, slender neck.

I could see where it had been pushed, pulverised through the stone. 

The statue’s singular eye found me. 

Its dancing pupil jumped up and down. 

Before it blinked. 

Next to me, Luke was on his knees, as if in prayer. 

I can't remember leaving the room. 

I just remember running. 

Back down the stairs, stumbling, staggering over myself. 

I was screaming by the time I reached the doors. 

They opened, as usual. 

But I couldn't get through. I tried, but I was slamming into something I couldn't see. 

Pepto was still waiting outside. The sky was dark.

When he saw me, he stumbled over, slamming his hands into the glass.

I couldn't even understand myself. I was just fucking screaming. 

Pepto held up his phone. 

**“DID YOU FIND HIM?”**

I shook my head. 

“No.” I lied. 

I can't tell him the truth. I don't even know what it is. 

“I can't get out!”

Pepto nodded slowly, typing something and showing me his phone. 

**I'm getting you both out of there. I think I know how I can get inside.**

It's been 3 days, and Pepto is yet to return.

I’ve tried multiple times to cry out for the H word. But it won't let me type it. 

Please H me. I need to get out of this place. 

Fuck. Get me OUT OF HERE. 

Classes start tomorrow.
