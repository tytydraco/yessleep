 I was a college student at Yale. I work as a part time in nearby Macdonalds. I live together with my girlfriend near the collage and me and her split the rent. We can afford rent sometimes. I study in Law Firm while she  study doctoring. Nothing was new for us. Just a typical lifestyle. 

One day I saw my girlfriend in ragged clothes sitting below the old bridge. I was confused why she was there. I got closer to check but a car passed by and she disappeared. I thought I was hallucinating since I didn't get much sleep last night because I had sleep paralysis.  For about a week everything was fine. But then one night I got one of my sleep paralysis. It was typical for me so I thought nothing of it. But then I saw someone with a kitchen knife coming out of the kitchen. I thought it was hallucinating.

 However it looked exactly like my girlfriend. And I saw it furiously stabbed my girlfriend sleeping near me. Blood spilled everywhere but I can't move. I was frightened. And then it looked at me. Dead in the eyes. It made a creepy smile and knocked me out with a baseball bat. That's all I remembered. When I woke up my girlfriend was fine. No blood nor anything.

 I thought it was a dream. But then after I ate my breakfast I saw a little bit of blood on our bed sheet. I asked her and she nervously said her period started. I was confused since her period was over 2 weeks ago. But I was late so I rushed to my lecture. When I got back home she acted weird. She acted happy, then she acted concerned. I thought her period was making changing her emotions.

2 Weeks later, I have more nightmares. Everyday I wake up sweating from all the nightmares. But dreams aren't real so I didn't think much of it. One day she said her mom is sick so she had to go to her mom's house for a week. I was tired to I said fine and she left. That night however I realized her mom is dead for a year now. I thought she was cheating on me with an another guy. I was furious and called her. She picked up and said  "You realized didn't you, it's your time to die" with the voice from the devil himself.

 I was confused. I thought she is pulling a prank on me. That night however, it was a rough night. I heard banging on my door and with a creepy voice it said "Open the door, honey. I'm back" I didn't opened the door since I read too much horror book that I don't want to be the victim. I closed all the curtains and covered the door with the wardrobe.

 I peeked through the window and saw my girlfriend with ragged clothes just like I saw her below the bridge. Her eyes were red, she had a creepy grin. Then I noticed something dripping on me. I looked up and I saw a letter written in blood saying "Time to die". The door opened with a bang. The wardrobe fell and I saw her. She was holding a rusted pipe. I ran out of my apartment into the hall. I knocked on my neighbor's door. It opened and I saw my girlfriend's mom. She was holding a kitchen knife with her devil grin. I ran out of the house. 

I saw a car rushing towards me. I thought I was dead. Everything was over. I got hit by the car. Then I immediately woke up. I was fine on my bed. My girlfriend wasn't there. I thought it was all over my but then I looked at the mirror.  She was back with her ragged clothes but her eyes.

 They were red. They are coming out of her eye sockets. She grabbed me. I screamed for help. While she was grabbing me I couldn't move. But out of sheer luck my friend came in. She disappeared. I friend asked what happened. I just said I stubbed my toe. That night, I became the victim of the Doppelg√§nger. I wrote this before I over bleed and die. If you see me, kill it. I'm not me......
