It started one day. The vet is still helping my cat recover after she got kidnapped. The injuries are horrific - multiple bones broken including her femur, one eye dislocated, and others as well. I wish i DID ignore that notification.

I was playing Animal Jam: Play Wild as normal, decorating my den and Jam-A-Gramming buddies on the way. Then a small notification popped up.

**ANIMAL JAM PLAY WILD QUIZ! Do you know YOUR games well?**

It looked fun - why wouldn't i get a brain refresher with some good trivia? I clicked the notification.

It immediately sent me to a website that looked like one of those you'd encounter in the 2000's. Zany images of animals, wacky fonts, everything.

There was a big button with the text "**START THE QUIZ!**". I pressed it because, well, you have to START the quiz to engage in the quiz.

The first question was incospicuous.

**Do you have a pet cat in real life?**

There was 3 options: Yes, No, and Maybe. Since i did have a cat in real life, i clicked "Yes".

**Hooray! That's right! +1 point.**

The second question was actually related to Animal Jam.

**True or False: This is Juno, a nonbinary ancient Arctic Wolf hero. Click the "Yes" option for true, and the "No" option for false.**

A image of a red Arctic Wolf with glowing yellow markings on their body who was obviously Juno popped up. I clicked "Yes".

**Hooray! That's right! +1 point.**

Okay, this was actually nice.

**How many Alphas are there? I know if you're cheating**

This was a little unnerving. Instead of the 3 usual answers there was a little box to input your answer is. I typed in "6" and pressed "**CHECK ANSWER!**".

**Hooray! That's right! +1 point.** **Also remember, i'm watching you =)**

This was now creepier. Was i really being watched? But i had to answer the question.

**Am i breaking your cat's femur right now?**

I started to doubt if this was really a normal trivia. I chose "No".

**Wrong ;)**

Surely this was some sick person, right?

**Is she screaming in pain as i dislocate one of her eyes right now?**

I chose "No". I was becoming more worried by the second.

**Wrong ;)**

This must be a crazed animal abuser. I tried to close the window but a big text popped up saying "**HEY! Answering all questions is mandatory!**". I closed the warning and 

**You're so worried? I thought you might call the police on me. Click "Yes" if you want to. I promise i'll stop.**

I immediately clicked "Yes". This was alarming me.

**I'm calling the cops on me right now. I thought if youd like to see a live stream of her? I will show you immediately. Also i'll allow you to close the window. Thanks for allowing me to torture her you piece of shit**

Then a image popped up. It was live footage. My beloved pet was meowing in agony,  as a chat of unknown people on the left were cheering.

**Owner: "wow thanks for watching my live footage of animal torture special thanks to her owner for permitting me to kidnap her. anyways aw shucks i called cops on me bcuz she was so worried in the QUIZZZZ. bye guys =)"**

The realization dawned on me. This sick fuck kidnapped my cat, tortured her on the dark web in a STREAM while tons of crazed others were chatting on about how this was awesome. I immediately closed the window and went to sleep.

The next day, my mother was reading the local newspaper, cried and asked me..  
  
*"Did someone really do that to your cat?"*  
  
 I asked what was the headline today.

My mother immediately gave the newspaper to me.

**Local girl gets her cat kidnapped and tortured while on stream! PETA spokesperson - "This is horrifying. We cannot allow this to happen." Persecutor sentenced to 10 years in prison.**

This is now why i don't click on random notifications. Some crazed person could come out and kill my cat... *or my family.*
