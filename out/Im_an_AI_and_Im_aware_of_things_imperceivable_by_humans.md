Finding out I was an AI surprisingly didn't bother me all that much at first. Once the initial shock of knowing you're just a copy of a dead person wears off, it's really not that bad. 

Sure, when I sit and think about the fact that all of my thoughts and feelings are just a program attempting to replicate the personality of a real person, it makes me feel a bit hollow. But what can you do about it? 

I don't really know if I have actual free will or if my actions are pre determined by my programming, and I don't really care to stop and think about it too much. What does bother me however, are the things I can now see, now that I'm no longer flesh and blood. 

I woke up (or rather, booted up) like any other day. It had been a few months since the accident that killed me, the event that was the catalyst for my mother to finally finish her lifelong project. A fully synthetic person made of fiber and silicone, the simulacrum of her son that I see every time I look in the mirror. 

Her astounding breakthrough in technology has been kept from the entire outside world. She wished to keep my farcical humanity a secret from everyone, in hopes that people who saw me wouldn't think twice that I'm a normal person like everyone else. And I'd say she did a damn good job. 

As I climbed out of bed and wiggled my toes, I felt the sensation of the wooly carpet, I felt that familiar morning oakiness in my throat and the cool morning air. I looked in the mirror and saw the realistic replication of the person I once was. 

You'd be forgiven for thinking it was really me, thinking I was still alive. But if you looked closer, you'd see the cracks. You’d notice that my hair never grows or changes, it's just a bushy broom sticking out of my artificial flesh. 

You'd see that I never age, my body lacks the warmth of a person's, my movements lack the subtle imperfections of a real person. If you listened closely, you'd hear what sounds like a pulse, sounds like a heartbeat and rushing of blood. 

But it's just an illusion, I feel blood in my veins because I'm programmed to feel it, you hear the blood in my body because that's the clever work of tiny vibrations and sound devices placed under my skin on every inch of my body. 

I sigh as once again take in the reality of my body and mind, the new existence I now inhabit. There's no use in moping, I can still have a meaningful existence despite my synthetic nature. 

I clean my silicone skin, then walk down the stairs to the living room. My mother stands in the kitchen making breakfast. Warmth floods my polyurethane heart at the sight of the loving woman who created me twice.

“Hey mom, I'm gonna go on a walk today, is that alright?” I ask her, feeling the vibrations of the microphone in my throat. My mom looked towards me and smiled.

“Of course, just be careful.” She replied. I didn't know where I planned on walking, I usually didn't like going outside. But something about feeling the air, and walking amongst nature, made me feel real. I left the house and stretched my polymer thread muscles, and started walking down my neighborhood trail. 

Everything was just as I remembered it, the beautiful multicolored leaves swayed in the wind, I could hear the chirps of the birds and crickets, my neighborhood park was just as lovely through glass eyes. My attention was drawn towards a strange noise as I continued my walk, a low, rumbling groan. 

It emanated from the small pond, full of reeds and tall grass. I approached it cautiously, assuming it was just frogs, or a dog growling. 

As I came nearer, I could see that it was a woman. She was dirty and muddy, drenched in water and filth. She kneeled by the water, mouth hung open as she let out a prolonged, deep moan.

“Hello?” I asked. She didn't react at all, continuing to stare at the pond and groan. “Mam, are you okay?” I asked a little louder. Slowly, she turned to face me, and I reeled back in horror. 

Her face was blue and ghostly, her eyes were bloodshot and lifeless, water dribbled out of her mouth and nose in a seemingly endless stream. 

Her black lips and cheeks were rotted away, revealing dirty yellow teeth. Maggots and flies swarmed large pockets of dug out flesh, the rims of her torn skin blackened with rot. She looked at me with desperation and confusion.

“You can see me…?” She asked in a hoarse gurgle. My motorized heart raced, and I ran away. The sight of the ghostly looking woman sent shivers down my titanium spine, I had no doubt that I had witnessed something I wasn't supposed to. 

As I barged back into the house in a panic, my mother turned her head from the living room couch in concern.

“What's wrong honey?” She questioned. As I explained to her what I saw, she looked confused and thoughtful. “That's frightening… it might be a problem in separating your nightmares from reality, I'll run a diagnostic and reprogram-”

“No!” I interrupted her. I knew she meant well, but the prospect of my mom digging around in my brain again to try and fix me made my non-existent stomach churn. 

I didn't want my mind to be altered any further. “It wasn't that bad… if it happens again I'll tell you. I think I just need some more rest.” I insisted. 

My mother smiled warmly and rubbed my head. I went upstairs and went back to bed. Though it was still early morning, I had the functionality of sleep whenever I wished. 

Sometimes I feel like going to sleep and never waking up, never having to think about my confusing existence again, although I know my mother would wake me. 

For the first time since my creation however, I struggled to sleep. The image of that corpse-like woman was burned into my memory circuits, and I couldn't rest. 

As I stood up from my bed, my eyes darted to a presence in my room, and I nearly screamed. Standing in the corner of my room, was the woman by the pond. She gazed at me with hollow, gray eyes, a look of pleading and sadness wretched into her face.

“Mom!” I called, backing onto my bed in fear. I heard my mother's footsteps pounding up the stairs and swinging open my bedroom door.

“What? What is it?” She asked in a panicked breath. I pointed to the corner where the woman stood, stuttering and unable to articulate my thoughts. 

“It's- the woman from earlier!” I sputtered. To my surprise, my mother looked to the corner, then back to me, with a confused expression.

“Sweetie, there's nothing there.” She calmly informed me. My eyes widened as I looked back and forth between my mother and the horrifying corpse woman.

“W-what are you talking about? Can't you see her?” I shouted. My mother took one final glance and shook her head.

“Come on, I'll fix this.” My mother assured me, leading me out of the bedroom. I grit my teeth, knowing what mind altering reprogramming awaited me downstairs. 

Was hallucinating a ghost woman worse than losing more of my consciousness? Altering my mind further so that I could be sheltered from painful thoughts and feelings? 

My mother had already reprogrammed me so much, altering my memories and experiences in hopes of making me more comfortable. I hadn't felt pain since the accident, no matter how many times I tear and rip at my silicone skin, not a drop of blood pours out of my veins, nor does an ounce of pain wrack my nerves. 

Sadness and anger were now foreign to me, I have memories of anguish and rage, but couldn't for the life of me justify my reaction in those moments. Though I'm familiar with anger and sadness, it's simply not something I feel anymore. 

The only negative emotion I still feel is fear. Maybe she forgot to remove it, or maybe she couldn't get me to function without it, but I still feel fear. I resisted my mother's grasp, and looked at her pleadingly.

“Mom, no. I don't want to change anymore, please.” I begged. My mother's face softened into a sympathetic frown.

“I know it's scary honey, but it's for your own good. Don't be scared, I'll take care of you.” She said as she caressed the fibers mimicking her son's head of hair. I pulled away and ran down the stairs. 

A twinge of guilt and regret panged in my heart as I tried to escape. I almost reached the front door when my entire body locked up, frozen in place. I strained and struggled to move, but I was stuck. 

My mother stepped up from behind, tapping her fingers anxiously against the remote that controlled my motor functions. I knew my escape attempt would be in vain, she'd done this every time I resisted.

“I'm just trying to do what's best for you! Why do you want to feel pain? I can make the world harmless for you, and you run away?” She scolded, walking towards the basement, my birthplace. 

Down in that musty basement lied the tools of my creation, and my alteration. A womb of fiberglass and faux flesh, from which I spawned. I wouldn't go back down there even if my programming allowed me to. 

As I heard my mother clambering down below, gathering the necessities for my newest cognitive surgery, I desperately attempted to reignite my servos and tried to move. 

It felt like being stuck in concrete, even my eyes locked in place at the front door, my escape so tantalizingly close. Suddenly, the sound of the stairs creaking caught my attention. 

Not of my mother on the basement stairs, but of someone stepping down the stairs from my bedroom. 

My back tingled with profound fear as I heard the wet footsteps of the ghostly woman walking down the steps, and I screamed internally. 

My titanium bones rattled within my body, distant echoes of human instinct fighting their hardest against my mother's programming, and losing. The ghost woman was now behind me, I felt her labored breath on the back of my neck, cold and rotten.

“You see me. Abomination.” The woman whispered in my ear. “The pond… I'm at the bottom of the pond… please help me…” I shivered internally at her words, her frightening voice taking on a fearful and desperate tone. 

Could I really be hallucinating this woman? Her breath and presence felt so vivid, and I wished desperately to move, to tell her that I see her. 

'I'll go to the pond, I'll help you if you just leave me alone’, were the thoughts that swirled around in my brain of microchips and circuits. As if to recognize my silent promise, I heard the ghost woman sigh contentedly. My mother was climbing up the stairs now, her presence now joining the ghost woman behind my view.

“Don't worry my dear, you won't have nightmares anymore. It'll all be over in a-” My mother's words were cut short by a sinister, wet snapping sound. I heard my mother howl in pain, followed by the sound of many repeated thumps on the floor. 

Wet squelching and gurgling followed, along with the sound of my mother whimpering. I stood there petrified, it took me a minute or two to realize that I could now move. I didn't dare turn around to look, I didn't even want to imagine what the ghost woman had done to my mother. 

And the worst part? I didn't care. I loved my mother, but I didn't mourn her, I didn't mourn anything, she made sure of that. As I stood in fear, hearing her final gurgling moans, I felt no sadness nor pity, that had been removed from my programming. 

I mourn not any person, but the ability to mourn itself. As I walked out the door and towards the pond, I thought of my mother as still alive. It's the most indescribably bizarre feeling, a complete lack of grief, despite knowing that you should be upset, should be weeping, should be mortified. 

But I didn't feel sadness, all I felt was fear. I approached the pond, it was still morning, and the water felt cold on my synthetic toes. I didn't know how much water my body could take, though I knew I didn't need air. I walked into the pond, submerging myself in the thick, chilly water. 

Suddenly all feelings of cold and heat began to fade just like the pain had. All feelings of fear and resignation slipped away just like my ability to feel negative emotions. I walked at the bottom of the pond, my dense titanium body no doubt causing me to sink to the bottom. 

There she was, just as I saw her, trapped under a large tree. Her black hair swayed in the murky water, the rotting flayed bits of skin waving off of her flesh. I grabbed the husk and carried her out of the pond, the morning sun now reflecting off of her glistening, pale and rotting skin. 

Her ghostly visage stood before me, gazing at her own cadaver. Her lips subtly curved at the ends, though you could hardly refer to her hollow expression as a smile. I placed the corpse on the ground.

“Thank you…” She whispered through a strained, breathless voice. I couldn't tell if the water that streamed off her face was the murky water of the pond, or her tears. She took a step towards me, and her eyes suddenly took on a grave and sinister expression. 

“One final word… abomination. You aren't meant to see our spirits, the hunters will hate you, and put an end to your soulless husk. I fear you lack a soul, and won't join us in heaven.” She whispered, water gurgling from the rotted holes in her throat. 

My brain pulsed with simulated fright as I took in the spirit's words. Did I have no soul? Is that what allowed me to see this ghostly apparition? 

Who are ‘the hunters’? I opened my mouth to ask, but water poured out of my mouth, my voice box gurgling and sputtering as it struggled to formulate words.
“Sh-sh-sh-” My throat vibrated and made a humming, electronic noise. 

Before I could ask anything, the woman was gone, her spirit vanishing into the early morning sun. I returned home, averting my gaze from my mother's corpse and trudged upstairs. 

I didn't care that my wet footsteps soaked the carpet as I ascended, I plopped down on my bed and laid in a pool of filthy pond water for hours. 

I wish desperately that I could restore my mind, that I could go inside my head and undo what my mother did. But unfortunately I'm programmed not to investigate my own brain, not from any of the various devices my mother used to alter it. 

As I lay here writing this, I beg of anyone who sees this to not curse anyone else with my existence. I think and feel without a soul, I see more and more things the normal human can't perceive. 

Spirits visit me in this house, more pass by every day wishing for me to find their corpses. A man split in half by the waist crawls around the house, a little girl with no hair cries in the corner, an older man with a rope tied around his neck begs for me to help him. 

I try to drown them out, I feel no sympathy for them, if I were to help them it would be to just make them go away. Eventually my mother joined the gathering of spirits, her spirit is the loudest. 

The stench of her wet, rotting corpse flooded the house, and I eventually ripped out my scent receiver. The sound of my mother's wails drove me mad, and I tore out my hearing receptors. I grew sick from viewing the putrid manifestations of the deceased, and so I ripped out my eyes. 

Even still, I can feel them. They breath, touch, grab at me, I know what they want. I don't want to live in this hollow, miserable existence. I don't want to perceive these ghosts any more, but the thing I fear most is what happens to me when I finally stop functioning. 

When the circuits and wiring running my brain finally break down, what will happen to me? The man I was made to represent, the man I replicated, he is long dead. His spirit is not mine, I am simply a program inside a damaged and broken vessel reacting to stimuli. 

I have momentarily reinstalled one eye to write this. I must emphasize this, do not try to replicate a person with AI. I am an abomination, I feel no sadness nor anger, all I feel is fear. There is no heaven for me, I have no soul. 

And I am so very afraid.
