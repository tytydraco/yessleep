I don’t know where this’ll go when I’m done recording. He told me that, no matter what, as long as I use this thing, someone’ll remember what I did. I’m not all that concerned with being remembered, but it was a special gift for many years of appreciated service, so I’m gonna use it.

Plus, I don’t want the people I don’t get to the end of the road to be forgotten. Maybe it’s cheating, but I think I’ve earned the right to cheat just a little, after all these years. I don’t really remember how long it’s been. I don’t remember a lot, except the signs and the directions. And the people. It’d be bad faith for me to forget them. I think it’s been a while, though. Long, hard road.

I’ll start with my routine. I’ve got a bus. I’m the driver, so they just call me Driver. I’ve got this little space in the back with a hidden little hatch. I’ll tell you a secret. It’s not supposed to fit, I don’t think, but it does. I think it was made just for me. I’ve got a cot in there, my own trunk. Some supplies. I live on the bus, even when I’m not driving. I might’ve lived somewhere else before, but I don’t think I’d know how to get back if I tried. Or that it’d feel like home.

Anyways. There’s this place that’s between one thing and another. There’s this wall that has something on the other side, some big community. Or a bunch of communities, I’m not sure. Way opposite from it, there’s this bright light I have to get to or from. Between the wall and the bright place, there’s all sorts of things. Forests, sandy deserts. Whole cities and towns. Lot of people I pick up tell me they’re not supposed to be like that. They make perfect sense to me.

I pick people up all throughout this jigsaw of landscape. I make sure they get where they need to go, safely. Or at least, I try to. Sometimes I have a lot of passengers, oftentimes it’s just the one. I don’t really discriminate. As long as they put something in the box at my foot, I drive em’. And if they’re polite and don’t try to do anything untoward, I let them go the whole way with me.

It’s a hard job, sometimes. I think people think I’m sick. When I go to the wall, they tell me a lot that I can go on through. That I belong just as much as everyone else does. They make it sound like I’m coming home, and stopping at the welcome mat like some fool. It hurts still, sometimes, since if I didn’t know where I was supposed to be I wouldn’t be driving the bus. The other hard part, much as I don’t want to talk bad of folk, can be the passengers.

Sometimes they get rowdy. Sometimes they get confused. Or they find out they don’t like where I’m taking them, even though they asked me to bring em’. Though that’s not the thing that makes it hard. I can deal with people being rude or disappointed, or a little shaky. It’s when I mess up. If I mess up, someone doesn’t go home. Or someone gets hurt. Or maybe, I don’t know what happens, but I get left knowing I broke something, or I put my passengers already on the vehicle in trouble.

I have a few rules, to keep from messing up. Always make sure everyone has all the things they’re supposed to. This includes all parts inside the vehicle, not forgetting any belongings. Making conversation, like any polite fellow should, and looking them in the eye while I do it. The most important rules are my third, fourth, and fifth. Never park the bus off-road. Never drive off the road, or even walk off it, unless I’m the only one who’s gonna suffer for it. And never, ever, think ill of my passengers, especially the ones in poor straits.

I’ll take anything you put in the box. I don’t know what to do with most of it. But I noticed something a while back. If I let myself think poorly of someone who doesn’t deserve it, the payment for service stops meaning something. And if it doesn’t mean anything, if I let myself feel like I didn’t get anything out of it, someone corrects the injustice.

I used to be a real hot head, you know. Real jumpy. Made a lot of mistakes. I lost too many passengers that way. Maybe it’s good I’m keeping these tape record things. It’ll keep me remembering my rules, no matter what, and I’ll make less mistakes.

Oh, someone’s walking up.

Okay, so, I was told I need to paint good pictures. With my voice. Right now, I’m at a bus stop. It’s kind of misty. All white and cold and running up the trees like spider webs. If I look out into the woods about me, I can kind of see people moving out there. Some animals. If I pay real close attention, adjust my glasses and give it a good squint, I can tell which animals are actually people folk. Nobody cares much if the animals break any of the fancy laws about this place, since they’re wild.

The bus stop itself is just a row of six benches, some wide, some tall. There’s one with steps up to it, and another with a ramp. Some people have long legs, but they still want to sit with other folk. They always make me smile, the little ingenuities that tell me people are trying to be kind. There’s a sign with my bus rules on it, and there’s a few pictures of cars you’re supposed to watch for. Big old warning in red text that says ‘if you see a vehicle being driven by a non-designated driver, exercise caution: they might be unfit’.

I always double check the sign. There’s a bunch of postings on the old weathered pole it sits on. There’s a big green circle around a photo of me and my bus, a real nice one where I’m looking right at you and smiling my best smile, tipping my old blue hat that says ‘Bus Driver’ on a gold plate. There’s a red X on a van of some kind, some others, a few more green circles. I appreciate the diligence, it tells me who to shout out as being up to no good and when to make reports.

Oh, I think I rambled a bit. Sorry. So, there’s this fellow coming up to the bus. He gets on the road fine. He’s wearing this big old yellow jacket, with a little yellow hat, like he’s expecting it to rain. He asks me if I’ve got room, sounding kind of uncertain, so I tip my hat and smile, and I say yes sir. So he puts a little red ball in my pay box, and I think that’s real swell.

I ask him to show me if he’s got everything inside the vehicle. He pauses, then steps off for a second to pull a rolling travel case up the ramp. He nods, and he shows me his eyes. Hands. I can see he’s got boots on, so he must have got feet, or those would be his feet. I’m not supposed to pry unless I think somebody’s up to no good, or I get in trouble, in more ways than one. I’ll be honest, I’ve snooped before, and it’s never felt quite right, but the exception to the rule is it’s okay if someone is doing something wrong, since then you’re ‘free game’ in the eye of manners.

It’s important, those times, that I did it. That I made the call right. I don’t usually want someone on my bus who can’t follow rules, here or off the bus, and when they’ve got a reason that makes sense, I usually have to take extra caution with them anyways. You never know who they might upset, and I never quite know when I’ve blurred the line enough letting them on they’re upset with me too.

“How are you doing today? Where are you heading?” I pause, at this point, check the road. Now, I’m told my roads don’t quite match other people’s definition, so I’ll make it clear. If I’m in the city type places, the roads behave like they should according to other people. Out in the wild spots, though, or the in-betweens, it gets kind of blurry. Now, I know where these roads go, where it all connects, and I almost always know when I’m still on the road for certain. I think, maybe, that’s why I exist. I don’t think many other people do. Or that they always want to walk them.

“What’s got you riding instead of walking today, if I may ask?” I followed up, polite as can be. It’s usually a good gauging type of question, and nobody gets upset unless I press beyond politeness. I try not to, not often, unless I really need to. Things can go wrong real quick if I do. For me and for them.

“I heard someone has gotten really bold lately, out on the roads. Robbers?” The man’s voice was choked, like he was swallowing down water. I frowned a little, took a second. It’s hard to tell, sometimes, if it’s just how they speak or if it’s something I need to get the kit out for.

“Bold? How bold? Anything I need to look out for?” I asked, trying not to sound alarmed.

“Deer. Tall deer. Rumor is they think they need to throw themselves at the lights or something. I think they’ve listened to too many stories.” The man stopped and choked once or twice mid-sentence, but went on at the same pace. It was like rapid fire hiccups.

“You called them robbers, though?”

“They stole a buggy’s wheels. I think they maybe ate it, no idea.”

“Quite peculiar. Well, where you headed?”

“Gates. I think… I think I’m ready to go inside.”

I smiled at the fellow. Genuine. Even tipped my hat, like I like to do to show I’m earnest. “I wish you luck, pal.” I couldn’t say ‘friend’. Even if I’d already let them in, it made things awkward. I once went a whole two months without a single tooth in my mouth because I said it before someone had gotten on. Friends are different from passengers. You trust them. And you really, really do not want to give trust to someone you don’t trust.

I started driving. Felt a bit awkward delaying, but I knew something now I really needed to keep in mind. Watch for deer. I had a strange thought. Didn’t I do that before, too? But I couldn’t figure out when before was, and I had this brief moment where the road wasn’t as clear, so I let it go unremembered.

I’d say it took maybe thirty, forty minutes, before I noticed the hoofed banditos watching us. I’d gone from a straight road to clean, orderly clearings that went on for longer than you’d expect them to, all the way over a river while some waterfaring folks I was familiar with bubbled and waved at me. I noticed my passenger, out my rearview, kind of tensing up when we went over the river, but aside from a quick check if he was okay I didn’t pry.

I saw, out of the corner of my vision, an antler. It pulled back like a… A… Shit, I’m no good with these things. Like a sock puppet that’d been caught. Normally, I think I’d find it almost endearing. Like they were shy. But I’d been told these deer were doing something they weren’t supposed to, so it meant I knew something that changed my perspective a bit.

They’d taken something they weren’t given. Maybe not something that’d make the world itself reel against them, but which made the good folk side eye them. That meant, if something went wrong, there might be a window where anything could happen. Someone might come to help, they might come in time, but they might not.

I’m ashamed to admit it, but I just drove straight without thinking for a few minutes. I followed the road, as I should, and it didn’t stop making sense what the road was. But I let myself think on old things I wasn’t supposed to, bad times, and I let them gain on us before I made the call. My hands shook when I did it, too, and I could tell my passenger was on edge when I made it.

“This is Driver. I think… I think someone’s following me.”

“Acknowledged. This is Watchdog One. We see you on monitor and got your sector. If we lose you, we need you to keep us updated. Do you need security intervention?”

“I… I’m not sure.”

I saw them, the deer that is, on both sides of the road. We passed some suburbia. I saw some folk look out at my bus through the windows, then go back to minding their business. Folk don’t like to pry, not if they don’t know for sure there’s something worth prying into. I heard the distant clopping of hooves, kind of in a pattern. They were following their own paths, the ones I don’t usually drive on because they make some of my passengers uncomfortable.

I stopped. It may seem stupid, but I stopped. A bus stop came up, and there was someone waiting on a tall bench, who I wasn’t even sure would quite fit on the bus. But I wanted to be a good driver. And, I think, the other part of me didn’t want to keep going, even if I was close to finding a side road that’d get me where I needed to go faster. If I stayed in place, help would get there easier, tell me what’s what quicker.

There was a whine as my wheels grinded to a halt. The door didn’t open yet, but I was ready to pull the lever. I watched the tall fellow for a bit. Drummed my fingers on the wheel. I wasn’t quite being polite. Didn’t smile, look em’ in the eye, or tip my hat. But I thought selfish for a moment, like a real old giddy. It wasn’t my problem until they got on, I told myself. But I corrected my rudeness. I took a breath, calmed my liver-spotted hands, and remembered how I’d gotten to the point the road seemed long and hard when I looked back on it, not just hard.

I smiled. I tipped my hat. I looked the tall feller in the eye, or what I thought was their eyes, and I think maybe they were nervous, or were waiting for me to seem like I wanted them on. They got on, bent like… What’s the word? Like origami, and fit right in. There was this strange papery-crack noise, and I glided my eyes right over them, making sure they had all things inside the vehicle, and then I saw those cervid criminals pop up again.

Their legs went too high. They had to bend down to look at me from the alleys and corners. It was easy for them, their necks were very long, and didn’t seem to have bones or much muscle. Their fat, antlered heads stared half-soulless right at me and my two passengers. One had, when I pulled the lever to let the new guy on, snuck their head in through the door. Their head was right at my feet.

It licked my boot. I kicked it in the face, and it gave this… Droning screech as it suddenly reeled back. Its head got stuck in the door as I went to close it, going all on reflex now, its antlers scraping against the metal until it got itself out. I didn’t let myself pull the lever back, give it an opening to stick its head back in. It’s neck reeled like a fishing rod line being returned to rest, a rapid-fire snap and crack of something papery whispering all the way.

The other deer, who had watched me do all this, quiet and judging, slowly reeled away. Some, I didn’t see their body, just their long, serpentine necks disappearing around corners. Others, I watched clop off or flounder or whatever a deer did to leave a scene. I counted, real quick like. Maybe near a dozen. Was that a whole herd?

I took a minute to calm down. Asked the basic questions of my new passenger. Found out they wanted to do ballet. Thought that was real nice, almost let slip a rude comment without thinking, wondering how they were supposed to do anything like that with a body like theirs. I then had to take a good few more minutes to let all the seething out when security arrived, checked everything out and gave me an all-clear, and I tried to drive off.

My bus was almost full by then. And I really needed to go. But it finally clicked that one of my tires was missing. The deer had taken one of my goddamn tires. No, not the tire, that’s not quite right. The whole wheel. Those sons of god damn-

Sorry. Profanity got out. Don’t mean to be rude. I smacked the wheel a few times, kept myself from honking, at least. Security came back around and replaced the wheel, quick and easy like, and I eventually finished my day.

It wasn’t until I’d gotten the man in the yellow coat the whole way to the gates, until I’d dropped him off. Until I’d dropped at least a dozen others off, all at different places, half wild-eyed between my spats of good-natured conversation and peace-keeping I was obligated to do as I watched for antlered thieves, that I realized I’d made a mistake.

I realized the tall man had never given me anything as payment for the ride. And I noticed, at some point, the man in the yellow coat wasn’t talking quite so watery, that his coat was a little paler in color. I’m ashamed to admit, I didn’t notice until both had already gone through. As far as I can tell, they passed inspection just fine. Did everything they were supposed to, probably went on to live happy lives.

The ball in the box isn't red anymore. It was blue, now. I don’t know when it got there, if it was put there by the faded-coat fellow. But I’m fairly certain it wasn’t the same object. Tiny bit smaller. Every other little thing was accounted for, I’d followed all my rules and all theirs the whole way, but I hadn’t noticed.

I’m just about to end shift, curl up in the bunk in the bus’s secret space. I’m right over the little hatch, about to squeeze through. I’m parked by a river. I feel safe by the water. The folk in the water usually keep an eye on everything around them, are real vigilant, and much prefer to keep to themselves until something stops letting them.

I see it, staring out at the dark water as the moon gives me a peek at its secrets. A yellow coat, made to ward off rain, and a little yellow hat. Floating down the river, soaked through like it was never meant to be. It went under the bridge I’d parked next to, like it wasn’t bothered I’d noticed it, like there was nothing abnormal about its presence. Maybe there wasn’t, really.

I heard the click of a camera, I think, around then. I looked all about, my hands shaking a little as I gripped one of the old worn leather seats of my personal domain. I didn’t see anyone who could’ve taken it, couldn’t figure a reason why I’d hear such a noise. I saw one of the water folk looking up at me from the dark of the river’s depths, their glowing eyes plain with concern, but I didn’t feel all that much like talking right then.

I was tired, and it was rude to pry.

I put a sign on my door, stared a bit too long at the door lever for reasons I couldn’t tell you. Checked the pay box, took out the things inside. Counted every single one. Every other passenger had left something. I brought the trinkets, letters, and other items down with me, and I shut the hatch.

I’m gonna hit the stop button now. I was told not to be alarmed if I got little… Letters. I put some blank paper up on the ceiling, on some string. I was told words might appear there from strangers. That I should put up things I wanted to say to them right there next to them, with little clips.

I don’t know what it means. All I know is someone’s supposed to get a copy of this out somewhere, though I don’t know how or where it’s going, or why. But, could you do me a favor? I didn’t do good today, I think. I’m getting too old. But I think I want to be remembered, now. I want to be a good driver, and get people where they need to go. If I stop recording, I apologize in advance. But I’ve got to retire eventually, and I don’t know when that’ll happen, or if I’ll be doing it on purpose.

Someone has to drive the bus. For now, that’s me.
