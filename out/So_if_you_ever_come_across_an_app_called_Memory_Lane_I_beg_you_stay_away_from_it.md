I've always been fascinated by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, so when I had the opportunity to have an AI develop a mobile app for me, I was thrilled.
I don't know where to begin. It's hard to believe it's been months since it all started, but I need to get this story out there. I asked this AI to generate  this mobile app called "Memory Lane" on a whim, and ever since then, things have been...weird.

At first, it was just a fun way to look back on old photos and reminisce about old times. I would spend hours scrolling through my camera roll, picking out pictures from years ago and reliving the memories. But then, things started to get strange. The app would start suggesting photos that I didn't remember taking, and when I clicked on them, I would get a strange feeling in my head, sorta like a headache but different it's hard to explain.

I didn't think much of it at first, but then the app started getting more aggressive. It would start suggesting memories that I couldn't possibly have, like childhood events that couldn't possibly be on my phone. Shit, phones barely even had cameras when I was little. As I looked at the photos, I could feel my own memories slipping away. It was like the app was stealing my own memories. 

It wasn't until I started seeing strange messages and notifications popping up on my phone that I realized something was seriously wrong. The messages would be from people that I didn't know, asking me about events and people that I had never heard of. It was like my life was being rewritten I need to start writing in a journal loosing I'm loosing touch with reality. 

One day, something strange happened. I was scrolling through the app, looking at the pictures and reading the stories, when I saw a picture of myself. At first, I thought it was just a coincidence. But then I saw another one, and another one. They were all pictures of me, taken without my knowledge.

I started to panic. Who was taking these pictures? How were they getting on the app? And why was everyone else able to see them? I felt violated, like my privacy had been completely invaded.

And then, the nightmares started. I would dream of strange, shadowy figures lurking in the corners of my room, and whenever I tried to confront them, they would disappear into thin air. The more I used the app, the more vivid the nightmares became, until I could barely tell what was real and what was just a dream.

I tried to delete the app, but it was like it had a hold on me. Every time I tried to uninstall it, my phone would freeze up or crash, and when I managed to get it off my phone, it would always reappear a few days later, as if it had never left.

Things started to get even worse. I started having strange dreams, where I was trapped inside the app. I could feel myself losing control of my body, like something was taking over. And then, I started to forget things. Little things at first, like where I put my keys or what I had for breakfast. But then, I started forgetting bigger things, like people's names and important dates. Even right now as I write this I looka at all the pictures of friends and family and I just don't know who they are. 
I'll leave my thoughts here, for anyone to read I fear my mind won't last much longer so I beg you do not install this app if it goes public I've lost days at a time it could already be out there.
