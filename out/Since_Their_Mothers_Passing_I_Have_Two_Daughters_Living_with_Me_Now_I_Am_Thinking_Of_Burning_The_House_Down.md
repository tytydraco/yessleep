Life in our small town had always been quiet, with the exception of the occasional whispers of the wind that carried secrets from the past. I, Drake, was a middle-aged father doing my best to raise my two daughters, Daniela and Jessica, after the tragic loss of their mother during Jessica's birth.  
  
The house was filled with echoes of laughter, tears, and the pitter-patter of little feet racing through the halls. But despite our attempts at normalcy, an air of mystery lingered in the corners, fueled by the unresolved tensions between my daughters.  
  
Daniela, the eldest, harbored a resentment towards Jessica, blaming her for the death of our beloved mother. Every argument between them ended in Daniela shouting accusations at Jessica, who, in turn, would defend herself through tearful denials.  
  
"My mother is not here anymore because it's all your fault!" Daniela would scream, her eyes ablaze with anger.  
  
"But it's not my fault! I didn't want mommy to pass away..." Jessica's response was always met with a stern interruption from me, desperately trying to keep the peace.  
  
"That's enough! Please, girls, stop fighting each other, for the sake of your mother!" I would plead, though my words seemed to fall on deaf ears.  
  
The tensions escalated, leaving me in a constant state of unease. One evening, after a particularly heated argument, Daniela locked herself in her room, leaving Jessica sitting on the floor, tears streaming down her face. I did my best to comfort her, reassuring her that our circumstances were beyond her control.  
  
As the clock struck 9 PM, I decided it was time to put an end to the day's turmoil. I took Jessica to her room, tucked her in, and promised to read her a bedtime story to ease her troubled mind.  
  
The book I chose was a fairy tale about a traveler and a troll on a bridge. The traveler, a brave soul seeking new horizons, encountered a menacing troll guarding the path. Through wit and cunning, the traveler outsmarted the troll, proving that courage and cleverness could conquer even the most formidable obstacles.  
  
"The end," I whispered, closing the book with a calm smile as Jessica peacefully drifted into sleep. I left her room, hoping that the bedtime stories would provide some comfort and distraction from the brewing storm within our family.  
  
Life continued, and I juggled the responsibilities of parenting and working the early morning shift at the factory. Yet, an unsettling feeling gnawed at my gut, a sensation that something was amiss. It was dismissed as paranoia, until the day I noticed two shadows darting toward our house as I drove away for work.  
  
Initially, I brushed it off as a trick of the light or the shadows of passing birds. But a lingering sense of dread stayed with me throughout the day. As I rushed home after work, the feeling intensified.  
  
Upon arriving, I was relieved to find my daughters waiting as usual. I chalked up the earlier premonition to my own anxious mind. However, over the following months, strange behaviors emerged.  
  
Jessica struggled to eat, Daniela became unusually calm, and Jessica developed a sudden aversion to apples, her once-favorite fruit. Their movements became unsteady, and Jessica fixated on a static-filled TV, referring to it as her favorite show.  
  
My concern grew, and I decided it was time to seek professional help. I made an appointment with a local pediatrician, hoping that their odd behaviors were nothing more than a passing phase. Little did I know that the journey to uncover the truth had just begun.

The Saturday morning sun shone brightly as I led my daughters, Daniela and Jessica, to the pediatrician's office. Dr. Vinny welcomed us with warmth, complimenting the girls before ushering us into a small assessment room.  
  
"How are they doing, Dr. Vinny?" I inquired anxiously as Vinny conducted physical and mental assessments on the girls.  
  
"They seem to be perfectly fine, Mr. Drake. Just a little phase, that's all," Vinny reassured me with a smile.  
  
Relief washed over me, and I couldn't help but express my gratitude with a hug. Vinny reciprocated, and the moment took a humorous turn as Daniela jokingly accused, "Hey, Daddy! You can't cheat on Mommy!"  
  
Vinny, unaware of my wife's tragic fate, apologized, and I took a moment to share the story with her. Understanding the situation, Vinny apologized once again, and we left the clinic with newfound optimism.  
  
As we strolled back home, however, I noticed the peculiar "cross-like" walking pattern that my daughters persisted. When questioned, they dismissed it as normal, leaving me puzzled but choosing to believe they were just playing around.  
  
That evening, while preparing dinner, I realized I was out of salt and headed to the basement to retrieve more. As I descended, an unsettling stench enveloped me. Investigating the source, I stumbled upon a horrifying discoveryâ€”two small skeletons resembling the size of my daughters.  
  
The shock hit me like a wave, and I struggled to comprehend what I had just witnessed. Questions raced through my mind as I tried to understand where those skeletons had come from. "Daddy! Is dinner ready yet?" Jessica's voice called from upstairs, snapping me back to reality.  
  
Quickly grabbing the salt, I ascended the stairs, attempting to compose myself. The dinner session turned into an uncomfortable interrogation as Daniela asked about my actions in the basement. Desperate to avoid revealing the truth, I claimed it was nothing.  
  
Their gaze intensified, and then, a chilling question emerged. "Did you find anything strange down there?" Jessica inquired. Panic surged within me, and I maintained a poker face as I denied any significant discoveries. Something tells me that I shouldn't tell them the truth.  
  
Noticing the growing hostility, I decided to diffuse the tension by promising ice cream if they finished dinner before bedtime. Their expressions shifted instantly, and they happily agreed, as if the unsettling interrogation had never occurred.  
  
Later that night, as I tucked them into bed, an unsettling feeling lingered. I laid on my bed staying awake all night, questioning the true identity of my daughters.  
  
The next morning dawned with an uneasy atmosphere lingering in the air. The events of the previous night had left me unsettled. I entered the kitchen to prepare an egg roll breakfast, I decided to revisit the basement once more to confirm what I saw last night.  
To my bewilderment, the once-horrifying sight of two small skeletons in the basement was now gone. Confusion and disbelief washed over me. Had I imagined the entire gruesome discovery? Was it a figment of my imagination brought on by stress and anxiety?  


Daniella and Jessica went down the basement wondering what I was doing here.  
"Girls, did you go into the basement last night?" I questioned cautiously, trying not to reveal the fear that gripped me. Both Daniela and Jessica looked at each other before shaking their heads innocently.  
"No, Daddy, we were in our rooms the whole time," Daniela answered.  
I couldn't fathom the situation. Were they playing an elaborate prank on me? Or had something far more sinister unfolded in the depths of our home? "What's wrong Daddy? You looked like you just saw a ghost." Jessica jokingly said with a slight giggle.

"There's nothing wrong sweetie. I Must be imagining things. You know how Daddy can be stressed from work right?" Saying these words with a calm tone trying to hide my intentions.

"That's okay Daddy! We love you! You know that right?" Daniela said. I simply grabbed the spare case of sugar next to me and went out of the basement with my two seemingly normal daughters.   
As the day progressed, I couldn't shake the feeling that those two were watching my every move. I decided to confide in a close friend, Jake, about the strange occurrences. We decided to meet up at our local coffee store.  
Jake, always the skeptic, brushed off my concerns initially. "Drake, you're probably just stressed. Your mind is playing tricks on you," he assured me over a cup of coffee. I tried to explain to Jake that maybe just maybe that shadows I saw, the skeletons, the weird behaviors and new profound attitude that my daughters have developed. it couldn't be a coincidence right? 

Jake stared at me with a serious look. "Hey man, look I understand the stress eating away at you. I mean 2 daughters, and no mother to accompany them anymore. Times are tough. Just don't let the stress win over you. Because right now, you look like a maniac" Jake explained his justification with my stress. 

I knew that this conversation would go nowhere so I decided to just end this discussion with Jake. "You know what? Maybe your right." I said with a calm tone. I walked out the front door of the coffee shop with a disappointing look on my face, still holding on to my suspicion that maybe my real daughters are gone. I continued to walk around town for a bit trying to ease my head.  
But the sense of unease persisted. That evening, as I returned home, I found the atmosphere inside the house heavier than ever. The girls were unusually quiet, their eyes staring into the static TV screen.

Trying to maintain a semblance of normalcy, I prepared dinner, but my hands trembled as I sliced vegetables. Every creak of the floor, every flicker of the lights, seemed to echo with a sinister undertone.  
During dinner, I asked my daughters what they were doing the whole day while I was out doing the groceries.   
Jessica exchanged a knowing glance with Daniela before answering, "Daddy, we just watched our favorite show, we really enjoyed it." I decided to play along and told them that I also love the show. They seem to be happy about it. 

However, when dinner is finished I told them to go to bed while I clean up. What happened next, shattered my reality. My 2 girls appear to be stretching their own limbs and crawled on the walls towards their bedroom like a daddy long leg spider moving around. 

I stood there wondering what really happened to my beloved two daughters. Tears dropped from my eyes with this sense of realization that maybe my true daughters have succumbed to some dark force and that they are gone forever, and that I will have to accept whatever is lurking disguised as Jessica and Daniella talking to me in their sweet innocent voices.  
This night, depression came over me. I decided to open my laptop and I am now asking for your advice since Jake isn't helping at all. 

Guys, should I just burn the house down while they sleep? Or accept the new family who were once my two beloved daughters? They don't seem to hate me or try to hurt me in any way. But it pains me to know that my real daughters are gone forever.
