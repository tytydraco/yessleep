I’m the only woman on the dig. 

There are twenty contractors–rough handed Texans who can shovel dirt out of the ground with an ease I can only match spooning sugar into my tea. Other than that, there’s the project manager: Arnie, and his assistant: Eugene. Arnie is a distant, cold kind of guy who likes to wear suits and spend as much time away from the dig site as possible. The office in Dallas has air conditioning, I hear. 

“Where next, Lady Martha?” A contractor asks from the entrance of the humid Portakabin. I look up from the microscope, startled, and point at a grid map on the wall. 

“B2, please. Eugene knows where to start.”

The contractor tipped the peak of his white hardhat and disappeared out onto the scrubland. It’s difficult to tell if they like me. I’m as foreign to them as they are to me, after all, being a tall British woman in a position of leadership. It’s not a role I necessarily want, but Arnie’s absence hasn’t given me much choice. 

Now, I’m not totally up to speed with American colloquialisms for certain words, so I’ll write this in British English and try to put the equivalent term in brackets because I want to be clear–**there is something out there**.

It started in the autumn (fall?) of this year in a small town thirty miles north of London. I work for a global analysis company in the bioarchaeology department. Bioarchaeology refers to the investigation and analysis of organic remains found in the ground. It’s niche, but I love it, and demand has really picked up recently, which is good and bad. It’s a small department. Tiny, actually. There’s me and an older lady whose husband is often ill, so she barely works. The result is that I have to pick up the slack and take on the duties of two employees. Work started to affect my appetite and my sleep, and the recurring headaches I’d had as a teenager, absent for ten years or more, had come back. 

Therefore, when I was offered a chance to be deployed to the USA for three months, I leapt at the chance. The request from the Dallas branch referred to a finding made beneath some scrubland in Arlington of an unknown sample of biological material. Did we, the UK branch, have anyone who could assist? It’s not like I have kids or a husband or a vibrant social life to keep me tethered to the UK. So, why not? I remember learning about some amazing finds in the US when I was studying at university (college?). William Harlow Reed discovered an eighty-foot diplodocus skeleton in Wyoming. What if I found something as incredible as that? The idea of my name hitting the headlines lit a tantalising fire in my belly. *Martha Hollingrake, renowned archaeologist, makes the finding of the century…*

Smelling rain on the runway as I prepared to board the plane brought a lightness to my psyche. I felt elated. Excited. Aboard, I flicked open a book as the Irish Sea, and eventually the Atlantic, shimmered below. I wondered what my mum (mom?) and dad (pop?) would be thinking, if they were still alive. I’d always been bright and eager to please, but never particularly adventurous or flamboyant. I’d excelled at swimming and athletics more than ballet or gymnastics. Things that required grit rather than grace. Strength rather than elegance.

Arnie met me at the airport, and we drove to a motel in Arlington. We stepped out into the mild air under an overcast sky. Arnie pulled out a cigarette and lit it, thumbing dismissively over his shoulder at a road stretching into the distance toward a stand of trees. 

“Dig site’s there.” 

I realised there was nothing vague about his comment. A road's-width away was a cordoned off, two kilometre square patch of grassy scrub.

“Oh, that’s convenient.” I said.

“Indeed.” Arnie said, disinterested. He strode away to confer with the receptionist before returning with a set of keys. 

“I’m sorry, miss, but I have to get back to Dallas to catch my son’s game. Here’s your room key. You’ll find my colleague, Eugene Greer, next door in two-oh-four. Why don’t you knock and introduce yourself? I’ll be in touch tomorrow. Bye now.”

And just like that, I was alone and jet-lagged under a darkening sky. I dragged my suitcase up the stairs, unlocked the door to my room, and collapsed on the springy bed. Cheap wood panelling cladded the walls and a stained net curtain covered the single-glazed window. 

I was too tired to knock on Eugene's door that night, but I was starving, so I mustered enough energy to walk to a supermarket (grocery store?) I’d spotted near the motel. Evening walks had always been relaxing for me back home. I enjoyed the twinkle of streetlights and the flashes of people’s lives you could glean through front windows as you walked past their homes. 

I have to admit that the walk didn’t have a calming effect on me, however. There was no pavement (sidewalk?). How do you guys walk anywhere? Juggling an armful of snacks and being honked at by every passing car, I made it back to the motel. Over the road, in the cordoned area, I saw a figure. A shape. White against the growing black. Humanoid but tall. Far taller than the average human. I blinked, and it was gone.

I quickly forgot about what I’d seen, putting it down to fatigue, and work on the dig site commenced in earnest. Contractors craned in some temporary offices, equipment arrived, and I met Eugene. He’s younger than me, and reticent almost to the point of being rude. Awkward. Gangly. He seems to have a never-ending collection of checked, beige shirts, which he tucks into his never-ending supply of corduroy trousers. Curly brown hair envelops his head, with locks sometimes falling into his eyes that he swats at impatiently.

Over phone calls with Arnie, I got to grips with the task and Eugene seemed to silently fall in behind me when I passed on instructions. I wasn’t trying to assert myself over him and the contractors, but that’s what seems to have happened. Thankfully, he doesn’t mind getting his hands dirty, which I’m grateful for because if he followed Arnie’s example and disappeared, I’d feel a lot more alone. Eugene and I have taken to having our lunch together, sat on a boulder facing the sun.

“Where are you from, Eugene?”

“Dallas.”

“Not far, then. How come you’re staying at the motel?”

“I don’t drive, and Arnie doesn’t–he doesn’t…”

“Doesn’t show up.” I finished.

Eugene looked up from his lunchbox and flashed a smile at me.

“Yeah, pretty much.”

We worked across a grid map sequentially, with Eugene shouting when there was a sign of anything that warranted further examination. I’d go out with my trowel and inspect further, a sudden hush descending as the contractors came to watch.

“Lady Martha gon’ find anything this time?” Someone murmured. 

It was a good question. We hadn’t unearthed anything particularly interesting despite the exciting brief I’d been given about the potential for mysterious biological samples. That all changed when we started digging in grid section B2.

“Martha! Martha!”

“Coming!” I said, grabbing my trowel.

Eugene was squatting, surrounded by hi-viz clad labourers, when he flashed a glance my way. His dark eyes were febrile with excitement.

“No need for that.” He said, nodding at my trowel, and I bent to examine what he held in the palm of his hand.

It was a white, triangular object. Four inches long. Curved and sharp at one end.

“Just fell out of the subsoil.” Eugene said, tipping the object into my palm. I tucked a loose strand of hair behind my ear and frowned.

“Keep digging, but be careful. Eugene, come with me.” I said, ignoring the mutterings and grumblings of the congregation.

I turned off the fan and put the object on the desk. We stared at it.

“It’s bone, right?” Eugene asked, wiping his glasses on his shirt. 

“A tooth, I think. Listen, are there any big cats that live around here? Mountain lions?”

“Not this far east. Maybe in the past, hence why it was down in the subsoil.”

“If it’s so old, then why is there no decay? Teeth usually have a yellow colouring to them too. This looks almost like it's been polished. Could be ornamental. Ceramic, maybe. I’ll need to study it for a while. Good find, Eugene.”

“Thanks.” He said, blushing, before darting back outside.

I washed the soil off the object and examined it under the microscope. If it was ceramic, it would be a solid white all the way through, without the layering of hard enamel over soft enamel. Unfortunately, it was flawless and almost crystalline in quality, so my review was inconclusive. It’d have to be sent over to Dallas for mass spectrometry testing. 

Early evening rolled around with no further finds, which was frustrating. Usually, where there were teeth, there was a skull, which would’ve settled the debate over whether it was genuine or some weird ornament. The contractors bundled into their cars and sped down the straight mile to the motorway (highway? freeway?), leaving Eugene and I alone. We trudged across the field and up the motel stairs to our respective rooms. 

“Night, Eugene. See you tomorrow.” I said with a smile.

“Night.” He said.

I’ve been here a fortnight now, and despite our blossoming friendship, Eugene hasn’t suggested we spend time together outside of work. We’re a paper-thin wall apart, but he could’ve been in Dallas for all the difference it made. 

I got changed into some leggings and a baggy hoodie before stepping out for my evening walk. I’d learned from earlier mistakes, and instead walked down toward the stand of trees off in the distance. No cars seemed to go that way, so it was safer and more tranquil. I glanced over at the chewed up ground of the dig site as I passed it. The chirrup of birds was loud and exotic to my ears. Far from the harsh squawking of English crows, both literally and figuratively. Grassland rolled up to a distant treeline that I didn’t venture beyond because of the lack of light. I could see a cluster of farm buildings (a ranch?) and trodden down turf behind white picket fencing. Power lines. Thorny bushes, loud with cicada-song. I reached a stubby tree fifty feet from the denser forested area, gave its trunk an affectionate pat, and turned to head back to the motel. 

The moon was a slender crescent, rising over my right shoulder in a sinister grin. I heard the soft clocking of my shoes on the asphalt, and my breath. Where had the birdsong gone? And the cicadas? I turned around, wondering what had changed. Was it the wind? The direction I was facing? I did a full three-sixty. Nothing. The sky descended into a deeper blue, like the Atlantic Ocean I’d flown over, but still as a millpond, and watchful. Yes, watchful.

America is a wide open country compared to the UK, I thought, as a cold sweat burst out across my shoulder blades. Gooseflesh erupted on the back of my neck. I quickened my pace as the absurd sensation of being watched announced itself in my head. I looked over my shoulder and saw gleaming eyes in half a dozen places among the trees. It had to be a trick of the light. I glanced around again and saw no eyes other than the dark pits on the head of a huge white figure, casting a reverse shadow–a reverse silhouette on the foliage behind it. Hanging from its mouth was a limp shape, giving the impression of a cartoonishly big moustache. Then it came down on its forelegs and charged. 

A yelp escaped my lips as I sprinted toward the motel, eyes streaming, vision blurred. The thud of my footfall jarred with every frantic step, and my breath was harsh and loud. I realised I wasn’t going to make it. I risked another look and saw the thing sickeningly close behind now. The motel was too far, but the dig site wasn’t. I screamed for help and veered to my left, heading for a portable toilet. I heard low, sonorous snarls as I navigated the rutted earth of the dig site. If I fell into a hole and broke my ankle, it’d be over. I threw myself behind the flimsy door and snapped the lock into place with clammy, shaking hands. 

“Mum, dad, please help me…” I whispered, stinging tears of terror burning my cheeks. I heard something big approaching, infecting the air with its presence. The revolting smell of rotten meat wafted into the cubicle as I clamped a hand over my mouth. The thing outside nudged the door once. Twice. Raking roughly. Then it moved off. I stayed frozen for a few seconds, not believing it had truly gone, and leaned down painfully to peer through a tiny hole near the ground. I was proven right.

It most resembled a bear, but its arms and legs were freakishly long. Its lean body was clad in dirty white fur, from its cruel, pinched head to its flat, taloned feet. It stood upright in a contemplative pose by the B2 pit, still holding its kill in its jaws. Using its arms, it adjusted the limp body and bit down ferociously, growling softly as it did so. The body came apart and the polar bear-thing nudged it with its bloodied snout into an acceptable place. Taut lips snarled high over a double row of razor-edged teeth. The ugliest of the lot were the canines, gleaming white, curved, sharp, maybe four inches long. Just like Eugene’s find from earlier in the day. It sloped off around the back of the Portakabin.

Two hours later, I took some deep breaths, inched the lock into the vacant position and slid outside. The chirrup of birds and cicadas had returned. I made my way over to B2 and saw what the polar bear-thing had left on the lip: a decapitated Alsatian dog. Filled with nausea, I staggered over the road and into the motel car park (parking lot?). I climbed the stairs and returned to my room, sliding my back down the inside of the door. I’m sitting on the welcome mat, typing this in some kind of shock. It’s four-AM. 

What should I do? Knock on Eugene’s door? Call the police (cops?)? Wait for someone else to find it?
