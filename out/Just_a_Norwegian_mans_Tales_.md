**Just a Norwegian mans Tales.** 





First off, I just want to get all the obvious and not-so-obvious stuff out of the way. I'm a 40-year-old Norwegian man. These days, I consider myself a skeptic. But as a child, I had a very vivid imagination and found superheroes, aliens, ghosts, and everything in between fascinating. My mother had her own experiences with ghosts and believed in them. Most days, I believe what I've encountered, but sometimes, I don't, and on other days, it feels like a different life or something.



Anyway, a few nights ago, I was listening to some podcasts as I tried to sleep, and somehow one of them, called "Creepypodden," a Swedish podcast, triggered something in me and made me want to tell my story.



During the 80s and early 90s, my mother didn't work much, and my dad worked most of the time. Every so often, especially during the summers, my mother and I would travel to visit her parents, my grandparents. At the time, we lived right outside of Oslo, and they lived in a small place called Båstad, about 10 kilometers from Trøgstad. My grandfather had built their big house with his own hands in the early 60s when my grandmother got pregnant, and they decided to get married and start a family. The house had a big yard surrounded by grass and trees—some from nature, and some were fruit trees my grandmother had planted. It was right behind a large forest with a single trail that led to a water nobody dared to swim in. I spent most of that summer exploring the woods for the hundredth time.



My mother had a few weird experiences there growing up, and during one of those long bus rides (my dad used our car for work), she told me about a friendly ghost she and her childhood friend had named "Langmann" (which translates to "Long Man" or "Tall Man"). He wore a fancy suit, was almost as tall as their house, and she remembered him as "funny" and felt he was there to protect and entertain them. One summer in particular, I got stuck on that story and hoped to see or meet him for myself. I even remember my mother telling me that the first time she had seen him, it was behind her father's work shed. I vividly remember walking around as a 5-6 year-old boy, talking to myself, trying to introduce myself as my mother's son, saying I meant no harm and wanted to meet him. I never did meet him, but over the next few summers, I was introduced to someone else altogether.



I was around seven, because my mother was pregnant with my little sister when we visited my grandmother for the first time as a vacation after my grandfather had passed away. My grandfather had a sort of cabinet in the kitchen where he used to hide candy to surprise us with. One night, as my mother and I slept downstairs, I couldn't sleep and got up. For some reason, I decided to sneak upstairs and see if my grandfather's candy was still in the cabinet. The house was old, so I walked as quietly as I could, trying not to wake my grandmother or mother with my sounds. When I got to the kitchen, I reached for the cabinet door, but it was locked. I hadn't realized it could even be locked, but I saw a keyhole on it.



I turned on the lights, giving up on the candy and figuring I might snoop around for something else. Then I noticed two sets of keys on a plate next to the sink that I hadn't seen before. For some reason, I just knew one of them was for the cabinet. I grabbed it, stuck it inside the keyhole, and turned the key. Gently opening the door, I was shocked to see an old man, probably in his early 60s, sitting on a small chair (like the ones children might have in their rooms) with his back to me. At first, I was terrified and shocked, but as he turned around and I saw his face, I felt instantly at ease, though still very confused. He looked a lot like my grandfather but, at the same time, he wasn't him at all, same warm eyes and maybe similar facial features but still not him at all. 



He smiled at me and said in a Danish accent similar to my grandfather's (who was originally Danish but moved to Norway at 18 years old),



"I didn't mean to scare you, kid. I just sometimes hide in here from my wife," he said with a chuckle.



I wasn't scared at all, but I was really focused and confused by the fact that he seemed slightly transparent. I didn't really know what to say, so I guess I just nodded as I looked him over. Then, it was as if his eyes made me focus on a small box next to him in his line of sight. I had never seen the box before, but without him saying so, I somehow knew he wanted me to look into it. At this point, I was a little scared. I mean, I had no idea what was inside that box, but for some reason, I trusted him. I walked inside so I could reach the box and leaned over to look inside. It was the candy my grandfather used to have. I remember smiling as I looked at them, feeling safe or safer for some reason. Then, I felt his hand touch my shoulder as he said,



"You can have one. And then you can go back downstairs and go back to sleep, kid."



He sounded both friendly and demanding. I grabbed one and blurted out, "Thanks, Grandpa," before freezing as if I felt like I did something wrong. I knew my grandpa was dead, and I also knew this wasn't my grandpa. He just smiled and shrugged his shoulders as if to tell me it was okay and said, "Knut, or Grandpa, both are fine."



Despite it feeling odd and confusing, I soon found myself relocking the door, locking the man inside as I sucked on the candy. I left the key where I found it and walked as quietly as I could downstairs to go back to bed.



When I got back into bed, I was too excited or confused to sleep, and my mother woke up due to my restlessness. At first, I didn't want to tell her, but soon, I told her everything. I don't remember everything about the conversation, but I remember her being at ease the second I said his name was "Knut." I took that as a sign that she somehow knew him, and I remember cooking up stories in my head that maybe he was another friendly ghost she hadn't told me about, or that she had but I had forgotten.



It wasn't until several years later that I learned my grandfather's first name was "Knut." He used it as a middle name during my childhood, and I, of course, only called him Grandpa. I still feel like it wasn't him, but maybe it was another version of him or something.



Rationally speaking, my encounter with the old man could be explained by grief or something similar. However, my next experience can't be rationalized. I can’t find a logical explanation for it.



A few years later, I had started school, and my little sister was born. My grandmother’s health was declining, so for about a year, my family and I frequently visited her, especially on weekends and during vacations, despite the distance.



During one of those visits, my uncle and cousin Ronny were also there. Ronny is about two years older than me. As kids, we had a strange relationship: we were either best friends or fighting like siblings. One winter day, after a fight, my uncle told us to play on opposite sides of the house until we calmed down. So, that’s what we did.



I was building something in the snow behind my grandparents' house, near my grandfather’s old work shed, when I saw movement between some of my grandmother’s neglected fruit trees a few feet away. I was convinced it was an animal and, since there weren't many dangerous animals in that area, I decided to check it out to entertain myself. As I fought through the overgrown grass and snow, I was shocked to see a woman around my mother's age. She was wearing old-fashioned summer clothes with a long braided ponytail, despite it being winter. I stared at her for a few seconds before trying to speak.



"Hey. Who are you?" I called out. No reaction. I repeated myself at least twice more, but she didn’t respond. First, I was frustrated and confused. Then, since it looked like she was trying to steal the (frozen) fruit from my grandmother’s trees, I got a bit angry and shouted again. Still, no reaction. Finally, I took a step forward, and as my footsteps crunched in the snow, she turned around and looked at me.



Her face was almost blurred out, like an old polaroid photo taken by someone moving, so the facial features were wiped away. She dropped whatever she was holding and jumped down from the branch she was standing on, rolling over and disappearing into the snow behind the trees on the opposite side from where I stood. Instinctively, I ran after her toward the hole she left behind, crashing into a mix of grass, ice, and snow. There were no traces of her. I shook the snow off my hat and walked back, noticing that whatever she had dropped was gone too. It was as if she had vanished into thin air.



I didn’t tell anyone about it. We had more important things to deal with, and not everyone was as open-minded as I was at the time. During another visit that same winter, I saw her again, but under very different circumstances. I was visiting my grandmother with my parents and sister shortly before she passed away. At some point, I needed to get out and do something because I got bored easily back then.



I found a blue short trick ski lying in the snow. It wasn’t mine, but maybe something my cousin had left behind. I put it on my boot and, after testing it, decided it would be cool to create some jumps and obstacles in the snow. So, I did. I ripped up frozen grass and brushed away frozen weeds to create a short obstacle hill towards the entrance of the woods behind my grandparents' house. I made a few jumps and swings, trying to improve with every attempt. At some point, I felt like I was being watched, like someone was spying on me. I became more and more obsessed with it, looking around more than actually skiing. Eventually, I tried a 180 with the short trick ski, miscalculated, and fell. I didn’t hurt myself, but as I sat up, I saw her again—the woman from before, wearing the same summer clothes. She stood behind a tree near my grandfather’s old work shed, staring straight at me.



This time, I could see her clearly. Her face wasn’t blurred like last time, but the distance made it hard to memorize her features. She was posed as if she genuinely believed I couldn’t see her, but I could. Feeling provoked by this grown woman spying on me, I yelled, “I can see you!” followed by a curse word.



No reaction. She stood there, and we had a staredown from a distance. Frustrated and creeped out, I leaned forward, staring with wide eyes to indicate that I could see her. In a split second, she seemed to disappear. I could tell she was still there, but her slight adjustment made her almost invisible. Feeling "tough" or just safe in that familiar place, I walked up and sat down at the corner of the house. I took off my jacket and the short trick ski, setting them up to look like I was still sitting there. Then, I ran as fast as I could, following the house's edge to avoid making unnecessary noise. As I turned the corner behind my grandfather’s old work shed, she wasn’t there. But there was evidence of her presence. I saw almost invisible footprints and a ripped piece of paper with writing in blue marker. The number “11” was written in the tally mark style. I had no idea what she was counting, but it felt personal somehow.



I remember talking about her with my mom and grandmother during a meal, but I’m not sure if most of that conversation actually happened or if I imagined it. I’ll end with the last time I ever interacted with her.



A few years later, my grandmother had been hospitalized and lived her last five years in a hospital. She eventually passed away. My mother and uncle handled most of the funeral arrangements. On the day of her funeral at Trøgstad Kirke, we arrived early so my mother could take care of things. By this time, I had started smoking cigarettes, though only my cousin Ronny of family knew. We took a walk for me to have a cigarette, telling the others we needed to clear our heads.



We walked a short distance from the church and found a spot where I felt safe. I had two cigarettes with me (one broken), a lighter, and gum in my shirt pocket. We talked about anything but my grandmother out of respect, joking about our friends and dumb stuff we did. Then, as I turned to spit during a laugh, I saw her—the woman, smiling widely. She was wearing the same summer clothes, but they were black and looked horrible, as if dunked in ink or oil.



I felt a strong reaction, though I didn’t know exactly what I felt. Angry, maybe? I blew out the smoke and said to Ronny, ready to tell him everything, “You see her? You see that woman over there?”



When I turned to hear his response, I saw he was pale as a ghost, almost in tears. I had never seen him like that. Confused, I asked what was wrong, ready to share my experiences with her. Then, he told me a chilling story.



A few weekends earlier, Ronny and his father, my uncle Tommy, were at my grandmother’s house looking for some papers. Ronny had purposely left one door unlocked, planning to have a party there unsupervised. It ended up being just him and a friend playing PlayStation and drinking beers. As it got dark, they saw the woman throwing small rocks and cones at a window. At first, they weren’t scared. Buzzed, they went out on the porch and asked what she was doing. She rambled something about a punishment and mockingly asked if he was ready. Creeped out by her smile and tone, they dismissed her. They went back inside, but later saw flickering lights and smelled smoke. They found a large burning cross with two bars in the front yard, the woman standing nearby, singing something in another language, with understandable words like "punishment," "wait," and "due time."



Terrified, they threatened to call the cops, but she laughed and said, “It can only get worse.” The cross continued to burn, with noises coming from all around the house, but she never broke in. After hours, everything stopped when the cross burned out. The next morning, the cross was gone, but a large black circle of burned grass remained. On the front door was a note, stuck with chewed gum, with the number “22” written in tally marks.



Finishing his story, Ronny sounded smaller and weaker than I’d ever seen him. I was a mix of terrified, confused, and angry. As the woman seemed to walk toward us, I took a deep breath and clenched my fists, ready to confront her. Ronny put a hand on my chest to stop me, and she disappeared into thin air. When we realized she was gone, the area filled with calmness. Ronny collapsed next to the building, hyperventilating, and I sat on the ground. I lit the broken cigarette to calm my nerves. We sat in silence for about ten minutes before Ronny said we better go back. He helped me up, and we patted each other on the back as we walked back to the church.



We never spoke about it again.



If there's interest, I’ll continue my story with a few experiences from my hometown.
