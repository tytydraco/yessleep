One good thing that came out of me getting possessed is that the number of infected deer has gone down drastically since we told the Department of Wildlife about Reyna’s hawthorn berry discovery. 

Unfortunately, one of their employees didn't listen to us when we strongly advised them to ask before taking the berries. His head was mounted on one of the branches, the fruits that he had stolen stuffed  his empty eye sockets. No one has been able to find the rest of him.

Suffice to say, it was a mistake that only had to be made once. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

As far as my well-being goes, I’m as alright as I can be, which means that I am paranoid that every itch or twitch could be a residual worm. I pressured Reyna into giving me every little detail about what had happened while I was taken over, and I partially regret it. At the risk of sounding like a wimp… *gross.* But I needed to know. 

The only thing that I remember from the white stag’s tenancy is being six years old and lost in the woods again, following a trail of maggot-covered treats. This time, the owner of the gingerbread house didn't look like a licorice-haired version of my grandma. It appeared more like the waxy, skeletal thing my mother had described. Its voice scratched at my ears like sandpaper as it sang its horrible song to me. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop following it. 

My legs moved on their own, taking me closer, *closer* to that gingerbread house even though all I wanted to do was run back to Grandma's garden. The sound of flies buzzing merged with a cacophony of screams coming from inside the cookie walls. The surrounding forest was filled with an audience of white deer, all watching eagerly, drooling hungrily as the owner of the gingerbread house guided me to its awaiting oven. 

Before I could walk through the door, a purple dragonfly the size of my hand landed on my shoulder. It tauntingly whispered, “If you don't wake up now, you'll forget how to.”

That was when I opened my eyes to see Iolo dragging the white stag by the antlers. Yinz know the rest, after that. 

The absolute angels that I call coworkers helped clean up the mess that the white stag and my least favorite psychopomp left behind. There was a part of me that was glad that the Weeper offered to stay by my side; between the possession and knowing that I now owe the mechanic a life debt, I didn't want to be alone. 

Speaking of, life debts with Neighbors are insanely tricky to get out of. According to our records, the life debt gets resolved when the *indebtor* believes that it has been fulfilled. It's entirely subjective. It could mean I serve the rest of what would've been my entire lifespan as one of the Hunt's hounds. Or it could mean that the mechanic could simply take my life whenever he felt like it. Technically, he had only promised not to take my soul in our previous deal. 

In summary, I'm in deep shit. 

After everything was settled down, the first thing I did was call my mom. Just hearing her voice comforted me. I didn't have the mental energy to get into detail about what I'd just been through, so I just asked if I could visit her over the weekend. She perked up, saying that she was coincidentally going to be making one of my favorite childhood meals that evening: chicken and dumplings. 

I also asked if I could bring a friend. 

Of course, Mom was Mom about it and playfully asked, “So is this a ‘friend' or a ‘*friend?*”

I will never know peace. 

And *no,* inmates, the mechanic is not the one I invited. God, could you imagine trying to bring a Huntsman home to your mom? ‘Hi, this is my boyfriend! His hobbies include hunting people for sport and flaying his victims alive, but he's got a great personality!’

The Weeper looked surprised when I invited her, but agreed to go with me. I thought she'd appreciate a glimpse at a life that's (mostly) separate from Orion. Besides, my mother's cooking was the least she deserved after finding another hagstone for me. 

On another note, the Weeper has begun to look more… I don't want to say human. Maybe more comfortable, is the best way to put it. For starters, she's been braiding her hair. Her gray eyes are still always rimmed in red, but they haven't been looking nearly as irritated as they had in the past. All in all, the canteen trick seems to have been good to her. 

On the drive there, it occurred to me that I can't just keep calling her ‘the Weeper,’ especially in front of my mom. Even though I know she's kinder than certain other Neighbors, I was still careful about how I phrased the question. 

“So, it's a human custom to introduce yourself,” I started. “As such, my mother will probably want to have a name to refer to you, but it doesn't have to be *your* name, you know?”

The Weeper was quiet. I worried that I'd offended her until she eventually said, “You may call me Deirdre.”

In turn, she asked me, “What may I call you, lady of Orion?”

Lady of Orion? Is that what she's been calling me? It's so… noble, like I'm a knight instead of some nutjob that runs around with a shotgun and a fire poker. At least it’s not nearly as demeaning as ‘puppydog.’

I decided to give her the nickname I use for this series. She's been calling me ‘Nessa’ ever since. 

When Mom first laid eyes on Deirdre, I think she could tell from the get-go that she wasn't human. Despite that, she greeted the Weeper politely as she warmly invited her in. She did seem to relax a bit when Deirdre introduced herself without asking for my mother's name in return. 

Mom had taken over Grandma's house after she passed away. In honor of her, Mom had kept the garden going. From the looks of things, Grandma's ‘friends from the garden’ never left. Even though my mom previously hadn't even been able to keep a succulent alive, everything appeared to be thriving just as it had during my childhood. Knowing Mom, she put out cream for them, just like how Grandma taught us. 

Sensing that Mom wanted to speak to me alone, Deirdre excused herself to explore the garden. 

Once she was out of earshot, Mom whispered, “She's very pretty. Or should I say… *fair?*”

She raised her eyebrows pointedly at that final word, wanting to make sure that I caught her meaning. 

“She is one of the Neighbors of the Hills, but one of the kind ones.” I explained. “You remember the mechanic I told you about? She helped me with him.”

Mom still looked doubtful. She'd heard too many stories about the Neighbors and their tricks. Her own negative experiences definitely didn't help either. 

“Is the mechanic why you sounded like something was wrong on the phone?” Mom asked gently. 

Instantly, I broke down, spilling everything about the white stag, the possession, *everything.* She held me like I was a little kid again, comforting me as I told her yet again about how she'd almost lost me. 

“I knew you shouldn't have taken that job.” She muttered. “It's like the military all over again…”

Please don't begrudge her for saying these things. She was just worried. I've put her through a lot over the years. I know that when I was on active duty in Afghanistan, she'd been terrified of receiving *that call* that meant she'd have to bury her only daughter. I think that when I took this job, that fear came back in full force. 

“These things are everywhere, Mom.” I reasoned. “One of them would have found me again eventually.”

I didn't have to mention the gingerbread house. She already knew that's what I was referring to. 

I straightened up out of her arms, but held both of her hands, “There's no way I can quit now. I can't just pretend like these things don't exist and that they don’t hurt people. You taught me better than that.”

She was still worried, but I could see a glimmer of pride in her as she said, “You always *did* take after your grandmother. For better *and* for worse.”

“And you, Mom. Don't forget you.”

We hugged again. Deirdre returned then, a small smile on her face as she walked in. The late afternoon sun shone behind her, making her look even more ethereal. 

“I hope I’m not interrupting.” She said softly. 

As Mom was preparing dinner, I got up the nerve to ask about my grandfather. About how nobody ever really talked about him. Mom’s knife paused over the chicken breast she was cutting. 

“You know what's strange?” She said. “I don't remember much about him either.”

“Was he around? Or did he, you know… leave?” I questioned. 

“No, he was around. At least… I think he was.” She went back to the chicken, going silent for a moment before adding, “Actually, I kept a lot of Grandma's things stored in the attic. I know I should go through it someday, but I just don't have the heart to. Why don't you look and see if you can find anything?”

Deirdre and I looked at each other, her silently asking if it was alright if she assisted. Mom reluctantly said that she could join me. It's probably going to take a while for her to get used to the Weeper’s presence. 

The attic, like most, was a cluttered mess. Old furniture was covered in boxes stacked on top of each other. I spotted a Victorian loveseat and wondered how long it had been there. Judging by the dust, quite a long time. As an aside, I wonder if Mom would let me take it someday. Something like that deserves better than to be left to rot in an attic. 

With a sigh, I tried to figure out where to start. Maybe there was a photo album somewhere? Letters? A journal? Did Grandma journal? I thought she did. I always saw her writing things down in a notebook, but maybe that was her recipe book that I was thinking of.

A stack of flowery hat boxes caught my eye. I shrugged helplessly at Deirdre, “Gotta start somewhere, right?”

We dug through box after box. In the first few, there were envelopes full of pictures, but only of Mom and I. It was strange to see all of my phases at once, and slightly embarrassing given that Deirdre was looking through them as well. 

She held up a picture of twelve-year-old me sporting knee high Converse, smeared eyeliner, and a scowl that I'd thought made me look badass at the time. The picture was made even more ridiculous by my mother beaming as if the grouchy gremlin beside her was something to be proud of, “Is this you?”

*I need to burn that as soon as possible.*

“Unfortunately.” I reluctantly replied. 

Yeah… middle school was not good to me. 

After far too many more Young Nessa jumpscares and Deirdre occasionally noting how I look just like my mom when she was my age, we got to the final hat box. The pictures in there were clearly taken with an older camera with how faded they were. 

Grandma had been young in those photos, most likely in her mid twenties. This box was where we started to find oddities. In one of the photos, she and my mom, who looked to be about six, were posing in front of the ocean. While Mom was grinning by her lopsided sandcastle, Grandma had her arms awkwardly out to the side as if she was leaning on someone. 

Another picture that caught my eye was one of her in the hospital, smiling at nothing while holding my newborn mother. There was another where the baby appeared to be *levitating*, the blanket distorted by imprints in the material as if unseen hands were supporting her. 

Strangest of all were Grandma's wedding photos. She held her hands forwards, happy tears streaking her cheeks as their officiant smiled down at his bible. 

There was no groom. 

Deidre and I stared at the wedding photo for a long, *long* time. 

I *did* have a grandpa. But he was… *erased,* somehow. Something made it like he'd never existed, or tried its best to do that. Despite the heat in the attic, my hair was standing on end as it dawned on me what had happened. 

“Something took his name.” I breathed, wondering if Deirdre could confirm it. “It took his name, and then it took *him.* Didn't it?”

With a heavy sigh, Deirdre grimly uttered, “He must have made somebody *very* angry.”

What must that have been like for Grandma? To completely forget about the man she married and had a daughter with? No wonder she hid these away. It must've been painful to not even have a photo to remember him by. I wonder if it was sudden, like she woke up one morning with barely any recollection of the man she loved beyond the sense that she'd lost something. Or maybe it had been gradual; first forgetting small things until the memory loss eventually progressed to the point where she couldn't even remember what he looked like. 

I couldn't decide which scenario would be worse to live through.

Mom's voice was muffled as she called, “Yinz better get down here! It's just about done!”

With a shudder, I held the old photos and steeled myself to tell my mother that she had been forced to forget her own father. 

She knew instantly that something was wrong when Deirdre and I entered the room. “You found something?”

I hesitated, not quite knowing the best way to say it, “Unfortunately.”

When I showed her the pictures, she didn't understand at first, not processing the severity of it. But once it hit her, she had to sit down. I hugged her around the shoulders. Mom, understandably, was in complete shock, staring intensely down at the wedding photo as if willing Grandpa to take his rightful place in that picture. 

“How…? How could I have never known about this?” She whispered. 

“Grandma forgot, too.” I answered delicately. “It might've been too painful for her to talk about it, especially since she couldn't remember anything about him either.”

“Or whoever did it forbade her from speaking on it.” Deirdre muttered. 

My mother finally tore her gaze from the photo to meet Deirdre’s eyes, “May I ask if you're familiar with… the Neighbor that is responsible?”

Deirdre sadly shook her head, “I’m afraid I don't.”

Dinner was solemn, at first, but then Mom found a way to lighten the mood. She reminisced about growing up there. About Grandma. About watching me run through the garden without a care in the world. About how it always felt so safe and loving there, even when the world felt like it was going to end the next day.  

With only some strange pictures to clue us in, there's no way to tell what my grandfather's fate was. If he was lucky, he was dead, but more likely, whatever took him wouldn't offer him that mercy, even all of these years later. It's entirely possible that he is still out there somewhere in some horrific, unrecognizable form. 

At one point, I got up to get a bottle of wine out of the garage. When I came back, I overheard my mother telling Deirdre that she appreciated her help in keeping me safe. Well… as safe as an Orion employee can be, anyway. 

Before I left, she jokingly whispered, “Hopefully next time you visit, it won't be as friends. I'd like grandkids someday. Even if it is a changeling, I'll still love it.”

Mortified, I glanced over to make sure Deirdre wasn't looking and hissed, “*You're so embarrassing!*”

In other words, Mom is in jail with the rest of you hooligans.

Mom also encouraged me to take the wedding photo with me. Understandably, I think it made her uncomfortable. I put it in the visor of the Jeep so that it wouldn't get bent up during the journey home. 

Once we were on the road, Deidre commented, “It appears that tragedy follows the women in your family.”

No kidding. Between Grandpa being taken and my sperm donor being a horrible person, it makes me afraid to see what awaits me if I ever feel the desire to get married, especially considering the job I have. Come to think of it, maybe that's why I've never really pursued romance much throughout my life. 

On the way home, Deirdre’s voice suddenly became harsh, “Pull over.”

Concerned, I did as she said. Before I could stop the Jeep completely, she was already out the door and running towards a pond nearby. I flipped on my hazards then quickly went after her.

When she first got to the water's edge, her hands were empty. Then she reached in, pulling a light pink cardigan out, and began fussing with a blood stain. 

Careful not to touch her, I said, “I have an idea, but I'll need you to trust me.”

When Deirdre glanced back at me, she was crying, “What do you have in mind?”

“We find the person that sweater belongs to and you'll keen for them,” I explained cautiously. “Hypothetically, if you successfully can lead her to the other side, you'll have corrected any failures that you had in your mortal life.”

“I can't.” She said with a hopeless shake of her head. “The garment must be cleaned.”

I thought quickly, “Okay… Is there a time limit? If I take you back to my apartment, we could throw it in the machine.”

Her eyes went big, “You want me to use *that* thing again?”

“It worked for those construction uniforms, didn't it?”

“Well, yes, though I still am not entirely sure if I trust it.”

“Would it help if I was able to get someone to watch over it while we find its owner?” 

Deirdre went quiet, pausing her attempts to clean the cardigan, eventually uttering, “Do you truly believe that this will work, Nessa?”

I sighed, deciding it would be best to be honest with her, “I'm not sure. As far as I know, no one has tried this before. This idea is entirely based on how I've seen curses get resolved in the past. But if it's for your freedom, isn't it worth at least trying?”

Tears continued to stream from Deidre's eyes as she deliberated. She was alarmed, I could see that, as well as desperate and unsure. 

Eventually, she rose from her crouch, the wet cardigan clutched tightly in her fist. With only a nod as her answer, she hurried back to the Jeep. Thinking her urgency meant that we didn't have much time, I floored it. 

I called Reyna and told her the plan. Her initial response was, “You're calling me because you want me to watch your *laundry?*” 

Once I explained the situation, she agreed to keep an eye on the washing machine while Deidre and I searched for the cardigan’s owner. When the Weeper’s fists tightened as Reyna got close to the garment, we came to the conclusion that it would be best if Reyna didn't lay her hands on it. On that note, she also would have to make sure no one else touched it. As much as I didn't want to be *that person* that hogs the washer, this was a life or death situation. 

Like before, Deidre had a sense for who we were looking for and how they were going to die. This one was going to happen sooner than her other omens. 

Deirdre told me where to go. She was eerily quiet otherwise, her tears nonstop the entire drive. I got a cold feeling in my gut when I recognized where we were. The construction site where the False Tree made its stand. 

Thanks to Orion's efforts, we had calmed the tree down over the past couple of weeks. It took a lot of prayer and lamb meat to do it, but for the most part, we did it. I say ‘for the most part’ because it had moved on from grief-induced rage to bitterness. It would be far too easy for a human to make the wrong move and kick start its wrath again. 

Before entering the forest, I asked the False Tree for permission. A gentle, pine-scented breeze welcomed me. Deidre did a low curtsy before entering. The wind brushed a lock of hair from her face. 

As we traveled deeper into the trees, Deidre was so focused that it was hard to communicate with her. I mostly just tried to keep up with her as she darted gracefully through the overgrowth. I'd asked if the shepherd of the forest would be the one to kill this person. 

She answered cryptically, “Whether or not you leave the forest is not for a human to decide.”

I decided to take that as a ‘yes.’

The crack of a gunshot made me flinch. It was up ahead. Not too far away. 

There are a few things that could cause a person to anger a False Tree besides disrespecting their territory. For example, False Trees historically have an interesting relationship with hunters. A person’s success when seeking game was thought to be entirely determined by the False Tree's whims. As a result, the hunters would often enter into agreements with the forest guardians to ensure that they’d never return home empty handed. However, if the hunter broke the agreement or took more than what the False Tree permitted them to, the consequences were violent. 

Of course, those were back in the days where failure meant starvation. Now that we have grocery stores, bargains like that don’t appear to be nearly as commonplace. 

Another thing that could have happened and seemed to be the more likely scenario has to do with the farmers. It was thought that if a farmer’s livestock wandered into the woods, it belonged to the False Tree. Any attempts to retrieve the animal were interpreted as theft. For reference, there was a goat farm nearby as well as a cattle ranch. 

While the farmers who’ve been here for a long time know about the False Tree and its territorial nature, we’ve had newer farms springing up lately. Some of them have been learning quickly and taking the old folks’ warnings to heart, others… not so much. Those were the ones I was most worried about. 

There was a shriek so guttural that it was hard to tell if it belonged to an animal or a person. I started to run, despite knowing what this person’s fate was and knowing full well that interrupting a False Tree’s punishment would be suicidal. I don’t know what I intended to do, I just needed to get there.

There was another cry just before we found the source of the commotion. 

A black bear held a small goat by the neck between its jaws, its muzzle coated in blood. The person who’d been trying to retrieve her goat was sprawled motionlessly in the dirt, her eyes staring sightlessly at the sky, her face frozen in a look of surprise. What was left of her shredded throat reminded me of ground beef. 

To its credit, the False Tree had at least made it quick for them both.

The bear growled in a way that made my hands shake. Its eyes glowed green.

“We aren’t here to interrupt you.” I explained carefully, putting my hands behind my back to hide their tremor. “Neither of us would dream of undermining you. We are simply here to observe.”

The bear nodded once, the poor little goat’s body flopping around as it did so. To my immense relief, it then took its prize away, most likely intending to come back for the dead woman. 

Deidre gazed down at the poor woman mournfully, uttering, “I… I remember. She’s lost. I need to guide her out of the woods.”

My hagstone vibrated. It couldn’t be the False Tree. The stone didn’t react to it earlier.

I glanced around, not seeing anything at first, but all the while, Victor’s voice echoed in my mind: *‘They’re like sharks. They smell blood in the water, they circle.’*
 
“No pressure, but whatever you’re going to do, Deirdre, you better start doing it.” I said as I drew my poker. 

She began to sing. 

*“Ó, nach mór mo thrua 
duit, a stóirín?”*

Behind me. “Yoo hoo!”

‘Relief’ doesn’t seem to be the best word to describe how I felt when I heard Briar’s voice instead of the mechanic’s, but it comes the closest, though the feeling was short lived. Deirdre’s keening was interrupted as she whirled around, eyes wide to see the Hunter standing there.

“I don’t believe you have a permit for that.” He said, eyeballing Deidre as if determining the most efficient way to dissect her. 

I moved closer to her, putting her within range of the hagstone as I questioned, “A permit for what?”

Briar’s glare slid to me, speaking to me as if to a child. “The dead need a reliable guide, which is where we come in. Your traitorous friend here isn’t qualified.”

“Traitorous?” Deirdre repeated distantly. 

“We know you helped translate the ledger. And now you’re going behind our backs, trying to take a soul that isn’t yours.”

“I don’t want her soul for myself, I'm merely-” Deidre began to defend herself, but was cut off.

“Do you know where she needs to go?” Briar snapped. “Because if you pick wrong, at best, she’ll be recognized as a trespasser and one of us will be called back to figure out wherever the fuck she’s *actually* supposed to go - which neither of us will be happy about, by the way - and at worst, she’ll be tortured for eternity. You couldn’t handle that responsibility before, what makes you think that you can handle it now?”

That last dig seemed to get under her skin. 

Worried that things were going to escalate further, I admitted, “It was my idea for her to do this. If you want to be angry at someone, be angry at me.”

“When I was alive, I had shirked my duties,” Deidre said, voice pensive and quiet. “The river clouded my memories, but now that I’m here, all has become clear to me.”

She swallowed, raising her chin as she spoke up, “I do not wish to fail a second time. So now I ask you, Huntsman, what will it take for me to learn how to properly guide this one?”

Briar burst into laughter. I wanted to hit him. 

He shook his head at her, “You want me to help you?  After you’ve crossed us? You gotta be fucking delusional! If the dog of Orion wasn’t here with that damn hagstone, I’d be tearing you apart!”

*‘Dog of Orion.’ What an asshole.*

“Everybody wants something, including you.” Deidre retorted patiently. “I’ve already accepted that I’ll receive penance for my role in your superior being named. I will face it with grace. I won't run from you or try to fight back. All I ask in return is to learn.”

He blinked, his smile fading, “You really *are* delusional.”

“I know you crave blood.” She continued, keeping an impressive calmness to her voice despite the heat of his stare. “And not just the blood of humans. You have a taste for other immortals. It's gotten you in trouble before.”

His jaw tightened. She'd touched a nerve. 

What kind of trouble had he gotten into? 

Deidre picked up on it, too. She then offered, “If I allow you to taste my blood, your superiors will not know of it. It will remain our secret.”

I looked at her in bewilderment. She couldn't be considering this? And would the False Tree care if this type of deal was being made in his forest? But he knows all that happens in this forest and he wasn't intervening. Maybe as long as there was no threat to himself or his forest, he wasn't concerned. 

What was even more alarming was that Briar appeared to be considering it. Hunger had darkened his eyes. If Deidre was scared, she was hiding it well.  

He clicked his tongue, then said, “Tell you what, *caoineadh,* we’ll kill two birds with one stone. For your participation in translating the ledger, you'll feel my thorns. However, if you can keep from screaming, I'll gladly show you the ropes on guiding the dead. Depending on how well you do, I might even be nice.”

“Hold on,” I suddenly spoke up, both of them turning their attention to me. “If this is going to happen, there need to be some conditions.”

Briar snorted, “What? Are you her lawyer, now?”

“Please hear me out.” I said, trying to keep my tone even. “There needs to be a time limit. You also can't kill her. And she gets to pick where on her body the thorns go, and they will not stray beyond that region for the duration of this transaction. This will also be a one-time thing. Your teaching will begin immediately after the transaction has been completed.”

I felt Deidre’s eyes on me the entire time I spoke. 

Briar thoughtfully pursed his lips, “One minute will be plenty of time, and fine, I won't kill her. And what *exactly* do you think I’m going to do? Some Evil Dead shit?”

Reyna wouldn't say what she saw when she'd looked back after he captured that poor man from the construction crew. Just hearing the sound of flesh tearing was bad enough. 

“So then you have no problem with me picking where the thorns go?” Deidre challenged. 

“Not at all.” He replied, crossing his arms. “Any other bullshit conditions you wanna discuss or can we get this started? The dead girl is waiting.”

“After we're done here, I want to be able to carry out my duties as a keening woman. I don't want to run from my responsibilities anymore.”

He clicked his tongue again, “*That* I don't have the authority to promise. You'll have to take that one up with the captain, especially if you want to operate in this area.”

So psychopomps need permits? I don't know why I was surprised to learn that the Neighbors have bureaucracy, but even now, I'm a bit astonished. Then again, they do enjoy making things as complicated as possible, and they sure do love their rules, so I suppose it makes sense. 

Briar impatiently asked, “So, are we doing this or not?”

Deidre took a deep breath, then raised her left arm, “Do it on my left forearm. Nowhere above the elbow or below the wrist.”

He simply said, “Yeah. Sure.”

I pulled out my phone as I announced. “I'll be timing this. One minute, not a second over.”

He rolled his eyes. “Fine! Wonderful! Can we hurry this along?”

She stepped away from me, head held high as she prepared to let this scumbag tear her arm up. I waited, my breath quickening, fully prepared to get her back under the protection of the hagstone if he tried anything funny. 

The black, thorny vines rose ominously from the ground, like cobras preparing to strike. Some looked to be as thick as snakes, others weren't any wider than a shoelace. I swallowed as I watched them drift closer to her skin, hovering as if savoring the moment. Deidre didn't move, not showing any signs of anxiety about her situation. 

“Start the timer.” Was all Briar said before
they all coiled around her forearm at once, tightening to form a massive, writhing cuff of thorns. Deirdre shuddered as she grit her teeth. She somehow managed to remain silent, even as the vines quickly became soaked in her blood. 

I covered my mouth in shock. I’ll admit that it was hard to watch, but I wouldn't look away. She didn't have to deal with this alone. 

I removed my palm to whisper, “You can do this. You're strong.”

I don't know if she heard me. The thorns twitched, creating new slices in her pale skin. 

Meanwhile, Briar watched intently, seemingly entranced as his thorns collected every drop of blood they could draw from her. It had only been ten seconds. How could time be moving so slowly?

I saw Deidre's fingers flex, probably in reflex as the vines held her tighter. She winced, but once again, managed not to cry out. 

She met my eyes. I held her gaze, wanting her to know that I believed in her, that she could withstand this. Once this was over, she would be free from any more severe repercussions from the Wild Hunt, and hopefully, also the river. Afterwards, she told me that's what she had been holding on to get through the pain. 

Thirty seconds. I urged her, “You’re halfway there. You got this!” 

“So quiet.” Briar said under his breath. “And so much misery.”

I grimaced when I caught a glimpse of that forked tongue again as it traced his lower lip ravenously. *God,* creepy fucker. 

Forty five seconds. Almost there. Just a little longer, Deidre. 

There was triumph in her pale eyes and the curve of her lips as the timer I’d set went off. Instantly, the thorns released her, revealing that nearly every inch of her skin was covered in numerous cuts of varying depth. Later on, I'd have to pull some thorns that had gotten stuck out with tweezers. 

Despite her injuries, Deidre was smiling. 

On the other hand, Briar shook his head, looking distant, almost as if he was high, “Christ.”

What did her blood do to him?

He shook his head again, eyes glassy as he beckoned to her with a finger, “Alright. Let’s get going.”

Deidre told me that she’d meet me at my apartment afterwards. Even though I was reluctant to leave her alone with him, she assured me that it would be fine. A deal was a deal, after all. 

Truthfully, I was worried we’d underestimated him. I relieved Reyna of laundry duty, but she insisted on hanging around in case something went wrong.

When Deidre came back to collect the washed cardigan and to get her arm taken care of, she informed me that Briar didn't make any effort to exploit any loopholes. I don't believe that it was because Briar was kinder or more fair, I think it just simply didn't occur to him to try. In hindsight, he would've been able to tear her arm off, if the thought had struck him. 

If we'd encountered Iolo instead of him, I think things would've turned out much differently. I guess that is what makes the difference between a captain of the Wild Hunt and a regular Hunter. 

While Reyna and I worked together to remove loose thorns, clean, and bandage her forearm, I asked, “Did your blood… do something to him?”

She smirked. “It did. He felt my sorrow as strongly as if it were his own.”

“Did you know that would happen?”

Her smirk grew. “I might have.” 

“How long will it last?”

She shrugged, “Who’s to say?”

Reyna then summed up my thoughts eloquently, “That was a girlboss move, not gonna lie.” 

It turns out, between the two, Deidre is the one to beware of when it comes to loopholes. May the blood-induced depression haunt him for millenia. 

Once we were done tending to her injuries, we had one last experiment to do. Deidre was afraid of this one, possibly even more so than letting a Hunter consume her blood. 

She closed her eyes, raising her canteen above her head, then let it drop dramatically to the floor. She backed away from it, still not opening her eyes. Once she got halfway down the hall, she winced. 

I was heart-broken. “I’m sorry. I thought it would work.”

She shook her head. “No. It did. The pull was much weaker than it used to be. I… I believe it's just going to take more than escorting one person before I’m fully free.”

So now we have a new psychopomp. Thankfully, this one is gentle and kind. Good thing, too. We could use some more of that around here. She just needs her permit. 

Edit: It has come to my attention that it is not a literal permit like a driver's license, which is extremely disappointing. I might make her one as a joke.
