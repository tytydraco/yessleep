We all know how werewolves only transform during the full moon, vampires can't enter your house without permission, and skinwalkers try to trick you into letting them in.

Last night, I met a different kind of monster.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

My name is Lionel Iris, and I am a private detective for all things supernatural and bizarre.

I'm here to teach you about the nature golem.

I got a call last morning that a child went missing from his house in a small secluded town in North America. There were no signs of a break in, and all the doors and windows were still locked from the inside, since it couldn't be explained logically, they called me in.

"We thought it may be a vampire or a skin walker that the kid let in, but that doesn't explain all the locked doors and windows." The police officer explains as I inspected the house.

"Any witness accounts?"

"The neighbors report having heard a scream from inside the house." The officer responds, following my gaze to various objects. I can tell he's a sceptic, trying to defraud me as they would say.

"Have you pinpointed the location of the scream inside the house?"

"Yeah, its upstairs, follow me."

We walk up the stairs, and I notice some dirt on them. "You walk with dirty shoes around the house?" I ask the mother, pointing with my finger. Her eyes widen and she shakes her head. I kneel over and pick up the dirt with my fingers, it's moss. "There a forest nearby?"

"Yes, a couple miles out west." The officer says as he points to a white door, I notice some more dirt on the door handle. "This is the bathroom, we believe the scream came from here."

I try the handle. "It's locked?" I question. The officer rubs his neck "We have been unable to unlock the door." I look at him with disappointment. "And how can you be sure the kid isn't in there?"

Before he can answer I put my leg up and kick the door down with one loud thud. "Woah" Is all the officer can say. He looks to be in his 20's probably a fresh recruit.

I inspect the inside of the bathroom, there's an entire pile of the mossy forest dirt. The window appears to be locked. "We have a nature golem on our hands" I say matterofactly.

"I'm afraid your boy is beyond recovery if he has already been taken back to the forest, but I will go in pursuit, can't let this thing run lose if it started visiting homes." The mother drops her head down and begins sobbing into her hands.

"Hey!" The officer runs after me as I walk back down the stairs. "You don't need to crush her spirit like that when we know nothing!"

"The nature golem is something out of your nightmares, boy." Taking his silence as a request to continue, I do so. "It's a protector of the forest, its unusual for it to do home visits like that, which means one of two things, either the kid did something horrible to piss it off so much, or its answering to something above nature itself."

I walk out of the house and walk to my car parked across from it.

"Take me with you!" The officer keeps following.

"What's your name kid?" To which he responds "Paul, sir."

I sigh. "Hop in."

We begin driving to the outskirts of the forest. "But I don't understand how it took the boy out of the house while leaving all the doors locked from the inside?"

"The nature golem is a creature that lurks in the woods, you can think of it as a dirt golem that can change its shape, soften and harden itself and even detach parts of itself if necessary, doing so allows it to lock the doors from the inside." And sensing his next question coming my way I continue. "Yes, it can also theoretically change itself into a shape of a key, which is why every door is still locked, it didn't want to be discovered."

"So the boy opened the door to the forest golem? But wouldn't the appearance scare the boy?" Paul sounds somewhat amazed, but still skeptical.

"Precicely, which is why he was taken from the bathroom, the kid ran and hid."

"What happens in the forest?" Paul asks after a long moment of silence.

"The boy will be buried alive, so if that hasn't happened yet, which is extremely unlikely, we still might be able to rescue him."

We finally get to the forest and get out of the car. "How do you plan on tracking the thing down?"

"I don't, it'll come to me." I smile at the officer. He looks at me, searching for answers, but I don't let on. "Grab the shovel from the trunk, and follow me." I instruct him.

We walk deeper into the woods, nightfall is coming and it's getting dark. I pull out my flashlight, and the officer does the same.

The forest is eerily quiet, which means the boy is no longer above ground. Each time the nature golem buries someone, the forest goes dead silent. You might be thinking whats the whole deal of the nature golem wanting to bury people alive? Well, they're more nutritious for the forest when alive. You can think of it as mother nature taking revenge on the humans for all the polution we've caused.

We get to a small clearing in the forest and I turn to the officer. "We're here." He looks around, and before he turns back around, I smack him with my flashlight, knocking him out, the shovel he was holding drops on the ground with a thud.

I begin digging a shallow grave no deeper than one feet, and then shove his unconscious body into the small trench.

I hide in one of the bushes and listen. Meal time should be over about now. I begin hearing a couple birds chirping, crickets singing, the tree leaves begin swaying in the wind. Then, something begins manifesting itself right infront of where the officer is laying, the dirt comes together into a vague shape of a person.

After it's form is complete, it takes one good look at the officer, and starts gathering various roots nearby to connect with the body.

"That won't work." I announce myself, lunging at the nature golem with a simple homemade fire weapon, a lighter and deodorant. I push the cap down on the deodorant and light my lighter, the nature golem catches up in flames, it lets out a loud screech as the whole forest cries in sorrow.

I continue lighting him up in flames until all the dirt is scorched black, and the shape falls apart.

"What the fuck?" The officer is up and pointing his gun at me. "Hands up!"

"Calm down kid, I told you it'll come to me, I needed bait."

"Screw your bait! Hands behind your head." I sigh and follow his command. Just then a loud howl sounds in the forest. "Werewolve." I whisper under my breath. "What was that?" He shouts at me. "If you don't want to die, you'll follow me." I tell him and begin walking off.

"Hey! Hands up! Hey are you listening! I'm gonna shoot!" A shot rings out and I stop in my tracks. "That was a warning shot! One more step and the next one is going between your eyes!"

I turn around and can see a dark shadowy shape running around the clearing. "Your grave." I tell him and enter the dense woods. Moments later, more gunshots ring out, then bloodcurdling screams. I smile to myself. "Enjoy your meal."

I get back to my car and hop in, turning on the heater and taking out my vape. I wait there for a good fifteen minutes, then the passenger side door opens. "Let me know if the nature golem returns, I'll handle it." I say, blowing out the smoke.

"Sure thing." Paul says, just this time, its a friend of mine, a changeling.

"Who do you think it is?" Paul asks, also taking a drag of his cigarette.

"Only time will tell." I respond, starting up the car.

**I have a mystery to solve.**
