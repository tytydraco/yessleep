It’s the middle of the year and it’s around this time that my youth group would have what we call a “retreat”; it’s basically like church camp (but for catholics) where you all would gather around and listen to bible studies and share what you’ve learned with each other along with other activities.
The church was old, I mean very old. It has been around since the Spanish colonization and they haven’t really renovated it that much. But it’s pretty big and there is a room with a ton of bunk beds where the choir would usually sleep if a mass was held at an ungodly hour of the day.
And is where me and the rest of my fellow church members would spend the rest of the week.

Nothing really happened to us in the past 3 days—it had been fun to say the least, we played music, did the rosary every afternoon, go to confession, ate, and did a whole lot of other stuff.
But it was on the 4th day when I had fallen ill—it was probably because I kept on skipping meals but the state of my body didn’t allow me to join any more of the activities, so I was advised by the youth leader to rest and stay at the back room where the bunk beds were. I was pretty upset of course, I had never miss a single activity and It didn’t help that I had fomo so I had no other choice but to stay put.
It was already 2am and I was awoken to the sound of praying. I was confused at first, and in my tired and exhausted state I shrugged it off and told myself that it was probably just one of my church mates that came to the room early—though, it’s quite odd for them to be doing the rosaey at this hour so I just left it at that and went back to sleep.

During breakfast after everyone was finished talking about how much fun they had last night that obviously annoyed me a little because I had to miss out on all the fun, I asked if someone went back early to the room and did the rosary while I slept—they all looked at me like I was telling a joke before they all looked at each other and let out a loud and obnoxious “huh?”. 
I stopped talking after that, they never gave me a clear answer anyway.

During the evening, I was alone yet again in the room as the others finished off the last set of activities outside. I scrolled on my phone until I dozed off to the sound of the old clock ticking and their muffled voices echoing in the halls.
That is, when I woke up once again to the sound of praying, only this time it was louder and sounded like it was coming from the bunk bed that was next to mine. The others weren’t back yet, of course these activities lasted until 4 in the morning and it had just turned 3.
Feeling tired and annoyed, I turned to check where the noise was coming from after rubbing my eyes a few times and trying to grasp the situation I was currently in—I finally caught a glimpse of what or who had been praying this whole time. Infront of me, was a nun with her back turned. 
I was startled and extremely perplexed by what I was seeing. I wanted to ask what she was doing and why she was there, and I figured that it was unusual for a nun to be in here since their covenant was 5 blocks away from the church.

I remember telling myself “fuck” and hiding under the covers as she continued to pray beside me hoping that she didn’t hear anything. I tried to pay attention to what she praying and recognized it instantly. 
“Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc, et in hora mortis nostrae” it was the hail mary prayer in latin. Terrified, I took it to myself to start praying since we were taught by the ministers to pray the most powerful prayer that we could think of to ward off any evil spirits that were near.
I closed my eyes, did the sign of the cross, and in a shaking voice—prayed the our father prayer in latin over and over. It was when I was deep in prayer that I realized there was another voice speaking and it was reciting the same prayer I was saying.
Slowly, I lifted up the covers and there was the nun I saw hovering over me with a twisted grin mimicking my prayer as if it was taunting my agony. Its soulless black eyes met mine—she did not have an ounce of holiness to her. 

It went on for a few minutes until I finally forced myself to close my eyes and wait for the others to arrive, I prayed silently for it to pass until I finally heard the light switching on and gleeful voices finally filled the room. My church mates were finally there, changing into their pajamas and exchanging their farewells as we were already leaving the next day.

I never went back to church after that.
