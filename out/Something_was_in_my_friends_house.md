Me and my friend were staying over at my friends Lanas house. It was around 8pm when her parents left. We decided to make a pizza since we had previously bought all the ingredients. When we walked into the kitchen we noticed a note on the table which Lana picked up and read out loud: “ A few rules while were away! :) 1. Dont go in our room. 2. Dont trash the house. 3. Do NOT under any circumstances let anyone in or even answer the door if anyone rings. Especially after 10pm. 4. DONT stay up past 10pm. 5. Dont answer any calls past 10 pm. 6. Dont make any calls past 10 pm. Please dont break the rules….have fun! “. “ Thats odd. My parents never give me rules. But i mean these do make sense.” Lana said as she shrugged. Her parents aren’t strict so the rules seemed very easy to follow. 

As we were baking pizza Jade ( my other friend ) said something that freaked me out. “ Hey did you guys hear that? “ she asked in a nervous tone. “ pfft we aren’t five. Stop trying to scare us. “ Lana said. She was a really brave person and didn’t get scared easily. I was the complete opposite. I get scared even by the slightest sounds. “ Lets go check around the apartment, “ i said, taking my phone and turning on the flashlight. “ Nah im going to continue kneading the dough. “ Lana replied. “ Ill go. “ Jade said and also took her phone. 

We looked in every room except for her parents room but didn’t find anything. Both of us had forgotten the first rule. Lanas parents room was dark and cold. “ You go first, “ Jade said,nudging me. “ No, no way! “ I argued back. “ Fine then were not checking. “ Jade said. “ Fine, “ i replied.

We returned to the kitchen were Lana had already rolled the dough. “ Nothing “ Jade said with relief. “ I told you “ Lana said and laughed a bit. 

9:23. Were in Lanas room watching a movie. “ Yeah im not going to bed at 10pm “ Jade said and i nodded. “ Guys do you want to go get something to eat? i asked and Lana nodded. “ I will be right back! “ Lana said as she got up and left the room. I was ready to get back in the comfortable position i was just sitting in when i noticed how Jade was staring at the door. “What?” I asked. “ Nothing i just swear i saw something. “ She replied. “ Well obviously. Lana just left the room. “ i tried to remain calm. “ No i….never mind. “ she said.

10:49. Still watching the movie. We already broke the 3rd rule. Then we heard the doorbell ring. All three of us froze. “ Lets not answer. “ Jade said. “ Wait what if my parents ordered us something?” Lana said, while getting up. I quickly grabbed her arm and pulled her back onto the bed. “ its past 10pm. “ i said. She didnt respond. “ Wait ill call my parents. “ She said and i had to tell her off again. “ ITS PAST 10pm! “ i whisper-shouted. She sat back down unamused. “ Ill be right back. “ she said and got up again.

When she returned she looked super pale and scared. “ Whats wrong? “ Jade asked. Lana didnt respond. She just looked at us with fear in her eyes. “ LA- “ i started but she quickly covered my mouth with her hand. “ Shut up. “ she whispered and motioned towards the blanket. “ grab the blanket, get under the bed and under the blanket. “ i felt tears in my eyes. I was so scared. But we did as we were told. Lana put our school bags infront of the bed ( so nobody could see whats under the bed. ) and also got under. 

10:56. We sat there for 5 minutes before getting out. “ I did call my parents but what i heard was not them. It sounded like an old man growling. Then i saw a light, almost like a flashlight, shining from the kitchen. “ Lana said with a shaky breath. At this point i was crying. All of us were. “ Lets sleep under the bed. Just in case. “ Jade said and we all agreed. It sounded like the safest option. 

The next morning her parents were already home. “ Goodmorning! How did you guys sleep? “ Lanas mom asked. “ What the fuck mom? Who the fuck was that on the phone? “ She asked. “ Who? “ Her dad asked. Lana was about to burst into tears. “ THE OLD MAN! “ She yelled in desperation. Silance. “ Sweetheart i dont know what your talking about…” Her mom looked genuinely confused.  “ I broke the rules okay? When i called you guys some old man answered and growled at me. “ “ What rules? “
