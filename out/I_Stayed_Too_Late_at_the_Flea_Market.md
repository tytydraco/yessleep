I stayed too late at the flea market and now I know why they close at 3PM.

I’ve always loved flea markets. There’s something about them. Things left behind, forgotten, repurposed. That’s why I was thrilled when I moved to Ashbrook and heard about Cooper’s Market. It sat just outside town, tucked against a stretch of dense forest. It was open Tuesday to Sunday, from dawn until 3 PM, without exception.

I assumed the closing hours were caused by a city ordinance, or just something people had always done? But the more I asked, the more people avoided answering.

Vendors packed up quickly, customers left without lingering, and by 3:05, the place was abandoned, as if it had never been there at all.

The market was just down the road from my house. I’d been a few times, usually in the mornings, but I’d never stayed until closing.

I wanted to know why they closed so early.

Now I do.

March 25th, 2:50 PM

The air changed as closing time approached. Vendors stopped humoring browsers, shifting their attention to breaking down their stalls. No one told stragglers to leave, but the message was clear.

I lingered at an antique stall, pretending to examine a set of brass keys. The woman behind the table—thin, weathered—watched me with an unreadable expression. She was wrapping small porcelain dolls in tissue paper, her hands moving fast.

“Hey, how’s it going?” I asked, trying to sound casual.

She barely glanced up from the doll in her hands.

“I’m doing great, sweetie.” Her voice was kind but distant, polite in a way that felt automatic. She just kept wrapping, her fingers moving fast.

“I was just wondering, why does everyone pack up so early? Is it a city ordinance or something?”

Her hands stilled for half a second.

When she spoke again, her voice was colder. “If you’re smart, you won’t ask.” She folded the last piece of tissue paper over the doll, tucking it in tightly. “We need to leave.”

She didn’t look at me. Just kept working, the rustling of paper suddenly sharper, more hurried.

March 25th, 3:00 PM

I hid inside an old camper van near the back of the lot, crouched behind dusty furniture. Through a small window, I watched the last vendors pull out onto the road in a slow procession, dust rising behind them.

March 25th, 3:15 PM

The lot was empty.

For a long time, nothing happened. I sat still, listening to the wind move through the trees, the rustle of old tarps shifting in the breeze. The sun was still high, the air still warm.

I pulled out my iPhone, scrolling mindlessly to pass the time, occasionally glancing up to check my surroundings. Everything looked the same. Still. Normal.

I began to wonder if I’d fallen for some elaborate local prank.

Time passed. Maybe a couple hours. Maybe more. My phone had died after being on it for so long. I can’t be sure of the time exactly, but it was starting to get dark.

The footsteps came first. Soft, like someone walking barefoot through dry leaves. Then closer, deliberate. A slow, cautious approach.

I held my breath, straining to see outside the camper. Nothing. The lot was still empty, but the feeling was stronger now—like being watched through a window I couldn’t find.

At some point, the whispers began. Not words. Not exactly. Just a sound threaded through the air, somewhere between wind and speech. My name surfaced in it, over and over, stretched and pulled apart like something spoken through water.

I stayed curled behind the furniture, pressing myself into the tightest space I could find. It felt like I was there forever.

Then, through the corner of a window, I saw it.

Thin. Motionless.

At first, I thought it was a vendor who had forgotten to leave. But it was too still. The longer I looked, the more unnatural it seemed—its limbs too long, its posture too rigid, like something standing the way it thought a person should.

I didn’t move. Neither did it.

Some time later.

I ducked lower, wedging myself between an old dresser and a rusted mini-fridge. The metal was cold against my back. I told myself I could wait it out. That whatever this was, it would go.

Then it took a step. Slow. Deliberate.

Not searching. It already knew where I was.

I clenched my teeth, forcing myself to stay still. Through the thin gap beneath the camper door, I could see its feet. Long. Pale. Standing just outside.

A pause.

Then, the lightest sound—so faint I almost didn’t notice it. A slow, deliberate tapping. Not a knock. Just the bare scrape of a fingernail against the metal, testing the surface. It dragged downward, slow and careful, then lifted—only to tap again, softer this time. Almost thoughtful. Like it was waiting.

Minutes passed. Maybe more.

The tapping stopped. The air sat heavy, thick with silence. Then, from nowhere, a warmth stirred the back of my neck. Not a breeze. Not movement. Just heat. Faint, damp.

My fingers curled against my leg. The camper door was shut. The window was latched.

I stayed still. The warmth came again, closer this time.

I felt a shift in the van—fabric dragging against wood, a weight settling.

Then a breath. Deep. Controlled. Right against my skin. Before I could react, something pressed against my spine. Light at first—just the barest touch through my shirt. Then, a nail, jagged and slow, tracing its way up my back. Higher and higher.

I ran.

March 25th, ~8:40 PM

I jumped into bed, pulling the blankets around me. Home felt safe. My boyfriend would be off soon, his shift runs from 2 to 10. Just a couple of hours and I wouldn’t be alone.

I tried to calm my breathing. The bedroom was quiet except for the sound of my cat, Henry, snoring at the foot of the bed.

Then—a few light taps on the dresser. I was never alone.

I grabbed Henry and ran. My keys were still in my pocket. I didn’t turn the lights off. I didn’t look back. I just got in my car and drove. The dresser was still shut.

Now I’m at my brother’s house. Henry is curled up beside me, and I can still feel my pulse in my throat.

It’s late now and I am so tired after today, so I’m going to hop off. I’ll update everyone soon if anything happens.

Oh yeah and I called my boyfriend. I told him not to go home. Told him to come straight here. I don’t know if I can go back. Would it even make a difference?
