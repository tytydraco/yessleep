  I think I was ten when I first started noticing it happen.  To be fair, I have always been kind of stupid, but I still don’t think that is an excuse for not noticing for so long.  It definitely started earlier, when I was nine, but again, big dummy here, so I didn’t start putting it together until it was clearly present in my life.  My first distinct memory of it was the week of my ninth birthday.  My dad had already spoiled me with a pretty high-grade telescope; he let me open it early since there was supposed to be a meteor shower in the forecast, and he didn't want us to miss it.  

Looking back on it, this present was almost certainly something my dad got more enjoyment out of, but honestly, I would do the same thing if I were a parent.  Camouflaging your toys as a present for your kid is pretty genius.  Anyway, it was a couple of days before my birthday, and we started to set it up in the backyard of our standard suburban house.  Like most suburban neighborhoods in the early 2000s, the kids of the neighborhood were essentially communists, sharing a collective pile of half-broken toys, various sports balls, chalk, bicycles, etc, that always seemed to litter the identical yards of each passing house.  So, after my dad finished propping up the rather hefty telescope, a crowd of sweaty, summer-stained children began immigrating to our backyard, after some scouts had peered over the fence.  

Naturally, I was pretty pompous as I showed off what was certainly the most expensive and high-tech “toy” in the neighborhood.  I allowed a line of kids to take turns peering into the scope and stare up at the late afternoon sky.  Obviously, they couldn’t see shit besides blue, but they still acted like they just saw the face of God, which only made me feel more superior as the “owner” of this shared telescope.  

My dad nervously watched over the whole outing, begging each child to be gentle as they “adjusted” the scope wildly from left to right.  As the evening came, all the kids began drifting home, with envious goodbyes to both me and the telescope.  Dinner came and went, we had lasagna that night, funny how you remember smaller details after thinking back on big memories.  Normally, I would have been in bed by nine, but this was a special night that my dad planned.  We sat posted outside well past ten, when it finally started.  

I was lucky my dad knew what he was doing; I had no idea how short the shower would be.  As soon as the first meteor shot through the black night sky, my dad tore off his patio chair and lunged to the telescope.  If he hadn’t egged me over in time, I would have missed my chance to see in detail.  I was so mesmerized by the distant zipping lights that I just stood there, mouth agape and head craning upward.  

With an urgent pull of my arm, my dad dragged me over to the scope as the shower cascaded into the dark horizon.  Aiming my eye down the lens, I saw it all in its vibrant glory.  Massive space boulders engulfed in a camouflaging flame shot through space, downward to some far-off location on Earth.  I absorbed it all, trying to examine each meteor as it passed my field of vision.  The array of crashing Christmas lights filled my stupid little nine-year-old brain with so much awe, I think I crashed for a moment, cause the next thing I remember, my dad was pulling me away, whispering sharply, “Hey, hey, don’t drool on it!”  He allowed me one more peek through the scope as the shower’s short show was winding down.  I wish he hand’t.  

I spotted the last of the shower, one petite little orb zipping by.  It was much slower than the rest, which even as a nine-year-old, I thought was odd.  Its trajectory almost vibrated and shifted in violent directions.  And the burning trail was not that soft, golden white tail that the other meteors had.  It had a short red beam behind it.  I examined it with a strange cocktail of curiosity and dismay, like I wasn’t supposed to see it.  A sudden flash projected me away from the scope, and with a yelp, I rubbed my stung eyes.  Before my dad had a chance to ask me what happened, I hurriedly peered into the scope again.  The dwarven meteor was still in view, even more so, as I realized it was coming towards me.  

My eagerness to announce the phenomenon to my dad was cut short, as he pulled me back and excitedly pointed to the night sky, its brimming stars a static backdrop highlighting the clearly approaching meteor.  It wasn’t about to crash down on our house or anything, we could see it was much too far away still.  My dad held me up on his shoulders to look over the fence and watch as the falling space boulder came careening into the earth, just a couple of miles from our neighborhood.  With a muffled crashing noise, I saw as it landed past the treeline of the wood that lay just outside our neighborhood.  There was no immense earthquake upon impact, nor a deafening nuclear-esque bang.  It sounded like a firecracker going off under one of those steel waste bins you see homeless people gathered around in movies.  The ambient silence of a Summer night immediately continued.  

The rest of my memories of that night were a blur of excited ranting to my parents about exploring the crash site the next day, before my mom announced the dreaded bedtime.  Dad gave me a knowing look of sympathy as I was shooed to bed, knowing how amped up I still was about the whole experience.  Under normal circumstances, this would have been a treasured father-son core memory I held warmly until my death.  Then the sun rose, and the next day began.  

I corralled some of my closer friends from the neighborhood, along with my best friend at the time, Mikey, to begin the expedition into the woods in search of the meteorite.  Mikey was a year younger than me, something I constantly reminded him of in my vain attempt to invoke superiority.   God, kids are dumb.  He needed little convincing to join me, since his dad had also let him stay up to watch the meteor shower, albeit without a telescope.  

I wish I could remember the rest of the kids’ names.  Years of suppressing these memories have stifled the names and faces of all those neighborhood buddies.  Friends at that age are so loyal and optimistic of one another.  No past betrayals to stunt their trust, no experience with manipulative relationships to make them distant.  Just full-on trust and giddy faith in their peers.  It was these friends I journeyed with outside our flat suburban neighborhood into the sparse woods outlining our community.

There were five of us total, and how we got our parents’ permission to explore I will never know.  Throw it up to lax early 2000s parents, I suppose.  Our baby brains underestimated how far the walk would be.  I snatched my Spider-Man backpack of snacks before we all gathered and began our march around 1 PM.  We didn't hit the treeline until about 3:30 PM.  In any other situation, the long, boring walk would have led to mutiny in a group of kids our age.  I think the atmosphere of the situation kept us invested; the possibility of discovery and fame gripped our minds, drawing us to the final destination.  

One way or another, we made it. The treeline stood in front of us, and the final boss was nerves.  Don’t get me wrong, we heard of teenagers going out into these woods before, we knew that civilization had made its way into the forest, even if it was for the gross hormonal reasons.  But for us, it was uncharted territory; the comforting subconscious knowledge of our parents' presence in a nearby house was completely gone now.  Nevertheless, I pushed ahead into the thin wood, egging my buddies on.  

They trickled in behind me in a single-file line as I marched aimlessly past the trees.  Mikey trailed just behind me, his hand tugging the tail of my shirt.  I remember it only took about five minutes upon entering before we noticed a strange whiff in the air.  It smelled of burnt plastic mixed with decaying meatloaf.  I followed my nose, Mikey gripping me all the way.  The stench grew until it was so thick and potent that we all had to take shallow breaths under our uplifted shirts.  It was rough, but we found it a short while after.  

I stood over the petite crater, no bigger than a trampoline, and only about a couple of feet deep.  Mikey peeked over my shoulder, a nervous, giddy energy was making him giggle in my ear.  The other kids were all stoked as they gathered around.  High-pitched exclamations erupted as they looked down into the little pit.  I didn’t understand at the time, but I did not share in that eruption of discovery.  I stared at the thing, and that returning feeling came.  It felt like I wasn’t supposed to see it.  Like it was a late-night TV station that my parents would be furious if they caught me watching.  Not that it was explicitly grotesque, there was just an undertone that felt profane, something that my immature mind could not comprehend yet, only take note of.   

This feeling really upset me, because the actual visual was quite silly.  Inside this small crater was an even smaller object, a tiny flying saucer.  Its otherwise round edges were scuffed and blackened from the intense landing the night before.  Half of it was stuck in the scorched earth, the latter half poked out of the ground at a pretty comedic angle.  There were three tiny, square, tinted windows visible from the half sticking out.  An antenna protruded all bent and jagged in the air, with a red orb atop it.  Overall, it looked like a toy; I could have held it and zoomed it around in one hand with ease.  

Nevertheless, I was still petrified at the cusp of the crater when Mikey stepped in front of me and started edging into the pit.  A jolt of anger shot through me.  I was the leader after all, I should be the first to look at it up close.  I reached down to grab his shoulder, as I did, my foot slipped on the charred dirt.  I tumbled over Mikey before landing directly in front of the saucer.  Scraped knees and elbows were the least of my concerns as I looked up into the saucer’s windows, mere inches from my nose.

A silhouette moved inside, ducking out of view of the tinted panel.  I was frozen for a bit.  I wish I could remember what was going through my head at the time.  But I sure know that I bolted to my feet and came scraping out of the crater, Mikey in tow.  He was clearly freaked out by my reaction and ripped at my backpack as I bolted by him.  He attempted to heave himself out with me, but he tore off my backpack instead.  Those must have flimsy straps, or Mikey just had insane grip strength.  Either way, we charged out of the woods, the others following us in a panicked confusion.

We all ran home, back to the safety of our homes, our collective playpen.  It was late afternoon by the time we made it to the neighborhood, winded and sweaty as hell.  We all sat on a freshly mowed lawn, panting.  Everyone was staring at me, waiting for an explanation.  I tried ignoring them, catching my breath, and hoping they would drop the whole topic.  They didn’t obviously.  Mikey was the first to break the silence.  He simply asked why I got all spooked and ran.  Why I had freaked everyone out like that.  

I think its clear up to this point, that I was kind of a shitty, spoiled kid.  I HAD to be the leader, I HAD to show off the cool toys I got, and I HAD to leverage what superiority I had over others.  The idea of losing all the, in my mind at the time, “status points” I had accumulated with my group of friends scared me.  I was afraid of being seen as a big chicken, lesser.  So, I lied.  I told them I felt a heat from it, and we hadn’t considered the “radiation levels” that could have been coming off the saucer.  That, for all we knew, we could have been exposed to mutating levels of radiation if I had not chosen to run.  

To give my nine-year-old self some credit, this could have been a pretty valid concern, but hardly portrayed in an accurate sense.  My friends ate it up, a look of horror and amazement crossed their faces as they considered the possibility and its legitimacy.  Mikey nodded his head with a thoughtful finger pressed against his chin, which filled me with relief, as I valued his opinion of me the most.  The rest of the dwaining afternoon light was spent reminiscing of the adventure, the strange object in the crater, and our now, harrowing, escape from its “radiation rays”.  As dinner time rolled into our collective subconsciousness, the group dwindled one by one, until it was just Mikey and me sitting on my parents’ lawn.  As he was about to leave for his own house, he suddenly blurted out in dismay, “Oh, your backpack! I’m sorry, I tore it bad.  Did one of the guys grab it?”

A dread sank into my heart as I pictured it lying in the crater.  My school backpack turned adventure pack over the Summer.  As a kid, you tend to imagine your parents as insane ghouls who would prefer you risk your neck retrieving some mundane object, no matter the cost, rather than loving parents who would obviously prefer you come home safe and fess up that you lost something.  Well, I pictured my ghoulish parents flipping out over my backpack missing, God forbid a nine-year-old lose a Spider-Man-themed backpack his parents bought for fifteen dollars at Walmart.  I didn’t think of it like that, though.  To me, I guess I was just afraid of them seeing me differently, like a son they couldn’t trust as much anymore.  So, with a quick explanation to Mikey, I turned around and ran back to the forest. 

The Summer night still retained some hint of light as I re-entered the woods.  I had the whole run to plan my extraction.  Tip my toe into the crater, with one hand remaining on the cusp, and reach for the pack.  Simple as.  I slowed to a jog as it came into view, the familiar stench still lingering in the cool Summer breeze.  I inched over and peered into the shallow pit.  There sat my backpack, Spider-Man was coated in a streak of dark dirt.  My eyes shot to the center of the pit.  I felt queezy.  The saucer was gone.  A tiny indent in the earth was all that remained of its presence.  

I remember feeling mad at myself for being so scared.  Why did I still feel uneasy, despite it being gone?  Either way, I was there for a reason.  I began crawling down toward my pack.  One hand on the edge of the small crater, the other reaching down to retrieve.  Just as I gripped the ripped strap, I heard something charging in the woods towards me.  With an icy stab of fear piercing through me, I cried out and rolled into the pit, crashing into my backpack.  I curled up, shivering, on the verge of tears, when I saw Mikey peek into the hole.  

I was relieved, until I realized I had actually begun crying out of fear before he revealed himself.  Mikey saw this and snorted before breaking into a laugh.  I was so pissed.  After telling him to shut up multiple times, he finally calmed himself and told me, “I ran after you, I was worried about you going alone.”

I didn’t deserve a friend like Mikey, and in that moment, I wish I were grateful for him.  But I wasn’t.  I was furious that he saw me in a weakened state, that he saw me crying, that he scared me so bad.  All I could think about was how he could now tell the others about the incident and how they would all laugh at me for being a baby and crying just because Mikey spooked me. Now I know, looking back on it, Mikey was not that kind of friend.  But I was too childish to see that then. 

I grabbed my pack and dragged it out of the crater, refusing Mikey’s help, and began the long, silent walk back home.  He tried cheering me up, even talked about having me over the next night to play on his older brother’s PS2.  But I was completely closed off, bitter at him the whole way.  

We finally stepped foot back into the neighborhood.  Mikey gave me an awkward goodbye, and I grunted in response.  With a wave, he trudged off to his house, and I started towards mine.  The bitterness finally started subsiding as he wasn’t there to remind me of my “downfall”.  As my mind cleared, I finally noticed.  My backpack, which I had been pulling behind me this whole time, felt off.  It felt heavier than I remembered.
