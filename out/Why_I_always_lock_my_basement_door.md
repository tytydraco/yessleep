I live alone, in some suburbs near Philadelphia. It was a very cool night, with some visible fog outside. It had been like any normal night, I binged some shows on Netflix, watched some sports  and then when it was getting late, I decided to go to sleep. This is where it all started. When I was starting to close my eyes, I heard some things tumbling in the basement.

As any normal person would, I decided to check it out, and I didn’t see anything, just a few boxes out of place. I dismissed it as a simple rat running around, as I’ve had rat problems before. Then once I went back to bed, I started nodding off when I heard more boxes tumbling. I didn’t check it this time because it was probably another rat. I finally fell asleep, and I woke up at about 4:00 AM to go to work. As I was eating breakfast, I heard more boxes tumbling. Again, I ignored it.

But this time something was off. I started hearing heavy footsteps and what sounded like growls. Not normal, typical growls. They sounded very deep, and then that’s when I decided to call the police. I could hear the loud sirens in the distance, creeping up over the hills and getting near my house. Once they got there, I fully explained exactly what was going on and they decided to inspect it. They found nothing. One of the cops said, “You should be calling pest control instead”, and let out a chuckle. Of course, as with anything crazy like this, no one believes you until it’s too late.

I decided to go down there myself, yet again. There was something off about the basement this time. It had bloodstains on the back wall. ”This definitely isn’t normal”, I thought. I looked at my phone‘s time. “Crap! I’m gonna be late for work!” I said out loud. I finished breakfast, put my clothes on and went to work. I told the story to one of my coworkers, and of course, he didn’t believe me. Once I finished work, I got back home. I decided to go back inside the basement to see if anything had changed. Right in the center of the basement, with boxes piled around the edges, laid a pentagram, drawn with blood, and a skull in the center, with candles around it. It looked like some kind of a summon circle. I really didn’t know what to do at this point.

I couldn’t sleep tonight, not knowing I have have a satanic cult in my basement. So, I called a friend to come over and see. Once they got here, I showed them the basement. Of course, The basement was cleared of everything. Not just the pentagram, the entire basement. No boxes, old furnitute, nothing. There was absolutely zero proof. My friend called me delusional. Maybe I am, maybe I’m not. So, I waited a little more. Then, after a few hours, I heard that sinister growl again. I went down again, this time with my phone, ready to take a picture. There it was, the pentagram, with the skull, candles, and boxes. I snapped a photo. Once I viewed it, I got a message on my screen saying: “Unable to view photo. Reason: File corrupted. Error code: 0x80070570”.  “What the hell is this?”, I exclaimed. “This is going too far.” I said. I decided to touch around the walls, until I found some sort of hidden button.

 Curiosity got the best of me, and I touched the button. A hidden door opened to a large corridor leading to a junction, and the corridor also had various rooms. The corridor was made out of the materials you’d find in an old, abandoned mansion. Rotten and damp wood. It was very dark, and everything felt damp. I decided to go to the junction and see what was there. More corridors, with more rooms. “What kind of hellish maze am I in?” I said. “Hello?” I yelled, in hopes of finding someone, or something. Until I heard that large, deep growl I heard before. Heavy footsteps got closer. I could start seeing red eyes approaching me. I looked the other way, and saw a group of five people dressed in black, with what seemed like skulls covering their faces, like a mask. They were chanting something in a strange language I’ve never heard before, and with that… Thing.. approaching me, all I could think, or do, was ”RUN”. I made it to the mysterious door in the basement, and closed it, and made it to the basement door, and closed, and locked it. A while after that incident, I moved out, like any rational person would.

They inspected the house, and, guess what? Nothing, My basement was empty, no boxes, no doors, nothing. Now, I keep my basement door in my new house locked. Nothing has happened since that incident, but, better safe than sorry.
