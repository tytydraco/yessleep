Around the winter of 2001, I worked for a large church in northern Arkansas. This church was progressive. Not of ideologies, no, this was the South, it was just --  very modern. It was one of the first churches in that region of the country to use ICQ, messaging boards, have their own local website, and overall use technology to its advantage.

My father was a computer tech around that time and got a job through a friend of the pastor there. Eventually, I was able to work by mid-December and I would manage our ICQ messaging system for workers. It was weird that we did that because back then, workers weren't occasionally notified of things while being home like they are now; now, all it takes is a text message.  

But, I have to admit, it was a pain -- an irritating pain for each message to be written, then load, then get to a worker. By the time anything went through for a problem with a member or the building or an event going on in the week, a solution and hearsay already did my job for me. However, professionally, It was much easier for the leaders of the church to pay a young teenager like me only $7 dollar minimum-wage and leave me to send messages for two hours or more so they didn't have to bother hosting events for events or standing outside markets with flyers. 

Like I said, the system at the time was so slow that a mistake costed them more money and me more time, and God forbid they go over the $7 dollar pay they were giving me.  One night, I had to send out messages and usually they were short and was meant for updates on the schedule or anything coming up. This one night however, I was talking with another ICQ messenger who was actually professional and sent messages faster then I did. He was from another church and was communicating with me on an event that involved our churches. Our messages went something like: 

\[Guy's Name\]: We were both told we would set up speakers in the dining hall next to one of the seating area. Is that correct? 

\[My Name\]: I would ask but that sounds fairly correct. I would not expect them to go anywhere else. 

Common messages, all pertaining to the event. Finally, after getting together information, making a schedule, and messaging everyone the things, I was able to leave. I look back now on what would have happened if I shut down the Macintosh I was using and went home and did not go back onto ICQ, but that did not happen. I left, went home, and went back onto ICQ to chat with a friend of mine. We stayed up late talking, and over time, I kept getting notifications on the other church guys' chats. The period between every message was different; sometimes I'd get a notification every few seconds, then every 10 minutes. Around midnight, I was tired and got off ICQ, ending my conversation with my friend and forgetting the other guys' messages. 

The next morning, I kept hearing both my computer. The first thing I went to was my computer, and to my shock, my friends were spamming me on the news that some technician in a church went missing and a large, gapping hole was in the roof and on the ground were debris and clothes. With my mind racing, I got in my car and drove down to the guy's church. While it wasn't easy to persuade three cops, a detective, and members of the church to let me at least glimpse the "crime scene", I was able to do it through a much more sacred member of the church -- one of my maternal aunts, go-figure. She lead me to the area. It was just everyone described. Above me was a gorgeous mural of what was the Holy trinity and the hole agape with the sun shining through what was God's head.

I walked right under the hole and then looked on the ground, and whole the debris and clothes are gone, something was on the ground that must have been mistaken for garbage. I picked up a simple folded piece of paper that had a simple sentence on it: The guy was never found again, the church closed down, and basically all the information you could find on the mysterious disappearance has now been lost to old local news websites and unarchived newspapers. 

When I arrived home, after giving my statement to the police as I told them I spoke to him earlier, I got onto my computer and checked the messages. I lied to the police by not telling them about our messages as I did not want them to erase the messages or take anything they deemed evidence like my computer. The first few messages were random suggestions about the event and what music was going to be used -- and then I got to a single message that was not even a message, but a photo. Linked to the photo was the last thing the guy would ever message me. It read:

*Do you see it?*

The photo has been long gone, but what I remember from it is seeing just above the hole, looking down at the guy, was a massive eye that was almost shrouded by feathers. While I don't have the photo now, the image of seeing an eye in the sky peering down at you, will remain with me for the rest of my life.
