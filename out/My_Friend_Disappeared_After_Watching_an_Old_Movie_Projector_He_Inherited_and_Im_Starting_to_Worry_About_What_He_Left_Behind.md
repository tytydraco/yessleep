My friend has been missing for almost a month now. He’d been living with his parents, feeling stuck and frustrated ever since his grandfather passed away. When he inherited an old film projector from him, he thought it might somehow help him break through his writer’s block.

The last time we talked, he told me he was going to finally try it out and watch whatever was on those old reels. Apparently, he fell asleep watching one of the movies, but when he woke up… Well, according to his notes, he didn’t wake up in his room. He woke up in some kind of labyrinth.

His parents found his notebook under his bed after he disappeared. I’ve started typing it up, but it’s long, and I’m still going through it. For now, I’m posting the first part, hoping someone might have some idea of what’s going on—or maybe where he could have gone. I’ll post the rest as I go through it.

If anyone has seen anything like this before, please, let me know:

"It’s been over a year since I wrote my last short story. My heart just hasn’t been in it. I’m not sure what to write. I guess I’ll start by explaining what and why I’m writing. I’m an aspiring fiction author, but I’ve struggled with writing for a long time. Mostly because I’ve been depressed for years. I feel like I have a ton of good ideas, but it hurts to think. I love my imagination, but it’s an increasingly painful place these days. It’s so bad that I’ve been too afraid to try to do anything creative. I’ve mostly been trying to avoid my thoughts because I don’t want to think about how my life got this way. But I can’t stand just sitting around getting more depressed. I need to do something to at least try to fix my life. 

Recently, I decided to write this diary just to get myself writing something again. Maybe if I just try to write whatever comes to mind, it could turn into a story. As I said, my thoughts have been painful and scary lately, but horror is one of my favorite genres. Maybe I could get inspired to write something horrific. And I’m struggling to write even this. I’m just so indecisive about every word. I hate how very long it takes me to wake up sometimes. Over two days, I only wrote a little over a paragraph. This is the only practice that will get me back into writing anything again. But it’s okay if I just keep at this. I’m sure I can get used to it again. It’s just so annoying how groggy and lethargic I can feel sometimes. I’ll try writing while watching something instead of listening to music for a bit. The music can sometimes feel like noise if I’m not in the right mood and I’m forcing myself to write. That was a dumb idea, but watching something is too distracting. I’ll just listen to fantasy music.

I haven’t written anything in so long because I was pretty depressed after getting kicked out of the friend group I had for over two years. It’s a long story that I don’t want to overthink about right now. I’ll just say that it sent me back into my old ways of being a depressed, lethargic shut-in who hardly gets any exercise or sun. I tried therapy, and I gave up on that. It’s another long story I might get into later. It’s well after midnight, and I’m pretty tired, so I guess I’ll stop here. I know I haven’t written much yet, but I started pretty late. Besides, I want to try to improve my sleeping habits. I would like to wake up before noon instead of well after for once. It’s so hard to get good sleep when you’re depressed. 









My parents and aunts finally stopped fighting over the inheritance from my grandparents and settled on who gets what recently. It took years for everything to be settled in court finally. According to my parents, my aunt did some stuff to give herself control over my grandparents’ finances shortly before they died. I don’t know, and I don’t know if I care. I loved my grandparents, but I don’t like sticking my nose in or thinking about my family’s drama. It’s nice to have some extra money, my grandfather left me a few things. They just arrived in the mail today. Most of it is computer stuff. I got my love of tech from my grandpa. He taught me how to use them when I was really little. I remember visiting my grandparents and playing Nickelodeon and Cartoonnetwork games on his computer as a kid. It was a while before I had a computer at home. And even longer before we had internet faster than dial-up. 

As nice as the computer stuff is, it’s not the most exciting thing my grandfather left me. I also got this old projector. It doesn’t have any branding or labels on it, but it looks really nice and in good condition. Maybe my grandpa made it himself. His tech interests and knowledge were always far beyond mine. I was only ever interested in PCs, and He liked to fix anything and everything. Still, I wonder why he left me a projector. I was never really interested in this kind of stuff. One summer, my friends and I wanted to make a movie, and that’s maybe why. But I was always way more interested in writing and making video games. Because of that, my tech interests and knowledge have always been mainly focused on the software side. 

This projector looks like it's from another era. The design is elegant yet mysterious, with intricate engravings along its metal casing that seem to tell their own story. I can't shake the feeling that there's something more to this projector, something beyond its physical appearance. Perhaps there's a reason my grandfather left it specifically to me, a reason that goes beyond nostalgia or a passing interest in filmmaking. I don’t know why I didn’t notice before, but it’s bizarrely cold, almost like dry ice. I’m going to try it out in my large walk-in closet. The walls in there are bright white and plenty large. Plus, it’s more than dark enough for the projections to show up clearly. Also, the bulb outlet has a power socket. 

 I locked my bedroom door so my parents don’t bother me while I watch this. I'm shocked this old projector still works perfectly; it emits an eerie, whirring hum as it powers on. Luckily, it came with a large film reel already loaded. I’m not surprised this thing is so slow. I guess this projector hasn’t been tested in a while because it’s kicking up a lot of dust. The hum of the projector is growing a little louder, filling this small space with a strange, low mechanical rhythm. The light from the projector is flickering to life on the wall in front of me, revealing a black-and-white scene reminiscent of early silent films. The image is blurry, grainy, foggy, and distorted as if it's been warped by time itself.

It's hard to discern what exactly is being shown. Shapes and shadows dance across the surface, forming abstract patterns that seem to shift and morph with each passing moment. The scene is slowly beginning to coalesce into a semblance of coherence, like memories emerging from a fog. The images are muted and washed out as if drained of life. The setting appears to be abandoned, and It’s an empty, featureless dessert. A barren expanse is stretching out before me, devoid of any signs of habitation or vegetation. The sky above is a dull, featureless gray, casting a pall of gloom over the scene. Despite the lack of any discernible movement, I can't shake the feeling of being watched. It's as if unseen eyes are peering out from the darkness, observing my every move with a sense of malevolent curiosity.

As I continue to watch, the scene on the wall begins to undulate subtly, like the surface of a still pond disturbed by a single drop. The barren desert landscape starts to darken at the edges, the shadows deepening and growing as if the night is rushing in at an unnatural pace. The horizon line is beginning to appear cracked and uneven and separate the barren plains from a sky choked with churning, unnatural fog. An inky blackness is bleeding down from the clouds, slowly but steadily consuming the empty landscape. The whole scene is flooding with a strange, viscous substance. It's as if the very essence of the film is seeping through the projector, defying the laws of reality. The thick, murky liquid is creeping slowly across the landscape, swallowing everything in its path. It moves with an eerie deliberateness, oozing into every crevice and corner, consuming the world before my eyes.

The viscous darkness now pools in the center of the barren vista, swirling and churning as if alive. From this inky well, a grotesque and misshapen head is slowly rising from the ground. Its features are vague and indistinct, like a half-remembered nightmare. It seems impossibly large, and its silhouette dwarfs the horizon. Hollow eyes stare out of it into the abyss, devoid of any emotion or life. It has a single, elongated nostril that hangs flaccid. The head makes no sound as its gaping maw yawns open, revealing row upon row of jagged teeth. All the liquid is somehow draining out of its mouth and drying most of the land.

A shape is emerging from the depths of the churning, black ocean, or perhaps it's a boat - the distinction is blurred in the murky depths of the film. It's a silhouette shrouded in darkness, and its contours are barely discernible against the inky blackness of the water. It’s slowly inching its way towards the shore. As it draws closer, details start to emerge from the gloom. A lone, skeletal rowboat bobs precariously in the churning waves. Suddenly, a long, spindly arm reaches out from the water, grasping the edge of the boat. The figure is pulling itself up onto the rocking ship, and each movement is deliberate and foreboding.

 It seems impossibly tall and thin, its limbs extremely long and twisted, like the branches of a gnarled tree reaching out to ensnare unwitting prey. Its head hangs at an unnatural angle. And its eyes... if they can be called eyes, gleam with an otherworldly light. They’re piercing through the darkness with an intensity that sends shivers down my spine. The water around the ship is starting to bubble and froth. The figure is crying out a mournful sound that cuts through the rhythmic groan of the projector like a knife. It’s somehow human and inhuman at the same time. For all my growing sense of unease, I’m unable to tear my gaze away from the unfolding spectacle. It’s now standing on the boat, and It seems to be searching for something. Its pale, hollow orbs are scanning the barren horizon. It lets out another mournful cry, this one tinged with desperation.

The camera just panned over to the forest. A monstrous, undulating creature is emerging from the depths of the forest. The grainy film struggles to capture its details. However, I can just barely make out its immense, barnacle-encrusted limbs and a hide that ripples like a vast sea. It's a creature so large it defies comprehension, dwarfing the mountains in the distance and casting an oppressive shadow that seems to stretch for miles.  It moves with an unnatural grace, and its form is shifting and undulating like a specter summoned from the darkest depths of the human psyche. Its body is a patchwork of mismatched limbs and grotesque appendages, each one moving in perfect synchrony with the others. As it draws nearer, I can make out the details of its… well, what I guess is its face. Its eyes are empty voids, sucking in the light around them like black holes in the fabric of reality. Its mouth stretches impossibly wide, revealing row upon row of jagged teeth that glint malevolently in the dim light.

The camera shifted focus again, and it settled on the most disturbing sight yet. In the center stands a colossal tree, unlike anything on Earth. It stretches endlessly upwards, disappearing into the swirling gray above. The sheer size of it is overwhelming, dwarfing the mountains on the horizon and casting a sickly green pall over the landscape. But it's not just the size that’s chilling. The tree's roots are sprawling like the tentacles of some ancient leviathan. Its trunk is impossibly bulbous, its surface mottled and wrinkled like ancient, sunbaked flesh. The bark is gnarled and weeping sap that glows faintly, pulsating with a rhythm that mimics a heartbeat. Its branches are thick and sinuous and writhe and twist like enormous, petrified serpents. They seem to pulse with a slow, rhythmic life, their surfaces glistening with a sickly luminescence that seems to emanate from within the bark itself. Nestled amongst the branches, colossal, fleshy fruit dangle precariously, their surfaces pulsating with a rhythmic, almost hypnotic glow. They resemble giant, misshapen eyes, staring down at the desolate plain below with a cold, unblinking gaze.

But the most unsettling aspect is the single, immense eye embedded deep within the trunk itself. It's a pulsating orb of raw, chaotic energy, the iris a swirling vortex of shifting colors. It stares out from the tree with a chilling intelligence. I can't help but feel it looking directly at me, judging, scrutinizing. This tree, this grotesque parody of nature, feels ancient beyond imagining, powerful beyond comprehension. It is a monument to some dark, unknown force, and I have a feeling I've stumbled upon something I was never meant to see. This tree, this entity, is the epicenter of the film's universe, a god-like presence that exudes an aura of primordial power. It's as if the tree has always been there, watching, waiting, a silent observer to the passage of eons. The figure from the boat, now on land, approaches the tree with a slow, reverent gait. Its form is dwarfed by the sheer size of the tree, yet there is a connection, an unspoken understanding between them. The figure reaches out a hand, and the tree responds, a single massive limb lowering to touch the figure's outstretched fingers.

The landscape is starting to warp and twist, contorting into bizarre and unnatural shapes. The once primarily empty expanse is now filled with strange, otherworldly structures. Now, I see an overgrown garden with gnarled trees reaching out like skeletal fingers clawing at the sky. They’re casting twisted shadows across the ground. Strange, barely discernible shapes are popping in and out of view. Grotesque humanoid forms with unsettling proportions are writhing and wriggling across the screen. Their movements are jagged and erratic, as if they are not entirely tethered to the laws of physics. Their faces are shrouded and obscured by masks of blank, dark expression. I can make out the silhouette of a looming structure, its jagged spires piercing the heavens. As the minutes pass, the imagery is becoming increasingly surreal and disorienting. Shapes morph and twist in impossible ways, defying logic and reason. In spite of the unsettling nature of the footage, there is a certain monotony to it. The abstract patterns have become hypnotic, and It’s starting to make my eyelids feel heavy. Between that and the rhythmic whirring of the projector's mechanics, I just might fall asleep in my chair right here.

What happened? Where am I? I don’t feel like I was asleep for very long. This doesn’t look anything like my closet. I just woke up, and I’m in a little white room. There’s nothing in here except me, a small desk, a chair, a notebook, and a pen. The scariest thing is there is no door or window. I don’t know how I ended up here or why. But I’m guessing whoever put me in here wants me to write my thoughts in this notebook. Well, I'm less guessing and more hoping that writing this will make them happy and let me out. I don’t know what else I can do right now, but I can’t think of what to write, and I’m still exhausted. And the fact that everything in this room is the same shade of white is strangely maddening. Especially with the only light source here being one overbearing, almost blinding bright white fluorescent light. I think I’ll just try to take a nap. Maybe this is just a nightmare, and I’ll wake up in my room.

Fuck, damn it, I’m still stuck in here. And I think that the light is getting worse. It’s almost impossible to see anything. It’s almost like the light is washing away all the shadows and contrasting light. It’s very disorienting. It’s like being lost in a blank, white, empty void. I tried breaking through the walls. I even tried hitting them with the chair. But it didn’t do any good, and I just wore myself out. I have to find some way out. That was weird. I had to rewrite that last sentence because I accidentally wrote it on the desk. At least, I think I did. Wait, where’s the desk? I can’t tell where the desk is.

I keep trying to feel around for it in the all-consuming light. But it’s almost like it just keeps shifting virtually as though it was liquid. Yet it feels rock solid and bone dry. It’s a very confusing feeling I’ve never experienced before. I’ve had trouble feeling around for things in the dark before. But nothing has ever run from me like this. Damn, this is frustrating. What the hell? I slammed my fists down on the desk, and for a moment, I could tell where it was. However, as soon as I moved my hands, it shifted again. I can hardly believe it, but I think concentration makes it stay. Ok, this has to be a dream because it’s working. I don’t know if I’m awake, I feel very awake, but I don’t care. I just want out. I have an idea. Wow, that worked. I drew a circle on the wall and forced my hand through. So I guess if I draw a door, maybe I can use it to escape. It’s worth a shot.

It was all I could do to scratch a crude rectangle across the wall, but I managed to make it through. I thought, but where am I now? I can’t see anything; it's just pure bright white everywhere. Why can’t I stand up? Am I falling? I think I am. How did it take me so long to notice that I was falling? It’s like I wasn’t falling before I saw, or guessed it? But I didn't even feel like I was floating. I didn’t feel like anything like I was barely even existing. I’ve been falling for a while. What’s going to happen? Am I stuck falling forever, or am I going to land? I don’t know which I’m more afraid of. I’ve had way more than my fair share of suicidal thoughts, and I’ve even attempted it a couple of times. But I’m a coward who’s terrified of death. I don’t want my life to end now, especially not like this. And not here all alone. I'm so sorry…

What? Am I ok? Am I alive? How did... Where am I? The floor is so soft and cold. It's almost like it's not even there. But I feel like I'm on solid ground. That is solid enough, anyway. This room is just as blindingly white as the last one. Well, at least this one is a lot bigger and has several doors. I might find an exit around here. This place is like an office building, except it's far more cold, sterile, and pure white. Every step I take here seems to be getting me more lost. How long have I been searching for an exit? This place is almost like an empty dream. I tried calling out for help, but I couldn't. No matter how hard I yell, I can’t hear myself. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with me. I tried clapping, kicking the wall, and stomping the ground. But I heard nothing but a cold void of silence. This place is like a box that’s hostile to any sign of life. It’s oppressively sterile and trim as much as it is hopelessly endless. I don’t even have any breath in here…

How long have I been trapped here, searching for an exit in this stark white maze? I can’t remember if I checked three hundred rooms or just three. I think this place is doing something to my brain. I can feel my mind slowly fading and getting fuzzy. I’m starting to struggle to think and concentrate. What’s going on? Where am I? This place seems to be making me numb inside and out. I can feel my mind draining. What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I think? Why is my mind so blank now? Where was I? I lost my train of thought. I need to concentrate. I just need to find the exit…"
