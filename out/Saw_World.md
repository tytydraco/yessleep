I am a wallflower by nature. I see the world go by from the windows of my tiny house on the outskirts of this quiet town. It is a boring life, but it’s mine and I have become used to its calm beat.

On this particular day, however…

I woke up to an awkward sound that cut through the serenity of my usual morning routine. Rubbing my eyes dry, I rushed to the window attracted by the strange noise coming from the public square across the road.

Looking down at what was happening with difficulty through dirty glass panes… My breath caught in my throat when I saw an uncanny picture: circular saws mounted above benches and slowly rotating in the early morning sunlight. What kind of madness was this?

I struggled for my reliable binoculars, readjusted lenses, and watched that weird performance again through them. The blades were shining ominously against a backdrop of what used to be a peaceful square itself. Then there they were – two young people sitting on one bench fitting around opposite sides of one turning blade.

I watched in terror as my heart pounded in my chest. Their hands came together with a sound like bones breaking. The knives made short work of their victims, whose blood sprayed all over the pavement.

But what bothered me was the other townsfolk’s reaction – or lack thereof. People walked on by without noticing anything odd although it didn’t seem to bother them at all that this was a grotesque scene out there. How could they not see how dangerous things had become?

Screams were coming from the couple before their bodies were wrapped in agony, and then suddenly, out of nowhere appeared a dark black van with tinted windows. Some guys dressed in air-tight suits quickly carried these people to join others who disappeared with them down another street of no return at amazing speeds.

My mind whirled with shock as I stood still next to the window. What evil presence had descended upon our once idyllic town? Why were those around them so indifferent to the abominations taking place right under their noses?

I realized as the sun cast long shadows across the deserted square when it climbed higher into the sky. My home was no longer safe for me anymore.

Weeks passed by and the events at the town square continued to escalate. Each day I would look through my window hoping that the awful incident I had seen was just a figment of my imagination. But as dawn broke, and its golden light bathed empty streets, the gloomy reality remained unchanged.

The saw blades which were once grotesque strangers had become like a tumor growing on every part of the public place; on every bench, post lamp, water fountain, and even the beating oak tree that has always been there for ages without talking.

Every day more people got hurt from the blades and taken away. It pained deeply watching helplessly while those passing by fell into these death traps with their screams being drowned in noiseless streets. But still, no one in town knows what is happening around them.

I longed to step forward, shake them out of their stupor, and demand for explanations. Yet, fear kept me rooted here, chained to my safety within myself. The outside world had turned into a nightmarish realm that I didn’t want to venture beyond my window.

The mysterious van, with its ominous black exterior and enigmatic occupants, had become a constant presence in my peripheral vision. It never really left my sight because all day long it seemed to slink around the streets, creeping out of the darkness whenever there was any sort of calamity about, and veiling its design.

I got more isolated as time went on. My once lively neighborhood is now deserted; everyone has disappeared without a trace with only reminders remaining in the form of echoes from their past life. I was alone, watching the advancing darkness that threatened to swaddle our souls.

At sunset, when sun rays cast shadows over an empty road I sink back into my home with a heavy heart. The nightmare was not over yet; it was just beginning. Thus, I waited in a world that could easily plunge into destruction at any moment.

The passage of time in my desolate existence blurred together, marked only by the relentless march of the sun across the sky and the ever-present hum of circular saw blades outside my windowpane. Days became weeks and weeks became months before ‘time’ itself blurred away as an abstract concept lost in suffocating loneliness.

The former lively quarter had turned into a ghostly whisper of its previous state. Streets that were once vibrant with children’s laughter and the murmurs of neighbors now lay deserted, their silence only being broken by the occasional whirring lethal blades.

I watched as the earth outside my window shriveled up and died, swallowed up entirely by the malevolent force that had descended on us. The circular saw blades, which had been limited to the public square before this time, littered the roads like a macabre landmine daring anyone brave enough to try their luck moving out.

Yet I stayed true to my lonely self and remained sentinel in a sea of darkness. The outside world had become an almost forgotten memory, losing itself amidst a tangle of nightmares that possessed me all day long.

As days turned into eternities, I found myself constantly grappling with the gnawing ache of loneliness that threatened to consume me from within. My soul was heavily burdened due to the lack of any human companionship; therefore, it made me feel every moment that an empty void existed deep inside me.

However, I was hopeful in this suffocating darkness. Because I knew that somewhere out there, outside my window, others were still fighting on and clinging to life as they fought against a rising tide of despair.

And so, I waited. As each day came and went, my resolve grew stronger by the day; I knew now that there must be other survivors of this devastated world, we used to live in. Others still walk on earth even now amidst the ruins of our shattered world, their hearts beating defiantly against the encroaching shadow threatening to consume us all.

But every evening, I was reminded that my existence was harsh. In this world where nights went on forever, one had to struggle for survival because moments were slipping away fast and the thread between hope and despair was growing thinner with every tick of time.

Day after day, loneliness became heavier on me like a shroud squeezing out all breath from me. My home which used to be familiar had become a jail whose walls closed in with every inhalation and exhalation.

However, the feeling that threatened to engulf me was one of emptiness and despair, there was a single flicker of determination inside me. I could no longer tremble behind my window anymore; hiding from the crumbling world outside. It was time for me to face the unknown, walk through the darkness, and meet my doom.

I gathered up my supplies, trying hard to steel myself for what lay ahead. The circular saw blades beyond my window were huge hazards that shone in the dying daylight.

Days went on endlessly and stretched, I could not escape their loneliness while struggling with the darkness which had surrounded me. A fortress against the outside complexity, now my asylum became a jail where every passing moment its walls grew closer to me.

I decided that as the world out there descended into more madness, I’d face the unknown from within the confines of my house. With no more than my cleverness and a stubborn desire for survival, I plunged into myself searching for solace against anarchy beyond my window.

The circular saw blades grew in number outside, and the constant deadly song reminded me that danger was just around the corner but it could not reach here. So, I retreated further inside myself until I was ensconced in thoughts alone. The nightmare that descended like a pall over our once peaceful village lay before me, wrapped in entangled puzzle pieces of uncertainty.

However much I tried to find it out, the truth remained hidden—a transient ghost teasing at the boundaries of my awareness. Shadows appeared like a mystery van, whose sinister purpose and enigmatic occupants mocked me from there, forever reminding me of the unknown dangers.

Inside the stillness of my lonely life, I felt it all come crashing down on me. The world outside had become a terrible nightmare that made no sense at all; features I used to know about it have now transformed into symbols of pain and suffering.

Yet this chaos gave me some glimmer of hope. Somewhere in my darkness stood resilience, which never broke even when I was on the edge of giving up. Day by day, I strengthened my defenses and built a fortress within the shattered walls of my mind.

Thus, in my solitude, I remained immovable as darkness approached from every side. Even if the world outside went mad, despair would not be an option for me. It was only by looking deep into myself that I found the courage to confront mysteries and overcome them victorious thereby showing that each human being’s spirit cannot be broken down easily.

That held until I noticed my supplies were running out. Now, I’m making peace with the fact that at some point I’ll need to go out and seek food and water. I know they’re still watching me. I can see them parked on the other side of the street from time to time. The best I can do is prepare myself to go out and make sure I don’t touch one of those blades, whatever they are.
