He kissed me like he was afraid I might disappear. Not desperately. Not hurriedly. Gently. Carefully. As if he needed to confirm I wasn’t some fleeting illusion, something conjured out of the night air. The evening had been quiet, without any remarkable event. We walked beneath dim lights, we spoke, we laughed. The ease of it all unsettled me, as though we had known each other longer than time allowed.

I remember the moment he took my hand and spun me in the middle of the sidewalk. I turned. I laughed. He caught me. For the briefest second, it felt as though the world had paused. 

The streetlights buzzed faintly above us. The air hung heavy, thick with stillness. It felt like one of those moments people forget while it’s happening. But I didn’t forget. I saw everything. The texture of the pavement beneath our feet. The flickering neon reflections in the windows. The weight of his hand, warm and steady in mine.

He walked me home even though it meant doubling his way back. Neither of us said much as we moved side by side. Our arms brushed now and then. I listened more to the rhythm of our footsteps than to anything else. It echoed strangely, as if the streets had emptied just for us.

At my door, he kissed me again. Once. Then again. Then a third time. As if that sequence held a meaning only he understood. I told him I would see him soon. He nodded and smiled, soft and distant, like someone already preparing to leave.

The next morning I woke with a weightless sort of joy, as if something important had quietly begun. I reached for my phone and typed a message. Still thinking about last night. I added an emoji without thinking. I didn’t regret it even while blushing.

Then I waited.

An hour passed. 

Then two.

I told myself he was sleeping. I scrolled through my photos. I searched for the one I remembered taking in the kitchen, the one where we both looked ridiculous. I had checked it. Laughed. Deleted the first one. Saved the second. I was sure of it. 

But there was nothing there. 
Not even in the recently deleted folder.

I opened our chat. It felt too empty. As though entire conversations had vanished. I couldn’t be sure. Maybe I had imagined more than what was real. Maybe I had dreamed the connection ?

I turned off my phone. I tried to breathe. I told myself again and again that nothing was wrong.

Then, in the middle of the night, my phone buzzed. One message. No name. No preview.

 "You should stop looking for him."

I stared at the words for a long time. I read them until my eyes blurred. I wanted to believe it was a mistake. A joke. But the silence that followed felt deliberate. Heavy. Like something watching just out of reach.

The next day, anger replaced the fear. Who would send something like that? What gave them the right? I imagined asking him to his face. I imagined yelling, demanding an explanation. But deep down I knew I wouldn’t get one. I set my phone down with trembling fingers. Who would be so cruel ?

I tried to pretend I still had control.

I told myself I would not message again. 

I told myself I would wait. 

That maybe he needed space. 

That maybe this was not about me.

But the silence stretched. 

And I didn’t even have answers about that disturbing message.

My friends said I had grown distant. I didn’t argue. I couldn’t. I had no way to explain that I felt like I was slowly vanishing. That even my memories felt unstable. That I had looked in the mirror that morning and, for a moment, didn’t recognize my own face.

I thought about writing to him again. I hovered over the message field more than once. My hands would shake. I would delete the words before they took shape.

And then came the second message.

"He’s not who is pretending to be."

I did not scream. 

I did not move. 

I read it once. 

Then again. 

My skin turned cold. 

 And a third message came. Just three words.
"You’re next"

My heart pressed hard against my ribs. 
I wanted to believe it was meaningless. That it was absurd. Maybe just a coincidence or a mean prank ? But the shadows in the corners of the room had lengthened. The light had dimmed, even though the lamp was still on.

Days passed, but the silence did not lift.
I started seeing things I could not explain. Hallways that stretched longer than I remembered. Voices that fell silent the moment I turned. Reflections that lagged by a single heartbeat. I told myself it was loneliness. That grief plays tricks on the mind. But even that explanation began to crumble.

I avoided mirrors. I stopped answering texts. I stopped speaking in crowded places, afraid I might hear my name spoken by someone who was no longer there.

At night, I lay in bed with the covers pulled tight around me, counting the seconds between each breath. Waiting for something I couldn’t name. Something I had no words for. But I could feel it, growing closer. In the mist of the chaos, I was still looking for him.

Sometimes, when I blink too slowly, I see him standing just beyond the glass.

Smiling like the night he said goodbye.

I remember how quiet it was now, the way silence settled over everything like a heavy curtain. By the time the sun rises I am already exhausted. I feel myself fracturing in the emptiness of ordinary mornings. Friends talk, but their words echo meaningless unless I can hear them. I do not know if I still exist.

Then comes the night I can no longer pretend. My phone buzzes again. I have tried not to expect it, but I want it to be him. I cannot look. But when I do:

"You are next."

Not you’re. You are. The tone is absolute. I let the phone slip from my hand. I collapse on the bed, limbs shaking, air too shallow. There is no comfort in silence anymore. Not tonight.

The darkness in my room grows alive. I watch shadows shift in ways they should not. The door frame stretches. The corners sag into themselves. A shape appears across the room. It does not walk. It just stands.

I realize it’s me. It’s him. A hollow echo with glass eyes. He stands behind it. Smiling like the night he kissed me. That press of lips that once felt like promise dissolves into something darker.
I can’t tell which is real. Is it an illusion ? 

The air warps. The lines between me, him, this silence all blur.

My reflection in the polished surface of my phone flickers. His face, my face, something in between. I press my palm to the surface. It warps under my fingertips like a memory shifting away. A soft whisper rises from the phone speaker though no time is tracked.

I am next.

Heart pounding so loud I think it might break me. The edges of the room stretch. The windows breathe. Outside there is still no one. Inside I taste the salt of terror and resignation.

I stand. 

I take what courage I have left. 

I walk toward the figure that might be me. 

The smell of stale air grows thick. The figure tilts its head. Eyes empty. Quiet.

I reach out as though to touch it. My fingers graze air. It ripples, disperses. A cold void opens beneath my feet. I fall backward onto the bed. The darkness follows me into sleep.
Morning comes, hazy and uncertain. I wake alone. No phone beside me. No message. I sit up, body trembling, covered in sweat. I step in front of the mirror. The reflection is mine again. Breathing. Framed by light.

If anyone remembers me… please say something. Anything.

But… I know. I understand.

I was erased. 

I barely survived. 

For now. 

I am posting this. Because I need someone to know I was here, to prove to myself that I was existing that I was real. I type these words as a last plea and a warning.

They might fade too. But if even one person reads them. Acknowledge them. Maybe I’ll not be forgotten. Maybe I can be real again.

But what’s even is real ?

I don’t know anymore, maybe I didn’t existed to beginning with or maybe he erased me ?

I might not last long.

He is still out there.

Waiting.

And when the silence finds you, you may already be next.

So please…

 I don't need you to believe me. 

I just needed one of you to respond… before he picks you instead and you be one next to fade away and be forgotten.
