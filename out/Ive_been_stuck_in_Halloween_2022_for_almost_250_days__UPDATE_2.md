I know I’ve been gone for a while, and I apologize for my sudden absence. After my last post, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something peculiar about the forest near the house. My curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to follow the suggestion of u/Deathly-DumDum and check it out.

As I ventured deeper into the forest, I noticed an unusual phenomenon: a bunch of leaves swirling in a mesmerizing and almost hypnotic pattern. Before I could fully comprehend what was happening, the world around me seemed to collapse into darkness. 

I blacked out, and when I finally regained consciousness, it was already August! It felt as if I had lost an entire month, and I couldn't make sense of what had transpired during that missing time. The forest had played tricks on me, and it seemed like it had a story to tell.

To my surprise, there was a mysterious note hidden in the pocket of my jacket when I woke up. The message on it was puzzling, written in an encrypted code that made it virtually unreadable. It read, “Xytu ljyynsl dtzwxjqk ns xnyzfyntsx dtz its’y gjqtsl, tw sjcy ynrj ny’qq gj ktw ltti. - Xfr.” I couldn't help but wonder who Xfr was and what their connection to the forest and the cryptic message meant. The urgency to decipher it and understand its significance consumed me.

As I tried various methods to decode the message, my phone seemed to act up strangely, almost as if the forest's influence extended beyond the blackout incident. It was an unsettling thought that Sam, whom I now believed was Xfr, might be behind this, using some form of technology manipulation. The suspicion of Sam's involvement only intensified my determination to unravel the mystery.

Cryptography was not my forte, so I decided to seek help from you guys. If you guys either know cryptography, or even can use an online tool, it would help out a lot.

Through my deeper research, I stumbled upon an old newspaper article from years ago, chronicling a series of unexplained disappearances in the forest. All the disappearances happened on Halloween night, and each person seemed to have no history of family, which makes me wonder if I'm not the first person who has been cursed by Sam.

I noticed similarities across each person who had disappeared; they disappeared in groups of 3, and the first letter of their name spelled out “SAM”. For example, Sarah Manter, Alex Plot, and Mark Streng. Except, my name starts with a J, and as far as I knew, I was alone in this. 

Since it’s Halloween, no one seems suspicious of me watching “Trick or Treat.” But have you ever wondered if every time you watch a movie, it might change slightly without you noticing? Well, I’ve seen “trick or treat” before, but something seems slightly… off. I don’t know what, but maybe an actor saying a word differently, a thing being moved… And I swear Sam in the movie stared at me. Considering everything else, I might just be on edge. I’m not 100% sure, but I’ll have to pay closer attention when I watch it again.

Anyway, please give me some advice on what to do next.
