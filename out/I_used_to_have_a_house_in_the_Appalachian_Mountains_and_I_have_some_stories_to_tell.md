Recently I've seen creepy stories of mysterious creatures living in the depths of the Appalachian Mountains blow up on TikTok, so I wanted to share some stories I have of when I lived there. 

  
So, to set the scene, I used to have a house on the Maryland side of the Appalachian Mountains. We were pretty much completely stranded there, as the nearest neighbor was around 15 miles away, so we had to either go on huge supply runs to the nearest supermarket which was even farther away, or hunt for food ourselves. Also, I forgot to mention, my mom always dreamt of going into a house or cabin in the deep woods, so we decided to live there for me and my sister's summer. Anyway, we alternated between hunting and going for supply runs. 

Now, I'll start telling the stories.

The first one is when me and my mom went for a hike through the woods and found an abandoned wild west amusement park called "Ghost Town", probably like 20 minutes into the hike.

Once we got there, we got a weird feeling that I cannot physically describe with words. Like it just somehow appeared in front of us. 

 Then probably no more than 15 minutes later we found a huge abandoned hospital.

We never knew it for the rest of our stay, but those 2 buildings were the Ghost Town Village located in North Carolina and the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in West Virginia. 

We started in Maryland, somehow ended up in North Carolina, and then got to West Virginia and got back to Maryland in less than 2 hours.

We stayed surrounded by woods the whole time, not crossing or seeing a single road.

That was just the start of the weird shit that happened.

The next story is when my mom took me and my sister to a supply run, and while we were driving we saw a man with a thick jacket, glasses, a balaclava over his face, and a bicycle helmet trying to hitchhike with his thumb out.

It was the middle of summer.

Me and my sister told my mom to just keep driving but she pulled over in the road and asked the guy 

"Sir, are you okay?" He didn't respond. "Why are you out here dressed like that?"

The man finally spoke, but something was off. His voice didnâ€™t sound like it belonged to him. It was too high, like it was put through a voice changer.

"Ma'am, can I get a ride?" Completely disregarding my mom's question. 

I looked around him and noticed he had no bike, no car, no hiking stick, no backpack, no nothing. Just those clothes.

I whispered to my mom to keep driving and as soon as the man saw that she was trying to drive away, he let out a animalistic inhuman scream and started to run towards us.

My mom floored it to the nearest police station and reported the guy, but they never found him. On our way back to the house, we were on extreme edge. But nothing happened.

Then that night, I woke up to a tapping sound on my window, and woke up to the same man standing straight up with his hands on the glass. I lived on the second floor.

Now, he didn't have his sunglasses on, he also didn't have his eyes. When I noticed it, it immediately fell and when I looked out my window for it, I didn't see anything. No man, no creature, nothing.

Like he just disappeared.

I was so shocked and scared I hid under my covers the rest of the night, even though I was 16 at the time. I peeked my head up occasionally to make sure he never came back.

Then in the morning I told my mom about it, but it's not like she could do anything about it. The police would never find it and my parents weren't going out there. 

This was terrifying, but nothing compared to the next story.

I forgot to mention but we had a dog named Mack, he was a Golden Retriever and was super friendly and helped us retrieve the animal carcasses when we hunted.

One day I was out hunting with my dad, and we killed a couple rabbits and sent Mack to go get them, but we heard him bark, like he was telling us to go to him instead.

We walked over to where he was barking and saw a tree covered with dead, skinned rabbits each with a shark stick through their head and their eyes removed with a weird symbol carved into the tree. 

We were speechless and covered our mouths in shock, and then we heard someone whisper to us.

"Hey guys... come over here."  


We hooked up Mack to his emergency leash and ran as fast as we could to our house. I looked behind me for who whispered to us and saw a man with a huge smile on his face and his eyes as wide as possible for a human to open them staring at me, and then began to run towards us with a knife.

My dad grabbed his hand pistol and shot him in the leg, and he fell to the floor while yelling in pain.

Once we reached the house we called the police and told them about it, and they sent multiple officers to search the area, but found nothing.

Not the rabbits, no blood, no knife, no fingerprints, not even the rabbits we killed.

For the next couple months we stayed in a relatives house.

None of us felt safe anymore. But my dad, the one who shot the crazy man, was the only one who insisted we stay. Said we could defend ourselves. Said it was just another crazy and that we should stay the rest of the summer.

We agreed but said if anything else weird or terrifying happens, we go to our house in the city.

Then, the final story is what made us finally move out.

One Saturday, I woke up and saw my mom missing from the house.

My dad and sister said she was just going on an errand, and that she'll be back in the afternoon.

Afternoon came and she got back.

Nothing else eventful happened that day, until night struck.

We let Mack out, we just thought he was gonna go to the bathroom and come back, but we heard him run away deep into the woods, like he was chasing something.

I don't know why we didn't chase after him even after our creepy encounters before this.

 When he got back, he wasn't energetic. He wasn't acting like him at all. He was mopey, sad, and acting really weird. Normally we would have just assumed he saw something in the woods that made him upset, but after the previous events, we were on edge.

Then when we all fell asleep, I woke up to footsteps coming up the stairs. I peeked out my door and saw Mack. Standing up like a human, his fur grey, his arms longer than they should be, and his head twisted and upright.

His walking wasn't right either. He would walk one step, and his body would flop in the direction he stepped. 

He wasn't walking towards anything either, just roaming the hallway. 

My heart was beating out of my chest and I called my sister, and after calling her 4 times, she finally picked up.

I don't remember anything I said to her, but what I do remember is sneaking behind the thing pretending to be Mack and met up with my sister. Luckily, the rest of my family slept downstairs, so once I met up with my sister, we were able to wake our parents without going past it.

Logically, we stayed in the nearest hotel for the night.

We had to go back and get our stuff though, so we went back to the house and found it trashed.

The food in the fridge was scattered all over the house, and once we got our stuff, we drove away.

I looked back to the house and saw...

The man.

The thing in the winter clothes.

Staring at me.

It was the thing pretending to be Mack.

We drove back to our city house and never stepped foot into woods again.
