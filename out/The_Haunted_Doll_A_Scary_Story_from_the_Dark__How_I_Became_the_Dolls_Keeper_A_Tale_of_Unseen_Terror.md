I never considered myself a superstitious person. Ghost stories, haunted houses, cursed objects — they were all just tales to entertain us around campfires or on stormy nights. But I learned, the hard way, that some things are far more terrifying than any story could ever capture.

It started with a box. A plain, unmarked package left on my doorstep one cold November morning. There was no return address, no note, just a neatly wrapped parcel with my name scrawled across it in an elegant but unfamiliar handwriting. At first, I assumed it was a mistake, a package meant for someone else. But curiosity has a way of overriding reason, so I brought it inside, set it on my kitchen table, and peeled back the paper.

Inside was a doll.

Not the cheerful kind you’d see in toy stores or a child’s bedroom. No, this was something entirely different. Its porcelain face was cracked, as though it had been dropped and hastily repaired. Its eyes — glassy, unblinking — were a vivid, unnatural blue that seemed to follow me no matter where I moved. The doll wore a faded Victorian-style dress, tattered at the hem, and clutched a small, threadbare teddy bear in its tiny hands. There was something off about it, something I couldn’t quite place but felt deep in my bones.

I should have thrown it away then and there. But instead, I set it on a shelf in my living room, thinking nothing more of it.

That night, I awoke to the sound of footsteps.

At first, I thought it was the creaking of the old wooden floors in my house. It was an old place, full of quirks and noises that I’d grown used to over the years. But these weren’t the random creaks of settling wood. They were deliberate, rhythmic, moving closer and closer to my bedroom.

I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. Someone was in my house.

I reached for my phone on the nightstand, my fingers trembling as I dialed 911. But before I could hit the call button, the footsteps stopped. Dead silence filled the house. I strained my ears, waiting for any sign of movement, but there was nothing. After what felt like an eternity, I summoned the courage to get out of bed and check the locks. Everything was secure. No sign of a break-in.

I didn’t sleep much that night.

The next morning, I noticed something strange. The doll wasn’t on the shelf where I’d left it. Instead, it was sitting on my coffee table, its unblinking eyes staring directly at me. A chill ran down my spine. I tried to convince myself that I must have moved it and forgotten, but deep down, I knew better. Still, I placed it back on the shelf and went about my day, trying to shake off the unease that clung to me like a second skin.

But the footsteps returned that night. Louder this time, accompanied by faint whispers that I couldn’t quite make out. I stayed in bed, clutching the covers like a lifeline, my mind racing with every worst-case scenario. And then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. The house fell silent once more.

When I ventured into the living room the next morning, the doll was on the floor, its head turned to face the doorway as though it had been waiting for me. My stomach churned, a sickening wave of dread washing over me. This wasn’t

I decided to get rid of it.

I threw the doll into a box, taped it shut, and drove to the nearest thrift store. The clerk gave me a strange look as I handed it over, but I didn’t care. I just wanted it gone. For the first time in days, I felt a sense of relief, as though a weight had been lifted from my shoulders.

That night, I slept peacefully. No footsteps. No whispers. Just silence.

But the peace didn’t last.

The next morning, the doll was back. Sitting on my kitchen table, its glassy eyes fixed on mine. My breath caught in my throat, and I stumbled backward, nearly knocking over a chair. This couldn’t be happening. It wasn’t possible.

I grabbed the doll and drove to the edge of town, where an old quarry had been turned into a landfill. I hurled the doll as far as I could, watching as it disappeared into the sea of trash below. This time, I was sure it was gone for good.

Or so I thought.

When I returned home, the doll was waiting for me on the front porch.

The doll had crossed a line now. It wasn’t just an eerie object; it was something far worse, something malevolent. I stared at it, my hands trembling as I unlocked the front door. I thought about leaving it out there, abandoning the house altogether, but where would I go? This was my home.

I picked it up with shaking hands and brought it inside, though every fiber of my being screamed not to. I needed to understand what I was dealing with. There had to be a logical explanation. Or so I told myself.

I set the doll on the table and examined it closely. The cracks in its porcelain face seemed deeper, darker, almost like veins spreading beneath its surface. Its dress looked more tattered than before, and the teddy bear in its hands was now missing an eye. But the most unsettling change was its eyes. They weren’t just unblinking anymore. They were alive, shimmering faintly in the dim light, as though something was looking out from within.

I decided to research the doll’s origin. It had to come from somewhere, right? I took photos of it and uploaded them to a few online forums dedicated to antique dolls and paranormal oddities. Within hours, the responses started pouring in. Most were generic, guesses about its age or style. But one message stood out.

It came from a user with no profile picture and a username that was just a random string of numbers. The message read: "Get rid of it. Burn it if you can. Do not keep it in your home. It’s not just a doll."

My stomach churned as I read the words. I replied, asking what they meant, but the user never responded. The message haunted me all day, a seed of fear that grew with every passing hour.

That night, the whispers returned, louder and more distinct. I couldn’t understand the words, but they were undeniably there, circling through the house like a malevolent wind. And then came the laughter — soft, childlike, but twisted in a way that made my skin crawl. It was coming from the living room.

I grabbed a flashlight and crept down the hallway, my heart pounding so loudly I thought it might burst. The light flickered as I entered the room, casting eerie shadows on the walls. The doll was no longer on the table. It was sitting in my armchair, its head tilted slightly, as if it were smiling at me.

My breath caught, and I dropped the flashlight. The room plunged into darkness, and the whispers grew louder, more insistent. I stumbled backward, fumbling for the light switch, but when I finally turned it on, the doll was gone.

The room was empty.

I searched the entire house, every closet, every corner, but it had vanished. Yet I could still feel its presence, like a weight pressing down on me, suffocating and inescapable. I locked myself in my bedroom and stayed awake until dawn, clutching a knife for protection.

The next morning, I found the doll in my bed.

I was unraveling. My mind felt like it was fraying at the edges, each thread pulled loose by the presence of that cursed doll. Every logical thought I clung to had been shredded by the impossible. It wasn’t just my sanity at stake anymore; it felt like my very soul was under siege.

The doll wasn’t inanimate. It wasn’t just a creepy relic with a mysterious origin. It was alive in some way I couldn’t comprehend, and worse, it wanted something from me.

I spent the morning scouring the internet for anything that might help. Stories of haunted dolls weren’t exactly in short supply, but most were urban legends or thinly veiled horror fiction. None of them offered solutions, just warnings to stay away. But I couldn’t stay away; it was too late for that. The doll had already chosen me.

One post caught my eye. It was buried deep in a forum for occult enthusiasts. The user claimed to have encountered a similar doll, one that seemed to move on its own and torment its owner. They mentioned a ritual, a way to banish whatever entity was tied to the object. It was risky, they said, and not guaranteed to work, but it was the only lead I had.

The ritual required salt, candles, and something that bound me to the doll — in this case, the box it had arrived in. I would need to surround the doll with a circle of salt, light the candles at each cardinal point, and chant a specific incantation while focusing all my intent on severing the connection between me and the entity.

It sounded absurd. But absurdity had become my reality.

That night, I prepared for the ritual. I placed the doll in the center of my living room, surrounded it with a thick ring of salt, and positioned the candles as instructed. The doll’s eyes seemed to gleam in the flickering candlelight, as though it knew what I was attempting. I took a deep breath, clutching the box it had arrived in, and began to chant.

At first, nothing happened. The room was eerily silent, the only sound my own shaky voice repeating the incantation. But then the air grew heavy, thick with a presence that made my skin crawl. The flames of the candles flickered violently, casting distorted shadows on the walls. The whispers returned, louder than ever, overlapping and chaotic, filling my head with an unbearable cacophony.

And then, the doll moved.

Its head turned slowly, deliberately, until it was facing me. My voice faltered, the chant dying in my throat as I stared in horror. The whispers coalesced into a single voice — deep, guttural, and inhuman. "You cannot escape me," it said. "You invited me in."

The candles extinguished all at once, plunging the room into darkness. I scrambled backward, clutching the box like a shield. The air was electric, charged with a malevolence that made it hard to breathe. I fumbled for the flashlight I’d left on the floor, my fingers trembling so badly I could barely hold it. When I finally managed to switch it on, the doll was gone.

But I wasn’t alone.

The shadows in the room seemed to shift, coalescing into a form that was both amorphous and distinctly humanoid. It towered over me, its presence oppressive and overwhelming. The voice came again, this time from everywhere and nowhere. "You belong to me now."

Reality itself seemed to ripple, the edges of the room dissolving into darkness. I tried to move, to scream, but my body refused to obey. The entity loomed closer, and for the first time, I saw its face — or rather, the absence of one. It was a void, a swirling chasm of nothingness that pulled at my very essence.

The doll appeared at its feet, its glassy eyes now glowing with a malevolent light. The entity reached out, its shadowy hand closing around me, and the world shattered.

I woke up to the sound of a doorbell.

Disoriented, I stumbled to the front door and found a plain, unmarked package waiting for me. My name was scrawled across it in elegant, unfamiliar handwriting.

Inside was a doll.
