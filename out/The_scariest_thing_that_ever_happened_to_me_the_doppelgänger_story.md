This happened to me about 2 years ago, around late December of 2020. I was 19 around the time. Me and my girlfriend were at my grandparents place having a couple drinks out in the garage until it got too cold to stay out there. It was one of the coldest nights of the year and there was a bad blizzard that night (we live in Canada by the way) We both went back to the house around 2:00 am. She went into my room and I went out in the kitchen to cook something for us in the oven. 


I was on my phone standing alone out in the kitchen when my grandma and my girlfriend both walked out into the kitchen together. It was a bit strange because my grandma is never up that late and it was even stranger that my girlfriend came out at the same time. The first thing my grandma said to me is “don’t go back out there tonight, on a night like this people lose their lives.” I was little bit freaked out because I was just about to head back out to the garage to grab something. I never told anyone I was going back out. My girlfriend and my grandma just stood there staring at me with the weirdest expressions I’ve ever seen. With very unnatural smiles that did seem right. My girlfriend then walked over and gave me a hug. When I grabbed her she was ice cold. I commented about this and when I mentioned how cold she was her expression changed. Her smile faded and she looked up at me with really serious, sad eyes and didn’t say anything. There was something else I noticed too. She smelt like a campfire, an earthy smokey smell. There wasn’t an explanation for this and she didn’t smell like that earlier. I swear at that moment I got chills all over. There was something so off about it all but I couldn’t put my finger on it. My girlfriend whispered in my ear “don’t go outside tonight.” 


She walked back over to my grandma. She stood beside her with her head down and a serious expression while my grandma was still staring at me with that weird fake smile. It was so bizarre I just stood there speechless. The wind began to literally f***ing howl outside. My grandma turned and looked at my girlfriend. “Don’t mess with black magic” she said. “Nothing good is gonna come from it.” My girlfriend didn’t say anything, she continued looking down. I stood there confused. My girlfriend looked up at me. “We have to go now” she said. They both started walking away. My grandma looked back at me for a second. “See you on the flip side” she said with that weird smile. I got another chill through my whole body when she said that. They turned to corner and left the kitchen. 


I stood there for a while. I didn’t know what to make of it all. I decided not to go out to the garage, I’d go out and get my stuff the next morning. I stayed out in the kitchen for another ten minutes until the food was done. I went back into my room with it. My girlfriend was in bed laying down. She got up and we put on a movie. I guess I was quiet because she asked me “what’s wrong?” I told her everything was okay. It took me ten minutes to say something about it because to be honest I was still frightened by it. I turned to her and asked why her and my grandma came out to the kitchen. The second I said that my nose started bleeding. I ran to the bathroom and got something to stop the bleeding. When I went back in the room I told my girlfriend everything. As you can guess she said she never went out the the kitchen and she swore on someone’s life she was in the room the whole time. She also didn’t smell like smoke anymore. We went and woke up my grandma right after and my grandma said the same thing. She actually thought we were trying to mess with her and she didn’t believe me. We were so freaked out after this we had trouble sleeping for the rest of the night. 


The part that really messed my girlfriend up was when I told her about how cold she felt and how she smelt like smoke. The only explanation we could come up with was that maybe if I went outside that night something bad would’ve happened to me. Maybe the spirits of dead relatives watching over me came to me in that form so I wouldn’t be scared and they could get the message through. The last part of it that made sense was the part about the black magic. My girlfriend just got a book about witchcraft from her friend the week prior. My girlfriend never opened to book again after this. She took what was said as a warning. I’ve been thinking about writing this story down for the past two years and my girlfriend encouraged me to finally do it because maybe some else out there had an experience like this. To this day I still get chills thinking about it. Especially the last thing said. “See you on the flip side.”
