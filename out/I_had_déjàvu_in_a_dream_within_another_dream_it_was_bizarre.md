This morning I had one of the undoubtedly weirdest and most confusing sensations of my entire life. I woke up, made my bed, had my coffee, ate a piece of bread, and scrolled through TikTok until it was time to go to work. When I got there, I chatted with a customer waiting for the store to open, completed my Monday tasks, and around 9 am, I woke up again after glancing at the clock.  
  
I woke up and thought to myself, "Was that a dream?" It was VERY real. Why would I dream about being in my normal work routine without any dream-like weirdness? But okay, I made my coffee, ate a piece of bread, and spent time on TikTok until it was time to leave home. I repeated the same actions from the dream (which made me reflect a lot later on). I arrived at work, and I remember there was a black Civic parked in front of the store – a customer waiting for it to open. I interacted with him and told him the store would open soon.  
  
About 1.5 hours into my shift, following my Monday routine of cleaning shelves and labeling new items, my boss approached me and said it was time for my break. I looked at the computer clock, and it was 8:30 am (the exact time as I write this account while having my coffee). But this time, I didn't wake up. At that moment, I wasn't even thinking about the dream – it had passed, and I had other things on my mind to start the week.  
  
To enter the break room, there's an access room with a supervisor's password. When I tried entering my password, it was invalid. I attempted a colleague's password, and it was also invalid. I found this strange and was heading back to my boss's office when I woke up again. This time was different – I woke up in panic, completely shocked, unable to move. It felt like I was in a loop. I lay in bed, thinking about everything that had happened for 15 minutes, skipped my coffee and TikTok routine, and went to work only thinking about this experience.  
  
When I arrived, the black Civic was parked there again. Seeing it gave me a huge, chilling shiver and a warmth rising from my legs to my chest. I repeated exactly the same steps as in the previous two dreams, everything unfolded exactly the same except for spending more time in bed and missing breakfast. After finishing cleaning and labeling new products, my boss told me to go for a break. The weird thing is that everything happened exactly the same. It's a strange sensation, man. It's almost 9 am now, and I've gone through the two stages where I woke up in the previous dreams. If I wake up again, I'll write the same account but in much more shock.  
  
Has anyone experienced something like this? I'm still in shock, man, because it felt so real. I remember the physical sensations and the warmth I felt. I remember the water I drank, had all the convictions that it was real, just like I do now. I remember every minute in detail when I believed I was awake, and all of this repeated itself.  
  
Am I going crazy? I believe there must be a scientific and logical explanation for this, and it's not anything beyond reality.
