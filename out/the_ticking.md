It started with the silence.

I moved into the apartment at 42 Sycamore Terrace after everything fell apart. It wasn’t ideal—second-floor, small, the walls thin—but it was cheap, and that was all I could afford. The landlord, an elderly man named Mr. Thatcher, was odd. He never looked you in the eye, always looking somewhere just past you, like he was seeing something no one else could. But I wasn’t looking for company. I was just looking for quiet. And when I walked into that empty apartment, with its worn carpet and faded paint, I thought I’d found it.

At first, it was everything I needed: empty space, undisturbed time. No one cared if I stayed inside all day. I spent hours with my books, listening to the hum of my refrigerator and the occasional creak of the pipes. It was peaceful. For the first few days, I thought it might finally be the escape I needed from everything—my ex, the mess I’d made of things, the weight of life itself.

But then, it started.

It was subtle at first—a quiet, rhythmic sound, like a clock ticking. I didn’t think much of it. The apartment was old. Old buildings creak, pipes thrum. But as the days passed, the ticking didn’t fade—it grew louder, clearer. Every time I sat still, every time I closed my eyes, I could hear it, like it was coming from inside the walls, the floors, the ceiling, everywhere. I tried to ignore it, but it gnawed at me, a constant reminder that something was wrong.

It was on the fourth night that I first felt the weight of it. The ticking had grown unbearable. It was in my head now, syncing with my heartbeat, a slow, deliberate pulse. The silence between the ticks felt wrong, too sharp, like the space between breaths, stretched too thin.

I needed to find the source of it. I needed to know what it was.

I started with the obvious—the clock. There was one in the living room, an old grandfather clock in the corner, its brass pendulum still and unmoving. But when I checked it, it wasn’t running. No hands turning, no ticking. It had been dead for years.

The sound didn’t stop.

I walked through the apartment again—checked every room, every closet, the attic, the basement. I even tapped on the walls, hoping to find a loose pipe or a broken vent. Nothing. No clock. No source.

It wasn’t until the next day that I started noticing something else: the apartment had begun to feel... wrong. There was a heaviness in the air, a suffocating sense of waiting, as if the place itself was alive and aware of my every movement. And when I moved around, the sound of my footsteps seemed to echo strangely, like I wasn’t alone.

I stopped sleeping.

I couldn’t. Every time I tried to lie down, the ticking was there. It would surround me, infiltrating my thoughts, my dreams. Even when I went into the bathroom to escape, I could hear it coming from the mirror, from the pipes beneath the sink. It was driving me mad. I felt like I was being stalked by it, like something was circling closer and closer.

Then I met her—Lena. She lived two floors up, and we ran into each other in the hallway one night. She looked... tired, but not in the way someone looks after a long day. She had this haunted look, like she hadn’t been able to sleep for months. When she spoke, her voice was distant, like she was speaking from far away.

“I hear it too,” she said, when I mentioned the ticking. “You’ll get used to it.”

I didn’t respond right away, too startled by her bluntness. “You’ve heard it?”

She nodded, glancing nervously at the walls around us. “It doesn’t stop. You can’t make it stop. It’s just... it’s part of the building.” She shivered. “It always starts with the ticking.”

I felt a chill run through me. “What do you mean? What is it?”

Lena hesitated. “Nobody knows. We’ve all heard it, but nobody talks about it. It’s not safe to talk about it. If you do, it comes closer. It knows you’re listening.”

I laughed nervously. “You’re not making sense.”

She didn’t seem to care. She just stared at me with wide, unblinking eyes, like she was looking right through me. “You’ll see. You’ll feel it. When it gets too loud, it won’t matter where you go. You’ll be listening for it, waiting for it. And that’s when it takes you.”

“Take me?” I repeated, but she was already backing away, retreating down the hall without another word.

I never saw her again.

The next night, the ticking was unbearable. It wasn’t just a sound anymore—it was a presence. I felt it pressing into my ears, crawling beneath my skin. The air was thick with it. Every time I tried to close my eyes, I could see it—an oppressive weight, dark and formless, suffocating the space around me.

I couldn’t stand it anymore. I started pacing the apartment, desperate to escape it. I banged on the walls. I shouted at the ceiling. I even tried to talk to it.

Nothing.

And then, just when I thought I might lose my mind, the ticking stopped. Completely. No gradual fade, no slowing down—just gone.

And in the silence that followed, I realized something.

It wasn’t the ticking that had been driving me mad. It was the waiting. The endless, suffocating waiting, like something was about to happen—but nothing ever did. Nothing ever changed. The silence that followed the ticking felt worse than the sound itself. It felt like a void, like I was floating in it, unable to escape.

I waited for days, but nothing came. No sound, no shadow, no footsteps in the hall. Just... silence.

And then, one night, I went to bed.

The ticking started again.

But this time, it wasn’t from the walls. It was inside my head.
