Last night was my 10th wedding anniversary. I’d like to say it was a joyous occasion. But I can’t, in all good faith, say that without being a dirty lowdown prevaricator. That’s somebody who lies like the rug. Very dirty, dirty rug at that.

Things have been pretty rough the last 10 years. I think it’s mostly because I’m easy to manipulate. At least that’s what I think my therapist has been implying. 

Did your mom tell you you better shop around?Because mine didn’t.

How rough were things in my marriage you ask? 

So rough that by the end of our second year together Janice was taking multiple prescriptions to control her bipolar, narcissistic thing, anxiety, depression and drinking problem.

Goddamn medicine chest look like Walgreens.

It was no small victory getting Janice to the psychiatrist.

“Are you saying I’m not drop dead gorgeous and that men aren’t always showing interest?”

It was like a root canal but once the shrink saw what we were dealing with, out came the script pad. And therapy, lotsa that.

We had our ups and downs but I guess I never thought I was in Janice’s class. Me and my therapist were addressing that issue for the last eight years but after last night, I just don’t know.

Last night, Janice, who does what she likes to call dating around, which is essentially doing God knows what with whichever of her myriad friends that she’s always collecting like toys in the attic, last night she comes home about 9pm smelling like a distillery and;

A. Kisses me right on the mouth.

B. Puts her hand behind her back and with a mischievous grin says;

C. Pick.

so I pick and she opens her hand with a theatrical flourish and that mischievous evil grin again pops in,  and she says, “take one.”

Janice had two pills, one blue and one red.

I got the red one. She placed it in my hand.

I asked her what was it.

“It’s like ecstasy but times 700,000,000.“

“That doesn’t sound very good I say.”

“Lindsay, this marriage just isn’t working. All I think about is porn and cheating on you any damn time I feel like it with a belly full of vodka at that

But my girlfriend got a hold of these pills through her new shrink and she said it patched up her and her husband after ferocious domestic abuse and now they’re like two peas in a pot and they don’t even eat therapy anymore.“

“I don’t know.“

And and here’s the rub. Although my mother tried her damnedest to raise a fool she failed. So, that when I was confronted with the pharmaceutical challenge on my 10th wedding anniversary. I knew what to do.

“You wanna drink,“ I asked.

“Do you have mommy issues?

Could be pretty snarky when she wanted to specially when she was sober or just getting her buzz on. Yeah that anti-alcohol medication that shit don’t work

So while I was fixing drinks, I put the red pill in the cabinet in a napkin, and I took a multivitamin and then I poured two tumblers full of vodka.

I handed her the drink, kissed her hard on the mouth and said bottoms up

Janice took the pill and washed it down with about 2 ounces of vodka without flinching.

“Now it’s your turn”

I obliged. Janice knotted and drank another 3 ounces of vodka.

I took a small sip for my part. I really much preferred the weed pen, but I never told Janice or my therapist about it because there’s something so odd sometimes and the way my therapist Steve acts when Janice is nearby. I could almost feel they are in cahoots at our couples therapy.

Janice told me to come close she said tonight is the night that is all about new beginnings and the kiss held and it metamorphic into a lot of things and I hadn’t done in years but before it was over, caught up in the rapture, I went to kiss Janice’s neck and that’s when I felt it.

Scales I’m talking serpentine scales right under her jaw that weren’t there before we got into bed kissing while she was Trippin and she kept saying “this is not your father‘s Cadillac.”

My face felt it first but within a few minutes when we were disrobed, that’s when I realized it was almost like the literal autistic translation of death by 1000 paper cuts. All over my body.

As Janice asserted her dominance, the pain worsened. Now it wasn’t just my face anymore. It’s my arms, my legs, my stomach, my feet. Like being attacked by the sandpaper people.

Janice began hissing and clawing, and the whole thing to send it into the simple fact that her skin was covered in scaly eruptions. Her eyes were almost yellow. She was definitely drooling, and I could not get her off me.

“It’s ssssssso much better like thissssss.”

Two truths and no lie.

Truth number one is I passed out from fright.

Truth number two is I don’t think Janice noticed because when I woke up this morning, I had no problems I could not even dream.

Janice was gone. The apartment was ransacked and I have a little red marks and welts that were bloody all over my body.

“Went to get more candy. You better be home when I get back loverboy.”

I scratched my bald head, trying to figure out this agreed to puzzle.

Something fell to my bare feet. I scratch some more

More stuff falls to the floor and it looks like scales. I run to the bathroom mirror and I say, “Thisssss suckssssss,” with a literally forked tongue.

According to my reflection, I seem to be turning into some type of snake like reptile. And Janice is always good about coming back to cause more trouble so I only got a couple hours now I don’t know what kind of condition I’m gonna be in a couple of hours



Anybody ever come across anything like this before big fat pill too little polkadots oh shit I still got one in the drawer. The one I didn’t take I don’t know what the fuck I’m gonna do. Let me go slither away and I can find a scientist and that’s when I had the desire to eat a rodent. 

I don’t want to eat rats. I got to sssslip sssslide away now. I got to. I got to.
