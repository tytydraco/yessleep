“What do you mean, ‘you know’?”

Gracie sniffed as she kept her head down.  “This was our house.  Or it’s not…not really, but it looks like some nightmare version of it.  Parts of it familiar, parts of it twisted or taken from other places.”  Her hands trembled as she dry-washed them over and over in her lap, the rasping of her skin seeming to fall into rhythm with the short, panicked breaths she was taking.  “It’s what happens when it comes to a place and infects it.  Gordon calls it the Hollow House.”

I stared at her, speechless for a moment, my brain filled with so many questions I wasn’t sure where to start.  Seeing her like this, I wanted to be as gentle as I could, but I needed to understand what was happening and why she was so terrified.  Still, maybe it would be easier if we just left first and then talked about it.  Putting my hand on top of hers, I stopped their motion and gave them a squeeze.  

“If you want, and you feel able, we can leave and talk about this somewhere else.  Mr. Holliman should be back soon and we can wait outside while I call him to come on.”

She opened her eyes and gave me a sad smile.  “No, you don’t understand, Clint.  I don’t think it will let us out.  Not this time, not yet anyway.  It’s not a coincidence that Gordon brought us to a place this thing is inhabiting.  And I’m assuming it didn’t start looking like this after he left?”  I could see some dim, desperate hope in her face, but I had to be honest.  This was too important.

“No.  No, it was like this when we came in.  And then he said he needed to leave to get your medicine and us some food.”  My tongue felt thick in my mouth.  “He trapped us in here, didn’t he?”

A new tear ran down her cheek.  “I’m afraid so.  Go check the doors and windows, but I’m guessing we’re stuck until…well, I don’t really know.”

I did as she asked, and she was right.  There were two doors out of the place, and they were both sealed shut, the wood of the door and the plaster of the walls running together like melted wax turned to stone.  Same for the windows, which wouldn’t even scratch when I broke a chair against it.  Sweaty, angry and terrified, I went back into the living room where she sat on the sofa staring over at the rocking horse.

“You…you were right.  No cell service, no way out.  That motherfucker has trapped us here.  But why?  I felt like something has been off about him, but what is all of this?  Why would he do this to us?”

When she looked at me, her face was a complex mixture of sadness and anger, and though I knew it wasn’t directed at me, it still made my heart pound a bit harder when I heard the cold rage in her voice.  “He’s doing it because he thinks it will give us back our son.”

I think I knew I loved Gordon the first time I met him.  We met outside a bookstore, you know.  Not one of these commercial things that are dying off now, but a real bookstore with a love for books and words and knowledge.  Forgotten, out-of-print books that you couldn’t find most places, filled with stories and ideas and truths that most people have never known.  I’d always been drawn to those kinds of secret truths, and it was when I was rifling through bargain tables outside, looking for…something special and new…that I found Gordon. 

He was older than me, but he had this light, this energy.  Part of it was his intellect, but more than that was his passion.  I could tell that he was nervous talking to me, but he was excited too, not just because I think he liked me as much as I did him, but because he had found someone to talk to about the things that, at least to him, really mattered.

It started off with us talking about interesting books we had read, then us having lunch and talking about ourselves and our interests.  Over the next couple of weeks, he told me more and more about his more exotic social circles and beliefs, and to my surprise, I found myself more drawn to him the deeper we went.  He introduced me to the concept of the Dreamer—it’s what we call the thing we all now serve—and together we found it and…after some discussion and a developing urgent need to help Gordon…we entered into an agreement with it.  To find these invaders, these nightmares, and exorcise them, capture them, before they are free in the world to do more harm.

And for some time, life was very good.  We both had a thirst for the extraordinary, and our work for the Dreamer gave us a steady stream of excitement and new understanding of how things really work.  It was terrifying at times, but we never faltered or failed—we had the blessing of our new benefactor and we were both smart enough to follow every instruction perfectly, so we always captured our quarry and fulfilled our duties.  That was one of our mistakes, of course.  We became arrogant and complacent, assuming that we could not fail because we had yet to do so.

But back then, we were so happy all the time.  We had each other and our work, and the sharing of our secret life with each other made everything even more special.  We made a home and married.  Two years later, I had our child.  We named him Nicholas, after my father.

Things were so good, in fact, that I began to worry.  Something had to go wrong, didn’t it?  Either we would learn that there was more to the Dreamer than the good intentions it professed, or Gordon’s health would go down, or something…I tried not to share my concerns with Gordon, but I think he saw the shadow growing in my heart.  At the time I felt guilty, like my worry was a symptom of me not being grateful enough for the magical life we had.  A life that we were so perfect for that we could face down evil again and again and win every time.

Until, of course, we lost.

It was on a ranch in Wyoming.  An old man had been overtaken and his younger brother had enough contacts to track down non-traditional solutions, which ultimately lead him to us.  They were a nice family.  I remember the old man’s daughter and son-in-law were there.  They had twin baby girls, but they’d flown up to the ranch and took care of him while various doctors and medicine men came and went trying to find a way to bring him away from the strange, dark path he was headed down.  

By the time we reached him, he’d been locked in his bedroom for nearly a week.  Not by his choice, but his brother’s.  You see, he tried to stab his own daughter the last time he was free.  The uncle went in with a couple of the ranch hands and held him down when we were ready, tying him to the bed and only leaving us alone when we promised to call if anything went amiss.  We reassured them that we had done this many times and that everything was well in hand.  

We were such arrogant fools. 

When the thing inside him escaped, it didn’t touch me or Gordon at all.  Instead it trapped us in that room while it slaughtered the entire family and everyone else outside, even the little babies sleeping in a spare room.  We could hear all of it.  The screaming and the ripping and, worse of all, its terrible, terrible laughter.

And when it was done?  The door swung open and the hot stink of what it had done across that house poured in.  I…we burned the house and everything in it.  It was long gone, and there was no use in leaving some trace that could tie us to the slaughter of an entire family.  We went home by backroads, stopping periodically to cry and scream and assure each other that we were done with it, with all of it.

It was just talk, of course, and we both knew it.  I wouldn’t risk Gordon getting sick again, and he wouldn’t stop if I wanted to continue.  Even beyond that, our work with the Dreamer had become our lives, our whole identity.  What were we without it?  How did we matter?  

It took two days to get back home, and by then we’d stopped with the tears and reassurances.  We were instead talking about how we’d be more careful going forward.  Not make any mistakes.  That we had too much to lose—not just our exciting life, but each other and our sweet boy.  I held Nicholas as we road back from my mother’s house, and I felt some shame that my first panic thoughts of loss had only been about Gordon and the Dreamer, and not him.  He was so small and precious and helpless, and how would he fair in this world if we died on one of these trips?

Squeezing him tight, I resolved to talk more to Gordon about everything the next morning.  We would try to strike a new bargain with the Dreamer, one where we found a way to still help people without being at such personal risk.  It might be hard and frightening, but we needed to find a better path forward to keep our family safe.  

And like a fool, I entered our home with a degree of comfort and confidence that, though the next few days might be difficult, we would get through it and come out the other side together and whole.  Because, despite everything we had done and seen, I still ignorantly believed I knew how things worked, and I labored under the illusion that we were somehow special and safe, uniquely capable of staring into the face of these horrors without real danger.  We had seen horrors from another world and an entire family slaughtered, but *we* were still safe and standing.  Sure we were.

So we walked into the trap that had been laid blindly.  Carried our son in there.  Because we couldn’t fathom the one thing that should have been obvious from the start.  The idea that should have terrified us from the first time we confronted one of these creatures.  That the thing that had crawled from the old man’s body and made us listen as it butchered his whole family?
