The snow fell silently, a thick, suffocating shroud that blanketed the tiny rural town of Black Springs. My cottage sat at the edge of the village, surrounded by dense, snow-laden forest. The trees formed a natural barrier, their gnarled limbs twisting together and casting shadows even in the brightest daylight. At night, the forest became an endless void, its silence heavy and full of unspoken threats. I’d come here to escape the chaos of my past—a desperate bid for sobriety. But the quiet town harboured its own darkness, one that mirrored my own in ways I never could have imagined.

Earlier that day, a moment of weakness had led me to the liquor store. I bought the bottle, a heavy, shameful reminder of the life I’d tried to leave behind. Back in my small kitchen, the air felt thick with tension as I twisted off the cap. The scent of whiskey hit me, sweet and intoxicating, pulling me back to the haze of late-night parties and the allure of temporary oblivion. My hands trembled as I approached the sink.

Shadow, my black cat, watched me from atop the fridge. His green eyes glinted with an intensity that almost seemed human, as if he understood the gravity of what I was about to do. His tail flicked, and he tilted his head, waiting. With a deep, shaky breath, I tipped the bottle and let the amber liquid pour out. It swirled down the drain, a final goodbye to the life I was trying to leave behind. Shadow let out a soft, approving purr, then jumped down to rub against my leg, his warmth a small comfort.

I thought that would be the end of it. But as night fell, the darkness made itself known.

Later that evening, I curled up in the living room with a cup of herbal tea, trying to calm the storm inside me. The snow continued to fall, blanketing everything in a suffocating hush. Shadow sat by the window, staring out into the woods, his ears twitching at every creak and groan of the old house. The cottage felt too quiet, the kind of silence that presses in on you, amplifying your fears.

Then the old clock radio in the kitchen crackled to life, making me jump. It shouldn’t have turned on by itself, and my heart thudded as I listened to the song that began to play: *“Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)”* by Eurythmics. The opening notes were distorted and warped, but unmistakable. It was the song that had been the soundtrack to so many of my wild nights, playing in clubs thick with smoke and electric energy. Hearing it here, in this isolated place, felt like a cruel joke. A reminder of everything I was trying to escape.

I rushed into the kitchen and yanked the radio’s plug from the wall. The music cut off abruptly, leaving only the echo of my ragged breathing. Shadow had followed me, his back arched and fur bristling. I could feel the fear thickening in the room, an invisible presence pressing in on us.

That’s when I heard it: *Tap. Tap. Tap.*

It came from the living room window, deliberate and patient. The forest pressed up against that side of the house, and I imagined something out there, hidden among the trees, watching and waiting. My mouth went dry. I backed away, whispering to myself, “It’s just the wind.”

But Shadow didn’t believe me. He hissed, his tail puffed up, and bolted under the couch. The tapping moved, louder now, coming from the back of the house. I fumbled for my phone, but the screen stayed black—dead battery. A knock echoed through the house, deep and menacing, as if something was demanding to be let in.

I crept to the front door, every muscle tense. My hand hovered over the knob as another knock came, harder this time. I yanked the door open, hoping for a neighbour or a lost traveller, but the porch was empty. Snow whirled through the air, erasing any sign of footprints. The forest loomed, dark and forbidding, just beyond the edge of the yard.

I closed the door, locking it tight, but dread washed over me. The scent of whiskey curled through the air, and when I turned back to the kitchen, my heart stopped. The bottle of Jameson’s sat on the counter, full and taunting, as though I had never emptied it. A note was stuck to the glass, the words jagged and ominous: *Drink me. Escape your pain.*

My hands shook, panic flooding my veins. How was this possible? The bottle was a physical manifestation of my addiction, a reminder of the darkness that refused to let me go. A voice, cold and insidious, whispered in my ear, “Drink. Escape.”

Shadow emerged from his hiding place, his eyes wide and wild. He knew—he sensed the danger creeping into our sanctuary. Desperation fuelled my resolve. I grabbed the bottle and hurled it at the shadowy figure that had begun to coalesce in the corner of the room. The glass shattered, whiskey spilling across the floor. The figure recoiled, its form flickering and dissolving into the darkness.

Exhausted and terrified, I sank to the floor. Shadow leapt into my lap, purring softly, his small body a source of comfort. But the night was far from over. The tapping grew louder, and I felt a cold draft, as if a window had been opened. I sat up, heart pounding, and there he was—a tall, gaunt figure with hollow eyes, standing in the doorway. His smile was a chilling, toothless grin.

“You can’t escape,” he whispered, his voice a raspy, mocking echo. “We’re always here, waiting.”

I screamed, kicking out with all the force I could muster. My foot connected with his shins, and he stumbled back, cursing. I scrambled to the edge of the bed, but the door was locked, trapping me inside. The man’s laughter was a twisted melody, echoing through the room. “You can’t run,” he taunted. “We’re part of you.”

The room grew darker, the flickering flames in the fireplace casting distorted shadows across the walls. The man advanced, his form warping and twisting. I was paralysed with fear.

Suddenly, Shadow leaped at the figure, biting and clawing with a ferocity I’d never seen. The man howled, swatting at the small, determined cat. But Shadow was relentless, his claws tearing into the darkness. The man stumbled, weakened by the attack. I seized the moment, grabbing a heavy candlestick from the nightstand and swinging it with all my strength. It connected with a sickening crack, and the man’s form shattered, dissolving into the shadows.

Silence descended. The oppressive darkness retreated, and I was alone again. I sank to the floor, clutching Shadow, my protector, who now lay panting but triumphant beside me.

The first rays of dawn pierced through the curtains, casting a soft, ethereal glow over the snow outside. The world seemed peaceful, almost serene, but I knew better. The forest loomed beyond the window, thick and still, but filled with unseen threats. The darkness was still out there, lurking, waiting for its chance to return.

Shadow curled up beside me, purring contentedly. He was more than just a pet—he was my guardian, my companion in this battle. As I sat there, catching my breath, a familiar melody drifted through the air: *“Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This).”* This time, it was coming from somewhere deep in the forest, a haunting echo that promised the fight was far from over.

I knew I had to stay vigilant. The battle with the darkness was never truly over, but for now, I was still standing. And that, I realised, was a victory in itself.
