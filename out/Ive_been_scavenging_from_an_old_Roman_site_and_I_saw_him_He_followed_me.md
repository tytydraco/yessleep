I'm writing this post to give a short summary of what the hell has been happening for the past few hours, in a bid to both keep my mental sanity intact and hope that someone will find more info about this. If anything were to happen this would at least be the best way to explain everything to my parents. Please tell them to run away from this town, for it is likely too dangerous to stay there anymore.  
  
The main point you have to know is that I've liked history since I was a child, and in particular a trip to the field I did in fourth grade led me to the discovery of the beauty of archaeology. Touching something which used to be part of someone else's life thousands of years ago made me always feel like I was reconnecting to this person, feeling it's same sense of touch when you may handle a broken vase, and the case of the object itself particularly beautiful, you can submerge yourself in the thousands of thoughts and meanings carried by either a painted figure or geometrical shapes and motifs.  
  
One of several problems stems usually from both a lack of patience and time, for the energy required for excavating is proportional to the amount of bureaucracy and rubber stamping to deal with; though the main issue still remains the low pay of this profession. I will just say that this thing in particular led me down to a path of forbidden temptations which was too much to resist.  
  
If only I knew what it would have led me into.  
  
The field of archaeology is beautiful, and in some cases it even provides you with a few cards up your sleeve, mainly involving any easy access to any archive with a university Card usually more than enough to use as a passepartout. The same can also be said for access to many websites on the internet as long as you fancy yourself as a teacher. Combine all of this with an academic formation and way of thinking and you can get an idea of how the area you live in used to be thousands of years ago.  
  
It was in this way that I found out that there was indeed a forgotten ancient city in a 20-kilometer range from my hometown; and although it cannot be considered as forgotten since it has been catalogued by my country and have been researching activities there almost nobody knew of its existence. Even typing the original place of the village the first thing shown on Google result was a local restaurant, and on YouTube there were only a couple of 360p videos of older guys from 15 years ago rambling about the town's lack of interest about the site together with slideshows of photos of black and white Greek coins. Google Maps showed from above a sort of pentagonal shape from above, but not much else apart from a ten-year old signboard with a few info in the middle of nowhere.  
  
It was a sad thing, really. A village which was born in the wake of the Greek colonization, prospering in the Roman times only to be later abandoned when the visigoths razed the land, with the descendants of its refugees barely knowing of its existence; a place silently hidden and destroyed by intensive cultivations of grapes and other vegetables:a majority of its cyclopic walls and towers had been dismembered for the purpose of using those stone materials to mark borders among cultivated lots and the most visible storage areas and tombs had already ravaged and left empty. Almost nothing apparently was left standing, and yet there's when I had my chance to step in.  
  
The real treasures were below the surface and many of those artifacts would be ripe for the taking once the seeding season was over, for the use of motor hoes across those lands would push lower layers of terrain to the surface, and although they would shatter the vases underneath it was still the quickest way to get to a thousand grand with almost zero resources apart from some gloves and a small shovel.  
  
The initial plan relied on a few studies conducted by documents about the place from the local university, which essentially relied on following the outline of the walls which could still be seen on Google maps, and that's what I, together with my very reluctant brother, set out to do. And indeed its skepticism was the biggest enemy in the first three days of research where we found nothing, constantly on the brink of giving up also as to avoid arising too much suspicion from the other farmers in the area; and that was it until the fourth day.  
  
We hit our jackpot: an isolated area near an intact stretch of walls littered with thousands of pieces of vases and terracotta. We gathered as much stuff as we could and if I could I would also publish some photos; touching with your hand eye watering geometrical motifs you could only see in books is really something else. We found every sort of diagonals, eyes, human figures, and even a few writings about health and prosperity in ancient Greek, promptly put into our bags to be shipped to the black market for hundreds of bucks.  
  
That's how it went for a month, where we only changed our modus operandi from using a car to switching to a bike halfway through our path as to be as silent as possible, for it was still private property and we didn't have the means to push it to a court of justice. The second unwritten rule was to stop at sunset since working with torches would have given our position immediately. The only thing we had to be really careful of were overall the sounds of the machineries working near the site, which were the trickiest elements for a whim of wind could push very distant sounds to make them feel closer than they were. Every time we could hear the humming of the lawn movers from nearby fields they could have been 200 meters or 200 kilometers away from where we were; it however was a bit eerie as we noticed at some point that it continued even in weekends and when the period of sowing was over.  
  
The other noises had stopped on our second week and yet that only farmer would be the sole exception to absolute silence; an otherwise ghastly companion to a landscape often characterized by a tenuous sunlight and an orange to gray light mist. It didn't help that we operated right in front of the remains of the walls not too far from a breach created to divide the two agricultural fields. The problem with this barrier was that it essentially covered the view from its other side since it was a full height of 5 meters and topped with smaller trees growing on top of it.  
  
In retrospect, we probably ignored those signs due to us getting accustomed over time to those sounds, plus this whole thing had filled us with greed and made us so laser focused that we missed many blatantly obvious details, like the miraculous constant absence of the owner of that part of land (or even nearby ones, for that matter) despite our constant and daily search and use of the same routes with the same car - such an amateurish excavation meant that we couldn't afford proper transportation systems - and thus deviations - since the car wouldn't have lasted without a proper asphalt ground and in that area it was the only one available. It was foolish to operate without a plan in that way, but to my defense a better schedule couldn't have included what had happened either.  
  
Today it was day number 21 of our daily routine to loot the place and strip it bare, and I can even recall that it was 18.15 of a late afternoon in the current month of August, with both of us exhausted after a whole day of digging, which at that point was also getting tiring, for the fragments would get smaller and smaller and we would have to dig into the ground since the surface had already been cleaned up.  
  
The reddish mist had very quickly filled the area and the motor hoe was still going on in the distance, a now familiar thing which sounded comforting in the midst of the eerie atmosphere. In that moment as we stopped our research for the day I saw for the first time that in that field there were the remains of a small tower, a thing which I somehow missed for all that time and had also been hidden under a layer of tree branches. It did make sense since we were close to the edges of those fortifications but I had never really given this thought too much weight.  
  
While my brother stopped to check his phone I managed to wiggle my way through the bushes to find a sort of external staircase I climbed my way to the top and I started at the surroundings: that atmosphere made it look like one of those old-style Disney movies with the boundaries of things slightly altered by the all-encompassing mist. After staring for a full five minutes the sound brought me back to my senses, and I instinctively turned my head towards the sound when I saw something in the distance.  
  
It wasn't very distinct because of the fog, but I could see it was some 300 meters from our spot. I could not see anything else about it apart from the fact that it was humanoid, but I could immediately see that one thing was extremely wrong. It was as if it were drinking from a pumping water station for the plants, which was apparently the source of the noise, and yet that thing seemed bloated like a tick, its figure surrounded by a black liquid on which hundreds of flies were feasting upon.  
  
Once I saw that thing it took me the first thing that took me by surprise was that the sound simply stopped, and when it happened that thing turned its body towards me started walking and waddling towards my direction, making the most horrible sound I had ever heard. It was as if for every step it took something of that body was breaking apart, hardly carrying the weight of its body, but it was when it started walking faster and gaining speed that panic really started kicking in. It all went down very quickly from there.  
  
I jumped down 8 meters, almost injuring myself if it weren't from the soft ground underneath, went down the bastion to see my brother visibly worried as he probably saw my pale face or the fall I just made, but I didn't lose time to tell him with animated gestures to get away from that place; and yet that wasn't even enough time to explain.  
  
It indeed came in less than two minutes as we turned our heads to the noise getting stronger and stronger as it passed along the length of the other side of the wall to finally reach that passage, revealing itself at us. And it was horrible. A two-meter tall mockery of a human form, its legs had their muscles and bones broken apart and separated so that a gap could be seen between the two, the arms and legs were dark, filled with holes infested by larvae and festering among the few red parts resembling injuries. Its face was a twisted nightmare, where a mix of darkened skin and pieces of blisters surrounded a pair of vitreous and white eyes without pupils, completed with a jaw half detached from its place, filled with yellow teeth. 

It was a decaying body alive, filled with nothing other than hatred and it headed towards us reaching us with its stench of decaying flesh and with its wobbling swollen belly striped by lines of dark red water. And it smiled as it kept laborously breathing, yet heading towards us with an unnatural speed.  
  
I ran away as quickly as I could, but at the horrible cost of leaving my brother behind, and I could do nothing as it picked up his body above the ground and simply ripped it in half like a breadstick, gulping his fresh blood by slurping his insides as if it were seafood. I watched in horror as the last thing I saw of my brother was the incredulous face stuck at the time of his death and that monster vomiting the contents of his belly in a mixture of disgusting putridity on the ground, looking at me with twisted excitement as I used my bike to run as far as I could to my car, haunted by the visions of that thing which seemed to be behind every tree, and I headed home at high speed, even getting involved in two missed accidents.  
  
It has now been two hours since this happened, and it's 20:30. I had been thinking about calling the police on my entire way home, and in the end I had to despite all my doubts about this story, because that thing has broken inside my house. It followed me. It's coming for me and even though the police said it was on its way now it might be too late, for the monster is inside my house a couple of rooms away from me.  
  
It started when I saw it and its eyes outside of my backyard twenty minutes ago and it immediately spotted me back. He even put on a show as it effortlessly took down a nearby light pole and chewed on its cables, leaving me without electricity forcing me to write from my phone; and right now it's inside and somehow it is temporarily mesmerized by the collection of our pieces of vases. I don't know if there's a connection between the two things but I could not care less now. This has stopped it for a short while but I know that in the meantime it has been tampering with my water supply since I can smell rancid from the faucets of my kitchen and bathroom.  
  
I will leave after this message has been sent by trying to leave the gas open and lighting up a match so that no one else will suffer the same fate of meeting that bastard. Some places have been abandoned for a reason, and for many of them it is better to leave them that way.
