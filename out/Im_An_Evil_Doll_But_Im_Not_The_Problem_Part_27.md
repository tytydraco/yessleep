"Are you sure about this?", I ask Alex. 

The question is academic at best. The chaos around us gathers bodies and creatures like a growing storm. 

I want to talk about a few things before I describe our first steps into this paranormal minefield. 

To say I've forgotten what it's like to be human isn't quite right. I've done everything I can to try and keep some spark of that within me. 

But, like they say, it's the little things. 

I feel, fragile. Every gust of wind across my skin reminds me of the delicate network of veins keeping me going. Every heart palpitation as I see a traveller get taken down, reminds me what it's like to really feel. Horror, fear, every wilted flower in the terror rainbow. 

"Punch, you with us?", Leo asks. 

"Yeah, just getting my sea legs back I guess.", I reply. 

"I can do this. If bullets can't hurt me, nothing can hurt me.", Alex assures us. 

The look on her face breaks my heart. She's proud, borderline happy. For all the torture her body has been put through, she's still just one in a long line of kids forced into a war they had nothing to do with. 

"I wish there was some other way.", Sveta laments. A look of shame on her face. 

"No use crying over spilled milk. It's go time. Alex, after you.", Leo says. 

Directly in front of us is a block-wide swath of massive, quadrupedal things.  Tree-bark skin, and large, intelligent, squid-like eyes are their most prominent features. 

Each stands twelve feet high, they have an herbivore's temperament. They circle and stomp, trying to keep smaller, more aggressive creatures at bay. 

Alex wades in with a confidence that people tend to lose once they become an adult. 

I don't know what we expected. Sending her in was a shot in the dark taken with our eyes closed. A plan based on the ramblings of a mentally tortured child. 

A stray leg collides with the side of her head, she's dazed as a piece of skull tears itself free. 

For a moment, she stays on her feet. She gives us a look as if to say, "See, I'm fine.". 

One of the quadrupeds is wounded, it tries to shake off something that looks like a fern born in hell. White blood spills as the massive creature thrashes and stomps.

One of it's stiff, bulky legs pummels Alex to the ground. The sound of shattered bone echoes clearly through the din of death and confusion. 

It's more than I can take. The horror, the feeling of failure. Of sending an innocent child on a death march. Leo and Sveta are blanched, even Demi looks dismayed. I can feel their heartbreak. 

It takes me a moment to realize, I mean this literally. 

I'm not just feeling my own sense of fear and loss. It's Sveta's dashed hope, Leo's general's guilt, Demi's hurt pride and Mike's...nothing. 

I look to our resident Slasher-In-Denial, he watches Alex's body. A tear slowly snakes it's way down his face. 


"Okay, we need a plan B...", Leo begins, shaken as we turn to face each other. 

He's interrupted by a wet, cracking noise we all assume is Alex's corpse being mangled. 

Then I see the half-grin sneak it's way across Mike's face.

Slowly, he raises one hand and points to Alex. A look crosses his features I can’t quite describe. It’s the child of pride and interest. 

I see it first, and the stunned expression on my face is enough to make the rest of the group turn. 

From a minor crater, one small, white hand appears. 

A jet of blood and gore from within the indented gravel, and another hand. 

Cracking, wet and deep as Alex slowly drags herself from what we thought was her shallow grave. 

I’m impressed, astounded, hopeful, but above all, sad. 

Her body has been further twisted, plates of bone under her skin warp her features. One eye is covered by a hard, yellow growth. As she climbs out of the bloody hole, I see long, thin tendrils snaking from her legs to the ground. 

“What is she?”, Sveta asks no one in particular. 

“Damned if I know.”, Leo replies. 

“I’m already damned and I still have no idea.”, Demi adds. 

Mike grins, knowingly. 

“Out with it.”, I tell him. 

“It’s not a good idea for me to give my opinion much. 

I’ve got a haystack of a mind, and it gets really hard to find the needles sometimes. 

What I feel safe saying is, we can’t assume the kid is invincible. Whatever we just watched, it’s only going to happen so many times.”, Mike replies. 

Alex gets to her feet. Almost petulantly one of the massive creatures kicks her. 

I feel, as much as see what happens next. Something in this new (old?) body of mine gives me insight. 

In an almost beautiful display of the supernatural and the physical. Alex’s body anchors itself into the ground tendrils digging quick and low. The changes to her body do the majority of the work, but something else nullifies the remaining force. 

She doesn’t move an inch, she doesn’t have a scratch on her. 

But you’ve all been following along, you know this wasn’t a solution to the situation. The universe hates us. 

After a few attempts, the things around her give up. They ignore the strange, immovable creature in their midst. 

“We’re not sending her in alone.”, Sveta says. 

“Of course we’re not. But I see what you’re saying. Fuck me, it’s never easy, is it?”, Leo replies. 

I don't have the tactical knowledge Leo does, but the problem is obvious. 

Alex is doing fine, nothing, from aggravated kicks, to massive, falling bodies budges her. But, that's it. 

She tries lashing out at the things around her. Twisted fingers tear furrows through bark-like flesh, but she's nothing more than another of the hundreds of angry, violent creatures trying to take a piece of these giants. 

Leo fires a few shots at the things from various weapons, but nothing seems to have much of an effect. 

I can see the struggle and confusion in Alex's one visible eye. Whatever happened to her, whatever saved her, it's hell on her mind. 

"Thanks universe. Just, fucking bravo.", Mike says shaking his head, "Me, Leo, and Demi, we're expendable. Everyone agree?"

I can't answer. But in general the group agrees. 

"All right, if we're on the same page, I think we can do this. 

Demi, I'm going to need a little color.", Mike says. 

"Michael, what are you planning?", Demi says. The concerned tone coming from Jack the Ripper scares the hell out of me. 

"Something that's going to require an evil prick who knows exactly how the human body is put together. 

Juice me as much as you can for as long as you can before my hydraulics give out. You up for that?", Mike replies. 

Demi looks shocked and takes a moment to reply. 

"Michael, your idea is insane.", Demi says. 

"Makes sense. You in?", Mike asks. 

Despite his objections, Demi is.

"What are you talking about, Mike?", I ask, confused. 

"You never watch wrestling? Color, juice, blood, Punch, blood. 

When I was having my delusions of grandeur I noticed something. The things here, they have no taste for clown. Or, this clown anyway. 

It didn't hurt them, but it was like vodka on a boa constrictor. 

I figure if I do my best impression of a sprinkler I can get us some space. Alex can let us hold it. 

Leo takes out anything dead set on ruining our day, Demi keeps me dripping but walking, and everyone else? You focus on staying alive. Certain people need to get to the finish line here, and the world has plenty of lunatics, serial killers and hardmen.", Mike responds. 

Laid out like it is, Sveta, and myself feel like shit. But there's no time for debate. And beyond that, we can't really argue with someone who's telling us to use them as a meat shield. 

"I've done something like this before. Albeit the goal was death.", Demi says, "Twenty minutes till you're useless on the field. Ten after that we'll have to carry you."

"Mike knows we don’t have time to carry anyone.", Leo says as the two exchange a look of respect. 

"Sure do. Wouldn't let you if you tried.", Mike's somber tone is off-putting to say the least. 

It's a morbid plan brewed at hell's gate. But what else would a group like us come up with?

Demi wields his long, silver knife like a surgeon. While the dozens of deep cuts he makes over Mike's body aren't debilitating, they aren't painless either. 

Our trip into this vortex of wildlife begins with Mike's screams.

The deep wounds are garish as hell. They slowly weep blood. As Mike moves the lacerations look gill-like. 

Leo somberly puts together an old looking hunting rifle, scanning through the mass of flesh in front of us for anything looking our way. 

Wounds flex and weep as Mike flings his arms out like a conductor. Arching drops of blood hit the creatures around Alex and the reaction is instant. 

They bolt, shaking and rubbing against each other to try and rid themselves of Mike's blood. 

"Back, you giant bastards, I'm not made of blood.", Mike says, laughing morbidly at his own bad joke. 

A space forms, not much, but enough for us to circle around the poor, mutilated kid. 

"Alex, are you okay?", I ask. 

She shakes her head, she replies to something, but it isn't me. Mike starts making slow progress forward, but an errant limb almost turns him to pulp. 

"Need my anchor up here Alex!", he says, the sound of fear in his voice betrays his almost demonic, blood covered look. 

Alex coughs, body trembling as she tries to focus. 

"Told you...nothing can hurt me.", she says, obviously wracked with pain. 

She pulls herself together and we start to make slow, nerve-wracking progress. 

Around us is a storm of death. Stray bullets, darting winged things that swoop down like sentient arrows. Limbs of all shapes and sizes, there’s  not one step that isn't worthy of it's own two-sentence horror. 

And the sounds. If there is a god, he must have a personal hatred for us. Screams of every pitch, the noise of senseless death, torture, and panic. 

Our pace quickens as we get free of the massive tree-limbed creatures, but by no means are we breaking any land-speed records.

Despite the chaos and death around me, I can't take my eyes off of Alex. My mind won't let go of the fact that the lurching, entity wrist-deep in a corpse taken over by some kind of vine is that same little girl I saved. 

Something that was little more than a set of grinding gnashing teeth springs at her. She screams as it removes a piece of flesh from her leg and scuttles back into the tornado of things that shouldn't be. 

Demi manages to suture the wound with little more than a scrap of shirt and splinter of bone. But it's a reminder of how little we know about what Alex is. 

"Leo, now would be a great time for some holy fire, or something.", I suggest as the press of forms starts to slow us down. 

"Setting aside the fact that these things might not even notice, not much here is evil. 

I would if I could but I follow laws, not suggestions. By the way, I feel strange still calling you Punch.", Leo replies. 

"I'd feel stranger if you called me anything else.", I say as we share a morbid chuckle. 

At a turtle's pace we move forward, but assuming Demi's estimate was right we'll reach the city before Mike is in too much danger. 

"Steady on Michael, do not exert yourself if you can avoid it.", Demi encourages.

"I'm trying, but a lot of these things need some motivation to back off.", Mike replies. 

We start to fall into a pattern, getting used to the ebb and flow of what's going on. We collect bruises and scrapes like baseball cards, but our progress is steady. 

Then we feefollo.A low rumbling as the gravel beneath our feet begins to shift. 

One of the sinkholes has appeared to our left, the biggest one I’ve seen so far, a wall of entities, people and god knows what else starts to come our way, desperate to avoid finding out what is at the bottom of the pit. 

Visibility suddenly shrinks as space becomes non-existent. We can only hope we're still going the right way as we're pushed and jostled. 

With an earth shaking noise, a massive piece of the ground sinks inward. In a moment a city block worth of the unluckiest people, and rarest creatures vanishes. 

"Out of the way!", someone says. It’s  followed by the cocking of a pistol.

In the ten feet of space beside us, stands a man and his two children. I can tell at a glance they had no intent of showing up here. They've all been through a lot. 

The boy and girl were in their late teens. Shell shocked, and dirty, they eye our group with suspicion. 

The father has determination and steel in his eyes. This place has hit him, made him what he needed to be to keep his kids safe. 

Demi looks about ready to pounce, Mike has subtly drawn his knife. 

"Easy, Pal. We're all going at the same speed. There's nowhere to go. The name's Leo, by the way.", Leo says, trying to de-escalate the situation. 

"Shut up. 

If I have to put a hole in all of you to get by I will. I don't want to, but I’m not letting my kids die here.", the man says.

In the grand scheme of things, a gun should be considered small potatoes to me. But that was back when I could be repaired with some spooky words and, I don't know, eye of newt or whatever. 

As the man waves the firearm at us, as the pit gets closer to him and his family, I’m acutely aware of how easy it would be for him to kill me. 

Leo smiles, looking the man in the eye. He radiates that energy of his, purer then I’ve felt yet. 

"That's not going to happen. Me and my people are going to make sure you get as far as we do. You have my word. 

Now, if you wouldn't mind pointing the firearm anywhere else, we can get some miles in.", Leo says. 

For a moment the man looks unsure, eyeing up Mike and Demi. But after looking back at the encroaching subterranean blackness, and prompted by Leo’s mojo lowers the pistol. 

Martin, Jacob and Kelly join us. We outpace the sinkhole, and eventually find a small reprieve. 

In the form of a field of the dead and dying.

It's hard to tell what is what, where one corpse ends and the next begins. It's the end result of dozens of things with nothing to lose and nowhere to go trying, in vain, to survive. 

While, relatively speaking, it's safe, it highlights our situation. At any moment, with nothing more than a quirk of fate, we could be in the middle of something like this. 

None of us say it, but all of us feel it. In this moment of reflection, I take a moment to see if I can make any sense out of the things I'm feeling. 

I let my mind drift, wander, pass over the faint sense of emotion I'm getting from people. 

I feel I should know more, I should be able to use this somehow. But it feels like trying to read a language I've only heard other people speak. 

Martin is the easiest, an abundance of fear, but a drive that overshadows it.  His children though, are a mystery. 

At some point I close my eyes, not entirely of my own accord. I can almost make things out, streaks and lines of something just at the edge of sight. 

A sudden, distracting change from Martin. Fear and horror drain away. 

When I open my eyes I see Martin and his family walking  to our right.  Faces and bodies free of terror and pain. 

"What the hell?", I say as I  watch Sveta and Leo begin to follow. 

I may be new to being able to read people, but I’m not seeing any reason for everyone to suddenly be doing great.

My eyes follow the family, Leo, Sveta, Alex and Demi as they stroll, leisurely toward, something. 

That something is a group of a few dozen humanoid things. They're short, the tallest being about five and a half feet. Their skin is a pastel purple, their eyes, large, black ovals. 

No claws, or gaping maws. They sit or walk among dozens of travellers and members of the lost.

I can't read the things here, but as I really get a good look at these almost beautiful entities, I understand I don't need to. 

I join my new friends, with every step toward these companions I feel the horror and grime of this place melt away. 

"Guys, what the hell? I'm still bleeding here.", Mike says. 

His voice seems so far away. I'm sure he's following us, how could he not be? 

Almost as if called, Demi, Alex, Leo and Sveta find their own patch of peace, sitting beside our new friends. 

One of the entities approaches me, and holds out an oddly proportioned hand. 

"What are you?", I ask. 

"Seriously, guys, you're freaking me out here.", Mike says. I don't understand the look of concern on his face. 

"We are peace, we are calm. And we are here to share that with you.", the entity in front of me says. 

Of course, there’s a nagging suspicion in the back of my mind, but I look around and see nothing other than evidence the entity is telling the truth. In this storm of violence, our new friends are a shelter.

"We cannot fight against this violence. Our time has come, but until it does, share these final moments with us.

You can call me, L.", L says. 

And it's all so clear. We're doing nothing more than ensuring our last moments are nothing but conflict and pain. 

"Demi, seriously, you're drawn into this?", Mike yells. 

I smile to L and let them lead me to the calm of his people. 

Long white fingers stained with blood snap in front of my face. 

"Fucking, earth to Punch, you in there man?", Mike says, standing in front of me. 

A half dozen large, six legged things with glistening flesh and clawed limbs burst from the surrounding melee. Their panicked run takes them through where our new friends gather. 

A few lose their lives, trampled or torn apart by translucent claws. But that's okay, everything is okay. 

"You saw that, right?", Mike pleads. 

"Mike, it's okay. Just, calm down.", I assure. 

"God damn it, your a lost cause. 

Okay, L-dog, whatever trap you're set to spring, it's not going to work. Look at these guys. Do yourself a favor, cut the mind control, and let us move on.", Mike pleads. 

L smiles.

"If this were a trap I'd agree with you. Your friends are many, and powerful. No doubt they'd break free of any attempts at manipulation eventually. 

But we are not controlling anyone. We are simply, peace, unity, acceptance.", L replies.

Mike shudders, a grim look on his face. 

"You're not lying, are you? You guys just are what you are. Infectious good vibes..", it seems like he's almost talking to himself at this point, "You couldn't stop if you tried, could you?"

A burst of gunfire cuts down another handful of entities and travellers. 

"No more than you could stop breathing.

Come, I'm sure the others would like to meet someone as unique as yourself.", L replies. 

Mikes face twists in conflict, he starts to mutter to himself too low for me to hear. He begins to sob lightly, repeating over and over, "I don't want to do this.".

L reaches out, placing a comforting hand on the tall man's arm. 

Like a set trap Mike grabs L's hand, holding it up high. 

"But I have to.", He says, deadpan, driving his knife into the harmless entity at a sowing machine pace.

He's not just committing murder, he's introducing it to L's people. He's not just Dahmer, he's Cain. 

There's a horrific feedback between my connection to L and his kind and the unknown force inside of me. Empathy, insight, and supernatural forces mix together and I see Mike like I’ve never seen him before. 

Not as some feral prisoner, or blood spilling savior. I see him as his victims do. 

We all scream, and plead, begging him to stop. Trying to convince this avatar of violence to subdue his wrath. 

The thought to intervene, to stop him, it's toxic. It's against everything good and pure in the universe. 

L's murder is a drawn out affair. Mike digs his knife around, struggling to find vital spots. 

L's people understand death, but as a natural part of the cycle of this place. This kind of focused, violence, they have no frame of reference for. 

There are no puns, no grin, no cheesy one liners. Mike's face is like slate, his eyes dead, his wounds pouring blood. 

It's not a rampage, but a wicked cull. Mike encounters no resistance even as his knife snaps off in the body of one of the peaceful entities. 

He picks up something, it looks like some form of industrial tool. A thick piece of orange steel with what looks to be an oversized bike chain attached. 

Most of the travellers are broken half way through Mike's cull. The confusion and fear from the entities overloading their minds. 

But not us, not our deranged little collection of misfits. My head pounds, my heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest, and judging by how they're acting the rest of our group are going through the same thing.

Mike starts screaming at the entities, demanding to know why they won't stop their communion. Every question, every sobbed apology is punctuated by disturbing tearing noises, and levels of violence that make me understand why Demi picked his mind. 

There's a pressure, then a sharp pain in my head as Mike puts the last of L's people down. My vision swims, I struggle to stand, to make sense of the last fifteen minutes. 

Mike stands among the corpses and stunned travellers. Hunched, knuckles torn, body pouring blood. He looks around in a daze, seeing the skyline of the city, so tantalisingly close, and without a word. He begins to walk. 

The way forward isn't clear, but it's a damn sight less crowded than it has been. We can see the massive, pig-iron gates of the city. Stumbling, and groggy, ashamed and confused, we catch up to Mike, ready to cross the threshold into as close to hell as anyone living will get. 

What do you think we are going to find there? Besides, hopefully, the bishop? Let me know below, I need something to take my mind off of what Mike did. 

Peace. 

Punch
