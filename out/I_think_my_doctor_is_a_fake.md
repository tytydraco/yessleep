I've been dozing in and out of consciousness on a stiff hospital bed since it happened. Are hospital beds supposed to be this uncomfortable? One of many questions I can't look up like I used to. I don't know how long I've been here. I don't know if they'll ever let me leave.

The doctor said I'm lucky to be alive. Apparently my swerving to dodge that semi-truck saved me, even as it killed a woman. A passenger on a motorcycle. The last thing I remember is her flying up in the air and splashing on that truck.

My guilt is indescribable.

But this is not about what happened. I'll do my best to avoid self-pity.

The doctor lies to me a lot. The most common lie he tells is when the other doctor shows up. See, there's one doctor that's been treating me, and who sometimes talks to me. But sometimes, I wake from a nap and I see the other doctor, facing away from me, staring into the corner of this grimy white room. Clear in the maddening fluorescent lights.

She does nothing but stand, long black hair hanging halfway down. She stands as though her muscles are almost unnaturally tight, like she might erupt in a fit of rage at any moment. I always wait for her to turn and run at me. Any second. I brace myself to be startled. But she just keeps looking into that corner.

The first time the doctor arrived in the room while the other doctor was here, I asked, "What is the deal with that person?"

"There's no one here but me and you. It's time for your tickle therapy."

"In the corner. Who is that?"

The doctor turned and looked. "There's no one there. I'll need to go ahead and undress you for—"

"How did you know which corner then?"

"She doesn't exist."

"How did you know—"

"Open wide." The doctor started making crab-like motions with his hands. Those awful white gloves.

I'll go ahead and explain that "tickle therapy" is a process I apparently need to undergo at seemingly random intervals. It is exactly what it sounds like. I cannot fathom what practical purpose it serves, and the doctor doesn't even seem to enjoy it, but he does it anyway. It's miserable.

I'll also clarify that he frequently needs to undress me because I am always strapped to this hospital bed. There is no way for me to use the restroom. Only the doctor can clean me up.

My only respite from all of this is the dreams. Dreams like this one, where I'm simply living life like it was before the crash. Where I can even tell you about my suffering and pretend you're real, and reading this.

But, inevitably, I wake up. Back in the hospital room, bound to that stiff, painful bed.

And, as previously mentioned, sometimes the other doctor is there in that corner. Like she might turn and erupt at me. Any second.

Usually she's not there, which is almost even worse. Stuck here (even in this dream I know I'm here), alone. Until I fall asleep again. Or the doctor comes for tickle therapy, or to begrudgingly clean me up. The doctor and that putrid breath oozing from his rictus grin. Those angular, rotting teeth.

I am trying so hard to not turn this into self-pity. I'm describing the facts. Just the facts. Keep it simple.

The doctor's other favorite treatments include: "the stretching game", "the crunching game", and, his favorite of all, "the show". I don't want to talk about any of them.

The stretching game keeps up this endless and severe muscle pain. He never lets them heal.

The crunching game keeps my limbs all contorted like this. He never lets me heal.

His various medical instruments are like if you did to knives and needles and drills what the crash did to my limbs.

I think the show is his most important procedure.

He seems genuinely proud of his performances. Like he dreams of a different life in which this is all he does. During most visitations, he only speaks when spoken to. During the treatment he calls "the show", he speaks endlessly.

Sometimes it's something akin to a stand-up comedy routine. He repeatedly makes the most inane and downright uninteresting social observations—or just personal complaints—and after each one, he looks at me with what he must think is a sly grin. After a second or so, he goes again.

"I want to spend more time with you, but my wife demands I return home," he might say. And he smirks like he's clever. If I respond he ignores it.

Other times he performs full-on skits, where he plays two or more characters and runs between different spots in the room to signify each one. He attempts to give them voices too, but they're hard to tell apart.

"Please darling, I don't want to play this game anymore."

"But it's part of the ritual, my dear."

"But I just want to sleep, darling."

"My dear, you can't get revenge while sleeping."

His acting is horrid. The plots are nonsense.

There are other times where he even sings, and these songs must be his own compositions. I could not imagine anyone other than my doctor writing them.

"A dead witch is a good witch,

And a good witch is mad.

And the last thing you want,

Is a mad witch all sad."

He always manages to invent notes I've never heard before, in that strained, crooning voice of his, and while he sings he frantically and arrhythmically gesticulates with those appalling white gloves.

I get the sense he's somehow embarrassed of the show, as it's the only treatment he'll never perform in front of the other doctor. And he should be embarrassed. The show is always the time when I'm most desperate to escape. But with my limbs all mangled up like this, my muscles so worthless, and the doctor always maintaining all of this with such surgical precision, escape is not worth thinking of.

By now it's very obvious that my doctor is a fake. But I need to doubt my sanity. It's the only way.

I hope I never wake from this dream. I hope I never have to see any of that delirious nonsense again. I hope I can sit here typing my rant, and then share it with the dream people, and stand up, and go about the rest of my day, and never again wake up in that horrible room.

I hope for too many unrealistic outcomes. I wish you were real.

There is a fourth type of performance in "the show".

This one initially appears to be a failed attempt at the first type—the stand-up comedy routine. Except it gradually becomes clear that it is not meant to be funny. He just vents. Like I'm supposed to help him somehow. This is what his performance was before I fell asleep today. Why I'm typing this.

"I should have never let her on the back of my motorcycle. I never would have imagined—I'm sorry. You didn't kill her. Not just you, I mean. We both did. Please don't blame yourself. *Please*. My wife is... irrational. And powerful. Please don't. I'm sorry... It's time to undress you. If I don't tickle you soon, she'll—"

And he stopped himself, tears streaming down his face. He is contemptible. He is the direct source of my torment. I still hugged him. We still cried together.

I know I'm about to wake up now. I know because I feel her presence. I always feel the other doctor when she's in the hospital room. I know if I turn around from my screen, she'll be there. Waiting for me to wake up again. And when I do, any second, she'll be in that same corner, facing away.

Like she's about to turn and startle me.

Any second.
