It’s been a year, now. 

Last Thanksgiving had started like any other year: chaotic. Coming from a big family myself, I knew what I was getting into when our fourth kid was on the way and part of that was understanding that now time is more of an abstract concept. 

“Finally, mija! You made it. Did you sleep in?” 

I plastered a fake, unbothered smile. “Happy Thanksgiving, Mama. No, no, I didn’t sleep in.” I gave her a hug and moved on to my grandfather behind her, then aunts and uncles, brothers and sisters and finally cousins.

I took a breath and lugged all our coats into the living room. That’s when I saw him.

“Who’s that?” I asked my brother. 

He paused, squishing his face in confusion.

“I think he came with Vanessa.” 

I asked my cousin Vanessa.

“I don’t know, but he’s cute. Maybe he’s one of Fern’s friends?” 

I asked her brother Fernando. I asked my sister. No one would claim the stranger. Finally, I asked the one person who would know for sure. 

“Mama! Who’s that guy on the sofa, in the red shirt?” 

She peered around the corner. “Oh, I don’t know mija. Did you ask Vanessa? She’s always bringing someone new.” She made a face and disappeared back into the kitchen. 
I was left with no choice. 

“Hi there!” I said, sitting next to the stranger. 

He acknowledged me with a small nod but didn’t speak. 

I introduced myself and shook his hand.

“I’m Brian.” He said quietly. He added, slowly. “I work with Ronnie.” 

Ah, I thought. I hadn’t asked my niece Veronica.  

“Oh! I haven’t seen Ronnie yet.” I said, looking around the room. 

“She’s not here.” 

“Oh.” I said, caught off guard. “She’s not here?”  

“You should call her.” He answered. Then excused himself. 

“What was that?” I whispered to myself. I called Ronnie, but she didn’t answer. 

I caught up with my brother. 

“Hey! Have you spoken to Veronica today?” I asked. 

He shook his head. “Not yet. She’s supposed to call me when she gets out of work, but I haven’t heard from her yet.” 

I couldn’t shake the dreadful feeling. I called her again. I texted her. Then I started calling hospitals, starting with the ones closest to her job. This is ridiculous, I thought to myself. But was it? I had to make sure so I could make that terrible feeling in my stomach go away. 

On the third call, the woman on the other end of the line validated everything I felt. 

“Yes, we have her here. She’s been in an accident. Her phone wasn’t on her when the paramedics brought her in, so we haven’t been able to contact the family. She’s in stable, but critical condition.” 

My niece passed away the next morning, with all of us by her side. It turns out her phone had flown out of the car on impact and was in such bad shape they weren’t able to turn it on. If it hadn’t been for Brian, we would have missed those last precious moments with my niece. Who knows when we would have known about the accident. 

I checked with Veronica’s job, and they didn’t have a record of any Brian matching my description. To this day, I still don’t know who Brian is. Or maybe who he was? All I know is as grateful as I am to him, I hope I never see him again.
