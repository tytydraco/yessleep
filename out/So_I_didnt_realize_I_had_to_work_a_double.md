I had checked my schedule the night before and I close tomorrow. Nice I get to sleep in!

I decide to have a night out with a friend.  We go bar hopping and she ends up sleeping over. 

We both sleep in til noon. 

A random sense of dread hit me and I check my schedule again. I was supposed to work a double. 

My friend said that she will help me get to work and explain the situation. 

We both go out to my car and there’s a woman in a dark green dress and short curled brunette hair. Her eyes are all black and they are bleeding a dark inky liquid and she is sitting in the driver’s seat. 

We immediately run inside from what we saw. Fear and panic sets into my heart. 

Suddenly I’m connecting dots from last night. Someone was following us all night. I had made a note of it when I saw her at the second bar of the night.  I saw her again at the fourth but assumed it was just coincidence. 

She was eye catching for sure. With her emerald green vintage 50s dress with fishnets and black pumps.  Her dark brown curls fell just at her jawline. And a wide, almost too wide smile. Showing off perfectly pearly teeth incased in ruby red lipstick. She was always looking at the both of you with that large smile but then again that night was filled with us having obnoxiously loud conversations. I just thought that maybe she found our humor funny. 

Now there was no laughter only a deep sense of dread. Why did her eyes look like that? They weren’t pitch black last night you would have remembered that.  Was she still alive?

My friend suggested to call 911. I agreed immediately but realized that my phone was at 5% when I had checked my work app.  I had left it open in the chaos of getting ready and it had died. I asked my friend if she could call the police. She then realized she didn’t have her phone. She must’ve left it at one of the many bars we had been at last night. I had set my phone on the charger when my friend called for me to come to the window. 

The woman had to be alive because she sitting up straight as a board with her hands on the wheel.  She was staring right at the front door as if she was waiting to pick someone up. 

I gulped and turned away from the window.  The fear was making me feel nauseous. Who was this woman? 

In an instant we heard rapid knocking on the door. It was that woman and she was positively banging on my front door. As if she was trying to break down the door with just her one fist. I looked out the peephole and she was gone as quickly as she arrived. My friend went to look out the window to see if the woman went back to her car. As soon as she pulled back the curtains she let out a scream. The woman had been standing right out side the floor to ceiling window. Just as my friend screamed the woman busted the glass to the window with her bare fists. 

Hands gushing a thick black blood as she stepped through window and into the house. Her smile unwavering.  My friend and I booked it away. We weren’t sure where we were running as long as it was away from her. She stayed close behind. We ended up in the bathroom and locked the door behind us. 

I felt so stupid. Of course I ran into the most useless and inescapable of the house. Maybe I can launch some scrunchies at her. I’m sure that will really get under her skin.  There were no windows so the only way of getting in or out was through the door we had entered. 

At the bottom of the door I could see her shadow. Waiting. She made absolutely no noise but after seeing her easily smashing the window I wasn’t about to put my ear to the door to double check. Lest my head fall victim to her brute force.  Sitting in the tub I whispered, “What we should do now?”  My friend didn’t have a response. She sat in disbelief of what our situation was. 

“Well, she hasn’t tried to bust through the door yet so that is a positive.”  I said. 

“Maybe she will just leave?” my friend said doubting the words the moment they left her lips.  

I shared her doubt with a shrug but I didn’t any better options in the moment. 

“Hey maybe it’s a good thing that I missed work today.” I said.  “Maybe somebody will be curious about my absence. It’s not like me to not show up to work without saying anything.”


And so we sat. For what seemed like an eternity. Watching the door but the woman’s shadow remained. Still. Like a prison guard. 

Suddenly we heard thumping from somewhere in the house.  The thumping got closer until I could make it out as foot steps. Large footsteps that sounded like that would come from a man with boots on except there was an unmistakable squish to them. As if stomping through mud. 

They grew louder until they ended right by the bathroom door. Then I heard whispers impossibly low but I could make out didn’t even sound like English to me.  I’m not very educated on other languages. I took French for 4 years but retained almost none of it.  The whispering seemed to belong to two women. Then it ended. And heavy foot steps trudged away until it seemed like the person had left the house. But the woman’s shadow still stood unmoving. 

I was getting fed up and desperate. I started to yank the towel rack off the wall. 

“What are you doing?” my friend quietly shouted at me. 

“I’m not waiting until more of this chick’s friends show up there is two of us and one of her.”  I replied being sure to keep my plan at low volume. I want to have some sort of element of surprise. 

Once the rack was free of the wall I handed it to my friend I figured if we were to do my stupid plan then she should at least get to be more armed. I grabbed a glass vase I used for all hair ties. It was small but had a little bit of heft to it. 

“I’m going to smash this vase over her head as soon as you open the door okay?” I asked. 

My friend nodded and held tightly to the towel rack.  Her hands were shaking but she somehow found the resolve to stop them long enough to turn the lock. The tick that came from the knob sounded to me like an anvil thudding on the floor. The shadow didn’t move. I admired her bravery as she took the knob brazenly and turned it carefully. She gave me a nod that simply said, Your turn.” 

I inhaled silently. As waited to make my move. I took one last glance of under the door.  The shadow still there. I wished that she would have just left as fast as she had entered. I wished that I wouldn’t have to come to such a violent solution to protect myself and my friend. But problems don’t always just go away. 

The bathroom door swang open and I blindly brought down the vase with as much might as I could muster. Down onto nothing. What? I had checked to see if she was still there before the door was opened and she definitely was. Am I going crazy? Was there even a woman here to begin with? Did I allow my anxiety to manifest into something beyond my control?

My friend was gobsmacked.  “She was just here.” she said. With how long we had spent in silence it had seemed like she screamed it. But I found comfort in that she saw the woman too. There is no way something in my head could be seen by others. 

We continued with caution. I kept a gun in my bedroom closet and lead us toward that way. As we walked through the hall we passed the living room where the broken window was. Glass still littered through the room I had been so adamant about keeping clean. But I saw no one.  

I didn’t let the relief hit me just yet. Not until I could do a sweep of the whole house. 

We made it to my bedroom. I asked my friend to keep an eye on the door. So close to being more than defenseless. I inched towards the closet door being fully aware that it would be a great hiding spot for my unwelcome guest. I open the door slowly peering inside as I did.  

Before I knew it my friend had screamed but it was cut off short. She was lying on the ground unconscious. Standing over her was that woman. Smiling devilishly. Her black tears must’ve been flowing this whole time because they began to stain the front of her emerald green dress. Before I could comprehend her movement she had made her way to me. I didn’t even see her move her feet when she had slammed my head against the wall.  I was out like a light. 

When I came to my ears were ringing. My fuzzy vision started to make out the familiar sight of Dragon Ball Z on the TV.  I was so confused as looked around to see that I was sitting on my couch in my living room.  All the lights were off save for the glow emanating from the TV. Right next to me was my friend and next her was that woman. I instantly froze up.  The woman was staring straight at the TV with her ever present smile.  My friend was also staring at the screen but with a more terrified expression. She was on the verge of tears but her eyes stayed glued to the screen. Fearing what the woman would do if I tried to get up I also watched the television. 

I was never a fan of Dragon Ball Z so I didn’t understand what was happening in the plot. I could feel the cool air from the broken window on my neck. I wondered if my friend was thinking what I was thinking. Maybe we could make a run for it?  Suddenly the show changed to old merry melodies Halloween special.  There were dancing skeletons on screen. I typically love this sort of light hearted macabre entertainment but it felt especially sinister with the woman’s presence. 

Then it quickly changed to a PSA about if you know where your children are right now. In my peripheral I could see the woman’s black tears start to fall with more intensity than before. Sopping the front of her dress. You wouldn’t even be able to tell that it was once green. Then the program changed again the Betty Boop Snow White cartoon.  The remote sat mockingly in front of us on the coffee table. As the long legged ghost crooned on the screen I dared to pass a glance at my friend. I was searching for any semblance of hope that we could make it out of this. 

She looked at me too but only dread was plastered on her face. We both looked back at the screen. As we continued to watch the show she whispered something in a hushed tone so that only I could hear. 

“Do you see it?”

What was she referring to? I looked intently on the screen. I had seen this episode before and nothing seemed out of the norm. And then I saw it. 

Not on the screen but in the hallway past the TV and into the dark. Something with a hulking frame stood back there with a familiarly wide smile.  It stood back there like a brick wall imposing and stationary. Loose hair threaded from its scalp and its eyes were like two tiny white glints. It stared holes into my soul. I couldn’t tell what it was wearing but it seemed absolutely drenched.  

Horrified I quickly averted my gaze back to the screen.  My hope felt squashed. I didn’t know how we were going to make it out of this.

The TV changed again to an episode of goosebumps. I looked at the screen not even taking in what was happening. I was too focused on my fear dumbing down my mind until my thoughts felt like static. I wanted to scream, cry, throw up, anything. Instead I sat side by side with my friend staring at the TV but watching them in utter silence.  It was several seasons later when something unexpected happened. 

My friend got up and made a dead sprint towards the gaping window. I should have followed her but I just sat there dumbly. As look back forward it was right in front of me I hear a loud crack and all goes black. 

I woke up three days later in a hospital bed.  I was right people at my work took notice to absence immediately.  My boss had called the police after she had done a drive by of my house and noticed the broken window in the front the next day. When the police found me both my legs were snapped like twigs. As if my body was the start of an origami piece. Folded over and over on themselves.  And message was carved into my forearm.

“Wait here.”

The police had questions for me obviously. But I needed to get mine out of the way first.  “Is my friend okay?” I ask desperately. 

“Ma’am,” the officer replied “That is what we are trying to find out. We still have no sign of her.”
