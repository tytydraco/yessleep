Hey. HEY. You! Yeah, you. Who the fuck else. It's just us here. Well... that's not entirely true, there was that other guy... What was his name again? Ah, why bother, he's been gone a few hours now. Doubt he's coming back anyway...

  
Anyway, have you seen it? What do you mean what? IT! The... the... thing! I don't know what its called. How the hell am I even supposed to know. It's just.. y'know the thing.

Oh well, I guess you haven't see it. You'd remember if you had seen it. It's... it's just beautiful. Literally just the most BEAUTIFUL thing I've ever seen. 

Wh- What? Speak up, I can't fucking hear you if you mumble. I've already told you I don't fucking know what it is. What does it look like? I guess that depends. Yesterday it was a fish... Yes, a fish ok!? Look, yesterday it was a fish, swimming through the air like it were water. Glowing, or shining? To be honest I don't even know the difference between the two. Point is, it looks like it's made of light... pure.. silver... light...

  
The day before that it was a deer: It pranced like one. Up and down... But the way it moved... oooooh booy. That wasn't no deer I ever seen. So smooth, so beautiful. So. FUCKING. BEAUTIFUL.

  
YEAH, FUCK OFF, I'M OKAY. I'm just crying cause it's beautiful ok!? Haven't seen it all day. I sorta... I miss it I guess? Yeah, I miss it, I said it.

Look, just, maybe just shut the fuck up ok? I'm gonna keep looking for it. If you see it tell me...

...

Who are you anyway? ... A what now? A WARRIOR? HA, that's rich. Ain't nobody been a warrior in what, a thousand years? OOOH you're one of those guys huh? Tour guide told me about you guys from across the river. You guys don't seem to be too kind to strangers huh? Yeah, yeah, we're fucking up the forest. Well, maybe if you got off your LAZ- Wait...

Did you hear that?

Oh, never mind. Where was I?

Oh yeah. You lazy fuckers just out here in the forest. What do you even do huh? Just chill out, barely clothed. Gotta get with the times buddy. I work 60 hours a week back home. I have a nice ride, an amazing house, and it's the only way I can afford trips like these man. 

Came here a couple weeks ago. Friend of mine, Enzo - y'know Enzo? No, course you don't. Anyway, Enzo told me about this place, how the girls here are dressed in the tiniest bikinis and they bring you the best drinks. What are they called caipi... Oh who cares. Man y'know that's just what I needed HA! Bet you guys don't even get excited about that since you walk around mostly in the nude anyway. Plus y'all live your lives wasted too so maybe alcohol ain't for ya HAHAHA.

That's not true? Of course it is. You're a savage, you got that SAV-

Wait. I definitely heard it this time.

Oh, OH, OOOH, It's coming. I can already feel it. My skin feels like it's on fire. My ears are ringing and I feel like I need to vomit. Oh my god. It's there.

What do you mean you can't see it. It's right. fucking. there. ARE YOU BLIND, IT'S RIGHT TH- Oh fuck it who cares.

It's so beautiful... It's a jaguar this time... It's eyes look like diamonds it's so beautiful... It wants me to come to it. How do I know, well... it's... it's just standing there so... so... beautifully. It must want me to come, right? But every time I do it runs away. I've run after it so many times. Last time I went after it for hours. HOURS. Like, my feet literally bled from it. No, I swear, look!

Who cares if you didn't ask to see it... I just I need to- I didn't ask you for your input, you know? I'm a grown fucking man I'll do whatever I want. Not that I would expect you to get that. How old even are you, 12?

Maybe you're right though. As the grownup I need to stay and look after you.

even if you are just... one of them. 

Anyway, it'll likely just stay there, it always does, just out of reach. 

I've gotten used to it too. The burning, the ringing, the nausea. But I never get use to how beautiful it is. Shame you can't see it kid.

How'd I get here? Why do you ask? Same as anyone else. One foot after another! It was dark, I was taking a stroll to that uhm... gentleman's club there at the edge of the city... You know the one right? Yeah, yeah, the one shaped like a big straw building!

Yeah, I was coming back from there, it was dark. I remember twisting my ankle on a tree root or something. I tell you, I was pretty fucked up. Can't remember much, but when I came to I was here... Anyway who even cares how I got here. I never want to leave.

Even if all my teeth fall out, and even if I never eat anything ever again, just to get a glimpse of the thing. It's... it's coming closer.. I-I-I FEEL IT. AAAAHH...

\--

I'm not sure what just happened. I must've fallen asleep. When I came to he was gone.

I never saw what he was talking about. I think he'd been starved and tired. His mind was playing tricks on him. In a place like this that tends to be quite common. Not that I know where we are.

But the way he described it....

My people tell stories about all manner of spirits out in these woods. Like the Anhangá. An elder told me about it before. It's an evil spirit, a follower of the evil god whose name I dare not say. It torments lost souls and drives mortals insane.

The only question left is which of the two was he. Which am I? I haven't seen it yet, but I can feel it in my skin, I hear it I feel the ringing. It's-

IT'S THERE!  
  
 IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL, DO YOU SEE IT TOO?
