I'm copy-pasting my journal. I don't have time to explain everything because there's a fucking demon trying to break down my goddamned door.

Feb 13

My therapist told me I should keep a journal. She said having an emotional outlet would be good for me. It would help me process the trauma.

This is me processing the God damned TRAMA.

Some redneck fucking inbred assholes tried to sacrifice me to a demon. Somehow, they died, but I didn't. How do you PROCESS that shit?

My scarf-wearing, beatnik old bag of a therapist thinks typing will help. Fucking hippy.

How am I going to handle this without becoming a raging alcoholic? It's too stupid to understand.

The police found me when one of the trailer park wives got worried that her fucking pooh bear didn't come home for dinner. You know, if pooh bear and the rest of those backwoods goat fuckers don't get six square meals a day, they get hangry and try to sacrifice a stranger to a demon.

Can you tell I'm fucking salty about the whole Goddamn thing? Losing three inches of intestines will do that to you.

The police asked me if I remembered anything.

Most of the blood in the circle was mine. That's what I remember. The rest was screaming.

I have a Y incision on my chest, thanks to those cock bags. One of those fucks was an EMT, and he had a rib spreader. When they staked me to the dirt floor of one of their fucking barns, they decided in their infinite wisdom that some of my insides should be on the outside, and that is when I passed out the first time.

I was in that barn for three days.

It's a goddamn miracle I'm alive. I should be grateful. I'm trying to be, but the pressure inside me is too big. I'm scared and angry and sad. I'm soâ€¦ I don't even know what I am.

I mean, what kind of bumfuck morons try to summon a demon? What sort of inbred cock sleaves kidnap a guy in a McDonald's parking lot and then try to summon a fucking demon. They tried to kill me for a goddamned myth.

I spent four months in the hospital. Over half of that time was spent in an induced coma. I lost fifty pounds, three inches of intestines, and the feeling in my left pinky toe.

It's a miracle, but I can't sleep because I see shit that doesn't make sense. Sometimes I think I'm still on that barn floor.

My skin doesn't move right. I have scars everywhere; the scar tissue hitches and drags when I move. Woohoo, existence is pain.

I'm going home today.

Mom doesn't live too far away. She'll drive me home, and maybe if I'm lucky, she won't sob every time she looks at me.

Feb 14

The dream I had was fucked up.

I made out with the severed head of the man that kidnapped me. Then I rolled the head under my car and grabbed another severed head to smooch on. 1 out of 5 stars would not recommend.

I'm having a hard time looking at myself in the mirror. The scars are everywhere. I don't look the same. I'm trying to forget about it. But my whole fucking body is a fucking reminder.

I am so glad they are dead, but I want to hurt them and am disappointed that I didn't get to. My brain is all fucked up now. I never used to think like this.

Feb 19

I skipped a few days of writing and missed it. This writing thing does help a bit. I should be nicer to my therapist.

I'm still having trouble looking at myself in the mirror. I forced myself to look at the scars. The scars are pink, and I can't help thinking that they look like chewed bubble gum.

I can't look at my face yet, though. Every time I look at my face, my eyes veer away. I don't know if I'm scared or what. I just haven't been able to look myself in the eyes. I know there is a part of me that is worried. Eyes are the windows to the soul, right? What if I don't like what I see?

I know that is ridiculous, but I've had some awful dreams. Stuff so harmful and destructive that I don't feel comfortable writing it down. 

My therapist wants me to try Imagery Rehearsal Therapy. The idea is that I create a script that changes the nightmare. I imagine the script while I'm awake, and hopefully, when I have the actual nightmare, the pieces will start being less fucking awful.

Feb 20

First, the good news.

I walked from my bed to the kitchen without sucking wind. It's not much, but it's progress.

The bad news.

My right eye is a different fucking color. I forced myself to look. No one told me, so it was a surprise.

I HAVE A Y SCAR ON MY TORSO. Scars on my hands and feet from the stakes. Burns are all over my body. A big burn on my neck makes it hard to tilt my head. But my face is pretty good. Except, my right fucking eye has lost all its color. It looks pink and white, AND NO ONE TOLD ME. Not even my doctor.

I had visitors in the hospital. You would have thought one of them would have said," hey bud, you have an albino eye." But nope, not even my mom.

Maybe she didn't see my eyes. She did break down crying every time she looked at me.

Not that I blame her. It's hard to look at.

I don't know how to process this. I wasn't burning up the dating scene before this. How could I ever show a person this body and expect to see anything but pity?

I need to start work soon. I guess it's long sleeves and contacts for me. I don't want to scare the receptionist.

Feb 23

There is a problem. It's crazy, but I'm going to write it down anyway.

No one else can see that my eye is different.

When mom drove me to the doctor, I asked her why she didn't tell me my eyes had changed color. She smiled and told me I had the same beautiful blue eyes I'd always had. She looked so happy I didn't want to say anything else about it.

At the Dr., I asked, "Why would my eye change color?"

She looked at me, confused, and said, "What color were they before?"

I'm more paranoid lately. So, when the Dr. didn't immediately know what I was talking about, alarm bells went off in my head.

"The right eye seems lighter," I said.

She shined a light in my eye.

"They seem about the same color to me," she said. "Trauma to the eye can cause tissue loss and make eye color look different. Do you have an ophthalmologist, or would you like a referral?"

I asked for a referral.

The ophthalmologist said my eyes looked good and sent me home.

To me, my left eye is blue, and my right eye is white on the inside of the iris, with a pink line circling the outermost part of the iris. Why is no one else able to see it? Is it a hallucination? I'm scared to bring it up with my therapist.

Feb 24

I drove myself to physical therapy. Mom wanted to take me, but I needed to do it myself. Afterward, I dropped by her house and learned more than I wanted to know about my mom's new cross-stitch hobby.

Cross-stitch may be the oldest form of embroidery, and samplers were used to teach young women the alphabet and to brainwash them with bible verses.

Mom seems happier.

Feb 25

A weird thing happened last night. I woke up and went to the bathroom. About halfway through washing my hands, I thought, "I don't remember turning on the lights." Then the whole house went dark. I couldn't see anything except a glowing reflection in the bathroom mirror. My right eye was glowing.

The glow was an orange yellow like a campfire. At first, I didn't know what the light in the mirror was. But then I looked around, and it followed where my head was. I flicked on the lights, and the glow stopped.

That's not normal.

Feb 26

Everything is fucked!

I didn't sleep last night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw shit. Stuff I can't believe my brain can imagine. So, I thought fuck it, I'll just stay up and try to read.

I'm reading an article about how to find hidden business assets when the words start moving around. No problem, right? I'm tired. Why wouldn't the words mash together, but then the letters rearrange. Suddenly, the page is covered in fucked up shit like "bow to me," "submit to my will," or "accept your place." I threw the magazine in the trash and paced around my living room.

My space is a small one-bedroom in a complex labeled 'Luxury Apartments' even though they're just apartments. The balcony has a sizeable sliding glass door. I saw movement on the balcony as I paced.

Small things crawled over the railing. Just a few at first. A spider or two and some beetles skittered to the glass door. I couldn't help but watch as they tapped on the glass. I bent down to examine them and noticed the bugs were broken.

The beetles looked dry and cracked. The spider was missing part of its abdomen and a back leg. Then more came.

A torrent of bugs came rushing over the railing of my balcony. I watched in disgusted silence as they tore each other apart, pushing toward me.

They flooded my balcony with their twitching, broken appendages. As I stared at the churning pit of bugs, I realized they were all dead.

Then I heard deep, rich laughter coming from all around me. I looked for the source of the laughter and saw no one. But as I turned back, I saw my image in the glass of my balcony door. My eye was glowing. My reflection was laughing.

Feb 27

Everything is still fucked. It's so fucked. I can't believe just how fucked it is.

If I hadn't spent a day filling garbage bags with dead bugs, I would probably think I was crazy, but I'm not crazy, and I have the bugs to prove it.

I didn't keep all of them. That would be nuts. I put a handful in a clear plastic Ziplock bag in my freezer. Those little fuckers are dead, and they had been dead for a long fucking time. That's fucking evidence. Maybe not to anyone else, but it is to me. I know this whole thing is batshit, and I can't tell anyone, but I'm not fucking crazy. So there. Fuck off.

I don't know who I'm telling to fuck off. It felt right.

Feb 28

I have a demon living inside me, and he's a cunt.

The fucker won't shut up. He always has something fucked up to say, and half the time, it's in Latin.

The only thing I've been able to catch is 'mentes suas perdat et oculos'. Translate dot com says that fun little phrase means 'lose their minds and eyes.' The only reason I know that much was because fuckface repeated it for three hours while I was trying to sleep.

I gave up, took a sleeping pill, and was treated to, I'm guessing, memories of hell or Europe, I'm not sure which. Either way, I saw a lot of people on spikes. What a fucking joy that was.

When I woke up, he started in again with the Latin, but I found out that playing Baby Shark on YouTube shuts the fucker up. It gave me time to think and to look shit up.

It's impressive what absolute fuckery humans have put on the internet about demons. The number of search results that are just porn is staggering. I only found helpful stuff when I excluded the words anime, hentai, and porn from the search results.

It's been a rough few months.

I'll try to talk to the pig fucker tonight. I'm heading out to buy some crap at a new-age shop. If I can't get the altar and incense to work, I'll crank up Baby Shark until my head explodes.

Also, fuck this guy.

Mar 1

Evocation. Clair at the Circle of Light new age shop taught me that word after I hobbled in and told her what I was doing. Clair is a slight woman in her mid-forties with streaks of gray splashed through her chestnut hair. She asked if she could help, and I told her the truth. Who would believe her? She works in a new-age store.

Clair's reaction was a surprise. She seemed excited, very excited. Possibly too excited. Her green eyes widened as she suppressed a smile. She bounced on her toes, and the light multicolored shawl draped over her shoulders flapped up and down like butterfly wings as she gestured.

"We have just what you need. I can only imagine the spiritual trauma that you have endured. I want you to know that we at the circle of light are ready to help in any way we can." She said as she gestured around the store.

At first, the suspicious little part of my brain thought this pixie woman was about to drain my bank account, but she didn't. She walked me around the store while loading a few little things into my basket and spouting a steady stream of demonology lore. By the end of the walk, my basket was half full, and she gave me the employee discount.

Clair pressed a blue business card into my hand and said, "I am a priestess, so if you have any questions about drawing the demon out, don't hesitate to call."

Then she hugged me and helped me out to my car. The whole experience made me feel happy and cared for. It was nice.

My day was going great until I unpacked my purchases and tried to evocate the little shit.

Every time I have seen the fucker, it's been in a dark reflection. So I cleared the bathroom counter and set up my tools like Clair showed me.

I placed the pentagram tile on the counter and put the cup on top. The candles were placed at every point of the pentagram.

Then I turned off the bathroom lights and meditated until I was free of corrupting thoughts and crap. Then I pulled the batteries from my fire alarm and burned the sage.

Somehow sage is supposed to cleanse things even though it smells like sweaty gym socks. I won't question it. My cynicism left the moment the dead bugs flooded my balcony.

I lit the candles, pricked my finger with a lancet, and squeezed two drops of blood into the cup. Well, that's what I tried to do.

It took me a minute to prick myself. I've seen enough of my blood to last the rest of my life, and seeing more freaked me out more than I thought it would.

Standing in my bathroom, I wondered how I became the dumb fuck summoning a demon. I guess I was evoking. The fucker was already in me. I was just trying to talk to the shitbag.

Eventually, I pricked my finger and squeezed two drops out. How do diabetics do that every day? It fucking sucks.

It wasn't long before my eye began to glow.

"Have you come to supplicate yourself before me?" It said.

I could see my reflection speaking. It looked like me, but there was a cruelty about its expression that I had never seen on my face.

"I don't know what supplicate means. It's one of those words I have an Idea about but don't actually have a definition." I quipped.

"Know your place," It commanded, and its smile was arrogant and oh-so punchable. That expression I had seen before. It's a smile I often use when I think I'm winning an argument.

Suddenly, I had a newfound appreciation for my mom. With smug grins like that, I don't know how she didn't beat the shit out of me. I mean, I wanted to punch myself after just one look.

"Who are you, and what do you want?" I said with way more bravado than I felt.

Its deep voice roared, "Do not question me, human." Then a knot of pain bloomed in my chest.

I couldn't breathe or talk. It watched me and smiled.

"Do you understand your place now? I kept you alive. I am the master of the dead and dying. I am your master. Without me, you are rancid meat." Then it waved its arm, and the pain disappeared.

"You kept me alive in the barn," I asked. I felt confused and scared as I looked up at my image.

"Indeed, I did, mortal. I showed you mercy. In return, you will submit, and I will be your benevolent king." it said.

It smirked again, and I hated my fucking face.

Why would this thing keep me alive? Maybe it's lying. Three days alive staked to a barn floor is a long time.

Then it clicked. I'm no one, so it must have needed something. It might still need something.

"No, thank you," I said. I could feel myself starting to smirk, but I stopped myself.

My reflection looked down at me in disgust. "You do not have a choice." It waved its hand, and the pain in my chest bloomed again.

I crumpled to the floor, but on my way down to the tile, I hit play on my phone.

Baby Shark rang out. Its dodododododo heralded the end of my chest pain.

"What does a baby shark have to do with anything?" it screamed. "Is it a chant? Have the monks of this world gone mad?" it bellowed.

I glared at my reflection.

"I've worked with lawyers like you. Real fucking douchebags that push and bully people into signing contracts that suck balls. Well, no, thank you. I have something you want, so sit and spin, goat fucker." I said and flipped my reflection off.

My chest clenched again, but it wasn't as painful. It was a bad idea to antagonize the demon. I knew that. But everything hurt, and Baby Shark was playing, so part of me felt unhinged. Like, I just didn't care.

The light in my eye began to fade. It was going back to wherever it hid in my head, and I learned it could give me a heart attack. So, yay.

Mar 2

A woman came to my door. I didn't let her in. Call me paranoid, but my mom is the only person I let into my home after the incident.

The lady on the other side of the door introduced herself as Payton Pauh.

She was one of the shit kicker's wives. I recognized her name from an article I read about my kidnapping.

You ever see someone and wondered why they married the person they married. This was one of those moments. Payton Pauh took care of herself. Her husband, Pooh Bear, was a tubby, neck-bearded fuck that held a dagger over my open chest.

Pooh bear's wife spent time in the gym and on her makeup and clothes. She looked young but poised like a tv talking head with her impeccable knit blazer and a little black dress.

I had a pretty fucked up week trying to draw out that shit-bag demon. I had no interest in talking to the wife of my almost-murderer. So I kept it short.

"What the fuck do you want!" I yelled through the door.

She didn't seem surprised by my outburst. She didn't even move. She smiled gently at the peephole, and suddenly I felt cold sweat on my neck.

"I would like to talk," she said.

"So, talk," I said as pressure built behind my eyes.

"May I come in?"

"No. You can talk where you're at." My head started to throb, and I leaned against the door.

"I understand you don't feel comfortable in my presence," she said.

A loud ringing started in my head. I felt nauseous, and I slid to the floor. "Go away," I yelled. "I don't want you anywhere near me."

"I only wish to apologize. Please, may I come in?"

My chest cramped, and I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.

"Are you okay, Mr. Jacobs? Can I help you? Let me in, and I can help you."

Payton pounded on the door as I crawled away.

"LET ME IN" she screamed.

The pain in my chest worsened with every movement. I pulled my phone from my pocket, but it slipped. My hands were wet with tears. I hadn't realized I was crying. I picked up my phone and fumbled with the screen. Baby Shark echoed through my apartment just before I passed out.

Mar 3

Today has been more surreal than the others this week, and that's fucking saying something.

I woke up on the floor. Baby Shark was still playing. Groaning, I sat up and saw my reflection glaring at me from the black of my television screen. It crossed its arms.

"We need to talk," it said. "Please end that miserable song."

It was the 'please' that made me turn off Baby Shark. Moms correct. Politeness goes a long way.

"I'm listening," I said as I leaned against the couch. My head didn't hurt anymore, but I still felt like a car accident.

"The woman at the door. Beball lives inside her. I could sense him." My reflection said.

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. "I don't understand what you just said. I don't know anything about demons, and I don't know who you are."

It nodded its understanding. "I am Sperion, the Bishop of Paimon, and I have abandoned my position."

Part of me wanted to joke about how he would only be able to move diagonally, but I stopped myself.

"You went AWOL, so is Beball the demon police?" I asked.

"Beball is a king of hell and the servant of our master King Paimon." It said.

I stared into my reflection and felt exhaustion that wasn't my own. This demon was tired. It wanted to rest.

"What happened?" I asked. "How did I get sucked into this?"

"I will tell you. We will build trust, you and I."

I would never trust this thing, but I held my tongue and listened.

Half of my television turned on, one side of the screen was black, but on the other side, instead of a television program, I saw a barn. I saw myself staked to a floor, my chest wide open, and a man crouched beside me. When my brain understood what I was looking at. I panicked and reached the kitchen before my leg gave out and I collapsed.

My breath was short and quick. Then something broke, and I sobbed loud, gasping sobs. I pressed my hands against my chest, feeling for a heartbeat as the tears streamed down my face. Then I checked for my pulse, and it was there. Counting the beats, I could feel the panic settling.

Sperion watched me from the dark screen of the microwave. The expression it wore on my face was wary and cautious.

"My apologies," it said. "I've never understood mortals or their sensibilities. I only wished to show you what happened and why."

I stayed silent and waited.

"I will no longer try to harm you or take what I want by force," it said. "There is no time for games. We must build trust. I see no other way to survive."

I nodded even though I had no idea why it had dropped the demanding dictator routine.

"Okay, I want answers. I just need to go slow." I said as questions started to make a cue around my brain.

I limped back to the living room, and my television showed a different angle of the barn. I was still staked in the center of a large circle, but now I could see a second circle and a chicken tethered at the center of it.

"What's the second circle and the chicken for?" I asked as I ignored the part of the screen that showed me splayed open like a gutted fish.

"That circle is for me." Sperion took on a professorial expression as he explained. "A sigil inscribed in a circle identifies a demon and calls the spirit. Invocation is one of a few human magics."

"Yeah, we're all good at asking for the manager." I quipped." Whose sigil is in my circle?" I asked as my eyes skimmed around my broken form.

"That is King Paimon's sigil. See how the circles touch? "Sperion pointed to a point in between the two circles. "They are linked. The summoned would move freely between the two circles. The coven was attempting to summon King Paimon and me at the same time. I believe they were to be rewarded for my capture."

"What went wrong?"

"The man assigned to kill you hesitated. I was summoned, and in the moments before your sacrifice, I scoured their minds and drove them mad. They tore at each other like beasts. Unfortunately, you were about to die. This wouldn't normally be of concern, but your death would summon Paimon. I decided to possess you and keep you alive. I don't know why I am not in control of your body. You were not in any position to fight my control, yet we are separate."

I didn't want to believe a goddamn thing that toe sniffer said but its explanation seemed plausible.

I changed the subject. "So Beball is hunting you down, and he's inside that Payton Pauh lady."

"He is hunting us, Mr. Jacob's. Beball will slaughter you to get to me."

A demon wants to kill me, even after all the shit I've been through. My brain blanked. Standing in my living room, unthinking and stupefied, a small part of me had questions.

Why is my luck so fucked? What did I do to deserve this shit? Was it a past-life thing? If so, I must have been a raging tool. I know bad things always happen to relatively good people, but this seemed excessive.

I shuddered and forced myself to focus on the world around me. Sperion had stopped talking, but he was watching me intently from my reflection on the television.

Closing my eyes, I tried to pretend that I was alone. I took a deep breath as the beginning of a plan formed in my head.

"Okay," I said. "The first thing we'll need is a restraining order. Is Beball still around?"

Sperion gestured to the window.

Sitting in her car just outside my window, Payton Pauh's eyes met mine as I looked down at her. I backed away from the curtain and grabbed my camera. With a few pictures, I might qualify for a stalking order of protection.

Then I called Clair, the priestess I met at the new age shop, and had a fucked-up conversation about how to exorcise a demon. According to Clair, demons can't be destroyed or hurt but can be driven out. Sperion listened intently as I made plans to evict him from my brain.

Clair offered to bring the other priestesses from her circle and banish Sperion over the weekend. I asked if there was a way to do it sooner, but Saturday was the only time she knew she could get the rest of the priestesses together. They planned on having a girl's night but wouldn't mind banishing a demon before they went out for drinks.

After the call, I sat in front of my TV and addressed my reflection. "So, the plan is to exorcise you before Beball comes and rips you out. Any objections?"

"None from me." Sperion said." You may die, but I have no complaints."

"Well, maybe I'm already dead." I smiled a too-wide smile at my reflection. "It's hard to tell if this is real life or the last struggling thoughts of a dying brain."

"I can assure you, Mr. Jacobs, you are alive. I spent a lot of energy ensuring you did not die in that circle."

"Thank you, Sperion," I said.

The demon watched me cautiously.

"I mean it. You had your reasons, and things could have turned out much differently, but I'm grateful to be alive. If nothing else, this extra time allows me to tell the few people in my life how much I care about them. So, thank you for that."

Sperion said nothing, and somehow, I knew that he had retreated into the recesses of my brain.

Standing, I grabbed my camera and left the apartment. It was time to file for a restraining order.

Mar 1

It's nice to have friends at court. I got lucky at the courthouse and ran into a judge I used to work with. The restraining order was granted in record time. It was a complete fluke, but maybe Karma was trying to pay down her tab.

After the courthouse, I spent time with mom. Now sheâ€™s knitting sweaters. I was told to lie on top of old newspapers, so she could trace my form. Mom doesn't believe in tape measures.  

I spent the rest of the night calling old friends. I meant what I said to Sperion. I'm using my extra time to tell the people I think of as friends how much they mean to me. It was an emotional night.

Mar 5

I spent the last few days getting my affairs in order just in case everything goes tits up tomorrow.

Sperion has been quiet, but sometimes I catch a reflection watching me.

I have yet to see Payton Pauh around. The restraining order has done its job for now.

I called Clair and asked if I should be doing anything to prepare. She recommended centering my Chi and offered me some teas with a mild laxative effect. So now I'm not sure if she wants me to relax or poop. I'll try to do both. What could it hurt?

Mar 6.

Today is the day.

I tried to meditate. I don't know if it worked, but I did it.

I pooped.

Guess I'm ready to be exorcised.

I'll go to Clair's shop in about an hour. I'm kind of freaking out. It wasn't long ago that I didn't believe in this shit.

I feel small somehow.

Mar 7

What a fucking cluster fuck. God Fucking damn, that was a mother fucking shit spiral. At least no one died.

Where to fucking start. Do I start at the dead bear that crashed through Claire's shop or with the fact that none of the ladies in Clair's coven actually believe in demons? I guess they fucking believe now, but they didn't before maggot bear knocked down the door.

Clair is the only true believer in the group. The other ladies were using the coven to socialize and fantasize about having power. They were not fucking ready for a dead 500lb black bear to knock down the door in the middle of the ceremony and drip maggots all over the floor.

No one is ready for a maggot-dripping bear.

There were so many maggots. I knew something fucked up was in the realm of possibilities, but fuck.

The whole coven hid behind Clair as she called upon spirits. She was holding her own. I grabbed a broom to hit the bear with and caught my reflection on a stainless-steel shelf. My right eye was lit up like the mother fucking sun.

I started baby shark, put the phone next to my ear, and the bear dropped. Then it popped and splashed all over the floor. There is a lot of gas and liquid in dead bears.

The coven left. I stayed behind and helped Clair pick up her store. She was sad, but Clair didn't dwell on the negative, and she was much happier when we sopped up the last of the bear bits.

Before I left, I apologized again and offered to pay for the damages. Clair waved me away, claiming she had insurance covering it. Then I bought the most expensive thing in her store that was intact. It was an Aluminum Singing Bowl. Whatever the hell that is.

I spent the rest of the night chastising myself. The problem was, I thought I knew what Sperion wanted. I did not. He didn't want to leave my body. I can't believe I was arrogant enough to think I understood a demon's goals.

Now that I think about it, why did I take his word that this Beball guy was after him? I forgot the first rule of being a paralegal. Never trust anything anyone says ever. Verify. Verify. Verify.

Mar 8

Yeah, she's a fucking Demon. I just saw that bitch bite the head off a live fish.

This is what happened. I called Jaison Hearne and hired him to check out Payton Pauh.

Jaison is an investigator. I've worked with him but have not been in the room when he presents his findings. He's someone the higher-ups in the law firm whisper about and only call when weird shit happens.

I didn't give Jaison all the specifics, he didn't need to know about the demon in my head, but I told him Payton was dangerous and that her husband was one of the fuck ups that tried to murder me. 

"What demon were they trying to summon?" He asked.

The question unsettled me, but I answered, "They were trying to summon Paimon and Sperion. I think they also tried to summon one called Beball." I said and then laughed nervously.

"They'd just need Abalam to complete the quartet," he said.

"What," I blurted, surprised that Jaison knew about demons.

"Paimon, Beball, and Abalam are kings of the western kingdom. Paimon is the head guy, but they are all kings. Sperion is a bishop, but if you ask me, the Sloane manuscript always came out of the left field."

"What?" I said dully.

"Don't worry about it." He said. "I'll check her out. Oh, stay away from black mirrors until I call you. Better to be safe than sorry." Then he hung up.

I covered my tv with towels and stashed my laptop and cell phone in my bedroom closet. Then I went back to bed.

No dreams for once. That was nice.

It was 5pm when Jaison called back. It was hard to believe that he had found anything already, but I knew something had happened from the terse way he greeted me.

"How open-minded are you?" Jaison began.

"Very," I answered without hesitation.

"You have a demon problem. I'd say Beball from the way she was gobbling up frogs."

"What," I said.

"Open your email." He instructed. "I sent you a link. It's been a while since I've seen a demon walk around so casually."

"Do you have any advice?" I asked as I pulled my laptop out of the closet and opened my email.

Jaison sighed, "I hate to say it, but having religious faith is usually the best way to scare off a demon. It doesn't matter what religion. Whatever you are personally into should keep demons away, especially if you go full zealot. But in truth, it's trading one spirit for another. Either way, you're possessed. However, if the demon is in someone like Mrs. Pauh, use a shotgun."

"Howâ€™s Mrs. Pauh different?"

Releasing a long breath, Jaison said, "I'll email you some photos."

The email had two photos. One photo was of Payton Pauh. The other was of a very obese woman on a motorized scooter with oxygen tubes running into her nostrils.

"Who's the lady on the rascal?" I asked.

"That is Payton Pauh one month ago." He said.

"What?!"

"That was my reaction," Jaison said. "That photo was taken at a church potluck one month ago. She had to give herself completely to a demon to make a transformation like that. Check out the video link.â€œ

The video showed Payton walking near the Forest Park fish hatchery. The small ponds were a favorite place to show city kids how to catch and release fish. She hiked up her dress and waded into the water. After scanning the pond, her right hand shot out and snagged a large pan fish. She turned to walk up the bank when a frog jumped into her path. She lunged with her left hand and caught the bloated amphibian by the foot.

Payton raised the struggling frog above her head. Slowly as she lowered the frog, her jaw lolled open, her mouth distended, and her writhing tongue snatched the frog and pulled it into her open maw.

Then she bit the head off the fish.

I closed the video. The reflection on my laptop caught my attention.

Sperion said. "Beball molds flesh. He corrupts living tissues and incorporates them into the being he possesses. Then he transforms the flesh to meet his needs."

"What does that mean?" I whispered to my reflection.

Sperion continued. "Often Beball will accompany Paimon to mortal offerings, consume the offering, and create a delicacy that pleases Paimons pallet."

"He'd make it from his own body?" I blurted.

"Yes. Beball cuts the portion from his body and prepares it."

I felt nauseous.

From the phone, I heard, "You have a demon in you, don't you, Nick?"

I forgot Jaison was on the phone. I took a deep breath and held it as pressure built behind my eyes.

Blowing out my breath, I said, "Yes. I have a demon."

"What's its name?" Jaison said in an even, flat tone.

"Sperion," I replied, my voice small. I felt wrung out and numb. Admitting I was carrying a demon to someone I worked with diminished me.

"Has it forced you to do anything?"

"NO!". I said too loudly. "No. it talks to me, and I can see it on dark reflective surfaces, but it hasn't forced me to do anything." I paused, a dark thought crossing my mind. "I don't think it has. Would I even know?"

"You would know," Jaison said confidently.

Jaison seemed knowledgeable, and the senior partners at the law firm trusted him. Suddenly, I wanted to tell him everything. "I haven't done anything, but Sparion has called dead things to me. He controls the dead, insects, or any dead animal. When I tried to have him exorcized, he animated a dead bear.

It wrecked Claire's shop, The Circle of Light. The bear just tore through the place."

Jaison was quiet for a moment, but I heard the clacking of typing, so I knew he was still there.

"You are in an unusual situation, Nick," he said.

"God, I know it."

"I don't mean demon possession. Spirits always float in and out of people, but demons are assholes. The fact that you aren't a puppet is unusual. You can talk about the demon freely. Usually, during a possession asking for help or talking about the demon is off the table. If this was a standard demon possession, you would be a helpless observer." 

"Do you have any idea why this is happening?" I said and inwardly cringed at the desperation in my voice.

"You're in new territory."

"That's what Sperion said."

"You might get him to leave on his own. All spirits have free will. Most spirits only stay long enough to give inspiration or plant an idea. Unfortunately, demons are power-hungry narcissists that need to be in control."

Hiding my anger and astonishment, I asked, "They can just leave?"

"They can go anytime, as far as I know."

My left eye began twitching.

"I'll make some calls," Jaison said. "There might be someone who's heard of a situation like yours. In the meantime, you may want to salt your home. Sprinkle salt in the corners and on either side of your doors. It's not foolproof, but if Mrs. Pauh comes knocking on your door, it will help."

I thanked Jaison for his time and ended the call. Then I stood before my TV, staring at my reflection on the dark screen.

"Get out here, you mother fucker," I demanded.

In my reflection, my right eye began to glow.

Sperion wouldn't look at me. He looked like a petulant child with his arms crossed and a frown turning down the edges of his mouth.

"You can just fucking leave," I asked in a whisper.

Sperion eyed me imperiously before responding. "Normally, yes, I would be able to leave. I've tried to leave." Sperion paused before continuing, "I'm trapped and do not know why."

So far, my demon hitchhiker had been telling me the truth. I needed information if I was going to give him the benefit of the doubt.

"What happened with the bear?" I growled.

"Everything I've done, I've done in good faith," Sperion said quickly.

"Explain it to me," I said too calmly.

"The exorcism was working," Sperion said. "I could feel the spirit Ms. Cohen worships pressing against me. I summoned the bear because there was nowhere to go. No door to exit, just unyielding pressure. I did what I needed to do and will not apologize for it."

"Maybe next time, use your words, you fucking toddler," I said, fuming.

We were at an impasse, and I don't enjoy arguing. That's probably why I became a paralegal instead of a lawyer. So, I dropped it. Why start shit?

That's the end of the journal. I've spent last night getting ready. This is a quick and dirty summary of what's been happening.

I bought a shit ton of salt.

Beball/Payton Pauh has been circling the apartment. She's been just on the edge of Sperions perceptions. I don't know what changed, but she attacked half an hour ago.

Sperion told me he felt Beball outside my building. I looked out the window, and Payton was staring up at me. I immediately called the police.

I watched the carnage as the police officer confronted Payton. Her head shot forward, neck elongating, and she bit his hand off. Her head then flopped to the ground, and she chewed on the hand as her head reeled itself back onto her shoulders. Then her fingers turned to points, and she began scaling up the side of my building.

Stepping away from the window, I added an extra layer of salt to the salt berm I built around the inside of my apartment.

I salted my balcony, and I truly enjoyed watching that frog-eating bitch bounce off the invisible barrier and fall to the sidewalk below. I only celebrated a little before running out of my apartment and pouring salt around the hallway and the space in front of my door.

I ran back inside and nearly lost my lunch as the Payton thing fixed itself. Her guts slurped back into her body as sirens cut through the air. Then she disappeared into my apartment building as five police cars, and an ambulance raced onto the street.

I've been preparing for this, but it's more than I expected. I barricaded the door. I also made concentric salt rings inside my apartment.

Sperion screams when I walk over the top of a salt ring. It makes me laugh every time.

I've been waiting and typing while the Payton thing makes it through some salt circles in the hallway. Now it's pounding at my door. I say 'thing' because it doesn't look human anymore. I glanced through the peephole, and the face was still Payton's, but the body was rippling and bulging in really fucked up ways.

I plan to trap it in my apartment with salt and then leave. I aim to stop it long enough to get to my car and drive away. If I can go far enough, it won't sense Sperion.

No matter what, I need to get this insanity away from my mom. She does not need this shit in her life.

I've learned a ton from Jaison and Clair, but I'm all ears if anyone knows how to get rid of a demon.
