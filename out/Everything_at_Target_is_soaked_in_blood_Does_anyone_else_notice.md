When I was a kid, I’d always shop at JCPenney when it was time to go back to school. Then the JCPenney closed, and we switched to Target. I’m not sure if the blood was always there, and I just didn’t notice it, but by the time I turned thirteen, I couldn’t ignore it anymore. 

The clothes were the worst, of course. All the shirts and pants were wet to the touch. The plastic bags full of socks squished when I touched them. 

My dad and my little sister Mia didn’t seem to notice. I saw her take shirt after shift into the dressing room, and she’d come out with her skin and hair smeared red and stinking of iron. But then she’d just smile and do a twirl in the mirror and head back to try on another one.

I thought about mentioning it, but since both of them seemed not to notice, it seemed like a bad idea.

“Dad,” I said. “I think I’m going to throw up. Can I wait outside?”

“Good idea,” he said. He handed me a five dollar bill. “Sometimes cold water helps.”

As I started walked for the exit, I felt something wet fall against my nose. I looked up at the ceiling to see all of the rectangular tiles up there rimmed red, the fluorescent lights dripping liquid. And when my own breath grew quiet, I began to hear a low moan, like a thousand dying men gurgling a forgotten hymn.

I began to run and slipped in a sticky pool. I was covered in a wet smear now, my clothes soggy and sticky at the same time, as if I’d murdered someone and rolled around in the evidence. The hymn was growing louder, the singers invisible. I tried not to scream as I ran and ran, the other shoppers giving me strange looks as I finally found the exit and departed into the hot, dry air.

I sat on the curb, trying to catch my breath. Trying to pretend it was all a bad dream, but every time I saw someone exit the store, their cart full of clothes or groceries or toys, the stuff was all drenched with blood, another reminded. 

Later, my dad and Mia emerged from the store with soggy shopping bags and tossed them in the trunk of the van. The whole way home, I heard the blood sloshing around in the bottoms of the bags.

Back at home, my mom saw the panicked look in my eyes and said we should talk.

“You saw it, didn’t you?” she asked, and I nodded weakly.

“What happened?” I asked.

“I’m not really sure,” she said. “But it’s something I started to notice when I was a teenager. Everything at Sears was just dripping with blood. Wal-Mart too. If you start to look carefully, you’ll see some items are worse than others. Like, stuff from certain countries is just *drenched.* Or companies that use… certain kinds of labor.”

“I gave her a confused look.”

“Well, like, places where they don’t protect the workers very well,” my mom explained. “Try unboxing a phone sometime. You’ll see. The whole case will just be soaked. That’s why I always do it outside. Handmade stuff is usually a bit better.”

“Is it really blood?”

“I think so. Or… maybe some kind of ghost blood. My personal theory is that when workers die or get hurt producing things, it adds a kind of psychic residue.”

“But what do we do?” I asked. “How do we make it go away?”

“We can’t,” really, she said apologetically. “You just sort of learn to live with it. I try to see the bright side. I try to only buy stuff I *really* need. Now you can do the same.”

She gave me a little hug and a smile. Then she headed back to the garden, where she was harvesting carrots. Those, at least, were blood-free.

Upstairs in my room, I saw now that everything I’d held so precious was now filthy, stained with dried blood, disgusting to look at. Red-brown smears caked by Barbies’ hair, my favorite dresses, my shoes. There was nothing left unstained.

For a second, I just stood there. And then I started screaming. I screamed and screamed until my mother ran upstairs.

“Make it go away,” I said, crying in her arms. “Make it go away.”

“Oh honey, I wish I could,” she said. “But you’ve seen it now. [Welcome to the real world.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
