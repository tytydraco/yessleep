I wish I didn’t have a TV. For starters, I’m a 18 year old university student who lives in a rural part of Washington (the state). On the first day of university, I got to choose a new dorm with the counselor. I got to choose my dorm first. There were multiple dorms, all with hefty prices, but there was one that stood out. This specific dorm was free. I chose the free dorm, and looked at the counselor. He looked at me, with wide open eyes. He looked genuinely scared. I got the keys later that day, and went to my dorm. It was a typical dorm, with worn out wood and a small TV. I looked at my reflection in the TV, and looked at my filthy old bed, and smiled. This was my home. The black remote was sitting next to the TV, and it was dusty. Beside these things, there was a little handbook next to it, with a few tiny sheets of paper in the deal. On the cover of the handbook it said RULES, with bolded and italicized white lettering, and a velvety red cover. I was a bit confused, but thought it was a guide to the remote. I read through them carefully.

1. Do not turn on the TV from 12:00 A.M. to 3:00 A.M. If you do so, serious actions will be taken into place.


I was nervous. 

“What?” I muttered. Maybe it was a way to conserve energy. I kept reading.


2. If an emergency alert comes on at all during the night, go into the bathroom, and lay face down in the bathtub for seven minutes straight. After that, lock yourself in the bathroom, and fall asleep in the bathroom.


This had to be some twisted prank. A fluke made by a couple of the other students. 
Just in case, I kept reading.


3. If someone knocks on the door a singular time, and the TV turns to static, knock twice back on the door, and turn off the TV. Sit straight up, and don’t look under the bed for any reason whatsoever until exactly 24 hours after.

4. If the TV turns to static without knocking, turn on the main lights, and fall asleep in the closet. Make sure to LOCK THE CLOSET.

5. If you hear footsteps, and the TV quickly shuffles channels, try and fall asleep as quickly as you can, without opening your eyes.

6. Do NOT change to channel 61. If you accidentally do, there is no turning back


As nightfall came, I decided to turn on the TV. I though it was a joke. I picked up the remote, clicked the ON button, and as it flickered on, I watched as the show started playing. It also listed the channel number with it. I cried in horror as it said “Channel 61”. I then saw something with my peripheral vision. A dark orb. I quickly ran into my bathroom, locked myself in, and with the few essentials I have - some water, a tiny bit of food, a laptop - I wrote this post.
