If you're wondering why I'm posting about my experiences on Reddit instead of, well, being normal and telling people in person is because i have before. Outside of a few close friends or family, most of the few souls I've told either think I'm making up some kind of campfire story or don't believe me outright. So to avoid the embarrassment of an actual in person interaction, I'll post it anonymously, and let you decide on Your own whether or not what I'm saying actually occurred so I don't have to try and convince of there validity.

I live in a small(ish) town in New-England, with a population of about 11,000 (as of 2022). We live very far from any major city, so because of that we have currently only 7 (not including the chief) officers, which, surprisingly, as far as I know is the most we've ever had, and certainly is the most we've had since i started. At the time of the story I'm going to tell, we only had 4 officers (not including our chief). Peter who was my trainer and then partner, Steve and Gansy who worked the day shift usually, and Patrick, who was a bit older than the rest of us and would usually stay in the station unless he was filling in for one of us. One of the better side effects of being in a small town, is that not many crimes get committed. We have the occasional pickpocket thief, or a few drunken residents fighting each other over God knows what, or sometimes the rare burglary every year or two. But despite this, I still have more than handful of creepy, bizarre or even downright horrifying stories. I'll start with one that strangely stands out to me, even though some of My other stories are sure to keep you up at night from just hearing about them, let alone experiencing them firsthand, for it's totally unexplainable, and on top of that, it's also my first strange experience that i had as a cop so it's just that little bit more special to me.

Peter and I just stopped for coffee at about 0330 hours, we got a call from dispatch about a 911 hangup call leading back to an old street. Peter remembered the address but he couldn't quite put his finger on from where. It didn't take long to get there, maybe about 10 minutes when we pulled onto the unpaved street, and after maybe 15 seconds we could see the old rickety house through the tree line. it looked like a farmhouse that would have been built somewhere in the 1800s, except without the farm land and as though it had several revitalization's. we pulled up in front of the house and it didn't take Peter long to realize why he remembered the address, about a year before his own training ended (so no later than 02 or 03) he was dispatched to the same goddamn house, also, for 911 hangups. it was three times he was called out there, all in the same week too. An older man lived there at the time, maybe mid-late 40s. the man was agitated or confused at Peter and his trainer for showing up at his house, for seemingly no reason at all, and also for it being the odd hours of the night (AM hours too). He apparently was nice enough to let them do a sweep of the house the first time, but after that he wasn't having it. apparently the man went missing, and only one other family moved in. now, the house laid abandoned and overrun with vegetation.

as Peter was telling me his story we were doing a sweep of the exterior of the home. checking the windows, he checked the front door, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary and our calls out for a response yielded zero response. i went around the back and checked the backdoor... And, it was unlocked. I was startled by it just opening like that, startled enough to slap my hand against my pistol. I peered into the decrepit doorway, it was, of course, too dark to see anything, so i called for Peter, and he went around back to meet me. we told Dispatch our intention, and went into the house, Peter in front of me. Almost immediately, i felt my nose get stuffy, and i tried to hold back a sneeze. every goddamn surface was coated in dust, an unruly amount of dust, maybe an inch thick. I looked back at one of my footprints and it looked like i was walking in snow. There were a few dead rodents and many insects we had to walk over, but other than that we cleared the main floor fine, except in the living room. there was a break in the dust, a thin, clear trail leading from the front door (which was locked) to the basement steps. someone very recently had been here. "Could they have called 911 to get an officer here to ambush them?" I thought to myself. Then suddenly there was a crash or a bang coming from the basement, it cut straight through my thought process like a hot knife through butter. We drew our pistols and Peter yelled out "Police! Show yourself!"... no response. we traversed the stairway downstairs, the basement was surprisingly the most clean part of the house that i had been in. it wasn't freakishly coated in dust, but, it looked lived in. there were sleeping bags, books, candles, an old rotary phone and even food wrappers.

A bunch of boxes looked knocked over that would have previously been underneath an open window on ground level. I guess I missed it when I did the sweep as it would have been at my feet. I walked over to the window, and Peter went to the room next over. I examined the glass, the window wasn't open, it was smashed. There weren't glass shards everywhere, so i figured this was old, old enough for someone to have come by and clean it up. Then Peter called my name. "Hey, Walsh... um, uh, there's something you should come see." "Whats going on?" I responded as I made my way to the other room. there, laid a mans dead body, maybe mid-late 40s. It looked fresh and bloated (bodies naturally bloat after 2-3 days of decomposition). Peter pushed the bodies hand with his foot and it looked stiff in movement. I called dispatch and relaid what we just came across, and quick came the Medical Team, Coroners, Examiners or whoever else was there. We watched as they did their thing, making sure to stay out of their way.

Gansy and Patrick got there too, with a few officers from the city, I didn't see a detective but I'm sure one was present. when Patrick met us downstairs he told us in between smoking his cigarette that "You two oughtta head back to the Station, uh, Chief's wanna talk to you." "Hold on." Peter responded. "I want to know how old the body truly is.". Patrick sighed but didn't stop him. I followed him to one of the examiners. he told us the body was 4 days old based off of the Rigor Mortis, Livor Mortis, and shit i couldn't even begin to try and spell. Peter seemed uncomfortable with this answer, and so as we left I asked him "So whats going on with you and the deceased guy? Did you know him?" A moment of silence passed. "In a sense, yeah." Peter continued. "I'll tell you in the car.". We ducked under the Police tape, passed a few more cops, And made it to the car. Peter didn't look too good, he looked pale like paint, and i noticed his breathing was slightly heavy, so I said "so... uhhh..." an uncomfortable silence passed before Peter spoke up. "That man in the house, was the same man who lived there over 10 years ago, when i was dispatched for the hangup calls." I processed what he said with amusement as i thought he was joking or pranking me so i responded kind of lightheartedly. "So he went missing, came back 10 years later and died, i guess." I let out a soft chuckle, but Peter was not amused. "That's exactly what i remember him looking like back then. It's like he didn't age!". Taken aback by what he was saying, I didn't have a good enough response in my mind, so I just stayed quiet; the entire car ride was quiet.

We got to the station at about 0500 hours, spoke to the chief, spent an hour writing a stupid report, and got some much needed z's. The next two days Peter was out, for some reason, I'm sure our Chief knew but I didn't bother to ask him. Me and Patrick (who if you remember was generally our fill in) were together. we stayed on patrol and didn't go to the crime scene from the night before, and later two nights before. On the second night, all the information about the case that trickled down to me went stale, so I got the police reports and Coroners report to finally know if Peter was correct in his memory, or hell, whether he was lying was also a thought of mine. The mans name was "Franklin Weston Bentley" he was born on June 23rd 1957, and according to the report his cause of death was undetermined. All of the clothes he was wearing when he died were made before the year 2001 and the manufacturer of the jacket he was wearing went out of business in 2006. He had his drivers license on him too, and when he died it was expired for 4 years. but the final few nails in the coffin for me, to finally believe Peters story was that, he went missing on June 22nd 2003 and there were no leads on his case until the two nights previous. when he went missing he was 45, and when he was found dead, his body had not aged passed that point.
