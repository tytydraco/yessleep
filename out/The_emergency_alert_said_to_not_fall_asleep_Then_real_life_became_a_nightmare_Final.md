To say things have played out weird since then is… an understatement. Know how when you’re in a nightmare, everything that happens is the most illogical shitstorm of a sequence? Like sometimes you’ll just arrive at your next destination, something will appear out of nowhere, nothing is off limits and anything could happen without the slightest hint of justification, that’s how reality is moving right now.

Genuinely. I don’t know how the fuck I got where I am now. I’m hold up at Wally’s all the way on the other side of the town. My car is nowhere to be found, the shotgun is fucking gone, and I’m sitting in the cheese aisle, pile driving through a deli tray like it’s the last meal I’ve ever have. It was like I was sleepwalking the entire time from when I noticed the barrier to now, sitting here stuffing my face. I nearly fucking choked because of how taken aback I was. Reminded me of smoking some bad shit back in my college days and finishing off a fifth of cheap vodka, total blackout. 

My watch said it was around two in the afternoon on Monday now. Hours lost, no idea where. Suddenly someone came around the corner into my aisle, making me stand and get ready to run. 

“Woah, woah, you alright?” A voice asks. Female, probably around my age. Seemed familiar… “Perry, you okay over there?”

”When did I get here?” I asked, realizing my voice was shaking now. She hurried over, putting a hand on my shoulder. I recognize her now, Sarah, one of the cashier girls that works here during the weekdays. 

“About five hours ago. You’ve been pretty out of it though, sayin’ stuff about a wall… looks like you took a pretty nasty bump.” She said. I was starting to notice my surroundings more, the dim grocery store lit by every other halogen bulb in the place, dark overcast lights outside with the occasional lightning. Fuck. It wasn’t a dream.

”There’s more of those… things, out there, yeah?” I said, looking toward the nearest exit now. The deli windows were boarded up tight against the outside, while the front doors were barricaded by all the shopping carts that could be brought in. “God, I can’t remember a damned thing…”

“It’s okay, Perry. All good. Come on over and talk to the others, we’re trying to see if we can put anything together.” She said, beckoning me back toward the stock room. There were four others in there right now, all gathered in a little fort of pallets and supplies. One of them had set up with a knife, sharpening mop handles to use for defence. Two guys, two girls, with Sarah and I joining to bring it to an even split between the six of us. 

“You’re looking rough, man.” Said one of the guys, the one not sharpening broom handles. I recognized him from somewhere but… the face just didn’t quite reconcile with anyone I could think of. “You run into the spines?”

”The centipede things? Yeah.” I said, nodding. The others all murmured agreement. Apparently we had all seen it at this point, surviving to get this far. ”I’m sorry I… I can’t remember how I got here. Nothing makes sense.”

”It’s starting to get that way for all of us.” One of the girls, a blonde covered in tattoos, said. “I was sitting safe in the truck stop off 90 just a few minutes ago and now I’m here. Not a fuckin’ clue how.”

”You’ve been here for a few hours though.” Sarah mentioned, looking at her. The other woman, a smaller brunette with glasses that made her look like the Binoculars from Toy Story, nodded in agreement.  Sarah looked to the Stake guy next, “What about you, stocking up in case of vampires?”

He just kept carving, sharpening one end of a mop handle that was already finished with a wicked point. Even then, he continued. His only words, “I had a baby.”

That was enough for the rest of us to infer what must have happened. Not many humans spend most of their time sleeping, but a baby… Jesus. Poor guy. We left him to his stake sharpening after that.

”Have any other alerts come through?” I asked, looking around to the others. I feel like there’s something I might have missed somewhere, some crucial event, but everything was a blur. Nothing about how I got here made sense, with everyone else sharing similar feelings. At this point even if we could get out of town, would it be too late for us?

”Just the same stuff. Don’t fall asleep, stay awake no matter what, isolate any who may fall asleep, bullshit like that.” The other man said. I still couldn’t place where I knew him from, with big bushy eyebrows that met in the middle and a thick comb over on top of his head. “I was visiting my grandpa at the senior center when things started going crazy. Old people napping everywhere… heads just started popping off like champagne corks.”

”Yeah what the hell is going on with those?” I asked, still trying to gather my bearings. “I thought they were like… bugs.”

”I have a theory that something happens when we enter REM sleep.” Binoculars mentioned. “It awakens whatever makes the spine take over.”

”So that’s just their… their spine?” Tattoo asked now, panic in her eyes. “Swear the one I saw… still had eyes on the end of it, looking at me the entire time it came after. Then those freaky threads that were coming out of it… ugh.”

”Don’t let those touch you.” I mentioned, recounting the story of the Hutch family. They all shuddered, except for Stake, who just kept staring blankly at the sharp point he was making. He stopped carving after a moment, staring at the nasty tip on the javelin he had carved. “Hey man, you… you okay? Be careful with that.”

”I’m sorry, Milly.” He said, standing up and situating the point of the carved handle on his neck, tilting a little ways inward. It was like watching a car crash in slow motion, knowing that you’re about to see something awful yet too terrified to move in time. He situated both hands on the handle, pushing the point into his neck so hard a little bead of blood began to ooze out, and threw himself forward toward the ground. 

The other end of the handle didn’t have a mophead on it, just metal and rubber for holding it in place. It hit the ground, catching on a crack in the concrete that stopped it suddenly, holding it upward at an angle. The force of him falling forward made the point immediately puncture right through the underside of his head, managing to poke far enough through to come out the other side of his skull. 

“God why? Why did he do that?” Sarah was backing away from the body screaming now, while I and the other strange man just jumped back and stopped, unsure of how to process what was going on. Binoculars and Tattoo were holding each other, both in tears. “He’s dead!”

Stake let out a half-gurgle, almost a comical noise as if he was reassuring her he was still somehow kicking. His feet staggered forward a couple of steps, quickly beginning to slip in the blood pooling under him. I motioned for everyone to leave the stock room, heading back into the main store and away from the horror in front of us.

Is it bad if I’m jealous of him? Honestly at the rate this is playing out, taking myself out doesn’t seem like the worst option there is. Better than nodding off and having my spine rip out, anyway. Exhaustion began setting in harder around then, with my irritability immediately beginning to turn up as my tiredness mounted.

Tattoo and Binoculars were still crying. Strange Face wandered off to do his own thing, though I’m not sure what that involved. Sarah was near catatonic at this point, staring off into blanks space behind her register, standing at attention like she was waiting for items to come down the line. The crying began to get on my nerves, sending me elsewhere to try and find something else to keep my mind busy. 

It started to get darker outside, lightning still popping through the clouds on occasion, when I found a small pocket radio on one of the shelves in the back. I swear as I was walking around back there Stake was following my every move though. At some point I’m pretty sure I saw him swivel around on his pole, trying to get a better look at what I was doing. When I checked him though, he had no pulse, eyes glazed over in death. Nonetheless, the feeling persisted.

It took me a minute to find batteries for the radio, but turning it on got me nothing. Just static on every station, blaring out with the same dull drone. I was about to give up when it suddenly shifted, a monotone voice coming over the tinny speaker. 

“-Ease stay awake until the alert is lifted. Thank you. Attention, Collective personnel are on site to assess the situation. If you have found yourself in a class 4 Night Terror, please do not be alarmed. Stay where you are. Find the nearest weapon. Defend yourself. Please stay awake until the alert is lifted. Thank you. Attenti-“ 

I cut it off after the second one, shaking my head. My eyes were beginning to burn from the lack of sleep, drying out something terrible. I pushed the radio aside, not turning it off completely but zoning out into a daydream for a moment. 

“Attention, Collective personell are on site to assess the situation. If you have found yourself in a class 4 Night Terror, please do not be alarmed. Stay where you are. Find the nearest weapon. Kill yourself.”

My blood ran cold hearing the new deviation on the instructions. A scream finished freezing it over at glacial temperatures only seconds later. From near the registers, a woman’s scream, but also… oh fuck. The skittering, click clack sound of the spines moving. Someone fell asleep.

Tattoo was the one. Her head was grotesquely stuck in the rafters of the grocery store, empty eye sockets staring down at us as our problems unfolded below. It was a macabre audience, but the spine bursting forth from her neck began to spew threads almost too thin for the eye to see. Little nerves spread through the air, feeling for anything near that they could latch onto. The spine just kept rising out of her, making me half expect to see her body collapse without it to hold everything to a center. 

The nerves grabbed onto Binoculars and Sarah, bringing the two women in closer as they got hold. Whatever it used to knock them out was effective though, because almost immediately it looked like they fell asleep. Within moments, their heads began to tear off, spines elongating out of the stumps to further stretch their necks until they disconnected with loud pops. The white bone was covered in blood and viscera, with the vertebrae clacking together, appearing as spindly legs as parts of bone stretched and elongated.

The strange man came walking out of the aisles nearby now, hands outstretched in reverence to the three turned women in front of him. He began to walk in closer, uncaring of the nerves reaching through the quickly unraveling spines. Their fibers twisted and fanned out around them, floating ever so close to him without touching as he seemed to dance in between them. 

“Yes, embrace your exhaustion. Delicious.” He said, doing one of the grossest things I’ve ever seen in my life. Just… licking the viscera off the contracting spines as they wriggled, taking in their taste and relishing it. I just… ran. Didn’t stop. I burst through the back door of the market and just kept on running. 

Suddenly I’m on the main street in town, small buildings on every side. It’s deserted, quiet, with nobody else out there but me. The thunder rumbles overhead as more purple and green lightning crack through the clouds. A burst of static comes through the radio in my right hand. I didn’t even realize I had grabbed it… the same warning was playing, now with the ‘Kill Yourself’ addendum running every time. Checking my watch revealed that I had lost another day and a half somewhere along the way. Where, who the fuck knows. I just… arrived here, I guess. Don’t even remember where I was trying to go in the first place.

A strap digs into my nick as I turn around, looking to see if there’s any place to find safety. The shotgun? Holy shit. The shotgun is slung over my back. How did I get it back? Did I… did I make the trip back to my car then come back to the center of town?

That didn’t matter then. I could hear them. Hundreds of them. There was just the skittering sounds of tiny, jagged feet on the pavement all around me. The clickety clack of vertebrae as they smacked and scraped past each other. I could see the nerves flying into the sky above before they all even got here, massive spinal columns extending out of every single body from a bloody stump where the neck should be. 

There was a small flower shop to my right on the road that I tried to duck into, but couldn’t get through the door. Even worse, when I looked at the door to see if I could break the glass, I realized it wasn’t even glass. it was fake, just a picture on a wall showing a shop interior, fake handle sticking out to fool idiots like me looking for safety. 

“Perry! You must be tired!” The strange man was back again, suddenly right in the middle of the crossed roads, looking right at me. His bushy eyebrows were furrowed, a small, buck-toothed smile breaking through his lips. God, why did he seem so familiar but so… terror inducing? Everything about him just looked uncanny, off by the slightest bit. An imperfect impersonation of a human… “Just take a little nap, we’ll make sure nobody bothers you!”

”What in the hell are you, man? What’s going on?” I asked, tears breaking through my voice.

”I was hoping to play with the rest of you more, you know. I mean, I’ve been starved, don’t get me wrong, but I wanted to have fun with all of you!” He was gleeful at this point.

”Didn’t you say your grandpa turned? Was that a lie?” I asked now, trying to stall it while I figured out something. Anything. Behind the dozens of spines that were lined up on each street, blocking the way out, I noticed that same solid backdrop. We were stuck here in the scene of a nightmare, no way in or out. This fucker must be the one causing it…

”Was it a lie? It did happen, just like all nightmares happen. Every little synapse firing in your brain is a very real situation. Just one that only you ever experience. What happened to you in one person’s dream might be different than what really happens to you, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t happen…” 

All the cryptic shit was just making me more frustrated, already irritable from the lack of sleep. The nerves from those damned spines kept inching closer, moving in toward me. There wasn’t any fucking way out of here.

“Attention, Collective personell are on site to assess the situation. If you have found yourself in a class 4 Night Terror, please do not be alarmed. Stay where you are. Find the nearest weapon. Kill yourself.”

The radio cut through, blaring static and that same message. The strange man rolled his eyes, giving a loud groan.

”Ugh, those assholes. Y’know, they’ve kept me locked up for decades now. No wonder I’ve been able to eat so much. It’s been forever since my last good meal…” He began again. I pulled the shotgun off my back, hefting it at my shoulder and aiming at him. He stopped, a look of surprise on his face as he walked closer, examining the shotgun from top to bottom before literally putting his eye to the barrel. ”Bang.”

My finger wasn’t even on the trigger, but it still fired, blowing his brains out right in front of me. The entire top right half of his face was gone, back of the head included, and what was left of his mangled mouth was fucking laughing maniacally.

”You can’t kill me on the home turf, Perry! Come on! Be a good sport!” He shouted as I fell back in fear, tasting the brain matter that had splattered upon the gun going off. It was everywhere, all over me, all over the street, there was too much of it to even make sense of from the wound. Too much for the short time it had been open, and no head would have that many brains in it, right? They began piling on the street, blood pooling and running off into a sewer drain at the corner. Nerves kept coming closer, feeling their way toward me as the strange man laughed once more. 

“If you’re hearing this, please, kill yourself before it’s too late.” The static burst through to another voice, less monotone and more human now. His look went from amused to pissed off. 

“Come on, don’t ruin more of my fun.” He said, laughing once more as he made a finger gun at the radio, going ‘pew’ and blasting it to smithereens. “Those stuffy old fucks don’t know what they’re talking about anyway. Come on, Perry. You’re the last one still here. Last one standing, buddy! You survived this far, what’re you gonna do now?”

The city around me faded away and I was suddenly in the middle of a raucous theme park, people bustling around in every direction. The strange man appeared, wearing mascot ears and eating a comically large cotton candy.

”Gonna go to Disney? Have yourself a magical time?” He said. The scene dropped out as soon as it came in, water now flooding in from every direction, pouring over the edges of some invisible tank to sweep me away. I desperately reached for something to keep my balance before feeling sand under my feet, solid ground once again. He appeared once more, a comical tourist garb and huge camera slung around his neck. He pushed the button on it, causing the flash to blind me, closing my eyes against the madness happening, “Island vacation maybe? Rest and rejuvenate?”

Flames burst to life everywhere, the smell of sulfur stinging at my nostrils. The bright light that blinded me only moments ago was replaced by molten fire billowing from the ground below my feet. The heat was more intense than anything I’d ever felt.

”Or maybe you’ll just let me drag your poor soul down to hell, huh? How about that, Perry!?!?” His laughter echoed in every direction around me, making me want to claw my ears out. My sanity was slipping with every passing second, exhaustion tugging at my last shreds. Meanwhile he fluttered around me like some fucking demon, spewing hate and vitriol at me from every direction.

”No! Stop!” I said, flipping over the shotgun and putting the barrel in my mouth. I could hear him realize what I was doing before I even knew it, but it was too late to stop me. I pulled the trigger, feeling the explosion rip at the back of my throat in excruciating detail, blasting apart my brain from the insides.

I was still alive. Everything hurt like hell. My entire skull felt hot, and my eardrums were definitely ruptured, but I was still alive.

”You idiot!” I could hear him, faintly through the dull throbbing of blood in my ears. I tried to talk back but felt my jaw just… fall. Unsupported by the shredded muscles in my face. Did I fuck up that bad? “You aimed too low! Give me that!”

He went to snatch the shotgun away from me before I could try again but I was dedicated, determined even. I hoisted myself back, tilting my head and holding the shotgun to the roof of my mouth. It probably looked like I was trying to play a damned shotgun saxophone, the way I was moving, but I needed the momentum. Taking a page out of Stake’s book, I threw myself forward, pumping the shotgun as I started moving, and slammed the butt of the weapon into the hard rock at my feet. I felt it fire off one more time, successfully blasting my skull apart into billions of little fragments. He screamed at me as the hell around me faded to black, a sweet abyss of death.

I almost choked sitting up, gasping for air and feeling the cold tile under me as I scrambled to stand and run. Someone pushed me back on the floor, shining a light into my eyes and holding them open.

”Clear, he’s clear!” They shouted. “Get me a stretcher, the last one made it back!”

They were dressed in a nice suit, hair perfectly styled short. I looked up at the ceiling above me as hot bile burned in my throat, threatening to push its way up and out. Another man in a suit ran by, bringing a small medical kit with him. He began checking on me, taking blood pressure, vitals, anything that he could.

”Where the fuck am I?” I asked, choking back the bile. 

“Wally’s Grocer in Hazelwood, Georgia.” The first agent that had shouted told me. “Do you remember what just happened to you, sir?”

”How did I get back here?” I asked, still unsure of if I was going by the weird nightmare logic or actually got here in a real way.

”You’ve been here a few days sir. Tell me, did you see this person during your ordeal?” He held up a rough sketch, showing a man with bushy eyebrows, thick comb over, and buck-toothed smile. The strange man who was pulling all the strings. All I could do was nod, still holding bile back. God, I was starving. A few days? The agent took my confirmation, beginning to talk into a monitor.

”We have confirmation of a Nocturne in the area. Please begin cleanse protocol.” They said, getting an affirmative over the radio. The medical guy started to help me up, guiding me toward the door of the grocery store. We stepped out into bright sunlight, almost blinding me as I tried to adjust to it. When I finally did, the sight that met me was something that made me almost shut back down. 

Body bags lined up down the central street in town. Some fine, others with long, thick spinal cords with vertebrae stretched into small legs curling at the edge, no room to zip the bag around them. 

“Oh my god…” I fainted then and there, losing consciousness again. The next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital room, unsure of what was going on. The people who brought me here have been in and out, asking me every damned question imaginable, crossreferencing others that had talked to me and doing an entire investigation. From what one told me this was a contained event, though most of Hazelwood was… well, dead. Three days in a nightmare and the town collapsed, everyone giving in to their exhaustion while that… thing preyed on them. What a fucking way to go.

I saw Stake walking through the hallway outside my door earlier today. He was carrying a little bundle, talking to it and singing it songs. I noticed on one of his passes that a hand was sticking up from the bundle. Plastic, lifeless, but not to him. The nightmare was only beginning for him.

No matter how much I’ve tried to get sleep since coming here it just doesn’t last long. The night terrors were rough, the spines haunting me through any dream, no matter how good it starts out. They said they’re going to prescribe something for a dreamless sleep tonight. I hope it [works…](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/9YrDcfHGQO)
