My granddaughter recently shared a story about her experience in the Wandering Forest. I owe the truth to her and all of you. Before I begin, please remember.



There’s only one rule when you go to the Wandering Forest.



**ALWAYS TIE A RED RIBBON AROUND YOUR WRIST**



It isn’t there to protect you from the forest, but so the forest knows where you belong.



\---------------------------------------------------



“Uhhh, I can’t wait to get to the Sworn Inn. David’s going to be there tonight. Have you seen how he was looking at me last time? I’m sure tonight he’ll finally ask me to dance.” Marie giggled.



“He’ll have to, or Marie is bye-bye.”



“And what about John?”



“I don’t know. He’s handsome, but it’s like talking to a wall. He barely says more than two words at a time.”



“I’m sure there’ll be a line of men waiting when they see you’re done with John.”



“Stop it, Marie!”



“A line of men, a line of men.” Marie began singing and dancing around.



We were only a few feet from the edge of the Wandering Forest.



“Wait, Marie, do you have your ribbon?”



“Yes, of course I do, Ema. Stop worrying so much.” She lifted her sleeve and danced into the forest.



The sun’s rays were disappearing behind the barren trees. The fallen leaves crunched under our steps.



“I hate when the sun sets so early.”



“Me too. The forest gets weird at night.”



“Maybe one of the boys will let you sleep over,” Marie winked at me.



“You know my Mom would kill me!”



“Who says you have to tell her?”



We began laughing.



The darkness had fully set in by the time we arrived. The light from the Inn was glaring far into the road. The sounds of the music carried even further. When we arrived, the fun was in full swing. People had pushed the tables away and begun dancing in front of the band. Drinks were spilling all over, and the Inn regained its familiar smell of old beer and wet wood. We managed to squeeze through the crowd and place our drink orders. David was sitting at a nearby table, talking to a friend. When he saw us, he stared at Marie for a while, then chugged his drink and slowly got up.



“Oh my god, it’s happening! Can you hold my coat and ribbon? I don’t want to lose it.”



Marie’s face lit up with excitement. She slipped the ribbon from her wrist and pressed it into my hand with her coat. But then David stood up and took his first two steps, stumbled, and had to grab onto a wall. Marie immediately looked back, her lips twisted in a frown, and let out a loud sigh.



“It’s okay, he just needed some courage.”



She opened her mouth to say something, but by that time, David managed to stumble over. He tried to speak, but he only let out a few mumbles. His breath reeked of vodka and beer. Marie looked back, her frown larger than before. I tried to fake a smile and motioned towards him.



“What did you say, David? We can’t hear you.” I yelled at him.



“Ma…Marie…you ehm wanna dance?”



“Yes, she would love to,” I said, and pushed them both on the dance floor. Marie opened her mouth in surprise and shook her head. They started dancing together. I turned around and almost spilled my drink in surprise. John was standing next to me, no more than a few inches away.



“Jesus, John, I almost spilled my drink.”



“Only almost.”



“Yep.”



Music got louder. I was turning my glass around. John kept staring into my eyes.



Next to us, Marie danced with David. She was laughing loudly, holding onto his shoulders, twisting her hips. We walked over to an empty table. Only when the band stopped playing did Marie and David come to our table.



“Oh my god, this is so fun, Ema.”



I looked up at the clock.



“Marie! It’s past 9!”



“What?!”



She looked up at the clock.



“Oh my god, my mom will kill me. We need to go.”



She grabbed her coat, and we stormed out.



Marie started jogging a little. I was trying to keep up with her. It wasn’t more than a few minutes since we entered the Wandering Forest when Marie stopped in her tracks. She turned, her eyes were wide with terror.



“Ema, my ribbon. I left it at the Inn.”



She pulled up her sleeve. There was nothing but skin.



“Marie, no!”



We turned and started running back. The leaves crunched under our steps, but after only a few seconds, Marie disappeared. I turned around, started screaming her name, but my voice echoed through the barren trees. No one was around. The forest was dark and empty. My mind raced. I looked down at my wrist and grabbed the knot of the ribbon. My fingers froze for a second. I pulled hard on the ribbon. The forest around me slowly darkened. My ears started ringing mildly, amping up until the sounds were so loud I had to cover my ears. Then it completely stopped. I slowly opened my eyes. My ribbon was still in my hand. Marie stood beside me. She let out a faint gasp.



“I took mine off, too.”



“Ema, why would you do that?!”



“I couldn’t leave you alone.”



I noticed there were no leaves under my feet, only mud. The end of the forest was in sight a second ago, but the path now ran on in both directions with no end in sight. My heart sank into my chest. A cold breeze blew. The barren twigs sounded in the wind; besides that, the forest was deathly quiet. I frantically looked around. Marie was looking right into my eyes. I tried to flash a smile, but my eyes probably told a different story. I grabbed her hand, and we began making our way back to the Inn.



We walked on for a few minutes. The end was nowhere in sight.



“Ema, shouldn’t we be there already?”



“It will come up soon.”



“Hey, girls,” a voice sounded behind us. Both of us jumped up. Marie tightened her grip.



“Wait, Ema, that’s David!”



Out of the dark came both David and John. I stood back, frozen, my face twisted in bewilderment. What were the two of them doing here? They don’t even talk to each other. I looked over at Marie; she had a smile of relief on her face, but something about this didn’t make sense. They called out to us again. Their voices sounded strange, almost robotic, devoid of emotion. I squeezed my ribbon in my hand harder. My heart began beating quicker. I tried to back off, but Marie stood firm. As they came closer, I could see that they looked different. Their faces were glowing under the moonlight. Their gaze was empty and wrong. They had an unnatural, wide grin as if someone had carved it on their face with a knife. 



“I knew he would come for me.”



Marie let go of my hand and ran towards David. 



“Marie, wait!” But she wasn’t listening. She hugged him tight. He looked up at me and twisted his smile more.



“What are you doing here?” I screamed at them.



“We came to your rescue. We saw Marie had left her ribbon at the Inn.”



“But how did you come from the other way?”



“No, Ema, you just got it confused. Our village is that way.” John pointed behind himself. “That’s why you couldn’t find your way back to it.”



My feet began shaking. I started slowly backing up.



Marie’s face changed. She stared at me in bewilderment. She looked back at David and tried to move away, but he wouldn’t let go. She began pushing away, trying to pry herself out, but his grip was too strong.



“What are you doing, David?!”



“Get her,” David whispered.



John began sprinting toward me. I turned around and tried to run away, but he was too quick. Soon his breath was on my neck and his hands gripped my shoulders. He grabbed me in a bear hug from behind.



“Let me go!” I screamed, but John was silent now, slowly dragging me back to David and Marie. Marie had tears rolling down her cheeks again. She was still trying to twist around, but to no avail. John forced me down onto the ground, holding my head in place. They both looked at each other and smiled. David pushed Marie to the ground. He looked me dead in the eyes and put his hands on Marie’s neck. I couldn’t take it anymore.



“I’m sorry, Marie!”



I took the ribbon and wrapped it around my wrist. I felt it tighten on its own. Closing my eyes, I prayed for this to stop. A wave of dread ran down my body. I was still there. Soon, Marie’s body lay motionless on the ground. David looked our way and smiled.



“It’s her turn now.”



John pushed me to the ground and mounted me too. I didn’t even try to fight it. There was no reason to. His hands were cold and firm. Stars danced in front of my eyes. Then darkness. The ringing again. I slowly opened my eyes. The forest was bright, leaves were under my body, and birds were chirping. Quickly looking around, I was alone, no Marie, John, or David. I made my way to the village, turning around every so often, making sure I was alone.



I immediately told the police officer. They searched for Marie the next two days, but found nothing. David and John were arrested but had a strong alibi; they stayed at the Inn until the early morning hours, talking with their friends. Marie’s body eventually turned up next to the forest path, badly mangled, right where she realized she didn’t have her ribbon. When that happened, the police dropped the search. Everybody knew what had transpired. I fell into a deep sadness for years. Marie's family hasn’t talked to me since the incident. This is the first time I’ve told this story to anyone besides the police officer. I’m still devastated for not telling my granddaughter the truth. Maybe I could have saved her from the horrible things she experienced.
