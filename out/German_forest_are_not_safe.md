 Im writting here to warn people and share whats happening in german forest

Okay my name is sean, at the start of the summer I moved to germany to be with my long-distance girlfriend. So needing money and having no qualifications I wasn't exactly top pick for any jobs.


 Luckaly her nabours worked for the balvairan forst severs and hearing about my unemployment offered me a job as a junior ranger. I jumped at the chance. He told me to meet him at the ranger cabin at 5:00 the the following morning.


I showed up at the cabin at 4:30 the next morning wanting to make a good impression on john, as i really needed this job. Fifteen minutes later john drove up in his dark green jeep. 

" ah hello sean, good to see you. Come in and we will start we have a business day"

" wait i have a job?"

"You are here arnt you? " 

he said with a hit of a smile. I headed in behind him.

"Okay sean down to business you can't speak German so no working at the parking lots or in the tourist booths you will be creating trails, maintains on the cabins and helping with search and rescue"

 I stoped him

"wait You mean people actually go missing out here?"

 John fround

 " from time to time people from the city coming out here thing they can just go for a walk and have some beers without preparing and things go badly, but enough of this talk let get to the rules"

He slide a piece of paper across the table to me.  It was a set of rules writen in german 

"What is this?"

"These are the  rules you must follow to survive this job."

"Emmm john i can't read german. I'll have to take it home to translate it"

"No! The rules must not leave the cabin!" 
John said this with such conviction he was afraid. John collected himself apologise amd explained " i am very sorry for my outburst but these rules are only for rangers inside this park to read no one else can know"

"Okay? Em so how will I learn then?" 

"You will learn as you go so. You seam smart enough"
John got up and started walking to the door "come on then we will start. The first rule you need to know is never leave the trail without me. Do you understand"
I nodded and we started are day.

I spent the rest of my day picking up rubbish and cleaning out bins along the trails with john. I made sure not to leave the trail for any reason and kept john is my site at all times. He didn't ment the rules agen today and I wasn't going to bring them up after eralyer. Things around here feel off but a job is a job i geuss.This is all i have time to write right now i'll update in a few days when I learn more.
