[There's](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hvw5z3/im_performing_an_autopsy_on_a_pregnant_woman_and/) just something about the darkness, that deepens the horror of seeing a fresh print of a child's hand on your window. During the day, it is disturbing. During the night, it makes your stomach turn.

Especially when you live alone. Especially after having done an autopsy on a pregnant woman whose baby was never found. Especially when the print is on the *inside* of the glass. 

I'd seen the print that morning, yet refused to acknowledge it until late at night. I figured I was just tired, or disturbed by the previous events, and my mind was playing tricks on me. However, after getting out of the shower and seeing the fogged up mirror, I gently pressed my hand on it and stared at the print, then compared it to the one in my bedroom.

It was a child's hand. Could it be related to the baby I couldn't find? I know, that seemed ridiculous. And yet... a lot of ridiculous things had happened in the past 24 hours.

One thing was certain. I was not sleeping that night.

I remembered the picture I'd taken of the symbols carved on her ribs, and pulled my phone out. I opened the photo, and there they were. The bone displayed a continuous line of writing, some letters repeating, symbols so intricate, they resembled hieroglyphs. The details were so tiny that it seemed impossible for anyone to carve them there - it looked like the bone had eroded itself to form them. 

I debated using Google reverse image search to match the symbols, since I couldn't identify their language or purpose. However, a more rational approach made me realize that I can't just upload a picture with the insides of a woman onto Google's servers. I decided to trace them on paper and reverse image search *that* picture.

I sat at my kitchen table and tensed up as I copied, as accurately as I could, the strange writing. I had a sense it had something to do with some cult or ritual, but I still wanted to know what I was dealing with. 

The first symbol resembled an open hand, missing it's ring finger. I did my best to draw it, then moved to some sort of swirls around a triangle. By then, I'd only done 2 out of the dozens of symbols, and my hand felt numb. My back was starting to hurt from crouching at the table. I was compelled to finish, so that I could just move on and break the awful silence that had found its rest in my apartment. From my position, I could still see the child's hand print on my window. That had placed an unmovable knot in my stomach.

The third symbol had a... tongue, I think. I wasn't sure. My shoulders were tensed up and my neck felt unbelievably stiff. It was as if someone was pressing onto me. I decided to take a break, and lifted my gaze to my reflection in the window, just in time to see a woman behind me with both of her hands placed on my shoulders, and an unusually long neck, twisted over my head to look at what I was writing.

You like to think you know yourself. You believe you'd react a certain way in a situation, but unless you actually go through it, you can never truly know. There are three types of responses to this absolutely ghastly, disgusting appearance. Fight, flight or freeze.

Apparently, I am the type of person who freezes. 

I looked up and made eye contact with her. Hey eyes were similar to one of those paintings that claims to trap one's soul inside, and her face was unbelievably human and, yet, missing something. She didn't smile, cry, or yell. She just stared at me, then lifted a hand with absolutely no lines or skin folds, a completely smooth hand, and placed one of her completely smooth fingers on the paper. On the symbols.

I think she wanted me to keep writing. By that point, my heart was pounding in my chest, and I felt incredibly light headed. The room began to tremble, then blur, and I think I passed out.

I woke up, and I was alone. I think. I could see, in the hallway, right where the light from the kitchen met the shadows, something like a... standing coat, or, uh, I don't know. My breath still stops when I think about that. It's hard to recall.

I looked back down at the symbols, and decided I would stop searching for this thing alone. My front door was at the end of the hallway, and something tells me that if I'd passed that thing, I would not be alive today.

I did the only logical thing and jumped out the window, then got into my car and called a friend. 

As I was waiting for him to pick up, the woman appeared in my window, and tilted her head. I was shaking so hard, I could barely hold my phone. Then, she disappeared into my home. 

It was her. The woman I'd done the autopsy on. The pregnant woman. She was in my house.

"Yeah? You ok? It's late, man." my friend Tom mumbled on the other side of the line.

"How can I talk to someone who knows cults?"

"What?"

"I did an autopsy on a pregnant woman whose baby is missing, and now she's in my house, and she had these symbols on her, and I don't know..."

"What?"

"Did you hear a thing I fucking said? I'm being fucking haunted. Or hunted. Or both."

I looked up, to see the woman standing in my doorway. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck-

"Wes, are you on acid? Cause, like, you promised me that if you ever tried it we'd do it together..."

I started the engine, and looked up to see the woman standing closer to my car. Her hospital gown was drenched in blood, or mud, or both. She bared all her teeth to me in an exaggeration of a smile, and my hand slipped from the steering wheel from the sweat. *Work, work, work, oh my God... God gracious...*

I yelled all the prayers I knew out loud as I was pulling onto the main street and driving away. I didn't care that the front door to my house had remained practically open. 

I'd forgotten I was still on the phone with Tom. 

"Dude, stop yelling! Are you... praying? What's going on, are you alone?"

"I'm driving to your house. Right now."

"Whoa, wait, don't get in the car if you're on drugs! Wes!"

"I'm not on drugs! I'll explain everything to you, wait for me!" I declared, then hung up, trying to steer the car and stay in my lane.

I think I was crying.

When I got there, he was already waiting for me at the door. I explained everything to him, and he fell silent for a moment, before yelling at me.

"You're a horrible friend. You bring this shit into my house, with the, the symbols and, and the fucking cult, and what were you thinking? *Writing them down?* Were you deliberately trying to summon her or are you just stupid?"

"I'm sorry."

"From what you're telling me, she's part of it, and she wasn't dead when you, uh, opened her up."

"Yeah, I figured that out already."

"Do you have the paper with you? With the symbols?"

"No, damn."

"Great. How about, uh, we just google it?"

"I don't think we'll find anything online. Not on Google, at least."

He gave me a blank look. "No? The dark web, then? Is that why you called me?"

"Uh, yeah. I knew you used to... shop there. When you got pills and stuff."

"Right. So you figured I'd be down to just search some obscure fucking cult."

"Yeah."

Tom sighed. I knew he was mad, but part of him was still curious, and he wouldn't resist it. Soon enough, we were crouched over his laptop.

"I don't even think I know how to go through this anymore. It's been a while."

I watched him turn on his VPN and whatever else, since I'm not good with technology nor can I remember details. He went onto a folder in his computer and loaded a program, then a link... or something like that. I was constantly looking over my shoulder, afraid the woman might have followed us.

"Right. What do I search?"

"Um, can you reverse image search the rib picture?"

"Honestly, I don't really want to. Might find gory stuff."

"Okay. Search, uh, autopsies, stuff like that, cults..."

We unfortunately got jumpscared by some obscure forums, and were beginning to lose hope, until Tom came across some user's story.

"This one says, um... describes symbols such as a flaming triangle, a hand with a missing ring finger, a nail... he says the letters are strangely human, and that his aunt used them when she was part of this society... He claims to be from Alaska."

We began reading through his logs.

*For privacy reasons call me Keith. Yeah, I mean the most batshit insane rituals I've seen, and believe me, I've seen a LOT:)))) are tied to the Moewe Otherhood. That's their english name, but I think their traditional name is Ma'hajrka Reha, or worshippers of the dead mother. They originated from some very avid idolizers of Virgin Mary and developed the ideology that the Antichrist or whatever was gonna be born after the death of the mother. He had to be born in death. From death. It's like, a whole process, spanning over years.* 

Some other user had asked ***so, like, every woman part of the cult wants to birth the antichrist???***

*Oh, no, they do all kinds of satanistic rituals and whatnot. From time to time, more avid followers think that they can achieve eternal life by trying to birth the antichrist, but it's rare and very manic. They get pregnant, then go on this weird diet and perform weird rituals alone, their body goes through those transformations, and eventually they kill themselves and wait to be resuscitated by their sons.*

***lol, does that even happen?***

*Rare as fuck imo. Never heard one case. But yeah, it can happen. It would be tragic tho. I mean, even if their kid would turn out alive, its soul would probably be sold to satan or something, and the mother would turn up some half dead witch*

***that scared the shit out of me lmao. im tempted to write some symbols & check whether this is true or bullshit***

*Don't write anything, don't read anything out loud, don't do any of that! They're clingy as fuuuck, my aunt could not get RID of them.* 

***what if i already did?***

*Just wait it out. It'll pass. They can't hurt you unless you continue to acknowledge them. If they're after you, just give them what they want.* 

I stared at the text, dated over seven years ago.

*They can't hurt you unless you continue to acknowledge them.* 

*They can't hurt you unless you continue to acknowledge them.* 

*They can't hurt you unless you continue to acknowledge them.* 

How much would it count as continued acknowledgement? Did I really have to live my life in danger from now on, petrified to close my eyes? Had I done too much?

Was it too much attention? The autopsy, the pictures, writing the symbols down, searching the web... 

I spent the night at Tom's. I had this semi-dead ex-pregnant woman on my tracks, and something told me she wasn't the only one.

If she'd been so disturbing, I sure as hell did not want to meet her baby.

On another forum, we'd found ways to cleanse the influence of cults over your life. We drenched everything in holy water, put on Gregorian chants and went to various churches in the span of three days. Now, things seemed to go back to normal. At least, in my case.

Tom, on the other hand, texted me last night to tell me that he keeps hearing a baby cry [outside. ](https://www.reddit.com/user/EmmaWatsonButDumber/submitted/?sort=hot)
