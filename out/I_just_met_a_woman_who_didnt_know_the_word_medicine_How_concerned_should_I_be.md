I (23M) live in a mid-sized city in Texas, currently renting an apartment on the edge of what is essentially a defunct industrial district. The city used to have a large manufacturing presence that has since dispersed to other parts of the state. Our local government has been trying to revitalize the area for decades now, but architectural and infrastructural quirks make it hard to entice businesses there. As it stands now, the area is like a ghost town punctuated sparsely by restaurants and long-decommissioned storage tanks. 



Two weeks ago, "Frank's" opened up smack in the middle of the area. In a weird way, despite being the only thing in the vicinity, it was the perfect place for a bar: plentiful parking, no neighbors to disturb with loud music and rowdy patrons, and an easy drive to the building thanks to the grid layout of the streets. According to word of mouth, Frank's also offered extraordinarily cheap alcohol, cheap enough that the homeless guy who hangs out on my corner said he'd already been there multiple times.



A few hours ago, I scoped the place out with my buddy Cam. The bar itself occupies the entirety of a squat, brick building. Interior decoration was pessimistically minimal. A fresh wall had been raised inside, presumably to cordon off the kitchen. With the exception of that wall, the interior still looked just like a warehouse with its concrete flooring and towering, exposed ceiling. At least the new owners had turned off the industrial lights in favor of scattered, ambient lighting throughout the bar, although doing so made it difficult to see. The low amber lighting, combined with the loud music and the density of the crowd, made Frank's feel far more like a club than a bar. 



Anyway, the ambiance wasn't much, but the drinks were good and, yes, cheap. The bartender that served us was a beautiful woman with a good sense of humor, so that sure didn't hurt either. Despite the throng of customers, she seemed to be hitting it off pretty well with Cam. She circled back often to check on us, and if I didn't know better, I'd say she was genuinely interested in my friend. 



Disarmed by our bartender, "Caroline", I spent a good two hours at the counter before I had to get up to take a piss. The bathroom was small and packed, enough for there to be a line. As I waited, it occurred to me that the whole bar was much smaller than it seemed from the outside. The front of the house, the bathrooms, and the hallway separating them seemed to occupy only half the square footage of the building. I doubted the kitchen was very large given the kind of food being served, and I couldn't imagine alcohol storage rooms taking up half of an old warehouse. Maybe Rick's wasn't the only business in the building, as I had first assumed. I was too buzzed to ruminate on the building's layout for long, and by the time my turn came, I'd forgotten about it altogether. 



On my way back to the counter, I ran into a woman carrying a (thankfully) empty cocktail tray. Although I didn't think we had collided very hard, the impact made her lose her balance and stagger backwards a bit. I reached out, grabbed her arms, and managed to prevent her from toppling over, apologizing profusely all the while. Luckily, she seemed fine. She smiled and waved her free hand as I let go, dismissing my apologies. As she did this, I noticed that she wore a pair of thin, black gloves. I inclined my head towards them. 



"Your hands cold?" I asked, though my question failed to rise above the din and I had to try again, practically shouting in the poor girl's face. 



"They're part of my uniform." 



"Oh, you work here?"



"Yep."



"You must be Frank!"



Yeah, yeah–not my best work, but it got a polite laugh out of the woman if nothing else. She introduced herself as Layla, then asked me a few basic questions (are you from around here, how's your night going, etc.). I expected her to leave it at that and go back to work, but instead, she continued the conversation, tucking the tray under her arm and giving me her full attention. I was flattered, albeit a bit confused, and after a few minutes, she pulled me off to a corner where the noise level was slightly better. 



She was a beautiful girl, Layla. Kinda had the look of a young Vivica Fox. I tried to learn more about her, asking her questions about herself and how she came to work at Frank's, but she seemed far more interested in me than talking about herself. As we conversed, she would frequently look down at the floor, staring intently at the concrete for a few seconds before looking back up at me. After hitting it off for a while, I said something about the bar's terrible acoustics giving me a headache.



"You know," she said in response, looking me up and down suggestively. "We actually have a private room, kind of like a lounge. Very quiet. Usually you have to pay for it, but I could take you down there if you need to *lie down.*"



So there *was* more to the building. I wondered how large the lounge was.



"Will you be there to keep me company?" 



"I could spare a few minutes." 



I don't remember exactly what I said next, but it was something to the effect of "that's just the kind of medicine I need." I can't remember the exact wording, but I know that I mentioned the word "medicine", and that Layla immediately started shaking her head. 



"No, no, it's not a sin." 



"*Medicine*," I corrected, figuring she'd misheard me.



"Medin … med …"



For a second, I swear her expression changed entirely. She looked more scared than confused, tucking her chin into her chest and looking down at the floor like a guilty dog. Then, as if nothing had happened, she looked back up at me and smiled like nothing unusual had just occurred. 



"Just messing with you." She wrapped a gloved hand around my bicep. "So how 'bout that lounge?"



Even though I was a little buzzed, I remember thinking that the joke didn't make any sense. I forced a laugh, saying that she'd gotten me good. She laughed along, saying something like, "yeah, it would be hard to get through life without knowing that!" And again, her phrasing was so strange that I just straight up asked her:



"What's medicine?" 



"What do you mean?" 



"I mean you don't seem to know what I'm talking about and it's really bizarre. Can you describe it for me?" 



When she didn't answer me right away, I pulled my arm out of her grip. I didn't understand the bit whatsoever, and her abrupt change in demeanor had really freaked me out. I stepped back, and she looked at the ground so intently it was like she expected to see the answer written out on the floor. After a few more seconds, she looked up again, and the fear had completely dissipated from her expression, replaced instead with annoyance and what I thought was a touch of disappointment. 



"Jeez, I didn't think you'd get so hung up on that. I just forget things sometimes, alright? But I remember now. Medicine is stuff for treating or preventing illnesses. Creams, pills, patches, injections, all that shit." We looked at each other for a minute, and when I didn't laugh off our weird little exchange, she sighed and rolled her eyes. "Seems like you've recovered. I'm gonna get back to work."



She turned to leave. I asked if she was alright, but she didn't acknowledge the question. I even tried to follow her, but the crowd swallowed her up and I lost sight of her quickly. The minute I couldn't see her anymore, I felt a sharp stab of dread. The bar felt more claustrophobic than ever, and I got the sense that something bad would happen if I didn't get out of there quickly. 



I pushed my way through the swarm of people, back to the counter where Cam was still blissfully chatting away with the bartender. As I walked, a few people turned their heads to look at me. These were not quick, up-down-and-away looks, but very pointed stares. I wondered if they were other employees giving me the evil-eye after a perceived slight against their friend. I got back to Cam, convinced him (with GREAT difficulty) to stop talking to Caroline, and then the two of us headed towards the exit. All the while, those people never took their eyes off of me. 



Cam's always been a talkative drunk, which I didn't mind. His yapfest on the drive home was so droning that it was easy to tune out, giving me the chance to think about my encounter. 



There was a good chance that I was blowing things out of proportion, but I'm a cautious guy. I grew up in a poor, violent city, and I learned young that victims of abuse rarely look the stereotypical part. When it comes to human trafficking in particular, people think of victims getting snatched up by some shadowy organization and kept in chains for the rest of their lives. In actuality, perpetrators are often family members, and the chains are more likely to be coercion or financial abuse than iron. Could Layla be wrapped up in some kind of sex trafficking scheme? Could that be why she seemed so adamant on taking me to the lounge? 



I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking things. After all, on paper, all that happened is that some girl had a temporary lapse of memory, from which she quickly recovered, and then we parted ways. I can't imagine how nuts I'd sound if I tried to tip off the cops for "human trafficking" while my only evidence was a server behaving a little strangely. 



I tuned back into Cam's babbling to hear him talking about Caroline the bartender. He was excited by the fact that Caroline was "just his type", which apparently was "tall and blonde and a little stupid."



"Stupid?" I remember interjecting. I'm not sure why I bothered asking for clarification, but Carolien had seemed pretty damn witty from our conversation. I wondered if I'd missed something while talking to Layla. 



"Yeah, man. She didn' know what 'medicine' was." 



My jaw damn near dropped.



"Huh?"



"We were talkin' and then out of nowhere, she's like, askin' me to define 'medicine.'"



"Did you explain it to her?" 



"Well yeah, I wanted to help out. I told her n' then she just moved on. Fuckin' weird, yeah?" 



"When was this?" 



He couldn't remember exactly, but I suspected it was around the same time I had a very similar conversation with Layla. I dropped Cam off at his place, returned to my own apartment, and immediately sat down to type all of this up. I'm thoroughly weirded out, and even now, in the safety of my own home, I can still feel all those eyes burrowing into my back and I hurried out of the building. 

There's something going on at Frank's, and despite the strangeness of the situation, I want to learn more. I want to return and see if I can suss out some more information about the management behind the bar, and maybe even get a glimpse of this enigmatic lounge for myself. And more than anything else, I want to make sure that Layla is ok. After all, despite what she said, there was not a single other person in that building who was wearing gloves.
