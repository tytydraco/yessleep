My daughter had talked about the haunted forest in Fall River for weeks, telling me how much she wanted to investigate the area. I didn’t pay her much heed. She was at that age when being in a cemetery was creepy fun and playing with a Ouija board seemed harmless party entertainment. Halloween was about scaring the crap out of yourself and the paranormal was something that needed to be explored with wild, feckless abandon, regardless of any potential danger.

After weeks of discussion, she informed me she was going there by herself the following weekend. Curiosity got the best of me and I did a little internet research. Being her father, I wanted to see how deep was the water my fearless daughter was wading. After a half hour of research, I learned about UFO sightings witchcraft, human sacrifice, poltergeists and supernatural creatures called ‘Pukwudgies’. The area was 5000 acres of literal haunted forest, a part of the ‘Massachusetts Dark Bridgewater Triangle’. Part of me chuckled and snorted over the internet hype, but the paternal instinct inside said I needed to be there with my daughter just in case.

That weekend, armed with MapQuest directions and a false sense of security, we began our journey. We parked in the large parking lot, the only car there. I read an inscription on a large statue that detailed some of the more colorful events of the forest’s rich, dark history. We both had cameras; my daughter hoping to catch a paranormal specter, me hoping to catch some decent wildlife pictures. Before we headed into the main trail by a large yellow gate, I set my cellphones compass and GPS navigator.  My daughter had already headed toward the trail head forcing me into a jog to catch up. I slipped the phone in my jeans pocket as we proceeded down a large clear trail.

“This doesn’t seem so scary.” My daughter snorted clearly not impressed

“Don’t believe all the hype.” I replied feeling slightly uneasy.

The trail took a hard turn and stopped. A wall of woodlands lay before us, to our right a thin path led into a thick pine grove. “This way.” I motioned my daughter taking the lead. I paused for moment deciding to set a GPS marker on my phone. I slipped the phone out and discovered there was no signal here. GPS and my compass app were useless. My daughter checked her cellphone with the same uncomfortable observation. “We stick to the main trails.” My daughter nodded as we moved with a bit less carefree abandon. The thin trail spilled into a path a foot and a half wide covered with half buried stones and pine roots. I walked over to a deadfall and dragged it fifteen or so feet, laying it halfway on the path so we wouldn’t miss the connection on our way back. I dragged the heel of my boot, creating a fifteen-foot arrow on the trial leading to the treefall. There was no way we could miss either marker. My daughter mocked my paranoia as we headed down the path deeper into the forest.

We talked in quiet whispers for several minutes. My daughter constantly looked through her camera lens testing the light for pictures. Something was wrong. I couldn’t put the feeling into words. The back of my head tingled as the realization struck me. Where were the birds? It was a warm early Autumn day; the trees should be full of activity. Where were the squirrels and chipmunks? The woods were rich with white oaks. The sound of calling chipmunks prevalent in every forest was missing. The birds were missing and the annoying buzz of horseflies and gnats didn’t exist here. I walked off the path and turned over a large rock. Nothing! No worms, centipedes or any other type of insect scurried away. This forest was barren save for the vegetation. We stood, alarmed, in the eerie silence.

“What do we do?” there was a slight warble in my daughter’s voice. That first hint of panic.

“We can turn around.” I suggested.

“We’ve barely been here a half hour.” She walked forward heading deeper into the woods, looking back to make sure I followed.

I followed in silence for fifteen more minutes. The pathway emptied into a thirty-foot opening with large rock formations. To continue we’d need to do a bit of climbing over the large obstacles. The climb wasn’t too bad and the narrow path continued. We walked in silence through a swamp area littered with dead trees. I stopped, my eyes locked on the pond and the lily pads. I heard my daughter’s footsteps as she came up beside me.

“What?” her voice had a larger hint of fear than before.

I pointed at the water. “No pond skates on the surface, no dragon flies chasing mosquitos. There’s nothing… not even a frog or freaking turtle. This whole place is dead! It’s not natural and it makes no sense.” My voice was more frustrated than fearful. I was not gonna show fear in front of her. “Have you seen anything alive out here in the past forty-five minutes?”

Her head shook ‘No.’

I pulled out my cellphone… still no bars. “We’re not in a land bowl.” My hands swung to the open blue skies “We’re wide open. There’s no magnetic interference in these woods; we should be getting a cell signal.”

My daughter checked her phone…hers was as useless as mine. “The map I read at home said this trail circles around the pond and comes back. Let’s just follow it and get out of here.” My daughter looked up at me, I could see fear in those almond hazel eyes.

We walked side by side along the path for ten more minutes, we cleared the pond, but I didn’t get the sense of us circling back. The position of the sun hadn’t changed, it was still behind my right shoulder. We were still going in a relatively straight line, deeper into the forest. I was reluctant to vocalize my observation… my daughter was already concerned, I wasn’t gonna add to it. A sense of dread crawled up my spine exploding in a mad tingle at the base of my skull. Something was behind us. I turned slowly, preparing to see a stranger or an animal. It wasn’t a person or any kind of animal. The air above the path twenty feet behind us flickered, flowing like waves of ambient heat over desert sand. Something inside the waves of heat moved. I put my hand on my daughter’s shoulder and pushed her forward. “C’mon, let’s go.”  Her head turned back, I waited for a scream or some kind of panicked outburst. Nothing

“What’s wrong, Dad?”

I felt my head shake and forced the battle-ready tenseness from my body. “Nuthin. Let’s just keep going. Maybe the trail circles back further ahead.” I dared to look back. The anomaly was there, blocking our retreat, but my daughter didn’t see it. We moved quickly, following the path. Pushing deep into a section of forest thick with oaks, maple and other hardwood trees. The colorful canopy of autumn leaves covered the trail, effectively choking out the afternoon sunlight. Wind whistled through the trees angrily rustling the leaves around us. The breeze was ice cold, sending a deep chill down my spine. My daughter was visibly trembling.

“That wind is freezing!” she shuddered rubbing her arms briskly.

I ignored the chill and guided her forward along the path. The trail led to another opening. My stomach turned and my daughter gasped in shock. The opening was identical to the area we were at thirty minutes ago. The rocks were identical, the overgrown weeds and brush were a perfect match to the rocks we’d climbed before.

“How did we get back here?” her question followed a blistering string of curses.

“It can’t be the same outcropping.” I did my best to stay calm. “We haven’t turned around. We’ve been walking south by southwest with some small deviations; it can’t be the same place.” I approached the two larger rocks, even the hand and footholds seemed identical. “Stay here, I’m going to climb up and see if the path is similar.” Two quick pulls and I was over the rock and staring into another distortion, only this one was larger, easily a dozen feet wide, covering a large portion of the clearing and blocking the path beyond. The air shimmered like heatwaves rising off hot sands or summer pavement. I was close enough to feel any radiant heat but there was none. Fear; naked, primal and unfiltered savaged my body. I stood, eyes locked on the hypnotic distortion, straining my eyes to unsee the illusion nature placed before me. Within the ripples, something moved. My hands clenched; feet spread apart ready for a fight or flight response. I spotted a baseball sized rock, picked it up testing its weight tossing the object between both hands. The shimmer moved closer, inching forward, a tiger creeping up slowly on the unsuspecting gazelle or impala, waiting for the chance to pounce. Panic! I hurled the stone missile with every fiber of strength I could muster. The rock passed through the barrier with no effect. I listened; the stone never struck the trees behind it. I turned and leapt the seven feet or so rolling to absorb some of the impact as my legs hit the ground. My daughters scream of surprise echoed, shattering the silent woods.

I stood, brushing myself off, forcing her behind me, my eyes locked on the large boulders, hands raised, my breath hissing through clenched teeth. My daughter screamed demanding to know what was going on. Her eyes fell upon the boulders, face pale as her jaw dropped. The rippling portal stopped at the rocks edge. We gazed, dumbfounded, at the anomaly. Before I could say or do anything the ribbons of distortion vanished. My daughter’s eyes were locked on the area the distortion occupied just seconds ago. I could see the trembling in her arms and shoulders.

“What the hell was that?” her panicked whisper accompanied a river of tears flowing down her pale cheek.

“I don’t know.” I put my hand on her trembling shoulder. “We need to go back the way we came. We’ll backtrack and get the hell out of here.” She nodded. I silently prayed whatever that thing was… it just wanted us out of the area. If this ‘thing’ wanted us gone, I’d gladly oblige. We passed by the pond without incident making our way at a feverish pace, stumbling along the path. My daughter exhaled a sigh of relief as the path emptied into the first rock clearing. We quickly climbed down the large boulders and continued on, both feeling a bit better having seen a familiar landmark. We walked in silence for another half hour before I noticed. The trees were wrong! We should be in the pine thickets by now, walking a rutty root littered path dotted with stones. We were walking toward the sun, the right general direction but the path was wider and smooth, made of compacted dirt. I stopped; my daughter nearly plowed into me.

“Now what?” She asked warily.

“The trees are wrong. We were walking in an evergreen forest full of pines, cedars and some other cypress before the first clearing. We passed the first boulders we climbed a good while ago.” I pointed up to the tree canopy. “These are oaks, maples and other leaf bearing trees.”

“Are you saying we’re lost?” her voice was near the breaking point of full-on panic. “How can we be lost?”

“I don’t know.  We’re going in the right direction but these aren’t the woods we walked through earlier. Just stay close to me.”

“Dad? How can that be? We never left the path we just followed it back? I didn’t see a second pathway, did you?”

I shook my head ‘No’. I wished I had an answer for my daughter. I was just as confused and turned around as a newbie cub scout on his first nature hike. Thirty plus years in the woods and I was beside myself. I didn’t have any answers and that, above all else, scared me. I couldn’t show fear in front of her. She was looking to me for strength and calm. I didn’t have the luxury of falling apart or appearing less than in control. I pointed further down the path. “Let’s go for another ten minutes on this path. If we don’t see anything familiar, we’ll try something else.”

“Because just walking has worked so well, so far.” She grumbled and walked ahead of me.

I couldn’t think. My mind raced trying to find some rational explanation for what we both saw and why the forest seemed to change at random. My daughter was far ahead of me, moving at a fast clip. “Wait.” I called out. She kept going forward. The path ahead changed direction, twisting ninety degrees left, back into the forest. I ran screaming her name, telling her to stop. Barely twenty feet in front of my daughter the distortion materialized from nothingness. Something was inside the ripples; a misshapen hand motioned my daughter forward and she kept walking toward oblivion. I screamed her name again, desperately grabbing her shoulder, barely six feet from the phenomenon. A mad cackle of frustration shattered the woodland silence. An ice-cold wind slammed into me like a freight train numbing my arms and chest. “She’s mine! She’s mine! Give her to me!” An angry voice shrieked as I yanked my daughter away and off the trail. Some force slammed into my back pushing me forward, forcing the breath out of my lungs.  I fell on top of my daughter, shielding her with my body. She was shivering and weeping. The frozen gale continued to slam against me, pushing me harder into the earth. My arms strained against what seemed like hundreds of pounds threatening to crush me with an oppressive force. Twigs and forest debris flew overhead as that banshee wail of anger and longing cried out, *She’s mine*. I wrapped myself tighter around my daughter, shielding her as best I could. We lay motionless for several seconds enduring the frozen wind, crushing force and the shower of forest debris. I focused my thoughts, prayed silently then shouted at the top of my lungs. “NO!” One single word infused with all the love, protection and mortal rage I could muster.

The icy gale subsided. I took a few seconds to gather my wits. My daughter was shaking, engulfed by abject terror.  “It’s okay. I got you.” I repeated that mantra at least a dozen times, more to convince myself than her. I stood, my back aching and arms scraped from the flying debris. My daughter got to her feet, she stumbled once and fell into me, crying. I kept repeating my mantra holding on to her, offering what little protection my arms could provide against something clearly not of the natural plain. A low thrumming hum echoed through the woods. I dared to look back. The distortion was still there! I strained to peer through the ripples to see what figure hid behind the curtain. I could only see a vague outline. I turned toward it again, eyes narrowed, paternal will focused. Anger replaced fear. “NO!” I shouted like I was addressing a misbehaved puppy.

I guided my daughter back on the path away from the distortion, peering back every few steps to assure it wasn’t following, stalking me, like it had before. Realization hit me. The trees surrounding us were evergreen! We were in the pine forest. The path was littered with stones and exposed pine roots. How the hell did that happen? Just minutes ago, we were under a thick oak canopy! This was impossible! A welcome development but still impossible. As we walked back, I scanned the ground for my heel marks and the dead treefall I dragged on to the path. It was as if the forest erased my trail markers.  I kept walking straight into the woods following the sunlight filtered through the pine needles. I kept my eyes forward, forcing myself to look straight ahead and not be distracted. *Follow the Sun.* I kept whispering in my head. *That’s the way out of here.* My daughter held my hand tightly as we forced our way through several thickets of saplings. We made our way out of the woods and were back on the large wide path. I looked over to see the bright yellow gate to the forest parking lot. I pointed it out to my daughter and she signed in relief. We practically ran the fifty yards. Once we crossed the gates threshold my cellphone began to buzz and beep. A hundred pounds of dread fell off my shoulders. A chipmunk scurried across the parking lot, and a large crow flew overhead. This was the first wildlife I’d seen all day. We were out of it, safe; but safe from what? My mind struggled to rationalize the experience. My mind failed, miserably.

“Daddy!” my daughter whispered pointing down towards the wide path.

An old woman stood on the edge of the woods; arms crossed. I could feel the weight of her stare. The rippled anomaly was directly behind her. The ‘Fuck you, bitch’ flowed, unfiltered from my mouth. I felt that false sense of bravado now that we were out of that cursed territory.

“She’s lonely.” My daughter’s voice was tinged with sadness and a strange longing. “She’s so lonely, Dad.”

“How do you know?” I demanded.

“I can hear her talking. Can’t you?”

My skin crawled, we weren’t beyond this thing’s influence, at least my daughter wasn’t. “No.  I’m sorry she’s lonely, but she wanted to take you. Didn’t you hear me yelling at you back there?”

She shook her head. “No. I just felt the urge to keep walking. I didn’t see the ripples until you grabbed me.” Her face paled. “I would have walked right through it if you hadn’t…”

I patted her shoulder, “Don’t think about it.”

We both looked back at the old woman. My daughter shouted, “I’m sorry you’re lonely but I can’t go with you. I hope you’ll be okay.” Only my daughter could switch from fear to compassion and empathy within a heartbeat. Maybe that was what drew this thing to her, that rare gift of youthful compassion, unburdened by the sour pessimism of adulthood.

The old woman raised a wrinkled hand and waved; my daughter waved back. The woman turned walking into the rippled anomaly and vanished. The distortion winked out of existence.

I hugged her one more time. “Let’s go home.”

I sat in the living room later that evening, listening to my daughter recount the tale to her mother and brother for at least the fifteenth time. My wife stared at me in disbelief and I simply nodded once. My son just kept saying how he wished he was there. I laughed a bit inside… *He’d wet himself.* My son asked me later what I thought we’d encountered. I’d wasted an entire evening of mental energy trying to figure it out.

“Son. Near as I can figure it was some kind of portal.”

“To where?” he wondered.

I scratched my cheek. “To whatever eternal realm that old woman has been condemned to spend eternity.” That was the best my 21^(st) century, sophisticated mind could come up with. “She wanted to take your sister there for an eternal visit, near as I can figure.”

My son snickered. “Pfffft that old lady would toss her ass back here after a week of her bitching and moaning.”

I didn’t mean to laugh… but my daughter could probably drive a ghost crazy. At least I ended the day on a lighter note.
