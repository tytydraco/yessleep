Part 1.  


I always assumed I’d be the one to exit stage left first—dramatic, tragic, a martyr to my own brilliance. Mia, my sainted sister, was supposed to outlive me. She was the golden girl: crisp planners, color-coded notes, a life so orderly it could’ve been shrink-wrapped.

I’m the chaos agent—a paralegal with a flickering fridge light, a knack for dating human garbage, and a bill collector’s number on speed dial. I’m like a shark. If I’m not in seventeen simultaneous feuds, I die. Yet three months ago, I stood in Meadowbrook Cemetery, watching them bury her perfection six feet under. Twenty-two stab wounds, neatly concealed by a closed casket.

Her ex, Ryan, swaggered out of custody two weeks ago. Evidence “mishandled.” A chain of custody fumbled by some doughy cop with sweaty palms. A judge—probably golfing buddies with Ryan’s dad—couldn’t stomach the gore long enough to convict. Men, shielding their own with a wink and a handshake. It's almost admirable how predictable they are.

Going to jail isn't about breaking the law. It is about pissing off someone who has more power than you. It has always been true, and it will always be true. Power needs to be checked, but that will likely never fully happen. Ryan's father had connections. Money. A golf membership at the same country club as half the courthouse. I had nothing but rage and a paralegal's salary. In the equation of justice, I didn't even register as a variable.

Now I’m drowning in Mia’s relics—cardboard boxes labeled in her infuriatingly flawless script. My apartment reeks of her lavender shampoo, a ghost I can’t scrub out. I clutch a framed photo from some beach trip, her smile tight, a sickly yellow bruise blooming on her cheekbone. I’d prodded her about it once. She’d deflected with a laugh and a wave, like I was the idiot for noticing. Classic Mia—polish over the cracks.

Some nights, staring at the empty side of the couch, I'd think all I've ever wanted was the nighttime routine of a couple in a movie. Lathering a fuckton of lotion on my legs while my husband does whatever the fuck on his laptop. Such a simple thing. Mia wanted it too. Neither of us got it. She chose Ryan instead, who gave her bruises, not movie nights. I chose no one, which somehow felt worse.

Greg, my boss, cut me loose yesterday. “Grief’s not a good look for filing motions,” he said, his tie a garish plaid that screamed midlife crisis. “Take some time,” he added, as if mourning’s a yoga retreat with cucumber water and a gift shop. I didn’t even argue. Sleep’s a stranger now anyway—I lie awake, scrolling Mia’s old texts, letting the rage simmer until it’s thick enough to choke on.

The neighbor who cranked his TV over her screams. The detective who lingered on her skirt length like it was a clue. The system that shrugged and let her killer walk. It’s a chorus of failures, and I’m the only one still listening.

Good girls don’t plot revenge. 

But I was never cast for that role.

I remembered reading Sylvia Plath in college, how she once wrote: "Please don't expect me to always be good and kind and loving. There are times when I will be cold and thoughtless and hard to understand." The words had seemed distant then, dramatic even. Now, they felt like a confession I could have written myself.

I hadn’t graced a club since Mia’s curtain fell, but last night, Jess from HR—perky, clueless Jess—dragged me to some pulsating dive in the Meatpacking District. “You need to live a little,” she chirped, as if strobe lights and watered-down vodka could stitch up the gaping wound Mia left behind. Five tequila shots later, the bass was a drill in my skull. I shoved through the sweaty herd and stumbled outside, the air slapping me awake.

My stomach rebelled. I lurched into an alley, painting the bricks with last night’s regrets. Mia would’ve held my hair back, cooing something soothing. 

**But Mia’s not here.** 

As I steadied myself, wiping my mouth, I spotted it—a sticker on the dumpster, cheap and peeling. A QR code, paired with blood-red letters: “REVENGE GUARANTEED. BURN THEM ALIVE.” 

Tacky, yet intriguing.

Tequila’s a hell of a wingman—it makes lunacy feel logical. Rage? That’s the real puppet master. I scanned the code, my phone buzzing as it redirected to an app download. No developer, no reviews—just a black flame icon. I hit “Install,” a reckless little thrill coursing through me, then forgot it entirely as I Ubered home and collapsed, one shoe still dangling off my foot.

Morning crashed in like a hangover’s revenge. 11:47 AM. Three missed calls from Jess, probably fretting I’d offed myself in a ditch. And then—a notification from nowhere: “The Black Candle awaits. Your revenge is ready to be lit.”

I tapped it, expecting a pop-up ad for diet pills or a phishing scam. Instead, my screen went dark. A lone candle flickered to life, unlit, suspended in a void. Below it, a text box and a button: “Light it.” Fine print whispered, “Each flame claims a soul. Your debt grows.” Deliciously ominous.

I stared, exhaustion and grief wrapping me like a shroud. Three months of sleepless nights, Mia’s ghost in every shadow, Ryan out there breathing air he doesn’t deserve. My fingers danced across the screen, stabbing out his name: “Ryan Kessler.” It glowed in the box, a taunt. One tap to light the candle. One tap to—what? Incinerate him? Absurd. And yet, my finger lingered, trembling with possibility.

“For Mia,” I murmured, and pressed it.

The candle blazed—too vivid, too wild. The flame twisted like a living thing, devouring Ryan’s name with grotesque glee. A sound screeched through the room—static laced with something feral. Screams, maybe. My phone seared my hand, a branding iron against my skin. I dropped it, vertigo slamming me as the room spun. Next door, my neighbor barked at her yapping Pomeranian—“I am not fucking doing this with you right now”—and I almost smirked.

The last thing I saw was that flame, writhing on my screen like it knew me.

I dreamed of fire. A car choking on smoke. Ryan’s face melting as flames clawed up his body, his screams a symphony I didn’t know I needed.

When I woke, the hangover had dulled to a hum. The app? Vanished. No “Black Candle” in my download history, no trace on my phone. I scrolled, half-convinced it was a tequila-fueled fever dream.

But the air felt different—sharper, charged. I’d written the script, lit the match. And somewhere out there, I knew Ryan was burning.

Then the news alert slithered onto my screen, a little gift wrapped in pixels: “Local Man Dies in Car Fire.”
