My name is Lee. I'm 19 years old, and still live with my parents. If you know me, you'll know two things about me. I hate my current living conditions, and I'm an avid Sega nerd. I would beg my parents to buy the new sonic game the moment it came out. which, much to my parents dismay, I wouldn't stop talking about until they took me to my local GameStop to buy it. 

Nowadays, I'm more of a casual Sega Otaku. I'll only buy the games if they're any good to the community. Recently I found my dad's old Sega CD. He meant to give it to me as inherentence when I turned 18, but he forgot about it. He figured instead of letting it rot in the basement, he'd give it to me. He didn't care if I sold it mind you, he just wanted to get rid of it. I decided to keep it. I'm bound to have some old Sega CD games I pawned from people somewhere. But much to my dismay, I couldn't find a single one. So, I turned to the internet. I typed "Sega CD Games" into the search bar of Ebay and after a few minutes, I found a listing for a beta copy of Sonic CD

. I was more confused then interested. I didn't know there were even beta copies of Sonic CD at all. After some fruitless research, I placed a low bidding at $20. I figured since no one put a bid on it, I would attempt to outbid whoever put up a higher price. Oddly enough, it was accepted right away. I was even more confused now. But, I pushed aside my concern, and waited for my order to be shipped to me. While I waited, I looked around my room a few more times throughout the week, and found a few Sega CD games. Namely Earthworm Jim, Corpse Killer, and some piece of shit called Sewer Shark. 

At the end of the week, my package came. It was in a manila envelope which was odd, but in my county they mostly put small things in envelopes rather than small packages. I opened the envelope and took my prize. It was a heavily scratched disk with the words "Needle Rodent" written in sharpie. Under the highly crude nickname for sonic was a badly drawn eye. It was more cartoony than scary, and it had a small X in the middle in replace of the pupil.  I stared at the disk for a solid minute. When I looked down, a piece of paper was faced upside down next to my feet. "Must've fell out." I thought to myself. I picked up the paper and read the note to myself. 

"Dearest Viewer, this game is not how it seems. It is one of the last remaining copies of a virus that could put us back into the stone age if unleashed upon the world.  destroy the disk. End for us what we should've done long ago."

What I read just made me an anxiety ridden mess.  I couldn't think, my mind was foggy, and I felt like I was going to pass out over the dizziness I felt. After a couple hours, I came to. I seemed to have passed out on the couch. I chocked the note as a hallucination, as the note was nowhere to be found after looking for a solid five minutes, and started up the CD. Only to be met with a blank screen. I started to doubt that this game was even for the CD, but a few seconds later, it sparked to life, with the classic SEGA jingle. The title screen blared to life, and Sonic greeted me with a winning smile, and his signature finger wag. I was indifferent at this point, and pressed the start button. A pop-up appeared soon after it read: 

"This disc is for use by only SEGA employees for testing of The Limbo Project. If you are unauthorized or have received this disc by mistake, Please remove this disc and alert your supervisor."

What the fuck did I just read? I was a bit disturbed by this unknown project that supposedly not even  other employees should know about. But I carried on. I would be lying if I wasn't the least bit interested. Suprisingly, it went straight to the first level. Palmtree Panic was different to say the least. Not only was the layout extremely off, but I was playing as a character who didn't get the player role until very recently. Amy Rose. I was slightly surprised when I saw that I would be playing as Sonic self proclaimed girlfriend, but I didn't mind. After going through about half the level, I ran into another character. Sonic stood still, almost unmoving as Amy stepped forward. It played an animation which I assumed was Amy getting sonic's attention. Sonic turned around with a panicked expression on his face and spoke.

"Rosie? Get out of here! There's a monster taking innocent animals killing them for sport! And-"

Amy took a step back and looked sonic up and down.

"You... never call me that. Who are you? What did you do with Sonic?!" 

Sonic stepped back, but hung his head down in response.

"Guess that didn't work... huh?"

Sonic ripped off his face, only to reveal some sort of mask underneath. It looked like a middle aged male with highly defined features. "I've seen this somewhere before... it was that weird Majin Sonic thing from the sound test!" I thought to myself. The creature then spoke up.

 "I guess I can't keep up this facade for much longer. I have a proposal for you young lady."

Amy balled her fist and yelled at Sonic.

"Nothing you say is going to get me to side with you, Crook."

The two seem to have a history. Sonic then quickly retorted.

"Oh but it will. And besides, your friends are having so much fun. They're dying for you to join!"

Sonic then stepped aside to let Tails and Knuckles into view. Both wearing similar masks to  Sonic's. Amy was shaking with anger at this point.

"WHAT DID YOU DO TO THEM?!"

Sonic flinched slightly, the mask moving like his eyes should've.

"They're only enjoying a utopia, one of which I will build, with your help of course."

Amy was creeped out by the sudden retort, but questioned the imposter anyways.

"What do you mean Utopia?"

Sonic laughed, and responded with a glowing smile.

"Why you see young lady, I will make this land anew, make a peaceful utopia while burying the old one in the rubble. With your strength, Tails' intelect, and... Knuckles, I'll build a land of new hope while we reign as kings and queens in a land of our making. I only need you to put on this mask."

A Pastel pink mask with a beautiful woman's face was held in front of Amy. Inticing her to come closer. Amy was supposedly mind controlled by the mask, and put it on without a second thought. Soon, she felt a ripping and tearing at her face. Amy didn't scream at all. She only clawed at the mask until her body went limp. After a few seconds, she stood back up, and did something I didn't even comprehend until after because of all the panic. She looked at me. The others looked shortly after. Leaving me with chills down my spine. The thing that happened afterwards is the reason I'm writing this. The four masked husks muttered three simple words.

"You're Next Lee"

The Sega CD then turned off. Ejecting the disk soon after. I stayed slack-jawed in awe and confusion for about a minute. I took the game out, and locked it in my junk drawer. 

I still see him sometimes. Like a ghost stalking me, I see him. Inticing me to put on the mask. Calling me to a utopia that will never exist. I've been prescribed hallucinogenic suppression pills, but they don't work. I still see him all the same, staring with those blank sockets of eyes. Telling me it will all go away if only I continue the fun. After all, Fun is Infinite with Sega Enterprises.y
