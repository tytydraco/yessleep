Hey Reddit, I need your help. I recently moved into a new flat, but it seems like I'm not the only one who's taken up residence here. There are ghosts lurking in the shadows, and I'm not sure how to get rid of them.

It all started a few weeks ago. At first, it was just small things. I would hear footsteps in the hallway, even though I was alone in my flat. Doors would open and close by themselves. I would catch glimpses of shadowy figures out of the corner of my eye.

But things have gotten worse. Much worse.

The ghosts have started to show themselves more openly. I've seen them in my dreams, with their pale faces and empty eyes. They whisper to me in the dark, telling me to give in to their power.

And then there are the physical manifestations. My possessions are being moved around, as if by an unseen force. Objects are falling off shelves and tables for no reason. And worst of all, I've started to feel their touch.

It's like a cold hand gripping my shoulder, or a breath on the back of my neck. I can't see them, but I can feel them all around me.

I've tried to get help. I've called in priests, psychics, and paranormal investigators. But no one has been able to help me. The ghosts seem to be too strong, too powerful for anyone to handle.

I'm not sure what to do next. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I can't sleep, I can't eat. I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the next attack.

Last night, I saw one of the ghosts more clearly than ever before. It was a young girl, with long black hair and a tattered dress. She looked like she was crying, and when I tried to approach her, she vanished into thin air.

I did some research and found out that a young girl died in this flat many years ago. Her name was Emily, and she was only six years old. I don't know if it's her that's haunting me, but I can't shake the feeling that she's trying to tell me something.

Reddit, please help me. I am writing this on a notepad at the moment and will update over the next couple of days before I post, I need more information on what exactly is going on here. 

*UPDATE* 

Hey Reddit, it's me again. I wanted to give you all an update on my situation with the ghosts in my flat. Things have taken a turn for the worse, and I'm really starting to fear for my safety.

As I mentioned in my previous post, I've been experiencing strange occurrences in my flat for weeks now. Doors opening and closing, objects moving on their own, and a feeling of being constantly watched. But last night, things escalated to a whole new level.

I was lying in bed, trying to get to sleep, when I heard a strange noise coming from my living room. It sounded like something was scratching at the walls. I got up to investigate, and that's when I saw it.

One of the ghosts, a woman with long, stringy hair and a twisted expression, was standing in the middle of my living room. She was scratching at the walls with her long, sharp nails, leaving deep gouges in the plaster.

I tried to run back to my bedroom, but she was too fast. She lunged at me, and I felt her icy grip around my neck. I struggled to break free, but it was like she was made of stone.

Eventually, I managed to wriggle free and ran to the door. But when I tried to open it, it wouldn't budge. It was like the ghost was holding it shut from the other side.

I was trapped, alone in my flat with a vengeful ghost. I thought I was going to die.

But then, just as suddenly as it had started, the ghost disappeared. The door swung open, and I stumbled out into the hallway, gasping for air.

I don't know what to do. The ghosts in my flat are getting more aggressive by the day, and I'm starting to feel like I'm in real danger. I've tried everything to get rid of them, but nothing has worked. I feel like I'm running out of options.

Reddit, please help me. I need your advice. How can I get rid of these ghosts before it's too late?
