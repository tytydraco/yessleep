My sister was really into the occult and supernatural, even called herself wiccan when she was in her late teens. She made me do a lot of weird shit with her, cut our hands and give our blood to bond with a tree, try to talk to the dead in abandoned buildings or on train tracks. Those memories seem almost fun if it weren't for the fact she'd hit me if I didn't go along with her.

Once she brought me to a building half submerged in the earth in the middle of the woods. Shrubs, flowers, and vines were trying to cover the roof. A tiny stream running through the forest, caused by a recent rainstorm, slipped into the building and somehow trickled out the other side. A rotting wooden door the size of a window led into the attic. We crawled through.

We sat in the attic, no sign of the stream, she tried to call to whoever built it, asked what it used to be for. No one answered, there was nothing in there but rotting wooden walls and spiders, she'd laugh when I got scared of them. I think that's what she really got out of this, pleasure from my fear.

I dreamt for a while afterwards of all the people submerged in the earth, like that building, the dirt slowly rising and eating them. They’d try to continue on with their lives, stuck in place, before they're digested by trees. I never told my sister; I didn't want to encourage her. I still have those dreams sometimes, it's just, now I know who those people are.

It wasn't until she was 13 that she found the serious stuff, the real stuff, a website that no longer exists filled with rituals and spells and games. It was called something grimoire; I can't remember exactly.

She wanted to try one of them out with me, like always. She led me into the woods behind our house, through the thick brush with thorns that always scraped you, through the really tall grass, above my head at that point, that always gave you ticks, into a small clearing under the tree we were bonded to. It towered over the rest, knots in the bark almost forming a face watching over us.

She told me to sit, the patchy grass and dirt felt soft. I never minded dirtying my shorts. She placed a closed yugioh starter deck tin across from me, something ominous surely inside. I know now it was a bone, probably one of my baby teeth. She placed three candles around me and lit them, then poured salt in a circle around it all. The circle was small, not including the stone wall a foot behind me that denotes this land belonged to someone forever ago, not including any trees, only me, the candles, and the tin.

It was then she finally told me we were summoning a demon, that if I left the circle, it would be free to roam the earth and probably destroy the whole world.

I was 8, by the way. I was scared like I always was, of her, that it might be real, but I knew in my gut that it wasn't, nothing had ever happened before. She told me to say some incantation, I can't remember what it was exactly anymore, it was Latin, but I know what it means in English, and that the ritual will still work if you say it in English. "I come with what is yours to ask for more, an affront I beg you to ignore, as I put what is mine in your palm."

Nothing happened for a moment, the breeze waned, birds still sang, I thought it hadn't worked, like always. Then I saw the bones starting to slip out of the earth, everywhere within the circle, avoiding me and the candles, but consuming the tin, the antlers of deer, skulls of rats and raccoons and cats and even a bear, the rest of their bones too, but I couldn't really identify more than the skulls back then. They all grew out of the ground and moved into the shape of a figure. There was no sound, the ground didn't shake, the earth wasn’t displaced by any of this, like this was the way it was supposed to be, corrected now. The figure looked kind of like a person, looked kind of like me, sitting the same way too. It was imitating me, not just my skeleton but my whole body, except the skin was the dirty white of buried bones, filled with holes and spotted with moss and fungus. It's face was made up of many little leg bones, the eye holes made of the jaws of rodents, the mouth never opened.

I was terrified of course, I knew I was going to die, I was sobbing. I would've destroyed the world to get myself out of that situation, but I was too scared to realize I could. My sister was excited, the widest smile I’d ever seen. The figure spoke, not like we do, it echoes out from their body, you can feel it in your emotions. It's so incredibly strange, but I always knew what they meant. I like to think I'm pretty good at translating them, so I will.

"How clever. You offer a child and have them summon me. You want my blessing without any risk, but I cannot see outside your circle so your trick is meaningless, I can only talk to this nothing, offering. I abhor clever people."

My sister looked annoyed now, said something I couldn’t hear.

I didn't like being called nothing or offering, and my parents were always telling me to introduce myself when I meet new people. They seemed to not like my sister, so maybe we could get along. I said through tears "hi, my name is Sage." And they told me their name back, beings like this have to actually, but I didn't know that. It's hard to get across, but most accurately, their name is ‘fear that with your next step your skeleton will step out of you, your skin falling to the ground, hope for a god that loves something in you, dedication to the smallest of details’. I like to think Our Internal Perfectionist is a good fit, my sister just called them Bone God.

"Well, Sage, since I've got you here, why don't we play a game." They said my name like watching your cow graze happily in a field before bringing it to a slaughterhouse.

"If you show me that you aren't clever, I won't tear your disgusting face off."

I didn't understand what they meant, was this a game I was supposed to lose, I always lost at anything I played with my sister. I didn't like to, I wanted to think I was clever.

"A fox and a sheep decide to share their food for the winter, the sheep has a field of grass, the fox has 6 rabbits, what does the fox eat for the winter."

It seemed obvious, was obvious what they wanted? I struggled to get myself to say, "half of the rabbits and half of the field."

"Good, show me you're not clever and I won't take my bones from your dominant arm."

Out of the corner of my eye, I could tell my sister was laughing. Did I get it right or wrong? Which did they want?

"I fall in love with a human, I ask her to meet me in the grove in the forest behind her church. When I arrive, she is not there. I wait a day, then two, then a week, then a year, then a millennium, after which she finally arrives, how long did I wait?"

This wasn't simple, it was a big word, by 8 year old me's standards, one I had only just learned to mean 1000 years. I considered acting like I didn't know what that meant or getting the number wrong on purpose, but wouldn't doing that be clever, but then wouldn't answering correctly to avoid doing that also be clever. Did thinking that mean I was already too clever, was my bone already gone, like it had never been there? It was still there, I gave up and just answered "1000 years."

"Good. Show me you aren't clever and I won't turn you inside out. A stranger offers you candy and whatever you want, if you play a game with them. Do you?"

This one was obvious too, my parents had told me the answer to this question 100 times. "No."

A smile echoed into my bones. "Sorry, you're the smallest bit too clever."

Before I could say anything, Our Internal Perfectionist was standing, the bones rearranged so they were above me, their hand reaching into my skull. My flesh moved out of their way, like there was always supposed to be a hole in my head. It still hurt like someone was flaying the skin from my skull. I screamed, and my sister's face finally showed worry, fear.

They folded my skin down my body, it wasn't long before my eyes were pulled out of my skull and I was blind, before my vocal cords were peeled away from my larynx and I could no longer scream, but I felt every second of it, every inch of skin peel off, every bone and organ sliding out of me. I couldn't tell which parts of me were me afterward, I didn't understand why I was still alive, why I had to still be in pain.

Our Internal Perfectionist started pulling apart my bones, out of sockets, snapping them in half, crushing my lungs, heart, muscles and brain into a paste. I felt it all somehow like I was coming apart, turning to dust. They started attaching the bones back to my inverted flesh, in ways I knew weren't right, covering my new bones with the paste of my old body's useless scraps. Finally, I felt myself, truly myself, in their grasp, in a way no one else ever had. They rearranged my soul in their image, an honor I now understand. And when they finished, I understood, they were everything that mattered, my master. I was excited, in awe, afraid and so happy to be in their presence, to be theirs.

I could see again, I could see out of my bones now, I could see myself even. My skin was bright red, leaking blood, like I was one big open wound, my eyes pure white, facing the wrong way, nose and mouth concave, my arms and legs useless dangling flaps. My new limbs, made of bone and sealed in what used to give me life, similarly red, were so much longer than my arms and legs were before, 6 feet long each. I had 6 of them, each reaching out of a random point of my body, like it didn't matter at all, ending in a claw, 6 long fingers. I stood now, off the ground, two of my new hands holding me up, the other four balanced against the invisible barrier keeping us in. I was still in pure agony. It felt like the way I was supposed to be, always was, but the pain still knew and cried out never ending, the first thing my new voice managed was a sob, emotion pouring out, like my master.

My master didn't turn their attention to me again, they were still in my former image, my own skull now making their face. Their attention was on my horrified, disgusted sister.

"You see that she is mine now, she will do many things for me, but I cannot leave here to look after her. So you are getting something out of this, you will have her too, to look after for me. Do not disappoint, clever one."

My master slipped back into the earth, my hands slipped off the barrier as it disappeared, rebalanced myself against the tree I now felt no connection with. My sister stared at me, scared of me, no idea how to explain this to her parents. She said something about me going back to the way I was before, and suddenly I knew I could, and I had to.

I used my new hands to grab the hole still in the top of my head and peel my skin back down, tucking and moving my limbs inside my skin as I went. My bones tried to fill out my body as best they could, but my skin felt baggy. I looked right though and when I touched myself, it was solid. I could see out of my eyes and speak from my mouth. The only way you could tell something was wrong was the hole in the center of my hair.

My sister's mood brightened, told me I was cool, like a transformer. She didn't realize until later that I had to do whatever she said. She never had to hit me again, although she still would sometimes.

I was still in agony, all the pain was just tucked away inside my body now, ibuprofen helps a little.

If you want to try this ritual, I'd recommend you bring something meaningful as an offering if you don't want them to take you. Some other life might work, something significant they don't have might work. I haven't heard of someone trying it, but from what I know I think they'd accept a cell phone. Baby teeth will suffice for the bone in the tin, the more the better.. Always bring a friend you trust with you that won't be in the circle, in case they'll be looking after you. And you probably shouldn't do it in the woods, because of forest fires. Don't worry, there are bones everywhere.
