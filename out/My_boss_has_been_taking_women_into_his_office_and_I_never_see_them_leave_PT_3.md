I've always hated spirit mediums.

&#x200B;

They're inconsiderate assholes, usually in gaudy clothes and fake accents, scamming people out of their money and using their dead loved ones to do it. It's a despicable, dishonest career and to this day I will always hate the fame and money people like Ed and Lorraine Warren got with this scam. Even if I do like their movies. During late nights when my brother Ronnie isn't working part time at Mooyah's we'll watch bad reality tv shows that involve mediums and debate if they're legit or not. I always win.

&#x200B;

Apparently, Boston doesn't share my point of view.

&#x200B;

Madame Esmerelda was a tall, lanky middle aged woman with an obvious fake tan and red hair so poorly dyed the grey roots looked like they were waging war with it. She wore typical gaudy, chunky jewelry and flowey, layered clothes you'd expect from someone like her. She even wore ankle bracelets. Apparently, she worked with Boston every now and then, and while that should have made me believe she had at least a grasp on what she was doing...I found myself doubting it. She'd met us at the Denny's where I'd spoken to Boston three nights ago and when I walked in she was already going on about how she didn't like scruffy, who sat in his usual seat on the other side of the restaurant, very clearly able to hear her from where she stood at the front. The guy always made me feel uneasy but I honestly felt bad for him. There he sat, stained as usual, eyes bloodshot and bagged from a clear lack of sleep, a few bruises on his face, just trying to eat his damn meal while this crazy white lady was going on and on to Boston about how his 'Ka' was wrong and he was 'clearly dangerous, like a wild beast'.

&#x200B;

I made eye contact with scruffy and he almost seemed to smile when I rolled my eyes and gave him the universal gesture for 'this bitch crazy'.

&#x200B;

"Kid, there you are." Boston greeted me when he noticed my arrival. He'd made me stay home the last three days to try and recuperate from what we found in the alley. That poor woman. At least it gave me a chance to spend the holiday with Ronnie, he got me Pokemon ultra moon, the newest game in the franchise.

&#x200B;

"I told you, my name is Libby." "Well you should pick a new name to use." He replied, "You don't want anyone we chase down to track you by your name, right?" He had a point. "I'll think about it. Shouldn't your friend be a little quitter if she's going to talk about someone in earshot?" I gave the woman, who's name I didn't know at the time, a frown. One she returned. "*I* am Madame Esmerelda, seer of the dead and the truth, tool for spirits to speak through and share their knowledge. And you are...*Libby*, it seems." She said my name with distain, and the feeling was mutual. Before I could react she reached out and grabbed my face, turning it this way and that, running her fingers along my cheekbone and jawline. I felt very uncomfortable. She even pulled my glasses away and held my eye open, staring into it. After giving a huff she let go, handing me back my glasses. "There is nothing special about this girl. You should send her home before she gets too involved and hurt."

&#x200B;

Well that was a load of shit.

&#x200B;

"Trust me, Esmerelda, I know what I'm doing with this one." Boston assured her. This woman was proving to have zero sense of personal space as she snatched one of my hands and held it palm up, dragging a long green nail across it. Frowning, she pulled my hand up closer to her eyes. A palm reading. I knew of them of course, nearly everyone knows of them in this day and age. Back in high school, well one of my high schools, a goth guy gave me a palm reading. He told me I would die in a house full of strangers, and that an axe would be involved.

&#x200B;

"You are, as I said, nothing special." Esmerelda said, still running her nails over my palm lines, "Nothing you have done in your life up until now has been important and nothing you do after this in your life will be important. You watched Freedom die, that was all." That last part caught me off guard. "What..was that?" I asked. "I said, nothing you do after this in your life will be important." Esmerelda replied, as if she never said anything about freedom. Boston grabbed my wrist and pulled it from her grasp. "That's enough of that, Esme, the kid is sticking around and that's final. Now stop bothering her and the poor guy back there and let's get to the scene." He then dropped my hand and turned to leave the Denny's without another word. I shot Esmerelda a frown and quickly went after him, shoving my hands into my jacket pockets. Anyone who knows Ohio knows how awful the cold is this time of year. Just another reason to hate this place. "You seen your boss around lately?" Boston asked over his shoulder. I shook my head, "No, I was just pulling some overtime during the break that day. I haven't stepped foot in the school since." "Good, good. Then we're returning to the crime scene...will you be okay with that?" This time he actually glanced back at me.

&#x200B;

I thought back to a comment I got on here, about how I should really get my whole puking thing under control if I was going to be involved in this investigation.

&#x200B;

It's a good thing I decided to skip lunch when Boston came calling. I'm still not sure how he got my number though.

&#x200B;

"I'm good." I gave Boston a nod and he gave me a crooked half smile before pulling his hat over his eyes and turning down the next alley. When we got closer to the crime scene Esmerelda pushed past me and followed Boston as he stepped over the yellow tape. The cops had already cleaned up everything. Now all that was left was a smell and dried blood, and a homeless woman crouched near a dumpster in the far corner. Not too strange considering the area we were in. The other two didn't acknowledge her so neither did I.

&#x200B;

"Yes.." Esmerelda began, lifting her arms in the air just as the wind picked up, causing the long sleeves to billow in the air dramatically. "I can sense a presence here, yes. You said this was a scene of violence, correct?" She turned to face Boston, arms still outstretched. "Yeah, a girl last seen with my suspect." As they spoke I noted the woman near the dumpster shift in her position, head lifted to watch us now. My blood turned cold.

&#x200B;

It was the girl.

&#x200B;

"Boston..." I tried, but Esmerelda spoke over me, her tone louder as if to drown me out. God, I hate her already. "Yes, I sense the girl. She is here." She walked slowly towards the corner, but not the one the girl sat in. "She is here. Yes. Here. Dear, hello? Can you hear me? I am Madame Esmerelda. What is your name?" She looked like a nutter, talking to that empty corner. I looked back to the girl, who was now twitching her head to the side uncomfortably. Like the jerky movements from a Japanese horror movie. Something was vibrating nearby. Esmerelda carried on, "Elizabeth Witt..that's a lovely name, dear. A very lovely name." And one that she could have just gotten off the news yesterday when they reported on the murder. The urge to roll my eyes was so hard it actually hurt. "I sense you want to tell us what happened, yes? You can talk to me."

&#x200B;

By now the girl had stood, and she looked *pissed*. She walked towards Esmerelda, her movements still jerky and I was thankful that, despite how close she'd gotten to me, she didn't seem to pay me any mind at all. She got right up in Esmerelda's face, screaming at her, but nothing was coming out. Instead, that vibrating noise grew more frequent. I had an idea what was going on.

&#x200B;

I've seen ghosts for as long as I could remember.

&#x200B;

Remember how I said I immediately knew that Esmerelda was full of shit? Yeah.

I made my way to the dumpster as the vibrating continued and Esmerelda continued asking her questions, unable to hear the ghost of the dead girl no matter how hard she pretended. I got down on my hands and knees and reached under the dumpster, groping around until my hand closed around something small and hard. I pulled it out and knew I'd been right on the money. A grey flip phone, adorned with some cute bear charms. It had 6 messages already. I flipped the phone open and was greeted with the background image of Elizabeth Witt and some girl on the quad of the university. 

&#x200B;

She'd gone to my school. She looked so happy. Poor girl 

&#x200B;

A new image popped up. I clicked on it, and it lead to a flurry of texts with no number attached. 

&#x200B;

**I can hear you.** 

**I didn't answer you.** 

**You aren't even looking at me.** 

**Liar.** 

**Shut up!**

**Stop!**

Elizabeth was more angry than any ghost I had ever seen. Text after text after text came in but I couldn't read them anymore. I pushed myself off the ground and stomped over to Esmerelda, who was completely unaware of the ghost girl trying to grab her, trying to scream at her. Another pathetic scam artist. "Esmerelda." I spoke up, but either she couldn't hear me or pretended not to. So I tried again, "Esmerelda!" "I am *working*, child!" She snapped at me, "Very important, delicate work. So be a good girl and-" "You can't really see her." I interrupted her, "And she *knows*. she's angry at you." I shoved the phone in her face as it continued to vibrate in my hand. Color drained from Esmerelda's face as her eyes scanned the messages. She opened her mouth to speak but I was tired of the sound of her voice. I turned to face Elizabeth and froze when I found her mere inches from my face. I could see her, and she knew that now. 

&#x200B;

"....Who killed you?" I asked. One more message came in.
