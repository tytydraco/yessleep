Hello. I don’t know how much time I have so I’ll try to keep this short. I’ve barricaded the door but I don’t know if it’ll hold much longer. I’m trapped in this tiny utility closet with no way out except for that door, and I can already hear their wet cracking and squelching. Good, that fucking sound. I don’t think I’m getting out of here alive, so I’ll try to get the message out to the outside world. I’m done for, but maybe some of you can send help to anyone still alive. If there are any.

The sounds are gone, but it might just be alerting it’s friends. Maybe it’s left for good, but I can’t get my hopes up. I need to focus on getting the message out, then maybe if I’m not actively under attack I’ll try to get out. 

Anyway, I guess I have to start somewhere. I’m Andy McNamara, 43 years old, janitor at Junesburgh Highschool. First odd occurrence? That must’ve been last Thursday, when they found that dead dog. 

Junesburgh High isn’t a big or famous school, but we do, erm did have a pretty decent swim team. Really the only thing we had to offer. The building is connected to the local swimming pools by a corridor, and the swim team practices there pretty often. Well, I wasn’t personally there to witness it but apparently last Thursday the kids found a dead dog in one of the pools. Drowned, the poor thing. I don’t think it was clear who’s dog it was, although I heard rumors of it being old man Jonesy’s beagle. Kids were pretty shook up, but their coach, Sally Vernon, took care of it. She didn’t even call me in to take care of the body, but she’s always been a pretty hands-on type person so I figure she dealt with it just fine on her own. 

No one knows exactly how it got there, the pools are open to the public but obviously dogs are not allowed in there so that doesn’t explain it. Maybe it snuck in somewhere, I don’t know. How a dog managed to drown is a different mystery, considering there are stairs going into the water in the shallow part. But, there’s no way to explain it. A tragic happening, that shut down the pools over the weekend, but nothing more. Or so we thought.

Things were back to normal on Monday, expect for the kids complaining about a foul smell in the bathrooms and in the showers. We’ve had multiple issues with plumbing in the past so no one thought about it, just assumed it’d be gone after a day or two and if it was any longer then we’d maybe check it out. Stupid bastards.

It was today, on Tuesday that something went really wrong. See, I was taking my lunch break in the security guard’s room. The security guard himself, a young man named Henry Anderson, may God rest his soul, was a fairly nice kid, a little bit of an overachiever considering he was paid pennies to guard a small town highschool, but other than that perfectly pleasant. We’d gotten pretty close, comparing our work experiences and helping each other out whenever possible. We were both eating lunch, dry sandwiches and watery coffee, talking about nothing special when suddenly Henry’s walkie-talkie crackled to life. It was Sally. She sounded frantic. 

“Henry, Henry you need to get here, now! Something’s-“

She cut herself off. Henry and I looked at each other. There were noises in the background. Strange noises. It was hard to hear through the crackly walkie-talkie, but it sounded like frantic babbling. Maybe crying? Sally yelled something unintelligible, then returned.

“Henry turn your goddamn cameras on, then get your ass over here. There’s something in the pools”

The walkie-talkie abruptly shut off, and we sat in silence for a moment.

“What the hell” mumbled Henry. He leaned over, and fiddled with his computers. The security cameras overlooking the pools were only on at night, for the privacy of the visitors and to only look out for nightly intruders. But this was clearly an emergency. Henry got up and grabbed his baton, the most dangerous weapon he was allowed to carry.

“You keep an eye on that, I’ll see what’s going on”

I just nodded, put down my coffee cup and moved over to the computers. Henry ducked out of the room and I heard him jog away. The corridor to the pools was only a couple minutes walk away from here, he’d be there in a moment if he ran.

I switched on the right cameras and took in the sight. The cameras were old and the footage blurry and grainy as all hell, but I could make out the strangely dim poolroom. I saw the biggest pool in somewhat clear view. I couldn’t entirely make out what was going on. I saw the drain in the middle as a dark spot, that seemed to writhe under the disturbed surface. At first I thought it was simply a trick of the light and shifting waters, but no. There was something billowing around, out of the drain. Something dark and … hairy? Whatever it was it was moving out of the drain, seemingly growing from the size of a cat or small dog to something bigger as it got more space to move. Something vaguely resembling a person. The shifting surface made it hard to get a grip on it’s appearance, but it seemed to have two arms, a torso and a head. It also seemed to be covered in hair.

Suddenly I saw movement in the corner of the screen. I’d been staring in a trance at the thing. But now I saw Sally. She was moving irrationally. At first I thought she was having a seizure, but as she stumbled more into frame I saw the humanoid thing gripping her, almost like a hug. It’s face was buried in her neck, which seemed strange until it yanked it’s head away and I saw the huge, gaping wound in her throat. Blood sprayed, and the creature dig back in, tearing of more meat. Sally’s head lulled back, only held on by a few tendons and some skin. The creature dropped her, and crouched over her, tearing into her lifeless body. Blood began pooling, dripping into the water, dying it bright red.

I stared in horror. It was all over in a few seconds, but watching that thing rip into her flesh and bones like it was nothing felt like watching a seven hour snuff movie. I saw something red and tube-like slip into the pool and realized with a choked sob that it was her intestines.

I was about to shut off the computer when I remembered Henry. Oh God, Henry. He’d be there any second. I grabbed my walkie-talkie with such force I worried I’d break it, and practically screamed.

“Henry! Henry!”

“Hey man, what’s going on? You see something on the cameras?”

“Henry get the fuck outta there! You need to run!”

“Man you’re freaking me out. Saw a bunch of students running out of the corridor, what, did they find another do-“

Henry got quiet. Very, very quiet. I didn’t see him on the cameras but I knew he stood by the entrance to the pools. I could hear heavy breathing in the walkie-talkie.

The creature in the pool was crawling up the steps, but froze as it spotted Henry. 

I could feel the tension so thick it was suffocating. I didn’t dare to breathe. From the walkie-talkie I could hear a faint tearing and cracking over the static, and a much clearer, much closer whimpering.

“Henry” I whispered, mostly to myself. I don’t think the walkie-talkie even picked it up. Henry’s whimpering grew into a low groan. The creature lunged.

The scream that echoed out from my walkie-talkie was the most horrific thing I’ve ever heard. It filled the security guard room for a second, before being cut short with a series of terrible tearing, cracking and ripping noises. I shrieked myself and hurled it away from me, smack into a wall where it broke. I just sat there, screaming for a second before breaking into sobs. I vomited right on the floor, splashing my pants and shoes with undigested sandwich. I couldn’t stop dry heaving and crying. I couldn’t even think straight. What was that thing? I glanced back at the screen and felt another wave of panic and nausea. There were four of them on land, in view of the camera, and more coming from the drain. Their features were blurred by the static, but I could make out thin, gnarled bodies and bony limbs with odd-looking joints. Inky skin with some tufts of wet hair. Vaguely humanoid heads. And God, they were big. It was hard to tell exactly but they must’ve been at least seven feet tall, in their strange hunched postures. 

What was left of Sally’s body slipped into the pool, turning the already red-tinted water even murkier, making it harder to see the things crawling out of the drain. I saw blood pooling in the corner of the screen, and knew it was Henry.

The creatures suddenly began moving. They went offscreen, into the corridor. Into the school. 

I’m not ashamed to admit that I panicked. I mean, there ain’t no HR training for “demons crawling out of the pool drains and eating people”. I didn’t know what to do. The security guard has access to the PA system, for security purposes. I threw myself in the thing, barely able to keep my voice from giving out.

“All students and teachers, I-“

I had no idea what to say, so I improvised.

“Something terrible has happened in the pools, you need to take cover in your classrooms. If you’re not in one, either go into the closest one or lock yourself in the bathroom and don’t go out. You understand? This is an emergency, don’t go into the halls for the love of God, just stay put!”

My voice gave in and I just collapsed, trying to calm my breathing. We were going to be fine. This was ok. I was ok.

That’s when I heard it. It was far in the distance. It was a sound I will never forget. A wet sort of cracking, like cracking eggs. And then this almost squelching sound. Accompanied by this incessant dripping noise.

I didn’t need to see what it was. I knew exactly what was prowling the halls.

A quick glance at the door almost made me break down again. It wasn’t locked. I hurled myself at it, locking it and then immediately pushing over a shelf to barricade it. I didn’t care about the noise. I needed to keep that thing out. 

I stood completely still, not daring to do anything else. It was all quiet and still outside.

What first hit me was the smell. It crept through the cracks like smoke, an overwhelming stench of sewage and chlorine. I tried my best not to cough as it got stronger. And then the sounds got louder. The cracking, the dripping and the squelching. I tried not to gag. I covered my face and tried to breathe normally. IamsafeIamsafeIamsafeIamsafeIamsafe, I chanted in my head. 

When I looked up again I screamed.

Pressed against the tiny window on the door was the most horrific face I’d ever seen. Pitch black skin covered in an oily layer. Rotted flesh flaying off, revealing something hard and smooth below. Random tufts of hair that looked more like what clogs your sink rather than normal hair. A large, staring eye. Watching me. Quietly observing. It was pressed so hard against the glass I could hear the strain that was put on it. It had smeared something dark red all over it.

We just stared at each other. All that was heard was that dripping and a deep, labored breathing that wasn’t my own. 

Then, as quick as it had appeared it disappeared. Leaving a red sheen on the glass, with minuscule cracks formed on it. I sucked in a massive breath, and tried to stop myself from passing out.

Something slammed into the door with such force it shook the room. I shrieked and stumbled back. Another slam, window shattering and showering me with glass. Another, and the door was groaning under the force. It wasn’t going to hold. 

I got to my feet, glancing around in a panic. Nothing to use as a weapon. Then I spotted the door. A door that lead out to the neighboring corridor. Out to more monsters.

I hesitated. Another slam, and part of the door splintered. I threw myself as my escape door, barely able to twist the knob but finally succeeding, running into the corridor and throwing the door closed behind me. 

I ran. I didn’t know where I was running, I was just trying to get away. I didn’t stop until that smell was gone, and until I couldn’t hear the crashing sounds in the security guard room. 

I stopped and leaned against a wall, trying to catch my breath. My lungs hurt, my legs burned. I saw black spots dancing around. I took a moment to breathe, then anxiously checked my surroundings. It was silent, and empty. That scared me even more.

My next plan was to head for the exit. I needed to get help. I wasn’t far from the main entrance, I just needed to get there. My steps echoed and my breathing seemed to fill the halls, I was so tense it hurt. Legs shook so bad I could barely walk, but I kept on going. It wasn’t far, just had to get to the entrance. 

I passed several classrooms, where it was quiet and dark. That was a good thing, hopefully. I consider knocking on the door to see if I could slip in and hide with them, but I doubted they’d let me in. I needed to get to the entrance. Just had to get there. It was close. The things probably hadn’t gotten that far. Just get to the entrance, it’s so close.

I turned a corner, freedom so close I could taste it’s funky air. Wait-

It was there. A creature, easily twice my height. Right in front of the door, hunched over the body of Mary-Anne Wilkinson, the principal. It was tearing of huge pieces of flesh, chewing with grotesquely wet sounds, easily cracking bones between it’s powerful jaws. Her guts spilled out over the floor, blood smeared all the way to the door. She’d been so close, fighting the monster to the end. But it hadn’t mattered. Now she was food for this demon from the drain, which was completely focused on it’s feast. It hadn’t noticed me. I shook so badly it should’ve heard me but no.

The thing tore into her arm, grinding bones to dust and shredding her bicep muscle. That’s when I heard it. A low, quiet moan.

She was still alive. 

I couldn’t stop the horrified little squeak that escaped my throat. The thing’s eyes immediately snapped up, looking right at me. 

Something warm and wet tricked down my leg. The monster observed me, tilting it’s head to the left. Contemplating me. All while chewing on a piece of skin and meat. 

I felt lightheaded, and wondered if passing out was the preferable way to go.

The thing swallowed loudly, tilted it’s head back and let out a deep, guttural bellow. It shook every bone in my body, caused my teeth to clatter and my muscles to tighten. Then it went back to feeding, ripping Mary-Anne’s arm clean off it’s socket. 

I fled. I could hear excited , inhuman chattering somewhere in the corridor but I didn’t dare look back. I ran until I saw an open door, which I hurled myself through. I flipped over every shelf, pushed chairs and tables against it, then curled up in a corner, trying to stay quiet. 

And that catches you up to everything that’s happened. I’ve been here for hours. I’ve heard screaming, howling, chattering. That smell has passed me more times than I can count. It took me a damn long time to realize I had my phone i my pocket, and I cried with relief. That was until I realized I couldn’t call anyone. Something’s blocking my calls, and the police won’t even pick up. I don’t understand. I have some Wi-Fi, but I can’t get in contact with anyone. 

I’m posting this here so that maybe someone can help me. Please, if you can, call the police, fire department, the goddamn military to Juneburgh Highschool in Maryland! We need you. The ones that are left.

It’s been so quiet since I started writing. Maybe they are gone? I can’t take this anymore, I’m going to try to get out. I’m pretty close to an emergency exit I think. If I don’t update this I’m probably dead. I just wanna say, Madeleine, I’m so sorry, and Stacy, I’m even more sorry. Please forgive me. I love you. I need to go. I’m sorry.
