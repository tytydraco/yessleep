My name is... actually, it doesn't matter. You don't need to know anything about me since most likely you don't even care. You're here for the story, but I don't blame you, I don't like introductions either. Instead, I'm going to tell you my dad's story from the time he was fighting for our country in World War II. He passed away 10 years ago, without letting me know anything about the time he was in the army. I wanted to hear his stories ever since I was a little kid, but he never wished to do it. I know that's ironic since every father that was in the army won't stop talking about it, but now I get why. Now I get why he wasn't doing it. You see, there's something here with us, something that can easily fool me or you, something that would feel no remorse killing you and leaving your family and friends in despair. 

A couple months after his death, I started going through his things, looking for any memory left of him. That's when I found his army diary forgotten in the attic. It had a hard cardboard cover with a handwritten title that said: "Diary to keep me sane". Out of morbid curiosity, I opened it up. I was suprised to find that it was empty, alteast the first half of it. Maybe it was just in case someone tried to sneakily look through it? Either way, the first written page was titled: "First Day", plain and simple. Now I am going to tell the story as it says in the journal:

"I don't like to keep a diary, but I feel like I'll need it. I already miss my wife and my only child, but what can I do? Now I'm in the airline heading to Asia. Can't lie, I'm shitting my pants right now, but I can't let it stop me. I can't be weak in front of the enemy."

He skipped half of the page, and continued writing on the bottom part:

"We are setting up the camps. I have to rest a little bit."

This is the last line he wrote before everything took a turn. The next pages are filled with all types of repeated nonsense, words I can't understand.

"Fallen fallen fallen fallen. Behind Behind Behind. Do you? you? me? who?"

His wrote story continues after several pages filled with things like the one above.

"Day 2. I have never slept better in my life. I wish it stood that way, because when I woke up, half of my mates were dead. Has the Japanese army already found us? If so, why would they only kill half of us, also how did no one notice? We are going to investigate the area, but I'll be back with an update." 

"They found us. Locked us separately. Tortured and tried to scare us with some sort of monster they most likely made up. Atleast they let me keep the journal, which is the closest thing I have from home. I hear some footsteps coming from the hallway. It's so dark in here, I can only rely on my hearing. I'm writing out of muscle memory at this point. The footsteps are getting closer and closer. I think they came back to torture me again. Or.. wait, the footsteps stopped before reaching my door. They are taking someone else. I can hear his screams, begging for help and mercy. I might not be the bravest man but atleast I don't make myself look like a fool in front of the enemy. Oh, the footsteps are getting closer again. They are unlocking my door, I'll be back with an update if I come back. I'm taking my diary with me."

"They threw me in another cell, far from the one I've been in before. It feels cold and there's a sour smell in the air. Atleast I'm not alone. I think there's some else here too because I heard noises from the other part of the cell. I'm going to talk with him."

He skipped a couple pages before writing this:

"No no no no. There has to be someone here, not only that I feel it, but I have also heard it. I yelled and the person that has to be here, but the only response I got was my echo."

"This presence I'm feeling it's starting to drive me crazy. I know there has to be somebody but I can't reach him."

"I don't think the person here with me it's what I thought it was. His presence started becoming more and more heavy. I'm not feeling well about this. I'm either going insane, or there's really someone here running away from me. There has to be someone."

The next page had tons of blood and the writing was even more messed up than the previous pages.

"He's not human. His presence started to make sense. The more i waited the more overwhelming his presence got. I only now realise how demonic it is. I'm scared. I'm hiding in one of the corners, hoping he won't start looking for me. He started screaming. He's screaming for someone, but there's something wrong. Why is his voice so similar to mine? Actually identical? And why do I hear a pen scratching the surface of a paper? I'm scared and confused at the same time. I don't know what I'm more afraid of, the fact that this proved my point or that I feel it getting closer."

The writing stopped here. This is where my blood ran cold. I remember receiving a mail that mentioned my dad's death. I definitely was more then surprised to see him back home, but if my dad got killed, who came back?
