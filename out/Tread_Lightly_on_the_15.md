Hey everybody, I could use some help. I only woke up a couple of days ago, but the memories returned to me earlier today. As I have been processing my events from the previous week, it all seemed too much to bear. So, thanks to some helpful tips from a couple of friends, I have come here to ask for some more information, or to at least warn you about the dangers of the 15.

  
Quick background, I grew up in California. Southern, to be more exact. I loved it and wanted to go back ever since I had left. I moved all across the country and had only moved back recently when something odd happened that I don't recall ever experiencing before. If you've lived in California and been up to Las Vegas, chances are you drove through Interstate 15. It's this long highway that stretches from San Diego up to the Canadian Border. Growing up in California and going on road trips with my family was normal, so the 15 was a regular part of my childhood. Vast desert and nothing as far as the eye can see. Mountains shadowing the desolate landscape, and not a cloud in the sky. Last week, I took off work to go and meet up with some friends in Las Vegas. Go hang out, drink a little, gamble, live it up as anyone would in "Sin City". I packed my car with just the essentials: my suitcase with clothing and other necessary toiletries, my laptop, and some snacks I grabbed at 7-11 during my gas fill. And then I was off. 

  
You'll have to forgive my poor writing. I am still quite dazed, and it's harder to type with one hand than I ever thought it would be. Also, the constant sound of beeping machinery and nurses talking makes it hard to focus. Anyways, back to my story. The trip was going very smoothly, just another long 5-hour drive on the 15. I faintly remember having some Cheez-its in my hand, listening to The Foundations when my first odd experience happened. It was about 2 hours into my trip, well out of the city area and deep into the desert of nothing. There are never cops on the 15 except for close to slightly larger towns, so I usually cruise a little above the speed limit. I was pretty relaxed when, out of nowhere, a racing blur zoomed by me at incredible speed. I remember cursing and grabbing onto my wheel, attempting to wrestle my car back onto the road since the passing vehicle's draft was so strong. I tried to look ahead and find who had passed me, but it was already almost out of view. I thought it was strange, since I had never been passed by a car at such speed before. I was probably going 85, this thing was going at least 2 or 3 times that. Like I said, the draft it left behind was enough to almost knock my car off the road. I sat back in my seat, rationalizing it as just some idiot in a sports car when I noticed something in my rearview mirror. There was a car, but the speed at which it grew in my mirror was frightening. Within a few seconds, it had gone from very tiny, almost inconceivable, to right behind me. This car also passed me with such great speed, except I was more prepared and kept my hands tight on the wheel to prevent it from steering off course.

  
I tried to get a good look at what kind of car it was, but it moved so fast that all I could catch was the color. Red. I continued to drive for another 5 minutes when another car passed me at an insane speed. This one was black. It happened a few more times, interchanging between the two colors. Red, black, red. I wondered if it had meant something, but I felt some odd fear rise inside me, knowing this wasn't normal. Sure, people would speed on the 15 all the time, myself included. But the speed at which these cars drove was much too high, almost inhuman, and it felt no coincidence that they interchanged colors between red and black. I was getting close to a small town and wanted to stop just to take a breather and fill up on gas. I could make the trip on one full tank, but I didn't see why I should chance it. I grabbed a Gatorade inside the gas station and went out to sit by my car, which was being filled with gas. I finished filling up and started to make my way back to the freeway. I put on a playlist of my favorite band, Panic! At The Disco, hoping it would cheer me up and help me forget about the odd occurrence. 

  
Unfortunately, I had the discomfort of noticing the homes along the road as I made my way back to the 15. The homes looked like normal, single-story Californian homes, so I didn't think much of them until I noticed the cars in their driveways. Every house had either a red or black car in the driveway, interchanging colors as they did on the highway. I continued without stopping, and I'll admit I drove a little faster than I should have. Each car in the many driveways looked normal for the most part. Some were minivans, trucks, sedans, the usual. And they were all perfectly normal and varied makes. There were only two things that stood out to me upon closer inspection. 1. All the windows on these cars were pitch black with tint, except for the passenger window. And 2, there were no headlights, brake lights, or side mirrors on any of these vehicles.

  
I'm getting really tired now, and the nurse is telling me I should get back to sleep. It's been a long day, to be honest, and I'm having trouble remembering what happened next. If I do remember. I will be sure to post a follow-up with any new information I can muster. My nurse says my head was banged up pretty badly. For now, I just wanted to ask and see if anyone has more information on any strange occurrences driving on the 15? Or any American interstate, for that matter. Feel free to let me know and I hope to be posting again soon. Stay safe everyone!
