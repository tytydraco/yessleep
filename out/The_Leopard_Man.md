I know I’m going to sound insane to you, but what has been happening to me has freaked me out for many years. For context, I live in the mountains. The little town that I lived in used to have a road going through it, and forest on either side. We used to get a lot of visitors around autumn because of how pretty our little town looked. 



Autumn was where we got a lot of money for hotels and restaurants. Many townsfolk anticipate autumn, btu something sinister also comes with this season, that affects our little town



The Leopard man 



Some people call him the furry man or fuzzy man, some people call him the polka dot lion, but the most popular name is the Leopard man. Every autumn, he comes through our town, and just stares. He doesn't go in any of the houses, doesn't talk to anyone. Some of the townspeople have said that they have gotten real close to him, and can see that his eyes are bloodshot red.



He breathes heavily and has the odor of death stuck to him. Many townsfolk find him very unsightly, and try to keep the talk of him low so no tourist can hear about him, and keep the economy stable. 



But every year, he comes down the road, walks through the town, and leaves into the forest. I always thought he was harmless, until I had first and final interaction with him. I was about 6, and to be honest, wasn't very helpful to either of my parents. I loved to play outside, and when I couldn't, I threw a huge temper tantrum. I usually played in the front yard with my favorite soccer ball, I absolutely loved that thing. 



But one day, I accidentally kicked it into the forest. I didn't mean to, and I went to ask my parents if I could go get it. They said no and I suggested that me and either my dad or mom go walk into the other side of the street and into the forest to get it, but they still said no.



I was incredibly sad, I cried my eyes out all day, I was a mess when I went to bed, I was still super sad. I couldn't go to sleep, I kept thinking about that, just staring through my window, hoping I could sneak out before my parents could catch me. 



But then he came and stared through the window. The leopard man is a danger and shouldn't be messed with. I freaked and ran to the corner of the room, trying to shield my eyes from him. He gestured that I should open the window, but I was too scared. But then the leopard man held something.



My soccer ball.



It was deflated, but I didn't care. The leopard man had it and I wanted it back. He gestured again that I should open the window, and this time, I did. I cracked it just a little bit( I was still very scared of him) and smelt his foul odor



“Wel well well, I believe this is yours' ' said the Leopard man, holding up the deflated soccer ball. “Yes that's mine, how did you find it?” I said prying the window just a little bit more “Well I have been observing you and I know just how deeply you care about that ball, and when you kicked into the forest and couldn't get it back, I felt sad for you, so I trekked through the forest and found it, and am now giving it back to you.”



“It's ruined, it has a massive hole in it, I can't play with it anymore.” I said looking disappointed “Ah don't be sad, Here, if you come out of the house, me and you can trek to my fixy uppity house, and we can get it fixed in no time” I thought about it, but shook my head “ But you're a stranger, I don't even know who you are, and how do you know where I live?” 



“ Well I work with the tooth fairies, and together we know all the names of the boys and girls around the globe. I know your names William, and I know who your mommy and daddy are. Would I really be a stranger if I knew what your name was?” I thought about it, it was true, strangers don't know the names of small boys and girls, and who their parents were.



“I guess not, '' I said. “See I'm not a stranger, I'm your friend, and friends help each other, and that's what I am trying to do with you. So if you crawl out of the window, Me and you can meet all my friends, and the fairies living in the forest together.” said the Leopard man. I was hooked, I wanted to meet all his friends and I also wanted to get my soccer ball back, so I pried the window  and crawled through it. ONe thing that I didn't notice, was that the Leopard man was large 



He had to be less tall than my dad(H=MY dad is 6 '2) and squeezed my hand so hard that I was afraid he was going to break it. AS we walked, I could tell that he was breathing very hard, and all he talked about was he couldn't wait for me to see his friends at the house. We walked for about a ile through first, until we came through clearing and I saw the house



It looked like it had been abandoned for years. The roof was caving in, the windows were broken and all you could see was darkness. “Is this your house?” I asked “Yes, doesn't it look so fun? '' said the leopard. I didn't think so “I wanna go home, this is scary '' I said, trying to yank my hand from the man. “No, you're not going anywhere now, this is your home forever, and you're going to meet all my wonderful friends' ' The leopard man said. He pulled me into the house, and I smelt something very putrid. I tried to cover mouth and nose from the smell, and I was trying very hard not to cry



Inside the house was much better from the outside appearance. THe floors and walls were decaying. The man led me to the basement, and the smell became absolutely horrible, THe man gripped onto my hand even tighter, and I kept telling him that he was hurting my hand, but he just kept walking down the stairs and breathing hard. When we got to the bottom, all my eyes could make out was there shelfs lining the walls with round things on them. The leopard man told me to sit and he went to turn on the basement light. AS he did he said “ I'm so excited that you can finally see my friends, william!” THe light turned on. 



THe light finally allowed me to see what was in the room, and I screamed, The round things were heads, and they were on every shelf, with labels over them. In the middle of the room, there was a pole with flesh on it, and a pole going horizontal across. It was as if the two poles were making out a cross. I screamed and ran up the stairs. I looked back and I could see a leopard man running behind me, trying to grab onto my clothes and pull me back down. 



I ran out through one of the doors and into the forest. I didn't know where to go so I hid in some brush. I couldn't go to sleep, I was too scared, and All night long, I heard screaming and running. He was trying to get to me, and I tried to hold my crying until the morning. I survived the night, and eventually made it back to my house early in the morning. My parents didn't notice I was out of the house, and frankly, I was too scared to tell them I sneaked out.

 

I told none of my experience, and frankly, I would keep my experience a secret for the rest of my life if it wasn't for a news story. They found the house. Turns out the leopard man was some pedophile creep. He liked messing with kids and cutting off their heads and displaying their heads on shelves as like a sick trophy. He was also insane, and stuck all their organs into a cross, to worship the ‘one who shall live forever’ whatever that means. Overall I'm scared, but I'm bringing this story to you, so no people have to live through hell like I have. Screw that leopard man, and screw whoever was related to him. He can die  in hell for all I care
