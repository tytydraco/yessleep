I am back. It has been a week since the last incident, and the veteran arrived last week. His name is Alex and he is very tall, and has worked with the national park service for at least 20 years. He told me and Jordan  he has wrestled an alligator before. He’s also hunted a bear for 20 miles in the smokie mountains.   
  
I asked him how long he has been out here in Joshua Tree. He told me he has been here for three years. He told us that this isn't really harsh weather and the biggest predator out here is a mountain lion. If someone was to get lost, they could spend days out here being completely fine with the right amount of food and water that they need to survive. But he told us the way people disappear only to be found dead miles and miles away is just so, so strange. He told us he was searching for a senior citizen who was hiking by himself. He wasn't heard from for a couple days and the family came to the Search and rescue workers for help  
  
Alex told us how they would have these dogs that would catch a scent and lead the SAR to a sheer cliff and then lose it. Then the dogs would catch the scent later on again, and lose it again. The only evidence they ever found was the hand of the guy sticking out from one of the branches of a Joshua tree. As if whatever out there got him, was taunting SAR.   
  
He also told us that they would find dead people 30 miles away from where they were last seen. This is impossible because most people would be missing for only a few days. Sometimes SAR would find bones, backpacks, shoes or nothing at all. They would never find the entire body of a missing person.   
  
Now let me tell you the layout of the park. Since we are at the back of the park, there is only about 20 miles of desert, before you get to the back of the park. There's a long wired fence with a sign that says, ‘WARNING, SAR and NATIONAL PARK SERVICE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SAFETY BEYOND THIS FENCE’ , beyond the fence are the large dirt hills.   
  
There are  reasons we don't monitor beyond the fence. There are mines out beyond the fence that are old and unsafe and some mines can go 100 feet underground. If someone steps on the wood on the top of the mine, they can fall and die. There are also caves on the hill that can collapse and kill people. The national park service doesn't want incidents happening and people looking at them with a bad eye, so they don't allow people back there.  
  
But some people do go past the fence. A couple days ago, one lady asked us if we could monitor past the fence. We said no and she said that she saw something strange up on one of the hills. She said, “I went past the fence to get onto the top of one of the mountains to take some pictures. When I got up there I saw this guy about 200 feet away, and started walking over to him, figuring that he got a good view of the sun or the desert. As I got closer to him I noticed that he was not wearing any clothes. He was wearing fur. I just froze, too scared to move. He got closer and I noticed that it was as if someone found mountain lion roadkill and put it on. He was standing up right, the shape of a human, had big ears, and his face was smushed. He had these spots all over him, which were covered with blood, like he got hole-punched or lasered all across his body. He came over to me and was trying to talk to me. The only thing that was coming out of his mouth was blood, muscle and bone. He shook me and the only thing I could comprehend from him was the word ‘RUN’ He noticed that I couldn't understand and ran off down the mountain.”   
  
Alex told us that we need to go find this dude. He could be a crazed individual or a homeless person, and they can get killed. Me and Jordan were freaked out but agreed that we should probably find this and not have any more incidents that involve this guy. We started hiking to the mountain in the morning and got to the hill that the woman described around noon.   
  
As we climbed up the mountain, I started to smell something weird. “You smell that?”, I asked. “Yeah, it smells like death, we need to track it..”, Alex responded. We followed the smell until we got to this hole. Alex shined his light down the hole and saw a tunnel going into the hill. The tunnel was too small for Jordan or Alex to fit into, but I was the only one small enough to squeeze through and travel down the tunnel.   
  
I put my arms in front of me and pushed my way through. The tunnel was tight. About 2-3 feet for the height and I had only about 3 inches to wiggle around and get all my limbs into the tunnel. I started gripping for rocks in front of me. The tunnel was going down. That meant I had to have my feet hooked onto rocks behind and grab onto rocks ahead of me, shifting my way down. I did this because I didn't want to go so fast and slide down the tunnel into a potential embankment and die.   
  
It took me 20 minutes to get through the tunnel. I yelled back saying I was safe, “I am gonna see if I can get through.”, Jordan Yelled at the top. I thought that was a good idea. After all, I didn't have a flashlight and it was pitchdark. After another 20 minutes Jordan finally got to the bottom and turned the flash light on.  
  
I saw sand on the ground and more tunnel to pass through. There was enough room for us to crawl through. The smell of something grew stronger and stronger. I heard Jordan gag and wheeze behind, covering his nose with his shirt. We got to the end of the tunnel and saw an opening.   
   
I stepped through and smelled it. Something died and was rotting in this room. The room trapped all the air in, giving it a horrendous smell. Jordan stepped through and turned the flashlight on. I looked around the room and I saw it. Animal skins everywhere. There's a pile resting neatly on a pile of sand and intestines in the far right of the Corner. Jordan gagged even harder. He turned the flashlight to the ceiling  and I saw writing on it. It was as if someone carved writings on the ceiling with stone, the words looked jagged and rushed. I saw things like ‘They are coming to save us’ and 'Their faces melt in the sun’ ‘they want to be like us’ There was a drawing of a man with no skin and there were words next to it saying, ‘they lied, they want our people so they too can be perfect.’ Huge words on the top of the ceiling said ‘HE SEES ALL, HE KNOWS ALL’   


I looked at Jordan, and he looked at me. It can be seen in his eyes, that he was equally as terrified as I was. I looked around and Jordan walked over to the skins. There was a small hole going down next to the intestines. I tried to take pictures when I heard something coming from the hole. I looked down. It was as if something was crawling in the holes. At first it sounded far away, but it sounded like it was getting closer and closer. It was climbing up.  
  
“Jordan, we need to get out of here!”, as I said that I heard a loud yell from behind me. It came from the hole. I grabbed him and pushed him through the room and into the tunnel. We scraped ourselves badly, but I didn't care, I was too scared to look back. As we rushed upwards, whatever that monster was, was right behind us  
  
I saw the light of the entrance, and I pushed Jordan to go faster. A hand reached through the entrance and pulled Jordan through. I shoved him and we both made it out. Alex was standing there looking at us, “What was that?” he said, picking Jordan up. “I..I don't know what that was.”, I said, getting up. I checked my arms and legs and noticed there were scrapes and bruises. I told him what we saw down there. He said that he didn't care right now, that we needed to go back and clean ourselves up.   
  
As we were walking back to the information building, I saw white writing on the back of Alex’s car. As we got to the information building, I saw Alex freeze. He was looking at the back of the car. I looked and there was a drawing of earth on the back of it. There were words that said ‘Found you!’ in cursive, Alex ran into the informational bathroom and locked himself in. I tried talking to him, telling him to open up the door  
  
The only thing that came from the over side of the door was crying and whispers of “I shouldn't have done this, I had the option to quit, last year. Why was I an idiot and didn't quit last year” and “How did they find me so quickly? The higher ups said it was at least a year before they found me.”, I heard that all night long  
  
I will be getting some rest. It is 1 am and I am pretty tired. I will see if I can get back in 1 or two weeks if I have anything interesting happening. Me and Jordan are very scared, and we have no idea what to do.
