It’s all **her** fault.

That night and the proceeding years were all **her** fault.

The arguments. The shouting. The smashing of plates. My dad’s drinking problem. My mom’s bipolar syndrome. My childhood.

It was all **her** fault – **The Tooth Fairy.**

And she has to pay.

\*\*\*

When I was six, I lost a tooth.

I knocked it out at a football match. I was the goalie and some kid on the other team must have not liked me all that much, as it seemed he was aiming more for my face than the goal itself when he kicked the ball in my direction.

The football hit me smack in the face, causing tears to swell and my nose to block. But since it was a pretty important match, I ignored the burning sensation in my nostrils and carried on. Despite my optimism, we lost anyway.

On the car ride back home after the game, I noticed one of my upper, front teeth felt loose. I used the tip of my tongue to nudge the out of place tooth back and forth within its socket until it began to ache, in which I then told my mom.

“Moooom, my tooth feels weird. And it hurts, as well.” I confided to my mom from the backseat.

“How so, sweetie?” She asked in a sweet tone that was commonplace for her back then.

“It feels all loose.”

She had begun to pull into our homes driveway when she looked back at me with a warm expression. “Oh, then it must be close to falling out. It’s normal for kids your age. You should keep nudging it until it comes out, or I could help you if you’d like.” I nodded my head to her offer of assistance, as I then followed her inside our home.

“What the hell do you mean?! Huh? No, of course not! Why the hell would you think I’d agree to that?” I could hear my dad bellow from his and moms’ room when we entered through the front door, presumably at someone on the other end of a phone.

These tantrums, as I thought them back then, had become frequent in recent days. But my mom had reassured me that dad was just stressed about work, and everything was okay.

“Tom, go to your room and put your headphones on. We’ll sort that tooth out later.” she requested, and I listened.

I raced up the stairs and into my room – passing my parents room along the way, in which I took a quick peek inside of to see my dad perched on the end of the bed with his head in his hands.

After a good few hours later, which I had spent the duration of finishing my homework and listening to tunes on my iPod which I had received for my birthday, my mom stepped into the room holding a ball of string.

“So, what say we fish that tooth out, huh?” she gestured to the ball. “We’ll use this.”

\*\*\*

“Now, it’ll only hurt a little, okay honey?” she reassured me as she stood by the door, in which my wobbly tooth was connected to via a line of string wrapped around the knob.

“Are you sure, mommy?” I asked anxiously.

“Of course, Tom.”

***SLAM***

My mom suddenly slammed the door with all the power she could muster without warning. The line went tout and my tooth was pulled out from my gumline with a wet popping sound as the line then fell loose again and my tooth clattered to the ground.

Droplets of blood trickled down onto my tongue from the now empty socket as I winced in pain. But I didn’t have to worry as the pain didn’t last long, as it soon subsided and the discomfort I had up to that point faded.

My mom wandered over to where my shiny white now laid and picked it up. “See, sweetie, it wasn’t that bad.”

I rubbed my cheek as I explored the vacancy in which my tooth left in its wake with my tongue. “I guess not.”

She sauntered over to where I was sat and crouched down to eye level as she displayed my outcasted denture. “Now, do you know what we do with teeth that fall out of our mouths?” she asked with a grin on her face.

I gave the question a short thought before answering. “We bin it?”

She chuckled. “Sometimes, sure. But other times, what you do is you leave the tooth under your pillow.”

“But… Why?”

“For the Tooth Fairy, of course.”

The Tooth Fairy.

Up until that point in my life, I had never heard of the name. I’d heard of Santa Claus of course, and the Easter Bunny, hell I’d even heard of Mothman. But never the Tooth Fairy. I guess there was no point in mentioning the fairy up until that point, as I’d never lost of tooth of mines until then.

She continued. “When you leave a tooth under your pillow, the Tooth Fairy comes along and collects it. And in return, she leaves you some money. Isn’t that cool?”

My eyes lit up upon hearing that. “Really? Do you think she’ll leave £20? If she did, I could buy that toy I keep telling you about!”

A weak smile grew across her face as her gaze fell to the ground, as if a shiny penny laid there. “Yeah…Yeah, maybe.” she replied weakly.

\*\*\*

I rested my head on a comfortable pillow as I laid in bed and pulled my Cars movie duvet over me. Outside in the stairway, I could faintly hear my parents exchange words before my dad groggily entered my room.

“Hey, bud, how you feeling? Mom was just telling me about how you had your tooth pulled out a few hours ago, and how you didn’t even cry. Not even a bit. Tough little soldier, aren’t you?”

He said in an exhausted tone as he sat down on my bedside and rubbed my arm. From the light casting on him from my green nightlight, I could make out black circles around his eyes and sweat stains in his arm pit areas on the white office shirt he was wearing. His tie had been loosened and his hair was unkempt.

“Daddy, are you okay? Are you sick?” I asked worryingly.

I hadn’t really seen my dad in those past few days, and judging from the way he looked, I assumed he caught the cold or the flu. Upon speaking those words, he immediately tried his best to better present himself by rubbing his eyelids awake and adding a flair of energy to his voice.

“I’m alright, bud. Just a bit tired, that’s all.” He said, in the best lively tone he could muster up with his strained voice box, which he had tired out from all his shouting.

“Okay…” I said, not entirely convinced, but soon another topic lit up in my head. “Oh, mommy also told me about the Tooth Fairy!”

He looked amused by this, despite it being hard to deduce his emotions by how much his face sagged and his eyes slitted. “Oh yeah?”

I fished out a plastic bag containing my tooth from under my pillow and showed it to him. “Yeah! She told me how the Tooth Fairy stops by and leaves money for those who put their teeth under their pillow! Isn’t that awesome?”

He scruffled my hair playfully. “Heh, that is pretty awesome, bud. Well, let’s hope you wake up with £1 under that pillow in the morning.”

My face dropped upon hearing this. “£1? Mommy said she could leave £20…”

My dad tutted as he lifted himself from my bedside, shaking my mattress in the process. “Well, I doubt the Tooth Fairy is made out of money now. So, just be happy with what you get. Okay, bud?” He said with a tinge of irritation, but with a sort of sad glint in his eyes.

I nodded my head in response. I was devastated in that moment that I’d probably not get as much as I had hoped for, but I didn’t let it show on my face. Before leaving, he took one look back at me.

“I love you. Goodnight.” before he shut the door and left me in my sheets, illuminated by fluorescent green.

Awaiting the Tooth Fairy.

\*\*\*

***Pitter-patter***

My door creaked open as that sound tip toed its way into my room.

It was 3:44 AM at that time. Far past my bedtime, but the anticipation of the Tooth Fairy had gripped me so hard that it kept me alert up until then. The footsteps pattered to my bedside as I clenched my eyes shut and let out my best fake snoring sounds. She must have bought it, as I soon felt a hand delicately slide underneath my pillow.

The hand retrieved the plastic bag which contained my denture then retreated from under my cushion, then after a short while, it returned with the crinkle of paper as it slid something flat underneath my cushion. Then, the pitter-pattering exited my room.

***Pitter-patter***

Even then, I refused to open my eyes or even move until I was sure she was long gone. Once I had waited a few minutes and opened my eyes to find her nowhere in the room, I flipped excitedly onto my stomach and shot my hand under my pillow.

And there I found it – My precious twenty.

My one-way ticket to claiming the toy that would get me all the attention on the playground next week at school. I practically jumped with joy out of my bed as I ran to my parent’s room to display the gift the Tooth Fairy had left me.

“Mom! Dad! The Tooth Fairy came!” I shouted into the darkness of the room. With the pull of a light switch, my parents room lit up with the bright hue of a lamp.

My dad leaned up, coming to his senses as he blinked away slumber. “Huh?”

I presented the note to him as I lifted it above my head. “See? She left £20 for me!”

My mom, who had leaned up in bed alongside dad, became pale as her eyes went wide. My dad turned beet red as he shifted to meet my mom’s gaze. “Care to explain to me what the fuck that’s about?”

“I-I don’t know!” she looked dumbfounded as to what I held between my index finger and thumb.

He replied in a louder volume. “Oh, don’t play dumb with me, Sarah! I’m fucking sick and tired of people playing me for a fucking fool in and out of this house!”

“I’m being honest, Nicholas! Now stop shouting and calm down!”

“Calm down? Calm down?! I told you not to fucking give him more than £1, goddamnit!”

“And I didn’t! I… I don’t know where that came from!”

I just stood there, watching my parents engage in verbal combat, utilising words I had never even heard of before back then. I felt my eyes grow watery and my mouth become dry as I viewed their argument steadily grow into a full-blown war.

The fight transitioned from the bedroom, to the stairway, then to the kitchen. All the while, the topic of which they were arguing over morphed to completely unrelated subjects. Such as mom being unemployed, my dad going out drinking at the weekends, my mom’s overspending and my dad’s job.

That last topic really struck a nerve in my dad and sent him spiralling into a blind rage as he got in moms face and shoved her. In retaliation, she opened the cupboards and began hurling plates at him, most of which missed, although a few did graze him. At that point, my snivelling had turned into full-scale bawling as my parents shifted into complete strangers before my very own eyes.

The fight only began to quell once the neighbours were over knocking on the door, awoken by the screaming match next-door and concerned whether domestic abuse was taking place. The memory of that night begins to blur after that.

I remember blue and red lights casting through the blinds as my dad stood at the front door relaying his side of events to the authorities, as my mom sat slouched against a couch sobbing to herself.

What I can’t forget, no matter how hard I try, Is what my mom said to me as I tried my best to comfort her. She looked me dead in the eyes, hers red and veiny from crying, and said with immiscible distain in her voice.

“This is all your fault, Tom.”

I slept at my grandparents’ house that night.

\*\*\*

It’s been twenty-one years since that night. Things never got better, In fact, they got worse.

Not long after the big fight, my mom and dad filed for divorce as their relationship had received a wound it couldn’t heal from. There was a custody battle, in which my mom won, and soon dad had moved out. We weren’t far behind him though, as soon it was me and my mom who were packing up and leaving as she couldn’t keep up with the rent and electricity bills.

We moved downtown to some crummy apartment which had cheap rent, and my mum had to balance multiple jobs as the child support my dad was paying wasn’t enough to sustain us. During those dark times, I fell into a deep depression due to multiple factors.

Firstly was the fact that, whenever I visited my dad on the weekends, he was never sober.

I learned at some point that my dad was in the process of losing his job in the days prior to the fight, and that night was really the nail in the coffin for his only source of income. He had similarly moved to a shitty apartment like us, although it was far worse than me and moms.

The stench of alcohol and rot would attack your nostrils when you entered, and the state in which the kitchen would be left in was stomach churning to view. The mice didn’t help, either.

My dad had completely given up on life. I always found him slouched on the couch, chugging away at an eight-pack of beer as he watched cable. He hadn’t been able to acquire a job after his last one’s termination, although it seemed more like he had just chosen not to pursue another one as he found the answer to all his problems at the bottom of a can.

If he ever did manage to get his hands on money, he would be forced to put most of it towards child support and rent, and the remaining would usually just go to his alcohol addiction. I usually spent most of my time while “visiting” him exploring the shopping centre nearby as he drunkenly snoozed.

Secondly was how my mom treated me.

She was never the same to me after that night. She had lost her peaceful and jovial personality, and instead it was replaced with a cold and dismissive one. I never really saw her much as she was usually out working, and when I did, she never looked me in the eyes and only responded with “okay” and “uh-huh”.

Then at some point, she contracted bipolar syndrome. Supposedly, she inherited it from her mom. She would go from being silent as a mouse, to shouting and crying in a matter of seconds. I remember being scared and confused each time it happened. At some point, any chance of reviving our relationship was dead in the water. And by the time I moved out, my mom was completely unrecognisable from my childhood view of her.

I haven’t visited my dad in years and I bi-weekly receive a call from my mom to check up on me, although it seems to be more of a chore for her judging by the dismissiveness ever in her tone.

And thirdly, there was the Tooth Fairy.

The vile, filthy pixie that fluttered into our home that night and destroyed my family with a single note. Who was the catalyst to my depressing teen years, and who fluttered away without a care or worry on her mind. Who I spent each night praying to, for her to come back and fix everything, but she never did.

She just left, all without a single consequence.

Unless I have anything to say about it.

As you see, I’ve been planning for years. And last week, I purposefully knocked a tooth of mine out.

Tonight, I will place that tooth under my pillow.

Tonight, I will enact a revenge twenty-one years in the making.

Tonight, the Tooth Fairy burns.

\*\*\*

I watched from my childhood homes balcony, as the sun took its last breath before submerging itself within the horizon.

It took a lot of hard work and corner cutting to finally purchase the residence in which I spent six years of my childhood living in, but It had been worth it. If there was any place I was going to do what I was going to do, it was here.

I took a breath of the fresh Autumn air, to ease my rapidly beating heart as I reassured myself that tonight was going to be the night I avenge my six-year-old self, once and for all. I turned around and headed back into the house, turning my back on the sky as it was drained of all its colour and a blanket of night covered the land.

I entered my old childhood bedroom, which I had fitted with familiar furniture such as a child’s bed and nightstand. I then stuffed multiple pillows and a wig underneath my bed’s duvet - in a way that shaped the form of a young boy - then hung up a nightlight before crawling myself into a nearby closet and shutting it behind me. It was **12:03 PM** at that time, so it was going to be a long wait.

I waited for what felt like years as I anticipated the Tooth Fairy’s appearance. I remember it took the Tooth Fairy approximately one minute to retrieve and replace my tooth with its chump change.

And halfway through that minute, I would strike.

Checking the digital watch that rested on my wrist, it told me that it was exactly **3:44 AM** \- the same time in which the Tooth Fairy came for my tooth back when I was six.

I clenched the plastic bottle which contained the first surprise of many I had for the fairy, as I prepared for her silhouette to glide pass the closets shutters. But no such form appeared. Checking my watch again, it now stated that it was **3:48 AM**.

*No. No that can’t be right. She should be here by now. She’s supposed to be here. What’s taking her so long?* I contemplated in that moment.

The Tooth Fairy.

Over the years, I’d long grown pass such childish beliefs like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, and even the belief in cryptids such as Mothman. But the Tooth Fairy was the singular entity that I whole heartedly believed in. She **was** in my room that night, she **was** the one that left that £20, she **was** the fault behind my family’s collapse.

But, as the time ticked by and it soon became **5:23 AM**, with still no sight of the Tooth Fairy, my faith began to crumble inside that narrow closet. Despite how hard I tried to desperately hold onto it, it began to slip from my mind’s grip.

The Tooth Fairy had to be real, because if she wasn’t, why did my family fall apart? Who would take the blame for its deconstruction if not her? Why did I lose my parents if she had nothing to do with it?

*Why?*

My heart beat hard against my ribcage as breaths exhaled from my mouth in panicked hordes. My body went haywire from a spill of emotional thoughts\*. If she hadn’t been there, then who? Who left that money?\* Then it came to me.

My mom.

She was the one that left that £20, she must’ve been.

It made the most sense, despite how much I sought a discrepancy within my own memories. The realisation I’d been living a fantasy crafted by poor conditions and unfortunate events broke me. My entire life, I’d been hating an imaginary entity, an extremely childish one at that. I denied the obvious truth, shielding myself from reality as to not feel its cold embrace and honest whispers, but my shield had now withered, and reality penetrated through my defences.

I felt tears arise as my mouth became parched - just like that night. That awful night. I was six again, hiding in a closet, awaiting a fairy.

I reached my hand out to open the shutters of the closet I laid in, to wake myself up from this dream I’ve been living,

When I heard it.

***Pitter-patter***

My limbs locked in place as fear curled around my spine like a venomous snake. I felt the colour leak from my face as any other strong emotion I was feeling during that moment was instantly replaced with pure and utter dread.

My thoughts raced in that period of confusion and terror. *An intruder? My mind playing tricks on me? Or could it really be…*

Whatever was making this sound was slowly making its way through the deathly silent house. The pattering sound made its way from the kitchen, to the stairway, then soon - just outside my room.

***Pitter-patter***

The door to the room wheezed open as I redrew as far as I could to the back of the closet. The pattering slowly made its way across the room to my bed, and soon, the source of it was within my view. Most of it, at least. And what I was looking at was far from the traditional illustrations of the Tooth Fairy, if it even **was** the Tooth Fairy.

It was abnormally lanky and skinny. The blueish-pale skin on its leg, arms and stomach stretched and strained with wrinkles like elongated bubble-gum, so much so I could even see the muscles underneath, that looked to be as devoid of red as the rest of its body.

It wore blue slippers with puffy, white balls on the toe end, alongside creased braies that wrapped uncomfortably around its thin waistline. It wore no shirt, displaying its sunken stomach and visible ribs in all their blue, elastic malnutritional glory.

I couldn’t see its face, as the closet didn’t reach the roof and the night light didn’t illuminate that high. It tiptoed its way to the bedside, and thankfully my prayers were answered as it once again fell for a ruse of mine. It lifted its unnaturally elongated arms, which nearly reached the floor while it had been tip-toeing, and slid its thin hand underneath the pillow.

While it delicately searched underneath my pillow, I carefully took hold of the bottle and a box of matches. I was shaking and felt a chill rise up my spine, as I softly slid the shutter doors to the closet open. This hadn’t been the Tooth Fairy I had expected, but it was nonetheless the Tooth Fairy, and I knew I had to go through with my plan.

Eventually, it pulled out and grasped my tooth between its crooked fingers, lifted the denture high above itself, and presumably dropped it into its mouth. From behind, I still couldn’t make out its head, as I silently approached it.

A gurgling sound began to rumble from within its insides, as it seemed to be waiting for something. This was my moment to strike, as I unlatched the lid of the bottle. But it heard the crinkle of the plastic, as it spun around, and I was given a good look at what I had not originally seen.

The reason I couldn’t make out its head earlier, was due to the fact It lacked one. In the place of its head – was a hand. It bared no visible eyes or mouth, just a wrinkled palm as its face. The skinny fingers of its “head” spread out, the webbing in between them stretching to impossible limits, as it acknowledged my presence with evident hostility.

I also noticed in this moment something dispensing from out of its belly button like a receipt – a Twenty.

I froze in that moment, constricted by the boundaries of my mind as I tried to comprehend this incomprehensible creature. It retreated backwards, bumping into my nightstand, as the palm which acted as its face, began to morph.

The lines on the palm began to blossom in a way, as they spilt open and shifted to reveal rows - rows and rows and rows of endless, contorting teeth filling the fleshy interior of its impossibly deep maw. Each of them were in a different state of decay, however I noticed the ones near the front were fairly fresh.

It was as if I was looking into a biological meat grinder.

Its neck extended, its agape palm reaching out to meet my face with clear intentions. Fortunately, I managed to break free from my trance and hastily squirted the liquid within the plastic bottle into the creature’s mouth.

It recoiled backwards, the taste being unbearable as it gurgled and coughed. I continued to spray its entire form until nothing was left inside the bottle, in which I then took out a match from the box of matches. I hastily scraped it against the matchbox, lighting it instantly, and took one more look at the creature.

Before I set it ablaze.

It was instantly engulfed in flames and let out a wretched shriek as it squirmed and weaved around the room, catching fire to curtains and blankets. I took a step back. It would’ve been wise to leave the house at that moment, but something about witnessing the creature in which I’ve despised for so long be in such agonising pain brought me a strange sense of solace.

It tried its best to escape through the window, but no matter how hard it tried to break it, it was in far too much agony to really put any force into its attempts. The fire was nearly reaching me at that point as smoke began to fill the air. But I couldn’t leave yet, I had to make sure it burned.

It stumbled to the middle of the room, and in some final desperate attempt to escape, grew blue skin-sagging wings from its back - akin to that of a butterfly. It flapped the fleshy, detailed wings up and down, but the flames had quickly caught on to them too, and soon the inferno claimed the Tooth Fairy as I saw its charred, black body crumple to the ground.

Immolated.

But I had no time to celebrate. I could feel the floor beneath me begin to crumple and cave in, and if I wasn’t quick, I would also join the Tooth Fairy in its fate. I spun around and raced down the stairs, smoke drowning my lungs as I coughed out ash. Thankfully, I made it out just in time as the entire house soon caught flames and collapsed.

In hindsight, perhaps immolation wasn’t the best route to take in disposing of the Tooth Fairy. The house was always going to be a casualty if I was to douse a large section of it in gasoline (which I did), but I suppose I just overlooked that factor in my blind desire for revenge.

But as smoke and ashes bellowed from the remains of the house, and the sun came back up for air as the hills brightened once more - I knew I hadn’t fully rid myself of the Tooth Fairy. There was still a long, painstaking process I had to go through to truly bury it.

And there was no better time than now to begin that process.

I slipped my phone out of my coat pocket, dialled a number I had come to find bittersweet, and let it ring as neighbours began to exit their houses and sirens wailed in the distance.

The person on the other end soon answered.

“Hello?”

“Hi, mom. Can we talk?”
