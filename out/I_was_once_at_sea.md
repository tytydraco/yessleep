There is something at the bottom of the sea... and it let me go

I don't expect you to believe me. I just need someone to listen to this.

I am a crew member of a fishing boat. I have spent years on the high seas, facing storms, hunger, isolation. I thought I had already seen everything. But what happened to me on the last outing continues to haunt me, and every time I close my eyes, I hear the sea... and I feel it there.

We were finishing a six-month journey. The work was hard, but productive. We fill the holds with fish, blubber, whale sperm (yes, although it may sound strange, it is used for expensive cosmetics). The crew was happy. That night we celebrated. I left the cabin for a moment to get some air, and just then it started.

A storm formed out of nowhere. Inky black clouds, the sea roared as if something enormous was moving in its depths. The ship began to creak as if it were going to break.

A wave swept over me like I was an insect. I went flying overboard. I fell into the water. Dark. Cold. Infinite.

I struggled to stay afloat. I thought that would be the end of me. But something fell with me: an emergency inflatable boat. I don't know if it was luck or divine intervention, but I held on to him with everything I had left. There was also a knife, some loose boards and a couple of blankets. Nothing else.

I floated in the dark, screaming, hoping someone would see me. Nobody came.

Hours passed... maybe days. I lost track of time. The sun burned me. The nights froze me. Hunger and thirst made me slower every day. I began to use the knife to hunt what little I could find: small fish, distracted birds. But everything was minimal. The sea gives nothing.

And then I felt it.

At first it was like a touch. Something underwater. Then, a wet caress on the leg. And later… a thud, as if something large was swimming just below. I didn't dare look. Something told me that if I did, I would lose my mind. Literally.

My boat, or what was left of it, was destroyed one night. Not because of a wave. For something. I held on to a piece of wood and kept floating. Without hope anymore. I was just asking for forgiveness. I don't know why, but I felt like I was being judged. As if that knew every sin, every mistake, every moment I was cruel or selfish. And believe me… I knew it.

More days passed. I lost weight. I lost strength. I lost faith. But then, floating among debris, I found boxes. Lost cargo. Meal. Tools. Some shelter. I survived a few more days thanks to that. The sea took everything away... and then gave me just what I needed. I don't know if it's out of compassion... or mockery.

And then… he came back.

It was night. The water was so still it was like glass. And suddenly, a shadow under me. It was not a figure... it was an absence of everything. Dark. Immense. Silent.

It caught me.

I felt something wrap around my leg. He pulled me with brutal force. I swallowed water. I fought. I kicked. I screamed without making a sound. I was sinking.

And then... he let go of me.

As if he had tested me. As if he had decided it wasn't the time. Or that it wasn't enough.

Hours later, a commercial ship found me. They raised me. They wrapped me in blankets. They asked me how long I had been there. I didn't know what to say.

The only thing I could say was:
“There is something at the bottom of the sea... and it let me go.”

And that's what torments me the most.

Not that I almost died. Not that it has dragged me to the bottom. But he let me go.

Because if he lets you go, it's for a reason.

And I'm afraid that one day... he'll come back for me.
