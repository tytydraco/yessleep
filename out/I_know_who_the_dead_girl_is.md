Her name is Stephanie, we all called her stepth for short. I say this because recently on the news they only know her as an unidentified woman, she isn't a woman- she's a girl still, Sixteen. I suppose that's still old enough to be labelled a woman, a young lady at most but she wasn't very mature- she always seemed so immature and at first it would drive me up the wall.

Sorry.

I'm rambling, i don't quite know what to say. I wasn't ever supposed to speak a word of this but technically i'm not talking, right? They never said anything about texting. Right now i'm in my bedroom, i can hear my parents downstairs mumbling about something but that's not important right now- you don't need to know anything about me, this is about Stephanie- Stephanie Young, ironic. I don't know how to say this, well type it. Stephanie is dead, obviously. It feels morbid to say that, to say that's she's actually dead- like gone forever not coming back, never ever. God. This is so fucked, this is so fucking fucked. 

Stephanie- Steph, quickly became one of my best friends. She was effortlessly cool in a way that grinded me down into an envious spiteful little shit, which she put up with- i never got to ask why, i didn't have enough time. That's a lie, i did. I could have just stopped her getting into that car, pulled her aside and asked:

"Stephanie, what is your deal?"

But knowing her she'd reply with something stupid like:

"Two for one."

It made me crack a smile even now and it wasn't even her joke. She had this weird energy about her, this energy that sucked you in and left you wanting more. It was almost addictive, it was addictive. I wanted her with me all the time, and she was. Well, we began to drift a few weeks before she died- three weeks, exactly three weeks before she died. I keep saying it, died- dead, gone, Stephanie is dead- i think i'm trying to nail it into my head that she's, oh my god. God she didn't deserve any of this shit.  

I don't know what to do, i don't know if i can live with it, live with the fact that i'm the reason she's dead, gone, i'm the reason Stephanie's dead. I live right down the street to her parents, a nice couple- quirky but nice, everytime i pass by them i want to turn around and yell

"Your daughter isn't missing, your daughter isn't coming home. Your daughters dead, Stephanie, Stephanie Young is dead and i wish you stopped looking, i wish you stopped asking where she is and put two to two together. I wish that next time you see me that you can tell, you can tell that i murdered your daughter and bash my head into the pavement because it's what i deserve"

I don't know what to do, maybe i'll confess? Ruin my parents lives and make them the sick fucks that raised a killer because it's always the parents fault, never the man that raised the knife or in this case, the girl that pointed the finger. I'm a selfish prick, i need to go. I can't do this, they'll kill me next if they even knew what i was talking about.

But i couldn't let her stay nameless, because when she was still here- you knew her name as soon as you saw her, but now that she's gone- dead, brutalised, you can't even tell her fucking eye colour.
