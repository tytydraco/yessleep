Have you ever heard of Henny-Penny? I bet you haven't, maybe not by that name. However, I do think you have heard the story. It's a Scottish folktale about a hen, named Henny-Penny, that believes the sky is falling down. The folktale goes that each animal Henny-Penny encounters, believes her about the imminent disaster, until a fox tricks them all into entering its den and eats them. There are many tales about this exact phenomena, mass hysteria and the fear of cataclysmic disaster, and in each the disaster never truly arrives. I suppose that's why I felt safe going to Harrisville.

For context, I work as a researcher at UCLA. Specifically I study the psychology behind eschatology. That being the expectation of extinction or the end of the world. Most commonly, this has my research centering around incidents of mass hysteria or would-be prophets predicting the end times. And every time they are wrong, the world keeps on ticking away and the next whack-job comes around with a new deadline on humanity. So when I heard about what was going on in Harrisville, New Hampshire I was intrigued.

I had never heard of Harrisville before, there wasn't anything particularly special about it. However, for the last couple weeks, every single person in the town of Harrisville had developed the belief that the world was ending. And that was an impressive number. 948 people all suddenly struck by the certainty that the world they knew was no longer going to exist. So I took the next flight and flew across the country to get some research done in the field.

I arrived at the nearest airport, rented a car, and secured a space to stay on my phone by the end mid-afternoon. When I arrived in town, I could tell that what I had heard was true, and perhaps would lead to more interesting data than I originally thought. Despite the belief that everyone was going to die, the town was bustling with people. You would have thought it was a normal afternoon at first glance, with people walking dogs and going on afternoon jogs.

However, it was easy to see how the belief had affected the town. The word 'Dovrefjell' was been painted all throughout the town. Alongside this, images of meteors bringing hellfire to the ground were painted along the roads and sides of houses. The strangest decorations were the statues, made of wood, stone, and paper mache, hands outstretched towards the sky. They were spread across the entire town, prostrating themselves upwards in what I believe was acceptance.

When I finally arrived at the house I had rented, I noticed the community church located across the street. It was a small white chapel that had seemingly been in the town for as long as it had existed, however it had now been retrofitted. Instead of a cross adoring the front door, there was now a stylized meteor, surrounded by flames as it plummeted downwards. I was a pretty standard case, most of these apocalyptic situations revolved around some religious belief. Yet, I did not recognize the iconography and from what I could tell, Harrisville had not been a cult community before.

The next day, I set out to conduct my research. I interviewed the townspeople, who solemnly told me about the upcoming disaster, which they referred to as 'Dovrefjell'. Over the course of my interviews, I started to discern the facts about what was going. Every single person in the town had come to the inevitable conclusion 17 days prior after hearing about their disastrous fate from another person. After hearing this news they would then begin to spread the news of the 'Dovrefjell' to others. Another fact was that none of the townspeople had any desire to escape the town. Strangely, they accepted their fate, stating that it was useless to try and flee. How do you escape the end of the world?

With this knowledge, I decided to try and source the origin of the hysteria. There must have been a beginning and I intended to find it. This was a more difficult endeavor than I had originally believed. Paradoxically, the path of the rumor seemed to loop in some sections of the town, with people having heard from somebody that would later down the chain be told by someone they had told themselves. This annoyed me, but I attributed it to them misremembering. The first townsperson I could attribute the belief to was a post office worker by the name of Lyndsey Hurrell.

She was fairly normal before 17 days prior, having been raised a devout catholic up until the sudden change in the previous two weeks. She was now a devout believer in something known as the Dovrefjell. She believed that the Dovrefjell was not so much a god, but a sentient disaster itself. Not death, but the inevitable end. When I asked Lyndsey about when she realized the Dovrefjell was coming, she directed me towards the church once again.

Apparently, a man by the name of Gabriel Montgomery had arrived in town 17 days ago and had told some of the people about the upcoming disaster, where it spiraled into the current situation. Gabriel had been taking up residence in the community church ever since, answering questions when people asked. This was an interesting development and I immediately went to find him.

When I arrived at the church, it took a few minutes of knocking before a young man answered the door. When I asked who he was, he introduced himself as Gabriel Montgomery. I was surprised by this, he seemed normal. He was handsome, but he didn't seem crazy like a doomsday cultist. In my stunned silence, he invited me inside and I accepted.

He was very polite, offering me some tea which I also accepted. When I questioned him about the supposed prophecy and why he had started telling people about the impending disaster, he looked at me strangely and told me matter-of-factly, "Because it's going to happen tomorrow." When I questioned him about where he had heard the prophecy he shrugged me off saying it was just something he knew. Gabriel expressed that he wasn't a cult-leader. That would imply he was looking for religious devotion. He was simply telling the townspeople about the impending doom that was coming for them. I still remember what he said "The end will arrive, it can be tomorrow or 80 years from now, but it will arrive nonetheless. It is the natural conclusion so ."

With that, he ushered me out of the church and directed me to see for myself what happened tomorrow and question him then. So I went across the street to the house I was staying in and decided to turn in for the night. It was hard to get to sleep, I knew that every doomsday cult honestly believed in their apocalypse but I somehow felt that this was different. 

It was just as I was falling asleep when I heard the commotion outside the bedroom window. When I looked outside, I saw what seemed to be the entire town filing into the small church. All of them were crying. They crammed themselves into the small building, climbing over each other to try and get inside. I don't know how they were all fitting inside, but that didn't stop them. It was as I watched this that I saw Gabriel standing next to the door, holding it open. He smiled and waved me to come over, but I felt what the townspeople were feeling. I knew that if I went into that building, I would die.

I quickly rushed outside to the rental car and drove to the next town over. I watched outside my window the entire night to make sure none of them had followed me. I didn't see or hear a single thing in that dark night. I watched the sky most of all though. And I swore I could see the sky opening up, getting darker above the far off town. I left the motel room when I was certain the sun had risen.

The next day I headed back towards Harrisville intending to quickly retrieve my belongings and head back to California. When I arrived at the outskirts of the town though, I found that the road simply ended at a crater. Police had blocked the way, but I could still see past. Harrisville wasn't a small town, and the crater was not large either. Over the night, a meteor had apparently crashed into the town and there had been no survivors. All 948 residents of the town had apparently been wiped out in their sleep by the explosive impact while they were sleeping in their beds. There was nothing to even signify a town had been there. Every building and house had been destroyed by the meteor, including the supposed meteor itself. Despite all of the evidence, there were no remnants of the meteor inside the crater.

So I took the next flight back to UCLA to try and document my account. The paper I published ended up doing well and my peers in the field of eschatology gave me accolades for my research. News stations around the country even invited me on to talk. A tragedy with 948 victims was mainstream news for a while but they found another topic quickly. Then I tried to forget about what happened myself. Studying the next would-be apocalypse.

I write this now though, because I know that what happened in Harrisville was not normal. Even if it was a coincidence that the tragedy happened that day, I know that something else occurred. I never heard or saw a meteor all through the night. Most importantly, I know Gabriel Montgomery had something to do with it. I've calculated where the meteor should have hit based on satellite photos. The point of impact would have been the church they all piled into. After doing further research the only Dovrefjell I could find reference to was a mountain range in Norway that seemed unrelated. Still, I believe that what happened in Harrisville wasn't a coincidence, that Gabriel Montgomery knew something. I suppose all of those stories about the sky falling down and imminent disaster are true, the disaster does come in the end.
