So I had one of the strangest and horrifying things happen to me at a small and sketchy flea market and this is what happened. We were traveling on a road trip to Michigan stopping at flea markets on the way there. 



We stopped at one of our family favorite flea markets. I'm not gonna give out information because of safety but they were unfortunately going out of business when we arrived and when we did it was empty except for 1 rough looking fellow and we kindly asked him is this place closed? And The man I believe said something like yes there working on getting the rest of the old stuff out of the market and are gonna permanently close. 




We then asked him are there any other flea markets in this area? And he said yes there is a really good one about 8 or so miles from here he said on a back dirt road but don't let it skeive you out If you do you will regret it as he gave us a strange look. We said what the heck we will go and asked for directions as he gave us another strange almost eerie look.




He gave us the name of the place. We looked it up and found nothing about it on Google except for a yellow page listing listing it as a flea market you will never forget in the description. Anyways we followed the directions and we ended up in the middle of nowhere on a back dirt road and finally found it though. It was a very sketchy place but we started shopping lol. 




They ended up having some pretty cool stuff gotta admit the guy was right Im glad I came here. as I was walking by a vendor lady that had skin of like paper.anyways I shrugged it off as she had creepy sundries and knick knacks. I thought maybe she sells creepy art or something. I picked up a vhs and asked her how much and bought it because I collect vhs tapes and dvds. Anyways we were just gonna move on but my sister wanted to go back to that market on our way back because they had anime stuff she liked.



On our 2nd visit we tried to find the lady that sold us the tape but couldn't find her. so we asked him if he knew the lady and he said yes I definitely know her. We asked him what does that mean? He said she is a stocker and does bad things don't go near her trust me.



3 weeks later we got home but that night  we saw a dark figure across the street from our house. My dad went out there and saw it was the lady. I am going to end it there but at the end of the day be careful who you approach. And I do have a picture of the vendor lady but I can't post it here.




Once we arrived in michigan I used my grandmas vhs player let the tape play. It had some well weird pictures of various dark figures. It was definitely a horrifying tape anyways at the end of the tape it was a recording of the vendor lady looking at the camera saying come back and I will give you a bargain and then ended. At first it freaked us out but then we laughed at the situation lol.
