My name is Michael, and I’ve always been fascinated by space. When I was a kid, I lived in the countryside, where the night sky was full of stars and planets. I used to sneak out of my house, while my parents were arguing, and meet up with my friends. We would drink and smoke, but I was more interested in looking at the sky. I wondered what was out there, what it all meant. I felt a strange uneasiness, as if something was watching us from above.  
  
As I grew up, I changed my habits. I stopped sneaking out and started studying hard. I wanted to achieve my dream of becoming an astronaut. My friends drifted away, but I didn’t care. I went to university and studied everything related to space: engineering, biology, physics, math. I made a new friend, Josh, who shared my passion and curiosity. He was also very brave. He once fought off two muggers who attacked us on our way home from a bar. He told me stories about his childhood adventures in the forest, where he had built a “secret compound”. His parents were too busy to notice him, so he learned to be independent and fearless.  
  
We both applied to NASA and got accepted. We became astronauts, something we had dreamed of since we were kids. We trained hard for the unknown. We were ready for anything.  
  
We were chosen to be part of the first mission to Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons. It was a frozen world, with a hidden ocean beneath the ice. We hoped to find signs of life there.  
  
We were five in total: me, Josh, Casey, Adrian and Rick. Casey was a brilliant scientist who volunteered to join us. Adrian was a tough guy who worked out every day and never showed any weakness. Rick was a bit of a wimp, but he had enough courage to sign up for this mission.  
  
We were excited and nervous as we boarded the ship.  
Adrian was a warrior. He trained every day, jogging at dawn, hitting the gym at midday, and stretching for hours. He studied hard, too. I admired his discipline and determination. He seemed fearless, just like Josh. Rick, on the other hand, was more timid. But he still had enough guts to join us on this mission.  
  
We said goodbye to our friends on Earth and boarded the ship. We knew it would be a long journey, a tedious one. We tried to entertain ourselves with stories and games, but we soon got bored. We spent most of our time monitoring the ship and sleeping.  
  
Finally, we arrived at Europa. The icy moon was right in front of us. We couldn’t believe it. We were thrilled. We wondered what we would find there. Maybe life?  
  
Our mission was to collect samples from the ice and the water. We landed on a smooth surface and got out of the ship. It was freezing cold, but we had warm suits. It was also slippery, but we had boots. It was a stunning sight. We could see Earth, the Sun and the Moon in the sky.  
  
We had to make the most of our time there. We all got off the ship, except for Adrian. He stayed inside. I felt a chill down my spine when I saw him. He looked scared. His face was pale and his eyes were wide. He wouldn’t talk to us or move.  
  
What was wrong with him?  
  
He suddenly snapped out of it and came out of the ship.  
  
“What the hell happened, Adrian?” I asked.  
  
“What are you talking about?” he said.  
  
We thought he was kidding. Maybe he wanted to lighten up the mood.  
  
“Hey man, don’t mess with us! We thought you were dead or something!” Josh said.  
  
“Huh?” he said.  
  
He looked serious. Dead serious. He wasn’t joking.  
  
We shrugged it off as some weird reaction to the atmosphere or something like that. A rare phenomenon.  
  
We set up our camp and started drilling the ice. We went back to the ship to contact our team on Earth.  
We tried to contact our team on Earth, but we only heard static. What the hell? Why wasn’t anyone answering?  
  
I told my crew. “There’s no response.”  
  
“Maybe you’re on the wrong frequency.” Casey suggested.  
  
“I’m not! I checked it ten times. Something’s wrong.” I said.  
  
We all felt a surge of fear. Even Josh and Adrian, who were usually calm and confident, looked nervous. Rick started to whimper and cry. He said we were all going to die. He said something was wrong with this place. We tried to calm him down. We said he was having a panic attack. We said we would figure it out.  
  
We thought of possible explanations. Maybe the cold atmosphere was interfering with the signal. Maybe it would get better when we got closer to Earth.  
  
We hoped so.  
  
We continued our work. We collected samples from the ice and the water. But we found nothing. No life. No bacteria. Nothing.  
  
It was weird. Very weird.  
  
The ice and the water were clear and pure. Too pure.  
  
And then something happened.  
  
Something that shouldn’t have happened.  
  
The ice cracked.  
  
We heard a loud noise, like thunder.  
  
We felt the ground shake, like an earthquake.  
  
“WHAT WAS THAT?” Adrian shouted.  
  
“Everyone, calm down! It’s probably just a natural phenomenon. It happens on Earth too, right?” He tried to reassure us.  
  
But we weren’t reassured.  
  
We were terrified.  
  
Especially Rick.  
  
He screamed: “This is not right! This is not right! First Adrian goes crazy, then we lose contact with Earth, now the ice is breaking? Don’t you see? This place is cursed! We have to get out of here!”  
We all looked at Rick with a mix of annoyance and pity. He was clearly losing his mind, but we couldn’t blame him. This mission was turning out to be a nightmare. We tried to reassure him that everything was under control, that we just had to finish our tasks and get back to the ship. But he wouldn’t listen. He started to scream and run towards the ship, slipping on the ice and falling several times. We called after him, but he ignored us. He reached the ship and slammed the door behind him.  
We were stunned. What was he doing? Did he really think he could leave us behind? We decided to go after him, but before we could move, we heard another loud crack. The ice beneath our feet started to shake and split. We realized we were standing on a thin layer of ice over a deep ocean. We had to get off it before it collapsed.  
We grabbed our equipment and ran towards the ship, hoping Rick would open the door for us. But he didn’t. He locked himself inside and refused to answer our calls. We banged on the door, pleading with him to let us in. But he was silent.  
We were running out of time. The ice was breaking faster and faster. We could see the dark water below us, swirling and bubbling. We had no idea what was in there, but we didn’t want to find out.  
We looked around for another way to get inside the ship. There was a small hatch on the side, but it was locked too. We needed a code to open it. We tried to remember the code, but none of us could. It was something we learned during training, but we never used it.  
We started to panic. We tried random combinations, hoping for a miracle. But nothing worked. The hatch remained closed.  
We were doomed.  
We looked at each other, knowing this was the end. We hugged and said our goodbyes. We thanked each other for being good friends and good teammates.  
We waited for the ice to give way.  
But then, something unexpected happened.  
The hatch opened.  
We couldn’t believe it. Rick had changed his mind. He had saved us.  
We wasted no time. We jumped inside the hatch and closed it behind us.  
We were safe.  
We ran towards the cockpit, where Rick was sitting in the pilot’s seat.  
We expected him to be relieved or happy or apologetic.  
But he wasn’t.  
He was smiling.  
A twisted smile.  
A smile that chilled us to the bone.  
He looked at us and said:  
“Welcome aboard, my friends. I hope you enjoyed your little adventure on Europa.”  
He pressed a button.  
The ship took off.  
But not towards Earth.  
Towards Jupiter  


We were terrified. We didn’t know what Rick was planning to do with us. He had tied us up and locked us in a small room. He said he had a surprise for us. A surprise that would change everything.  
  
We tried to reason with him, to ask him why he was doing this. But he wouldn’t answer. He just laughed and said we would see soon enough.  
  
We wondered if he had gone insane. If he had been infected by something on Europa. If he had been working for someone else all along.  
  
We had so many questions, but no answers.  
  
We felt helpless.  
  
We looked out the window and saw Jupiter getting closer and closer. It was a massive planet, with swirling clouds and storms. It looked beautiful, but also deadly.  
  
We knew we couldn’t survive there.  
  
We knew we had to escape.  
  
But how?  
  
We looked around the room, searching for anything that could help us. Anything that could free us from our bonds.  
  
But there was nothing.  
  
Nothing except a satellite phone.  
  
It was lying on a table, next to a pile of papers and books. Rick must have forgotten about it. Or maybe he left it there on purpose, to taunt us.  
  
We didn’t care.  
  
We had to get it.  
  
We had to call for help.  
  
But it was too far away.  
  
We couldn’t reach it.  
  
We tried to move our chairs, to drag ourselves towards the phone. But they were too heavy. And the ropes were too tight.  
  
We couldn’t move.  
  
We felt hopeless.  
  
But then, something happened.  
  
Something miraculous.  
  
The ship shook.  
  
It shook violently, as if it had hit something. Or something had hit it.  
  
We heard a loud bang, followed by an alarm.  
  
We saw sparks flying from the ceiling and smoke filling the air.  
  
We smelled something burning.  
  
Something was wrong.  
  
Something was very wrong.  
  
Rick must have noticed it too. Because he came running into the room, looking panicked and angry.  
  
He shouted at us:  
  
“What did you do? What did you do?”  
  
He grabbed the phone and checked it. He saw that it was on. That it was transmitting a signal.  
  
He realized what we had done.  
  
He realized we had called for help.  
  
He screamed:  
  
“No! No! No!”  
  
He threw the phone at us, hoping to hit us or break it. But he missed. The phone bounced off the wall and landed on the floor, next to me.  
  
I saw my chance.  
  
I stretched my arm as far as I could, trying to reach the phone. I felt the rope cutting into my skin, but I ignored the pain. I focused on the phone. On the hope it represented.  
  
I touched it with my fingers. I grabbed it with my hand. I brought it close to my mouth.  
  
I spoke into it:  
  
“Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear me? This is Michael, one of the astronauts from the Europa mission. We are in trouble. We are in grave danger. Rick has gone crazy. He has taken us hostage and is flying us towards Jupiter. Please, if you hear this, tell everyone. Tell NASA. Tell our families. Tell anyone who can help us.”  
  
I paused for a moment, hoping for a response. Hoping for a sign that someone was listening.  
  
But there was nothing.  
  
Nothing except static.
