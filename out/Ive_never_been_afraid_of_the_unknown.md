but here, Right now I’m petrified. Even the adrenaline coursing its way through my veins can’t get my body to move. The thing In front of me screams; and it’s the loudest, most agonizing thing I’ve ever heard in my life. If I had to put it into words it sounds like every bit of pain to have ever been experienced. 

“JACOB GET OUT OF THERE!!”, My girlfriend screams; but I could barely hear her over the sound of my eardrums bursting. I try to turn to her but my body isn’t responding. Even the slight sting in my hand has gone numb.

“FUCK!”, I feel myself yell but no sound comes to me. Suddenly all my Mother’s rants about not doing stupid things to impress other people flash through my mind. The thing Infront of me inches closer and I feel the weight of its steps course through my entire body.

“JACO-”, My girlfriend’s screams are muffled; a constant and sharp ringing is all I can hear. I feel its breath condense on my face. By now the thing was within an inch of me. I tightened my muscles until my nails dug into the fresh cut on my hand, shocking my immune system. I felt my legs pound against the ground. My ears popped and my girlfriends screaming invaded my surroundings.

“FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK”, I yelled as I ran through the graveyard. The cool night air kissed my face as blood returned throughout my body. But no matter how fast I ran, the gate appeared further and further away. I ran until my shins cracked and my knees popped; then my legs gave out. Dirt buried itself into my eyes and a rock pounded against my forehead. The world around me was spinning. A cold and slimy hand wrapped itself around my ankle and twisted it; I screamed in pain. “ I’LL NEVER DISRESPECT YOUR LAND AGAIN! I PROMISE! I’M SORRY!”, I pleaded. I dug my nails into the dirt but it’s pull was stronger and I was yanked back so fast I didn’t register my nails being ripped from my fingers. And then everything went black.

……….

“Babe, Come on. You don’t actually have to do this” my girlfriend said.

I opened my eyes, In Front of me stood a familiar short and rusty gate. What the fuck, Was that all a dream? I opened my mouth to ask to leave. “Of Course I do, I ain’t no pussy”, I retorted and hopped over the gate. What the fuck? No! No! No! I held onto the gate, cutting my hand on it’s rusty edge. “Shit!” I muttered under my breath.

“Trespassing on sacred property to prove you’re not a pussy is a very pussy thing to do!” My Girlfriend yelled and I wish I listened.

“SHUT UP AUTUMN”, I yelled, even though she was right.

“Wow…” Autumn said, I could practically hear her crossing her arms. “Oh well, leave it to the big strong man to make his own decisions” she mocked. I stayed silent, again she was right. just then a primal roar echoed through the cemetery; I felt my body freeze up. An impossible creature was standing not even three feet away from me.

“JACOB RUN!!” Autumn screamed. I’ve never been afraid of the unknown, but here, right now, I’m terrified.
