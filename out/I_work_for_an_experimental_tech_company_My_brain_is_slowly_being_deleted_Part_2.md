[Read my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zr3dss/i_work_for_an_experimental_tech_company_somebody/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). It should help you to make sense of what’s happening to me. I think my words are coherent (for now), but I cannot promise to be *consistently* comprehensible. I’m already struggling to remember things. I’m struggling to remember what I’ve said and done. My previous post. Real. Real. I’ve lost my train of thought.

Just bear with me. I’m struggling to form complete sentences. Some of this submission might be garbled nonsense. It will certainly be the last thing that I ever post. I’ve locked myself in my office. I will continue writing until I lose the ability to do so. Then, I will submit whatever post I’ve formulated. Shortly, I’m sure people from upstairs will be on their way to detain me for leaking classified details in my previous post.

It doesn’t matter. When they arrive, I won’t be ‘me’.

I don’t have the time or energy to correct any mistakes that I might make. I need to submit my story whilst I still have control of my body. It is of *vital* importance that I tell you the ghastly discovery I made since I last posted. I have

Mine. Mine. *Mine*. That’s all I needed to tell you. Nothing more. Let’s move onwards.

The looping programme is keeping the digital demon at bay, but this mental *intruder* is brawling much more violently with my mental defences than before. The reset loop is only offering my brain limited clarity. Every time I refresh my mind, the virus quickly resumes its unyielding reign. Before I know it, I

Dozen Minus 1

What was the last thing that happened? Everything is so jumbled in my cluttered mind. I *know* the memories are in there. I’m just going to continue typing. It might come back to me. *How did I finish my previous post*? Let me recall. I went back to my laptop. I started typing. I submitted an account of what happened. Okay, that’s right.

After that, I called Jerry, explaining the terrifying events that had transpired. I asked him for help. He must have sent people down here… I think he did. *No*, wait, I’m on my own. I might not have even called him. I don’t know what’s real.

I suddenly found myself in a lightless void. The office lights fizzled out. I remember that. The emergency lighting returned. Feral fear coursed through my veins. No brain virus could’ve stopped that. I realised I was, once again, back in the virus’ distorted realm.

There was a click. A sharp *clicking* noise. How could such a mundane sound fill me with deep dread? It was as if there were an insect worming its way into each and every crevice of my brain. *Click. Click. Click*. I knew it was back.

The virus.

The doppelgänger.

My uncanny clone slowly, but purposefully, strolled past my office’s frosted window. I could only distinguish a murky silhouette of the sickening spectre that has been haunting me. It glided towards the door. Glided. Glided. Glided. *Evaporated*. Once again, my breathing quickened. My throat felt like arid terrain. My forehead was drenched in sweat. Panic flooded my heart. I thought I might pass out. *Good. That might end it.*

“Not *your* brain,” It whispered. “Mine.”

I think I’ve figured out what

I

The file that Richard installed

My head is a maddening mess of loose threads. It’s untrustworthy. I think I’m starting to forget words. I think. I think. I’m so *scared*. I’ve never known horror quite like this. It’s inescapable. My brain is trying to choose between ‘fight’ or ‘flight’, but it can’t run from itself. I can’t prevail against this technological affliction. The war is waging in my own mind. *How can I defeat my own mind?* I feel the shadow encompassing me. My heart is

My heart *was* pounding. I think the virus made it stop. I am so cold.

I don’t have the time to scroll up and fix that nonsensical rambling. I must post this information. *Time*. There isn’t time. Just let me figure things out. I’m sitting at my desk. I’m writing. I’m on my laptop. I think I’ve been here for a few hours. Maybe a few days. A few years. *Everything in the brain is real*.

No. No. No. No.

I’m so *fucking* terrified. Get this thing out of my head. It’s evil. It’s the Devil. It’s. It’s. It’s

*He watches*.

Twinkling eyes.

It’s my face, but those are *not* my eyes. The doppelgänger is gazing deeply into my very soul. He might not be real, but he’s the truest thing I think I’ve ever seen. He is the *only* truth. He is my mind. He is *me*.

Not much longer.

He is now lurking in the inky corner of my office. Even as I type, I’m not looking at my hands. I’m not looking at the keyboard. I’m not even looking at the screen. I am staring, petrified and teary-eyed, at the ghoulish virus that waits to consume my brain.

What *is* the brain? Is it *me*? Can the person known as ‘Cole Dent’ be reduced to nothing more than a squishy lump of grey matter? What a *direful* thought. The virus is going to extinguish me. I will cease to exist. Even if anybody out there could help, it wouldn’t matter. I have no time.

The worst part of meeting this terrible end is that *I’m smart*. I could have figured this out. I could have beaten the virus. I just needed time.

The emergency lighting has disappeared. Total blackness. I can’t. I can’t. I can’t.

I can’t blink. I can’t move. I can’t do anything but gaze into those piercing, glassy eyes. Glassy. *Glitchy*. I don’t know what word I

It’s finally walking towards me. I can’t write anything else. Time. I have to send whatever I’ve written. Eleven Minus. That’s the company. Is it? No. *Dozen* Minus. Somebody, alert someone. This technology must be destroyed. Dozen Minus. What have I done? This implant technology *mustn’t* ever see the light of day. I fear Richard might have already stolen my research. He must be stopped. This *mustn’t* happen to anyone else.

The virus is

Hideous. *Inhospitable*. Oh, fuck. I can’t. I can’t tell you what I’m seeing. I’m not a religious man, but if the gates of Hell were real…

Fuck. It’s so horrible. It’s so horrible. It’s so horrible. It’s so

It’s so beautiful.
