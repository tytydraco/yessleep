I'm very new to Reddit, like 6 hours new. And well, and truly, I just knew I'd need a place to talk about this. Yet, I didn't think I'd be so pressured to post here so soon. But, as I sit in my room, it hangs over me currently. The tormenting factor of my life.

  
Now, I didn't know how to structure my story, but as I'm here, I'll write it as it happened. 

  
At first, I thought they were statues. Maybe some new animatronic people became fans of, the new and cool fad. Whatever, that's Vienna. More money than you can know what to do with it, hah. 

Strangely though, they did nothing. Nobody else could see them, so I thought I was going crazy, hallucinating. And, as an art major, they were useful. For all it was, having a personal piece of anatomy I could see and encapsulate basically gave me a cheat sheet that followed everywhere I went.   

  
Anyways, I'm dragging on with conceptual sounding words, I do that sometimes. 

  
So, around a year ago, these strange, melted looking people seemed to pop up everywhere. After I'd transferred to Austrian art school from engineering in Bremen. (yes I'm German, yes i got accepted to art school, I am nothing like that though so please refrain from saying anything on the matter). Moved here 2 years ago, and everything was fine. I was pursuing my dreams, becoming an artist, becoming one of the greats. 

So, sorry, back to what happened. A year ago, these waxy women started appearing in every room. Yet, they were deformed. Physically. You know what a molten candle looks like, right? The little drops of wax than drip down the side of the candle's structure. Yeah, the souls legs looked like those, yet, still liquid, kind of. You know that state where the outside of the wax is solid, but the liquid inside can still change the shape of the wax? The dripping effect was applied to the women's legs, their arms melted off to the elbow.

The women's stubby arms would be connected to the molten legs. Well, I wouldn't call them legs- rather they looked like a blob of hardening candle wax, but still!- That's besides the point, they looked wrong. 



I'd see them in every room, but nobody acknowledged them. Maybe I was crazy, but I never bothered to interact with them. They looked... eerie. And something told me I shouldn't. Maybe some primal instinct, the last part of me that told me to keep my distance, something bad. And to this day, I know I should listen to my last bounds. 

  
They've never tried interacting with me, though. All they ever did was twisted into specific positions I needed when drawing female anatomy. Like they read my mind. Quite useful, I might say. 

  
Again, my apologies for my droning on and on, but this has been my life for the past few months. Waking up to seeing the waxy women somewhere in my room, in a corner when I walk out of my bedroom, everywhere. 

  
And that brings me to 3 days ago. I was hanging out with my good friend Henry, the melting woman here today sat just a little closer than normal. Sure, she was still just in my peripheral, but she would've been the next table over. It's a little distracting, sure, there's basically a melting mannequin next to you with falling out, wet hair and no eyes with white skin that looks like something you'd set on fire to release pleasant smells, but I've grown accustom to it. 

This day, in the chilly autumn Viennese café we were seated at, Henry looked distraught. Panicked more than he usually would. I think it's important that you know my best friend is a good artist. A very good artist, and although you may think I'm exaggerating, but he may be better than Monet, Da Vinci and if he chose to, could out-Picasso Picasso himself. A creative mind, unlike any other person I've ever met. 

Truthfully, I look up to him a lot, he truly is should be one of the greats. Anyway, enough of the 'glaze', as we apparently call in nowadays. As we talked, I saw him specifically averting his gaze from the right side of our table, and his cheeks slightly flushed. Not that I expected it to be the molten soul next to us, of course. Nobody else knew about them other than me, it was just me. 

After we finished our chatter- which was around 3 hours, with several times coffee and cakes were ordered- Henry and I finished talking. As we stood up to leave though, Henry walked over to the thing I believed to be a figment of my imagination, and grabbed some of it's more molten wax. The piece grimaced, recoiling from his touch as it started bleeding clear, hot wax. I stood there, appalled. Could he see them to? Could everybody? Had I just witnessed a murder? My best friend looked back at me, with a slightly solemn look, and put a finger to his lips, shushing me.   
"I have a sketchbook I'll give you tomorrow in Human Biology. Don't be late, ok?"   
I nodded, and instinctively took a step back from the wax mess on the floor. The two of us walked out of the cafe quietly, and, nobody seemed to question the drained wax corpse that sat inside that Henry had just killed. Normally we'd've held hands on a walk home like that, but we didn't.

That should've been my first red flag. Yet, as the clueless, naive, little German boy I am at heart, I didn't notice. When I walked into my dorm, I saw the local wax figure, and did nothing. I studied Da Vinci's manuscripts on anatomy, like a normal person, ate dinner, sketched some clothing designs, before I prepped for bed, and went to sleep.

  
The next morning, I went to class, although I wasn't refreshed. I hadn't slept at all, the seen of my friend ever so violently ripping a chunk of flesh- no, wax from the wax woman. I cast a look to the wax woman next to my doorway, slightly closer than usual, but whatever. Maybe they trusted me more now that I hadn't tried to kill them. I went off to my school, not the art school, but university. First class was Human Bio, Henry would give me the sketch book. Yet, as I walked into class, I didn't see him. Not in our usual front and center. He was usually punctual, but hey, I could dismiss it. Just as always.

During the time I was meant to have my study break for the day, I decided to go visit Henry at his home. Sure, he hadn't texted me that he was sick or anything, as he would've, but I had to check on him. Maybe he felt bad for yesterday's murder. Whatever, it's not my job to come up with a reason why he decided to skip a class. 

As I arrived at the apartment block he lived at, I felt a chill run down my spine. Another wax corpse, clear, hot wax gushing out from where the stubs of it's arm would've been. Had he massacred more? 

When I went up to his level, I walked over to his door. Something told me to stop. Anhalt. The small spirit of common sense I had left in me told me something was wrong. Whether it was a test of whether I'd betray my friend's privacy, or maybe something that told me he was murdering spirits, I ignored it. And oh how wrong I was for that. 

As I stepped inside, at first I didn't understand what I'd seen. 5 big, white candles, lit up in a circle surrounding a perspiring Henry. He seemed to be in concentration- then, oh god. Oh goodness, the room was littered with the husks of the wax women. Drained of waxy, warm, liquid insides. Cold. Really, quite the sight. But as you can tell, this is not the end so far. As I looked back at Henry, I saw his brown hair, on the floor. Clumps fraying out by the second, his chest seemed to sag with something. Hips wider, his legs were connected to the floor, like he was molten down. He seemed more feminine, and then I realized, I couldn't see his eyes anymore. Hell, I couldn't see his eyelids, it was like skin had just enveloped them. His skin was white, waxy and see through. 

As I'm sure you could put together a lot faster than I had, Henry was turning into one of the damn women. A man, turning into a woman- now I'm not transphobic, but when your best friend is a man killing people who currently look like him just yesterday, it can be quite alarming. I saw his sketchbook on the counter, ran over, and grabbed it. I felt the wax corpses gazes, although they were dead, trying to tell me to do something. Anything. I grabbed the book, and ran out of the room. And the last thing I heard before I remember finding myself in my dorm again,   
"Run.".   
Possibly the last word I'd ever hear from my best friend ever again. 

When I came back to my senses, I felt overwhelmed by information. I was in my bed, surrounded by pages of notes written in Henry's elaborate -and unreadable- cursive. Words spun around my head, talking about how talented artists always went missing over the past 400 years. All artists that were going well in their careers, hundreds- no, thousands of them. then, Da Vinci's notes. And Monet's, Michelangelo's, and strangely, Hitler's. All mentioning seeing waxy, female women with distorted, melted features their entire lives. Sure, it differed for each artist, Monet said he'd see them whenever he went out in public, whilst Da Vinci said he saw them in any corner he looked. Then Henry's, seeing them in every room. 

  
They scaled to how good the artist was. That's what I realized. And the last one- Adolf's. I dreaded to read it, because well, he's evil. Probably worse than these wax women. I read it in a terrible scrawl a mess. Then, the date. April 30th, 1945. A slight splatter of a dark, oxidised thing I could only recognise as blood from Human Bio. He said he's seen the monstrous, distorted creatures as a child, until he was rejected. And there was one in the bunker, he couldn't take it, apparently.   
Then, I saw it in the corner of the room. The usually blank faced wax woman's face was contorted into a smile. The gut wrenching truth.

  
That was a fellow artist. This plague- it had taken my best friend. The woman's stringy, black hair hung over her face. It reminded me of a movie. Except, it was only if I touched them, right? With that, I pulled the blankets over me, hugging the sketchbook. Until I read the top sentence on the paper. 

"they can come closer.".
