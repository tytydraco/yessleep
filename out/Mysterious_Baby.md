I was sitting in my garden sipping a cup of coffee when I saw a flash of light in the dark sky and heard a loud noise. I went to check what happened since nobody seemed to notice the noise.

I reached the area and a large chunk of forest was cleansed. There was nothing to be found but then I heard a noise from somewhere. I looked around and saw a baby in a basket behind the bushes.

I picked up the child and tried looking for his parents and called out  “There is a baby. Is there someone who can hear me? If guardians of a missing child can hear me, then your baby is here. ”

There was nobody to be found. I waited for a few minutes before anybody came but there was only disappointment.
After picking up the baby I started walking away to my home. It had the most innocent smile on his face or at least what I thought.

The baby was a boy. I bathed the baby in water and put it into a comfortable wool towel. When I was going to throw out the dirty water after I used it for baiting the baby I noticed it had a strange purplish colour. I thought of calling the cops the next morning.

I called the cops about a missing baby. They arrived this morning to investigate the child. 

When the police arrived I told them the whole story and was going to handle the baby but to my surprise, the baby was too small to be found. They searched around the house, in the woods and everywhere else they could but there was no such missing baby or his report.

They registered a complaint and suggested that I may have been drunk last night when I picked up the baby.

After the police left I heard the laughter of a baby and when I went inside the room a baby was lying on my bed playing with my cat. I called the cops again informing them that the baby was in the room and I had found the baby.

I went to the kitchen to prepare my breakfast and when I came out I saw my cat dead on the floor. The baby was still in his room filled with sinister laughter. His laugh was getting louder and louder. Horrified, I ran away from home.

When police arrived they saw the home empty with a dead cat lying on the floor. They called me and asked where I was and where the baby was. I replied to them that the baby is not normal to be aware and stay safe. When I returned home I saw two ambulances and other police officers in front of my house. Apparently, two police officers were found dead in my home and there was no baby.

They suspected me for the death of two police officers. After they checked the CCTV, they found that there was nobody in the home except a police officer and both policemen were running and hiding from something not visible on camera and shot each other dead at the same time.

I asked them to check the footage of last night when I brought the baby home.
In the footage, there was no baby. I seem to be pretending to hold something in the air and my cat was scared of something but there was no kid in the picture.

I am not sure where it arrived from or what it was but now I know that home is not safe and that entity is still there.
