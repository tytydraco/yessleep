April 3   
I sat in the car as my mother drove me home. I had just gotten expelled from school because I busted up some girls' faces and my hands still hurt from it. The fight got me kicked off of my college campus and sent to the police.  
“First year in college and this is how you act Marie” my mom spat.  
“Sorry mom didn’t expect for all the worst kids from high school to go to the same college that I was going to”   
My mother just sighed before continuing the drive all the way home. The tree’s towering over me causing shadows to be cast over the car. I lived in a small town. The little home that I bought and fixed when I moved was on the outskirts of a forest. Most people thought I was going to do something malicious for fixing up the burnt down home. There was a cabin in the back that was also a part of my property. My mother dropped me off. Before rolling down her window before pulling out.   
“Please tell me you still have your job Marie” she said. I nodded my head and my mother breathed a sigh of relief. She then said her goodbyes before pulling out of the driveway making me promise I would see my therapist again. I rolled my eyes.    
I walked inside of my house turning on the tv. I sighed, going to my bedroom and changing out of my dirty clothing before going into the kitchen. I went over to my fridge and pulled out leftover chinese food I heated up into the microwave eating it up before I sat down and began to eat the meat.   
bland I thought.    
I stuck out my tongue before setting it on the table beside me.  I then switched to the news. They were talking about the school incident today. I growled. Painting as the villian as both of the girls talked about how much of a psycho that I was and how they thought I was going to kill them    
That's it I can't stand them anymore I’m still not finished with that bitch quit yet I thought to myself. I opened snapchat on my phone and scrolling through it I found a name.    
Perfect. I thought to myself. I opened up the map function figuring out where the profile was. I tapped on it.   
Traveling back home huh well she aint that far away I thought I grabbed my stuff before walking out the door. Time to finish this then maybe they will see who is the real monster.   
  
April 6  
I watched the alleyway as Sarah walked out of work I had just found out were she worked through town gossip and men being well men it wasn't that hard to stake out the place for a few days making sure that she came out when nobody was there and this was the first night in a long time that she walked out alone. I jumped out and grabbed her from behind.  
Sarah squirmed underneath me as I brought the chloroform soaked rag to her mouth. She went limp in my arms. I held it to her mouth for a few more seconds before. I dragged her back to my car. I tossed her in the back. I drove down the street and onto the road that led to the cabin that I owned. It was a small little cabin with one room, a bathroom and a kitchen along with a basement.     
I opened up the door that Sarah was sitting by and dragged her out. I dragged her down the basement and shackled her to a wall next to her friend that I had kidnapped three days prior.   
I grabbed a kitchen knife before I dumped water on the two of them. Waking them both up.   
“Marie when I get out of these I will fucking kill you” said the one girl her long black hair falling in front of her face. Her leather jacket was soaked with water as it dripped down her face. Her leggings soaked.  
“I would love to watch you try Lanie. I need to remind you I’m the one with the knife” I said as I held one to her throat. Lanie glared at me, her eyes narrowed.      
“Lanie what are you doing here?” asked Sarah. Her short brown hair was dripping water all over her blue hoodie and leggings.   
“This bitch kidnapped me a few days ago” hissed Lanie.   
I giggled, “Lanie, you are so funny.”  
“Bitch when I get out of these.”   
Lanie you are never going to leave here and even if by a chance you do this knife will be in your chest cavity and your friend will watch me skin you” I said before getting up.   
Lanies eyes went wide as I left the room, leaving the two of them to their own accord.  
 As I got into the kitchen suddenly static filled my vision and I fell to the ground. I grabbed a chair slowly pulling myself up before. I looked out the window. A creature stood with no facial features visible. It wore a tuxedo and it just stood there staring at me. I growled and ignored it while walking out the door. I could feel the things gaze on me as I walked out the door.  
Stupid kids if they keep bothering me I’m going to have to slit their throats or else they might tell someone I thought.  
I walked into my kitchen and opened up the fridge pulling out some beef before cooking it. The smell filled my nose and I began to gag.    
I sat down on the couch trying to eat the meat. I ended up spitting it out. I sighed as I turned on the news. They were talking about the two missing girls that I now had in my back cabin. I wasn't a suspect yet I sighed and turned off the TV thinking about the creature that was in my backyard, what it was and what it wanted with me. Or like I thought a whole bunch of kids were trying to scare me.  
    
I tossed and turned in my bed. I was walking down a long hallway and saw my ex boyfriend I clenched my fists. I went to hit him. He grabbed me and held me down. I began to scream a voice in my head that rang kill him kill him. I managed to grab a knife and stabbed him, throwing him off of me. I got on top of him and continued to stab him. I jolted awake. Sweat rolling down my face. I got up and grabbed a glass of water. I looked out the window seeing the creature from earlier. I rolled my eyes.  
Maybe I should see a psychologist I thought. I scrolled through my phone and found that there was a psychologist in a nearby city. I saved the address. Before heading back to bed.   
  
April 7  
I stepped into the office and there was some light music giving me a headache. I gave the lady my name and I sat down as I waited for a doctor. She came and grabbed me and I walked into her office. It was bright with sunlight streaming through the window.   
“So Marie my name is Molly I’m here to talk to you about some supposed things you are seeing?” she asked.   
“Yes” I started but then suddenly static filled my head and I rolled to the floor screeching in pain. My eyes widened as I looked out the window. The creature stared at me and suddenly a word rang out: No!  
What the fuck is that thing I thought.   
Suddanly images rushed through my mind, images from my childhood the creature had been watching me for years. I began to sit up as the static stopped. The creature still stood there.  
That thing is no group of kids      
The psychologist tried to get my attention and I looked at her.   
“Marie are you okay you just fell to the ground?” she asked.   
“Yeah I’m fine I just can't seem to enjoy meat anymore” I said.   
The psychologist gave me a confused look “what do you mean Marie?” she asked.  
“I just don't find it appetizing” I said.   
The psychologist continued to give me advice on how and what I could eat to help. I rolled my eyes and walked out of the office. I drove home pulling up to the driveway. I sighed but then grew confused and worried as I saw a package laying there by my door. I walked over to it. The writing was neat and I opened it up and a Hannibal Lecter mouth guard sat in the box along with a pair of red welding goggles and a holster for a knife and what looked like a hatchet holster as well. I grew extremely confused. Before bringing the box inside and setting it on my counter, I noticed my hatchet on the table. I used to use it to cut up the nearby branches around my home when cleaning it. I looked back at the mouth guard and put it on. It fit perfectly over my mouth and I moved my mouth in which I could easily move. I took it off. And sat it on the table.    
I went outside to take a look at my prisoners.   
  
April 10   
The sittings have gotten worse and more and more I can't eat regular meat and one word has been ringing in my head: humans. I went outside carrying a kitchen knife with me and noticed Lanie was getting incredibly weak. An idea popped in my head. Maybe I could get the meat I so craved for.    
“Lanie dearest, I have a deal for you,” I said.  
She looked up at me meekly. “What!” she said.   
I unlocked her chains “you can go if you want but you can't attack me or else I will kill you.”     
Lanie looked up at me before fleeing. I giggled and followed her once I heard the front door open. She was fast but not fast enough. She kept tumbling over branches in which I was able to easily maneuver by. She was also weak from the lack of food. Once I was in throwing distance I threw the knife hitting her square in the back she fell to the ground and screamed out in pain I walked over and took out the knife. Before stabbing her again. Eventually all that was left of her back was her spine, blood was all over my face and it got into my mouth. It stained my jean jacket and my turtleneck crop top along with my blue skinny jeans and I licked my lips. And one word rang in my head     
Food   
I dragged her body back to my cabin and left her in the cell with Sarah who screamed at the sight of her dead friend. I went back home and grabbed my hatchet. I walked back to the cabin and hacked off Lanie’s arm Sarah screaming at me to stop.   
“Shut the fuck up before I cut out your tongue” I said.   
Sarah ended up shutting her mouth. I grabbed Lanies arm and brought it back to my house, cutting it up and cooking it. I sat down at my table and began to eat. The meat was full of flavor. I began to crave it more and continued to eat it until I was full.   
Good girl said a voice.   
  
April 20   
I let Sarah out today. Her mee body was easier to track than Lanie. She was smaller than me and didn't know the forest very well so she kept on stumbling through the brush. I jumped in front of her and tackled her to the ground,  grabbing my new knife from the holster that was strapped around my waist that held both my hatchet and my knife.  
“We are going to try out this new knife that I bought yesterday,” I said, holding it up to her neck.  
Sarah tried to say something in protest but before she could I began stabbing her continually before she grew still blood poured out of her mouth. Her chest cavity was ripped wide open from how many times I stabbed her. Her intestines spilled from her guts. I dragged her back to my cabin growing frustrated when her intestines kept getting caught on the branches but eventually I got her down stairs and threw her beside Lanie cutting her up.  
I had figured out that I loved the arms. I threw some of the meat in the freezer before washing some of the arm meat and throwing it in a pot to cook.   
I sat down in my chair. My light blue jean jacket had blood all over it including my pants and my gray turtleneck crop top as well. I took off the Hannibal Lecter mouth guard and the red goggles.   
Thank whoever sent me these. It was nice to not get entrails and blood in my mouth and eyes this last time. I thought though it does suck that my favorite outfit has been ruined because of those two bitch’s.     
I got up to go take a shower, the water running away all the blood that was on me and the grim from the dirt I got out and threw my dirty clothing in the wash turning on the cycle before changing. I stirred my soup before sitting down with a bowl of it.  
  
April 23   
The spring air felt nice as I walked through town. I breathed in the spring air as I looked for someone new. I was going to run out of meat eventually. And so I needed someone to kidnap. I ended up growing frustrated before walking into the nearby supermarket. I walked around before overhearing someone talk.   
“Why did you stay with her for so long, Sam?” someone asked.   
“Don’t know I felt pity for the bitch she was psycho though” he replied.   
I frowned. I guess I found a new victim. I thought.   
Me and my ex had some history that wasn't exactly the best.    
I stayed in my car and followed him home. He was walking wearing a pair of jeans and a sweater, his gray hat perched on top of his head. I got out of my car once he was in an area with minimal supervision. I walked up behind and just like what I did with Lanie and Sarah I made sure he was passed out and brought him back to my house.   
  
April 24   
I don’t know whether or not he had woken up yet I walked over to my cabin. I opened the door and walked down stairs frowning when I saw he hadn't awoken yet. I took a bucket of water and threw it on him. He awoke and was visibly tense when he saw the body's I smiled through my mouth guard.   
“What have you done?” he hissed.   
“I couldn't eat meat found it odd at first so I tried something new or at least that is what the voices said”   
Sam gave me a weird look through his glasses “your fucking insane” he yelled.  
I giggled before freeing him “you can leave if you want I was just letting you see this as a warning.”   
Sam glared at me before running. He was slow compared to my other victims; he was unfit. I giggled once I heard the door close behind him. I ran after him, able to easily be able to identify him. I ran behind the tree’s and lept out causing him to fall to the ground. I pulled out my Knife and held it to his throat. He reached down to try and find something.   
“Looking for this” I held up a pocket knife before slipping it back into my jacket pocket.   
His eyes widened as I held the knife closer to his neck. I slit his throat and he gurgled out blood as he tried to choke me. I stabbed him more, getting the blood all over the same outfit that I wore when I killed Sarah and Lanie, getting all over my googles as well before reaching into his chest cavity and ripping out his beating heart. He grew still as the blood on the heart dripped down onto my gloved hands. Covering them in the crimson liquid. I giggled as I hacked off his arms, tears rolling down my face from laughter.. Sighing realizing I was going to need to cut a shit ton of fat off. I brought them with me when I was walking back into my house. I closed the door behind me, pausing when I heard a dish drop. I turned around and my mother stood there.  
“My god Marie what have you done!” she screamed. She reached for a phone.  
no one can know, said a voice.    
Without thinking I grabbed my knife and ran to her she ran I jumped up on top of her making her falter and drop to the floor losing her grip on the phone I shoved it into her skull making her drop to the ground I lept on top of her ripping it out and shoving it through her back continually stabbing her. I huffed and puffed through my mask slipping my knife next to my hatchet and new pocket knife before. I ran out into my garage grabbing a can of gasoline and pouring it all over the place around my house before taking my ex-boyfriend's lighter and setting it all ablaze. I giggled maniacally, tears rolling down my face from laughter.  A hand rested on my shoulder. I looked up and it was the same creature that had been stalking me for the past month. I looked up at it. It had to be at least seven feet and the most unnerving thing was that it had no face. Next to him was a young boy who wore a gas mask and blue welding goggles. A bat with nails hammered all over it  rested on his back along with different syringes that ran across his blue hoodie. His brown hair fell in front of his face. The creature motioned me to follow it. I felt a pull before looking over at the boy. He nodded his head  and I followed the creature into the forest. Sirens going off in the distance from the fire trucks and police.   
For whoever is reading this I hope you are ready for my game
