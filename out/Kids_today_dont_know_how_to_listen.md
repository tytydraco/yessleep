The silence was broken by my footsteps. I pulled an empty chair in front of the shelves, climbed onto it, and ran my fingers across the library's shelves. My eyes landed on a thin book, the cover slightly torn but still in its former glory. It was practically begging me to take it. With its dusty, musty scent and worn leather, it looked like an ancient relic. Its title was written in faded golden letters on the cover: "The Haunted Manor of the Robertsons". It seemed like an intriguing book.



The pages were yellowed, with some parts torn. As I ran my hand over the ink, I noticed it had an unusual texture, just as you'd expect from an old book.



I jumped down from the chair. As I landed, liquid on the floor splashed around, but I paid it no mind. I opened the first chapter of the book and cleared my throat to catch the attention of the silent crowd before me. Then, I began to read the book aloud.



\----



*The sun filtered through the misty clouds, briefly illuminating the tiles of the Robertson Manor. Although it was late October of 1888, the trees surrounding the manor had not yet lost all their autumn hues. The red, yellow, and brown shades of the leaves added an air of grandeur to the manor, but this magnificence was not enough to mask the darkness embedded in the stone walls of the building.*



*The manor stood atop the hill, towering majestically as if it had been there for centuries. Gothic arches and Victorian-era intricate details were a testament to the exquisite craftsmanship. The towers stretched towards the sky like fingers, seemingly watching over something. The windows, though appearing to invite sunlight inside, were veiled mysteries, each holding secrets no one knew. Stained glass created colorful shadows as the sunlight filtered through into the rooms.*



*The main door, adorned with carved wood and polished brass, caught one’s attention instantly. On either side of the door stood bronze lion statues, symbolizing the power and grandeur of the manor. Above the door was the Robertson family crest, a nod to the glory days of the past—a legacy they clearly intended to preserve. The staircase inside was decorated with polished wood and red carpets, giving the sensation of ascending gracefully with each step.*



*The garden was meticulously maintained with flower beds, trimmed shrubs, and long gravel pathways. A marble statue of a goddess stood in the fountain at the center, spraying water elegantly. The Robertsons had hired the finest gardeners and entrusted them with the upkeep of their grounds.*

*The chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves hinted at life outside, yet the silence within the manor seemed ready to swallow everything.*



*Edward Robertson had just finished his piano lessons and arrived at the grand, opulent dining room for breakfast. As the youngest member of the family and the only son, he carried a heavy weight of responsibility. He had to do everything perfectly. Entering the room, he saw his parents seated at the table, their meals untouched. Bowing slightly to his father for permission, he took his usual seat.*



*His father spoke, his tone calm but authoritative:*

*"Where is Beatrice?"*



*A servant answered promptly:*

*"She is in her room, sir. She asked me to inform you that she will be coming after changing her attire."*



*"She must have been very tired from last night's practice. Be understanding towards her," said his mother, Eleanor Robertson. "She’s just a young girl, and—" Her sentence was interrupted by Beatrice’s footsteps as she finally entered the dining room. She bowed her head apologetically before sitting in her designated chair, much like her brother. With everyone present, the servants began to serve breakfast. The menu included omelets and fried sausages.*



*Edward’s father, Alistair Robertson, reprimanded him for eating without decorum. "You’re eating like a gluttonous animal," he remarked, his voice calm yet commanding. Edward was taken aback but didn’t argue out of respect. He was certain he was using the correct fork, refraining from smacking his lips, and following every rule of etiquette, yet it still wasn’t enough for his father.*

*"Calm down, dear," said Eleanor, though she was just as worried as Edward.*



*After breakfast, Edward and Beatrice requested permission to leave for fencing practice with their private instructor. Silence hung in the air until they left the room.*



*"You’re being too harsh on them," Eleanor remarked after the children had exited. "They’re just kids; you don’t need to be so strict."*



*Alistair replied curtly, "Do not interfere. Someone needs to teach them humanity. They must learn to fend for themselves when we are no longer here." As he spoke, he clutched his chest.*



*"Again? You need to tell your doctor about this," Eleanor criticized, her concern evident over her husband’s heart condition.*



*Ignoring her words, Alistair pressed a hand to his chest and stood up. "It’s nothing serious," he muttered. "Just a bit... discomfort." He then turned his gaze to the mist-covered garden outside the window. "I have important matters to attend to today," he said, his voice once again cold and commanding. "Don’t trouble your mind with such nonsense." Eleanor, accustomed to her husband’s moodiness, couldn’t help but worry silently as he left the room, leaving behind a peculiar unease.*



*Edward and Beatrice walked to the fencing hall, the dim light and heavy silence of the corridors filling them with an eerie sense of foreboding. The walls of the manor seemed to watch over them as if holding their secrets. The fencing hall, located in the west wing of the house, was a high-ceilinged, spacious room. Sunlight streaming through the windows danced in the dusty air. Their instructor, Mr. Thompson, was waiting for them as usual.*



*Tall, built, and stern, Mr. Thompson was a skilled fencer who enforced a rigorous discipline on his students. Edward and Beatrice donned their gear under his guidance and began their practice. The metallic clash of swords echoed in the otherwise silent hall. Edward tried his best to focus, though his father’s criticism from breakfast still lingered in his mind. Beatrice, on the other hand, was more agile and determined, her movements graceful yet powerful.*



*Finally, Mr. Thompson instructed the siblings to spar against each other. Positioned at opposite ends of the hall, they readied their swords. They charged at each other, but Beatrice, quicker and more agile, ended the bout before Edward could even retaliate.*



*By the end of practice, both siblings were drenched in sweat. After offering them a brief word of praise, Mr. Thompson left the room. Alone, Edward voiced his frustration.*

*"I don’t understand why Father is so harsh. I try to do everything perfectly, but it’s never enough."*



*Beatrice looked at her brother with sympathy. "Father is just... like that sometimes. Don’t let it upset you too much," she said. "Maybe he’s dealing with his own struggles."*



*Edward’s frustration boiled over. "That doesn’t give him the right to be so harsh with me!" he exclaimed. Beatrice pulled her brother into a tight embrace. "Don’t worry," she whispered. "As long as we have each other, we’ll be fine."*



*That afternoon, Edward retreated to the library. The Robertson library, the family’s greatest pride, was a grand room with towering shelves filled with books. Antique wooden desks, leather armchairs, and a large fireplace gave the space a warm atmosphere. Edward was there to examine his father’s handwritten notes, eager to learn more about the family’s history and uncover past events. As he took one of the books and blew off the dust, a letter fell from between the pages.*



*The letter, written on yellowed and aged parchment, caught his attention immediately. The handwriting was intricate but legible with effort. The letter was dated to the late 1840s and had been penned by Edward’s grandfather, Sir Reginald Robertson—a man Edward had never met, making the discovery all the more intriguing.*



*The letter spoke of strange occurrences in the manor.*



\*\*\*\*

Dear Son, Alistair,



As I write these lines to you, my heart is filled with a deep unease and a chilling fear. For years, I have lived in this manor, and now I feel it is time to share with you certain truths I have never dared to voice. Perhaps when you read this, you will think I have lost my mind; however, the events I have witnessed have pushed the limits of my sanity.



This manor is a legacy from our ancestors. Its stones, its rooms, its gardens… each bears witness to history. Yet, behind the grandeur of this place lies a dark secret. At first, everything seemed normal. The days passed calmly and routinely. But over time, strange occurrences began to unfold.



It started with inexplicable noises at night… murmurs, whispers, as if coming from within the walls. So vague and eerie, it was as if they were toying with your ears. At first, I thought it was just the sound of the wind. But even when the storms ceased, these sounds persisted.



Then came the cold spots… In the peak of summer's heat, stepping into certain rooms feels like walking into a frozen abyss. This cold is not ordinary—it chills you to your very soul. At first, I believed it was due to drafts within the house. But these cold spots follow no pattern, appearing suddenly and vanishing just as quickly. Every attempt I made to fix it only made things worse. Eventually, you'll notice it for yourself.



What frightens me the most, however, are the shadows… Shadows that suddenly appear on the walls, in the hallways, on the staircases. It feels as if someone is watching us. These shadows resemble human silhouettes but never fully take shape. They seem to be a part of the darkness itself, mocking us. Sometimes they look so real that when I turn to confront them, finding no one there is far more terrifying. It's as if unseen entities are sharing this house with us.



One night, I decided to investigate these strange occurrences more closely. Taking a candle in hand, I wandered through the hallways. With every step, the fear within me grew. Eventually, I found myself in the west wing of the manor, in an old, unused room. When I opened the door, it was pitch black inside. Feeling my way through the darkness, I suddenly stepped on something. Bending down, I discovered an old, dusty journal on the floor.



The journal belonged to one of our ancestors, Sir Humphrey Robertson. In it, he detailed the strange events in the manor. Humphrey believed these occurrences were tied to a secret hidden deep within the house. The events he described were identical to what I’ve experienced. But what terrified me the most were the things I read in his journal. Humphrey wrote about a dark entity that had resided in the manor for centuries. This entity had grown and strengthened alongside the manor itself. He claimed it wanted to consume everything, even our entire family.



Since that day, I have lived in this manor with a newfound sense of dread. I feel as though I am constantly on the brink of danger. Perhaps all of this is just a trick of my imagination. But the fear within me convinces me it is the undeniable truth. I can no longer sleep peacefully in this house. Every moment, I fear being consumed by this dark entity.



My dear son Alistair, the reason I am writing this letter to you is to prepare you for this secret. If you ever return to this manor, do not disregard these events. Remember, the walls of the manor see and hear everything. Perhaps you will be able to uncover the true nature of this secret. Or perhaps, to protect yourself, you should stay far away from this house. The choice is yours. But whatever you do, be cautious. There is something within these walls… something that wants to consume everything.



I embrace you with love and pray that God protects you.



Your father,

**Reginald Robertson**



\*\*\*\*



*Edward was left in a state of confusion after reading the letter. Was this letter… real? Had his father seen it? If he had, why hadn’t he mentioned it? Were all these things written in the letter… true?*



*Edward stood up from his chair and walked over to the library window. Outside, the sky was growing darker, and the mist was slowly enveloping the manor. The night's gloom made the manor even more ominous. He fixed his gaze on the garden and noticed indistinct shapes moving within the mist. Were they just shadows cast by the trees and bushes, or were they manifestations of the dark presence Reginald had warned about?*



*The library door creaked open, and Beatrice entered, startling Edward so much that he jumped. In her hand was a cup of hot chocolate, Edward’s favorite. “Still here?” she asked. “Dinner is almost ready.” Her voice pulled Edward out of his unsettling thoughts for a moment. He wanted to be honest with her, but he didn’t know how to explain the letter.*



*“Just reading a little,” he said, trying to mask the unease in his voice. Beatrice noticed the tension on his face. “What’s wrong?” she asked with concern. “You look troubled.” Edward took a deep breath and closed the book he had hidden the letter in. “It’s nothing,” he said, avoiding her gaze. “I’m just tired.”*



*Beatrice could tell he wasn’t being truthful but decided not to press him further. “Alright, then, let’s go eat,” she said. “Maybe we can chat more after dinner.” Edward nodded and followed her to the dining room. As they walked, the words of the letter echoed in his mind. Reginald’s warning reverberated: “Remember, the walls of the manor see and hear everything.”*



*At the dinner table, Alistair and Eleanor joined them. As usual, the meal passed in silence. Alistair, cold and authoritative, didn’t say a word to his children. Eleanor, though she occasionally smiled at them, couldn’t hide the worry in her eyes. When Edward looked at his father, he felt as if Alistair was hiding something. Perhaps he did know about this secret, and that was why he seemed so tense and uneasy.*



*After dinner, Edward excused himself, citing exhaustion, and retired to his room. Beatrice stayed behind to spend more time with their mother. Once in his room, Edward immediately retrieved the book and the letter he had hidden inside it. Sitting on the edge of his bed, he reviewed the letter once more under the dim light. Reginald’s words became clearer in his mind.*



*“There is something within these walls… something that wants to consume everything.” The sentence sent chills down Edward’s spine. What had his grandfather meant by this? What was this “thing,” and how had it gained power within the manor? Determined to find answers, Edward decided to dig deeper. Perhaps Sir Humphrey’s journal could provide some clues. But where was it?*



*Edward began searching his bookshelves and drawers. He thought about the dusty shelves in the library and the old books they housed. There was a good chance Sir Humphrey’s journal was among them. After some time, he left his room and headed back to the library. The library, now cloaked in the evening’s shadows, seemed even more foreboding. The shadows between the shelves appeared almost alive, like lurking monsters. Holding a candle, Edward cautiously wandered through the shelves, listening intently to the faintest sounds.*



*Eventually, Edward noticed a hidden compartment behind one of the shelves. Opening it, he discovered a small chest. The chest looked ancient and worn. Its lid bore the crest of the Robertson family. Cradling the chest in his arms and trembling with fear, Edward carried it back to his room.*



*In his room, Edward locked the door and placed the chest carefully on his bed. His heart pounded with a mix of excitement and dread. The chest felt like a gateway to the family’s hidden past, and he was eager to uncover its secrets. Placing the candle on his bedside table, he examined the chest. Its wood was worn, its carvings faded. The Robertson crest on its lid symbolized pride and power.*



*Edward reached out and slowly unlatched the brass clasp on the lid. As he lifted it, a musty smell filled the room, changing the atmosphere instantly. The inside of the chest… was dark. Pure, endless darkness. Edward couldn’t make sense of it. He tried to use the candlelight to peer inside, but it was useless. The chest seemed to absorb the light.*



*Edward brought the candle closer to the chest, but as the flame neared its depths, it vanished, swallowed by the darkness within. This unsettled him even more. It was as if the chest contained more than just an ordinary void—as if it held an infinite darkness that consumed all light.*



*Suddenly, a faint clicking sound came from inside the chest. At that moment, Edward heard a whisper behind him. Someone softly called his name: “****Edward…****” The voice was so close that Edward spun around immediately, but no one was there. His heart raced. Trembling, he accidentally dropped the candle into the chest. No sound came from its fall, and the chest never lit up. Instead, the room plunged into complete darkness. Panicking, Edward fumbled to close the chest and then lit a new candle.*



*As the flickering light filled the room, Edward looked around, his heart pounding. The darkness seemed to retreat momentarily but still lurked in the corners. The chest was now shut, but its eerie presence remained. The faint clicking noise and the whispering voice were burned into his mind. This chest was far from ordinary.*



*Edward hastily carried the chest back to where he had found it. Trembling and unable to think clearly, he replaced the chest in its hidden compartment. While doing so, he discovered a journal tucked behind the chest. He took the journal, closed the compartment, and immediately heard the clicking sound again. This time, he felt a cold breath on the back of his neck.*



*“****Edward…****” The whisper came from just behind him. He bolted back to his room, shoved the journal under his pillow, and collapsed onto his bed. Exhausted and terrified, he soon fell into a restless sleep.*



*The pain in Alistair's chest had worsened significantly. Medicinal herbs and plants were no longer able to ease his suffering. Upon seeing her husband in this state, Eleanor left Beatrice's side to help him to their room. "Go to your room, sweetheart," she said to her daughter. "We are going to sleep as well." With these words, Beatrice returned to her own room and lay down on her bed.*



*Beatrice tried to calm her mind as she lay in bed. But sleep eluded her. She tossed and turned, finally staring at the ceiling. Then, she heard a faint scratching sound coming from the corner of the room. Beatrice sat up slowly, straining her ears. The sound seemed to come from inside the wall. Moments later, the scratching sound was heard again. Beatrice got out of bed and walked toward the source of the noise. She approached the wall and realized that the sound was indeed coming from within it, as if someone were moving something inside the wall.*



*Unable to stand it any longer, Beatrice knocked on the wall. "Who's there?" she asked in a trembling whisper. There was no answer—just silence and the scratching sound. Beatrice knocked on the wall again and repeated her question. Still no answer. However, the scratching sound seemed to quicken, as though responding to her.*



*"Edward, is that you?" she asked, but still, there was no reply. For a moment, Beatrice thought her brother was playing a prank on her, trying to scare her. But it seemed impossible for Edward to create such a realistic fear. The scratching sound was like someone digging or clawing at something inside the wall. Determined to uncover the source of the sound, she moved more purposefully.*



*She took a candle from the nightstand by her bed and lit it. The flickering light illuminated the corners of the room as Beatrice approached the wall slowly. She placed her hand on the wall and ran her fingers along its surface, trying to pinpoint exactly where the sound was coming from. Parts of the wall felt cold, while others were slightly warm. The scratching seemed to emanate from the colder areas.*



*Beatrice knocked on the wall several more times and raised her voice slightly, "Who's there? What are you doing?" Again, there was no reply. But this time, the scratching noises intensified as if something—or someone—was trying to communicate with her.*



*At that moment, a voice came from her left: "****Beatrice...****" Her body froze. She began trembling uncontrollably. She tried to rationalize what she'd heard, thinking it was an auditory hallucination. But then she heard it again: "****Beatrice...****" She turned her head to the left, trembling, and saw a tall, black shadow standing in the darkest corner of the room. Paralyzed, she could neither move nor scream. The shadow extended its hands and... seized her.*



*At dawn, the house was shaken by the screams of the maids. Their cries had woken the entire manor, shattering the silence with agonized wails. Edward, startled awake by the noise, grabbed the journal and rushed toward the commotion. Maids and his parents were gathered outside Beatrice's room. Some of the maids were in shock, while others wept uncontrollably. Eleanor's face was red and puffy from crying, her sobs punctuated by sharp breaths, while Alistair stood frozen, staring blankly into the room. Taking advantage of their stunned state, Edward peeked inside.*



*The scene that greeted him made him vomit on the spot. His sister's lifeless body was torn apart, her remains strewn across the room. Pieces of her body clung to the ceiling, while her severed head lay on the floor, blood pouring from the pieces on the ceiling onto her severed head and jaw lying on the floor. The room was a blood-soaked horror. Edward turned away, retching violently.*



*The horrifying sight wouldn't leave Edward's mind. The walls were smeared with blood, the air thick with the metallic smell of death, and the sight of his beloved sister's mutilated body seared into his memory.*



*Eleanor was inconsolable, crying out in anguish. Her tears fell without end, and her cries grew louder with every passing moment. Alistair, who had always been a commanding and stoic figure, was a shadow of himself. His pale face and empty gaze betrayed the shock and despair he felt.*



*Eventually, Alistair snapped out of his daze and barked orders for the maids to call the authorities. Gathering his wife and son, he ushered them out of the house. A short while later, the sheriff and several officers arrived at the scene. No one could comprehend what had happened. A maid who had gone to wake Beatrice for her morning lessons had discovered the gruesome scene and had screamed in shock.*



*The sheriff addressed the Robertsons, "We'll assign a detective to investigate this. Mr. and Mrs. Robertson, you and the maids must come with us." Alistair reluctantly agreed. He gathered Edward and followed the sheriff into the carriages that would take them to the town center for questioning. The journey was eerily silent, a blessing for Edward, who was still reeling from the shock.*



*At the police station, the family underwent intense questioning. Each person gave the same answer: "I don't know what happened." The sheriff suggested the family stay in town for a few days for their safety. Alistair agreed and moved his family to a nearby hotel.*



*Once in his hotel room, Edward went straight to the bathroom. He felt filthy. The memory of his sister, whom he had adored, haunted him. While in the bathroom, he could hear his parents talking outside. Eleanor's voice was choked with tears: "I can't take this, Alistair! Our daughter is dead! She's gone! How did this happen? Who could do such a monstrous thing?" she cried.*



*Alistair, though visibly angry and pained, replied with a harsh tone: "One of the maids must be a fucking killer. When I find that bastard, I'll burn their entire family alive!" His anger was laced with deep sorrow.*



*Edward came out of the bathroom, dried himself and went to bed without saying a word. He thought about what had happened. “It's a curse, isn't it?” he said to himself. “It's a curse....it's the curse of that manor. That's what the letter said.” He tried not to think about his sister, but he couldn't. His eyes were completely watery and the drops began to run down his cheeks one by one. He began to cry silently on his bed.*



*Suddenly, he was jolted awake by his father's cries. Alistair was clutching his chest, writhing in pain. Eleanor tried to help, but her efforts were in vain. "Stay with your father; I'll go find help!" she said, running out of the hotel and screaming for a doctor. Edward stayed by his father's side, but the large man collapsed to the floor. With his last ounce of strength, Alistair looked at Edward, gently stroked his cheek, and said, "I'm sorry." Those were his final words. Tears were streaming down Edward's face. “I'm sorry.” were his fathers last words. He wasn't breathing, he wasn't moving. He was just lying there.*



*Edward heard a tapping behind him, but he didn't care. He picked up the diary and opened the pages. He was opening the pages when he heard a voice behind him. “****Edward...****” a whisper.*



*Edward looked at the pages, they were all completely scribbled and some pages were completely missing, only the last page had a huge inscription.* 



\*\*\*\*



**IT IS FOLLOWING ME.**



\*\*\*\*



*Edward had understood the situation. Despite the icy chill he felt on the back of his neck, he did not turn around. That 'thing' was not the curse of the manor; it was the curse of the Robertsons...*



\---



"And the end," I said, closing the book. "Wow, what a great book, I was really impressed! Although the ending was a bit open-ended, it was still fun and scary," I said, throwing the book on the floor. It made an interesting sound when it hit the wet ground. "So, what do you think?" I asked the crowd I had just read the story to. No one said a word. "Oh, come on, I read all that for you. At least say thank you or tell me what you thought of the story, did you like it?" I said. The crowd ignored me.



I approached the table in front of me and grabbed one of the heads that had fallen on the table by the hair and lifted it. "Come on, Andrew, tell me you liked it." But... still no response. I stopped holding the hair, and the head dropped back onto the table, making a heavy sound as it hit. I looked at my hand and saw dark, thick blood. "Damn, Andrew! You got my hand dirty. I told you to stay clean, son." I wiped my hand on him. He still wasn’t answering. "I bring you all the way here, read you an amazing story, and you don’t even respond! Fine then, I’m not talking to you," I said, and moved on to the other tables. 

Some were lying on the ground, others had fallen from their chairs, but none of them wanted to talk about the story. They hadn’t listened to me. Kids today don't know how to listen.



My eyes caught a small, sweet girl sitting at one of the little tables. She couldn’t have been older than 9. She was looking at me and smiling. I felt a warmth inside. It was as if she was calling me to be a family to her.



I walked over to her and bent down to her face. "Well, sweet thing, did you like the story? I know you might have been scared, but what do you think?" She, like the others, didn’t respond. I took a deep breath, and then I noticed the siren sounds and red and blue lights outside the library. I turned to the girl and said, "Well, it’s time to go, but since you’re a good child, I’m taking you with me. From now on, I’m your new daddy." I turned my rifle around on my shoulder and picked her up. Her head flopped back. I think she was asleep. As I walked out the back door of the library, I looked at her. The hole in her forehead made her cuteness 10 times more intense.



Yes, she didn’t answer because she was shy, but I think she loved the story too.
