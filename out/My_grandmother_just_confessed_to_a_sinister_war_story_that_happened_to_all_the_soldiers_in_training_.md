Dead. 












It was the worst disaster to happen to me.










“Do you have everything, Claire?” he shouted as he locked the front door and began to trot towards the car.











“Yes.. i have everything except battery…” i deeply sighed as i peered at my blank phone then out of the window. 









The door opened beside me as he climbed in and closed it. With a small chuckle he then replied.






“Well now you have the whole journey to talk with me..how about that..!” 





The orange and pink streaks were dragged along the sky like paint on a canvas. I noticed the silence amongst us, my eyes dragging itself to sleep but at the same time my mind raced with annoyance and confusion — biting my lip i watched the view change, so did the atmosphere that surrounded me. 







“Julian..” i trailed off as his right hand tightened around the steering wheel — he then did a small hum, staring in front of the road ahead of us. 



“I don’t get the point.. i-i mean come on… why are we doing th—“ 









“Enough.” he shot harshly as he flicked the small black button and a delicate tune resonated out the radio. I propped my head up against the window and looked out at the houses that now flew by us. 







It was every Saturday morning. 







Where i found myself driving with Julian. But it was as if he didn’t realise things anymore. 







I managed to sit comfortably and shut my eyes for a few moments until i was woken up by a sharp jolt of the car and he gently tapped my shoulder. 







i glanced at the white cottage that tucked itself behind the tall green trees that swayed with the wind. The home sat on its own away from civilian life, the crystalline window stared into me, as i opened the car door — the sharp grass beneath my feet pricked me, it was reminding us that we were here. 





And we could quickly leave now.







Julian followed my movements after me, locking the car — we both gave each other a look and started to walk towards the old white gate that wrapped around the entire home.








The garden filled with pink roses and yellow tulips that glared at us as we strolled towards the white door. 







“Remember… no phone and do not ask for anything.. you hear me?” He sternly commanded as i nodded quickly, trying to dismiss the wooden platform beneath us that constantly creaked in disturbance. 







Knock





Knock





Knock







A faint cluttering sound came from the door handle and then it gradually opened. 






There she was. 







The lines on her face was like a map of time stretched out, meeting with the strands of curly grey hair that laid evenly on the top of her head in a bun. Eyes danced upon us, as a charming smile rose from her beautiful cheeks that showed her dimples.







“Hello Grandma.. how are you..?” i asked politely as i leaned in for a hug.









“I am quite alright dear.. you?” Her sweet voice flowed into my ears as she gave me a soft kiss on the cheek and allowed us in.








The smell of freshly baked cookies eased the tension that i had previously felt. 









“Come in, Come in…darlings, sit in this room.” Grandma offered us as we walked through the hallway and into the large living room. 








The living room had a large glass cabinet that stored heaps books that were older than me inside. Mountains and scenery were drawn and framed as paintings, each turn you took they hung up neatly on the wall. My eyes transfixed onto the pile of paperwork that was messily strawn across the wooden table in front of me - i finally sat down on her sofa that pulled me deeper inside with every small movements to archive a comfortable position. 









 She gradually walked towards the living room holding a plate of cookies and an old tatty book in her other hand. 







“Where’s Francis..?” Julian asked immediately, as she placed the plate on the table, and slowly began to sit down at the single sofa chair.








“He’s currently at the market buying some apricots that i love!” Grandma cheerfully exclaimed as Julian did a low grunt and looked over at me with darting eyes.








“Oh-erm… Grandma do you hav—“ 









“Claire, would you like some of my oat biscuits?” Grandma offered as i glared at the dry biscuits and eventually gave in - delicately taking one from the plate and nibbling down on it. 








Grandma held the book in her arms as if she was guarding it with her life. 






I noticed Julian staring out at the window, the sun dipped beneath the grassy hills that were sound asleep - the small birds hopped from one branch to another then fluttered away from the jarring wind that poked and prided the area. 



I turned to Grandma, her worn hands now turning the pages of a small book that i couldn’t work out what it was. 



The comforting silence swept through the old cottage as a sharp thought treaded in my mind. 



“What are you reading?” I questioned in a curious tone as i felt a pair of annoyed eyes trace up my body. 





“Oooh it’s an old story…rather peculiar..” Grandma whispered as i felt my heart flip with excitement. I needed something to cure the boredom i feel every Saturday. I couldn’t stand the thought of sitting and waiting till tea arrived.



“What’s it about?..” i asked more curious than ever as she turned the page to the start of the book and handed it to me.






“Claire…” Julian trailed off as i huffed and took the old book in my hands.






The smooth leathery case tucked inside my palms as i admired the small engravings of unknown symbols and words.



“Would you like to know a little secret about Grandpa Francis?” She asked with a smile as i nodded eagerly as Julian rose from his seat and came next to me. 


“Doris… we talked about this..” He snapped as he tried to take the book from my hands but i swerved it away. 



I opened the book. 




I assumed it was going to be a prehistoric tale or a gruesome folklore to warn children. 



But it was a medium sized polaroid photo that was evenly stuck inside the first page. 


“That is Francis when he was young!” Grandma chuckled as my immediate question was answered hastily. 


The teenage boy held a small rifle cradled in his arms. He had a flock of brown hair that was neatly brushed to one side - his eyes were narrowed with a chilling, dead glare at the camera. Young Francis wore a green camouflaged shirt and trousers with thick black boots. He stood behind a cobblestone wall — the sky was bright and everything was normal. 



However, i couldn’t help but feel a shiver trace down my spine as my eyes were drawn to his face. 


“Let me tell you about my Francis before he comes home darling…” Grandma beamed as she took the book from my hands and cleared her throat and said.



“We were still together, trying to figure out our lives after our newborn died years earlier. That was when he had to enlist, soon enough he had to leave for thorough training.” 

——————



“State your name Private.” The chubby man ordered as a young man walked to the table and replied.



“Francis. Francis Iverson..” the male stated with a soft smile as he stood upright carrying his backpack on his shoulders and a book in his hands.



“Straight through the hall go outside and find the second large wooden bunk -  where you will be staying.” the man lazily said as he pointed at the glass door.



The young male pushed the door opened, his mouth was agape as he looked upon the grassy wide fields that stretched out far beyond. He looked at the young men that ran laps around the paved tracks, climb walls whilst clenching the ropes with all their strengths. 


He could hear the distant yelling of men ordering the other soldiers to climb faster up the wall, as he began to slowly trot to his barrack. 



The wooden bunker sat further away from where he was originally walking, many of these bunkers were spread out meters apart  as his eyes lingered upon the very few men heading into the bunker he was currently going to. 


The metal door was already propped open as he stepped in nervously. 


Before he could utter a single word a young man rushed towards him.


“Hey. We got a new recruit…” the man snickered as he wrapped his arm around Francis tightly as if he was wrestling with him. 



A group of men stared at Francis, taking in his appearance, checking if he was a good enough soldier. 



“Oi you, what’s your name..” a rough voice broke the silence as another person approached Francis rudely.



The man had short curly brown hair that was neatly trimmed to a standard. His light brown eyes were narrowed, glaring at the boy who stood cluelessly in the doorway.



“Francis….Iverson..-“


The man who wrapped his arm around the boy slightly moved away and sat on his bed watching. 


“You can’t stay here the bunk is full, try somewhere else.” the soldier coldly grunted, the room becoming more intense as Iverson let out an awkward chuckle.


“W-what do you mean… i was assigned here..” He blurted as the other young man clenched his fists but before anyone could say a thing, a loud knock resonated the room.



“YOU LOT. I TOLD YOU TO BE DOWN THERE IN 5 MINUTES. WHAT’S TAKING SO LONG?!”

A slim, tensed man was standing at the doorway, he wore the usual brown uniform and thick black boots. Francis realised immediately that he was the sergeant.



Soon enough all the soldiers that were scattered around the bunker darted outside, towards the flat ground, away from the training equipment as the sergeant casually walked towards them.



All soldiers stood upright in a long line, waiting. 



“Before we start the exercise, i want all of you to welcome our latest recruit, Francis Iverson — who will be joining us for the 13 week training.”



The man strolls to Iverson and shakes his hand with a dark glare then carries on pacing up and down the line. 



“Now. I want to see some stretches before we begin the pushups and squat jumps.”



“YES SIR.” they boomed in unison as the young men began the task.



The sunny morning dragged on as the soldiers finished their marches, learning the basics about their weapons, and a tough exercise. 


A black sheet casted itself amongst the sky as the men began to walk back to their barracks after supper was done. 



“Hey.. Iverson, wait up!” a fellow soldier called making Francis turn around and smile. 



“Hey.. you must be..-“



“Charles. Charles Everett.. at your service” mocked the young boy with a grin making Francis chuckle, easing the aches he felt in every limb of his body. 


The boy had smooth blonde hair that parted to one side of his head. His shiny blue eyes and a relaxed expression that plastered across his face. 



The two men introduced themselves better, chattered about their training and the tense atmosphere that Francis had experienced. 



“What’s up with that guy anyway…” Francis spoke quietly as they were a few steps away from their bunk.



“Oh i don’t know him that well, but some bloke told me he’s a spiteful guy.. don’t worry about it.” Charles calmly reassured the worried boy as he patted Francis’s back, and glided through the other soldiers that were infront of them rapidly.



“You see, my Francis trained for a while — they learned many things about their weapons and combat skills. But, there was a day that was…well.. different.” Grandma continued her eyes that previously danced with excitement were dark and jittered across the room.




It was within a week before Francis knew the proper ways to hold his bayonet and his warmups to exceed his strengths. He knew training was going to be difficult, especially when his muscles groaned day by day but he carried on. 


The soldiers were seated in their bunks, ready for the evening when the sergeant stormed into their room. 


He held his nose up high, eyes moving across the paper rapidly before he glared at each of them sternly.


“All of your routines have changed. Tomorrow you will be seated in the meeting room.” he commanded as all the soldiers stopped moving their duvet sheets around and with a puzzling look they stared back at the sergeant.



“Sir may i ask why.?” piped one of the soldiers that was lying down on his bed.


Francis was also thinking the same question, holding his small leather book clutched in his hand. 



“This is training. Do not think that all of you will have a day off.” And with that the sergeant disappeared into the night with a loud bang from the metal door. 




It was a bright morning. The soldiers had to walk far out from where they previously trained into this large white building where the meetings were held. The sergeant lead them into a room with a small television and many seats placed in rows — the tables stored at the back of this room, all the blinds were shut. 



“Now listen here. You will have to watch a video on this television, this will help with your techniques on the battlefield.” added the slim man as the young soldiers sat down on the seats confused.


It was not like anything before.



They were glued to their seats, the videos flashing quickly as each of the soldiers eyes were transfixed onto the blaring screen.




 Most normal people would call that “torture clips” But everyone else named it “special training.”


The “special training” lasted for weeks. 



Each video they watched was different. Screaming and crying of men or woman, even children as they went through a sickening experience that no one could process. 







Then they went back to their bunks in silence.




“HEY. Francis, what’s up with you there? You looked shit scared..?” 


The soldiers trudged to their barrack as Francis heard a chuckle behind him.



The young man felt disturbed. He could not wrap his mind around the “special training” yes they are going to protect their country from the enemy, but torturing them wasn’t his intention. 



“Im not scared.  It’s just not normal for us to watch something so appalling.” Francis coolly replied.


“What, you think bringing a gun is going to stop something? This is what we are here for Iverson.” the man shot, as Francis stood next to his bed whilst the other boy lingered almost a meter away from him.


“That isn’t true.”



“What, you calling me a liar.?” 



“Didn’t say that…”



“Wait boys, Iverson thinks that watching those clips isn’t part of the training…what’s the point of you even enlisting? You’re a fucking sissy.” 



“Can’t you leave me alone…What the heck is wrong with yo—“ 




The stench of trepidation and anger seeped into the bunker, what followed after it was the noise of pounding of multiple fists and kicking — it wouldn’t stop. They wouldn’t stop. 



That was when the metal door opened and the sergeant stood there.



Francis shouted and yelled at the sergeant, but to his dismay, the slim man slowly shut the door, the young boy’s eyes widened at the cold-blooded man.


He couldn’t move.



The blood streamed down his nose, his body beaten up by at least five men at once whilst the rest of the boys watched, lacking any sympathy.




“What’s wrong with that guy?!” I murmured as i tried to steady myself from the boiling rage that was bubbling inside of me.



“Well don’t ask me dear… a matter of fact ask him.” Grandma trembled, shaking her head in pure disgust.



I almost chuckled a little as i replied with.



“Grandma,  you know.. I cant do that..” i rolled my eyes at her sarcasm but she didn’t budge. Instead, she answered bluntly.


“Well.. he is sitting right next to you.” 


I gasped and turned around to Julian whose tired body was slumped into the sofa, but he was still wide awake, his eyes turning away from mine — i turned to Grandma who laughed and cleared her now croaky throat and continued. 



Francis knew that the boys in his bunk and the other men were disturbed by the videos that they were forced to watch. He couldn’t just sit back and let this all happen. He had to do something.




The only good person he could talk to now was Charles Everett.


After breakfast, Francis rushed to the field where he instantly saw the young male gradually walking towards his bunk.



“HEY EVERETT. WAIT UP!” Francis yelled making the man stop in his tracks, he turned around.



The young boy’s eyes were bruised and puffy. His knuckles appeared to have red marks across them as they shook violently, desperately trying to hold the water bottle in his hands. The bright energy that made Charles, himself was replaced by a ghastly, pale man whose face lingered with evil. 



“My Francis did not understand what was going on, he thought he saw the worst of what he experienced but that was just the start.” Grandma trembled as she opened the first page of the book which displayed the single Polaroid picture.



The soldiers did their usual special training for the day, each of their faces when they trotted out of the meeting room portrayed a sickly, empathetic glance as they strolled towards their bunks for the night.



The air was fresh and welcoming as Charles and Francis walked out of the building and into the night. There was an odd silence between them, the only sound was their heavy breathing and low grunts. The destination seemed to drag on for longer, as the both of them headed up the hill, that was when they first grasped it. 



“W-what is that…?” Charles stuttered as he wiped the exhaustion from his eyes.



The street lamps flickered on near them like a domino effect, displaying the large field. The young males were stunned their eyes drawn to what appeared to be a yellow tent propped up evenly on the side.




Francis couldn’t help but sense that chilling feeling creep down his spine. However, both men dismissed the unusual tent and headed back to their barracks to sleep.




BANG.



BANG.




BANG.




The thoughts of the tent disappeared from Francis’s mind as each soldier was awoken by the banging of the sergeant on the door.



“ALL OF YOU GET UP NOW, AND LINE UP OUTSIDE IMMEDIATELY. HURRY UP!!” He screamed as the door slammed shut and each soldier groaned in exhaustion. 


The morning overcame the night very quickly, the soldiers slipped on their usual clothes and rushed outside to meet with the sergeant who demanded them to line up in an upright formation and hold a bayonet in their hands, like they practiced.


The faint sound of snapping and a flash alerted Charles as he quickly swept behind Francis.


“H-hey.. Iverson, how’s it going?” He greeted dryly as Francis turned around and said.


“Im alright. Just confused on why we are here..” 



“Well… I’m not doing what they tell me to do. Like what my momma says, if something feels or tastes utterly bitter for you, don’t drink it or find a way to sweeten it up - leave it.” Charles stated as he heard a chuckle from behind him.


“You sure your momma knows what she is talking about, Everett?” Charles turned to face a smirking man as laughter resonated within the line behind him.


“You watch your mouth Demetrius, don’t you talk about my momma like that..” Charles spat, the rage seemed to build up piece by piece then he turned back to the line.



Francis knew he was next in the line.


Demetrius did not fear Charles, instead he continued to mock him. Each word or noise edged deeply into the boy, the rage fired up and up into large flames, then..



Silence.




Francis was next. But his eyes were focused on Charles that grabbed the Demetrius behind him and slammed the boy onto the floor whilst he bashed his fists into the man’s face repeatedly. It was as if, there was nothing left on the young bloke, no sympathy or respect, no formality. Just pure violence.


The scene happened so fast but the words from the boy stuck with Francis. He couldn’t take them out of his head, no matter how hard he tried. Francis couldn’t move, he was detached from the world around him until the sergeant wavered his attention and he stared coldly at the camera, the noise of yelling and beating filled air.




“Say, cheese!”




SNAP.



Silence overcasted Francis’s mind, the thoughts and feelings - his beautiful girlfriend that had no idea what was going on, it never bothered him because he just couldn’t think. Only observe.



After a while, the soldiers were back to training, holding the ropes whilst climbing up the large wooden wall. They weren’t good enough, they slumped and let go of the rope. The energy and the will to serve their country was the only remaining thing that bled out of their dead souls.



Francis wrote a lot of things in his small leather book, he was obsessed because he knew that it was the thing that kept him sane. He wrote about the incident and what followed after that was a series of fights and tortures within the night, some soldiers would go out and come back inside and provoke anyone they’d desired, that soldier would get beaten and they always said the same thing. And he didn’t know why.

 

But that’s they came along.



A soft knock at the metal door that was already propped open and a beautiful lady stood in the entrance, the sunlight seething through the gloomy room.



For a moment, Francis assumed it was an angel sent down from Heaven. Her soft peachy skin and light hazel eyes that danced upon each soldier - she wore a light yellow coat with a small symbol on the side of it with her white shoes and brown shiny long hair.


“Hello there, gentlemen! My name is Cornell Walters, and I am apart of a vast company that we think you would love!” Beamed the lady as she smiled widely showing her pearly white teeth.



There was a long silence throughout the bunk until one of the soldiers asked,


“What… w-what are you talking about…?”



The lady peered at the grim, pale faced men that stood there taking in this woman. Their bloodshot eyes and trembling hands, some had bruises, scratch marks and dried blood from cuts on their arms and body but others barely had any visible.



“Well, why don’t you lovelies follow me. We were in the process of packing up and leaving, however it is a delight for all of you to catch a glimpse of it before we go.” She chimed, as the soldiers looked at each other confused. Francis on the other hand, didn’t hesitate to grab his book and follow this woman outside onto the field.




All the weary soldiers trailed after Cornell Walters, her hair fluttered against the soft wind that hugged each man reassuringly. 



They walked across the field to the large tent that had many people in the same light yellow uniform. Francis glanced at the symbol that displayed a small circle and dots that surrounded it, like a sun. He couldn’t keep his eyes off the equipment that they used - they had no care in the world as they gently packed the belongings in white boxes with the same symbol planted on it.



Cornell Walters stopped in her tracks and watched the soldiers take in the scenery. 



“What do you call this, company” added one of the soldiers, all the men turned back, also pondering the same question.





Before anyone could utter a word, a faint sound of engines bellowed through the field. White Morris Motor cars were seen driving towards them as they parked evenly together near the working tent. The lady waved at the cars then turned to us - with a smile that stretched wider than ever, she asked.



“Would you care to join us? It will only be two days!” 



The soldiers hesitated, they didn’t understand what she was talking about. How could they possibly join her when they were training. But, Francis didn’t listen because he could detect the presence that stood next to him. It was Julian. 





“Heureux campa,”  The lady chirped at the confused but intrigued faces that peered back at her. They desired whatever this lady was offering, some stepped forward with pride hoping that whatever they were feeling would go away soon enough - whatever was going on in this training facility wasn’t correct and Francis wanted to know why.



He strode forward but a tough hand tightened around his arm, the nails digging into Francis’s as he turned around with a stoic expression plastered across his dull face.




“Are you sure you want to go with them?.” Julian shot firmly. Francis could see the arrogance that he previously witnessed before -  fade into a mixture of trepidation that coursed through his body.



“Yeah, why not..” Francis replied bluntly not a single emotion in his tone of voice.



“Look. I know more about this, than you do, I’m serious.” Julian sternly whispered, as he watched the sergeant talk to the lady whilst some of the soldiers entered the cars that silently watched the two.





“What the fuck are you talking about…—“




“They are not good. Do you even know the name of this company you dumbass…” Julian snarled, still holding Francis’s arm with a tight grip as he looked away in guilt.



“What do you know?…” Francis hissed. It was if those words stabbed Julian like knives, clutching and tearing the only fragments of truth and honesty that remained in the young man, his eyes now staring at the soft grass and the murmuring of soldiers, each of them desperately sitting in the back of the cars that lined behind one and another. 



Silence.





“Tell me what the fuck your talking about.” Francis repeated a bit louder than before, as he noticed fear linger in Julian’s eyes.



“They rupture you first to see the body’s perception to a distressing event. How do you react? How do you function after it? They monitor you. Can you do a simple task without shutting the world off.”



Julian couldn’t move, his attention jittered to the cars and the tent that was now being taken down then back to Francis who had a cold glare, staring back at him.

He then continued.


“What could it exceed?. Would it maximise better work from everyone across the world if they were jubilant? Think about it Iverson. These people are testing us and you really want to give into that..?” Julian demanded, however, Francis peered back at the group of soldiers in confusion then back at Julian.



“How do you know this..?” Francis shot.



“I.. i can’t tell you right now but we-we got to—“





“Francis Iverson and Julian Parker, please join us it will be an honour to have such brilliant men” Cornell Walters smiled, holding her hands out like she was showing a famous painting to the rest of the soldiers.





The lady turned back to the cars that were evenly spread out in rows, an unsettling feeling swayed into Francis as he turned back to Julian.



“You realise what it is like to loose a child. It’s something that holds you down forever you cannot outrun grief because it just has a way of biting back at you… Doris needs me. My girlfriend… needs me because we are being confined everyday. If there is a way to stop this suffocation, anything. Then I will take it.” He concluded, the breathing from Julian became more faster, more agitated.




“What the fuck do you mean.. did you not hear m—“ 




“Give this to Doris Iverson.”



Francis handed Julian the leathered book as he felt his grip tighten against the man, enough to leave a mark — but he simply pulled the clutch with nothing plastered across his face.




“Just visit her when you can. If she worries, tell her i’ll be back as soon as I can.” he said, walking away towards the one of the cars and hopped in.




Julian watched the cars descend from the grass and to the black metal gate that opened and closed.



Gone.





Silence.









“Where did they go…?” I whispered, barely hearing my own words from the repetitive drumming of my heart.




Before anyone could say another word. Julian who’s fists clenched in pure rage, said.



“Doris…we both know that there is more to this story, how-how could you just sit there and not say the full details..” he croaked placing his hand on top of his grey curly hair. 




“Claire is at that age where she needs the story on how it is supposed to be, especially when she doesn’t have the parents to guide her—“




“What did the men say?” I heard myself ask, my hands trembling in my lap.




“What do you mean dear…—“




“Y-you said all of them said the same thing when they got beaten…well…what did they say?”



She flipped the multiple pages of the book then handed it to me.




I touched the small old leathered book and felt a sense of dread kick in.


I glimpsed at the page, my mouth agape in horror as my eyes were drawn to Doris and Julian, then back at the book. The inevitable feeling that buried itself inside of me. 




My entire focus was on the two words that I somehow could not get out of my head. 




“no…war.”
