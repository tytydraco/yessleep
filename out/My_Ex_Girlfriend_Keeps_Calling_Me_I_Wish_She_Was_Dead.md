I keep getting calls from my Ex Girlfriend.  She was the absolute love of my life and the person I wanted to spend eternity with. However now, I just wish she was dead.

I met Alyssa in 2011. You only get a few perfect moments in your life and that meeting was one of them.  Every leaf that fell to the park ground during that autumn came together like a puzzle pieces, leading me directly to her.

Getting her number was easy enough, as simple as asking and soon our relationship grew. Technology had just provided us with the ability to talk to each other during every moment of the day and we took full advantage if it.

She would constantly ask me how my day was going, whether I had eaten and if anything upset me. I reciprocated those messages. She truly cared about me and it felt like I had found the perfect person. Until we started spending time together.

As all relationships go, Alyssa and I eventually spent the night together. Again, it was perfect, just like our relationship had been up to that point. Unfortunately things started going quickly downhill.

I woke up late that night to whispers from my kitchen. Slowly getting out of the bed and peeking around the corner, I found Alyssa standing there alone. She was talking, of course to no one, but it seemed liked she was having a very serious conversation. Her body was stiff and it seemed like she was almost afraid of something.

When the conversation ended, she started walking backwards back to the bedroom, one step at a time,  never taking her eyes of off the imaginary thing she was talking too. I quickly got back into bed and pretended to be asleep.

Over time I overheard more and more of these conversations and each time the tone in her voice got more urgent. It seemed like she had been instructed to do something she really didn't want to do.

Everything else about Alyssa was perfect, but I couldn't shake these random moments she had. She would stop and stare into corners as if something was there, she would quickly look behind us as we walked. Not to check if something was following us, but instead to make sure that something was following us. Than she would walk backwards for a few steps.

Eventually I cracked, I couldn't take her strange behavior anymore and asked her what was going on. I didn't expect her answer.

Now we all have our own histories and I was far from perfect in my past, however Alyssas past was darker than I imagined. She had grown up in a commune in the mid to late nineties and spent the first five years of her life under the teachings of a leader. 

Mason Grimes was a strict man and every child in the commune had to be brought to him and raised by him. There he taught them the importance of their beliefs. According to Mason, when the time was right, they would make a sacrifice and be immortal forever. That sacrifice would make sure their spirits lived on, even if there bodies withered away.

This was scary enough, however things got darker. The time came for the commune to make their sacrifice. The final day of 1999, as the clock struck midnight they gathered in an opened field and did what was necessary. 

Alyssa never told me exactly how the commune members took their own lives, but she did tell me that there was so much blood that when it was her turn, She found herself unable to do it.

On the first day, of the year two thousand, Alyssa was found by law enforcement in a field with ninety nine other bodies. This Included her parents. They lead her away and as she took a final look at the sacrifice, she walked backwards away from it.

Over the years she had learned to deal with the trauma of that day, she had seen a number of psychologists and medical professionals and according to her she had put the event in the past. Except for one thing.

I should have never asked her what that one thing was. 

She opened up to me about so much, she figured it was fine to open up about the rest.

You see there was ninety nine sacrifices that day, there should have been a hundred. Because Alyssa couldn't end her life, the sacrifice was never complete and those people never found eternal life. Instead they found a tormented life, as their bodies lay in graves, their spirits followed her around. 

There's always so much blood around her, or at least that's what she told me, every one who died that day, including her parents, were always around her. Begging her to take her life. Their wounds still clearly visible, their movements hindered by those wounds. 

I was scared but she was the love of my life, I promised her I would find her help, I promised to take care of her. I assumed that it was just trauma but unfortunately I was wrong.

The next week, Alyssa went through with it. I won't tell you exactly what she did, but I came home to so much blood. It was both on the floor and the ceiling and Alyssa was lifeless.

Over time I had to let to, I had seen psychologists and medical professionals and eventually I learned to deal with my trauma. 

Until last month.

Alyssa called me, not on a phone or computer. She called my name, she was standing behind me. Her body still injured, the inside of her head visible. She stood there, blood everywhere and told me how beautiful the after life is. Now everywhere I go, she follows me, walking backwards, half of her head sagging on her shoulder, telling me that I should join her.
