It all started with that damned earthquake, I know that now, before, I might have said it started with the, er… ‘incident’ but now I know it started with the earthquake. I was just a little 6 year-old boy, doing kindergarten in a school, a bare brick building out in the middle of nowhere. It was just bush, trees, and roads for miles, barely civilised except for the occasional neighborhood or lone house. My teacher, Mrs. Almond was teaching us something. She was an old and kind lady, her eyes were often covered by her spectacles and wisps of gray curly hair fell down into her face every now and then during her teaching. I remember whenever she was in the room, I could smell her faint flower perfume. Anyway, during her teaching, the earthquake happened. It was just a slight rumble, and what sounded like rock splintering away in the distance. We were just little kids, so of course we were super interested in the earthquake, at least most of us. I was more frightened to be honest, I was only a little kid, give me a break! What little kid wouldn’t be afraid of the deafening sound of an earthquake? When it was recess, we could hardly control ourselves! We were talking about it non-stop to each other. I remember thinking it was way more interesting than Mrs. Almond was teaching us. Despite my fear, I try to sound brave, trying to sound more interested than afraid.

“That was so cool!” I stammer out.

“Yeah!” Jacob says, my friend, agreeing with me and enthusiastically shaking his head, he certainly wasn’t afraid, at least I don’t think so… 

“What was it?” Matt asks, another one of my friends.

“It was a…” I pause to think of the right word-”A earthquack!” I say, pronouncing the word incorrectly so that the ‘quake’ in ‘earthquake’ sounded like ‘quack’, the sound a duck makes. Thinking back, that little mistake gave me quite the laughs. Ah, good times… Jacob laughs before correcting me,

“No! It’s called an earthquake!” He says, putting heavy emphasis on the ‘quake’. Just as he finished talking, heavy raindrops slowly pattered down from the clouds above. We looked up and saw dark thunder clouds, threatening to rain down on us. The faint smell of rain wisped around our nostrils.

“Come on little ones, under here.” Said a teacher on supervisor duty. I was always annoyed when the teachers told us that, why couldn’t we play in the rain? Whenever I asked the teachers they said I would ‘get sick’ and ‘get a cold’. Pft, liars, I remember when I was 12 or so, I played in the rain and I never got sick, is that normal? Anyway, enough of this, she gestured over to the entrance of the classroom. There was a little section between the class and the yard that had a little roof. The supervisor wanted us to get under there to stay dry. We rushed under the roof along with many others, chattering excitedly amongst ourselves, because when it started to rain during a break, the teachers would let us watch cartoons! 

“What cartoon do you guys want to watch?” Mrs.Almond asks us, getting up from her desk as we spill into the classroom. While all the other kids shouted the names of the cartoons they wanted to watch, I suddenly realised that Matt wasn’t with us.

“Hey where’s Matt?” I ask Jacob, turning around to face him. 

“He’s right…” Jacob trails off and looks around the stuffed classroom. When we couldn’t see him in the classroom, we turned around to face the yard. As we did, the single splats of raindrops became a steady sprinkling and gradually built up. Matt was standing in the middle of the school yard, on the handball courts. He was facing the other way, the way that faced the wire fencing. It was weird man, I remember thinking that ‘He’s facing the wrong way…”. Yeah, that was the exact phrase, facing the wrong way. I don’t know why but that gave me chills as I rolled it around in my mind. Jacob stood up and walked to the doorway of the classroom. Mrs.Almond notices and pauses the cartoon that she had begun to play.

“Jacob! What are you doing?” Mrs.Almond asks in a stern voice, and everyone turns to look at Jacob. She follows Jacob’s gaze and her eyes widen as she sees Matt standing in the yard, getting soaked by the rain. I remain in my seat, watching Matt. Matt just stood there, motionless. A bolt of lightning sparked in the distance and was shortly followed by a sharp crack of thunder. The rain now was showering down rapidly, completely saturating Matt.

“Hey, Matthews! Get back here!” Mrs.Almond shouted, but it was no good. Matt took a step towards the fence just as another flash of lightning struck. Only now did I feel uneasy, I had the strangest feeling. It was like I knew something bad was about to happen. Mrs.Almond continued demanding Matt to come back to the class but Matt just kept on walking towards the fence. When Matt reached the fence, he put his hands on the wires and turned back to face us. As he did, I was blinded by another flash of lightning, and the sound of the kids around me, screaming, filled my ears. Now, I swear this is true, I am 100% certain I saw what I saw. Before the flash of lightning, I swear I see a figure on the other side of the fence, a black blurry figure. The thunder quickly followed, shaking the ground slightly and shaking the panes of glass on the windows. Matt was gone, and what remained was a hole cut open in the fencing… The rest of the day was a blur, we got to go home early and while I was waiting for my father to pick me up, authorities showed up at the school to investigate. I didn’t like them, they were big scary men to me and I was afraid of them, just like the earthquake. Deep down, I had this strange thought that they wouldn’t find anything. At least 5 minutes before my dad picked me up, I walked over to a police officer, one that looked like he was in charge while he was scrawling something down on his notebook. I had decided, despite my fear, I needed to alert someone on what I saw.

“Hey, excuse me. I think I saw someone on the other side of the fence before Matt was gone…” I say, dropping my voice to a whisper. The man looked down at me, eyebrows raised in an unbelieving way.

“Could you repeat that please?” The police officer asked, all serious now. I repeated what I had initially said. The man chuckled, but not a humorous one, a fake, deep laugh. He puts his hand on my shoulder and drops to his knees to match my height.

“Listen mate, you probably just imagined it.” The officer said, dismissing my concerns. He rose quickly and walked away. Of course, I was just a little stupid kid to him and he dismissed me, of course he did, because little kids like me say weird things all the time. 

“But sir, I swear I-” I begin but the screeching of tires on the pavement stops me. I whirl around and see a black Subaru, the gleaming license plate reading: DT 57 LM. My dad had just arrived, in the car he named ‘Sebastion”. Pathetic, who names a bloody car? Anyway, I walk out into the parking lot and I pull open the door before hopping in. My father immediately asks me what happened at school today, a bit concerned and curious. I gave him a brief summary, stuttering madly, before pausing, I decided I was going to tell him about the figure I had seen. I take a deep breath and blurt out:“I saw someone, he was on the other side of the fence! I think-I think he took Matt!” My dad looks at me in the same unbelieving way the officer had.

“Son, have you ever heard of someone choking to death on their own testicles?” He asks, saying the words slowly, throwing me off guard.

“What’s a tesicle?” I ask, mispronouncing the word. My dad laughs a final time before he goes silent, silent for the rest of the trip… That was a long time ago, 29 years to be exact. But the reason I bring this up is because today, when I was coming home from work, the road I always take home was closed for some construction work. I was a bit annoyed as that route was the quickest way home, but nevertheless, I took another route home. Now, the thing is, I still live in the same area, the same isolated suburb in Australia. So when I took that different route, I passed my old school, the school where the ‘incident’ happened… Memories came rushing back to me as I glanced over at it, vague and nostalgic memories. Ever since then, I always wondered about Matt. What the hell happened? Who or what was that figure on the other side of the fence? Is Matt still alive, out in the bush somewhere? These questions often swirl around in my cranium often, it's been distracting me. My wife, a beautiful lady named Daina Haggins, has said I've been ‘distant’ lately. I asked her what she meant by that.

“You’ve been staring at nothing in particular and your eyes are glassy, they have this distant quality to them.” She remarked. The thoughts of these past events have been distracting me greatly, and I am going to put an end to it! I’ve finally decided, with a lot of courage and commitment, that I’m gonna find out what the bloody hell happened to Matt.
