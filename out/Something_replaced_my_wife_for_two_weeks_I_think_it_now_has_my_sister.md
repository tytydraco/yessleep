Last year my wife Suzy had to go on a business trip to Canada. But something else came back in her place.

I already had a bad feeling when I took her to the airport, but didn't say anything because I knew she had some fear of flying anyway and I didn't want to scare her.
She had promised our young son that she would call every day, which she did for the first week. Then communication stopped completely. She didn't answer messages or answer the phone. I started to worry, but tried not to let on and told myself that she was probably just busy and also tried to calm our son down that way. Even though I knew something was wrong. We were the kind of couple who were together all the time and she had always said in our calls how much she missed us both.
Quite a while went by without any sign of life from her. I thought that if something had happened to her, someone would call me, right?
The day her business trip was to end, my son woke me up at 2am because he was having a nightmare. He said that in his dream he saw Suzy as an eerie figure with completely dark eyes. Today I wonder if that was some kind of vision.
I calmed him down, but then we both had a very restless sleep.
Then I waited several hours for a message from Suzy about when I could pick her up from the airport. But I didn't get any message.

Instead, I heard a knock on the front door at noon. I opened the door and Suzy was standing in front of me. I greeted her and our son ran up to her joyfully and hugged her. But she just stared blankly into space.
"My suitcase was stolen" is all she said. I thought maybe she was tired, though she wasn't acting normal. She also acted coldly toward our son throughout the day.
In fact, she just stared out the window of our bedroom all day. When I or our son entered the room, she only looked at us briefly and turned back to the window. I think she also whispered something that I didn't understand.
Two weeks went by and every day was the same. I woke up, my wife was already awake and staring out the window. Then we ate breakfast. Suzy said she wasn‘t feeling well and went back to the window in our bedroom. I had stopped working after our son was born because Suzy was earning more. So I noticed how emotionless she was the whole day.
She exchanged no more than two words with us.
But the scariest part came at the end of those two weeks. 

I finally had enough of Suzy's behavior. When I would call her on it, she would usually just keep quiet. But I had had enough. I was thinking all the time what could have happened on the business trip. I was beginning to wonder if she was having an affair. But no, it was something else.
I had put our son to bed that evening. Suzy stared out of the window again. When she wanted to go to bed, I addressed that I was tired of her acting so cold and that it hurt me. And our son, who was already asking if his mother didn't love him anymore. Besides, everything in the household and what concerned our child was left to me. 
As always, she just kept silent and stared at me. This time I looked her directly in the eyes. And then I saw something. Suzy's eyes are blue. But the eyes I was looking into were brown. And the longer I looked at Suzy, or whoever or whatever was standing there in front of me, the darker they got.

"Who are you and what have you done with my wife?", I asked in horror, as I realized that it wasn’t my wife. I know that wasn't the smartest move. The person in front of me started grinning strangely. At the same time, she started whispering strange things. Her eyes got darker and darker. At some point they were completely black. I don't think I need to say that I was overcome with pure fear at that moment. I thought I would not survive this.
"What are you?", I asked as my blood ran cold. I backed away from her more and more. I was sure I wouldn't survive it anyway. The creature didn't answer again. It just kept grinning at me. I had never felt this fear before. I walked backwards and suddenly I felt something behind me. My heart was beating fast anyway, but at that moment I was even more frightened. Behind me was my son, who was awakened by a very bad feeling. I will never forget his fear-filled expression, as well as the black eyes and the sinister grin of the creature that looked like Suzy. I didn't really think this would work, but I picked my son up and ran out of the house. I thought the creature would catch us. But I had to at least try. My sister lived across the street from us. I ran to the house and started ringing her doorbell. It was nighttime and my sister Mia was quite confused when she saw both of us in our pajamas and with fear-filled faces.

I remembered that there was a key to Mia's house in my house. What if the creature would enter the house?
But the creature didn't come. I only saw from Mia's window that it was staring at us from the window of my house, too. Probably with the same grin.
I tried to explain it to Mia, but of course she didn't believe me. Besides, she said something that gave me even more goosebumps. She hadn't seen Suzy at all in those two weeks. Later I learned that no one had seen "Suzy" except me and our son. 
My son and I stayed with my sister for a while. Although she didn't believe us, she realized how distraught we were. 
A day later, we got a call from an unknown Canadian number. I picked up and heard Suzy's voice. It was the real Suzy. She told me that she had been trying to reach me because she had had an accident and had to be treated in the hospital. But now she was feeling better. Also her colleagues who were with her in Canada said that several people had tried to call me again and again.
Now my sister also believed that something was not normal. Why couldn't anyone reach me? And what did the creature who had pretended to be Suzy want? And why did it disappear? And where to?
In retrospect, I can guess the where.

Now it's been about a year since this happened. Fortunately, our son thinks it was all just a nightmare. Sometimes I hope so too, but it was real. As evidenced by the scratch marks that are all over the walls of our house. And the stench.
We sold our house afterwards to a couple who are into horror stories and moved to another town.
You remember how the creature was always staring out the window? And that my sister lived across the street from us? What if it was watching my sister the whole time?  
She's on vacation in Italy right now and not answering calls from anyone, which is very unusual for Mia.
But my son has the same nightmare every night: Mia and Suzy, both with completely black eyes and that grin.
