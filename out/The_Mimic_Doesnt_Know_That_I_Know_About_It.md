I’ve decided to throw it out. To try, at least. There’s no telling if it’ll work and honestly, I’m doubtful. But it’s what I would do if it was normal and hopefully it knows that.



The doll first came into my possession last night. I had woken up on a Monday morning to find myself alone in the house. Sleep tugged at my eyes and pressed down around my head. The cold floor shocked my feet as I took my first dizzying steps of the morning. I felt the morning-after haze of a night of substance and ill-advised decisions, struggling over to a wardrobe mirror with an all too familiar ache in my jaws.



Now at the mirror, I took a proper survey of the damage. There were the fleeting worries which were smudged, crusty makeup and ragged hair – but there were the more physical stains of my sunken, tired eyes and pale skin. Above all my worries rose the taste that was quickly becoming more prominent in my mouth, a taste like cigarette butts and profuse vomiting. I swung open my bedroom door and made for the bathroom.



It was there when I passed through the living room to get to the bathroom, I’m certain. I just hadn’t noticed it yet. Maybe that was what it wanted.



In the bathroom, I splashed water on my face and spat into the sink. I’ll spare you the vivid description of what came out of my body, but I’ll mention it wasn’t pleasant. The hurry to the bathroom had brought to my attention another symptom of the previous night that wouldn’t be washed away so easily – a throbbing migraine.



Back into the living room turning, I noticed what I thought at the time to be a person sitting on my couch. I froze where I stood, a pleasant adrenaline bolted through my system. When the world stopped spinning and my eyes focused, I was able to make out that it was only a doll. A human-sized Raggedy Ann doll. A friend must have left it there, maybe as a gift (or a joke) for my hangover.



It sat at the corner of the chair, leaning back as a normal human would. Soft streams of morning light filtered through the window above it and lit its red hair.



I found it unsettling for a moment, as I gently stepped closer to the couch, but I had always liked plushies. I tended to name them too. Maybe one of my friends knew that and it was nothing but a sweet gift.



I was hesitant to touch it. I thought that maybe if I did, it would spring to life and do… and do what? Even if it sprang to life, it was made to be completely out of soft cotton and wouldn’t be able to harm me. It was *supposed* to be made completely out of cotton, I thought. The most frightening realization would be that it had bones.



My hand crept towards its forearm. I found my attention intermittently drawn scuttling toward its face out of paranoia or fear. When my grip finally constricted around the doll’s forearm, I found no kind of skeleton and I was glad. Nothing but cotton.



I sighed and threw her over my shoulder, carrying her to my bedroom. I deliberated on a name for the doll and decided I would name her Wendy – after the fast-food character – because of her red hair. Afterwards, I went about my morning routine, albeit sluggishly, on account of the throbbing headache. I think it was probably my lack of caution (along with my stupid love for plushies) that saved my life that morning.



That night, after coming home from work – and then the bar, I dreamt that I was witness to something that I was not supposed to have seen, like vitriolic comments muttered under someone’s breath as they walked away.



The doll – Wendy – had gotten up from where I left her sitting on the edge of the nightstand and was now dancing at the foot of my bed. The dance was like what you would see a mascot doing at Disney, maybe. Not threatening or hostile, maybe not even mocking, but it was this very same lack of open hostility that frightened me so. I quickly shut my eyes and rolled over to face the wall, focusing on the darkness and the soft hum of my air conditioner.



It was almost comical just how quickly I accepted that the doll was alive. We’ve all seen the movies where creepy dolls move to more and more contrived positions and then become openly antagonistic against their owners. I’ve always kept certain superstitions and beliefs that dipped or even fully submerged themselves into the occult, so it wasn’t that far of a reach that Wendy was cursed.



When I awoke, I gave an idle glance to the foot of the bed, where Wendy crumpled and folded into a pile of clothes and hair. The singular thing about the situation was that it didn’t know I was aware of what it was, and that terrified me. The question: “What would happen if it knew the game was up?”



She took pleasure in the hunt; she took pleasure in the reveal. She was not much different than I, in that she was playing out a show and was delighted by it. I was forced into a performance with a role I didn’t want. But I had gone off script. I know something I’m not supposed to know yet.



If I act on what I know, I might force the play into an early climax. When I toss it into a garbage bag, the mimic would come to life and birth a more horrifying, practical form, made to tear and gouge and bleed and break. Maybe if I even looked at it with too scrutinizing an eye, it would panic.



I don’t want that.



Right now, I’m lying in bed trying to keep my focus on my phone and stop myself from taking intermittent glances at where it lies crumpled on the floor, hoping it doesn’t realize what I’m thinking. Does anyone have any ideas on how to destroy the doll? There has to be a way for me to get rid of it without it knowing why.
