It had been years upon years since I had received a true letter in my life. 

*Dear Jame,*

*I am contacting you because of a tragic accident. Belle Turner died unexpectedly on October 25, 2022, at the age of 39, in London, England. I will spare you the details of her passing, just know that this was not expected.* 

*I am the manager of Belle’s estate, writing to you from London, and I am reaching out because you are the father of her daughter, Sophie Turner.* 

*Belle informed her family once she became pregnant that the father was an American man she met one night in a bar whose name she could not remember, and for whom she could remember almost nothing about. Yet, she decided she wanted to keep the child and had no regrets, and no desire to try and track you down. She was happy being a single mother and didn’t want to bring a long-distance father situation into Sophie’s life.* 

*The only detail Belle shared about you was the hotel you were staying at and your physical description. We were able to contact the hotel and get a list of American men staying at the hotel on that date and were able to match the description to your social media profiles.* 

*We request that you take 2-3 weeks to come to London in the next month to work with us to execute a plan for Sophie’s estate and her care.* 

*Please respond to me as soon as you can.* 

*Best,*

*Carol Baines*

I connected with Carol, but was still wary. It took her having a court in London reaching out to me to confirm that I was legally obligated to go and meet with the family to get me to take off work and fly to London for three weeks. 

I found myself in a building which appeared to take up an entire block in Chelsea, one of the nicest parts of London. I was told it was called the Turner Manor upon arrival by Carol, who looked exactly how I thought she would - elderly, stout, bookish, but stern - like a strict grandma. 

I was shown to my room by elevator by Carol, on the top floor of a cavernous and endless manor. She explained the family owned the entire building, it was all connected and various members of the family lived in the property in different flats. 

Dinner was to be served promptly at 6pm. I honestly just wanted to sleep after my 10-hour flight. Yet, the smell of roasting beef did give me some energy after I put my things in my room. 

The smell of the meat did not disappoint. Neither did the opulence of the dining room I ate it in. 

What didn’t disappoint, but did confuse, was the amount of family members I ate with. I sat at a long dining room table lined with what must have been 20 different English people of all ages. 

Oddly, all except my supposed daughter, Sophie, who I was told, was at university, and they weren’t sure when she would arrive. 

Carol didn’t introduce me to anyone at the table and no one seemed interested in talking to me. I was lost in a haze of not drinking for 24 hours plus and the best prime rib I’ve ever had in my life or else I might have been more bothered. 

Instead, I ate three helpings. Each with a tall glass of red wine, and took the elevator up to my room afterwards to sleep it off. 

It was pitch black when I went to sleep. It was pitch black when I woke up. 

*Was it still the same night? Had I slept for like 24 hours?* I wasn’t sure. I went to retrieve my phone and laptop and start to sort my head out, now halfway across the world. 

I couldn’t find my laptop or my phone where I knew I left them. I tried the door to my bedroom and it was locked. 

I heard footsteps out the door. I called for assistance. The footsteps stopped. No one answered. 

I tried the other doors in the room. I eventually found one that was the bathroom. 

Waiting inside the bathroom for me was the oldest man from dinner, gray, hairy, and nude, standing in the near darkness, facing me, and pissing all over the floor. 

I screamed and the old man woke up, yet, didn’t stop pissing all over the floor. He muttered to me as he finished: 

“I’m Hugh. We share a bathroom. My room is on the other side.”

With that, Hugh walked away, leaving the piss all over the floor and disappeared through another door in the bathroom. 

I went back to bed. I was worried and unnerved. There was nothing I could do about it until daylight. 

\-

I grew more worried before daylight. I heard something move above my head - on the other side of the ceiling above me. 

Something was crawling up there, I could distinctly hear elbows and knees hitting against the ceiling…and moving. 

I heard whatever was up there move around for a few seconds in a nondescript circle. 

It lasted for a couple of minutes and then stopped. 

I was never able to go to sleep. 

\-

Morning came. The door was still locked. No one answered my calls through the door and I had no other way to get out. I noticed my room didn’t have windows and no one answered any of the doors in the bathroom, not even Hugh. 

I was still out of it. The jet lag, combined with not sleeping much in the night had me annihilated and I fell asleep sometime in the morning. 

\-

It was dark when I woke up again. I could hear voices in the house. 

I could also see something curious on my arm - something dark, wet, pooled around my elbow. I flicked on a light and quickly saw it was without question blood. 

And it was coming down from the ceiling, softly dripping off of a round, red circle, right above my bed. It was at that moment that I first truly couldn’t believe I had fallen for whatever I had fallen for. I thought about never seeing my family or friends again. 

I knew one thing for certain: *I was going to die in the Turner Manor.* 

The thought and blood quickly became afterthoughts because I could hear an argument somewhere else in the house. What sounded like a young woman going at it with older, deeper voices. 

I listened as closely as I could through the door. I couldn’t pick up what they were saying. I hoped they were arguing about me. All I could do was hope. 

I waited. No one came to my rescue. 

I retreated back to the bed - sleepy again. I started to wonder if there was something in the wine or the food from that dinner and my malaise wasn’t just jet lag. 

I thought of this as I drifted back to sleep. 

\-

I woke up to someone in my room. I sat up in the bed and could see them lurking in the shadows, in the corner of the room, by the bedroom door. It appeared to be a rail thin woman, nearly naked, just in underwear, my age, in her 30s. 

I recognized her, even all these years later. *It was Belle*, but her back was turned to me, and I couldn’t see her face. 

“Belle,” I whispered across the room as I crawled out of bed and moved toward her. 

I was almost too her when she finally turned around. What I remember as a soft, beautiful face was gone. Instead I looked at an emaciated, rotten scowl with skin that reminded me of a wilting apple. 

I started to recoil as I took in her face and could tell she was crying. 

“Please, help me,” she pleaded with me as I kept backing up and away from her. 

I suddenly felt myself back in that hotel room with Belle so many years before. She was sweet, but damaged. Now she was right in front of me again. Even more damaged than I could have imagined. 

My mind racing, I didn’t realize that Belle was now right in front of me, grabbing my face, pleading for me to help her. 

I could smell the rancid sting of death on my nose as Belle pushed her face into mine, her sad mouth just inches from mine. *Was she trying to kiss me?* 

I did my best to squirm away from her. I couldn’t. She got her cracked lips onto mine. It felt and tasted awful. I got an unnerving feeling that her kiss was actually draining the life out of me and I felt myself start to slip away.

The door cracked open just as I was losing control. Belle let me go. In an instant. *She was gone.* 

She was replaced by a young woman who stood in the door and looked at me, grave concern all over her face. 

She asked if I was okay. I was honest. I was not. 

She then introduced herself as Sophie, my daughter.
