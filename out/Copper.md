You can’t get a job in this town. Not without going through one of the temp agencies. Most of the big warehouses and factories use them. They don’t hire people the old fashioned way anymore. They prefer the temp agencies so if you want a job, you play ball with them. 

&#x200B;

I’ve dealt with it for most of my life, since I needed the money. I guess it’s not the worst system in the world. You do what you’ve gotta do, I guess. They still pay you alright and I know a lotta guys who got steady gigs through those temp agencies. I even got one once. It didn’t last, but that had less to do with the jobs and more to do with me. 

&#x200B;

Look there’s no easy way to say this… but a few years back, I was a fucking drug addict. A lot of my paycheques went straight into my arm. At the time, I thought of myself as ‘*functional*’ but then again, most drug addicts think of themselves as functional and most heroin addicts probably don’t realize just how bad they are until they’re digging past rock bottom. Hell, once upon a time - I actually thought I worked better when I was high. Back then, I was 22, had a steady gig at a warehouse and thought I was the king of the goddamn world. Adding in heroin just seemed to make everything better. It didn’t fuck me up too much, it just made me relax… and that was good, right? I didn’t come in to work feeling tired, grumpy or whatever. I was just in a good mood, going about my work with no problems. Sure, I was spending more and more of my paycheque to get high and sure, I might’ve been behind on some rent payments but I was just fine. I was working just fine. 

&#x200B;

Until I wasn’t.

&#x200B;

Then the problem was that I was sober. I wasn’t high. I couldn’t afford to get high and what I could afford just didn’t work for me anymore. That’s what cost me my first steady gig, and it’s what made it so hard to get another one.

&#x200B;

I got dropped by the first temp agency I started working for after the warehouse they’d sent me to caught me going through some of their boxes, setting stuff aside that I could sneak out to pawn later. The second dropped me when they found out about that little incident, and the third one I went to wouldn’t even hire me. 

&#x200B;

By that point, I was broke, way behind on rent and had started doing whatever I had to in order to get money just to feed my habit and forget about how shitty my life had become… and it was around that point that I found out just how much copper sells for.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

It was one of my buddies who tipped me off to it. Dave Williams was a junkhead just like me, although unlike me he could afford his habit and it was the copper that paid for it. He got it wherever he could find it, scrapyards, construction sites, even a few warehouses. Wherever he could get his hands on copper wiring he’d take it.

&#x200B;

And when he told me that he had eyes on a decent sized haul, I didn’t think twice about asking if he needed a hand. Honestly, at the time it didn’t matter to me what the job was. I just needed the money and I didn’t care what I had to do to get it. Dave could’ve asked me for a kidney and I’d have given it to him with a smile. The first job we did together was at a local scrapyard. We cut through the wire fence at night, and went through a bunch of old appliances that someone had dropped off, stripping out the old copper wiring. Dave showed me how to do it and he showed me where to sell it too.

&#x200B;

That night was the first time in a long time that I felt alright. I got high and forgot all of my problems for a little while… that was all that mattered to me. 

&#x200B;

The next time Dave asked if I wanted to join him on a little raid to one of his local scrap yards, I was completely down.

&#x200B;

Working with Dave became the closest thing to a job I could handle for a while. I still tried to get some temp work, but I usually wouldn’t last than a few shifts before they got rid of me. Most of the temp agencies wouldn’t even touch me at all. They knew I was using and they didn’t want me. 

&#x200B;

Well, I didn’t really want them either. I was doing alright working with Dave. Just about every weekend we’d hit up either a scrapyard or a construction site and go after the copper wire. If the haul was good, we’d be in dope for a few more days. Maybe even a week! 

If it was bad, we just tried again later.

&#x200B;

Most of the time, it was bad. But that didn’t stop either of us. Neither did the threat of cops or the few times we got attacked by guard dogs. Those were usually the worst. Not because of what the dogs did, but what Dave did to the dogs.

&#x200B;

He’d been around the block a few times already, so when we went out on one of our little excursions he was usually armed. He carried a .22 with him, and that was more than enough to drop whatever dog they’d left to wander the scrapyard at night.

&#x200B;

I remember that the first time I watched him do it, I felt a sickness rising up in my stomach. The dog had come barking at us out of nowhere and Dave had just pulled his gun and shot it like it was nothing. He hadn’t even seemed to really think about it. Then he’d just looked at me, wondering why I looked so freaked out and said: “*What? You gotta come prepared.*”

&#x200B;

Maybe a person in a better place in life might have used that as a moment of clarity… hell, I almost did. But the dope was more important to me. Whatever reservations I had about shooting dogs were thrown aside. I needed the copper and the dope. That was it. 

He killed about four… maybe five dogs during our little excursions. I never got used to it.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

When Dave came across the Barroso Copper Company, I knew we’d hit paydirt. It was a little ways out of town, on some quiet highway outside of Woodstock but that was a bonus, not a problem. That just meant there was a lower chance of anybody bothering us.

&#x200B;

  “It’s a fucking goldmine, Dylan,” He said and I knew he was right, “Seems pretty quiet at night too. I don’t think we’re gonna have much trouble with this one.”

&#x200B;

Honestly, I couldn’t have cared less whether or not it would be trouble, so long as I got my copper. I told him I was in and two nights later, we headed out to Barroso.

&#x200B;

Barroso’s smelter was a tangled mess of metal tubes and boxy buildings. It was hard for the eye to really follow any of those tubes to make out any kind of cohesive structure. There were just so many of them, and I didn’t understand what most of those tubes even were, other than the fact that there were just so many of them. In the daylight, you could see smoke rising out of the chimneys, but at night the place seemed mostly dark. The smelters still seemed to be burning, but there were only a couple of cars in their empty parking lot. 

&#x200B;

Dave pulled his car into the lot, parking away from the pale greenish street lights that cast a sickly glow over everything. We got out, heading away from the main building and toward a fenced off area on the far side of the parking lot. According to Dave, he’d seen some trucks dropping off scrap around there, and he’d seen some of the workers sorting through it. I guess that was why their ‘scrap yard’ didn’t look like any scrap yard I’d ever seen before. This was something much more organized, with large metal bins filled with discarded copper, already separated from the machines it used to be part of and ready for processing.

&#x200B;

  “Jesus Christ, I’m in heaven…” I heard Dave say as we cut the padlock on the gate and went inside. “We could be fucking rich with all of this shit!”

He ran over to one of the bins that was filled with old copper wiring.

  “How much do you think we can fit in the car?” I asked.

  “I dunno… all of it, maybe!” He said, before trying to grab as much as he could and dragging it back to the car. “Y’know the pawn shops just sell it back here anyway. Wonder if we’ve grabbed any of this stuff before?”

&#x200B;

I didn’t bother replying since I didn’t really care one way or the other. I just took as much as I could carry and helped Dave get it back to the car. We probably could have bought enough dope to keep ourselves stocked for another week at minimum with what we’d already taken, but we still gladly went back for more. 

&#x200B;

The whole time, Dave was laughing like an absolute madman, walking with a skip in his step as he looked back at me, wild eyed and grinning from ear to ear.

  “You know we could get rich off this stuff!” He said, “Bring a big truck next time. I’ve got this buddy, Ryan who could do it!”

  “How much do you think we’d make off that?” I asked.

  “Yes!” 

&#x200B;

He dumped his second load of copper into the back seat of his car and went back for more.

  “Wonder what they’ve got inside,” He said, stopping just short at the copper bins. “Probably a hell of a lot more…”

&#x200B;

He started toward the doors to the main building, although I stopped him before he could get too close.

  “Leave it,” I said. “C’mon. Let’s just grab some more from that bin with the wires and call it a night.”

He pulled out of my grasp.

  “I just wanna see if anyone’s in there,” He said. “I’m only gonna be a second!”

I frowned, but let him go and went to grab some more of the copper from the bin we’d already been taking from. 

&#x200B;

By this point, we probably could’ve afforded enough dope to kill ourselves two or three times over. But I didn’t really care. I wanted it all the same. I looked back toward Dave to see him opening a gray metal door and going inside, and I took my latest haul back to the car, expecting him to be right behind me.

&#x200B;

When he wasn’t, I waited for him although he never came back out. After a few minutes, I figured I might as well go in and look for him. Odds are, he was probably looking bug eyed at whatever they had in there, and trying to figure out how much he could carry away. I just needed to drag him back to the job at hand and we could leave the rest for another night… assuming we were still alive to come back on another night.

&#x200B;

I walked up to the gray metal door and pushed my way in. Immediately the smell of burning filled my nostrils and the stink of it made me cough, but I still made my way inside, looking for Dave. I didn’t call out for him, in case there was anyone inside. I just made my way through the wide open space inside the building, passing by a set of forklifts that were probably meant to move the bins we were pulling our copper out of. 

&#x200B;

It didn’t take me that long to find Dave. He’d gone a short distance into the warehouse we’d entered and was staring intently at something deeper inside. From the corner of my eye, I could see some workers going through a few bins similar to the ones outside, sorting through them to be melted down later.

&#x200B;

I came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder, making him jump for a moment as he looked over at me.

&#x200B;

  “Shit!” He hissed, “The fuck did you do that for?”

  “Come on, car’s just about full. Let’s get out of here!” I said.

&#x200B;

Dave just looked back at the workers.

  “You’re not seeing this?” He asked.

  “Seeing what?”

&#x200B;

I looked up toward the workers, before pausing. I could only really see them from a distance but even from all the way over by the doors it was obvious that something about them was… off. It was hard to say exactly what at first, although the longer I stared the more obvious it became.

&#x200B;

Just about all of these workers looked the same. A fairly short stature with thick black hair. They weren’t completely identical… but it was close enough. It was hard to tell in the low light, but they all looked fairly pale too. 

&#x200B;

They worked diligently, going through the bins, sorting everything diligently. They occasionally spoke to each other but it was hard to make out exactly what they were saying. 

  “The hell are those things…” Dave said under his breath.

  “I dunno, weird people. Can we go?” I asked. I didn’t really want to drag this out any longer than we’d already dragged it out. Dave just shook his head.

  “Nuh uh…” He said, “Those sure as hell aren’t people!”

&#x200B;

I looked again. At a glance they sure as hell looked human, although the longer I looked the less sure I was about that.

&#x200B;

They looked human. But in so many ways that mattered they didn’t. 

&#x200B;

The eyes were all wrong. They were so large and seemed to shine even in the low light, although the people themselves seemed small. The tallest wasn’t more than five feet. They were all quick and silent, darting from task to task with little chatter, laser focused on whatever it was they were doing.

I noticed Dave taking his phone out of his pocket and saw him opening his camera to start filming.

&#x200B;

  “What the hell are you doing?” I asked.

  “We gotta show this to somebody!” He replied, before I tried to rip the phone out of his hands. 

  “Put it down! Let’s just get out of here!”

  “Dylan, fuck off!” 

&#x200B;

He pushed me aside and I hit the ground with a crash. On cue, every pair of large saucer shaped eyes in the warehouse turned to fixate on us. Dave looked right back at them, his own eyes widening in fear. 

&#x200B;

Neither of us said a word, but I was the one with the sense to start running first. From the corner of my eye, I could see Dave already moving to follow me but the wide eyed strangers seemed to move even faster than he did.

&#x200B;

I hadn’t even seen them move, but in what seemed like no time at all they’d made it closer to him, eyes still fixated on him.

  “Jesus Christ!” I heard him gasp, “Get the fuck away from me!”

&#x200B;

I saw him going for his gun and heard two gunshots as I tore through the door followed by Dave’s final screams.

&#x200B;

I didn’t see what they did to him, but I knew that those weren’t screams of fear. Those were the agonized cries of a dying man.

&#x200B;

As I ran back into the scrap yard and back toward the car, I was greeted by shadows blocking my path and green eyes reflected in the low light cast from the factory. Whatever was in there, they were blocking my escape.

&#x200B;

I could see more of them by the door and knew I had nowhere to run. So I did the only thing that seemed to make sense and ran even deeper into the scrap yard, hoping like hell there’d be some kind of exit, somewhere. More green eyed shadows appeared around me, never seeming to move, only seeming to watch. 

&#x200B;

I could see a gate up ahead and tore through it, only to find myself lost in a maze of metal and buildings and staring green eyes. My body froze as I looked around, unsure of where to go next. This was all too much! This was all too confusing! I didn’t know where the fuck I was! I was too fucking sober for this! Fuck, there wasn’t enough dope in the world to make this fine! 

&#x200B;

Terror overtook me completely. I could feel warmth spreading down my leg as my legs gave out from under me and the dark figures with their shiny green eyes drew nearer.

  “Oh God…” I remember babbling, “Oh God, don’t kill me… don’t fucking kill me, God please don’t fucking kill me!”

&#x200B;

I didn’t think they’d listen… if they even understood what I was saying. I’d come to steal their shit, after all, and in the grand scheme of things I was just some lowlife idiot who’d hit rock bottom and started to dig. I was the loser who’d broken down crying and pissed his pants when staring down death. Honestly, killing me probably would’ve been doing me a favor and I just prayed to whatever God might’ve been listening that it wouldn’t hurt too much.

&#x200B;

The dark figures were closer, their wide green eyes all fixated on me. In the faint light from the buildings I could see the outlines of their faces and I could see nothing on them. No emotion at all.

 *“Leave it…”* A low voice hissed, *“Let it run.”*

&#x200B;

I looked up to see that some of the green eyed figures had parted, making way for one who didn’t look that much different from the others, although it carried itself with a certain authority, standing tall above the rest. It’s green eyes burned into mine. In the dim light, I could see the dark blood on its hands. Dave’s blood. Still wet and dripping. 

  *“Let it run,”* It repeated.

&#x200B;

I saw some of the shadows move, and took the hint.

&#x200B;

They were letting me live.

&#x200B;

I wasn’t going to question that. I took the chance to run again, taking off in the direction that the shadows let me.

&#x200B;

It wasn’t long before I found myself back out in the parking lot although Dave’s car was long gone along with whatever copper we’d loaded it up with. That was fine. I ran for the road and didn’t stop running until my body collapsed.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I’ve only ever told my story to a few people over the years. So far, none of them have believed me. They all think I was high off my ass when we broke into the copper smelter… but I was dead sober that night. I *wish* I was high off my ass.

&#x200B;

I got evicted soon after the incident at the copper smelter. I’d fallen way too behind on my rent. And with nowhere to go, I lived rough for a while. Things for a whole hell of a lot worse before they got better.

&#x200B;

But eventually, I did end up getting help through one of the shelters I stayed at. It’s been a long road to recovery, and I’ve still got a long way to go. Not a day goes by that I don’t miss being high. But I’ve learned to live without it.

&#x200B;

I never found out what happened to Dave… and honestly, I don’t want to know. I’ve never gone back to the smelter either. I think it’s better off to stay away from it for good.

&#x200B;

Some days, I wonder why they let me go… maybe it’s simply because unlike Dave, I didn’t try to shoot at them. The first chance I got, I just ran to get away. Maybe they realized I wasn’t a threat to them.

&#x200B;

Maybe.

&#x200B;

But some days, I still see shadows out of the corner of my eye. Or when I’m out on the street, or working a job I might see a stranger with pale skin, black hair and large green eyes watching me. They never come close and they never say anything… but I’m sure they’re watching me. Once I’ve saved up enough money, I’m going to move as far away from this place as I can. Even if I weren’t still afraid of those things hunting me down… I could do with a fresh [start.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)
