**Part 1**

Our heated voices reverberated within the secluded wooden house nestled deep in the woods. The private beauty pageant had descended into chaos as the night dragged on, with contestants confronting the five-member judging panel, hurling accusations of favoritism and nepotism. Whispers of inappropriate relationships between certain judges and contestants ran rampant. In short, the entire event unraveled into a complete catastrophe. I found myself at the center of it all, wrongly accused of trading sexual favors with the judges—an allegation that left me infuriated. And, of course, it was all thanks to Malloy, my relentless rival.



“Admit it, Jass, you slept with the judge—the one with the long hair and nose ring. It’s a fact. Everyone knows it,” Malloy sneered, jabbing her finger at me as **I fumbled with my pockets, pulling out a pen and a note** before shoving them back inside. Suited men behind a large table watched us intently from a remote location, their eyes fixed on a large TV screen standing inches from us.



Malloy was the loudest among the contestants, always the first to accuse others of nefarious deeds, even though she was often guilty of the same things she condemned. In her mind, she could do no wrong and seemed convinced that everyone was captivated by her beauty. Honestly, I never found her all that impressive.



“And what about you, Shiva?” Finnie taunted her. “You were the one raving at one of the female judges in such graphic terms before we even got here. I don’t care that you’re into women, but I do care that you’re trying to twist this contest to your advantage.” 



Shiva shot back, getting into Finnie’s face as if ready to provoke a fight. “You want some? Go ahead, Finnie. Make my day.”



Shiva and Finnie shared a rivalry that defied explanation. At first, I didn’t pay much attention, assuming that competition simply brought out the worst in people, especially among women in a beauty contest. But this was different; the level of animosity between them ran deep, probably stretching back years.



I threw my hands in the air, trying to stem the escalating feuding, which was irritating the suited men watching remotely from the TV screen.



“Enough! Let me remind you that our families paid a substantial amount of money for us to compete in this private contest. My father threw his savings away so I could compete in this beauty pageant! So, here’s what's going to happen. We either reschedule this event for another day and replace the judges or we risk losing everything.”



“We cannot redo this contest. If this childless fighting continues, then I will be forced to notify your parents—the ones who financed your participation. I’m sure that’s not what any of you desire. After all, money doesn't grow on trees, does it, girls?” It’s unclear where the voice stemmed from, there were so many suited men seated at the table. 



Tamar stepped forward, a rare move, she was usually the first one to stay in the back and keep her mouth shut. “Yes, it’s true, but this contest is already tainted. To clear its name, I propose we check the phones of every judge on this panel, just to be sure,” she insisted, turning toward the five judges.



Longboutin, the eldest of the contestants, marched over to the judges’ table, extending her hand with a steely look. ”Give up the goods or face the music.” Longboutin was the rock of the group. She was a powerful, unyielding woman, who reminded me of my own GrandMother. Her presence in this beauty pageant was refreshing and inspiring.



Reluctantly, the judges surrendered their phones to Longboutin, who meticulously checked each one for incriminating messages. The room, once filled with heated arguments, fell into a tense silence.



“This contest’s sullied,” Longboutin yelled, handing the phones back to the judges.



One of the judges, a fit man with a puffy face, leaned forward. “I was careless with someone, but I can assure you that —”



We turned our attention to the suited men on the TV screen, quietly conferring among themselves. It was clear that the beauty pageant was on its last legs, and the thought of not being able to compete in something I had prepared for so long broke my heart.



The suited men nodded in agreement. “Judges, your time has come to an end. The van will take you to the airport, and you will be given tickets to your respective destinations. Thank you for your participation.”



The five judges left their table and exited the residence in silence while the suited men on screen continued. “Sadly, in light of new findings, we hereby shut down the beauty pageant contest and order everyone off the property by noon tomorrow. A van will take you to the airport where you will be handed first class tickets to your destinations. Let’s hope one day, we shall meet again—”



“That’s BS,” I yelled, stepping away from the group of girls, jabbing my finger at the TV screen.



“Jass, I know how much you’ve been wanting to do this, but I—”



“This contest is done for. But we can start another with a whole new set of judges,” I made my case, almost smashing the screen with my fist, so much I was in rage.



“The rules forbid remote judges for this contest, Jass.”



“I’m well aware of that, sir. I was thinking more along the lines of unorthodox ways to restart this contest to zero,” I said, looking straight into the TV screen.



“And what unorthodox ways are those, Jass?”



All of them fixated on my lips like a bunch of hungry puppies. I had this insane thought in my head that I wanted to push out, but I doubted anyone would go along with it. Silence wouldn’t stop me, It never had, so I took a deep breath and let it out.



“We could summon a supernatural force to take charge of the judges' duties, since they can no longer act impartially. I know it sounds crazy. But I’ve read countless books about spirits and rituals. How the world we know may be inhabited by more than just us. It shouldn’t hurt any of us in believing in the unnatural.” 



The suited men displayed poker faces while the contestants turned their eyes away, giggling and coughing to stifle their laughter.



“Alright, Jass, always loved your enthusiasm, but I must admit, you have a heck of an imagination. You’re into the supernatural business, now?”



Everyone hooted with laughter. It went on for a moment before I silenced them with my next line. “What about the other contestants, a year from now? We’d be the subject of ridicule. Fifteen thousand dollars, gone. I doubt each of our parents will take this lightly.”



“Crazy bitch,” Malloy sneered. “Where’s your flying broom? As much as I'd love to see you being the subject of derision, I say we let her do her thing.”



The suited men stood up, ready to leave. “If I want to check on the supernatural, I can just go watch the show, “Supernatural,” one of them quipped, about to turn off the TV.



“No. No. No,” I shouted, shaking the screen as the screen went dark. I looked around as the girls turned away and headed to their respective chambers.



I lay down on the carpet, hands above my head, feeling a wave of disappointment wash over me. I had wanted so badly to compete in this beauty contest. Closing my eyes, I imagined how different this beauty contest would have been without the controversies. I saw myself being crowned by my peers, the cheers echoing throughout the residence. I pictured the moment of returning home, the crown resting proudly on my head, a winning check of one million dollars sitting in my back account, my parent's arms wrapping around me in celebration. But sadly, that future had crumbled into ashes. I finally accepted that I'd be going home empty-handed. But when I opened my eyes, the girls stood around me, their faces carved with stone-cold expressions.



“Have you ever done it before, Jass?” Longboutin asked, her gaze piercing into mine. I jumped off the carpet and faced the girls.



“To be frank with you, Longboutin, I haven’t. But I once overheard my disgruntled grandparents whispering about the rituals, about how to summon a dormant spirit.”



“And tell us, Einstein, how are you so sure there is a spirit in this cabin, or anywhere in those woods?” Malloy scoffed, challenging me.



“Spirits are everywhere, Malloy. You just have to know how to coax them out of hiding,” I replied, bracing for her retort.



“I say we let her try. I’ve got nothing better to do anyway,” Finnie said with a languish stretch. Tired of masturbating.” 



“You have a good heart, Jass. But I fear you may walk into uncharted waters here,” Tamar conceded.



Suddenly, the TV screen flickered to life, revealing an elderly woman in a suit seated at the table. Just moments ago, the table had been occupied solely by men. How odd.



“Hello, how did the spirit summoning go, if I may ask?” The elderly woman inquired.



I stepped closer to the screen. “We’ve just decided to take a leap of faith. But I wonder, what’s your interest in it? And where is everyone?” 



“I’ve always been fascinated by the supernatural, sweetheart. And It’s just me, now. So, when do we get started, Jass?” She asked, strangely over excited about it all.



I walked to the center of the room, feeling a newfound confidence in my role as a leader. 



“Alright, everyone, listen up. I want this place spotless. Check every corner for dust. We’ll need tools, candles, incense, offerings—everything necessary for the summon —”



The elderly woman lit up a cigarette. “No need, girls. There’s a second van outside with everything you need.”



The girls glanced at the woman as she puffed her cigarette and then hurried to get brooms to start sweeping. But I kept my gaze on her, feeling a sense of unease. As I turned to head outside to the van, Malloy rushed past me.  “I’ll handle that part. You just start sweeping, Jass.”



Malloy approached the blue van parked across the street, its trunk already opened, and began unloading the boxes, making four trips back and forth. We emptied the boxes Malloy had brought into the house, under the watchful eyes of the elderly woman on the screen. With everyone’s attention on me, I pulled out a piece of chalk from the boxes and drew a large circle on the floor. The girls placed candles around the circle, and lit them one by one. 



To summon the spirit, I took a bit of *frankincense* and *myrrh* from the boxes, tossed them into a small pot and placed them at the center of the circle.



I turned to the elderly woman on screen. “What about offerings? There were none in the van. Surely, you understand that we must present something of value to the spirit if we hope for it to materialize.”



“Oh, crap, I thought I had a bloodied dead horse in the van. I’m sure we could dig up some dusty rats in the residence. There must be plenty of them.”



Tamar stepped forward, slightly uneasy. “There’s a frozen goat head in the freezer.”



“Then what are you waiting for, a bloody christmas present? Go get it,” the elderly said.



Tamar hurried upstairs to a large kitchen, wrapping her hands around herself as if warding off a chill. Her eyes darted around the room, wide with fear, until they landed on a large fridge in the corner. She hesitated, then opened the freezer door, revealing a frozen goat head inside. With trembling hands, she grabbed the frozen goat head and bolted down the stairs without a backward glance, leaving the freezer door open.



Back at the lounge, Tamar threw the frozen goat head inside the circle and stepped back. Longboutin glanced at her, shaking her head. The elderly woman on screen flicked her cigarette to the ground and smashed it with the hell of her boot. 



“I believe we’re ready. Good luck, girls. And remember, beauty might be defined differently than what you’ve imagined. Keep that in mind. Jass, the floor is yours!” 



I stepped into the circle, as the girls watched with unreadable expressions. Malloy took out her phone and started recording the whole thing. Kneeling on the floor, I closed my eyes, ready to summon the spirit. I heard giggles but I paid no mind to them.



“Monsieur, Jean De La Ville, Frenchman, member of the 1st Light Cavalry Division, honored and proud of his heritage. I call upon you to appear before us, to once again do the right thing, even when hope seems lost. Take over this beauty pageant contest and bless us with your righteousness. For none are as humbled and kind as you in this world of hatred and deceit.”



I opened my eyes to the sound of Malloy’s laughter echoing through the room, while the others deliberately avoided my gaze. My eyes shifted to the TV screen, where the elderly woman was biting her lips in eager anticipation, her excitement palpable—like a dog finally sinking its teeth into a long awaited-bone. I stepped out of the circle, bracing for Malloy to let me have it, and she didn’t disappoint.



“Who the fuck is Jean De La Ville? Some kind of French spirit? I’m going back to my room. I can’t believe I wasted my time hauling those boxes.”



“Wasn’t the 1st Light Cavalry Division a French unit in World War II?” Tamar chimed in. 



Before anyone could respond to Tamar, Longboutin suddenly perked up, her ears catching something we all missed.



“Wait! Listen,” Longboutin said.



Malloy turned back, her eyes wide, like an owl on alert.



A gust of wind swept through the room, drawing our attention, as the lights flickered off. 



A scream pierced the darkness—a voice we all recognized.



“Shut up, Tamar. Stay focused,” Longboutin scoffed.



“Relax. It’s probably just a power outage. No big deal,” Shiva said. 



The lights flickered back on. What happened next left us all stunned, even the elderly woman on the screen stood frozen at the table.



The candles had gone out. 



The frozen goat head had thawed in mere minutes.



And the chalk was levitating in midair, writing legibly words on the TV screen:



**Bonjour Mesdemoiselles. Line up.**



My heart swelled with happiness as I read the message while others reacted with fear.



“Let’s get out of here. For this one time girls, please listen to me,” Tamar whispered.



All of a sudden, someone began pounding on the front door with their fists, yelling in the French language. “Laissez- moi entrer! Laisse moi entrer!,” which means in English - Let me in! Let me in!.



“Is that someone speaking French?” Finnie asked.



“He keeps pounding on the door,” Shiva warned as she saw Longboutin sprinting down the stairs, carrying six butcher knives.



“Here, take these. Stab through the heart—it’s quicker that way,” Longboutin said, handing a knife to each of us.”



“You’re wasting your time, girls,” The elderly woman declared, unfazed by what was happening.



“I’m calling 911,” Tamar said, pulling out her phone but the screen exploded. The same happened to all our phones when we retrieved them.



The knives began to fly out of our hands, crashing into the wall behind us. We turned to see them embedded into the wall, as the levitating chalk wrote on the TV screen:



**Quiet. Outside. Line up.**



The fist banging on the front door stopped. The smile that had briefly crossed my face vanished. I soon regretted awakening the French spirit I once believed to be benevolent, just as my grandparents had told me. 



The elderly woman resumed her smoking. “Do as the spirit says. You all came to be crowned and to win a million dollars. Now it’s time to prove your worth. You’re either a star in the making or a forever apprentice.”



The front door swung open on its own, undoubtedly the spirit’s doing. Gripping each other’s hands, we stepped forward, shaking in our heels. Outside, dozens of eager journalists scrambled to capture our images with antique vintage cameras. We lined up along the lawn, standing motionless as the vintage cameras flashed, capturing our posture and every bit of fear etched on our faces.



Tamar, pleaded. “Please, someone help us.”



But her pleas fell on deaf ears. The blunder I had made summoning the spirit was far from our only problem. There was the elderly woman who clearly knew more than she let on and then there were the journalists—this was supposed to be a private beauty pageant. No doubt they all were in cahoots with the spirit.



“All right, ladies. Time to grill you with the night’s finest questions. It’s interview time! Let’s kick things off with you, Jass. Where are you from, what brought you here to compete, and what would you do with the million-dollar prize if you won? I would’ve gladly ignored the perp, but the choice was no longer mine.



“I’m from Kansas and I want to be crowned. If I take home the million-dollar prize, I plan to refurbish every school in my rural town.” Keeping it straight with these knuckleheads was the easiest way to swat them away like flies. 



The other girls provided a range of shocking and unexpected answers to the same questions posed by the journalists. 



In a condescending and arrogant tone, Malloy announced that she hailed from Alaska and claimed she had been “urged” to participate in this beauty pageant by the organizers(even though we had all been invited through a random drawing). She went on to declare that if she won the million dollar-prize, she would buy the biggest mansion in her hometown, and sell it to any woman for a fraction of the prize, all for the sake of vanity. She further implied that she was the most beautiful woman present, boasting about her looks inherited from her parents.



Shiva was from New York City and chose to enter the competition because she’d always wanted to prove herself to her naysayers. If she won the million-dollar prize, she planned to donate the funds to transgender support groups across the United States.



Finnie hailed from Nevada and was thrilled at the chance to participate in the beauty pageant, not necessarily for her looks, which she admitted were subpar compared to the other contestants. Her sole motivation was the prize money. If she were to win, she’d used it to repay the million dollars she owed her parents after illegally gambling away their money at a casino.



Longboutin’s answers were the most shocking to me. She openly admitted her looks were non-existent and that her participation in the contest was purely for the prize money. Her goal was to hire mercenaries to break into a jail and rescue her father, who was currently being abused by inmates. She went on to reveal that she had once been in a same-sex relationship with a married woman, who later ended up in jail for plotting to kill her husband.



Tamar spoke calmly, though, there was a hint of trepidation in her voice. She recounted how her parents had been killed by their own congregation after an argument, but she couldn’t remember what happened afterward. All she recalled were deputies questioning her about the murder of the congregants and whether she had any involvement. Despite it all, she expressed her happiness at being here and her hope of winning the prize money and the crown. She admitted she had no idea what she’d do with such a large sum if she won.



“Thank you, ladies. Let the games begin. Off we go.” The journalists said, waving us Good-Bye. We turned and climbed the steps back into the house, uncertain of what the spirit had in store for us next.
