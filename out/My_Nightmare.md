 Alone in my house I was, all alone as the day I was bought into this world. Who was I to complain as the day was dark and so was the night. I was of young age as of writing this, just a young man who wanted nothing but happiness. But instead I got this. I was only 11 years old when it happened, although it feels like yesterday. I was sitting on the couch next to my mother as we watched the Saturday night movie. We were laughing and having a good time as we always did, the night didn’t seem anything out of the ordinary, a little colder than usual but otherwise the same. My Mother had lit the fire best to her knowledge as she knew how. As my father had not been here for some time and since his departure she had to make best as she could. We lived in a quite neighbourhood, not many weird things had happened here. But when it did, it surly chose the night for it. My mother was in the kitchen making dinner, it was around half 6, when we heard a knock at the door. I went to run to see who it was, “STOP!!” I heard in the distance. It was Mother, being a wise parent as she was she advised that children should not answer the door unattended. She washed her hands with the rag on the bench and walked towards the door. This is when the trouble began.

She went to answer the door as the knocks got more consistent, “Answer it” I thought to myself, I was so excited to see who it was. She answered the door and a lady was standing there. She was wearing a white coat with matching white gloves and a women’s fedora, she had a huge smile on her face as she asked to use the phone. My mother was a cautious woman and declined politely, “There is a pay phone around the corner I will be happy to spare a dime for its use”. “No, please don’t let me go out there alone, I must use your phone” she exclaimed still with a smile from ear to ear which only seemed to be growing. My mother persisted as usual, “Please, here take this dime. I will not allow people into my home. I have a small child here”. “You don’t understand, this phone call will make a difference for me and you, and your child. Why won’t you let me make this call”. The smile still was on her face and didn’t seem as it would budge, not an inch. As she stared down at me for a moment while my mother searched for the dime. “Here, 2 dimes please. I’m sorry”. My mother closed the door and locked it behind her. She could sense something was not right. Mother shook her head and went back to the kitchen thinking nothing of it. I stared longer at the door, and she was still standing there. Big black shadow just….. standing there. 

Her head, it moved closer and closer, until finally it leaned up against the glass. Then she vanished, ran like a ghost. I had never seen anything like it. Chilled me to the bone, I still remember that chill I felt, like a gallon of fresh ice had gone down my shirt. I moved away from the door and went back to the living room. Mother had just finished dinner and it was time to eat.

The dinner was beautiful I remember it well, my once sore stomach was now in full relaxation. It was finally time to end the night. We laid on the couch as lazy as a cat watching TV. During the night about 12 Midnight. I awoke, the tv had gone to sleep for its nightly snooze and so had mother. BANG BANG BANG on our window in the lounge-room. “Don’t look outside, don’t look outside”. The voice yelled. It sounded like the lady, dear god it sounds like her, that voice. She had come back, but why. My mother awoke from her slumber and ran to the window to see nothing. Pitch black darkness, she was very shaken and so was i. TAP TAP TAP we heard on the front door, “dear god” mother exclaimed. 

She told me to stay on the couch as she checked the front door. “Go away” mother cried. TAP TAP TAP. The suspense was too much, mother opened the door. Silence, dead silent. 5 minutes had past, and I was in shock, laid out on the couch in pain of what is going on. I mean it was silent. No sound of mother, nothing. I even cried out to her. “Mom”. Nothing, all I heard was silence. I could feel the cold breeze rushing in, the door was till open. I had to go look, I walked to the door and mother was gone. But the lady was up against our open door turned away from me and her head gently lay upon it. And all the while that grin was still from ear to ear.
