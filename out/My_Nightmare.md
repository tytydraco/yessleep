Waking up in the middle of the night has been one of my worst fears since childhood. It's the reason why I sleep with a light on every night. The thought of the darkness potentially concealing something or someone from my tired gaze terrifies me to my core. If I had to guess where this fear of mine came from, it would be from the nightmare I had as a child.

I was around the age of five or six. I remember waking up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. The bathroom was on the opposite end of the house from my bedroom, so despite my fear of the dark, I braved my way to the bathroom through the darkness of the house. After I had done so and relieved myself, I quickly ran through the darkness to my room, closed the open door, and jumped back into bed. 

I hid underneath the covers, like any scared kid would. I hid myself from whatever my young mind could conjure up to hide in the darkness. I remember nearly drifting back to sleep before I heard a sudden knock on my door. I can't exactly remember the thoughts that went through my head at that moment. Without much forethought into what I was doing, I was already standing in front of my door, turning the knob to open it.

I was confused, the kind of confusion that overwhelmed me at that age. I was back in front of the bathroom. My bedroom door opened to the bathroom that was on the other side of the house. Not only that, but I wasn't even in my bedroom anymore. Instead, I was back in the hallway, holding open the bathroom door.

Running back to my room in a panic, the door to my room was now closed. I just opened it, didn't I? I know, or I thought I knew, that it was the door to the bathroom, but I was just in my room. Call it as you will, it was a nightmare after all. From behind my door, I could hear strange noises, familiar but still strange. It sounded like someone was in my bed. Ruffling around in my sheets. I knocked on the door. The door then opened without me having to turn the knob. I was back in front of the bathroom.

This same thing occurred multiple times. I remember vividly running back to my room and knocking on the door, only for it to open, and I’d be back in front of the bathroom. It felt like an infinite loop that’d seemingly never end. That is, until the very last loop. On my way back to my room, I noticed the back door of the house was slightly cracked open. In young and dumb curiosity, I walked over and opened it all the way. At that age, my parents lived out in the countryside, under normal circumstances, what would greet me behind that door would be tall pine trees and two pitbulls that my parents had chained up outside. What greeted me behind that door in that dream was something that has stuck with me to this day.

I saw a man. A tall, lanky man with outstretched hair and large, red pupils. He stood in front of me for what felt like eternity. He then put a finger up to his lip and slowly began to walk backwards. His body swayed from side to side in a rhythmic motion as he took each step. He kept going until he backed himself into the treeline. From that point, all I could see was his red pupils that glowed in the moonlight. He finally stopped walking backwards, but he never took his eyes off of me, and I never took mine off of his. Once more, it felt as if neither of us would break our eye contact with each other, and I then heard a knocking sound. I looked away from him. Then I looked back. His face was right in front of mine.

I woke up terrified and crying after that. Since then, I strangely haven’t had many dreams in my life. No nightmares either. I don’t want to ever see him again. So I guess I’m glad I don’t dream.
