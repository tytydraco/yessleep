I'll start by saying that I have no plans of going back, nor will I be able to after what I'm going to do. It started as a dark night in the middle of the lonely plains of Kansas with my friend, Michael. We were driving together, since it was a 2 lane and no one else was there, but we started to run low on gas. Michael said to me, "Hey, I gotta get some gas. Don't follow me in, keep driving, we'll race to the place." I nodded, as he pulled into a very dirty, old, gas station called, "Bucher's family gas". I drove by. 2 hours later, I reached the area we went to, a party at Tribune. 4 hours, I got worried. 6 hours, okay, no more, I drove to the police station and filed a missing persons report. 4 days later, no sign of him, so, I drove to the gas station. Crazy, I know, my friend just went missing and now I've decided to go there at the site of his disappearance. I walked in, and, it was weird. 

There was a strange man wearing a black robe behind the counter. I got a bag of chips and a soda, and went to the counter to pay. He seemed very strange, as if ushering me to get out. I drove away, but I still wasn't satisfied at all.

 A week later, I came back. This time there were many robed men, each staring at me. I got a chill down my spine. I bought a pack of gum and bought it, before the robed men threatened me with swords unless I left. I drove off.

 Then a month later, I came. They were blocking the entrance, singing some sort of demonic chant. I knew I was in danger. I drove away, but they pursued. They ran for me, One latched onto my trunk, one of them almost went through my open window, I managed to gas it and get them off. Then I went camping maybe a few towns over.

 I was having a picnic, all of it was perfectly normal......until. I saw glowing eyes in the nighttime forest, for sure human, but, why here? They started chanting, before tossing human remains at me. I saw one. That was Michael's shirt. I screamed, "WHAT THE F#$% HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY FRIEND, AND WHO ARE YOU?!" They started running at me, I ran to my car, and drove back home. 

When I came back to the gas station the next day, I saw that it was closed. I broke in, and looked behind the counter......Daggers, Satanic Ritual Guides, Hearts in boxes, Satan ritual masks.....and Michael's eyeball. I gagged, almost puked, and before I knew it, I blacked out. It was dark, the robed men in Satan masks, one stepped up. They stabbed my limbs. I screamed. I tried to escape, but I was tied down. They started chanting in some weird language. "ᎣᏍᏓ, ᎤᏓᏅᏙᏗ ᎠᏓᏅᏙᏗ ᎠᏓᏅᏙᏗ ᎠᏓᏅᏙᏗ, ᎣᏍᏓ ᎤᏓᏅᏙᏗ ᎠᏓᏅᏙᏗ ᎠᏓᏅᏙᏗ ᎠᏓᏅᏙᏗ, ᎩᎦᎨ ᎤᏓᏅᏙᏗ ᎠᏓᏅᏙᏗ ᎠᏓᏅᏙᏗ. ᎦᏙᎢ ᎣᏍᏓ ᎤᏓᏅᏙᏗ ᎠᏓᏅᏙᏗ ᎠᏓᏅᏙᏗ ᎠᏓᏅᏙᏗ!"

 I managed to break free, and go home, finally, I'm moving to the UK in a week. I don't have any explanation. But I still see glowing eyes at night. They, have found me.
