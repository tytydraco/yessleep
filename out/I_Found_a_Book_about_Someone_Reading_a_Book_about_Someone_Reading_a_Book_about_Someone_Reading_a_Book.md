The air was stifling as I crawled on my stomach through the roof space above my bedroom. Sweat dripped from my forehead, the dusty insulation batt I was tugging on becoming a muddy sponge. I was moving it to make way for a new air conditioning duct. I thought I’d try and save a dollar by doing the job myself.

When it finally tore free, I prepared myself to brush aside a nest of cockroaches, or remove a long dead mouse.

I did not expect to find a Children’s picture book under there.

I tossed the old batt aside and picked the book up. The title read: You’re reading a book about Paul reading a book about…

Illustrated on the front cover was a man sitting on a recliner, his feet up, toasting near the fireplace. His back faced me, but he was positioned in a way that allowed the book he was reading to be at the centre of the page where it could be seen in full. A locked padlock was printed on both opened pages.

Drawn by the cover, I opened to the first page.

It was a copy/paste of the cover, with one exception. The padlocks on Paul’s book were gone. The pages now displayed a woman leaning on a kitchen counter, her back facing me as she too read a book. Upon it’s pages, the padlocks had returned.

In a fancy font above the image of Paul, the text read:

You’re reading a book about Paul reading a book about Lola reading a book about…

I was starting to understand the theme of the book. Eager to see where it was going, I turned the page.

Once again, the same scene took up the space, only this time it was more zoomed in, cutting out half of the fireplace. The book that Paul was holding became more prominent, allowing a clearer view of Lola on the counter. Now, Lola’s book was at the centre of the entire page, showing the image of a man sitting on a park bench, back toward us, reading a book. Padlocks on both his pages.

You’re reading a book about Paul reading a book about Lola reading a book about Tom reading a book about…

Intrigued, I turned the page.

This time Paul’s form took up the entire left corner of the page. His book retained it’s central position, its size now the scale of a postcard. Lola continued reading her book about Tom. The pages on Tom’s book were now overlooking a woman submerged in a soapy bath. She read a book with those same padlocks on it.

You’re reading a book about Paul reading a book about Lola reading a book about Tom reading a book about Maria reading a book about…

I admired the image before me. It had a similar affect as two mirrors placed in front of each other. There was still a few pages remaining in the book, and I seethed with anticipation of what the affect might look like by the last page.

I turned the page, and, wanting to savour the image, read the text before anything else:

You’re reading a book about Paul reading a book about Lola reading a book about Tom reading a book about Maria reading a book about Joe fleeing the fog!

I blinked, startled by the sudden halt of the theme.

Paul’s book was now zoomed in so that its very edges formed a border around the entire page, his fingertips close to the scale of my own. The scene before me was predominantly of Lola in her kitchen. Now her book was on scale with a postcard, making Tom’s book about the size of a sticky note, and Maria’s book about half of that.

But within the small window of Maria’s book, something was off.

Instead of reading a book with padlocks on it’s pages, Joe, was facing us. Behind him, the entirety of the page he occupied was a dull red. His mouth was open in what could only have been a hysterical scream. It was the only clear feature on his face; the rest looked as blank as the pad of a finger. It unnerved me.

I turned the page, and now things started to become weird.

The repetitive text that had been growing longer from the beginning of the book was no more. In it’s place was this: Joe sees Maria and jumps through her book.

Paul, Lola, and Tom continued reading their books as normal. But within Tom’s book, the scene in Maria’s bathroom was no longer relaxing. Two legs protruded through her book, their feet submerged in the bathwater on either side of her.

I turned the page, my fingers starting to feel sweaty.

You’re reading a book about Paul reading a book about Lola reading a book about Tom reading a book about Maria and Joe fleeing the fog.

Now, Paul’s book was zoomed back out, allowing parts of his room to be within frame again. Two people were present within Tom’s book now. They were both facing the reader, their mouth’s open wide. The only way I could distinguish Maria from Joe was her long wet hair. There were no other defining features on either face. Just skin. Behind them, Maria’s bathroom had been replaced by a dull red.

My stomach began to churn. It made sense why a previous owner of the house had this book hidden beneath the insulation batt. It was Uncanny. Nightmare fuel for children.

I turned the page.

Joe and Maria sees Tom and jumps through his book.

Now it was Tom’s turn to have his peaceful reading session rudely interrupted by two pairs of feet poking out of his book and smacking him in the face.

As I turned to the next page, I felt a slight vibration between my thumb and forefinger. Accompanying it was the most distant and deepest of humming that a human ear could possibly perceive. I thought perhaps the split system air-conditioning unit had just turned on in the house.

You’re reading a book about Paul reading a book about Lola reading a book about Tom, Maria and Joe fleeing the fog.

Three screaming featureless faces faced Lola, dull red replacing Tom’s park.

Joe, Maria and Tom see Lola and jump through her book.

Six legs protruded out of Lola’s book, making it look like some Eldritch insect as it knocked her aside.

The vibration within the pages became more intense, and as I turned the page, the humming grew to a frequency that rattled my bowels.

You’re reading a book about Paul reading a book about Lola, Tom, Maria and Joe fleeing the fog.

Paul’s scene returned to it’s original scale. Four gaping mouth’s upon four featureless faces were at the centre of the page, and that dull red encapsulated Paul’s book.

My breathing was starting to get heavy as I turned the page.

Joe, Maria, Tom and Lola see Paul and jump through his book.

For the first time in the entire book, Paul’s position was changed. Eight legs protruded from his book, knocking him and his recliner backwards.

Heart slamming against my chest, I winced as I turned the page.

You’re reading a book about Paul, Lola, Tom, Maria and Joe fleeing the fog.

Pins and needles ran down my spine, as I gazed at the entirely dull red page before me.  All I could see of Joe, Maria, Tom, Lola and Paul was the wide black O of their gaping mouth’s. The dull red had obscured the rest of their featureless faces. They were not the only ones present though. Behind them, within the dull red, a set of bright red eyes shone above a bright red mouth that was drooped in an eerie frown. Besides those features, there was no indication of a face. It gave me a sort of freaky clown vibe, minus the cliché white makeup. It was as though the eyes and mouth belonged to the dull red itself.

My thumb and forefinger pinched the right hand corner of the page. The vibrating sensation was now replaced by a literal pushing. I felt something trying to push it’s way through the little sliver of the next page that I had partially revealed at my fingertips.

I reflected on how the legs had poked through the books of each reader in the previous pages and gave in to a convulsive shudder. My fingers trembled violently as my mind tore itself between desire to finish the book, and desire to close it for good. I only had one page to go.

In the end, morbid curiosity won out and I was about to turn to the final page.

But then I heard the screaming.

It was muffled, but was clearly coming from that last page. It was the deciding call.

I slammed the book shut and dropped it back where I found it. Even as I did this, the screaming from within could still be heard. The agony of those screams turned my blood to ice. To this day I am convinced it was what Hell must sound like.

All at once the desire to have ducted air conditioning in my house, dissipated. The split-system would do nicely. I placed the old insulation batt back where it was, covering that accursed book once again.

When the wife laughed at me, telling me I wasn’t the DIY king that I thought I was, I merely went along with it. Better that only I knew of the accursed book that I briefly uncovered.

It has been two years, and that book still resides below that insulation batt in the roof space directly over my bedroom. To this day, whenever I go to bed, I still hear those agonised screams, penetrating through the ceiling and into my very soul. The wife is convinced that I suffer insomnia.

Why only I hear them, is a mystery of its own. Perhaps it’s because I was the one to have come so close to freeing Joe, Maria, Tom, Lola and Paul from the horror within that book.

But, no matter what, nothing will ever compel me to give in to those screams and open that final page. The bright red eyes of that dull red fog is something I don’t want to chance bringing into my [world.](https://www.reddit.com/r/jaymicafella/)
