I was a troubled kid. I used to steal, lie to my parents and teachers, party, get into fights with the kids at my old school, and even drink and do drugs with my friends after school. I ended up in Juvie once because we got caught stealing, and the cops showed up. When I called my parents, I made up excuses, promising I would never do it again. My parents were yelling over the phone, and I couldn't blame them. My mom insisted she shouldn't bail me out, emphasizing that this was the consequence of my actions. On the other hand, my dad believed I shouldn't be locked behind bars at my age and that I deserved another chance. Despite my dad bailing me out, I continued stealing, and he knew, but he kept it from my mom to spare her from disappointment.

Eventually, my parents had enough and enrolled me in a school for troubled kids, hoping it would "fix me." One day, I walked into my room to find all my belongings packed in suitcases. My room was stripped bare except for the suitcases and my bed. From downstairs, I heard my mom yell, "The bus should be here soon." It turned out that I was headed to a place resembling a military camp. I started feeling anxious, sensing that something was amiss

As I brought my suitcases downstairs, I laid eyes on the bus. There was something off about it, a peculiar atmosphere that I couldn't quite place. Maybe it was the bus's design – a strange blend of prison and military aesthetics. Suddenly, a tall, imposing man appeared. He stood around 6'4" with an intimidating presence. He introduced himself as the school's principal, emphasizing how the institution would "fix me." I began to wonder about the meaning of "fix," sensing that there was more to it. An eerie feeling crept over me, a gut feeling that something was wrong, though fear kept me from voicing it.His gaze fixed on me, and the principal's eyes widened, registering something amiss.

It was as if he wasn't entirely human, resembling one of those lifelike robots that mimic humans. I couldn't decide if it was him or if my mind was playing tricks. "Are you ready?" he asked, but I remained silent. I stowed my suitcases under the bus, tucked away in a storage unit, and boarded. My parents professed their love, and although I met their gaze briefly, I turned away, grappling with conflicting emotions. How could they love me while sending me away? I settled into a seat on the nearly empty bus. A few other kids were on board, each absorbed in their world. With a vacant seat found, I sat down and, exhausted by the journey, eventually dozed off.

Later, I awoke in a dorm room. It was a small space, akin to a typical college dormitory, yet I was alone. Panic surged through me as I wondered how I got there. I had been on the bus moments ago. The unsettling feeling of danger gnawed at me, but I managed to steady myself. A note on the door caught my eye as I stood up. It read, "We're sorry if you were startled upon waking up. We tried to wake you, but you remained asleep, so we moved you to your dormitory :)" Reading the note, a strange sensation gripped me. Flipping it over, I saw a chilling message at the top of the page: "To prevent loss of life or injury, please read the following rules we have provided for you :)"

1. Dorm Curfew: All students must be in their dorms by 9 PM. Any student found outside past 9 PM will be apprehended by the inspectors.
2. Inspection Readiness: All students are required to be prepared for inspections by 6 AM.
3. Tardiness Policy: Tardiness will not be tolerated. If a student is found outside after the bell rings, inspectors will escort them.
4. Teacher Introduction Protocol: When asked by a teacher to introduce yourself, close your eyes and state your name. DO NOT utter anything else or open your eyes under any circumstances.
5. Lockdown Procedure: If a lockdown bell rings during class (3 short bells followed by 1 long bell), exit your class immediately, close your eyes, and keep them shut until you are in the hallway. Quickly locate a lockable room with no windows, turn off the lights, and secure the doors. (WE RECOMMEND OCCUPYING THE CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR, IN CASE THIS OCCURS. POLITELY ASK THE PERSON SITTING THERE TO RELOCATE IF REQUIRED, AVOID BEING RUDE...)
6. Silent Period: From 12:30 PM to 2 PM, refrain from speaking and making eye contact with others. Stay within your classroom. Even if asked to introduce yourself during this time, DO NOT do so. Between 12:30 PM and 2 PM, DO NOT utter a word or make eye contact with classmates or teachers. Be cautious if your teacher instructs everyone to leave the classroom; it might be a deception. Once 2 o'clock arrives, you may resume your day as usual.
7. Hide and Seek: If a little girl in the hallways invites you to play hide and seek, always accept. Hide and silently count to 60 (no attendance or tardy record will be taken). Quickly locate a lockable room with no windows, turn off the lights, and secure the doors. (like in rule 5) Wait for 30 minutes. After the designated time, the principal will find you, informing you that you're running late. (Explain that you got lost and wish to avoid tardiness; he will accompany you.)
8. Encounter with an Inspector: If you hear a loud noise followed by an Inspector appearing in front of you, avoid direct eye contact. Keep your gaze lowered and walk ahead. The Inspector might pose questions; you have the choice to answer, but we advise against it. Politely say, "I'm going to be late, thank you for your time," and they should vanish.
9. Forbidden Areas: Certain areas of the school campus are strictly off-limits to all students. If you encounter a door with a red mark beside it, do not attempt to open it or enter. These areas are under the jurisdiction of the inspectors and should be avoided at all costs. Violating this rule may result in severe consequences.
10. Weekly Reflections: Every Sunday evening, students are required to write a reflection on their behavior and progress throughout the week. The reflections should be placed in the designated dropbox outside the principal's office before 9 PM. Failure to submit a reflection or submitting an insincere reflection may result in disciplinary measures. These reflections are a way for students to engage in self-assessment and demonstrate their commitment to personal growth.

Amidst the dimly lit dormitory, an eerie silence lingered, punctuated only by the sound of my breath and the unsettling rustle of the note in my trembling hand. The air grew heavy, the weight of dread pressing against my chest. The words etched onto the paper seemed to seep into my consciousness, their implications sinking in with chilling clarity. What kind of school had I been sent to? What sinister purpose lay behind these peculiar rules?

As I reviewed the list, my heartbeat quickened, and a cold sweat formed on my brow. The dormitory walls seemed to close in, suffocating me as a creeping sense of unease enveloped me. The curfew, the inspections, the enforced silence during certain hours – it all painted a picture of control that extended far beyond what was normal. And then there was the mention of forbidden areas, ominous places marked with red, where no student was to tread. What secrets did those areas hold? What horrors lurked within?

Each rule seemed like a thread connecting to a web of sinister intent, weaving a narrative of confinement, manipulation, and lurking darkness. I couldn't shake the feeling that I had stepped into a nightmare, where every action was monitored, and every transgression met with an unknown consequence. The note itself, the cheerful apology for moving me to the dorm, now seemed like a twisted jest, a macabre attempt to downplay the eerie circumstances.

Images of the principal's strange appearance and the man's robotic demeanor replayed in my mind. Could he be more than just a man? Was he a puppeteer in this twisted play, orchestrating the lives of those who found themselves ensnared in this institution? And what of the other students?

I glanced at the time and realized I had a class approaching. Slipping the set of rules into my pocket, I grabbed my backpack and hurried to my first class. The room was empty as I entered, so I chose a seat next to the door. A few minutes later, the bell chimed, and students flooded in all at once. They resembled the principal, something about them seemed off, almost unnatural. A chill ran down my spine as I sensed the imminent danger. The teacher walked in and requested introductions. Recalling the rules, I closed my eyes, stated my name, and kept my eyes tightly shut, then took my seat. The teacher's words became a distant murmur as I tuned out, my thoughts consumed by the unsettling atmosphere. When the bell rang, I hastily left the class.

Keeping my head down to avoid eye contact with the other students who seemed far from human, I pondered how to escape this eerie school. Suddenly, the lights flickered, followed by an ear-splitting noise. Darkness enveloped me, and as the lights returned, I found myself facing the Inspector mentioned in the rules. It was unlike anything from our world – an otherworldly presence. The fear that I thought was baseless had taken a concrete form. Paralyzed, I heard a raspy voice inquire, "Where are you going?" Panic gripped me as the Inspector's anger intensified. "WHERE ARE YOU GOING?" its voice bellowed. Fumbling, I managed to utter, "I'm going to be late, thank you for your time." The lights went out and back on, heart pounding, yet everything continued as if nothing had transpired.

Racing to my next class, I took a seat, craving to return to my dorm. Noon arrived, triggering my memory of the rule forbidding communication or eye contact between 12:30 and 2. The atmosphere changed, chilling my surroundings. It felt as if all eyes were on me, and fear rooted me in place. This school was far from ordinary; how could my parents have subjected me to this? I resisted the urge to look up, enduring the torment. At precisely 2:30, the tension lifted, and the façade of normality returned. I left the classroom, my resolve solidifying. I despised this place and the rules my parents had chosen for me. 

All I wanted was another chance.Bolting through the hallways, I reasoned that this might be an elaborate prank, a jest my parents would reveal soon enough. Only one more class, then we'd be back in our dorms.Entering the final class, I braced for the routine – the bell, the robotic figures filing in. The teacher initiated the lesson, and then it happened – the lockdown bell. Three short rings followed by one long ring. I froze in my seat, consumed by terror. On a misguided impulse, I opened my eyes. My classmate's visage was nightmarish – his mouth hung unnaturally, teeth absent, a black void within. Their eyes are voids of pure black, devoid of pupils or white. One girl's smile was chilling, devoid of warmth. Panic surged; I lunged for the door, only to find it locked. Their gaze was unwavering, their advance relentless. Desperation took hold, and in a desperate attempt, I shut my eyes tight. As I reopened them, they drew closer, unyielding. An entity approached, and then... darkness enveloped me. "You should have followed the rules," it whispered. "Fear not, you'll be fixed" :)
