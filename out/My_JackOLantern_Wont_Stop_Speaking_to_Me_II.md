Hello, If you’re reading this then I’d ask that you continue. It’s been a bit since I finished my first writing on the 1st, and much has happened. My father, who my mother told me journeyed out into the woods by himself to find whatever hurt me in this way, had actually already been home for an hour after I woke up in the hospital, as he was not able to find anything. This obviously brought me a great relief which propelled me to spend the rest of my day sleeping. Thankfully, by the next morning, I had been released back to my home as my injuries were non-major and all of the tests had come back well. After that, things would begin moving pretty fast, so I will try to include as many details as I can remember.

​

I shambled up slowly to the porch with the help of my mother, and at the sound of the car doors slamming shut, my father hurried out the door with Miley trotting happily behind him.

​

“Connor! I’m so glad you’re okay.” He gripped me in for a strong and long hug, which took all the air from my lungs. When he released me, he looked down deeply at me and smiled, hands firm on my shoulders.

​

“Hey Dad, thanks,” I paused and felt my face wrinkle, unable to contain my thoughts for even a moment. “In the woods, did you see anything?” I asked, staring right up at him.

​

“No, no, I didn’t. But I’ll be going out there later tonight to find whatever did that to you. Do you remember what it was?”

​

”No! You can’t go back out there. Something is really wrong out there!” My dad shook his head in disbelief.

​

”What are you talking about, Connor? What the hell was it?”

​

”I don’t know. It was evil. Just please don’t go back.” I shuddered thinking of the wolf and its appearance in my dream. Dad stood agape for a moment longer before nodding his head and ushering me inside.

​

”Absolutely, if it makes you feel better, I won’t go back, but neither will you,” He said sternly and watched me as I entered my room and rested my hand on the door.

​

”Yeah, trust me, that won’t be happening,” I said as I closed myself away from them.

​

Walking into my room, I felt an eerie presence after the contents of my dream, but I found myself unable to resist the warm blankets in my cluttered bed. I stared at my ceiling, ignoring the tornado which looked to have gone through my room before I came in. For half an hour, I sat and waited for a clear thought to enter my mind, but my head was clouded with a fog that was reflected by the light outside. For a moment, I began to feel at peace until a dreaded whisper came to me.

​

“Huc Puer”

​

I leaped out of my bed and looked around wide-eyed.

​

“Who the hell said that? Where are you?” I whispered, for some reason feeling it necessary not to alert my parents.

​

“Huc… Puer.” Again, the rasp came, and I looked to the floor. It was coming from under the bed. Slowly, I bent over, preparing myself for what I was about to come face to face with. I jolted down and saw nothing. For a moment, I stared under the mess that was my bed and felt a vast relief come over me until I lifted my head up slightly, and a flash of terror went through me. Lunging back, I scrambled for a semblance of control over my limbs. That fiendish face already stared at me from my bed. The Jack-O-Lantern grinned and flashed again before talking further.

​

”Boy… come here, please,” it said and rocked back and forth. I backed up further and clutched the ground to feel any type of support as my mind disassociated.

​

”What… What are you?” I asked, trembling. For a moment, it just grinned at me, still before speaking in that same rasp.

​

”You are in grave danger, boy. You did well having the intuition to give me a mouth to speak with, but soon my warnings will do you no good.” I stood, back pressed firmly against the wall, before speaking.

​

”What… What do I have to do?”

​

“Return to the pumpkin patch where you found me.” Sparks flew in his gaping maw.

​

”Are you crazy? I’m never going out there ever again! Did you see what that beast did to me!” I lifted up my shirt sleeve and gazed into the shining center of its eyes.

​

”You are absolutely right, the danger the wolf poses is immense, but soon it will no longer be bound to the forest. I believe it has already begun seeping into your dreams.”

​

”How do you know that!” I spat.

​

”I can see it well through those eyes.” I turned my head and covered my face.

​

”That will not stop me from seeing within. I do not see things by conventional means.” The Jack-O-Lantern laughed, and my breathing picked up.

​

”Tell me what you are! I won’t do anything until you tell me that!” The pumpkin laughed further.

​

“Just a man like you, though I had to make some sacrifices to reach you.” I began to ask what that meant, but stopped myself, not even wishing to peruse this terrible information.

​

”So what? Kill the wolf before it becomes too strong?”

​

”Exactly.” I stared in disbelief and felt an intensifying warble in my stomach.

​

”With my father's rifle then? That’s the only way I could think to kill a thing like that.”

​

”Boy, any man who found himself face to face with that beast, only armed with a rifle, would consider themselves very unlucky. Yes, it may be wise to bring but I have provided the weapon with which you will kill the wolf.” A spark flew out, and I followed it to an object sitting on my bedside counter, which I had never seen before. A small, wooden stick which looked to be carved from the oldest tree on earth and came to a sharp point in the last few inches.

​

”This? Are you serious?”

​

”I know it doesn’t look like much, but I promise it’s the best shot we have.” I shook my head.

​

”This is crazy. I’m not doing any of this. I mean, I just got back from the hospital.”

​

”If you stop now, then the only rest you will be finding is in death, son.” My face flushed, and I turned away to face the wall. *This is crazy. I can’t do this. I won’t do this!* And then as if on cue, a flash of the black wolf cracked through my mind, sending me reeling to the ground, clutching my head. “You would be a fool to reject my warnings, boy. I promise it will not end well for you.” I muffled screams from the agony blasting through my mind.

​

”How do I make it stop?” I gritted my teeth; the taste of blood was now noticeable in my mouth.

​

“You have been marked by the beast. If nothing is done, you will carry on like this until you die, where your soul will follow him for the rest of eternity. Kill him now, and I believe you can walk free.”

My teeth gritted harder, and the taste of blood expanded over my entire palate. My head spun from this information, and it took several moments for my mind to regain balance from the pain. When it finally did, I sat up and stared at the pumpkin with desperation in my eyes.

“Tonight you will go back to the pumpkin patch armed with the staff and your father's rifle. There you will put an end to the wolf and free yourself from suffering.” Cold sweat rolled down my brow, and I nodded with the same desperation.

​

”I’ll do it. I’ll do anything.”

​

And so the time passed. Several times the pain in my head returned, which sent me into a fit; however, thankfully, none were as severe as the first. I spoke to my parents incrementally throughout the day to mask the severe task I would have to take on later. My scars, which I incurred from the wolf, ached and burned randomly, making my skin crawl. After a day of paranoia and anticipation, the sun finally began to set, and so to did my preparations. While my father took his evening walk, I snuck into his room and easily bypassed the code on his hunting shelf, acquiring his rifle and plenty of ammo to suit it. Taking it to my room, I wore my thickest clothes and packed the two weapons the Jack-O-Lantern informed me I would need. After it was dark outside, I looked around and made sure my parents had gone to their room for bed. Taking one final look back at my room, I noticed the Jack-O-Lantern no longer sat on the bed, causing me to rush back in and search.

​

”Down here,” he whispered from my bag. I looked down and from the slight opening could see that grin staring back at me.

​

”How did you get there?”

​

”I ask myself that every day.” I shook my head at this cryptic answer and walked forward quietly. Grabbing a hold of the door, I opened it slowly and made very little noise until something began aggressively nudging my leg. Looking down in a panic, I saw Miley staring up at me wildly as if she knew exactly what I was doing.

​

”Down girl, stop,” I whispered and shook my leg, but she did not cease. I opened the door further to continue walking out, and at the first chance, she bolted out of the house, turning back to stare defiantly in my eyes. “I cannot bring you with me!” I said sternly after shutting the front door. Her gaze did not falter, and in my mind I felt something loosen. *She’s been with me in this since the beginning, and I suppose she’ll see it through.* Taking a few stiff steps forward, Miley jumped up in excitement, seeing me comply and followed me along happily into the darkness. I wondered if she knew what she was getting herself into, but after her last encounter in the woods, I figured there was no way she didn’t. Reaching the tree line, I looked back at my home one last time and wondered if it would be the last time. I tried to shake these thoughts out of my mind and told myself. *I will be back.*

​

Together Miley and I walked down the dark path, which was only illuminated by my narrow flashlight. Miley's gold fur bounced in front of me, leading me where I knew we had to go. It was quiet for a long while until a muffled crackle was heard from inside my bag, where the Jack-O-Lantern rested. Opening up the satchel, I was shocked to see that the state of the pumpkin was rapidly deteriorating.

​

”What’s happening to you?” I asked in a hushed whisper. A faint crackle and spark came from the rotting pumpkin's mouth before it spoke.

​

”Worry not, my boy. This form was always meant to be a fleeting one. More of my power is required now to protect us from the evils that await, and thus I shall decay.”

​

”Will you die?”

​

”Ha! Like this? Never in a million years, my boy.” And with that, we kept walking in silence. I knew now, based on how far we had come, that we were rapidly closing in on the pumpkin patch, and my heart thumped rapidly. The wind swelled, and the screams which I remembered from the first night exploded all around me. Miley's happy trot slowed to a serious march, and through a large gust of wind, a subtle sound could be heard that made her go ballistic.

​

”What is it, girl?” I said having to scream over the wind, but she did not cease. Instead, she ran out in the darkness, causing me to go out in a dead sprint after her.

 

I ran as hard as I could with the heavy baggage I had on me, but it was not enough to catch her. Instead, after only a moment, I tripped over a large branch and fell flat on my face, sending my light flying out into the distance. Sitting up as quickly as I could, I rubbed the dirt out of my face and immediately felt a great panic. *The pumpkin!* Picking up my bag and using only the light of the moon to search for him, I found him intact even if a little bent.

​

”Do not lose focus now. You are in the belly of the beast,” he crackled with a slight spark.

 

Very slowly, I made my way over to my light and picked it up. Lifting it, I jumped as the beam came back to life, and the wolf immediately became clear dozens of yards away.

 

“Brace yourself!” The Jack-O-Lantern called out firmly. Noticing something at the edge of the light beam, I turned to see another wolf just like the first staring right at me as well. I let out a slight whimper as I turned the light further and discovered an absurd many wolves all standing confidently and staring down at me.

​

“What is this? How can this be?”

​

”All trickery. Do not waver.” I stood and continued looking around at the wolves, which, upon further inspection, looked to be in the number close to a hundred. Miley barked wildly out in the distance, but no matter where I shone the light, I could not find her.

​

”They’re going to kill her!” I screamed down at the Jack-O-Lantern.

​

”Only if you fail here now.” And with that, I waited for whatever it was the pumpkin warned me of. Turning the light obsessively, it seemed like more and more wolves were appearing by the moment and in a great shock, a slight tickle brushed against my ankle. Looking down, I was horrified to see some mass of black fur bubbling and twisting at my feet. I tried to step back, but only landed in more of the mass, which spread rapidly in the yards around me.

​

”What? No-“ I tried to begin screaming out but the Jack-O-Lantern hushed me.

​

”Do NOT let it into your mind!” I stared down in disbelief at it and felt something curious. My scars from the wolf were tickling, and after a moment, I connected what this must mean. *This isn’t real. This isn’t happening.* I found this mantra as the mass of wolf bubbled up, which now dawned eyes, teeth and random parts that grew up pants my knees to my waist. *This is not real! This is not happening!* I repeated aggressively in my mind, and with a spark from the pumpkin, a bright purple light shone out into the distance in all directions. For a moment, I could see nothing, but as my eyes adjusted, I saw there was no longer any mass of wolves nor a hundred of them as there had been before. I looked down at the pumpkin and noticed its exterior was now more blackened than before and softening greatly.

​

“Was that your doing?” I asked in amazement.

​

”Not mine, yours.” I stared in disbelief down at him and noticed further how weak he looked.

​

”You’re… rotting.”

​

”I am. We don’t have much time, but we certainly have enough, my boy.” I nodded my head and travelled forward until I heard Miley’s bark close. I pointed my light in the direction and was relieved to see her galloping towards me without a scratch.

​

”Miley! Where were you?” I bent down and hugged my dog.

​

”She had to be brave to survive that. You’ll find that she is marked as well.” My eyes widened, and I checked her coat to see that, indeed, under that mass of fur, there was a healing slash.

​

”So she’s been dealing with the same visions as me?”

​

”Indeed.” I shook my head and hugged Miley tighter.

​

”Oh, I’m so sorry, Miley. You’ve been so strong.” She let out a small yip, and I turned, directing the light with me as I did. Not even five yards away, the now lone black wolf stood and stared hatefully at us. It growled and began walking forward until the Jack-O-Lantern screamed out louder than I had ever heard.

​

”Back, you foul beast! Begone from this world where you do not belong!” And with that, the wolf lunged forward but only succeeded in slamming hard into a clear purple wall. “Take out your gun, my boy. Use it well.” Taking out my weapon, I aimed true at the wolf, which mauled and scratched at the wall, cracking and chipping with every blow to it. Finally ready, I fired into the wolf, which passed through the glass wall, sending shards of it into the wolf with the bullet. The beast recoiled, falling on its back, kicking its legs up and around. “Pay attention, Connor, your bullets will do little to harm this monster, but shards of this spiritual energy will. Shoot it through the glass.” I questioned none of this and continued firing around the wolf and into the glass. Shards rained down upon the wolf, and it cried out in agony. I looked down at the Jack-O-Lantern and screamed.

​

”What now? He’s hurt! What do we do?”

​

“It will reveal its true self to us. Grasp the staff I presented to you and stab with your heart.” Picking up the small wooden stick back at the house made me feel weak and scared, but now gave me a confidence I doubted I had ever felt before. The wolf continued its toiling and began emitting what looked like dark smoke, which wrapped and twisted around its body. When the smoke began to shift into something tangible, I knew what the pumpkin meant by its true form. The beast, which had once been a wolf, now rose into the sky as if weighing less than air, stretching its great arms out and shrieking into the night with a horrific, shrill pitch. Jumping forward, Miley barked and howled at the beast and refused to quit when I begged her to stop. After the dark smoke, which now made up the beast's body, quit swirling and formed into a solid dark mass, it lunged down at Miley as if pushing off an invisible wall in the sky. Rocketing down, Miley stood tall and leapt up to clamp her jaw down around the thing's legs as it tried to swipe the staff out of my hands. When she did this, the beast flew completely off course and crashed into a nearby bush.

​

“Miley!” I screamed out and rushed forward, not going without recognizing that the monster would have taken my hand clean off if not for her intervention. Diving into the bush, I found Miley ripping and tearing at the hulking thing whose eyes bulged and spun around in its skull, looking as if it did not know where it was. The parts where Miley bit evaporated and floated away in the same black smoke as before.

​

“You must hurry, boy. Once it becomes acclimated to this form, you will have little chance.” I gulped from the pumpkin's message and rushed forward, raising the staff above my head. At this, the beast's eyes locked onto the weapon and let out that same inhuman shriek, sending myself and Miley reeling backwards. After this, it bolted up and began bouncing through the trees with the same smoky haze trailing behind it.

​

“How do I hit it? I can’t reach it!” I screamed out to the pumpkin, keeping my eyes locked on the monster.

​

“You have to focus, Connor. There will be things I cannot explain to you.”

​

A great anger filled my head hearing this, and I foolishly looked down at the pumpkin, which was now so far along in the stage of rot I could hardly believe it still spoke to me. The moment I did this, the beast swung down, bringing its great hand back to swipe the staff from my hand, but strangely, though my eyes were not locked on the beast, I knew its every movement. Just as it reeled its hand forward, I sent my own outward, plunging the staff into it. The shriek it now uttered filled up every sensory outlet I had. taking me reeling back and fighting for consciousness. As I lay looking up at the sky, I tried to move my limbs, doing so and lifting myself to gaze upon what had come of the beast. Black smoke exploded from its body in all directions and swirled into the air as the husk below it melted into the dirt.

​

“Careful, boy. This is not yet over.”

​

I looked down at the pumpkin, which now only appeared as a black mess in the dirt, and I could not help from letting air escape my lungs, seeing which was once so perfect in such a state. Then, in a blade of purple light, I found myself experiencing a new sight that saw a projectile imminently approaching me. I lunged forward as a tentacle of black smoke plunged toward Miley and grabbed it out of the air right before it reached her.

​

“Miley, get out of here! You’ve already done enough!” I screamed at her, but it was too late. Another hand of black smoke reached out towards her and grabbed her hind legs, pulling her back towards the melting mass. I screamed out and ran for her, but stopped when I witnessed what I was entering. The beast had fully become a sludge which not only sank into the earth but bent and split it into an abyss which went farther than the eye could see. I looked at Miley, who gnawed and clawed the arm but was unable to put a scratch on it.

​

“It is going back to its land of origin now. I suggest you act if you want to be with your dog when they meet on the other side.” I turned to look in disbelief at the pumpkin but realized I could not see him any longer. The voice only came from my head now.

​

Looking back at Miley, seeing her desperate eyes, I wasted no time leaping into the clutches of the beast and after grabbing onto her, fell an unbelievable distance. I absolutely figured myself dead until I looked around and saw the darkness turning into a soft, purple light. The beast's arms grew all around, and looking at its swirling body reminded me of some kind of dark squid with the hands of bears. A loud humming also grew and grew until becoming nearly unbearable, which is when the feeling of gravity shifted and time slowed. Suddenly, I had turned to my side and flown out into a pale grassy plane. Looking around, I saw nothing but grey grass as far as the eye could see, and the wind was a type of cold which seeped deep into my bones. I looked down at Miley, and she looked up at me with moon eyes and her tail tucked in between her legs. Patting her on the head, I walked forward slightly until I noticed something squirming on the ground.

​

The beast, which was once so high and mighty, lay on the ground flapping its many arms, which now appeared physical and as pathetic as any bug I’d ever seen. With no thought, I brought my foot hard upon the creature and watched it cease movement. At this, Miley's spirits seem to be lifted slightly, but her uneasy look did not fade.

 

“Where are we?” I could not help but utter in amazement as I looked around the foreign landscape. Turning back I tried to investigate the rip which we had come from but it was seeming to just finish closing.

 

Miley turned and barked at me, shifting my attention to the distant howls which echoed through the land.

​

“It looks like it's just you and I, girl. I don’t really know what this is, but we’ll be in it together.” It was only then that Miley's tail began to wag.

​

As I write this out now, I don’t know who these words will find or if they will appear as anything but the crazy imagination of an overactive kid, but in all honesty, I don’t care. The chance to be somewhere new like this, even if it is a million miles away, is something I can’t take for granted. I know no matter how far I am, I will make it back to my parents. Together, Miley and I walked into this new fallen land. I could not help but hum a bright tune, confident in this new place with my best friend.
