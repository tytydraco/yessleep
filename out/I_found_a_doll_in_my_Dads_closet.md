This was my first year playing basketball, and I seemed to get hurt nearly every game. First game, I twisted my ankle. Second game, I jammed my finger. Third game, I fell and nearly broke my nose. 

All I was looking for was an extra pair of socks. I had run through all of my own socks, and my dad and I had relatively the same size shoes, so I went into his closet to grab an extra pair of socks before my basketball game. I went rummaging through his built-in drawers in his closet and finally pulled the bottom drawer out to see all of his socks balled up and set perfectly in three rows. I grabbed a pair from the back and as I was closing the drawer, an object dislocated from the drawer above and fell onto the socks. 

  
It was a doll. 

  
It was a Voodoo doll of me. It had one tuft of my hair pinned to the top of the head and two tiny buttons for eyes. It was wearing a little version of my high school basketball jersey with my number sewn onto the back of it. 

This was completely out of character for my dad. He was a smart, church-going man that believed treating everyone with dignity and empathy is the best way to live. He would never touch a Ouija board, let alone a Voodoo doll. He didn't even watch movies that contained supernatural beings, he claims, "We have no idea if demons are real, and I don't want to even think about ghosts." 

I didn't want to think about it, I had a game in thirty minutes. I planned on asking dad about it after the game. I grabbed the little doll and put it under my pillow while I went to finish getting ready. 

We lost. I had the worst migraine I've ever had in my entire life and could barely run across the court without nearly passing out. The coach pulled me out of the game and my migraine moved to the left side of my face while I watch my teammates continually lose the ball to the other team. By the end of the third period, I could barely see, and I spent the rest of the game on the bench. 

On the ride home, dad tried to comfort me. 

"It's okay bud - we've all had these kinds of days. You did nothing wrong. Let's get you home and take some pain medication and sleep it off."

I could barely say anything and just laid in the backseat with my arms covering my eyes. Each time we passed by a lamp post, it felt like a knife stabbing me in the eye. 

When we finally made it home, I had completely forgotten about the doll. I got ready for bed and took enough pain killers to knock a horse out. When I laid down, I felt the bump from the doll on my pillow. I pulled it out and nearly blacked out again. It had a needle sticking straight into the left side of the doll's head. I pulled it out and the tension began to subside, very slowly, but I could almost feel the needle being pulled out as I removed it.  I needed to see if this was real, so I grabbed a thumbtack from the corner of my James Harden poster and stabbed it in the doll's shoulder. It wasn't immediate, but I felt the sharp prick near my collar bone and as soon as I pulled it out, the pain settled. I pulled the collar of my shirt down and was not bleeding, there wasn't even a mark on me. 

There was no possible way for my dad to have been in my room after I had taken the doll. I was changing in there the entire time, and we left right after I put my shoes on and jumped in the car . It was only the two of us, no one else lived with us. My mom died about seven years ago and I was their only child. My dad hasn't dated anyone since and I barely have friends that come over to the house, there was no way anyone could have known where this was, let alone where I put it after I found it. I decided to move it again and see if something else would happen. 

I searched my whole room for the best spot to hide it and decided on putting it in my vent in the ceiling. I grabbed my pocketknife from my nightstand, stood up on the top of my bed, unscrewed one side of the vent and shoved the doll in.  My headache was finally getting to where I could see again, and I turned my lights off before getting in bed. The vent was right above my bed and the low reflection from the light of the hallway shone dully on two button eyes looking at me through the slits of the vent.

The next morning, I woke up early to head to basketball practice, only to be yelled at from our coach from losing to the worst team in our division. My headache came right back as soon as I left the house again, this time right at the top of my skull. It wasn't nearly as bad as yesterday but still impeded on my focus. I finished practice near dinner time and dad came to pick me up. He usually took me out to dinner on Saturdays, so we headed to the local Mexican restaurant. I was starving but had a hard time deciding on what to eat, nothing sounded good. My dad picked the same thing as he always gets, and I decided on just basic cheese quesadillas. 

"Practice go any better today bud?"

I shook my head, "No, I got another headache. I don't know what's wrong with me. This barely ever happens." 

He seemed genuinely surprised. 

"That's not good. Your mom had headaches a lot when we moved here, they seemed to come out of nowhere and would last for days. Hopefully yours won't develop into those. We can go see a doctor if you want, just to make sure nothing's wrong."

"No, no I don't think so. Maybe I'm just stressed. Hopefully it will go away soon." 

When we got home, I immediately ran to my room and went to unscrew the vent. One of the screws was missing, so I undid the other side of the vent and grabbed the doll. I found the second screw stabbed in the top of the dolls head.
