[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1od616z/disembodied_podcasters_are_recapping_my_haunting/)

Those jerks scared the crap out of me.

It was 3 a.m. at my shift as a security guard. I got the job yesterday. Thankfully, it will pay the bills, and as a bonus, I don’t have to be in the house at night. Ghost gets what it wants, I get to sleep during the day and hopefully don’t have to deal with it waking me up or attacking me in the future, heaven forbid.

Anyway, I’m sitting by myself in the security booth, watching some woman on one of the cameras, when Dickhead 1 speaks up.

“Harris, it’s coming,” said Isaac.

I cursed and scrambled to my feet. My eyes scanned the dark corners of the parking garage, looking for some dark entity, waiting for an invisible hand to write on the window. I threw a chair in front of the door, even though I knew it wouldn’t help.

“Oh, Isaac, it’s coming,” said Harris.

“When’s it gonna show up?”

“Oh, very soon. Very soon.” Panicked, I spun every which way, backing myself towards the corner.

Isaac’s voice went cold. “Harris…the lights just went out.” An automatic light turned off in the far corner of the parking garage.

“You’re not alone,” Isaac said shakily.

“It’s right behind you, isn’t it?” said Harris, matching Isaac’s tone.

I spun to an empty corner. Nothing was there. My heart was beating in my ears, and I couldn’t catch my breath.

Harris and Isaac screamed at the top of their lungs. I just about shit my pants as I crumpled to the floor. Then they started laughing.

“It’s our new exclusive merch drop!” said Harris, voice now completely cheerful.

“Featuring our signature tagline!” said Isaac.

“’It’s right behind me, isn’t it?’”

“We’ve got hats, we’ve got hoodies, we’ve got cozies!”

“We’ve got a new shirt with Isaac in a thong being chased by an alien monster!”

“We’ve got Harris as a sentient armchair telling you to sit on his lap!”

“But quick, this offer won’t last long!”

“So go to our shop right now and buy our merch!”

“Buy it!”

“Ok, now back to the episode!”

The amount of rage that kept me awake for the rest of the night would have made the Doomslayer blush. It was infuriating to know that these podcasters would follow me outside my house, even if the poltergeist wouldn’t.

I’m going to sleep on the couch today in hopes I don’t have any more poltergeist experiences while I’m asleep. Considering the new writing on the wall in my bedroom that was there when I got home, the hauntings only take place at night. Those idiots commentated as I was getting a blanket from my room.

“It’s kinda clear the author ran out of ideas for the poltergeist haunt,” said Isaac.

“Yeah, but I think it’s clever that our protagonist is actually trying to avoid it the best he can,” said Harris.

“Yeah, we’ll see. I just hope the twist lives up to the hype.”    

“Dude, when has this author’s twists not lived up to the hype?”

“Yeah, you’re right. I’ll probably be crapping my pants after the next entry.”

They might be right about something. The words on the wall made me think twice about coming back to the house.

LISTEN. SHE’S COMING

I’m going to sleep and then work. I’ll update you tomorrow if anything changes.
