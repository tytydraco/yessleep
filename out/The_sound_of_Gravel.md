It was just past 11 p.m. when Emily pulled into the driveway of her Airbnb—a modest, one-story house tucked at the edge of a quiet rural neighborhood. Her GPS had led her three hours through unfamiliar back roads, most of them pitch black and lined with woods. She’d taken the freelance photography gig last minute, desperate for cash, and the remote location was part of the appeal. No light pollution. Perfect for shooting the stars.

The host had messaged her the entry code earlier. No personal interaction. Ideal.

She unlocked the door, stepped inside, and flicked on the lights. The place was cleaner than she expected. Sparse, but tidy. A couch, a small dining table, a TV mounted on the wall. Her eyes scanned the room for cameras—just in case. None that she could see. The bedroom was small but fine, with crisp white sheets and a cheap IKEA lamp. The windows had no curtains. She made a mental note to change in the bathroom.

By midnight, she had her gear set up outside. The sky was clear, the stars scattered like salt. She snapped long exposures for an hour, listening to the chirping insects and the occasional dog barking in the distance.

Then came the sound of gravel.

Crunch… crunch… slow and steady footsteps on the driveway.

Emily froze.

She looked toward the front of the house, heart thumping. The motion light above the garage flicked on. Nothing. She waited, camera still in hand, ears straining.

Crunch… crunch…

Closer now. Deliberate. Heavy.

She clicked off her camera, backed toward the house, and slipped inside, locking the door. Through the peephole—nothing. Just the driveway, empty under the yellow glow of the motion light.

She told herself it was a stray animal. Maybe a deer.

Still, she went around the house, double-checking all doors and windows. All locked. No sign of anyone.

By 2 a.m., she was in bed, fully clothed, pepper spray on the nightstand. She left the bedroom light on.

At 3:12 a.m., she woke up to a sound. Not from outside.

From the living room.

A faint creak of floorboards.

She sat up, breath caught in her chest. The house was supposed to be empty. She stayed completely still, listening.

Nothing.

She tiptoed to the bedroom door, cracked it open, and peered out. The living room was dark.

She reached for her phone, barely daring to breathe.

No signal.

Of course.

She had to remind herself that rural meant unreliable coverage.

She waited until dawn before venturing out. The house was silent. Empty. Everything in its place.

She chalked it up to nerves and sleep deprivation.

That morning, she planned to leave early but decided to stay another night. She told herself she was being paranoid. There was money to be made, and clear skies forecast again.

Around noon, she walked the perimeter of the property.

In the dirt near the back corner of the house, she found footprints.

Not hers.

Boot prints. Large. Deep. Coming from the woods. Leading up to the back wall.

She didn’t panic. Not yet. She took photos, marked the area with a rock, and returned to the house.

She emailed the Airbnb host, asking if anyone had reason to be on the property. No answer.

At 2 p.m., she called a friend. No answer. Left a message: “Hey, this place is weird. Might leave early. Just letting someone know.”

By nightfall, she was more alert. She left all the inside lights off, except the kitchen, so she could see reflections in the glass. She kept the front door locked and stayed away from windows.

At 9:43 p.m., the motion light clicked on again.

This time she didn’t look out.

She picked up her keys, grabbed her gear, and headed for the door.

Something stopped her.

Not a sound. A feeling.

She turned to look through the peephole.

Still empty.

But when she turned the knob—she paused.

The keyless lock blinked red.

She hadn’t locked it electronically.

She’d used the deadbolt.

Someone had changed the code.

She tried again. Red.

Tried to override it using the host’s original message. Denied.

Emily backed away, heart pounding, and checked the windows again. Still locked, still shut. The phone? Still no signal.

She dialed 911 anyway. No connection.

Her laptop had some offline maps downloaded. She looked up the nearest police station—18 miles away. Too far to run. And someone was out there.

She heard it again.

Crunch… crunch…

Not on gravel.

On the roof.

She ran to the bedroom and crawled into the closet, closing the door as quietly as she could.

She listened.

Silence.

Ten minutes passed.

Then twenty.

Her legs cramped. Her breathing became shallow.

And then—footsteps.

Inside.

Slow. Calculated. Someone was in the house.

She covered her mouth and didn’t move.

They didn’t call out.

Didn’t turn on any lights.

They just walked.

And stopped.

Right outside the closet.

She could hear the faintest sound of breathing on the other side of the door.

Then… a whisper.

“Are you still here?”

A man’s voice. Calm. Friendly. Too calm.

She didn’t answer. Didn’t move.

The floor creaked as he turned away. Footsteps retreated. A door closed. Then silence again.

Hours passed. Dawn came. Birds chirped.

She didn’t leave the closet until she saw daylight shining through the crack under the door.

The house was empty. The front door was wide open.

No footprints. No note. No damage.

Just… gone.

She grabbed everything she could carry and drove—without stopping—until she hit a gas station with a signal.

She reported it all. Every detail.

The police checked the property.

The Airbnb account had been deleted overnight.

The house? It was never listed on the platform.

And the owner?

Had been dead for six months.
