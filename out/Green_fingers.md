I’ve always loved nature. I grew up in a high-rise in the middle of a city, but I always tended to the window boxes and potted plants with care; I dreamt of becoming a farmer (although I’m sure the physical labour wouldn’t have suited me at all) and, as a young woman, I jumped at the chance to work at a plant nursery in a small town in the suburbs. 

The village was tiny, only about fifteen houses, but properly posh - long driveways, red brick mansions, you name it. It was populated with pretty much only old people, the creepy kind who never leave their houses and don’t like foreigners. 

As for the actual facility, it waspretty big for a garden center - big chain link fences with three greenhouses full of tropical plants and countless rows of house plants, flowers, and young tree saplings. There was also a reception near the entrance and an employees-only office full of filing cabinets, with a break room for us as well.

Of course, as an employee of a plant nursery, I wasn’t earning anywhere near enough to live in the area - in fact my commute was about an hour and a half, so I worked overtime as many days as possible since I wanted to make the most of my time at work.

It was one of those days on which my story happened. I was working the latest shift, taking care of some orchids (if you know anything about plants, you know how temperamental orchids are) and locking up. 

I was about halfway through turning the lights off when I heard a strange creaking noise from the darkness behind me. Not like a door opening, more like the sound it would make if you tried to bend a plank of wood - that’s the only way I can describe it.

It was quiet, almost fading into the background, and it stopped after a few seconds. 

I was a little freaked out, and I was a little more hasty in locking up. Just a couple of minutes later, though, I heard the sound again - this time from more than one place. It was also accompanied by a slithering sound, like you’d imagine the noise of a snake moving.

Now I was seriously scared. I’ve never liked horror movies, and it’s not as though I could fight against anything. The only thing I wanted was to get done with this place and go home.

The feeling of relief  which washed over me as I put the padlock on the main gate quickly tarnished as I felt for my phone in my pocket, and failed to find it there. I had left it in the office, like an idiot. My stomach sank. The prospect of walking through the darkness filled me with dread. 

Throughout the time I’d spent closing up, that sound had followed me, getting louder each time and giving me ample opportunity to invent various monsters it could be. My mind seemed hellbent on preventing me from returning, but I had no choice. My train ticket home was on that phone.

Pulling open the gate, I ran as fast as I safely could through the night, unidentifiable noises surrounding me. Suddenly, I tripped on something. Something which should not have been there. 

Trying to orient myself, I felt around on the stone path. It felt… different somehow. Almost lumpy. As if something was pushing up on it from underneath. My searching hands touched something rough and cold and I recoiled in surprise; when I cautiously felt for it again, I realized what it was.

A tree root. 

There was a tree root growing on the path. 

In fact, now that my eyes were adjusting, I could see that there were many. Trees were growing all around me where trees had not been before. Quite literally growing. I could see their branches getting longer, their trunks getting thicker, all the while making that quiet creaking noise. 

I don’t remember feeling anything other than confusion at that moment. All I knew was that I needed to get my phone, and get out. I rose slowly and began to walk towards the office, all the while staring in wonder at my surroundings.

A few metres on, the thick walls of constantly growing trees subsided; instead, the path was threaded with twining vines, large wildflowers pushing through cracks in the stone. I could see the colourful plants of the greenhouse bursting through the plastic roofing containing them.

The office itself was encased in moss, and I had to force the door open, dislodging dirt and fungus from the hinges. The sight of my phone snapped me out of whatever trance I had been in for the past few minutes. Finally comprehending what I was seeing, I forced myself to calm down. I was dreaming, I thought; all I needed to do was sleep, and I would wake up at home. I curled up on a chair, trying to ignore the crackling and groaning coming from outside.

Maybe I was right. I did wake up in my bed that morning. But I never did find the plant nursery again. 

It turns out there never was one; or that is what my common sense is telling me. Just a forest where I thought it was. 

I suppose there was always just a forest. The only thing that makes me doubt that is where I found my phone.

It was sitting on a rock in the middle of the woods, right where the garden center should have been.
