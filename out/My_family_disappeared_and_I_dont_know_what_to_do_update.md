Update!

It's been an excruciating two-week stretch since my last post, and I'd like to thank all of you for your support and advice during this whole ordeal. 

One particular comment caught my attention—a suggestion to seek legal counsel. It's advice that struck a chord because, shortly after my previous update, I found myself facing the relentless questioning of the local police. They showed up at my house, their presence almost saying “we know you did it”. The interrogation was relentless, a relentless barrage of questions concerning the inexplicable disappearance of my family. Despite their efforts, they eventually released me, mainly because the lack of concrete evidence, and what seemed like, a hint of pity.

The unsettling feeling within me just wouldn’t stop. It was a sense that something was very wrong, something beyond the grasp of reason. So, I made the difficult decision to return to the cabin, to look through its quiet rooms in search of any clues on what could have happened. Packing for my journey I included a firearm I had once stored away for extreme circumstances, I then started on the unsettling path ahead.

Remarkably, the drive to the cabin was uneventful, none of the peculiar occurrences that had previously haunted us happened. No ominous feeling, no unspoken doubts—just an unremarkable journey to the cabin. the cabin was the same as it always has been. Yet, I spent an entire day there, finally being fully alone crying at the dinning table inside, and eventually, laid in the room where my children where sleeping, clutching one of my wife's shirts for comfort.

Over the course of the next three days, I combed through every inch of the cabin, revisiting memories now over taken with haunting mysteries and my grief. It was during one of these exhaustive searches, while looking over blueprints of the cabin, that I stumbled upon an something the police missed – a concealed compartment within the children's room. What I found was the first clue to anything but a extremely disturbing one: notes exchanged between my children. The words they wrote left me confused: "Dad and Mom are acting weird." "Yeah, I'm not sure why. Maybe they are fighting." "Mommy's back to normal, but Daddy's still acting weird."

In that moment, a realization struck me. What my wife and I had perceived as our children acting strangely, they had viewed as us acting strangely. When I thought that my wife had started acting strangely to them, she, was acting normal again, well I was the weird one.

Driven by confusion, I went on an exhaustive research journey, on the internet, only to be met with tons of folklore and conspiracy theories leading to dead ends. Frustrated and upset, I turned my attention to the old family photos within the cabin, I just wanted to see my wife’s smiling face again.

As I flipped through the pages tearing up at my wife’s beautiful face, an eerie depiction unfolded. Over the years, the photographs began to the be full with more and more people I had never met. unfamiliar faces – strangers who seemed to appear in my wife’s family's history.

Then, I made a chilling discovery within a photo album conspicuously labeled "the gone." Its pages showed images of individuals entirely unknown to me, intermingling with my wife's family, their presence unnerving.

As I finished looking through "the gone" album, an uncanny silence surrounded the cabin, the same haunting stillness of the very first day we had arrived. It spooked me why when I found this album did that same exact silence appear. I stepped outside with my gun looking around nothing not even any wind gusts blowing up leaves. Just stillness and silence from all directions. I quickly moved back inside still grieving my gun I went through and locked the windows and doors well also making sure no one was inside besides me. 

Form that point I have decided my next course of action is to reach out to my wife's family, to confront them about the album and the mysteries of their disappearance. I want to know What significance does it hold? Could they possess the key to finding my wife and our children? I stand at a now more hopeful point. I will updated again if anything else happens or if I get the answer to this horrid situation. Again as I said last post if anyone has any information about this type of situation please contact me.
