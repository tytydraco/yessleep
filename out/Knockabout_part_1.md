The sunset cut slip thin across the horizon before I took my last exit. Nothing in the world rests on the eyes like the gold made over the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I’ve been driving for fourteen hours, and though I’ve had a few stops for gas, food, and coffee, this is the first actual stretch of rest I’ve been afforded. You can call me Red, my car is an abused Nissan Cube , her name is Darla. We live together. I’ve been homeless for six years now.

Despite how bad it might seem living the way I do. I’m not all gloom and misery. Life is simple, I drive places, I make money to get gas, and then I drive to more places. I’ve seen more countryside than most folks dream about. I’ve been on more roads than anyone I’ve ever heard of. The only thing I worry about is the closest pit-stop.

I’ve got Freedom from everything I could ever worry about. Jean Paul Sartre said we’re all doomed to be free. I disagree, I think the real doom is knowing you *could be* free, and knowing you’ll never take the chance. Don’t like your job? Quit. Don’t like your family? Leave. Don’t like your friends? Stop seeing them. You don’t wanna live with the consequences of those choices? Don’t make em.

Some nights pass quickly, Others nights aren’t as easy. Though I chose to live this way, the primal jelly inside my skull, the Part of me as old as stone, weeps like a sickly child for company. Humans are social animals after all. I hate those nights. To put my head at ease, I play a game with other drivers.

Only on the lonely roads. I’ll find myself a car, and I’ll trail behind them. I don’t ride their ass or anything, I just stay by them. They have no idea where I’m going, they have no reason to fear me, they have nothing to say. When you’re flying down Route-66 for three hours at four in the morning, having a car to drive with lets it all melt into halcyon road trips. A few hours in, they always peel away and then I’m alone, the jelly in my head is satisfied.

Sometimes I run into someone else doing the same. A car as rough as mine, a driver as tired as me, and trailing along as we both wait to go our separate ways. Whenever I run into a person like this, I do my best to follow their road as long as I can. This is a connection that means more to me. Makes me feel like I’m not the only ghost on the road. My life might sound a bit strange to people not in my place, though my place is a strange one to be.

Recently, I ran into a ghost who felt like a mirror on wheels. They drove a Black 1970 Ford pickup which wore its age like a whore wears perfume. The car felt like part of the road, and as I trailed behind I started to lose track of the hours. It felt different than the other people I’ve seen. Once Darla needed fuel, I pulled away so I could get her what she needed. I figured this shadow of mine would want their privacy back. Although to my surprise the Ford followed. 

What was odd, was that at first I didn’t feel uneasy about it. The roads were kind, the weather still. Stars poured out across the night, our tires sung an empty song to the endless desert all around us. After a while I felt at home, and that’s when it terrified me. I felt a shackle snap shut around my throat. For a moment I felt like I had a brother again. With a lonely Gas Stop in the distance, I resolved to leave this Stranger, to forget this feeling.

I had walked into this nowhere Gas Station, the place reeking of cleaning chemicals and stale air. Crowded Aluminum Isles packed to bursting with fossilized candies, off brand Beef Jerky, toiletries, and Cough Medicine. The Clerk was a woman in her fifties. Hair like dry white grass, skin like tissue stained by time. Her Sun-bleached uniform told of decades in the same place. She drank black coffee from a Styrofoam cup. The lines on her face dug in like canyons, cracked beside eyes mourning a life she could have had. She reminded me of my Mother.

She politely pretended not to watch as I roamed the isles, gathering what I needed. Bottled water, jerky, crackers, instant coffee, razors, shaving cream, batteries, duct tape, pliers, pills for caffeine, and sleep. Even with her in the room, I finally felt alone again.

“30 on 5.” I grunted, placing my items on the counter. I didn’t want to speak, my throat was dry.

She looked at me with those sad eyes, and smiled. “Got everythin’ ya need hun?” her voice was milk-candy, and cold hands.

I couldn’t muster much of a smile. I just nodded as pleasantly as I could. After the Driver followed me, I was here to forget. Part of me felt like I should help her, get some of the sadness out of her eyes somehow. Maybe a kind word, a smile, something? She told me what I owed.

“You have a nice day now darlin’.” she smiled, and sipped her coffee.

I went back to my Darla, content to get back on the road. Before I got to her door, the smell of leather and whiskey hit the back of my throat like buckshot.

“Heya Tex, nice drivin’ back there.” said the man “Fancy we getting’ to the same spot. Lass at the counter looks half dead tho, she any help?”

For a moment I thought he was in my head. He was layers of fine denim worn down by decades of use. Dark as a shadow, and slim as a knife. His face was a road map written by tobacco stains and bad choices. He had a voice like cigar smoke, and with that Black Ford behind him; I knew who he was right away. The Driver found me again.

I couldn't move as His eyes cut through me, they were a shade of ice. Two frozen mountaintops far into a valley I'd never want to visit. His stare nailed my tongue to the roof of my mouth, though the jelly in my head pried it loose.

  “Yep” I said, my throat dry, my voice disused.

“Good to hear, damn it’s been what, twelve hours since my last stop?” his accent was thick with brambles and hickory. “Where you headed there Tex?”

“Nowhere.” I replied. The Jelly was feasting on this, Something about this man was lighting torches of the past in my head.

“I’m headed past Nowhere myself, you lookin’ fer company? Since we’re both goin’ the same way figured I’d ask.” his voice became a shot of whiskey. It went down just as well.

“Sure.” was all I could manage. That word slipped out of me, because under his teeth, inside his tongue, I could hear my older brother. The last time I had seen him was at his funeral. He was wearing all black too.

“Well alright then! Lemme go check in the pit, grab some grub, and get in the ol’ beater. I’ll follow yer’ lead.” The Driver sauntered through the Nowhere Station like a cowboy into a silent movie.

As I fed Darla, I sat in a stunned silence. I felt violated, I felt lost. What part of my head is so fragile that it broke so easily. It was years since the Funeral. It has been over a decade since Family rang in me as anything other than regret. In the quiet pump of the gas, I heard my Father, in the stillness of the air I heard my Mother. In my breathing, was their violence. I thought I would never think of them again.

The Driver was still inside, I could see him through the window. He spoke to the sad-eyed cashier, and for an instant made eye contact with me over her shoulder. It felt like a Rattlesnake at my feet. He smiled like a razor-blade, and waved. I raised a hand, and waved back. Darla finished eating, I put the pump away. My hands began shaking. I drove away without a word. I did not wait for this shadow of a man to leave the building.

I told myself I was seeing things, that it was exhaustion clouding my vision. I knew there were only two people in that building. There were three cars in the lot. One for the Cashier, one for the Driver, one for me. I knew this as sure as I knew the sound of tires on asphalt. But in that moment when the Driver smiled, just over his shoulder, I saw my brother staring back at me.

I drove quiet, I focused on the wheel in my hands. I felt like a man falling off a building, trying to argue the ground out of the way. After two more hours, I decided to rest. I decided to leave the Man in Black behind me.

Another day dawned in gold through Darla’s windshield. The Sleep crusted in my eyes was blinked away through dry coughs, and gulps of water. I brushed my teeth, stepped onto the side of the road, pissed into the dirt, and was ready to drive again. I had gone north the whole of yesterday, up into the redwoods. Those trees were monolithic things. They might as well be ageless. Towering signposts to the past. They grew taller, and more vibrant than any other tree I have ever seen.

As I pulled back onto the road, Darla and I had peace again. I went through Jerky, listened to the Radio prattle on about the latest news, the traffic ahead, and the weather to come. Winding through the mountains, I saw car after car parked to admire the wilderness. People walking through Footpaths doing the same thing I am, looking for places in between their responsibilities.

People come to nature for freedom. They walk through the woods, light campfires, all to forget the places they left. The irony is their homes are no less natural than the woods. People pretend that humans aren’t nature”, but we are. No human building is different from a beaver dam. No cellphone is different than a whale song.

Humans make up rules, and gods, and stories to create something that comes out of nothing to save us from our freedom. Without these ideas, people have to face that just like any Lion starving because it can’t catch a gazelle, or any deer eaten by a pack of wolves, nothing comes out of the sky to stop it. Everything on earth is free, we only trick ourselves into thinking we aren’t. When I saw a familiar Black Ford in my rear-view mirror, I was reminded of that reality.

While I do my best to vanish into the road, The Driver following me might as well have put the sun on my back. His car reeked of timeless demands for attention. Everyone we passed looked. Everyone waved, everyone could tell he was following me. He drove in sync, never too close. He followed me for six hours, I did my best not to panic.

I told him I was going nowhere. He told me the same. There was nowhere I could stop which he couldn’t stop at too. He stuck through every red light, every turn, every detour. As time passed with the Driver behind me, his presence brought back memories. My brother teaching me to drive, my first car, the first girl I kissed. The first person I left on the side of the road. As the miles of memories piled up, I found myself as the child in my Father’s back seat.

Even alone with my Darla, I began to hear my parents argue. A memory so vivid I could taste the fear in my mouth. Each curse, each strike, each moment of fear tangible. Alone in the care of two people who knew nothing about care. The dull thud of my Father’s fist on the back of my Mother’s head. I could smell the rain on the road, feel the biting winter through the cracked windshields.

Beyond my memories rain began to pour. Darla provided a clear windshield, though couldn’t hide the shadow-car behind me. I hit a pothole, and in the noise I heard the cracking thump of my Mother’s face into the hood of my Father’s Volkswagen. The sound of her choking as his hands gripped around her throat.

Time passed overhead, the gauges on my dashboard and the weight of my eyelids began to beg for peace. The sound of childhood began to ring louder and louder. No matter the music I put on, no matter the places I drove; the Driver’s presence dragged every moment of my life back to me. The blur of tears obscured the road, Darla couldn’t clear my vision. My older brother's voice rang in my head as he held a knife to my Father’s throat.

“Touch her again, and I’ll fucking kill you.” he was 13, I was 9. That was the day I learned how free we really are.

I pulled off to a rest station. Parking spaces, faded signs, fetid toilets, and rotten showers. It was a crypt for the American Dream, a good place to bury these memories. Dutifully, the Ford pulled in as well. It parked with a modest distance, and the Driver got out. A cigarette in hand, he leaned on his hood and brought smoke to the air around him. I caught my breath as the Driver watched Darla and I.

Darla was warm, though I needed air to wash out all the dread in me. As I opened the door, the moist cold rushed at me like a bitter hug. The strike of it shook my senses back. I reached out my limbs to bring them back to life, and readied to cut ways with this mystery man. The downpour had started in earnest now, puddles underfoot forming a shallow lake. Even in the shadows, the smoke, and the rain, I could see the Driver’s eyes.

“Bout time you stopped Tex! Wheew, you weren’t kiddin’ bout nowhere.” He called across the rain.

“I wasn’t.” I said as I called back as I closed the distance between us.

“We bout there yet? Or we getting some sleep before the next stretch?” a dry chuckle cracked through his words.

“why are you following me?” I asked, I wanted to get through this.

He smiled.

“I was waiting’ fer you to ask me that.” his voice put the rattlesnake at my feet again “I wanted to know why *you* were following *me.*” Then his words made the snake bite.

“You noticed.” I tried to sound sure of myself, though the venom in his words already had me.

“Hard not to, yer car ain’t exactly subtle.” he nodded towards where I was parked. “How long you been out here?”

“Long enough to know I like to be left alone.” I replied, as I moved between the Driver and Darla.

“Well then you ain’t been out long enough, you drive like a stalker.” He tossed his cig, and lit another.

I wasn’t going to argue, I just wanted him to go away. I had no idea what to say, how to handle this. It was years since I was last in a place like this, years since I left my Mother behind. Left everything behind. I was rusty, before I could say anything, he spoke again.

“Ya don’t want me to follow ya? Fine, I’ll be on my way. S’just when I noticed you, I felt like you might *need* someone to drive along with.” He offered me a smoke.

Without thinking I took it. He handed me a lighter, we both smoked in silence for a time. As we did I could feel the turn of the earth under my feet.

“I appreciate it, and yes sometimes I just need friends on the road.” I finished smoking, threw the butt away, and began to walk back to Darla. “Thanks for the smoke, but I prefer more anonymous company. I’m leavin’. Don’t fuckin’ follow me.”

“Well Yer welcome Tex! thanks for the miles.” The Driver stood there, His eyes still fixed.

When I got behind the wheel, I realized why the Driver’s eyes bore through me. Why did his voice put such fear in my veins? I pulled out from the rest stop, and went along to find a better place to sleep. When I think back to the night My Father left, It’s not the screaming, the tears, the threats, or even the rain I remember most. It’s my Father’s eyes. The way he looked at me as I curled into myself in the back seat. The way he looked at me with his eldest son holding a knife to his throat. The way we locked eyes before he walked out into the night. The Driver, with all his mystery, all the smoke, all the miles on his face had those same eyes.

I got my silence back after a while. I spent time winding through the mountains, looping back into the Redwoods again, and again. Any back road I could find, any isolation from the world I could afford myself. Even in my freedom, the meeting with that man made me feel naked. I’m no longer afraid of the freedom I have. I haven’t been for years. The only thing that scares me, is the freedom other people hold. Nature is fair, you either are or you aren’t. You are safe, or you are not. You are hungry, or you are sated. You are alive, or you are dead.

The road, for all I talk about the freedom it has, does come with rules. Speed limits, traffic laws, parking restrictions. It’s an extension of Humans nature into Nature. It’s freedom with training wheels. I forget that from time to time. I glorify my disconnection from it all, but I’ve still got Darla. I’ve still got the road. I wanted to shake off the night, to shake off the Driver. So I found a mountain trail made of dirt. I found somewhere more “natural” than “Natural”. The search brought comfort, reassurance.

In the early house of the night I found myself on the dirt I was hunting for. A shoulder I could rest on. Trees enveloping me away from anything that could chain me to the past. As the rain let up, I was comfortably alone again. Darla kept me safe, old blankets kept me warm. I was eager to get the night behind me, and move on to another place ahead. As I thought of places to get next as everything went blissfully black.

I don’t know how many hours later, I woke up. A pure still dark mixed with the sound of branches in the wind was everything. I felt confused, it was still night, the stress of everything must have made me sleep like shit. I reached for the wheel, but found nothing. I figured I must’ve just been confused. That’s when I realized I was unexpectedly cold. I began to notice how different the air felt around me. Then I saw it, Darla’s doors were open, and I was yards away on the ground.

My eyes widened as I began to adjust to the dark. My legs were jelly as I rose to my feet. Fear ate at my stomach as blood rushed through me. Slowly, I walked towards Darla. The Driver and Passenger door were wide open, she was still off. I scrambled to the driver's seat, and shut the doors as fast as I could. I checked the back seat. I locked every door. My heart thundered in my chest, Darla’s engine roared to life to match it. Although before I could drive away, I saw it.

Darla’s headlights cut the dark ahead of me, and there he was. Between the Redwoods, towering into the night sky, The Driver stood in front of his car. Parked just at the edge of the shoulder, He puffed his cigarette, and smiled.

“Heya Tex.” he said, somehow clear as day.

I fled from everything. I drove as far, and as fast as I could. I didn’t pay attention to which state I ended up in, I didn’t care about where I was going. All I could do was peer over my shoulder begging for the man in black to not appear.
