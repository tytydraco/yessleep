I live practically in the Middle of nowhere, in a small House. The Woods behind me, a massive Field in front of me. It's near a Military Fort, so it was uncommon for a part of a Division or a few Soldiers to pass by. In rare cases, they even chatted with me while we had some booze.

However, the past week was different. More and more mercenaries started coming into the Fort, and none left. At first, I joked about it to myself. Calling it a walking dead reference, considering we're in Georgia.

It started on Tuesday, a humvee drove by carrying some Guys in green suits. They seemed important and were checking out what seemed to be a Map. A Whirlybird also followed them, four soldiers sitting on both edges dangling their Legs. Nothing happened afterward.

Wednesday was uneventful. In the distance, I heard two Helicopters. One was a small Whirlybird, like on Tuesday but the other sounded massive, like one of those big transport Choppers, I managed to catch a glimpse for a second in the Horizon while outside. A huge Box of something was hanging on several ropes from the larger helicopter.

Thursday was when the situation became tense. Some Vehicles were carrying Artillery, and the Soldiers there had gas masks, and some even had flamethrowers. They all stared at me from a distance as I watched from the Window while making my Omelette. In the Evening some Guys came to my house, acting as if they wanted to drink a beer and chat, just like they uncommonly do. Absolutely nothing could stop me from noticing more and more Artillery being transported, while some sound came from the direction of the Fort.

on Friday they snuck their way into the woods behind my house while something rumbled in the distance. They had Flamethrowers, just like the Guys that ran towards the "Fort", which I am starting to think was a research facility. I blared my podcast through my earphones as loud as possible to distract myself from the Flamethrowers annihilating the Trees.

I finally snapped once the entire Force the army had been accumulating since Thursday started to retreat in a hurry. Some of them were left behind, shot as they fell from the Vehicles. There was something different about them.  I wanted to step outside, but I feared they would shoot me for witnessing the event.

I decided to lock myself in my Room, waiting for them to pass as I tried to make sense of what I witnessed. I was torn out of my thinking by laughter from the Forest. Just this once, I thought of peeking through my Window. One of the Soldiers tore what seemed to be a Mushroom, though I am not completely sure, from a Branch. He took his Mask and threw it away as he shoved the plant in his Mouth.

Just barely, I heard sizzling. Visible damage was being done to his lower jaw something was corroding it, almost as if he poured a bunch of acid into his mouth. As his Jaw finally fell after tiny pieces of flesh fell off, I could see some kind of green mist, which confirmed my fungi theory. It shed its spores after destroying that army guy's lower skull.

I barricaded my window and began comprehending **that.** I was obviously in shock, just staring a hole into my ceiling. The fungi were acidic, that's obvious, but why was that guy laughing while eating it?

I jumped from my bed and began shuffling through my closet. "Shit", I whimpered, realizing I left my "just-in-case" gas mask upstairs. So I leaped into my sheets and attempted to sleep, but I simply couldn't and just stared into the wall, while my mind tried to do something with the things I saw.

I got up late, at almost 11 o'clock. I unlocked the door, walked into my living room, and instantly investigated the cabinets in search of my gas mask. Once my hands touched it I got dressed and grabbed a fire torch and some cologne.

I opened the Door and investigated the strange mushroom, trying my best to ignore the corpse. For some reason I felt attracted to it, I felt *good.* The same good feeling I got while eating fast food or winning a round in a video game.

I touched it and burned myself. The air was full of these spores. With the range they covered the shrooms' would be growing a full 32 feet from where the forest line ended, covering half my house.

That "good" feeling continued before I noticed I had not adequately fastened my mask. It was now correctly on, and that feeling became immensely weaker, but it was still there. I felt some kind of attraction to the fungi.

&#x200B;

Over the next few hours, I observed the spread of the thing, and I noticed more and more of them. I became panicked, and I wanted to barricade my windows to not let the spores in, but I felt a sensation to just let them in. I managed to resist and there was no sunlight coming in. I tried to turn on the lights, but the lightbulbs failed. So did the TV. The government cut off this small patch of land.

I double-checked everything to see if it was shut, however, I forgot about the chimney that led directly into my house. It was too late, but I could never have shut it. The spores would get through no matter what. I watched as the feeling returned. I can only describe this feeling as my dopamine receptors being completely fried. 

I can feel the sensation getting stronger. My fingers are twitching, going away from the keyboard. Thank god I got some random grammar mistake correction program. If I do not update, that means I couldn't resist and failed myself,

Even the gas mask isn't working. I had inhaled too many of them while the mask wasn't properly attached. 

If you can determine where I am, please avoid that area at all costs. I can't think clearly. It has infected me, however, I'm not going to be turning into some zombie. It's forcing my brain to release an insane amount of dopamine when I'm around it. I'm losing control, I finally know why that soldier tried to eat it.

It prays upon humans by giving us a good feeling when we are around it. Eventually, you lose control, and you must be around it. Your brain thinks you'll get another pump of dopamine if you do anything with it, so you eat it, bathe in it, I don't fucking know!

And don't touch it, because it doesn't just produce spores, but also a liquid, and it does not like human flesh.
