"You think we'll catch one this time?" I ask my friend, Tanner. Tanner gives me an eager grin and holds up a nice big container of premium bait-- the kind that costed a fortune, plus more for overnight shipping. Thankfully, payday came right on time and so money wasn't much of an object for me.

"A little of this n' ol' reliable here," he gestures to his fishing rod with his free hand, keeping the other on the wheel, "Yeah... It'll be a nice payout fer sure!" The two of us high-five and cheer. Finally, for the first time in five years since we'd been doing this shit, making weekend fishing trips down to Lake Waikiki, just along the edge of Terrace county, we might *actually* come home with more than *maybe* a quarter of a bucketful of carps and crappies and mackerels. No, this time, we were looking for some nice, big, juicy catches; catfish, cod, or hell, maybe even a bass or two. I'd have died of excitement if we could net a trout, but I was pretty well sure by this point that we'd have better chances at winning the million dollar Powerball than that.

We approach the opening of the lake when Tanner stops. "Gotta piss dude?" he asks. I shake my head. "'Kay, well, I do, so sit tight for a sec."

"Hold on a sec, didn't you just use it like, not even ten minutes ago?" He shrugs.

"What can I say? You know that Dew goes right through me." He slams the door and makes for the nearest tree. I just roll my eyes. Typical fuckin' Tanner.

As I'm waiting, I see out my window, somewhere in the trees on my right, two large orbs, seemingly facing me. I lean in to try for a closer look. I can't see anything, other than the circles.

"What're you looking at?" Tanner asks, startling me as he gets in the car. I look at him and tell him about what I was seeing in the woods. When he leans in, his eyes squint and he asks me, "What orbs?"

"Right there, Tan, can't you se--" I cut off. When I look in the trees again, nothing's there. I frown. *What the hell?*

"Boy, Ian, I ever tell you how I think you need to lay off them melly-tony gummies."

"Melatonin?" I ask, annoyed.

"Yeah, those."

I roll my eyes and reply, "Only a thousand damn times."

"Well, here's a thousand an' one. You r*eally* outta lay off the stuff, man, it's makin' ya so tired you're hallucinatin'."

"Tan, I wasn't hallucinating, there *was* something there."

"Prolly a deer or somethin'."

"Deer my ass. What deer you know of that has eyes the size of dinner plates and glow like that?"

"Glow?" He scoffs. "Christ, see what I mean, man, you're seein' crazy shit."

I roll my eyes and reply, "Whatever, I know I saw somethin' watching me in the woods over there."

"Yeah, well, why don't you forget about that, and focus on "watchin'" the big ass bucketful o' fish we'll be bringin' home." He whoops again. I grin, anxiety and annoyance melt away, and cheer alongside him. "Hold on, mama!" he exclaims, "Tan n' Ian'll be bringin' home a fish fillet!"

We howl, something we always do whenever we believed we'd strike it big at the lake. This time is different, though. I can't explain it, but somehow I can *feel* it. We were going to make out with this haul like a couple of bandits. I just *knew* it.

We park just a little ways out from the lake itself, maybe only two or three yards out, and eagerly unpack our stuff from his SUV. Then, fishing rods in hand, the two of us then hit the lake. Tanner casts his line first, hastily hooking his bait. I choose to take my time, taking extra care to actually secure my bait. To his credit, despite his eagerness, only a few seconds pass by before Tanner's line actually begins to shake and jerk.

"Oh shit, Ian, I caught one!" he squeals with almost childike excitement. My eyes swell with my own excitement. Not even a minute since arriving, and we were already hitting paydirt. The line jerks harder and harder. "Whoa! Jesus, Ian, this sombitch's gonna be huuu--" Before he can finish, one great jerk from the pole brings both it and Tanner into the lake.

I laugh. *Dumbass.* He stays under the water for almost 30 seconds before his head pops up again, gasping desperately for air. "You get enough to drink there, pal?" I joke.

He catches his breath and says, "You shoulda seen it, Ian! God, talk about a prize winner."

I laugh and remark, "I'll bet so" as he swims his way back to the bank. Just before his hand can reach dry land, he stops, something from under the surface appearing to pull him back under. I see him struggling. His face, once its regular, easy-going self, is now gripped with panic.

I hear his voice cry out, yet nothing is heard as his speech is cut off by the water flooding into his agape mouth. Alarmed, I rush over to try and pull him onto the bank. His arms are flailing wildly. They manage to grasp mine, only for him, in his panicked state, to start pulling me in as well. Tanner, or rather, the thing pulling Tanner down, gives a mighty jerk on his leg, instantly submerging him and just about takes me under as well.

About half my forearm is now under the surface of Lake Waikiki and I can feel Tanner's gorilla-tight grip start to slip from me. I tighten my grasp, but I know, deep down, that it's no use. Whatever had snagged Tanner, had him good. There was no getting him out.

Finally, his hand slips from mine completely. I attempt to reach further deep into the lake to try grabbing him again, but even with my arm all the way under, all the way up to my shoulder, Tanner is nowhere to be found. "Tan!" I shout. "Tan! Tanner!"

No reply greets me.

I lean close to the river, hoping I can look and see him there, hoping he's somehow still alive. The depths of the lake are murky, pitch dark and fathomless. As far as I can see, there isn't even any kind of sea floor here, only a ravenous abyss, ready to swallow any and everything above it in the lake whole. "Tanner!" I scream again, pathetically.

\*\*\*

I've lived that day out so many times now. Making a long and rather painful story short, I drove off after that, making a beeline for the nearest payphone. I called for the State Trooper and the local ranger to come out to Lake Waikiki to try and look for him. Needless to say, that was about as futile as me screaming his name at the lake.

I'll give them this, though, they weren't ones to give up easily. I remember hearing that they combed over the entire mountain for almost a year before finally waving the white flag. In that time, not even so much as a shred of his clothing was found while dragging the lake. Essentially, Tanner Westwood had ceased to exist in every way, save for a heartbreaking memory, the instant his head went under the water that final time.

Over time, naturally, I guess, people slowly forgot or "moved on." "Missing" posters with his face on it stopped being posted and his picture on the milk cartons eventually got replaced with the next missing person. I would be the only exception to this.

Before I go any further here, I want you all to know that I did, I *tried* to forget. I *tried* to move on. I even moved out of the town about a year after. No matter what, though, I couldn't get him out of my mind, okay? I couldn't sleep, at night or during the day.

Every time my eyes would close, I'd see his face, his terrified eyes, screaming at me, begging me to save him. I'd see them for only a second, just long enough for my mind to register and sear the image permanently into my brain, before they'd get swallowed by the black pit around them. I tried therapy, where the best advice they could give was to continue telling me, past the point of turning blue in the face, that it wasn't my fault-- as if I didn't already know that. I tried this, and I even checked myself into the seventh floor for a few days, after just barely talking myself away from a ledge. I stayed there for about another month, I remember, hearing the same thing as the therapist: *"It's not your fault."*

Look, I know it wasn't my fault that he'd disappeared. A fucking idiot could've told you that. Hell, what do you think this is here; a fucking idiot telling you how his best friend's disappearance wasn't his fault. What *was* my fault was the fact that more wasn't being done to find him. *That* was what I just couldn't live with.

Would you have been able to? If it was *your* friend or *your* wife, God forbid, would *you* have been able to just "let go" or "move on"? If so, then I guess I commend you. You're a hell of a lot less likely to end up in a situation like this.

It was a month ago, almost 28 years ago to the day he vanished. I had spent the past three years taking courses on deep sea diving. I know, I know, I can hear your question now; isn't deep sea diving meant for oceans, you know, *large* bodies of water, not lakes? Well, in most cases, yeah, you'd be right. Remember though, Lake Waikiki wasn't like most lakes. Being perfectly honest, it might as damn well have been an ocean, deep and murky as it was; a very small, very calm ocean at the base of the mountain overlooking Terrace County.

I had just completed the final course in the training I was in and was putting plans in place to execute my plan: to find my best friend, whatever may or may not be left of him. The way I understood it, there would be at least *something* of him down there. Even if it was just his damn hat, his "lucky" *Coca-Cola* ball cap, it'd still be something. I'd still be able to have *some* kind of "closure", knowing that I'd at least brought a part of him back home.

I was packing my suitcase when I heard my phone ringing, a call from a friend of mine that I'd made throughout the course of my time at the diving course, Devin. I answered the phone.

"Ian, you still there? At your house, I mean." I sighed, rolling my eyes and answering that I was. I knew what was coming. *"I'm telling you man, don't do this, it's not your fault"*, or some bullshit to that effect. He'd only been repeating that line to me ever since I'd made the mistake of actually telling him my plan last year.

"Okay, well let me know when you head out for the airport. I'm heading there myself." I crossed my eyebrows.

"Uh... O-Okay..."

"Look man, I know how important this is to you and I've already come to terms with the fact that I can't stop you, but I am gonna at least see this through with you, got it?" My eyes shot wide open and my heart rate skyrocketed, almost to the same degree it did the day Tanner died. Before I could start belting out protests over the phone, though, he shoots me with "Don't even bother trying to object, either, pal. We went through classes together, we're gonna go through the real thing together, that's all there is to it."

My breath caught in my throat, starting to choke me. I was caught between chancing an objection anyway, and just hanging up the phone and fucking vomiting right where I was standing. In the end, I did neither and instead just replied, stammering, "O-O-Okay..."

"Good, I'll meet ya at the airport. see ya." He hung up after that, leaving my stupefied brain to try and make sense of what the hell just happened. It was a good ten to fifteen minutes before I refocused myself and finished packing everything. It was a half hour till noon when I left my house and got on the road to the airport and about a quarter past when I finally arrived. On the way there, I was silently praying Devin wasn't serious, that he wasn't *actually* making his way to the airport and wasn't *actually* serious when he insisted on joining me on this little crusade of mine.

As if I'd be that lucky. First thing I see when I get inside is his smug, waving grin as he wildly flagged me down like we were lifelong friends ourselves, not just a couple of training buddies. "Well there, you finally made it. What, you stop for drive-thru on the way or somethin'?" I replied with only a small smile.

As it turned out, we'd arrived with at least another hour and a half or two before boarding, so the two of us ordered a small bite from the food court and sat near where our flight was supposed to board. He began talking to me about something, I *think* it was about his last trip in the mountains or his last trip to the beach or something, I didn't really listen though. My mind was on one track, and one track only: find Tanner, what's left of him anyway, and bring him home.

Finally, time came for the flight to board and we got up and went. From that point on throughout the flight, there wasn't much interaction between me and Devin, with the exception of when he was telling me that he was going to the restroom or asking me if I was needing anything when he flagged down one of the attendants. The flight itself was only about five and a half hours long.

When we landed back in my old hometown, I remember how hauntingly familiar the scent was in the air. Strange as it sounds, I could actually smell Lake Waikiki all the way from the airport. The salty sort of scent, marshy and humid. Call it PTSD or "flashbacks", but a small part of me seriously wondered if this was a good idea. Was this really going to be worth it?

Almost as soon as the question presented itself, I shoved it down. Of course it was worth it, and even if it weren't, even if it *were* a terrible idea, would I be able to live with myself if I didn't do this? The answer to that, at least in my mind then, was absolutely not.

As I stepped off the plane, Devin came up behind me and quipped, "So this's your ol' stomping grounds, huh?" He chuckled when he said this.

I nodded and replied, "Yep, this's home", sighing.

*Welcome home, Ian...*

From the airport, he and I called an Uber for the nearest hotel. One of the good things I'll say about my hometown is just how cheap hotel rooms are. Basically, think of the price of shitty, run-down motels, maybe pump it up by $50 ($75 for the more extravagant suites) and you'd have the price of some admittedly comfy as hell suites there. That's right, while the entire rest of the world is apparently struggling for affordable housing, my hometown seemed to miss the memo and just decided *"Hey, let's make housing affordable even if you're dirt poor and/or have shit credit!"*

Anyway, so we managed to land one of the slightly more expensive suites I was talking about and quickly set up camp there. I can remember that I was already half-unpacked when Devin asked me, "Hey man, what's the rush?" I looked at him, raising an eyebrow. "You look like you're having an episode here."

He gestured down at the floor to my pile of clothes and equipment, haphazardly sort of strewn across the floor around me from where I, albeit unconsciously, began yanking them out of the suitcase. Admittedly, I was kind of taken by surprise, the way you would when your mind's just so fired up, so dead set on one thing, one objective, that you go blank in the head and then you come to again. That's what happened here, anyway.

"S-Sorry, just..." I sighed. "Just thought I'd go ahead and get ready."

"For what?"

"For what we came here for." I looked sideways at him, silently asking him *"What the hell else would I be getting ready for? A parade?"*

"Wait, you're actually wanting to go *now*?" Now he was looking sideways at me, asking ME what the hell I was thinking.

"Why not?"

"Ahem..." He pointed to the window. I looked out and saw immediately where this conversation was going. So lost in thought, I was, that it didn't once occur to me to look at the time-- or the sun for that matter.

I sighed in defeat and got up from where I was and went to the couch. In front of me sat a 65" flatscreen TV, Spectrum cable box, and the standard TV guide telling you what channels were available. Hundreds of channels to choose from and what did I decide on? A blank screen. Yeah, turns out, when your missing friend is the only thing you can think about, you don't exactly have any sort of "appetite", I guess you can say, for live television.

Devin came and sat down beside me, about two cushions away, with a bottle of Guinness and a couple of shot glasses in his hands. Normally, I'm not one for drinking, never really could stand the taste, especially for liquor, but this time around, I didn't really have it in me to tell him no when he offered. *Maybe I do need a couple shots,* I thought as my throat almost immediately began to burn. *Maybe I can clear my head a little with it...*

Obviously, and something else I didn't take into consideration, thanks to the fact that I wasn't a regular boozehound, I obviously had next to no tolerance for it, either, and so it only took about five or six good swallows before I ended up passing out, right there on the couch. I was OUT, too. A fire could've broke out and my ass would've cooked until it was well done before I would've realized it.

I woke up, God only knew how much later, and it was just after sunrise. Devin was in the bathroom, showering, and so I took to finishing what I started the previous day and unpacked the rest of my stuff. I will say one more thing about me blacking out that night, and that's that for the first time in over 28 years, I actually got a good, full night's sleep *without* the memory of Tanner tormenting me. The downside to this, though, I guess, is that now, the only thing I could do with this rush of renewed energy was to make a beeline as quickly as possible to Lake Waikiki.

I quickly picked up my suitcase with my gear and was making my way out to pack the car when Devin came out with a mug of coffee and asked me what the hell I was doing. I told him and he just scoffed.

"You're serious?" he asked, trying to not bust up laughing in my face. "Buddy, it ain't even 10:00 yet, why don't we--" I stopped him by holding up my hand.

"I know it's early, which means if we leave now, there's a better chance of being able to do what we came to do and get back before the sun goes down." He stared blankly at me for a second like he wanted to say something in protest but couldn't find the words. I added, "Unless you're telling me you actually *want* to camp out there overnight."

Without another word, Devin lowered his head, signaling his resignation and I headed out to put my stuff in the car. I told him to throw his clothes on and grab his gear and that we'd be wheels up in the next five minutes. It took him seven minutes, having wasted at least a minute and a half finishing his damn coffee, but finally, we were on the road for the lake. Before we'd even hit the stretch of road again, I was already reliving the drive with Tanner again, only this time, there weren't any of the jokes, no excitement, and overall just none of the cheer from that day.

If I can be perfectly honest here, I admit a small part of me was fighting back tears here. Another part of me wanted to laugh. Irony has its own sense of humor, doesn't it? A place which used to bring hours upon hours of enjoyment to me and my best friend, now just a memory, a constant reminder, an embodiment of loss for me. It was, it was everything I could do to just keep my eyes forward, keeping focus on the road.

At one point though, I remember just feeling the urge to stop the car. I couldn't tell you why, but somehow there was this... This *compulsion*, I guess, to stop the car. Somehow, I could feel the distinct sense that there were eyes on me, somewhere. After a second, though, I came to the realization that it was because I was on the stretch of road I was on when I saw the orbs in the trees, the ones Tanner swore were just the "eyes of a deer". Even with this, I still couldn't resist looking at the trees, wondering if I'd see them again.

I wondered, too, if maybe there was more to them that I'd see. See, I'd never forgotten that moment, either, obviously. Now, at the time, I never really connected any dots between them and what happened to Tanner, but on the drive there now, the idea seemed to creep up more and more on me. I shook my head. *Get out of your head...*

"Whoa, look out!" shouted Devin. I snapped back to reality to find that I'd damn near wrapped the both of us around a tree. I managed to veer to the right just in time, getting us back on the road. I had to stop then.

We took a second to catch our breaths before Devin exclaimed, "What in holy God's name was that?!"

"Wh-What?" I asked in response. My brain basically reset itself just after I'd stopped the car.

"What do you mean, "What?", you just about killed us!" He was shouting all of this right in my ear, breathless. I remember looking around, for a second not even recognizing the area around me. "You gonna tell me what's up?" I looked at him, mouth hanging open like an idiot.

He began getting out of the car and came walking over to the driver side. He opened my door and said, "Okay, hop out, we're switching."

"Wait, what?"

"I said we're switching. You tell me where this lake of yours is and I'll drive."

"What, no, I can--"

"Uh-uh, you had your shot, and you just about turned both of us into another driving hazard statistic. I mean it, out!" I sat there, staring back at him for a good five seconds, scanning his adamant face for perhaps any sort of leniency, some sign that I might be able to change his mind, but found none. I sighed and climbed out, walking over and getting into the passenger seat.

"Okay, now, tell me where this lake's at."

I pointed straight and replied, "It's about another half a mile straight and then you'll turn right at the bend. You'll see the sign by then." Under my breath, I can remember grumbling, *"Unless you're blind."*

He scoffed-- guess I wasn't as quiet as I thought-- and remarked, "This coming from the one that tried to turn us into wrapping paper for that tree back there."

"Just... Just drive." He sighed and got the car moving again. Like I told him, he kept going straight until we came up to the curve, where he took the right. There it stood then, The "Welcome to Lake Waikiki" sign, standing firm at the opening of the trail leading straight into the lake, staring me right in the face. Believe it or not, I could sort of hear it, laughing, calling out to me; *"Welcome back, Ian. It's been so long..."*

The car stopped and Devin stepped out. I didn't move, though. I couldn't.

Devin looked through the window at me and yelled, "Yo, You comin'?" My ears barely registered his voice. Looking ahead of me at the opening of the trail, I could swear I saw Tanner standing there, right next to the sign, waving me over. I could hear him calling out to me, too, *"Come on in, Ian..."*

*("You should see the size of it, man...")*

*"The water's just..."*

*("Talk about a prize-winnin' ca--")*

*"...Fine."*

"Ian!" My heart jumped into my throat. I looked to my right, seeing Devin still standing there, tapping on the window. "Yo, we goin' in or what?" I exchanged one more absent minded back and forth between him and the trail before finally unbuckling and stepping out. The second I did, the sickeningly familiar marshy scent just about made me gag.

I could taste the lake through the air, salty and thick. Humid and heavy. Suddenly, I was finding it extremely hard to breathe. "Yo, you okay man?" asked Devin, already having reached the opening of the trail. I looked at him and behind him, I saw Tanner, standing deep in the woods, waving at me.

*"Come on, pal. You GOTTA see the size of these fish..."*

His voice echoed, like he was shouting at me from the other end of a cave. Devin started looking behind himself before walking back toward me. I stayed frozen where I was. He was about 3/4 of the way to me when Tanner's voice called out to me again. *"What're you waitin' fer, Ian?"*

His voice then changed somehow, sounding deeper, echoing even more. I couldn't explain it at the time, but I felt somehow like this wasn't *just* my ears screwing with me. This wasn't just "guilty conscience" or whatever trying to scare me away, no, this was real. This was Tanner's *actual* voice, *actually* there, calling me-- well, sort of anyways. It was *a* voice, we'll put it like that.

With each word following, it distorted itself more and more, until it was to a point where it only remotely resembled Tanner's voice at all. *"Let's catch some fish, Ian. Remember? Don't you wanna catch that prize winnin' fi--"*

I was shaken out of my trance again when I felt Devin's hand on my shoulder. "Ian!" he shouted in my right ear. I snapped to look at him. "Dude, what's going on? Seriously, you're freaking me out here. First you try crashing us into a fuckin' tree, now you're giving me the thousand-yard stare, Jesus man, you keep this up and I'm gonna have to put ya in the nuthouse."

"I-I'm sorry, I..." I trailed off, sighing. Right then, all I felt like wanting to do was curl up and bawl like a fucking baby. He put his hand on my shoulder. I shook him off, telling him I was fine and started towards the opening of the trail. I heard him run up behind me.

"Hey, wait up." I kept walking, gear dragging the ground beside me. My mind cleared itself, wiping itself of everything that didn't have to do with Lake Waikiki and more importantly, finding Tanner.
