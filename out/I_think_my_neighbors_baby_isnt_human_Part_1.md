I can hear it rattling in my memories as I write this.

Hear the memories of its cries as if they were still drilling into my skull, scrambling my brain right now... I say “it”, because it doesn’t sound like any baby I’ve ever heard, or anything I’ve ever heard, period.

I guess I should go back a while, to when I think things really began.

I live in an old apartment building, it used to be a motel I think. Its not that big, and pretty cheap. I won’t say where it is. There’s three floors, I’m on the second. The entrances to each apartment are outside, so I go up the outdoor stairs and walk across the cement balcony to reach mine. I’m not really familiar with the other tenants, I say hi to a few of them if I see them, except for one, my neighbour. I wouldn’t say we’re all that close, or friends or anything, but we’re close enough that we’ve chatted a few times while out for a smoke, and we’ve exchanged Christmas cards the past two Christmases. She lives in the first apartment after the stairs, I’m the second, and there’s two more after me. So there’s four people on each floor.

I can’t say her real name, so to make things simple, let’s just call her Carrie.

I’m not sure when exactly I can say it all “started”, but looking back on it, it must have been last October. It had been around two weeks I think since I’d seen her last, which I didn’t notice or think about at all at the time. Her car was still there, now that I think about it, but I never saw the lights on in her place. Again, its only something that strikes me as odd now that I look back on everything.

Around that same time, there was a new car parked in our lot, a white van. It was parked in a different spot every time I saw it, but not everyone at the apartment had a car so it was no biggie.

One day, when I was coming home from work, it was parked in my spot. The van was on. I just pulled in another spot I knew nobody parked, got out and made my way to the steps, and felt a heavy thump against my head. I almost fell over, shook myself out of my daze and saw a very strangely dressed man that had fallen on his butt from our collision. He was wearing a fancy tuxedo top, but had pajama pants, a pair of big woolly socks, sandals, and on his head... sunglasses, a ski mask, and a medical mask.

“Shit, sorry man, you okay?” I went over to help the strange stranger up.

He backed away from me, almost like he was afraid, and he grabbed at his face, seemed to calm down when he felt the fabric of the mask. He touched his glasses, to make sure they were still in place.

If he was trying to hide his identity, he sure wasn’t being subtle about it. Then, he did something even stranger, he suddenly jumped up, grabbed me by the shoulder and said, “Shit, sorry man, you okay?”

I thought he was making fun of me at first, the way he said it just like me, but it was impossible to tell with his mask, and the guy was absolutely SHAKING.

He repeated himself, squeezed a bit harder on my shoulder and I shook him off, watched him with my mouth dropped as he ran in a full sprint to the white van. There was someone else in there, in the passenger seat. I think a woman. The masked guy did a double-take at me before slamming the door and speeding off, almost taking out the stop sign.

I scratched my head, laughed it off when I got to my apartment. The next day, he was parked outside on the curb when I got back from work, and the next morning, the next evening. On the third night, I heard something from Carrie’s apartment. The walls are a little thin, if someone is yelling or stomps or drops something, you can hear it. It’s not too bad, and it’s usually never a problem.

It was Carrie’s voice. It sounded like she was arguing with someone. I tried not to eavesdrop, but I couldn’t help overhearing her yell again after a pause. It almost sounded like... she was talking to herself. I couldn’t hear the exact words, but that’s what the tone of her voice seemed like.

Then, something dropped with a heavy thud, and I heard what sounded like sobbing, and another voice.

I went to bed.

Around 2:30am, I woke up in a cold sweat. I had a terrible nightmare that I didn’t remember, and I really needed to piss.

As I stumbled through the dark, I could make out a dim glow outside the front window. I slowly groped through the shadows until I was bathed in that glow. It was a deep white, a pale white. If that makes sense. I tried to see where it was coming from through the window, and I saw something that absolutely boggled my mind. Outside, the glow was made up of white, and black, like a chess-board, or a zebra print. Or the static on a television screen. It was swirling, twisting in strange patterns, like some kind of weird disco light, and it was most prevalent in front of Carrie’s apartment. I’d seen some wonky lights at raves and stuff before, but this was something else entirely, I’d never seen anything like it. I struggle to even describe it properly. Light doesn’t work the way that glow did.

Bewildered, I leaned in and then I heard a low noise. A sort of whistling, or piping, coming from behind the walls, from Carrie’s.

Then, a thud like earlier, a scream from Carrie, and I was assaulted by a splitting headache. The world around me swam, the swirling glow of white and black intensified, and then there was only darkness.

When my eyes opened, I was laying in bed. My bedroom door was open. I got up, checked out the window. There was no glow, the only light was from the lights on the stairs and the streetlights below.

I must have been dreaming, I thought. I put my hands on the window sill and kind of caught my bearings, when I noticed movement outside. Light was cast across the balcony. Carrie’s door had opened, and the light from within began to be blotted out as a long shadow formed into view. Someone was emerging.

A hooded figure, turned towards the staircase as it came out. He started whistling quietly, a low soft whistle. I scanned over the flip flops and socks on his feet... then my eyes locked on the shadow he was casting. There was something about it that made my head hurt. It didn’t have the right shape... It wasn’t a trick of the light, I’m certain of that now. It was misshapen, disarrayed. Its arms... there were limbs that weren’t there, jutting appendages I couldn’t describe to you, and the whole shadow was rippling. Rippling like it wasn’t only a shadow, like it was made of liquid, or something else, and I could see bits and splotches of white bubbling within.

I was so hypnotized by the strange phenomenon, that I didn’t realize the figure had turned and was staring at me through the window. He wore the same ski-mask and sunglasses, and underneath on the seams of the mask, on the tiny parts I could see behind the sunglasses... the glow was seeping out. Swirling black and white. Like it was bursting at the seams, something solid or liquid, and not just light. Just barely held back, on the verge of leaking out...

A cloud passed over the moon, and we kept staring at each other for longer than I ever would have wanted, when the thing suddenly turned around and walked away, going down the steps with quick soundless steps.

My head was throbbing, I put a chair against the door and stumbled back into my room. As I drifted off, overwhelmed by another headache, I heard what sounded like Carrie sobbing from behind the wall.

When I woke up, I told myself it was just a fever dream. Now I know different.

That next evening, I saw Carrie. She looked like shit. I said hello, but she just stared at me and grinned. It was like she hadn’t got any sleep all week, she was completely disheveled, but she was still chipper, happy, real happy. Like she’d won the lottery or something.

When I saw her again, she still wouldn’t respond to me. Just smiled dumbly.

I didn’t see her for a long while after that. Her car was almost never in the driveway. It was December, a week before Christmas, I think, that I bumped into her outside her door.

“Hey Carrie, long time no see...”

She seemed tired, but more like her old self again, “Yeah, how ya been?”

“Oh you know, got some early Christmas shopping done,”

She noticed me staring at something she held in her hand.

“Oh, you wonderin’ about this?” she was holding it like a cigarette, “Just the stick of a sucker. I’ve been eating them like crazy to fill the habit of smoking...”

“You quit?”

“Yeah, with the baby coming and all... I want them to be strong and healthy...”

“You’re pregnant?”

“Yeah, see? I’m starting to get a bump...”

“Congratulations!”

“Yeah... shit, it’s been tough quitting, but I’m pulling through for my baby...”

We chatted about other stuff for a few more minutes, I was glad to see she was doing alright. I forgot to ask about the father.

Things kind of went back to normal. Then, when she started to get more visibly pregnant, she started to change. She came out less, spoke less, and she looked real exhausted all the time. She was really thin, too.

Again, only notable in retrospect. Pregnancy is rough, obviously.

Then she started acting real strange around a month ago. She stopped responding to me again, and it seemed almost like she was in a trance, like she was barely actually conscious. One night, when I was coming home from work, I jumped when I happened to glance towards her window when I passed it.

A ghastly face, sunken eyes and pale skin was pressed right up against the glass. I didn’t immediately register it as her at first, I legitimately thought I had seen a ghost.

I thought she was glaring at me, but she hadn’t even noticed me. She was staring off into empty space, or maybe somewhere in the distance. Feeling a chill creep up my spine, I went in my apartment and got ready for bed.

The next morning, she was in that same spot again, still not acknowledging me at all. She was there again when I came back home. And the next morning, and the next night. Again, and again, it was almost like she didn’t move at all, like she’d frozen there 24/7 or turned into a statue. But the curtains would sometimes move, be almost closed, so she was just peering out through a little slit between them. She would always be watching. For something.

Then suddenly, she stopped.

I came home to find her standing outside her door. Like she usually did, a big smile on her face again. She waved to me, and said hello, “The baby’s coming soon.”

“Congrats...” I was taken aback, we hadn’t spoken in months. She smiled wider and watched me happily as I went in my apartment.

She was all smiles again the next day.

Then, a week ago, when I was pulling into the parking lot, I saw flashing lights as I approached. There was an ambulance and a cop car in the lot, I got out, saw them carrying her into the back of the ambulance and caught one glimpse at her face. Smiling. A big, wide smile that looked like it hurt, like she had been holding it since I last saw her.

Presumably, she was in the hospital for a few days.

Four days ago, she came back. I heard the muffled cries of the baby through the walls. The delivery had been a success.

It had only been 7 months. Less, I think. It’s very rare for a baby to survive a delivery at only 7 months.

Night came.

I fell asleep around midnight.

An hour later, I was jolted awake by a shrill noise from beyond the wall. Crying. I sighed... It wasn’t too loud, really, but I was considering getting some earmuffs or plugs the next day.

I stared at the ceiling until the baby’s crying died down, and then my eyes started to close on their own... just before I drifted off, I caught something from under my door... white. Just like that night, all those months ago. I pinched myself to make sure it wasn’t a dream, realized then that last time it hadn’t been a dream either. I jumped up out of the bed, curiosity grabbing a hold of me, and I opened the door of my bedroom, the glow suddenly blinking out as I did so.

I was in the dark again, I stood there dumbly for maybe a minute, wondering if I was just overtired, then made my way back to my room, and just as I passed the threshold, I heard it.

A low piping, or whistling... and someone begging, pleading from beyond the wall, from Carrie’s. The whistling garbled, turned into crying, there was a pause and one more plea, and then the baby started wailing. I sighed again, but that wail warped into something I struggle to describe and made me choke on my own breath.

Its difficult to find the words to describe that noise, even though it has been haunting me incessantly these past nights, assaulting my ears, my mind, rattling my skull, making me want to take a knife and bring it to my ears and

It started as a whistling, or almost like a chirping, a chirping that sounded like it came from a big bloated cricket, but with a tint to it that was almost mechanical, no, digital, like some kind of beeping or whirring from a malfunctioning computer. And then there was squealing. Like a whole herd of pigs being slaughtered, like tires spinning out, or like someone running nails along a chalkboard. All of those tones were overlapped on the intonations of a baby crying. It sounded like it couldn’t be produced by something living, let alone a human infant. It was like someone had taken the rhythms of a baby’s cry and replaced the noise with different sounds. But although I said it sounded mechanical...it wasn’t, I was sure somehow, but it didn’t sound like something living... shit, even that isn’t right. I don’t know.

I just don’t know how to describe it.

I stood there without moving, stunned by the assault on my ears, trying to understand what I was hearing, and failing. The normal crying that woke me up would have served as a nice lullaby compared to whatever THAT was.

My head throbbed, I blacked out for a second, snapping my eyes open and finding myself leaning against the wall. It was hard to stand, I felt exhausted... The sound was almost like a physical *force* pressing down on me.

I slammed my room’s door, locked it and told myself over in over again in my head that I was just dreaming when the sound faded. I guess I must have eventually convinced myself or just succumbed to exhaustion, because I woke up late for work after a dreamless sleep.

In the comforting light of day, I peered at Carrie’s window as I passed. The curtains were closed, and the lights must have been off. Same when I got home at dusk. I heard muffled talking as I passed by, giggling.

Someone else would have heard that "crying" if it was real. Someone else would have done something...

Midnight proved me wrong.
