My buddy Terry started painting as a little kid. Terry had a really good heart, and he always helped others out. He made me feel better growing up. My home life wasn’t easy, but he knew just what to say to help. When he started painting, he would ask me what I wanted him to paint and I would tell him mountains, or the sky or other kid things. He would create these beautiful landscapes even at a young age. They hung on his childhood bedroom walls for years. Terry realized that his painting could help others, and he began to give out paintings in middle school to kids he had heard had a rough life. Terry’s parents were always extremely supportive and made sure he had all the supplies to keep spreading the joy he was known to do.

He really found his niche one day when I came to school crying. Terry asked me what was wrong, and I let him know my cat had gotten out and it was my fault. I told him that I just wished I would’ve remembered to close the sliding glass door. I didn’t understand why he would run away from me. I told him I would never see Peaches again. We called the cat that of course because he was fuzzy, orange and red. He was a really sweet cat. The first painting Terry gave me was this stunning portrait of him a week after I went to school crying. The color of his hair was absolutely stunning. I broke down crying and thanked him so much for the gift. Terry captured him beautifully, even at 11 years old.

In his early 20s, he would hang out at art festivals to sell his works. Many of them sold. His specialty was color. The way he would use them made the paintings stand out from the rest. They really would make you stop and stare at just how tremendously brilliant they were. Although many of the colors were bright, they didn’t look unnatural. His portraits of people were unbelievable. You felt as if they would come right off the canvas and shake your hand. The life in his paintings was so apparent, everyone took notice of him. We called him a rising star.

We lived in a high crime area. Terry would say how appalled he was that so many people would be shot or killed, and nothing was being done. Terry donated a lot of the proceeds from his paintings to families who had recently lost someone. Eventually, Terry felt like he wasn’t doing enough for his community. He proceeded to create an entire installation of individuals who had been murdered in the area in the past 5 years and raised a ton of money for the families. This could be considered extremely morbid but in Terry’s defense, he got permission from all the families to paint the deceased.

At the art gallery, the families crumbled at the base of their loved one’s paintings. By this point Terry was in his 20s and had perfected his gift. These poor individuals who had lost someone so close to them, saw them brought back to life on the canvas. Terry painted 23 people. Everyone donated. Each family received five thousand dollars each directly because of the way he brought the community together. It was one of the most successful charity events in the entire state. Terry was able to inspire us to come together and call the local police to action. We all demanded to know why these people were continuing to show up murdered. His speech at the gallery was a war cry, uniting an army.

Directly because of his actions, police had been under pressure to perform. The community started watching out for each other. People started taking action to improve their living. More and more violent criminals were being locked up. Terry set in motion something that every high crime area needs, people to care enough to do something. Everything started to look like it was going in the right direction. But then his efforts became known to dangerous people. Terry started getting unwanted attention from local gangs. He was followed home often. His house would be covered in graffiti. They tagged gang signs, death threats, and even his social security number. Whether or not he wanted to, Terry became the posterchild for justice in our city, and he was paying for it. Everyone assured him that the people had his back. The community he brought together rallied behind him.

Until we found out Terry was painting his victims, using their blood as the vibrant reds we all praised him for. I still feel sick when I remember what he said to me that day, when he gave me my first painting. I was only 11. He told me with a friendly smile, “It’s Peaches.”
