In this diary, I will document my traumatic experiences of a creepy and unfair world which I went through. I hope someday I can give this book to somebody personally, but... that probably wouldn't happen.  
  
Day One  
  
My name is mike, I'm currently 21 and a US-citizen and worked as a software designer until a certain day.  
  
Everything started when I was going home from a day of work while listening to my favorite music (mostly anime openings). Then it suddenly happened — I lost my senses and passed out. I still don't know why I passed out, but when I woke up, I didn't see any people on the street or in the buildings surrounding me (It was terrifyingly quiet). I rushed home as fast as possible because I sensed a feeling of danger which I couldn't describe. Arrived at home, I firstly locked the front door. I still felt that I was in danger, but the feeling started to lessen. The first thing I did was to take out my phone to search for what happened this day, but the internet didn't work. Suddenly I heard a noise from my door, it was something like scratching. I lost my cool and probably the color drained from my face. Something not human was in front of my door and it most likely followed me to my home. I tried to make as little sound as possible and started to get the shotgun which my friend, who was a mega gun freak, gifted me.  
  
It was a good choice looking back because not long after this, the creature broke through the door. If you were to ask me to describe it, I would say it was a gigantic four-legged beast with awkwardly bent legs and a head that was rather small compared to its body. It also had a long neck which it used to launch its head at me, trying to bite mine off. But to the monster's disadvantage, I had something it didn't... a motherfucking shotgun, so I blasted its head into holey cheese. My thought process was something like this: "Fuck, not good, I gotta go somewhere else. That monster probably ain't alone, and everything within a distance of 5 miles heard my gun." So I took my keys, started my car, and drove as fast as I could. As expected, I saw other monsters which approached my house, but the moment they saw my car, they went after me. So I drove even faster and managed to escape them. As far as I knew, they could only have a top speed of 25 miles per hour. I left the city and tried to drive to the countryside where my friend lived — you know, the one with the guns. I also thought that I would be safe in this fucking wasteland.  
  
Arrived at my friend's house, and the first thing I did was to use the bell. As nobody answered, I decided to just go in. The second thing that I did was to go to the toilet to take the biggest crap in my lifetime, only to discover that the water in the house didn't run. After the deed, I barricaded the door and the windows with wood and nails. After I did those things, I looked for the guns and found them. I decided it would be best to stay the night in the house because it started to get dark. So I laid in the bed of my friend, thinking to myself that everybody I knew... I mean, knew, are truly gone — my work colleagues, my friends, and my family. I slowly began to whine to myself until I fell asleep.
