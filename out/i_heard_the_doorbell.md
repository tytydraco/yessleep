A few nights ago, I was home alone. My girlfriend had gone out to her parents that night, making my house eerily cold and quiet. The news that I had left on was echoing throughout the house, sending constant news stories about house fires and wars happening all throughout. When the doorbell rang, I heard it echo, but I felt like the sound went on for too long.

When I opened the door, nobody was there. I could feel the breeze come inside, almost too warm for an autumn night. I shut the door. It felt, almost, heavier. I'm not sure what the feeling was. I sat back down, shoving cold pasta into my mouth. It was almost 2 am, so I could feel my eyes getting heavier by the minute.

I heard the doorknob rattle. I convinced myself it was just the wind, until I heard scraping at my window. I jumped up, even though it could have been a tree, one of my bushes, or really anything. Why did I think it was a person?

" I must be getting too tired. I need to go to bed NOW." I muttered to myself. I swear I heard someone outside say the same thing as me, almost mimicking me. Same tone, everything. I brushed it off, knowing I was too tired for anything to be real. I grabbed the freezing pasta and brushed my feet on the shag as I walked upstairs.

Sleep didn't come easy. So I grabbed my robe and walked downstairs. The second I passed the door, I heard the doorbell ring. I was done with the madness, so I stepped outside. Nothing. Just my old welcome mat and the dead plant that had been sitting there for 3 months.

I looked near the bushes. It was 2:30, who would be outside at that point? Although I had never done this, I slept outside. Fully. I wanted to see who, or what was out there. Suddenly, the door slammed. It echoed through the neighborhood, the wood on the door almost cracking because it was such a hard slam.

Goosebumps ran down my back, legs, everything. I grabbed the door handle as fast as I could, and opened the door. It got heavier. I sprinted up the stairs, almost tripping over every step. Finally, safe back in my bed. I feel uneasy now, like a knot in my stomach.

What was I thinking? It was probably just a teen, pranking me. I laughed to myself. What did I think it was? It was an animal, most likely. I hoped. I grabbed my phone off of my nightstand and opened the news app on my phone, hoping to see something at least normal.

Suddenly, my phone shut off. Completely. But it wasn't dead. It was charging. I clicked the power button many times. Still nothing. Then, I heard the doorbell. Longer, louder, more and off pitch than the first and second time. Even though I was on the second floor, it felt like the doorbell was right next to me.

Something drew me to the door. It was like I was possessed. My brain said no, but my body said yes. I felt my muscles tighten as I walked down the stairs, each step bringing me closer and closer to the door. I was now in full control of my body, but I needed to see what was bothering me so bad.

I opened the door. This time, when I was pulled out of my house, it was immediate. As I was being pulled, all I could see was darkness. I suddenly gained consciousness outside of my house. I turned around, only to see the door slam.

I felt cold. What happened to the warm autumn night I felt just a few hours ago? I check my watch. It was off, like my phone, too. I felt something grab me from my door. I pivoted, just in time. I saw me through the window.. Standing in my hallway. Grinning. A sudden hit to the top of my head woke me up.

I jolted awake. It was bright outside. My phone was still black. I stood up, my wobbly legs still shaking from last night. Was it really just a dream? It felt so vivid. I thumped down my stairs. The windows shifted from bright white to an eerie black. Just in time for me to see myself in my mirror, grinning. But then I heard the doorbell.
