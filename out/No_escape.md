Day 1: I got invites to a lab facility to do some testing today, not sure what it's about. It seems normal. No creeps or anything. 

Day 2: They put me in a 'testing area', whatever that's supposed to mean. All they said was "survive as long as you can"
Of course I don't know how long so I ask "how long"
They respond with a response that makes my veins fill with blood immediately. "1000 days".

Day 3: It's been 1 day since I've been trapped here. All I have is myself to talk to and my Diary. I get no signal down here. I hope that I'll find food or water soon because I feel awful. 

Day 4: ... 

Day 5: I'm not the only person down here! I found a note from someone their name scribbled out with what looks like blood... It reads " If you've gotten this far by walking, maybe you should start running. Turn to the next page" I was confused. They only used 4 lines of a page and they were telling me to flip the page. It read "look behind you :) ", this sicko had enough time to draw a smiley face. 
Something whispers sending shivers down my spine " Run"

Day 6: I'm seeing hallucinations, however at this point they could be real my sleep deprivation and my thirst are never-ending all I know is that if I stop walking they, whatever they are will catch up. I do not want to find out what "they" are. 

Day 7: 1 week... Feels like a century. However I found a drink! Looks like red wine. It's in a wine bottle so I have no other guess. 

Day 8: It wasn't wine. 

Day??? I've lost track now I don't feel safe ive not been making notes in my diary. I know theyre coming closer I can just feel it. "Looks like you've finished the experiment" I've never felt so much relief. I turn around and there's someone there. Not a scientist it's laughing and sighing at the same time it looks thin and pale... It's not a person it's me... It's a mirror I can't recognize myself anymore. I hear another person someone that seems like they want to do the experiment. My voice is gone and I can't tell them to not do it. Only way I can protect them is by killing them... 

Day :) The experiments are going great, the victims are... Wait what am I doing... 

Day... Suddenly I became all weak someone stood in front of me. "Every time you got more and more delusional and delirious I was the one in control. YOU IDIOT do you really think you have any power. The people testing you aren't scientists they wanted to see what would happen if a demon would steal someones soul. How powerful they would get, or die. They never cared about you. It's been many years since you've came here. And you don't have a say in it. I DID". Now I'm left bleeding out. I guess this is my goodbye. DON'T TRUST THEM THERE IS NO ESCAPE. RUN. RUN. RUN. RUN. RUN.
