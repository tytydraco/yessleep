This all happened a few days ago, but it’s still fresh in my mind. 

I use to work for a relatively big veterinary company, I won’t say the name because well they’re already in enough legal trouble as it is. I was a receptionist and sometimes helped with some bigger surgeries. It was only small jobs though, there goes my Veterinary Medical diploma. 

Around two weeks ago, we had a lady come in with her cat to get neutered and for just a small check-up. The cat was quite old, maybe around seven? Anyways, the following texts are from phone conversations I had with the woman as well as the dates that it happened. These phone calls possibly lead up to my worst day of working yet.



August 18th;

„Hello, this is the veterinary front desk, my name’s Valerie. How may I help you?“

„Hi um, I was here yesterday with my cat, Telly. She was neutered and had just a general check-up?“

„Hang on one second please.“ … „And what is Telly’s last name?“

„McCain.“

…“Ah yes, Telly. How’s everything going? Is she alright?“

„Well um, the thing is I’m not sure. As soon as we got home and she got let out her careier she bolted out and underneath my bed. Not just a little way under either but way at the back and I can’t reach her. She hasn’t come out since and I was just wondering if that’s normal?“

„No need to worry ma’am. Telly should be just fine, it’s normal for animals to want to find a safe space after going through an operation. She should be fine either later today or tomorrow and just keep an eye on her until then. Give her plenty of food and keep her hydrated. Alright?“

„Okay, thank you. Bye.“

„Bye now, and remember to book another appointment to get her stitches out.“



August 21st; 

„Hello, this is the veterinary front office, my name is Valerie. How may I help you?“

„Hi yes Valerie. Look I called a few days ago about my cat Telly? Telly McCain.“

„Ah yes I remember. How is she? Has she come out yet?“

„That’s what I’m calling about. She still hasn’t come out from under my bed. Not for food, water, treats or even to go to the toilet. I’ve tried getting her out myself but everytime she starts hissing at me and digs her claws into the floor. I’m really starting to worry.“ 

„That is a bit unusual. Have you tried putting her food under the bed? Maybe that would work and lure her out.“ 

„I’ve already tried that. Leaving a trail of treats, dry food, wet food, just leaving her plate under there. It doesn’t work and ends up going all rotten and horrible. She’s just refusing to eat.“ 

„That is a bit weird. Telly is an older cat yes?“

„Yeah she is, why? Do you think that’s the cause of this?“

„Well, maybe. I’m not really sure what to do in this type of situation. Just keep trying to get her from under the bed okay? Have you tried moving it?“

„Yes I’ve already tried moving it obviously. Everytime I do she sounds like she’s in pain so I end up having to put it back. God you people are useless“ …

„Hello? Ma’am are you still there?“ … „Okay then…“ 



August 29th;

„Hello, this is the veterinary front office-„

„Listen here you bastards something has happened to my cat in that fucking building and I want you to come out here and fix it. Now!“

„Ma’am? Please calm down, is this about Telly-„

„Of course it’s fucking about Telly! Ever since she came home from that god awful building she has refused to come out from underneath the bed and now won’t even let me in the room! It’s like she can feel whenever I come near it! So you better get your fucking asses over here and fix this or I swear I will phone the police and sue you cunts.“ 

„Ma’am please calm down there’s no need to phone the police. Look I’ve got your address here I’ll send one of our vets and myself over to you. We’ll be there in the next half hour.“

„You better fucking be.“ … 




So of course not wanting the police called, I asked for the vet who performed the operation, Dr Andrew Lloyd, and we went over to her house. As we pulled up to the house I could see her stood outside her front door, looking worried. And slightly pissed.

She lead us into her house and upstairs and pointed to a shut door.

„She’s in there,“ she said, sounding calmer than she was on the phone, „Please just, make sure she’s okay.“

I opened the door and immediately was hit with an awful smell. Andrew and I walked in and immediately heard Telly hissing from underneath the bed, all the way at the back.

Andrew went over to the bed and first tried just looking under it with a small torch. When that didn’t work he gestured over to me to help him lift and move the bed to try and get Telly, who was still hissing the entire time. 

We were able to successfully move the bed, but still we couldn’t see Telly. But, she was hissing, it was very clearly a cat hissing so it must of been Telly. Then we got a closer look at the floor.

Right up near the wall, there were two floorboards bending upwards slightly. How‘d she get under there? Andrew went over, making sure his footsteps were light to try and not scare her, and lifted the floorboards. 

And there was Telly, open mouthed and hissing at him. Maggots crawling in and out of her open stomach, eating away at her. She looked horrible and reeked of death. Her eyes were lifeless, head flopping to the side of her. It looked like her neck was snapped. Patches of her fur were missing, leaving sore looking red blotches of skin, covered in bite marks. Her paws and legs were at unnatural bent angles and her tail was flat on the ground.

It looked as if she was run over, and yet she was still hissing at us. Andrew picked her up and brought her over to us, and only then did she stop. Her owner when ballistic at us. 

„What did you do to her?!“ „A simple operation couldn’t have done this!“ „My poor, poor Telly…“ „She didn’t deserve this! I can’t believe you didn’t do anything sooner!“ „I tried phoning I did! Over and over and over yet you wouldn’t fucking help!“ 

The police were phoned, and now the company needs to stand trial, to try and prove that they had nothing to do with Telly’s tragic death. That was the day I quit. No two weeks notice, no filling out forms to say I no longer work there. I just got my stuff and left. 

It’s been a few days now since that happened. Telly’s owner won the case ane now every building belonging to the company is going under surveillance. Police checks and CCTV for any suspicious activity. They think this has been going on for a while now, pets are brought in for simple procedures, become unwell, then just suddenly die.

And looking through some documents of previous clients, people are starting to believe it. Even I’m starting to believe it. Thinking back to the few years I worked there, it was always a bit unusual. Other receptionists would just hang up or completely ignore certain numbers, I always assumed they were just prank callers or something. Doctors and nurses would act somewhat coldly towards the pets. And even though we always had pets come in and out, our food supply never changed. In fact, there was still food that dated back a few decadws, like the food was never offered or bought. Like they were just for display. 

I just hope that any pet that goes into one of those buildings are safe. Because even I didn’t know what was going on behind closed doors.
