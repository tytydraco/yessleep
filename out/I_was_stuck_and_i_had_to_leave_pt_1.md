I’m not much of a talkative myself, i’m that type of person that In parties just stays on the corner of the room, on his phone until the party is over, and besides to my wife Bianca and  my kids Gabriel and Lucas, I don’t really talk to anyone at all, and even that isn’t going very well right now.

Recently, i’ve been on some troubles with my wife because i’m kind of a gambler myself, and been spending too much of our money and barelly win anything at all, and she isn’t coping with it very well, almost ending my marriage because of it.
Then one day, it came what i expected, we had such a big argument on how i was spending too much on dumb stuff like funko pops or computer games (even though i think it’s a good investment) and kicked me out  the house. 

I thought to myself “Where the hell will i go at night time like this?”, and my only option was a cheap motel just outside of town but how in the fuck would i still get a room at 1AM of the morning in a motel in Girdwood Alaska especially on a raining night like this??
I suppose it’s better trying that than sleeping on a 1980s AMC Pacer.

So i left the house at the middle of the night fumming, leaving my wife and two kids behind, got in my car and headed towards the mottel.
 In the radio it was playing a big Metal station in the area which was playing the song “You Only Live Once” by Suicide Silence, when all of a sudden the music got interrupted by the host  of the station saying “Hello there folks, hope you are safe and sound on your houses, because it is for sure a lot of rain and storm outside, and we just got news that a snow storm is aproaching, so if you’re out there on the streets be safe” and he signed out resuming the song that was on.

And the storm surelly arrived fast, because 5 minutes later of driving you could barelly see anything, and if you know Girdwood you would know that it’s always with huge and dangerous storms and the terrain’s got much treacherous mountains and roads, that even on a storm like this one, it would be even more dangerous, but i still went for it and i now know why they say that. While i was crossing an old wood bridge in the area, the car soon fell into the water with me in it 

“Help Help!!” i said but nobody could hear me and i soon lost my senses.

When i woke up several days?? Or even Hours?? later i woke up in a hospital bed, not having the memory of how i got there, and that’s when i noticed a nurse was in the room taking care, and was shocked when i woke up 

“Hello sir can you hear me??” she asked still being shocked at my awakening
 
“Yes,  but where am i?” i asked her still on that point of waking up from a long sleep, and can’t really manage reality quite well yet. 

“That doesn’t matter now what matters is that your good”
But then that’s when i noticed, she had a massive gun wound on her left shoulder that was too big for her to be confortable with it, but that’s not even the worst part, she had a smile that was too big for her, almost looking like her mouth was stapled at the top of the corners making it look too frightening but actually had a welcoming tone, like a grandma’s smile when you arrive at her house to stay there for the weekend.

“What happened to you” i asked in pure curiosity.
“Oh you will soon figure it out” she said with a smirk, almost making that look like a joke.
Several minutes later, she came back to the hospital bed i was in, and told me i was all set to leave, but said i had someone that was there to take care of me, and it couldn’t be my wife because i was far from town for her to pick me up.
As i was leaving a man aproached me and said he would give me a tour around town, because of my rough shape i would have to stay there for a few days.

“Mathias Torino is it right?” he asked as he aproached me

“How do you know my name?” i asked since i hadn’t given my name to anyone since i arrived, because well i had just woken up like thirty minutes ago.

“We know everything around here and next, take better care of your wallet, since you have valuable information there” he replied.

“Fair” i thought, “and by the way what’s your name?” i asked the men with a patch on his eye that you regularly see on those pirate movies.

“Jonathan Tatcher” he replied, and by the way welcome to the beautiful town of  Portage, the town where all the people that come in don’t want to leave” he said  on a chant tone, like he had all that memorized on his mind, and was tired of it.

But the rest of the story i will have to tell another time, because i feel very tired and got to put the kids off to bed to go to work the next day, so until next time folks.
