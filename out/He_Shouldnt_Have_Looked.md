I shouldn't look, especially after what happened to Jacob. I don't know why I'm even considering it. Maybe it’s just morbid curiosity after having seen my close friend driven mad beyond description. Just one look, one little peek into an old burlap bag. That's all it took to unequivocally ruin Jacob’s life.

Me and Jacob are.. were essentially nature aficionados. Camping, hunting, fishing and basically any activity involving being outdoors away from society, taking in the fresh air and setting aside all of the worries of our day to day lives.

We'd always been curious about some of the macabre things people have allegedly encountered in the forests, the infamous staircases placed in the unlikeliest of locations. Or cryptids such as skinwalkers and wendigos. We'd never been fortunate to find any, or unfortunate depending on who you ask.

The last camping trip we went on started out as typical as any other, we always tried to traverse and explore different areas to set up camp. We were well equipped for just about anything, it just felt nice sometimes to escape the sounds of the city and the day to day pandemonium. 

We always took weather into account, but it never really hindered us from our trips or activities. I've always loved when it rains, even in a tent which barely separates you from the downpour. Seldomly had we come to close to any life threatening situation. That all changed on one foggy, overcast evening.

We were camped in a relatively dense part of the woods with a small clearing , on a hill that was higher than what we were accustomed to, and decided to do some hiking, as we were quite literally in unknown territory we made sure to leave markers so we could find our way back to camp.

We talked for what seemed like hours as we hiked through the underbrush, listening to the sounds of nature and taking in the scenery, stopping when necessary to hydrate and rest. As we walked we noticed rain clouds approaching from the direction we headed, though we decided to trudge on for a while longer.

After a while we noticed a few things that coalesced seemingly in sync. The trees seemed to thin out, but not only were they becoming more scarce, they also appeared more and more bereft of leaves, and eventually seemed dead altogether. On top of the change in the trees and eerie fog set in as the clouds approached.

Jacob and I looked at each other, a mixture of an unnerved, yet excited look on his face. Then we reached a clearing. It was almost perfectly circular. Hearing a crunch as I stepped forward I looked down to find I'd stepped on some kind of animal bone.

As my eyes followed the edge of the clearing I could see that these bones covered the entire area in a complete circle. The fog seemed to merely encircle the clearing rather than obstruct my vision. Which is when I saw a small dilapidated shack type structure in the middle of the circle, maybe 20 yards from the tree line.

The building had two windows that were boarded up, and was approximately the size of an old shed. On either side were two trees completely bare of leaves that only had what seemed to be the small bones of rodents hanging from the branches by thread. It was suddenly apparent that all other sounds of the forest had died, only the rolling thunder and the whistling of the wind could be heard.

I looked at Jacob, his eyes were locked onto the door of the shack as if he was staring at something miles away. “Maybe we should head back, those rain clouds look pretty nasty.” I said. He snapped his eyes toward me as if he forgot I was even there. Then I saw a slight grin. Jacob was always a bit more into creepy lore than I was. He simply nodded his head towards the shack. “C'mon” He said. “Let's at least check the shit out.” I sighed. “You don't even know if there is anyone in there. You wanna risk getting shot? Stabbed? Turned into Christmas ornaments?” I replied, motioning to the trees. He laughed. “Bro it's obvious ain't nobody been here for who knows how long.

Ultimately I conceded, knowing I couldn't talk him out of it. “That's the spirit soldier.” He said, patting me on the back. “Get my ass killed” I mumbled.

We walked slowly approaching the door, I had my hunting knife gripped just in case we encountered a crazed hermit. I don't know if it was intuition but I couldn't shake the feeling of dread that was only getting worse. We reached the shack and Jacob slowly turned the rusted knob. The door opened with a creek and we were immediately hit with a stench of something unfamiliar. The most God awful smell.

“Probably some dead vermin or some such.” Jacob said. I didn't respond, I just covered my nose and looked around. Jacob turned his flashlight on and surveyed the dark room. The room itself was basically empty aside from cobwebs and a few decomposing rat carcasses. Then the light shone on a latch on the floor that obviously must have led to an underground portion of the structure.

Even Jacob started to look a little hesitant. Despite my inner monologue I decided to take the initiative and lift the wooden hatch. That's when the smell hit us like a ton of bricks. I gagged and retched, nearly puking all over the floor. 

“We've come this far bro.” He said, almost in a questioning sort of tone. I looked down and noticed a set of steps that led to a dirt floor. Despite my gut and my instinct I turned on my flashlight and led the way down the rickety steps until my feet met the damp dirt.

This wasn't your normal basement, it was more like a long corridor that seemed to stretch down hill forever. On the ceiling, which was only maybe a foot above our heads were countless hanging bones that I couldn't recognize as any specific species.

“I really don't like this.” I said. “We should turn back.” I said, turning towards Jakob. He didn't answer me. He has his eyes and his light fixated on something ahead. 

I followed his gaze to find what looked like an old wooden chair. But it wasn't the chair that was the most peculiar, it was what was on it. Placed on the chair was an old burlap sack, it was clear to us that it definitely had something in it. And the sack was sitting on the lap of a human corpse, his head was slumped back onto the chair, slack jawed and eyeless.

The dead man in the chair looked to have been dead for many years, the skin was greyed and putrified.

Shining the light beyond it I could see dozens of symbols of a foreign nature covering the walls, seemingly smeared in blood. The closer we got to it, the more I felt an utter sense of despair. Like all of the light in the world has just become non-existent.

We were within two feet of the man with the bag as I turned to Jacob. He didn't return my gaze, he simply looked as if his entire life depended on these next few moments. I backed away. “Jacob? Look, maybe we should get going, it's gonna be dark soon, we need to report this, not to mention the rain-.” Before I could say another word he reached for the bag.

“Jake” I said shakily. Without even so much as a glance in my direction he slowly opened the bag. 

Time seemed to stand still for a moment. All of the color drained from his face. “Jacob… what do you see?” 

He started trembling. His face began to twist into the most terrified expression I have ever witnessed on a person. Then he began to scream, the most terrified scream I've ever heard. He dropped the bag and ran, still screaming as if engulfed in flames.

I ran as fast as I could to keep up with him as we finally reached the stairs. A step broke and he almost fell with it, but he crawled and climbed for dear life, making it to the hatch and bursting through it. 

I followed behind him as he ran through the underbrush and branches, his screams eventually turning to sobs as he lost his voice.

Not even bothering with our camping equipment he ran through the pouring rain slipping all the way until he found his way to the truck with me struggling to keep pace. After we started the truck he peeled out like a bat out of hell.

The whole way back to the city I expected him to calm down some to tell me what triggered him but every time I asked he just vigorously shook his head while still hyperventilating. 

I tried my best to convince him to go to the police with me about the things we'd seen, but he never spoke a word, other than the repeated utterance of “Please God, please God.” He just kept looking in the rearview as if hell was following him. All said I'd never seen a man so frightened, especially one who looks danger in the eye as he did.

After Jacob went home, I went straight to the police myself. Of course the story itself sounded peculiar to say the least, but being that the tent and camping gear was there in some condition, and the markers left to find our way back were still intact, I was able to lead them to the clearing in which the shack was.

The only problem was that the building… was not there at all, nor were the bones encircling it, not even the dead trees on either side of the structure. I was at a complete loss for words. We searched for a while longer but before the end of it I was lucky to have not been charged some kind of false report.

I tried for a few days to contact Jacob to no avail. I eventually contacted his family, only to find they hadn't talked to him either until I called his mom and got a strange bit of information when he showed up one day. He told her some things without so much as looking her in the eye.

Jacob started having some nightmares in which he was being stalked by something. Whatever this nightmare entity was looked like him in the face, only horrific in nature. Things only got worse.

He started seeing this… thing while he was awake. When he looked over his shoulder he would see his own guant face in a crowd, eyes lidless, lips gone, skin along the jaws gone, teeth like long, thick needles, always looking more and more angry as days went by. 

Starting with a grin, then a lipless frown. Then a complete look a malice and fury. Then he started seeing the same face in his own reflection.

After that he disappeared. Every trace of him was gone, nothing remained of him. It was as if he vanished into thin air. I couldn't get past the event that obviously set this whole fucked up situation in motion. 

I started to question myself. Had we inhaled something that made us hallucinate? Why was it just Jacob and not me? The common denominator was the bag. The bag… in the shack… down an underground corridor that is now seemingly non-existent?

I had to go back. So I did. I followed the markers to the spot meeting the clearing. Strangely enough it was again as foggy as it was the time Jacob and I first traversed this same path.

To my amazement, I reach the clearing, and what do I see but the bones encircling the clearing? A certain dilapidated shack with two peculiar dead trees on either side.

As Jacob said “We've came this far.” I needed answers, my best friend disappeared after going mad during what was supposed to be another awesome camping trip.

My gut feeling said to run as fast as possible in the opposite direction. But something was pulling me toward the shack. So I opened the door, staring down at that hatch for minutes before finally opening in and making my way down. 

I walked in a sort of daze, thinking about what may have been in the bag when Jacob opened it. My anxiety growing worse by the second, until I finally reached it. 

I shined my light first at the legs of the corpse in the chair. They were skin and bones. Moving the light up I saw the familiar bag that Jacob and I had found. I didn't want to illuminate the face of the corpse, but I knew I had to.

Finally finding the nerve I moved the light to the face of the body rested in the chair. Jacob… the long dead, decomposing corpse of my best friend. He clutched the bag as if protecting it.

So here I am now guys, as horrible as the events that transpired for my friend were… I know I shouldn't look. But there is something drawing me to it. I have to. I’ve just now pried the bag from Jacob's cold dead hands. I'm writing this because I'm about to open it. Wish me luck. I'll update soon.

Edit/Update: 3:15 pm Oct 1st. I looked... I looked and I've been sitting here for over a day trying to find the words to explain what I'd just experienced. My back rested against the cold stone wall of the dark corridor. I feel as though I'm encircled by an all encompassing darkness that has a face.

I feel so alone. Words don't exist for the kind of feeling that came over me the moment I opened the bag. Horror, despair, sadness, panic, doom, regret, hideous lingering illness. These words don't hold a candle to the feeling I've felt since I looked. I know there is a way out, if only I could stand and will my legs to move. But the one thing that consumes my thoughts is what I saw, and heard when I opened the bag.

It was a human head... My head. My face without any doubt. That was the only truly distinguishable fact. Unrecognizable was the lidless, white eyeballs, pale and decomposing skin, sunken to the bone, and the mouth... Needle like teeth with a lipless grin that stretched wider and wider as I stared for what could have been seconds or hours. Then without moving a single muscle it uttered these words, "Your face is mine, and you belong to me for as long as you are useful." 

Now after over a day I fear what comes next for me, I can feel something different about myself. It took every ounce of me to stand and trot my way toward the steps. Now that I'm back outside the wretched structure I can only do my best to trot slowly until I gained my composure enough to run as fast as I could to reach my car. I truly don't know what happens next. I figured this is one of the better places to post this in order to hopefully find someone who can help. I'm so terrified. Will post again if anything drastic changes. 

2nd update: 11:44 am, Oct 2nd. I'm lost. Not only figuratively or metaphorically, I am physically lost. The last thing I remember is getting into my car and high tailing it home. I recall having a drink or two when I got home, though not nearly enough to subsequently become blackout drunk and wander off. 

In fact I remember distinctly turning on the TV and resting on the couch with my dog. Did I fall asleep? My eyes are burning, and my eyelids are heavy. Nothing in my memory accounts for me to be where I am. But where was that? I was lucky enough to have had my phone.

 I was standing at the ledge that overlooks a lake. I surveyed my surroundings and soon began to recognize which lake it was. Which immediately brings me to my next revelation. This is where I was standing when my little brother drowned when I was a kid. I immediately fought back tears.

My car was nowhere to be found in the parking lot. To think I'd walked for what would be at least a 6 hour hike to the lake was terrifying. There is something wrong. I feel it it in my heart. 

My blood felt like acid. I'm really scared. I have to get home. I'll keep posting as often as necessary. I don't feel like I could tell anyone close to me without there being major consequences. For the love of whatever God you believe in, pray for me, please.

Update/Edit: 1:03 a.m. Oct 4th. 
I'm lost again, I don't know where I am. I'm standing at the entrance of an old abandoned church house. I was somehow lucid enough suddenly to survey my surroundings and take stock of myself and I noticed that I had a knife in my hand.

As soon as I saw the blood I almost immediately felt the sting of what seemed to be lacerations on my left hand. I ripped a part of my shirt with the intention of wrapping my hand when I noticed the marking on the door which was obviously carved by a knife.

It was a strange symbol, one of which I wasn't willing to observe long enough to describe. I ran until my muscles were on fire as well as my lungs. I was delirious, I don't know how much time I'd lost. My brain was foggy to a state of utter confusion. I'm sinking into a pit of darkness, so dark that it almost has a texture.

An unknown amount of time had passed before I slowed to a sluggish walk along a road I was altogether unfamiliar with when a car slowed to a stop and rolled down the window. "Bro, you good?". I don't know if it was because I was so exhausted and foggy, or if I was just happy to see someone, but I collapsed onto one knee and sobbed.

The man helped me into his car and offered to take me to a hospital. I replied "Please, no hospital can you please take me me home?" 

Again, when I told him where my home actually was it was disturbing to realize somehow I'd traveled at least a couple dozen miles on foot. Luckily the man was traveling in the same direction and agreed to at least drop me at the nearest bus station on his way.

The entire drive was a blur, neither of us said a word to each other. My own perception of time was distorted to say the least. Before I knew it I reached the nearest bus stop to my residence. As I got out I realized I never got to thank the man, let alone get a look at his face.

As I shut the door I turned towards him. "Listen man, I'm sorry for the trouble I really appreciate you." 

Then he slowly turned his head to look at me... It was my face... Rather it was the face I'd seen in the bag. I watched as the mouth stretched into the same terrifying grin. "No problem, I'm sure you'll get where you're going." He said, without moving another muscle, in a distorted inhuman voice. Then he drove away, leaving me even more distraught than I already was. 

I don't know how much more I can handle of this. I keep imagining the corpse of my friend sitting stiff in the chair at the end of that tunnel. Will that be me?

All I can do is keep updating whenever possible.
