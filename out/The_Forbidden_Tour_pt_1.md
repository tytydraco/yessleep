For as long as I can remember I've enjoyed everything extreme, skateboarding, Bmx trails even bungeed a few times in my teens. As I grew older I started thinking about the things I hadn't had chance to try yet that I'd missed, so I started on my bucket list. Everybody has a bucket list, filled with fantastic dishes yet to try, exciting experiences to sample and places to visit. But the run of the mill...the ordinary choices just didn't excite me, I had to go that step further, always have always will, the danger element is what excites me. If there is an element of danger then I'm hooked, sometimes I'll be in a situation where my ethics are questioned but that's what lifes about right? Pushing the envelope...right?


I've paraglided over the lost Amazonian tribes, narrowly avoiding fear thrown spears. Sailed the Bermuda triangle in a Catamaran. Climbed the worlds most dangerous peaks and traversed the harshest terrains, but it's my itch for the darker side of life that still goes unscratched. Ever since I was a teen I've been fascinated with anything that gets the heart pumping, this usually came in the form of watching extreme suicide videos and murders on sites I'd rather not mention here. So, as I grew older and i ticked off my usual bucket list entries I drew up a much darker list to tick off too.

I want to run with the flaming Bulls of Cueta, Spain, where the people not only run in the streets to escape the stampede but set the Bulls alight first.  I want to visit the Aokigahara Woods, also known as the Suicide Forest at the base of Mount Fuji, Japan to see if I can survive that feeling of emptiness and suicidal bottomless void so many poor souls reported to feel before ending their lives. Of course, my list wouldn't be complete without 'The Door to Hell' in Turkmenistan, a natural Hell hole that seems to burn forever, did you know hundreds of thousands of spiders gravitate to that site? Like a God damn Arachnid pilgrimage!


I'd struggle to decide which one of these places I would want to visit first in all honesty, they all hold such dark interest and rich history that they all stand out as must see places to me before I die. But, above everywhere else there is one place on this Earth I needed to visit before I perished, and that had to be Chernobyl. The tragedy that happened there back in April, 1986, will forever be known as a global catastrophe with horrendous side-effects that are still echoing out from ground zero today. I dont want to just see the ghost-like streets, abandoned stores and empty playgrounds from the safety of my own home. So I began to look for tours, trips or excursions, anything that could get me further into the real Chernobyl.


After going through the usual travel sites, and the lesser known cheap sites that offer questionable excursions I stumbled across a site that looked like it had been made in the late 90's and left in the land that time forgot. The layout was a mess, most of the text made no sense and nearly all of the links were long since dead. I almost missed the link at the very edge of the page for 'Life Changing Trips' and expected it to be another dead link, but after several quick clicks a list of dark and borderline illegal trips came to life.


I began to work my way down the list, with nothing really jumping out at me of any interest. I'm not into hunting Lions, I dont want to deep sea dive recent cruise ship sinkings and I've already spent a weekend in a real Mental Institute, as a guest not a patient.. Mid way down the page, when my interest for searching began to fade, a half blurred advert for Chernobyl caught my eye.

That last line I read two or three times before clicking accept but I gathered it was just ghoulish humour to match the dark style of the website.

And with that I'd booked, the trip was set for late October. I figured best to book a winter excursion as all the sites recommended the snow acts as a mild shield for the radiation and visibility is still good enough with the chance to see wild animal tracks in the snow. As soon as I booked the tickets I could feel in my bones this was going to be something else. The wait was excrutiating, and going alone meant I had noone at my level of enthusiasm, I prefer to travel alone but to have someone there beforehand would have been nice I guess.


Eventually, October came around, I collected up my essentials in my backpack and headed for the airport. I flew from Gatwick airport straight to Kyiv, landing at Ukraine international Airport. The tour guide had arranged for us to meet at a little rest stop location on the border of Kyiv, I guess to minimise attention to the tours they ran. Arriving at the location, I grabbed a bite to eat from the rundown looking cafe and sat at the riverside waiting for someone who looked like they were here for the same reasons as myself. I looked out at the semi frozen riverbanks, finishing my sandwich when I was briefly startled by an overly excited woman's voice with a distinct American accent.


"Heeey! Are you here for the tour?" I spun round to see where the question had come from to be met by a huge smile across a young woman's face. She, like me, had a backpack but due to her smaller stature it seemed to engulf her. I could tell she had read the same clothing guidelines like me sent through from the tour company, they expressed best clothing to make our day easier and I suspect to minimise any complaints directed towards them while on the tour. This is what they urged in the email ;


**"Walking boots with no fancy openings, expect to get your feet wet due to time of year, flooding and extreme temperatures. Full length thick trousers, no shorts/ Open worn jeans/Linen Trousers or Three Quarter Lengths. Warm jumper, No short sleeves or rolled up sleeves. Rainproof coat. Gloves and warm hat to combat the frost. If at anytime you begin to feel unwell, your Dosimeter begins to faulter or you get seperated from the group make your way back to the tour bus location stated on your maps given to you on arrival. DO NOT LOSE YOUR MAP."**


***"Further instructions upon arrival."***


I threw her a polite wave while heading towards her, "Hi, yeah I am.. looks as though we are the first ones here right?" I smiled back. I'd been waiting for almost an hour with no sign of anyone who didn't look.. local. " I think I saw two guys head over that way towards the bar bout 20 minutes ago" she gestured towards the near empty high street, mid way down the street a faded sign barely noticable stood crooked against a doorway. She introduced herself as Emma as we headed towards the bar.


The bar was everything you'd expect to find in a low-key, no questions asked, outskirts part of town. The lighting was low, except for a few dim bulbs and natural light coming in through the various holes in the walls that came from God knows where. A few tables were spread out across the bar, each with a weary drunk nursing whatever alcoholic drink they could afford. Our attentions were drawn to the two loud young men knocking back drinks and enjoying some joke between themselves and the barman. From the way they were dressed it was fair to assume these were the guys who were going to be joing us on our tour. The thought of spending the rest of the tour with these people left a sour taste in my mouth, concerned my long awaited trip was going to be ruined by loud easily excitable members of the group.


Emma approached them first, her presence was enough to simmer their antics as we introduced ourselves. Our new comrades Joel and Nikolai ordered us a quick round of drinks to toast our soon to be adventure before we headed back to the pick up point. As the four of us walked back along the empty high street I couldn't help but notice the strange way the locals looked at us, not so much in a wary way, or suspicious but more like....pity. You know the way a brother or sister looks at you as you get home and you instantly know your Mom and Dad are about to burst in yelling a thousand questions and accusations all of which you already know are true...that kind of look.


When we got back to the pick up point our guide was already there waiting. Sitting on the step of his rickety looking short bus he smoked a roll up between weathered fingers, barely looking up to acknowledge as we approached. He looked as though he had raided a military surplus store, with his camo trousers, military boots and thick fleeced jacket he introduced himself as Denys. "Hi!" exclaimed Emma stepping an extra step closer to our guide and the bus, "You're late" ignoring Emma "Everybody on the bus now" he ordered. A few sniggers escape Joel at Emma's expense as they boarded the bus. I was last in line, looking back at the locals now converging at the mouth of the high street staring at our group clambering onto the bus, I gave a small wave met with no response as I joined the others inside.


From Kiev to Chernobyl is a depressing two and half hour journey, through ghost towns and busy industrial sites. All the way Denys is barking Do's and Dont's at us...."Dont stray too far"..."Dont try to smuggle anything out"..."Do keep in visual distance of each other at all times"..."Dont question his orders" and "Dont die unless its necessary ", that last one I'm hoping was a joke but I'm not 100% convinced he knows what a joke is.


I spent a majority of the journey getting to know Emma a little better, the typical idle conversation you make with a stranger when forced together. She told me about her home town back in Winconsin, and to her delight I described back home in the UK. Meanwhile Joel and Nikolai continued to discreetly drink at the back of the bus while completely ignoring Denys and his rules. After what seemed like a full day's travel, the bus came to a stop. Looking through the windshield we had our first glimpse at Chernobyl, other than the obvious devastation which can be seen in almost any direction my main focus was the several other tours who were here setting up meeting points at the same time, an air of visible excitement amongst them.


I thought this was a tour like no other surely it would have less people?


***Dosimeter reading peak : 0.03***


Denys could see the look on my face, before having the chance to ask him, he answered my question. "This is not where *YOUR* tour starts, we go further, we show you *real* Chernobyl" he claimed with an almost patriotic look on his face. The engine roared back into life and we carried on into the exclusion zone, the other tours giving confused waves as we pass. The bus filled with the sound of everyone's Dosimeters ticking into life, the first hint of radiation echoed through the bus. A silence fell over the bus as we collectively began to realise the gravity behind the first warning tones sounding from the devices secured to our sides. All of a sudden this became *very* real.


The bus came to a halt a second time, without turning to look at us Denys pressed the door release and requested we gather our things and vacate the bus. After pointing out a few coordinates on the map for points of interest he told us he would be back in four or so hours to load up for a live hunt with anyone who had a strong enough stomache to tag along, mobile phones don't work here so we had to be on time.  I'd already figured the other three wouldn't be up for the hunt so if I were to get some time alone I'd have to go on the hunt. As a group we agreed to stay together for now and planned out where we wanted to go first.


***- Outskirts of Zalissya -***

***Dosimeter reading peak : 0.07***


The radiation warning pinging from our Dosimeters was already at a level high enough to sober up Joel and Nikolai, turning their faces a paler shade of grey with the realisation we were actually here in the exclusion zone. If I had a mirror I could bet I was a similar colour. Denys had told us before leaving to stick to the paths, don't disturb any rubble or dust and never enter any buildings marked with black and yellow tape. As we made our way down the first few desolate streets almost every house seemed to be covered in that black and yellow tape. Every curtain was drawn nearly completely shut allowing the bare minimum of light into the empty properties. Every door was closed, presumably locked. I swear I saw movement in an upstairs window of a rundown apartment block, the curtain swayed ever so slightly but by the time I'd gotten everyone's attention it had stopped.


I know i saw something..


I convinced myself that it was my mind playing tricks on me, heightened imagination from the situation we're in. It was harder to convince myself that that was the case for the bangs, swaying curtains and distant screams that followed. Every other house we passed, curtains flittered, distant bangs of debris being disturbed as if some distant giant had awoken and began to move from its slumber. The faint echoes of doors opening and closing kept us all on edge, expecting at any moment to see signs of life. When the faint sound of a distant scream bounced around the walls of the empty street we were in we began to move quicker towards our first checkpoint, the Town Square.


\- **The Town Square -**

***Dosimeter reading peak : 0.08***


We moved in silence quickly along the empty streets, huddled together watching every corner and nook only slowing down when we reached the centre of the square. The square itself was a wide open space with a dried up fountain at the centre, we headed straight for the fountain to rest up. I'm sure it would have looked beautiful before the nuclear blast. We had visibility from all sides just in case anything or anyone approached us, at the far side of the square the tables of an abandoned restuarant were scattered. The tables that remained upright still had plates and cups strewn across them, left behind in the chaos, remnants of a peaceful time. We sat and discussed in hushed voices what we thought we had all seen and heard, no-one wanting to speak for too long, risking disrupting our only defense...the silence. We agreed to keep our talking to a minimum instead opting for signalling each other with hand gestures.


As we were all reluctant to use the same street to get back we debated the best route out of town, a noise across the square startled us, each of us spinning our heads in the direction of the noise.


***Dosimeter reading peak : 1.06***

Across the square, the chairs and tables of the abandoned restuarant began to fly viscously in all directions, as if *something* was charging directly towards us. An unholy gutteral scream filled the air. We froze, for a moment, whatever was barrelling towards us we still couldn't see it which meant we had no idea how to defend ourselves against it. As it came to the last of the tables, almost out in the open and exposed, the screaming stopped. The silence somehow seemed louder. The last of the airborne tables hit the floor and the only noise filling the void was the clattering of the last few cups and plates coming to a stop while Emma openly sobbed, clinging to Joel behind Nikolai and me.


Out of nowhere Emma let out a stiffled squeal, I turned to see her struggling beneath Joel's grip who was now standing unnaturally rigid, he towered over her with both his arms wrapped around Emma firmly keeping her in place. His eyes were glazed over looking completely emotionless, no matter how she tried Emma couldn't escape his grip all the while Nikolai yelled at Joel to let her go. As Joel's arms fell to his side, and Emma fell to the floor, Nikolai and I rushed to help her up. Leaving Nikolai to comfort Emma I turned to confront Joel, I began to yell and curse, I could feel the adrenaline rushing through my veins, we needed answers and we needed them now!


His chest heaved forward towards me briefly as if pushed from behind, yet his feet remained planted in place. A patch began to grow across his chest, at first it looked like a shadow growing from within him but by the time it had stretched across his chest it was apparant the patch was infact blood and whatever had impaled Joel had entered from his back. He didn't drop to the floor.... instead he began to rise off his feet right in front of me, as if skewered and lifted by an invisible force. His blood began to pool beneath him as he rose higher and higher above the fountain. For a brief moment I thought he was going to keep on going, until he was so high we couldn't see him anymore and he was lost to us forever.


I wish that was the case.



In a swift motion, whatever force that decided to lift Joel high above the Town Square decided to let him go, with a sickening crunch his lifeless corpse lay across the statue atop the fountain. We stood in complete shock and fear, unable to get him down. It took far less time than I anticipated to convince Nikolai to leave his friends body behind and for us to move on out of there before whatever attacked us came back.  As we left the square a murder of Crows took residence on Joel's corpse, feasting on him through fevered caws and squawks.


I don't know what happened back there, and I don't know if we are even remotely safe let alone heading in the right direction...


All I know is my Dosimeter reading keeps getting steadily higher

And I'm pretty sure someone is following us...
