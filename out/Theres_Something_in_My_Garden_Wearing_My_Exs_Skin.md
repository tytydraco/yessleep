It started two weeks after El left.

The house was quiet. Too quiet, the kind where you can hear your own blood moving. The bed still smelled like her. Her pillow still had the shape of her head. I kept brushing my teeth and expecting her to call out from the bedroom, like she always did.
***“You left the light on again, babe.”***

But she was gone. Left in a rush. Said she needed time. That was the last text I got. I didn’t reply. Not because I didn’t want to—I just… didn’t know what to say.

The first night I saw it, I thought I was losing it. It was around 2 a.m. I’d gotten up to take a piss, wandered into the kitchen for water, and looked out the back window. Something—someone—was standing at the edge of the garden. By the hedge.

Still. No phone. No cigarette. Just… standing.

I blinked and it was gone.

Didn’t sleep much after that.

••

Night two, same time. I saw her again.

Her. That’s what made my stomach twist. She looked like El. Or enough like her in the dark. That hoodie she always wore. Legs slightly bowed in that same way. Hair up in a messy bun.

But it wasn’t her.

She didn’t move. Not even to shift her weight. Just stood there under the motion light, hands dangling at her sides like they didn’t belong to her.

I didn’t go outside. Just turned off the tap and sat on the kitchen floor until sunrise.

••

By night three, I stopped pretending it wasn’t happening. I made coffee at 11 p.m. and sat in the living room, lights off, watching the garden through the curtains. I was tired but sharp—waiting. The air felt… thick. Heavy.

Then she was there.

Under the light again.

I pressed my forehead to the cold glass. Took her in properly.

It looked like El, yeah. From a distance. But her body was wrong. Her shoulders sat too high. Her arms hung stiff, not relaxed. Her hands opened and closed like she was rehearsing the motion. The hoodie looked too tight in some places, too loose in others—like she was trying to wear something meant for someone else.

And she wasn’t breathing. At all.

I dropped my coffee mug. The sound made her tilt her head—not fast, not startled. Just slow and off-kilter, like a puppet responding to the wrong cue.

Then she turned and walked away.

That walk—Jesus.

She didn’t bend her knees right. Her steps were short, dragging. Her arms didn’t swing. It was like she’d watched videos of people walking and was doing her best to copy it, but hadn’t quite figured out how the joints were supposed to work.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Didn’t eat the next day.

••

By night five, I’d set up a motion camera and floodlight out back. Something to prove to myself I wasn’t just losing my mind. I watched the camera feed live on my laptop.

3:17 a.m.—***ping.***

She was right there. Inches from the lens.

The floodlight blew out her features, but I could see her eyes—too round, too wide. And her mouth. Slightly open. Like she was in mid-sentence but didn’t know the words.

I rewound the footage and watched her walk up to the camera frame by frame. Her movements were stiff, mechanical. At one point, she lifted her arm and bent it the wrong way. Her elbow popped out sideways, like she forgot which direction it was supposed to go.

I almost called the police. Almost.

But what would I say? **“My ex is in my garden and her elbow bends backward now?”**

••

Night six, I cracked. I went to the window and shouted. **“What do you want?!”**

She didn’t answer. Didn’t flinch. Just stared.

The next night, she spoke.

I was upstairs, brushing my teeth. I glanced out the bathroom window and froze.

She was in the driveway this time. Closer.

She opened her mouth too slow. Like unzipping something wet. Her lips stretched far—too far—and the sound came out after the motion. Like it wasn’t connected to her body.

***“Jaaaaay…meeee.”***

Flat. No tone. Just the sound of my name dropped into the air like a piece of meat.

Her tongue moved like it was being pulled by string. Her jaw hung open too long, then snapped shut with a little click.

And her voice—

It was close to El’s. But too tight. Too deep in her chest. Like it was being squeezed through someone else’s throat. Like she’d only recently figured out how to make noise at all.

Then she smiled. Too wide. Like she was proud.

Then came the words.

***“I… miss… our… pasta nights.”***

I dropped my toothbrush.

El used to say that. After bad days. It was her code for let’s cook something stupid and fall asleep to horror movies on the couch.

But this wasn’t her. This thing was parroting something it had no right to know.

It was like it had access to something it shouldn’t. Her words. Her tone. But only the surface—like an actor who’d memorised the lines without knowing what they meant.

I duct-taped the windows after that.

But it didn’t stop.

I heard her walking on the patio. Her footsteps were slow, uneven. Sometimes she’d stop mid-step. Then shuffle again, like she was still figuring it out.

She knocked once.

Just once.

Always around the same time—3:10, 3:20 a.m.

Never tried the door. Never broke a window. Never forced anything.

It was like she was waiting.

For me to let her in.

••

By night ten, I stopped looking. Stopped eating. I kept the lights on and sat with my back against the kitchen cupboards, knife in my hand, whole body buzzing.

She didn’t come that night.

Which was worse.

Because on night eleven, I woke up to breathing.

Not mine.

It was coming from the other side of my bedroom door.

Slow. Wet. Just close enough for the sound to slip under the frame.

I sat up in bed. Held my breath.

The doorknob shifted. Clicked.

I didn’t move.

Didn’t make a sound.

The breathing stopped.

Then a voice: **“Jamie. I came in.”***

It was her voice. Flat. Slow. Like she was figuring it out as she went.

But the door never opened.

Eventually I found the courage to flip the bedside light. Nothing. No shadow under the door. No footsteps retreating.

I crept to the hallway, knees shaking. The front door downstairs was wide open. The hallway rug had a streak of mud across it. No prints. Just mud. Dragged in like something was pulled.

I stayed awake until dawn. Every creak in the house made my spine lock up.

••

When morning came, I walked outside, half-expecting to find her standing there. I didn’t.

But my hoodie—El’s hoodie—was lying in the grass.

It was inside out.

And wet.

I don’t know how long I’ve been awake now. Three days? Four?

She hasn’t come back. Not yet. But I know she will. She’s watching. Waiting. Just outside the places I let myself look.

I can hear her walking sometimes.

Practicing.
