The motel room smelled like mildew—sour and heavy, like wet drywall left too long under a tarp. I hadn’t planned on stopping here. I was low on gas, and the map showed nothing for miles. Every station I passed was closed or wrapped in plastic bags. I thought I saw one lit up on a hill, but by the time I circled back, it was gone. Or maybe it was never there.

That’s how I found Lake Kowatcha—by accident, or maybe not.

The Riverview Motor Lodge was the only thing lit up. The paint used to be baby blue. Now it’s just chipped sorrow. The neon VACANCY sign buzzed like a dying fly trapped inside glass. It looked like the kind of place you’d get stuck in during a snowstorm, and no one would remember your name when you checked out.

When I walked in, the man behind the counter didn’t ask for a name. He handed me a brass key with a tag that looked water-damaged and said, “Settle up when you leave.” Then, before I walked off, he said something else. Something that stuck with me. He said, “Don’t let your dog stare too long. They don’t like it.”

The sky had that low, weird weight to it. Like a lid half-closed on the world.

Room 6 felt colder after I shut the door—like it had been waiting empty too long. The bed groaned when I sat on it, metal springs loud against the quiet. The quilt was itchy. The carpet smelled like an old basement. The bathroom tiles were pink and green—same as my grandma’s, years ago.

There was a creek behind the motel. I cracked the window open to hear it. The air coming in smelled like damp leaves and something else—faint, like rust. There was also a scent I couldn’t place. Sweet but stale, like flowers that had been left too long in water.

That’s when I noticed the hum. It wasn’t the fridge. It wasn’t the lights. It was deeper. Like it came from the ground. Or under it.

I hadn’t planned on staying long. But when I checked my phone, I had no signal. Just that little “X.” No bars. Nothing.

The modem in the room was already blinking red. One of those old ones, smoke-stained and yellowed. I don’t even know why I tried, but I plugged in my laptop. The light blinked steady for a while. Then it skipped. Just once. It did that before the lights flickered, too. I told myself I imagined it.

I walked into town the next morning. The place wasn’t dead, but it felt… paused. Like someone pressed freeze-frame a couple decades ago. There were a few shops still open, but most looked seasonal, or forgotten. Paint peeling. Windows cloudy.

I passed a place that sold bait, yarn, and old t-shirts that probably hadn’t sold since the ‘80s. One shirt in the window read:

“The Clouds Are Closer Here.”

The lake was still frozen at the edges. The docks sagged. Some looked like they’d collapse if you touched them. Everything smelled like thawing lakewater and old wood trying to remember being useful. I didn’t see a single boat.

I stopped at the diner—Lakefront Diner & Fuel. It’s connected to the truck stop. The booths inside were split vinyl. The air smelled like burnt coffee and fryer oil. The waitress, Deb, poured me a cup before I even sat down.

“You’re in six, right?” she asked. I nodded.

Then she said, “Don’t let your dog stare too long.”

Same exact words. Same cadence.

I asked her who they were. She just stirred her coffee and said, “I don’t know. But they notice the dogs first.”

She said it like she’d said it before. Maybe too many times.

While she was talking about how nobody ice fishes anymore, a truck rolled through the lot. Pale blue cab. No logos. Looked new, but too clean. Same exact color as the motel. It didn’t stop. Just eased through, turned near the old radio tower, and vanished down a side road.

That tower still blinks red. Even though it’s rusted through and bent like it’s about to fall. If you stand near it, you can hear it hum louder. Deeper. I could feel it in my jaw. It reminded me of those stories old guys tell about the tornado sirens that used to malfunction during storms—long, low tones that didn’t mean anything but still made you want to run.

When I got back, the door to Room 6 was shut but unlocked. I didn’t remember leaving it that way. Tully hadn’t moved. He just stared toward the bathroom like he was waiting for something. Or someone. I called his name—nothing. He didn’t blink.

There was a faint smudge on the mirror that hadn’t been there before. Like someone touched it with the side of their hand. I wiped it. It came back ten minutes later.

The blinking red light on the modem hadn’t stopped—not once since I got there. But now I’m watching it closer.

Because I think it’s watching me back.

I wasn’t supposed to stay. I don’t even remember unpacking. I keep telling myself I’ll leave tomorrow.

But the sky’s still heavy.

And Tully still hasn’t looked away.

I told myself it was just for the night.
