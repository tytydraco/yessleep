I used to work HR within Hanna-Barbera in 80s. Some of the work I was involved in was supervising the Smurfs TV show's staff. In HR you often have to hear some uncomfortable stories, but this one takes the cake. I can recall one disturbing incident that wasn't reported in the news due to an internal PR coverup. It's not really the company's fault, but it would have caused a media feeding frenzy. Back then I didn't want to lose my job so I kept it zipped, it's not like I could have helped anyone by talking. I've been retired for a long while so fuck it.

Around the production of an episode called "Smurfette Finds Love", a senior animator had presented significant negative feedback over the script, and even filed HR complaints over being forced to storyboard it. He once lashed out within the writer's room claiming the episode would ruin Smurfette's character, saying strange things like "She doesn't need anyone else!". While we were gossipping about his strange behaviour with other co-workers, we weren't sure if he just had deep appreciation for the character or a genuine obsession. We ended up on the former, he was a senior animator after all. He was a really talented artist and widely known to be a nice guy to his co-workers.

But in the following weeks he ended up within the HR room additional times for increasingly erratic behaviour. His hygiene started getting worse and his hair was unkempt. He looked more and more insomniac while his personality started getting more hostile. You could tell something really troubled the guy. After repeated incidents I was forced to give him a talk and hand him a warning slip. Soon after a large amount of production files, animation screens and reels were stolen. It wasn't hard to pin down the blame as around the same time the employee had suddenly stopped showing up to work without explanation.

Due to lack of responses to the company's messages, a group of co-workers were sent to check in on the man, including myself. After knocking on the apartment door a lethargic man with unkempt hygiene, depression curled up hair locks answered the door, unlocking it and quietly inviting us in.

When we entered the apartment a foul stench washed over us. I held urge to gag as to not offend him. The hoarder house was filled with trash and a massive collection of Smurfs merchandise, particularly of Smurfette. Everywhere you looked you would see images and objects of the character, almost staring back at you. Piles of stained Smurfette dolls littered the floor. The animator pointed down to a closet containing a box of stolen reels, aftererwards sitting down on a sofa and crying while a co-worker tried to comfort him.

The stolen reels and frames were recovered, however most of them had been completely ruined by angry pencil markings, many even ripped to shreds. However there was something even stranger about the unfinished reels. When the reel was played back, in every single screen Smurfette was shown in, a strange messy brown flickering was shown on her skin. Meticulously, every single frame featuring her had been defiled with strange brownish substance.

Accused of petty theft the man was placed on leave from work for further investigation, and a mental health check was initiated on him. He voluntarily checked into an institution claiming his career was already over.

The investigation over stolen reels revealed a shocking fact. Samples of the brown flickering stains meticulously rubbed and spread across the screens of Smurfette were found to be made up of rotten human biological material. The DNA was not matched to the animator.

The social services cleanup crew sent to take care of his apartment while he was institutionalized discovered something disturbing below the piles and piles of garbage and Smurfette merchandise. A crudely crafted life-sized "love doll" dressed up to represent Smurfette. I hear it was emitting an extremely foul odor which even the garbage cleanup crew found suspicious. On further investigation it was found to contain real blonde hair and human remains.
