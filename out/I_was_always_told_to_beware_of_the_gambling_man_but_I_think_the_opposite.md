My parents always told me the same story at night about the gambling man. They say if I ever saw a man on a riverboat or any other place where gambling was prevalent wearing a green suit with a black overcoat and a black bowler hat with a green ribbon around it to run. 

At first I got bored of the stories as I just wanted to sleep. But a trip to my friends house brought an interest in this mythological figure from London in the 1880’s. My friend Daniel and his mother had invited me for a sleep over. His mother was a widow and she told us the story of how she had lost her husband. Mr smith 

She reclaims her memories from 7 years ago when she and her husband went on a riverboat to celebrate a friends birthday part when they saw the gambling man sitting at a poker table. When her husband decided to play for fun. Unfortunately her husband lost but this is where it gets interesting. Suddenly the man stopped Mrs smiths husband and said just a few words that to this day gives my friend Daniels mother ptsd. 

The man said in a distorted and almost fake mechanical voice. 

“The wonders of you Matthew Smith”

With no warning Mr Smith had been covered in barbed wire and was throw against a post when horrifically his head split open leaving his brains to fall out. 

Daniel’s mother has collapsed talking about it so we put her to bed and went to sleep ourselves. As we were sixteen and stupid Daniels and I decided to try find this “gambling man.” 

So we leave his house early the next morning and decide to head to the Thames to get on a riverboat. We manage to sneak on and decide to go get a drink at the bar and ask a few questions. One thing we found out was that if you lose to the gambling man you die according to the life you have lived from what we heard from Daniel’s mum we understood his dad was probably a horrible person further backed by Daniels childhood memories of the man remembering him being abusive.

However if you won against the gambling man it was said that the rewards would be so great you would’ve been the luckiest person in the world. Suddenly a tall figure in a green suit with a black overcoat and a black however hat with a green ribbon asked Daniel and I if we wanted to play a round of poker. Reluctantly we agreed. 

One man on the table was drunk saying provocative things to the gambling man and to me about why I looked so feminine. Even though I am a woman I still felt insulted. However after the first round he bet all in and so did the gambling man. Unfortunately the man had lost to which the man stopped him from leaving and said. 

“The wonders of you Trevor Lanyon” 

Suddenly the man exploded in half and while still alive and screaming was being eaten alive by a pig. He looks at us and asks do we want to keep playing. Daniel and everyone else ran off to hide outside and away from the bar I agree to play on.

I stress more than ever, sweat drips down my head as if I got out of the ocean. I was shaking as if I was in the Arctic Ocean. Suddenly a distorted voice asks.

“Are you ok Madame?” 

“Yes sir” I replied to the gambling man

He bets all in and so do I without thinking we present our cards and god must’ve been on my side because I won. The gambling man clapped and said. 

“The wonders of you Jessie Gabriel”

All of a sudden a large amount of cash appeared on the table totalling over a million pounds to which Daniel walks in stunned. The gambling man the looked at everyone standing outside the bar and said.

“The wonders of you all”
And suddenly they drop like fleas 

Once we returned we ran to my house and explained the story to my parents. However to our horror we read the newspaper 157 left dead on river boat police say it was the gambling man and his accomplices Daniel Smith and Jessie Gabriel. 

“Do not approach the individual’s.”
