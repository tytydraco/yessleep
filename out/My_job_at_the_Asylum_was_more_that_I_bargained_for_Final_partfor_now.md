It’s so dark….my head feels like it’s been split open. I am in a dark room surrounded by nothing but glass and a large TV on one of the room’s walls. My restraints came off….but how? They were sealed shut.   
  
I dug in too deep. I had a breakdown and I marched into one of the doctor’s offices to ask what’s been going on. To my disadvantage there was an executive there in the office, I think his name was Jeremy Davis or something along those lines. It feels like a lifetime ago….but it can’t have been more than 10 minutes since I’ve been hooked to this….machine.   
  
From what I remember, after making a scene, I was made to inhale a gas while being restrained by a security team….I don’t know what is going to happen. I am trying my best to inhale, exhale and keep my composure but…..my eyes have adjusted to the darkness and….oh my god…..oh dear lord…..I can see through the glass….my old colleague. Her corpse is rotting, the room looks flooded with blood. I can see her skeleton reaching out from her corpse like a human might throw themselves out of a burning building. I am sobbing and crying by this point. What is this place?   
  
Before I could think more about it the lights flicker back on. 4 doctors come inside the room through an automatic door that you couldn’t see if it didn’t reveal itself now. I wanted to run away but….I couldn’t. It’s like my body does not listen to me.   
  
Two of the doctors hoisted me up. It was weird. They were wearing hazmat suits. I have never seen any doctors be geared up like this. One doctor finally spoke up after I was tightly fitted back in my restraints.   
  
‘Ms Cole, we thank you very kindly for joining Dr Schabbs’ project. A live subject! You are truly remarkable for your selflessness. I admire your devotion to WoodFowler.’ Said the doctor in a very sincere and enthusiastic tone.   
  
I was confused. I was NOT put here with my consent. What is this place? Why can’t I bring myself to talk? What is going on here?  
  
The Doctor had frowned upon my lack of speech. He turned to another doctor who by this time had come into my view as well. I was curious what the other two doctors were doing but they restrained my neck as well so turning my head around was not an option unfortunately.   
  
Dr1: ‘The first sequence was in the normal dosages?’  
  
Dr2: ‘Absolutely. Everything was done in the same way it had been over and over again.’  
  
Dr1: ‘The results are not what they should be. Her brain has the activity it should have from the 3rd sequence onwards. I advise we stop this subject’s development right now.’  
  
Dr2: ‘After all we did to keep our family from chasing us with threats of lawsuit, you want to quit now? We only get funding if we carry on with the research.’  
  
Dr1: ‘Fine. Administer her, double the dosage and start the Wunder engine.’  
  
The doctors quickly shuffled away as the large screen finally opened. I began to get more sleepy and to lose my consciousness. I can’t believe my coworker is dead, I cannot believe I am in this place.   
  
Someone Save me.  
  
I look at the screen and see films depicting human sacrifice, animals being skinned alive, hard core corporal punishment inflicted on poor souls, footage of inhumane and brutal killings in wars. It was scarring and completely soul crushing. Accompanied by these images were not the usual sounds. No. It was a constant static sound that would go on. And on. And on. And on. Until my eyelids started to feel like they were too heavy to keep my eyes open. I closed them and fell asleep in a deep trance.   
  
Today….or perhaps it took longer? I have heard a doctor say that the 2nd sequence lasts 4 months. Maybe it explains why I feel so weakened and dizzy. My vision is blurred by those nightmares. My eyes open to see the world but over everything I see, there are the nightmares unfolding right before my very eyes. These nightmares happen simultaneously with the real world…or is it real? What is reality?   
  
Erm….I was given a laptop. By doctor to document my symptoms after the 2nd sequence. Apparently the 3rd is the point of no return. I probably will not be back with an update but I am using my last moment of free will to update you all one last time. Thank you to whomever listened. I will be joining all the other failed subjects in my slumber. I have reached the other level of the asylum. Pity I have to pay with my life for this.   
  
I will send this to a friend as well who is a freelance journalist. They must expose what is going on here. It is too late for me to do something about this, I have only gone so far as to see what is going on. Goodbye. Thank you for reading. 

It has been nice to know I was not alone in this journey.
