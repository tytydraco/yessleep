It all started when my friend and I decided to go to an antique shop. Sure, I was working on a project that would need furniture, so why not?

She calls an uber, and someone pulls up almost immediately, which was already odd. They had a wide smile and gestured for us to get in.

They were playing some music, garbled nonsense and static that would occasionally for a few minutes, switch to some song I loved out of nowhere. My friend and I never heard the same song.

They asked us if we wanted to go to a restaurant in town. I had tried all of them, which one?

“It’s a Diner.” They said- first red flag. Refused to elaborate on the name or place. Took a bit of arguing for them to agree to not go.

We finally arrived, the garbled nonsense music stopped, and I swear they dropped their smile and looked around like they had no idea where they were. There was no option to pay. Second red flag.

We enter the antique store. There’s tons of things in there, ranging from strangely glowing old lamps to a dusty, expensive looking set of silverware. Something stood out, a lot less antique than the rest.

A VCR + TV with a VHS tape next to it, labeled "Informational Guide Video" in what looked like rushed pen. Third red flag.

I pick it up without thinking and start looking at it. It's mostly normal, ignoring the slight black stains of thick liquid on it. So I check it out, with the VCR and TV.

$5.00. Not what the prices should've added up to, but the cashier, looking hazily into the distance and with a wide smile like the uber driver, handed it to me anyway, neglecting to ask for my pay. They ignored me when I insisted I paid them, like they couldn't hear me. Fourth red flag.

I head home, grumbling while my friend, who had apparently bought some silverware (and was griping about how expensive it was) left with me, and we picked up a taxi. Thankfully normal driver.


We arrive home in our shared house (or at least, MY house they like to share) and I start setting things up. Huh, there's a bunch of things I didn't have before that perfectly let it work. So I play the VHS tape.

A bunch of the same garbled nonsense, cut in with some warping of random audio I hazily remember from my childhood, and text flashes. "Smile like you mean it!" With a bunch of faces cycling by with that same smile. The same one the Uber driver had, the same one the cashier had. Ok, creepy. The tape ejects itself. Things went normally for the next few weeks.

Until there's tapping on the windows. I ignore it, more forceful. Eventually it leaves.
Dripping black liquid from the vents. I clean it up and move on. 
Weird cards in my mailbox with nonexistent adressess on them. 
Shuffling when I sleep, claws (that of a dogs when you let it grow out) scraping against my wooden floors in the middle of the night.
Whispers of anger from voices I barely remember.
Lavish food and drinks appearing. I throw them out, and the knocking on the windows starts up again.
it was all so much, and I made a giant mistake when I screamed at the knocking - "FUCK OFF!"

It paused, almost offended, before I could hear an animal scampering off through the grass. A letter appeared, that (albeit with better handwriting) sounded like one a child angry for being scolded sends to their mother, though the child knows curse words and has zero manners.

I would hear the meows of my dead childhood cats, and the barks of my beloved passed dogs. Whispers of "let me in" from cousins that left my life for various reasons. I had to ignore them, I needed to.

That tape moved every day, from the living room, to the kitchen, then on my bed. 
There were letters that kept being delivered, starting with telling me hateful things, that I shouldn't keep ignoring 'it', then lovebombing me and saying apologies, and after that it was scramblings of sloppy imitations of my family members trying to get me to answer the whispers or eat the food they left out. I assumed it was running out of ideas, and maybe it would leave. But that's when it got worse.

My cooking utensils would be organized in a way I didn't like, people I had sleep would would complain of nightmares constantly, and I'd have organs or appendages dropped in various places around my house. 

It got to the point I constantly slept over at my friends.
When I finally came back to my house .. It was meticulously organized, everything cleaned to an absurd amount, objects I don't remember having (like potted plants on shelves that housed trinkets I never put anywhere, an actual desk instead of the cardboard boxes I used to put my computer on, new books and movies, a fully fledged piano wedged in a corner I never used), scratches on my closets walls counting days in tallies (from the night after I abandoned the place), like something had gone mad without me, having nothing to do and no one to terrorize. 

Then there was it. A scrambling when I opened the door, the sounds of something like a dog running to greet its owner. Except it was a pitch black, tiger-sized cat with a wide, sharp-toothed smile and blank white eyes that had a hand at the end of it's tail. it started speaking in a language I didn't understand, but I could grasp that it was talking about how much it missed me. I just walked to my couch and put on TV. It watched with me before it eventually got bored, slunk to my closet, and disappeared entirely.

It's been a few weeks and I've been hearing excited tapping on the window, and getting texts from unknown numbers asking to play hide and seek and responding with various emoticons when I don't reply. There'll be a creature at the foot of my bed one night, and when I fall back asleep it'll be gone in the morning.

I have no idea what to do. Police won't believe me, and the only one who thinks I'm still sane is my close friend (who recalls having been bothered by it too for a bit, but it eventually moved on.)
