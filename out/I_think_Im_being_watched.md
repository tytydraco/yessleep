This happened about a week ago.. me F 17, I’ve been staying off and on with my boyfriend for about 6 months now. It’s a situation where we will stay with my family for a few days then go and stay with his. A few days before this incident I was about to go get some food with my boyfriend. He left the apartment to go start and pull up the car. Usually when he does this he will call me and I can just come get in, but when I went down the stairs I got startled. There was a girl standing under the stairs in the rocks.





 It scared me because she said hello to me and I didn’t see her. It was odd though, she was a young girl with long black hair but the weird part was I had smelt something she was burning. I didn’t get a good look because her back was turned to me but oddly enough I did see any smoke or a cigarette in her hand. Because I had just assumed it was a cigarette smell. I didn’t think too much about it and I decided it was nothing so I didn’t tell my boyfriend even though I had a weird feeling about it. Fast forward to a week ago, I needed something from down in the car. It was about 10 at night, as soon as I stepped outside I had a sinking feeling in my gut.






 Almost like a feeling of alertness. I started down the stairs to the car. First I looked on the other side of the parking lot where the car wasn’t. Then to realize and see the car was on the other side. So as I’m walking over across the parking lot I just so happen to turn and look towards the apartments and at the end of the hall I see a door cracked open with I light beaming out. As I continue to look I can almost make out a person standing in the crack of the door just peering out in my direction. This alone freaked me out but I just looked away and continued to the car. I thought to myself maybe they were just looking out for a second to see if someone was there. So I was looking in the car for the item and after 3 minutes of looking I came to the conclusion that it wasn’t in there. So I started the car because it was a cold night and my boyfriend was just about to go back to work in a minute. By the time I was done In the car about 5 minutes has passed. Thinking the person would be gone by then to my surprise they weren’t. As I was slowly approaching the apartments as the stairs were right by that door that was cracked, as I slowly got closer I could see that they were looking directly at me though the crack in the door. And as I got closer I saw who was watching me.. it was the same girl from under the stairs. I know it was her… I ran up the stairs and immediately told my boyfriend what happened, he thought it was weird but nothing I should worry about. He then told me he would take care of it and tell her off.






 But as soon as he went down to the car not even a minute later she was gone and the door was closed. I honestly don’t know what to make of this. I haven’t seen her since this but I can’t stop thinking about and I still have so many questions. And I can’t understand why she would be doing that. The whole situation just makes me feel weird. What do you think, was I over reacting?
