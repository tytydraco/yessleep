I don’t expect to be believed.

  
I was barely nineteen, dabbling with the idea of selling my socks on the darkest corners of the internet or perhaps slogging through the night shift at Tesco for another few years. Triple digits in my bank account were whittling down to single, and it was all starting to look a bit bleak. That was until I saw a posting on a freelance website that stuck out like a beacon among the others.  


  
**Babysitter wanted. Unique conditions. NDA required.**  


  
The red flags in the title alone were enough to scare off someone with at least a few brain cells to rub together, but not me. Skittish, desperate me who’d watched my landlord hike rent up for a third time and just *knew* he was poised to hit me again. I was convinced it was a kink for him at this point, scrolling through my pleading texts and shrugging a dismissive *no*. He knew there were no other places to rent nearby, knew I was desperate. So when I dared click the ad to read, I steeled myself to be the most open-minded I’d ever been.  


  
**-** **Girl aged 9 needs looking after.**  
**- Very particular set of rules to follow.**  
**- Unsociable hours working from 10pm-7am.**  
**- Must sign non-disclosure agreement.**  
**- Must read rules. Not liable for damages if rules are ignored.**  
**- Two weeks only.**  


  
But the money. Oh, *the money*. I’d never had a job working with kids before, but I didn’t need experience to know that *five thousand pounds* for a fortnight was obscene. Unreal. Probably a scam. And so the twentieth red flag was ignored as I dusted off my CV, sending it over in a money-drunk frenzy without time for contemplation or any semblance of intelligence.  


  
And I was hired.  


  
Never mind that I had no experience with kids, no children of my own or a single qualification to my name. I look back now and wonder, was I the youngest applicant? Did they do a background search on me, hunched over the computer scrolling through my social media? Was it because they knew I had a small family, and fewer people to miss me? I don’t know. But I was giddy, grateful, turning up that first day with a *save me* text ready to go to my friends if needed. Five thousand pounds was a risk worth getting murdered over, apparently.  


  
But the atmosphere of that house was something out of the pits of hell. Christ, it was enough to turn a non-believer biblical in the way a thousand eyes seemed to turn on you the second you dared enter. I walked through the door and ice attacked me from every angle, a tepid stillness so quiet it threatened to burst my head open. The building was normal of course, a middling detached 3-bedroom on a nice street, but inside only gave way to such a stomach-churning feeling that made it feel like I’d stepped into another world entirely.  


  
“The rules,” was the first thing the woman said to me, shaky hands shoving a crumpled piece of paper my way. The ad listed her as only a few years older than me, but the stress lines on her face aged her, bedraggled hair dancing around tired eyes. I could only nod curtly, swallowing as I cast my eyes downward. Not before a bony, malnourished hand grabbed me and the woman -Meena- shook her head in a silent no.  


  
“Read them later,” she told me firmly, “I just- before I go, I need to know that you understand.”  


  
I tried not to look past her into the empty coldness of upstairs. “Of course, whatever you need.”  


  
She sighed, releasing her grip and eyeing me warily. “Two weeks. We only ever have people for two weeks. Fourteen days of *following those rules*. Don’t ignore them. Don’t deviate. Not on a *single rule*.”  


  
I nodded, trying to appear eager. “No problem, consider them followed. Does she have any dietary-”  


  
“No.” Her eyes were stern, focused. “No, you’re deviating. Everything you need is on that piece of paper. No matter what you think of it, it’s *imperative* that you follow it. No matter what she says, no matter what you think or what your morals tell you - this is different. Follow the paper and you’ll get your money. Okay?”  


  
The question hung in the air as I suppressed a shiver, nodding. “Yep. Got it.”  


  
And so she left. Grabbed her coat and bolted, as though the last place on earth Meenawanted to be was inside these walls. She was the girl’s sister, and from what I could gather, had been looking after Maya since their parents’ death. It was tragic, and likely the reason the woman’s entire demeanour was tinged with grief and a heavy, heavy sadness. I remember it, wasting no time uncrumpling that piece of paper and squinting to read it right there in the dimly lit hallway. I recall the way my limbs grew cold, how my fingers shook. The feeling of my stomach twisting horribly and dropping to my shoes.  


  
**1. Ignore the hooves. No matter how loud they get.**  
**2. Ignore Maya. There is no need to reply to her. She’s fine.**  
**3. Feed her at 3am every night. The food you need is in the red box in the fridge. Only give her one slab of meat. Do not cook it.**  
**4. We don’t have a dog. If you see one, don’t pet it. Close the door.**  
**5. Tell her it’s time to sleep at11pm. Do not reply to her.**  
**6. Do not open her bedroom door under any circumstances.**  
**7. If you hear whispering, do not look at the ceiling. Don’t look up.**  
**8. Make sure you’re asleep between the hours of 4-5am. If you can’t sleep, lock yourself in the bathroom. Take the crucifix from the kitchen. Do not leave till you hear me come home. Ensure it is me before you open the door.**

  
Immediately, I went to call the police. *Obviously*. But shamefully, my finger paused on that third number, hovering over the digit before I backtracked, deciding to call Meena instead. The exchange was short, only 32 seconds and lengthened only by the way my breathing had become quick and laboured, reading over the note four times as she spoke.  


  
“These rules,” I barked without a greeting, “You can’t seriously-”  


  
“She’s safe,” she murmured tiredly in response, as though she’d repeated the line a thousand times, “It looks unsafe for her, but it isn’t. Everything is for her. Everything is what she wants.”  


  
*“I’m not throwing raw meat into her room.”*  


  
Meena paused, and I know now it was the first time she lied to me. “Maya thinks chicken is grown-up food but we don’t like to eat it. She puts it in her easy-bake oven then we bin it in the morning. Just… listen, you’re just there to make sure she’s looked after while she sleeps. It’s the easiest job in the world. Don’t you want the money?”  


  
And I did. I did want it. So I stayed.  


  
That first night was the easiest. It scared the shit out of me at the time but when I look back, I can still practically feel the way death crept into my veins every moment I spent inside those walls, the way the house was eating me alive. It took me only a few moments to pad up to her room, noting the heavy silence as I pressed an ear to her door. What I didn’t expect, when my cheek pushed flush to the wood, was for a deep, gravelly voice to stab at me through the wall separating us.  


  
*“I hear you, fleshbag.”*  


  
I wrenched my head free, barely able to gasp for air before a girlish giggle left the room, bouncing around my head as she hurriedly spoke again.  


  
“Made you jump! What’s your name? Can I see you? You sound prettier than the others.”  


  
“I didn’t…“ *say anything*, I wanted to finish, but she got there first.  


  
“I can hear you breathing. You sound young.”  


  
I had no reason to feel unsafe yet, not really. But I know in that moment I felt the weight of the house forcing down upon my shoulders threateningly, causing my knees to buckle. Her words wrapped around my throat like a noose, her light tone like nails on a chalkboard. Never had I experienced something quite so *wrong* before, never had the air felt quite so barren and cold. But I swallowed, trying to keep my tone jovial. I needed the money.  


  
“I’m your new babysitter, just checking in to say hi!”  


  
She laughed then; a horrible, gravelly wheeze that could have belonged to a sixty-year-old man.  


  
“You’re not supposed to say hi, *fleshbag*.”  


  
It was something else entirely, the fear I felt. It was surely just a child pranking me but the impending doom of feeling as though I was going to die was overwhelming. I’d never been scared before, not like that. So I ran downstairs, shutting the living room door and hurriedly putting cartoons on the TV, because that was the least threatening thing I could imagine. I swore I heard her laugh from upstairs for the entire length of the show I watched.  


  
For three days it was fine.  


  
I didn’t throw the meat in there because a nine-year-old girl didn’t need raw chicken crammed through a horrible letterbox carved into her bedroom door. Meena didn’t mention it when she’d come home with glassy pearls of fear for eyes, and I tried not to think about it at the worst time every night - needing the bathroom. I tried not to go. God, I tried. I didn’t drink a thing while I was there, because that trip across the hallway past Maya’s room was sickening.  


  
My stomach would twist with every step, temperature dropping every inch closer I got. I would find myself practically running to the bathroom, gasping for air the second the door slammed shut behind me, always finding tears spilling from my eyes. But I hadn’t known horror until I padded past on the third night, stopping dead in my tracks as my eyes caught the letterbox.  


  
Fingers. Jammed through them.  


  
I froze. I did nothing, absolutely paralysed with fear as I took in the twisted, pale hand with yellowing and cracked nails reaching for me. I don’t know why the thought popped into my head, but at the time, I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was inhaling deeply, smelling my fear. Perhaps I heard it over my own terrified panting.  


  
“I’m hungry,” she whispered through the letterbox, and I could hear how close her lips were to it. To me. The air barely left my lungs but it did, words so quiet I have no idea how she heard them.  


  
“What do you want, Maya?”  


  
She paused. “Meat.”  


  
“I’ll go downstairs and-”  


  
“Yours,” she cut me off simply, voice light and girlish, “I’d like to chew it off you.”  


  
I didn’t use the bathroom that night. Shamefully, I stumbled my way downstairs in haste and pulled a mug from the back of the cupboard, using it to relieve myself into, right there in the kitchen. As I had done every night, I fell to a slumber in front of the flickering TV, though this time I shook like a leaf as I tried to imagine the money flooding my bank account. The deposit had already gone in, and it had paid half my rent this month.  


  
All day I’d think about going to that house. All day I’d fight the sick feeling that hit me like a train as I stepped through their front door, witnessing the light bleed out as it shut behind me and locked me in *there*. It was day six I heard the hooves stamping directly above my head at around 3 am, startling me from my light slumber. Up till now I’d done the bare minimum by showing up, but now the list stared at me from the coffee table mockingly.  


  
*Thud. Thud. Thud.*  


  
Bile rose up my throat but I steadied my breathing, trying not to move. It was unmistakable, *clattering*. Like the slow, heaving thud of a horse with no direction. Pacing, hammering down deliberately and so loudly I swore the house shook. It moved back and forth across Maya’s room, growing louder and louder till the light fitting above began to shake and tremble, little white flakes raining down on my head.  


  
“*Stop!*” I screamed, startled at my own voice and stilling as the house halted into silence once more. My lip trembled, eyes squeezed shut as I tried to count down from ten. I’d attempted to make logic fit the situation a thousand times, both inside and outside those walls. I’d even write lists of all the rational ways all of this could make sense, but to walk into that house was to know absolutely everything was wrong. To even be near Maya’s room was to feel the pull of death. But more days passed, and I was getting closer to my riches. Every odd thing that happened, I sat still and held my eyes closed, fingers jammed into my ears.  


  
Until day 11.  


  
Honestly, I’d coasted up until that point. Every day before I went home, I’d jam a piece of rotting meat into my bag in case Meena checked the box in the fridge. I’d paint a smile on my face when she stared at me warily, I’d take a bottle to urinate in, right there in the living room. I never even went upstairs. I didn’t know half of what went on because I’d become used to taking noise-cancelling headphones and blasting music, turning it down when I was ready to sleep in the fetal position on the sofa. I was doing it. I was making it work.  


  
Until I wasn’t.  


  
I realise now that it all happened because she was starving. Now, I see that the meat placated her, and when the hooves finally got loud enough for me to hear them over eardrum-shattering bass, I knew I’d fucked up. It was 3am and the slamming sounded over and over again, but no, it wasn’t pounding footsteps on the floor this time. To my absolute horror, I realised what the house-shaking chaos was. She was slamming into her fucking bedroom door.  


  
I know I screamed. I’m sure of it, wailing like a child as I scrambled to get to the stairs, for whatever reason thinking *getting closer* was the way to stop her, as though pushing against the door would keep her inside. I hadn’t spoken to her since that day with the letterbox, but she cackled now, a thousand voices layering over one another to create one awful chorus of *evil*.  


  
“*My meal is coming to me!*”  


  
I sobbed, days of unbearable fear bubbling to the surface as I slammed hands on her door, shrieking at the devastating cold coming from it. It wasn’t that which caused me to recoil, but rather the sudden silence and cold, empty eyes staring unblinkingly at me through the letterbox. They gazed up at me, black holes of endless nothing and looking like portals to someplace I never wanted to go. When she spoke, it was a threatening whisper.  


  
“*I’m skinny enough to climb through the letterbox now.*”  


  
I ran. I believed her, imagined her contorting herself to jam herself through that slit in the door, and I knew it to be true. I knew nothing of what she looked like - my imagination had gone wild for 11 days - but I knew I didn’t want to witness it. I’d always believed in hell, and from the first day I padded through that hallway downstairs, I’d felt it with me in this house. The sensible thing to do in my terror was to make for the front door, which I did - but it was jammed. Stuck. I don’t know how. It was as if I could feel the gravity sucking it inwards, invisible hands holding me inside the four walls of this enormous coffin. I was going to die here.  


  
Death nearly claimed me on the spot as a delighted shriek echoed upstairs, followed by thunderous footsteps, growing with speed every passing nanosecond. She was *running*. It sounded like *ten people* were running as the smashing loudness grew closer, following me as I screamed and hurled myself into the living room, slamming the door behind me as a chorus of deafening chaos hurled itself down the stairs to rip me to pieces.  


  
The hallway floor was made of rotting wood, and just like that, barrelling thunder turned to careful, deliberate hooves hitting oak. *One, two, three*, creeping towards the room I scrambled across the floor of, clumsily reaching for my phone. It was Meena I desperately called, Meena I needed as the steps outside slowed, till I could hear chilling, noisy panting only a single door away from me. It stood there, only the thinnest of lines separating me from hell itself.  


  
*“It’s out, it’s out!”* I wailed into the phone, too terrified to utter anything else as the device slipped between trembling fingers and I desperately reached for the curtains, wrenching them down into a pile on top of me. Through a slit of light, I saw the worst sight of the night so far - bars. Bars over the window, shutting me - *and it* \- in this awful place. And so my fate was sealed as the door behind me audibly flew off its hinges and I cowered in the mass of material, wondering if a thin layer of cotton was enough to save me from being torn to shreds.  


  
“*I smell your skin,*” it rasped delightedly, *“I’m going to wear it tonight, I’m going to empty your bones out onto the floor and wear your skin till it snaps.”*  


  
My hand trembled so horribly that I could barely see the shaking watch sitting upon my wrist, a blazing 4:26 am shrieking at me from the device. I’d lost all ability to move, so when the world stilled and I heard wet, slow footsteps slapping towards me, I could barely even muster the strength to hold my breath. Worse still, the footsteps were very clearly not on the floor. They were on the ceiling.  


  
“Let’s play,” she giggled, and I almost leapt upwards when I realised her voice was a rancid, rotting tickle next to my ear, “You get a headstart. If I catch you, though, I’m going to gouge your eyes out and feed them to your family!”  


  
I couldn’t breathe. A panic attack threatened to claw its way through my body, but there was no time. There was none.  


  
*“Ten…”*  


  
*“…Nine…”*  


  
*“…Eight…”*  


  
It was only in my peripheral vision that I saw her. It was impossible not to, really, because she stood the entire height of the floor to the ceiling, claw-like hands so close to me dripping with thick, congealed blood. I didn’t see her face, but I could feel her stare upon me. A nightmarish gaze that singed my skin, born from eyes somewhere far, far from here. The rest is honestly a blur. I think when you feel fear so truly otherworldly, your brain does well to smear the lines of understanding till you question whether or not it actually happened at all.  


  
I remember stumbling up those stairs, choking back bile as my legs dropped like jelly every few seconds, listening to her monotonous counting in horror. I recall running past her room, not pausing to really *stare* at the blood-soaked monstrosity, bones lining the floor and piling up the walls. I know I grabbed the crucifix from the wall closest to me and held it so tightly my hand began to trickle with blood, evidence it all happened because I still have the scars to this day.  


  
“*Ready or not - I’m coming to eat you!*”  


  
I didn’t get far. I’d collapsed in a sobbing heap at the end of the landing, watching with tear-filled eyes as a shadow grew around me, stretching impossibly far up the wall. It was too tall, too close. It moved so slowly and deliberately, the stench of rot and mould growing ever closer with each mocking footstep. I watched the horns protrude from that shadow, held my shaking body still as I waited for it to startle me with claws through the skull. I felt its wet breath on my cheek as it spoke, voice deeper than I’d heard anything utter words before.  


  
“*Found you, fleshbag*,” it hissed, and that was that. My fate was supposed to be written in blood, but it wasn't, because of a woman taking the stairs two at a time, yelling louder than even I managed. *Meena* was there, my very own version of god, clutching vials of liquid and throwing them haphazardly in wild screeches, muddling my mess of memories about a night I never want to remember in full. But she was there and I was safe and I’ll never recall it properly, not really. Just that she was grabbing a bundle of something thrashing in her arms and wrenching it from me and I was free. I was free.  


  
But the cool air had barely caressed my skin before she was grabbing my shoulders, shouting numbers at me. *Numbers*. Wildly rising numbers, life-changing numbers. But nothing was worth that, was it? Not ten thousand. Not twenty thousand. “*Just three more days?*” she’d pleaded, blood staining her streetlamp-lit face twisted in desperation. *Thirty thousand. Your university tuition.*  


  
I did it. Three more days. I don’t want to recall them - I’ve never uttered the words aloud. I never will, not to probing therapists or distant family members. The only crystal-clear memories I hold of those three days was the feeling of my hanging nerves being severed, razor teeth crunching through bone as Maya yanked my arm through her letterbox, chewing my arm clean off at the elbow. It took me so long to type this with one hand, but it’s worth it. It was all worth it. The compensation was insane - a *lot* more than the meagre thirty thousand she offered me. Meena didn’t have a dog, but it was easier for her if we told the authorities that was how I lost an entire limb in such a terrible mess.  


  
I still feel Maya sometimes. I don’t know what she is, or why she’s latched onto me so ferociously. I smell her often, the unmistakable stench of rot and desperation. I’ll be half-asleep and hear the clattering of hooves in my kitchen, the heavy wheezing of lungs full of blood. But it’s okay. She might haunt me till I die, which I suppose could be anytime, but she does it *here* in my beachside abode, only metres from soft, lapping waves. I never want for money. Sometimes I think it might have been the worst thing I ever did, but no, it was all worth it. 


  
It was all worth it.
