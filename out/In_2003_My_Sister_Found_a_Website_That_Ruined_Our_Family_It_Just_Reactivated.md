Today, I turned thirty years old. I didn’t even remember it was my birthday until Becca from Claims showed up at my cubicle with a little cupcake from one of those overpriced bakeries in the arts district. She said she made a special trip there on her way in—just for me.

“Happy Birthday, Jess!”

It was a genuinely kind gesture, and I knew it. I wanted to say something heartfelt. Something like, “Thank you so much for thinking of me, that’s really kind.” But what actually came out of my mouth was:

“Cheers.”

I’ve never said that in my life. It’s not my thing. I’m not British. I’m not charming. And I definitely don’t deserve cupcakes from people who are just trying to be nice.

Becca gave me a tight smile, nodded, and walked off. I pretended I didn’t see the awkwardness on her face, and she pretended it didn’t sting.

I spent twenty minutes in the bathroom trying to cry quietly into a handful of scratchy paper towels. I ran through about a hundred ways to apologize.

I imagined buying her cookies from a rival artisanal bakery. I’d drop them off with a funny note. I’d make her laugh. Maybe we’d all go out for drinks and karaoke. Maybe I’d finally let myself be normal.

But the truth is, I’m not. Not anymore.

My coworkers are always trying to include me. Birthday cards. Invites to parties in the break room. Warm smiles and polite conversation. I always say I’ve got a meeting or I’m on deadline. It’s easier than trying to explain what’s wrong with me—why I can’t join in.

Maybe this story will explain why.

Earlier today, my mom called. I didn’t pick up. I knew why she was calling. She always gets emotional on my birthday. She wants to talk about Ashley.

That's the last thing I want to do.

Ashley was my older sister. Nine years older. She was beautiful and clever and knew everything about everything. I followed her around like a shadow, desperate to be just like her. I wore what she wore. I copied her handwriting. If she liked a song, I memorized every lyric.

And for a while, she didn’t mind. She let me orbit her world like a tiny, annoying moon. She'd give me advice on boys, even though I didn’t like boys yet. She’d let me sit on her bed while she painted her nails and told me about how Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson's marriage was in trouble.

Then, one Christmas, she got a computer.

It was 2003. She was sixteen. The internet back then wasn’t like it is now. It felt... lawless. There were corners of it that didn’t feel human. Places that had been online since the early '90s and never shut down—just festering in the dark. Waiting.

At first, Ashley let me sit beside her while she surfed the web. We’d type dumb questions into Ask Jeeves like, “Do Sharks Ever Get Braces?” But eventually, she started shutting her door at night. Started locking it. If I knocked, she’d scream at me to go away.

She got quieter. More withdrawn. Stopped dating. Stopped joking. She had these dark circles under her eyes, like she wasn’t sleeping. I caught her whispering to herself once, repeating a phrase over and over, like a prayer. I still remember it:

>“I have to climb.”

I didn’t understand what that meant.

Then, one day, I faked being sick so I could stay home from school. I waited until Mom got busy in the kitchen and then snuck into Ashley’s room. I turned on her computer, used the password I’d memorized—jessicasimpsonsux—and opened Internet Explorer.

She had a bunch of bookmarks. Teen gossip blogs. Music lyrics. Nick Lachey fansites.

But one stood out.

It looked old. Even for back then. Black background, white text. One sentence in the middle of the screen:

"Solve the Puzzle."

Underneath was a string of gibberish. Or maybe a code. I didn’t recognize it. I clicked around, but that was it. No links. No images. Just that one line and the box.

I didn’t understand what I was seeing, but I felt wrong just looking at it. Like the website was looking back. Like something had noticed me.

I shut off the computer, went back to my bed, and spent the rest of the day feeling those eyes on me. Feeling tracked. When Ashley came home from school, she went into her room. I almost went in and asked her about it. I sometimes wonder, if I had gone to her, would it have all turned out different?

Two weeks before my birthday, Ashley had an incident at school. The school janitor caught her on the roof. She had leaned a ladder up against the brick wall and climbed up. He found her up there staring out over the city. The details get fuzzy after that, because we only got Ashley's version.

I guess he tried to get her to respond, maybe touched her shoulder, but somehow he startled her and ended up going over the edge. It was only two stories, but he landed on his head. He didn’t die right away, but he never woke up, either.

Ashley got suspended indefinitely, pending an investigation. When I asked her why she was up there, she simply said: “He told me to climb.”

At the time, I thought she meant the janitor. I assumed he was the one who told her to go up there. None of it really made sense to me, but some part of me still believed she was the sister I had always known.

A week later, my mom had decided to move full steam ahead with my birthday party despite the cloud hanging over the household. She asked me to grab some ribbons from the basement. On the way back up, I saw Ashley’s bedroom door cracked open. Her backpack was on the bed, but she was in the shower.

I don’t remember deciding to look. I just did.

Inside one of her notebooks were pages and pages of strange words. Scrawled like she was trying to work something out—like the act of writing them was keeping something at bay. Some were crossed out, others circled. At the bottom of one page, she’d written something that’s stayed with me ever since:

“Who sits at the top of the ladder?”

I heard the shower turn off so I shoved the notebook back in her bag and went back to helping my mom. If I was older, maybe I would've understood how ominous all this was. Maybe I could've connected all the dots and seen that something was really wrong with my sister.

But I woke up on the day of my birthday expecting cake and games with all my friends. They were all supposed to arrive at two, and I anxiously hovered as my mother prepared everything in the kitchen.

I didn't actually see Ashley that day. I only heard her bedroom door open and close. By the time I stepped up to the bay windows and looked down the hall, she was gone. I thought she went into the bathroom, but she actually went into the basement.

I didn’t realize anything was wrong until the doorbell rang. The first guest had arrived—a girl from my class named Caroline—and Mom went to let her in. That’s when she noticed the basement door was cracked open.

“Ashley?” she called.

No answer.

She opened the door fully, took a step down, and screamed.

I remember her scream more than anything else from that day. I remember how her hand shook when she reached for the phone. I remember the way the cops spoke in hushed voices, like they didn’t want to wake something.

Ashley was found at the bottom of the basement stairs. No bruises. No wounds. Just... gone. Her body was limp but undamaged. Her expression blank. Her pupils dilated like she'd stared at something for a very long time.

The EMTs said her heart had stopped. Just like that. Like a light switching off.

They couldn’t explain it. No drugs in her system. No trauma. No signs of self-harm. The official report said “cardiac arrest of undetermined cause.”

I was seven. I didn’t understand the words they used. I just knew the party was canceled and I didn’t want to go into the basement ever again.

Years passed. I stopped asking questions. Stopped talking about her. And in time, people around me stopped bringing her up at all.

But that website stayed with me.

I never told anyone about it. Not my mom. Not a therapist. Not even a friend. But it was like a sliver buried deep under the skin of my memory. Every so often, it would itch.

After the cupcake incident and the bathroom cry, I found myself sitting at my desk with no more excuses. My mom called and I let it go to voicemail, but then I was thinking about Ashley, and next thing I know, I'm typing.

I didn’t even realize what I typed until I hit enter.

[deathcipher.com](http://deathcipher.com)

It was still live. There was the same phrase: Solve This Puzzle!

And below it I read: “V2lsbCBZb3UgQ2xpbWIgVGhlIExhZGRlcj8=”

I knew what it was instantly—Base64.

See, in the 23 years since I'd last seen it, I'd learned to code. I was in IT at my company. Another easy place to hide.

You drop it into a simple decoder and voila, the message reads: “Will You Climb The Ladder?”

I stared at the dialog box where I was supposed to enter my answer. What the hell. I typed “yes” and pressed enter.

I took the long way to the break room (to avoid Becca) and grabbed a coffee. The strange feeling I had was beginning to fade. Maybe I was letting all the memories get to me. This is why I don't dwell on the past.

But when I came back to my desk, a new email was waiting for me.

It had no subject line.

The sender address was one I hadn’t seen in over twenty years:

[nicklacheylover139@hotmail.com](mailto:nicklacheylover139@hotmail.com)

Ashley’s old email.

I clicked it open.

There was only one line:

>Do Not Climb The Ladder.  
*Love, Ashley*
