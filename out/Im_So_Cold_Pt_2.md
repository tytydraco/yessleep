I'm an ex USFS officer. You may have seen my previous post where I uploaded the transcript of the notebook I found of a man who was stranded in one of the National Forests in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in a blizzard. If you haven't, I will link back to that post.

When my higher-ups found out about my post, I was immediately fired. I signed a non-disclosure agreement, but I can't keep this knowledge to myself. In this post I will upload my report that tells all about my expedition to find the Whistler, what the Whistler actually is, and what happened to me and the men I took out with me. 

Report Entry #1

When I first arrived at the scene I found a half eaten man. He was fully nude other that a thin blanket that was discarded to his left. I estimated that the fire had only died roughly an hour before I'd arrived. The body was fresh other than being frozen. The man was missing his heart, liver, kidneys, and stomach. His chest, thighs, calves, and neck were stripped to the bone of their meat. To his right, I found the notebook. It described his last days on this mortal plane. 

When I went into his tent/shelter he built, I found the bones of his dog. He'd butchered her and used her fur for warmth. There was none of her meat left, so either he ate it all, or the Whistler consumed it after it finished him off. 

His car was completely undrivable. The tires were slashed, the windows broken, and all the wiring under the steering column was torn out. Even if he wanted to drive out of that place, he couldn't. 

After I informed my higher-ups, they told me that I couldn't share this information with anyone. They said that things like this just happen from time to time. That people go into the woods who are unprepared for the harsh weather and eventually they beging to hallucinate and freeze to death. Then their bodies inevitably get eaten on by scavengers. However, from what I read in his journal, it sounds like this man was well prepared. Food, water, cold resistant gear, and fire supplies. He had them all. There were also no signs of wolves or anything of the sort. The place felt empty. Like an abandoned home. The only evidence of life were the remains of both the victim and his dog. There were also strange footprints in the snow. 

The prints looked almost like wolf prints, but they were off. Like a cross between a raccoon, a wolf, and a bear's prints. I knew I'd seen them before, so I took a few pictures to compare them to my animal footprint charts. Whatever it was, it was enormous. The prints were a bit larger than my size 13 jungle boots. Roughly a size 15 just by eyeballing them. After I gathered all of this unauthorized information, I went home to study it. 

Report Entry #2

Victim's Journal Entry:
“The Whistler is looking at me now. His jaws hang open as the Low-High-Low rings from his gullet. His enormous furry body looks so warm. I crave his embrace. His maw is ready to strike. This is the last entry in my journal. He looks so hungry. I'm so cold.”

Although I didn't believe it at first, after analyzing the footprints and comparing them to my charts, I'd decided that they belonged to an otter. In all my years of strange occurrences, including what I'm pretty sure were Bigfoot prints, I'd never seen otter prints of this size or evidence of one being bipedal. I estimated that this creature must've been at least 6’8” and 300lbs or more. I was more confused at this point than I was when I found  the campsite. I then took the details of Low-High-Low whistles and otters and took to the Internet. That's when I decided that this beast is a Kushtaka. 

Wikipedia Entry:
“Kóoshdaa káa or Kushtaka (lit. "land otter man") are mythical shape-shifting creatures found in the folklore of the Tlingit peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America.Physically, Kóoshdaa káa are shape-shifters capable of assuming human form, the form of an otter and potentially other forms. In some accounts, a Kóoshdaa káa is able to assume the form of any species of otter; in others, only one. Accounts of their behaviour seem to conflict with one another. In some stories, Kóoshdaa káa are cruel creatures who take delight in tricking poor Tlingit sailors to their deaths. It is also said that the Kóoshda káa emit a high pitched, three part whistle in the pattern of low-high-low.”

The first question I had was if this creature was a shape-shifter. At this point I couldn't rule anything out. I didn't see any evidence of its prints morphing from human to otter, but hey, I'm not an expert. The second question was what was it doing this far from the Pacific Northwest? I supposed that it wasn't impossible that over millennia they expanded their range. This was already mind bending enough. I just had to believe that this beast was there and killed this man. Then I had to do something about it. 

Report Entry #3

A week ago I went back to my old headquarters. I had to sneak in because my old boss had instructed all of my old coworkers to not let me in. I managed to convince four of my old coworkers to hear me out. At first they didn't believe me. Then I showed them all the photos I took, had them read the victim's notebook, and showed them all the research I did. These guys were no strangers to the weird and fascinating. Buddy #1 once found a random staircase in the middle of the forest that led nowhere. Buddy #2 saw what he could only explain as a giant bipedal wolf. Buddy #3 swore up and down that he once saw Santa's sleigh flying overhead. Buddy #4 just really wanted to join up. He was exceedingly bored and was curious about the giant otter. 

Wikipedia Entry:
“Legends have it Kóoshdaa káa can be warded off through copper, urine, dogs, and in some stories, fire.”

We had very little information on how to stay safe while searching for the Kushtaka other than sketchy Wikipedia articles. We decided to arm ourselves with everything we could. Copper was easy. All of our bullets were copper coated so that was no big deal. We decided to collect dog urine in a two birds one stone situation. Harvesting was fairly straight forward seeing as we all owned dogs except for Buddy #1 being more of a cat guy. Fire was easy. Buddy #4 decided that a flame thrower would be appropriate. We agreed. We also had flares, kerosene, and lighters in case things got too hairy. 

We headed out on a Monday. We had every intention of staying out until we killed the beast. We just had to hope that it was an animal and not some mythical magical creature. We drove to the victim's campsite which had been completely cleaned by our higher-ups. We set up camp, and waited. 

Report Entry #4 

Night one led to nothing out of the ordinary. Just some forest critters wandering through our site. We headed down to the pond that the victim described. There were no giant otter prints, or any sign that anything had been there in an extended period of time. Granted, the victim was here in December. It's now February, so this thing could be anywhere by now. However, the forest here was surprisingly quiet. That usually means that there is a predator nearby. I had a feeling that the Kushtaka is somewhere near. The next week was the same. Nothing really happened. 

Night 10 brought better results. Buddy #2 had gone out that night for firewood. He heard the whistles. He said it was the most eerie sound. When he got back to the tent, he was pale as a ghost and shivering like crazy. We all noticed that the temp had begun to drop. We checked the thermometer and in a matter of an hour, the temp had gone from 15°F to -12°F. Does the Kushtaka have an effect on the temperature? Or does it only strike once it decides it's cold enough? I had no idea. All I knew was that it was cold, and we began hearing the whistles. Low-High-Low. 

Victim's Journal Entry:
“It's been four days since the first encounter with the Whistler. My ankle has swollen five times its usual size. Every night the Whistler torments me with its constant Low-High-Low whistles. It thrashes around, breaking branches and throwing them at the tent. It won't come within 20ft from the tent. I think it doesn't like Kita's smell.”

Like the victim recorded, we discovered the next morning that the Kushtaka had circled our camp. A circle of giant otter tracks where it would come past 20ft from us. Also like in the victim’s journal, our only mode of transportation has been destroyed. I was hoping that the beast wouldn't be as bold with the five of us here, but it seems that it doesn't fear us. Tonight, Buddy #1 has decided to post up in a tree to see if he can get a shot on the beast. We had all brought our night vision scopes, but he was the best shot. We spent the rest of the day preparing for our sneak attack. When night approached, Buddy #1 suited up. His first layer was his kevlar body armor. The rest was just for warmth. Unfortunately, we had underestimated the Kushtaka. 

Report Entry #5

That night, we heard the whistles. We heard the Kushtaka crunching the snow and the twigs all around us. We had placed our hope in Buddy #1. Suddenly the Kushtaka stopped. It released a sound that was crossed between a whistle and a growl. Then we heard five quick shots followed by a roar of animalistic pain. Then we heard his screams. We sat in horror as we heard Buddy #1 crying for help. Begging us to help him. We heard his bones break. We heard the flesh being torn off his frame. His screams turned to grunts. His grunts turned to gurgles. And his gurgles turned to bone chilling silence. We waited. We cried. We heard it. Low-High-Low. 

The next morning, we found the carnage. Buddy #1's body was twisted into grotesque shapes. His jaw was broken and morphed into an eternal plea for help. His eyes were white with frost, but they still burned into our souls. His expression was of hate and accusation. His chest cavity had been cracked open. His organs were missing. Most, we assumed, had been eaten. His small intestines were strewn all about the campsite. Buddy #2 vomited. Buddy #3 cried. Buddy #4 was in shock. I was furious. 

The next night a blizzard blew in, we decided that enough was enough. Either the Kushtaka would die or we would die with guns blazing. If we walked out of here, the Kushtaka would pick us off one by one. If we stood and fight, we might've stood a chance. We prepared for our fight. 

As expected, we did not win. Buddy #2 was the first of us to go down. The Kushtaka blindsided him like a wild boar dragging him off into the night. We heard the squelching of his meat being wrent from his bones. The screams or gurgly agony ringing out into the night. The constant Low-High-Low penetrating our smells were driving us mad. Buddy #3 fell next. That was when Buddy #4 and I finally saw the beast in full. A lumbering 7ft (ish) tall bipedal otter. Claws like chef's knives. Teeth like ice picks. Its jaw was slack as the whistles rang out. It was holding Buddy #3 by the back of the neck as if it was presenting him to us. With a sickening CRUNCH his neck broke in the Kushtaka’s paw. It then began to gnaw on his neck. Blood flowed forth like a flash flood. Buddy #4 and I hightailed it back to the busted up car. Before we got in, we placed road flares all around and dumped all of the dog piss onto the ground. We huddled into the car and wept. 

Tomorrow. We leave tomorrow. No matter what. 

Final Entry:

We tried to make it back together. We hiked as soon as the sun rose. We were hoping that the pattern of attack (the Kushtaka attacking at night) meant that we'd be safe in the daylight. We were not. 

The nearest town was 2hr by car going 60mph. By foot it would take forever, but we didn't have a choice. It was worth a shot. The main road was fairly busy. That was only 45min by car if we could've made it there in time. 

About halfway to the road, it caught us. We heard the whistles well before we saw it. I'm not sure exactly what happened to Buddy #4, but he told me to keep going while he stayed to fight. All he kept with him was the jugg of kerosene and one of the flare guns. All I know is that I'm alive because of him. The Kushtaka is still out there. Please, whatever you do, do NOT go looking for it. Let it be.

If you're reading this, I beg you. Don't go into the woods in the winter. At least not alone. And whatever you do, stay warm.
