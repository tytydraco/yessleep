 Hello everyone. My name is Adam and I'm 27 years old. So, I know the title is a bit 'out there' but let me explain.

I live in London, England, and....well things have basically gone to shit in the last three hours. I still don't know what exactly is happening but from what I've seen on TV and in person (more on that later), I think we have a viral outbreak on our hands. But first, we have to go back to this morning.

I woke up at around 8:30 am today as it was my day off from work where I am a runner for a television show. I went downstairs, prepared breakfast and began watching the BBC Breakfast show, as always. Nothing out of the ordinary here. As I finish up my coffee and my scrambled eggs, they announce what would basically be the beginning of the end. This is what the newsreader said:

"Officials of His Majesty's Government have confirmed that the protests of rail workers, nurses, ambulance drivers and postal workers have now escalated into violent riots. The strikes became more violent in the early hours of this morning and officials have now confirmed that the people partaking in protests are now attacking one another viscously and the protests are becoming more widespread. This was first noticed in the Newham area of London and is so far only taking place there. Disruption to travels and emergency services are to be expected as police are already being overwhelmed by the sudden surge in violence. It has also been announced that the military could be brought in if matters escalate."

Oh, dear. That's not good. I decided to put it out of my mind and see what the afternoon held with the one o'clock news. As the day progressed, I began to notice really weird things. I live on a relatively dead street in Mill Hill, North London. And by that I mean 4-5 cars a day, 6-7 people walking by. 8 if it's a nice day. But today, nothing. Nothing at all. Huh. Weird. I popped down to a local shop at around 12:30 to grab some snacks and bread for the morning. As I was leaving, I heard the scream of a man coming from the backrooms of the shop, along with weird growling sounds. The cashier ran to see what was wrong and that was that. I left the shop, my mind ablaze with thoughts. I figured either some sort of shelf fell down or some dog got in to the shop. I made it back home in time for the 1pm news. And oh boy, did it have a boat load of updates.

"Riots that have stemmed from the strikes of underpaid workers have now become increasingly violent and widespread over the last hours. The riots began earlier today in Newham but are now being reported across London and England, with Scotland and Wales still yet to be affected. Such cities include Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Plymouth, Brighton, Bournemouth, Cambridge and Bristol. Military forces were officially brought in at 11:30 this morning, with the British Army setting up borders around Wales, Scotland and the affected cities. People said to be partaking in the riots are now confirmed to be physically attacking anybody they see. Officials are still yet to comment on this matter."

At this point, my mind is racing. Riots? Attacking? About thirty more places getting this? What the fuck is happening? I called my mother who lives in Greenwich and her and my dad are now at home with me. My brother is currently overseas in New York and my two sisters live abroad in Australia and Canada. I decide to just put it out my mind and think that everything will be fine. God, that seems so stupid now. I get a call from a couple of friends to head down to the pub with them for a few drinks. I was hesitant but as of then, nothing was reported in Barnet, which is where Mill Hill is. So at around 5:30 I head out. On my walk down to the pub, I caught my second glimpse of what was unfolding. It takes me 5-6 minutes to get to the pub and in that time I saw 9 ambulances and 13 police cars. One ambulance even lost control and hit a few cars. Most alive I'd seen my area in a long while. I got to the pub just before 5:40 and my friends were over in the corner. We ordered a few beers and just had a laugh in general. We weren't drunk by any means, but only slightly tipsy. At around 8pm, a lovely little song called Grace Kelly came on and people started dancing and going crazy. I excused myself and headed to the men's bathroom. As I was washing my hands, a loud bang came from the stained window. I could see clear as day a pair of bloodied hands smashing the window frame. From outside I could hear growling and yelling mixed with the muffled lyrics of the song and....screams?

I turn my attention away from the window to the men's restroom door. I slowly walk my way out and back into the bar. I was confronted with what I can only describe as carnage. The chorus to Grace Kelly blasted my eardrums and my eyes were blasted with the scene of pub-goers ripping each others throats out. My eyes dart across the room and I see my friends in the corner. All feasting on a man. I instantly ran outside to even more chaos. Fire ripped through houses along the street, people running in confusion, cars crashing. It's all a daze now. Without warning, I was tackled to the floor by one of those things. Time stopped in that moment. I caught a glimpse of its face. It looked like just like a person. Nothing new. A regular person, just angered and covered in blood. As time began to become normal again, I used my hand to shield myself away from it and grabbed a glass bottle next to me and smashed it over the thing's head. From there, I sprinted my way home, not looking back. On my way, I saw nothing but horrifying scenes. People being killed, cars crashing and people being infected.

As soon as I got home, I saw my nightmares unfolding before me. Two of those things trying to get into my house. I took a rock from the garden and smashed it over their heads. I got inside to see my parents in the living room corner holding knives. Instantly, I went to the kitchen to grab a chair to block the door. It won't hold for long, but it'll do while we figure out what to do. We turned on the TV and the only channel giving updates was BBC One. The newsreader announced:

"The riots of underpaid workers that began this morning are now officially out of control. The NHS has also now confirmed that a viral outbreak has occurred and is the central cause for the violence in England. Eye witnesses posting on social media describe the infected people biting and scratching one another and even brutally murdering. Officials have advised that civilians stay indoors and lock and barricade any home entrances. As of right now, the military and police are struggling to cope which may lead to international services being brought in to help fight-"

Without warning, the TV signal cut out. We were only left with a stand-by message. Apparently even hackers hacked the servers and displayed a message saying "THE END IS WELL FUCKING NIGH." It's three hours later now. Me and my parents have a plan. We've already packed essentials in bags and we're heading for the countryside at the crack of dawn. Luckily, we have a towing wire so we can use both my car and theirs if needed. As of right now, it's 11:36 pm. The TV only displays a 'Please Stand by' message. The last thing ever said before another hacking showed 'England has fallen' was an alert message. I'll post this now and update you if everything works. For now, goodbye and stay safe.

"This is BBC Television from London. We are interrupting our normal programming for an emergency broadcast on behalf of His Majesty's Government. In the early hours of this morning, an unknown virus began to spread in the Newham area of London. People seen with this virus are described as 'normal people, yet angered and cannibalistic.' The current threat level of this virus to civilian life and emergency services is critical. Civilians are advised to remain indoors and to block any entrances to homes if possible. Some areas of England have already been evacuated and blockades have been set up around the borders of Scotland and Wales, to prevent this virus from spreading further. If you live in any of the following cities, you are to remain indoors and not to leave for any reason unless needed: London, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Plymouth, Brighton, Bournemouth, Cambridge, Bristol, York and Oxford. Precautionary evacuations have been taking place in Scotland and Wales, with civilians being shipped to other countries."

"Do not attempt to call, message or use the Internet, unless it is essential. Connections may be disconnected without notice. Emergency information regarding this virus will be provided via radio, TV and mobile devices. You should now be prepared for a national lockdown, set to go into effect at midnight tonight. The lockdown will be in place for 14 days. You are not to leave your location unless it is crucial to do so. This virus is spread through the blood and saliva from those infected. You may even be killed by the infected. You should now collect 14 days of essential supplies, including food, drink and medicines. If you have fresh food in your house, use it first to avoid wasting it: food in tins will keep well for a long period of time. You are advised to blockade any doors and windows of your home and to stay away from them if possible. You must ensure you and your family have everything you need within your homes to stay safe in the 14 day lockdown. You should remain in your homes, unless instructed otherwise. Before settling into the lockdown, ensure you turn off all light and close all blinds and curtains to avoid detection from those infected."

"Do NOT, under any circumstance, leave your home unless told to do so. Martial law is now in effect and a state of national emergency has been declared. You must follow police and military instructions without question. If you are yet to locate a place of safety, enter the nearest building and attempt to blockade any entrances. If you can, place any further materials on top of your blockades to help keep the infected out. Remember, there is nothing to be gained by attempting to escape the infected. By leaving your home, you will bring danger to your family and you may die or become infected. Stay in your homes, until you are told it is safe to leave. If you haven't already done so, ensure all windows and doors are locked and barricaded and make your way to safe area of your home. Following the end of the lockdown, there will be a speech from his majesty to address the country. We will end the broadcast with our national anthem. God save the King and may God be with you all."
