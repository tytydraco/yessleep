First time Reddit poster here looking for some help making any kind of sense out of what’s been going on at my apartment complex lately. A friend recommend I bring it here so…. can’t hurt I guess? Or I hope. 

Before I get into it, TW for suicide and gun violence. 

For context: I just moved into this apartment. My last living situation was really bad for my mental health and I needed a fresh start. At first when I got the place with a few roommates, we thought we’d struck gold.  Only a month in, I noticed a huge change in my mental and physical health just from being in a space that felt comfortable and clean and had natural light.In a way I still want to believe it is as perfect as it originally felt, but I guess that’s what this will help me figure out.

One of the reasons it was (is?) so nice is that it’s WAY bougier than I ever expected I would be able to afford. My roommates and I worked really hard to get approved for a government sanctioned affordable housing unit. So in a way, I always feel like I’m crashing a party of “how the other half lives”.

The place is mostly inhabited by tech bros and young finance professionals. It’s the type of place where I assume people are doing coke all the time at their super high profile parties. Which, like, I don’t judge. You do you. But I do feel wildly out of place, financially, socially… in lots of ways. 

Now that some of that exposition is out of the way, let me just explain when things started to get weird. 

Well, weird isn’t the right word for the first incident, at least. “Tragic” would be a better fit. And if it had happened and then none of the rest of the weird things that followed happened, then that’s all it would be: tragic. But since there’s so much going on now that I feel could be connected, well…

At the end of my first month living in this new place, one of the residents committed suicide by jumping off of the roof of the building. I wont get into all the details, but it was very sad. 

What I will go into are all of the strange (possible) domino effect it seemed to trigger. 

Not two weeks after the suicide someone (in what we were informed was a deliberate act of vandalism) took a baseball bat or other blunt object to the fire sprinklers on one of the uppermost floors of the building. This set the sprinklers off and I guess the damage from the blunt object made them a lot harder to shut down. This caused the elevators to flood (all of them required full replacements) AND multiple tenants had to evacuate their homes, live in hotels for weeks while the most effected floors were demolished and rebuilt, and probably lost most of their belongings to water damage. While this SUCKED, the worst was yet to come.

The next week my roommate was walking home, crossing the highway overpass that’s right across the street and on the way to the building. On one of the poles/columns that supports the overpass, she saw that someone had written something. The message read as follows: 

“Your life at [insert Apartment name] is plagued with envy, deceit, guilt, homosexuality. Jump now.”

She took a picture of this, then continued to walk only to find another message written on the next column in the same writing:

“[insert Apartment name] resident: show her your true love by jumping off this overpass.”

We found these extremely creepy and threatening. And, given the suicide in the building not long ago, they felt like they came from someone who really knew the goings-on in the community. After all, we had checked and there was no news coverage about it or anything like that. 

We reported them to management of the building. They said, since it’s on the block next to their property but not on it, there was nothing that could be done about it.

However, none of these compare to what happened this morning. I woke up to an email from management telling people they could still use one of the elevators in the building, they just had to be careful not to touch the blood that was “everywhere” in it. The email said it needed to be kept preserved because police needed to investigate it for evidence in an incident that occurred on the rooftop common space during an unauthorized party in the early hours of the morning. Despite it being an active crime scene, they didn’t sanction off the elevator, just advised people to “step around” the blood. 

My other roommate, unfortunately, used the elevator before he saw the email and could confirm (and show me pictures) that there was blood on the floor and against two of the walls, sort of dried in dripping pattern. 

Eventually, news stations came around and I finally put together that the “incident” at the party was a shooting. Other residents had heard around 10 gunshots. 

Some other details I found out from joining a residents Facebook page like an hour ago include that the maintenance men who work at the building were seen beginning to clean up the scene immediately. Also, some residents have reported seeing a strange and confrontational man watching one of the entrances to the building for days now as if he were posted there. Apparently he got threatening the moment someone asked who he was or what he was doing. 

So, my questions for you, Reddit, are as follows:

1. Could these things be connected? Or do I just watch too much true crime
2. How can I demand that the building do more work to keep its residents safe
3. Are the current tenants being wronged legally in some way in this situation? 
4. What should we do? 

I would be devastated to find out that I can’t trust this living situation. I really need this to work out. Help!!!!!
