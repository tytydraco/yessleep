As the undead thing, whatever it was, inhaled, I saw blue light filling its eyes.

I grabbed my backpack and opened it up, spotting one of the bottles of Cassara’s Jamaican rum.  I grabbed one of the heavy glass bottles.

With shockingly little effort I grabbed Cassara’s shoulder, hoisted myself up, and smashed the bottle across the thing’s face.

It’s head snapped against the window glass, shattering the window, the creature flying out amidst shards of glass.  

Where it went right after that, I wasn’t sure. For my efforts I found myself horrifically off balance, and slipping off of Cassara’s shoulder.

I closed my eyes, and found I was now falling in slow motion.

I moved my hands out in front of me to stop myself, but while my spiritual wings moved, my physical hands were a different matter.

They moved far slower, slower than the ground was coming up to meet me.

I changed tactics, pulling my arms tighter to my chest in an attempt to brace for the impact.

Though it all happened in slow motion, my rate of fall certainly didn’t slow in the real world.  

When I hit the floor, I felt it right across my shoulders as I was jarred out of this strange vision, and back to the real world.

A real world with real pain.

I winced and groaned.

Cassara staggered back, landing on her ass next to me before she turned to look me over, “Thanks, also: Are you okay?”

“Fine,” I winced as I rolled over, the bottle of rum still in my hand.

“Hey,” Cassara growled as she grabbed it from me, “That’s from Kayode!  Don’t go swinging my rum around!” 

“You’ve got eleven bottles,” I groaned, “and somehow, the glass didn’t break, so it’s fine.”

“Yeah well, I don’t think I’m seeing Kayode anytime soon, the last thing I want to do is waste the rum he gave me, okay?  I’m gonna need every bottle to deal with your shit!” Cassara grumbled as she got to her feet, “Wait, 11?  There should be 12!”

I froze, looking to Cassara hesitantly, “The cop at the dock took one, or he was going to detain me.”

Cassara’s eye twitched, “I need to remember to hit the docks later…” She growled, “But more importantly: What the fuck was that thing?!”

“Whatever it was, it was feeding off of us,” I rubbed my neck.

“Yeah, I could feel it.  When it was on you, it looked like it was sucking the breath out of your lungs,” Cassara shuttered, “Felt like it was just sapping me of my strength.”

I heard the sound of trash bins smashing outside, and ran to the window.  I looked outside to see the same creature, now appearing mostly human, sans for his head and shoulder knocked at odd angles.  

He rose from the ground, hissing and groaning as his broken neck snapped back into place, as well as his dislocated shoulder.  He rolled said shoulder, and glared up at me, snarled like an animal, and ran off down the alley.

I tried to go out the window before Cassara grabbed me by the shoulder.

“That thing doesn’t care about broken bones, unlike you!” Cassara pointed out, “Come on!” 

The two of us rushed to the motel room door, and as we opened it, the large man from the reception desk was standing there, “What did I tell you two?”

I winced, “I can explain-” I paused, “Actually no.  No, I cannot explain.”  I said as I realized that the truth wasn’t going to work and I didn’t have a decent lie ready.

He stormed into the room, looking around to see the closet door opened, and noticed the broken window.  He glared at Cassara, “You!”

Cassara looked at me and then the owner, “Me!?  What did I do?”

“You think you can break my place up just because you think it’s a shit-hole?  Get the fuck out!” He shouted.

I glanced behind him, looking at my backpack, “Okay, listen I… It was an accident, I swear!”

The owner looked to my backpack, grabbed it, and thew it at me, “I don’t give a fuck, get the fuck out!” 

Cassara’s hand grabbed the backpack in the air as she glared at the owner, “Gladly.”

With that, Cassara turned on her heel and left.  

I groaned, “I’m so sorry…” I said before I followed after Cassara.

There we stood in the parking lot, unsure how to get behind the motel, or track the strange creature that had attacked us.

Cassara rubbed the bridge of her nose, “Feel like I was drinking all night.”

I heaved a sigh, “Yeah.  Whatever that thing did to us, I feel pretty drained.”

Cassara pushed my back-pack into my arms, “You owe me for the rum.”

“Thought you were going to get it back from the officer?” I said as I searched around for some way to get behind the motel.

“I need a phone that can play some music,” she growled, “I’ve gone this long getting by with Kayode’s radio.  But I’m sick of Reggie and more sick of silence, and now I’m pissed off,” Cassara turned her attention to me, “So either I start smashing faces in or I get myself a phone.”

I frowned, reaching into my pocket, spotting only the two ten dollar bills Cassara had originally given me, “Think you can get a phone for $20?”

Cassara scoffed, “Fuck no,” she looked to me, “Do *you* have a phone?”

I nodded, “Yeah.  Just haven’t really turned it on since we only just got back to the states.”

“Good, give me your number,” Cassara said with a sigh.

“Why? You don’t have a phone,” I inquired.

“Because I’m going to go get one,” Cassara said as she narrowed her eyes, “And I’ll call you with it when I get it.” She held out her hand, “So give me your number.”

I reached into my bag and found a bit of paper and a pen.  Writing was extremely difficult as I fought with my fingers to listen to me while being unable to feel them, and fighting back the pain which stabbed into the palms of my hand and wrists.  

Despite this, I managed to jot it down, “Ugh, here.”

“Thanks,” Cassara said as she took the paper.  She lifted an eyebrow, “Your handwriting is shit.”

I flinched, and nodded, “Yeah.  Uh, it’s not usually that bad.  But I blame that I didn’t have anything firm to write on.

“Strike two on you now, huh David?” Cassara fixed me with a firm glare, “see you later… and if you spot that freaking shambler or, whatever, find out where it’s going. Don’t fight it yourself.  Or do.  Whatever, I don’t care.”

With that, Cassara walked off, ending the strangest way a woman had ever asked for my number.

Well, the only way a woman had asked for my number, I sadly realized.

I headed out, looking around the motel, attempting to search for the back-ally, or where it had exited.

Eventually I think I found the exit, though I wasn’t entirely sure. 

I closed my eyes to think, only for the shadowy world to reveal itself once more.

What I saw was different from every other time.  Now, waving faintly through the air, were three different colored streaks.  

A very faint yellow, a fainter blue, and a much stronger red and white mixture of mist floating through the air.

I touched it, and the entire stream illuminated, the white and red growing more pronounced. I realized that this mist wrapped around my feathered fingers, unlike the others which merely moved like ink in water when I touched them.

“*Is that my essence?”* I wondered, trying to think of why red and white would be my colors.

I was focusing so much on the streaks, that I had forgotten about the world outside of what I was looking at.

Someone’s arm was on my shoulder, pulling me backwards.

I was spun around by a large hand.  I looked up to spot a tall burly fellow with a rather surly disposition.  

“Notice you’re staring off into space there,” He said, his hand gripping my shoulder tightly, “You see the same shit that I just saw?”

“Well, depends what you saw,” I responded.

The large fellow removed his hand from my shoulder, crossing his arms while keeping his gaze fixed firmly on mine, “Well your room is fucked up and the last tenant just shambled out from where I caught you staring.  So I don’t think I have to put too much thought into this.”

“Uh,” I tried to stall for a moment as I thought up an interesting lie, “I dropped something out the window, actually.” 

The large fellow cracked his neck twice, the snapping noises absurdly loud as he did so.  He next closed his fist, his fingers cracking loudly as well, “Well, boss wants to see you for a minute about what you ‘dropped out the window’.” 

“Boss?” I asked, pausing, “Er, wait!  I think you think I know more than I know!” I responded.

“I just watched our business’s best customer shambling out the back of a motel like he’s was an extra on *The Walking Dead,”* The big guy informed, “But what’s fuckin’ me up more, is that the last person who rented the same room seems to be looking for the same client I’m after.”

“Client of who?” I asked.

I felt this guy’s meaty hand grab at the back of my neck, my stomach sank.

“You’re about to find out, bub,” the large lug informed.

“Woah, hey!” I shouted as I stumbled forward from the large man, barely breaking free of his grip, “I don’t have anything to do with your boss!.”

The large fellow didn’t react, but just began to advance towards me.

I didn’t take a moment to consider my options, and instead just ran. As I fled, I fished my phone out and turned on the data.  

There was no way that Cassara could have gotten a new phone yet, but at this rate I didn’t really care.  I was running and I was trying to call the cops for help.

I will say this much: Attempting to operate a touch screen phone when you’re being chased by a burly giant, your hands and fingers are numb, and every touch of said fingers causes pain to radiate up your forearm as if you were stabbed, is not a great combination. 

I dropped the phone, and I stumbled, attempting to pick it up while still running.

The rum bottles in my back-pack shifted as I tried to turn, pulling me forwards as I tried to bend down, and sent me to the ground.

I grunted as I dusted myself off, trying to collect myself before I turned to find the large man standing over me.

He reached down and grabbed me, picking me up about a foot off the ground and giving me an angered grunt.

“Looks like you dropped your phone,” he said as he handed me my phone.

“Uh, Thanks?” I answered as I reached out to grab the phone, the bottles clanked against one another in my backpack.

The large fellow, stilling holding me aloft, opened my pack with his free hand, and claimed a bottle.  “Don’t worry, one’s enough for me,” he said as he popped the cork with a single thick thumb, and proceeded to tip the entire contents down his throat as he lowered me back to the ground.

Just when I thought I might be safe, I saw his arm swing towards my shoulder from the corner of my eye.

Everything tunneled after that, and my last thought was: *“Cassara is going to be so pissed off that I lost another bottle.”* 

…

I don’t know how long I was out, but my phone ringing caught my attention as I woke up.

My head spun as I tried to figure out where  I was.  

My hands were tied behind me, and I was sitting down on a chair in a room with a number of incense and candles.

“What the fuck…?” I asked no one in particular.

Standing by the door with his large arms crossed, guarding either me from getting out or someone else getting in, was the large fellow.  “How’s your head?”

I groaned, “Where am I?  Who are you?” I shouted.

“Name’s Reginald, you’re at my bosses place, we’re waiting on the boss,” Reginald said succinctly, “Don’t know why you had run.”

“Boss?  I don’t know your boss,” I paused, “Wait, do I?”

“Nah, you wouldn’t,” Reginald said looking me up and down, “You don’t seem like the sort to be a client of the boss?”

“What do you mean?!” I demanded.

“You seem to be the sort to be at the right place at the wrong, that’s all,” Reginald informed.

“Then why am I here?!” I demanded, struggling against the restraints on my wrists.  The pain I received from merely having anything wrapped around them was intense, and I did my best to ignore it.

That’s when three knocks came on the door.  

“That’s the boss,” Reginald said as he opened the door.

I was expecting a number of kinds of folk to walk through the door.  A well dressed mob boss, a thin gangly fellow with a thin mustache, or heck anyone other than who did walk in.

A 5’2” (152cm) tall woman wearing a rather simple long black dress with a red sash pulling the thing to her narrow waist. She wore high heels, had olive skin and dark brown eyes, and shoulder length dyed blond hair.

In her well manicured fingers was a cigarette in an elongated cigarette holder, “I swear to God Reginald, if this little shit doesn’t confirm the bullshit story you told me it’s your ass.”

“Madam Lydia, I saw him checking out the same spot I saw our client-” Lydia cut Reginald off quickly.

“Hush!  He’s been out cold since you found him while I was on the phone with you, now,” Lydia made a silencing motion with her lips, “Slienco, ci?”

Reginald dropped his head and let out a let sigh before crossing his arms once more and returning to the door.

Lydia sat down in a rather comfy looking chair across from me before she ashed the cigarette and placed the holder into a small ornate cup which held a number of different styles of what I realized now, were also cigarette holders.  

“Let’s get down to business, ey pendejo?” Lydia began, in a mixture of English and Spanish.

“I speak Spanish,” I said with a sneer.

“Good for you, niño!” Lydia said as she clapped slowly, before leaning back in the chair, “My man over there,” she said, motioning her head towards Reginald, “Says he saw something running out of a room that one of my clients visited before he went missing.  Now… Tell me what you saw,” she narrowed her eyes on me, “and don’t you dare lie to me.  I can tell you’re a shit liar.”

“Why does everyone say that?!” I shouted.

“Ey, punta!” Lydia shouted as she snapped her fingers sharply in my face, “Today, yes?  I have other clients to attend to and having you here like this is more heat than I’d prefer to have, yes?”

I groaned, “What the hell kind of clients do you have, lady?” I snapped.

“It’s Lydia,” she boldly corrected, “and if you couldn’t tell: I help facilitate company for lonely gentlemen in hotels, very late at night,” Lydia smiled, “The oldest profession.”

“You’re a pimp?” I asked.

Lydia looked at Reginald, “Reginald if you would?”

Reginald uncrossed his arms and slowly made his way towards me.

When I was standing Reginald was taller than me by a good head, now he is almost twice as tall as me, as sat tied up and helpless.

His huge fist moved towards my face, before stopping suddenly, his middle flicking out and striking my forehead.

“Ow!” I shouted, the sheer force from his finger, though not devastating, was painful.

“I’m a *Madam*, you imbécil,” Lydia growled, “Now, tell me what I want to hear or else I’ll make sure Reginald chops you up into fish-bait.”

I groan, “I don’t know anything about any of your *clientele* okay?!” 

“Room 3434?” Lydia began, “One of my best customers, and a rather well-to-do gentleman, took a night in that room not too long ago.”

I sighed, “Of course…”

“*Not*,” Lydia hissed, “With one of *my* girls.  This little hussy was some bleach blond bimbo that’s been spotted shaking her little ass all over town without my say-so,” Lydia growled, “Normally, I don’t care about competition,” Lydia smiled, her delicate fingers moving to her chest as she puffed it out proudly, “My girls are beyond compare or reproach.  Clean, Skilled, and Gorgeous," she said, “but… My client went missing a couple days ago, and now I have the police asking me questions which I don’t feel like answering.  He was last seen in that ratty motel, and when Reginald came to check it out, somehow, you had checked in.”

“Unless your client was some kind of zombie I don’t think he’s the sort to sleep with women,” I grumbled, recalling the walking corpse who attacked Cassara and I.

Lydia turned to Reginald before turning back to me, “Zombie?  Explain.”

I heaved a sigh, “I was reaching for sheets and stuffed into the closet was a literal corpse.  But it wasn’t dead.  It came to life, tried to suck the life out of me, and then made a break for it after my friend knocked it on its ass.”

Lydia chewed the inside of her lip as she looked me over, “Okay, so Reginald wasn’t blowing smoke up my ass,” she shook her head, “The hell did he get himself into?”  She looked to the far wall for a moment in thought.

“I don’t know, doubt he made any pacts with any voodoo loa, at this rate I’m betting it’s necromancy but after what I’ve seen who knows,” I grumbled, the pain from my restraints getting to me. 

Lydia looked me over, “What the Hell are you, gringo?”

“I’m Honduran,” I growled.

“Hondureño? Huh!” Lydia scoffed, “Spend some more time in the sun, niño.  Didn’t your mami ever tell you it’s good for you?” she shook her head as she reached for another cigarette holder, “I meant: What do you do?”

“I’m a missionary,” I explained.

Lydia paused in the middle of lighting her cigarette, her eyes turning to Reginald, “Untie him.”

“If that’s what you want,” Reginald said as he walked behind me, quickly undoing the restraints.

“Yes It’s what I want!  You think I want to get the wrath of God or something?!  Jesus!” Lydia snapped.

“Him too,” I added.

“Ha Ha, very funny Padre,” Lydia growled.

“Well I’ve seen priests tied up here for,” Reginald quipped, “Why does this one matter?”

“Because they paid good money to get tied up!” Lydia shouted, glaring at the two of us.

My phone rang again, “I should probably get that.  My friend is probably calling.”

“Well, you and your *friend* can work together with Reginald to find my client and remove any suspicion from my girls,” Lydia explained.

“He’s literally dead, er,” I paused, “Undead… I guess? I’m gonna take this,” I said, picking up my phone.

Lydia made a simple motion to me as if giving me permission to proceed. 

“Thanks…” I sigh, as I answer my ringing phone.  It was an unknown number, but said it was from Florida.  I answered, “Cass?”

“Are you hurt?” Cassara asked.

“Bruised, but I’m okay,” I confirmed.

“Did you escape?” Cassara asked again.

“No,” I sighed, “Though I’m *thinking* they might let me go soon?”

“It’s going to be really fucking soon,” Cassara said, hanging up.

I blinked.

Lydia looked at me, her eyebrows raised as if expecting me to elaborate on my conversation.

“My friend wanted to know if you were going to let me go,” I informed.

Lydia looked surprised, “You told her you were here?” she asked.

Without waiting for Lydia or me, Reginald moved to the door to the small office and opened it.  His eyes narrowed as he scanned what seemed to be a club or bar down below.

I could hear music playing and saw strobe lights flashing into the office. 

The music was briefly interrupted by the sound of breaking glass and shouting.

“Your friend seems to know how to make an entrance, it sounds like,” Lydia said as the sound of glass breaking, chairs being thrown, and loud scuffles filled the small room, “Reginald bring him up here.”

Reginald punched his opened hand with one meaty fist and silently moved out of the office and down below, before briefly turning to Lydia to inform her, “Someone’s here, but ain’t a dude.”

“Sorry, what?” Lydia asks.

“Wait here, lock the door, I’ll take care of it,” Reginald said as he left and shut the door behind him. 

“If you don’t want your man to die,” I said as I put my phone away, “You’d better call him off and tell my friend I’m okay.”

Lydia laughed, “What, you friends with *Wonder Woman*?”

I was about to correct her when I paused for a second, “You know what? You’re not that far off.”

“What do you mean, *I’m not that far off?”* Lydia demanded of me.

“Well she grew up in a place where only women live, and they’re all warriors,” I paused, “Though she doesn’t have a lasso or anything.”

Lydia scoffed, “How the fuck would a Missionary like *you* find a place like *that*?”

“I didn’t find anything, she found me,” I sighed, “I was working at a hospital where she stumbled out of the jungle.”

Lydia laughed, “Oh, and that makes her special, Hondureño?” 

“I don’t know, most people don’t survive the Darien Gap alone,” I added.

Lydia’s eyes lit up for a second as she got to her feet, rushing to the door, “Reginald, get the fuck away from her!” she shouted, as she exited the door, “Get back here!”

Through all the smashing and commotion, I could make out Lydia shouting, the music quickly coming to a stop as the violence outside came to a sudden calm.

Lydia’s voice echo from outside the small room, “That bitch is a fuckin’ [Valkyrie](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple/)!”
