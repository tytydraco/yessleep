**Barb Balisha:** Oh, God, I think I want to die. 

**Evan Balisha:** I think we are going to die. I really think we’re going to. *sobs* Who did this? Who would put us into cages? I’m sure these cells are side-by-side just so we can see each other without physical contact. Barb, who did you piss off?

**Barb Balisha:** *crying* I swear, I don’t know what’s going on. Please believe me, Ev. Our anniversary’s in three days. We’ll be out by then, right? The world isn’t cruel enough to deny us that. *crying*

*loud noise*

**Barb Balisha:** Something rolled into my cell! Holy shit, it’s a note wrapped around a knife… and an iron.

**Evan Balisha:** Give me the knife.

**Barb Balisha:** Ev, the note… my God… it says that – that one of us has to toss a finger into that little cup if we want to open the door.

**Evan Balisha:** You should keep the knife.

**Barb Balisha:** He wants us to cut off our fingers!

**Evan Balisha:** I work with my hands, babe. What kind of future would we have if I had no fingers and couldn’t work?

**Barb Balisha:** *screams*


*CHANGE AUDIO TRANSCRIPT*

**Evan Balisha:** Stop shaking, or you’ll never hit the target!

**Barb Balisha:** *vomits* I… just cut off my own finger. I stopped the blood… with a hot iron. Please stop talking. *vomits*

**Evan Balisha:** The note said that the person who cuts off their finger *also* has to be the one to throw it. I can’t help with anything other than advice. Don’t miss this shot. One, two, three! *pause* DAMN IT, BARBARA! THAT WASN’T EVEN CLOSE!

*CHANGE AUDIO TRANSCRIPT*

**Evan Balisha:** You’re getting nearer. Third time’s a charm!

**Barb Balisha:** *slurring* All I feel is hurt. I want to lie down. If you love me, you’ll find a way to stop the pain.

**Evan Balisha:** Babe, you can’t give up now! Think of the baby we’ve been hoping for. The doctors have their doubts, it’s been a struggle, but I have faith in us. But we can only bring that child into the world if you toss that third finger into the cup. I believe in you. I love you.

**Barb Balisha:** *quietly* It hurts more than I thought hurts could be.

**Evan Balisha:** Barb, that doesn’t make any sense. Please keep your focus for this next throw. Ready? One, two – oh *come on* it’s like you’re *trying* to miss at this point.

*CHANGE AUDIO TRANSCRIPT*

**Evan Balisha:** Babe, this is your very last throw. Now that your thumb’s cut off, you have nothing left to use on your other hand. *You have to make this shot.*

**Barb Balisha:** *quietly* Promise that you love me.

**Evan Balisha:** I do love you, babe. With my entire soul. Now be a good girl and toss your thumb into that little cup. 

**Barb Balisha:** …I can’t feel my hand…

**Evan Balisha:** Then the pain shouldn’t distract you. Just remember that everything we want rides on this throw. My promotion, the house in the Arts District, three bedrooms so that we can have two kids – it all depends on this. Your thumb only has one knuckle, so it shouldn’t flop around so much.

**Barb Balisha:** I’m falling asleep…

**Evan Balisha:** BE CAREFUL, THAT – holy shit, babe! You actually made it into the cup! You did it! Look at your thumb hanging over the edge, that was a perfect – wait, something just rolled into my cell. *shuffling noise* It’s another note, with something that looks like a remote control. The note says that I can only open one of the doors and – oh, shit. 

**Barb Balisha:** Are… you going to save us?

**Evan Balisha:** It looks like I can only save one of us.

**Barb Balisha:** What? How?

**Evan Balisha:** There are two buttons on this remote. One opens your door, and one covers mine. This note – it says I have to choose one to open, and one to stay shut.

**Barb Balisha:** *slurring* You were always… my knight… shining armor. Save me?

**Evan Balisha:** Oh, no. It says the cell that gets left behind will be turned into an oven.

**Barb Balisha:** *quietly* I love you.

**Evan Balisha:** I know. I’m so sorry, Barb. You know that you’re my one and only. *clicking noise* But you’ve lost so much blood that it just doesn’t make sense to sacrifice me – I’m still healthy. Barb – you *know* I love you, right?

**Barb Balisha:** Wait. 

**Evan Balisha:** I can’t do this, I can’t wait around and watch – I have to go. I promise that I love you. I’m so sorry. *running noises*

**Barb Balisha:** Wait. Evan – I’m pregnant.

**Elm Grove Police Department**

**Evidence Item No.** 022520231913

**Incident Type:** Double homicide

**Coroner’s Conclusion:** Barbara Balisha (34 years old) was found dead in a makeshift cage. The rudimentary structure was able to generate a maximum temperature of 250 degrees, resulting in a gradual death from hyperthermia. Best estimates suggest that death took 15-20 hours from the onset of heat to occur. 

All five fingers on Barbara Balisha’s right hand had been recently severed. The wounds had been cauterized poorly, but the procedure was sufficient enough to prevent a level of blood loss that might have rendered unconsciousness. 

The destruction of all 32 teeth was apparently self-inflicted. Scratch marks indicate that, in desperation, Barbara Balisha attempted to chew through the metal bars in her desire to escape the pain generated by the makeshift oven. 

Her attempts to escape were unsuccessful.

Barbara Belisha was three months pregnant at the time of her death.

**Notes:** Evan Belisha (34 years old) led Elm Grove Police to the warehouse where he and his wife had been held in cages. The scene was found to be as he described it, including Barbara’s fingers in and around a cup ten feet from the cage where she died. 

The perpetrator, presumed to be the same person involved in a series of extreme Elm Grove crimes, remains unknown. 

The Elm Grove Police Department has no suspects. 

Upon seeing his dead wife, Evan Belisha apprehended an EGPD officer’s service weapon and aimed it at his own head. 

The bullet resulted in a lower brain injury. Evan Belisha remains paralyzed in all four limbs, but is still conscious. Since the incident, he has been less cooperative with EGPD. In lieu of a dialogue, he has chosen to repeat the same information ad infinitum, sharing the same phrase over and over:

“He didn’t want to kill us. He wanted us to beg for a death we couldn’t have. He won, we lost.”
