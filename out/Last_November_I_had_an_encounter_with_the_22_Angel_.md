*Well, it's time to head on home now,* I thought, grabbing my purchases in the check out. I was on my way out the grocery store. *The sun is still up, so I've got some time. I can be home before it's night time.*

It was a late November evening. Winter was right around the corner, and with it carried the cold. With the cold came the night, and those nights grew longer and darker. By that time, lampposts lit up the small town, with some folks huddled in a well-known fast-food joint. Others, stuck in their vehicles, glared at the traffic light. They waited for that light to go from red to green, so they could be home and be done with it all. 

I stood near the traffic light, as the cars zoomed off to be elsewhere. Standing at the pedestrian crossing, I watched and appreciated the sunset and its many hues. The magenta-shaded clouds. I believe there's a God out there, and He must have thought the sunset was one of His favourite designs. *It's so beautiful,* I considered, smiling at the sight.

I waited at the traffic light with groceries in her scruffy backpack. I remember that mom had run out of her low-priced, wholewheat bread and margarine, and I had volunteered to get some more. But in truth, I used that as an excuse to buy cookies for me and me only. The vehicles slowed down as the traffic lights turned yellow - then red. The walker sign blinked the same green light, and I crossed the road, passing by other people.

The sun was now gone; the vibrant horizon grew weaker; the sky was all shades of blue. At the other traffic light was a bus stop; a couple of passengers waited for the assigned bus to show up. Earlier, I had taken the unconventional route to get to the supermarket. Walking through the meadow, across the bridge, and down the canal behind the fast-food restaurant. I did so to buy some time so that when I got home, mom would be fast asleep, and Reece, my older brother, would be God knows where.

Standing in front of the foodie establishment, explored my patched-up pocket to see if I had all my belongings. My purse? Check. My cards? Check. My house-keys? ...nothing? I searched my other pocket. Still nothing. I then checked everywhere; from my backpack to even the crevices of my pockets. On the brink of losing my cool, a thought popped into my head. That I might have dropped the keys in between the aisles while distracted. Cursing myself under my breath, I marched back to the store. 

I briskly walked where I remembered going through: the MRE aisle, the stationery aisle, and the bakery aisle. Making sure to inspect every nook and cranny. I searched far and wide; even lying down, checking down the aisles when no one was looking. They weren't there. They weren't anywhere to be seen, and I could not comprehend why or how. How could they have gotten lost? Was I really that clumsy?

There was a large grouping of windows at the front of the supermarket, and when I turned, I saw what I had been concerned about. Darkness. The night had arrived, taking the sky and covering the land. "Shit," I murmured. I considered taking the bus home, but I guessed it wouldn't arrive in the next half an hour - and I'm not one to wait that long. With no choice and an exasperated moan, I opted for the same route I took to get to the grocery store. 

*I've got to find those damn keys, otherwise I'm so, so, fucked,* I thought stubbornly, as I proceeded to walk home at night. I was an idiot, and it almost came at the cost of my life.

I went walking down the canal at night. I did not know what time it was, but I estimated it was somewhere around 6:00 pm. The cold nibbled at my ears, my nose, the tips of my nails. The premature night so dark, I barely saw the ground before me. I started kicking the dried leaves and frail twigs. In search of the keys, I kicked at anything that would produce a subtle clang, and kept doing so to no avail. So, I gave up finding them.

"Fuck this," I said. "I'll go find those stupid keys tomorrow. No escaping mom's mind-numbing lecture."

But to lighten the mood, I thought of happy thoughts. Sam recommended I'd listen to a song called Obstacles by some guy called Syd Matters. It's a good song I'll admit. He's serenading her a little. Sam told me it reminded him of me. I never knew what to make of that at the time, but the thought made me grateful to have friends like him. So, I hummed to the chorus and wouldn't stop until she reached the bridge.

*How did it go again? Something about playing hide & seek in waterfalls? Probably. We were young... or something like that.*

Now, the bridge had been under construction for three years - well four years, since the idea was brought to life two months before lockdown. It was lit up on its own; emitting a kaleidoscope of colours. These blue and green and purple apparitions lit up the night. The bridge itself was said to be steady, but I don't believe that. I've walked across this bridge a couple of times before and I swear I could hear the creeks of the anchors. Then, I stared down the motionless river and instinctively clutched I purse. A thought popped into I mind, something about drowning in it, and I immediately dismissed it. 

Behind the main format of the bridge was a hill and a meadow. It was first intended to be a secluded golf course, though that got scrapped who knows how long ago. A miniature construction site was next to the peak of the hill. There was a shortcut which was closed off by the site; a beaten, old path through the woods that led to the hill. It was a good thing back then. A very good thing. Instead, I took the gates. I had to walk through a neighbourhood she never knew the name of to do that. It was most likely the easiest thing I did that time. I reached the corroded gates.

The canal had been too dark to see, but here, the meadow was practically pitch black. So dark, the abyss itself looked tangible. I questioned if I had to do this; I had never completely gotten over my fear of the dark. Mustering up what was left of my courage, I knew this was the only way back home. *There was no turning back from here, Rachael.* And so, I opened the gates, which let out a squeaky, metallic shriek, and headed into the field.

The sky was a black canvas with a hint of bloody red. It and earth fused to a nightmarish hellscape, and all the earthy colours the meadow had were vacuumed in the endless void. And the pale moon was set on high and at its fullest, and it had a haunting beauty that I could not ignore. I watched it hung in the night sky bold and lurid. No shining star to compete against, nor heavenly body to outshine. Only it.

I stood on a rocky path, and surrounding me were shadows of trees and bushes contorting silently. As I began to trudge into the open land, I saw the large object in awe. It was bright, intimidating. I felt like a shrew being stalked by a great horned owl. I continued staring at it when I noticed something. A fuzzy ring that circled it. I recognised it as the *22° Halo,* or at least that is what Sam told me about a few nights before.

*'I was messing around in my backyard when I saw the damn thing,'* I remembered him explaining. *'I could barely see it, but it was there. It looked a little unnatural. Uncanny, but kinda beautiful.'*

*'Sounds creepy, yet interesting,'* I responded. *'What is it called?'*

*'Some people call it the 22° Halo, because it looks like a ring angels have round their heads. Others call it a moon dog, but I like the former more.'*

*'Hmm, this sounds fascinating, I'll say. You think I should check it out sometime?'*

*'I reckon you should,'* Sam encouraged. *'Although it's not a for-sure occurrence. So, keep that in mind whenever you take a stroll at night.'* I had seen throughout my teen years countless sunrises and sunsets, witnessed shooting stars and galaxies and the occasional solar eclipse. At that very moment, all those experiences paled in comparison. The 22° Halo was something of a spectacle. But for some reason, I felt unnerved just looking at it.

As I kept glancing at the atmospheric phenomenon, I crept through the tall grasses. I squinted at the vague shape of a bush about 20 yards away. Every step I took made these damp, muddy squishes. Some let out a loud crunch; ice had taken form in the soil. Muddy water entered through her inner soles. My socks were soaked, but I did not mind at that moment. 

By then, I had reached the bush, and next to it were little pockets of white flowers. Here laid a beaten path that someone had made not too long ago. Ahead was a patch of dry grass and seed stalks that resembled wheat, and a tump where I could better see part of the neighbourhood I lived in. I had about to advance until I came to a halt. 

Looking back, I saw the huge trees swaying in the breeze. I sensed something, a gut feeling. I resumed my journey, but could not help looking over my shoulder. Part of me was convinced something (or someone) was out there. But on the other hand, it might be the anxiety taking its toll on me. I couldn't tell the difference, and that worried me even more. 

I arrived at the patch and walked up the tump, and I saw the glittering lights around the neighbourhood. Feeling a little less tense, I looked over my shoulder and stared out at the field once again. I couldn't see much, so I squinted whilst leaning forward a little. Then I saw it. Something near the pine trees at the far end. It stood out from the background as this bloodless, white speck. Whatever it was, it remained in one spot just standing still. I blinked a couple of times, further narrowing my eyes. And as I peered to that side of the meadow once more, I couldn't spot it anymore. It wasn't there. Though the figure was so vague that I wondered if it was ever there. It might have been a trick of the mind. Either way, I did not risk finding out; thus, I picked up speed. 

I believed I was hallucinating; all the spooky stories were getting to I head, and I reckoned they're making me see things. However, I noticed my clammy hands trembled in the quiet, frigid air. I glanced back and forth, squinting over the meadow just to see that white spot. At times, I would see familiar speckle appear a bit closer than the last. I wore a cross necklace I jokingly used as a gimmicky crucifix; whilst clinging onto it, I recited in my heart scriptures of protection. As I repeated the verses verbatim, I felt at ease at that moment. Still, that doubt lingered, and I could not extinguish it, no matter how many times I murmured, 'The Lord is my shepherd.'

Muttering prayers, I descended the tump, briskly striding through the path. I would arrive at a slope alongside a leafless thicket. The naked trees swayed in the rush of wind like a spirit-driven folk dance. There, I could make out the outline of a rusty fence and a couple outworn duplexes beyond that. Letting out an exhale of relief, I cautiously came down the slippery incline. As I got halfway down the incline, I heard some rattling in the woods. Steps... lots of them. I froze, not moving an inch. My arms were like gooseflesh. My hearing heightened, and with it I heard various things around her. The leaves. The whistle of the wind. Other than that, nothing happened for a while. 

*Maybe it's one of those deer passing by,* I reckoned. Probably not. I did not know, but then I heard something else. A swift blow behind me until everything settled and complete silence took over. Then came a feeling of something behind me. I did not want to, but I hesitantly looked behind. Before I could do so, I suddenly felt a strong strike on the small of my back. 

Knocked out of balance, I went tumbling down the soiled slope, landing on a bed of dry grass and twigs. Upon landing, I bashed my head on something hard, rendering me momentarily dazed. It was not long before I had gotten my bearings and saw my bag destroyed, spewing out a few slices of bread in a newly ripped hole. I noticed something running down me cheek, and when I inspected it, it smelled like iron with a bit of earth. Then I heard it again; some wet footsteps that sounded like it was coming at me fast. 

"Nope!", I shouted in an alert tone, gathering my things quickly in the mud-caked backpack. 

I arose when I felt a lightning bolt of pain in my left ankle. I tried bearing weight on it, but the pain was too unbearable. Like a stray, rabid dog gnawing at my ankle to the bone. As I clutched my bag, I hobbled to the path that led me home. There was another steep rise closer to the canal, and further to an opening of a dead end. But with that in mind, I was in so much agony.

Resuming my excruciating hike, the wind picked up, blowing at me and causing the streaming liquid to get in my eye. The current was so strong, it made me fall on my ass. Moaning and whimpering, I lied on the mud. It started again; more of the same sounds. They surrounded me. Thunderous footsteps in the mud. Movement within the woods. Something flew by faster than my eyes could see. 

The moon was in my view, and it had an eerie shine. The white sphere contrasting with the inky sky looked hypnotic. And that pale ring - that halo, suddenly became two. Then four, and half a dozen, and many more. Rings within rings that grew brighter, circling the moon like an illusion spiral. A beautiful, yet menacing sight to behold. In all the trepidation I felt, I sensed my consciousness slipping away while looking at the halos. I felt like I was being put to sleep, though not in a relaxing way. As I was about to lose grip of my consciousness, a loud beep from a car snapped me out of the trance.

As soon as I got back up again, the current picked up once more. In excruciating pain, I continued my perilous journey, despite the wind working against me. I limped. My damaged ankle buckled under my weight. I limped. The wind blew at me as though it itself had a mind of its own. Like a primordial god of the element heaving me with its heavy, invisible hands.

"Fuck," I hissed under my voice as I felt that sharp pain at the side of my foot. I  had my muddy feet stuck firm to the earth as though anchoring them.

Atop the incline, I heard something moving towards me. The wind had stopped then, and I seized that opportunity to get on top of the slope. I knew that whatever was pursuing me wasn't going to stop. So, I staggered through the rocky path, wincing. There was a florescent lamppost at the end of the stony path; it was said to be the oldest lamppost in the neighbourhood. Salvation was a couple steps away. I was so close, but my useless, fucking leg kept dragging my behind. Every step I took, I teared up. I felt the agony. That doom drawing near. That dread.

*I'm gonna die,* I told myself. *I'm gonna die!*

I moved as quickly as my limp could let me. I winced over the pain but knew if I stopped, I would face a fate worse than that. Clarity came into my mind; I was near the asphalt dead end. The lamppost visible from where I was at. Just one more step. Just one more...

It wasn't long until I found herself out the pathway. I made it. Reaching heaven in the form of a bygone lamppost. As I shambled to the checkpoint, I dropped beneath the ancient light, sitting up against the wooden barricade. I checked for my belongings for the final time, with my wallet intact and most of the wholewheat bread in place.

I gathered all my things when I heard leaves rattling from the darkness of the path. Something caught the soft glow of the lamppost. I acknowledged it quickly and froze. I saw what looked like eyes staring back at me with no expression, but the longer I stared, I noticed they were lights. Fiery, white lights that grew in brightness.

Then out the darkness protruded two floating strands of pure white linen slowly outstretched like murderous hands. They were long; stretching about 16 meters and more. But then came more of the slender wraps, worming their way to me. And more came, possibly in the hundreds I guessed. So many, all I saw was white. They were so close to each other; they looked like one massive fabric covering part of the sky and land.

"What the fuck?", I murmured as I desperately tried to crawl away. However, to my surprise, none of them came close to my. Whenever they proceeded to, they seemed to flinch like something was blocking them.

Then all the strands retracted swiftly and I saw it. The thing hovering over the uncut, wet grass. It was dressed in all white; its body was a long, linen fabric that draped from whatever it hung to. Its head was a large bovine skull with two large eye sockets, and in them were blinding orbs resembling eyes. I saw those elongated strands pull in back to its bottom. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen or heard of. Any form of comprehension I had seeped through my mind as I cowered before the living nightmare. Terror was written on my face; my breath grew shallow and discomposed. 

The fiend towered over the path, eclipsing the moon. It creepily bent over and scrutinized me, sending trepidation down my soul. It was then I saw a circular beam around its horns. A halo, matching perfectly with the moon. A terrible thought occurred to my of what this all meant. Hesitant as I was, I dared to speak to it. I rose up my cross necklace in defence, and proposed the question.

"Are you... are you an angel?" 

The fiend never spoke. It never let out a groan or some abominable shriek. I inched backward a little more, only noticing it was not pursuing me anymore. I never knew as to why it didn't, perhaps I never will. 

Then the fiend descended gracefully, and as it kept its glower on me, it retreated to the field - or whatever hell it came out of. Its halo dimmed slowly and did so until I could not make out the simple shape of it. The eyes were still there, watching me even when it submerged into the darkness. And before I knew it, it was gone. I found it nearly impossible to believe that I was left alive. After all the torment I went through, I got to live to see another day. 

Without hesitation, I got her things and dashed away from the place. I shambled, shrugging off the twinge. Home was around the corner; I thought I could check how bad my ankle was then. But now, I needed to get the fuck away from whatever monstrosity I saw. It wasn't until I reached halfway that I felt worn out. Fighting the urge not to falter, I staggered until my knees tightened like rusted door hinges. I made it to the stairs, tripping over a few steps, but managing. And in no time, I arrived in the comfort of my doorstep. From there, I rang the bell and did not stop until I heard a familiar, baritone voice. 

"I'm coming goddamnit!" I stood on one leg, waiting for the door to be unlocked. A few seconds passed and it did, revealing a stout man with a vexed look in his strained, veiny eyes. His hoodie reeked of long nights with cigarettes and energy drinks; he was holding an opened Red Bull. This was Reece, and despite the many feuds we had, I could not have been gladder to see his grumpy face. 

Reece saw how much of a mess I was, eyeing my up and down. "You look like you went mud wrestling with Kurt Angle," he commented jokingly. "Did you have fun?" 

I scowled at him, waiting to get inside. "Yes actually. I *did* have fun getting ankle locked in mud." 

"Right. Seriously though, what happened to you?" 

"I tripped." 

"You... tripped?" Reece questioned, looking unconvinced. 

"Yes, Reece, I tripped. I tripped and I fell and got muddied up." 

"Well, that's one long fall you had." 

"...yeah." I could not tell him what happened, as I feared I would sound insane. But all he did was raise an eyebrow. "Just let me in, alright?!" 

"Fine!" Reece opened the door wider and helped me with my belongings. As he locked the door, I inspected my ankle and felt it had swollen a lot. "I don't wanna know," he said. "I don't even wanna know what you got up to at this time."

"Fine; it's not like you want to know. Where's mom?", I asked, wincing when I twisted my bad ankle by accident. 

"In bed," he gave a short answer. He was gone for a little while and came back. "Rachael!" 

I looked up at Reece as he approached me. He tossed a cold can of soda at me; I caught it with little effort. I set it aside and began to untie my soaked shoes and tossed my socks to the side. It was swollen, and some discolouration ran down the outside of my left foot. 

"And before you say anything; no, I won't tell mom you came home late," Reece thought to clarify. I nodded in appreciation. 

"Wait, what about my foot?"

"Just tell her you fell or something, I don't know. Tell her it was a big fall. I'll get the bath ready. You're gonna need it... you know... because you look like shit - literally." 

"Thanks a lot... muppet," I replied. 

"You're welcome, ya muppet," he said. With that, he left and I limped down the corridor, disgruntled after her treacherous journey. There, I heard mom snoring and the TV playing. A marathon of some American televangelist teaching sermons and prayers. Standing there in pain, I heard the geyser turned on, as well as a rush of water in a bath.

"Make sure to use that bath soak I like," I advised Reece.

"I know."

"And don't make it too hot!"

"I **know,** Rachael."

The fear within me calmed. I took in a few, deep breaths, and had some clarity. I was safe. Everyone was safe. Suddenly I remembered the house keys I had 'lost.' I turned back and glanced at a hanger on the wall. It was then I realised I nearly got myself killed for nothing. 

I never lost the keys. Never even had them to begin with as a matter of fact. I must have thought all along that I had them when they were hanging on the wall the whole time. I believed if it had not been for my forgetfulness, I would have gotten home safe and sound. It did not matter anymore. I still live. Though I live now with a haunted memory of a fiend that lurks in the woods. I will never forget the night she stumbled across the *22° Angel.*
