I'm a no-named painter. I've been doing it for a couple of years after picking it up as a hobby. Mainly after uni or on the weekends but even after all this time I kinda suck at it. Yeah I've gotten one or two of my paintings featured on café walls, the occasional indie art shop, but it comes with *huge* commissions from the places that whatever money I make for it—ends up paying for the fee to even have it hang up there in the first place.



My sister kept bugging me for this one painting of her and her girlfriend, surrounded by a lush forest with them holding hands—honestly it was a cute request. Especially with it being a gift for her girlfriend's birthday that's coming up.



I agreed to paint it for her (and she said she’d pay for it too), but no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't get the composition *right*. Or the colours didn't fit either. Too muted, or too bright. Everytime I got home from classes or woke up at noon on Saturdays I'd dread to walk into my little home studio.



I felt like Goldilocks.



One day in frustration as I was mixing paint for my current attempt, the outline and backwash already splashed on the canvas, I just ended up throwing the brush in my hand at the wall.



My body stiffened, arm locked in place, my gaze fixed swiftly to the floor. Fuck. I just broke my most expensive paintbrush in two.



It was just an object, sure. But it took me ages to save up for it. I huddled over with my eyes all glassy, the smooth wooden handle now jagged and dug into my fingers as I accidentally nicked them picking up the shattered pieces.



A bead of blood lingered on the wood as I dropped the sad broken paintbrush in the bin.



Great.



I'd have to buy a new one, I thought; wrapping my index finger up in a bandaid.



I called my sister at that point to let her know I'd have to delay her gift another week. Her voice cracked and sighed into the receiver, "Fine. I get that art takes time, but jeezus Cass can you try to finish it quicker?"



I muttered a sorry, and her breath hitched in worry, "Ah it's okay. I'm just stressed at work recently, honestly it's my fault for taking it out on you. Take all the time you need, but yeah, I would appreciate it done soon though," she chuckled lightheartedly but I could tell it was tinged with something else, "Love you sis, I'll chat later," she quickly hung up after that.



I held my cellphone numbly in my palm. Felt tears wet my cheeks. It tasted salty on my tongue as it rolled past my lips.

My alarm blares in my ears as I hastily flick at my phone to turn it off. After I broke my paintbrush the other day, I managed to scrounge together the one day in the week where I finally have minimal homework and lectures I could watch later so that I could go to the art store near my house.



It's only open right smack-dab in the middle of the day, on one day of the week, and only for an hour on a Tuesday. I always think it's odd whenever I push through the door, the ring of a tiny crystal clear bell above my head to signal someone is in, or heading out.



Today is no different that it crosses my mind. But, it's close to my house and everything is cheap here so I push the weird timing out as the smell of wood, metal, and paint chemicals waft my nose. My happy place.



The lady at the front counter turns from the various wooden drawers, shutting the two closest with a thump. Dust swirling as she faces me with a warm smile.



"Hey there, it's been a while since I last saw you!" She says gleefully. She has her red and black coloured fountain pen deftly between her fingers, her thin light frame leaning over the counter as she talks.



"Ah yeah, it's been a while Jane. I've been kind of busy with uni lately," I reply, adding quickly, "but my favourite brush broke recently so I'm needing a replacement." I'm wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans, it's covered in patches of colourful paints. Oil paints, acrylic, some are faded watercolour blots too. My hands bury into my pockets with my palms and fingers damp with sweat.



She taps her pen against the counter, striking the book that her elbows sit behind as she stares in pity. Jane looks at me apologetic for a moment, before earnestly turning back to the drawers like she was before I came in.



The floorboards creak as I maneuver towards her. Passing some paints and easels of various sizes. Jane then slides a little rectangular box towards me once I reach her.



"The owner said to me you might want this then, well not exactly you specifically… Ah, either way, he's been saving it for a dedicated painter such as yourself, is more so what he meant. Told me to give it to someone I like and you and I’ve been friends for a while now," she finishes. Her bony fingers retreating and leaving the box sitting still in front of me.



I glance at the ornate box, it's carefully crafted red mahogany wood, whomever made it clearly knew and was deft with a practised hand. It looks magnificent, if not a little worn.



Before I can think my hand brushes the top of it and I just utter, "How much?", to her so fast I forgot about my bank account being low.



Jane just replies, "It's free. The owner said not to worry," I give her a hesitant look, "Really. If you're that worried I'll ask him later about it. Just take it for now and if you don't like it, bring it back next week when we're open," she says chuckling at my dumbfounded face.



I shrug and just go what the heck, a few moments later the bell chimes again–Jane locking the door with a click soon after I get a metre or two away from the store. I glance around to watch her flip the open sign to closed, catching her smile and wave at me before retreating from the window.

It's been a couple of days since I got the paintbrush, university has been kicking my arse with assignments and I’m only just now able to crack open the expensive-looking-but-somehow-free mahogany box. It’s a Friday and not only has my day ended well with getting positive feedback on my most recent essay, I’m also now able to do some painting!



My inky hair wisps about as I reach around the easel to grab at it, feeling heavy and solid in my palm and I hold my breath unexpectedly–opening it to find a *gorgeous* brush inside. It looks perfect, brand-new, and the brussels sit still. Waiting to be used.



I pick it up and exclaim in wonder at how nice it feels. Literally. My mind and body just itches to get started and I look up to the easel again.



It looks wrong. *Really really* wrong. For the first time in ages I just feel like I know *why*–it hits me like a shock of electricity all of a sudden and I feel my lungs expand in my chest as I look over what I’ve done so far, the impasto highlights the wrong details; trees overshadow my sister and her girlfriend too much; the layers are all jumbled and the colours themselves just aren’t the right hue; it doesn’t look good at all.



No wonder I haven’t been able to finish it, I’ll have to start all over!



Hurriedly and zealously I placed down on the floor to lean against my earlier attempts–with this current one taking over a week to get to this point, but I don’t care. I just want to get to a fresh clean canvas as fast I can. My fingers start to itch.



My phone starts ringing soon after I position the new canvas just so, my sister’s name crosses past as I barely register it–right after fading to darkness. I don’t stop to call her back, I don’t even stop to consider why she’s called, the only thing that matters right now is this painting. This idea that I can’t get out of my head. I swiftly prepare the gesso, swiping it across with my new brush in thin and even strokes, making a second pass when the first layer dries, and sanding it once the final layer is dried until it’s just right.



Usually it takes me a bit of time to even apply the gesso but today I’ve done it so easily I step back in excitement. My nerves are glowing with a fever that I haven’t felt since I was younger as I turn quickly to my oil paints. I know what I need to do and the style too, a mix of alla prima and glazing techniques will *definitely* bring this painting to where it needs to be.



I grin wide as I drag my stool to sit comfortably and get to work with the colours I want to use. The new paintbrush pristinely awaits to dip and glide in a dance of passion.

My limbs feel so heavy. Lifting my head up takes some effort to find out I’ve been lying on my desk all night. I flicker over to the painting to my left to see utter perfection. Working through the night into the next day has taken a toll on me though, but to see the painting in its current state leaves me breathless in a different way than the pressure on my ribs from the position I slept in last night.



I can’t stop staring at it–I wish I could work on it more yet my body begs me to eat. It’s already midday and I haven’t eaten since I fell asleep.



So I head to the kitchen for a quick sandwich and head back to the studio. In-between bites I keep thinking on what I need to do next, not even noticing the sandwich is gone and I’m already back to work on it. Beaming in pride and excitement thrums through me, musing on how pleased my sister will be.



Only stopping for the layers to dry between sessions, I bring the forest to life. Swirling bugs, shining leaves–my sister and her girlfriend idyllically framed against the backdrop of a lively scene. I form the painting exactly in the way I thought when I first got asked the request, and I feel so *alive*. So *very alive*.



I don't stop to notice even when the day changes to night.

I don’t feel like that the next day, or the day after either–I finish the painting Monday morning with a shudder the moment I put down the brush. Exhaustion washes over me and I crash sideways right to the floor. I fall in a heap and a grunt, the paintbrush clutters next to me and I find myself wrapping my fingers around it.



It just feels better *almost instantly* that I feel the handle. Blinking clear and the pain succeeding I studied the brush again since I’ve used it. The thing that struck me then was how even after days of painting the brussels look *new*. Like I haven’t just painted for days on end. How’s that possible?



I slowly shift myself to sit cross-legged on the floor of my studio. Placing the brush down in front of me, and the moment I let go I feel incredibly unwell. Almost like I’ve had a bad cold–the brain fog catching me off-guard completely.



Guess I just haven’t realised I caught something, and yeah I guess it makes sense I fell to the ground like that earlier when I’m so tired and sick. I pick the brush back up and with a surge of energy I stand, place the brush back in its box (it was clean, somehow, I don’t know why) and I instantly am reminded how ill I feel again. I lock my gaze back to the brush and the painting and groan, desire to paint something new as I regard the finished commission washes through me.



Yet my wiser mind wins over as I stumble through my house to my room. My bed feels soft and smells great, while I’m sinking into the mattress clutching my stomach as I cough.



All I want to do is paint again. I don’t think university matters as much to me right now.



I feel heavy as my eyelids shut tight.



I just want to paint something new now.
