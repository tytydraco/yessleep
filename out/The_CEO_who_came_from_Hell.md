I work in HR at a mid-sized tech company in downtown Seattle. Three months ago, we got a new CEO, and I need to tell someone what I've witnessed. I can't sleep anymore. Every time I close my eyes, I see his glowing red pupils reflecting the Netflix loading screen.

Mr. Damien Infernus arrived on a Tuesday morning in November. The moment he walked through our glass doors, the temperature in the building dropped ten degrees. Everyone assumed it was the heating system acting up again, but I noticed something else – the fluorescent lights flickered whenever he passed underneath them, and every computer screen briefly displayed static.

Our first meeting was supposed to be about the quarterly HR review. I'd prepared a comprehensive presentation covering employee satisfaction surveys, salary adjustments, benefits packages, and retention strategies. Standard stuff. I was nervous but ready.

Mr. Infernus sat across from me in the conference room, his impossibly tall frame draped in a suit that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. His eyes were the color of charcoal, and when he smiled, I swear I caught a glimpse of teeth that were just a little too sharp.

"So," he said, his voice carrying an odd echo despite the room's acoustics, "tell me about your... plans."

I launched into my presentation, clicking through slides about compensation analysis and market rates. I was maybe five minutes in when I noticed he wasn't looking at the screen. He was staring out the window with an expression of profound boredom, his fingers drumming against the table in a rhythm that sounded suspiciously like screaming.

"The salary recommendations," I continued, pointing to a detailed chart showing proposed increases across departments, "take into account cost of living adjustments and—"

He held up one pale hand. His fingernails were black and unnaturally long.

"Just give them the highest," he said, not even glancing at my carefully prepared data. "Whatever number is biggest on your little chart there. Everyone gets that."

I blinked. "Sir, that would mean entry-level employees would earn the same as senior management. The budget implications alone—"

"Done." He waved dismissively, and I swear the air around his hand shimmered with heat. "What else?"

I tried to continue with the benefits discussion, but he'd already lost interest. His head tilted slightly, like he was listening to something I couldn't hear. Then his eyes lit up – literally lit up with a dull red glow.

"This office," he said suddenly, "where's the entertainment system?"

"We... don't really have one. There's a small TV in the break room for employee lunch hours—"

"No, no, no." He stood abruptly, and the conference room windows rattled slightly. "I need a proper screen. At least 200 inches. Maybe 250. Can your break room accommodate that?"

"I don't think a screen that size would fit—"

"Make it fit." His smile revealed those too-sharp teeth again. "And I want Netflix. Default account, premium subscription. And Crunchyroll – I have some catching up to do on the latest season of several shows. Oh, and attach a PS5. The good one, not whatever budget console you people probably think is adequate."

I was scribbling notes, trying to keep up. "Sir, a 200-inch television would cost—"

"I don't care about the cost." He leaned forward, and the smell of sulfur wafted across the table. "But here's what I do care about: I want you to check the Netflix account every month. Every single month. Generate a report of what's been watched, when it was watched, and for how long."

"You want... viewing statistics?"

"Comprehensive viewing statistics." His eyes were definitely glowing now, casting red shadows on the wall behind him. "I need to know that my investment is being properly utilized. If that screen isn't getting adequate use, there will be... consequences."

The way he said "consequences" made my blood turn to ice water.

That was three months ago. The installation took two weeks – we had to knock down a wall between the break room and the adjacent storage closet to accommodate the massive screen. The thing is so large it's visible from the parking lot through the windows. The installation crew kept complaining about equipment malfunctions and unexplained electrical surges, but they got it done.

And I've been generating those monthly reports ever since.

Here's the thing that keeps me awake at night: according to the Netflix viewing data, someone is watching content on that screen every single night from midnight to 6 AM. Every night. Without fail.

The viewing history is... strange. Lot of foreign horror films, documentaries about historical disasters, and an unusual number of cooking shows – specifically ones about flame-grilling and barbecue techniques. Oh, and anime. So much anime. Particularly series involving demons, underworld mythology, and shows where the protagonist has to manage some sort of supernatural organization.

But here's what really terrifies me: our building's security system shows that nobody enters or leaves the office during those nighttime viewing sessions. The doors remain locked, the alarm system stays armed, and the security cameras show empty hallways. Yet something is definitely watching that screen for six hours every night.

I've tried staying late to investigate, but every time I approach the break room after sunset, the temperature drops so dramatically that my breath fogs. Last week, I worked up the courage to peek around the corner at 1 AM. The massive screen was on, casting an eerie blue glow throughout the space, and I could hear the faint sound of dialogue – something in Japanese with subtitles.

But there was no one there. No one visible, anyway.

The worst part? Mr. Infernus always seems pleased with my monthly reports. He reads them with genuine interest, nodding approvingly at the high usage statistics. Sometimes he makes comments like "Ah, I see someone has excellent taste in psychological thrillers" or "Good, good, they're finally catching up on the classics."

Two weeks after implementing the salary changes, I accidentally overheard a heated phone call between Mr. Infernus and the Board of Directors. I was delivering quarterly reports to his office when I heard raised voices through his door – well, one raised voice. The board member on speakerphone was practically shouting.

"Damien, what the hell were you thinking? Entry-level programmers making $200K? Customer service reps earning executive salaries? The labor costs have tripled overnight!"

That's when Mr. Infernus's voice changed. The temperature in the entire building – no, it felt like all of downtown Seattle – dropped twenty degrees in an instant. When he spoke, his words came out like shards of ice, each syllable crackling with something that made my spine feel like it was freezing from the inside out.

"I have my ways," he said, and the way he pronounced 'ways' made it sound like he was discussing implements of torture. "Profits will be higher than ever, regardless of salary expenses. I promise you that."

"But how can you possibly—"

"I said I have my ways." The cold in his voice was so intense I could see my breath fogging in the hallway. "Trust the process. You'll see the results in the quarterly reports."

There was silence on the phone. Then, in a much smaller voice, the board member said, "Of course, sir. We trust your judgment."

After he hung up, I heard him chuckle – a sound like ice cracking on a frozen lake.

The terrifying thing is, he was right. Despite the massive salary increases, our company profits have soared by 300% over the past three months. Our clients are signing contracts faster than ever, often for amounts that seem too good to be true. Competing companies in our sector keep mysteriously losing major deals to us, and I've heard rumors that several of our rivals have been experiencing unusual equipment failures and staff shortages.

I don't ask questions about our sudden success. I just process the paperwork and try not to think about why our new clients always look slightly dazed when they leave contract meetings, or why they sometimes have small, perfectly circular burn marks on their palms.

On the bright side, the massive TV has become the heart of our office culture during the day. During lunch breaks, you'll find clusters of employees gathered around that enormous screen, sharing meals while watching everything from comedy specials to nature documentaries. The programming department discovered a shared love of anime and hosts weekly viewing parties, complete with homemade snacks and heated discussions about plot theories. Marketing and Sales bonded over a month-long tournament on the PS5, and even our normally antisocial IT team has started joining the group for Marvel movie marathons. There's something genuinely heartwarming about seeing Sarah from Accounting explain the intricacies of "Attack on Titan" to Bob from Finance, or watching our interns teach the senior developers how to play the latest games. The camaraderie is real, the laughter is infectious, and for those daylight hours, our break room feels like the coziest living room you could imagine.

Yesterday, he asked me to expand the subscription services. "Add Hulu," he said, "and maybe that new horror streaming platform – Shudder, I think it's called. I have a feeling our nighttime viewer would appreciate the selection."

I don't know what's watching our 250-inch screen every night. I don't know why Mr. Infernus is so invested in keeping it entertained. And I definitely don't know why he insists on being called "Mr. Infernus" when his business cards clearly say his first name is Damien.

What I do know is that our employee satisfaction scores have never been higher. Everyone loves their new salaries, morale is through the roof, and productivity has increased by 40%. It's like having the perfect boss – as long as you don't ask too many questions about the glowing red eyes or the sulfur smell or the impossible viewing statistics from our empty office building.

I'm writing this at 2:47 AM from my apartment. I can't sleep because I keep thinking about what I saw on tonight's Netflix viewing report. Someone – or something – just started a 14-hour marathon of a series called "The Good Place."

I have a feeling it's taking notes.
