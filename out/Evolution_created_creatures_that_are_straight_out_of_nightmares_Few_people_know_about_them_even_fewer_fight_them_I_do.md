**Chapter One: Speak softly** 

He wrote. 

*"It probably isn´t a good idea to write this down. My emotions, what i have learned.. Any of it, really.*

*But i have to. After today, more than ever, i have to."*

He took a deep breath. The empty notebook in his lap with the title for a chapter already written, seemed to stare right at him.

 *Are you gonna write something then, boy? Or would you just like to look at my shiny white pages?* 

Another deep breath. A quiet *Fuck it..* 

And the pen hit the white. 

*,,I would usually introduce myself first, but i don´t know how much time i have left so i have to write everything important down in a hurry. Besides, my name hardly matters. In this notebook i will write down what i have come to learn about the lifeforms among us which i call ,,umbra". I came up with this name, tho they had many names over centuries of more and more humans encountering them. This notebook will serve as a bestiary, for all those whishing to learn how to destroy these creatures wherever they rear their ugly heads. My mothers tongue isn´t english, therefor i apologize for shortcomings in ortography and sentence structure"*

He nearly chuckled, when he looked at the wrinkled lines forming this last sentence. Why mention this at all? This isn´t a dissertation it´s as close as it gets to a death note. His thoughts were all over the place. The smell of iron in the air wasn´t making it easier either. Bloody idiot. 

,,*Alright. With that out of the way, i will characterize the first beast of this bestiary by telling what happened today. Due to suspicious circumstances, I was investigating something out in the country side. A farm with only an old man and a young girl living far away from others. There was a reason for them living so far from civilization. They´re of the gran´t tribe and the south in this part of the world is.. rather unforgiving for certain tribes and other demographics. So in summary, there were two  humans far away from any others, that were shunned by their community and that rarely had contact with others anymore. As if that wasn´t bad enough, the area is notoriously dry, making water in all its forms a valued rarity.* 

*And with what i heard was going on there.. It was like there was a fresh track of paws in the snow. Just had to find the wolve.*

*I had set up camp close to the farm, expecting a certain creature which relies on these conditions to hunt here, or at least pass by."*

Fuck. No. 

That wasn´t gonna work. He hadn´t explained jack shit so far. 

Alright. Explanation first, story later. Get a grip, J.

*,,I have to explain what i mean by saying a ,,creature". What i am about to say will without doubt make pretty much every sane being on earth think that i am making a joke or that i am clinically insane. All i can do is to give you who reads this my word:*

*I speak the truth.* 

*So what is this creature that i keep mentioning? Why don´t i just say ,,Animal" or categorize it in some other way? Because it isn´t an animal. Or a plant. Or a kind of fucking rock for all i care. It is a category that is vaster than all life known to man, but at the same time so unknown to man that this category had never been founded- until now.* 

*The ,,Umbra".* 

*The latin word umbra means shadow. I chose this name for this genus because it is about lifeforms that life among humans, without humans ever noticing them. Well, for the most part. Exceptions proof the rule. These creatures are the reasons for all the mythiological beings which we known from old legends, from film and television, books and comics. They are translucent wolves as tall as houses that turn to thin air when the sun rises, they are monkey-like air-breathing come-to-life nightmares that wear the face of your loved ones as a mask. They  are spirits that drive entire citys insane, are beings that have powers which we don´t even have words for. They are trees as much as they´re insects, they may look like men, women or children and drive humans to insanity. Some steal babies from their cribs to raise them as their own or just burn them over a fire for some tender meat. Savages, cannibals, the cruelest creatures imaginable. Countless times worse than the worst humans have ever been. Most of them are older than the oldest trees, their evolution going back so far that their traces show up billions of years ago in the fossil record.* 

*This is what i mean when i say creature. It may very well be anything. Through the brief time in which i have been hunting these creatures i must have encountered hundreds of species, maybe thousands. Their variety is truly unmatched. Cockroaches which release a chemical that makes humans cannibals, enough to drive a mother so mad she could bite her own child in the neck until blood is gushing all over her. Simply because these specific cockroaches need the blood of a child killed by its mother to lay their eggs in.*  

*Humanoid creatures that used to be humans until they were infected by the sting of a calagahar, a species of umbra that procreates by turning humans into versions of themselves, only for those newly made calagahar to kill and devour any human unlucky enough to encounter them, and feed their still warm meat to it´s calagahar mother..* 

*I could go on and on. And i will. In this bestiary i will write everything down that i have learned, details and stories about the behavior of all umbras i know of, from the harmless ones to the ones that could devour the planet in it´s entirety.* 

His hand had started to fly over the paper. As if his mind had realized that it finally had a release for the huge pressure that all of this information had built up inside him. After all he had noone to talk to. A therapist, maybe, but that would end in a clinic faster than he would want it to. 

He lit a cigarrette and let his head fall back, with it resting on the oak tree he was leaning on. 

These trees would need their own bestiary chapter one day. That kind of tree, with healthy green leaves and grass underneath it in a barren desert? Had got to be the den of an arboritus. 

Damn, he thought. I really started rambling. Those cockroaches were nasty, though. 

Lost in thoughts and writing, he hadn´t noticed. 

The oaks green leaves weren´t green anymore. All of a sudden they started turning yellow, becoming so dry that they turned to dust before they hit the ground. The grass he was sat on lost it´s colour, becoming almost white, breaking with a crunching sound under his weight. 

When he realized, smoke still lingering in front of his mouth, his eyes were wide open, with sweat on his forehead, and consumed by panic and desperation he failed to form a single coherent thought, bar one: Not like this. Not like this. Not like this. 

He had broken his most important rule in dealing with umbra: Remain vigilante. 

And so, the hunter had become the hunted. The laughter of young children approached from behind the tree, growing louder and louder, sounding more like the screams of tortured kids with every small paw that the desertum diaboli set in front of the other. 

His last survival strategy was to not move a single muscle. He even stopped breathing, with the foul smell of countless gallons of rotting blood encasing him.

I am fucked. Not like this. I am fucked. Not like this.
