I don’t know if anyone’s going to read this, or if I’m just posting to keep my mind from snapping. I’m in my bedroom, door locked, lights off. My dog’s under the bed, shaking. Something followed us home. I can hear it breathing on the other side of the door.

It started maybe an hour ago.

I usually walk my dog late — around 11 p.m. There’s a park nearby. Old. Kind of charming. Cobblestone paths, wrought iron benches, warm yellow streetlamps that make everything feel like it belongs in a novel. There’s also a big field next to it — always empty at night, just open space and the hum of the city in the distance.

Tonight I got distracted and left later than usual — 12:10 a.m.

The second I stepped into the park, I knew something was off. The lamps were out. I didn’t even know they *turned off.* It was pitch-black, except for the faint spill of streetlight behind me. The whole park looked… wrong. Not just darker — *emptier.* Like the air itself had gone stale.

I figured we’d do a quick loop and head back. My dog, normally fearless, kept close to my side.

We were near the duck pond when I heard it.

**Crunch.**

Like a boot on brittle leaves. I stopped. It stopped.

I turned — nothing.

Kept walking. Faster this time.

**Crunch.**  
**Shuffle.**

My dog froze. Hackles up. Tail tucked.

I turned again — and that’s when I saw it.

Across the field, just past the tree line. Something standing there. Unmoving. Too tall to be a person. Too still.

Its arms hung too low. Legs slightly bent like it had too many joints. Its head was tilted — *not like it was curious, more like it didn’t know how necks worked.*

I whispered, “Come on,” and started backing away.

It stepped forward.

That’s all I needed.

I turned and ran.

Then I heard **it** run.

Not footsteps. Something worse — fast, irregular, limbs hitting the pavement like hooves made of bone and rope. My dog sprinted ahead, leash flapping behind her. I didn’t look back. I *couldn’t*.

Every corner I turned, I expected to see it gaining.

I didn’t stop until we were home.

I slammed the door. Locked it. Deadbolt too. I collapsed inside, heart punching through my chest.

That’s when the doorbell rang.

I’ve got one of those smart doorbells with a camera feed. Pulled up the app. My phone was on 3%.

And there it was.

**Not on the porch.**  
Just off-frame.  
*Peeking around the edge.*

It didn’t have a face. Not really. The skin was stretched too tight, like someone vacuum-sealed flesh over a skull. The mouth looked like it was stuck mid-scream. But there were *no eyes* — just hollow dents.

It was holding something.

A **collar.**

Looked *exactly* like my dog’s.

But she was still under the bed.

The feed glitched. Froze. My phone died.

Now I’m here. In my room. Lights off. Laptop open.

And just now — I looked at the base of my door.

There’s a **shadow under it.**  
Too long. Too still. Like someone lying down, watching.

Every few seconds, it moves. Just slightly. Like it’s breathing. Or **waiting**.

Crunch. Shuffle. Crunch.

It’s not pacing. It’s **learning**.

Laptop’s on 7%.

I’m going to hide in the wardrobe. Bring the flashlight. Maybe it’ll help. Maybe it won’t.

If anyone sees this…

Don’t walk in the park after midnight.

And if you hear something behind you —  
**Don’t stop. Don’t turn. And whatever you do… don’t open the door.**
