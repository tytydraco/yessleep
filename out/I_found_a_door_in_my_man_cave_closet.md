I’m posting this because this might be the strangest thing I have personally ever discovered. I just married my wife and best friend last September and we moved into a three bedroom house shortly after. We had been living separately in our own one bedroom apartments so we were both ecstatic to start our lives together in one home. She has a son and I too have a son so we became a blended family. We agreed that the boys would share one of the bedrooms so I jumped all over the idea of having a guest bedroom that could double as my man cave, since I still did some casual online gaming with friends, and this would ensure I wouldn’t keep everyone up at night and I would have my own area to decompress at the end of the day.

So we moved into the house and there was an obvious smallest bedroom and I immediately started moving in the guest bed, end tables, and dresser. Most importantly, I was ready to set it up for gaming. I say gaming as if I play on a gaming pc but it’s just a ps5 - again, I’m only a casual gamer.

I set up the tv, then the ps5, and I then made sure I had a comfortable enough chair I could sit at while playing. It was a huge plus that this was the man cave room because the closet housed the internet modem so I was able to directly connect via ethernet for the ultimate experience. I was pumped.

While I was setting up and plugging in the new modem I noticed there was a mirror the  size of the entire back wall of the closet and at first I thought to myself, “that’s sort of a strange place to have a mirror. Usually you would have one on the closet door.” But I casually shrugged it off, eager to play the first test session of Fortnite and Minecraft with my friend.

After dinner that evening, the first evening in our new home, I kissed my wife and told her I would play for an hour or so before bed and resided to my new man cave. I turned on the ps5 from my controller, and.. network error. Damn. So I went and checked my connection at the modem in the closet and when I was slightly tugging at the internet cable running into the wall I accidentally knocked the mirror over. It didn’t shatter; it just leaned over onto the front wall, where the door to the closet is. And what lied behind it absolutely stunned me. An old metal door. About five feet tall and two and a half feet wide. I was more curious than I had ever been in my life. Only one problem though: it is completely welded shut. I mean it is welded at every seam on every edge of this door. What could possibly be behind this door that would make someone weld and seal this off so permanently?

Well I’m no handyman, so getting this open could take a while. Also my wife and boys do not know about this yet. 

Should I even open it? 

I will update as soon as I can.
