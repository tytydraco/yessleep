My name is Tom, and I've worked as a maintenance guy at Walmart for the past three years. It's not the most glamorous job in the world, but it pays the bills. And besides, I'm a night owl, so I don't mind working the graveyard shift.

Most of the night, I'm alone in the store with the security guard, Hank. The only sound is the hum of the freezers and the occasional beep of the checkout scanners.

I usually start my night by cleaning up the restrooms and sweeping the floors. Then, I move on to the back room to check on the merchandise and make sure everything is in order.

One night, I was in the back room when I heard a strange noise coming from the warehouse. It sounded like something heavy was being dragged across the floor.

I cautiously approached the warehouse, and I saw a large shadowy figure hunched over a pile of boxes.

The figure was tall and muscular with long gnarled arms and legs. Its head was hidden in the shadows, but I could see its eyes glowing with an eerie red light.

I froze with fear, I didn't know what to do or even if I could move.

The figure raised its head, and I could smell something foul coming from it. It was like a mix of rotting flesh and sulphur.

It turned its attention towards me, and I knew that I had to run.

I turned and ran through the warehouse, the figure hot on my heels. I could hear its heavy footsteps echoing behind me, and I could feel its breath on my neck.

I ran through the aisles of the store, knocking over displays and shelves in my haste to escape. I could hear the crashing of merchandise behind me, and I knew that the figure was getting closer.

I ran through the checkout lanes and into the manager's office, slamming the door behind me. I locked the door and pressed my back against it, listening for any sound from outside.

I could hear the figure pounding on the door, its growls and snarls filling the office. I knew that it was only a matter of time before it broke down the door.

I looked around the office desperately searching for a way out, there was a window on the far wall, but it was too high for me to reach.

I was trapped.

The door started to shake, and I knew that the figure was about to break in.

I closed my eyes and waited for the inevitable.

But then, I heard a loud crash from outside the office.

I opened my eyes and looked out the window, I saw the figure lying on the ground, a forklift’s forks protruding from its chest.

I was stunned, I didn't know who had saved me, but I was grateful.

I ran out of the office and found Hank standing beside the forklift, a look of satisfaction on his face.

“I told you I’d keep an eye on you,” he said.

I thanked him, and we walked out of the store together.

As we drove away, I couldn't help but wonder what the figure was and why it was in a Walmart.

The next day, I went straight to the security room to check the cameras. I searched for footage of the previous night, but there was nothing. No footage of the monstrous figure, no footage of Hank, no footage of the forklift's deadly strike.

I was confused. I remembered everything so vividly, the fear, the chase, the rescue. But there was no proof of it happening.

I decided to call the manager to see if he could shed some light on the situation. But when I told him my name, he had no idea who I was. He said that he had never heard of a Tom working at the store.

I felt a chill run down my spine. Who was I? If I didn't exist, then who was the guy who was chased by the monster in the warehouse?

I left the Walmart, my mind reeling. I didn't know what to believe anymore. Was the whole thing a dream? Or was there something more sinister at play?

I walked aimlessly through the streets, lost in my thoughts. I didn't know where I was going, or what I was going to do. But I knew that one thing was for sure: I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.

So i took some of my medication to calm me down…
