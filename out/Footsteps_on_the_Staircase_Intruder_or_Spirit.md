Hey guys its Hades Necromancer,

I am a 23-year-old male, and this is my story of one of my paranormal incidents I cannot explain

So, this happened when I was 18 years old. My Dad just rented me a place in Ohio. So, I was able to get a house for my first place. My friend Joseph (this is not his name for privacy purposes) and I moved in about a week or two after my 18th birthday. The house just seemed off. It was darker than usual when it was light out and it just had a heaviness to it. Joseph and I were smoking some Mary Jane and looking at old stuff the previous tenants left. As a practicing witch myself I noticed a couple big rocks of Quarts and other gems. That was my first red flag. Well, I was currently working at Denny's for my job and Joseph was working somewhere else, but this is very relevant. It was a week or so in when my first ever auditory paranormal experience happened.

Now the layout of the house is key to understanding where I was in the house when this happened. When you first enter the drive, you have three options. You can pull all the way back until you get to the backyard which is semi fenced in. There was an empty lot to the right as you pull in and a back porch that has two sets of stairs, one that’s directly left when you get out and another set that is coming from the backyard. The second entrance is on the left of the driveway if you do not pull all the way back to the end of the driveway, and finally you have a front porch that is fairly decent size.

Now when you enter the front door you have about 3 or 4 ft of fauryer and if you turn to the left, you can see the living room, if you turn right from the foyer, you have a set of stairs that have two landings that go at a backward c. There are two rooms on both sides when you go up. Two bedrooms on the left, a bathroom immediately to your right, and a bedroom further down on the right. The rest of the layout is not important.

So, one night when Joseph went to work, and I was home alone by myself. My room is the far back left room on the top floor. It was about 8 pm and I was watching the fire season of avatar the Last Airbender on this crappy tv that had a DVD player built in the side. My bed was pressed against the wall that was right of the door when you enter and the tv was directly left of the doorway. I was in three good episodes in and enjoying myself when suddenly I heard distinct footsteps slowly coming up the stairs. before they stopped at the second landing about halfway up the last set of stairs.

The house is over one hundred years old and the stairs creak when you step on them but are muffled due to the carpet. I had an oh shit moment where I just froze. My first thought was someone was on the stairs, and I did not have a weapon. I slowly slid off the bed trying to keep the pressure as even as I got up so as not to make any noise which proved ineffective, as I opened the door in a tense fighting stance ready to swing at anyone... no one was there... I made my way down the stairs slowly turning on lights as I went but I saw no one. I slowly made my way into the kitchen grabbing a knife before I went down into the basement. The basement had a hot water tank in the back left corner with various unfinished walls that had no drywall up throughout the area of the basement. Nothing... I just could not explain it. I called my roommate up and asked if he had come home and forgotten something, but he was still at work.

I know what you are thinking, you have a pet. Nope my dad is a stickler for pets back then and I would have had to pay a 500-dollar deposit which I did not have. So, pets are out of the equation. So truly I want to know everyone’s thoughts. My sister has a couple of stories I would love to share of a different house she lived in back in Ohio. So, tell me what it could have been, leave it down in the comments below
