After speaking to management, I no longer had any reason to believe this was just stress or exhaustion.

According to their records, my apartment was occupied, paid for, and functioning exactly as it should have been. The only thing missing was me.

When I got back to my apartment, I stood in front of the door longer than I should have.

My key still worked.

The lock turned the way it always had.

Inside, everything looked the same. Clean. Quiet. Exactly how I’d left it.

I went straight to the bedroom and opened the closet. I pulled out the laundry basket.

Empty.

I stared at it, trying to work out whether that was right.

I couldn’t.

That was the problem.

I held the rim of the basket, and for a moment my mind tried to do what it always does. It tried to build a story that kept me safe.

You’re exhausted.

You’re paranoid.

You’re spiralling.

But I’d just watched my apartment number on a management screen with no name attached to it.

The system was functioning perfectly without me as a person, as long as the apartment continued to behave like it was occupied.

Whatever was happening to me didn’t look like a mistake.

By evening, my nerves had worn down to something raw and thin. I couldn’t sit still. I couldn’t focus on anything for more than a minute. Every time I felt my attention slip, I imagined that blank field on her screen.

Occupied.

Active.

Nameless.

At just after ten, I decided to go down to the laundry room again.

The laundry room lights were on.

And before I reached the doorway, I heard it.

That rattling washer in the far corner, running hard.

I watched the machine rock slightly on its feet, like something inside it was trying to get out.

Then I noticed something new.

Taped to the wall above the machines was a printed sign.

Plain white paper. Black text.

Except it had my unit number on it.

Not written in pen.

Printed.

UNIT 2B — PLEASE EMPTY LINT TRAP AFTER USE.

I stood there staring at it, my mouth dry.

I hadn’t used the dryer. I was sure of that.

I started to panic, trying to think this through.  
Who would have printed that?  
When?  
Based on what?

Nothing about it felt rushed. Nothing about it felt reactive. It looked like the kind of sign that gets made when a behaviour happens often enough to need reminding.

The washer thudded. The lights hummed.

I backed out of the laundry room and went upstairs without touching anything.

Inside my apartment, everything still looked normal.

I sat on the edge of the bed and tried to hold onto my thoughts, afraid of how easily they’d been slipping lately.

Because whatever was going on during those gaps when all these things were happening wasn’t chaotic.

It followed rules.

Laundry was folded.

Chores were finished.

The building tracked occupancy.  
Management collected payment.  
Machines ran.  
Signs were printed.

And none of it seemed to require me to be present as a person.

Only that the apartment continued to behave like someone lived there.

I don’t know what that means yet.

But sitting there, listening to the quiet settle back into place, I realised something I couldn’t explain away anymore.

Whatever this was, it didn’t seem new. Everything around it already knew what to do.
