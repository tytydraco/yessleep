Over the past year I’ve been documenting a disturbing trend in the patients in my clinic. It started simple enough, more people presenting paranoia, depression and mood swings, nothing that would arise suspicion in me seeing more people with them. Jeniffer A (A moniker to protect patient-doctor confidentiality) was likely the first person I encountered suffering from this. She had been a patient for a full year already when, on top of her already diagnosed depression, she started displaying clear signs of paranoia. She came in one day, dishevelled to the point that I was concerned at first glance, she was normally very well put together, and now she looked like she hadn’t showered in weeks.

“My neighbour keeps looking at me through the window.” She said. “He just stands there looking at me, I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I can’t even shower because I know he’s going to be watching me.”

“And how many times has this happened Jeniffer, this could be a real issue, I’m not surprised this has you on edge.” I reassured her.

“I’ve only caught him once, but I *know* he’s watching me. That old pervert had eyes for me the moment I moved in!” She replied.

“And when you say looking at you, how was he doing that? Was he stood still or in his house or-”

“He was walking that stupid dog… I hate that dog…. And then, walking past my house, he looked in my window and the sick freak had the nerve to smile and wave at me, like I don’t know what he’s doing!”

At this point, it was clear that something was… off. With Jennifer. She had taken to her medication extremely well and I had considered her one of my most successful cases. I’m still new to practicing, so I don’t have too much experience. So, to see her like this really did hurt.

“Well Jennifer, maybe you could try closing the curtains, it sounds to me like you’re reading a little too much into this. He’s probably just trying to be a good neighbour.” I said, trying to get her to see just a little more clearly.

“Oh! So you don’t believe me either?” She snapped.

“Of course I believe you, and if you really think this may be something more, I recommend documenting when it happens so you can build a ca- wait what do you mean ‘either’?”

“Those assholes at the police station wouldn’t listen to me either! Said I have ‘no proof’ and I’m ‘being paranoid’ one of those stuck-up pricks had the nerve to ask me if I was on something! Can you believe it? Me? A drug addict?” She scoffed, her face turning a deep red in frustration.

At this point, it was clear that she would need treatment for what was clearly a bout of paranoia, otherwise, she would have to be institutionalised. The longer we spent in the room together the more her body odour became unbearable, she didn’t just *look* like she hadn’t bathed in weeks, she really hadn’t. Her skin was a disaster, and her clothes were torn and stained and throughout our entire conversation she had been sweating like she was running a marathon. I could only imagine what her home must’ve looked like. It was clear she was becoming incapable of looking after herself.

I wrote down in my notes, something I rarely do mid-session, that I suspect she might have developed either PPD (Paranoid Personality Disorder) or paranoid schizophrenia. Both rather serious conditions but nothing that couldn’t be worked through. When I looked up from my notes I could see her face had twisted into a visage of pure anger.

“What the hell are you writing? What do you think you’re doing? You’re here to help me not piss me off! You know what, I’ve had it, I don’t have to sit here and take this from you, first you wont believe me and now you’re writing lies about me? I’m done, fuck you.” She got up and stormed out of my office, she flung the door open and rushed out so fast that she bumped right into my next patient for the day, who had arrived early.

I knew then I would likely have to call in a wellness check on her, it was unlikely that she was managing herself well at home and I couldn’t just let her suffer. However, this is when I made the worst decision of my professional life. I was so taken aback and irritated with a patient, that I just ignored it and called in the next person, Adam B (Another moniker). His name will be important later, but at this time, he wasn’t coming to me for any diagnosable conditions, rather, he would book two-hour sessions, once a month, for talk therapy. Just to get out emotions, seek help in conflicts and any emotional issues he was having. Being pedantic you *could* describe him as having anger issues but the man lived a particularly high-stress lifestyle.

Five minutes before our session ended, I had two police officers at my office door.

“Are you doctor James Miller?” The taller of the two asked.

“I am, and I’m in the middle of a session what’s this about?” I responded.

The shorter of the two officers looked at me with a stern gaze and said, “You’re going to have to come with us, we need to take a statement regarding a patient of yours, she said you just saw her?”

My stomach dropped.

In the two hours I had been talking to Adam B, Jennifer A had driven back to her home, spotted her neighbour, Johnathan Fritz, swerved onto the pavement and hit him at eighty-five miles per hour. The total casualties, I was told, were three, Johnathan Fritz and his two grandchildren. My statement was brief, and my notes weren’t helpful for the defence either. She was sentenced to life in a high-security psychiatric hospital.

I still think about her. I should’ve just made him wait. In my head I blame it on my lack of experience, but I knew what I had to do, I just didn’t. and now they’re dead because of me.

Now, back to Adam B, because he is instrumental in *all* of this. The following session, a month from when I was questioned, he was different. I didn’t notice at first but as the session kept going, he became irritable, twitchy, kept checking the windows and looking in the corner of the room. At first I thought he was just having a bad day, he *did* have problems with anger and I mean, how could I have known then. By the final fifteen minutes I had significant concerns.

“Adam, do you think your problems at work have been increasing lately?” I asked.

“Of course they fucking have, that asshole *Ron* has it out for me. He’s wanted my job for years and now he’s trying to fucking sabotage me? Lucky I don’t smash his teeth in.” The venom in the name Ron was one of the most frightening thing I’ve ever heard, just the sound had me sounding alarm bells. He *meant* that threat.

“Listen Adam, I’ve known you my whole career, now I’m willing to overlook that, which I shouldn’t do, but I will, if you tell me *why* you think he’s trying to sabotage you.”

“I just *know* alright, he’s always… looking, at what I’m doing, y’know, always following me around the office, looking at my screen, it’s driving me fucking crazy.” He said, scratching the side of his face.

“Well, I mean. Who *is* this Ron to you, what’s his role, why do you think he’s after your job.” I asked.

“He’s my secretary.” He said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.

“Adam, wouldn’t that mean he *can’t* get your job, even if he wanted it?”

“Oh fuck off, don’t give me that crap, my wife has been saying that all month, I *know* he has it in for me, just the other day he swapped my files around, I wrote the wrong date on the wrong paper, then *he* filed it anyway, cost me another four hours when it blew up on me which I had to do *after* work. You think I don’t wanna go home? See my wife? My daughter? Fucking ridiculous, and he thinks he’s gonna have *my* job. And what’s with that fucking voice of his, always so fucking shrill? For God’s sake he’s twenty-five years old, let your balls drop already asshole. And *another thing*…”

His rant lasted the remainder of the session, when I would try to speak, he’d just keep going, like he couldn’t even hear me, his face got redder and redder, his shoulders visibly tense and by the time he left his shirt was drenched in sweat. It was frightening seeing him like that. Even more worrying was how angry he was at this man for just doing his job. But I *wasn’t* going to make the same mistake again. When he left, I immediately made a call to the police. Told them my patient was exhibiting signs of extreme anger and potentially had plans to hurt somebody. They told me they would check up as soon as possible, that night if they could.

At that point, I hadn’t even begun to connect the dots between Jennifer A and Adam B. How could I? Two people expressing paranoia isn’t exactly uncommon, neither is being violent, and I mean. How *could* they be connected.

The following morning, I didn’t even make it to work. I got a knock on my door at 7AM. Two police officers, the same as last time. Mark C and Carol D. I saw the looks on their faces and knew, I invited them inside to give a statement. Again.

Adam B killed his wife. When the police got to his house at 9PM the day of our session, he was in the garage with his car running. Turns out, he was still alive, grabbed hold of Carol D’s arm hard enough to leave visible bruising on her wrist. They asked to see my notes which I provided. This time, I told them how sudden this was, made sure they knew this had to have developed in the last month, that he wasn’t *like* this before. Mark C let out a curious sounding “Hm.” When I asked him what that meant, he said that this wasn’t the only case of someone making a sudden switch and committing a violent attack of some kind. Carol shot him daggers across the table, he was *obviously* not meant to just tell somebody that. But then I got to thinking, what about Jennifer.

After work that day, I did some reading of the local newspaper, something I never do, looking for anything about Jennifer. And I did. In the obituaries. A month after she was sentenced, she had killed herself. I couldn’t believe it, a month to the *day*. I had to know more, I had to. So, I, called. I called the hospital and asked what happened, they said they couldn’t tell me, of course, but once I told the nurse *who* I was, she, softened a bit. Told me some of the details, medication didn’t work at all, she became more violent with time but then she turned that violence to herself, sedated as much as allowed, kept in her room. One day the sedative ran out and… well she did it the only way she could, bit off her own tongue.

I was mortified, more than that, I thought about Adam. *He* tried to kill himself too, as soon as he did it. And *that* case made the news. When the police questioned him in the hospital that night, he broke down in tears, said he didn’t even remember doing it, that he blacked out and just, woke up to find his wife of seven years dead in the kitchen, he couldn’t live with himself, etc. The next day however, when he was taken and questioned again at the station? He headbutted his own lawyer, threatened to kill him too and tried to rip his cuffs off the table so hard they sliced a full centimetre into his skin. Back to hospital he went. He never became lucid again.

It's worth mentioning that I live in a very small town, situated between other small towns. I’m the only psychologist outside the city so I’m particularly busy. Turns out, those ‘good ‘ole country types’ have a lot of problems too. Usually marital, honestly not that interesting. Alcoholics, violent types, they’re common too. Schizophrenics and PPD are far less common out here, that’s why Jennifer was so unusual. Adam commuted in, he lived outside the city he worked at, some gated community, again, murder was rare there, but I didn’t count Adam as a country type. But two weeks later when Carol D came walking sheepishly into my office, I knew something was *wrong.*

She said that she was recommended to come her by her colleague, Mark C, because she was ‘acting paranoid’. I think she could tell by the look on my face that I was very interested in this. When I asked for more details on why, she said she was convinced that Adam B was going to escape custody and kill her. When I asked her why, she said she just knew. Now I was noticing the pattern, this *knowing* the patients were presenting with, I knew the anger would come next, I just couldn’t see when, she seemed far earlier along than the other two, which means we may be able to get ahead of it.

When I asked what about Adam had rattled her so badly, she rolled up her sleeve. The bruising on her wrist had gotten *worse*. I’ve never seen anything like it, perfect hand marks in deep purples and greens on her wrist, like he had paint on his hands or something.

“What do you call *this* if not a sign.” She said, starting to sweat and dart her eyes around the room. “I *know* he’s going to come for me, you know he headbutted his own lawyer? Oh my god and his *wife?* They still haven’t found all the pieces of her you know, they don’t know what he did with her body parts, but the coroner said it was one of the worst homicides he’s ever seen. One hundred and forty-five stab wounds doc. That’s…. that’s insane. And I *know* I’m next.”

This one was much harder to dismiss, in all honesty, I would be paranoid too if something like that was part of my job, hell, it *was* part of my job now and I had spent more than one night unable to sleep. But while I held off on any rash judgements, I couldn’t help but take notes and start connecting patterns, they were too close together and too damn similar for me to ignore.

That night I did something I really shouldn’t have. I called Mark C and asked why *he* recommended that Carol come see me. He told a *very* different story. She wasn’t just worried he would come after her, she was worried he already was. He found her nailing her windows shut, with plans to board up her doors, with her inside. She wasn’t earlier along and less severe than the others. She was just *lying*. I immediately told Mark to do a wellness check, no time to waste, institutionalise if *anything* is off. I told him I think something in the area might be causing these cases, and to not take any chances. He must have heard the concern in my voice because within minutes he was off on the wellness check.

Carol D was institutionalised that night. Mark C *did* find her. Windows boarded up, doors with red paint saying “Adam C go away” the whole nine yards. They had to get the fire service out to cut her door down with how much barricading she had done to it.

I spent the next week sending email after email asking to sit down with her at the hospital and talk, told her I had seen her before, etc, etc. After some consistent pestering, I was granted *one* session. I drove four hours into the city to get to get to the hospital, just to be told at the door that I was already too late, she was in police custody. Killed a nurse on the ward by biting her neck wide open, the hospital was in absolute chaos and I knew that in another month, Carol D would kill herself.

I sent an admittedly frantic email to a member of faculty at the uni I graduated, pleading with the head of environmental studies to come do tests on the water supply, food supply, ground water, pipes, anything that could be causing a sudden uptick in paranoia and violence, I suspected lead or mercury, it made sense, there were industrial sites and mines nearby, maybe there was runoff, maybe corporate negligence, something had to be linking these together. I called Mark C, told him what had happened *and* what I was planning to do. I asked him, if I could get these tests done, would he be willing to show me these other cases he mentioned, about sudden decline.

It took a month to even get a response from the university. I couldn’t believe it, by this point. My God it had gotten worse. I was seeing two, three patients a week presenting these symptoms. In a matter of one month I had seen eleven people with this condition. Me and Mark C had developed a system, instead of the police, I would call him for the wellness check, he’d go in, no questions asked and institutionalise them. The nurses at the hospital we sent them too were briefed as well, we had a whole system of operation. We’d tag them, that’s how the nurses would know what they were and what to do with them. And what we’d do, is sedate them and lock them in a room. There wasn’t a moment where they had bodily control. Was it legal? Fuck no. Did everyone agree with it? Of course. Those nurses knew they’d be next if we just kept sending people like this too them, they’d lost one of their own already. They didn’t care what was legal.

Mark C did. Mark C had big issues with what we were doing, he had even bigger issues with me asking to see all the case files that the police had that were similar in nature to what I had been dealing with. He flat refused until he saw footage of Carol C. They had been, involved, let’s say. When he saw her, thrashing and screaming, beating her head against the floor? He knew this was something.

“Jesus, fuck.” He said exasperated.

“Do you get why I want to do this? I reached out to my old university, they wouldn’t send anyone. I need to see what’s going on here, if I just had more cases-”

“It’s alright. I get it. I’ll- I’ll get you those files.” He had such a sense of understanding in his voice.

“I think I’ll leave you be now… You okay man? You’re sweating.”

“Yeah, yeah I’m fine, I just miss her man.” He replied.

With that, the agreement was sealed, we shook hands and we went about our way until the next day when we could exchange files.

The email? They said no. I couldn’t believe it. It was up to us, up to *me*. The list of laws me and Mike C broke together could fill a page longer than this recollection. I am not a consultant or member of law enforcement. To show me the files was and is a crime and Mark knew that still. And files there were. See I dealt with eleven people. The police? They dealt with fifty. Across three towns. Half of those people were ambulance and police crews. I knew there was a connecting thread I just couldn’t figure it out. What could it be?

It was so simple in retrospect. But who the hell would think it was *that*. After reading all fifty files, I finally noticed it. The *reason* it was half comprised of ambulance and police, the *reason* Adam B was instrumental and the *reason* I missed it! All the case files said showed the next person to develop the condition was either attacked or restrained the last person to have an outburst. I couldn’t believe it. It made no sense, its unbelievable. This condition spreads through physical touch.

I documented this, meticulously. Crosstab tables, the whole deal. I called up a friend who did epidemiology in university, he was the only person I know who would take this even remotely seriously. When I showed him *why* I was saying this, he actually agreed. He said he needed to contact the CDC immediately, and he did. The CDC said the evidence was obtained illegally, said the notion was too far fetched to not have *more* of said illegal evidence, but they would send *one* guy to check groundwater for heavy metals. Lovely.

That takes us up to today, where I am, right now, writing in my boiling hot office, if I’m right, there’s going to be a hundred new cases. Across all three towns, the total population is three and a half thousand or so. Then it’ll be two hundred, four hundred and at that point they’ll have caught on. How many people are going to die before that? How many people will it spread to? God, the *nurses*! In the hospital? If even one of them gets touched it’s going be loose in the city Jesus I have to warn people, this, this has the potential to destroy everyone, that’s why I’m writing this. This town isn’t safe for me anymore, there could already be hundreds, waiting, Carol, that monster she hid it from me, who’s to say others can’t hide it better. Mark hasn’t called in days, I’m still waiting for that fucking CDC agent, just so he can come and test water that isn’t going to show anything, *if* they even test it. They know. I *know* they know, they have to, things like this don’t just happen. Oh fuck, *I* know. *Mark knows.* His name is Jeremy White you people *have* to check up on him he’s, he’s in as much danger as I am! Ever since we sent the files to the fucking CDC someone has been tailing me, this black car, they’re watching me whenever I’m in my office they’re trying to *hide* this. I’m *not* going to let them, do you fucking hear me? I know you can see my screen Ellen. Yeah, didn’t think I’d catch on? Following me in that car? How long have you people known? Long enough for my fucking secretary to be a plant, you think you’re *safe?* Well. We’ll just see about that when you walk in here tomorrow acting like nothing’s wrong. Then we’ll see.

Until then, you’ve all been warned.
