I hadn’t thought much of the doll when I first found it. It was tucked away in an old cardboard box at the back of my grandmother’s attic, covered in years of dust and mystery. That attic was a strange place, a forgotten realm of antique furniture, broken clocks, and faded family portraits that stared out with eyes that seemed to follow you if you stayed too long. I’d never explored it thoroughly before, but I was helping to clear it out after my grandmother’s passing, sorting through decades of memories and relics, deciding what to keep and what to let go.

The doll was small, no more than a foot tall, with delicate porcelain skin painted in hues long faded by time. Its dress was once a soft pink, now dulled to the color of aged rose petals, frayed at the edges. But it was the doll’s face that stopped me. Eyes of glass stared straight ahead, unblinking and oddly alive, set against painted lashes and cheeks dusted with a faint blush. The expression was neither a smile nor a frown but something in between, an eerie neutrality that made me hesitate to pick it up.

But I did.

The doll was lighter than I expected, almost hollow, as though it were just a shell. I turned it over, looking for some kind of maker’s mark, but there was nothing. No sign of where it came from or who made it. Just that strange, empty face. The attic seemed to grow quieter as I examined the doll, and a prickling sense of awareness stirred within me, as though the air itself had shifted.

I told myself I was being ridiculous. It was just an old doll, nothing more. Still, something about it lingered with me as I carried it downstairs and set it on a shelf in my room. I hadn’t planned on keeping it, but something in me couldn’t leave it in the attic. It felt wrong to discard it, as though it would somehow be offended by the gesture. I kept it in a corner, facing the wall, telling myself it would go into storage as soon as I could find a proper box for it.

That night, my dreams were strange and fragmented, vivid in a way that dreams usually aren’t. I saw flashes of the doll’s face, but in each vision, its expression was slightly different—sometimes its mouth was open, as though it wanted to speak. Other times, it was scowling or grinning, too wide and too unnatural. I would wake in the middle of the night, my room dimly lit by the moon filtering through my window, and each time I woke, I would glance at the corner where the doll sat.

I’d placed it facing the wall, but each time, its head seemed to have turned ever so slightly in my direction. It was subtle, just a shift of an inch or two, but it was unmistakable. Still, I brushed it off as my mind playing tricks on me, convincing myself that I’d moved it without realizing.

The following day, strange things began happening around the house. I’d come downstairs to find cabinets open that I hadn’t touched, lights flickering when there was no breeze or faulty wiring to explain it. Objects would go missing and then reappear in odd places, as though they’d been deliberately hidden and then returned. A photo frame from my childhood was placed on the kitchen counter one morning, though I was certain I’d last seen it in a drawer weeks ago. It felt like the house itself had gained a new presence, something that moved in the quiet spaces between each heartbeat.

At first, I rationalized everything. Old houses have quirks, after all, and I was prone to misplacing things now and then. Yet, every time I tried to push these incidents to the back of my mind, a quiet unease would pull me back to that doll. I began to suspect that it wasn’t just an innocent relic from my grandmother’s attic, that it carried something dark within it, some energy that shifted and pulsed like a heartbeat. I started to avoid looking at it directly, as though avoiding its gaze would keep whatever was inside it at bay.

But the disturbances grew more intense as the days went on. I would hear faint footsteps at night, light and delicate as though someone were tiptoeing around my room, though I always slept alone. One evening, I found strange marks on the wooden floor around my bed—small, circular scuffs in patterns that resembled a child’s dancing steps, and they circled my bed in a dizzying loop. I scrubbed at them until my hands hurt, but the faint marks remained, etched into the floor like scars.

One night, as I was about to turn off the light, I felt an almost magnetic pull to look at the doll, as though it was beckoning me, silently demanding my attention. I tried to ignore it, focusing on anything else, but I felt an overwhelming compulsion, a gravity that I couldn’t escape. Finally, I turned my head and looked at it directly for the first time in days.

Its face had changed.

The once-neutral expression had twisted into something else, a look of pure, quiet malice, though the features themselves hadn’t moved. Somehow, the very essence of its face was different, sharper, crueler. Its eyes seemed to gleam with a darkness that hadn’t been there before, a depth that felt bottomless. I sat there, paralyzed, feeling a strange dread settle over me like a weight pressing down.

I tried to shake it off. Surely, I thought, my mind was tricking me again. I walked over and picked up the doll, examining it under the lamp’s light, turning it this way and that to dispel the unsettling feeling. But as I held it, I noticed something I hadn’t before—tiny, almost invisible cracks along its porcelain cheeks, thin lines that seemed to spread further as I watched.

Suddenly, I heard a whisper, faint yet undeniable, curling around my thoughts like smoke. It was my grandmother’s voice, clear and yet far away, as though she was calling to me from the other side of a long tunnel.

“Don’t keep it…”

“Let it go…”

But I couldn’t move. My hands felt glued to the doll, my skin tingling where it touched the cold, fragile surface. It felt wrong, unnatural, as though I was holding something that was never meant to be touched. I forced myself to set it down, practically throwing it back onto the shelf, and stumbled back, my breathing heavy. That night, I left the lights on, sleeping fitfully under their faint glow.

The next day, I decided it was time to get rid of the doll. I wrapped it in a thick blanket, sealing it in a cardboard box before shoving it into the corner of the basement. I felt a weight lift as soon as I let it go, a sense of relief that I hadn’t realized I needed.

But that relief was short-lived.

In the dead of night, I awoke to a soft, rhythmic tapping. It sounded like fingernails lightly scratching against wood, persistent and patient. I tried to ignore it, pulling the blankets over my head, but it grew louder, as though the sound was creeping closer. Finally, I couldn’t stand it any longer. I sat up, looking around in the dim light, my gaze drawn to the door.

The scratching was coming from outside my room, down the hall, near the basement door.

I lay frozen, staring at the door, listening to that soft, maddening sound. The scratching persisted, rhythmic and deliberate, scraping its way deeper into my nerves. I knew it had to be coming from the basement, from the box where I’d stashed the doll. I could feel it in my bones, an instinctive certainty that whatever was in that doll wasn’t content to be hidden away.

I don’t know what compelled me to leave the safety of my bed, but a strange compulsion gripped me, pushing me to confront whatever was waiting in the darkness. I wrapped a robe around myself, opened the door, and stepped into the hallway. The scratching grew louder as I approached the basement stairs, turning into a soft, eerie scuffling, as though something small and nimble was moving around down there.

I gripped the banister and forced myself down each step, the creaks of the old wooden stairs echoing around me. My heart thudded with each creak, but I pressed on, unable to shake the feeling that I needed to see it, to understand what it was that had slipped into my home through that doll. The scratching stopped as I reached the basement door, replaced by an unnatural silence, as though whatever had been making the sound was waiting for me to find it.

I pulled open the door, flicking on the basement light. The bulb flickered a few times before it settled into a dim, sickly glow. I took a deep breath and descended into the basement, feeling the chill in the air press against my skin like cold hands. The cardboard box was where I’d left it, but something felt wrong, off-kilter. I could feel a strange energy radiating from it, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat, filling the room with an oppressive weight.

I walked up to the box, my hands shaking as I lifted the flaps. There was the blanket, folded over the doll, and I hesitated, feeling that strange dread settle over me again. But I couldn’t look away. I reached down, peeling back the edge of the blanket to reveal the doll’s face.

It was staring straight at me, and its expression was different again. The face that had been so neutral now held an unmistakable rage, a fury that seemed to boil beneath the surface of its delicate features. Its glass eyes looked wet, almost real, and I could swear that they followed me as I moved. The cracks in its porcelain cheeks had spread, spidering out like fractures in ice, and for a moment, I thought I could see something moving behind those cracks, something alive and shifting, hidden just beneath the surface.

Suddenly, the doll’s mouth opened, not as a slow movement but in a violent snap, its jaw dropping unnaturally low. A whisper hissed out, faint but unmistakable, words that seemed to drip with anger.

“Why did you hide me?”  the voice rasped, though it was nothing like my grandmother’s. It was twisted, inhuman, laced with an ancient malice that sent chills through my blood.

I recoiled, dropping the blanket, and the doll’s mouth slowly closed, returning to that eerie, unreadable expression. I didn’t wait to hear anything else. I slammed the box shut and ran up the stairs, locking the basement door behind me, my breath coming fast and shallow. I told myself I’d get rid of it in the morning, that I’d take it as far from my house as I could and leave it somewhere it could never find me again.

But the night had other plans.

I barely slept, every sound in the house amplified, every creak and groan setting my nerves on edge. I thought I heard faint laughter once, drifting through the walls, a soft giggle that sent a prickling unease through my skin. But I stayed in my room, forcing myself to ignore it, telling myself it was only my mind playing tricks on me.

Come morning, I pulled myself together, threw on a jacket, and grabbed the box from the basement. I could feel the doll’s presence even through the cardboard, like an angry heat that radiated outward. I didn’t look inside as I carried it to the car, setting it in the trunk and driving out of town. I didn’t know where I was going; I only knew that I needed to get rid of it, to put as much distance between me and that cursed thing as possible.

I drove for hours, the doll’s presence haunting the back of my mind, an almost palpable weight that made it hard to think. I finally reached a dense patch of woods at the edge of a state park, far from any roads or trails. I stopped the car, grabbed the box, and walked into the trees until I was surrounded by silence. There, I dug a shallow hole, placed the box inside, and covered it with dirt, hoping that it would be enough to contain whatever dark energy the doll held.

But as I walked back to the car, a strange sensation crept over me, a feeling that I was somehow not alone, that something had followed me from the grave I’d made. I told myself it was only my imagination, a lingering effect of the doll’s unsettling presence. But as I reached my car and looked back toward the trees, I thought I saw a faint figure standing at the edge of the woods, watching me. It was too far away to make out clearly, but it looked small, doll-like, its face hidden in shadow.

I got in the car and drove away, refusing to look back again, willing myself to forget that I’d ever found the doll. I thought that would be the end of it, that I could return to my life and leave that cursed thing behind. But the dreams started again that night, darker and more vivid than before. I saw the doll’s face over and over, twisting with expressions of rage, sorrow, and something else—a strange hunger that made my skin crawl.

I tried to push it out of my mind, to convince myself that it was only a bad memory, but every night, the dreams would return, growing stronger, pulling me back to that face, those glassy, lifelike eyes that seemed to bore into my very soul. And then, things began happening around the house again. Strange sounds in the walls, objects moving from where I’d left them. The same sensations I’d felt when the doll was here, as though its spirit had followed me home, refusing to let go.

One evening, as I was preparing for bed, I found a small, porcelain finger on my pillow, cracked and delicate, resting as though it had been placed there deliberately. I recognized it immediately—it was one of the doll’s fingers, chipped and aged, bearing those faint cracks I had seen spreading across its face.

I threw the finger out the window, but the next morning, it was back, resting in the same spot, as though it had never left.

In the following days, more pieces began to appear—a fragment of lace from the doll’s dress, a tiny shoe, a sliver of glass from one of its eyes. They would show up in strange places—inside my drawers, at the bottom of my coffee cup, hidden between the pages of my books. Each piece felt like a message, that it was still with me, still bound to me no matter how far I’d buried it.

In the deepest part of my soul, I know that I’ll never be rid of it. The doll will find a way back to me, piece by piece, pulling itself from the earth, reforming, lying in wait for the moment when I am most vulnerable. And when it does, I don’t know if I’ll have the strength to resist.

All I can do is brace myself, hoping that somehow, this nightmare will end. Because when that final piece returns, when the doll is whole again, I fear it won’t be content to merely linger in the shadows.
