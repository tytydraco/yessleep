It started a couple of days ago, with a fever. It was my final day off before I had to head back to work at a finance firm, and I had spent most of it lounging around, only leaving the house to pick up some groceries so I wouldn't have to do so after an exhausting day back.

When I was in the deli aisle, picking up some cheese for some tacos I was planning on making, a man walked up to me. He seemed dirty, in an oversized cargo jacket and worn-out jeans. His hair was tangled and greasy, but as he walked, I couldn't explain it fully, but his gait just didn't match him at all. He walked tall and straight, confident with a wide, toothy smile.

"Hello, sir, may I have a moment of your time?" He asked, cool and clear as he outstretched a hand covered in a fingerless glove that looked like it hadn't been washed in decades. Just wanting him to go away, I took his hand and shook it, the cold sweat that was soaking his exposed skin seeping into my own dry palm.

"Hey, thanks, but I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. And I don't have any change."

The man nodded politely, still smiling.

"Fair enough, sir, have a good day."

He plodded off, and I watched as he approached a few others in the aisle, outstretching his hand but getting no takers other than me. I pulled out some Germex and rubbed it on my hands, hoping it wasn't some perv trying to spread a disease or his freshly rubbed dick stink.

The rest of the day was average, a little bit of gaming, keeping up with a couple of friends, but as it got closer to nightfall, my head started to throb. At first, I thought it was maybe allergies, or I hadn't been drinking enough water.

But by the time the sun went down, my head was screaming, like there was a nail being slowly driven deeper and deeper into my brain. No amount of Tylenol or Ibuprofen could even dampen it. But every time I checked my temp, it kept reading a nice lean 78 degrees.

I decided to try to get to sleep and, if in the morning it was still bad, I would call in from work and go to a walk-in clinic.

After an hour tossing and turning, I finally managed to pass out, only to wake up at 3:30 AM, with my head still absolutely screaming. I texted my boss, whom I thanked god I was on good terms with, that I wasn't gonna make it to the office today. Surprisingly, getting back to sleep was much easier than getting into it, and I slept wonderfully.

My eyes opened to a similar scene outside my bedroom window to what I had woken up to: a dark city at night, fluorescent lights making an artificial day. I yawned, feeling tired. Stretching, my body felt far more exhausted than my sleep should've left me; my shoulders ached with previous effort.

I checked my phone: 8:55 PM. 'Fuck, did I sleep through the entire day?' I thought, thankful that I was at least free from my headache. I realized there was no point in going back to sleep, so I just went through the motions of the day inside my apartment.

As I got up and went about my routine, I noticed my wallet was in a different spot than I remembered. I usually leave it on the kitchen table so I can grab it on my way out, but this time, it was on the counter where I usually drop it off after I get home. Odd, but not abnormal. 'Maybe I just put it there and forgot,' I thought.

Then, I saw my laundry room, the dryer rumbling as it squeezed all of the liquid out of my clothes. There was only one problem: I hadn't even put anything in the washer, let alone the dryer. I felt a tingle on the back of my neck, like someone was watching me notice oddities around my house. Instinctively, I checked around my ceiling, paranoia telling me there were now cameras in my home. I was only slightly relieved to discover a lack of anyone spying on me, but the feeling persisted.

I tried to come up with an excuse for the dryer as I stumbled into the kitchen, my head starting to hurt again. Opening the fridge just unhinged my reality a little further, as I saw a hamburger, still in its fast-food paper wrapping. 'Now, I KNOW that wasn't there before.' I thought, 'Had someone dropped by and gotten my laundry done and given me a burger? John, or maybe Chelsie? But they shouldn't have keys...' My thought trailed off as I heard a ding from my bedroom.

Walking back in, I found my phone in a pair of work pants, discarded on the side of the bed opposite the one I slept in. Pulling it out, a sense of dread slowly crept up my legs to fill my gut as I read a text I just received from 'Gigi from Work.'

"Thx for the help today!"

Weird. I checked the chat further and saw a text from 12:36 PM.

"Hey, you know anything about this new notice?" Read, and apparently, responded to. 

The pit in my stomach grew into an immense chasm, nearly making me nauseous as I saw a text, apparently, sent by me.

"Yeah, I'll come over and let ya know. Too much to explain over texts."

'What the fuck?' I thought. I hadn't gone anywhere all day. A growing, nagging voice began to chant in my mind, like a whisper, "Something is wrong, something is wrong."

The angles of my apartment felt wrong, like my home had been silently and suddenly turned into someone else's. The knife rack was empty, and seemingly, every sharp object in my apartment was gone. My screwdriver, toothpicks, tweezers, and anything that could be sharp or sharpened were gone.

I started storming around my apartment in a frenzied panic, wondering if someone had broken into my home, sent a text from my phone, left a burger in the fridge, and turned my laundry on to avoid raising suspicion. But that wouldn't make any sense, maybe if they had killed me, but I was still very much alive. And besides, why do all of that just to murder me? Offset the time of death?

Then, another thought hit me. The voice in the back of my mind whispered like a corrupted advisor, 'But if they're still inside, taking all the weapons, making everything seem normal, well...'

I grabbed the closest thing to a weapon I had, the metal bar of my coat rack, and went room by room, ensuring that I was completely alone in my house. This, rather than ease my nerves, only added to the sense of unreality that was creeping into my mind, slinking in like a snake into a burrow. 

What was 'I' doing while I was asleep? There was no way I was so sick that I pushed through the day, and then collapsed back at home after grabbing fast food and starting my laundry, and somehow completely forgot about it. Looking down at myself in horror, I realized I had even changed clothes, only now noticing the white button-up I usually wear to the office, instead of the plain t-shirt I had fallen asleep in. 

I reached to open the phone, trying to put in my passcode as genuine panic began to climb up my throat. I needed to get someone, anyone, to confirm what happened, to reassure me that I hadn't forgotten about an entire day. My fingers moved instinctually, and...

Incorrect Passcode.

"What?" I said aloud, being a little shocked at the hoarseness of my own voice. Had I been talking a lot? In my sleep? AND changed my fucking passcode? My heart began to beat rapidly, my mind racing for any other possible codes, any time I changed it. I tried until it locked me out.

In a near state of panic, I rushed for the front door, desperate just to get out, talk to someone, reestablish any sense of normality. Bar still in hand, I reached for the door handle to finally escape, only for the most painful sensation of pins and needles to strike my hand limp. My fingers barely grazed over the handle as I jerked my arm away, my hand apparently fallen asleep as it stung my nerves with waves of agony. I let out a yelp, like a dog with a shock collar.

I backed away from the door like it was an electric fence, shaking my limp hand until I could contract my fingers. My blood was pumping, my fight or flight sending my entire nervous system on high alert. Mentally, I began checking myself: my breathing, my sight, all of my organs sitting inside fluid-filled sacs, concealed by flesh and bone. Had I had a stroke? Is that why I didn't remember all of today?

I turned back and practically dashed back into my bedroom, grabbing my phone off the bed where I had thrown it in a panic, while also feeling my own face for any looseness. I opened my phone and tapped the emergency call, only for an automated, blankly cheery voice to immediately tone out: "I'm sorry, but this device is currently-"

I threw the phone across the room, my heart beat combining with my headache to surge pandemonium into the forefront of my mind. I ran for my window, a wide sliding door to escape that lay just beyond my couch and coffee table. As soon as my hands reached the blinds, the pain in my head reached a crescendo, paralyzing both of my arms in unquenchable agony. I fell backwards, stumbling and landing on the ground as I rolled around in pain. 

I screamed, banged against the walls with my still able legs, like a wild animal stuck inside a cage. I thrashed and cried out for a minute or two before my hyperventilating breaths took my energy from me. I lay on the ground, trying to regain my composure.

'All of this has a rational, reasonable explanation.' A voice murmured from the back of my mind, as confident in the statement as I was in my situation. With my nervous system finally coming out of its high alert state, I looked around, trying to get a grip.

"Knives gone, phone locked, and I can't get out of my fucking apartment," I said aloud, almost hoping someone would answer. I pushed myself off the ground, groaning as my legs, aching from the thrashing, refused my initial commands like unbroken horses. A dark whisper bubbled up from my mind, one which I didn't entirely know was mine, 'What if your body isn't yours anymore?'

I shook the thought away and stumbled to my phone: 9:49 PM. 

My mind finally became steady, and I decided the best course of action was to fully examine myself, just to make sure I didn't have some tick or rash or lightning strike that could explain this. At that point, a lightning strike causing this was just as possible as lightning striking me and me not noticing in the first place. 

Looking into my bathroom mirror, my back and chest were all clear, legs seemed fine. But as my arms grazed over one another, and as my hand scanned my right wrist, I could detect that there was something clearly wrong with the sensation, but it was hard to tell what. I rubbed my skin while looking closer, pressing down like I was trying to feel for worms, and the very thought made the inside of my flesh crawl with invisible bugs. 

It was only when I pinched my skin did I realized what was off: my veins were, by perhaps a hair or two's length, bigger. They bulged like there was too much blood pumping through them. My mind went to my panic attack earlier, but even the rational part of my mind shot that down. 'This isn't normal,' it whispered, like a child watching their parents fight for the first time.

I spent the rest of the night pacing around the apartment, tracing my hands over the walls, tearing everything apart, with little reason. I was just trying to find something, anything. A spare phone, a knife, something. Nothing. My apartment was me proof. Trying to stand in front of the window to get the attention of anyone passing by would result in a full-body shock with me convulsing in pain on the floor, so I just left the blinds closed. Any attempts to open the door with a hanger yielded similar results. 

Around 12:32 AM, when I was sitting on the floor eating a bowl of dry cereal, trying to come to terms with my current predicament, once again feeling like a dog with a shock collar, I heard a noise break the otherwise silent night.

The soft, otherworldly sound of a piano, ringing through the house, muted but definitely audible. The sound was almost ghostly, seeming to eminate from anywhere I directed my attention but never loud enough where it would make sense to hear it from the entire apartment. Was it inside my head?

The soft keys played an odd, melancholic melody. The notes drew themselves out painfully long at times, and others, cut short before finishing. It went on for about five minutes, tinging my home in a quiet and lonely sadness. Then, just as soon as it started, it stopped. 

The rest of the night was spent ruminating, planning, trying to come up with something, anything. No one ever came, police or otherwise, to check on me after my screaming and banging, so either my walls are thicker than I thought or no one cares enough to try. I'm refusing to eat that burger, no real reason why. 

When the sun started to rise, I was struck with a wave of exhaustion. My eyes grew heavy almost instantly, like bags of cement. I yawned, trying to stir myself into further awakeness, but the pins and needles crept across my body, laying me back down in bed. I felt my eyes roll into the back of my head, my consciousness being chased out of my body by some alien force. It felt disgusting, intrusive, like I was a glove being fitted. I felt my own fingers twitch like newborn insects as I slipped into dreams. 

I woke up in my bed, the light of streetlamps bleeding into my bedroom. I groaned, honestly hoping that everything from my vague and hazy memories was just a dream. I rolled over and checked my phone. There was a message from an unknown number, sitting unopened on the screen.

"Can't wait to go out again! I had a really great time!"

I've been pacing around my apartment, out of ideas and feeling desperately trapped. My computer was, luckily, open to Reddit before all of this, and it seems that trying to switch off of this just results in more paralyzed pain. Maybe whatever is inside of me doesn't think I can do any harm; it hasn't seemed to care about my laptop at all. 

My head has been killing me, so I might try sleeping, even though this might be all the conscious time I get for the day. My whole body feels twitchy and off, and occasionally, I'll notice my hand clenching and unclenching without me realizing. Like someone trying on a glove.

I'm so exhausted, I can barely keep my eyes open writing all of this down. It took a night, but if it's the last record of me, the real me, then it'll be worth it.

The sun is rising soon, and I can feel it dragging me to sleep again. I can only hope I wake up for another night.
