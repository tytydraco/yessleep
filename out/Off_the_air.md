Hello, my loves. I have another tale for you.

Here at the station, there is one true dread: overtime. No one likes it. Who would? You get to work at 8 AM, you survive the long hours, the stale coffee, the hum of the fluorescents, and by the time night falls, you should be free. But no—sometimes, the hours stretch on, and before you know it, the clock reads 10 PM, then 3 AM, and you’re still there. Still breathing in the stale, recycled air.

Still trapped.

Our office is an old building with a new face. If you’ve ever played Resident Evil or House of the Dead, you know the kind of place. If not, imagine this: a towering structure, isolated, looming over the streets like it was built to keep something in. It was meant to be an aristocrat’s manor once, back when wealth meant something tangible—stone and wood and iron gates—but that was before it became a sanitarium.

Before it became something worse.

The Radcliffe Psychiatric Institute for the Insane opened its doors in 1861 and closed them just as quickly. The patients revolted, the building burned, and no one made it out. No one except five staff members, who vanished not long after. The building stood empty for decades, the kind of empty that doesn’t truly mean vacant.

Then it became WKCRP radio.

And now it’s mine.

I work the late shifts, but I don’t mind. Management is always there—he’s always there. Unlike the others, I feel safe with him around.

Usually.

But Tuesday was different.

The night started like any other. Coffee, an energy drink to keep me sharp, and a quick hug for Rhys, my Program Controller. His skin was always cold—not in a way that felt wrong, just… different. A pleasant kind of cold, the kind that keeps you grounded.

We were going through pre-show checks when the vacuum tube system clattered to life. A single slip of paper dropped into the tray. Management’s handwriting.

“Out. Handling an issue. Keep the station running.”

He never used modern tech. And he never left for long.

But that night, he was gone for three hours.

By the time the show ended, I was expecting some kind of response to my usual jab at him. A growl from the vents, a deep thud that rattled the walls. Something.

But there was nothing.

Rhys and I packed up, heading toward the exit, when we spotted Melissa, one of the night cleaners. The halls were… quiet. Not office-quiet, wrong quiet. The kind of silence that presses in, waiting for something to break it.

At 5 AM, there should have been movement—shift changes, tired greetings. But there was no one.

No one but Melissa.

And Sara.

“Shit, I left my ID,” Rhys muttered as we reached the doors.

To enter or exit the building, you need to scan your ID. Without it, you’re stuck. He turned back.

“Go ahead, I’ll be right behind you.”

I waited. Thirty minutes.

Rhys didn’t come back.

I went looking.

The studio was empty. The halls wrong. The air felt thick, charged, like walking into a room where someone had been screaming just moments before.

“Better check the break room.”

That’s when I saw it.

Standing in the emergency lights—now a dull, pulsing red—was something that wasn’t human.

A black, shifting mass, its form barely holding shape, its edges flickering like a dying film reel. And within it, faces—twisting, screaming, stretched impossibly wide before dissolving into the darkness.

Sara stood frozen in place. She didn’t run. Didn’t scream. Just stood there, shaking, lips moving in silent prayer as the thing enveloped her.

It didn’t kill her.

It took her.

Swallowed her whole, her body twisting as she was pulled into the writhing dark, until her face was just another in the mass.

I turned and ran.

I tripped—something wet. A leg.

Melissa. Or what was left of her. As she no longer had a head. But it was her I would know the ankles tattoo of Medusa anywhere. I saw her head soon after.

The thing shifted, noticing me for the first time. And as it slithered over Melissa’s remains, something awful happened—her body convulsed, her mouth opened, and she started to scream.

I ran.

I don’t remember how I got to the intern’s hallway. I don’t remember how I started pounding on the locked door, screaming for them to open up.

Eddie shoved it open just as something dark and wet and wrong slammed into him, sending him sprawling.

Rhys was running—his limp heavy, his eyes wide—and the thing took him down.

I don’t remember making it to the attic, but I did. The only place left. The only chance. The old iron gate was there—the one that Management never let us touch.

I tore it open.

Eddie—poor Eddie—didn’t make it. He stayed back, buying us time.

The thing got him.

And then it cut the rope.

The iron gate slammed shut.

The darkness pressed in.

Rhys screamed. It had him. Legs first, pulling him down, the tendrils twisting through his skin like veins turned inside-out.

A tendril snapped around my wrist, and I felt it. Not just on my skin—inside. Digging. Hollowing. Consuming.

I was slipping.

Then, just as my vision blurred—

A shadow.

A deep booming voice.

“There you are.”

And then—

Nothing.

I woke up three days later. At home. My arm burned, a twisting, jagged scar running from wrist to elbow.

Management messaged me. Texted me, of all things.

“You have a week off for your transgressions.”

No explanation. No answers. Just that.

When I returned, Rhys was in his booth.

“Thank the Old Ones you’re okay,” he said, voice rough, tired. “Management just said you were resting.”

He grabbed a crutch and pulled me into a hug. His skin was still cold.

His leg was gone.

The same leg the creature had started to devour.

“I guess Management made a deal,” he murmured laughing.

I turned to him, to his tired eyes, his too-calm smile. As I was leaving. 

I didn’t say anything. Just walked to the break room, the scent of coffee grounding me.

And that’s when I saw it.

The memoriam board.

Eddie.

Sara.

Melissa.

Rhys.
