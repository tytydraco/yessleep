   Okay, hello again everyone, this is Xander, and I have a touch more to share with you all. First and foremost, I do not think that fucker was a Wendigo, it seems like something similar, just way more screwed up, like an inbred cousin of the thing. I decided a day or two after my initial post that I should try to bury it, at least get it out of sight from the trail for my own sanity's sake, but I couldn't lift the damned thing. I was really putting my legs into it, but it was like trying to deadlift a small car, it'd budge and rock, but never really move. It's arm alone must have weighed nearly as much as a small tree; I had to squat and use both hands just to move it to the side. Now that I've had a bit of time to pull myself together, I took a better look at its mouth, more specifically its abyss of a throat. It looked like it went down far further than it should, so I did the only reasonable thing; I poked a stick into it. To my horror, the 2-foot-long stick easily went in without hitting its throat, so I got a branch that was about 5 feet long and got the same result. 

   This thing is... bigger than it looks. I took some measuring tape and tarted feeding it down towards the back of its throat, and ran out before it touched anything, so it's at least got about 50 feet of space behind its teeth. I would say that it's impossible, that I screwed something up in my less-than-precise testing, but at this point I'm resigned to the idea that I killed some Lovecraftian wet dream crammed into the shape of a naked crackhead, so impossible doesn't even exist to me anymore. I threw a tarp over the thing and tossed rocks around its edges to keep the wind from uncovering it. The more I look at it the less sane I feel. 

   The hunger has been getting worse, I stocked up enough for at least a month, but here I am a few weeks in and already had to restock because I ate every morsel I could find or hunt. It's to the point where I need a full day and a half worth of food just to stop my stomach from growling in the morning. A few days after my initial post, I noticed something while I was chopping up some firewood; I was splitting every log in a single swing. That may not sound like much, but if you've ever split logs before, you know it almost always takes a good few strikes to crack it clean in half. I'm far from weak, go to the gym when I'm not on vacation pretty frequently, but I'm not that kind of strong. I think eating the way I have been is giving me more energy or muscle mass or something, because just today I tried again to move the creature's corpse, and I was able to move the arm much easier, but I still can't quite move the thing far. 

   I have plans to dig a grave soon, and just drag the cunt over bit by bit when I have more energy, but for now its still there under the tarp, just as pale and bloody as before. I saw that there's a chance for snow tomorrow, so I don't feel like starting to dig when it might just fill up with snow and become a whole new pain in the ass. I'm sorry that I don't have much to update you all on besides that, and that I take a while to respond to anything, internet is slow way out here. If anyone can think of a good next move, or has any idea what happening to me, please tell me. I have no clue what I'm doing, and I don't think I'll be able to function normally once my vacation is over.
