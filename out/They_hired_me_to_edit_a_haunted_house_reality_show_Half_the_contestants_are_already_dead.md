Nope. Nope nope nope. This place is fucked. And I mean capital F *fucked”. My career is probably done if I make it out of here.

Jacob died today. For sure died, I saw it happen. He had been staying in his room since the dining room incident, almost catatonic after seeing it. Can’t say I blamed him, considering the damned thing almost got to me too over the monitor. The others were trying to check on him, but he didn’t really want anything to do with the rest. At some point, he turned on the TV, though Saul and Shana only allowed a couple of streaming services for entertainment.

Look I’m not one to judge someone's taste in movies or anything, and I don’t want to speak ill of the dead. That said, the Spawn movie from the nineties was… a hell of a choice. Maybe it was a comfort thing, who knows?

He didn’t make it far before the television started glitching out, screen pixelating. I was watching the other camera at the moment, but it caught my eye when the pixelation started because it was extending out of the TV. Spawn was still playing, yet this thing was somehow moving through the actual space in front of the television. 

There wasn’t even a way to tell what the hell it was. Just pixelation in the air, constantly changing colors like a digital stream. I was fixated, wanting to shout and wake him up but frozen in my seat, blood running cold. It felt like this thing was aware of me, like I was being watched as some kind of… dare? I couldn’t shake the chill that was settling over me, making me shake from the cold.

It kept extending from the television, stopping right before the bed as Jacob stared in total horror. He must have been as frozen as I was, sitting with his mouth open but no scream coming out. Crawling backward, pressing himself into the wall wasn’t enough to save him. The pixels stopped for a moment before leaping forward immediately toward him. I saw his face open in shock as it pierced his chest, lifting him against the wall as it rose up. He grabbed at it, only clawing at the glimmering air in front of him. 

The tendril suddenly retreated back into the television, snapping Jacob back with it. I saw his body fold in half backward as it hit the edge of the television, the tendril still pulling on him. Over the mics I could hear his spine snapping, probably ending any pain he might have felt if he was still alive. As the tendril moved back from the television, yanking him back one more time to make sure everything came through. Indy must have heard the bump, because she ran in out of breath from the next room over.

What she found was an empty room, shitty movie still playing on the television, with no trace that anyone was there otherwise. The sheets were bunched up like they had been left behind that morning in a rush, but otherwise, everything was in place. Indy stood in front of the television, back to it, looking at the bed where Jacob once was. I was breathless, unsure of what to do while watching things go down. Neither Saul nor Shana were here right now, either, so there was nobody in the room with me to tell to go help. I was afraid that if I looked away from the camera something else would happen.

Whatever happened didn’t wait until I looked away though. Indy was grabbed by the neck, and yanked backwards through the television in a somehow less violent matter than Jacob. She was gone in seconds, nothing to mark she was there. Three contestants were now gone, with no clue where the fuck they may have gone. 

I called Saul freaking out, and of course, it went to his damn voicemail. Okay, try Shana next… nothing. Fucking voicemail again except this time I got an “inbox full” message with it. I looked up from my phone, trying to see if anything had changed on the screen. Another figure was standing in the room now. Not one I recognized though, someone dressed a few decades out of style, tall, with messy brown hair falling over thick glasses. 

He turned to me, lifting a finger to his lips in a hush sign, looking directly through the camera at me. Pixelation hit again and he disappeared, totally gone with nothing left. Shana finally called me back then, asking what was so frantic that I called both of them (super bitchy in hindsight). Then she told me that I’m freaking out over nothing AGAIN, emphasizing that they’re in control of everything and will handle any issues that happen. She reminded me that they have preplanned scares that will mess with the guests, but that’s not reassuring AT ALL. When I tried pressing her to give me a list of scares so I could at least be prepared, she said she didn’t want me spoiling it for any of the contestants left.  

This has to be a prank on me, right? One of those hidden camera reality shows, but on some meta-level where I’m the joke? I don’t like it, even if it’s not some cruel joke. There’s no way the sound I heard his back make was fake.

I finally made the decision. Not going to lie I was kind of expecting the outcome, but it is what it is I guess. I called the police, and told them I had just witnessed a possible murder, and they were on their way. Took probably two hours for them to get there, even then. Gotta love the police system in America.

When they finally got there, Saul had arrived around the same time. He intercepted them before I even realized they were there, pulling up to the main house and waiting at the doorway like a goddamn realtor ready to make the sale. He assured the cops that there was nothing wrong, showed them the filming permits, and laughed it off saying that maybe they would make it on television. That seemed to get one of them pretty excited, saying his wife would be so jealous to hear. Then they got back in the squad car and left. Not a thing was done, nobody in the house was even aware of what had happened.

Saul came up to the editing trailer after they left, a look of disappointment on his face like I was a kid caught sneaking out. This jackass gave me a legitimate “I’m not mad, just disappointed” speech and told me I could go for the day, he would take over. I want to leave. I want to get the hell out of this place, I don’t like anything that’s going on. There’s this constant feeling of cold on my skin that won’t go away, like I’ve got permanent goosebumps. Hair standing on end as if I was in the middle of a storm of static. Nothing made it go away.

I can’t leave though. I can’t let the three left in there meet the same fate. I’m going to do something about it, but I’ll have to wait until Saul and Shana are gone to do anything. If I get out of this I’ll update, wish me [luck](https://www.reddit.com/user/googlyeyes93/comments/1efyman/strays_chapter_masterlist/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
