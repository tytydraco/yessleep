This will be my final update.  
  
Last night, my dad and I talked for hours about, well, everything.  
  
“I’m not going to hide things from you anymore,” I said, pulling out my phone. “I took photos of the wardrobe.”  
  
Dad calmly took my phone and started scrolling through the photos I’d taken.  
  
“Oh, God…” Dad cried, pushing the phone back into my hands.  
  
“Do you think…” I started, gulping. “Do you think he’s responsible for… Mum?”  
  
Dad winced sharply. “Cara, I… I don’t want to… I don’t know whether I can grieve for your mother twice.”  
  
I understand why he’d prefer to believe that Mum took her own life, rather than believe that someone took it from her. And perhaps I don’t want the police to uncover the truth either. Perhaps I’m done grieving too. But what I will say is that Mum’s death in 2018, though seemingly self-inflicted, was unfathomably awful. A mangled corpse in a car wreck. And I can’t help but wonder why she’d want to end her life so painfully.  
  
Anyway, I had the day off work — given the circumstances — and I spent it flicking through my photos, searching for answers. I couldn’t stop thinking about the photo of me sleeping in my university dorm room.  
  
He’s always watching.  
  
That’s what Grandma said in her note. Maybe he travelled to and from their Devon hideout at first, but he likely didn’t ever return after killing his wife and leaving her there.  
  
So, where is he now? I wondered in horror, scrolling back and forth through my photos.  
  
There was a picture of Mum driving on the motorway — a picture Grandad had taken whilst he was driving too. In it, I could see the dashboard of his car and his left hand on the steering wheel — with his wrist donning a shiny, golden Rolex. But most importantly, he’d captured his BMW’s askew hood ornament — distinctly askew.  
  
A sinking feeling consumed me.  
  
“Dad…” I said.  
  
My dad lifted his head from the newspaper. “Yes?”  
  
“Is this the car you're always complaining about…?” I asked, showing him the photo.  
  
My dad’s eyes widened, and he slowly nodded at me, face turning a ghostly shade. For the past few years, he’d been moaning, on and off, about spotting a BMW with that exact shabby ornament around our village. Parked in places that it shouldn’t be parked. But it always moved before he could do anything about it.  
  
“I think we need to call the police,” He said.  
  
I nodded, feeling more than a little queasy. Dad couldn’t remember when or where he’d last seen the vehicle. As I said, my dad’s memory is awful. But I was sure it was only a month or so ago that he moaned about it being parked on a double-yellow line around the corner from our street.  
  
That meant Grandad had been here for years.  
  
Am I one of his victims or not? I wondered, continuing to scroll through the photos whilst my dad talked to the police. Every photo of my mother and me had been taken at night. He used the flash-light on his phone or the headlights of his car to illuminate his surroundings. And that made me think of other unusual things from the past few years.  
  
For instance, I often forget to draw my curtains before bed — foolish, given that I’m a light sleeper. And since lockdown, I can think of numerous occasions on which I was rudely awakened in the early hours of the morning. A car’s blinding full-beam headlights would fill my small room. Every time, I’d grumpily get up and draw my curtains. That wouldn't completely block out the light from the road, but the car, strangely, would always drive away shortly afterwards.  
  
As if there were no point in staying without being able to see through my window.  
  
Another unusual thing comes to mind when I think of that dreaded photo Grandad took in my dorm room. Could he have been watching me sleep back home?  
  
I’m a forgetful person. I think we’ve established that. But at least once a week, I’ve been waking in the morning to find my bedroom door ever-so-slightly ajar. And I’m fairly certain I rarely forget to close it. That terrifies me more than anything. The thought that he has been in our house. Close enough to touch me.  
  
“Thank you, officer,” My dad said, hanging up the phone and turning to me. “They’re going to keep an eye out for a car that matches the description. As for the broader investigation into his location, they’re looking into missing person cases from recent years. The detective is going to come over here personally and talk to us about moving somewhere safer — somewhere Grandad can’t find us.”  
  
“Won’t Grandad just follow us?” I asked, trembling.  
  
Dad hugged me. “I know you’re scared, Cara, but it’s going to be okay. The police have it under control.”  
  
As we waited for Detective Simon Smith — I’m not using his real name, for obvious reasons — all I could think about was the fact that the police didn’t seem to have anything under control. They’d known of this horror for fourteen years, and they were no closer to solving anything.  
  
Anyway, I wasn't expecting a dingy, brown Ford Focus to pull onto our driveway. I suppose detectives in TV shows and films lead a more glamorous lifestyle. The man who exited the car must’ve been in his early thirties, though his coarse skin aged him. He had thinning, damaged hair, but a neatly-trimmed beard. He wore a smart, grey trench coat and black gloves. In that way, he seemed to conform to Hollywood stereotypes of the typical detective.  
  
“Nice to see you again, John,” He said, shaking hands with my dad.  
  
“Same to you, Simon,” Dad replied. “What’s it been, four years?”  
  
Simon nodded. “About that, yes. I’m sorry it’s been so long since I’ve had anything to tell you. The case was, admittedly, gathering dust until yesterday’s discovery. And this is our hero, Cara, I presume?”  
  
I nodded my head, shaking his hand.  
  
“I’m really sorry, Cara,” Simon said sombrely. “What you saw in that house was... something nobody should ever have to see. But you’re incredibly brave and undoubtedly smart. Perhaps a career in detective work is on the cards for you?”  
  
I smiled weakly.  
  
“Right, well, I think the first thing we should do is find alternative accommodation for the two of you. How does that sound?” Simon asked.  
  
“But my Grandad will just follow us,” I protested.  
  
“He won’t, I assure you,” Simon replied. “I’ll be checking my tail the whole way.”  
  
“How long will we have to stay away?” My dad asked. “What if you never find my father?”  
  
Simon shook his head. “We’ll find him, John. Don’t you worry. You’ve both been a massive help with this investigation. We’ve already found a BMW matching your description on numerous recent CCTV tapes from business owners in town. I don’t think it’ll be long before he rears his ugly head.”  
  
Realising that arguing was futile, I went upstairs and packed a bag. And ten minutes later, with our most important belongings in hand, we walked with Detective Smith to his battered Ford Focus.  
  
“So, where are you taking us?” Dad asked as we clambered inside and buckled our seatbelts.  
  
“A Travelodge in Manchester,” Simon replied. “With any luck, we’ll have him before the end of the week.”  
  
As we set off, I watched my quaint little village roll by the passenger-side window. The sun was setting, but the sky was still a calming blue — a settled, safe world surrounded me, in contrast to the rainy, chaotic few days which preceded it.  
  
“So, how did you do it, Cara?” Simon asked.  
  
I looked away from the window. “What?”  
  
“How did you figure out where to find your grandad?” He asked.  
  
I shrugged, nervously locking eyes with Simon in the rear-view mirror. “Grandma left clues.”  
  
Simon chuckled, parroting what I’d said. “Grandma left clues… Remarkable. I’m serious, you really should join the force. You’re a damn sight better at this than me.”  
  
It was as the car turned sharply onto a country road that I first noticed it. The sleeve of Simon’s trench coat lifted as he steered to the left, and it revealed something beneath his black glove.  
  
A golden Rolex.  
  
My stomach immediately lurched.  
  
“Won’t this way take us longer, Simon? We should’ve turned right to head towards Manchester,” My dad pointed out.  
  
Simon didn’t reply. And we very suddenly found ourselves on a bumpy, disused road, dwarfed on either side by towering oak trees. The daylight was fading, and I found myself gripped by unimaginable terror — completely unable to say anything. Unable to process what I'd seen.  
  
“Simon? Where are we going?” Dad asked.  
  
“Dad…” I finally managed to croak. “I want to go home.”  
  
“You are home, Cara,” Simon finally replied.  
  
He brought the Ford Focus to a stop in the middle of a wooded clearing. Far from civilisation. Far from anything but a small, lightless shack of a house. And then there was a clicking noise.  
  
“What...?” My dad began.  
  
“Get out of the car,” Simon replied, pointing what I realised to be a handgun at my father.  
  
“What the fuck is—” My dad continued.  
  
“— I won’t tell you again,” Simon warned.  
  
As my dad shakily opened the door and stepped outside, Simon turned the gun onto me. His eyes were suddenly as untamed as his hair.  
  
“You too, Detective,” He said. “Get the fuck out.”  
  
My dad opened the door for me, and we embraced as Simon quickly got out of the driver’s side, pointing the gun at both of us.  
  
“Walk in front of me,” He ordered. “Head towards the front door, and don’t run.”  
  
As we walked, I didn’t dare look back at the lunatic. I huddled closely to my dad and prayed that the nightmare would end. We could barely see our feet in the pitch-black forest, but we managed to stumble towards the front path of the shack.  
  
“Open the door, John,” Simon said.  
  
My dad lightly pushed the rickety wooden door, and it opened onto a black chasm.  
  
“Move!” Simon growled.  
  
“We can’t see,” My dad said.  
  
Something prodded me in the back, and I turned slightly to see a torch in Simon’s spare hand. He eyed me coldly until I took it. I was afraid to turn it on because part of me already knew what I would see. But it was worse. So much worse than the caravan.  
  
My dad yelled, but I didn’t voice my terror. Of course, I was certainly just as horrified to be faced with rotten walls, mostly covered in brown hair, but it was exactly what I expected. What I hadn’t expected was the floors — stained a dark brownish or reddish colour. I think I know what it must have been, but there was just so much of it. Too much of it.  
  
“I’ll let you in on a secret,” Simon gleefully whispered in my ear, pointing at the walls. “Underneath that soft, silky, brown blanket, you’ll find a sturdy under-layer of smooth, skin-covered plaster.”  
  
I uttered an involuntary yelp.  
  
Simon giggled. “Don’t worry, Cara. It decays, as do all beautiful things. We can always go downstairs for more… But don’t you worry about Downstairs.”  
  
My dad and I embraced one another again.  
  
“Head to the end of the corridor,” Simon barked.  
  
“What are you doing, Simon?” My dad asked as we walked along the hair-walled, bloody-floored hallway through an empty, derelict bungalow.  
  
“Don’t ask me,” Simon replied, nodding at the door ahead.  
  
I shone the torch on the door handle, and my dad obliged Simon’s request, twisting it. As the door lightly creaked open, I cast the light above my father’s shoulder, not daring to squeeze past him — I hid in fear. And my father’s gasp told me that greater horrors lurked inside the following room.  
  
“Dad…” My father gasped.  
  
I stepped inside, knees quaking, and found myself standing in a living room much like the one in Grandad’s caravan. It was coated, much like the corridor, with interlaced hair blankets — every wall, floor, and furnishing. Everything but the fireplace, which burnt brightly enough for me to finally turn off the torch.  
  
And then there was the man himself, sitting atop a brown-haired throne with its back to the fire. My grandfather.  
  
The Bogeyman.  
  
But he was barely a shadow. 80 years old, at the very least, and he was an emaciated, skeletal man. How could such a pale, weak thing strike so much fear in me?   
  
“*Sit*,” Grandad wheezed.  
  
Simon prodded the gun into each of our backs, and he shut the door behind us. My father and I sat on the soft, hairy floor, and it took every ounce of my willpower not to projectile-vomit again.  
  
My dad was crying. “Why are you doing this to us, Dad? We’re your family.”  
  
“Family...” Grandad repeated thoughtfully.  
  
He was little more than a silhouette with the fireplace behind him. A dark outline. A faceless monster. And before Grandad could elaborate, Simon walked to the side of his master’s throne.  
  
“You really don’t know who I am, do you, John?” Simon laughed, prodding the gun aggressively in my direction. “Why don’t you tell her about her mother? Your slut of a wife.”  
  
Simon laughed manically, and the light of the crackling flames danced across his scruffy, patchy head of brunette hair.  
  
“What are you talking about?” Dad asked in a croaky whisper.  
  
“What are you talking about?” Simon mocked. “You and Rachel. You were 16 and in love. It was the graduation prom. Your whore passed out and got knocked up.”  
  
Dad had tears in his eyes, and he turned to me. “She was raped, Cara. We didn’t want you to know… We wanted to spare you that story. It was long before you came along.”  
  
My father weaved his fingers into mine, gripping my hand tightly. I managed a smile and nodded through my tears. This seemed to anger Simon.  
  
“Look at me…” Simon said.  
  
But Dad didn't.  
  
“*Look at me, you coward!*” The psychopath screamed, suddenly unloading a round into the wall.  
  
The deafening roar of the handgun petrified me. I shrieked, squeezing the life out of my father’s hand. Dad quickly lifted his head to lock eyes with the crazed man standing before us.  
  
“Tell her,” Simon said calmly. “Tell her who I am.”  
  
Dad’s eyes widened, and he shook his head, finally having come to a realisation.  
  
“Yes, John,” Simon said. “It’s me. The rotten... thing that the two of you simply discarded at an orphanage. 34 years ago. A helpless baby. Abandoned by my mother and my…”  
  
Simon paused, smiling slightly.  
  
“… Brother,” Grandad finished.  
  
Silence filled the air as my grandfather’s single word coursed through the room. The horror of the revelation struck me before my brain had even caught up.  
  
“What do you mean?” My dad whispered, though I knew he’d heard and understood, just as I had.  
  
“He saved me,” Simon said. “Father saved me from the dump in which you left me.”  
  
“Father…?” My dad cried, shaking violently.  
  
“She was perfect, your Rachel,” Grandad coughed. “Her hair. Perfect. When your mother grew old... Rachel became the new key to my pure bloodline.”  
  
Dad, face smeared with tears, started to wail. And I simply continued to tremble. This was far more terrible than anything I ever could have imagined.  
  
“Don’t cry, Brother,” Simon whispered. “Your pain won’t last long. You’ll join the wall soon.”  
  
“Patience, Son,” Grandad croaked as loudly as he could muster. “There is an order to these things.”  
  
“Sorry, Father,” Simon whimpered. “The Catalogue?”  
  
Grandad nodded lightly, and his son — brother to both my father and me — scurried out of the room in fear. The man on the vile throne then cast his gaze to me. With his back to the flames, I could scarcely see his face, but I caught a glimmer of something in the demon’s eyes. Joy, perhaps. A demented form of joy.  
  
“Cara,” He muttered. “There is another thing I have longed to tell you. Something your... father doesn't know. Come closer.”  
  
Lip quivering, I crawled across the floor, releasing my father’s hand, and stopped inches in front of my grandad’s throne. The man unfurled one of his shaky fists, caressing my cheek with terrifyingly gnarled, inhuman fingers. He leaned forwards to whisper in my ear, and his following words will haunt me to end of my days.  
  
“You are Rachel’s daughter, but you are also a child of *my* purest bloodline,” He groaned. “You will inherit my gift soon enough.”  
  
I still want to pretend I misinterpreted him. But I know I didn't. I understood him perfectly. He was never my grandad.  
  
He was my father.  
  
I crawled backwards, horrified and disbelieving eyes stretched wide. I crawled straight into my real father’s warm, comforting arms. How did this monster rape my mother twice? Sweets, I imagine. And now I fear what he might have been doing to me in my sleep over the years.  
  
“Why did you kill her?” My dad blubbered.  
  
Grandad sighed, though it was little more than a strained wheeze. “All perfect things must be preserved in The Catalogue. Otherwise, they tarnish.”  
  
Simon re-entered the room, and I turned to see that he was holding a Polaroid camera in his free hand.  
  
“They’re ready to be catalogued, Father, and—” Simon began.  
  
Everything happened quickly. My father, utilising Simon’s brief moment of distraction, sprang towards him. He propelled from the floor with such speed and force that, when he collided with the detective, the two of them hurtled through the open doorway into the main corridor. And my grandad — if I should even call him that anymore — howled like a wounded wolf, supporting himself on the armrests of his throne and attempting to stand.  
  
I don’t know what overcame me. But my body moved before my mind had even registered the situation. I lurched forwards and roughly thrust my hands into my grandfather’s bony, shrivelled chest. He felt cold. Even by the fire, he felt cold.  
  
He and his throne of matted hair fell into the inferno, and he screeched at a piercing volume as the flames ensnared him. I stood in a frozen position, witnessing a truly horrifying spectacle of burning hair, flesh, and whatever else formed the Bogeyman. But it was all over far quicker than I expected. He was reduced to a charred mess, concealed by flame.  
  
“Father!” I heard Simon splutter in pain.  
  
I turned to see my dad knelt on the madman’s chest, launching punch after punch into his bloody, bruised face.  
  
“Cara!” Dad shouted, not taking his eyes off the monster he was bludgeoning to death. “Call the police!”  
  
I quickly scooped my phone out of my pocket, dialled 999, and the rest is a blur.  
  
My dad managed to stop just short of killing Simon. I had nightmares of the detective’s corrupt fellow police officers bailing him out and arresting us instead, but they swiftly surrounded the house and apprehended Simon without a moment’s hesitation. I hope he never sees the light of day, but perhaps we should have pushed him in the fire too.  
  
Is that my Grandad speaking? Have I inherited his insane bloodlust as he promised?  
  
I think I eyed the fireplace in a trance for a good hour or so. Eventually, I managed to pull my gaze away and leave with my father. Though there was nothing of Grandad left at that point, I just had to be sure I'd burnt him to ashes. He spent so many years living in the shadows — an immortal spectre that watched us night and day. I suppose I’ll never *truly* believe that he’s gone for good.  
  
After all, the Bogeyman is dead, but his bloodline lives.
