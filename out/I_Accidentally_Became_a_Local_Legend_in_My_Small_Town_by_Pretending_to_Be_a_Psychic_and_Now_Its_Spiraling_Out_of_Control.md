Okay, Reddit, I need to get this off my chest because I’ve dug myself into the weirdest hole, and I don’t know how to get out of it without ruining my reputation or breaking a bunch of hearts.  



It all started as a joke. I live in a tiny town where everyone knows everyone, and gossip spreads faster than wildfire. One day, my friend Sarah was stressing about her love life and jokingly said, “I wish I could just \*know\* if Jake likes me or not.” Without thinking, I said, “Oh, I can tell you. I’m kind of… psychic.”  



I don’t know why I said it. Maybe I was bored, maybe I thought it would be funny. But Sarah’s eyes lit up, and she begged me to “read” her. So, I made up some vague stuff about how Jake was definitely into her but was shy, and she needed to make the first move. She believed every word.  



A week later, Sarah and Jake were officially dating, and she told everyone I was the reason they got together. Suddenly, people started coming to me for “readings.” At first, it was just friends, and I kept it light—stuff like, “You’re going to find $20 soon” or “Your cat is plotting something, but it’s fine.” But then word spread to the rest of the town.  



Now, I’m getting calls from strangers asking me to predict their futures. The local bakery even asked me to bless their new oven so it wouldn’t burn the bread. I tried to back out of it, but they looked so hopeful that I caved and waved my hands around the oven while muttering nonsense. Apparently, it worked because their bread has been perfect ever since.  



The breaking point was when the mayor’s wife asked me to help find her lost wedding ring. I panicked and said it was “near water.” She found it in her sink the next day and now thinks I’m a miracle worker.  



I’m not a psychic. I’m just a regular person who made a dumb joke that spiraled out of control. But now, the whole town thinks I have supernatural powers, and I’m terrified of letting them down. I’ve thought about coming clean, but I don’t want to disappoint everyone or make them feel stupid for believing me.  



So, Reddit, what do I do? Do I keep up the act and hope no one asks me to predict the lottery numbers? Or do I come clean and risk becoming the town pariah?  



TL;DR: Jokingly pretended to be a psychic, accidentally became a local legend, and now I don’t know how to stop without ruining my reputation. Help.
