19 and pure the last of the I don't care years, The end of an era as many would say but nobody could foresee it being the end of all relationships for young Alex and me. The year was 2017 and I was a freshman 3 months into my new adventure on life college not the first place I wanted to be spending the last of my teen days but myself and Alex had each other to stay afloat friends since virtually birth there was nothing that could separate us. We spent many days alone in are college dorm bord looking for that next party that next adventure we were not the outgoing type we were very shy in our own right so when the day came that we got our invitations to one of the biggest parties of the year neither one of us really knew what to make of it.



However, considering the fact we were both virgins and never really got invited to anything we took this opportunity as a sign of hope to mainly meet girls but also to once and for all break free from the social anxiety we both suffered from since our youth years. We spent the remaining days leading up to this party deciding what to wear what to talk about how we were going to get girls all of that but deep down we were scared. We were scared of what awaited us outside of this dorm would it go to plan would it go horribly wrong only time could tell.



Finally, the night was here like a blur the last 3 days just rushed by like they never happened. The clock striked 8pm and we knew it was time for us to say goodbye to the comfort and safety of our dorms and proceed into the world that we knew so little about. Like a bird leaving its nest for the first time me and Alex swung our door open and proceeded to the north side of the campus where the party was happening.



After a brief walk and a lot of anxiety we finally reached the north side of the campus where a large building now stood before us. Me and Alex both looked at each other before proceeding to the front stairs of the building breathing heavily, we proceeded up the stairs pushing a large door open as we entered the overcrowded room. We both just stared in amazement as there was hundreds of teens drinking and talking together, we felt so alive but also worried.



The night went on normally we were no doubt 4 hours in at this point and have had a few drinks as I haven't even noticed Alex was missing until I was tapped on the shoulder and led to a room by a girl who I soon figured out was having "Relations" with Alex. The next thing I can recall was waking up in a bed nude with the girl next to me and the cops clearing the house. I looked over to wake Alex, but he was not there it was just me and the girl, confused i got up to grab my clothes and stumbled into the hall no doubt still drunk.



I ran into an officer who I then gave my description of Alex to as I looked everywhere and could find him the officer simply took the description from me and told me to go back to my dorm. Doing so I believed that Alex would be there to tell me how messed up I looked and how it felt to lose the v card together. However, he was not there, and his stuff was gone as if he was never there to begin with. I must have passed out as the next time I woke up it was morning, hung over and still dizzy I left the room to go to our administrative building.



However, when I reported Alex missing, I was told there was no student with that first or last name enrolled at this school. Now more confused than I already was I asked her then what happened to my roommate why do I remember Alex if you say there is no such student. She looked at me for a moment before proceeding to tell me that I was alone and that there was no roommate assigned to my dorm.



It was safe to say at this point that I lost my mind with her. I walked away cursing as I left the building finally falling to my knees and crying, I looked at my phone to get his number to call him to tell him that this prank wasn't funny and that it has gone too far but his number it wasn't there.



June 20th, 2021 was the day I said goodbye to that campus however I never gave up on finding Alex until June 21st that is. On June 21st 2021 I was cleaning out my locker after being given 1 extra day to clean our stuff out when I found it a note that said look in the library signed A.F 2/14/17. It was from the day he vanished it was his handwriting alright and his initial's. Excitement filled me as I rushed to the library thinking if this was some joke, I got so many questions and then I might even punch him that jerk I thought to myself.



However, when getting to the library I did not find Alex as I hoped instead, I found a yearbook sitting on the far back table marked February 14th, 1999. Confused I opened it to the bookmarked page and in red marker a photo was circled "Alex Foster" A cold breeze ran down my back and the pages flipped to the back of the book. A message in red it said "Use Me"



There layed a flash drive without thinking I popped it into the desktop and read the article it linked to. "On February 14th, 1999, police were called to the north campus of the local community college, where a boy later revealed as 19-year-old Alex Foster a freshman that was new to the campus was hanging from the alpha beta's frat house upper deck. Police report seeing claw marks across the teen's chest and legs indicating a struggle with some kind of animal. Police inquire locals about leads into the murder of the freshman, but nobody came forward and no arrests have been made was ever arrested. It still remains one of the towns biggest cold cases if you have any information, you are to call the local PD."



I could not believe what I was reading a tear formed down my face as I read it. What I was reading just couldn't be true my best friend my only friend was never real. NO!! I refuse to believe it I was later removed from campus by security as I tore the library apart in what my doctors now explain was a mental break down, they tell me I made all of it up, but I still remember him to this day, and I refuse to forget him. 4 teens have gone missing from there every year sense I found the truth I wonder if it's cursed as each disappearance has happened on valentine's day. I really may never know the truth but I'm never going to stop looking either.
