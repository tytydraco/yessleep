Hello, everyone.

My name is Sheryl. I am 71 years old and I live in a small rural town in Montana. I posted this in r/DIY last week, but they recommended I post it here instead.

Every October my house is filled with the most disgusting rotten smell and I get a lot of flies. I can smell it on both floors and it makes me want to vomit. It seems like it’s coming from under the sink, but bleaching didn’t help at all. Sometimes it is so thick I can taste it, like I’m being suffocated by a dirty rag. It clings to my hair and clothes. People at church have begun to look at me strangely.

I called my son and he said it could be a dead animal or rotten food, but I don't think it is. The smell only lasts a week. It usually starts around halfway through the month and ends just after November begins.

Also, it doesn’t only smell like something rotten. Sometimes it reminds me of my curling iron, like the steam that comes off my hair when I leave it in place for too long.

My son told me to check something called the P traps under the sink, but I don’t know how. My husband used to do all of the repairs around the house. He used to do the repairs for the church too, even though he was the pastor. He passed away a year ago from Covid and said he couldn’t smell it.

It bothered me even before he got sick. He said it was all in my head. I remember the first time it came-- he went quiet that night and wouldn’t let me open the bathroom door.

It was strange that he couldn’t smell it. He could still taste my cooking enough to complain, but the Doctor says sometimes that happens with Covid.

I tried to follow a YouTube video on how to open P traps, but water got everywhere. I had to use my nice towels to clean it up. They’re ruined now because they got an oily black stain on them that won’t wash out, no matter how many times I run them through the machine.

My son lives several states away, so he can’t come check the pipes for me. He refuses to visit ever since he got in an argument with my husband about what happened to that neighborhood boy. My husband did some things that I am not proud of, but God is forgiving. Still, sometimes when the house settles at night, I think I can hear the boy’s delighted screams when he still played in the church’s halls.

I called a plumber, but he is booked out until late November and the smell will be gone by then.

I opened the windows and lit candles to hide the smell, but no one visits anymore. I miss the company. The church ladies used to stop by after I fell last year, but I think the smell drove them off.

There is a bathroom connected to my late husband’s office. The drain in there hasn’t drained right for several years, no matter how much my husband used to plunge it. I don’t go in there often, so when I did last year, the smell was very strong. I started feeling sick and dizzy, and I tripped on the rug on the way out of the bathroom. I broke my hip and I haven’t been up there since.

The smell started up again yesterday, and I swear it is stronger than it was last year. It settles in my throat and stings my lungs. I can hardly breathe without feeling sick.

Also, when I went to the bathroom last night, the cabinets were warm. The pipes beneath were so hot I didn’t dare touch them. The water came out boiling from the tap, so hot it steamed and hissed against the sink. I thought of Hell when I saw it.

I am not sure what to do. If you have any advice on what it could be or what I should do, please reply. My house is from the 1800s, if it helps. I’ve been praying the smell will go away, but maybe it’s not supposed to. What if God is punishing me?
