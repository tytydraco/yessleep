Have you ever awakened a sleeping person? 

When I was younger, my sister would often sleepwalk, and my mother told me never to wake her. 

I learned my lesson. 

It’s dangerous, she told me, it can cause her mental issues…as if she hadn’t already. 

We shared a room, a bunk bed, but it wasn’t a standard one. It was two separate beds. The bottom bed had its own bulky white frame, the wood slowly being consumed by termites. It had a drawer under it the size of the frame. I remember it dearly because that’s where I stuffed my mess when my mother scolded us to clean up. The top “bunk” was a wooden home project my dad made for us to try to conserve space in our small room. It was painted this obnoxious teal color that got dirty easily, and it wasn’t appropriately sanded, so the surfaces were coarse to the touch. There were makeshift shelves that were behind the deadly ladder that I swore God was holding together from how weak they were under our weight. 

Well, I stayed on the bottom bunk for most of our childhood. I was the eldest, I fought, and victoriously won the right of passage to sleep on the bottom bunk. And my parents figured if my sister slept on the bunk, it would help deter her from sleeping as much. 

I'm sure anyone who sleptwalked or knew someone who did knew we were far from correct. 

My sister, Luci, no older than seven, was a stare-er. She…she just stared at first. Luci would sneak up on me, and well, to be fair, I was a deep sleeper, and walk to my parents' bedroom. Their room was a reasonable distance from ours, past our front family area, past the kitchen, and then turning a sharp left into our parents' main bedroom. Luci would often stare at my father first since his side was the closest to the door. 

HE would awake with a gasp or a sharp breath, with her eyes soulless and blank as her mouth muttered things he couldn’t hear properly. He never woke her, though, he’d ease her back into our room, and she somehow either get back on the top bunk or snuggle with me against my will. 

Since I grew up with it, it didn’t bother me as much as it did my family. I just kinda ignored it most of the time. I wasn’t the best older sister, but I was tired, and I was going to sleep if it were the last thing I’d do.

I’d often awake to her screaming, crying, or even just speaking a bit too loudly in her sleep. I’d tell her “Luci, shut it,” and drift back to sleep, cuddling my dog or my pillow. Sometimes, to stop her from leaving the room, I'd put little doll toys or Polly Pocket dolls with their arms facing up so if she stepped on it, Luci would awake by herself with a sharp ‘Ow!’ 

Again, I wasn’t the best older sister because I’d laugh at her yelp and once again drift back to sleep. I was mean, I know, but since the first night we shared a room, she was like this. I used to think Luci had always been like that. I don’t anymore. There was a night I don’t like to think about, and everything changed after it.

Anyway, due to my sister's state of terror, I never got scared easily. I’d just awake to find her gone, climbing down, or her yelp when she stepped onto the small toy pieces. If anything, the only scary thing was my sister ruining my sleep. 

Then one night, I woke up to her hovering over me. She has never done that before. Not once all those years. Her dead eyes were not really looking at me…more past me. Her mouth hung slightly open, and drool dripped down, hitting my cheek. I cringed, wiping it away, and was about to shout out to her before I remembered my mother telling me “never wake a sleeping person.” I stopped myself, still frustrated, before getting up and slowly putting her into my bed, too tired to try and get her up the bunk. 

She slowly went in, crawling under my covers. Literally, crawling underneath. Like on all fours scattering under like some cockroach trying flee its fate. Luci’s body was entirely under my blankets, the kid-sized lump in my bed made my tired eyes confused. But at this point, I just wanted to go back to bed, and I did for about 30 minutes till I felt something nearly push me off. I got up, half expecting her to be staring at me once again, but no, instead, she was looking out the window. 

My bed was right under my window; it was an 8x8 window, and behind the closed curtains was our long drive away. It was a 50-foot-long driveway leading into the country roads of our small but knit community. Nothing but gravel, grass, and dirt for a reasonable distance. 

I remember freezing, my skin pricking up. Luci’s body wasn’t relaxed like it usually was when she sleptwalked; no, it was stiff. Each muscle is rigid, like it's glued together, pieces of plastic, trying to mimic the human body. Her body faced forward, towards the wall, stiff, but her head was cranked towards the window to our left. Even the skin on her nape folded over itself as if someone forced her that way. 

I shot up, my hands trembling a bit as I hesitated to look out the window. I didn’t wanna look, I just wanted to hide under my covers. Still, I couldn’t let my sister suffer like THAT. I was a mean sister, not a monster. 

“Luci,” I whispered silently, not trying to fully wake her, just trying to coax her back to sleep. “Luci, come on, lie down…”

But she didn't move, not even a twitch to suggest she heard my voice. My heart slowly began to race as I saw that not even her chest was moving…she wasn’t breathing. 

“Luci, Luci, wake up!” I shouted softly, not caring about the rule; my sister wasn’t breathing, and I needed to fix that. “Come on, Luci!”

I shook her, but it did nothing; her body stayed rigid, as if I was trying to move stone. each bone, muscle, and cell tensed and frozen in place. “Luci!”

I shouted again, my dog stirring in her sleep as I did. “Oh, Luci,” I repeated her name God knows how many times. I threw my covers off, shuffling myself to sit in front of her to get a better view.  It was still dark enough in the room that you couldn't see anything. We had nothing but a small outlet night light behind us, casting dark shadows on her face. 

Now panicking, I began to shake her harder, but not even a strand of hair moved. I was no older than ten, so in my little ten-year-old mind, I was scared my parents would somehow blame me for this, as they always blamed me for my sister's actions. I looked around for solutions, but I still couldn’t see a thing. I didn't have a flashlight, phones weren’t even an option since the iPhones with a flashlight weren’t even a thing yet. I had no idea where the fanlight remote was, and I didn’t have time to find it. 

I looked toward the curtains, seeing the moonlight slip beneath the curtains like fog rolling over the still lakes. I didn't think, I just yanked it back, and the moonlight was bright, really bright. It was perfect, I nearly felt like the moon had replaced the sun in its battle to outshine the other. I quickly turned back to my sister, now a bit more in front of her face. 

I nearly screamed. 

Her eyes were bloodshot and dry, as if they had been open for hours, her mouth hung fully open, tense, and her tongue frozen in the middle as if mid-scream. The skin stretched and pulled at her cheek, leaving small indentations near the jaw and lower cheek, and right across her forehead, as something held her head back and forced it open. 

I fall backwards, my spine hitting the cold wall and partially the glass of the window. 

I was dreaming, I must’ve been. There was no way this could be happening. Surely she must have been playing a prank on me. 

“Luci!” I screamed, not caring if I got in trouble. “Luci, wake up!” I shouted, my chest heaving as my heart wanted to tear open my chest nd run away. 

“Luci—“ I stopped myself, quickly realizing something. 

Each time I called her name, my attempts to wake her, her face stretched wider, her head pulling back as her jaw shot down. 

I quickly covered my mouth, muffling my own screams. My free hand was gripping the blanket so tightly that my knuckles turned purple from the lack of blood flow. 

“Luci…” I whispered, testing out my voice as it was a loaded gun and I was at a Russelte game. When I noticed her face didn’t change, I gulped and whispered her name once again. “Luci.” 

Eyes. 

Just her eyes. 

They slightly turned so they were no longer looking at me, but past me. 

Fear, oh God, the terror on her face. Each fiber of muscle slowly contorts itself into a state of mid-frozen horror. Her eyebrows moved as if someone was trying to keep her in a neutral state, and the ends of her mouth curved downward, only for something to pin them right back up. Each time a muscle shifted slightly, revealing the terror on her face, indents appeared on her skin, stretching it back. Still, no matter what was making my little sister into this frozen puppet, nothing could hide the gut-wrenching dread in her eyes as it reflected in the sockets as she looked toward the driveway. 

I didn't wanna turn, no, I didn't want to. I already knew our drive gave me the chills, regardless, but seeing her look past me, the stiff muscle now turning into absolute fear. 

“Luci,” I said, whicing when I said it. Too loudly, watching her head go back further and her jaw nearly touching her neck. The skin around her lips is tearing slightly, and trickles of blood are dripping down the sides of her chin. 

I began to sob silently, my breath hitching as I tried to keep my cries under just a whisper. No, no, I was going to help my little sister. I was going to be a good sister. I was! 

My hands shaking, I straighten my back, looking toward my dg, but she stayed sleeping. I thought about using my dog, but could my dog possibly do? What would so do? Even if she did see whatever…whatever was hurting my little sister, she would only bark, and that…that was no whisper. 

I looked around my room, trying to find something, but nothing seemed to work. 

What am I going to do? I didn't even know what was going on. I just wanted my sister safe, I wanted her back. 

Her eyes shot toward me, then back out the window, the eyes even wider, eyes now filled with panic, a tear finally slipping down her cheek, mixing with the blood. 

The soft thump of it hitting the cotton blankets in her lap felt like a ticking clock. Each drop a second wasted. 

“Luci, I'm so sorry…” I whispered even lower than a prayer, my tears louder than my voice. 

It shifted; her eyes moved from me back to the window, going at such a fast pace that it nearly rolled to the back of her head. 

She was warning me.

Luci was warning me. 

Look.

Look outside. 

I took a deep breath, my nails digging into my own skin, the pain nowhere near the panic and unease I felt from seeing my little sister in…in what..what i…I just put my little sister to sleep. To sleep. 

Her eyes froze again, back on me, the pupils wide and warning. I locked eyes with her…I didn’t know what to do.

 I'll get my parents! They can help!

I moved slowly, not wanting even to creak the bed; it would be too loud. Every inch felt like a gunshot, which shook a drum. My tears now hit the floor, I was off the bed and now slowly tiptoeing toward my door. It was open; I was always open. But it was dark. So dark. We had a nightlight in the hall to help us reach the bathroom at night. And I saw it, the light was on, but it cast nothing over anything. As if the darkness swallowed little light, it shone. 

I gulped down my fear, taking a single step out of my room, but all the courage disappeared when I saw the light fade. No, I noticed something… something that looked like a hand covering the light, that suffocating darkness filling the hallway once again. 

“No…” I whispered, cursing myself for being louder than a thought when I heard it. 

Crack. 

I froze.

All the blood is draining from my face. 

The sound of bone cracking screamed into the darkness, mixing with the hall's darkness. 

\_My friend had snapped their leg, the bone spitting in half, when he jumped off a swing and landed wrong. I remember that sound clearly, but the sound I heard wasn’t one, I can’t remember how many, but I knew it was too much…all cracking one after another.\_ 

I fell back, my body frozen in fear as I was forced to look into the darkness of the hall. I couldn’t look back, no, i didn wanna look back. I could only hold back my sobs as my fingernails dragged against the wooden floors, nearly breaking off as I stretched them near my hips. 

The room, the house, the world was dead and silent. I couldn’t even hear my thoughts. The silence was so deafening that nothing but a soft ring echoed in my ears, never reaching the dark Hall.

But I needed to be strong for my sister, I needed to be a good sister. I just needed to stand… look…look…

Look behind you. 

Still on the ground, I slowly turn my head. Every minute, I'd turn my head an inch. Each second felt like hours had passed by before I finally looked back at the innocent hours on my bed.

There she sat, still in that same rigid posture, her back the same… but her head… her arm. 

I felt the vomit rise from my stomach to my throat in a tsunami-like wave. I wasn’t fast enough to stop it as it poured onto the floor, the stench and coloring causing my stomach to twist and turn even more, like the sight before me. 

“Luci!” I reached out, my screams no longer having any effect on the innocent mind of a child. 

There, my poor sister…my poor Luci…her head now looked directly at me, her neck snapped. Her head dangled only for it to be caught by something I couldn’t see, and neither did I want to see it. But it wanted me to see, to see how her head dangled, showing she was no longer my Luci. 

Her left arm was broken and twisted in all sorts different places, the bone just teasing, barely breaking through the skin. The elbow was bent to the right till the outer elbow faced inwards. She pointed out the window, which cued her finger pointed out to the bright moonlight that never reached the hall.  Her index finger was crooked, and the fingernail was peeling back, connecting to the skin like one huge hangnail torn all the way to the knuckle. 

Luci’s eyes, oh God, her eyes. When I saw them, I screamed, I screamed, both in terror and hope my parents would awake. I prayed, I prayed to God that my parents would save her, to save my sister from this cruel, unknown fate. I didn't care if they blamed me, I didn't care if they killed me to save her, I prayed for someone to save my sister. 

But my prayer was not heard, not by my parents, not by Luci… No one. Not even God could listen to my prayer, for how loud the darkness consumed it. 

“Luci!” I rushed toward her in trembling strength, but my hand slipped in my own bile, causing my chin to hit the rough floor, the stench putrid as the taste of blood filled my mouth. “Luci!” I ignore the pain, my shin down to my chest covered in my own vomit, the temperature still warm on my skin. 

I tried to stand up, nearly tripping again from how weak my body was, when I saw the empty bed. Luci was gone. I froze, gripping my chin in the pulsating pain as I stared at the empty bed. 

“Luci…” I called out, afraid of even my own voice echoing in the darkness to be consumed. It’s greed thick and greasy, it black slipping into the room, leaving only the moonlit window and bed. 

I took a shaky step forward, and if it hadn’t been for the blood and drool stains etching its cruelty onto my white sheets, I would have told myself she was in her bunk. 

Her bunk.

My head shot up, looking upwards toward the top bunk. 

There was Luci. 

I froze. I didn’t move, I didn’t breathe, nor did I even think. Thinking would be too loud, and the darkness would take it and feast upon it like flies trapped in a web. 

Not in the bunk, no, on the corner of the ceiling, her body twisted and turned to take this grotesque shape. She barely looked human, and if it weren’t for her eyes, I would have never thought this was my Luci, my poor little Luci. Her eyes, her poor terrified eyes, bloodshot with tears dripping down her cheek, looking at me, then the window, then at me. Repeating it back and forth.

How did she get there? How…I don’t remember how she got there…was I frozen with fear that whole time? 

I slowly gulped, fear paralyzing every muscle in my body, even my blood failed to pump into my heart. My hands are shaking so badly, and my nails are digging into the flesh of my palm, pushing in the bile still left between my fingernails past the barrier. 

Its head twitched to the side in a sharp movement, like someone had pulled it toward the door. Then, within seconds, I watched it scuttle toward the door leading to the greedy darkness and slam it, now resting over the door. Its body…the body of my Luci crumbled together like someone trying to force paper down in a small bowl. 

I could hear myself sniffling with every hitch of my breath despite my wishes. I screamed at my body to silence itself, but it did not hear my prayer, nor did God. 

Subconsciously, my body had been walking backward to get away from the creature on my door, its floral design now taunting me. I fell back into the bed, watching it with unblinking eyes. I wasn't going to take my eyes off it, no, and as the blood rushed to my head and the sound of my heart beating like a drum echoed in my ear, I soon realized even I couldn’t keep my own promises. 

Its hand reached out again, its same crooked finger pointing past me, out the window. 

I didn't know why it wanted me to look out then, and I still don't, not even to this day. But I felt it, something behind me, something watching us…watching me.

I felt my back hit the cold glass, a harsh and bone-chilling cold breeze slipping past and into the room, making my hair cover my face, my dark hair blocking my sight. I reached my hand up to move it away quickly, not wanting my eyes to leave the thing on my door, but I soon wished I had left my hair there when I did. 

There, just a few inches before me, stood my sister's face, the same as it was before everything. Before the bone cracking, before the jaw snapping, and before the skin near the center of her lips tore open. 

All the air left my lungs in a state of sheer dread. I tried to catch my breath, but it was as if even the oxygen was left, not wanting to be consumed by the darkness now spilling under the closed door.  

But those same indents were on her face, keeping her staring past me. But here, her eyes were different, since before they had been filled with panic, dread, and terror. Now? 

Her eyes were filled with sheer aniliation as she looked at me. 

Not past me.

At me. 

That alone made me want to empty my stomach out again as my head hit the cold glass. The scent of urine filled my nostrils as I felt the warm liquid spill between my thighs and onto my white sheets, staining them with my sin. 

That's when I blinked, and her stretched lips now rested, a deep frown sketched on her face, as if whatever puppeteer her pulled her mouth down, the corners of the lips open as if something was using its fingers to pull it. The same fear in her eyes, the same annihilation. 

Luci then came closer, and closer, forcing me to press myself even more back till her nose touched my cheek as I kept my head turned away but my eyes on her. But she kept dead eye contact with me, her eyes still bloodshot, but no longer tear-filled. 

That's when I saw it, something move out of the corner of my eyes, still blood, and out of reflex, I looked. 

There, at the edge of my drive way, stood something. I don't know what it was, but there was someone or something on the road right before our driveway, on the edge of our property.  I quickly turned my gaze back, only to be faced with my sister's face. She was so close, so close that I could feel the hair on her skin touch mine. His eyes were nearly bulging out, going back to the repeated, looking at me, then out the window, then back to me, but it was moving too fast for his gaze to last any longer than a millisecond. 

I could feel the vomit erupt in my throat as I exploded bile in front of me, dripping down to my bed, my shoulder, and arm, and landing on the glass window and window sill. The room grew cold as I could see the steam from my vomit rise into the air, but the stench was nothing compared to the scent of decay flooding my nose. 

It smelt like rotting flesh left in a dark bucket, left for the bacteria to infect it with its cruel fate.  The scent was coming with the wind…as if whatever outside was the source of it. 

I didn't want to look back, and I knew I shouldn’t have once I saw whatever it was standing outside, now running on all fours toward me at full speed. 

I screamed, I left out a blood-curdling scream, not caring if the darkness consumed it, I screamed and pushed myself away from the window, shoving past my sister and falling onto the floor. I hit my tailbone with a loud thud, but I did not stop. I just scooted myself back till I hit the door and shut my eyes. I closed my eyes, and I kept them shut as I screamed for help, screamed for my parents, I screamed for God. 

Luci, please forgive me. I wasn’t the best older sister, and I didn't protect you….I wish..I wish I could switch places with you, wherever you are. 

My sister has been missing since that night. I don't know what happened, and if I'm honest, I'm still too much of a guilt card to want to know. 

My parents claimed they found me lying in my own pool of bodily fluids, and the screen door to the window was torn open from the middle. When they tried wake me, I screamed nd i kept creaming. They said I kept yelling, “It’s here! It’s here! It has her!” But from the evidence, they believed I saw the kidnapping of my own sister. 

The cops spent a day trying to get me to remember…but when I told them my story, praying the police would believe, praying to God they’d believe me, that anyone did. 

But the darkness consumed that prayer, and I soon realized it was fruitless to think the darkness couldn’t feast on my guilt. 

Cops found nothing but Luci’s hair a few miles down near the river, but nothing else. We didn’t have security cameras at that time, our neighbors reported hearing screaming, but saw something, and I mean how they could? They were miles away from our house. 

My parents broke down over the loss of their little girl, \*my\* little Luci. They blamed me, they said they didn't, but I could tell from their hateful gazes and how they’d ask every so often if I remembered the face of the man who took my sister. But even at a young age, I knew the darkness would never let them believe me…so they blamed me…and honestly, I blame myself….so I don't blame them for blaming me.

I am nearly 35 years old. 

And I sit here writing this as a warning and as my last prayer before the darkness consumes this one, too.    

I have my own kids. And I regret having them with all my heart and soul. Not due to depression, not because they are difficult, not because I never wanted them, no. But because last night, I awoke with the feeling of something wet hitting my face. I cringed, wiping it away as my eyes shot open and I locked eyes with my second child staring at me…no not as me…past me…

Never wake a sleep walker.
