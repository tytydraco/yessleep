I am pleased to share that my life is moving in a positive direction. Perhaps my last performance was too successful because no one asked me any questions in the following week. Even the area outside my hospital room was quieter than other wards. My injuries were minor; compared to the unfortunate attacker, mine were mere scratches. The stab wound in my thigh narrowly missed arteries and tendons, requiring no stitches.

Apart from a generous sum from my mother to "take care of myself" (which I suspect had an undertone of "stay away from me"), I also received substantial compensation from the government, and somehow, my insurance kicked in too.

I genuinely believe that checking my bank account daily aids in my recovery. Just three days later, I no longer needed painkillers and could hobble to the bathroom with a crutch. I was even allowed to use electronic devices, finally filling in the blanks.

The attack had shocked the entire city. Under immense public pressure, a special investigation team released their findings during the two days I was in a coma. The perpetrator, responsible for five deaths and one serious injury at the mall, was an ordinary person: regular parents, normal childhood, standard schooling, and a typical job post-graduation.

One day, he suddenly decided to kill a few people in the mall. An average person, easily overlooked, who put everyone at ease. The investigation team attributed his motive to a breakup with his girlfriend. However, I doubt a six-month online relationship could lead to such a consequence.

More importantly, after spending hours meticulously examining his online traces, I found no evidence suggesting he knew any language other than English. So what did he say to me before he died?

My performance was so convincing that whenever I brought up the attack, people would sympathetically and cautiously comfort me, a traumatized survivor on the brink of collapse, and then swiftly change the subject.

Interestingly, my unusual name as a survivor garnered some attention, with a few professors even emailing to check on me. To be honest, I was touched.

My wounds healed remarkably fast, earning me the nickname "miracle maker." After just five days in the hospital, I returned home. Everything was as it had been before, but the recent experience left me feeling uneasy—being inexplicably stabbed by a stranger can indeed shatter one's sense of security.

This is my home, I mean, the house is in my name. It was a gift from my mother when she sent me to another country for university, a compensatory gift for losing her daughter. Frankly, I was glad to know my worth, even thinking that buying out my future didn't require such a high price.

Overall, this has been my home for five years, housing dozens of tenants, mostly fellow Chinese students who couldn't find suitable apartments. I rented them rooms at campus dorm rates, purely to help out, barely making any money.

Fortunately, the last tenant moved out at the end of last semester, and I hadn't encountered another unlucky student needing accommodation this semester. No one had to worry about living with an emotionally unstable landlord.

This was good. Carefully placing my injured leg on a pillow, I half-lay on the bed and replied to the concerned professors' emails—two of whom taught me last semester. I appreciated their concern. I also applied for a one-week extension for my group assignment, explaining that I would make up for the missed parts in future projects. My reason should be convincing enough to avoid rejection.

Wait, I celebrated too early.

Yesterday, someone sent a request to rent a room through my university email. It was from a biomedical graduate student who, according to him, was "writing this email from a very expensive pet-friendly hotel and really needed my help."

The email was sincere, with a student ID photo of the sender, Reeve Spencer, and his well-mannered friend Otto. I found Reeve's information on Teams; though there was no photo, his student ID and email matched. The referrer had rented a room from me a year ago for his mother visiting from China. Everything seemed fine.

After all, I couldn't be perpetually unlucky, right? Reassuring myself, I explained my "sudden situation" in my reply.

"If you don't mind my condition, you and Otto are welcome to move in. This should be okay, right?"

After handling the tasks accumulated during my coma, I was so exhausted that I fell asleep before I could put away my tablet.
