Three times I saw (and once heard) and unexplained flash in my room that came from no plausible source

This happened about a year ago but I have been thinking about it much more recently for some reason. All events occurred in my bedroom with the lights out, and I believe it was past 10 pm. 

During the first occurrence, I was on my phone with my earbuds in, listening to something, and I felt like sitting up for some reason (this is a theme consistent with the other occurrences). My bed, which I was laying on, is in the left side of my room from where i’m laying, with space in front of it and to the right. As I sit up, I see a very bright flash of light illuminating most of the room, only lasting about half a second. It was unclear to me where it had came from, but I just didn’t want to think about it at the time, though it weighed on me the next day. It is important to note that I could easily tell it did not originate from the window, or from any device in the room. 

(Couple weeks later,) the second occurrence was almost the same, me sitting up, earbuds in, although this time I felt I saw the light come more from the leftmost side of my room and illuminate the right, although I still could not pinpoint where from. 

Only about a week later was the third occurrence. I sat up like before, however this time for some reason I took my earbuds out. As soon as I was able to hear clearly, I saw the light illuminate the room, and I saw exactly its source. Almost a cube of light shooting outwards from under my bed was what it looked like, guided by shapes that weren’t there, if that makes sense, until it just went out and illuminated the room like a normal flashlight kind of. It was on the edge of the underside of my bed. I also heard a very audible click sound, akin to that of a digital camera. The only device near it was a school issued laptop that was shut off and had no way to produce that kind of light. On top of this, there is minimal space below my bed as we store a whole extra mattress underneath it. I haven’t seen the light since, but I just remember it being so vivid and bright, artificially bright, especially the third occurrence. 

Everything I research about this seems to be tied to close eyed hallucinations, however my eyes were fully open and I was in a very awake state at the time. I have never had hallucinations like these (and have only ever had one hallucination, assuming these are not one). This is not in an old house, and nothing else of this nature has occurred in my house as far as I know of. I am convinced it did not come from the window or any sort of device that I knew of, and when I checked the area there was nothing near it that could have produced anything like this. I also find it strange that it only happened when I decided to sit up, and I don’t really remember why I wanted to sit up, just that I felt like doing it.
