When my sister and I were kids, our family lived for awhile in a charming old farmhouse. We loved exploring its dusty corners and climbing the apple tree in the backyard. But our favorite thing was the spirit. Some mornings my sister and I would wake up, and on each of our nightstands, we’d find a cup that hadn’t been there the night before. The spirit had apparently left them there the night before, worried that we’d get thirsty during the night, but when I looked inside, it was filled with a some sort of  green liquid. I took a drink and it tasted bitter.  Among the homes’ original furnishings was an antique wooden rocking chair which we kept against the back wall of the living room. Whenever we were preoccupied, watching TV or playing a game, it (the spirit) would inch that chair forward, across the room, toward us. One day, during the middle of the night, I felt a hand on my shoulder, and  a  eerie voice saying, "I've been waiting to meet you. We're going to have so much fun together." The next morning, I told my sister that the house is haunted and that afternoon we packed our bags, and left the haunted house forever. Years later,  I found an old newspaper article about the farmhouse’s original occupant, a widow. She’d murdered her two children by giving them each a cup of poisoned milk before bed. Then she hung herself. The article included a photo of the farmhouse’s living room, with a woman’s body hanging from a beam. Beneath her, knocked over, was that old wooden chair, placed exactly in the center of the room. 

Suddenly, I felt an eerie chill, right behind my back, and a scratchy voice saying, "I'm back. Did you miss me?" I turned around to see the spirit, dressed in a black and white dress, with black soulless eyes looking down at me. It was the first time she'd shown me her appearance. The spirit slowly walked to me. I panicked, and shoved the ghost, it tumbled to the ground, and I ran outside. I didn't stop running until I am sure that I'd lost her. Then I decided to call a uber to go to my sisters place. 30 minutes later, a black car picked me up. The window rolled down, and thats when I saw her in the drivers sit, her soulless eyes, looking deep into my soul, and said "Hi, honey, you really thought it'd be that easy to get rid of me? NOW GET IN NOW OR I WILL KILL YOUR SISTER!" " How would you kill my sister, if you don't know where she live?"  I asked. The spirit then told me that she has been stalking my sister for 10 years and know exactly where she lived. I tried to run, but something has taken over me and I wasn't in control of my body anymore.  I walked to the car and got in.  The door slammed shut, and we drove to a burnt down house, in the middle of nowhere....

I am currently typing this into an crappy computer, in the basement of the burned down house. It turns out the fucking spirit owns an old crappy computer.  

uh, oh I need to go. I think she's coming downstairs to check up on me,  and I don't want her to know I am sharing this story out into the world. I will try my best to update as soon and I can. Goodbye, for now.
