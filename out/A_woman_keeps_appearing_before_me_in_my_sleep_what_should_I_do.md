Apologies if this post seems rushed or illegible, but I must share my story with you. As I write this my hands are trembling and I struggle to type- but here we go. 

I \[F25\] have been struggling to sleep as of recent, as some dream has been feverishly plaguing my mind. In the dream, a ghostly woman dressed in a white ill-fitted nightgown, with a frail, gaunt frame, and dull, greyish paper-thin skin stands in the corner of my bedroom. Her soul-chilling entity appears before me in my sleep night after night, gazing at me. She appears at 2 a.m promptly each time- almost like clockwork. I lay frozen in my bed, each time more and more paralysed with fear, eyes widened, listening to the gradual 'tick'... 'tick'... 'tick'... of my clock upon the wall until I eventually drift back into the grasp of sleep. 

Tonight however, was different. 

My eyes slowly opened, blurry, adjusting to the dim light of my phone screen flashing on my bedside table. My eyes scanned the peripheral of my bedroom, frantically attempting to find the wretched spirit, but she was nowhere to be seen. Not in a rush to count myself lucky, I reluctantly closed my eyes- in an attempt to help sleep drape over me. Yet my eyes quickly flew open. I knew not what had caused it, but I soon realised- the figure was stood at the foot of my bed.

Her glare from the dark, endless voids of her eyes pierced and violated my body, as I trembled with fear, clutching onto the satin sheets that lay atop of me. I stared back in utter repulsion and fear, too horrified to move. I looked longingly at the doorknob that would give way to my safe escape from this god-forsaken room, but I still could not- would not move, for fear that the malevolent spirit would seize me. 

I had to do something this time.

My mind sprung into action, as I glanced over at my phone that still lay on my bedside table, mustering the sheer courage to reach over to it. My now quivering arms drew down my bedsheets, the thumping in my chest I had ignored became stronger, rising to the surface, as if trying to break free from my ribcage that so cruelly confined it. Keeping my eyes on her decaying frame, I reached over to my bedside, ever so slowly, reaching out for my phone. The time on the screen read '2:05 a.m'. Turning on my torch, a gasp escaped my lips. 

Before my bed, now illuminated in more detail than ever before, stood a disgusting, chilling body of a woman who seemed to be decomposing from a wasting disease. This inhuman thing, with a ghostly pallor on her tightly drawn skin which stretched across her protruding cheekbones, threatened me intensely with now almost glowing eyes, contrasting her deep-set eye bags. Her long, black wiry hair trailed down her shoulders, and she now reached out to me- pointing a skeletal index attached to her bony arm directly towards myself in a grotesque fashion. 

I dreaded the inevitable attack to come, shuddering, imagining my death by the very devil itself. The ghost slowly drew her jaw painfully open, and formed a sickening, twisted smile. The woman bore porcelain, sharp teeth that reflected the glow of my torch, and began to shriek, erupting with a shrill, reverberating cackle that poisoned my mind, piercing my eardrums. I threw my hands around my ears in a futile attempt to block out the howls that plagued the room around me, desperately trying to call out for a single soul nearby to help me in my peril- but only a faint sound fled from my trembling lips. The woman took a step closer, now grasping her bony digits around my bed-post for support. 

I could not take it anymore. 

She moved closer again, still menacingly laughing- louder and louder.

I could not bear any longer. 

I lashed at her in anger, springing towards her like a crazed, wild cat- my fingers locked into position like claws ready to attack. The crazed woman's eyes widened with shock as I made contact, and I recoiled in pain, a smashing noise piercing through my skull. Acute agony flared up across my body as I looked down at my hands, revealing several shards of glass protruding from my flesh. I looked up, confused still, and realised the woman was gone, but had now been replaced by an arched metallic frame in her place. 

In the centre of the frame, few shards of glass remained, and my fragmented reflection was cast back at me. There I stood, in that same, ill-fitted nightgown- which now seemed as if it had been torn by some beast, and then smeared with a deep red blood. The realisation set in as I peered at my reflection in the mirror, at the white nightgown that cloaked my bony figure. I collapsed into the pile of shattered glass, unable to carry the burden of what had just happened.

I sit here now typing my story, wondering what to do next.
