**<<Trigger warning>> for domestic violence, language, and mild body shaming.** 

The mosquito didn’t stand a chance. I watched it land on my thigh and swatted it before it knew what was coming. I sat perched in the tall branches of an oak tree, and although the mosquitos were fewer this high up, I still found myself in the midst of a futile battle. Two more had already dug themselves into my arm, and as I raised my hand to annihilate them, vicious shouting from below redirected my attention. I leaned against the rough tree trunk lazily swinging my feet while trying to decipher the shouting.

A short distance from the tree, my friend stood with fists thrust against her hips, chin up, feet firmly grounded in a picture of unshakeable defiance. She looked like a pissed off Latin barbie doll in an oversized t-shirt. A scraggly, shirtless boy paced in front of her like a cornered rat. The stick-and-poke rebel flag tattoo on his chest seemed to flap as he flung his arms around. He made my lip curl with disgust. I realized with sinking disappointment that I was too far away to make out the words being said, but I could hear the fluctuation in tones. As the boy shouted and continued to gesture with animated vigor, my friend leaned forward and said something sharp. Whatever she said must have cut him deeply. He stopped pacing and struck her with an open palm. Her face jerked to the side with the impact, but in a fluid motion she moved into the nastiest right jab I’ve ever seen a high-schooler land.

The boy’s head snapped back, and I spotted at least one tooth spiraling through the air.

I had to stifle cheer as he landed right on his ass, hand covering his mouth, eyes wide with astonishment. I had thought for a split second that she might need backup, but realized I had nothing to worry about. Willow is a badass. She stood over him, finger pointing accusatorially, face twisted with anger as she yelled. He kicked backwards away from her, a cloud of dust forming around him, as she advanced on him. Hard pressed to peel my eyes from the show but feeling that it was time intervene before she killed him, I descended from the tree, carefully using the branches like rungs of a ladder, then dropping from the last 6 feet into the soft mud below. As I approached them, I could finally make out the words being exchanged.

“I’ll kill you, Willow! You won’t make it off this river alive!”

“Bring it *pussy*! You think I’m afraid of you and your band of inbreds?” She spat “Tell your brother-cousins I’m waiting for them.”

Dried twigs and leaves crunching under my feet alerted them both to my presence. Willow glanced back and the boy scowled at me. Her eyes sparkled with adrenaline, a small cut on her lip oozed blood.

“Too chicken to face me alone? Had to get your *girlfriend* involved” He growled at Willow, eyes shifting from me to her.

I spoke up “So afraid of a girl you had to hit her? So weak you let her knock you on your ass? I get more girls than you do asshole. Get the fuck out of here, Matt.” I crossed my arms and cocked a hip. Matt spat blood onto the ground and scurried to his feet. As he turned to leave, he paused to shoot one last wicked glare in our direction. Something in his eyes almost chipped my hardened façade for a moment. I fought a tingle that ran down my spine and held my stance. I didn’t want him to see any weakness in me. Without another word he turned and started walking back up the trail. I picked up a rock and called “*Hey dumbass, you forgot your tooth*!” before spiking it into his shoulder. He stumbled as the rock struck him then reflexively ducked, before sprinting out of sight into the thick woods.

Willow laughed and leaned her head on my shoulder. I released a deep breath and rested my head against hers. “If I had known cutting my hair short would start that rumor I wouldn’t have. It’s just low hanging fruit.” Willow shrugged and said “Eh, it’s cute, who cares what people think.” She suddenly snickered and feigned scolding me “But you did throw that rock like a man, was that necessary? He’s an ass but I did just break his heart…and his pride.”

I snorted “100%. I missed though, my aim sucks. Was supposed to hit him with my car instead.”

“*Sadie*”

I shrugged “Not like I can do any more damage to his head.”

Willow pouted at me sarcastically and I rolled my eyes. She was my best friend, and despite us both being honor roll and AP students no amount of “book smarts” or me being a voice of reason prevented her from making bad choices.

Matt had been her most recent tool for rebellion, and they had met at our usual hang out spot. Locals called it The Rope Swing, with no special metaphor or deeper meaning. It was simply named for the large rope swing that hung from an ancient, 80-foot pine tree at the heart of the little swamp oasis. A massive fire pit sat nestled in it’s clearing, shaded by towering pine and oak trees. Someone at some point had built a little plywood platform where you could lay out and sun, and a makeshift dock that floated on blue plastic barrels. It was easy to reach if you had a boat, but the only access from land was by hiking through thick Florida brush.

Though there were a hand-full of locals that frequented the rope swing, It wasn’t uncommon for strangers to show up and join in on the fun. Matt and his posse had rolled-up by boat one day, and I swear that faint banjo music played as they docked. Something about them never sat well with me, but Matt came baring beer, weed, and music speakers which was enough for Willow. Unsurprisingly, Willow quickly lost patience for his inflated ego, misogyny and hot temper, putting us in the situation today.

With the breakup finally out of the way, Willow and I used smoldering embers left in the fire-pit from previous occupants to light a small bonfire. There was still a slight nip in the morning air, so rather than swimming we lounged on the rain-rotted platform and sunned like lizards. It was a miracle the platform hadn’t caved in on us yet. As the morning slowly passed by, I admired the natural beauty around us. I kept my eye out for manatees, they would occasionally make the trek upstream but were a rare sight. Alligators, however, were not so rare. One currently slid across the river, gliding like a battleship through the murky water. At a glance, his cobblestoned head could easily be mistaken for a drifting log. Except that it was plowing against the river’s current. He slid beneath the water so smoothly that not one ripple disturbed the surface. We recently learned in biology that they usually only go after critters much smaller than them and otherwise mind their own, that is, unless it’s mating season like it is now. Even so, the territorial aggression tended to be limited from dusk to dawn when they are the most active. During the day it was perfectly safe to swim.

Willow snapped me out of my daydreaming by shaking my shoulder. “Check it out,” She lowered her voice playfully, “invaders.”. The faint hum of an engine preceded a familiar skiff cutting around the river bend. She was a rickety old boat suitable only for shallow water fishing. Endowed on her side in bright red cursive was the name “Double-Dee” with two massive breasts in a scant bikini making up the O and U. It’s captain was a massive man as round as he was tall, clad in American traditional tattoos of pinup girls. His bald head glistened red in the sun and his tattered oversized tank top fluttered in the wind. Lounging across the bow was a girl roughly the same age as Willow and I, long hair pulled into a pony tail and striped with blonde highlights. We cheerfully met the “invaders” at the dock.

The captain, Bubba, we called him, was a long-time local of the rope swing. No one knew his real name, and we were fairly certain that not even he remembered it. He was a jolly natured guy that held the local record for the highest belly-flop ever witnessed. His younger sister Dolly was in our grade but was a troublemaker and treated accordingly by the school. Despite that, she was a good friend to have if you needed contraband or numbers in a scuffle. She threw up a shaka sign in greeting as the boat drifted closer.

Bubba retrieved a coil of rope and called out “Catch! Make yourself useful, blondie, and tie me a good knot.” I caught the rope and quipped “Ask a little nicer or the Double-Dee is going down river.” He stuck his tongue out at me, and I stuck mine out back. “You tie it loose, you swim after it.” He threatened. I rolled my eyes and began tethering the boat. He tousled my hair endearingly as he stepped out of the Double-Dee. The boat violently thrashed at the sudden re-distribution of weight catching Dolly off-guard. She had just started to stand and was perfectly off-balance. We all watched as she sailed headfirst into the river, exploding from the surface moments later sputtering mucky water as her mascara ran down her face. “You fat-ass! Warn me next time!” She stripped off her soaking t-shirt and threw it at him. It rocketed through the air shedding spirals of water, spraying us with collateral damage. He ducked it, laughing as she clambered onto the dock streaking dirt across her neon pink bikini top. Willow helped her up before pulling her into a hug, Dolly’s swimsuit soaking her t-shirt. Bubba said “Come on, ya’ll make it too easy” before shoving them both back into the water.

For the better part of the day, we all took full advantage of the rope swing, practicing trick jumps, and partner swings. Around lunch time we took a break. I watched as an unfamiliar jet ski zipped by, it’s rider looking intensely at Willow. I glanced to see if Willow had noticed, she had and gave me a shrug. She was no stranger to being frequently ogled at or cat called. Bubba commented “Lots of boats on the water today. He’s like the third one I haven’t recognized.” Willow grunted in agreement. The uneasy feeling crept back into my bones at Bubba’s statement, but I did my best to ignore it. It was probably nothing, just jitters from this morning. Eager to change the subject I asked “Bubba how far is the ride to get here for you guys?” He thought for a moment then answered “Honestly not far, we live about 5 miles downstream, right on the river. Got a nice little covered dock for Dee.” He nodded affectionately towards the boat. “Been having issues with moccasins lately ‘round the dock though. Gators ain’t the only ones getting it on right now.”

“Gross.” Willow chimed in. Dolly Joined in on the conversation “Speakin’ of getting’ it on, y’all should come hang sometime-” I shot Dolly an exaggerated concerned look, and she shot back an annoyed glance “Let me finish, We can take Dee out to the sandbar, lots of college boys this time of year.” She bounced her eyebrows suggestively. This time Bubba muttered “gross” under his breath.

The rest of the day passed by far too quickly. After Bubba’s prior comment, I couldn’t help being hyper-vigilant and scrutinizing every water vessel that passed by. By the end of the day, I was certain that some of them had passed through more than once. The jet skier alone had passed at least 3 times. I tried to rationalize in my head before I voiced concern to Willow. After all, it was a gorgeous summer day, and the river only had so many branches. It wouldn’t be out of the question that people are just cruising about. But the way the jet skier looked at Willow each time he passed made me shudder. The weight of anxiety increased with each passing hour we were there. Feeling neurotic and self-doubting, I didn’t want to stress Willow out by bringing it up but decided instead to cut our stay short once Bubba and Dolly left. They packed up, and we said goodbyes, watching until the Double-Dee’s nice aft was out of site around the bend.

I turned to Willow, who was drying off by the fire and complained “Uhg, the mosquitoes are full-force right now, I’m dying. Let's leave too.” She looked at me, confused, and said “They’re no worse than usual. Don’t be a puss. Come on, let's watch the sunset.” I huffed at her and doubled-down “Nah dude, let’s just go, we can stay late tomorrow, plus we don’t have any bug spray.” She shrugged, looking a little disappointed, but began packing up. Relief washed over me when she didn’t push back again. Better safe than sorry.

On the hike back, my mood vastly improved. We quipped back and fourth and, propelled by the sense of leaving the potential dangers behind us, I could feel the spring in my step. The sun was setting quickly, and just as the dirt road came into view, it dipped below the horizon bathing the earth in an eerie darkness. Willow’s Honda civic was parked just short distance from the mouth of the trail. No one else had been on the trail when we hiked back, yet there were two old pick-up trucks, one parked directly in front of and the other parked directly behind the civic. My stomach dropped to my toes, and I grabbed Willows arm, halting her suddenly and almost causing her to drop her phone. “Hey-“ she started but saw the trucks and got the hint. We crouched at the mouth of the trail, just obscured by the brush. Her voice dropped to a whisper “What the fuck. This is creepy.” I nodded in agreement and quietly asked “Do you recognize either of those trucks?” She squinted, struggling to see details in the low light. “I think the one parked in front is Matt’s. It’s missing a rear mirror on the right side.” I rubbed the bridge of my nose while thinking. The dirt road was almost two miles long, and after that, miles of country road. The trail mouth where we currently hid was the only spot for miles that we would have phone reception. After that, the chances that a non-rapist good Samaritan would let us hitch a ride was slim to none. Willow nervously ran her fingers through her hair. “Do you really think we’re in trouble Sadie?” She said in hopeful denial.

“The whole thing does feel super sketchy.”

Willow groaned “Great. Even if we made it to the car, I don’t think I could pull out if I tried- they’re basically Eiffel towering it.” I couldn’t help but stifle a laugh at that. One of the truck doors opened and the cab light flicked on. We both hushed and settled lower into our hiding spot. Two men exited the truck parked in front of Willow’s car, one of which was clearly Matt, the other a beer-bellied hog with a bandana restraining his oily hair. They walked towards the truck parked in the back where two more men and a large dog exited the cab, illuminating the area with it’s light. Matt and Hog-man flicked on headlamps, before passing flashlights to the other men. The dog, a massive grey Pitbull, panted in the summer heat, drool stringing from it’s jowls. Willow and I exchanged a glance that read “this is bad”. We needed to make a decision now, and my phone had died earlier in the day.

I whispered slowly and carefully “Willow, call 911 now.”. Without a word she lifted her phone and dialed. As it softly rang, I continued “We need to hide and try to hold out until they get here.” The operator answered. Willow, stone faced, whispered “There are men after us in the woods, I think they’re going to hurt us.”  The operator calmly asked “Where are you located?” Willow told them. The operator paused before saying “Officers are on the way as soon as possible. Please try to stay hidden. It’s going to take them about 45 min-“ A flashlight beam swung in our direction and Willow ended the call, snuffing the phone light by hiding it in her shirt. The group was heading towards the mouth of the trail. The Pitbull was already looking directly at our current hiding place, stubby tail wagging ferociously. His sensitive ears probably heard the phone call and knew exactly where we were. The men hadn’t picked up on his cues just yet though. Idiots. Willow and I locked eyes. She mouthed WE NEED TO RUN. The men were walking closer. The dog was whining and pulling against his prong collar. My pulse pounded in my ears. She held up 3 fingers. Count of 3. 2. 1. Like game pheasants being flushed we erupted from the brush in a full sprint. The men shouted, surprised, and we tore through the bushes without looking back.

I wish I could say that this was the end of our predicament, **but it's only the beginning**. To be continued soon.
