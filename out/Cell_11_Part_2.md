Hello everyone, first of all, I noticed that in my first account ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cnbcfp/cell_11/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)) you got a little confused about the timeline of all this. To put an end to this issue once and for all: it's been 5 years since I got out of jail. But even after all this time, I'm still haunted by this whole story, so I decided to come here to tell it. Secondly, I've been trying to get in touch with the prison's management and legal department to find out what I can or cannot share here with you guys, I don't want to get into trouble with the law again haha. Anyway, I talked to my wife about the post I made and she helped me remember another case related to Cell 11, and while I don't get a definitive answer from the prison's advisory, I believe you guys will be interested in this account.



It was shortly after all that shit with Tulley. They still thought he would come back, so it was the guards' main topic, always looking for updates on his status. You could feel that heavy, bad air. I was already being haunted by nightmares too, waking up occasionally gasping and sweating with the image of the guard totally bestial over me. I think Francis noticed this change in the atmosphere and wanted to cheer things up a bit by organizing a card tournament.



It was a simple game, poker. Everyone there knew how to play and very well. The prizes for first, second, and third place were, respectively, a week of extra food, a pack of cigarettes, and a new deck of cards. It wasn't much, but in that environment, anything beyond the normal was a reason for celebration. I wasn't one of the best players, but I decided to participate anyway, thinking it would be a welcome distraction from the growing tension in the prison.



During the tournament, Francis circulated among the tables, watching the players and making sarcastic comments. He was always good at keeping morale high, I guess that's ultimately the role of a leader. As the cards were dealt and the bets started to rise, I could feel the energy in the room increase, everyone focused on the game and putting aside their problems for a moment.



It was when it was my turn to bet that things started to get strange. I had a decent hand, but not great. I decided to take a risk and make a bold bet, hoping the other players would back off. When, however, I looked up to bluff, someone made me uncomfortable. You see, it's normal for you to stare at others in the game, trying to identify the lie, the cheating, the face, but that particular pair of eyes was different.



It was Bob. His eyes weren't just intimidating, but they seemed to glow with a strange intensity... I felt a shiver run down my spine as I tried to keep my expression neutral, showing no sign of weakness. He just smiled back at me, a smile that didn't reach his eyes, which remained fixed on me, like a predator. I realized that... he was imitating, albeit to a lesser extent, Tulley's expression. Not in a genuine way, of course, but mockingly, teasing me. What a bastard...



The others seemed not to notice, staring at me as I tried to compose myself. I continued the game and finally, the last round came and Bob made his final bet. I looked at my cards and realized I didn't have any chance of winning anymore. I was about to give up when an idea popped into my mind. With a resigned sigh, I pushed all my chips to the center of the table, betting everything on one last desperate move.



When I did that, everyone fell silent, focusing all their attention on me. Francis, who had been watching the game from afar, approached our table, curious to see how the hand would unfold. His eyes, normally calculating, showed a flash of interest as he watched the dynamics between me and Bob.



Bob didn't hesitate to match my bet, putting all his chips in too. It was now or never. I could hardly contain my breath as I waited for the cards from the last round to be revealed. The deck seemed to vibrate with energy, as if it were aware of the tension building in the room. The cards were dealt, one by one, and each one seemed to echo the pulsation of my heart. I kept my face impassive, while Bob displayed a confident smile, as if he already knew he had won. But then, the last card was turned over and the fate of the game was sealed.



I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A perfect sequence, an unbeatable hand. I had won. I stood there, with the same confused look as Bob... it wasn't possible... the cards I saw before in my hand weren't these...



Silence hung over the room as everyone processed what had just happened. Francis was the first to break the silence, letting out a loud laugh and applauding in approval. The other inmates joined him, clapping and patting my back in congratulations. I tried to attribute the confusion to the nervousness I had just experienced, the tension and all the rest of the scene, and in the end, well, I had won, hadn't I?



I joined the cheering crowd, believing they were celebrating Bob's defeat more than my victory specifically. During that night, after all, I was the celebrity. As the night progressed, the prisoners began to disperse, with the exception of about five of them who wanted to "celebrate" the day's victory with homemade (and somewhat unhealthy) drinks.





I was somewhat uncomfortable with all that attention, but it seemed like a good idea. It was me, old Munford, Francis, and three more inmates whose names I could barely remember at that moment. Munford was the first to propose a toast in my honor, raising his makeshift mug filled with a very dubious red mixture.



Francis was sitting beside me, with a satisfied smile on his face, apparently happy with the distraction the card tournament had provided to the prison. The other inmates also seemed to be having fun, laughing and chatting animatedly as we shared stories and jokes.



For a moment, I managed to forget about the nightmares, Tulley's meltdown, and all the strange things that had been happening in the prison. We were all there, together. But an idea crossed my mind at that moment: alcohol is great at loosening tongues. Maybe, if Munford drank a little more, I could get more information, some answers.



"Thank you, Munford," I said, raising my own mug. "But the victory was for all of us here tonight."



He smiled and raised his mug in response, taking a generous sip of his homemade drink. I waited until he sat back down again, seizing the moment to strike up a conversation.



"And of course," I continued, "In respect to our colleague Tulley, may we meet again soon, in better circumstances."



"God bless his soul," Munford said, raising one hand up. "Poor lad, I saw his wife this week here, she seemed devastated."



"Poor thing..." I murmured. "And did you... hear about what happened that night?"



"Only the rumors from the guards," he paused for a moment. "To be honest, I wanted to hear from you what really happened."



I decided to take a more cautious approach, keeping the darker details to myself, but still trying to extract as much information as possible from Munford.



"Well, you know how those rumors are," I said, trying to sound casual. "We can't always trust what we hear. But there was something... strange that night, something I can't fully explain."



The old man leaned forward, his eyes shining with curiosity.



"What do you mean?" he asked, his voice a conspiratorial whisper.



"You know, that night I was heading back to my cell when I came across Tulley. There he was, standing, in front of..." I made a dramatic pause and leaned closer to him. "Cell 11."



Munford's expression instantly changed upon hearing the cell number. His eyes narrowed, and I could see a glimmer of recognition in them, as if he knew more than he was willing to admit.



"Cell 11, huh?" he murmured, his voice almost a whisper. "That damn cell..."



"Yes. He was staring at the wall, which I suppose had the painting. When I talked to him, he freaked out and came at me." I waited a few seconds as the man processed what I had just said. "Were you... here when the prisoner who made the painting came here?"



Munford looked at me with a somber expression, as if he were reliving some moment from the past.



"Oh, I was here at that time, yes," he replied, his voice heavy with weight. "It was a... difficult time for all of us."



"What happened to him?" I asked, feeling a chill run down my spine as I awaited Munford's response.



The old swindler seemed reluctant to continue, but after a moment of hesitation, he spoke in a grave whisper:



"He was a disturbed man, you know. Killed his own mother and all, didn't talk to anyone, and at least I never saw him eating."



"But what about the painting?" I pressed, my curiosity now boiling. "What happened to it?"



Munford lowered his eyes for a moment, as if gathering courage to continue.



"The painting... it was... eerie," he began slowly. "At least that's what those who saw it say. At that time, the guards didn't know what to do..."



"So, they covered it with a layer of paint?" I conjectured.



"Not so simple," Munford replied, his voice now grave. "They tried, of course. But the painting always came back. The new paint peeled away exactly on the outline of the dreadful drawing..."



Shivers ran down my spine as I absorbed Munford's words.



"So, what happened next?" I asked, barely able to contain my anxiety.



Munford sighed, looking tired.



"After that... things started to get strange in here," he continued. "Nightmares, meltdowns... and then, the disappearances began."



"Disappearances?" I repeated, feeling a knot in my stomach.



"Yes," Munford confirmed grimly. "People just... vanished. And never came back."



Unbeknownst to me, everyone was now quiet, looking at us, the tension even greater.



"And do you know what the painting was?"



Munford took a long sip of his drink and cleared his throat before speaking.



"An eye... A big eye, that never blinks, that never sleeps, always watching..."



Those words, somehow, shook me, sending a shiver straight down my spine.



I found myself looking around the room, as if expecting to find that insidious gaze in some dark corner. But of course, there was nothing but the bare walls of the prison and the faint glow of fluorescent lights. Still, the air around me felt heavier, as if it were laden with the sinister energy of that painting.



The atmosphere was dead now. We were leaving gradually, exchanging a curt "good night." Only Francis stayed, saying he wanted to talk to Munford, and I already had too much information, so I didn't want to be nosy. I bid farewell to my friends and began walking towards my cell, crossing paths with some guards who were chatting.



Under normal circumstances, I would have received a scolding, since our curfew had sounded about 10 minutes ago, but not that night. They just tipped their hats and murmured a "Go to your cell, okay?" and I certainly followed my way.



Now, an important thing. I was in cell 4, and Munford, in 23. It was about a 5-minute walk, and halfway there, I would have to pass by cell 11. I was tense, remembering what I had heard, and started to slow down as the numbers decreased. I was turning the corner of cell 17 when I saw, standing at the end of the corridor, a large silhouette, someone standing, staring directly at me.



I stopped abruptly, my heart racing at the scene. A chill ran down my spine as I tried to discern who or what was standing there, watching me with a disturbing intensity. The dim light of the corridor wasn't enough to reveal many details about the mysterious figure. All I could see was a blurry outline, motionless like a statue, indistinct against the dark background of the corridor.



Suddenly, it started walking towards me, and I could see its face illuminated by the photons of the lamp above its head: It was Bob.



"What are you doing here, Bob?" I finally managed to articulate, my voice coming out in a hoarse whisper.



He stopped a few steps away, his face expressionless, just watching me with those bright eyes.



"I was just taking a walk," he replied calmly, his voice as smooth as ever. "And you, what are you doing here so late?"



I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized I didn't have a good answer to that question. Why was I there, standing in the hallway at night, staring at Bob as if I had seen a ghost? His voice sounded as if he were trying to sound friendly, but his menacing appearance contrasted with his tone.



"I... was... just going to my cell," I stammered, trying to sound casual. "And you know how it is... it's a long way..."



Bob didn't say anything for a moment, just continued staring at me with those inscrutable eyes. I felt increasingly uncomfortable under his gaze, as if he could read my thoughts.



"Are you sure you're okay?" he finally asked, his voice sounding strangely concerned.



"Of course, of course, just a little tired."



"You know..." he gently placed his hand on my shoulder. "We're among friends here, aren't we?"



"We are?"



He laughed.



"Of course, buddy. I just wanted to ask you something: you cheated, didn't you?"



With my heart pounding in my chest, I swallowed hard, trying to maintain my composure.



"Cheat?" I repeated, trying to sound innocent. "I don't know what you're talking about, Bob. I swear I played fair in the tournament."



He continued to stare at me, his bright eyes seeming to penetrate my soul.



"Oh, but you did, didn't you?" he said, his voice now taking on a more sinister tone. "You found a way to cheat, a way to win even when your cards weren't good enough. I'm not angry, you know, I don't mind you taking the prize, but I just want to know how you did it." He leaned closer to me. "And for you to admit it."



"This is all a misunderstanding, Bob," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "I swear I played fair. Maybe you're just mistaken, or maybe it just wasn't your lucky night."



He tilted his head to the side, his smile slowly fading.



"Interesting," he murmured, his voice tinged with suspicion. "Very interesting. But I think you and I know the truth, don't we? Either way, I'll be keeping an eye on you."



With those words, he turned and began walking back down the corridor, disappearing into the darkness. I stood there, my heart still pounding in my chest as I tried to process what had just happened.



"That was all I needed, another worry for today," I remember murmuring.



Unfortunately, that didn't distract me enough, and soon I was feeling nervous again as I watched the numbers decrease on the cell door. 14... 13... 12.



The corridor seemed darker than ever when I reached the front of Cell 11. I paused for a moment, hesitating to pass by it. A sense of oppression enveloped me, as if something sinister were lurking on the other side of that metal door.



I could simply move on, ignoring Cell 11 and returning to my cell. But a part of me, curious and perhaps a bit foolish, wanted to know more. Gathering courage, I took a few hesitant steps towards the cell. The dim light of the corridor cast dancing shadows on the walls, creating an even more sinister atmosphere around me. I held my breath and stood there trying to hear something behind the door, any faint noise.



For a moment, all I could hear was the muffled sound of my own rapid breathing, when I felt someone pulling me from behind.



"What's up, Bob, I've already said I didn't che—" I was interrupted by a pair of hands pressing tightly on my neck like icy claws, cutting off my breath and preventing me from articulating any sound. My body reacted instinctively as I fought for my life, my heart pounding in my chest, and my lungs burning for air. The darkness of the corridor seemed to close in around me, increasing the feeling of despair and claustrophobia.



Amidst the desperation, I managed to twist my body. With a quick movement, I turned to face my assailant, ready to confront them, but what I saw before me made me freeze.



It was Tulley.



His hands felt even heavier as our eyes met. The shock of seeing him there, in front of me, after everything that had happened, paralyzed me for a moment. It was as if hell itself had materialized in that cell. My legs trembled more from fear than from lack of oxygen as tears bathed my face.



"Tulley," an animalistic growl escaped my throat.



"You want to see, huh? You think you can look back at him?" His voice was a dry rasp. "He's seen you a long time ago, and he doesn't like being looked back at."



My vision began to darken. I thought I would die, and how horrible it would be to die with fear, the expression of terror externalized, petrified in my coffin. I felt my body weighing down, tingling at the edges, my brain only able to scream, "DON'T DIE DAMMIT!" I was almost passing out when breath returned to my lungs. I saw Tulley lying on the floor, a large guard on top of him, accompanied by his wife, who now cried and sobbed in despair.



I saw myself there, on the floor, trying to catch my breath as the guard helped me up.



"Are you okay?" he asked, his voice filled with concern.



I nodded, still trying to process what had just happened. My mind spun around all the threats, and I could hardly believe that all of this had really happened.





"Yes, im fine" I finally replied, my voice still trembling. "Thank you for intervening."



The guard nodded, helping me to stand up and guiding me away from the cell. Tulley's wife was still hysterical next to her husband, while other guards arrived to help calm her down. I slowly backed away from the scene, still shaken by what had just happened.



As I moved away from Cell 11, a sense of relief began to seep in. My neck still burned, but gradually I began to normalize. I swear to you, to this day, I bear the marks of Tulley's fingers under my skin, a reminder of where my curiosity led me. Turns out, Tulley was under observation, and he had gone to the prison to speak with the local doctor and pick up his psychiatric file. While his wife was talking to the doctor, he fled and ran straight to the cell...



I definitely didn't expect what I encountered when I laid my head on the pillow that night, but Tulley's second attack wouldn't be the scariest thing for me that day. When I woke up, what happened left me so numb that I didn't even pay attention to the bruises or the trauma of the previous night. As I got up and removed the pillow to make the bed, I came across something that shouldn't exist, and that until then, I had never even imagined:



Underneath my pillow lay a playing card, a club, like the number 11, and with some kind of red ink, a drawing was visible, a small face with ";)"
