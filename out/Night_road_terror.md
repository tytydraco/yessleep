Let me preface the story by saying that I always thought that the supernatural does not exist.  To my knowledge nothing creepy has ever happened to me or my family. I never believed in horror stories or the like.

I have not seen my father in a long time.  So when the invitation came,  I gladly took the offer. It has been a year and a half since my last visit. 

When I arrived,  we talked a bit about the time we all lived in Colorado.  When my mom and him were still together.  After they broke up he moved to Pennsylvania. I always wondered why he didn't stay in Colorado.  With the money he earned he could have easily had a 4-room apartment and keep his friends. 

I asked him this time.  I thought,  whatever reason he would give, I'd understand.  We are both adults after all. 

I was not prepared for his story. 

He told me that he used to be a truck driver back in the 90s. Mostly delivery and pick-ups. He traveled all across Utah. And one time he accepted a delivery to Oklahoma, a well-paid easy job. 

It was winter and he was driving to the delivery point.  He was very relaxed,  admired the beautiful winter landscape,  business as usual.   He reached the delivery point, unloaded his cargo and drove back. He did have to take a different road however due to snow blocking the interstate he used to get there.

So he is driving back, passing a few small villages and into the woods. He has been driving for 20 or 30 miles by now. No other cars present.  He was paying attention to the road as he saw a man standing on the side.

" I thought it was a tree stump at first ". My father says " I thought he was lost. Why would you wander the woods in winter?"

My dad hit the brakes ( but due to the snow the truck kept sliding down the road). After a glance in the rear view mirror he saw the man still standing there. So my dad leaned out the window and yelled " hey! Do you need a ride?"

The man slowly turned around,  stared for a few seconds and then slowly started approaching.  

" It was at this point I felt something being wrong " I can see my dad's hand shaking." I mean,  at first he looked like a normal guy- jeans,  a grey t-shirt,  a cap, sport shoes". But as the man came closer,  my dad noticed his eyes. ..they were easily three times the size of normal human eyes. And his upper teeth were protruding from under his lips.

My dad "shat himself ", rolled up the window and floored it. The man started chasing him. My dad sped up, but the man kept running after him.  At this point he is driving 60- 70 miles per hour but the strange man still keeps up. Then another joins him. And then three more run out of the forest and give chase.

My father was bawling at this point. " Either I lose control of the truck and crash or those creatures do me in" were his thoughts at the moment. He does not remember how he got out of the forest. The creatures did not follow him beyond the tree line.

My father drove straight to a gas station ( you know the kind, with cheap food and shitty parking). Tears streaming down his face he told the gas station owner everything.  Yet that dude was just laughing at my father,  saying that he should cut down on the booze, otherwise he'll see more things like  that. So after a while my dad was "fuck it", the owner clearly didn't believe him. My dad ordered some whisky, paid for the parking spot and went to sleep in his truck.

"I woke up at night" my dad says "had to use the bathroom ". It was dark. No lights were on. So my father decided to switch on the car lights to get to the toilet. Once the sweepers ran across the windshield he saw the creatures stand around him.

"Ten of them" my dad says and his voice almost fails him "ten of them, standing around,  staring at me with those abominable eyes. One had blood dripping down from his mouth". 
My dad's only thought was "Fuck!" . He hit the signal horn,  the truck roared and the creatures scattered.  My dad immediately floored it from the gas station,  speeding all the while.

" The worst part" he says " was not seeing anything.  If they were chasing me still". He drove through to Colorado without sleeping. 

After this my father developed a habit of getting up at night and looking out the window . He says that he began to fear the creatures,  that they found out where he lives. 

And one night he saw them. Three of them,  standing underneath the streetlight. Staring up at him with those horrible eyes of theirs. 
My father immediately bolted the door,  covered up the windows and called up a friend who was also staying late. He spent the entire night talking to his friend, so he wouldn't feel alone.

Next day my father immediately packed a bag and got on a train to Connecticut to visit some relatives.  From there he put up his flat on sale and moved to California. He now lives in the center of the city in a rundown two rooms apartment. 

"But at least I never saw those creatures again " he says.
