I've been friends with Lacie since we were kids, it was one of those school friendships that was never separated. Now we're roommates in the local college, and it was the best decision I made.
Lacie was apart of this college club, that she told me in absolute confidence and told me not to say a word to anyone about it, she's gone for the club activities every night until three in the morning. This never bothered me though as I would spend most of that time sleeping or studying for an upcoming test.

One day, Lacie set up a large freezer. One of those kinds you lift a lid to open and she told me anything in there was strictly hers and I was not to be in it at all.
I was a bit confused at this, she told me like a mother would tell her kid not to eat dessert before dinner, but I shrugged it off since I didn't want her to get angry.
It wasn't until two days later that I heard something in the kitchen, it was around three in the morning and it sounded like something being dragged on the floor.

Now that I think about it, this should have been a red flag. At the time though, I acted like I got up to go to the bathroom and coincidentally seen Lacie in the kitchen. The light was on, the middle edge of the freezer lid was covered in something red as well as Lacie's hands.
She caught me and I knew she did, she stared at me for a moment before speaking.

"Sorry if I woke you, I just brought some meat home."

I nodded groggy and decided to just go back to bed, acting like I wouldn't remember anything the morning. She knew me well enough that I did that.
The next morning though, I remembered everything and luckily she went to her classes earlier than I did. I was curious so I went into our small dorm kitchen and looked at the freezer infront of me. I opened it casually to see something I wish I could erase. 

There was a man, or what used to be one. His body was naked and mangled, his limbs cut off of his torso and stored neatly beside him with a weird symbol carved into his now frozen stomach.
I almost threw up, and my mind froze and the next thing I knew I was in my room sobbing. I dont know how long I was there, but Lacie was still in class. Now I didn't know what to do.
I thought that it would be the best option to call the cops, then my mind went back to how she would feel if I ruined her life. She was my friend and it was stupid of me to try to defend her.


It's been about a week since I seen the freezer, and the feeling never left. Every time I see Lacie it makes my stomach turn, at least two more nights I heard her putting something in it. 

Until one day, Lacie didn't come back. She left for a club meeting and it's now been three days since I've seen her, and I started panicking more when I seen her phone in her room. I looked in the freezer to see the body gone, and the only thing in it was bloody remains as well as a few cut organs.
I know it was invading her privacy, but I eventually checked her phone but the one thing I found was a calender event named;

"Final Day."

The location had an address that I've never heard of, but with the ominous look of the name I grabbed my small pistol and got in my car and drove to the location.
Out of the public, sat a large abandoned warehouse. My phone told me I arrived and took the gun out of the glove compartment before I went inside.
It wasn't hard to, the main door was locked but the window close to the ground was shattered so I simply climbed in. The building was overall dark, the only light coming through a room that was blocked by a large metal door with a single window. I went to it and stood on my toes to see inside.

I seen Lacie laying on her back in the middle of a circle of people in cloaks, she was clearly dead. Her body sliced in a fashion that showed it meant something. The wounds were planned and cut with the appropriate tools, as I stood in shock one of the cloaked people looked back.
For what felt like hours we made eye contact, but I had enough time to run before they came out.

As I write this I'm in a supply closet, I dont think they can find me here but I feel hopeless without Lacie. I wish I could have been there for her more, but if they find me I'll get a second chance to be.
