I swear it, I saw a representation of the fourth dimension behind my cat’s ear. No exaggeration, no bullshit. Straight up. The fourth dimension was behind my feline friend’s furry ear.

That’s not even the strangest thing though. Contrary to Hollywood tropes, I wasn’t the only person to witness it. In fact, I live with my 72-year-old mother who not only can see it, but can describe it in lucrative detail, the wildest part? She didn’t question nor query at the very possibility of this occurring. Perhaps out of logistical reasoning, I consulted to get a differing opinion on my main reddit account – years of source analysis in university taught me a 72-year-old high school dropout is not a reliable source of clarity. Despite the clear disconnect between my mother’s mind and practical reality, she was not only backed by the “greatest” minds the internet had to offer but was also reprimanded for “foolishly wasting everyone’s time with my idiotic lunacy.” It would be no surprise to say I was dumbfounded by this response. “Get off your high horse and join us in the real world where this is normal” Stated user 1<3ChineseF1ngerTr4ps. “Can we stop allowing conspiracy theorist luneys onto these forums?” wept $Cheesesniffer35. “The fourth dimension? Isn’t that one of our 6 that we already have” pondered Nutlicker5. Perhaps I was thinking about this the wrong way I thought. I need professionals to take a look at Mrs. Nibblington and study the strange metaphysical event occurring behind her ear.

I took my beloved cat to my university and presented her to my lecturer. Although she was a social studies professor, she had told me about her time in university studying metaphysics. And as we were close, I decided to present my case to her first for a proper opinion. So, there I was, cat in arms, showing my professor the strange phenomenon behind its ear. “okay…” she trailed off, giving me a puzzled complexion. “What do you make of it” I insisted. “Look, I’m not a vet mark, the fourth dimension has conjured behind her ear and that’s that.” I didn’t even respond, just following her diagnosis with a blank stare. “Don’t get worked up over it man…these things happen all the time.” She decided calmly, placing her hand on my shoulder as if consoling me. “Fuckin’ A” was all I could muster before storming out of the room with Mrs. Nibbleton.

I had come home deflated, deciding to not further any discourse with other lecturers. I mean if my professor didn’t care, why would any other? Flawed logic I know, but I felt so defeated by the short interaction that preceded by departure, I didn’t even really care.

 “Mark is that you?” I heard my mother call from the kitchen, I walked in to be greeted by my mother and Uncle Jack. A spindly man who always seemed to leave an uncomfortable presence in his wake. Dinner smelt almost ready and here I was: 23-year-old fast food employee, holding the cat looking like a crazed maniac. “Where’d you run off to” Chirped Jack, his voice grazing along my ears like a knife waiting to penetrate my skin. Before I had time to respond, my mother interjected “He’s working on a project for university” she chimed. I snapped back with an untethered rage I’ve felt building in my stomach all day “That’s not what I’m doing!” I calmed my nerves before continuing “Look, Uncle, I saw Mrs. Nibbleton this afternoon had a strange mark on the backside of her ear, upon closer inspection, I found that it was a physical representation of the fourth dimension, and for some odd reason, no one gives a flying fuck.” Clearly the more I kept explaining, the more worked up I was becoming. So, in an effort to calm me down, my uncle reprimanded the cat and remarked in a nasally voice. “Let me take a look at it”, “She” I muttered. He peered behind the ear and took an inquisitive look at the anomaly. “Huh…that’s pretty cool Mark! You did this yourself?” Holding back from a half assed sarcastic response, I instead opted for something more rational. “What do you mean? It’s the fourth dimension; how would I have even conjured that?” Jack looked back with an unblinking stare, one of condemnation. “Ill give it to you kid, you’ve got passion. Whatever science competition your entering, I think you’ll claim the top spot.” I threw my hands skyward in defeat and scuttled away to the sanctity of my room, and I heard the pitter-patter of Mrs. Nibbletons paws following me swiftly.

By this point, it should be abundantly clear that I’m not getting anywhere. I have effectively wasted 3 pages of exposition to further this escapade, nothing but an inch. All that I’ve reconciled is that everyone has simply gone crazy. I need to further this by conducting my own research. I glanced at my cat lying so helplessly on my bed, eyes closed, as comfy as can be, and as if I was ripping her from a dream of comfort and catnip, I picked her up and placed her on my desk. I demanded that she stay still and produced a can of tuna I have lying around to keep her in once place. I pulled her ear forward to glimpse a better look at the fourth dimension, and with slow and cautious hands, I started sliding a pencil that was lying on my desk, comfortably into the hole within reality. No force pulled in, nor did one exert outwards. It didn’t puncture my poor cat and instead disappeared into the hole. When I returned the pencil from her ear, I expected to see it fully formed, instead, the part that had gone inside had disappeared, when I moved the pencil in any direction, I caught glimpses of what was left: fragmentated prisms with non-Euclidean geometry. It was a marvel, disappearing when its shape bent beyond the horizon of my 3^(rd) dimensional understanding, and glimpsing back when passing through the plane of my perception. I furrowed my brow; my memory of the pencil has changed. I know this now, but in the moment, my perception of the pencil had always been that of the impossible shape. Even when I bought it. It always was, always will be. Then I let out a frustrated sigh.

This is the biggest discovery in modern science, and so far, even with proof, I’m played as nothing more than an ignorant fool. This should rightfully change the world. Yet, it hasn’t, and with everyone’s reaction so far, I believe it can’t. With that closing internal remark, Mrs. Nibbleton lept from the desk and out of my room as she starts her nightly prowl around the neighborhood.

I spent the evening having leftovers from dinner, and making awkward small talk with my uncle, who persisted in mentioning the previous conversation we shared on the cat. I persuaded to move onto more benign conversation topics. “How’s the job search?” “Any luck with the dating game?” “Any interesting university classes?” Y’know, family stuff. Early turned late and I returned to my bedroom, the door cracked open and not a light left on for me to safely make a passage to my bed. My heart raced to my throat; I heard a noise that usually does not emanate from my room. A faint mechanical whirring echoed throughout my four walls. I walked closer to my bed to hear the mechanical sound turn to feline purring. Mrs. Nibbleton lay on my bed, basking in the slight illumination peering through my half-closed blinds. Unfortunately to sleep I would have to disturb the sleeping cat. A price I was more than willing to pay. Though when I moved her from the clearly comfortable position, she hissed in such a volatile tone id never experienced from her before. The most reasonable though; she was pissed that I went digging around in her personal pocket dimension. Thankfully, she moved, nonetheless. And I finally got to put this strange day to rest, tomorrow I’d do more personal research and construct a plan to find a way to bring this thing to mainstream news.

I drifted in and out when I heard a faint thud, as if footsteps were approaching my bed, not soft enough to be the cat, not loud enough to be human. Then I felt a cool draft of air blow across my neck, the windows were closed. Its hand rested upon my shoulder, and I slowly opened my eyes. I could see it, but I also could not. As if it were the pencil, but alive.
