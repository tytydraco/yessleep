When I was very young I remember watching a very fun tv show. I don’t exactly remember what it was called but I remember sitting by the television set and tuning into it and watching it with my older sister. 3:34 April 19 2023

I made it my mission to figure out the name of this show. So I contacted my sister to get a few answers from her..

She told me that it was a show called “Saviors of the Deep” and it aired around 6pm every night in the early 90s.

Memories began flooding back to me as I heard the name. I remembered the names of the characters that I enjoyed during the short run of the show.

Marcie, she was the main character, she explored the deep along with her best friend Arnold. Arnold had been a very shy and anxious person who wasn’t so keen on doing her adventures. There’s was also a villain… but I don’t remember his name.. 6:05pm April 21

10:42am April 23; I found out the name of the villain. His name was Julius The Terrible and he was just a hooded person without a fact who lived in the depths of the ocean. He had always tried to stop Marcie and Arnold by sabotaging their air supply and they had to solve puzzles to fix it. It seemed very educational considering the other shows that were on.

The villain was always so creepy to me. He carried a giant knife thing that he used to slash the air supply each time. He also had an assistant who was completely red with deep black eyes who spoke in a screechy yet childlike voice and followed Julius everywhere he went.

The show was weird.. as I remember a dream I had where I was in the show with my sister and we had to do what Marcie and Arnold did while seeing ourselves outside of the tv watching. It was a very distinct dream and I remember it as if it really happened. I loved the show so it wouldn’t be a surprise if I had dreams about it.

April 28 2023 I wanted to know more about the show so I asked my mother if she remembered it. She said that we had watched it every single day after school, which she couldn’t understand since every day had a new episode and that wasn’t very likely for a whole 3 years of watching. She also recalled one week where the show was on 24/7 and the characters seemed like they were talking to her.

“I went a little crazy watching that show everyday,” she said. She also recalled during this week, me and my sister watched the television without leaving the living room, and we only slept when she slept, at least she had hoped that we did. She pulled out a family movie in which she had one for every week we watched the show. We decided to watch them in order to see what we looked like as young kids, and invited my sister to watch with us.

We watched them all night until we got to the week in question. The video started off very normal as our mom had gone to the living room with her camera and started talking to us. We turned around and our eyes were BLACK like completely black. We all screamed and stepped back…

We heard the video continue as I heard the show screaming for help, calling our mom’s name and asking her to turn the tv off as the kids in her living room were not them…

Then the memories started flooding back to that week…

The kids had gotten sucked out of the tv set and replaced with us, they tapped on the screen and said that they would replace us and to hope that we could have our lives return to normal.

We spent the whole week with the tv on waiting for my mom to turn it off so we could swap back, but she could never hear us properly. We had wanted to go back to what we were used to but it was unlikely that we would.

At the end of the week our mom had turned the tv off since it was wasting electricity.

More memories flooded back as I remembered life before that incident. Me and my sister had not returned to our normal lives after that week… my sister was not the child my mom thought she was. I wasn’t either, my sister’s name used to be Arnold, and she was my best friend, two of the viewers of the show had struck a deal with Julius the terrible to replace us and finally live out their dreams of being us. 

They had replaced us and lived our lives for week. As a part of their deal, we could not speak until it was too late to come back. When the girls realized it was so hard to live our lives, they wanted to come back, but as the rules stated they only had a week, and their mom did not realize the switch till it was too late. We had been living lives that weren’t our own, it was easier that way but had it been worth it to the girls?

Their mom clicked on the final video, it was a recording of the show’s final episode. She had left for the bathroom before the ending so she hadn’t watched what happened in the end. We checked the end of the show and…they had died. They finally drowned, they or more specifically me and “my sister’s” original body had been gone for years…no wonder the show ended.
