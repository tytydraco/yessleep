My eyes fluttered open, but I had to immediately squint from a blinding light over me. Trying to relieve the pain of my burning cornea, I turned my head away. A long, thin, metal pole next to me became visible as my vision’s blur subsided. My eyes trailed up, focusing on an I.V bag hanging at the top of it. I was confused for a moment before my surroundings came into focus. I was laying in a bed with handrails. I immediately knew it was a hospital bed. I remember being surprised at how comfy it was. I could hear the front desk phone ringing like it always seemed to be in hospitals. There was the bustling of people and papers coming from behind me. I rolled over and looked out of my hospital door. I could see the hallway had people walking past the door from left to right and right to left. I felt like I was on a different plane of existence, watching them move without being seen. A voice squawked over the P.A system making an illegible announcement.

  
I laid there for a while thinking about Henry. My mind was so full of questions that it made the room spin…or maybe it was my concussion. It was probably my concussion.

  
As if summoned by my thoughts Henry’s head peaked in from the hallway. I sat up a little and had to bite my tongue. I felt like a dam, holding back a sea of questions, keeping Henry from drowning. He looked guilty as he walked over to me. He could probably see the overwhelming amount of things I wanted to ask him. The temptation to question him grew as I spotted a book in his hand. It looked old and weathered. It was bound in leather and the pages looked like they had been dunked in coffee and left out to dry. It was obvious that it was old and had been used for decades, possibly centuries. He slowly approached me like I was a scared deer. I didn’t feel any anger towards Henry but maybe my lack of anger made him more scared of me. He pulled up a chair and sat down, setting the book down in his lap before scooping my hand up into his. “I’m so sorry Levi. I thought you were the one who was bringing those monsters into the bar…”

  
My laugh cut off the flood of apologies that were about to fill the space between us. “I thought you were the one who was bringing those things into the bar.” I smiled at him, “I take it I was wrong huh?” His genuine smile broke through his guilt and sadness.

  
“I’m not bringing them to the bar, I'm trying to get rid of them.”

  
That made me pause as I absorbed what he said. He could probably see my brain actively blue screening, so he spoke up. He talked slowly trying not to overwhelm me. “You see..” He holds up the book. “...I have this. It’s a book that has been passed down in my family for a long time. It contains different…” He pauses considering his words.

  
I finish his train of thought. “Spells? Like some Harry Potter shit?”  


He chuckles, “I guess they are ‘spells.’ He says with feigned irritation. “My family called them rituals. I don’t have the luxury of waving a wand around and having things happen. I have to complete specific criteria for each ritual for them to be successful.”  


Some questions leak through the dam. “Is that what you were doing at the bar?”  


Henry’s head swayed side to side as if to say, yeah kind of. “Ever since I realized the amount of things happening in that building was unnatural, I’ve been trying to find a way to fix it.” For the first time I saw Henry’s face grow grim. He seemed to age 30 years right in front of me. “The cost to expel those things is…heavy.”

  
“W-what do you mean?” The old Henry had been replaced by this grizzled war veteran. Out of all the things to come from the bar, what was in front of me was the scariest by far.

  
He took a deep breath that seemed to hold the weight of the world. “Whenever I have to go through with a ritual I must make a sacrifice.” He breaks eye contact with me to look off into the distance. The more demanding my goal for the ritual is, the more I have to sacrifice.” He chuckled slightly as he looked down at his hand. If there was any humor in it I didn’t hear it. “Some of those things in that bar do not want to leave…For example, that fryer demon? It loved the bar. That thing wanted nothing more than to stay there and torment anyone unlucky enough to hear its whispers.” I shuddered a bit. The fryer demon didn’t bother me much anymore when it learned I was able to ignore it. That’s why it went after Henry, it knew that I would be devastated if anything happened to him.  


Henry cut into my thoughts, “the only sacrifice I could make that was strong enough to get rid of it…was my soul. Well part of it at least.”  


I stuttered bewildered, which seemed to be becoming a common state of being around Henry these days. “Y-your soul?”  


Henry casually nodded. “I used two rituals that night. One was to expel the demon…the other…well…that was a resurrection ritual.” Flashes of Henry’s mangled and disfigured body forced their way into my mind. As if able to see what I was thinking, he nodded slowly, “that ritual can only be used four times. Every time you use it it rips a quarter of your soul out as an offering to the gods…” His voice became heavier as he spoke, “shredding a soul like that isn’t easy though. You must go through excruciating pain. This weakens your soul allowing it to be ripped apart.”  


“What happens if you do the ritual four times?”

  
Henry shrugged, “as far as I can tell no one in my family has ever done it. A few people have sacrificed themselves three times, but by that point your soul is too weak to run your body. You become a shell of your former self and are almost like a walking corpse. Out of my family members who have dared to do it three times…multiple became possessed by other spirits. The small amount of a soul they had left couldn’t compete against a full soul…and another chance at life is tempting for lots of wandering spirits stuck on our plane.”

  
His matter-of-fact speech was making it a little harder to absorb all of this information. The tone would have fit better in a McDonald’s drive thru, rather than telling me that he had a magic book that he used to cast these wild spells. I massaged my temples with my pointer and middle finger, trying to alleviate the headache I was developing. “Okay Henry. I’m going to need some time to process this.”  


“One more thing.” He patted my hand gently. The most positive emotion I’d seen out of him since we started this conversation. “I know this is a lot.”

  
I wasn’t sure if I could take more, but waved him on to continue anyway. “Okay,” he started up again, “this book also has rituals to summon these kinds of monsters.” He tapped the cover of the book gently. “Whoever is causing these monsters to appear has a book similar to mine. It won’t be exactly the same, because their family would have slightly different rituals but it would be very similar results. I don’t know why they want to summon those creatures, but I know they are incredibly dangerous.”  
For the first time I wondered if it was one of our patrons. So many drifters flow in and out of those doors, it wouldn’t be hard to hide among them every night. They could also be one of our regulars. People that greet Tommy or our servers with a smile, before they summon a monster that brings an end to their life. The thought made me sick and I pushed it away for the time being.

  
“Usually it is forbidden for my family to share this information with outsiders.” Henry lifted his head to look into my eyes. I suddenly thought of the phrase, “if I tell you, I’d have to kill you.” I immediately became aware of how dry my throat was. I swallowed hard trying to rid the sandpaper that had replaced my windpipe. “But I felt like I needed help and who else was better than one of my most trusted friends.” A wide, genuine smile broke through the grim fog that had covered his face. “So would you like to help me save some lives?”

  
His smile, as always, was infectious. I couldn’t help but return one of my own. “Of course I will, but what can I do? I don’t have any fancy pants magic.” I wiggle my fingers at him mockingly  
Henry cracked the book open. “Well…Hopefully you liked school because we have a lot of studying to do.” My face fell as I groaned covering it with my hands. I always hated school…

  
For the next few weeks I felt like I was in high school again but it was a hundred times worse. I left the hospital the day Henry visited and he came home with me. He crashed on my couch at night, we’d go to work together, then he would teach me everything he knew. Sometimes he would leave to go exercise or investigate the things at the bar. No matter how much I punished he wouldn’t let me go with him. He said it was too dangerous and I’d get in his way more than anything. I made him promise he wouldn’t do any more resurrection rituals for the time being. He agreed, but even without doing those rituals he would come home exhausted after expelling a monster.

  
It took me about a week to really get the hang of the rituals. So here’s what I learned:   
First, carving symbols into your arms is meant to reach out to certain deities. The pain combined with opening yourself up to them, gets their attention. It pretty much tells them you want to make a sacrifice to them in exchange for their power.

  
Second, The symbols are the name of the deity and which tells that deity that they alone are being called. If you don’t use a name and only reach out with pain…well…Henry didn’t know what would happen, but it was plastered all over the book to never do it.

  
Third, you tell the deity what you want using that strange language that Henry was using on me and the fryer demon. This was the hardest part for me to learn but I think I got the hang of it…I think…I hope.

  
Finally, well…this is more of a warning than an actual step…Henry warned me to be very careful about how I do the rituals. These deities aren’t the most benevolent so, if I fail the ritual in any way like, summoning the wrong one or mispronouncing the words, or anything like that; then they are liable to take more than what you offer for sacrifice or just outright drag you into their plane of existence…probably to do unspeakable things to you for eternity.

  
One interesting thing I learned was that you can use tattoos instead of carving symbols, but Henry said it was a lot fuzzier on the rules. You call out for the deity you have tattooed on you by name. But…since you didn’t use pain to reach out to them, they will often make up for it by causing you pain themselves along with taking your sacrifice; or worse, they will increase the sacrificial demand to make up for the lack of pain. Seems kind of messed up to me, but I guess I’m not an all powerful deity so…what do I know?

  
After the weeks of grueling magic cramming was over with, Henry wanted to have me do my first exorcism. I could tell he was nervous which actually made me feel better about how nervous I felt.  
We broke into the bar that night. It was dark and quiet. I had flashes again, to the night Henry expelled the fryer demon back to whatever horrible place it came from. I shook those thoughts out of my head and took a deep breath. I felt Henry’s hand fall on my shoulder. I looked over at him. Even though I could barely see his face in the dark, I could see it had confidence in me. This made me feel a lot better knowing he was there to help me. 

  
We had decided to not bring any flashlights because we didn’t want people to see them through the windows. It was unlikely anyone in this area would call the police but we didn’t want to risk it.  
When we were driving to the bar, Henry had explained that, usually we would have to find a way to bait out the monsters before we were able to expel them. But with the one we had in mind, we knew there would be no need for that.

  
We walked into the dining room.The car lights that periodically passed by the windows caused shadows to slowly extend from the decrepit furniture, before darting across the floor and disappearing as the car passed. This would ruin our night vision and we would have to wait until our eyes adjusted to avoid running into anything; that was until another car would pass by and ruin it again. 

  
Eventually we stood by the computer where servers would enter in the customers’ orders. My voice seemed to carry and echo across the whole building, “Heather? Are you here?”   
Henry and I stood facing the dining room when cold hands touched our shoulders. I jumped and saw Henry do the same out of the corner of my eye. We both quickly turned and saw heather standing right behind us. She seemed to delight in the fright she gave us and giggled. The sound seemed to echo and stack on top of itself, making a strange ethereal sound. She had a dull blue glow that lit up the area around us. Her sentences began and ended with what sounded like a soft whoosh of air. “Hello, I’ll be your server today. What can I get for you?” I could tell she was teasing us as she let out another small ethereal laugh.

  
Henry spoke first. “We are here to free you Heather.” His words were soft and kind, like a father comforting their crying child. Heather seemed to know what we were here for and her smile widened. Henry looked at me and I took a deep breath, slipping my hand into my pocket. The light from a passing car made the pocket knife glint as I popped out the blade. I glanced up at Henry for reassurance then to Heather, as I held my arm away from me slightly. Heather’s face had a mix of sympathy and gratitude as she watched patiently. I held the inside of my forearm up, as I gathered my courage. Until finally…I started.

  
The blade slid deep into my flesh. I started on the first of the five symbols as burning pain shot through me, my nerves practically begged me to stop. I gritted my teeth as I slowly carved the symbol into my arm. First one was done… I had to be careful not to make a mistake on the angle and orientation of the lines. I needed each symbol to be perfect. Second one was done… My body shrieked at me to stop or go faster to get it over with, I ignored it. I tried to focus on the dripping sound my blood made as it fell from my arm and pooled on the floor. Third symbol done… At this point I was thinking, Damn why’d it’s name have to be so long? Fourth symbol done… My hand shook and my vision blurred as I worked on the last symbol. It was one of the more complex ones, because of course it was. My heart beat pounded so loud in my ears, that I wouldn’t have been able to hear Henry if he was shouting inches from me. I felt pressure building behind my eyes and sweat drip down the side of my face. Final symbol done.

  
I gave into my body’s demands, finally pulling the knife from my arm. It slipped from my hand and clattered to the ground as I bent over with my hands on my knees gasping for breath. It felt like I had just run a marathon.

  
 After catching my breath enough to stand straight, I looked up at Henry who put a sympathetic hand on my shoulder. This gesture was enough to help me ignore the pound that had migrated from my ears to my bloody arm.

  
I suddenly felt my hair stand on end. The air around me felt charged as if lightning was about to strike where I stood. Henry must have seen my eyes widen and nodded his understanding. He smiled like a proud father. I reached out to Heather and she took my hand with a hopeful smile, I returned one in kind. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. I ran the phrase I learned for this over and over again in my head. When I was confident I’d get it right I opened my eyes again. I hoped I had gotten used to the tongue twisting language Henry taught me. My request to the deity, whose power ran through me, sounded like, “ph-elle is-th rite-spy spa no oot ray-whay hess ongs-bell.” As I finished the last word, I suddenly felt like I just stuck a fork into an outlet. All the electricity in the air around me instantly entered my body. I felt a current shoot from my head, down my arm, and into my fingers. Heather and I jumped at the same time but kept a firm grip on each other's hands.

  
A look of pure joy on Heather’s face as she looked over my shoulder. Tears began to stream down her translucent face as her hand came up to her mouth in surprise. At the same time, I could feel her hand becoming warmer, as if she was coming back to life. Her glow went from a dull blue to a warm white. The area around us began to become brighter. I was worried for a moment that I may have pronounced the words wrong or summoned the wrong deity. I imagined Heather becoming human again before hands break through the ground, pulling me to my eternity of torment. As I saw these flashes of the worst case scenario, Heather's hand slipped out of mine. She walked through me as if I wasn’t even there. Instead of the frigid, spine chilling cold I expected; a warm, almost calming feeling swept through me. I turned and watched Heather walk towards the middle of the dining room. She passed right through all the furniture as she went. She turned to me and I could see the few tears had turned to a full river of salty joy,  as she waved at me.

  
“Thank you...” Her words were sweet and warm as they echoed around in my head. It seemed to bounce around even as she turned and took a step forward, fading from sight. Heather’s light faded as her spirit did, plunging me and Henry into darkness again. I felt tears fall down my cheeks as I looked at where she once stood. I turned to Henry, who was sniffling and rubbing his eyes. I wiped my hand across mine too and put a comforting hand on Henry’s shoulder. 

  
“That’s two down” …And who knows how many more to go, I thought but didn’t verbalize it. Henry and I both knew that we had a lot more work to do. I suddenly fell forward, Henry was barely able to catch me to prevent me from hitting the ground.

  
The ritual had practically drained me of all my strength. Henry struggled to carry me back to my car but eventually we got there. When he got me home I laid on the couch and called Dave, leaving him a voicemail telling him I was sick and wouldn’t be able to make it to work. That night my sleep was restless and full of nightmares of monstrous, giant, gods that slowly ripped me apart. First my flesh, then my muscle, and finally, they ground my bones to dust which they used to create a universe full of more demonic and horrifying creatures. A universe full of chaos and violence that never ended. I woke up in a cold sweat the next day hoping that it wasn’t some sort of omen.
