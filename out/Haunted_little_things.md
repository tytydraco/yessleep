Anna woke up to the sound of water running in the bathroom and smiled. Vincent has always been the morning bird, but it seems that his routine was being postponed lately  to not wake her up.

Thinking of surprising him, she got up to brew some coffee. The delicious smell traversed the rooms of the small apartment. The sound of cutlery livened up the home a bit. Vincent uttered a muffled curse. Maybe he cut himself while shaving? After pouring a cup for herself, she turned on the TV and watched the news while putting her hair up in a messy bun, waiting for him to be done in the bathroom. They were showing a new development of an infamous case, a murder, in which new evidence proved that the suspect was innocent. She let out a sigh, dropping the blue mug on the small table. All those criminals always ended up running free, didn't they?

She felt his presence behind her, his light steps unnoticeable in the soft carpet, but his breathing was so well-know she thought she could recognize it anywhere. Turning around to face him, she saw a look of worry crossing by, then fear, then relief. He got up, grabbed his bag and left without touching the coffee, and she thought for a moment he would ignore her too. Maybe things between them weren't as resolved as she thought. In the last second, he briefly turned around and said, almost as a whisper: "See you later, love", gazing at her with a hint of pain, a little distant, which made sure to her that something was yet to develop, but not now. He was late for work.

"see ya" she answered, blowing a kiss. He closed the door. His steps grew less and less audible as he walked away. She started washing the dishes and thinking about what to do next. Maybe cleaning up the bedroom? Vincent hated when she declutered the home, being so defensive over throwing anything away. Lately he has even picked stuff up back from the trash. He hasn't always been like this, she remembered. When they met, he was such a minimalist and organized man. But random crap is like a disease, it catches up to you the older you get. You start wondering if you'd miss that old ass shirt, the faded love letters, the expired credit cards even. Well, not declutering then. Perhaps a run to the store? The idea of an elaborate dinner to go with their talk later was pleasant. This could lighten things up.

When Vincent came back, the cursed word he dropped before turned into a torrent of ugly, messy improperies. This broke Anna's heart. She has just finished putting the food on the table, the scent of pasta mixed with homemade tomato sauce and olive oil overpowering everything else, the plates impeccably set up, an unopened bottle of wine. Simple and delicious. And yet, one look inside the home and he was already so annoyed. His face turned into a tearful mess. She went to touch his hair, a gesture of comfort repeated many times, but he shivered away from her tpuch and angrily got up.

"why are you doing this to me?" he asked, but didn't waited for an answer. Passing by her in a rush, he closed the bedroom door. She could hear him trying to calm himself down by breathing in and out several times. After a couple of minutes he must have dialed a number, because she could hear his side of a conversation on the phone, loud and clear.

"I know what you are going to say, but just listen, ok? Please. At least, if you don't believe me... Can you humor me after everything I've been going through? Don't tell me that. I'm not trying to guilt trip you, I just need someone to listen. Ok, so it happened again. I swear to God someone brew coffee while I was getting ready. The TV was on. Then, the house was clean and there was a fucking 3 course meal on the table when I came from work. And worst of all, her cup. It was by the sink, as if she had just drank her tea from it while cooking... I think I'm losing my mind, or there's someone out there who thinks this is all a funny joke. Do you have any idea of who could be doing this? ".

He listened for a long time. Her heart was so tight in her chest, a knot in her throat, the seconds falling silently around them with such a heavy weight. Finally, his voice cut the air again, calmer, collected.

" OK. I understand. Worth a shot, doesn't it?".

he laughed without humor, the way you do when something is unbelievable and you are still trying to make sense of it.

"I can't believe I'm going to try that. It's all kinds of crazy, you know that? Yes, I know. And the police tomorrow too. Maybe the psychiatrist. It's just... Well. Sure. OK, talk to you tomorrow. Love ya too. Bye".

The call ended and he let out a light, broken sigh, and if he was afraid of making sound. She saw the door opening, his broad shoulders crossing it, and pretty soon they were both sitting in the living room. Avoiding her eyes, he grabbed something from the counter and keep looking at it while collecting his thoughts. Without looking up, he started talking.

"Hi Anna. Is that really you?".

"what... Do you mean? Of course it's me", she said.

"ok, I'll leave this on the table. Can you move it  for me, please?".

his voice trembled, he seemed desperate. She shrugged and moved the picture to where it belongs. It was one of her selfies, the one that she had liked. Her smile was bright and the wind made her hair flow beautifully, one of her hands holding her hat down. All in all, a very natural, spontaneous shot. He kept looking at the picture, his eyes growing wilder, waiting, and when the frame touched the fireplace, he howled in some kind of raw emotion she couldn't understand.

"you have been here all this time? Why?".

But at this point, she realized she could talk until her face turned blue, and he was never going to listen. More than that, he had such a pained look, she was afraid of the next words he was going to say.

"Anna... You... Didn't realized it?".

A faint memory returned to her. She had lunch with her mom, and it ended later than expected. Vincent and her were supposed to go to a party later. A man stopped her asking for some information, and she waved her hand, rushingly, and continued running, but he pushed her to the ground and dragged her. Something... Happened. But when she got up, her body felt unharmed, and the guy was nowhere to be seen. She arrived one hour late to the party, and Vincent was so pissed he didn't even looked at her. Didn't even heard her out. Those past few days, she saw him really overreacting, angry and crying. Only now she knew why.

"those little things moving around... It was all you?". he chuckled-cried. "oh God. Should I still see a psychologist after that now?".

He waited, and waited, but she didn't know what to say or do. She felt exhausted. Unanswered, he ended up going to bed, and she did too. His hand was so warm on hers. Her eyes closed, and little by little, her body lightned as she drifted to sleep and every thought disappeared.

The next day, the apartment was silent. The haunted little things never moved again.
