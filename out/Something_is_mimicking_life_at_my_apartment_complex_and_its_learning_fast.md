I've lived at Riverbend Apartments for eight months now. It's a quiet complex in the suburbs, three buildings arranged around a central courtyard, maybe sixty units total. The kind of place where you recognize your neighbors' cars and know which residents could care less about leaving their lights on all night. I picked it specifically because it felt safe and predictable after living downtown for years.

The safe feeling, however, became fleeting.

I should have known something was wrong when Lorrie from Building 2 started complaining about the skunk.

It began in late October. Every few nights, she'd post in the Riverbend Apartments group chat about a "rabid skunk" getting into the dumpsters behind Building 2. According to her, it was unusually aggressive, knocking over trash cans and making "awful noises" around 2 AM. She'd taken to keeping her elderly cat indoors, worried about a confrontation.

I didn't think much of it initially. Urban wildlife getting bolder isn't uncommon, especially as winter approaches and food becomes scarce. But Lorrie's descriptions were oddly specific for someone viewing a skunk from her second-floor window in the dark.

"It doesn't move right," she wrote in one message. "And it's way too big. Skunks aren't that big, are they?"

A few other residents chimed in with their own sightings. Always around the same time, always near the dumpsters, always described as "acting strange" or "too bold." Management promised to contact animal control, though I doubt they ever did. Property managers aren't known for their swift action on tenant complaints.

The skunk sightings continued for about two weeks before the reports shifted.

In mid-November, the complaints changed to a "stray cat." Same general area, same timeframe, but now residents were describing a large, dark cat that hung around the parking lot of Building 3 and 1. Unlike the skunk, this cat seemed curious about people rather than avoiding them. More sightings came through, the residents taking to the group chat.

"It follows me to my car," Kevin from Building 1 added. "Just sits there watching while I load groceries. Doesn't run when I get close, doesn't make any sounds. Kind of creepy, honestly."

Sarah from Building 1 mentioned seeing it on her balcony one morning, though she lived on the third floor and there was no way for a cat to climb up there. When she went to shoo it away, she found nothing.

I started paying more attention during my late-night arrivals from work. I'm a nurse at the county hospital, often pulling twelve-hour shifts that end well after midnight. Perfect timing, apparently, to catch glimpses of our mysterious "stray."

I saw it for the first time on a Tuesday night in late November. I was walking from my car to the entrance of Building 2 when movement caught my eye near the dumpsters. A dark shape, about the right size for a large cat, picking through scattered trash. But something about its movements struck me as wrong, just like Lorrie had said about the skunk.

Cats move with fluid grace, even when they're being cautious. This thing moved in sharp, deliberate jerks—head snapping from side to side, body freezing in unnatural positions before suddenly darting to a new location. When I took a step closer to get a better look, it turned toward me.

Even in the dim light from the parking lot lamps, I could see that its proportions were off. The head too large, the body too long, the legs positioned strangely beneath it. And its eyes reflected the light in a way that seemed too bright, too intense for a normal cat.

I hurried inside and didn't think about it again until the next wave of complaints started.

By December, the "stray cat" sightings had evolved into something else entirely. Residents began reporting a person in the complex at odd hours. Someone who didn't seem to belong to any of the units.

"There was a man standing by the mailboxes at 3 AM," wrote Tom from Building 3. "Just standing there, not moving. When I turned on my porch light to get a better look, he was gone."

Emma from Building 1 saw someone on the stairwell to the third floor, though she swore the figure had been crouched down like they were hiding. When she called out to ask if they needed help, the person "moved wrong" and disappeared around the corner too quickly.

The descriptions were maddeningly vague but consistently unsettling. A person who stood too still, moved too fast, or appeared in places they shouldn't be able to reach. Always glimpsed briefly, always gone before anyone could get a clear look.

But first, I had my own encounter with the "skunk" that made Lorrie's complaints suddenly make perfect sense.

It was a Thursday night in early November. I was taking out my trash around 11 PM when I saw it near the dumpsters—a dark, stocky shape about the size of a large skunk. My first instinct was to back away slowly and give it space. Everyone knows you don't corner a skunk.

But this one didn't behave like any skunk I'd ever encountered.

Instead of waddling away or raising its tail in warning, it simply sat there and stared at me. Not the quick, nervous glances of a wild animal assessing a threat. No, this was sustained, focused attention. It was studying me.

I stood frozen for what felt like minutes, trash bag hanging from my hand, while this thing studied me from twenty feet away. Its posture was wrong: too upright, shoulders too broad for a skunk's typical hunched build. And its eyes caught the parking lot lights in a way that seemed too bright, too reflective.

"Shoo," I said weakly, more out of nervousness than any real hope it would leave.

The thing tilted its head at the sound of my voice and not the quick, alert movement of an animal responding to noise, but a slow, deliberate motion like it was understanding my words. Then, without any hurry or apparent concern for my presence, it turned and walked away with a gait that looked more like a person crawling on all fours than any small mammal.

I stood there long after it disappeared, my skin crawling with the certainty that what I'd just encountered was not what it appeared to be.

The human sightings started a few weeks after that, and I had my own encounter on a Friday night in mid-December. I was coming home from a particularly exhausting shift, keys in hand as I approached the entrance to Building 2. As I reached for the door handle, I noticed someone standing at the far end of the covered walkway.

At first glance, it looked like a normal person—average height, wearing what appeared to be dark clothing. But they were standing perfectly motionless, facing the building. Not looking at their phone, not waiting for someone, just standing there like a statue.

I paused, keys halfway to the lock, and really looked at the figure. The proportions seemed off in a way I couldn't immediately identify. The arms hung slightly too long at the sides. The head was tilted at an angle that seemed to strain the limits of a normal neck. And despite the cold December night, I couldn't see any breath misting in the air around them.

"What the hell?" I muttered to myself.

It had heard that.

What happened next will haunt me forever. The figure's head snapped toward me with that same slow, deliberate motion I'd seen from the "skunk" weeks earlier. For a moment, we stared at each other across the distance, and I realized with growing horror that I was looking at the same intelligence that had studied me from the dumpster area.

It had been practicing. Learning to stand upright, to approximate human posture and behavior. But something about my comment, strange that it heard it, seemed to break whatever concentration was required to maintain the illusion.

The figure began to change.

Its carefully maintained human posture collapsed as its torso stretched vertically, becoming impossibly thin and elongated. The arms that had hung too long at its sides revealed their true length as they extended even further, joints bending in ways human arms never should. Dark, matted hair sprouted across its body in patches, while areas of pale, sickly skin showed through in irregular spots.

But the most terrifying transformation was its face. What I had taken for a human head in the darkness revealed itself as something that had been trying to approximate human features with only partial success. The basic structure was there: eyes, nose, mouth. The features stretched and distorted to fit a skull that was fundamentally wrong.

The eyes grew larger and brighter as I watched, filled with an intelligence that was clearly not human but understood exactly what effect this revelation was having on me. Its mouth stretched wider than any human mouth should, revealing multiple rows of sharp teeth arranged in patterns that suggested a jaw structure unlike anything in nature.

It stood there for perhaps ten seconds in its true form, no longer bothering to maintain its human masquerade. Then, with movements that flowed like liquid despite its skeletal frame, it dropped to all fours and loped away into the darkness between buildings with the same unnatural gait I'd witnessed weeks earlier.

I fumbled my keys into the lock and rushed inside, heart hammering against my ribs. Through the glass door, I could see the walkway was empty again, but I knew what I had witnessed was real.

That night, I barely slept. Every small sound from the hallway made me freeze, listening for footsteps that never came. By morning, I'd almost convinced myself I'd been imagining things—exhaustion and stress creating terrors where none should exist.

But I couldn't forget those eyes, the way they had watched me with such focused intelligence during both encounters.

But the sightings continued, and other residents began reporting their own encounters. The "person" was spotted on balconies that should have been impossible to reach, standing motionless in the courtyard at 4 AM, or moving through the parking lot with that same unnatural gait I'd witnessed.

Last week, Lorrie had her own terrifying encounter that confirmed my worst fears.

She was returning from her evening walk when she noticed someone standing by the mailboxes. At first, she thought it was another resident checking their mail late, but something about the figure's posture made her pause.

"It was trying so hard to look normal," she told me the next day, her voice still shaking. "Standing like a person, you know? But the arms were too long, and it was holding itself too stiff, like someone in a lot of pain."

When Lorrie called out a friendly greeting, the same thing happened to her that had happened to me. The creature's carefully maintained human disguise fell apart as its body stretched and contorted into its true form—the emaciated, werewolf-like thing with the partially human face and rows of sharp teeth.

"I saw its real face," she whispered. "It looked at me like it was disappointed."

Now I know what we're dealing with. This creature has been studying us, learning our routines and behaviors, practicing different forms of mimicry. The skunk phase, the cat phase, the human phase—they were all rehearsals.

But for what?

I've been staying in hotels for the past three nights, rotating between different locations each evening. I don't feel safe at Riverbend anymore, and I'm not sure I ever will again. But I can't afford to break my lease, and part of me knows that running might not help anyway.

Because I keep thinking about those intelligent eyes, the way it studied both Lorrie and me during our encounters. It wasn't looking at us like prey.

It was looking at us like it was memorizing our faces.

I've seen the thing that's been watching us from the shadows of Riverbend Apartments. I know what it looks like when it drops its disguises and shows its true form.

But I can't stop wondering: how many times has it successfully fooled us? How many of the "people" I've passed in the hallways or parking lot were actually this creature, having finally perfected its human disguise?

And more terrifyingly...is it still practicing, or has it moved on to whatever comes next?
