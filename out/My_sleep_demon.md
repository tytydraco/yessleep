This started since i was a 6 to 7 year old child.
I didnt have a good childhood mostly because i grew up only with my mother and a -special need- brother. So i mostly did stuff on my own while my mother cared for my brother. My father is out of the picture since i was a newborn baby. 

One day it all started, it was a normal day and i needed to sleep early because i had school tomorrow. We lived in a house with 3 rooms it wasnt big but it wasnt small either. Everyone had their own room they slept in.

After i finished school i would play outside a little bit and then go to my house. I ate my food and was getting ready to sleep early. I got into my bed and tried to fall asleep. After some time passed by i suddenly woke up because i heard something in my room, thinking it was my brother going to the bathroom i didnt move, i did get curious after 5 minutes where the sound came from and looked at the open door infront of my tiny room. Shocked i saw something that looked like a gray/black blurried orb that was a size of football.

It didnt look like anything it was just a dark colored orb that was blurry and had wave like motions on its surface. I got scared and tried to hide myself under the blankets like any child would do, but for some reason i couldnt move a inch of my body. Only could move my eyes.

The orb that i still see infront of me was slowly changing into a form that had arms and legs but no head at all. I saw it changing but i couldnt do anything. After it finished changing into somewhat a humanoid figure i was able to move my body a little, but it was like i was living in a slow-motion world, where every action i took was slowed down. But my brain still worked and saw everything happen in realtime. I was so scared that i tried to run away and get help from my mother, but the only thing i managed to do was fall of out of my bed, when i fell onto the ground i suddenly woke up!. 

I was confused because it felt like it was real and that i was awake... I had a feeling that something heavy was ontop of my chest and couldnt say a single world i only could run. I ran towards the bedroom of my mother without being able to scream or talk. I jumped inside of the bed thinking my mother would comfort me. When i calmed down a little i wanted to thank my mother for comforting me. I looked to the side where my mother was hugging me. But it wasnt my mother!

I always woke up after seeing the figure hugging me. It always starts as something blurry and then changes into a dark humanoid figure with no head. Or even when it has a head it wouldnt have any face. Sometimes i dont even know if im actually awake or still inside the dream.

I am now a 26 year old male living together with my partner, and from time to time i still experience this same thing. But instead of my mother comforting me it is my partner.
But i dont wanna let her know i experience this.
