I slept without dreams, and woke up earlier than I wanted to, but later than I was used to, probably around 10:30. I stumbled out of my tent to see Lana on a SAT-phone (satellite phone, if you like hiking or camping in remote areas you need one), and the rest of the group looking disturbed.



I joined the group and Marybell passed me a cup of coffee (I’m starting to like her more) while I leaned against a tree as I listened to Lana wrap up the phone call.



“That’s right officer, his pack was still in his tent.” She paused, listening, then said: “I don’t know, hold on,” she covered the receiver and asked us, “Does anyone know what kind of car he drives?”



Gabriel nodded, “We carpooled, we both live in the same area. He drives a fairly new Toyota Tacoma.”



Lana relayed that back to the officer and waited, “Right. No we haven’t had a chance to check the parking lot where we were… Because it’s an eight mile hike!”



She gave us a look that clearly said “get a load of this guy” and I had to hold in a chuckle. Finally she said, “Okay thank you, please let us know if you find him. Yes, we’ll call you if he shows back up. Okay thank you.”



She hung up and passed the SAT-phone back to Gabriel who slipped it into his pack and rejoined the group. 



I said, “So, still no Scott?”



Lana looked disturbed as she said, “I could have sworn I heard him last night as I was falling asleep. Like I just could have sworn I heard him saying my name, I thought he would be back today, but he isn’t.”



My brow furrowed, “Did you hear someone whistling too?”



Lana nodded, “Yeah! It sounded like someone was walking back towards camp and whistling the tune we’ve been studying. I figured Scott must have worked off whatever he ran off about and come back. I was going to go out and talk to him, but then it sounded like he was whispering my name and…”



She trailed off, her face going bright red, and Marybell put a protective arm around her and glared at the rest of the group with the same expression she used when one of us messed up and called her by her full name. It was clear Lana would not be questioned for her reasoning.



Marybell said, “Lana had her reasons not to go outside in the middle of the night and I don’t think anyone should challenge her on that. Besides it’s clear that whoever she heard, that wasn’t Scott.”



I felt goosebumps rise on my arm and stepped into the sunlight, hoping it would warm the chill that seemed to have seeped into my blood. “No, Lana, you clearly made the right choice. You don’t need to feel bad about that. If it had been Scott he would have returned to his tent. Or at least grabbed his stuff and went back to his car.” An idea occurred to me and I turned to Gabriel. “Hey, are his car keys in his pack?”



Gabriel nodded solemnly, “I checked as soon as I woke up. And I didn’t hear anyone come into my tent last night, and I’m a light sleeper. Whatever Lana heard, that wasn’t Scott.”



I rubbed my arms, the cold fearful chill wouldn’t go away, and I was wishing I could just go back home, but as we’d already told the ranger: it was an eight mile hike back to the cars and we were all still tired from the day before.



I said, “So… are we staying for the whole weekend like we planned, or are we heading back now?”



Everyone looked around uncomfortably until Leano said, “I do not see a reason to leave. We can all continue searching for Scott, then leave as we originally planned.”



I looked around the rest of the group, “Is everyone in agreement?”



Everyone gave their assent and we settled down into a tense silence to drink our coffee. To be honest, at the time I didn’t think anything had happened to Scott, and I was mostly just mad at him for wrecking the first vacation I’d taken in months. The rest of the group looked similarly irritated, which I think is why we didn’t split off to look for him until mid-afternoon.



We did our best to enjoy the morning, even though Scott’s disappearance sat between us all like an elephant, and had a pleasant lunch before we split off into groups to search for him. We decided to have Gabriel and Leano pair off, then me, Lana, and Marybell went in the opposite direction.



We combed through the woods screaming ourselves hoarse intermittently until the sun was starting to dip in the sky. We got back to camp when the sky was just starting to turn pink, Gabriel and Leano appeared not long after we started making dinner looking just as disappointed and annoyed as we felt.



By the time we had finished dinner it was dusk, and dark greys and blues had replaced the soft pink on the horizon. It was clear none of us wanted to go back to looking for Scott, and I think we had all decided he was fine and just messing with us, but we sat in a tense silence, no one wanting to suggest we give up or get back to it.



Finally Marybell sighed loudly and said, “Okay, I’m not going back out in the dark. Let’s make some smores and tell stories or something.”



Everyone let out a relieved sigh as Gabriel lumbered off into the near darkness to retrieve more fuel for the fire, and Leano went to the food packs and found the stuff we had for s'mores. By the time the stars had come out overhead the general atmosphere was once again fun and celebratory, and it seemed like the majority of us were a lot less frustrated. 



Which I think is why, when we heard whistling off in the woods, we met it with excitement instead of concern.



As we sat around the fire a familiar tune wafted up to our camp and we all jumped up in excitement. The problem was, we all ran in different directions. I was absolutely certain I heard the whistling coming from directly behind me, but Marybell sprinted off to the left, Lana turned and went up the path we had taken to get here, and Leano and Gabriel went in their own directions.



I stopped at the edge of the woods, feeling a sense of heavy trepidation weigh down my body, keeping my feet from moving. I looked back at the rest of the group disappearing into the trees and made a snap decision, taking off after Marybell who was closest to me.



I followed after her, using the sound of her crashing through the woods to ignore the whistling that seemed to want to pull me in the opposite direction. When Marybell finally stopped running we were deep in the woods and very nearly lost. She stopped and looked back at me as though she were coming out of a trance.



In a whisper she asked, “Sammy? Where did Scott go?”



I shook my head and walked towards her like I was trying not to spook a horse. I didn’t speak until I could put my hand on her shoulder, feeling the warm skin beneath my hand, “Mary I… I don’t think that was Scott. I- did you see that everyone went in a different direction?”



She shook her head, looking sick, “What was I following? Sammy, I could have sworn that was Scott but when you stopped me-”



I had nothing to say, I felt helpless. I grabbed her hand and said, “We need to go back to camp and see if we can find the others. No more taking off into the woods at night.”



She nodded numbly and followed me as I traced our path back. It felt like it took a lot longer to get back than it did when we were following the whistling. When we made it back I was relieved to see Leano and Gabriel standing by the fire looking scared.



When we stumbled into the firelight both men rushed toward us, Leano grabbed me and Gabriel grabbed Marybell and we both got swooped up into warm hugs. When Leano finally let go we took a moment to catch our breath.



Finally I said, “What was that? Does anyone know where Lana went?“



Gabriel shook his head grimly, “When I realized we all went in different directions following the same sound I went after Leano.”



He gave a meaningful look to Leano who picked up the story in a soft, seemingly terrified voice, “I was running after the song, I thought I could see Scott but I realized after Gabriel grabbed me that I had been following something that… didn’t look human. I only thought it was Scott because- I think I wanted to believe it was him? Or perhaps it was like an illusion. It was Scott, I was sure it was him, right until Gabriel stopped me and then I saw this *thing.* It appeared to wear a mask made out of bone.”



Marybell made a choking sound and whispered, “I saw the same thing.”



Gabriel patted him on the back gently, “When I saw him he was about to step into a pond. I mean honestly it looked more like a bog than anything else… Maybe he would have been fine, but I don’t know.”



Marybell looked at me in horror, “It was the same thing for me. It was only after you stopped me that I realized I wasn’t seeing Scott.”



I shuddered, “We need to find Lana. I have no idea what’s out there, but I don’t think we’re safe.”



Marybell and Leano nodded, but Gabriel literally put his foot down, “Absolutely not, my abuela would beat me with her chancla if we did that… if I even survive anyway.” He shook his head like he was clearing it. “No, nobody else goes out in the woods until morning.”



I started to object but Gabriel stood in front of me, his tall form sending a clear message that he wasn’t letting anyone go back into the woods as he rumbled, “Sammy, I’m serious. Two members of our group are missing, I don’t want that number going up. Weren’t you the one saying Nora would freak out if you lost anyone? Well let's try to keep that number from climbing.”



My shoulders fell as I looked around the group to see if anyone else was on my side, but nobody would make eye contact with me. Finally in a small voice I said, “Can we look for her in the morning?”



Gabriel nodded, relief visibly flooding through him. “Yes, of course. But for tonight I don’t think anyone should be alone. Leano, you should stay in my tent. Bella and Sam, you two can share. But we need to honor the buddy system from now on. No one so much as sneezes without their buddy knowing about it.”



I glanced over my shoulder into the woods and I could have sworn I saw movement. I was still hopeful that Lana was okay, maybe even nearby. I stepped towards the trees, but Gabriel grabbed my arm. I glared up at him, but stayed where I was and called out, “Hello? Is someone out there?”



A voice responded from the darkness, sounding a little too far away, considering where the shadow seemed to be speaking from, “Sammy?”



I shuddered, the voice didn’t sound like anything. It’s not just that it didn’t sound like Lana, it didn’t sound like a living being at all. I stepped backwards at the same time that Gabriel started dragging me to the fire, muttering, “Nuh uh, no way, dios mio, abuela will kill me if I get killed out here.”



I couldn’t stop staring into the darkness, trying to catch a glimpse of the speaker.



I called out, “Nora, is that you?”



Gabriel lifted his eyebrows at me, but Marybell and Leano both offered approving looks.



The voice called back, in a tone that was almost sing-songy despite still sounding a little too far away, “Yeeeees, me, Nora. Come here, I found the other one.”



Gorge rose in my throat and I collapsed to my knees as I did my best to hold it in. Marybell whimpered and Gabriel stumbled backwards, nearly stepping into the fire as he did. 



Leano looked at us helplessly and whispered, "What is that?”



I shook my head as we all stayed silent, waiting.



I’ll do my best to describe what the voice sounded like, but it’s hard. If you’ve ever heard one of those AI voices that’s fully generated, no human voice was involved in recording or anything, it had that kind of quality. Clearly not human, clearly pretending to be. It was hollow, but not in the way that AI voices are hollow, it was hollow like the inside of a mountain, or the very deepest, farthest corner of a dark cave. My point is it sounded natural, earthen, as if the voice was as much a part of nature as a wolf’s howl, or a bird's screech. If you’ve ever heard the warning song a bird gives before a really bad storm, it felt exactly like that. A hollow earthen warning that I was too late to heed.



The next time the voice spoke it had clearly moved coming from the other side of the woods, it had changed from the poor imitation of a woman’s voice to a slightly better imitation of Scott’s voice, “Sammy, I’m right out here, Sammy. Can you come help me, I’m stuck?”



I wanted to scream every time it said my name, but I forced myself to hold my ground. I took in deep, long breaths as I tried to calm my nerves. Gabriel grabbed both my shoulders to keep me from moving, which I found mostly insulting because I’m nowhere near that stupid.



The four of us huddled by the fire, adding what was left of our fuel to it at occasional intervals, and doing our best not to make a sound. Every time one of us spoke, even in a whisper, the voice would reply, calling out from a new position every time. Sometimes it sounded like it was just at the edge of the darkness, other times it sounded further away, twice it even sounded like it was coming from above us, which made Marybell sob uncontrollably until Gabriel could calm her down.



After we ran out of fuel I looked to Gabriel, wondering if he would be brave enough to run to the edge of the woods for more fuel. None of us wanted to leave the ring of fire light, none of us wanted to go back to our tents where it would eventually become completely dark. But if we stayed by the fire without finding more fuel, we would still eventually find ourselves plunged into darkness anyway.



Gabriel looked exhausted, his brown skin was so pale it looked ashen, and the bags under his eyes were heavy and dark. I leaned towards him and whispered, “What do we do now?”



He gave me a look that I can only describe as begrudging terror, cleared his throat, and said, “Okay everyone, we need to-” he looked up at the crown of trees above our heads and gulped painfully, then gestured for us all to come closer and began whispering, “We need to get to the tents. Keep a flashlight nearby, don’t leave your tent and don’t let anyone convince you to leave your tent or open it for any reason.”



From up in the trees, about ten, maybe twenty feet away, we heard laughter.



Everyone winced as though we’d been slapped, all at the same time, then we began slowly moving away from the fire. Marybell and I intertwined hands and I pointed to my tent. Marybell mouthed *I want to grab my sleeping bag,* and then pointed at her own tent.*.* Well it was either that or *I want to park my jeep in there.*



We walked slowly to Marybell’s tent, eyes scanning the woods the whole time. There was the occasional bird cry or rustle of leaves, and a few times there was a terrifying twig snap, but the voice remained quiet. She ducked into her tent to grab her sleeping bag, and a few other items, as I stood right next to her tent, scanning the darkness and trying not to cry.



I felt like the biggest fool in the world. My mom had warned me against going out into the wilderness and I had ignored her most important piece of advice. I was probably the only person in the group who had a former Appalachian resident giving me advice. And I ignored it. I thought about the list of rules she had made me write down, and felt a wave of shame course over me. I should never have gone on this trip.



Marybell collected her things and stepped back out into the halflight of the dying fire. With a tense nod we began making our way towards my tent. I could still hear the occasional whistle from the forest, always coming from a different location, always sounding like it was coming from a different distance.



I felt relief rush into me when we reached my tent, quickly replaced by a new wave of fear when I heard the song being hummed. Do you know how close someone has to be for you to feel them humming? Not hear, but feel the vibrations of their hum. I grabbed Marybell and pushed both of us into the tent, zipped it up, and laid down back to back, breathing heavily. I found myself focusing on Marybell’s breathing to drown out the sounds coming from outside.



For the first few minutes we were in the tent, we watched a shadow pace outside, alternating humming and laughing. After a few minutes the shadow outside our tent skipped away and the humming changed to singing. I managed to catch a few words, to the same tune as our song, “Old as mountain roots, like blood beneath a miners boots.”



I turned to look at Marybell, but she had her eyes pressed tightly closed, in the light of my flashlight she looked as pale as bone.



I couldn’t close my own eyes, I had to keep them wide open and on the zipper. I was utterly terrified that the figure from the woods would reach out, unzip the tent, and step inside. Instead, the night stretched on with more of the same. Whistling, footsteps, rustling, and the occasional sound of laughter. It made my blood run cold.



I’m not sure when I fell asleep, but at some point I did, because I woke up to weak sunlight poking its way through my tent. Marybell was awake and rubbing her eyes when I sat up.



I said, “Good morning. Have you heard from Gabriel and Leano yet?”



Marybell shook her head, and I went to pull down the zipper but she put her hand on mine to stop me. “What if… what if it’s some kind of trick?”



I looked up and saw the shadow of tree branches against the plastic of the tent, I could tell sunlight was filtering through, and I thought I heard bird song outside too. But Marybell had put the idea in my head and I was terrified that somehow I was wrong. I didn’t know if the thing in the woods could create an illusion like that, but it had made all of us think we were chasing after Scott when we weren’t. I pulled my hand away, took a deep breath, and then remembered there was a ‘window’ in my tent that I could unzip. I leaned over, unzipped the window, and sighed in relief. Sweet, beautiful sunlight.



Marybell and I stepped outside, stretched, and went to Gabriel and Leano’s tent to check on them. It took nearly half an hour to convince them to exit their tent, apparently they’d had the same thought as Marybell, but after answering a million questions to prove who we were, we managed to get them both outside. 



Gabriel gave us both warm hugs when we opened the tent, Leano merely squeezed our shoulders gently. 



We packed our things quickly, including splitting up Lana and Scott’s things so we could take them back with us. Just in case.



I did stop and pull out Lana’s sun hat, setting it down gently where she could find it. Just in case.



As we started the long hike back, Gabriel pulled out the SAT-phone and called the police to explain what happened the night before, and let them know another member of our group was missing. After he hung up, no one spoke for a long time, aside from the occasional call for Lana or Scott.



Part of me wishes I could tell you that the hike back was fraught with terror, that we were chased by whatever horrible creature took Lana and Scott, but it wasn’t. Overall it was a lovely hike, that probably would have been very relaxing if not for the two missing people. It honestly made me kind of angry, knowing that whatever was stalking us the night before was too cowardly to come out in the daylight. When we got back to our vehicles there was a police cruiser waiting for us. 



We gave our statements, telling the full truth despite the way the officer interviewing us rolled his eyes when we started talking about the whistling and voices in the woods. I didn’t care at that point, I just wanted to go home. We answered his questions, supplied any details we thought he needed but missed during his questions, and then said goodbye to each other and got in our cars.



It was Sunday, and I knew I would have to explain things to Nora the next day, but right at that moment all I wanted to do was sleep. I made the long drive back to my house, parked, and shuffled inside, refusing to look at the trees around my house as I did. Just in case.



Despite my exhaustion, I couldn’t sleep. I wound up shuffling around my house guiltily, not wanting to open any of my blinds or risk going outside. It was still daylight, but nothing felt safe anymore. I had this image in the back of my head, Lana and Scott standing dead eyed next to the deer I’d seen the morning before we left. I wasn’t sure if I would ever feel ready to leave my house again.



Finally, when the sun started going down I couldn’t handle the fear anymore and I called my mom. I explained everything, admittedly through tears, and she listened gently until I was done.



Finally she said, “Okay first things first, the two missing people. They weren’t found?”



I shook my head, remembered she couldn’t see me, and choked out, “No, but to be fair I got home like two hours ago.”



She sighed, “Sammy, they’re both dead. Process that however you need to, but *process it.* Accept it, take it as truth because when you hear them calling for you tonight you absolutely have to stay inside.”



All the air rushed out of me as if she had broken one of my ribs. The panic I’d been managing to hold at bay had just rushed through my body so quickly I was surprised I wasn’t having a heart attack. I managed to say, “Mom they’ve only been missing for less than two days. They might-”



She cut me off with a more stern voice than I had ever heard her use in my adult life, “Samira stop it, listen to me. I’m so sorry this happened to you. I’m not going to say any “I told you so’s”, so in return I need you to listen, and I mean really listen.” She stopped and when she came back her tone was a lot softer, albeit still pretty stern. “Your friends are already dead, and I’m so sorry. But letting yourself believe they may be alive isn’t going to keep you safe. But knowing what you’re up against will.”



And that’s when she finally told me her story.
